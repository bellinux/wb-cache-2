2500|$|A {{contemporary}} {{technical description}} with photographs and drawings appeared in Flight, 13 February 1919, claiming that [...] "it {{would seem that}} such construction {{would result in a}} low <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety,</b> but the designer claims a safety factor of seven throughout".|$|E
2500|$|The {{engineers}} {{responsible for}} the design of the canal levees and the I-walls embedded in them overestimated the soil strength, meaning that the soil strength used in the design calculations was greater than what actually existed under and near the levee during Hurricane Katrina. [...] They made unconservative (i.e., erring toward unsafe) interpretations of the data: the soil below the levee was actually weaker than that used in the I-wall design (ASCE: External Review Panel, pg 48). [...] Another critical engineering oversight that led to the failure of the 17th Street Canal involves not taking into account the possibility of a water-filled gap {{which turned out to be}} a very important aspect of the failures of the I-walls around New Orleans. [...] “Analysis indicate that, with the presence of a water-filled gap, the <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> is about 30 percent lower. [...] Because a <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> of 1.3 was used for design, a reduction of 30 percent would reduce the <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> to approximately one: a condition of incipient failure.” (ASCE: External Review Panel, pg 51) This meant that the design included a safety factor of 30% ("1.3"), and could cope in theory with stresses 30% more than expected, but the error due to the water gap was about 30%, which immediately used up the entire safety margin, leaving no leeway in the design if any other excess stress occurred.|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} made <b>of</b> the <b>factors</b> {{governing}} the structural {{design of the}} fully reusable space shuttle booster to establish a rational approach to select optimum structural <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety.</b> The study included trade studies <b>of</b> structural <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> versus booster service life, weight, cost, and reliability. Similar trade studies can be made on other vehicles using the procedures developed. The major structural components of a selected baseline booster were studied in depth, each being examined to determine the fatigue life, safe-life, and fail-safe capabilities of the baseline design. Each component was further examined to determine its reliability and safety requirements, and the change of structural weight with <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety.</b> The apparent <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> resulting from fatigue, safe-life, proof test, and fail-safe requirements were identified.

30|$|In practice, {{different}} {{slope stability}} methods produce different slip surfaces and hence different minimum <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> (Duncan and Wright 1980). Therefore, {{it is important}} to compare the analysis results with field measurements rather than comparing the <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> only. The most critical issue in evaluating different analysis methods is the ability of that method to capture the most critical slip surface. Under a certain critical slip surface, <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> from different methods can be different due to the difference in the mathematical formulation and the simplifications used in developing the method.|$|R

2500|$|If {{the forces}} {{available}} to resist movement {{are greater than}} the forces driving movement, the slope is considered stable. [...] A <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> is calculated by dividing the forces resisting movement by the forces driving movement. In earthquake-prone areas, the analysis is typically run for static conditions and pseudo-static conditions, where the seismic forces from an earthquake are assumed to add static loads to the analysis.|$|E
2500|$|The bearing {{capacity}} of soil {{is the average}} contact stress between a foundation and the soil which will cause shear failure in the soil. [...] Allowable bearing stress is the {{bearing capacity}} divided by a <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety.</b> [...] Sometimes, on soft soil sites, large settlements may occur under loaded foundations without actual shear failure occurring; in such cases, the allowable bearing stress is determined {{with regard to the}} maximum allowable settlement. It is important during construction and design stage of a project to evaluate the subgrade strength. The California Bearing Ratio (CBR) test is commonly used to determine the suitability of a soil as a subgrade for design and construction. The field Plate Load Test is commonly used to predict the deformations and failure characteristics of the soil/subgrade and modulus of subgrade reaction (ks). The Modulus of subgrade reaction (ks) is used in foundation design, soil-structure interaction studies and design of highway pavements.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first use}} (a {{calculated}} value) is generally {{referred to as}} a <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> or, to be explicit, a realized <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety.</b> The second use (a required value) as a design factor, design <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> or required <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety.</b> The realized <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> must be greater than the required design <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety.</b> However, between various industries and engineering groups usage is inconsistent and confusing, {{it is important to be}} aware of which definition(s) are being used. The cause of much confusion is that various reference books and standards agencies use the <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> definitions and terms differently. Design codes and structural and mechanical engineering textbooks often use [...] "Factor of Safety" [...] to mean the fraction of total structural capability over that needed and are realized <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> (first use).

40|$|ABSTRACT: The paper {{examines}} seismic stability {{analyses of}} geosynthetic-rein-forced segmental retaining walls (modular block walls). Stability analyses are devel-oped {{within the framework}} of a pseudo-static approach that gives <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> against collapse mechanisms or rupture of component materials. The Mononobe-Okabe method is used to estimate dynamic earth pressures. Parametric analyses <b>of</b> forces and <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> related to external, internal and facing failure modes for walls constructed on competent foundations are presented. Shear interfaces between facing units are considered as possible planes of failure in facing stability analyses. The potential for local topplingof the facing column is also investigated. The results of anal-yses demonstrate that there is a limiting value of the horizontal seismic coefficient abovewhich themargin <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> against base sliding and overturningmay be unaccept-ably low during a seismic event for segmental retaining walls designed to just satisfy minimum <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> under static loading conditions.

50|$|A popular {{stability}} analysis {{approach is}} based on principles pertaining to the limit equilibrium concept.

Equilibrium stresses are calculated along the failure plane, and compared to the soils shear strength as determined by Terzaghi’s shear strength equation. Stability is ultimately decided by a <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> equal to the ratio of shear strength to the equilibrium stresses along the failure surface. A <b>factor</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> greater than one generally implies a stable slope, failure of which should not occur assuming the slope is undisturbed.

As such, the associated flexural capacity of the barrier wall junction or anchorage capacity is taken as 189.5  kN[*]×[*] 0.99  m applied load arm to the deck slab[*]=[*] 187.61  kN m/m. According to CHBDC of 2006 at end portion of PL- 3 barrier, the factored applied moment at the barrier deck junction is 102  kN m/m.

40|$|In static {{as well as}} dynamic design it is {{important}} to allow for the fact that uncertainties can exist in the properties of the designed system and in the applied loading. Traditionally this has been faced through the use <b>of</b> <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety,</b> which are developed and refined on the basis of experience and historical evidence. For systems where efficient design is of the utmost importance (for example the minimum weight design of an aircraft structure) {{it is possible that the}} traditional <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> may be overly conservative, so that optimal efficiency cannot be achieved. Furthermore, historical <b>factors</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> are unlikely to be appropriate for new design concepts or new composite materials. The properties of composites, in fact, present a scattering much higher than metals, mainly due to manufacturing and assembling process.
