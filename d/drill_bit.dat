5|$|The Watts Brothers Tool Works square <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> has {{the shape}} of a Reuleaux triangle, {{modified}} with concavities to form cutting surfaces. When mounted in a special chuck which allows for the bit not having a fixed centre of rotation, it can drill a hole that is nearly square. Although patented by Henry Watts in 1914, similar drills invented by others were used earlier. Other Reuleaux polygons are used to drill pentagonal, hexagonal, and octagonal holes.|$|E
25|$|While {{the above}} {{is a common}} use of center drill bits, it is a {{technically}} incorrect practice {{and should not be}} considered for production use. The correct tool to start a traditionally drilled hole (a hole drilled by a high-speed steel (HSS) twist <b>drill</b> <b>bit)</b> is a spotting <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> (or a spot <b>drill</b> <b>bit,</b> as they are referenced in the U.S.). The included angle of the spotting <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> should be the same as, or greater than, the conventional <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> so that the <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> will then start without undue stress on the bit's corners, which would cause premature failure of the bit and a loss of hole quality.|$|E
25|$|Conventional {{twist drill}} bits tend to wander when {{presented}} to a flat workpiece. For metalwork, this is countered by drilling a pilot hole with a spotting <b>drill</b> <b>bit.</b> In wood, the lip and spur <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> is another solution: The {{centre of the}} <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> is given not the straight chisel of the twist <b>drill</b> <b>bit,</b> but a spur with a sharp point and four sharp corners to cut the wood. The sharp point of the spur simply pushes into the soft wood to keep the <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> in line.|$|E

25|$|Long series <b>drill</b> <b>bits</b> are unusually long twist <b>drill</b> <b>bits.</b> However, {{they are}} not the best tool for {{routinely}} drilling deep holes, as they require frequent withdrawal to clear the flutes of swarf and to prevent breakage of the <b>bit.</b> Instead, gun <b>drill</b> <b>bits</b> are preferred for deep hole drilling.|$|R

25|$|Most modern solid-carbide bits {{should not}} be used in {{conjunction}} with a spot <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> or a center <b>drill</b> <b>bit,</b> as solid-carbide bits are specifically designed to start their own hole. Usually, spot drilling will cause premature failure of the solid-carbide bit and a certain loss of hole quality. If it is deemed necessary to chamfer a hole with a spot or center <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> when a solid-carbide <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> is used, it is best practice to do so after the hole is drilled.|$|E

25|$|While {{the term}} drill may refer {{to either a}} {{drilling}} machine or a <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> {{for use in a}} drilling machine, in this article, for clarity, <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> or bit is used throughout to refer to a bit for use in a drilling machine, and drill refers always to a drilling machine.|$|E
25|$|A step <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> is a <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> {{that has}} the tip ground down to a {{different}} diameter. The transition between this ground diameter and the original diameter is either straight, to form a counterbore, or angled, to form a countersink. The advantage to this style is that both diameters have the same flute characteristics, which keeps the bit from clogging when drilling in softer materials, such as aluminum; in contrast, a <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> with a slip-on collar {{does not have the}} same benefit. Most of these bits are custom-made for each application, which makes them more expensive.|$|E

50|$|<b>Drill</b> <b>bits</b> {{are cutting}} tools used to remove {{material}} to create holes, almost always of circular cross-section. <b>Drill</b> <b>bits</b> come in many sizes and shape and can create {{different kinds of}} holes in many different materials.

25|$|Using an {{ordinary}} two-flute twist <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> {{to enlarge the}} hole resulting from a casting core will not produce a clean result, the result will possibly be out of round, off center and generally of poor finish.

25|$|The twist <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> {{was invented}} by Steven A. Morse of East Bridgewater, Massachusetts in 1861. The {{original}} method of manufacture was to cut two grooves in opposite sides of a round bar, then to twist the bar (giving the tool its name) to produce the helical flutes. Nowadays, the <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> is usually made by rotating the bar while moving it past a grinding wheel to cut the flutes {{in the same manner}} as cutting helical gears.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{approximately}} 1. 5 – 2. 5 μm thick, TiAlCrYN nanocomposite coatings were {{deposited on}} various substrates {{such as high}} speed steel (HSS) <b>drill</b> <b>bits,</b> mild steel and silicon by reactive magnetron sputtering. The coatings were characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, field-emission scanning electron microscopy and nanoindentation techniques. TiAlCrYN nanocomposite coating exhibited hardness {{of the order of}} 25 GPa. Micro-Raman spectroscopy was used to characterize the structural changes as a result of heating of the TiAlCrYN nanocomposite coatings in air (600 - 1000 oC) and the coatings were found to be thermally stable in air up to 900 oC. For the performance evaluation, the TiAlCrYN coated high-speed steel (HSS) <b>drill</b> <b>bits</b> and uncoated HSS <b>drill</b> <b>bits</b> were subjected to accelerated machining conditions. The uncoated HSS <b>drill</b> <b>bits</b> failed after <b>drilling</b> 50 holes, while drilling a 12 mm thick 304 stainless steel plate, whereas, the TiAlCrYN coated <b>drill</b> <b>bits</b> averaged 657 holes before failure...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the first}} uses of tapers was to mount <b>drill</b> <b>bits</b> {{directly}} to machine tools, {{such as in the}} tailstock of a lathe, although later drill chucks were invented that mounted to machine tools and in turn held non-tapered <b>drill</b> <b>bits.</b>|$|R
25|$|Center drill bits, {{occasionally}} {{known as}} Slocombe drill bits, {{are used in}} metalworking to provide a starting hole for a larger-sized <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> or to make a conical indentation {{in the end of}} a workpiece in which to mount a lathe center. In either use, the name seems appropriate, as the bit is either establishing the center of a hole or making a conical hole for a lathe center. However, the true purpose of a center <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> is the latter task, while the former task is best done with a spotting <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> (as explained in detail below). Nevertheless, because of the frequent lumping together of both the terminology and the tool use, suppliers may call center drill bits combined-drill-and-countersinks {{in order to make it}} unambiguously clear what product is being ordered. They are numbered from 00 to 10 (smallest to largest).|$|E
25|$|The twist <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> is {{the type}} {{produced}} in largest quantity today. It comprises a cutting point {{at the tip of}} a cylindrical shaft with helical flutes; the flutes act as an Archimedean screw and lift swarf out of the hole.|$|E
25|$|Metals are {{typically}} isotropic, and an ordinary twist <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> shears {{the edges of}} the hole cleanly. Wood drilled across the grain has long strands of wood fiber. These long strands tend {{to pull out of the}} wood hole, rather than being cleanly cut at the hole edge. The lip and spur <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> has the outside corner of the cutting edges leading, so that it cuts the periphery of the hole before the inner parts of the cutting edges plane off the base of the hole. By cutting the periphery first, the lip maximizes the chance that the fibers can be cut cleanly, rather than having them pull messily out of the timber.|$|E

25|$|Drill bits with {{no point}} angle {{are used in}} {{situations}} where a blind, flat-bottomed hole is required.

25|$|Lip and {{spur drill}} bits are also {{effective}} in soft plastic.
