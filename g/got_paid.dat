The solicitor had originally met Stanley through serving a bankruptcy notice {{on him and}} had ended up as his attorney. The original debtor never <b>got</b> <b>paid.</b> Stanley boasted of his surplus import licenses and the solicitor advised Harris whom he knew wanted to import pinball machines. In July 1948, Harris approached fellow supplier Francis Price with a proposal that they meet with Stanley. Stanley claimed that he could bribe Belcher and Financial Secretary to the Treasury Glenvil Hall to obtain licenses. After canvassing some commercial and political confidantes, Price contacted the police. Press speculation intensified.|$|E

25|$|After leaving Human Entertainment, Suda founded Grasshopper Manufacture {{to fulfill}} his wish to create {{original}} video game projects. Its debut title was The Silver Case for the PlayStation. He was initially approached by ASCII Entertainment, who acted as the game's publishers and provided funding. Suda acted as director, co-writer and designer for the game. Alongside this, Suda had the responsibility of acting as the studio's CEO, so he felt responsible for ensuring everyone <b>got</b> <b>paid.</b> The initial staff of Grasshopper Manufacture was fairly small, which meant that the game's assets and style needed to be adjusted to fit limited resources and a tight budget. The title was a success in Japan and helped establish Grasshopper Manufacture, although had limited critical success due to the proliferation of its visual novel style at the time. While Suda wanted an overseas release, {{the large amount of}} text and difficulties localizing puzzle elements kept The Silver Case exclusive to Japan for a long time. Suda attempted to port the game to the Nintendo DS, but he was unsatisfied with the result and cancelled the project despite it being close to completion. Suda later acted as producer for a high-definition remaster of The Silver Case for Microsoft Windows, which was the title's Western debut. He also co-wrote new content that connected to its mobile sequel Ward 25.|$|E

After hearing the alternative, Katzenberg agreed to redo scenes in the film, saying, [...] "It was so good we took $4m worth of animation out and did it again." [...] A point Myers disputes, saying [...] "it didn’t cost the studio “millions of dollars,” as rumored. “What it meant is instead of me going in for ten sessions, I went in for twenty sessions. I <b>got</b> <b>paid</b> the same.". [...] Because of Myers voicing the character, more ideas began to come. There were clearer story points, fresher gags and comedy bits.

500|$|Scott {{chose to}} direct American Gangster {{based on the}} {{paradoxical}} values of Frank Lucas and Richie Roberts. The film somewhat focuses on the comparatively ethical business practices of the [...] "wicked gangster" [...] and the womanizing and failed marriage of the [...] "do-gooder" [...] police detective. Washington, who was not normally a fan of gangster films, chose to portray Lucas when he saw [...] "the arc of the character" [...] had ended with prices that Lucas paid for his actions. To prepare for their roles, the actors met their real-life counterparts. Washington acquired Lucas's Southern accent, and Crowe practiced to match Roberts's manner of speaking and body language, requesting tape recordings of Roberts to assist in his preparation. The following March, the studio rehired Zaillian to rewrite the script for American Gangster. It was rumored that Washington <b>got</b> <b>paid</b> another $20million for when the project was greenlit again; that rumor proved to be false, as he signed on for his gross. The budget had escalated to $100 million, which Grazer stated was unexpected given [...] "It's not a high-concept comedy, it's not a fantasy movie, it's not a four-quadrant movie". Grazer and Scott still had {{to pay back the}} studio $3 million for a budget overrun.|$|E
500|$|In a retrospective, Paul Mallinson of Computer & Video Games (CVG) {{wrote that}} the game's {{production}} was [...] "speedy, focused and fun". Castle said that, because the company was creating other titles at the time, development of Command & Conquer was not a [...] "working party"; but lead programmer Joe Bostic later {{said that it was}} [...] "so much fun that I would sometimes marvel that I actually <b>got</b> <b>paid</b> as well." [...] The game's playtesters were enthusiastic about the game during development, which Castle later said had encouraged the team to work harder. The team created live-action FMV cutscenes for the game. These cutscenes contain no professional actors aside from Kucan, who played Kane and was heavily involved in their production. The cast is made up of Westwood team members, and a low budget meant that filming took place in [...] "spare rooms" [...] and warehouses. Castle later said that the team [...] "had no illusions that we were as good as TV or film," [...] but that the cutscenes were not intentionally campy. He credited Kucan with [...] "taking ragtag group of people who had no business {{in front of a camera}} and making something reasonably good." [...] To replace the spice from Dune II, the team introduced Tiberium, which was inspired by the 1957 B-movie The Monolith Monsters. Castle said that the team's goal in both cases was to create [...] "a central resource that everybody was fighting over." [...] As with Dune II, the soundtrack was composed by Frank Klepacki.|$|E
500|$|Giancarlo Vulcano, a music {{editor and}} {{associate}} arranger on the show, revealed that Richmond taught him the song one morning at Silvercup Studios—where {{the show is}} filmed—and they played {{the first half of}} [...] "He Needs a Kidney" [...] at the script's read-through. According to Vulcano, the 30 Rock staff loved the song and the two were satisfied with the reception of it. While arranging the instrumentation, Richmond hired violinists for the episode's background music and for [...] "He Needs a Kidney", which according to him he usually does not get the opportunity {{to have a lot of}} violin sounds on the show. The recording sessions with the musical guests took place on Stage 1 at Silvercup Studios; Stage 1 serves as the set for TGS with Tracy Jordan, a fictitious comedy sketch show featured on 30 Rock. Richmond and Vulcano were complimentary towards the musicians—Clay Aiken, Sara Bareilles, the Beastie Boys (Mike D and Ad-Rock), Mary J. Blige, Elvis Costello, Sheryl Crow, Steve Earle, Wyclef Jean, Norah Jones, Talib Kweli, Cyndi Lauper, Adam Levine, Michael McDonald, Rhett Miller, Moby, Robert Randolph, and Rachael Yamagata—who performed [...] "He Needs a Kidney". In the DVD commentary for this episode, Richmond believed that the entire song would not make it into the airing. Elvis Costello was once approached to do an appearance on 30 Rock, but the appearance fell-through. At an Oscar's after party, Fey ran into Costello and asked him if he could appear, which he agreed to. According to Fey, none of the music artists <b>got</b> <b>paid</b> to appear on the show as [...] "they all did [...] for free." [...] The reason for this was due to a joke in the song in which Sheryl Crow was the only individual to get paid, as the rest said they did it for free. Following the broadcast of this episode of 30 Rock, the musical performance video was made available for digital download on iTunes with all the proceeds from the sales going to the National Kidney Foundation.|$|E
