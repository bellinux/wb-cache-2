500|$|<b>Familiars</b> are {{creatures that}} can {{accompany}} players in combat, performing (usually) helpful actions. <b>Familiars</b> are often {{instrumental in the}} completion of quests. [...] <b>Familiars</b> possess many abilities; for example, a Sabre-Toothed Lime attacks monsters, a Leprechaun grants extra meat after combat, and a Hovering Sombrero increases stat gains from combat. Some <b>familiars,</b> such as the Ninja Pirate Zombie Robot, {{are very difficult to}} acquire.|$|R
5000|$|Recent {{scholarship}} on <b>familiars</b> exhibits {{the depth and}} respectability absent from earlier demonological approaches. The study of <b>familiars</b> has grown from an academic topic in folkloric journals to a general topic in popular books and journals incorporating anthropology, history and other disciplines. James Sharpe, in The Encyclopedia of Witchcraft: the Western Tradition, states: [...] "Folklorists began their investigations in the 19th Century and found that <b>familiars</b> figured prominently in ideas about witchcraft." ...|$|R

500|$|<b>Familiars,</b> {{known as}} [...] in the Japanese {{version of the}} games, are creatures that wander {{throughout}} the game world. They {{can be found in}} different shapes and forms, and can be obtained after being defeated in battle. They can then be tamed, in order to be suitable to send out in battle to fight for players. Players command <b>familiars,</b> who generally have a range of magic and physical attacks. <b>Familiars</b> level up and evolve alongside the human characters; each have unique statistics and capabilities, and can be guided through their upgrades with treats and equipped with items. <b>Familiars</b> are not present in Revenant Kingdom; creatures known as Higgledies are used in combat, with different spirits using special moves on enemies.|$|R

50|$|Since the 20th century {{a number}} of magical practitioners, {{including}} adherents of the Neopagan religion of Wicca, have begun to utilise the concept of <b>familiars,</b> due to their association with older forms of magic. These contemporary practitioners utilize pets, wildlife or believe that invisible spirit versions of <b>familiars</b> act as magical aids.|$|R
50|$|Some enemies use <b>familiars</b> {{that change}} their {{vulnerabilities}} accordingly {{depending on whether}} the player is playing as a human or a yōkai at the moment. These <b>familiars</b> are completely invulnerable when the player switched to a yōkai, {{but at the same time}} these <b>familiars</b> cannot collide with the yōkai player and do not shoot bullets when the player is on top of them. The enemies' alternating vulnerabilities in this game draw comparisons with Ikaruga. Bosses may also change their standard attacks depending on the orientation of the player, usually firing slower bullets and/or homing bullets when the player is a yōkai.|$|R

5|$|Early filters {{utilised}} {{the phenomenon}} of resonance to filter signals. Although electrical resonance had been investigated by researchers from a very early stage, it was at first not widely understood by electrical engineers. Consequently, the much more <b>familiar</b> concept of acoustic resonance (which in turn, can be {{explained in terms of}} the even more <b>familiar</b> mechanical resonance) found its way into filter design ahead of electrical resonance. Resonance can be used to achieve a filtering effect because the resonant device will respond to frequencies at, or near, to the resonant frequency but will not respond to frequencies far from resonance. Hence frequencies far from resonance are filtered out from the output of the device.|$|E
