40|$|The {{objective}} of the research {{was to determine the}} best N nutrient management for isoflavone content in three soybean cultivars under dry land conditions. Two experiments were experiment I (June to September 2012 growing season) and Experiment II (October to December 2012 growing season). Experimental design was a randomized block design with 2 factors and 3 replications. The first factor was soybean cultivars (Anjasmoro, Wilis, Sinabung). The second factor was N source, with Urea (50 kg/ha), Bradyrhizobium sp., farmyard manure (10 ton/ha), a combination of Bradyrhizobium sp. + farmyard manure (5 ton/ha) and <b>a</b> control with <b>no</b> <b>N.</b> <b>A</b> combined analysis of variance was done to evaluate the production and the content of isoflavone in the two different growing seasons as affected by N source and cultivar. The parameters observed were the content of genistein, daidzein, glycitein and total isoflavone content. Results showed that the October to December growing season had higher genistein, daidzein, glycitein and total of isoflavones than the June to September growing season. The treatment cultivar Wilis plus Bradyrhizobium sp. grown at October to December growing season increased total isoflavone content more than other treatments.

40|$|Many {{ecosystems}} are facing strong perturbations such as nitrogen (N) fertilization, which can greatly alter ecosystem stability via different mechanisms. Understanding such mechanisms {{is critical for}} predicting how ecosystems will function {{in the face of}} global changes. We examined how 8 yr of N fertilization with different <b>N</b> rates (<b>no</b> <b>N</b> addition or <b>N</b> addition at <b>a</b> low, medium or high rate) and different forms of N (ammonium, nitrate or ammonium nitrate) affected the temporal stability of the aboveground biomass of an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau, and tested four mechanisms (diversity effect, mean-variance scaling, compensatory dynamics and dominance effect) that may alter stability. Compared with the control (<b>no</b> <b>N</b> addition), <b>a</b> high <b>N</b> rate did not affect the diversity effect, the mean-variance scaling or the dominance effect, but significantly decreased compensatory dynamics among species and functional groups, which contributed to the reduction in community stability of the alpine meadow.
