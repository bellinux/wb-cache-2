40|$|This article {{examines}} the developments in the monetary aggregates {{over the course of}} 1997 and their implications for future economic activity. The narrow aggregate, M 1, grew rapidly {{in the first half of}} 1997 but slowed somewhat during the second half of the year. Much of the strong growth in this aggregate over the last several years has been associated with a higher demand for transactions balances as interest rates declined and economic activity revived. There were some special factors at play, however, that are discussed in the article. The Bank expects some slowing in M 1 growth through 1998 and into 1999. This would be consistent with a trend of inflation within the inflation-control target range of 1 to 3 per cent over the next couple of years. Growth in the broad aggregate, M 2 +, continued to be distorted by the shift of savings out of <b>fixed-term</b> <b>deposits</b> into mutual funds. A broader aggregate that includes M 2 +, CSBs, and all mutual funds and thus provides a better estimate of broad money growth, grew at a moderate pace during 1997. The recent behaviour of the broad monetary aggregates continues to suggest that inflation will remain low in coming years. ...|$|E

Durch ein Netzwerk bestehend aus fuenf Niederlassungen bedient die UMU 16. 577 Kunden (70 % davon Frauen). Alle Klienten sind Sparer und 63 % Kreditnehmer. Seit Juli 2001, belaeuft sich der Kreditbestand auf eine Million USD und das Sparvermoegen auf ueber 400. 000 USD. 50 % des Portfolios liegen im Handel, 35 % in der Landwirtschaft, 12 % in den Dienstleistungen und 3 % in der Herstellung. Die Tilgungsrate liegt bei 98 % oder darueber. Welche Faktoren haben zu dieser Erfolgsgeschichte beigetragen? Die Autorin macht folgende Eckpunkte aus: (1) Lokale Initiative und Ausrichtung - UMU mobilisierte zunaechst lokales Kapital, anstatt von Spenden finanziert zu werden; (2) Synergien aus Kombination und Kollaboration, wofuer auf lokale und internationale Erfahrungen zurueckgegriffen wurde; (3) Laendliches Klientel, d. h. UMU fing in den laendlichen Gebieten an, in denen die Menschen wenig Zugang zu finanziellen Dienstleistungen hatten; (4) Diversifizierte Kundschaft; (5) Gruendliche Untersuchung der vorhandenen Praxis; (6) Flexibilitaet; (7) Taegliches System des 'Darlehen-Monitoring'; (8) Genderperspektive, die auf Geschlechtergleichheit abzielt und ueber eine rein {{quantitative}} Betrachtung hinausgeht. (ICDUebers) 'The Uganda Microfinance Union (UMU) {{has become}} one of Uganda's leading microfinance institutions. It began four years ago with a small equity loan of about US Dollar 30, 000 and has grown to US Dollar 1. 5 million in total assets. Through a network of five branches, UMU serves 16, 577 clients (70 % women), all of whom savers and 63 % are borrowers. As of July 2001, UMU's outstanding loan portfolio was US$ 1 million and savings were over US Dollar 400, 000. It is diversified: 50 % of its portfolio is in trade, 35 % in agriculture, 12 % in services, and 3 % in manufacturing. Its repayment rate has remained at 98 % or above. Its operational sustainability is 111 % and its financial selfsustainability 92 %. What factors have contributed to UMU's success? Local initiative and vision: UMU started {{with a small amount of}} local capital. Rather than remaining as a 'project' funded by donors, it was guided by a vision of becoming an institution that mobilized local resources, both savings and capital. Synergies from combinations and collaborations: UMUs' founders, a Ugandan and an American, grafted onto local experiences time-tested international microfinance practices, leveraging the best of each. Rural clientele: UMU began in rural areas where people had little access to financial services. It has expanded into peri-urban and urban areas, zeroing in on specific, underserved market niches. Most clients reside in the countryside. Diversified clientele: UMU believes that it is not simply the poorest of the poor who benefit from microfinance. UMU reaches out to a broader clientele of poor and not so poor, the larger group of 'the working poor,' both self-employed and employed. Sound practices: The founders identified sound practices that were working in Uganda. These include solidarity groups and individual lending. Flexibility: UMU listens to clients and remains flexible, adjusting its financial products within certain parameters. Loans can be used for any purpose. Repayment schedules are flexible based on clients' choice (weekly, biweekly, monthly). A client can start with savings first. Setting aside money in savings is voluntary; competitive interest rates help to promote fixed deposits. Daily loan monitoring reporting system: UMU monitors loans daily. Using a card system, officials collect information every day about borrowers who need to pay that day. At the end of the day, UMU knows who did not pay. Immediately, the branch notifies borrowers of their delinquency. Gender perspective of equity, not simply 'numbers' of participants: UMU believes women need financial services, particularly because they are responsible for the well-being of their families. However, this belief does not mean it ignores men, since they also need access to credit. At least 50 % of the members in solidarity groups must be women. In actual fact, seventy percent of the clients are women. Client-oriented research with CEEWA, a women's advocacy and research NGO, resulted in a new product, Kikalu, one that responds to the complaints of women clients that small loans did not permit them to improve their productive assets. UMU's evolution and expansion has been based on developing sound practices - listening to clients, testing and customizing new products, and developing policy and operational standards. Currently, UMU offers: loans: working capital, fixed asset, and salary earners' loans; savings accounts: savings passbooks and <b>fixed-term</b> <b>deposits</b> at competitive rates; access: five branches in four different districts. UMU's growth has been measured because management has been cautious. It is supported with loans from Suffice, USh 120 million, from the Stromme Foundation, USh 200 million, and from the BoU, USh 20 million, as well as by equity grants from USAID and NOVIB.
