25|$|At age of 78, in 1996, she was {{diagnosed}} with cancer. She had been working on building the semiconductor base {{in the southern part of}} China. When she {{was diagnosed}}, she asked, “Can someone <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>another</b> ten years? In ten years, I can definitely finish what I am doing and I can die with no regrets!” She wanted ten years to offset the ten years wasted in the Culture Revolution. At 1:00p.m. on March 4, 2003, Lanying died.|$|E
500|$|The video premiered on February 7, 2009 on CMT. The video commences with a close-ups of Swift's and Colletti's mouths as {{they speak}} via telephone. He begins, [...] "All I want is you. Do you love me?" [...] She affirms, and {{he asks for}} another chance. The video {{transitions}} to Swift sitting {{on the living room}} floor, next to a fireplace. She performs as she flashbacks to memories with Colletti. The two frolic on a brown couch and play with a deck of cards. The video then transitions to Swift and her friend having lunch at a restaurant, where Swift's friend informs her of Colletti's betrayal. The two converse and, then, Swift is seen walking on the streets during nighttime. She sees Colletti arriving at a house with groceries and, after staring at each other, a redheaded woman walks out of the house. In a panic, Swift runs away and the video transcends to the phone call, which commenced {{in the beginning of the}} video, with Colletti repeating, [...] "Will you <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>another</b> chance?" [...] A rapid flashback of cut-scenes is played and, after its conclusion, Swift denies his request, hangs up, and cries. Cut-scenes feature Swift and Colletti frolicking, Swift walking in the streets, and her sitting beside the fireplace. To date, the video has over 124 million views on YouTube.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{his success}} the {{previous}} summer, Hogg {{was considered a}} strong chance {{to play in the}} reunified Australian side along with Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson. He ensured his selection with 6–95 for South Australia against the touring West Indies. He was one of only four non-WSC players picked for the first test against the West Indies (the others were Dymock, Border and Hughes). Hogg said, [...] "I did pretty poorly in India, but that was in India, and this series is in Australia – so they've decided to <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>another</b> chance, which I'm very grateful for". He played in a ODI before the test against the West Indies.|$|E

6000|$|... "Very well," [...] I answered, cutting myself {{some more}} ham. [...] "Do you mind <b>giving</b> <b>me</b> <b>another</b> cup of tea, Miss Hamilton? It was so good!" ...|$|R
2500|$|Guan Yu {{claimed he}} had 30,000 troops. He {{selected}} 5,000 elite soldiers, headed to the upstream shallows located some 10 li away from Yiyang, and planned to cross the shallows at night. Lu Su held a discussion with his subordinates {{on how to deal}} with Guan Yu. At the time, Gan Ning had only 300 men under him and he told Lu Su, [...] "If you <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>another</b> 500 troops, I'll go to confront Guan Yu. I assure you that Guan Yu will not dare to cross the waters when he hears of my approach. But if he does, I'll capture him." [...] Lu Su then chose 1,000 troops and put them under Gan Ning's command. Gan Ning headed towards Guan Yu's position at night. As Gan Ning expected, Guan Yu did not cross the shallows and instead set up camps there. That place was thus named 'Guan Yu's Shallows' (關羽瀨).|$|E
60|$|SIR WILLIAM. [Genially] Can you <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>another</b> five minutes, Bill? [Pointing to the billiard-room] We'll come directly, my dear.|$|E
60|$|ATTEN. But pray now, {{before we}} {{conclude}} our discourse of Mr. Badman, <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>another</b> {{proof of his}} dying in his sins.|$|E
6000|$|... "I will!" [...] the {{boy said}} with {{extraordinary}} brightness and emphasis. He <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>another</b> look charged with that expression and then marched off alone into church.|$|R
6000|$|He <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>another</b> smile, sadder, fainter, {{sweeter than}} before, and said: [...] "When {{would you like}} to see me again, so I could work out this dollar?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well," [...] says he, [...] "we {{will talk}} of that after supper;" [...] so he rose up, <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>another</b> kiss, {{and took his}} horse for London.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Without presumption, sir, I {{feel that}} if you were to <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>another</b> chance I should work to your satisfaction. I should endeavour--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then if threats prove useless, {{you mean}} to bribe me to go! Very well. <b>Give</b> <b>me</b> <b>another</b> three months here, and I'll accept." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell that blackguard to <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>another</b> sniff of his {{restorative}} gas," [...] Julian begged. [...] "These shocks {{are almost}} too much for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When I saw that," [...] Tommy continued, brazenly, [...] "I bragged 'stead of repenting, and the wuss I says I am, she jest says, 'You little monster,' and <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>another</b> orange." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{looks that}} way. But {{you must not}} go away without <b>giving</b> <b>me</b> <b>another</b> chance to talk with you. Will you promise that?" [...] he demanded, abruptly, passionately. [...] "I have {{something}} to say to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>another</b> look, {{and this}} time ’er blue eyes seemed large and solemn. She walked along like one in a dream, and twice she tripped over the planks and would ’ave fallen if I hadn’t caught ’er round the waist.|$|R
6000|$|... "Get up!" [...] screamed the old dame at last, kicking him, [...] "or I {{shall make}} you <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>another</b> crock {{for a double}} night's rest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No time, if we hurry up. I've got {{six days}} before I rejoin, {{and perhaps the}} Chief will <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>another</b> week, if I tell him." ...|$|E
60|$|PRINCE PAUL (bowing very low). Sire, 'tis {{enough for}} me to have your confidence. (Aside.) I was afraid he was going to revenge himself and <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>another</b> decoration.|$|E
2500|$|Afterwards, Coppell said: [...] "I didn't {{feel too}} bad, as I {{appreciated}} {{being in the}} FA Cup final at all. It was only afterwards I realised {{it might have been}} the only chance I'd ever get. But the next season <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>another</b> go." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ever {{grateful}} for his success, Hedges, {{a man of}} humility, expressed his appreciation for the Caddo Parish School Board: [...] "They <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> {{the opportunity to be}} a head coach at a young age.

60|$|Q. Will you <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>another</b> sign?--A. Yes. He that indulgeth any one secret lust under a profession, is {{not like}} to deny himself in all things for Christ.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} {{not to be}} able to accept your invitation," [...] I said, as we walked {{together}} to the door. [...] "Perhaps you will <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>another</b> chance?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The old man's cheque {{for five}} hundred pounds!" [...] he said, holding it up. [...] "Mr. Treffry, <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>another,</b> and you shall {{have a third}} of the profits." ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{that point}} in the conversation, we were {{interrupted}} {{by the appearance of}} Betteredge with the tea-tray. He <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>another</b> significant look as he passed on into the sitting-room. [...] "Aye! aye! make your hay while the sun shines. The Tartar's upstairs, Mr. Jennings--the Tartar's upstairs!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And that <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>another</b> idea," [...] went on Larry. [...] "The hatch {{covering}} {{over the}} companionway {{belongs to the}} fore hatch. If we can reach that opening from here, why can't we steal on deck when we get the chance {{and try to make}} the mutineers prisoners?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... ‘Eh! Not me!’ {{answered}} the beggar. ‘It’s too long ago. But if you’ll <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>another</b> mug of your good ale, my pretty lady, I won’t {{say no to}} that.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I can't {{make out}} the two misses," [...] she complained. [...] "The gun worked beautifully, too. <b>Give</b> <b>me</b> <b>another</b> clip and I'll hit it eight times for {{anything}} you wish." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I was met at {{the station}} (called in America the depot) {{by a member of}} the Municipal Council driving his own motor car. After <b>giving</b> <b>me</b> an {{excellent}} cigar, he proceeded to drive me about the town, to various points of interest, including the municipal abattoir, where he <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>another</b> excellent cigar, the Carnegie public library, the First National Bank (the courteous manager of which <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> an excellent cigar) and the Second Congregational Church where I had the pleasure of meeting the pastor. The pastor, who appeared a man of breadth and culture, <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>another</b> cigar. In the evening a dinner, admirably cooked and excellently served, was tendered to me at a leading hotel." [...] And of course he took it. After which his statement that he carried away from the town a feeling of optimism explains itself: he had four cigars, the dinner, and half a page of impressions at twenty cents a word.|$|R
60|$|At {{last they}} were not more than two yards behind, {{and for the first}} time I twisted so that they {{overshot}} <b>me,</b> which <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>another</b> start.

60|$|Tom Hopkins weighs {{one hundred}} and ninety-eight. He <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>another</b> somnolent grin, and fell into deeper slumber.

Tom's {{breathing}} became stertorous, and that, in connection with morphia poisoning, means danger.|$|R
