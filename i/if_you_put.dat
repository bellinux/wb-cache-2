It was frustrating. I felt like you work hard {{to get in the}} studio to work with Beyoncé. [...] I was blessed... that song turned out [...] have nine lives.|$|E

500|$|Modern {{scientific}} sources {{report that}} the alleged phenomenon is not real. In 1995, Professor Douglas Melton, of the Harvard University Biology department, said, [...] "If you put a frog in boiling water, it won't jump out. It will die. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> it in cold water, it will jump before it gets hot—they don't sit still for you." [...] Dr. George R. Zug, curator of reptiles and amphibians at the National Museum of Natural History, also rejected the suggestion, saying that [...] "If a frog had a means of getting out, it certainly would get out." ...|$|E
500|$|Streep's mother, {{whom she}} has {{compared}} in both appearance and manner to Dame Judi Dench, strongly encouraged her daughter and instilled confidence in her from a very young age. Streep has said: [...] "She was a mentor because she said to me, 'Meryl, you're capable. You're so great.' She was saying, 'You {{can do whatever you}} put your mind to. If you're lazy, you're not going to get it done. But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> your mind to it, you can do anything.' And I believed her." [...] Although Streep was naturally more introverted than her mother, at times when she later needed an injection of confidence in adulthood, she would consult her mother, asking her for advice.|$|E

500|$|Bloomberg Businessweek {{acknowledged}} that daily fantasy contests are often {{won by a}} minority of skilled professional players, or [...] "sharks", who employ [...] "elaborate statistical modeling and automated tools that can manage hundreds of entries at once and identify the weakest opponents". A DFS player interviewed by Bloomberg argued that [...] "no matter how much somebody knows about sports, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> an established player up against a new player, that established player's {{probably going to have}} a 75 percent chance of winning—at least." [...] A study by McKinsey & Company over {{the first half of the}} 2015 MLB season estimated that 91% of winnings were won by only 1.3% of players. FanDuel CEO Nigel Eccles disputed the accuracy of the study, arguing that its daily fantasy baseball contests do not have as many participants as those it runs for football.|$|E
500|$|In his own words, Ocean {{calls the}} album [...] "nostalgic." [...] He explains, [...] "it's {{a longing for}} the past. That's what this record felt like." [...] The lyrical content, {{according}} to Ocean, relates to heartbreak and other familiar tropes of interpersonal relationships: [...] "I wasn't {{trying to make a}} record that people could relate to. I was just trying to make a record with the shit that I wanted to express. The shit that I wanted to get off my chest. [...] A lot of this record is influenced by one relationship, but I don't owe that whole project to one situation. It doesn't matter what the details of it are." [...] Discussing the writing process behind the album, he mused that he was just inspired to tell stories. He continued, [...] "you gotta make sure the listener is listening to you, so <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> it into a song, often times, if the song is striking enough, then you can really deliver the story most effectively while keeping the ear of the listener the whole time. I guess it all starts with the stories for me." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{video screens}} showed both live shoots and special footage {{directed}} by Robson. Cohen worked by Danny O'Brien at BCC Video to create double-sided custom video LED cubes that hanged above stage right. There were three larger-sized video screens above the stage area. The gyrating wheel in which Spears opened {{the show was}} made by Branam Enterprises and was attached to a platform also created by Tait Towers. 171 white light [...] were provided by Spectra. The giant music box from which Spears emerged in [...] "Born to Make You Happy" [...] (1999) was designed by Michael Cotton. Confetti was shot from machines provided by Pyrotek. Pyrotechnics were done by Gerb Fountains, whereas artificial snow was provided by Little Blizzard. During the encore performance of [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] (1998), there was a water screen {{in which it was}} poured nearly two tons of water pumped at 360 gallons a minute. Cohen said, [...] "The water screen is the keystone of the entire design because it impacts every system—electrics, staging, dancing. Rob discovered the company (Chameleon Productions of Orlando, Florida) that makes the screen, and I immediately looked at what they had in stock, which was a straight line. And I knew we didn't want a straight line. We wanted a circular water screen so we could physically build a shower for her to stand in the middle of and not get wet and then walk through when she wanted to. Of course, everyone thought I was crazy, so I suggested a six-sided shape. Everyone was concerned that the gaps between the sections might cause gaps in the actual sheets of water. But I kept saying that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> them 40' to 50' up in the air, gravity will cause the water to attach to itself, so you end up getting a solid sheet." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although Wilson {{found it}} {{necessary}} to clarify service roles and missions, he did not press for extensive further unification of the armed forces. He established in February 1956 an office of special assistant to the secretary of defense for guided missiles but made few other changes after implementation of Reorganization Plan No. 6 in 1953. When asked in 1957 about persistent demands for further unification, Wilson responded, [...] "It's an oversimplification in the false hope that you could thus wash out the problems <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> the people all in the same uniform and that then they wouldn't disagree over what should be done. Of course, they would." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{supposed}} {{behavior of}} frogs illustrating nonaction is {{told in the}} often-repeated story of the boiled frog: put a frog in boiling water and it will jump out, but put it in cold water and slowly heat it, {{and it will not}} notice the danger and will be boiled alive. The story was based on nineteenth century experiments in which frogs were shown to stay in heating water {{as long as it was}} heated very slowly. The validity of the experiments is however disputed. Professor Douglas Melton, Harvard University Biology Department, says: [...] "If you put a frog in boiling water, it won't jump out.
