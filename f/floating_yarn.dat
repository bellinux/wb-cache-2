Cross-over firmness factor (CFF) and <b>floating</b> <b>yarn</b> factor (FYF) have been recently proposed as parameters to understand weave effect on fabric properties (Morino, H., Matsudaira, M. and Furutani, M. (2005). Predicting Mechanical Properties and Hand Values from the Parameters of Weave Structures, Textile Research Journal, 75 (3) : 252 – 257). Redefined CFF and FYF factors using fabric fields in terms of interlacement index (I) and float index (F), respectively have been proposed in this article.

40|$|Abstract: Pilling is {{a serious}} {{problems}} in clothes, not only impairs its appearance but also reduces its service life. Several factors involved have been identified by some researchers. In this paper the combined effect of weave type and weave density on pilling has been studied. Worsted fabrics with plain, twill 2 / 1 and twill 2 / 2 weave patterns and different warp/weft density are subjected to abrasion test and pilling intensity is evaluated by counting the pills. It is shown that these two factors influence the total <b>floating</b> <b>yarn</b> length [L]. It is also shown that L has a considerable effect on pilling. An empirical equation is introduced relating the combined effect of weave type and fabric density to L. Also the effect of reduced ultimate bending stiffness on pilling has been tested by three kinds of low pilling polyester. ASTM D 4970 is used in this research. In this method for better displaying the results, instead of comparing the tested specimens with visual standards and evaluated degree of fabric pilling by scale ranging 5 to 1, the number of pills was counted. The results shows that the pilling decreased with increasing the yarn and fabric density however {{in order to preserve}} the products feature and properties, the use of modified polyester yarn are preferred which is also reducing the pilling...|$|E

Influence of fabric structure on preform properties relevant for resin transfer molding composite manufacture, such as compression, permeability, and tensile behavior were studied with respect to the interlacement and float indices. Tensile and compression tests were conducted on universal testing machine. Liquid permeability of these structures was evaluated based on horizontal wicking and contact angle wettability tests. Results show that influence of structural factor is greater on tensile and permeability properties than the compression properties of these multilayer fabricsThis work has been conducted within the Asia-Link Programme RPO 1736, project no IN/ASIA-LINK/ 002 (82158).

5000|$|Satin is a weave that {{typically}} has a glossy surface and a dull back. The satin weave {{is characterized by}} four or more fill or weft <b>yarns</b> <b>floating</b> over a warp yarn or vice versa, four warp <b>yarns</b> <b>floating</b> over a single weft <b>yarn.</b> <b>Floats</b> are missed interfacings, where the warp yarn lies {{on top of the}} weft in a warp-faced satin and where the weft yarn lies on top of the warp yarns in weft-faced satins. These floats explain the even sheen, as unlike in other weaves, the light reflecting is not scattered as much by the fibres, which have fewer tucks. Satin is usually a warp-faced weaving technique in which warp yarns are [...] "floated" [...] over weft yarns, although there are also weft-faced satins. If a fabric is formed with a satin weave using filament fibres such as silk, nylon, or polyester, the corresponding fabric is termed a satin, although some definitions insist that the fabric be made from silk. If the yarns used are short-staple yarns such as cotton, the fabric formed is considered a sateen.|$|R
40|$|In this study, air {{permeability}} of woven fabrics is predicted from {{the parameters of}} weave structures. Air permeability is an important property of fabrics and has a decisive influence on the utilisation of fabric for some technical and clothing applications. There {{is no doubt that}} predetermination of the {{air permeability}} in woven fabric is vital, and modelling the ef-fective parameters shows the role of the factors as well as the prediction of the property. To promote the design of woven fabrics, we can define the crossing over firmness factor (CFF) and <b>floating</b> <b>yarn</b> factor (FYF) as the parameters of the weave structures for predicting air permeability values. All the parameters are related to air permeability. Multiple regression equations of air permeability are derived from those parameters of weave structures and the values predicted almost exactly agree with the values measured from the FAST system. Key words: air permeability, weave structure, woven fabric. Undoubtedly, predetermination of the air permeability in woven fabric is vital, and modelling the effective parameters shows the role of the factors as well as the pre-diction of the property. Therefore, many efforts have been made to model wo-ven fabric air permeability. The primary model to analyse fabric air permeability is given by Robertson [8]. He considered a wire mesh as a simplified model of a fabric and each pore space between the cross-over of the warp and weft to be a nozzle with an equal discharge coeffi-cient. His work was continued by Hoern-er [9], who used wire mesh for his model too, assumed that the wire mesh and a screen fabric both behave similarly under the same conditions and argues that the pressure drop is due to friction between the air and contact surface area of the me-dium, {{as well as to the}} speed of flow. Ac-tually he believed that the airflow through a fabric is similar to that through a tube, but with the effect of a greater aspect ra-tio. As a result his model was simple but not accurate enough.

The {{resistance of}} forest grown CNT yarn and super acid solution spun CNT fiber decreased monotonically with temperature at a rate similar to amorphous carbon. The impedance of all three materials was also measured to 30 MHz. All three materials followed a series resistor inductor circuit, without any resistance decrease as others have found.

40|$|The fabric {{weave pattern}} {{recognition}} {{process is a}} structure identification process that detects the yarn location {{as well as the}} yarn crossing structure in a woven fabric. A new local orientation feature is proposed for fabric structure detection by using high-resolution images. The detection process consists of two main steps. Firstly, the yarn location is detected through a series of image enhancement techniques and an edge-based projection method. Secondly, the <b>yarn</b> <b>float</b> is recognized with a local orientation detection approach based on Radon transform. Three kinds of yarn-dyed cotton fabrics are investigated in this study, including the single yarn, the double yarn, and the twisted yarn fabric.

30|$|This study {{facilitates}} {{an effective}} design {{and development of}} various high stretch compression products by analyzing fabric size, stretch properties, and clothing pressure for various knit structures. Four types of fabrics were knitted with polyester SCY (Single Covered Yarn). Then fabric size including weight and thickness, stretch properties (stretch, elastic recovery), and clothing pressure were then measured, to analyze their interrelation. A comparison of fabric size indicated that <b>yarn</b> <b>floating</b> caused reduction in both course and wale-wise specimens; in addition, yarn overlapping caused a release in course-wise and shrinkage in wale–wise due to tuck. The high density caused by shrinkage in the course-wise due to <b>yarn</b> <b>floating</b> rather than overlapping influenced the weight and thickness of knitted fabrics. <b>Yarn</b> <b>floating</b> reduced course-wise elasticity and increased wale-wise elasticity in the fabric stretch test; however, yarn overlapping reduced elasticity in both directions. The elastic recovery analysis indicated that the recovery value gap among four specimens decreased over time. In comparison clothing pressure, ‘plain-float’ fabric showed higher clothing pressure than ‘plain’, while the pressure value of ‘plain-tuck’ was similar to ‘plain’. Dimensional change in course-wise had a greater effect on clothing pressure than in wale-wise in the correlation among fabric size, stretch properties and clothing pressure. Weight and thickness change exerted a strong influence on clothing pressure which vertically presses down the body. The clothing pressure value of knitted specimen having a lower stretch ratio was higher in course-wise.|$|R

40|$|Honeycomb {{woven fabric}} {{is a single}} layer of fabric exhibiting {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) cellular shape on both fabric sides due to the combination of periodic straight <b>yarn</b> <b>floats</b> and partial plain weave. In a fabric weave repeat, the triangle shape of increased <b>yarn</b> <b>floats</b> and crossed diagonal woven lines form two inverted pyramidal spaces on the fabric surfaces and a closed internal space. This particular 3 D architecture is bound to influence the fabric transfer and mechanical properties. This study investigated these properties for honeycomb weaves experimentally, including air resistance, thermal conductivity, water absorption and vapor transmission rate, bending rigidity, compressional energy and tensile behavior. The typical two-dimensional plain woven fabrics with the same yarns and density were set as references and elastic yarns were considered as a factor of effect on the fabric properties. The measurements by the Kawabata Evaluation System and Instron machine show that the honeycomb woven fabric has enhanced air permeability and water absorption, as well as lower thermal conductivity {{compared to that of}} the plain woven fabric. Higher bending rigidity, compressional energy and Young’s modulus are also observed for honeycomb fabrics. The mechanical properties are found to be affected significantly by applying the elastic yarns to the honeycomb woven fabrics. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} {{innovative}} lightweight materials are rapidly {{increased in the}} recent years, owing to their cost-effective, high-strength, environmentally-sound use of materials and process technologies, {{in addition to that}} they reduce the weight of a product. The characteristics of 3 D-spacer fabrics {{as one of the most}} important lightweight materials in future are multifaceted not only owing to its extremely light materials, but also because of exceptionally high stiffness to weight ratio compared to other constructions. It is also one possible method for improving the properties of fabric-reinforced composites. It can enhance the through-the-thickness properties, such as shear strength, dimensional stability, damage, tolerance, and fracture toughness that are critical for many structural applications. Spacer fabric has been employed in high-technology applications because of its critical mechanical properties related to high tensile strength, tear strength and stiffness. Furthermore, its multidirectional structures allow with more reinforcement along the thickness direction leading to an increase in stiffness and strength properties. The fundamental aim of this thesis exists in the development of a new kind of woven spacer fabrics for the light weight composites materials, in an effort to weave spacer fabrics that can not be realized with the old technology which are mentioned above. Therefore, the work in brief focuses on two main goals: 1. Development of a new kind of spacer fabrics for composites in the lightweight constructions. 2. Development of special devices of a narrow weaving machine for standing the process of the new kind of spacer fabrics production. The slippage strength test had to be carried out for the <b>floated</b> warp <b>yarns</b> through the ground fabrics by using different elements of woven fabric structures variables represented in different fabric constructions, different weft densities and different repeats of constructions by using different materials. The importance of this test related to the backward-movement of the <b>floated</b> warp <b>yarns</b> which is the crucial stage in the weaving process of spacer fabrics during the backward-movement. The results of this test determine the required forces for the backward-movement, on the other side it is the best method to observe the behavior of structure elements during the backward movement. The results of the slippage strength had been statistically analyzed, and the weaving process for the spacer fabrics had been achieved. It was concluded that the best properties for the woven spacer fabrics and the optimum case for the weaving process on the test weaving machine had been achieved when the following items are realized: Development of the narrow weaving machine is closed in assisting operations, let-off and take-up and enhancement for take-up processes. Extra let-off and take-up devices must be constructed at the weaving machine. Extra let-off device has to be used for controlling the <b>floated</b> warp <b>yarns</b> of ground fabrics. On the other side, extra take-up and the developed take-up devices have to be used for controlling the woven spacer fabrics. The experimental results give fundamental knowledges for the next steps in research and development of woven spacer fabrics made of high-performance yarns on the wide weaving machine. Die Ziele der Arbeit bestanden in der Entwicklung der Geometrie der Spacer Fabrics und der notwendigen Falteneinrichtung an der Bandwebmaschine. Spacer Fabrics werden ausschließlich aus zwei Deckflächen, die durch eingewebte Stege verbunden sind, gefertigt. Zur Entwicklung der Spacer Fabrics muss eine Doppelnadel-Bandwebmaschine mit zwei Webfächern eingesetzt werden. Für die Faltenwebeinrichtung werden der entwickelte Extra-Kettablass und der Extra-Abzug benötigt. Der Antrieb und die Steuerung des Extra-Abzuges erfolgen durch einen Synchronantrieb und der Antrieb und die Steuerung des Extra-Ablasses durch Pneumatik. Eine frei programmierbare Steuerung der Faltenwebeinrichtung ermöglicht eine sichere und optimierte Synchronisation zwischen Webprozess und Faltenbildung. Im Ergebnis einer systematischen Strukturentwicklung von Spacer Fabrics und der Simulation ihrer günstigen Herstellung mittles eines speziell entwickelten Slippage Strength Tests werden die optimalen Strukturen ermittelt.

Even though new materials are being used, traditional symbols are maintained and transmitted to younger generations. [...] However, the production of goods for commercial markets has caused a certain amount of controversy. One question concerns the “authenticity” of the yarn and bead art given the current forms’ modern origins. One person to do this was Fernando Benítez, who was particularly disturbed by the depiction of the dead as <b>floating</b> heads in <b>yarn</b> paintings; something he said was not traditionally Huichol.

However, some items of Huichol items can be deemed non-traditional or borderline traditional, such as the production of Christmas tree decorations, masks of the sun and moon, the use of the jaguar (a Mesoamerican symbol) and the incorporation of modern images such as airplanes and modern buildings into designs. Selling of the items has not been easy for the Huichol either, with limited outlets such as tourist venues, especially Puerto Vallarta, Guadalajara and San Miguel de Allende as well as sales to middlemen who can earn much more from the works than they can.(CRUruibe) ...|$|R
