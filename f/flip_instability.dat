40|$|International audienceTwo {{nonlinear}} regimes, {{depending on}} the magnetic Prandtl number Prm, are identified for magnetic islands described by resistive MHD equations. The frontier between these two regimes is sharp, and has {{the characteristics of a}} phase transition controlled by plasma viscosity. In the low Prm regime, a new form of the so-called <b>flip</b> <b>instability,</b> consisting of a sudden change of the island phase, is identified. Already known {{in the context of a}} forcing by external magnetic perturbations and localized current drive, it occurs spontaneously at low Prm. The main characteristics of this new structural instability are described. The low Prm regime is well described by the slab visco-resistive model in the linear phase, and is characterized by both a large saturation of the island and strong nonlinearly driven zonal flows (that do not impact significantly the island dynamics however), while curvature physics strongly impacts the viscous regime...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In this paper, {{machine tool}} chatter arising in an {{interrupted}} turning process is investigated {{in a strong}} indus-trial context with a complex flexible part. A {{detailed analysis of the}} real cutting process is performed with special respect to the geometrical defects of the part in order to highlight the source of machine tool vibrations. The analysis is completed by simple models to estimate the forced vibrations in interrupted turning, the gyroscopic effect, and the mode cou-pling using a new simplified formulation. Then, a new dy-namical model with interrupted cutting and geometrical inac-curacies—runout and orientation of eccentricity—is present-ed. Stability analysis of this model is performed by the semi-discretization method, an improved technique for analyzing delay-differential equations. The use of all these models on a given machining configuration allows comparing several vi-bration mechanisms. Thus, behavior’s specificities are highlighted, especially the influence of eccentricity runout on stability. A sensitivity analysis shows the effect of the value and the orientation of the geometrical defects for low speed conditions. Then this result are extrapolated to high-speed conditions to look for possible new stable cutting conditions and shows a period doubling <b>flip</b> <b>instability,</b> never described before in turning operations. The main focus of this paper is developing and exploring a stability model for interrupted cutting in turning with geometrical defects. The complexity of the industrial context led to methodically compare different chatter and vibration mechanisms; this approach can be gen-eralized to other industrial contexts...|$|E
40|$|The FLIP (Fluid-Implicit-Particle) method uses fully Lagrangian {{particles}} {{to eliminate}} convective transport, the largest sourceof computational diffusion in calculations of fluid flow. FLIP is an adaptation to fluids of the implicit moment method for simulating plasmas, in which particles carry everything necessary {{to describe the}} fluid. Using the particle data, Lagrangian moment equations are solved on a grid. The solutions are then used to advance the particle variables from time step to time step. An adaptive grid and implicit time differencing extend the method to multiple time and space scale flows. Aspects of FLIP’s properties are illustrated by modeling of a confined eddy, a Rayleigh-Taylor, an unstable subsonic stream, and a supersonic jet. The results demonstrate <b>FLIP’s</b> <b>instability</b> applicability to hydrodynamic stability problems where low dissipation is crucial to correct modeling. 1. Introduction mass weighted transport of momentum and energy, which is usually used, is diffusive. The as-The particle-in-cell method (PlC) was once the sigmnent of grid quantities to the particles and only method able to describe highly distorted flow back causes diffusion in momentum and energy. {{in two or three}} dimensions, for which it received “Full-particle ” methods like FLIP [8] and PA...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{directional}} factor {{has been used}} from a long time ago. The analysis of its evolution for different feed directions in milling processes provides {{a good way of}} selecting the best cutting conditions. For very stable cutting directions, corresponding to very low directional factors, the single frequency analysis gives unacceptable results, and multifrequency, or alternative solutions as semidiscretization, must be used. It is found also that the period doubling lobes extend at both sides of the tooth pass frequency equivalent to twice the natural frequency. In these cases, helix angle has a very important effect on the stability. For end milling processes, where the mill axial pitch can be of the order of the limit depth, a very stable situation is found except in those areas corresponding to <b>flip</b> doubling, where <b>instability</b> islands are found.

30|$|The {{ecological}} resilience {{focuses on the}} persistency, change and unpredictability, the core idea celebrated by biologists with an evolutionary perspective and by those who search for “safe-fail” designs (Holling 1996). It is a dynamic model that focuses on persistence despite changes in, and unpredictability of, a system’s properties (King 2008). It assumes multiple stability domains and {{is measured by the}} magnitude of disturbance that can be absorbed before <b>instabilities</b> <b>flip</b> into another regime of behavior (Sakurai et al. 2012). In other words, {{ecological resilience}} is the measure of the ability of the system to absorb changes of state variables, driving variables, and parameters (Holling 1973). The ecological resilience model is therefore grounded in constructivist tradition, both epistemologically and ontologically (King 2008). This definition and model is appropriate for analyzing food system that considers households as its sub-system. Due to the fact that food system is a cultural/social-ecological system, it is not a fixed system for which there is equilibrium steady state and for which resilience can assume efficiency, predictability and constancy. Such a system is characterized by persistency, change and unpredictability (Alinovi et al. 2008). Following this theory, some researchers have applied the ecological definition of resilience to analyze household resilience to food insecurity (Alinovi et al. 2009; Ciani 2012; Ferede and Muluneh 2015). In this paper too, we applied the ecological definition of resilience.|$|R
