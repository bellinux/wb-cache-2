50|$|Processive antitermination {{was first}} {{discovered}} in a bacteriophage, but examples have since been found in bacterial operons. The E. coli rrn operons are regulated by an antitermination mechanism that is dependent on sites that {{are closely related to}} lambda boxA and located promoter proximal to the 16S and 23S structural genes in each operon. The sequences of the rrn BOXA sites are more similar to the bacteriophage consensus than is that of lambda, and they bind NusB-S10 more efficiently. Although stem-loop structures analogous to BOXB are found promoter proximal to the BOXA sites, they are not essential for antitermination. An rrn BOXA sequence confers full antitermination activity against Rho-dependent but not against intrinsic terminators. BOXA also increases the rate of transcription elongation by RNAP. Point mutations in BOXA induce premature transcription termination. rrn antitermination requires NusB in vivo, as shown by a NusB depletion experiment. NusA stimulates the <b>elongation</b> <b>rate</b> of rrn RNA chains carrying BOXA. A role for NusA is further suggested by the observation that the nusA10 (Cs) mutation inhibits both antitermination and the rate of transcription elongation in an rrn operon. The role of other Nus factors in rrn regulation in vivo is not clear. In vitro, an antitermination complex that includes NusA, NusB, S10, and NusG forms at the BOXA sequence of rrnG, but these components are not sufficient for antitermination by themselves. An additional factor or factors that can be supplied by a cellular extract are required, but their identities are unknown.|$|E

Soil foraging was quantified by the volume enveloping the roots until a given uptake distance. Many simulated architectures were obtained by combining four different values for each parameter. The rate of soil colonization was mainly defined by individual root <b>elongation</b> <b>rates</b> and interbranch distances. Less intuitively, we showed that differentiation of <b>elongation</b> <b>rates</b> among the roots increased this colonization rate. Uptake efficiency – {{the ratio of the}} actual colonized volume to the volume of a unique cylinder with the same length and a radius corresponding to the uptake distance – declined with root system size. Nevertheless, large variations in efficiency existed among root systems for a given size, typically in a 4 - to 10 -fold range. Therefore, the ‘efficiency gain’ was defined as the deviation from the average trend in efficiency versus size. Between-root differentiation in <b>elongation</b> <b>rates</b> increased this gain.

The germination of 35 Queensland rainforest timber species {{and effectiveness of}} pre-germination treatments were studied. Five distinct patterns of germination are outlined and linked to fruiting season and geographic location. Twenty Queensland cabinet timber species seedlings were subsequently grown in three light regimes and two nutrient treatments. Growth and photosynthetic responses to light and nutrient treatments were examined. The {{quantity and quality of}} solar radiation were altered by the use of painted polyfilm in order to simulate natural rainforest light regimes. Growth responses were variable across treatments and between species. A factorial analysis of variance was conducted to evaluate the effects of light (high- 80 % full sunlight and R:FR 1. 01, low- 8 % full sunlight and R:FR 0. 63), nitrogen (control, added nitrogen) and successional status (early secondary, late secondary, climax). Under high light conditions the cabinet timber species significantly increased their total number of leaves, branching, rate of photosynthesis, transpiration and stomatal conductance. Under low light conditions a significant increase in internode length, single leaf area, leaf blade length, slenderness (height/diameter ratio) and relative crown depth was observed. The light treatments did not {{have a significant effect on}} stem <b>elongation</b> <b>rate,</b> relative stem <b>elongation</b> <b>rate</b> or total leaf area. The added nitrogen treatment produced a significant increase in stem <b>elongation</b> <b>rate,</b> relative stem <b>elongation</b> <b>rate,</b> internode length, single leaf area, total leaf area, leaf blade length and relative crown depth. Additional nitrogen did not have a significant effect on slenderness (height/diameter ratio), branching, rate of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance.

Low light conditions combined with added nitrogen significantly increased specific leaf area. Early secondary species exhibited the greatest stem <b>elongation</b> <b>rate,</b> relative stem <b>elongation</b> <b>rate,</b> diameter increment rate and relative diameter increment rate compared to late secondary and climax species.

Seasonal patterns in thallus density and size were determined, and the initiation, growth, reproduction, and shedding of modules were studied using a tagging approach. The effects of module density and module/thallus size on module initiation, growth, reproduction, and shedding were analyzed, and the occurrence of intraspecific competition among modules was examined. Seasonal variation occurred mainly at the modular level. There was a restricted period of new module formation in the cooler season, followed by fast growth and reproduction, massive shedding of modules {{from the end of}} the cooler season onward, and strongly reduced biomass in summer. There was no evidence of suppressed growth in small modules due to intraspecific competition. Module density and thallus/module size had opposite effects on <b>elongation</b> <b>rates.</b> High module densities enhanced maximum <b>elongation</b> <b>rates</b> (fastest-growing module per thallus), resulting in longer thalli. On the other hand, <b>elongation</b> <b>rates</b> decreased and tissue loss increased with increasing module length. Reproduction had no clear effect on <b>elongation</b> <b>rates,</b> indicating that there was no direct trade-off between reproduction and growth. The apparent size-dependence of reproduction was due to delayed fertility in young modules. Module initiation and shedding were independent of module density. Shedding was also independent of module size and reproductive status. We conclude that seasonal changes in the environment affect module initiation, growth, reproduction, and shedding, whereas density and size-dependent processes mainly affect growth rates...|$|R
40|$|To {{synthesize}} a protein, a ribosome {{moves along}} a messenger RNA (mRNA), reads it codon by codon, and {{takes up the}} corresponding ternary complexes which consist of aminoacylated transfer RNAs (aa-tRNAs), elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), and GTP. During this process of translation elongation, the ribosome proceeds with a codon-specific rate. Here, we present a general theoretical framework to calculate codon-specific <b>elongation</b> <b>rates</b> and error frequencies based on tRNA concentrations and codon usages. Our theory takes three important aspects of in-vivo translation elongation into account. First, non-cognate, near-cognate and cognate ternary complexes compete for the binding sites on the ribosomes. Second, the corresponding binding rates {{are determined by the}} concentrations of free ternary complexes, which must be distinguished from the total tRNA concentrations as measured in vivo. Third, for each tRNA species, the difference between total tRNA and ternary complex concentration depends on the codon usages of the corresponding cognate and near-cognate codons. Furthermore, we apply our theory to two alternative pathways for tRNA release from the ribosomal E site and show how the mechanism of tRNA release influences the concentrations of free ternary complexes and thus the codon-specific <b>elongation</b> <b>rates.</b> Using a recently introduced method to determine kinetic rates of in-vivo translation from in-vitro data, we compute <b>elongation</b> <b>rates</b> for all codons in Escherichia coli. We show that for some tRNA species only a few tRNA molecules are part of ternary complexes and, thus, available for the translating ribosomes.
