40|$|We derive the {{low-energy}} effective {{theory of}} gravity for a generalized Randall-Sundrum scenario, {{allowing for a}} third self-gravitating brane {{to live in the}} 5 D bulk spacetime. At zero order the 5 D spacetime is composed of two slices of anti-de Sitter spacetime, each with a different curvature scale, and the 5 D Weyl tensor vanishes. Two boundary branes are at the fixed points of the orbifold whereas the third brane is free to move in the bulk. At first order, the third brane breaks the otherwise continuous evolution of the projection of the Weyl tensor normal to the branes. We derive a <b>junction</b> <b>condition</b> for the projected Weyl tensor across the bulk brane, and combining this constraint with the <b>junction</b> <b>condition</b> for the extrinsic curvature tensor, allows us to derive the first-order field equations on the middle brane. The effective theory is a generalized Brans-Dicke theory with two scalar fields.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper the gauge-invariant {{formalism}} is developed for perturbations of the brane-world model in which our universe is realized as a boundary of a higher-dimensional spacetime. For the background model in which the bulk spacetime is (n+m) -dimensional and has the spatial symmetry corresponding to the isometry group of a n-dimensional maximally symmetric space, gauge-invariant equations are derived for perturbations of the bulk spacetime. Further for the case corresponding to the brane-world model in which m= 2 and the brane is a boundary invariant under the spatial symmetry in the unperturbed background, relations between the gauge-invariant variables describing the bulk perturbations and those for brane perturbations are derived from Israel's <b>junction</b> <b>condition</b> under the assumption of _ 2 symmetry.
