5000|$|Hindsight bias, {{also known}} as the knew-it-all-along effect or {{creeping}} determinism, is the inclination, after an event has occurred, to see the event as having been predictable, despite there having been little or no objective basis for predicting it. It is a multifaceted phenomenon that can affect different stages of designs, processes, contexts, and situations. Hindsight bias may cause memory distortion, where the recollection and reconstruction of content can lead to false theoretical outcomes. It has been suggested that the effect can cause extreme methodological problems while trying to analyze, understand, and <b>interpret</b> <b>results</b> in experimental studies. A basic example of the hindsight bias is when, after viewing the outcome of a potentially unforeseeable event, a person believes he or she [...] "knew it all along". Such examples are present in the writings of historians describing outcomes of battles, physicians recalling clinical trials, and in judicial systems trying to attribute responsibility and predictability of accidents.|$|E
50|$|Varying DUID {{laws have}} been passed over the last 15 years in {{response}} to both increasing roles of drug driving in road tolls, and the fact prosecutors have {{found it difficult to}} prove that a driver was impaired from using a controlled substance. Practical difficulties included the transient effects of some drugs wearing off before either police or doctors had a chance to assess many suspects for impairment, and also the expense of having to call expert forensic witnesses before courts to <b>interpret</b> <b>results</b> on a case by case basis. These laws can make their cases much easier to win if they only have to prove the presence of a controlled substance in the blood or urine, without a prescription. The logic in zero tolerance jurisdictions is that the trade off more efficient prosecutions of potentially impaired individuals is well worth the possible erroneous convictions of a lesser number of drivers who may not in fact be impaired, because the driver was already violating the law by using a controlled substance without a prescription.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{entitled}} Loss and Gain Technique Used in Interpreting Governor' Speeches in ''The Asean Workshop on Culture Heritage Tourism'' and ''The 6 th Regional Interfaith Dialogue''. It {{is aimed at}} finding out the loss and gain technique in the interpreting of two Governor' speeches by interpreter and evaluating which interpreter is able to use more accurate loss and gain technique in interpreting the speeches of Governor. Documentation method was used to collect the data by finding the recording, watching and transcribing the speeches and its <b>interpreting</b> <b>result</b> by listening and typing the Indonesian speech as the source language and English speech as the target language. The discussion began by identifying loss or gain technique used in two speeches based on McGuire's theory. Furthermore, identifying the accuracy of loss and gain technique used in the <b>interpreting</b> <b>result</b> by those interpreters based on Kopczynski's theory that is aimed to conclude which interpreter had a better accuracy in using loss and gain technique in interpreting the speeches of Governor. The result of analysis shows Interpreter X used 27 patterns (37, 5 %) of loss technique and 45 patterns (62, 5 %) of gain technique while Interpreter Y used 30 patterns (60 %) of loss technique and 20 patterns (40 %) of gain technique. Furthermore, there are 39 accurate pattern (54, 17 %) and 33 inaccurate pattern (45, 83 %) of 72 loss and gain pattern in the <b>interpreting</b> <b>result</b> of ''ASEAN Workshop on Cultural Heritage Tourism'' speech by Mr. X. On the other hand, the researcher found 31 accurate pattern (62 %) and 19 inaccurate pattern (38 %) of 50 loss and gain pattern in the <b>interpreting</b> <b>result</b> of ''The 6 th Regional Interfaith Dialogoue'' speech by Mr. Y. So, Interpreter Y is able to use more accurate loss and gain technique in interpreting the speech of Governor...|$|R
