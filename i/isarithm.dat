The word isogram ( [...] "writing or drawing") was proposed by Francis Galton in 1889 as a convenient generic designation for lines indicating equality of some physical condition or quantity; but it commonly refers to a word without a repeated letter.|$|E
5000|$|A {{contour line}} (also isoline, isopleth, or <b>isarithm)</b> of a {{function}} of two variables is a curve along which the function has a constant value, so that the curve joins points of equal value. It is a plane section of the three-dimensional graph of the function f(x, y) parallel to the x, y plane. In cartography, a contour line (often just called a [...] "contour") joins points of equal elevation (height) above a given level, such as mean sea level. A contour map is a map illustrated with contour lines, for example a topographic map, which thus shows valleys and hills, and the steepness or gentleness of slopes. [...] The contour interval of a contour map is the difference in elevation between successive contour lines.|$|E

Using the ICAMS (Image Characterization And Modeling System) software, we computed the fractal dimension values via the <b>isarithm</b> and triangular prism methods for all 224 bands in the two AVIRIS scenes. The resultant fractal dimensions reflect changes in image complexity across the spectral range of the hyperspectral images. Both the <b>isarithm</b> and triangular prism methods detect unusually high D values on the spectral bands that fall within the atmospheric absorption and scattering zones where signature to noise ratios are low. Fractal dimensions for the urban area resulted in higher values than for the rural landscape, and {{the differences between the}} resulting D values are more distinct in the visible bands. The triangular prism method is sensitive to a few random speckles in the images, leading to a lower dimensionality. On the contrary, the <b>isarithm</b> method will ignore the speckles and focus on the major variation dominating the surface, thus resulting in a higher dimension. It is seen where the fractal curves plotted for the entire bandwidth range of the hyperspectral images could be used to distinguish landscape types as well as for screening noisy bands...|$|E
40|$|Techniques for the review, display, and {{manipulation}} of multidimensional data are developed and described. Multidimensional data is meant {{in this context}} to describe scalar data associated with a three dimensional geometry or otherwise too complex to be well represented by traditional graphs. Raster graphics techniques are used to display a shaded image of a three dimensional geometry. The use of color to represent scalar data associated with the geometries in shaded images is explored. Distinct hues are associated with discrete data ranges, thus emulating the traditional representation of data with <b>isarithms,</b> or lines of constant numerical value. Data ranges are alternatively associated with a continuous spectrum of hues to show subtler data trends. The application of raster graphics techniques to the display of bivariate functions is explored...|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{increase}} in digital data volumes from new and existing sensors necessitates the need for efficient analytical tools for extracting information. We developed an integrated software package called ICAMS (Image Characterization and Modeling System) to provide specialized spatial analytical functions for interpreting remote sensing data. This paper evaluates the three fractal dimension measurement methods: <b>isarithm,</b> variogram, and triangular prism, along with the spatial autocorrelation measurement methods Moran's I and Geary's C, that have been implemented in ICAMS. A modified triangular prism method was proposed and implemented. Results from analyzing 25 simulated surfaces having known fractal dimensions show that both the <b>isarithm</b> and triangular prism methods can accurately measure a range of fractal surfaces. The triangular prism method is most accurate at estimating the fractal dimension of higher spatial complexity, but it is sensitive to contrast stretching. The variogram method is a comparatively poor estimator {{for all of the}} surfaces, particularly those with higher fractal dimensions. Similar to the fractal techniques, the spatial autocorrelation techniques are found to be useful to measure complex images but not images with low dimensionality. These fractal measurement methods can be applied directly to unclassified images and could serve as a tool for change detection and data mining...|$|E
40|$|The Environmental Restoration Project at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) {{has over}} 11, 000 {{sampling}} locations in a 44 square mile area. The sample analyses contain raw analytical chemistry values for over 2, 300 analytes and compounds {{used to define}} and remediate contaminated areas at LANL. The data consist of 2. 5 million records in an oracle database. Maps are often used to visualize the data. Problems arise when a client specifies {{a particular kind of}} map without fully understanding the limitations of the data or the map. The ability of maps to convey information is dependent on many factors, though all maps are data dependent. The quantity, spatial distribution, and numerical range of the data can limit use with certain kinds of maps. To address these issues and educate the clients, several types of statistical maps (e. g., choropleth, <b>isarithm,</b> and graduated symbol such as bubble and spike) used for environmental analysis were chosen to show the advantages, disadvantages, and data limitations of each. By examining both the complexity of the analytical data and the limitations of the map type, it is possible to consider how reality has been transformed through the map, and if that transformation accurately conveys the information present...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{interpolation}} and, {{more particularly}} isarlthm interpolation are common {{procedures in the}} Earth Sciences and increasingly common ones in most other disciplines. Data for such Interpolation are increasingly being stored in a computer-accessible form as a prerequisite to a computer-derived solution. This {{has resulted in the}} development of a large assortment of computer software to perform the interpolation. The scientist is thus faced with a predicament of which is the optimum method of isarlthm interpolation for his data- This thesis describes an empirical evaluation of the performances of a comprehensive selection of software in relation to data characteristics. Much of the software is available in the academic environment or was developed by the author. The evaluation utilises detailed, photogrammetrically derived digital terrain data which are related to some currently used data classification systems. Additionally, several techniques, mostly derived from geomorphometry, are used to examine the data in more depth, in an attempt to establish reliable descriptors of their data characteristics. These descriptors are designed to be used in a multi-disciplinary environment. The interpolation process is essentially classified into three stages for evaluation. Random-to-grid algorithms are evaluated by considering the interpolated grid in relation to an observed grid. Grid-to-isarithm and random-to-isarithm interpolation are evaluated by considering the interpolated Isarithms with observed isarithms. In both cases, geometric errors and the morphological trueness of the interpolation product are considered using graphical and numerical parameters. These statements of accuracy are correlated with the data characteristics to establish the main factors influencing <b>isarithm</b> interpolation...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE. This article uses {{geographic}} information systems and their related tools to empirically measure and display the geographic accessibility of the aged population to hospital facilities within Illinois. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SETTING. Geographic accessibility of Illinois' aged population is measured {{from each of}} the state's 10, 796 census block groups to the state's 214 hospital facilities. Block group demographic compositions and centroids are obtained from 1990 census files. Hospital coordinates are obtained by the authors. STUDY DESIGN. Of five alternative measures of accessibility considered, empirical estimates are obtained for two: choice set and minimum distance. Access to both general hospitals and the subset having specialized geriatric facilities is measured with special attention to differences in accessibility between the aged within metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) and those outside MSAs. Cumulative accessibility distributions and their summary statistics provide a basis of comparison among subgroups. DATA COLLECTION AND EXTRACTION. Geographic information systems (GIS) and their related tools are used as a means of efficiently capturing, organizing, storing, and retrieving the required data. Hospitals and census block groups are geocoded to specific locations in the database, and aspatial attributes are assigned to the hospitals and block groups. The GIS database is queried to produce shaded <b>isarithm</b> and point distribution maps that show the location of hospitals relative to surrounding aged populations. CONCLUSION. The vast majority of Illinois' aged population is within close proximity to hospital facilities. Eighty percent (1, 147, 504 persons) of the aged in Illinois are within 4. 8 miles (7. 7 km) of a hospital and 11. 6 miles (18. 7 km) of two hospitals. However, geographic accessibility differences between the aged living in MSAs and those living outside MSAs to hospitals offering geriatric services are substantial; but {{there is no evidence that}} the aged's geographical accessibility to hospitals is less favorable than that of the general population. Detailed accessibility measures permitted by {{geographic information}} system technology call into question the continued use of crude empirical accessibility measures...|$|E
