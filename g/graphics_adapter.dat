25|$|The Color <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (CGA), {{originally}} {{also called}} the Color/Graphics Adapter or IBM Color/Graphics Monitor Adapter, introduced in 1981, was IBM's first graphics card and first color display card for the IBM PC. For this reason, it also became that computer's first color computer display standard.|$|E
25|$|In 1986 Amstrad {{entered the}} IBM PC-compatible arena with the PC1512 system. In {{standard}} Amstrad livery and priced at £399 {{it was a}} success, capturing more than 25% of the European computer market. It was MS-DOS-based, but with the GEM graphics interface, and later Windows. In 1988 Amstrad attempted {{to make the first}} affordable portable personal computer with the PPC512 and 640 models, introduced a year before the Macintosh Portable. They ran MS-DOS on an 8MHz processor, and the built-in screen could emulate the Monochrome Display Adapter or Color <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter.</b> Amstrad's final (and ill-fated) attempts to exploit the Sinclair brand were based on the company's own PCs; a compact desktop PC derived from the PPC 512, branded as the Sinclair PC200, and the PC1512 rebadged as the Sinclair PC500.|$|E

500|$|Bart's House of Weirdness was {{developed}} by Distinctive Software and published by Konami. It was announced by Konami at the June 1991 International Summer Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago. The game was released in 1992 solely for the DOS platform, and was available for both Color <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (CGA) and Enhanced <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (EGA), but not Video Graphics Array (VGA). Writers for UGO Networks have commented {{that the fact that}} Bart's House of Weirdness was released exclusively for DOS [...] "more than likely tells why its critical acclaim is zilch and fan support non-existent. It's surprising it got such a limited release, seeing it was published by Konami, who usually have no problem distributing games on a variety of platforms." [...] Similarly, a 1UP.com editor wrote that the game is [...] "unknown (there's not even a single video of it on YouTube)" [...] and that it [...] "deserves a little more coverage, if only to acknowledge its existence".|$|E
500|$|Three {{reviewers for}} Computer Gaming World had {{conflicting}} reactions. Ken St. Andre—designer of the Tunnels & Trolls RPG—approved {{of the game}} despite his dislike of the D system, praising the art, the mixture of combat and puzzles, and surprises. He concluded, [...] "take it from a 'rival' designer, Pool of Radiance has my recommendation for every computer fantasy role-playing gamer". Tracie Forman Hicks, however, stated that over-faithful use of the D system left it behind others like Ultima and Wizardry. She also disliked the game's puzzles and lengthy combat sequences. Scorpia also disliked the amount of fighting in a game she otherwise described as a [...] "well-designed slicer/dicer", concluding that [...] "patience (possibly of Job) [...] required {{to get through this}} one". Shay Addams from Compute! stated that experienced role-playing gamers [...] "won't find anything new here", but recommended it to those who [...] "love dungeons, dragons, and drama". In their March 1989 [...] "The Role of Computers" [...] column in Dragon magazine #143, Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser (often called [...] "The Lessers") gave Pool of Radiance a three-page review. The reviewers praised Pool of Radiance as [...] "the first offering that truly follows AD game rules", calling it a [...] "great fantasy role-playing game" [...] that [...] "falls into the must-buy category for avid AD game players". The reviewers advised readers to [...] "rush out to your local dealer and buy Pool Of Radiance". They considered it SSI's flagship product, speculating that it would [...] "undoubtedly bring thousands of computer enthusiasts into the adventure-filled worlds of TSR". The Dragon reviewers criticized the [...] "notoriously slow" [...] technology of the C64/128 system but added that the C64/128 version would become nearly unplayable without a software-based fastloader utility which Strategic Simulations integrated into the game. Conversely, the reviewers felt that the MS-DOS version was extremely fast, so much so that they had to slow the game operation down in order to read all the on-screen messages. They found that the MS-DOS version played at twice the speed of the C64/128 version when using the Enhanced <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (EGA) graphics mode.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{personal}} computers {{of the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, such as those from Apple, Atari and Commodore, did not use RGB as their main method to manage colors, but rather composite video. [...] IBM introduced a 16-color scheme (four bits—one bit each for red, green, blue, and intensity) with the Color <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (CGA) for its first IBM PC (1981), later improved with the Enhanced <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (EGA) in 1984. The first manufacturer of a truecolor graphic card for PCs (the TARGA) was Truevision in 1987, {{but it was not}} until the arrival of the Video Graphics Array (VGA) in 1987 that RGB became popular, mainly due to the analog signals in the connection between the adapter and the monitor which allowed a very wide range of RGB colors. Actually, it had to wait a few more years because the original VGA cards were palette-driven just like EGA, although with more freedom than VGA, but because the VGA connectors were analogue, later variants of VGA (made by various manufacturers under the informal name Super VGA) eventually added truecolor. In 1992, magazines heavily advertised truecolor Super VGA hardware.|$|E

2500|$|When {{the first}} IBM PC was {{designed}} in 1980, it included a [...] "peseta symbol" [...] "Pts" [...] in the ROM of the Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA) and Color <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (CGA) video output cards' hardware, with the code number 158. This original character set chart {{later became the}} MS-DOS code page 437. [...] Some spreadsheet software for PC under MS-DOS, as Lotus 1-2-3, employed this character as the peseta symbol in their Spanish editions. [...] Subsequent international MS-DOS code pages, like code page 850 and others, deprecated this character in favour of some other national characters.|$|E
2500|$|Memory {{managers}} on 386-based systems (such as QEMM or MEMMAX (+V) in DR-DOS) {{could achieve}} the same effect, adding conventional memory at 640 KB and moving the barrier to 704 KB (up to segment B000, the start of MDA/HGC) or 736 KB (up to segment B800, {{the start of the}} CGA). [...] Only CGA could be used in this situation, because Enhanced <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (EGA) video memory was immediately adjacent to the conventional memory area below the 640 KB line; the same memory area could not be used both for the frame buffer of the video card and for transient programs.|$|E
2500|$|Like the IBM PC {{with the}} {{contemporary}} Color <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter,</b> the video {{output of the}} BBC Micro could be switched by software between a number of display modes. These varied between 20 and 40-column text suitable for a domestic TV, to 80-column text best viewed with a high-quality RGB-connected monitor (The 80-column mode was often too blurred to view when using a domestic TV via the UHF output). [...] The variety of modes offered applications a flexible compromise between colour depth, resolution and memory economy. In the first models, the OS and applications were left with the RAM {{left over from the}} display mode.|$|E

2500|$|The {{design of}} the {{original}} IBM PC placed the Color <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (CGA) memory map and other hardware in the 384 KB upper memory area (UMA). The need for more RAM grew faster than the needs of hardware to utilize the reserved addresses, which resulted in RAM eventually being mapped into these unused upper areas to utilize all available addressable space. This introduced a reserved [...] "hole" [...] (or several holes) into the set of addresses occupied by hardware {{that could be used}} for arbitrary data. Avoiding such a hole was difficult and ugly and not supported by DOS or most programs that could run on it. Later, space between the holes would be used as upper memory blocks (UMBs).|$|E
