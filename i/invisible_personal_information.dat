In the near future, we will enable to realize the {{ubiquitous}} computing environment, in which user's mobile terminal assists in their activity. In the ubiquitous computing environment, user's mobile terminal manages <b>personal</b> <b>information,</b> which is used for negotiations with a service provider. However, various privacy problems, such as information leakage cases, have happened, so that we desire to protect our <b>personal</b> <b>information.</b> We propose a framework for protecting <b>personal</b> <b>information.</b> A basic idea of the framework is to make use of <b>personal</b> <b>information</b> through a program which the owner of <b>personal</b> <b>information</b> knows the behaviour of. We call this program trusted program, because the owner of <b>personal</b> <b>information</b> can trust a way of <b>personal</b> <b>information</b> use.

However, if the e-mail is encrypted, it is completely impossible to check whether <b>personal</b> <b>information</b> is being improperly sent.

40|$|Abstract. In recent years, <b>personal</b> <b>information</b> {{matter that}} treat people’s daily life {{frequently}} happens, {{many studies have}} been done to deal with it from perspectives of legislation at national level. This paper identifies legal requirements for <b>personal</b> <b>information</b> protection under perspectives of information resources management at organizational level. 29 Chinese laws are identified that have legal requirements for <b>personal</b> <b>information</b> protection for Chinese public services. Studies show that there is an increasing number of legal requirements for <b>personal</b> <b>information</b> protection for key areas of public services. However, there is no independent and comprehensive law for <b>personal</b> <b>information</b> protection along life of information that covers entire processes of information resources management in Chinese legislation. There is a demand for developing comprehensive regime for <b>personal</b> <b>information</b> protection for Chinese public services. This paper suggests three aspects for consideration {{for the development of a}} comprehensive regime for <b>personal</b> <b>information</b> protection through information resources management for public services in China. Such suggestions can take the advantages of existed legal requirements for <b>personal</b> <b>information</b> protection as a complementary new whole for an effective regime to overcome existing barriers towards the development of a comprehensive regime for the protection of <b>personal</b> <b>information</b> for the Chinese public services...|$|R

This study investigates how social adjustment benefits (a type of psychological benefits based on human need for affiliation) can be used by Internet businesses to induce consumers to disclose their <b>personal</b> <b>information.</b> Drawing on psychology literature, this study focuses on the match between consumer characteristics (extraversion) and the media (electronic and traditional) used to offer social adjustment benefits. Results from a research experiment reveal that (1) consumers who are extraverts tend to be willing to disclose <b>personal</b> <b>information</b> when social adjustment benefits are offered via either traditional or electronic media and (2) consumers who are introverts tend to be willing to disclose <b>personal</b> <b>information</b> only when social adjustment benefits are offered via electronic media. Besides contributing to a theory on how Internet businesses can motivate consumers to disclose their <b>personal</b> <b>information</b> through psychological benefits, these results guide Internet businesses on how to more effectively induce consumers to disclose their <b>personal</b> <b>information...</b>|$|R

In Japan, societal criticism and possible a large amount of economic loss occur to the entity having leaked <b>personal</b> <b>information,</b> but not so much against data broker purchasing the leaked information or entity buying it from them. To strengthen the restriction against the latter, the 2015 amendment of Act on the Protection of <b>Personal</b> <b>Information</b> (APIP) introduced the traceability and the on-site inspection authority by the <b>Personal</b> <b>Information</b> Protection Committee(PPC), but the authority can not conduct without clue that the <b>personal</b> <b>information</b> is in circulation.

Elaboration. Examination of the literature of information needs and information seeking behaviour leads to the formulation of five propositions that elaborate the concept of <b>personal,</b> anticipated <b>information</b> need. These propositions draw upon concepts such as uncertainty, predictability, sensitivity and the valuation of information sources. Conclusion.
