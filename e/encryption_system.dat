25|$|In public-key cryptosystems, {{the public}} key may be freely distributed, while its paired private key must remain secret. In a public-key <b>encryption</b> <b>system,</b> the public key {{is used for}} encryption, while the private or secret key is used for decryption. While Diffie and Hellman could not find such a system, they showed that public-key {{cryptography}} was indeed possible by presenting the Diffie–Hellman key exchange protocol, a solution that is now widely used in secure communications to allow two parties to secretly agree on a shared encryption key.|$|E

All subscription services except E4 and FilmFour went off-air on 1 May 2002 after the consortium collapsed, explained as being due to paying {{too much for the}} television rights for The Football League. However, the choice of 64QAM broadcast mode, the fact that at least 40% of homes would need new aerials to receive it, a high churn rate, an insecure hackable <b>encryption</b> <b>system,</b> the cost of having to provide free set-top boxes, and aggressive competition from BSkyB all contributed to ITV Digital's spiraling costs, before shareholders Granada and Carlton called a halt to the venture.|$|E
500|$|... have {{proposed}} an alternative <b>encryption</b> <b>system.</b> In their system, the encryption key determines the local rule for each cell of a one-dimensional cellular automaton. A second-order automaton {{based on that}} rule is run for several rounds on an input to transform it into an encrypted output. The reversibility property of the automaton ensures that any encrypted message can be decrypted by running the same system in reverse. In this system, keys must be kept secret, because the same key is used both for encryption and decryption.|$|E

500|$|... {{proposed}} using multidimensional reversible cellular automata as an <b>encryption</b> <b>system.</b> In Kari's proposal, {{the cellular}} automaton rule {{would be the}} encryption key. Encryption would be performed by running the rule forward one step, and decryption would be performed by running it backward one step. Kari suggests that a system such as this {{may be used as}} a public-key cryptosystem. In principle, an attacker could not algorithmically determine the decryption key (the reverse rule) from a given encryption key (forward rule) because of the undecidability of testing reversibility, so the forward rule could be made public without compromising the security of the system. However, Kari did not specify which types of reversible cellular automaton should be used for such a system, or show how a cryptosystem using this approach would be able to generate encryption/decryption key pairs.|$|E
500|$|There {{are also}} {{concerns}} {{that despite the}} WPA/WPA2 encryption, hackers may {{still be able to}} steal other users' data, especially since the LinkNYC Wi-Fi network has millions of users. To reduce the risk of data theft, LinkNYC is deploying a better <b>encryption</b> <b>system</b> for devices that have Hotspot 2.0. Another concern is that hackers could affect the tablet itself by redirecting it to a malware site when users put in PII, or adding a keystroke logging program to the tablets. To protect against this, CityBridge places in [...] "a series of filters and proxies" [...] that prevents malware from being installed; ends a session when a tablet is detected communicating with a command-and-control server; and resets the entire kiosk after 15 seconds of inactivity. The USB ports have been configured so that they can only be used to charge devices. However, the USB ports are still susceptible to physical tampering with skimmers, which may lead to a user's device getting a malware infection while charging; this is prevented by the more than 30 anti-vandalism sensors on each Link.|$|E
