50|$|Magnetically coupled pumps, or {{magnetic}} drive pumps, vary {{from the traditional}} pumping style, as the motor is coupled to the pump by magnetic means rather than by a direct mechanical shaft. The pump works via a <b>drive</b> <b>magnet,</b> 'driving' the pump rotor, which is magnetically coupled to the primary shaft driven by the motor.7 They are often used where leakage of the fluid pumped poses a great risk (e.g., aggressive fluid in the chemical or nuclear industry, or electric shock - garden fountains). They have no direct connection between the motor shaft and the impeller, so no gland is needed. There is no risk of leakage, unless the casing is broken. Since the pump shaft is not supported by bearings outside the pump's housing, support inside the pump is provided by bushings. The pump size of a {{magnetic drive}} pumps can go from few Watts power to a giant 1MW.|$|E

Gears in the register convert the motion of the measuring element to the proper usage increment for display on the sweep hand and the odometer-style wheels. Many registers also have a leak detector.

40|$|Lecturepg. 55 A {{magnetically driven}} {{sealless}} chemical pump was developed that employs high torque rare-earth magnets. Utilizing a semiopen impeller configuration, the pump {{was designed to}} fit into the ANSI B 73. 1 standard dimensional envelope. This was done to simplify retrofitting the existing installed pump population or, in the case of new installations, the piping design; thus, standard existing NEMA motors, couplings, bedplates, pump impellers, and casings can be used. Through the use of a nonmetallic containment shell, eddy currents were eliminated, and the pump efficiency was within two points of that of a comparable conventional pump with a mechanical seal. A metallic containment shell was developed for the relatively small number of applications in which the non-metallic shell is not suitable. The implementation is discussed of the development program for this sealless pump, including the shell, the thrust bearing needed for the semiopen impeller and the encapsulation with both metallic and nonmetallic materials of the <b>driven</b> <b>magnets...</b>|$|R

40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) {{has become one}} of the major noninvasive diagnostic imaging tools today. The annual $ 5 -billion market <b>drives</b> <b>magnet</b> engineers to develop advanced and innovative, high-quality, low-cost, easy-to-operate MRI magnets. Because superconductors carry more than 100 times higher current density than copper, while generating no Joule heat, they are the only practical choice for diagnostic MRI magnets with field strengths above 1 T. A low-temperature superconductor of niobium titanium (NbTi) with a critical temperature of 9. 8 K stands out among other superconductors because of its excellent mechanical properties, adequate electromagnetic properties and low manufacturing cost. Since the MRI magnet became available in the 1970 s, most commercial superconducting MRI magnets have been of NbTi wire and operated in liquid helium bath at 4. 2 K. Nowadays, the sharply increasing price of helium has <b>driven</b> <b>magnet</b> designers to consider other superconductors with higher critical temperature for liquid-helium-free MRI magnets. Discovered in 2001, a new high-temperature superconductor of magnesium diboride (MgB₂) with a critical temperature of 39 K has spurred intensive R&D effort. A combination of high critical temperature, low manufacturing cost, and good in-field performance makes it viable competitor to NbTi and the basis for this thesis study. This dissertation, a result of the 0. 5 -T/ 240 -mm MgB₂ magnet project performed in the Magnet Technology Division of the Francis Bitter Magnet Laboratory, includes design, construction and operation details of the magnet. Each key component of the magnet, i. e., superconducting joint and persistent-current switch (PCS), was designed and tested to evaluate its performance. Each PCS was designed also to absorb energy when protecting the magnet; its protection performance, as well as switching function, was evaluated before deployed. Each finished coil module was tested separately before assembled to complete the magnet. The magnet was operated in persistent-mode in the temperature range 10 - 15 K. During operation, this liquid-helium-free magnet was immersed in a volume of solid nitrogen that provided a needed thermal mass to the magnet. Temporal and spatial field homogeneity are critical parameters of MRI magnets. Thus actual fields were measured and compared with the designed values to demonstrate its acceptability to MRI application. Operation also examined and validated a protection technique deployed for this magnet, as protection is one of the vital requirements of the superconducting magnet. by Jiayin Ling. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|Lecturepg. 93 Centrifugal pump design {{plays an}} {{essential}} role in the safe operation of any refinery or chemical processing plant. In analyzing the performance of centrifugal pumps, pump operating time to failure is almost always limited to that of the shaft mechanical seal. Mechanical seals and their sophisticated supporting systems have become more complicated as the pumping industry perseveres in its efforts to produce satisfactorily seal life. Numerous research projects have proceeded, many papers demonstrating seal leakage have been presented, but the overall progress in extending seal life has not been to everyone?s satisfaction. A viable and important option, therefore, is a centrifugal pump that does not require mechanical seals. A magnetically driven sealless pump is such a machine. It conveys liquid safely with no dynamic seal between the motor shaft and the impeller(s). There is no potential leakage path, since prime mover energy is transmitted magnetically through the pressure casing wall. <b>Magnet</b> <b>drive</b> pumps are capable of producing flow rates to 5000 gpm and heads to 1000 ft. Temperatures ranging from - 100 ?F to + 850 ?F, and system pressure to 5000 psi can be accommodated without the need for any ancillary services or supporting systems. Likewise, the <b>magnet</b> <b>drive</b> pump is excellent for high vacuum services where sealing mechanically may prove extremely difficult. Sealless pumps generally are thought to be intolerant of solids in pumpage. However, <b>magnet</b> <b>drive</b> pump designs are now available with substantially improved performance in abrasive services. The <b>magnet</b> <b>drive</b> centrifugal pump is simply a conventional centrifugal pump with an integral magnetic coupling imposed between the driver and the liquid end. This magnetic coupling replaces the seal chamber or stuffing box {{in such a way that}} the liquid end is made hermetic. The mechanical seal or packing is eliminated and the only seal is a stationary gasket or O-ring. The mechanical design features are outlined for the sealless <b>magnet</b> <b>drive</b> centrifugal pump along with the advantages and occasional limitations of this type of machine com-pared with mechanically sealed pumps. Particular reference is made to proven applications and to the significant increase in recent years in the efficiency of and power available in magnetic drives...|$|R
