25|$|The {{creation}} of Fliegerführer Atlantik gave Dönitz cause for optimism. It {{was not always}} easy, communicating and coordinating with air and sea forces. U-Boats were unable to make accurate navigation using sun or star sightings and even when convoys were located they had trouble homing in bombers because their short-range transmitters were too weak to reach the aircraft. However, they were strong enough to alter British defences. Harlinghausen was irritated when his aircraft communicated accurate locations and the U-Boats failed to respond. Only when he complained to the BdU did he learn from Donitz that the navy failed to inform the Luftwaffe {{that there were no}} U-Boats in the area to respond. There were errors in reports pertaining to location and course of convoys. By the end of March, 1941, attempts at close cooperation were abandoned in favour of more flexible approached. Dönitz noted in his war diary that enemy signals about German air attacks would allow his intelligence (B-Dienst) to locate the convoy. <b>He</b> <b>supposed</b> that this would offer a better chance of interception.|$|E

But the guard had spotted the down signals all off; thoroughly alarmed, he began running forward and shouting, and presently Lauderdale heard him and stopped. But it was too late then to do anything. The express was 200 yards away, coming 40 miles an hour. No. 139's crew cleared out and went over the wall, and the express went head on into 139. It was quite a bad smash. The guard and two passengers were killed. The fireman and another passenger died later. The driver escaped with severe bruising. There was very nearly another collision immediately after, for a Caley mineral from Lesmahagow was coming on the Down Goods line.

500|$|David {{took this}} advice, but, {{conscious}} of her inexperience as a writer, {{she kept her}} own prose short and quoted extensively from established authors whose views on the Mediterranean might carry more weight. In the published volume, the sections are linked by substantial extracts from works by writers including Norman Douglas, Lawrence Durrell, Gertrude Stein, D. H. Lawrence, Osbert Sitwell, Compton Mackenzie, Arnold Bennett, Henry James and Théophile Gautier. She submitted the revised typescript to John Lehmann, a publisher more associated with poetry than cookery, but he accepted it, agreeing to an advance payment of £100.

[...] His meeting in June 1603 with Robert Catesby, a religious zealot similarly unimpressed with the new royal dynasty, led the following year to his joining Catesby's conspiracy to kill the king and his ministers by blowing up the House of Lords with gunpowder. [...] Percy helped fund the group and secured the leases to certain properties in London, {{one of which was}} the undercroft directly beneath the House of Lords, in which the gunpowder was finally placed. [...] The conspirators also planned to instigate an uprising in the Midlands and to simultaneously kidnap James's daughter, Princess Elizabeth.

[...] They were married {{in the middle of}} the night of August 10, 1946 at Chestertown, Maryland after awakening a minister and roping in his wife and housekeeper to serve as witnesses. It was not until much later that Northrup discovered that Hubbard had never been divorced from his first wife, Margaret [...] "Polly" [...] Grubb; the marriage was bigamous. Ironically, the wedding took place only 30 miles from the town where Hubbard had married his first wife thirteen years previously. The wedding attracted criticism from L.

500|$|Killen {{has said}} that he has seen {{interesting}} theories about the finale's meaning.

He'd just been having two nightmares." [...] Killen said [...] "we actively fought against" [...] the idea that the series was Michael's dream; what seeing his wife and son together [...] "really represents is a further fracturing of his psyche". A second season, Killen said, would have explored the idea of Michael's wife and son both living but not (necessarily) a third reality. Another season also raised the possibility of Tara and Michael beginning a romantic relationship. Since the finale was written before the show's cancellation, it was written so either reality could have been the [...] "real" [...] one: [...] " [...] didn't intend to have that mystery sewn up in [...] ".|$|E
500|$|The {{discrepancies}} regarding Poison {{have been}} addressed {{more than once in}} interviews with former and current Capcom employees. Nishitani stated that <b>he</b> <b>supposed</b> the character [...] "could be male", but added it was up to the viewer to decide. He later clarified in a discussion on Twitter that in his personal view Poison was a woman. Street Fighter IVs producer Yoshinori Ono, when asked in an interview about the matter, stated: [...] "Let's set the record straight: In North America, Poison is officially a post-op transsexual woman. But in Japan, she simply tucks her business away to look female." [...] He later emphasized it again when asked about what female characters could be included in the game Street Fighter IV, stating that it would be too confusing to include her due to the region-specific gender. However, in a 2011 interview with Electronic Gaming Monthly at the Tokyo Game Show, he stated that Capcom [...] "doesn't have a stance technically", and while they wouldn't give an official answer, felt it was up to the viewer to decide. He added that his intent was to please all fans and that the mystery behind her gender was the core of the character. During the same interview, a Capcom representative further added that they worked closely with GLAAD, an organization concerned with the portrayal of LGBT people in media, to ensure [...] "anything that might be offensive has been very tailored to not be" [...] for Poison's portrayal in Street Fighter X Tekken.|$|E

[...] Superficially, they treated him with respect, removing their hats and addressing him as [...] "Mr Garnet", although they made fun of his relationship with Anne Vaux, claiming he was her lover, not her confessor. During his questioning he admitted some of his movements, and that he had received Catesby's letter on 6 November, but he denied being involved in the plot, whose members he did not name. [...] Garnet was convinced that his captors were interested only in the failed scheme and believed {{he might be able to}} clear his name, but the councillors also asked him about the doctrine of equivocation. [...] His own treatise on this topic, one of the [...] "heretical, treasonable and damnable books" [...] found amongst Francis Tresham's possessions, was laid on the council table before him. [...] Although it condemned lying, Garnet's treatise supported the notion that when questioned, for instance, on the presence of a priest in his house, a Catholic might [...] "securely in conscience" [...] answer [...] "No" [...] if he had a [...] "secret meaning reserved in his mind". [...] The occasions on which a Catholic might legitimately use equivocation, <b>he</b> <b>supposed,</b> were limited, but such replies could be taken as an example of insincerity or deviousness—especially to the king's council, who may not have wanted to see Garnet prove his case. [...] The council's view of equivocation was very different from Garnet's. [...] In their eyes, it was simple deceit.|$|E
500|$|The second option had European precedents, {{including}} Edward's own great-grandfather, Duke Alexander of Württemberg, {{but it had}} no {{parallel in}} British constitutional history.

William Lyon Mackenzie King (Prime Minister of Canada), Joseph Lyons (Prime Minister of Australia), and J. B. M. Hertzog (Prime Minister of South Africa) opposed options 1 and 2. Mackenzie King told Edward to do [...] "what he believed in his own heart was right" [...] and the Canadian government appealed to the King to put his duty before his feelings for Simpson. Governor General of Canada Lord Tweedsmuir told Buckingham Palace and Baldwin that Canadians held deep affection for the King, but also that Canadian public opinion would be outraged if Edward married a divorcee. Michael Joseph Savage (Prime Minister of New Zealand) rejected option 1 and thought that option 2 [...] "might be possible... if some solution along these lines {{were found to be}} practicable", but [...] "would be guided by the decision of the Home government". In communications with the British government, Éamon de Valera (President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State) remarked that as a Roman Catholic country, the Irish Free State did not recognise divorce. <b>He</b> <b>supposed</b> that if the British people would not accept Wallis Simpson then abdication was the only possible solution.
