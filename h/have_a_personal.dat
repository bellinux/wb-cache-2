5|$|Ecclesiastical {{heraldry}} {{refers to}} the use of heraldry within the Christian Church for dioceses and Christian clergy. Initially used to mark documents, ecclesiastical heraldry evolved as a system for identifying people and dioceses. It is most formalized within the Catholic Church, where most bishops, including the Pope, <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> coat of arms. Clergy in Anglican, Lutheran, Eastern Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches follow similar customs, as do institutions such as schools and dioceses.|$|E

5|$|A {{percentage}} {{of each group}} working in less contaminated areas was badged. Eventually, 18,875 film-badge dosimeters were issued to about 15% of the total work force. On {{the basis of this}} sampling, a theoretical total exposure was calculated for each person who did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> badge. As expected, exposures for target ship crewmen who reboarded their ships after Baker were higher than those for support ship crews. The hulls of support ships that entered the lagoon after Baker became so radioactive that sleeping quarters were moved toward the center of each ship. Of the total mass of radioactive particles scattered by each explosion, 85% was unfissioned plutonium which produces alpha radiation not detected by film badges or Geiger counters. There was no method of detecting plutonium in a timely fashion, and participants were not monitored for ingestion of it.|$|E

25|$|Evidence {{points to}} the {{negative}} impact of hegemonic masculinity on men's health-related behavior, with American men making 134.5million fewer physician visits per year than women. Men make 40.8 percent of all physician visits, including women's obstetric and gynecological visits. Twenty-five percent of men aged 45 to 60 do not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> physician, increasing their risk of death from heart disease. Men between 25 and 65 are four times more likely to die from cardiovascular disease than women, {{and are more likely to}} be diagnosed with a terminal illness because of their reluctance to see a doctor. Reasons cited for not seeing a physician include fear, denial, embarrassment, a dislike of situations out of their control and the belief that visiting a doctor is not worth the time or cost.|$|E

She is a shy and quiet girl who becomes the academy's top student as a 13-year-old and has not lost to anyone until Ayato {{challenges}} her a second time. Their first duel happens because Ayato stops her uncle Kouichiro from hitting her and challenges him to a duel. Kirin is his opponent and she uses her lightning speed to defeat him. She seems to be under Kouichiro's influence but her friendship with Ayato allows her to break free and Kirin eventually tells Kouichiro {{that she wants to}} decide things for herself from now on. Kirin enters the Phoenix to clear her father's name and release him. She does not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> lux but rather carries her katana called Senbakiri which often makes her greatly marveled by others as she tops the former top student position just by using a Senbakiri. She and Saya team up for the Phoenix tournament but they lose to Arlequint's Ardi and Rimsi in the semifinal. After Ayato's final match, she also attempts to vie for Ayato's attention by squeezing her chest on his head and declares she would make onigiri (rice balls) for him every day.|$|E

500|$|In 1856, Tucker {{completed}} his four-volume History of the United States, From Their Colonization to the End of the 26th Congress, in 1841. Robley Dunglison commented as follows on the work: [...] "To aid {{him in the}} execution of his work, as [...] himself remarks, it had been his good fortune to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> knowledge of many, who bore a conspicuous part in the Revolution, and of nearly all those who were the principal actors in the political dramas which succeeded. The history extends to the elevation of General William Henry Harrison to the Presidency in 1841, which {{is as far as}} Tucker thought he could prudently go." [...] The work includes a brief review of slavery, in which Tucker took issue with Jefferson's decades-old view in his Notes on the State of Virginia (1781), that slavery still had a degenerative effect upon slaveholders.|$|E
