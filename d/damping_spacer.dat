40|$|Abstract: This {{paper is}} mainly {{focused on the}} {{analysis}} of the subspan oscillation to bundled conductors. The mechanics of subspan oscillation were analyzed. Considering anti-adsorption conditions and the amplitude 1 imitations of sub-conductors, the calculating methods of largest subspan distance of bundle conductors were given. The mechanics of anti-subspan oscillation of spacer dampers was analyzed and a mechanical model of <b>damping</b> <b>spacer</b> damper was established. By calculating an engineering example, a real problem was calculated and evaluated, which was validated to be reasonable. Finally, a suit of calculation and simulation software was developed to facilitate the designers...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Galloping and ice shedding, two of {{significant}} dynamic damages to bundle conductors, are both typical three-degree-of-freedom vibrations, while few technique is studied on monitoring the torsion oscillation {{of the whole}} bundles and the sub-conductors. For the monitoring of the vertical, horizontal, and especially torsional oscillations, a novel type of <b>spacer</b> <b>damper</b> is developed, which can also detect the torsion motion of each sub-conductor, with consideration of the special configurations of bundle cables and integrated with fiber bragg grating sensors. Then, a distributed FBG network is introduced...|$|R
40|$|Effects of ice-shedding-induced cable {{vibration}} on spacer dampers are {{studied by}} applying a dynamic model. The model {{is based on}} the authors' recent development, which is improved here by applying spacer properties obtained experimentally. The model simulates cable vibration and bundle rotation at mid-span, where the spacer is attached to the cables, as well as the spacer deformation and forces acting on the spacer during the vibration of twin, triple and quad conductor bundles. Ice accumulation on a spacer may change the latter's elastic and damping properties, whose influence on the vibration is considered in the model together with the effect of varying cable properties. Simulation results show how the risk of bundle collapse and the load on the spacer is reduced when the number of subconductors in the bundle is increased. The model also predicts that the most important property which can reduce forces acting on the spacer during vibration is <b>spacer</b> <b>damping,</b> whereas the bundle rotation is affected to the greatest extent by cable damping...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The primary task of <b>spacer</b> <b>damper</b> is to {{maintain}} the geometry of conductor bundles, within the design limits, under the normal service conditions. It shall withstand the mechanical loads imposed during installation, maintenance and service, including short circuits, without failures and without damaging the conductors. The system is used in industry to test the conductivity and mechanical strength of the spacer dampers {{so that they can}} withstand the environmental and electrical conditions where they are used. This paper will present a damping technique for natural damper tester to test and calibrate the neoprene dampers. First, the body of the spacer will be fixed rigidly, a mass will be added to other arm such that the frequency of oscillations will be constant. The arm will be then held at one end and after one minute released. The movement of arm will be recorded for two complete cycles and the peaks of the graph are recorded. In order to make this system, the response of neoprene dampers to natural frequency will be observed and the log of their ratios will be calculated...|$|R
40|$|Wake-induced {{oscillations}} (WIO) in {{transmission line}} bundle conductors are simulated using finite-element nonlinear formulation. This allows obtaining the conductor oscillations {{in the line}} spans equipped either with spacers or with spacer dampers. Within this approach, the interaction of subconductors due to the wake is represented using Simpson’s aeroelastic model. A special force element is created to introduce the aerodynamic loads due to the wake. The aeroelastic properties of the wake force field are tuned to meet the wake-induced instability properties as measured by Price. Extension of the wake interaction sample onto the full line span is done {{taking into account the}} inertia-stiffness properties of the line fittings (spacer dampers). It is emphasized that in WIO the ability of <b>spacer</b> (<b>spacer</b> <b>damper)</b> to transfer the loads and motions plays essential role. Thus, the transfer matrix logic to simulate the spacer, established by Diana, Rawlins and other researchers, is now transferred into the finite element model of WIO. Some important structural specifics of transmission line fittings are thus highlighted by the performed simulations. All these developments are introduced into the FE package SAMCEF Mecano. Results of a series of calculations are presented to illustrate the feasibility of the established model. Comparison of FEM simulations to the benchmarking field test data is presented.

40|$|The {{vibration}} {{ring was}} {{conceived as a}} driveline damping device to prevent structure-borne noise in machines. It has {{the appearance of a}} metal ring, and can be installed between any two driveline components like an ordinary mechanical <b>spacer.</b> <b>Damping</b> is achieved using a ring-shaped piezoelectric stack that is poled in the axial direction and connected to an electrical shunt circuit. Surrounding the stack is a metal structure, called the compression cage, which squeezes the stack along its poled axis when excited by radial driveline forces. The stack in turn generates electrical energy, which is either dissipated or harvested using the shunt circuit. Removing energy from the system creates a net damping effect. The vibration ring is much stiffer than traditional damping devices, which allows it to be used in a driveline without disrupting normal operation. In phase 1 of this NASA Seedling Fund project, a combination of design and analysis was used to examine the feasibility of this concept. Several designs were evaluated using solid modeling, finite element analysis, and by creating prototype hardware. Then an analytical model representing the coupled electromechanical response was formulated in closed form. The model was exercised parametrically to examine the stiffness and loss factor spectra of the vibration ring, as well as simulate its damping effect {{in the context of a}} simplified driveline model. The results of this work showed that this is a viable mechanism for driveline damping, and provided several lessons for continued development...|$|R
