50|$|The {{second story}} {{the song is}} based on, {{involved}} a student that Vedder knew from his junior high school in San Diego, California. He elaborated further in a 1991 interview: I actually knew somebody in junior high school, in San Diego, California, that did the same thing, just about, didn't take his life but ended up shooting up an oceanography room. I remember being in the halls and hearing it and I had actually had altercations with this kid in the past. I {{was kind of a}} rebellious fifth-grader and I think we got in fights and stuff. So it's a bit about this kid named Jeremy and it's also a bit about a kid named Brian that I knew and I don't know...the song, I think it says a lot. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> somewhere...and a lot of people interpret it different ways and it's just been recently that I've been talking about the true meaning behind it and I hope no one's offended and believe me, I think of Jeremy when I sing it.|$|E
5000|$|I {{called it}} Gone Away Backward because it's {{a phrase from}} the Bible… I {{stumbled}} on the phrase later {{in the evolution of}} the record when I was looking around for a title. I think it's a nice piquant phrase that has three good, strong, mellifluous words in it. As far as the backwardness of the record, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> backward in terms of nostalgia for the past - bittersweet nostalgia for the past - as well as the recession having knocked everything backwards for people. In that sense, it's not an album about the past, it's an album about now.

5000|$|On television, Woodard guest-starred in two {{episodes of}} The Practice in 2003. For {{performance}} in show she has won her fourth Primetime Emmy Award. In 2005 {{she joined the}} cast of the ABC comedy-drama series, Desperate Housewives as Betty Applewhite, the new mystery housewife. The character is introduced in the last episodes of the series first season, and becomes {{the center of the}} mystery of the second season. The series creator Marc Cherry clarified: [...] "Theres nothing strategically black about her character. Her color is incidental." [...] Woodard stated that she had never seen the show before accepting the role, something that led the producers to send her fifteen episodes of the show, which she divided amongst various family members. After they compared storylines, Woodard recalled that she became [...] "instantly hooked" [...] on the series. As soon as Woodard accepted the role of Betty Applewhite, she reported experiencing heavy media attention. Woodards portrayal of Betty was praised and resulted in a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series in 2006. However, her mystery as a whole had mixed reviews. In a review of the second season premiere, Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly thought that the Applewhite mystery would help reduce the shows chances of falling into a sophomore slump. He praised Woodards acting as well as her characters storyline, opining, [...] "theres something so inherently warm and maternal in Woodards performance, such apple-pie wholesomeness, that it makes her touches of menace all the more chilling." [...] However, as the season progressed, there were many complaints about Bettys lack of interaction with the other housewives. She left the series in the second-season finale episode.Woodard was nominated for a Primetime Emmys for her roles in the television films The Water Is Wide, and Pictures of Hollis Woods (2007). She starred as lead in the Tyler Perrys drama film The Family That Preys in 2008. The film received mixed reviews from critics, but her performance received acclaim. Los Angeles Times critic Bob Baker said in review [...] "The film takes off when Woodards and Kathy Bates characters go on a Thelma & Louise-style road trip.", while The Washington Posts Neely Tucker wrote [...] "By far the best thing about the enterprise is Woodard. If shes not in this thing, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> kaput.". In next year she appeared in the independent drama American Violet, playing the mother of a 24-year-old African-American woman wrongfully swept up in a drug raid. She also starred in two short-lived television series: NBCs My Own Worst Enemy (2008), and CBSs Three Rivers (2009).|$|E

And that's a division that we already had in our minds before those first three albums were even finished. We already knew we were going somewhere else after Nattens madrigal.
