50|$|The {{interest}} sensitivity gap {{was one of}} the first techniques used in asset liability management to manage interest rate risk. The use of this technique was initiated in the middle 1970s in the United States when rising interest rates in 1975-1976 and again from 1979 onward triggered a banking crisis that later resulted in more than $1 trillion in losses when the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation were forced to liquidate hundreds of failed institutions who had typically lent for long maturities at fixed interest rates (such as 30 year fixed rate mortgages) and borrowed for much shorter maturities. The interest rate sensitivity gap classifies all assets, liabilities and off balance sheet transactions by <b>effective</b> <b>maturity</b> from an interest rate reset perspective. A thirty-year fixed rate mortgage would be classified as a 30-year instrument. A 15-year mortgage with a rate fixed only for the first year would be classified as a one-year instrument. The interest rate sensitivity gap compares the amount of assets and liabilities in each time period in the interest rate sensitivity gap table. This comparison gives an approximate view of the interest rate risk of the balance sheet being analyzed. The interest rate sensitivity gap is much less accurate than modern interest rate risk management technology where the impact of a change in the yield curve can be analyzed using the Heath-Jarrow-Morton framework based on the work of researchers such as John Hull, Alan White, Robert C. Merton, Robert A. Jarrow and many others.|$|E

Research method- The subjects came from a Coloured High School in one of the sub-economic areas in Johannesburg, namely Westbury. A biographic questionnaire was compiled to ascertain the needs of the subjects. The subjects were assigned to an experimental and control group. A second control group was also formed to minimalize test retest influences. The experimental group took part in an extensive career maturity enhancement programme and the first control group took part in a communication programme. The groups were compared according to the measure of the Crites Maturity Inventory (Attitude Scale). The programme made use of individual and group guidance as well as self-evaluation through the completion of assignments in the form of worksheets. The programme consisted of 12 sessions of 1 hour duration for three months. Results the major findings of the study were: the career education programme succeeded in bringing about a positive change in the attitudinal career maturity of the Westbury pupils; the attitudinal career maturity of the subjects in the present study compared unfavourably with that of other pupils in ordinary situations (not minority situations) and no difference was found between the end results of males and female with regard to their level of career maturity after completing the programme, unlike reported by other researchers.

40|$|Information and Communication Technology (ICT) plays {{a pivotal}} role in {{enabling}} organizational capability and productivity, and in initiating and facilitating innovation across all industry sectors. In recent years, cloud computing has emerged as a growing trend because it serves as an enabler of scalable, flexible and powerful computing. Consequently, each year significant global investment is made in migrating to the cloud environment. However, despite its growing popularity, several risks and security concerns surround the cloud computing model. Therefore, understanding an organization’s readiness and ability to mitigate associated risks is critical prior to embarking on the cloud computing journey. One approach to determining an organization’s ability to effectively migrate to the cloud is to determine the current maturity of both its cloud computing capabilities and its risk management capabilities.

Therefore, the objective was to develop a suitable process for the thermal inactivation of quality-affecting enzymes for lupin (Lupinus angustifolius cv. Boregine) seeds and de-oiled flakes. After monitoring the specific activities of lipoxygenase (LOX), peroxidase (POD) and lipase during seed maturation, LOX was selected as the most appropriate indicator enzyme to assess inactivation as lipase and POD activities extensively declined at full <b>maturity.</b> <b>Effective</b> reduction of LOX activity was achieved by various hydrothermal treatments at 70 – 100 °C for up to 30 min and 100 % relative humidity.

40|$|We study {{a simple}} model of {{liquidity}} risk management {{in which a}} firm is subject to rollover risk. When a firm is unable to rollover its maturing bonds by issuing new bonds, it may have to seek more expensive sources of financing or even liquidate its assets, possibly at fire-sale prices. One way to reduce this risk is to hold excess cash reserves, which can be expensive in practice (Bengt Holmström and Jean Tirole 2000; 2001). In this paper, we focus on an alternative way of managing liquidity risk, through the optimal (dynamic) choice of the maturity structure of debt. Our analysis highlights one advantage of short-term financing. The firm, while in good financial health, can readjust its maturity structure more quickly in response to changes in its asset value. Ideally, the firm would secure long-term financing just prior to when its financial health may worsen. Through this strategy, the firm can secure financing for the longest continuous period possible without rollover failure, avoiding inefficient restructuring costs.

Materials and methods: Sixty six in vitro fertilization (IVF) operations between June 2012 and November 2013 were included in this study. Totally 120 GVs were obtained. Normal GVs were categorized into 3 groups (n = 40) randomly: the first comprised oocytes that did not receive the cytoplasm of mature oocytes; the second group comprised oocytes that did not receive the cytoplasm of mature oocytes but were incubated for 24 h; and the third group comprised oocytes that received 10 - 15 % the cytoplasm of mature oocytes and were then incubated for 24 h.

Results: The expression levels of genes involved in the cytoplasmic maturity, and energy-producing mitochondria were significantly higher in the pooled oocytes of 2 nd control group {{than those of the}} 1 st control and intervention groups (p < 0. 001). The genes involved in the meiosis, spindle check point, DNA repairing and cell cycle checkpoint did not have any expression in the 1 st and intervention groups; however, these genes were expressed in the 2 nd group, significantly.
