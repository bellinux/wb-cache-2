5|$|For example, a bike in a 10m (33ft) radius {{steady-state}} turn at 10m/s (36km/h, 22mph) {{must be at}} {{an angle}} of 45.6°. A rider can lean {{with respect to the}} bike in order to keep either the torso or the bike more or less upright <b>if</b> <b>desired.</b> The angle that matters is the one between the horizontal plane and the plane defined by the tire contacts and the location of the center of mass of bike and rider.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Hobbits’ fears, Faramir {{was wise}} {{enough to realize that}} such a weapon was not to be used and <b>if</b> <b>desired,</b> should be resisted. With this knowledge, he also {{realized}} what his brother had to face, and wished that he had gone on the quest himself — knowing that Boromir {{would not have been able}} to resist the temptation to seize the Ring for himself. Giving the Hobbits provisions, he sent them on their way to continue their quest, but warned Frodo that their guide, Gollum, was a treacherous creature, and that an unknown terror lived in Cirith Ungol, where Gollum was leading them.|$|E

60|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{economic}} causes {{might be at}} the bottom of all political events even if philosophic materialism were false. Economic causes operate through men's desire for possessions, and would be supreme <b>if</b> this <b>desire</b> were supreme, even <b>if</b> <b>desire</b> could not, from a philosophic point of view, be explained in materialistic terms.|$|R

5|$|Thompson {{observes that}} there are many spirals in nature, from the horns of {{ruminants}} to the shells of molluscs; other spirals are found among the florets of the sunflower. He notes that the mathematics of these are similar but the biology differs. He describes the spiral of Archimedes before moving on to the logarithmic spiral, which has the property of never changing its shape: it is equiangular and is continually self-similar. Shells as diverse as Haliotis, Triton, Terebra and Nautilus (illustrated with a halved shell and a radiograph) have this property; different shapes are generated by sweeping out curves (or arbitrary shapes) by rotation, and <b>if</b> <b>desired</b> also by moving downwards. Thompson analyses both living molluscs and fossils such as ammonites.|$|E
5|$|Upon hearing this, the Combined Fleet commanders relented and {{accepted}} the proposed plan. The ship's crews were briefed {{on the nature of}} the mission and given the opportunity to stay behind <b>if</b> <b>desired</b> — none did. However, approximately 80 crew members who were new, sick, or infirm, were ordered off the ships, including sixty-seven naval cadets of Etajima Naval Academy Class No. 74 who had arrived on the battleship three days earlier. The ships' crews now engaged in some last-minute intense drills to prepare for the mission, mostly practicing damage-control procedures. At midnight, the ships were fueled. Reportedly, in secret defiance of orders to provide the ships with only just enough fuel to reach Okinawa, the Tokuyama personnel actually gave Yamato and the other ships almost all of the remaining fuel in the port, although this probably still was not enough to allow the force to return to Japan from Okinawa. In a ceremonial farewell, officers and enlisted men drank sake together.|$|E
5|$|God of War: Ascension is {{the only}} {{installment}} in the series to offer an online multiplayer feature, and up to eight players can take part. The main objective for players is {{to take control of}} a map to earn rewards from the gods. Before entering multiplayer battles, each player is introduced to a warrior, who, like Kratos, is an oath-breaker and is imprisoned in the Prison of the Damned—the warrior's backstory is explored in Rise of the Warrior. The player takes control of the warrior and aligns with one of the four deities: Ares, Hades, Zeus, or Poseidon. Each god offers a unique combat play-style and in-battle abilities. The attack style of the god with whom the player aligns is critical to their warrior's path. Players who ally with Ares are brute force experts with an up-close focus, although they are weak defensively, specifically to long range magical attacks. Players who ally with Zeus are magical experts with a focus on space control, although they are balanced by their lack of melee strength. Players who ally with Poseidon are supports with a focus on team synergy and self-sustenance; his synergistic powers can be replaced by more self-defense abilities <b>if</b> <b>desired,</b> although never as much as the other 3 gods. Players who ally with Hades are versatile, unlike the other 3, featuring other unique mechanics such as lifesteal, stealth and curses, making them excellent at controlling the flow of combat, although they can also choose to specialize in certain roles with certain armors or weaponry. Players can create up to three more warriors and have a champion representing each god.|$|E
