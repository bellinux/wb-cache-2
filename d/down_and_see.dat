500|$|... "Love Song" [...] {{tells the}} story of an ex-girlfriend fondly remembered ("I knew a girl and I like her still"). It is the first of two songs which feature dreamlike-senses in the lyrics ("I'll lay my head <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> what I see"). Barrett {{performed}} the song for Bob Harris' show in 1971.|$|E
500|$|It was August 20 by {{the time}} that they reached a point in the {{mountains}} where they could look <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> the Great Salt Lake. [...] It took almost another two weeks to travel out of the Wasatch Mountains. The men began to argue, and doubts were expressed about the wisdom of those who had chosen this route, in particular James Reed. Food and supplies began to run out for some of the less affluent families. Stanton and Pike had ridden out with Reed but had become lost on their way back; {{by the time}} that the party found them, they were a day away from eating their horses.|$|E
500|$|Bolt's record-setting runs caused {{commentators}} {{not only}} to praise his achievements but also to speculate about his potential {{to become one of}} the most successful sprinters ever. Critics hailed his Olympic success as a new beginning for a sport that had long suffered through high-profile drug scandals. The previous six years had seen the BALCO scandal, Tim Montgomery and Justin Gatlin stripped of their 100 m world records, and Marion Jones returning three Olympic gold medals. All three sprinters were disqualified from athletics after drugs tests detected banned substances in their systems. Bolt's record-breaking performances caused suspicion among some commentators, including Victor Conte, and the lack of an independent Caribbean anti-doping federation raised more concerns. The accusations of drug use were vehemently rejected by Glen Mills (Bolt's coach) and Herb Elliott (the Jamaican athletics team doctor). Elliott, a member of the IAAF anti-doping commission, urged those concerned about the issue to [...] "come <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> our programme, come <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> our testing, we have nothing to hide". Mills had been equally ardent that Bolt was a clean athlete, declaring to the Jamaica Gleaner: [...] "We will test any time, any day, any part of the body... doesn't even like to take vitamins". Bolt stated that he had been tested four times prior to the Olympics, and all had tested negative for banned substances. He also welcomed anti-doping authorities to test him to prove that he was clean, stating, [...] "We work hard and we perform well and we know we're clean".|$|E

2500|$|As the Union {{troops were}} rearranging their lines on June 21 in {{preparation}} for their mission against the railroad, they received a surprise visitor, President Abraham Lincoln, who had traveled by water and landed at City Point, Grant's newly established headquarters. He told Grant, [...] "I just thought I would jump aboard a boat and come <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> you. I don't expect I can do any good, and in fact I'm afraid I may do some harm, but I'll just put myself under your orders and if you find me doing anything wrong just send me right away." [...] After discussing strategy with Grant, Lincoln visited some of the VI Corps troops who would participate in the upcoming battle.|$|E

60|$|I {{was very}} sorry for him, though I could not think about it, of course, still less speak; {{but that was the}} {{beginning}} of my hating myself, and I have hated myself more and more ever since I have taken to write all this <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>seen</b> how hard <b>and</b> foolish I was, how very much the worst of the three.|$|R
