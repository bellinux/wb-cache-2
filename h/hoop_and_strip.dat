40|$|A {{systematic}} way to choose control design parameters and to evaluate performance for large space antennas is presented. The structural dynamics and control properties for a <b>Hoop</b> <b>and</b> Column Antenna and a Wrap-Rib Antenna are characterized. Some {{results of the}} effects of model parameter uncertainties to the stability, surface accuracy, and pointing errors are presented. Critical dynamics and control problems for these antenna configurations are identified and potential solutions are discussed. It was concluded that structural uncertainties and model error can cause serious performance deterioration and can even destabilize the controllers. For the <b>hoop</b> <b>and</b> column antenna, large <b>hoop</b> <b>and</b> long meat and the lack of stiffness between the two substructures result in low structural frequencies. Performance can be improved if this design can be strengthened. The two-site control system is more robust than either single-site control systems for the <b>hoop</b> <b>and</b> column antenna...|$|R
