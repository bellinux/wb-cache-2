5|$|France's {{blockade}} {{had lasted}} for two years, and the 'American' government, inspired by 'American' spirit, was facing off with France, European principles, European pretensions. The social {{results of the}} French blockade, however, had been fruitful for the Argentine Republic, and served to demonstrate <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>their</b> nakedness {{the current state of}} mind and the new elements of struggle, which were to ignite a fierce war that can end only with the fall of that monstrous government.|$|E
5|$|Early {{the next}} day an attack by German 88mm guns {{destroyed}} some of 10 Para's transport. The battalion counterattacked, capturing the guns and a nearby farm building they were using. The brigade advance restarted at 07:00, but by now the 9th SS Panzer Division had established a blocking position between Oosterbeek and the Ede–Arnhem road across the brigade's expected route. Repeated assaults by both battalions {{could not find a}} way through. Advancing through heavy woodland, 156 Para were confronted by infantry supported by mortars, self propelled guns (SP gun) as well as fighter aircraft, and the battalion suffered heavy losses. At one stage 'A' Company penetrated the German line, but before they could dig <b>in,</b> <b>all</b> <b>their</b> officers were killed or wounded. Short of ammunition, the remaining men were counter-attacked by the Germans and driven back.|$|E
5|$|My {{situation}} is most critical, not from anything the enemy can do, {{but from the}} disposition of the people– The Population, believe me is essentially bad– A full belief possesses them that this Province must inevitably succumb– This Prepossession is fatal to every exertion– Legislators, Magistrates, Militia Officers, all, have imbibed the idea, and are so sluggish and indifferent <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>their</b> respective offices that the artful and active scoundrel is allowed to parade the Country without interruption, and commit all imaginable mischief... What a change an additional regiment would make {{in this part of}} the Province! Most of the people have lost all confidence– I however speak loud and look big.|$|E

5|$|Roe {{was rated}} as {{being one of}} Somerset better batsmen in their early years of {{first-class}} cricket, but his form in club cricket did not translate into good performances for the county. Between 1881 and 1882, Roe scored thirteen centuries, but none of those came in county cricket. In fact, {{it was not until}} 1884 that he made his first hundred in first-class cricket, scoring 132 against Hampshire. His work as a schoolmaster limited his availability for Somerset, and he only played three first-class matches for them in each of 1884 and 1885. After the 1885 season, Somerset were stripped of their first-class status for three reasons: they had not organised and played enough first-class fixtures during the season, their performances were not what was expected from a first-class county, and they had not succeeded in fielding a full side of eleven players <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>their</b> matches.|$|E
5|$|The confessional {{conflicts}} {{that dominated the}} relations between the ruling city authorities were only secondary to the peasants of the Huttwil league. The peasant alliance bridged the confessional divide, uniting Catholic people from the Entlebuch and from Solothurn with Protestant peasants from the Emmental and from Basel. The treaty of Huttwil explicitly recognized this biconfessionalism. The cities remained <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>their</b> manoeuvring and negotiations for military support within their respective confessional spheres: Catholic Lucerne had requested mediation and then military help from the Catholic central Swiss cantons, while Protestant Bern had turned to Protestant Zürich for help. The distrust between the authorities of the Catholic and Protestant cantons was so deep that none would allow troops of the other confession to operate on their territories.|$|E
5|$|To {{reach the}} gold fields, most took the route through the ports of Dyea and Skagway in Southeast Alaska. Here, the Klondikers could follow either the Chilkoot or the White Pass trails to the Yukon River and sail {{down to the}} Klondike. Each of them was {{required}} to bring a year's supply of food by the Canadian authorities {{in order to prevent}} starvation. <b>In</b> <b>all,</b> <b>their</b> equipment weighed close to a ton, which for most had to be carried in stages by themselves. Together with mountainous terrain and cold climate, this meant that those who persisted did not arrive until summer 1898. Once there, they found few opportunities, and many left disappointed.|$|E
