The IAAF World Championships in Athletics became a fully professional competition {{with the introduction of}} prize money in 1997, and in 1998 the IAAF Golden League—an annual series of major {{track and field}} meetings in Europe—provided a higher level of <b>economic</b> <b>incentive</b> {{in the form of a}} US$1 million jackpot. In 2010, the series was replaced by the more lucrative IAAF Diamond League, a fourteen-meeting series held in Europe, Asia, North America and the Middle East—the first ever worldwide annual series of track and field meetings.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 20th century, the mule {{breeding}} industry collapsed with the advent of mechanization. By 1922, Poitevin foals became difficult to sell, and the population dropped dramatically as there was no <b>economic</b> <b>incentive</b> for breeding. A continued breeding of mules caused the breed to decline faster than other draft breeds, as purebred horses were not bred as often. By 1945, breed selection was oriented towards the production of meat, as the only remaining economic opportunity for farmers. The conformation of the breed changed slightly to become shorter, but the Poitevin remained unprofitable for horse meat, as breeders preferred to invest in herds of Comtois and Breton horses, which were faster growing and higher yielding.|$|E

40|$|The use of <b>economic</b> <b>incentives</b> {{to improve}} {{health and safety}} (H&S) {{performance}} {{in the construction industry}} in general has been investigated by various scholars. However, few studies have looked at the impact of <b>economic</b> <b>incentives</b> on construction clients, especially in the developing world. This paper reports findings on the feasibility of incentives to influence construction clients to perform on H&S. The investigation was conducted using a Delphi technique to determine the impact significance of <b>economic</b> <b>incentives</b> or disincentives on construction clients’ H&S performance. A panel of experts in construction H&S was assembled from most regions of the world. A three- round iterative Delphi study aimed at establishing consensus from the expert panel was then conducted. The study found that economic factors have critical impact significance on clients’ H&S performance, and that clients were ‘very likely’ to implement various H&S elements {{as a result of the}} <b>economic</b> <b>incentives</b> and or disincentives. There is little research on the use of incentives to influence construction clients’ H&S performance and the effectiveness of such incentives. This gap in literature, and the need for improvement in construction H&S performance, motivated the current study. Therefore it was necessary to investigate specifically the extent to which <b>economic</b> <b>incentives</b> could be used to influence construction clients to become involved in H&S programmes. <b>Economic</b> <b>incentives</b> are considered to be a proactive way of improving H&S performance among other key parties, such as employees in the construction industry. The paper reports on the findings from an analysis of the impact significance of <b>economic</b> <b>incentives</b> on clients.

The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) has estimated that a total of approximately US$547.2 million (1 billion Brazilian reais) per year would be required from international sources to compensate the forest developers and establish a highly organized framework to fully implement forest governance and monitoring, and the foundation of new protected forest areas in the Amazon for future sustainability.|$|E
25|$|Direct {{subsidies}} {{are paid to}} farmers. This was originally intended to encourage farmers to choose to grow those crops attracting subsidies and maintain home-grown supplies. Subsidies were generally paid on the area of land growing a particular crop, {{rather than on the}} total amount of crop produced. Reforms implemented from 2005 are phasing out specific subsidies in favour of flat-rate payments based only on the area of land in cultivation, and for adopting environmentally beneficial farming methods. The change is intended to give farmers more freedom to choose for themselves those crops most in demand and reduce the <b>economic</b> <b>incentive</b> to overproduce.|$|E

From 1480 onward it had supplied several expeditions {{to look for}} Hy-Brazil. According to Celtic legend, this island lay somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. There was widespread belief among merchants in the port that Bristol men had discovered the island at earlier date but then lost track of it. Note: Ruddock had contended in a private 1988 letter to a colleague, Quinn, that she had found evidence in Italian archives that Bristol men had discovered North America pre-1470.

40|$|The {{rationale}} for the cooperation and coordination of reactions to supply disruptions can be based on political motives or economic motives; even if the rationale is political, coordinated reactions require the implementation of two economic principles. By using <b>economic</b> <b>incentives</b> {{for as long as}} possible and by minimising losses after <b>economic</b> <b>incentives</b> have been interrupted, countries commit to maximise the economic value of gas consumption and that creates common ground to support solidarity. While the proper implementation of both principles is necessary, the implementation from before the 2016 sustainable energy security package has several shortcomings; some of these issues are addressed in the new package. There is, however, room for additional improvements beyond the proposals in the package to better use <b>economic</b> <b>incentives</b> for activating demand side resources, to make the criteria for interrupting <b>economic</b> <b>incentives</b> firm and transparent such as a price cap, to orderly rank resources when <b>economic</b> <b>incentives</b> have been interrupted, and to make those on the receiving end of solidarity anticipate the end of solidarity as soon as possible...|$|R

25|$|African slavery {{became more}} common in Brazil during the mid 16th century, though the {{enslavement}} of indigenous people continued into the 17th and even the 18th century in the backlands of Brazil. Indigenous slaves remained much cheaper during this time than their African counterparts, though they did suffer horrendous death rates from European diseases. Although the average African slave lived to only be twenty-three years old due to terrible work conditions, this was still about four years longer than Indigenous slaves, which was a big contribution to high price of African slaves. Even though prices for indigenous slaves were cheaper, {{there was never a}} focus on maintaining slave families. Because enslaved peoples were always so available, either through conquest or buying them through the market, the <b>economic</b> <b>incentive</b> to keep families together never manifested itself.|$|E
25|$|Citizens of the European Union, {{including}} those of the UK, have the right to live and work in any EU member state. The UK applied temporary restrictions to citizens of Romania and Bulgaria, which joined the EU in January 2007. Research conducted by the Migration Policy Institute for the Equality and Human Rights Commission suggests that, between May 2004 and September 2009, 1.5million workers migrated from the new EU member states to the UK, two-thirds of them Polish, but that many subsequently returned home, resulting in a net {{increase in the number of}} nationals of the new member states in the UK of some 700,000 over that period. The late-2000s recession in the UK reduced the <b>economic</b> <b>incentive</b> for Poles to migrate to the UK, the migration becoming temporary and circular. In 2009, for the first time since enlargement, more nationals of the eight central and eastern European states that had joined the EU in 2004 left the UK than arrived. In 2011, citizens of the new EU member states made up 13% of the immigrants entering the country.|$|E
25|$|The {{ruling is}} controversial. Representatives of the US ethanol {{industry}} complained that this rule overstates the {{environmental effects of}} corn ethanol, and also criticized the inclusion of indirect effects of land-use changes as an unfair penalty to home-made corn ethanol because deforestation {{in the developing world}} is being tied to US ethanol production. The initial reference value set for 2011 for LCFS means that Mid-west corn ethanol will not meet the California standard unless current carbon intensity is reduced. Oil industry representatives complained that there is a cost associated to the new standard, as the LCFS will limit the use of corn ethanol blended in gasoline, thus leaving oil refiners with few available and viable options, such as sugarcane ethanol from Brazil, but this option means paying costly U.S. import tariffs. CARB officials and environmentalists reject such scenario because they think {{there will be plenty of}} time and <b>economic</b> <b>incentive</b> to developed inexpensive biofuels, hydrogen-based fuels, even ethanol from such cellulosic materials, or new ways to make ethanol out of corn with a smaller carbon footprint.|$|E

500|$|Scotland had {{suffered}} considerable economic disruption {{during the period}} of the civil wars, caused by loss of manpower to a dozen armies, free quarter (the billeting of troops on civilians without payment), plunder and heavy taxation. A number of merchants, particularly moneylenders, were ruined by the wars. The east-coast towns had probably lost about one fifth of their population from the outbreak of bubonic plague that occurred in 1645. This was slow to recover and in 1651 rents in Edinburgh had to be reduced by a third. The free trade that was the major <b>economic</b> <b>incentive</b> of the union was not all beneficial, as Scotland now had to compete with the more highly developed English merchant fleet. The economy began to revive after 1650, but the prosperity was not spread evenly across the country. While Glasgow and Aberdeen prospered, Dundee and the Fife ports continued to decline. The financing of military building and the spending of wages by so many soldiers did benefit some. New industries included glass production at Leith and Cromwell's troops are traditionally credited with bringing north both the knitting of socks and the planting of kale. The good order imposed by the armed presence encouraged trade and manufacture. Alexander Burnet, later Archbishop of St. Andrews, commented that, [...] "we always reckoned those eight years of usurpation a time of great peace and prosperity".|$|E

With these releases came the Open Game License, which allowed other companies to make use of those systems. The new edition of the D game won the 2000 Origins Award for Best Roleplaying Game. In 2002, Wizards sponsored a design contest which allowed designers to submit their campaign worlds to Wizards, to produce an entirely original campaign world; Wizards selected [...] "Eberron", submitted by Keith Baker, and its first hardcover book was released in June 2004.
