500|$|... "Enough, sir, {{no more of}} that; the die is cast, and {{if there}} are fifty sail <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> through them." [...] A {{passenger}} aboard Victory, Captain Benjamin Hallowell, achieved a brief notoriety for slapping the admiral on the back and calling out [...] "That's right Sir John, that's right.

500|$|Jane Suuto was {{the joint}} oldest person to {{represent}} Uganda at the London Games {{at the age}} of 33. She had not entered any previous Summer Olympics. Sutto qualified for the Games because she achieved a third-place finish at the 2012 Riga Marathon with a time of two hours, 42 minutes and seven seconds, that met the [...] "B" [...] qualifying standard for her event, the women's marathon. In an interview with New Vision before she competed Suuto said: [...] "I will not promise a medal but <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> out there to offer my best and whatever God offers me. I will take it with both hands. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> out there and fight." [...] In the event held on 5 August, she finished 93rd out of 107 athletes, with a time of two hours, 44 minutes and 46 seconds. Suuto ranked ahead of Yolimar Pineda of Venezuela (two hours, 45 minutes and 16 seconds) and Anikó Kálovics from Hungary (two hours, 45 minutes and 55 seconds) but was behind Kálovics's fellow countrywoman Zsófia Erdélyi (two hours, 44 minutes and 45 seconds). Suuto finished 21 minutes and 39 seconds behind event winner Tiki Gelana of Ethiopia (two hours, 23 minutes and seven seconds).|$|E
500|$|As president, Coolidge's {{reputation}} as a quiet man continued. [...] "The words of a President have an enormous weight," [...] he would later write, [...] "and {{ought not to be}} used indiscriminately." [...] Coolidge was aware of his stiff reputation; indeed, he cultivated it. [...] "I think the American people want a solemn ass as a President," [...] he once told Ethel Barrymore, [...] "and I think <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> along with them." [...] Some historians would later suggest that Coolidge's image was created deliberately as a campaign tactic, while others believe his withdrawn and quiet behavior to be natural, deepening {{after the death of his}} son in 1924.|$|E

500|$|They {{arrived in}} Palermo on 20 July, and Murphy was sidelined by illness for a week. Allied {{capture of the}} transit port of Messina was crucial to taking Sicily from the Axis. En route there, Company B was {{assigned}} to a hillside location protecting a machine-gun emplacement, {{while the rest of}} the 3rd Infantry Division fought at San Fratello. The Axis began their evacuation of Messina on 27 July. Although the 3rd Infantry Division's 7th Infantry Regiment secured the port on 17 August, the Axis had already completed their evacuation hours before. During the fighting in Sicily, Murphy became realistic about military duty: [...] "I have seen war as it actually is, and I do not like it. But <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> on fighting." ...|$|E
500|$|Williams {{sings the}} lead vocals while Beyoncé and Rowland sing their {{respective}} solo verses {{and serve as}} background vocalists throughout the song. Eric Corpus from The Christian Post interpreted the song's lyrics as a praise of God's sovereignty and [...] "magnetism" [...] of Jesus' love. [...] "Say Yes" [...] opens with a message of faith as Williams sings the first lines, [...] "I'm not worried about a thing/'Cause I know you are guiding me / Where you lead me / Lord <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> / I have not fear / 'Cause I know who's in control." [...] The chorus is constructed as a call and response with the trio repeatedly praising Jesus through the lines [...] "When Jesus say yes, nobody can say no!" [...] while being backed by a choir which repeats the verses.|$|E
500|$|In the {{subsequent}} years of peace, the old army commander remained a tireless instructor of his now legendary Hussar regiment. In his {{last years of}} life, Zieten alternated between Berlin, where he {{bought a house in}} 1763 on Kochstrasse No. 6162. and on his property at Wustrau, where he devoted himself mainly to charity. At the same time, he worked with great care to improve his property. He enjoyed the special trust of Frederick, who frequently visited [...] "his old father Zieten." [...] In one visit with the King, at Sanssouci, after a long conversation, the King ordered a chair to be placed on which he invited the 85-year-old man to sit. Despite his infirmities, Zieten refused to sit {{in the presence of the}} monarch; the King said: [...] "Sit down, Zieten, or <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> away." ...|$|E

500|$|In a 1988 {{interview}} with Barbara Walters, Fonda expressed regret {{for some of}} her comments and actions, stating:I {{would like to say}} something, not just to Vietnam veterans in New England, but to men who were in Vietnam, who I hurt, or whose pain I caused to deepen because of things that I said or did. I was trying to help end the killing and the war, but there were times when I was thoughtless and careless about it and I'm very sorry that I hurt them. And I want to apologize to them and their families. [...] <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> to my grave regretting the photograph of me in an anti-aircraft gun, which looks like I was trying to shoot at American planes. It hurt so many soldiers. It galvanized such hostility. It was the most horrible thing I could possibly have done. It was just thoughtless.|$|E
500|$|Although {{there was}} no desire in Brazil among the {{majority}} of the population to change the form of government, the civilian republicans began pressuring army officers to overthrow the monarchy. They launched a coup d'état, arrested Prime Minister Afonso Celso, Viscount of Ouro Preto and instituted the republic on 15 November 1889. The few people who witnessed what occurred did not realize that it was a rebellion. Historian Lídia Besouchet noted that [...] "arely has a revolution been so minor." [...] During the ordeal PedroII showed no emotion, as if unconcerned about the outcome. He dismissed all suggestions for quelling the rebellion that politicians and military leaders put forward. When he heard the news of his deposition he simply commented: [...] "If it is so, it will be my retirement. I have worked too hard and I am tired. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> rest then." [...] He and his family were sent into exile in Europe on 17 November.|$|E
500|$|Kunis {{began dating}} actor Macaulay Culkin in 2002. During their relationship, {{there were rumors}} of the couple getting married, but Kunis denied them. In an {{interview}} with BlackBook magazine, Kunis stated that marriage is [...] "not something that's important to me". Kunis said she tried her best to protect her and Culkin's privacy, noting that [...] "We don't talk about it to the press. It's already more high profile than I want it to be." [...] When {{asked if it was}} difficult {{to stay out of the}} tabloids and press, Kunis responded: [...] "I keep my personal life as personal as I physically, mentally, possibly can." [...] Asked if that is difficult she said, [...] "I don't care. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> to my grave trying. It is hard, but I'll end up going to a bar that's a hole in the wall. I won't go to the 'it's-happening' place." [...] On January 3, 2011, Kunis' publicist confirmed reports that Kunis and Culkin had ended their relationship, saying [...] "The split was amicable, and they remain close friends." ...|$|E

500|$|Thatcher defined her own {{political}} philosophy {{in a major}} and controversial break with the one-nation conservatism of Edward Heath and her Conservative predecessors in an interview published in Woman's Own magazine, three months after her victory in the 1987 general election:I think we have gone through a period when too many children and people {{have been given to}} understand [...] "I have a problem, it is the Government's job to cope with it!" [...] or [...] "I have a problem, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> and get a grant to cope with it!" [...] "I am homeless, the Government must house me!" [...] and so they are casting their problems on society and who is society? There is no such thing! There are individual men and women and there are families and no government can do anything except through people and people look to themselves first. It is our duty to look after ourselves and then also to help look after our neighbour and life is a reciprocal business and people have got the entitlements too much in mind without the obligations.|$|E
500|$|The French action {{drew the}} {{attention}} of not just the British, but also the Indian tribes of the area. [...] Despite good Franco-Indian relations, British traders had become highly successful in convincing the Indians to trade with them in preference to the Canadiens, and the planned large-scale advance was not well received by all. [...] In particular, Tanacharison, a Mingo chief {{also known as the}} [...] "Half King", became decidedly anti-French as a consequence. [...] In a meeting with Paul Marin de la Malgue, commander of the French and Canadien construction force, the latter reportedly lost his temper, and shouted at the Indian chief, [...] "I tell you, down the river <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go.</b> [...] If the river is blocked up, I have the forces to burst it open and tread under my feet all that oppose me. [...] I despise all the stupid things you have said." [...] He then threw down some wampum that Tanacharison had offered as a good will gesture. [...] Marin died not long after, and command of the operations was turned over to Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre.|$|E
500|$|At the fort, Moultrie {{ordered his}} men to {{concentrate}} their fire on the two large man-of-war ships, Bristol and Experiment, which took hit after hit from the fort's guns. Chain shot fired at Bristol eventually destroyed much of her rigging and severely damaged both the main- and mizzenmasts. One round hit her quarterdeck, slightly wounding Parker in the knee and thigh. The shot also tore off part of his britches, leaving his backside exposed. By mid-afternoon, the defenders were running out of gunpowder, and their fire was briefly suspended. However, Lee sent more ammunition and gunpowder over from the mainland, and the defenders resumed firing at the British ships; Lee even briefly visited the fort late in the day, telling Colonel Moultrie, [...] "I see you are doing very well here, you have no occasion for me, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> up to the town again." [...] Admiral Parker eventually sought to destroy the fort's walls with persistent broadside cannonades. This strategy failed due to the spongy nature of the palmetto wood used in its constructions; the structure would quiver, and it absorbed the cannonballs rather than splintering. [...] The exchange continued until around 9:00 pm, when darkness forced a cessation of hostilities, and the fleet finally withdrew out of range.|$|E

500|$|Ouro Preto {{arrived at}} the palace at 4 p.m and {{suggested}} that Pedro II nominate senator Gaspar da Silveira Martins, who would arrive in the city two days later, as the new President. Deodoro avoided meeting personally with Pedro II, but once he heard that the Emperor had chosen a personal enemy of his for the office, he finally decided on the inauguration of the Republic. The recently elected Chamber of Deputies was only to be called into session on 20 November, and the Senate was in recess. For this reason, Princess Isabel insisted that her father convoke the Council of State {{to deal with the}} situation. But she was given the reply, [...] "Later on." [...] The princess, on her own initiative, called the council members. [...] The Council assembled at 11 p.m, and after two hours recommended that the Emperor appoint Antônio Saraiva instead of Silveira Martins. After accepting the office, this politician sent an emissary to negotiate with Deodoro. But Deodoro responded that {{it was too late to}} change his mind. Upon hearing the reply, Pedro II commented, [...] "If it is so, it will be my retirement. I have worked too hard and I am tired. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> rest then." ...|$|E
500|$|On 7 July 2008, media {{reported}} that Ganguly was being projected {{as a candidate}} for the post of President of the Cricket Association of Bengal(CAB) against his former mentor Jagmohan Dalmiya. Reports also suggested that he could run for the post of BCCIPresident in 2014 as East Zone's representative. Ganguly himself did not deny the reports and did not rule out any such move. The same year in October, Ganguly announced that the Test series against Australia starting in October 2008 would be his last and stated [...] "o be honest, I didn't expect to be picked for this series. Before coming here, [...] I spoke to my team-mates and hopefully <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> out with a winning knock." [...] Ganguly played in every game of the four-Test series and amassed 324 runs at an average of 54.00. While playing the second Test match of the series in Mohali, Ganguly scored his final test century. In the final test match he played at Nagpur against Australia he scored 85 and 0 in his first and second innings respectively. In the Fourth and final Test, with India needing one wicket to secure a victory, the Indian captain, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, invited Ganguly to lead the side in the field for the final time. India regained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, winning the series 2–0.|$|E
500|$|When the House of Commons {{defeated}} the First Reform Bill in 1831, Grey's ministry urged William to dissolve Parliament, which {{would lead to}} a new general election. At first, William hesitated to exercise his prerogative to dissolve Parliament because elections had just been held the year before and the country {{was in a state of}} high excitement which might boil over into violence. He was, however, irritated by the conduct of the Opposition, which announced its intention to move the passage of an Address, or resolution, in the House of Lords, against dissolution. Regarding the Opposition's motion as an attack on his prerogative, and at the urgent request of Lord Grey and his ministers, William IV prepared to go in person to the House of Lords and prorogue Parliament. The monarch's arrival would stop all debate and prevent passage of the Address. When initially told that his horses could not be ready at such short notice, William is supposed to have said, [...] "Then <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> in a hackney cab!" [...] Coach and horses were assembled quickly and William immediately proceeded to Parliament. Said The Times of the scene before William's arrival, [...] "It is utterly impossible to describe the scene... The violent tones and gestures of noble Lords... astonished the spectators, and affected the ladies who were present with visible alarm." [...] Lord Londonderry brandished a whip, threatening to thrash the Government supporters, and was held back by four of his colleagues. William hastily put on the crown, entered the Chamber, and dissolved Parliament. This forced new elections for the House of Commons, which yielded a great victory for the reformers. But although the House of Commons was clearly in favour of parliamentary reform, the House of Lords remained implacably opposed to it.|$|E
