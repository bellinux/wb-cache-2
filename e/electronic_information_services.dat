25|$|The {{introduction}} of electronic {{information in the}} last quarter of the twentieth century brought a new era of library operations and services, with the ability to access information resources beyond those available in the physical facility. As early as 1973, the Library began to take advantage of <b>electronic</b> <b>information</b> <b>services</b> by acquiring the New York Times Information Bank, the first computerized online information retrieval service. By the 1990s, the library was able to access thousands of U.S. and foreign newspapers and magazines, highly specialized biographic and subject information, and U.S. government and think tank documents through commercial and government databases. The development of the Department's Intranet on the Open Net system has made the resources of the library accessible to Department employees worldwide. The library's electronic catalog, new acquisitions lists, and connection to reference services are available on the Department's I-Net.|$|E

40|$|The report {{outlines}} {{research with}} blind and partially sighted people using <b>electronic</b> <b>information</b> <b>services</b> in real-life situations, and specifically how their experiences might inform {{the planning of}} these services in UK public libraries. Based upon a full literature review, a survey was conducted of blind and partially sighted people who have some experience of using <b>electronic</b> <b>information</b> <b>services,</b> suitable for, but not restricted to use in, public libraries. The methodology outlines the creation of two electronic survey formats, designed to be accessible and usable for {{blind and visually impaired}} people, and the related issues of delivery for the study sample. The data collected is included, and a full analysis of the findings is presented. Correlation was found with other wider surveys in the specific fields of blind and visually impaired people, and <b>electronic</b> <b>information</b> <b>services.</b> The report concludes that the visually impaired and especially blind people surveyed feel that libraries are out of touch with their needs relating to <b>electronic</b> <b>information</b> <b>services,</b> that there is correlation between users’ personal preferences and the usability of services, and that diverse and varying services act as a barrier to use. Evidence was also found to support the idea that computer access technologies aimed at blind and visually impaired people may attract very little use in libraries, without significant investment in staff training. A case is made for greater investigation of remote access to electronic services that can be accessed by blind people with their own equipment. This is felt to have usability benefits such as users’ familiarity with their own systems, and the reduction of unnecessary travel. It was also concluded {{that there is a need}} for specific consultation with people who are blind, separate from those who are partially sighted, and early involvement of both groups in testing of new services...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Library is an {{effective}} source of information to be shared by people of all kinds. A good library hosts everything under the sun {{in the form of}} words to enrich the knowledge of the users. Providing information about everything under the sun, under one roof in one geographical location is next to impossible. Hence there must be a way to share information that is spread over, and that can be achieved only through the effective use of electronic media. Complete computerization of all the libraries and a dedicated, centralized server to host information available at different libraries will help in effective sharing of information. A library is completely computerized only if the user irrespective of background or knowledge, is able to access information available in the library from anywhere just by typing few letters/words.
