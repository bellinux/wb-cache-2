500|$|Megaforce {{initially}} pressed 75,000 {{copies of}} the album for the US market, while Music for Nations {{took care of the}} European market. By the autumn of 1984, Ride the Lightning had moved 85,000 copies in Europe, resulting in Metallica's first cover story for Kerrang! in its December issue. After signing Metallica, Elektra released the single [...] "Creeping Death" [...] in a sleeve depicting a bridge and a skull painted grey and green. The album peaked at number 100 on the Billboard 200 with no radio exposure. In 1984, the French record label Bernett Records misprinted the color of the album cover in green, rather than blue, and 400 copies with the green cover were produced. Because of their rarity, these green albums have become collectors' items. Ride the Lightning went gold by November 1987 and in 2012 was certified 6× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipping six million copies in the US. The album, along with Kill 'Em All, was reissued in 2016 as a boxed set including demos and live recordings. Many rock publications have ranked Ride the Lightning on their best album lists. The album placed fifth on IGN Music's [...] "Top 25 Metal Albums" [...] list. Spin listed it as a thrash metal essential, declaring it [...] "the thrashiest thrash ever". According to Guitar World, Ride the Lightning [...] "didn't <b>just</b> <b>change</b> the band's trajectory—it reset the course of metal itself". Corey Deiterman of the Houston Press considers Ride the Lightning the most influential Metallica album, saying it had a lasting impact on genres such as crossover thrash and hardcore punk. In 2017, it was ranked 11th on Rolling Stone list of [...] "100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time".|$|E
500|$|Michael Lopez from The Huffington Post {{reviewed}} the video saying [...] "Flossing {{a bright red}} blazer and a hefty afro, the part-Puerto Rican crooner looks like he time traveled to a vintage Euro discotheque. But to be honest, the trend works! And it’s certainly helped by 'Treasure's' bouncy beats". Kyle Anderson from EW wrote [...] "We should probably <b>just</b> <b>change</b> {{the name of this}} year from '2013' to '1978', because there are more sparkly suits and disco guitars than we know what to do with" [...] and that [...] "Bruno Mars has gone full-on Betamax for his new video for the track 'Treasure'. It's all there: the suits, the setting, and the bong-water video effects". Jordan Sargent of Spin said that Mars wasn't trying to hide the Michael Jackson influence on the video, writing [...] "new low-def makes obvious — compare it next to, say, the video for [...] "Rock with You"". Similarly, Robbie Daw, from the Idolator website, drew {{attention to the fact that}} the song and dance had already been seen during the performance on Billboard Music Awards in May, since [...] "Mars and his band seem to have recreated that very same performance for this clip". He also wrote that the video was [...] "still a fun three minutes to sit through", mainly because [...] "Bruno mimics MJ's [...] "Rock With You" [...] moves so deftly". According to Joseph Atilano of the Philippine Daily Inquirer, [...] "everything from the choreography, stage lighting, and so on, serve as a heartfelt ode to that era". He wrote [...] "visually, the music video is tricked out with set pieces such as a disco ball and vintage stage lights. Even the manner by which the instruments were set up in the background show the attention given to even the minutest of details and the small things do matter when it comes to making a music video".|$|E

2500|$|Peter Garrett was criticised by the Coalition when radio {{announcer}} Steve Price revealed Garrett {{had said to}} TV presenter Richard Wilkins that, [...] "once we get in we'll <b>just</b> <b>change</b> it all" [...] in reference to copying Coalition policies. Garrett said the comment was made during a [...] "short, jocular and casual" [...] conversation and Wilkins supported Garrett's response, {{saying that it was}} a [...] "light-hearted throwaway line".|$|E

2500|$|When Troughton {{left the}} series in 1969, the Doctor was renewed again, {{but this time}} the change was forced on him by the Time Lords at the {{conclusion}} of The War Games, where it is referred to as a [...] "change of appearance". As with the first change, this language suggested only a superficial physical change, not one of personality, although Jon Pertwee's portrayal of the Third Doctor also differed quite substantially from Troughton's. Unlike the previous change, this one is treated as a punishment rather than a natural process: in The War Games the Doctor protests, [...] "You can't <b>just</b> <b>change</b> what I look like without consulting me!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, McVie {{was awarded}} the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors' Gold Badge of Merit at a {{ceremony}} held at London's Savoy Hotel. In November 2009, McVie went to see Fleetwood Mac's last UK performance on their Unleashed tour in London, but did not join her former bandmates on stage. During the announcement of Fleetwood Mac's 2012 world tour, Stevie Nicks downplayed the likelihood of McVie ever rejoining the group: [...] "She went to England and {{she has never been}} back since 1998 [...] as much as we would all like to think that she'll <b>just</b> <b>change</b> her mind one day, I don't think it'll happen [...] We love her, so we had to let her go." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{central theme}} in Catherine Doherty's spirituality is [...] "the {{duty of the}} moment". As she herself put it:The duty of the moment is what you should be doing at any given time, in {{whatever}} place God has put you. You may not have Christ in a homeless person at your door, but {{you may have a}} little child. If you have a child, your duty of the moment may be to change a dirty diaper. So you do it. But you don't <b>just</b> <b>change</b> that diaper, you change it {{to the best of your}} ability, with great love for both God and that child.... There are all kinds of good Catholic things you can do, but whatever they are, you have to realize that there is always the duty of the moment to be done. And it must be done, because the duty of the moment is the duty of God.|$|E

But really {{you are in a}} no-win, damned-if-you-do-and-damned-if-you-don't scenario: [...] If you change it, everyone's going to whinge and whine about political correctness. And if you don't change it, obviously you are offending a lot of people inadvertently. [...] We haven't made any decisions about what we'll do." [...] Stephen Fry, writer for the remake, was asked to provide several alternative names for the dog, and came up with several suggestions. [...] Executive producer David Frost rejected them all, saying [...] "Guy sometimes used to call his dog Nigsy, so I think that's what we will call it. Stephen has been coming up with other names, but this is the one I want." [...] Jackson's assistant contradicted this a week later, however, saying [...] "To stay true to the story, you can't <b>just</b> <b>change</b> [...] We have not made any decisions yet. The script is still being written; and that decision will be made closer to the time." ...|$|E

In those days, when your team only had seven players, you automatically lose by default. That {{was the fifth}} game, against Toyota. I didn't play the previous game but that night, I was a starter. In my entire basketball career, I never practiced as a point guard. Even in that particular game, Baby (Dalupan) did not tell me that I was starting as a point guard. He just sent me out there. In the previous game, I noticed that Hubalde was playing forward. When he attracted a double-team, he'd swing the ball but {{the man at the}} top of the key couldn't deliver. Atoy Co couldn't get the ball because he was also well-covered. So the next game, the whole evening I was the point guard. We won the championship. I dominated the game. It was my show the whole evening. That's the kind of talent Baby has. Baby has some moves that would <b>just</b> <b>change</b> the face or the tempo of the game. I don't know where he got those ideas. Whoever thought I would be playing as a point guard?" ...|$|E
