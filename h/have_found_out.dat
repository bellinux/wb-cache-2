25|$|The {{requirement}} for reliance {{has not been}} pushed {{so far as to}} say that a misrepresentor is never liable when a misrepresentee could <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> the truth. In the leading case, Redgrave v Hurd Mr Hurd was told by the elderly Mr Redgrave that the solicitor practice earned £300 pa. Mr Redgrave told Mr Hurd he could check some documents in the office to prove it. Mr Hurd did not check, and subsequently signed a contract to join Mr Redgrave as a partner. Then Mr Hurd found out the practice only generated £200 pa, and the documents in the office had never said otherwise. Lord Jessel MR held that the contract could be rescinded for misrepresentation, because Mr Redgrave had still made a misrepresentation. Furthmore it would be inferred that Mr Hurd relied on the statement from the fact that it was untrue. Edgington v Fitzmaurice confirmed further that a misrepresentation need not be the sole cause of entering a contract, for a remedy to be available, so long as it is an influence.|$|E
25|$|During {{a search}} among Mrs McGinty's possessions, Poirot finds a {{newspaper}} from which an {{article has been}} cut out. The newspaper is dated {{a few days before}} the murder. He later discovers that the missing article is about women connected with famous murder cases, and includes photographs of them. He also discovers that Mrs McGinty had purchased a bottle of ink in a local shop shortly before her murder. He concludes that she had recognised one of the women in the article, and had written to the paper in question. Someone must <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> about it and then killed her to prevent her from talking. Poirot and Spence, using the ages of people in the town, conclude that someone is either Lily Gamboll, who committed murder with a meat cleaver as a child, or Eva Kane, who had been the love interest who inspired a man to murder his wife and bury her in a cellar. Another possibility is that someone is Evelyn Hope, the daughter of Eva Kane. Shortly afterwards, Poirot discovers the murder weapon, a sugar hammer, left around in plain sight at his boarding house and accessible to all the suspects. In an attempt to flush out the murderer, Poirot claims to know more than he does and is nearly pushed under an oncoming train. Poirot decides to show most of the suspects the photos at a party. Mrs Upward claims to have seen the photo of Lily Gamboll, but does not say where.|$|E
500|$|The inquest {{concluded}} in October 2010. Earland, the Exeter and Greater Devon Coroner, recorded a narrative verdict {{and came up}} with several recommendations. Among the recommendations were that Ten Tors participants should undergo more than two training expeditions prior to the main event, that the team managers attain recognised qualifications and that the Health and Safety Executive ensure that independent schools adhere to the same safety standards as state schools. She {{went on to say that}} [...] "It would be a tragedy if [...] was to stop but the public need to be satisfied it is as safe as it reasonably can be, bearing in mind it is what it says, a challenge, not a survival exercise." [...] After the inquest, Shaw's mother stated that she had been helped by the inquest, saying [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> the facts and I'm grateful for that but I am still looking for accountability and some kind of apology and acknowledgement".|$|E

He stated: [...] "Usually, people who have no. 1 hits, even if they give it to you, want hundreds of thousands of dollars, in my experience. But Rihanna gave it to us for a really good price.

2500|$|Evidence {{from the}} Universal-Lexicon of Johann Heinrich Zedler {{indicates}} that Silbermann first built a piano in 1732, {{only a year}} after Cristofori's death. [...] Silbermann may <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> about Cristofori's invention as follows. [...] In 1709, Scipione Maffei did research on the newly invented piano, including an interview with Cristofori, and published his findings (with a ringing endorsement of the instrument) in a 1711 Italian journal article. [...] In 1725, this article was translated into German by the Dresden court poet Johann Ulrich König, who was almost certainly a personal acquaintance of Silbermann.|$|E
2500|$|The {{battle was}} {{conducted}} during the tropical wet season. Average rainfall for December was , although this figure does not lend itself to a full appreciation {{of the impact of}} rain. It was characterised by heavy tropical storms, usually in the afternoon. While the worst of the monsoon held off until after the battle, rain was nonetheless a prevalent feature of the battle. Lieutenant General Robert L. Eichelberger wrote: [...] "At Buna that year it rained about a hundred and seventy inches [...] I <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> since that we got more than our share in December and January 1942–43." [...] Daily rainfall totals of [...] were not uncommon. Under these conditions, the few tracks, seldom more than foot trails, quickly became boggy.|$|E
2500|$|After Ott {{become the}} {{ambassador}} to Japan in April 1938, Sorge had a breakfast with him everyday {{where the two}} discussed in detail German-Japanese relations, and Sorge sometimes drafted the cables that Ott sent under his name to Berlin. Ott trusted Sorge {{so much that he}} sent him out as a German courier to carry secret messages to the German consulates in Canton, Hong Kong, and Manila. Sorge himself noted about his influence in the German Embassy: [...] "They would come to me and say, 'we <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> such and such a thing, have you heard about it and what do you think?'". Of all of Sorge's various relationships with women, the most durable and lastingly was with a Japanese woman Hanako Ishii who tried to curb Sorge's heavy drinking and his habit of recklessly riding his motorcycle around the Japanese countryside in a manner that everyone viewed as almost suicidal.|$|E

2500|$|... "We want to {{add value}} through skills acquisition. But in doing this, we <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> that the main problem is getting finance at {{affordable}} interest rates. The Federal Government talks about this and the banks also talk about it. But I want to state here that the banks have not been helpful. They always say money is available. Where is the money? There is no small scale industrialist who walks into a bank and gets a loan. It is difficult for SMEs to get loans from banks because they always demand for collaterals. The collateral they ask for is {{over and above the}} worth of the loan. So, the banks are not keen on lending to small scale businesses at all. They say this sub-sector is risk infested. They may claim that they have given some amount of money as loans to the SMEs; but you will find out that this is not true. For instance, what can a loan that is given to 2,000 people in a nation of about 167 million people do? The last statistics conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics showed that there were about 17 million small scale industrialists in Nigeria and you are talking about empowering 2,000 people with loans. What is that? So, the banks are paying lip service to funding SMEs." ...|$|E

2500|$|If it weren’t for {{the fact}} that I {{actually}} enjoy conversing with the fans of my prior bands, I would never <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> about a new band called Screeching Weasel beginning to tour. “This can’t be the band I was in.” I say to myself. “I would have been preparing.” [...] My mind would much prefer going to a place of calm contemplation than into a dark cold room filled with anger and the emotions associated with betrayal. So to avoid painful emoting I first took the facts that Ben and I started a band together called Screeching Weasel, we both spent all our days making that band a home for ourselves, and 18 years later we put it to rest. This along with the statement made by both me and Ben on many occasions that the band wouldn’t be Screeching Weasel without either of us, makes me assume that this band playing isn’t Screeching Weasel, because I don’t recall having kicked myself out of the band. So it seems logical that this is not Screeching Weasel. If it were I would have to admit that I longer [...] have friends named Ben Foster or Dan Schafer. As for people like Ben Weasel, Dan Vapid, or even John Jughead, I have nothing to say, because they never really existed, they were just made up names for a bunch of friends that tried to do something different in order to survive and make a living in this world. And I imagine they are all still {{trying to make a living}} somehow, seeing that their band’s prominent “leader” never wanted to tour in order to make it financially viable to continue on.|$|E
