25|$|The player {{character}} can only jump {{and move to}} the left or right, however several different gameplay mechanics are applied to the game depending on the level. For example, one level can be rotated 90 degrees in the direction the player is facing to alter the level's gravity and vertical orientation. A second mechanic involves the use of a rope to swing through a level. Players can wrap the rope around cogs to rotate them. Yet another gameplay mechanic used involves a timer in the upper-right hand corner of the screen. When the timer reaches zero time effectively rewinds backwards the amount of time originally on the clock. The player character is unaffected, however a second, <b>ghost</b> <b>image</b> of the character will follow the movements the player made until the clock expired. This process repeats until the player completes the level. Should the player touch another iteration of the player character they fail the level. Several other mechanics are used throughout the levels, such as objects that change Shuggy's size, and teleportation.|$|E

40|$|Currently clinicians advice {{rotational}} {{panoramic radiography}} (RPR) for preliminary investigation. Despite few inherent limitations, rotational panoramic radiography still remains the diagnostic tool of choice. Abnormal {{structures such as}} a supernumerary tooth or a device falling within the certain central regions in conventional RPR images may mislead the clinicians towards an inaccurate diagnosis by producing multiple <b>ghost</b> <b>images.</b> Such cases must be treated with circumspect, and apart from RPR, additional imaging modalities need be employed to provide a judicious interpretation of the clinical situation. Thus this manuscript, we present a case where a paramedian supernumerary tooth which exhibited double <b>ghost</b> <b>images</b> on a conventional RPR.

40|$|International audienceIn this study, a new {{approach}} is proposed for accurate target identification, required by the phased array radar systems that are employed in through-the-wall imaging applications. In radar imaging, {{the effects of the}} multipath propagation are materialised in fake impressions of the true target, known as <b>ghost</b> <b>images.</b> The developed algorithm removes these ambiguities related to the existence of a target by cancelling, in the final radar <b>image,</b> the <b>ghost</b> <b>images</b> by means of improving the global signal-to-spurious-ratio (SSR) and the target-to-ghost-ratio (TGR) that characterise the real target signature. The development of the approach is based on beamforming and on coherent signal processing upon the returned signal and clutters, for a phased array monostatic radar system. The performances of the algorithm are measured in terms of both the global SSR gain and the TGR and they are verified through simulations and measurements in scenarios that quantify the robustness of the approach. The obtained numerical results concerning the global SSR gain and the TGR certify that the proposed method improves the target localisation and removes the <b>ghost</b> <b>images</b> for radars that operate in rich scattering environments. In the end, the limitations of the approach are also presented...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} an {{experimental}} and theoretical investigation of quantum imaging where {{the images are}} stored in both space and time. <b>Ghost</b> <b>images</b> of remote objects are produced with either one or two beams of chaotic laser light generated by a rotating ground glass and two sensors measuring the reference field and bucket field at different space-time points. We further observe that the <b>ghost</b> <b>images</b> translate depending on the time delay between the sensor measurements. The ghost imaging experiments are performed both with and without turbulence. A discussion of the physics of the space-time imaging is presented in terms of quantum nonlocal two-photon analysis to support the experimental results. The theoretical model includes certain phase factors of the rotating ground glass. These experiments demonstrated a means to investigate the time and space aspects of ghost imaging and showed that ghost imaging contains more information per measured photon than was previously recognized where multiple <b>ghost</b> <b>images</b> are stored within the same ghost imaging data sets. This suggests new pathways to explore quantum information stored not only in multi-photon coincidence information but also in time delayed multi-photon interference. The research is applicable to making enhanced space-time quantum images and videos of moving objects where the images are stored in both space and time...|$|R

40|$|We study {{deflection}} {{of light}} rays and gravitational lensing {{in the regular}} Bardeen no-horizon spacetimes. Flatness of these spacetimes in the central region implies existence of interesting optical effects related to photons crossing the gravitational field of the no-horizon spacetimes with low impact parameters. These effects occur due to existence of a critical impact parameter giving maximal deflection of light rays in the Bardeen no-horizon spacetimes. We give the critical impact parameter in dependence on the specific charge of the spacetimes, and discuss "ghost" direct images of Keplerian discs, generated by photons with low impact parameters. The <b>ghost</b> <b>images</b> can occur only for large inclination angles of distant observers. We determine {{the range of the}} frequency shift of photons genering the <b>ghost</b> <b>images</b> and determine distribution of the frequency shift accross these images. We compare them to those of the standard direct images of the Keplerian discs. The difference of the ranges of the frequency shift on the <b>ghost</b> and direct <b>images</b> could serve as a quantitative measure of the Bardeen no-horizon spacetimes. The regions of the Keplerian discs giving the <b>ghost</b> <b>images</b> are determined in dependence on the specific charge of the no-horizon spacetimes. We can conclude that the optical effects related to the low impact parameter photons give clear signatures of the regular Bardeen no-horizon spacetimes, as no similar phenomena could occur in the black hole or naked singularity spacetimes. Similar phenomena have to occur in any regular no-horizon spacetimes having nearly flat central region...|$|R

40|$|Classical ghost imaging has {{received}} considerable attention {{in recent years}} because of its remarkable ability to image a scene without direct observation by a light-detecting imaging device. In this article, we show that this imaging process is actually a realization of a paradigm known as dual photography, which {{has been shown to}} produce full-color dual (<b>ghost)</b> <b>images</b> of 3 D objects with complex materials without using a traditional imaging device. Specifically, we demonstrate mathematically that the cross-correlation based methods used to recover <b>ghost</b> <b>images</b> are equivalent to the light transport measurement process of dual photography. Because of this, we are able to provide a new explanation for ghost imaging using only classical optics by leveraging the principle of reciprocity in classical electromagnetics. This observation also shows how to leverage previous work on light transport acquisition and dual photography to improve ghost imaging systems in the future. Comment: 6 page...|$|R
