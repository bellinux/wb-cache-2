Analytical electron microscopy (AEM) {{has been used}} to investigate precipitates within MgAl{sub 2 }O{sub 4 } spinel following implantation of Al{sup +}, Mg{sup +}, or Fe{sup 2 +} ions. Combined diffraction experiments, energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS), electron energy-loss spectrometry (EELS), and energy-filtered imaging were employed to identify and characterize precipitates observed in the <b>implanted</b> <b>ion</b> region. Diffraction studies suggested these are metallic aluminum colloids, although EELS and energy-filtered images revealed this to be the case only for the Al{sup +} and Mg{sup +} implantations, and not for Fe{sup 2 +} ion implantations. Multiple-least-squares (MLS) fitting of EELS spectra was employed to quantify the volume fraction of metallic aluminum when present in the <b>implanted</b> <b>ion</b> region. Energy-filtered images of the <b>implanted</b> <b>ion</b> region clearly show the colloid distribution in the Al{sup +} and Mg{sup +} implanted spinel.

We could observe at room temperature the formation of clusters due to the precipitation of the <b>implanted</b> <b>ions.</b> The associated absorption bands (520 nm for sodium and 700 nm for potassium in LiF) indicate that these clusters have a metallic character.
