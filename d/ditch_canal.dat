40|$|The canal {{side weir}} {{system is a}} {{relatively}} new method for water distribution to irrigation furrows. The system consists of a concrete lined <b>ditch</b> (<b>canal),</b> equipped with small openings or weirs which deliver the design irrigation flow rate into individual furrows. This research aims at evaluating the proformance characteristics of this system through laboratory, field, and computer studies. A laboratory model was used to establish head discharge relationships for various weirs at different channel velocities. For sharp entranced weirs, discharge for a given head was found to be inverselly proportional to the magnitude of the channel velocity. At small heads (20 - 30 mm), discharge at 0. 3 m/s velocity was found to be about 15 % less than the corresponding discharge at zero channel velocity. For normal irrigation settings (head on the weir = 60 - 80 mm), the difference was about 6 %. Streamline entranced weirs were found to have negligible sensitivity to changes in the channel velocity. Field evaluation studies revealed better overall proformance than conventional systems. For an operating system, an application efficiency of 86 % with uniformity coefficient of 0. 84 at 7 % deficit was calculated. The components of loss were run-off 4 % and deep percolation 10 %...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{examines}} historical {{trends in}} land-use transformation {{taking place in}} the farm-pond areas, one of the potential ecotourism sites, of Taoyuan Tableland, Taiwan. It demonstrates that irrigation system and urbanization are the key factors undermining and catalyzing changes in pondscape. Therefore, land transactions increased overall transformation of land use in the entire areas. Unregulated urbanization has given rise to complex organic urban structures which predominantly expanding horizontally. The emerging land use pattern indicates a mismatch with the widely pondscapes and farmlands. Land use changes over two time periods, 1926 to 1960 and 1960 to 1999, were analyzed to demonstrate how enforcing land-use policies can influence the direction and magnitude of pondscape change. First, adoption of a grand canal irrigation system has resulted in the internal restructuring of agricultural land use from traditional farm-pond irrigation to more diversified water sources, such as the sources from <b>ditch,</b> <b>canal,</b> or reservoirs. Spatial dependency of pondscape changes could be identified between the northern irrigation system (Taoyuan Main Canal) from 1926 to 1960; and the southern irrigation system (Shihmen Main Canal) from 1960 to 1999, later. The relationship between pond area and pond loss was calculated, illustrated, and discussed. A statistical model, logistic regression, was designed to examine how area-per-se effects of farm ponds have driven their loss in Taoyuan Tableland...|$|E

50|$|The {{preferred}} {{environment for}} the Asian swamp eel includes {{a wide variety of}} freshwater-like shallow wetlands, stagnant waters, marshes, streams, rivers, <b>ditches,</b> <b>canals,</b> lakes, reservoirs, and ponds.

50|$|In Britain, P. obtusifolius {{occurs in}} a range of {{standing}} water habitats including ponds, <b>ditches,</b> <b>canals</b> and shallow lakes, favouring circumneutral or slightly acidic waters. It is strictly a lowland plant and rarely observed in running water, except where current speeds are very slow. Although widely distributed it has a patchy distribution and is not usually abundant at any individual site. Like other fine-leaved pondweeds, P. obtusifolius probably benefits from a certain amount of disturbance to suppress competing vegetation. It seems to favour smaller water bodies and apparently tolerates poor water quality, including turbid water, reasonably well. In spite of this, blunt-leaved pondweed does not usually proliferate in eutrophic lakes. It is possible that this species is rather sensitive to wind action.|$|R
