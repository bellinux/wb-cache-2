The New York Times favored the President's position in an editorial titled [...] "The War of the Naturalists", while some still supported Long and his literary efforts. Long was traveling in Maine when Roosevelt's [...] "Nature Fakers" [...] article was published, and did not respond to the criticisms against him with his past vigor. He later wrote that [...] "the only fakir in the whole controversy, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>judgment,</b> <b>is</b> the big fakir at Washington". Long's literary reputation steadily declined, although he continued to write and publish well into the early 1950s.

[...] And, in the second place, [...] "I think" [...] is not one simple proposition, but three distinct assertions rolled into one.

To put {{all out of}} doubt; the saint, when he hath {{done what}} he can to bring forth good works by faith, yet he dares not show these works before God but as they pass through the Mediator Christ, but as they are washed {{in the blood of}} the Lamb. And {{therefore}} Peter saith, those sacrifices of ours that are truly spiritual are only then accepted of God, when offered up by Jesus Christ (1 Peter 2:5). And therefore it is said again, that the prayers of the saints, which are the fruits of faith, come up before the throne of God through the angel's hand; that is, through the hand of Christ, through his golden censer, perfumed with his incense, made acceptable by his intercession (Rev 8:3,4). It is said in the Book of Revelation, that it is granted to the bride, the Lamb's wife, that she should be 'arrayed in fine linen, clean and white; which white linen is the righteousness of saints.' This fine linen, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>judgment,</b> <b>is</b> the works of godly men, their works that sprang from faith. But how came they clean? How came they white? Not simply because they were the works of faith. But mark, they 'washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.' And 'therefore they stand before the throne of God' (Rev 7:14,15). Yea, therefore it is that their good works stand there too.|$|E
60|$|Roebuck {{brought forward}} his motion. Mr. Gladstone {{resisted}} it {{on behalf of}} the government with immense argumentative force, and he put the point against Lord John which explains the word 'untrue' in the passage just quoted, namely, that though he desired in November the substitution of Palmerston for Newcastle as war minister, he had given it up in December, and yet this vital fact was omitted.[340] It was not for the government, he said, either to attempt to make terms with the House by reconstruction of a cabinet, or to shrink from any judgment of the House upon their acts. If they had so shrunk, he exclaimed, {{this is the sort of}} epitaph that he would expect to have written over their remains: 'Here lie the dishonoured ashes of a ministry that found England in peace and left in it war, that was content to enjoy the emoluments of office and to wield the sceptre of power, so long as no man had the courage to question their existence: they saw the storm gathering over the country; they heard the agonising accounts that were almost daily received of the sick and wounded in the East. These things did not move them, but so soon as a member of opposition raised his hand to point the thunderbolt, they became conscience-stricken into a sense of guilt, and hoping to escape punishment, they ran away from duty.' Such would be their epitaph. Of the proposed inquiry itself,--an inquiry into the conduct of generals and troops actually in the field, and fighting by the side of, and in concert with, foreign allies, he observed--'Your inquiry will never take place as a real inquiry; or, if it did, it would lead to nothing but confusion and disturbance, increased disasters, shame at home and weakness abroad; it would convey no consolation to those whom you seek to aid, but it would carry malignant joy to the hearts of the enemies of England; and, for my part, I shall ever rejoice, if this motion is carried to-night, that my own last words as a member of the cabinet of the Earl of Aberdeen have been words of solemn and earnest protest against a proceeding which has no foundation either in the constitution or in the practice of preceding parliaments; which is useless and mischievous for the purpose which it appears to contemplate; and which, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>judgment,</b> <b>is</b> full of danger to the power, dignity, and usefulness of the Commons of England.' A journalistic observer, while deploring the speaker's adherence to 'the dark dogmatisms of medieval religionists,' admits that he had never heard so fine a speech. The language, he says, was devoid of redundance. The attitude was calm. Mr. Gladstone seemed to feel that he rested upon the magnitude of the argument, and had no need of the assistance of bodily vehemence of manner. His voice was clear, distinct, and flexible, without monotony. It was minute dissection without bitterness or ill-humoured innuendo. He sat down amid immense applause from hearers admiring but unconvinced. Mr. Gladstone himself records of this speech: 'Hard and heavy work, especially as to the cases of three persons: Lord John Russell, Duke of Newcastle, and Lord Raglan.' Ministers were beaten (January 29) by 325 to 148, and they resigned.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to prove that the Fabians were a {{political}} pressure group and that Fabian methods were responsible for the enactment of the 1902 Education Act that nationalized education in England. Also that Sidney Webb played far greater and more significant part in the formulation of the actual Bill than did Robert Morant, who is usually credited as the person responsible for the Bill. It seemed to me that it was necessary to trace the evolving educational system in England; therefore, I made the arbitrary decision of beginning with the “Sunday school” which I view as the beginning of 2 ̆ 2 education for all. ” It was necessary to select the elements of the social and political affairs that I felt pertained to the subject as I dealt with it. There are situations that have been omitted, and there were times when it was difficult not to digress into areas of lesser significance. Therefore, the paper is divided into two sections: the first section traces the historical pattern of the emergence of education for the common people; the second section is devoted to the active involvement of the Fabians and covers a much shorter span historically. The first part of the paper traces the dual system of education that consisted of the “board” schools, which date from 1870, and the “voluntary” schools. Although the “voluntary” schools are as old as the Christian Church in England, the development of the “voluntary 2 ̆ 2 system for the {{purpose of this}} paper, begins at the time of the Wesleyan rift with the Church of England. It was from that time that the voluntary schools developed into “denominational” schools and as a consequence, reflect the power struggle that developed between the landed gentry and the entrepreneurs as a result of industrialization. Throughout the nineteenth century, the ever extending franchise brought with it an increasing demand for change in the educational system in England. The second part of this paper deals with the manner in which the Fabians, as a pressure group, influenced the enactment of the 1902 Education Act. It is my thesis that the basic structure of the act was outlined originally by Sidney Webb and that Fabian Tract No. 106 was the primary model used by the Conservative government in formulating the Bill. Inasmuch as the educational system of England is still in the process of fulfilling the suggestions contained in the Act of 1902, perhaps from an historian 2 ̆ 7 s standpoint, it is too early to be definitive concerning the role of the Fabians. Nevertheless, enough material about the Fabians is available to prove their influence in securing the enactment of the Bill. Much more work needs to be done on the Fabians. They were a remarkable group of men and women whose impact <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>judgment,</b> <b>is</b> far greater than we are able, at present, to measure. Party politics are of recent origin and the Fabians belong to what some political scientists have termed the “third house” in the legislative process. The Fabians are a pressure group and the activity they carried on in regard to the Education Act, in my view, was a form of lobbying. It is from this viewpoint that I have dealt with the Fabians in this paper...|$|E
