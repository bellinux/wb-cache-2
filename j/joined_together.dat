5|$|A Holliday {{junction}} is a branched {{nucleic acid}} structure that contains four double-stranded arms <b>joined</b> <b>together.</b> These arms may adopt {{one of several}} conformations depending on buffer salt concentrations and the sequence of nucleobases closest to the junction. The structure is named after the molecular biologist Robin Holliday, who proposed its existence in 1964.|$|E

5|$|A signal {{travelling}} {{along an}} electrical transmission line will be partly, or wholly, reflected {{back in the}} opposite direction when the travelling signal encounters a discontinuity in the characteristic impedance of the line, or if {{the far end of the}} line is not terminated in its characteristic impedance. This can happen, for instance, if two lengths of dissimilar transmission lines are <b>joined</b> <b>together.</b>|$|E

5|$|Federer has a {{contract}} with Nike footwear and apparel. For the 2006 championships at Wimbledon, Nike designed a jacket emblazoned with a crest of three tennis racquets, symbolising the three Wimbledon Championships he had previously won, and which was updated the next year with four racquets after he won the Championship in 2006. At Wimbledon 2008, and again in 2009, Nike continued this trend by making him a personalised cardigan that also had his own logo, an R and an F <b>joined</b> <b>together.</b>|$|E

In most tetrapod species, there are two paired thyroid glands – that is, {{the right and left}} lobes are not <b>joined</b> <b>together.</b> However, there is only ever a single thyroid gland in most mammals, and the shape found in humans is common to many other species.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{structures}} that make up animals, plants and microbes are made from three basic classes of molecule: amino acids, carbohydrates and lipids (often called fats). As these molecules are vital for life, metabolic reactions either focus on making these molecules during the construction of cells and tissues, or by breaking them down and using them {{as a source of}} energy, by their digestion. These biochemicals can be <b>joined</b> <b>together</b> to make polymers such as DNA and proteins, essential macromolecules of life.|$|E
5|$|The Danish Music Awards (DMA) is a Danish award show. The {{show has}} been {{arranged}} by IFPI since 1989, and was originally called IFPI-prisen ("IFPI-Award") until 1991, when it {{changed its name}} to Dansk Grammy ("Danish Grammy"). The current name was given in 2001, after the American Grammy Awards registered the name Grammy as their trademark. In 2011 IFPI <b>joined</b> <b>together</b> with TV2 (Denmark) and KODA to present the awards ceremony. Adele has received one award from one nomination.|$|E

5|$|The {{house is}} built with stone foundations, {{and the main}} {{structure}} is made of oak timbers, <b>joined</b> <b>together</b> using mortice and tenon joints, and held in place with oak pegs. Wattle and daub or lath and plaster are used to fill the spaces between the timbers. The black and white appearance from the timber framing construction dates from the Tudor period, though some parts have been repaired in later years.|$|E

He also guest-starred on several television shows, including an appearance in an episode of the television series The King of Queens in a flashback {{as the father of}} the character Arthur (played by Jerry Stiller). He also made a guest appearance on World Wrestling Entertainment's WWE Raw.|$|E
5|$|Clathrus ruber is {{the type}} species of the genus Clathrus, and {{is part of the}} group of Clathrus species known as the Laternoid series. Common {{features}} uniting this group include the vertical arms of the receptacle (fruit body) that are not <b>joined</b> <b>together</b> at the base, and the spongy structure of the receptacle. According to a molecular analysis published in 2006, out of the about 40 Phallales species used in the study, C.ruber is most closely related to Aseroe rubra, Clathrus archeri, Laternea triscapa, and Clathrus chrysomycelinus.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} {{to calls for}} action from the Drapier in the second letter, a group of bankers <b>joined</b> <b>together</b> on 17 August 1724, agreeing in writing {{that they would not}} accept the coin produced under Wood's patent. Other merchants and tradesmen followed in a similar fashion. However, this did not stop Walpole from ordering the Commissioners of the Revenue in Ireland to enter the coin into the Irish economy. Regardless of Walpole's orders, the Irish Lord Justices did not act, Lord Shannon did not command that his troops should be issued Wood's coin, and Middleton's House of Lords and Conolly's House of Commons did not pass any resolution backing up Walpole's order, which effectively prevented the coin from being distributed.|$|E

5|$|Ireland's {{geologic}} history covers {{everything from}} volcanism and tropical seas {{to the last}} glacial period. Ireland was formed in two distinct parts and slowly <b>joined</b> <b>together,</b> uniting about 440 million years ago. As a result of tectonics {{and the effect of}} ice, the sea level has risen and fallen. In every area of the country the rocks which formed {{can be seen as a}} result. Finally, the impact of the glaciers shaped the landscape seen today. This variation in the two areas along with the differences between volcanic areas and shallow seas gives Ireland a range of soils as well. There are wide bogs and free-draining brown earths. The mountains are granite, sandstone, limestone with karst areas, and basalt formations.|$|E
5|$|Many {{anthozoans}} are {{colonial and}} consist of multiple polyps {{with a common}} origin <b>joined</b> <b>together</b> by living material. The simplest arrangement is where a stolon runs along the substrate in a two dimensional lattice with polyps budding off at intervals. Alternatively, polyps may bud off from a sheet of living tissue, the coenosarc, which joins the polyps and anchors the colony to the substrate. The coenosarc may consist of a thin membrane from which the polyps project, as in most stony corals, or a thick fleshy mass in which the polyps are immersed apart from their oral discs, as in the soft corals.|$|E
5|$|Many {{buildings}} did {{not hold}} up to the shaking of the earthquake and those that did collapse often lacked any survival space, but lack of effective medical care and poor planning {{also contributed to the}} substantial scope of the disaster. Buildings that didn't collapse featured well-maintained masonry and skeletal components that were <b>joined</b> <b>together</b> adequately in a way that allowed for the building to resist seismic waves. Most bridges and tunnels and other public infrastructure withstood the earthquake but hospitals did not fare well. Most collapsed, killing two-thirds of the doctors, destroying equipment and medicine, and reducing the capacity to handle the critical medical needs in the region.|$|E
