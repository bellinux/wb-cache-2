5|$|The Antarctic sheet {{is divided}} by the Transantarctic Mountains into two unequal {{sections}} known as the East Antarctic <b>ice</b> <b>sheet</b> (EAIS) and the smaller West Antarctic <b>Ice</b> <b>Sheet</b> (WAIS). The EAIS rests on a major land mass but {{the bed of the}} WAIS is, in places, more than 2,500 metres below sea level. It would be seabed if the <b>ice</b> <b>sheet</b> were not there. The WAIS is classified as a marine-based <b>ice</b> <b>sheet,</b> meaning that its bed lies below sea level and its edges flow into floating ice shelves. The WAIS is bounded by the Ross Ice Shelf, the Ronne Ice Shelf, and outlet glaciers that drain into the Amundsen Sea.|$|E
5|$|The Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers {{are two of}} Antarctica's five largest ice streams. Scientists {{have found}} that the flow of these ice streams has {{accelerated}} in recent years, and suggested that if they were to melt, global sea levels would rise by , destabilising the entire West Antarctic <b>Ice</b> <b>Sheet</b> and perhaps sections of the East Antarctic <b>Ice</b> <b>Sheet.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{scenario}} {{consistent with}} the phylogenetic, <b>ice</b> <b>sheet</b> size, and sea-level depth data is that during the Late Pleistocene the sea levels were at their lowest. A single wave of wolf colonization into North America commenced {{with the opening of}} the Bering land bridge 70,000YBP. It ended with the closing of the Yukon corridor that ran along the division between the Laurentide <b>Ice</b> <b>Sheet</b> and the Cordilleran <b>Ice</b> <b>Sheet</b> 23,000YBP during the Late Glacial Maximum. As wolves had been in the fossil record of North America but the genetic ancestry of modern wolves could be traced back only 80,000 years, the wolf haplotypes that were already in North America were replaced by these invaders, either through competitive displacement or through genetic admixture. The replacement in North America of a basal population of wolves by a more recent one is {{consistent with the}} findings of earlier studies.|$|E
50|$|Glaciology is {{the study}} of glaciers and <b>ice</b> <b>sheets,</b> or more {{commonly}} the cryosphere or ice and phenomena that involve ice. Glaciology groups the latter (<b>ice</b> <b>sheets)</b> as continental glaciers and the former (glaciers) as alpine glaciers. Although, research in the areas are similar with research undertaken into both the dynamics of <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> and glaciers the former tends to be concerned with the interaction of <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> with the present climate and the latter with the impact of glaciers on the landscape. Glaciology also has a vast array of sub-fields examining the factors and processes involved in <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> and glaciers e.g. snow hydrology and glacial geology.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Changes in tilt of Mars's axis. At {{times it}} tilts {{so far that}} it has {{equatorial}} <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> instead of the more usual polar ice caps. The sub surface <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> in the equatorial regions, if they exist, may be remnants of these larger <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> from the past.|$|R
25|$|<b>Ice</b> <b>sheets</b> {{that form}} during glaciations cause {{erosion of the}} land beneath them. After some time, this will reduce land above sea level and thus {{diminish}} the amount of space on which <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> can form. This mitigates the albedo feedback, as does the lowering in sea level that accompanies the formation of <b>ice</b> <b>sheets.</b>|$|R
5|$|Gerard Bond {{suggests}} {{that changes in}} the flux of solar energy on a 1,500-year scale may be correlated to the Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles, and in turn the Heinrich events; however the small magnitude {{of the change in}} energy makes such an exo-terrestrial factor unlikely to have the required large effects, at least without huge positive feedback processes acting within the Earth system. However, rather than the warming itself melting the ice, it is possible that sea-level change associated with the warming destabilised ice shelves. A rise in sea level could begin to corrode the bottom of an <b>ice</b> <b>sheet,</b> undercutting it; when one <b>ice</b> <b>sheet</b> failed and surged, the ice released would further raise sea levels, and further destabilizing other ice sheets. In favour of this theory is the non-simultaneity of <b>ice</b> <b>sheet</b> break-up in H1, H2, H4, and H5, where European breakup preceded European melting by up to 1,500years (Maslin et al. 2001).|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{territory}} is covered by the Antarctic <b>ice</b> <b>sheet,</b> and a tall ice wall stretches throughout its coast. In some areas further within the <b>ice</b> <b>sheet,</b> mountain ranges breach through the ice, allowing for birds to breed {{and the growth of}} a limited flora. The region is divided into the Princess Martha Coast, Princess Astrid Coast, Princess Ragnhild Coast, Prince Harald Coast and Prince Olav Coast. The waters off the coast are called the King Haakon VII Sea.|$|E
5|$|Results {{published}} in 2009 of radar {{measurements of the}} north polar ice cap determined that the volume of water ice in the cap is , equal to 30% of the Earth's Greenland <b>ice</b> <b>sheet.</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{educational}} brief {{describes the}} nature and properties of the Greenland and Antarctica <b>ice</b> <b>sheets.</b> Topics include the thickness and aereal extent of the <b>ice</b> <b>sheets,</b> volume of water contained in them, mass balance, and the mechanisms by which ice is lost from or accumulated by the <b>ice</b> <b>sheets.</b> Educational levels: High school, Middle school...|$|R
50|$|<b>Ice</b> <b>sheets</b> and <b>ice</b> caps cover vast {{areas and}} are {{unconstrained}} by the underlying topography having a radial flow. The main {{distinction between the}} two is the size of their surface, with ice caps covering areas less than 50,000 square kilometers, while <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> span larger areas. <b>Ice</b> <b>sheets</b> and <b>ice</b> caps can be classified further.|$|R
25|$|The current ice age, the Pliocene-Quaternary {{glaciation}}, {{started about}} 2.58 {{million years ago}} during the late Pliocene, when the spread of <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> in the Northern Hemisphere began. Since then, the world has seen cycles of glaciation with <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> advancing and retreating on 40,000- and 100,000-year time scales called glacial periods, glacials or glacial advances, and interglacial periods, interglacials or glacial retreats. The earth is currently in an interglacial, and the last glacial period ended about 10,000 years ago. All that remains of the continental <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> are the Greenland and Antarctic <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> and smaller glaciers such as on Baffin Island.|$|R
5|$|West Antarctica {{is covered}} by the West Antarctic <b>Ice</b> <b>Sheet.</b> The sheet has been of recent concern because of the real, if small, {{possibility}} of its collapse. If the sheet were to break down, ocean levels would rise by several metres in a relatively geologically short period of time, perhaps a matter of centuries. Several Antarctic ice streams, which account for about 10% of the <b>ice</b> <b>sheet,</b> flow {{to one of the}} many Antarctic ice shelves: see ice-sheet dynamics.|$|E
5|$|A {{polar ice}} cap, or polar <b>ice</b> <b>sheet,</b> is a high-latitude region {{of a planet}} or moon that is covered in ice. Ice caps form because high-latitude regions receive less energy as solar {{radiation}} from the sun than equatorial regions, resulting in lower surface temperatures.|$|E
5|$|During the Late Devensian glaciation, which {{occurred}} 28,000 to 14,700 years Before Present (BP), {{the whole of}} northern England was covered by an <b>ice</b> <b>sheet.</b> Helvellyn {{was one of a}} small number of nunataks which protruded above the ice.|$|E
50|$|Vast <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> covered much of North America, {{northern}} Europe, and Asia. The <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> profoundly affected Earth's climate by causing drought, desertification, and {{a dramatic}} drop in sea levels. It {{was followed by}} the Late Glacial.|$|R
40|$|The Center for Remote Sensing of <b>Ice</b> <b>Sheets</b> (CReSIS) {{provides}} {{links to}} educational materials {{that focus on}} topics related to global climate change and remote sensing, particularly changes in continental <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> and glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica. K- 12 education resources include links to materials (including lesson plans) on <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> and glaciers, global climate change, robotics, and mapping and modeling. Educational levels: Primary elementary, Intermediate elementary, Middle school, High school...|$|R
50|$|The {{height of}} the land mass above sea level also plays an {{important}} role, especially after <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> have been established. A higher elevation allows <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> to remain with more stability, but a lower elevation allows <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> to develop more readily. The Caradocian is considered to have a lower surface elevation, and though {{it would be better}} for initiation during high CO2, it would have a harder time maintaining glacial coverage.|$|R
5|$|Meteorites from Antarctica are an {{important}} area of study of material formed early in the solar system; most are thought to come from asteroids, but some may have originated on larger planets. The first meteorite was found in 1912, and named the Adelie Land meteorite. In 1969, a Japanese expedition discovered nine meteorites. Most of these meteorites have fallen onto the <b>ice</b> <b>sheet</b> in the last million years. Motion of the <b>ice</b> <b>sheet</b> tends to concentrate the meteorites at blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall. Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth, the Antarctic meteorites are well-preserved.|$|E
5|$|Antarctica {{is home to}} {{more than}} 70 lakes that lie {{at the base of the}} {{continental}} <b>ice</b> <b>sheet.</b> Lake Vostok, discovered beneath Russia's Vostok Station in 1996, is the largest of these subglacial lakes. It was once believed that the lake had been sealed off for 500,000 to one million years but a recent survey suggests that, every so often, there are large flows of water from one lake to another.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the last}} ice age the eastern {{coastline}} of the area was located along the eastern foot of the Yorkshire Wolds where remnants of beaches have been discovered. The North Sea <b>ice</b> <b>sheet</b> deposited huge amounts of boulder clay as it retreated and this subsequently formed a wet and swampy area which became the plain of Holderness. Another <b>ice</b> <b>sheet</b> in the Vale of York retreated at the same time leaving thick glacial deposits and two prominent moraines {{to the west of the}} Wolds. These Vale of York deposits also formed wetlands. The Wolds themselves were largely ice-free, well drained, chalk uplands. Gradually the tundra conditions that had existed as the ice retreated gave way to vegetation that could support grazing fauna. Because a lot of water was still locked in the northern ice sheets, sea level was much lower than in the present day and an area of land stretched eastwards to the low countries.|$|E
50|$|The {{constant}} freezing temperatures {{cause the}} formation of large <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> in <b>ice</b> cap climates. These <b>ice</b> <b>sheets,</b> however, are not static, but slowly move off the continents into the surrounding waters. New snow and ice accumulation then replaces the ice that is lost. Precipitation is nearly non-existent in ice cap climates. It is never warm enough for rain, and usually too cold to generate snow. However, wind can blow snow onto the <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> from nearby tundras.|$|R
5|$|It is {{possible}} that a panmictic (random mating) wolf population, with gene flow spanning Eurasia and North America, existed until {{the closing of the}} <b>ice</b> <b>sheets,</b> after which the southern wolves became isolated, and only the Beringian wolf existed north of the sheets. The land bridge became inundated by the sea 10,000YBP, and the <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> receded 12,000—6,000YBP. The Beringian wolf became extinct, and the southern wolves expanded through the shrinking <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> to recolonize the northern part of North America. All North American wolves are descended from those that were once isolated south of the <b>ice</b> <b>sheets.</b> However, much of their diversity was later lost during the twentieth century due to eradication.|$|R
40|$|<b>Ice</b> <b>sheets</b> of Greenland and Antarctica {{are uniquely}} arresting and {{captivating}} {{features of the}} Earth’s natural environment. The hyperbole attached to their description, their sheer size and remoteness from the normal lives of most of us, guarantees their iconic status, but the emerging understanding that <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> contain a threat, which cannot be fully evaluated mean, that they have become a central issue in the climate change debate. However, while global climate has undoubtedly warmed during the recent past, and human activity {{has been a major}} factor in this change, the role of <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> as indicators of climate change and as influential components in the planets climate engine, is a complex one (Fig. 1). This chapter will discuss the position of the great <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> within the climate change debate, contrasting the differing risks posed to sea-level rise by the Greenland and Antarctic <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> as likely contributors to future sea-level rise, and how they may differently influence the wider debate on limiting greenhouse-gas emissions...|$|R
5|$|Due to its {{location}} at the South Pole, Antarctica receives relatively little solar radiation. This {{means that it}} is a very cold continent where water is mostly in the form of ice. Precipitation is low (most of Antarctica is a desert) and almost always in the form of snow, which accumulates and forms a giant <b>ice</b> <b>sheet</b> which covers the land. Parts of this <b>ice</b> <b>sheet</b> form moving glaciers known as ice streams, which flow towards the edges of the continent. Next to the continental shore are many ice shelves. These are floating extensions of outflowing glaciers from the continental ice mass. Offshore, temperatures are also low enough that ice is formed from seawater through most of the year. It is important to understand the various types of Antarctic ice to understand possible effects on sea levels and the implications of global cooling.|$|E
5|$|East Antarctica {{lies on the}} Indian Ocean side of the Transantarctic Mountains and {{comprises}} Coats Land, Queen Maud Land, Enderby Land, Mac. Robertson Land, Wilkes Land, and Victoria Land. All but a {{small portion}} of this region lies within the Eastern Hemisphere. East Antarctica is largely covered by the East Antarctic <b>Ice</b> <b>Sheet.</b>|$|E
5|$|From this core, {{specifically}} from {{ice that}} {{is thought to}} have formed from lake water freezing onto the base of the <b>ice</b> <b>sheet,</b> extremophile microbes were found, suggesting that the lake water supports life. Scientists suggested that the lake could possess a unique habitat for ancient bacteria with an isolated microbial gene pool containing characteristics developed perhaps 500,000years ago.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{global warming}} has caused {{mountain}} glaciers and the <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> in Greenland and Antarctica to melt and global sea level to rise. Therefore, monitoring sea level rise {{and the mass}} balance of <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> and glaciers allows people to understand more about global warming.|$|R
5000|$|Even after [...] {{emissions}} are lowered, the melting of <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> would continue, and further increase sea-level rise for centuries. Because of slow transport of heat into the oceans {{and the slow}} response time of <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> until the new system equilibrium has been reached.|$|R
5000|$|Catabatic {{winds are}} most {{commonly}} found blowing {{out from the}} large and elevated <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> of Antarctica and Greenland. The buildup of high density cold air over the <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> and the elevation of the <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> brings into play enormous gravitational energy. Where these winds are concentrated into restricted areas in the coastal valleys, the winds blow well over hurricane force, reaching around 300 km/h. [...] In Greenland these winds are called piteraq and are most intense whenever a low pressure area approaches the coast.|$|R
5|$|In 2008, the British Antarctic Survey {{reported}} a volcanic eruption under the Antarctica <b>ice</b> <b>sheet</b> 2,200 years ago. It {{is believed to}} be that this was the biggest eruption in Antarctica in the last 10,000 years. Volcanic ash deposits from the volcano were identified through an airborne radar survey, buried under later snowfalls in the Hudson Mountains, close to Pine Island Glacier.|$|E
5|$|In January 2008 British Antarctic Survey (BAS) scientists, led by Hugh Corr and David Vaughan, {{reported}} (in {{the journal}} Nature Geoscience) that 2,200 years ago, a volcano erupted under Antarctica's <b>ice</b> <b>sheet</b> (based on airborne survey with radar images). The biggest eruption in Antarctica {{in the last}} 10,000 years, the volcanic ash was found deposited on the ice surface under the Hudson Mountains, close to Pine Island Glacier.|$|E

Corr and Vaughan were able to map this ash layer using an airborne radar system and calculate the date of the eruption from the depth of burial of the ash. This method uses dates calculated from nearby ice cores. The presence of the volcano raises the possibility that volcanic activity could have contributed, or may contribute in the future, to increases in the flow of the glacier.|$|E

25|$|The {{geological}} record {{appears to}} show that ice ages start when the continents are in positions which block or reduce the flow of warm water from the equator to the poles and thus allow <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> to form. The <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> increase Earth's reflectivity and thus reduce the absorption of solar radiation. With less radiation absorbed the atmosphere cools; the cooling allows the <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> to grow, which further increases reflectivity in a positive feedback loop. The ice age continues until the reduction in weathering causes {{an increase in the}} greenhouse effect.|$|R
