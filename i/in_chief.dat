5|$|Blamey was {{appointed}} Commander <b>in</b> <b>Chief</b> of the Australian Military Forces on 27 March. He instituted a sweeping reorganisation of the Army, replacing officers {{with men who}} had experience in the Middle East. Simpson became the Signal Officer <b>in</b> <b>Chief</b> on 6 April, with the rank of major general, the first Australian Corps of Signals officer to reach that rank.|$|E
5|$|Herring was {{promoted}} to the temporary rank of major general on 14August1941 {{when he took over}} command of the 6th Division. He returned to Australia with it in March 1942. Unaware that the government had already decided that General Sir Thomas Blamey should be appointed Commander <b>in</b> <b>Chief,</b> Herring, along with Major General George Alan Vasey and Brigadier Clive Steele, approached Army Minister Frank Forde with a proposal that all officers over the age of 50 be immediately retired and Major General Horace Robertson appointed Commander <b>in</b> <b>Chief.</b> The 'revolt of the generals' collapsed with the announcement that General Blamey was returning from the Middle East to become Commander <b>in</b> <b>Chief,</b> but seems to have done the participants no harm.|$|E
5|$|As the {{prospect}} of war with Japan became more likely, so also did {{the need to make}} appropriate arrangements for leading the defence of Australia. In 1935, Lavarack had recommended that in the event of war, the Military Board be abolished and its powers vested in a Commander-in-chief. In April 1941, the Minister for the Army, Percy Spender, recommended that this now be done, with Sturdee becoming Commander <b>in</b> <b>Chief</b> of the Australian Military Forces. Instead, the government elected to adopt the British system, in which the Military Board (or Army Council as it was called there) continued to operate, with a separate GOC Home Forces. On 5 August 1941, Major General Sir Iven Mackay was appointed to this newly created post. However, the idea of a Commander <b>in</b> <b>Chief</b> did not go away and editorials in the Sunday Telegraph and The Sydney Morning Herald advocated the appointment.|$|E

5|$|In {{the days}} before Poland was invaded by Germany in September 1939, and during the {{invasion}} itself, Sikorski's request for a military command continued to be denied by the Polish Commander <b>in</b> <b>Chief,</b> Marshal Edward Rydz-Śmigły. Sikorski escaped through Romania to Paris, where on 28 September he joined Władysław Raczkiewicz and Stanisław Mikołajczyk in a Polish government-in-exile, taking command of the newly formed Polish Armed Forces in France. Two days later, on September 30, president Raczkiewicz called him {{to serve as the}} first Polish prime minister in exile. On 7 November he became Commander <b>in</b> <b>Chief</b> and General Inspector of the Armed Forces (Naczelny Wódz i Generalny Inspektor Sił Zbrojnych), following Rydz-Śmigły's resignation. Sikorski would also hold the position of the Polish Minister of Military Affairs, thus uniting in his person all control over the Polish military in war time.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the {{establishment}} of USSOCOM provided its own measure of excitement. A quick solution to manning and basing a brand new unified command was to abolish an existing command. United States Readiness Command (USREDCOM), with an often misunderstood mission, {{did not appear to}} have a viable mission in the post Goldwater-Nichols era, and its Commander <b>in</b> <b>Chief,</b> General James Lindsay, had had some special operations experience. On 23 January 1987, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended to the Secretary of Defense that USREDCOM be disestablished to provide billets and facilities for USSOCOM. President Ronald Reagan approved {{the establishment}} of the new command on 13 April 1987. The Department of Defense activated USSOCOM on 16 April 1987 and nominated General Lindsay to be the first Commander <b>in</b> <b>Chief</b> Special Operations Command (USCINCSOC). The Senate accepted him without debate.|$|E
