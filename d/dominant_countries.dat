25|$|Militarily {{established}} and holding {{control over the}} Umayyad government, many Sunni rulers perceived the Shia as a threat– to both their political and their religious authority. The Sunni rulers under the Umayyads sought to marginalize the Shia minority, and later the Abbasids turned on their Shia allies and imprisoned, persecuted, and killed them. The persecution of the Shia throughout history by Sunni co-religionists has often been characterized by brutal and genocidal acts. Comprising only about 10–15% of the entire Muslim population, the Shia remain a marginalized community to this day in many Sunni Arab <b>dominant</b> <b>countries</b> without the rights to practice their religion and organize.|$|E

One can recognize affective labor, for example, in the work of legal assistants, flight attendants, and fast food workers (service with a smile). One indication of the rising importance of affective labor, at least in the <b>dominant</b> <b>countries,</b> is the tendency for employers to highlight education, attitude, character, and [...] "prosocial" [...] behavior as the primary skills employees need.

Then it internationalized to a particular degree when it moved out of Islamic <b>dominant</b> <b>countries</b> and cultures and came to many countries in the West, a period from c.1892 to c.1953.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{looks at}} the {{developmental}} consequences of aid flows on the Great Lakes region in Africa. Our main hypothesis is that political considerations and donor coordination problems still {{play an important role}} in directing aid and is much less dependent on objective criteria such as the need for aid or good governance. The region of the Great Lakes in Africa is a good illustration of the 'darlings' versus 'orphans' policy of official development assistance (ODA). Departing somewhat from the dominant pessimist stance on the effectiveness of aid in sub-Sahara Africa we will try to show that overall, the costs of exclusion of certain countries from aid are detrimental for human development. In order to avoid this inclusion/exclusion pattern of aid, a regional donor approach should overarch the <b>dominant</b> <b>country</b> by country donor policy...|$|R
