5|$|Plan after plan is thwarted: Elaine tries bribing the maître d'hôtel, but is unsuccessful. They {{contemplate}} {{on getting}} food to go, but they can't eat Chinese {{food in a}} taxicab. Elaine is ravenous, but refuses to eat concession stand food at the movie theater. After missing Tatiana's call, George decides he's {{no longer in the}} mood for the film, Elaine wants to leave and get a hamburger, and Jerry decides that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> well have dinner with his uncle. As soon as they leave, the maître d' calls their party.|$|E

Kankkunen {{finished}} eighth and Räikkönen 25th due to car trouble. He finished seventh in the Rallye Deutschland, his second ever asphalt rally, while notching up his first ever career stage win, the last stage of the rally.|$|E

25|$|An {{area where}} African Americans in general {{outstrip}} whites {{is in their}} condemnation of homosexuality. Prominent leaders in the Black church have demonstrated against gay rights issues such as gay marriage. This stands {{in stark contrast to}} the down-low phenomenon of covert male–male sexual acts. There are those within the community who take a different position, notably the late Coretta Scott King and the Reverend Al Sharpton, the latter of whom, when asked in 2003 whether he supported gay marriage, replied that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> well have been asked if he supported black marriage or white marriage.|$|E
25|$|With {{his freedom}} restored, the Doctor chose to {{counteract}} his extended exile by seeking as much non-human company as possible. During this period, the Doctor encountered {{all manner of}} unusual beings – from a species that at cursory glance resembled the Earth tiger (The Year of Intelligent Tigers), to water spirits, to talking apes from another dimension. Though at times the Doctor seemed somewhat cold – as when he seemed more concerned about damaged plums than a dead man (Eater of Wasps) – he retained his passion for life in all forms. Although his amnesia remained a bother, the Doctor acknowledged that whatever {{had happened to him}} had happened for a reason, and <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> well make use of the advantages it offered.|$|E
500|$|Cobain {{chose not}} to overdub a harmony vocal part during the Smart Studios sessions, {{possibly}} due to time constraints. During the Nevermind sessions, Vig had Grohl sing harmonies on the song. Grohl had difficulty hitting the proper notes, but ultimately was able to sing what Vig wanted. Vig often had to trick Cobain, who was averse to performing multiple takes, into recording additional takes for overdubs on the record. The producer convinced Cobain to double-track his vocals on [...] "In Bloom" [...] by telling him, [...] "John Lennon did it." [...] After doubling Cobain's vocals, Vig decided <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> well double Grohl's and had the drummer record an additional track of backing harmonies.|$|E

500|$|The {{small crowd}} in Worcester were {{angered by the}} decision, and Worcestershire's {{secretary}} Mike Vockins gave all those present a full refund while describing Somerset's declaration as [...] "an absolute disgrace". Some Somerset fans had travelled over [...] to watch the game, while Alan Gibson of The Times (although note that this paper was on strike at the time) had only just arrived at the railway station when he was told by a porter that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> well head back as the match had finished. The Somerset team left the ground within 14 minutes {{of the end of}} the game. As they were leaving, one spectator banged on Rose's car window and shouted at him, [...] "You've done a terrible thing for cricket." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Gadsden's {{antagonistic}} manner" [...] alienated Santa Anna. [...] Gadsden {{had advised}} Santa Anna that [...] "the {{spirit of the}} age" [...] would soon lead the northern states to secede so <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> well sell them now. The Mexican President felt threatened by William Walker's attempt to capture Baja California with 50 troops and annex Sonora. Gadsden disavowed any government backing of Walker, who was expelled by the U.S. and placed on trial as a criminal. [...] Santa Anna worried that the US would allow further aggression against [...] Mexican territory. [...] Santa Anna needed {{to get as much}} money for as little territory as possible. [...] When Great Britain rejected Mexican requests to assist in the negotiations, Santa Anna opted for the $15 million package (equivalent to $ in [...] ).|$|E
500|$|Theroux {{described}} approaching filming without entirely {{understanding what}} the plot was about: [...] "You {{get the whole}} script, but <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> well withhold the scenes you're not in, because the whole {{turns out to be}} more mystifying than the parts. David welcomes questions, but he won't answer any of them... You work kind of half-blindfolded. If he were a first-time director and hadn't demonstrated any command of this method, I'd probably have reservations. But it obviously works for him." [...] Theroux noted that the only answer Lynch did provide was that he was certain that Theroux's character, a Hollywood director, was not autobiographical of Lynch. Watts stated that she tried to bluff Lynch by pretending she had the plot figured out, and that he delighted in the cast's frustration.|$|E

500|$|Fischer {{associated}} with the Worldwide Church of God in the mid-1960s. The church prescribed Saturday Sabbath, and forbade work (and competitive chess) on Sabbath. According to his friend and colleague Larry Evans, in 1968 Fischer felt philosophically that [...] "the world {{was coming to an}} end" [...] and <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> well make some money by publishing My 60 Memorable Games; Fischer thought that the Rapture was coming soon. During the mid 1970s Fischer contributed significant money to the Worldwide Church of God. In 1972 one journalist stated that [...] "Fischer is almost as serious about religion as he is about chess", and the champion credited his faith with greatly improving his chess. Yet, prophecies by Herbert W. Armstrong went unfulfilled, and the church was rocked by revelations of a series of sex scandals involving Garner Ted Armstrong. Fischer eventually left the church in 1977, [...] "accusing it of being 'Satanic', and vigorously attacking its methods and leadership." ...|$|E
500|$|The lord {{would often}} include men in {{positions}} of local authority, for example Justices of the peace, within his affinity. On the other hand, <b>he</b> <b>might,</b> <b>as</b> John of Gaunt did in the later fourteenth century, recruit people into his affinity regardless of their social weight, {{as an expression of}} his [...] "courtly and chivalric ambitions", as Anthony Goodman said. A contemporary described these as [...] "kin, friendis, allys and parttakaris" [...] ("kin, friends, allies, and partakers") to the lord. Members of the affinity could usually be identified by the livery the lord would distribute for their identification with him; this could range from simple armbands to [...] "a more exclusive form of livery—exclusive metal mounted riband bands"; high-ranking members of John of Gaunt's retinue—a [...] "highly prized" [...] position—wore the Collar of Esses. The members of the affinity closest to the lord were those of most use: the estate officials, treasurer, stewards, and often more than one lawyer.|$|E
500|$|During {{the voyage}} to England Kruger {{encountered}} a 19-year-old law student from the Orange Free State named Martinus Theunis Steyn. Jorissen and Bok marvelled at Kruger, {{in their eyes}} more suited to the 17th century than his own time. One night, when Kruger heard the two Dutchmen discussing celestial bodies {{and the structure of}} the universe, he interjected that if their conversation was accurate and the Earth was not flat, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> well throw his Bible overboard. At the Colonial Office in Whitehall, Carnarvon and Kruger's own colleagues were astonished when, speaking through interpreters, he rose to what Meintjes calls [...] "remarkable heights of oratory", averring that the annexation breached the Sand River Convention and went against the popular will in the Transvaal. His arguments were undermined by reports to the contrary from Shepstone and other British officials, and by a widely publicised letter from a Potchefstroom vicar claiming that Kruger only represented the will of [...] "a handful of irreconcilables". Carnarvon dismissed Kruger's idea of a general plebiscite and concluded that British rule would remain.|$|E

500|$|Carey {{recorded}} {{an official}} remix version for [...] "We Belong Together", which she produced with DJ Clue. The remix features vocals from rappers Jadakiss and Styles P, {{two-thirds of the}} hip-hop trio the LOX. The remix is fundamentally different from the original, described as having [...] "a faster, springier backbeat" [...] by Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times. Lyrically, the song {{is similar to the}} album version of the song, in which both rappers' verses contemplate on past memories. Styles P raps [...] "Past is the past, just let it be bygones / Matter of fact I know a fly song that we could vibe on", which Sanneh writes [...] "Cheerfully out of place, he sounds like a man who has wandered into the wrong summertime party, but so what? He figures <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> well stick around and enjoy it." [...] In two separate reviews of The Emancipation of Mimi, Sanneh referred to the song as both [...] "great" [...] and [...] "excellent", in regards to the remix.|$|E
500|$|Later that year, Fillmore went abroad, stating {{publicly}} {{that as he}} lacked office, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> well travel. [...] The trip was at the advice of political friends, who felt that by touring, he would avoid involvement in the contentious issues of the day, and he spent over a year, from March 1855 to June 1856, in Europe and the Middle East. Queen Victoria {{is said to have}} pronounced the ex-president the handsomest man she had ever seen, while his presence in the gallery of the House of Commons {{at the same time as}} Van Buren excited a comment from MP John Bright. Fillmore was offered an honorary Doctor of Civil Law (D.C.L.) degree by the University of Oxford. Fillmore turned down the honor, explaining that he had neither the [...] "literary nor scientific attainment" [...] to justify the degree. He is also quoted as having explained that he [...] "lacked the benefit of a classical education" [...] and could not, therefore, understand the Latin text of the diploma, adding that he believed [...] "no man should accept a degree he cannot read." [...] Another possibility is that Fillmore refused the degree to escape the heckling and taunting to which Oxford students typically subjected the recipients of such honors.|$|E
2500|$|When the eighteen-year-old Brian Close {{was out to}} a poor stroke on his Ashes {{debut in}} 1950–51, Brown was {{extremely}} unsympathetic to Close who became distressed by his experiences on the tour. John Kay wrote Brown gave the youngsters Berry and Close [...] "every encouragement and seldom complained at their repeated failures" [...] and [...] "the Yorkshire all-rounder was not as co-operative as <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> been".|$|E

2500|$|His garb was in tatters, {{his beard}} an ugly stubble, his eyes bloodshot. [...] He had the gauntiness [...] in feature of a wasted consumptive. [...] He was shackled.

2500|$|Viktor Kuzin, {{a member}} of the Moscow City Council and a founder of the Democratic Union in Russia, {{travelled}} to Minnesota in 1993 to meet LaRouche in prison, and afterwards participated in international campaigns to exonerate LaRouche. An advertisement calling for exoneration was published in several US Newspapers, signed by Kuzin, Civil Rights attorney J.L. Chestnut, former Ugandan President Godfrey Binaisa, and others. Chestnut was interviewed in the Tuscaloosa News saying that when he met LaRouche, [...] "I told him that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> well be black and in Alabama." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bruner {{has accused}} President Barack Obama of {{formerly}} being a drug-using gay prostitute, writing in October 2015: [...] "Obama has {{a soft spot}} for homosexuals because of the years he spent as a male prostitute in his twenties. That is how he paid for his drugs." [...] "He has admitted he was addicted to drugs when he was young and he is sympathetic with homosexuals, but he hasn't {{come out of the closet}} about his own homosexual/bisexual background." [...] She continued, [...] "He hasn't quite evolved that much! Since he supports gay marriage, he should be proud of his background as a homosexual/bisexual. He is against everything else Christians stand for, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> well be for infidelity." [...] Bruner has referred to Obama as [...] "Ahab the Arab" [...] and said that the president [...] "hates all white people and all wealthy people because to him wealthy means white." ...|$|E
