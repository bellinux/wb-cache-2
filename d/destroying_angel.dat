5|$|The <b>Destroying</b> <b>Angel</b> and Daemons of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate, {{also known}} as The <b>Destroying</b> <b>Angel</b> and Daemons Inflicting Divine Vengeance on the Wicked and Intemperate and The Destruction of the Temple of Vice, is an oil {{painting}} on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited in 1832. Etty had become famous for nude paintings, and acquired a reputation for tastelessness, indecency {{and a lack of}} creativity. With The <b>Destroying</b> <b>Angel</b> he hoped to disprove his critics with an openly moral piece. The painting is 127.8cm by 101.9cm (50in by 40in) and depicts a classical temple under attack from a <b>destroying</b> <b>angel</b> and a group of daemons. Some of the human occupants are dead or unconscious, others flee in terror or struggle helplessly against the daemons.|$|E
5|$|Around the {{painting}} lie corpses {{in various states}} of undress. The <b>Destroying</b> <b>Angel</b> was painted shortly after Etty's visit to Paris in which he had witnessed the July Revolution at first hand, and the sight and smell of the dead in the streets had left a strong impression on him. The heaped bodies in The <b>Destroying</b> <b>Angel</b> were probably directly inspired by the events Etty had witnessed in France, and perhaps also by the cholera epidemic which killed thousands in London in 1832.|$|E
5|$|Amanita ocreata, {{commonly}} known as the death angel, <b>destroying</b> <b>angel,</b> angel of death or more precisely western North American <b>destroying</b> <b>angel,</b> is a deadly poisonous basidiomycete fungus, one of many in the genus Amanita. Occurring in the Pacific Northwest and California floristic provinces of North America, A. ocreata associates with oak trees. The large fruiting bodies (the mushrooms) generally appear in spring; the cap may be white or ochre and often develops a brownish centre, while the stipe, ring, gill and volva are all white.|$|E

5|$|Needled by {{repeated}} {{attacks from}} The Morning Chronicle on his supposed indecency, poor taste {{and lack of}} creativity, Etty determined to produce a work that would prove his detractors wrong. The result was The <b>Destroying</b> <b>Angel</b> and Daemons of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate.|$|E
5|$|Amanita bisporigera {{belongs to}} section Phalloideae {{of the genus}} Amanita, which {{contains}} some of the deadliest Amanita species, including A.phalloides and A.virosa. This classification has been upheld with phylogenetic analyses, which demonstrate that the toxin-producing members of section Phalloideae form a clade—that is, they derive from a common ancestor. In 2005, Zhang and colleagues performed a phylogenetic analysis based on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences of several white-bodied toxic Amanita species, {{most of which are}} found in Asia. Their results support a clade containing A. bisporigera, A.subjunquillea var. alba, A.exitialis, and A.virosa. The Guangzhou <b>destroying</b> <b>angel</b> (Amanita exitialis) has two-spored basidia, like A.bisporigera.|$|E
5|$|When first {{exhibited}} in 1832, The <b>Destroying</b> <b>Angel</b> was widely praised for its technical brilliance, but critics were {{divided on the}} subject matter. Some praised its vividness and ability to mix fear and beauty without lowering into tastelessness; others criticised its thematic matter as inappropriate, and chastised Etty for wasting his talents. The painting changed {{the manner in which}} art critics viewed the artist; some saw it as indicating previously unseen character depths, others considered it a renunciation of his previous works. In 1854 Henry Payne, who had commissioned the painting, sold it to Sir Joseph Whitworth. Whitworth donated it in 1882 to the Manchester Art Gallery, where it remains.|$|E

5|$|Many {{mushroom}} {{species are}} poisonous to humans, with toxicities ranging from slight digestive problems or allergic reactions {{as well as}} hallucinations to severe organ failures and death. Genera with mushrooms containing deadly toxins include Conocybe, Galerina, Lepiota, and, the most infamous, Amanita. The latter genus includes the <b>destroying</b> <b>angel</b> (A.virosa) and the death cap (A.phalloides), {{the most common cause}} of deadly mushroom poisoning. The false morel (Gyromitra esculenta) is occasionally considered a delicacy when cooked, yet can be highly toxic when eaten raw. Tricholoma equestre was considered edible until it was implicated in serious poisonings causing rhabdomyolysis. Fly agaric mushrooms (Amanita muscaria) also cause occasional non-fatal poisonings, mostly as a result of ingestion for its hallucinogenic properties. Historically, fly agaric was used by different peoples in Europe and Asia and its present usage for religious or shamanic purposes is reported from some ethnic groups such as the Koryak people of north-eastern Siberia.|$|E
25|$|The common {{mushroom}} {{could be}} confused with young specimens of the deadly poisonous <b>destroying</b> <b>angel</b> (Amanita sp.), but the latter may be distinguished by their volva or cup {{at the base of}} the mushroom and pure white gills (as opposed to pinkish or brown of A. bisporus). Thus it is always important to clear away debris and examine the base of such similar mushrooms, as well as cutting open young specimens to check the gills. Furthermore, the <b>destroying</b> <b>angel</b> grows in mossy woods and lives symbiotically with spruce.|$|E
25|$|Amanita virosa, {{commonly}} known in Europe as the <b>destroying</b> <b>angel,</b> is a deadly poisonous basidiomycete fungus, {{one of many}} in the genus Amanita. Occurring in Europe, A. virosa associates with various deciduous and coniferous trees. The large fruiting bodies (i.e., the mushrooms) appear in summer and autumn; the caps, stipes and gills are all white in colour.|$|E

25|$|The {{common name}} of <b>destroying</b> <b>angel</b> {{is applied to}} several all-white species of {{poisonous}} Amanita, to this species in Europe and to Amanita bisporigera in eastern North America, and A. ocreata in the west. A. virosa was first collected and described by Elias Magnus Fries in Sweden. Its specific epithet virosa derived from the Latin adjective virōsus 'toxic' (compare virus).|$|E
25|$|The hill is {{believed}} to have been inhabited since the 4th millennium BCE. Assuming colocation with the biblical Mount Zion, its southern section would have been walled at the beginning of the 2nd millennium BCE, in around 1850 BCE, by Canaanites who established a settlement there (or in the vicinity) named Jebus. Jewish tradition identifies it with Mount Moriah where the binding of Isaac took place. According to the Hebrew Bible, the Temple Mount was originally a threshing-floor owned by Araunah, a Jebusite. The prophet Gad suggested the area to King David as a fitting place for the erection of an altar to YHWH, since a <b>destroying</b> <b>angel</b> was standing there when God stopped a great plague in Jerusalem.|$|E
500|$|Also {{exhibited}} at the 1832 Summer Exhibition along with Youth and Pleasure was The <b>Destroying</b> <b>Angel</b> and Daemons of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate, seen as a riposte by Etty to his critics. Another of what Etty deemed [...] "visions", depicting a wholly imaginary scene rather than one from literature, mythology or history, The <b>Destroying</b> <b>Angel</b> shows an imaginary classical temple under attack from a <b>destroying</b> <b>angel</b> {{and a group of}} daemons. The human figures, intentionally painted in paler tones than usual to suggest death, each show their fear in a different way. Painted soon after his 1830 travels, it is thought that the heaped corpses and terrified crowds were directly inspired by events Etty had witnessed in Paris.|$|E

25|$|Amanita virosa is {{very similar}} to several other species of all-white amanitas known as <b>destroying</b> <b>angels,</b> which has led to {{confusion}} over which occurs where. This specific name has been applied to all-white <b>destroying</b> <b>angels</b> occurring in North America, though others propose these all belong to Amanita bisporigera and other rarer species instead. There has been some question over whether Amanita verna is a valid species.|$|R
500|$|The <b>Destroying</b> <b>Angel</b> {{was first}} {{exhibited}} at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in 1832. It immediately generated much critical and public interest, and was compared favourably with The Fall of the Damned by Peter Paul Rubens, Michelangelo's The Last Judgment and [...] "Breughell's frightful fancies".|$|E
500|$|Despite some criticism, The <b>Destroying</b> <b>Angel</b> {{changed the}} way Etty was {{perceived}} by critics. They commonly had viewed Etty's works as insights into his mind, generally {{with the aim of}} discrediting him for supposed sexual deviancies. Confronted with a piece so obviously intended to convey a moral lesson, many of those same critics felt that Etty had revealed a more moral nature than they had previously believed. Many explicitly saw The <b>Destroying</b> <b>Angel</b> as a counterweight to the nude paintings for which Etty was famous, or even a representation of Etty's own repentance for or renunciation of his previous works. Fraser's Magazine described the painting as [...] "a sermon to [...] admirers... where he inflicts poetical justice upon his own gay dames and their gallants, their revels being broken in upon, and they themselves being carried off most unceremoniously, like that little gentleman Don Juan, by sundry grim-looking brawny devils".|$|E
500|$|Amanita bisporigera is {{a deadly}} {{poisonous}} species of fungus {{in the family}} Amanitaceae. It {{is commonly known as}} the eastern North American <b>destroying</b> <b>angel</b> or just as the <b>destroying</b> <b>angel,</b> although the fungus shares this latter name with three other lethal white Amanita species, A.ocreata, A.verna and A.virosa. The fruit bodies are found on the ground in mixed coniferous and deciduous forests of eastern North America south to Mexico, but are rare in western North America; the fungus has also been found in pine plantations in Colombia. The mushroom has a smooth white cap that can reach up to [...] across, and a stipe, up to [...] long by [...] thick, that has a delicate white skirt-like ring near the top. The bulbous stipe base is covered with a membranous sac-like volva. The white gills are free from attachment to the stalk and crowded closely together. As the species name suggests, A.bisporigera typically bears two spores on the basidia, although this characteristic is not as immutable as was once thought.|$|E

500|$|The <b>Destroying</b> <b>Angel</b> is {{a visionary}} work, {{depicting}} a wholly imaginary scene {{rather than a}} scene from history, literature or mythology. It measures 127.8cm by 101.9cm (50in by 40in), and depicts an ornate imaginary classical temple. [...] The temple and its occupants are under attack from a <b>destroying</b> <b>angel</b> {{and a group of}} daemons, who {{are in the process of}} abducting its human occupants. The angel itself is wreathed in smoke in the centre of the image. Having destroyed one side of the temple, it is poised to hurl a thunderbolt. Below the angel, daemons attack a group of around 25 semi-naked human figures. Each human is shown in a different position and expresses terror in a different way, and each is deliberately painted in paler tones than those Etty typically used in an effort to suggest death and pallor. As with most of Etty's works, the figures are a collection of depictions of models in studio poses, later arranged for dramatic effect, rather than painted as a group.|$|E
500|$|Other critics admired Etty's unusual {{interpretation}} of apocalyptic religious imagery, {{his ability to}} give distinct characters and shapes to the individual demons and their victims, and the vividness of his imagination. The Morning Post particularly praised Etty's ability to convey [...] "creation conceived and thrown upon the canvas with all the fury of poetical inspiration" [...] by combining the [...] "dauntless spirit of a sketch" [...] with the [...] "powerful impression of a finished picture". The prominent art critic William Paulet Carey (writing {{under the name of}} 'Ridolfi') championed The <b>Destroying</b> <b>Angel,</b> and in particular Etty's ability to balance beauty, horror and fear without descending into tastelessness. Carey saw Etty as proof that British artistic traditions were equal to any others in the world, and The <b>Destroying</b> <b>Angel</b> as evidence of Etty's [...] "redeeming grace and spirit". Etty's long-standing adversaries at The Morning Chronicle found little to attack in the painting, their review stating that [...] "The upper part of the picture is masterly, grand and beautiful. The lower part not so well, but some of the figures are in admirable action and fine drawing." [...] The reticence of The Morning Chronicle prompted Carey to comment that they were in [...] "envious silence".|$|E
500|$|Etty died in 1849, and {{his work}} enjoyed a brief boom in popularity. Interest in him {{declined}} over time, {{and by the end}} of the 19th century the cost of all his paintings had fallen below their original prices. Henry Payne sold The <b>Destroying</b> <b>Angel</b> in 1854 for 770 guineas (about £ in today's terms) to Sir Joseph Whitworth, [...] who donated it in 1882 to the Manchester Art Gallery, where it remains. The painting was exhibited as part of a major retrospective of Etty's work at the York Art Gallery in 2011–12.|$|E
50|$|While edible, the Caesar's {{mushroom}} {{is closely}} related to the psychoactive fly agaric, and to the highly poisonous death cap and <b>destroying</b> <b>angels.</b>|$|R
