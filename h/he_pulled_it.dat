5|$|The McCanns {{and their}} friends left the {{restaurant}} roughly every half-hour to check on their children. Madeleine's father carried out the first check on 5A at around 21:05. The children were asleep and all was well, except that he recalled having left the children's bedroom door slightly ajar, and now it stood almost wide open. <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> nearly closed again {{before returning to the}} restaurant.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Chiefs {{receiver}} Danan Hughes gave his team a big opportunity by returning a punt 35 {{yards to the}} Oilers 42-yard line. But Kansas City ended up empty handed {{at the end of}} a drive in which they squandered multiple chances to get into scoring range. First, Montana threw a pass to the end zone that was barely deflected away from receiver Willie Davis by the outstretched arm of defensive back Cris Dishman. On the next play, he completed a pass to J. J. Birden that moved the ball to the 5-yard line, only to see it wiped out by a false start penalty on tackle John Alt. Then after a screen pass that gained nothing, Montana threw another pass to the end zone on third down, this one bouncing off the fingertips of a wide open Davis and forcing Kansas City to punt. Houston then drove to the Chiefs 10-yard line on a drive that included Moon's 16-yard scramble with an unnecessary roughness penalty turning it into a 31-yard gain. But after a penalty pushed them back to the 25, they too failed to score when Lewis knocked the ball out of Moon's hand as <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> back to throw and rookie linebacker Jaime Fields recovered the fumble. Montana completed a 22-yard pass to Davis on the first play after the turnover, and eventually the Chiefs reached the Houston 36-yard line. But Montana threw an incomplete pass on fourth and 1, and the score remained 10–0 at the end of the half.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to its National Film Award win, the film won a Best Film Award from the Madras Filmfans' Association in 1955. Contemporary critics lauded Meiyappan and Balachander for the experimental film. While Ganesan's role as an antihero won him critical acclaim, many critics felt that Pandari Bai's role as the patriotic wife overshadowed his performance. Many contemporary critics expected the film to be a trendsetter, but it failed to inspire many thematically similar films in Tamil. Several years later, Shanta recalled that Balachander was not affected by the film's failure as he was [...] "delighted that <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> off", with critics praising the performances of Ganesan, Pandari Bai and the other actors.|$|E

500|$|Rolling Stone {{magazine}} {{continued its}} near-deification {{of the event}} as a defining moment {{in the evolution of}} rock 'n' roll, with Jon Landau declaring, [...] "The Concert for Bangla Desh is rock reaching for its manhood." [...] As for Harrison, [...] "the spirit he creates through his own demeanor is inspirational. From the personal point of view, Concert for Bangla Desh was George's moment. He put it together; and <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> off, and for that he deserves the admiration of all of us." [...] To the Rolling Stone writer, the highpoint of the album was the closing [...] "Bangla Desh", whose lyrics were no longer [...] "an expression of intent but of an accomplished mission". Landau had praise for the pacing and professionalism of the entire show, the only [...] "incongruous" [...] moment being Leon Russell's [...] "Jumpin' Jack Flash"/"Youngblood" [...] segment, since it was straight from the singer's usual repertoire.|$|E
500|$|Ian Youngs of BBC News {{noted that}} the song was another {{diatribe}} about fame and {{how difficult it is}} being in the public eye. He further added that it [...] "ranks among the disappointments" [...] on the album saying it feels lacklustre and commented about the [...] "embarrassing rap". Ed Howard from Stylus Magazine commented that barring Madonna's rapping, [...] "Hollywood" [...] is at least engaging. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine thought [...] "following up 'American Life' with 'Hollywood' was nearly as ballsy" [...] due to its lyrical content. Edna Gundersen of USA Today {{noted that the}} song [...] "attest to her undiminished skills as a shrewd pop composer". Michael Hubbard of musicOMH commented that everything rhymes with [...] "Hollywood", and after commented the song would be better without these lazy lyrics, adding [...] " [...] has the name Madonna on it so it will sell, but it's hardly vintage stuff. Time for some musical reinvention to go with the incessant changes of image." [...] In another review, Chuck Taylor from Billboard expressed his disappointment with the song. He explained that [...] "Hollywood" [...] is [...] "a far cry from the ingenious fortitude displayed on so many previous singles of [...] two decades of career". He panned Ahmadzaï's limited electronic production and Madonna's excessive usage of acoustic guitar on the track, along with [...] "whiney, preachy lyrics". Writing for The Sydney Morning Herald, Bernard Zuel called Ahmadzaï a [...] "one-trick pony" [...] for his production, but felt <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> off [...] "on the groove-rich 'Hollywood'". Ben Wener from The Beaver County Times condemned the track as a [...] "knowingly hypocritical attack on Hollywood".|$|E

Jackson and Abdul said [...] "Trouble" [...] was Yamin's best performance ever, and Cowell said Yamin fought, showed personality and deserved {{to get through to}} the next round. Guest Tommy Mottola said Yamin is a laidback kid and that <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> off well.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "foo" [...] was {{borrowed}} from Bill Holman's Smokey Stover by a radar operator in the 415th Night Fighter Squadron, Donald J. Meiers, who (it is agreed by most 415th members) gave the foo fighters their name. Meiers was from Chicago {{and was an}} avid reader of Bill Holman's strip, which was run daily in the Chicago Tribune. Smokey Stover's catch-phrase was [...] "where there's foo, there's fire". In a mission debriefing on the evening November 27, 1944, Fritz Ringwald, the unit's S-2 Intelligence Officer, stated that Meiers and Ed Schleuter had sighted a red ball of fire that appeared to chase them {{through a variety of}} high-speed maneuvers. Fritz said that Meiers was extremely agitated and had a copy of the comic strip tucked in his back pocket. <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> out and slammed it down on Fritz's desk and said [...] "... it was another one of those fuckin' foo fighters!" [...] and stormed out of the debriefing room.|$|E

2500|$|Emanuel Custer was {{an outspoken}} Democrat who taught his {{children}} politics and toughness {{at an early}} age. In a February 3, 1887 letter to his son's widow, Libby, he related an incident [...] "when Autie [...] was about four years old. He {{had to have a}} tooth drawn, [...] and he was very much afraid of blood. When I took him to the doctor to have the tooth pulled, it was in the night and I told him if it bled well it would get well right away, and he must be a good soldier. When he got to the doctor he took his seat, and the pulling began. The forceps slipped off and he had to make a second trial. <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> out, and Autie never even scrunched. Going home, I led him by the arm. He jumped and skipped, and said 'Father you and me can whip all the Whigs in Michigan.' I thought that was saying a good deal but I did not contradict him." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 5 February 2011 Booth {{retained}} his British {{title for}} the fourth time and retained his old Commonwealth title. His opponent, Jamie Arthur, had won the vacant belt beating Kris Hughes after Booth had given it up in order to fight for the World title. The fight, at the Brentwood Leisure Centre, resulted in a split decision win with both fighters suffering cuts during the fight. Speaking after the fight, Booth's manager Jimmy Gill said that the fight had only been arranged with three weeks' notice and said that Jason had only just come back from holiday and so had little time to prepare. Gill said, [...] "Jason is 34 in November and small guys like him don't normally last that long. They burn out". He added that he would never allow Booth to take a fight at such short notice again, saying, [...] "That was a favour to promoter Frank Maloney...It was a big ask but <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> off...But it was a one-off, I'll never do it again." [...] Of the fight, Booth paid tribute to Arthur, saying, [...] "That was the hardest fight I've had yet...I had to show heart because I was getting out-foxed by a clever champ. For saying we had three weeks' notice, we put on a good show." [...] Following the fight, it was confirmed that Booth would challenge Spain's Kiko Martínez for the European super bantamweight title, the fourth time Booth would have fought for a variation of the European belt. The fight against Martínez was eventually confirmed for Spain and took place on 15 April 2011 in front of a sell out 30,000 crowd in the city of Madrid. Martínez, a former two time European champion, won the fight in front of his home fans when in the tenth round a left hook was catalyst for the referee to call off the fight early, the first time Booth had been stopped in his career to date.|$|E
