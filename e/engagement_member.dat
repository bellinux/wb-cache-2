40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that lesbian and gay students are often more likely to suffer from high risk factors. These students often have higher rates of suicide, are more likely to drop out, use drugs and alcohol, etc. Often schools do not provide this invisible minority with appropriate support. One natural place to address lesbian/gay issues in the high school curriculum is the literature classroom. Literature textbooks often include statistically high numbers of lesbian/gay authors. However, often literature teachers are reluctant to identify the sexuality of these authors, and rarely do these teachers introduce issues of sexuality in any other way. In this study, I examine why some teachers avoid discussions of lesbian/gay issues and why others include them. The overarching theory that I use in my research is that of lesbian/gay/queer theory. While the term lesbian/gay/queer theory might seem to be an unnecessarily long and awkward title, I use it here {{to make it clear that}} I will be combining elements of lesbian/gay theory with elements of queer theory. My purpose in doing this is to craft a study that will embrace both the practical aspects and the academic rigor required to meet the changing needs of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (queer) people. Since this study examines attitudes, the design is a qualitative one. I gather data from many sources including informal observations, classroom observations, interviews, and focus groups. Rigor is provided through prolonged <b>engagement,</b> <b>member</b> checking, and triangulation of data through multiple sources. My results shed light on why individuals in this group of literature teachers often approach the study of lesbian/gay issues in a multitude of ways and have a number of different reasons for their various approaches...|$|E
40|$|A {{sense of}} {{belonging}} is essential in inducing individuals with disabilities to either voluntarily or involuntarily exclude or include themselves from the library community. Previous studies about the visually impaired in libraries were library focused, either benchmarking services offered against available standards and practices or surveying the types of services or facilities made available by libraries to their disabled users. Very few studies examined the issues from the visually impaired own perspectives. This study examines the beliefs, experiences and perceptions of belonging among the visually impaired students {{in the context of}} an academic library in Malaysia. This study applied the social model of disability and uses the qualitative approach to derive themes and sub-themes relating to feelings of belonging based on visually impaired students’ interpretations of their daily life experiences in using the library facilities and services. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions. The participants were eighteen visually impaired students who had registered as members of the university library and who had consented to be involved in the study. The contact period was 7 months. Trustworthiness was established through prolonged <b>engagement,</b> <b>member</b> checking, peer review, external expert audit and the researcher’s own reflexivity. Two main themes intrinsic and extrinsic conditions emerged. Intrinsic conditions refer to participants’ feelings towards library policies, library staff and their peers. Their {{sense of belonging}} was triggered when they felt respected and comforted by library policies that gave them longer borrowing periods, the availability of liaison staff who met them periodically, who asked for their feedback about issues that can improve the library services for them. Participants felt included and safe with library staff who showed awareness and empathy about their disability and therefore more open to help them. Participants felt happy and belong when peers and staff communicated with them thereby expanding their social interaction skills and networks. Extrinsic conditions refer to the participants’ feelings about the library facilities, services and design layout. The visually impaired students felt comfortable, proud, accepted and valued when their special needs for carrel rooms, laboratories and toilets were provided. Participants felt that they have a feeling of belonging when the library provided special lifts for them to move between floors, the use of appropriate assistive technologies to access the OPAC and the Internet. Participants appreciated the library services such as managing their volunteer readers, support of special librarians, and special information skill session, and regarded these as an indication of being respected, supported and iv accepted and these influence their sense of belonging and being included into the library community. Participants also voiced their concerns about the barriers they experience in the library and made suggestions for improvements. This study highlights the conditions that could foster sense of belonging to a library and the findings would be useful for library management to take note to formulate better disabled-friendly policies, and plan better library services and facilities for their visually impaired users...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{draws on}} the social {{construction}} perspective and on social learning theory to examine the cross-cultural influences on organizational learning in MNCs. Social learning theory suggests that constructive <b>engagement</b> and <b>member</b> solidarity are key constituents of organization-based collective learning. Literature suggests, however, that cross-cultural differences in assumptions about social participation by organization members may impair organizational learning. The paper also reports a qualitative study, conducted at five Japanese-invested manufacturing companies in the Pearl River Delta, China. The research found that managers perceived Chinese frontline workers as lacking constructive <b>engagement</b> and <b>member</b> solidarity as compared with their Japanese counterparts, thus limiting organizational learning, and attributed these perceived differences to deep-seated cultural values. Attempts {{in two of the}} companies to 2 ̆ 7 Japanize 2 ̆ 7 the workforces were reported to have had some impact, but appeared not to have substantially changed this picture.

40|$|A {{disconnect}} {{exists between}} {{research and practice}} that is impeding the flow of knowledge between researchers, practitioners and decision makers. This obstruction of knowledge is acting {{as a barrier to}} the use of evidence in decisions and also as a barrier to informing research of important questions that need answering through scientific investigation. This divide between research and practice can be crossed by building a bridge between researchers and practitioners across which knowledge can be transmitted, translated and exchanged. A possible mechanism to understand the key contributors to bridge building is by using Wenger's Community of Practice model as a framework upon which to understand the importance of and how to build connections between research, policy and practice. The defining characteristic of a Community of Practice is the interaction between members in order to jointly determine and embrace goals, eventually resulting in shared practices. Crucial to the success of a Community of Practice is the <b>engagement</b> between community <b>members.</b> Without <b>engagement,</b> a Community of Practice can not share knowledge and achieve its negotiated goals. This thesis studied a Community of Practice that is being deliberately formed to facilitate the development of a pan-Canadian population health research network. This network, CANSPANN (Canadian School Physical Activity and Nutrition Network) aims to bring together researchers, practitioners, and decision makers to create research programs studying the social-environmental influence of schools on youth physical activity and healthy eating that address priorities for policy and practice. This thesis assessed if a quantitative questionnaire tool could validly and reliably measure the level of <b>engagement</b> between CANSPANN <b>members.</b> The questionnaire also aimed to determine if engagement predicted knowledge use. Eighteen items in the NEQ validly measure <b>engagement</b> of CANSPANN <b>members.</b> Sufficient content validly was established for these items. Of these eighteen items, only four subscales significantly predicted knowledge use. Through reliability testing with qualitative interviews it was determined that the Network Engagement Questionnaire reliably measures <b>engagement</b> for CANSPANN <b>members</b> who are centrally involved. It is far less able to reliably measure <b>engagement</b> for peripheral <b>members.</b> Further testing with the NEQ is necessary in order to increase its reliability...|$|R
