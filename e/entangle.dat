40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a method to}} {{generate}} <b>entangled</b> coherent states between two spatially separated atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) via the technique of the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). Two strong coupling laser beams and two <b>entangled</b> probe laser beams are used to make two distant BECs be in EIT states and to generate an atom-photon <b>entangled</b> state between probe lasers and distant BECs. The two BECs are initially in un-entangled product coherent states while the probe lasers are initially in an <b>entangled</b> state. <b>Entangled</b> states of two distant BECs can be created through performing projective measurements upon the two outgoing probe lasers under certain conditions. Concretely, we propose two protocols to show how to generate <b>entangled</b> coherent states of the two distant BECs. One is a single-photon scheme in which an <b>entangled</b> single-photon state serves the quantum channel to generate <b>entangled</b> distant BECs. The other is a multiphoton scheme where an <b>entangled</b> coherent state of the probe lasers is used as the quantum channel. Additionally, we also obtain some atom-photon <b>entangled</b> states of particular interest such as <b>entangled</b> states between a pair of optical Bell (or quasi-Bell) states {{and a pair of}} atomic <b>entangled</b> coherent (or quasi-Bell) states.

25|$|Briefly, Saxo's {{version of}} Hamlet's history is as follows: Gervendill, {{governor}} of Jutland, was succeeded by his sons Horvendill and Feng. Horvendill, {{on his return}} from a Viking expedition {{in which he had}} slain Koll, king of Norway, married Gerutha, daughter of Rørik Slyngebond, king of Denmark; she bore him a son, Amleth. But Feng, out of jealousy, murdered Horvendill, and persuaded Gerutha to become his wife, on the plea that he had committed the crime {{for no other reason than}} to avenge her of a husband who had hated her. Amleth, afraid of sharing his father's fate, pretended to be an imbecile, but the suspicion of Feng put him to various tests which are related in detail. Among other things they sought to <b>entangle</b> him with a young girl, his foster-sister (the prototype of Ophelia), but his cunning saved him. When, however, Amleth slew the eavesdropper hidden (like Polonius in Shakespeare's play), in his mother's room, and destroyed all trace of the deed, Feng was assured that the young man's madness was feigned. Accordingly, he dispatched him to Britain in company with two attendants, who bore a letter enjoining the king of the country to put him to death. Amleth surmised the purport of their instructions, and secretly altered the message on their wooden tablets to the effect that the king should put the attendants to death and give Amleth his daughter in marriage.|$|E

Love and Law was a film which garnered some criticism for an improbable plot. Checkmate wove a more tangled web of circumstantial evidence and intrigue and the resolution comes not from an astute female detective, but by the heiress's novel substitution of a doppelgänger to the prison so that the original can get the needed confession. The serious nature of the film was highlighted with the advertising of the film by Thanhouser which states, [...] "Checkmate carries a message and a lesson to those who value the 'circumstantial evidence' process by which so many convictions are obtained in our criminal courts.
