5|$|According {{to current}} {{physical}} cosmology theory, carbon is {{formed in the}} interiors of stars in the horizontal branch by the collision and transformation of three helium nuclei. When those stars die as supernova, the carbon is scattered into space as dust. This dust becomes component material {{for the formation of}} second or third-generation star systems with accreted planets. The Solar System <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>such</b> star system with an abundance of carbon, enabling the existence of life as we know it.|$|E
5|$|Coronary artery {{bypass surgery}} <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>such</b> operation. In this operation, {{one or more}} arteries {{surrounding}} the heart that have become narrowed are bypassed. This is done by taking blood vessels harvested from {{another part of the}} body. Commonly harvested veins include the saphenous veins or the internal mammary artery. Because this operation involves the heart tissue, a machine is used so that blood can bypass the heart during the operation.|$|E

5|$|Host-parasite mimicry is a {{situation}} where a parasite mimics its own host. As with mimicry of the female sex outlined previously, only two species are involved, the model and mimic being of the same species. Brood parasitism, a form of kleptoparasitism where the mother has its offspring raised by another unwitting organism, <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>such</b> situation where host-parasite mimicry has evolved. Pasteur terms this form of aggressive-reproductive mimicry Kirbyan mimicry, after the English entomologist William Kirby.|$|E
5|$|Several {{courtship}} displays by superb fairywren {{males have}} been recorded. The 'sea horse flight', {{named for its}} seahorse-like undulations, <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>such</b> display. During this exaggerated flight, the male—with his neck extended and his head feathers erect—tilts his body from horizontal to vertical, and descends slowly and springs upwards by rapidly beating his wings after alighting on the ground. The 'face fan' display {{may be seen as}} a part of aggressive or sexual display behaviours; it involves the flaring of the blue ear tufts by erecting the feathers.|$|E

5|$|The Seal of Dartmouth College is the {{official}} insignia of Dartmouth College, an Ivy League university located in Hanover, New Hampshire, United States. Anglo-American law generally requires a corporate body to seek official government sanction, usually {{in the form of}} a charter, in order to operate. Such chartered bodies normally authenticate their official acts by marking them with a distinctive seal. The seal's design is usually complicated to avoid counterfeiting, but it can also express something about the institution's history or mission. Dartmouth College <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>such</b> chartered body, and it obtained its official seal in 1773.|$|E
5|$|The {{convergence}} {{of the two}} blocks continued even after their collision, generating strike-slip faults. The Saravan fault east of Taftan <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>such</b> fault; the 2013 Saravan earthquake occurred on this fault. From some of these faults it has been inferred that the mass load from the Taftan edifice has measurable effects on tectonic stress within the region.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} in a fictional setting called Sequin Land, {{described}} as a magical place, formerly protected by Guardian Genies who won the land years of peace. With time, genies fell in love with humans and had children with them, half-genies with limited magical powers. For obscure reasons, genies ultimately vanished, with their children taking their place as protectors of the land. The main character, Shantae, <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>such</b> half-genie, appointed as the Guardian Genie of the small fishing village of Scuttle Town, where she resides in the abandoned lighthouse.|$|E

5|$|Eclipsing {{variables}} are star systems that vary in brightness {{because of one}} star passing {{in front of the}} other rather than from any intrinsic change in luminosity. W Ursae Minoris <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>such</b> system, its magnitude ranging from 8.51 to 9.59 over 1.7 days. The combined spectrum of the system is A2V, but the masses of the two component stars are unknown. A slight change in the orbital period in 1973 suggests there is a third component of the multiple star system—most likely a red dwarf—with an orbital period of 62.2±3.9 years. RU Ursae Minoris is another example, ranging from 10 to 10.66 over 0.52days. It is a semidetached system, as the secondary star is filling its Roche lobe and transferring matter to the primary.|$|E
5|$|Such a {{depiction}} {{is common}} in semitechnical and popular dinosaur literature. Robert T. Bakker has extended social behavior to parental care, and has interpreted shed allosaur teeth and chewed bones of large prey animals as evidence that adult allosaurs brought food to lairs for their young to eat until they were grown, and prevented other carnivores from scavenging on the food. However, there is actually little evidence of gregarious behavior in theropods, and social interactions {{with members of the}} same species would have included antagonistic encounters, as shown by injuries to gastralia and bite wounds to skulls (the pathologic lower jaw named Labrosaurus ferox <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>such</b> possible example). Such head-biting may have been a way to establish dominance in a pack or to settle territorial disputes.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh crosses {{well with}} many other breeds, and has {{influenced}} the Pony of the Americas and the British Riding Pony. Many are also cross-bred with Thoroughbreds, and other horse breeds. The Welsh Pony {{has contributed to the}} founding of several other horse and pony breeds. The Morgan horse <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>such</b> breed, being in part descended from Welsh Cobs left behind by British forces {{after the end of the}} American Revolutionary War. They are crossed with Arab horses to produce riding horses, and with Thoroughbreds to produce jumpers, hunters, and eventers. Welsh mares have also been used to breed polo ponies that were agile and nimble. The Welsh Pony was used to create the Welara, a cross-breed of the Welsh and the Arab horse, which has been registered in America as a separate breed since 1981.|$|E

5|$|The named tributaries {{within the}} {{watershed}} are presented here in three lists. Larrys Creek itself has 18 named tributaries, {{which are the}} subject of the first list. The First Fork and Second Fork of Larrys Creek are the two main tributaries of Larrys Creek, and they have multiple tributaries of their own. The second list gives the First Fork's eight named tributaries, and the third list gives the Second Fork's nine named tributaries. Finally there are seven named streams in the watershed which are tributaries of tributaries of the three main branches, and they are presented after each list. There <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>such</b> stream for Larrys Creek itself, two for the First Fork, and four for the Second Fork. There are also tributaries without names, which are not included in these lists.|$|E
5|$|The next arc, Summer, reveals {{events that}} {{occurred}} in the summer of one thousand years before the Dream arc, taking place in the Heian period. Kannabi no mikoto, or Kanna, {{is one of the last}} winged beings in Airs fictional setting and is held as a prisoner in her own castle. Since she bears wings on her back, she is not permitted to leave the castle walls or see her mother, who is in a similar situation elsewhere. With Ryūya, a member of her samurai guard, and Uraha, a fledgling telekinetic, Kanna escapes and traverses feudal Japan to find her mother. However, the rest of the guard and a sect of Buddhist monks follow them. After catching up, they place a curse on Kanna where she must endure constant reincarnation and death whenever she finds love; Misuzu <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>such</b> reincarnation.|$|E
5|$|The {{predicted}} {{effects of}} the FairTax {{are a source of}} disagreement among economists and other analysts. According to Money magazine, while many economists and tax experts support the idea of a consumption tax, many of them view the FairTax proposal as having serious problems with evasion and revenue neutrality. Some economists argue that a consumption tax (the FairTax <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>such</b> tax) would {{have a positive effect on}} economic growth, incentives for international business to locate in the U.S., and increased U.S. international competitiveness (border tax adjustment in global trade). The FairTax would be tax-free on mortgage interest (up to a basic interest rate) and donations, but some lawmakers have concerns about losing tax incentives on home ownership and charitable contributions. There is also concern about the effect on the income tax industry and the difficulty of repealing the Sixteenth Amendment (to prevent Congress from re-introducing an income tax).|$|E
