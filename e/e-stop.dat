Generally, conveyor lines are not stopped unless there is maintenance required, or there is an emergency stop, called an <b>E-stop.</b> Checkweighers operating in high density conveyor lines may have numerous special equipments in their design to ensure that if an <b>E-stop</b> occurs, all power going to all motors is removed until the <b>E-stop</b> is cleared and reset.|$|E

50|$|AS-Interface {{provides}} {{a basis for}} Functional Safety in machinery safety/emergency stop applications. Safety devices communicating over AS-Interface follow all the normal AS-Interface data rules. The required level of data verification is provided by dynamic changes in the data. This technology is called Safety at Work and allows safety devices and standard, non-safe devices {{to be connected to}} the same network. Using appropriate safe input hardware (e.g. light curtains, <b>e-stop</b> buttons, and door interlock switches), AS-Interface can provide safety support up to SIL (Safety Integrity Level) 3 according to EN 62061, CAT 4 according to EN954-1 as well as Performance Level e (PL e) according to EN ISO 13849-1.|$|E
50|$|This {{is by far}} {{the largest}} group of {{components}} and includes binary and analog I/O modules, stack lights, push buttons, sensors with integrated ASIC, valve control boxes, <b>E-stops,</b> light curtains; in general any device that can exchange data with the PLC. Each module on the network must have a unique address. For AS-Interface the address space ranges from 0 to 31, where 0 cannot be used, but is reserved for Automatic Single Node Replacement. Since adoption of specification 2.11 this address space is further divided into A and B extended addresses. As a result, using a module designed to support this addressing mode, it is possible to have two modules at each address; one at the A half and one at the B half. (Ex. 1A and 1B, 17A and 17B)The current specification Version 3.0 has added the ability to construct many new types of I/O combinations, including binary modules with 4 inputs and 4 outputs supporting A/B addressing.|$|R
50|$|A kill switch, {{also known}} as an {{emergency}} stop (<b>e-stop)</b> or emergency power off (EPO), is a safety mechanism used to shut off a device or machinery in an emergency situation in which it cannot be shut down in the usual manner. Unlike a normal shut-down switch/procedure, which shuts down all systems {{in an orderly fashion}} and turns the machine off without damaging it, a kill switch is designed and configured to completely and as quickly as possible abort the operation (even if this damages equipment) and be operable {{in a manner that is}} quick and simple (so that even a panicking operator with impaired executive function or a bystander can activate it). Kill switches are usually designed so as to be obvious even to an untrained operator or a bystander.|$|E
40|$|Neuronal microtubules are {{stabilized}} by two calmodulin-regulated microtubule associated proteins, <b>E-STOP</b> and N-STOP, whose suppression in mice induces severe synaptic {{and behavioral}} deficits. Here {{we show that}} mature neurons also contain a 21 kD STOP-like protein, SL 21, which shares calmodulin-binding and microtubulestabilizing homology domains with STOP proteins. Accordingly, in different biochemical or cellular assays, SL 21 has calmodulin-binding and microtubulestabilizing activity. However, in cultured hippocampal neurons, SL 21 antibodies principally stain the somatic Golgi and punctate Golgi material in neurites. In cycling cells, transfected SL 21 decorates microtubules when expressed at high levels but is otherwise principally visible at the Golgi. The Golgi targeting of SL 21 depends {{on the presence of}} cysteine residues located within the SL 21 N-terminal domain, suggesting that Golgi targeting may require SL 21 palmitoylation. Accordingly we find that SL 21 is palmitoylated in vivo. N-STOP and <b>E-STOP,</b> which contain the Golg...|$|E

40|$|International audienceRegulation of {{microtubule}} dynamics {{is crucial}} for axon growth and guidance {{as well as for}} the establishment of synaptic connections. STOPs (Stable Tubule Only Polypeptides) are microtubule-associated proteins that regulate microtubule stabilization but are also able to interact with actin or Golgi membranes. Here, we have investigated the involvement of STOPs during the development of the olfactory system. We first describe the spatio-temporal expression patterns of N- and <b>E-STOP,</b> the two neuronal-specific isoforms of STOP. E- and N-STOP are expressed in the axonal compartment of olfactory sensory neurons, but are differentially regulated during development. Interestingly, each neuronal isoform displays a specific gradient distribution within the olfactory nerve layer. Then, we have examined the development of the olfactory system in the absence of STOPs. Olfactory axons display a normal outgrowth and targeting in STOP-null mice, but maturation of the synapses in the glomerular neuropil is altered...|$|E
40|$|Teleoperated robots {{are playing}} an {{increasingly}} important role in military actions and medical services. In the future, remotely operated surgical robots will likely be used in more scenarios such as battlefields and emergency response. But rapidly growing applications of teleoperated surgery raise the question; what if the computer systems for these robots are attacked, taken over and even turned into weapons? Our work seeks {{to answer this question}} by systematically analyzing possible cyber security attacks against Raven II, an advanced teleoperated robotic surgery system. We identify a slew of possible cyber security threats, and experimentally evaluate their scopes and impacts. We demonstrate the ability to maliciously control a wide range of robots functions, and even to completely ignore or override command inputs from the surgeon. We further find {{that it is possible to}} abuse the robot's existing emergency stop (<b>E-stop)</b> mechanism to execute efficient (single packet) attacks. We then consider steps to mitigate these identified attacks, and experimentally evaluate the feasibility of applying the existing security solutions against these threats. The broader goal of our paper, however, is to raise awareness and increase understanding of these emerging threats. We anticipate that the majority of attacks against telerobotic surgery will also be relevant to other teleoperated robotic and co-robotic systems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Neuronal {{differentiation}} {{and function}} require extensive stabilization of the microtubule cytoskeleton. Neurons contain {{a large proportion}} of microtubules that resist the cold and depolymerizing drugs and exhibit slow subunit turnover. The origin of this stabilization is unclear. Here we have examined the role of STOP, a calmodulin-regulated protein previously isolated from cold-stable brain microtubules. We find that neuronal cells express increasing levels of STOP and of STOP variants during differentiation. These STOP proteins are associated with {{a large proportion of}} microtubules in neuronal cells, and are concentrated on cold-stable, drug-resistant, and long-lived polymers. STOP inhibition abolishes microtubule cold and drug stability in established neurites and impairs neurite formation. Thus, STOP proteins are responsible for microtubule stabilization in neurons, and are apparently required for normal neurite formation. Key words: neuron • STOP • <b>E-STOP</b> • microtubuleassociated protein • calmodulin Neurons establish connections with other cells over long distances. To do this, the rounded neuronal cell body produces axodendritic extensions. Microtubules {{play a key role in}} this remarkable morphogenetic process (Yamada et al., 1970; Drubin et al., 1985; Burgoyne, 1991). A salient feature of neuronal microtubules, thought to be intimately related to their morphogenetic function, is the stability of their assembly state. Neurons contain a high proportion of stable microtubules that resist exposure to cold temperature and to depolymerizin...|$|E

The underlying principle of the design was to integrate complex functions into a very flexible system that can be applied to any of NRC's model testing requirements, field trials with models or full scale trials systems. The modularity of the system includes hardware and software aspects, that allow the experiment designer to tailor component content to their exact requirements, and makes it efficient to implement.
