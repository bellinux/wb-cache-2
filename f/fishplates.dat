25|$|The downriver voyage {{began on}} July 2, 1890 {{at the dock}} near where the new large bridge of the Canadian Pacific Railway crossed the Columbia River. Lytton then steamed over to the Revelstoke smelter dock, where 65 tons of steel rails, <b>fishplates</b> and other track {{building}} supplies were loaded on board.|$|E
25|$|Rails are {{produced}} in fixed lengths {{and need to}} be joined end-to-end to make a continuous surface on which trains may run. The traditional method of joining the rails is to bolt them together using metal <b>fishplates</b> (jointbars in the US), producing jointed track. For more modern usage, particularly where higher speeds are required, the lengths of rail may be welded together to form continuous welded rail (CWR).|$|E
25|$|The {{gauge of}} the new iron railway line {{was the same as}} the wooden railway and it was 4.6 miles in length, falling {{continuously}} from Lady Anne pit 440 feet above the track on the pier at St David's. The rails were 28lbs per yard fish-bellied, procured from the Bedlington Iron Company. They were held in 9lb iron chairs secure to whinstone block sleepers by two iron pegs. The joint sleeper blocks were double width and there were no <b>fishplates.</b>|$|E

50|$|At a {{press conference}} {{the day after the}} accident, an SNCF {{director}} stated that the failure of a <b>fishplate</b> (rail joint) was the cause of the accident, confirmed in the third SNCF press conference by supporting photographs. According to Guillaume Pepy, the SNCF president, the <b>fishplate</b> broke away from the rails and became lodged {{in the middle of the}} switch, causing the derailment.|$|R
25|$|Supply trains carried all the {{necessary}} material for the construction up to the railhead, with mule or horse-drawn wagons carrying it {{the rest of the}} ways if required. Ties were typically unloaded from horse-drawn or mule-drawn wagons and then placed on the track ballast and levelled {{to get ready for the}} rails. Rails, which weighed the most, were often kicked off the flatcars and carried by gangs of men on each side of the rail to where needed. The rails just in front of the rail car would be placed first, measured for the correct gauge with gauge sticks and then nailed down on the ties with spike mauls. The <b>fishplates</b> connecting the ends of the rails would be bolted on and then the car pushed by hand to the end of the rail and rail installation repeated.|$|E
25|$|In August 1942, Hawker’s {{second test}} pilot, Ken Seth-Smith, while {{deputising}} for Chief Test Pilot Philip Lucas, {{carried out a}} straight and level speed test from Hawker’s test centre at Langley, and the aircraft broke up over Thorpe, killing the pilot. Sydney Camm and the design team immediately ruled out pilot error, which had been suspected in earlier crashes. Investigation revealed that the elevator mass-balance had torn away from the fuselage structure. Intense flutter developed, the structure failed and the tail broke away. Modification 286 to the structure and the control runs partially solved the structural problem. (The 1940 Philip Lucas test flight incident had been due to an unrelated failing.) Mod 286, which involved fastening external <b>fishplates,</b> or reinforcing plates, around {{the tail of the}} aircraft, and eventually internal strengthening, was only a partial remedy, and there were still failures right up {{to the end of the}} Typhoon's service life. The Sabre engine was also a constant source of problems, notably in colder weather, when it was very difficult to start, and it suffered problems with wear of its sleeve valves, with consequently high oil consumption. The 24-cylinder engine also produced a very high-pitched engine note, which pilots found very fatiguing.|$|E
500|$|In 1879 the Chairman, Lord Provost Leslie, {{died and}} was {{replaced}} by William Ferguson of Kinmundy. The following year both the Secretary and General Manager resigned and William Moffatt was appointed to both posts, and A.G. Reid became Superintendent of the Line. The railway was now paying a dividend and seeing increased traffic, but rolling stock, track, signals and stations all needed replacing in a project that was to cost £250,000 (...) [...] By June 1880 the main line was doubled as far as Kintore, and {{over the next five years}} [...] of iron rail track, much of it without <b>fishplates,</b> was replaced with steel rails and the main line doubled to Inveramsay. The railway had acquired a reputation for running slow trains on a perverse timetable and ill-treating its passengers, and now resolved to address this. By the mid-1880s services were faster, there was upholstery in third class and the branches saw an accelerated service as a result of running fewer mixed trains.|$|E
50|$|The SNCF {{released}} its initial findings on 13 July 2013, {{reporting that the}} derailment {{appeared to have been}} caused by a track failure. A steel <b>fishplate</b> connecting two rails came loose 200 m from the station at a set of switches, and became stuck in them. The last axle of the third carriage is thought {{to be the first to}} have hit the <b>fishplate.</b>|$|R

50|$|In rail terminology, a <b>fishplate,</b> {{splice bar}} or joint bar is a metal bar that is {{bolted to the}} ends of two rails to join them {{together}} in a track. The name is derived from fish, a wooden bar with a curved profile used to strengthen a ship's mast. The top and bottom edges are tapered inwards so the device wedges itself between {{the top and bottom of}} the rail when it is bolted into place. In rail transport modelling, a <b>fishplate</b> is often a small copper or nickel silver plate that slips onto both rails to provide the functions of maintaining alignment and electrical continuity.|$|R
2500|$|Jointed {{track is}} made using lengths of rail, usually around [...] long (in the UK) and [...] long (in North America), bolted {{together}} using perforated steel plates known as <b>fishplates</b> (UK) or joint bars (North America).|$|E
2500|$|<b>Fishplates</b> {{are usually}} [...] long, used in pairs {{either side of}} the rail ends and bolted {{together}} (usually four, but sometimes six bolts per joint). The bolts may be oppositely-oriented so that {{in the event of a}} derailment and a wheel flange striking the joint, only some of the bolts will be sheared, reducing the likelihood of the rails misaligning with each other and exacerbating the seriousness of the derailment. This technique is not applied universally, European practice being to have all the bolt heads on the same side of the rail. Small gaps which function as expansion joints are deliberately left between the rail ends to allow for expansion of the rails in hot weather. European practice was to have the rail joints on both rails adjacent to each other, while North American practice is to stagger them.|$|E
2500|$|During {{production}} of the first batch of 100 Tempest V [...] "Series Is", distinguishable by their serial number prefix JNxxx, several improvements were progressively introduced and were used from the outset on all succeeding Tempest V [...] "Series 2s", with serial number prefixes EJ, NV and SN. The fuselage/empennage joint originally featured 20 external reinforcing [...] "fishplates", similar to those fitted to the Typhoon, {{but it was not}} long before the rear fuselage was strengthened and, with the <b>fishplates</b> no longer being needed, the rear fuselage became detachable. [...] The first series of Tempest Vs used a built-up rear spar pick-up/bulkhead assembly (just behind the cockpit) which was adapted from the Typhoon. Small blisters on the upper rear wing root fairing covered the securing bolts. This was later changed to a new forged, lightweight assembly which connected to new spar booms: the upper wing root blisters were replaced by small [...] "teardrop" [...] fairings under the wings.|$|E

2500|$|Finally, a [...] iron bar, {{described}} in court as a railway <b>fishplate,</b> was dropped on him. Bulger suffered ten skull fractures {{as a result}} of the iron bar striking his head. Dr Alan Williams, the case's pathologist, stated that Bulger suffered so many injuries—42 in total—that none could be isolated as the fatal blow.|$|R

2500|$|Track ballast was put {{between the}} ties as they progressed. Where a proper railbed {{had already been}} prepared, the work progressed rapidly. Constantly needed {{supplies}} included [...] "food, water, ties, rails, spikes, <b>fishplates,</b> nuts and bolts, track ballast, telegraph poles, wire, fire wood (or coal on the UP) and water for the steam train locomotives, etc." [...] After a flatcar was unloaded, it would usually be hooked to a small locomotive and pulled back to a siding, so another flatcar with rails etc. could be advanced to the railhead. Since juggling railroad cars took time on flat ground, where wagon transport was easier, the rail cars would {{be brought to the}} end of the line by steam locomotive, unloaded, and the flat car returned immediately to a siding for another loaded car of either ballast or rails. Temporary sidings were often installed where it could be easily done to expedite getting needed supplies to the railhead.|$|E
60|$|Lieutenant Girouard, to whom {{everything}} was entrusted, {{was told to}} make the necessary estimates. Sitting in his hut at Wady Halfa, he drew up a comprehensive list. Nothing was forgotten. Every want was provided for; every difficulty was foreseen; every requisite was noted. The questions to be decided were numerous and involved. How much carrying capacity was required? How much rolling stock? How many engines? What spare parts? How much oil? How many lathes? How many cutters? How many punching and shearing machines? What arrangements of signals would be necessary? How many lamps? How many points? How many trolleys? What amount of coal should be ordered? How much water would be wanted? How should it be carried? To what extent would its carriage affect the hauling power and influence all previous calculations? How much railway plant was needed? How many miles of rail? How many thousand sleepers? Where could they be procured at such short notice? How many <b>fishplates</b> were necessary? What tools would be required? What appliances? What machinery? How much skilled labour was wanted? How much of the class of labour available? How were the workmen to be fed and watered? How much food would they want? How many trains a day must be run to feed them and their escort? How many must be run to carry plant? How did these requirements affect the estimate for rolling stock? The answers to all these questions, and to many others with which I will not inflict the reader, were set forth by Lieutenant Girouard in a ponderous volume several inches thick; and such was the comprehensive accuracy of the estimate that the working parties were never delayed by the want even of a piece of brass wire.|$|E

25|$|Jointed rails {{were used}} {{at first because}} {{contemporary}} technology did not offer any alternative. However, the intrinsic weakness in resisting vertical loading results in the ballast becoming depressed and a heavy maintenance workload is imposed to prevent unacceptable geometrical defects at the joints. The joints also needed to be lubricated, and wear at the <b>fishplate</b> (joint bar) mating surfaces needed to be rectified by shimming. For this reason jointed track is not financially appropriate for heavily operated railroads.|$|R

5000|$|On 12 July 2013, {{the last}} four cars of an SNCF Paris-Limoges train left the track while {{entering}} the Brétigny-sur-Orge station, killing seven people and injuring 32. The French land transport accident investigation bureau BEA-TT concluded in an interim report published on 10 January 2014 that [...] "the derailment {{was caused by a}} <b>fishplate</b> obstructing the flangeway of an oblique crossing forming part of a double slip. Under the weight of the train travelling at 137 km/h, the <b>fishplate</b> had pivoted around the first of four bolts meant to hold it in place, the three others having come loose. The most likely cause of the bolts coming loose, says BEA-TT, were stresses caused by cracking in the cast steel crossing. This had caused the head of the third bolt to break off and the others to fail, one becoming unscrewed and the heads of the other two also shearing off." [...] Recommendations included improving agency expertise in bolted track joints, clarification and reinforcement of regulations for defect detection and repair, and identification of switches and crossings where higher levels of maintenance and early renewal should be implemented.|$|R
50|$|William Bridges Adams (1797 - 23 July 1872) was an author, {{inventor}} and locomotive engineer.

2500|$|At Port Alfred, engine no. 9 {{was officially}} named Frontier. Since it was painted black at the time, {{it came to}} be affectionately known as Blackie.

25|$|Through {{the use of}} low wing- and span-loading to {{generate}} greater effectiveness than conventional counterparts, the Islander could lift considerably heavier payloads than the typical aircraft in its power, weight or cost classes. To reduce manufacturing costs, both the wings and tail surfaces maintain a constant chord and thickness, while the ribs within the aircraft's wing are all identical; both rivets and external <b>fishplate</b> joints are used for the same purpose. The type was originally intended to use a fabric-and-steel design. A light alloy monocoque approach was adopted instead. The structure is designed to give rise to and experience low levels of stress, and has an infinite fatigue life without testing.|$|R
