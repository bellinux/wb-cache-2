5|$|A strong {{ridge of}} high {{pressure}} over the northeastern Pacific Ocean forced John westward, where upper level wind shear kept John a tropical storm. Intensity fluctuated considerably, however, as shear levels varied. More than once, shear cleared away {{most of the}} clouds above John and nearly caused it to weaken to a tropical depression. However, after eight days of slow westward movement across the Pacific Ocean, shear lessened greatly on August 19, and John intensified significantly and was designated as a hurricane at 1700 PDT. During an eighteen-hour period between August 19 and August 20, John further strengthened from a weak Category 1 hurricane to a major Category 3 hurricane. Around 1100 PDT on August 20, it crossed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>central</b> Pacific, {{the first of three}} basin crosses John would make.|$|E
5|$|A weak {{tropical}} wave located {{over the}} open Pacific Ocean organized into Tropical Depression Fifteen-E on October 22. It strengthened into {{a tropical storm}} the next day. Shortly afterwards, wind shear increased. Lowell's convection was disrupted, and its center of circulation became exposed. The cyclone crossed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility on October 26. The shear relaxed, and the depression restrengthened into a tropical storm. Lowell drifted in slow steering currents until it approached Hurricane Huko. The proximity of Huko caused a gradual weakening in Lowell, and it dissipated on October 31.|$|E
5|$|Climatologically, {{tropical}} cyclones are steered primarily westward by the east-to-west {{trade winds}} on the equatorial {{side of the}} subtropical ridge—a persistent high-pressure area over the world's subtropical oceans. In the tropical North Atlantic and Northeast Pacific oceans, the trade winds steer tropical easterly waves westward from the African coast toward the Caribbean Sea, North America, and ultimately <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>central</b> Pacific Ocean before the waves dampen out. These waves are the precursors to many tropical cyclones within this region. In contrast, in the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific in both hemispheres, tropical cyclogenesis is influenced less by tropical easterly waves and more by the seasonal movement of the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone and the monsoon trough. Additionally, tropical cyclone motion can be influenced by transient weather systems, such as extratropical cyclones.|$|E

At the new Miami Central Station, the Orange Line connects with the new MIA Mover which runs directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>central</b> terminal of the airport. Miami International Airport has over 35 million annual passengers is the county's largest employer. Thus the Orange Line is believed to create {{a significant increase in}} Metrorail ridership. The new Miami Central Station is expected to eventually attract 7,500 daily passengers to Metrorail. The project was completed on time and under budget.|$|E
5|$|Dolores {{continued}} to intensify and it reached a peak windspeed of , a strong Category 1 hurricane, two days later. Meanwhile, Dolores {{became the first}} hurricane in over two years to cross longitude 125°W. Shortly thereafter, the hurricane started losing strength as it moved over cooler waters. The eye dissipated from satellite imagery while the associated thunderstorm activity became sheared. Dolores weakened back into a tropical storm on July 10 and a tropical depression the next day. The cyclone then crossed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility (west of longitude 140°W) while producing minimal shower activity.

5|$|During the 1920s, many navies were {{pursuing}} the flotilla leader concept, building large destroyers {{similar to the}} World War I Royal Navy V and W-class destroyers. In the interwar French Navy, these ships were known as contre-torpilleurs, and were intended to operate with smaller destroyers, or as half-flotillas of three ships. The idea was that such a half-flotilla could defeat an Italian light cruiser of the Condottieri class. The Navy of the KSCS decided to build three such flotilla leaders, ships that would {{have the ability to}} reach high speeds and with a long endurance. The long endurance requirement reflected Yugoslav plans to deploy the ships <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>central</b> Mediterranean, where {{they would be able to}} operate alongside French and British warships.|$|E

5|$|During the El Niño of 1991–92, as typical {{with other}} such events, the monsoon trough {{extended}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>central</b> north Pacific Ocean, {{which is the}} body of water between the International Date Line and 140°W. At the same time, sea surface temperatures near the equator were anomalously warm, and wind shear values were low. At the end of January, a large area of convection persisted for several days near {{the north side of}} the equator. By January 23, several ships reported squalls and strong southwesterly winds in the region. The Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) began monitoring the system on January 26, while it was located about 950miles (1530km) south of Ka Lae, the southernmost point in Hawaii. The disturbance organized further as it tracked westward, and on January 28 it developed into Tropical Depression One-C, located a short distance north of Kiritimati and east of Tabuaeran.|$|E
5|$|During the {{afternoon}} hours of February10, 2009, a strong, {{middle and upper}} storm system moved across the Four Corners region <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>central</b> and southern Great Plains. A moist, low-level air mass streamed northward across Texas and Louisiana into eastern Oklahoma and the Ozarks ahead of the system. Daytime heating of the moistening boundary layer increased throughout {{the afternoon}} across Oklahoma and Texas as cloud cover shifted eastward. Cooling aloft, {{in conjunction with the}} approaching storm system, led to atmospheric instability, resulting in thunderstorms. A very strong wind field increased with height through the lower troposphere, resulting in a wind shear favorable for rotation in the thunderstorms.|$|E

Many of Duyệt's subordinates were arrested and 16 of his family members were executed. This action prompted the Duyệt's officials—fearful of their positions and security under the central system—to launch a revolt under the leadership of his adopted son Lê Văn Khôi. Historical opinion is divided with scholars contesting whether the humiliation of Duyệt or the loss of southern autonomy was the main catalyst.|$|E
