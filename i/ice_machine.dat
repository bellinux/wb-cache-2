5|$|After Lillehammer {{was awarded}} the 1994 Winter Olympics in 1988, it became {{necessary}} to build a larger venue to hold the Olympic ice hockey matches. The name of the arena was decided by the Lillehammer Municipal Council in October 1988, {{as part of a}} broader branding policy, based on the history of the Birkebeiner. Originally the administration had suggested the new larger hall be named Håkons Hall, after Haakon Haakonarson, later king of Norway, while the smaller hall would be named Sveres Hall, for Sverre Sigurdsson. During the political debate, a number of female councilors suggested that the smaller hall be named Kristins Hall, for Sigurdsson's daughter Kristina Sverresdotter, which was passed by the city council. Kristin and Håkon would be used to name the mascots for the Olympics. Kristins Hall has had small renovations throughout the years, including an upgrade in 2007 which included new ice hockey sideboards, a new <b>ice</b> <b>machine,</b> a new lighting system, and a new handball floor.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{location}} of Aransas bay, shipping {{has always been a}} major industry. Following the Civil War, the meatpacking industry became a major source of income for ports on the bay, especially Rockport and Fulton, where numerous slaughterhouses were constructed. In the early years of meatpacking, cattle were slaughtered strictly for their hide since {{there was no way to}} refrigerate the meat. As a result, most of the left over cow parts not used as pig feed, were disposed in the bay. This changed in 1871, when an <b>ice</b> <b>machine</b> was installed in a packing plant. By this time, the meatpacking industry near Aransas Bay reached its prime. Prior to the decline of the industry in the area, in 1880, 93% of the beef from Texas slaughterhouses were processed in Rockport-Fulton. Along with fishing, oyster farming and most notably shrimping became major industries on the bay in the early 20th century. Shipbuilding also developed and reached its prime following the first World War. During World War II, the United States Navy took over several shipyards. In 1936, oil was discovered on the bay. By 1946, 13 wells were in operation. In 1990, 498,703 barrels were produced, part of the 77 million barrels produced between 1936 and 1990. Today, tourism is a prosperous industry. Numerous hotels are set up along the bay for individuals wanting to fish, bird or sight-see. A large concentration of hotels are located in Rockport, where the bay's only beach (Rockport Beach) is located.|$|E

25|$|In 1849, Apalachicola {{physician}} Dr. John Gorrie (1802–1855) {{discovered the}} cold-air process of refrigeration and patented an <b>ice</b> <b>machine</b> in 1850. He had experimented {{to find ways}} to lower the high temperatures of fever patients. His patent laid the groundwork for development of modern refrigeration and air conditioning, making Florida and the South more livable year round. The city has a monument to him, and a replica of his <b>ice</b> <b>machine</b> is on display in the John Gorrie Museum. The John Gorrie Memorial Bridge, originally built in 1935 and rebuilt in 1988, carries U.S. 98 across Apalachicola Bay to Eastpoint.|$|E
500|$|Uecker led Kennedy {{through the}} kitchen area, holding Kennedy's right wrist but {{frequently}} releasing it as Kennedy shook hands with those he encountered.

Kennedy turned to his left and shook hands with busboy Juan Romero just as Sirhan Sirhan stepped down from a low tray-stacker beside the <b>ice</b> <b>machine,</b> rushed past Uecker, and repeatedly fired what was later identified as a [...]22 caliber Iver-Johnson Cadet revolver.|$|E
2500|$|The hotel {{had a large}} {{dining room}} and two private dining rooms, along with [...] "Ye Colonial Tea Room" [...] and a pink and apple green ballroom. Milk and cream came from the hotel's Jersey cows and ice from the hotel's <b>ice</b> <b>machine.</b> The Edgewood Orchestra played for guests twice a day in an outdoor summerhouse covered in wisteria. For women there was a {{reception}} room, parlor and writing room were available. Also in the hotel were a billiard room, barbershop, and a reading and writing room for men. The hotel also had a smoking alcove, card rooms, and a nine-hole golf course, along with tennis courts and a clubhouse known as a [...] "casino" [...] with a bowling alley, a hall for dances, a stage, dressing rooms and a reading room. Individual cottages were also on the property. The Edgewood had 82 straff rooms, a 22-room building for chauffeurs. The Alfred S. Amer Co. was the original owner and sold the property for $160,000 in 1917. In 1920 the property was again sold, and in 1932 the Beechwood School leased the hotel for 10 years, opening Edgewood Park Junior College. But the school closed in 1940, the hotel's furnishings were sold at auction, and the Barnum Wrecking Co. of Bridgeport razed the building.|$|E

60|$|The Samoset {{had been}} a trading schooner, when Duncan bought her in San Francisco and made alterations. Her {{interior}} was wholly rebuilt, so that the hold became main-cabin and staterooms, while abaft amidships were installed engines, a dynamo, an <b>ice</b> <b>machine,</b> storage batteries, and, far in the stern, gasoline tanks. Necessarily, she carried a small crew. Boyd, Minnie, and Captain Dettmar were the only whites on board, though Lorenzo, the small and greasy engineer, laid a part claim to white, being a Portuguese half-caste. A Japanese served as cook, and a Chinese as cabin boy. Four white sailors had constituted the original crew for'ard, but {{one by one they}} had yielded to the charms of palm-waving South Sea isles and been replaced by islanders. Thus, one of the dusky sailors hailed from Easter Island, a second from the Carolines, a third from the Paumotus, while the fourth was a gigantic Samoan. At sea, Boyd Duncan, himself a navigator, stood a mate's watch with Captain Dettmar, and both of them took a wheel or lookout occasionally. On a pinch, Minnie herself could take a wheel, and it was on pinches that she proved herself more dependable at steering than did the native sailors.|$|E
6000|$|Wednesday.--I {{have been}} very neglectful. A return to work, perhaps premature, but necessary, has used up all my {{possible}} energies, and made me acquainted with the living headache. I just jot {{down some of the}} past notabilia. Yesterday B., a carpenter, and K., my (unsuccessful) white man, were absent all morning from their work; I was working myself, where I hear every sound with morbid certainty, and I can testify that not a hammer fell. Upon inquiry I found they had passed the morning making ice with our <b>ice</b> <b>machine</b> and taking the horizon with a spirit level! I had no sooner heard this than--a violent headache set in; I am a real employer of labour now, and have much of the ship captain when aroused; and if I had a headache, I believe both these gentlemen had aching hearts. I promise you, the late ---- was to the front; and K., who was the most guilty, yet (in a sense) the least blameable, having the brains and character of a canary-bird, fared none the better for B.'s repartees. I hear them hard at work this morning, so the menace may be blessed. It was just after my dinner, just before theirs, that I administered my redoubtable tongue--it is really redoubtable--to these skulkers. (Paul used to triumph over Mr. J. for weeks. [...] "I am very sorry for you," [...] he would say; [...] "you're going to have a talk with Mr. Stevenson when he comes home: you don't know what that is!") In fact, none of them do, till they get it. I have known K., for instance, for months; he has never heard me complain, or take notice, unless it were to praise; I have used him always as my guest, {{and there seems to be}} something in my appearance which suggests endless, ovine long-suffering! We sat in the upper verandah all evening, and discussed the price of iron roofing, and the state of the draught-horses, with Innes, a new man we have taken, and who seems to promise well.|$|E
