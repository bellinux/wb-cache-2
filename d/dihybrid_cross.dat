50|$|If multifactorial {{inheritance}} {{is indeed}} the case, then the chance of the patient contracting the disease is reduced only if cousins and more distant relatives have the disease. It must be stated that while multifactorially-inherited diseases tend to run in families, inheritance will not follow the same pattern as a simple monohybrid or <b>dihybrid</b> <b>cross.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Dihybrid</b> <b>cross</b> is a {{cross between}} two {{different}} lines (varieties, strains) that differ in two observed traits. In the Mendelian sense, between the alleles of both these loci {{there is a relationship}} of complete dominance - recessive.In the example pictured to the right, RRYY/rryy parents result in F1 offspring that are heterozygous for both R and Y (RrYy).|$|E
50|$|The forked-line method (also {{known as}} the tree method and the {{branching}} system) can also solve <b>dihybrid</b> and multihybrid <b>crosses.</b> A problem is converted {{to a series of}} monohybrid crosses, and the results are combined in a tree. However, a tree produces the same result as a Punnett square in less time and with more clarity. The example below assesses another double-heterozygote cross using RrYy x RrYy. As stated above, the phenotypic ratio is expected to be 9:3:3:1 if crossing unlinked genes from two double-heterozygotes. The genotypic ratio was obtained in the diagram below, this diagram will have more branches than if only analyzing for phenotypic ratio.|$|R
40|$|Lentils are an {{inexpensive}} source of protein, vitamins and minerals. Lentil seeds contain carotenoids that have antioxidant properties and {{play an important}} nutritional role as precursors of vitamin A. Improving concentration of carotenoids in lentils has potential as component of a bio-fortification program. The understanding of the genetic control of carotenoids in lentil will help breeders develop strategies for developing varieties with higher carotenoid concentration. The objectives of this research program were to evaluate the concentration of carotenoids in mature lentil seeds and to identify genomic regions that possibly influence carotenoid concentration. The experimental program involved: i) 	analyzing the carotenoid concentration in seeds produced from the specific crosses among lentil genotypes with three cotyledon colours using high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) ii) 	analyzing an association mapping panel to develop potential single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for genes associated with carotenoid concentration For the first objective, <b>dihybrid</b> <b>crosses</b> were made between lentil cultivars with red, yellow and green cotyledons. Hybridized lentil populations were grown in the greenhouse and phytotron chamber up to the F 3 generation and then seeds were analyzed for carotenoid concentration. As expected, the expression of red cotyledon colour was dominant over yellow, and these two cotyledon colours were inhibited by an epistatic interaction with green cotyledon colour. Lentil seeds with green cotyledon colour had higher carotenoid concentration than red cotyledon types which in turn had higher carotenoid concentration compared to yellow cotyledon lentils. Identifying molecular markers associated with carotenoids {{can be part of}} a crop improvement strategy for both marker-assisted selection and marker-assisted breeding (MAS; MAB). Association mapping using broad genetic materials might result in high resolution. For this purpose an association mapping panel of 143 lentil genotypes was grown at two different locations near Saskatoon, Canada, in 2011 and 2012. Concentration of three carotenoids in lentil seed samples was measured using reverse phase HPLC. Of the 143 genotypes, 60 accessions were common for both years and locations. Concentrations of lutein, zeaxanthin and violaxanthin in seed samples were determined. Genotyping was accomplished using 1536 SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) markers of an Illumina Golden-Gate assay. It was determined that 168 of the SNP markers were significantly associated with carotenoid concentration components using the GLM (generalized linear model) model. These putative SNPs could be used for MAS and MAB to improve selection for carotenoids in lentil to increase the nutritional value of lentil...|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} example {{illustrates a}} <b>dihybrid</b> <b>cross</b> between two double-heterozygote pea plants. R represents the dominant allele for shape (round), while r represents the recessive allele (wrinkled). A represents the dominant allele for color (yellow), while a represents the recessive allele (green). If each plant has the genotype RrAa, {{and since the}} alleles for shape and color genes are independent, then they can produce four types of gametes with all possible combinations: RA, Ra, rA, and ra.|$|E
50|$|The Law of Independent Assortment {{states that}} alleles for {{separate}} traits are passed independently {{of one another}} from parents to offspring. That is, the biological selection of an allele for one trait {{has nothing to do with}} the selection of an allele for any other trait. Mendel found support for this law in his <b>dihybrid</b> <b>cross</b> experiments (Fig. 1). In his monohybrid crosses, an idealized 3:1 ratio between dominant and recessive phenotypes resulted. In dihybrid crosses, however, he found a 9:3:3:1 ratios (Fig. 2). This shows that each of the two alleles is inherited independently from the other, with a 3:1 phenotypic ratio for each.|$|E

In this example, coat color {{is indicated by}} B (brown, dominant) or b (white), while tail length is indicated by S (short, dominant) or s (long). When parents are homozygous for each trait (SSbb and ssBB), {{their children in the}} F1 generation are heterozygous at both loci and only show the dominant phenotypes (SsbB). If the children mate with each other, in the F2 generation all combinations of coat color and tail length occur: 9 are brown/short (purple boxes), 3 are white/short (pink boxes), 3 are brown/long (blue boxes) and 1 is white/long (green box).|$|E
50|$|Thus, due to {{the nature}} of {{polygenic}} traits, inheritance will not follow the same pattern as a simple monohybrid or <b>dihybrid</b> <b>cross.</b> Polygenic inheritance can be explained as Mendelian inheritance at many loci, resulting in a trait which is normally-distributed. If n is the number of involved loci, then the coefficients of the binomial expansion of (a + b)2n will give the frequency of distribution of all n allele combinations. For a sufficiently high values of n, this binomial distribution will begin to resemble a normal distribution. From this viewpoint, a disease state will become apparent at one of the tails of the distribution, past some threshold value. Disease states of increasing severity will be expected the further one goes past the threshold and away from the mean.|$|E
40|$|Many of {{the same}} {{features}} of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that have made it so useful as a genetics and molecular biology research organism make it equally useful as a teaching organism. Furthermore, {{the fact that it}} is a modern research organism makes it all the more exciting to students and teachers. The unique characteristic of yeast as a unicellular, eukaryotic organism with a complete sexual life cycle is ideal for teaching. A simple monohybrid cross to explore dominance and recessiveness, a <b>dihybrid</b> <b>cross</b> to demonstrate independent assortment, pigmented adenine auxotrophs for investigating the fundamentals of gene action, and easily measured responses to ultraviolet readiation provide an array of appropriate laboratory tools that put real science in the hands of students and teachers. Direct collaborations between scientists and science teachers bring together complementing knowledge and experience, providing an effective and efficient way to adapt and simplify techniques and procedures to accommodate time and money constraints. Collaborations quickly identify technical and theoretical problems that must be solved for implementation in classrooms. They also provide a continuing stimulus to teachers and students to participate in the research process...|$|E
40|$|VARIATIONS in {{the color}} of corn kernels (Zeamays L.) have {{attracted}} geneticists since theearly 1900 s when studies on the inheritance patterns of kernel color helped validate classical genetics. Even now, research scientists investigate the molecular genetics of these characteristics, and students in introductory biology and genetics courses learn more about monohybrid and dihybrid crosses by studying the inheritance of kernel colors. The reasons for introducing corn genetics in the classroom are obvious—a single ear holds {{a large number of}} progeny and a variety of ears are available that represent basic inheritance patterns, such as the monohybrid cross (3 : 1), the <b>dihybrid</b> <b>cross</b> (9 : 3 : 3 : 1), and more complex genetic patterns illustrating gene interactions (12 : 3 : 1; 9 : 3 : 4, 13 : 3; 9 : 7, etc.). In addition, these ears are obtained readily from several biological supply houses and are relatively inexpensive, espe-cially since students can use them for several years. Students usually confirm different phenotypic ratios of the F 2 generation by first counting kernels, then performing chi-square analyses to test their data. However, their experience can be enriched by introducing explanations about the nature of each gene and its mutations, the related metabolic path-ways, and their locations within the kernel. I have included information in this review that would be appropriate at different levels—from high school biol-ogy to introductory genetics at the college level. The purpose is the same. By exploring these areas, stu-dents more fully understand how these simple pheno-typic ratios and variations are derived. Four Kernel Colors, Four Genes Three of the four kernel colors—yellow, red and purple—are produced by pigments synthesized from one of two metabolic pathways, the carotenoid (yel-low pigments) or the anthocyanin (red and purple pigments) pathway. White, the fourth color, results from the lack of pigments produced from either pathway. The synthesis of each pigment require...|$|E
