40|$|Abstract This work {{represents}} one of the first successful applications of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) for interdisciplinary coastal research. A monitoring mission to study the shape and estimate the initial dilution of the S. Jacinto sewage outfall plume using an AUV was performed on July 2002. An efficient sampling strategy enabling greater improvements in spatial and temporal range of detection demonstrated that the sewage effluent plume can be clearly traced using naturally occurring tracers in the wastewater. The outfall plume was found at the surface highly influenced by the weak stratification and low currents. Dilution varying with distance downstream was estimated from the plume rise over the outfall diffuser until a nearly constant value of 130 : 1, 60 m from the diffuser, indicating the near field end. Our results demonstrate that AUVs can provide high-quality measurements of physical properties of effluent plumes in a very effective manner <b>and</b> <b>valuable</b> <b>considerations</b> about the initial mixing processes under real oceanic conditions can be further investigated...|$|R

According to Tregelles, textual critic, it has many <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>valuable</b> readings, but according to another textual critic Kenyon the text of the codex has not remarkable value, because the manuscript is late. According to Gregory, textual critic, it has many old readings, older than Byzantine text-type. Hermann von Soden, textual critic, who designated codex by ε 71, classified it to the textual family Iκa and provenance of this text associated with Jerusalem.|$|R
30|$|Enjoyment {{of what is}} <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>valuable</b> is {{undoubtedly}} a value. Enjoying suffering can be interpreted in various ways, and the moral intuition, {{that in some cases}} it is fundamentally evil despite the presence of ‘Enjoys’ or something similar to it, can be axiologically justified. Now though the general lessons drawn from the analyses of love and malicious pleasure entail the explanations of further axiologically disturbing cases, such as suffering at another person’s deserved enjoyment which is intuitively not a disvalue, despite the presence of suffering; and that of suffering at another person’s undeserved suffering which is intuitively a value, despite the presence of suffering, it will be useful to outline these explanations.|$|R
5000|$|A peppercorn is {{also used}} in more {{balanced}} contracts, where one side wishes to conceal {{the nature of their}} payment. For example, since real estate contracts are generally matters of public record, the purchaser of a house may not wish to list the exact amount of the payment on the contract. But there must be some specific payment listed in the contract, or the contract will be considered void for lack of consideration. So the contract may be written to reflect that the house is being sold in return for [...] "ten dollars <b>and</b> other <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>valuable</b> consideration". The ten dollars is the [...] "peppercorn" [...] that provides concrete consideration and ensures that the contract is valid, while the actual amount paid for the house is hidden and referred to only as the [...] "good <b>and</b> <b>valuable</b> consideration".|$|R
40|$|Polarity Theory {{suggests}} that worldview controversies spanning {{areas such as}} morality, politics, epistemology, and metaphysics are ultimately rooted in the clash between humanism, which portrays human nature as intrinsically <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>valuable,</b> <b>and</b> normativism, which portrays human goodness and value as contingent upon conformity and achievement. Previous {{research has shown that}} humanism and normativism are factorially distinct, rather than polar opposites, but has not clarified exactly how they differ. We report results from six samples of Swedish, U. S., and mixed nationality participants, suggesting that normativism is associated with an implicit metaphysics of essentialism and determinism, an absolutist epistemology, and moral intuitions, values, and aspirations pertaining to conformity with norms and the pursuit of excellence, whereas humanism is associated with an anthropocentric metaphysics, a subjectivist epistemology, and moral intuitions, values, and aspirations pertaining to intrinsic preferences and the pursuit of human well-being. The results demonstrate that humanism and normativism contribute independent of each other to the cohesion of personal worldviews, across the domains of metaphysics, epistemology, and conative orientation...|$|R
50|$|Later, in Turn Coat, {{he takes}} charge during the {{investigation}} of LaFortier's murder and refuses to help Harry, saying that a death is needed, {{even if it is}} the death of an innocent, <b>good,</b> <b>and</b> <b>valuable</b> man like Morgan. He tells Harry that his tribe was wiped out because he refused to break Council Law and become involved. As the Council members come from so many different nationalities, that there will always be Wizards on both sides of any issue. The Council frowns on political involvement, as it would tear them apart. It is possible that his less than ethical view of sacrificing Morgan could have been due to Peabody's influence. His regret for having to sentence Morgan to death knowing his innocence was certainly great.|$|R
5000|$|For instance, if A offers B $200 to buy B's mansion, luxury sports car, {{and private}} jet, {{there is still}} {{consideration}} on both sides. A's consideration is $200, and B's consideration is the mansion, car, and jet. Courts in the United States generally leave parties to their own contracts, and do not intervene. The old English rule of consideration questioned whether a party gave {{the value of a}} peppercorn to the other party. As a result, contracts in the United States have sometimes have had one party pass nominal amounts of consideration, typically citing $1. Thus, licensing contracts that do not involve any money at all often cite as consideration, [...] "for the sum of $1 <b>and</b> other <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>valuable</b> consideration." ...|$|R

40|$|In {{trying to}} assess the benefit of cardiac surgery in AIDS patients, the {{question}} arises whether a patient with a deficient immune system can tolerate open heart surgery well {{enough to make the}} operation worthwhile. Surgical procedures and cardiopulmonary bypass have been noted to alter immune function (Diettrich et al., Ide et al.). Therefore, the presence of clinical AIDS is often still regarded as a contraindication to cardiac surgery. In this report we describe an AIDS patient who developed endocarditis of the native aortic valve. The endocarditis was successfully treated with antibiotic drugs, but the patient was left with damaged valves. Over the months he developed a massive aortic insufficiency and underwent aortic valve replacement. The patient did well after surgery, and is alive and well 18 months after the operation, suggesting that cardiac surgery might be a <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>valuable</b> treatment option in AIDS patients...|$|R

This was his first school and he had taught {{students}} across Grades 8 to 10 and from various academic tracks. Kenny participated in the study for 2  years. In the first 18  months of study, the researchers noticed that Kenny had adopted mostly teacher-centered approaches. Similar to other teachers, he had feared that group work would result in too many discipline issues. In one of the conversations with Kenny, he revealed that he had never once asked his students for feedback about his teaching and lessons, or attempted to find out their needs. He had enacted his lessons based on what he thought was <b>good</b> <b>and</b> <b>valuable</b> for students to learn in science. This prompted us to gather feedback on how his students felt about Kenny’s science lessons.|$|R

In 1567 he {{proposed}} them in exchange for 120 000 talers the Głogow Privilege, who garantized the freedom from the homage of the subjects who declared him his heir. However, the idea wasn't accepted. On 24 December 1571 Henry XI tried to induce his subjects to pay off his debts, offering against their own <b>goods</b> <b>and</b> <b>valuables.</b> Also declared their devotion {{in return for a}} fixed salary, ensuring that corresponding to his position on the social level.

5000|$|The female tulku {{who was the}} abbess of Samding was {{traditionally}} a nirmanakaya emanation of Vajravārāhī. The lineage {{started in}} the 15th century with the princess of Gungthang, Chökyi Drönma ( [...] , 1422-1455). She became known as Samding Dorje Pagmo (...) and began a line of female tulkus, reincarnate lamas. She was a contemporary of the 1st Dalai Lama (1391-1474) and her teacher Bodong Panchen Chogley Namgyal also {{was one of his}} teachers. She manifested at Samding Monastery in order to tame Yamdrok Lake, a sacred lake as well as a dangerous flashpoint for massive flooding events in Tibet. However, her effects were more practical: as abbess of Samding, she stopped the invasion of the Dzungars, who were reportedly terrified of her great siddhi powers.

Also the part which the great serpent played therein, as it may be seen playing a part in every tomb upon the Nile, and indeed plays a part in our own and other religions.

Liberty's had taken several of his painted designs on various stuffs, and he could sell designs for embroideries, for altar-cloths, and similar things, in one or two places. It was not very much he made at present, but he might extend it. He had also made friends with the designer for a pottery firm, and was gaining some knowledge of his new acquaintance's art. The applied arts interested him very much. At the same time he laboured slowly at his pictures. He loved to paint large figures, full of light, but not merely made up of lights and cast shadows, like the impressionists; rather definite figures that had a certain luminous quality, like some of Michael Angelo's people. And these he fitted into a landscape, in what he thought true proportion. He worked a great deal from memory, using everybody he knew.
