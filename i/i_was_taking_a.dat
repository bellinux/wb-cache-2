[...] On Carey's official Facebook page on May 12, 2012, shortly after the release, she wrote, [...] "I spent four years writing this song, only because after I performed in Schenectady, NY, I started hearing this melody and singing {{it over and over}} to myself as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> bath, looking at the moon.. Four years later, as I was leaving a devastating part of my life behind, I wrote the second verse, the bridge and the outro." ...|$|E
500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of this day <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> walk with the steward of the convent in the neighbourhood, and as we returned, towards sunset, he begged me to take some refreshment {{with him in his}} cell. Scarcely had he entered the room, when, resuming our former subject of conversation, he said: [...] "And I, too, have read a Septuagint" [...] – i.e. a copy of the Greek translation made by the Seventy. And so saying, he took down from {{the corner of the room}} a bulky kind of volume, wrapped up in a red cloth, and laid it before me. I unrolled the cover, and discovered, to my great surprise, not only those very fragments which, fifteen years before, I had taken out of the basket, but also other parts of the Old Testament, the New Testament complete, and, in addition, the Epistle of Barnabas and a part of the Shepherd of Hermas.|$|E
500|$|At the 1963 {{convention}} of the newly formed East Coast Homophile Organizations, the audience heard a speaker named Dr. Albert Ellis tell them that [...] "the exclusive homosexual" [...] was a psychopath. Articles and essays in The Ladder sometimes carried these viewpoints, since {{it was difficult to}} get psychiatrists and doctors to address homosexuality in any form. Gittings said, [...] "People like Ellis talked about homosexuality being a sickness. And they talked about a cure...We'd sit there and listen and politely applaud and then go for the social hour afterward." [...] However, after Dr. Ellis spoke, so did gay activist Frank Kameny, making an impression upon Gittings with his point that it is useless to try to find cures and causes for homosexuality since there is no valid evidence that it is an illness. Said Gittings, [...] "My thinking didn't change until Frank Kameny came along and he said plainly and firmly and unequivocally that homosexuality is no kind of sickness or disease or disorder or malfunction, it is fully on par with heterosexuality...Suddenly I found that I was looking at things that had happened in the past in a very different light and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> position that was increasingly diverging from DOB’s positions." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "How d'ye do, aunt?" [...] was the Countess's salutation. [...] "I declare now, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> nap {{when your}} ladyship arrived! Hope you found your room fixed to your liking!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, didn't {{you notice}} it? No, you {{had gone to}} bed before it happened. But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> walk in the moonlight, on the balcony, and I {{observed}} it carefully." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will say}} goodby, sir. I hope you won't think <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> liberty in {{thinking}} {{you would be}} sorry if we were all to go without your knowing it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not till we have breakfast," [...] said Bastin. [...] "I {{will get}} out a pig. As a matter of fact, I had no supper last night, as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> class of native boys and making some {{arrangements}} of my own." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't think <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> liberty, Miss Longworth," [...] he said calmly.

6000|$|... "You {{saw them}} enter yesterday?" [...] said Hatton. [...] "I was sorry I missed it, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> walk with the Gerards up Dale {{to see the}} cottage where they once lived, and which they used to talk of so much! Was it a strong body?" ...|$|E
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> {{ride down}} Piccadilly {{the other day}} {{on top of a}} bus, I saw {{somebody}} walking along who seemed familiar. It was Mr. Carmyle.

6000|$|... "It can {{scarcely}} {{be called a}} wound, Marquis. I was carrying {{a message on the}} battle-field; when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> wall my horse was struck with a round shot.

6000|$|... "I think not, Mr. Ware. To {{tell you}} the truth, this is rather a p.p.c. visit.

6000|$|... "I believe I knew him. But {{his name}} is so common--there are so many {{thousands}} of 'James Browns' in England--that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> in fear of making a mistake.

60|$|The other winter, as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> morning {{walk down}} to the East River, I came upon a bit of our motley life, a fact of our piebald civilization, which has perplexed me from time to time, ever since, and which I wish now to leave with the reader, for his or her more {{thoughtful}} consideration.|$|E

60|$|The agent's report {{informed}} me {{that the person who}} had finally baffled his inquiries was an aged Catholic priest, long resident at Clovelly.

His eyes--they were dull grey eyes, and reddish under the rims--fell to my face, and his countenance immediately assumed an expression of corrugated amiability.|$|E

A quarter of an hour passed, half an hour, and then I saw Benjy coming through the trees. He stood before me, chuckling, and drew from his pocket a folded piece of paper.
