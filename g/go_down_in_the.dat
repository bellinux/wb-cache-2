5|$|Little {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} and most successful practitioners of market manipulation, making his fortune by leveraging both short sales and short sellers. In the former, he would sell stocks to other traders under contract to purchase it at a later date, betting that the market value would <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future and he could pocket the difference (trade rules have changed, and short selling is more complicated than this today). In the latter he would execute the opposite maneuver, corner a market by buying up all of the bonds of a particular company or sector, up-ticking the price so as to make a profit at the expense of any short sales based on those stocks. Hardworking, highly ambitious, and with his eyes set on the very top from the very beginning, Little commonly spent twelve hours a day working on such maneuvers in his office and a further six during the evening engaged in currency speculation.|$|E

2500|$|It {{may not be}} {{immediately}} obvious that the evaluation of [...] always terminates. However, the recursion is bounded because in each recursive application either m decreases, or m remains the same and n decreases. Each time that n reaches zero, m decreases, so m eventually reaches zero as well. (Expressed more technically, in each case the pair (m, n) decreases in the lexicographic order on pairs, which is a well-ordering, just like the ordering of single non-negative integers; this means one cannot <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ordering infinitely many times in succession.) However, when m decreases there is no upper bound on how much n can increase—and it will often increase greatly.|$|E

Of her return Westbrook said, 'I'm really excited to be going back to EastEnders". Executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins said: [...] "It is only right that all of Peggy Mitchell's children would be at her funeral. Danniella is the final piece of the Mitchell jigsaw puzzle, so it will be great for viewers to see Phil, Grant and Sam all back on screen.

[...] While appearing on an episode of Loose Women on 24 March 2016, Westbrook expressed interest in reprising the role of Sam on a full-time basis. Westbrook returned to filming on 3 May 2016. Letitia Dean who plays Sharon Watts revealed that there would be [...] "fireworks" [...] when Sam returns. Dean revealed: [...] "Sam coming back is a shock. It's obviously {{been a long time since}} anyone has seen her and she is trouble through and through. But Peggy is her mum, so of course she had to be there for the funeral". She went on to say: [...] "They do have a bit of a run-in with each other and Sharon is caught out which really panics her, especially that Sam has come back and seems to be unhappy that Sharon is so involved with the Mitchells." [...] Westbrook later expressed her disappointment with Sam only appearing in four episodes in an Instagram post. [...] "It's such a shame I won't be going back to the show as I think people would of [...] loved to see Sam as a mum and with a different take on the character… But I don't write the show I just do what they tell me," [...] Westbrook went on to say: [...] "And they've done what they always do use Sam when she's needed & then send her off in a black cab. I wish @bbceastenders would listen to the public more. But either way I'm grateful of the 4 episodes I got to film." [...] Her return scenes aired on 30 June with her final scenes aired on 8 July 2016.

On 11 May 2017, Westbrook claimed during an interview on Loose Women that she would be reprising her role as Sam later in the year, however an EastEnders source denied this, saying, [...] "There are no plans for Danniella to return, it's just not going to happen.

2500|$|After rain {{delayed the}} start until 3 o'clock Ken Mackay won the toss and batted {{regardless}} of the convention that rain livens up the pitch at Brisbane, but Fred Trueman had backache and Brian Statham was being rested and the MCC bowling attack lacked bite. David Larter sent the ball flying over the batsmen's heads, but he scatter the ball all over the place. Len Coldwell dug the ball in as well and had a good slower ball, but failed {{to get the ball}} to swing. Peter Parfitt removed Des Ball with a diving catch at 10/1, {{but the rest of the}} day saw la number of missed chances and Queensland reached 123/2 by the end of the day. Sam Trimble crawled to 95 in six hours, a dismal innings which Johnny Moyes thought [...] "lacked so much in batsmanship that it did not deserve to <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> records". Nevertheless, with Tom Veivers (36), Peter Burge (34) and Graham Bizzell (59) he took the score to 259/5. Even [...] "Slasher" [...] Mackay looked good after this and the dour Queenslander started driving the ball through the covers, adding 85 with Des Hughson (26) and 88 with wicket-keeper Wally Grout who hit a swashbuckling 56 with 2 sixes and 6 fours. Mackay made 105 not out, the first century for Queensland vs the MCC since 1950-51 and their 433/7 declared was their highest score against them since the war. Geoff Pullar had the flu and Colin Cowdrey was also resting, so Peter Parfitt opened with David Sheppard saw the tourists through to stumps then took their stand to 101 the next day. Queensland's overseas player was the West Indian fast bowler Wes Hall and earlier on the Monday one of his bouncers rose awkwardly and broke Grout's jaw, he was hurried to hospital and missed the First Test as a result. Hall (0/106) was overbowled on the now flat Woolloongabba wicket and Queensland's best bowler was the leg-spinner Colin Westaway (3/156), which pretty much sums up the innings as the MCC piled up 581/6. Peter Parfitt made a subdued 47 and David Sheppard was dropped on 51, 77 and 83 before Mackay bowled him for 94. Ted Dexter powered his way to 80 in 85 minutes with a 6 and 13 fours, adding 110 with Sheppard. The insatiable Ken Barrington amassed 183 not out with 22 boundaries, including some superb drives, pulls and cuts, adding 103 with Tom Graveney (52) and 180 with the all rounder Barry Knight, who hit 2 sixes and 11 fours in his 81. Alan Smith came in at 512/6, but when he reached 22 he ducked into a Wes Hall bouncer that stayed low and became the second wicket-keeping casualty of the match. The Duke of Norfolk and the team physiotherapist Sam Cowan helped him off the field and took him to hospital, where to everyone's relief x-rays found that he had not fractured his skull. Dexter declared for 581/6 and John Murray came on as a substitute keeper. Queensland only had to bat out the afternoon, but Mackay re-arranged the batting order and they promptly collapsed to Dexter's medium-paced swing (4/8) and the part-time leg-spin of Tom Graveney (2/2). Mackay came in for the penultimate ball with the score on at 94/7 and was missed in the slips. With Grout unable to bat had Mackay been out the MCC would have needed to take Westaway's wicket with the last ball of the match for a surprise win in an otherwise dull game.|$|E
