This combined cellular de- and repalmitoylation machinery {{has been shown}} to be substrate tolerant [...] it accepts variation of amino acid sequence, structure and configuration.

50|$|The <b>first</b> <b>limitation</b> of the Humphrey pump {{is that it}} has no suction capacity, in fact it must be {{installed}} in a dry sump several metres below the supply level. Given the pump's physical size and the need to protect the equipment against flood events, this is no small engineering exercise, requiring (in the Cobdogla example) several thousand tonnes of concrete. Also, it has a maximum lift of only around 10 metres. Its usual fuel, producer gas, contains very high levels of carbon monoxide, from which staff and visitors need to be protected in the event of accidental leakage. It is due to this concern that the Cobdogla demonstrations were halted.|$|E
50|$|Like {{all other}} types of signals, visual signals do have their downfalls and limitations. The <b>first</b> <b>limitation</b> one can see is the range and reliability. Within this limitation, visual {{communication}} can become greatly disrupted during periods of poor visibility or when the terrain restricts clear observation. The second limitation one can see is misunderstanding. Many units do not follow specific Army doctrine (FM), but rather adopt their own SOP's. With thousands of different units, it is highly likely that unit SOP's will begin to overlap and cross each other. The third limitation one can see is how vulnerable visual signals are to enemy interception; thus allowing the enemy to use our own signals for deception purposes.|$|E
40|$|Valiant {{showed that}} Boolean matrix {{multiplication}} (BMM) {{can be used}} for CFG parsing. We prove a dual result: CFG parsers running in time O(|G||w | 3 −ǫ) on a grammar G and a string w can be used to multiply m × m Boolean matrices in time O(m 3 −ǫ/ 3). In the process we also provide a formal definition of parsing motivated by an informal notion due to Lang. Our result establishes one of the <b>first</b> <b>limitations</b> on general CFG parsing: a fast, practical CFG parser would yield a fast, practical BMM algorithm, which is not believed to exist. ...|$|R
30|$|There {{are several}} {{limitations}} to our study. <b>First,</b> a <b>limitation</b> {{of this study}} is that it was conducted in a single center.

5000|$|Over the years, the U.S. Census has {{identified}} three major limitations {{to using the}} SIC system. The <b>first</b> <b>limitation</b> surrounds its definition and mistaken classification of employee groups. For example, administrative assistants in the automotive industry support {{all levels of the}} business, yet the SIC defines these employees as part of the [...] "Basic Sector" [...] of manufacturing jobs when they should be reported as [...] "Non-Basic." [...] Secondly, SIC codes were developed for traditional industries prior to 1970. Business has changed considerably since then from manufacturing-based to mostly service-based. As a result, and thirdly, the SIC has been slow to recognize new and emerging industries, such as those in the technology sector.|$|E
50|$|Farabee {{sponsored}} {{a constitutional amendment}} to allow garnishment of wages for child support. He secured passage of a bill allowing state agencies to maintain daycare facilities on the premises for the employees. He worked for modernization of juvenile justice policies to guarantee due process and the prevention of young persons from being housed in adult facilities. He attempted to prevent outside groups from dominating state textbook selection through the 15-member elected Texas State Board of Education. He opposed the state's blue laws and advocated industrial development and urban renewal. He sponsored legislation referring to HIV and AIDS cases. He supported the <b>first</b> <b>limitation</b> in Texas on medical malpractice. He worked to accelerate the time that a criminal case reaches the appeal stage.|$|E
5000|$|Are {{there any}} {{limits on the}} power to develop the common law? The <b>first</b> <b>limitation</b> is that, when the common law is developed, {{it must be done}} {{incrementally}} and on a case by case basis. The development cannot take place in the abstract; the court must apply the law as it is found to be in the case before it. This approach has also found favour when the Bill of Rights is directly applied to the common law. Indeed, it is even more important when the Bill of Rights is directly applied, because the consequences of a direct application differ from those of an indirect application. For example, in Shabalala v Attorney-General, Transvaal, the Constitutional Court was careful, after striking down a common-law rule, to balance the need to provide guidance with the danger of being prescriptive. Such care must also be taken when the Bill of Rights is indirectly applied. “Some guidance on the new approach has to be provided,” write Currie and De Waal, “while room must be left for the courts to develop the principle on a case by case basis.” ...|$|E
50|$|C. J. Bucher AG {{was taken}} over by the Ringier {{printing}} company in 1973. The new owners saw no interest in Camera, yet instead of ending the publication altogether, Ringier thought that by withdrawing all but a minimum promotional support, readership interest would dwindle and the magazine would find a natural end on its own. One of the <b>first</b> <b>limitations</b> Ringier would impose was a switch to the faster and cheaper lithographic offset printing system rather than the slower and more expensive sheet-fed gravure technology used until then. Porter, having reservations about how Cameras readership would react to the drop in printing quality, with the help of technicians from the still-functioning gravure department, managed to develop a two-colour duplex offset system that would at the same time cut costs and maintain quality.|$|R

30|$|However, <b>first</b> {{apparent}} <b>limitation</b> of the conductance catheter based methodology {{is due to}} {{the random}} finite resistance of a heart’s muscle, which causes dynamic fluctuations and the current leakage through the heart walls [14 – 16]. Second drawback of this volumetric method is its relativity, thus the need for the calibration methodology [15, 17].|$|R
30|$|The <b>first</b> <b>limitation</b> is the {{relationship}} between the nurse and patient. The nurse identified the patients with pain; therefore, we cannot rule out the question of empathy in this relationship, which is completely subjective.|$|E
30|$|Though the <b>first</b> <b>limitation</b> {{may become}} broken with {{hypersphere}} replaced by hyper-ellipse, not only it largely increases {{the number of}} free parameters and thus becomes prone to overfitting but also some subset in Eq. (2) may still not be convex. Favourably, Choice (b) gets a small incremental in free parameters, i.e., simply with the scalar a replaced by a vector a, such that the second limitation is overcome and the <b>first</b> <b>limitation</b> is at least partially overcome. Specifically, D_gϕ e is partitioned into at least two convex subsets and at most four convex subsets by two hyper-planes, and the resulted subsets may also have some orientation. Again, we may estimate the two hyper-planes by minimising the criterion given by Eqs. (1) or (4).|$|E

30|$|There {{are a few}} {{limitations}} in using Python for complex systems education. The <b>first</b> <b>limitation</b> is that the software installation and maintenance {{is a little more}} difficult than other more sophisticated software environment.c We believe, though, that the long-term educational benefit from learning a general-purpose programming language will outweigh the short-term learning difficulty for the majority of students.|$|E
30|$|The <b>first</b> <b>limitation</b> of {{this review}} was the {{availability}} {{of only a few}} prospective comparable studies. The majority of the included studies were retrospective cohort studies and case series. The conclusions that can be drawn from these studies are limited by the lack of adequate control groups, and post-treatment complications are likely to be underestimated due to the retrospective design. In addition, the methodological quality of all the included studies was generally of moderate quality.|$|E
30|$|The <b>first</b> <b>limitation</b> of {{this study}} was lack of funds. Due to lack of funding, it was {{difficult}} to administer questionnaires to a very large sample. This makes us to limits our observations only to 120 (120 observations). This is however small when comparing or looking at similar studies of Zwick (2003) whose observation was based on 1400 sample. Equally, Access to information wasn’t that easy. Self-report measures my equally portray potential personal bias.|$|E

40|$|Today sonsory {{evaluations}} will {{be taken}} as criteria for shelf-life estimations of canned food. Product specific quality changes {{have to be considered}} <b>first.</b> <b>Limitations</b> of the shelf-life by interaction with package material depend on several factors as food sensitivities and package specific properties. Concerning metal cans the extend of interactions has been reducted to a low level by the progress in can manufacturing. The package specific shelf-life of inside protected welded cans can be evaluated. The importance of the bottom/seam porosity (BSP) as a can quality parameter and the influencing factors are outlined with reference to the results of medium and long term storage tests. Special emphasis is given to the use of electrochemical impedance spectrometry (EIS) for testing. An AC/DC combination method for rapid quality assessments of metal/lacquer interfaces is proposed. EIS is able to give information about corrosion mechanisms, product compatibility and stresses during steriliz ation processes...|$|R
30|$|The <b>first</b> <b>limitation</b> of {{our study}} was the shorter {{follow-up}} time compared to previous reports and longer follow-up should be performed to detect late relapsing [5, 19, 20, 21, 23, 28]. However, compared to extensive posteromedial release, revision surgery was already performed 10  years after surgery [19, 20, 39]. Furthermore, the present study shows a low rate of revision surgery compared to the literature, where rates ranged between 21 and 87  % [8, 19, 25, 38].|$|E
30|$|This job {{also will}} support the {{existing}} literature on {{the economic impact of}} copyright by analysing this issue in the Italian setting. To the best of our knowledge, only a handful of studies have explored the economic impact of copyright industries in Italy. However, this study suffers from many limitations. The <b>first</b> <b>limitation</b> {{lies in the fact that}} the analysis has been confined to 1  year only. Second, the study suffers from the inherent limitations of the WIPO and French methods.|$|E
30|$|Yet, some {{limitations}} {{of our study}} need to be discussed. The <b>first</b> <b>limitation</b> refers to the cross-sectional character of our analysis. Accordingly, reversed causality cannot be excluded. Examining health outcomes with cross-sectional data, researchers always have to challenge causality in observed associations. Selection bias is a common problem of population-based studies. With employed populations under observation, like in the lidA study, health related selection out of the labour market is most prominent. However, we aimed to describe the situation of those currently employed.|$|E

30|$|<b>First,</b> a <b>limitation</b> of {{the current}} study is the sample size. The current {{findings}} therefore prevent the generalisation of findings beyond the specific context in which this study was conducted.
