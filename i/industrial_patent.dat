Field tests of the principles were also published [...] and filed under an <b>industrial</b> <b>patent</b> [...] based on the twisted parabola. As a means to increase capacity and frequency reuse orbital angular momentum multiplexing was also compared to traditional MIMO spatial multiplexing techniques in terms of antenna size/spacing/occupation and achievable performance, {{which resulted in a}} critical assessment showing that both have equal performances. Near field properties of OAM beams at microwaves have also been investigated resulting in valid theoretical and practical demonstrations to lay the ground for short-range secure communications with application to contactless payments and transactions, filed under a dedicated patent.|$|E

40|$|A {{new tool}} for {{discovering}} and visualizing interactions between scientific publication domains and <b>industrial</b> <b>patent</b> domains is introduced. The tool {{is applied to}} a database of the United States patent data (USPTO) from 1980 till 1995 and the Science Citation Index (SCI) bibliographic databases. The core algorithm behind our tool is the kernel-based Maximum Entropy Rule (kMER), a learning scheme for developing topographic maps of formal neurons. The Gaussian kernels that correspond to each neuron are used for constructing a density map on which a hillclimbing algorithm is applied for locating and visualizing clusters in the topographic map. For each set of clustered data, a new topographic map is developed, and so on. A new method is introduced in order to visualize this hierarchical structure into a single condensed cluster map. The procedure is applied to patent and bibliographic data separately {{in order to build}} two hierarchical structures: one containing clusters of technology classes and the other clusters of science classes. The two data structures are then merged into a single (pseudo-) colored linkage map, colored by the co-occurrences of patents and the scientific publications referred in them. Various zooming facilities are available for visual inspection. After the linkage map for a particular time period is developed, data from other consecutive time periods can be projected onto the map in order to monitor the evolution of the interactions. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{protection}} {{of intellectual property}} is an old and very important right.

40|$|All {{remaining}} {{errors are}} my own. Innovation and technological advance {{depend on the}} accumulation and diffusion of research knowledge. Firm R&D often depends on access to and utilization of knowledge that originates outside the boundaries firm, and a firm’s ability to access and exploit this knowledge {{is affected by the}} prevailing intellectual property environment. Universities, traditionally a source of ba-sic science and technological innovation available to industrial researchers, have increasingly patented research results produced by academic researchers. Increased patenting by universities may limit or slow the dissemination and exploitation of patented and non-patented university research results. In this paper, I examine the relationship between the change in university patenting and changes in firm citation of public science, as well as changes in the pace of knowl-edge exploitation by firms, measured using changes in the distribution of backward citation lags in <b>industrial</b> <b>patents.</b> Results suggest that increasing university patenting is associated with a slowing pace of knowledge exploitation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the role}} that patents played {{in the establishment of}} the isotope industry. In the first part I survey the number of issued patents on the production of isotopes, also arguing that the isotope industry was typified by inadequate patenting activities. Then I examine the factors that hindered these activities by looking at the history of <b>industrial</b> <b>patents</b> in the establishment of the isotope industry. I especially focus on the consequences of the Manhattan Project on patent legislation. As the Atomic Energy Act (1946) made the isotope industry a monopoly of the US Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), it contributed to transform the trading of its relevant patents in a «contentious» business. Since then, inventors and assignors already in possession of isotope production patents could only claim compensation to the AEC, which was authorised to seize them. And those who might have outlined new inventions were now deprived of the economic incentive to do so, being prohibited from free-trading them in the international market...|$|R

40|$|Innovation is {{critical}} to sustain in prevailing competitive business environments. Industries need effective innovation strategies in-practice to develop and deliver novel products and services swiftly. In order to implement innovation strategies effectively, industries need innovation capacity in engineering design supported with intellectual assets. However, there are many issues that prevent streamlining these processes. The objectives of this research are to explicit the issues related to <b>industrial</b> <b>patents</b> (one of the important resources in intellectual assets) generation and management processes, and propose cost-effective crowdsourcing approach {{as a tool for}} patent landscaping activities. Interviews with patent attorneys and intellectual audit specialists reveal that most industries have ineffective intellectual property strategy; engineers do little patent searching, face challenges to identify novel product features, and often find difficulties to interpret patent information. The initial experiments of using the crowdsourcing approach for patent clustering activity reveal that general crowd workers (not knowing much about patents) were able to identify one third of expert clustered schema for much lesser cost. Further research work to strengthen the usefulness of the crowdsourcing approach for patent landscaping related activities is discussed...|$|R

50|$|Over {{the next}} century, the {{granting}} of full <b>industrial</b> <b>patents</b> became a more common practice in England; the next record is a letter from 1537 to Thomas Cromwell, Henry VIII's private secretary, from Antonio Guidotti, a Venetian silk-merchant. Guidotti had persuaded a group of Venetian silk-makers to practice in England, and wanted the king to grant him letters patent protecting their monopoly to grow silk for 15 or 20 years. This was granted, and Henry's son Edward VI followed up with a grant of letters patent to Henry Smyth, who hoped to introduce foreign glassworking techniques into England. This process continued after Elizabeth I came to the throne, with formal procedures set out in 1561 to issue letters patent to any new industry, allowing monopolies. The granting of these patents was highly popular with the monarch, {{both before and after}} the statute of Monopolies, because of the potential for raising revenue. A patentee was expected to pay heavily for the patent, and unlike a tax raise (another method of raising Crown money) any public unrest as a result of the patent was normally directed at the patentee, not the monarch.|$|R

This industry finds {{itself on the}} interface between the food and pharmaceutical industry and is still a relatively unknown industry. At present, insights concerning industry development and patenting in the European medical nutrition industry are limited. This research presents a systematic patent portfolio analysis of the <b>industrial</b> <b>patenting</b> trends and patenting strategy categorization of the 5 leading companies. Focusing on EU patent applications, we calculated company specific patent-, product- and market shares and average forward- and backward-citations. These indicators were combined to illustrate the European medical nutrition industry trends and company specific patent- and innovation-strategies. We found 222 European medical nutrition patent applications between 1990 and 2010. The analysis of the industry trends shows that the industry currently resides in the growth phase and is estimated to reach the stage of maturation within 2 years with approximately 400 patents. Predominantly neurological diseases, cancer and diabetes show opportunity for future MN innovations while gastrointestinal and infection related diseases may have already reached a market saturation stage. Three distinct patent strategies can be distinguished within this industry: the Prospector; the Analyzer; and the Reactor. ?? 2013 Elsevier B. V...|$|R
5000|$|Historically, English {{patent law}} {{was based on}} custom and the common law, not on statute. It began as the Crown granted patents {{as a form of}} {{economic}} protection to ensure high industrial production. As gifts from the crown, there was no judicial review, oversight or consideration, and no actual law developed around patents. This practice came from the guilds, groups who were controlled by the Crown and held monopolies over particular industries. By the 14th century the economy of England was lagging behind that of other European nations, with the guilds too small to control industrial production successfully. To remedy this, Edward II began encouraging foreign workmen and inventors to settle in England, offering [...] "letters of protection" [...] that protected them from guild policy on the condition that they train English apprentices and pass on their knowledge. The first recorded letter of protection was given in 1331. The letters did not grant a full monopoly; rather they acted as an extended passport, allowing foreign workers to travel to England and practice their trade. An exceptional example (considered the first full patent in England) was issued to John of Utynam on 3 April 1449, granting him a monopoly. Overseas, the practice of granting full <b>industrial</b> <b>patents</b> and monopolies became common in Italian states by the 1420s.|$|R
