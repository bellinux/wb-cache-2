5|$|Beyond Two Rivers, {{the trail}} reaches the Chena River {{northwest}} of Fairbanks. This {{is the final}} stretch, and mushers use the river to enter Fairbanks and reach the <b>finish</b> <b>line,</b> {{which is on the}} river itself in the middle of downtown Fairbanks. Regardless of the timing of the finish, several thousand spectators typically gather to watch the first musher cross the <b>finish</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first cyclist {{to cross}} the <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> {{received}} 1 point. Other cyclists received one point more than the cyclist who passed the line directly before him, plus an additional point for every five minutes between them, with a maximum of ten points. In this way, a cyclist could not get more than 11 points more than the cyclist that crossed the <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> just before him.|$|E

5|$|In this {{championship}} {{version of}} the game, a <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> is set up farther downstream {{and the winner is}} the first to pass this point. The competition originally took place every January, but it was moved to March due to icy weather in 1997.|$|E

5|$|The {{finish of}} a race {{is marked by a}} white line 5cm wide. The {{finishing}} position of athletes is determined by the order in which any part of their torso (as distinguished from the head, neck, arms, legs, hands or feet) reaches the vertical plane of the nearer edge of the <b>finish</b> <b>line.</b> Fully automatic timing systems (photo timing) {{are becoming more and more}} common at increasingly lower levels of track meets, improving the accuracy, while eliminating the need for eagle-eyed officials on the <b>finish</b> <b>line.</b> Fully automatic timing (FAT) is required for high level meets and any time a (sprint) record is set (though distance records can be accepted if timed by three independent stopwatches).|$|E
5|$|The season 6 {{finale of}} CBS's reality show The Amazing Race ended in Ping Tom Memorial Park.

5|$|A {{quartet of}} riders made the climb in second {{position}} on the road behind Pellizotti: race leader Denis Menchov, Danilo Di Luca, Ivan Basso, and Stefano Garzelli. Di Luca rode with a very high cadence {{in an attempt to}} separate himself from Menchov, but was unable to until the sprint for the <b>finish</b> <b>line.</b> By virtue of the time bonuses gained for third place as well as the gap on the road, Di Luca closed his deficit to Menchov to under 30 seconds.|$|E

Alternatively, players may decide upon a starting point on a river and a <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> farther downstream. The winner is the player whose stick first passes the finishing point.|$|E
5|$|At the Los Angeles International Speedway, McQueen's mind is {{not fully}} set on the race, and he soon falls into last place. He is {{surprised}} to discover that Doc Hudson, who is decked out in his old racing colors, has taken over as his crew chief, along with several other friends from Radiator Springs to help in the pit. Inspired and recalling tricks he learned from Doc and his friends, McQueen quickly emerges to lead the race into the final laps. But at the last minute, Hicks, refusing to come behind Weathers again, side swipes Weathers, and sends him into a dangerous spin, causing him to crash. Seeing this and recalling Doc's fate, McQueen stops just short of the <b>finish</b> <b>line,</b> allowing Hicks to win, and drives back to push Weathers over the <b>finish</b> <b>line.</b> The crowd and media condemn Hicks' victory, but are nonetheless impressed with McQueen's sportsmanship. Though offered the Dinoco sponsorship deal, McQueen declines, insisting on staying with Rusteze as an appreciation of their past support. Later, back at Radiator Springs, McQueen returns and announces that he will be setting up his headquarters there, helping to put Radiator Springs back on the map.|$|E

5|$|At {{the third}} barrel, Scamper spit the {{bit out of}} his mouth, causing the bridle to drop to his chest, but he kept running full speed ahead. While running down the home stretch after the third barrel, James had nothing but a single rein around Scamper's neck with which to control him. Despite these occurrences, the pair crossed the <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> {{with a time of}} 14.4 seconds to win both the round and the 1985 World Barrel Racing Championship.|$|E
5|$|Duque took a high placing at the Gran Premio dell'Insubria-Lugano, {{finishing}} {{just off}} the podium in fourth place, coming home in a group that trailed two leading riders. At Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne, a race which included most of the sport's top teams, Petit finished ninth in a field sprint finish {{at the front of}} the race. Ista narrowly missed out on a victory at Le Samyn in early March. The race's top finishers came across the <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> scattered, in groups of eight or fewer. Ista finished second, alone, 8 seconds back of solo winner Dominic Klemme. Two weeks later, Keukeilere finished fourth in a sprint at Nokere Koerse. Gallopin finished on the podium at Cholet-Pays de Loire. 's Thomas Voeckler won the race with a late attack, with the peloton coming so close to catching him at the <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> that there was no time gap. Gallopin was first from the peloton for second overall. Vogondy rode to fourth place at the Route Adélie de Vitré, just missing the podium after figuring into a winning breakaway.|$|E
5|$|Menchov was fifth after Alpe di Siusi, but rose {{to second}} before stage 12, the {{very long and}} hilly {{individual}} time trial in Cinque Terre. There, he claimed a convincing victory; only Levi Leipheimer finished within a minute of Menchov's winning time. Di Luca was nearly two minutes slower than him, finished sixth on the stage, and fell to second overall, with Menchov assuming the race lead. Di Luca tried repeatedly to shed Menchov during the remaining mountain stages {{to make up the}} time difference, which was never more than a minute. The two riders were involved in sprints for time bonuses at the <b>finish</b> <b>line</b> in stages 16 and 17, as well as an intermediate sprint in stage 20. Menchov was consistently quicker than Di Luca in these sprints. With his superior time-trial skills providing the difference in the final stage, the Russian was able to emerge as Giro champion, despite a dramatic fall in the final kilometre before the <b>finish</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
