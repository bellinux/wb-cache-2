5|$|There is also {{a fallen}} {{standing}} stone known as the Broad Stone which measures 2 metres (6.6 <b>feet)</b> <b>in</b> length and which lies beside the road about 1.5kilometres (0.9 miles) {{to the west of}} the Nine Stones. As it was recorded in the 19th century it measured 3 metres (10 <b>feet)</b> <b>in</b> length, 2 metres (6 and a half <b>feet)</b> <b>in</b> breadth, and 0.6 metres (2 <b>feet)</b> <b>in</b> thickness. The monument was protected from passing cars by several bollards which were later removed by the highways authority, prompting statements of concern that the stone was unprotected in 2008.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, {{physical}} evidence of lion cages was found, one being 3x3 meters (6.5x10 <b>feet)</b> <b>in</b> size, very small for a lion that can grow to be 2.5 meters (approximately 8 feet) long.|$|E

5|$|In January 2013, {{construction}} {{added another}} 368 {{seats in the}} north endzone and two observation decks. The $11million project also includes a significantly upgraded jumbotron with a new sound system, a Spanish Renaissance-themed colonnade, and a north end zone concourse that connects the two stadium halves. Along with the other additions, 157feet of ribbon board will be added on the north end zone, more than 160 linear <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> the northeast and northwest corners of the stadium, and 94 lineal <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> the south end zone over the athletic offices. The construction was completed during the 2013 season. The stadium's capacity is 60,862, making it the third-largest on-campus stadium in Texas.|$|E
5|$|Males {{mark their}} territories with dung piles and by urine spraying. Scrapes {{made by the}} <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> the ground and twisted saplings also seem {{to be used for}} communication. Members of other rhino species have a {{peculiar}} habit of defecating in massive rhino dung piles and then scraping their back <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> the dung. The Sumatran and Javan rhinos, while defecating in piles, do not engage in the scraping. This adaptation in behavior is thought to be ecological; in the wet forests of Java and Sumatra, the method may not be useful for spreading odors.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} these circles {{were built in the}} area around modern Dorset, {{typically}} being constructed from sarsen stone and being smaller than those found elsewhere. The Kingston Russell ring is the largest of those in Dorset, measuring 24 by 27 metres (79 feet by 89 <b>feet)</b> <b>in</b> diameter and containing eighteen sarsen stones arranged in an oval shape. The site has not been excavated or been subject to in-depth archaeological investigation.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{beginning}} of the ice age 4.5 million years ago, baleen whales did not exceed 10 meters (33 <b>feet)</b> <b>in</b> length. But when the ice sheets caused their food sources to concentrate in certain areas at certain times of years, they began to increase in size while smaller species became more rare.|$|E
5|$|Forster was, however, criticised in {{the early}} part of his time at Celtic for lacking {{confidence}} and command, and uncertain when he had the ball at his <b>feet.</b> <b>In</b> time he matured, with his confidence and kicking noticeably improved. His level of concentration was also noted; given Celtic's dominance over the majority of their opponents in Scotland, their goalkeeper often has long periods of inactivity, but when eventually called into action Forster was invariably alert and ready.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} {{underwater}} scene, {{most of which}} was shot at the water tank at Universal, Lawless had to be seat-belted into a car {{that was supposed to}} be submerged thirteen <b>feet.</b> <b>In</b> actuality, the water tank was four feet deep. Lawless, being six feet tall, had to kneel and breathe into a hookah while filming the scene. For the special effects team, one of the hardest parts of the episode was to hide the fact that Lawless was wearing a swimming suit.|$|E
50|$|Pannell scored 16 {{points in}} the first two games of his senior season, but he broke his left <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> the second game against Army.

5|$|Karlheinz Stockhausen {{employed}} {{noise in}} vocal compositions, such as Momente (1962–64/69), {{in which the}} four choirs clap their hands, talk, and shuffle their <b>feet,</b> <b>in</b> order to mediate between instrumental and vocal sounds {{as well as to}} incorporate sounds normally made by audiences into those produced by the performers.|$|E
5|$|Other risks {{associated}} with the crinoline were that it could get caught in other people's feet, carriage wheels or furniture, or be caught by sudden gusts of wind, blowing the wearer off their <b>feet.</b> <b>In</b> 1859, while participating in a paper chase, Louisa, Duchess of Manchester, caught her hoop while climbing over a stile, and was left with the entirety of her crinoline and skirts thrown over her head, revealing her scarlet drawers to the assembled company.|$|E
5|$|Skydiving and {{entering}} the Guinness Book of Records were two goals which Sutton achieved before his death.
