40|$|Duke University {{is seeking}} to {{decrease}} greenhouse gas emissions from its <b>employee</b> <b>commuters.</b> I build a linear optimization model to predict Duke University and Medical Center employee commute mode share. Combining these results with a forecast of Duke employee growth, I calculate the impact on <b>employee</b> <b>commuter</b> greenhouse gas emissions of 1) existing Duke carpooling and bus subsidies, 2) a $ 10 per month increase in employee parking costs and 3) a $ 20 per month increase in employee parking costs. The cost-effectiveness of these measures in 2015 to Duke University is $ 309. 96 per mtCO 2 e for existing policy, -$ 248. 87 per mtCO 2 e for a $ 10 per month increase in parking costs and -$ 516. 21 per mtCO 2 e for a $ 20 per month increase in parking costs. Including costs to commuters, the cost-effectiveness of these policies to {{society as a whole}} is $ 57. 41, $ 84. 18, and $ 399. 82 per mtCO 2 e. From the perspective of Duke University, excluding costs to <b>employee</b> <b>commuters,</b> the existing policy scenario is the least cost-effective strategy for achieving greenhouse gas emissions reductions from <b>employee</b> <b>commuters.</b> The parking cost increases are the least cost-effective when costs to <b>employee</b> <b>commuters</b> are included. From this combined perspective, the existing policy scenario is the most cost-effective policy...|$|R

40|$|One {{potential}} {{solution to}} reducing peak hour congestion {{has been to}} identify a role for the employer in reducing car-based travel to work and promoting more sustainable alternatives through comprehensive 'employee travel plans' (Rye, T., 1995. Employee Transport Plans [...] An Easy Means to Cut Congestion? The 23 rd European Transport Forum, Proceedings of Seminar B, Planning for Sustainability, PTRC, pp. 229 - 241). In the UK such plans have seen a steady increase in interest since the early 1990 s culminating in their recognition in the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions DETR, 1998 (DETR, 1998. A New Deal for Transport: Better for Everyone, The Government's White Paper on the Future of Transport, HMSO, London) Transport White Paper as a policy tool for reducing car-based travel. Despite their inclusion as a policy tool little information exists on the views of employers towards such plans (Rye, T., 1995. Employee Transport Plans [...] An Easy Means to Cut Congestion? The 23 rd European Transport Forum, Proceedings of Seminar B, Planning for Sustainability, PTRC, pp. 229 - 241; Rye, T., MacLeod, M., 1998. An Investigation of Employer Attitudes to Employer Transport Plans, AET European Transport Conference 1998, Policy Planning and Sustainability Seminar (Seminar C), vol. 2, PTRC). This is of considerable concern given that employers by default are the key implementers. Studies to date on employers' attitudes have concentrated on {{the views of the}} large employer (over 100 employees). The Transport White Paper however suggests that there is also a role for the small employer. This paper therefore investigates the attitudes and policy of the small employer (under 100 employees) towards staff travel and green <b>commuter</b> <b>plans.</b> The paper is based on the analysis of data collected in 1998 from 352 small Oxfordshire employers. The research was funded under the DETR's Seedcorn Research Programme. The paper outlines selected findings of this research, and concludes by suggesting that while ultimately there should be a role for the small employer in developing green <b>commuter</b> <b>plans</b> it is the large firms that are more likely to implement green <b>commuter</b> <b>plans</b> in the short term. In policy terms, the continuing focus of green <b>commuter</b> <b>plans</b> on large employers is therefore the best way forward. In the long term however consideration needs to be given to the role that the small employer can play in reducing employee travel. ...|$|R

30|$|Using this {{scenario}} modeling approach, {{the number of}} commuters was estimated using four assumptions. First, because the available ridership data only provides {{the total number of}} commuters exiting a station, an assumption was needed about the portion of commuters who are municipal employees. An assumption, PropCityEmp, was devised to represent the proportion of municipal <b>employees</b> among the <b>commuters</b> who currently disembark from the central city subway stations. Second, some of the municipal employees can be expected to relocate their homes to Tongzhou after the move of their workplace. Another assumption, PropCommute was devised to represent the proportion of municipal employees who will commute from their current residence to Tongzhou after the municipal office relocation. Third, since there are two subway lines connecting Tongzhou, an assumption, PropBaton, was devised to represent the proportion of municipal <b>employee</b> <b>commuters</b> who will use the Sihui East station on the Batong line to get to their jobs in Tongzhou, with the remainder expected to use the Jintai station on Line 6. Potentially, all the proportions associated with these three assumptions could vary from 0 % to 100 %. In addition, a fourth assumption was necessary to estimate additional housing demand in Tongzhou. A “Job-Home Ratio” assumption was devised to represent the number of municipal employees per household. For example, a ratio of 1.5 is assumed for this analysis, meaning that for every three municipal employees relocating to Tongzhou, two housing additional housing units will be needed.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{energy efficiency}} in the EU, {{both in terms}} of reductions in energy intensity and in terms of physical indicators, looking at the differences among sectors and among Member States. We test econometrically the existence of convergence in energy intensity across Europe. We find a sensible catching–up of less performing countries, particularly in the agricultural and in the industrial sectors. Against this background, we analyse the role played by energy policies in EU Member States and we identify the most effective classes of policies and measures by means of a panel analysis of the EU- 15 and Norway. It turns out that, in the residential sector, energy efficiency is particularly affected by heating regulations, by subsidies as well as tax reductions; in the transport sector, effective policies are tax reductions, incentives to eliminate old and polluting cars, car sharing, <b>commuter</b> <b>plan</b> and traffic management; in the industrial sector, mandatory technology standards, financing at low interest rate, information activities, education and outreach proved to be effective. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{documents}} the current efforts of transportation planning and air quality policies to reduce traffic congestion in metropolitan Phoenix. In metropolitan Arizona, {{the weakness of}} adopted land use controls, preference for single occupant commuting, {{and the importance of}} regional water and air quality issues guide transportation planning. Adopted transportation and employee trip reduction measures include a 1985 metropolitan Phoenix referendum approving a one-half cent sales tax for construction of a 231 -mile freeway addition and preparation of a metropolitan rapid transit plan, defeated on March 28, 1989. The 1988 Arizona Legislature Omnibus Air Quality bill mandates <b>employee</b> <b>commuter</b> distance and mode baseline studies yearly, completed employer trip reduction plans and a reduction of five percent of the average vehicle miles traveled in each of the next two years. A pre-test survey documents potential problems with the current analysis approach. The employee baseline survey relies on stated or perceived distance which may not accurately measure average vehicle miles traveled. Analysis of a survey of 400 Arizona State University students compared their stated commuting distance with the actual distance as measured by straight-line and grid measurements. Both technical problems and the lack of broad-based support for alternatives to single occupant commuting suggest that current metropolitan Phoenix planning efforts to reduce traffic congestion by regulating employee travel will be part of a long-term learning process...|$|R
