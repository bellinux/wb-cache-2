Wells, Fargo & Co. undercover agent Fred Dodge, riding with the Cowboys, wrote that Barnes <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that he <b>had</b> shot Virgil Earp.

Then he had lied. His uncle <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> of his {{intention}} before the will was executed, and <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> again, when the Cantors had gone, that the thing was done. The old man had expressed a thousand regrets, but the young one had remained impassive, sullen, crushed with a feeling of the injury done to him, but still silent. He had not dared to remonstrate, and had found himself unable to complain of the injustice.|$|R

25|$|As lead guitarist, Frehley {{was known}} for his frenetic, {{atmospheric}} playing, becoming {{one of the most popular}} guitarists in the 1970s and spawning a generation of new players. Frehley stated in the book Kiss: Behind the Mask that many guitarists <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> his playing on 1975's hit Alive! prompted them to pick up the instrument. Frehley is well-recognized for using Gibson Les Paul guitars, including his trademarked model conversion Les Paul Custom (that he modified himself), which filled the stage full of smoke during his live guitar solo.|$|E

25|$|The next day, Eddie and Carol talk but he {{defends his}} son {{when she says}} she thinks Michael has a mean streak. He gives Kat some money for Tommy before leaving but does not go far and bonds with Carol's grandson, Liam Butcher (James Forde). Kat finds Eddie and invites him to stay. They visit Michael's boxing club where he tells Michael that he should <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> Tommy is his grandson. Michael, however, gives Eddie money and tells him to take his family far away. Eddie asks {{what it will take}} for him to get over what happened, and later tells Michael's girlfriend Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) that he does not {{remember}} why they fell out. Roxy and Eddie bond and Michael is annoyed. Michael repeatedly tells Eddie to stay away from him, Tommy and Roxy but Kat tells him he can stay {{for as long as he}} wants. Michael tells Roxy that Eddie murdered his mother, Maggie. Eddie confirms this but says he was not there when she died but left Michael with her (he was then 6 years old), knowing he shouldn't. She died of an overdose and Michael blames him. He later helps Carol fix a blocked sink at the café and she invites him for tea after he bonds further with Liam. Liam skips school and Eddie helps him with a hobby. Carol is annoyed that Liam did not go to school but thanks Eddie for spending time with Liam by kissing him. Eddie's son, Tyler (Tony Discipline), arrives in Walford and makes Eddie miss meeting Michael to try to make amends. Michael refuses to accept Eddie's apology.|$|E
500|$|Herod is [...] "troubled", {{not because}} of the {{appearance}} of the star, but because the Magi <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that a [...] "king of the Jews" [...] had been born, which he understands to refer to the Messiah, a leader of the Jewish people whose coming was believed to be foretold in scripture. So he asks his advisors where the Messiah would be born. They answer Bethlehem, birthplace of King David, and quote the prophet Micah. The king passes this information along to the Magi.|$|E
500|$|Hudner {{said he was}} {{occasionally}} {{criticized for}} his actions, and [...] "about 90" [...] people <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> he acted recklessly. His commanders noted his actions may have endangered the helicopter pilot and sacrificed an aircraft, criticisms Hudner later said did not make him regret his decision, as {{he felt it was}} a spur of the moment action. Still, commanders later issued orders forbidding pilots from crash-landing in a similar way to try to save downed wingmen. On later reflection, Hudner indicated he did not consider himself a hero for his actions.|$|E

500|$|Some reports however {{indicate}} that the legend was not seriously accepted: Carlyle suggests one near-eyewitness French account amounted to [...] "not a recantation of an impudent amazing falsehood, but to some vague faint murmur or whimper of admission {{that it is probably}} false". Captain Diaz de Soria relates the story, probably apocryphal, that in 1840, the Prince of Joinville, while decorating the purported last survivor of Vengeur, would <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> [...] "we do this for the legend, my good man: nations, after all, live only of legends". In 1857, Guérin wrote [...] "one wonders how, after that, history could remain so credulous".|$|E
500|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I Stuart was called up to service, as {{an officer in the}} Royal Naval Reserve. He was originally posted as a junior officer on board the old and obsolete destroyer HMS Opossum in Plymouth. This ship was used for harbour patrols and intercepting neutral merchant ships and other work Stuart considered tedious. He became increasingly impatient with the life and repeatedly applied to his senior officers with requests for transfer; at one point he even requested that he be commissioned into the army. All of these were turned down, with increasing levels of hostility from his commanders, one of whom was reported to <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> to [...] "Go to hell! And shut the door behind you!" ...|$|E
500|$|When Ward {{decided to}} try out for the {{football}} team as a sophomore, Michigan track fans worried that Ward would be injured. The Associated Press reported: “University of Michigan track fans do a lot of worrying these days because a Negro boy from Detroit insists on playing football. Willis Ward, they believe, will be the greatest track man ever to compete for the Maize and Blue—if he doesn’t get hurt. [...] … Ward is a good football player and loves the game[...] [...] [...] Well wishers even <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> about the advantages of competing only in track and staying away from the gridiron, but he is determined to play on the eleven, and he is good enough to make the grade.” [...] Michigan’s track coach, Chuck Hoyt, noted that “Ward is his own boss and football is his recreation.” ...|$|E

500|$|Even after {{achieving}} the record, Hershiser expressed regret: [...] "Because {{of respect for}} Don {{and respect for the}} record, I don't think I should have walked to the mound in a situation where I'm supposed to be resting for the playoffs, just to beat a record. That would have tarnished the whole thing." [...] According to some sources, Drysdale was the person who convinced Hershiser to take the mound for the tenth inning, saying, [...] "I gave him a kick in the pants and told him {{to get out there and}} go as far as he can". However, other sources state that Drysdale merely said that if he had known about Hershiser's hesitance to break the record, he would have reassured him, saying [...] "I'd have kicked him right in the rear if I had known that... I'd <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> to get his buns out there and get them." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Digital Spy, Bhatti described {{his relationship with his}} daughter Afia, explaining that they have a [...] "strong bond" [...] and that Yusef would die for his daughter. He said that [...] "it definitely hurts" [...] when he finds out that Tamwar and Afia are already married as he is so close to Afia and she has betrayed him. [...] In {{an interview}} with Inside Soap, Bhatti admits that he is sympathetic for his character, Yusef. He said that Yusef is very insecure and that he can understand his behaviour in some ways. Meanwhile, discussing the fan reaction to his character, Bhatti admitted that women <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that he's a [...] "bad man". Bhatti also hinted that Yusef will become more firmly established as a Walford villain over the next few weeks, stating that Yusef does have more bad qualities than good and that fans call him [...] "Dr. Evil".|$|E
500|$|From {{the late}} 1960s onwards, Piccard {{returned}} to her childhood interest in religion. She was ordained a deacon of the Episcopal Church in 1971, and on July 29, 1974, {{became one of the}} Philadelphia Eleven, the first women to be ordained prieststhough the ordinations were regarded as irregular, performed by bishops who had retired or resigned. Piccard {{was the first of the}} women to be ordained that day, because at 79 she was the oldest, and because she was fulfilling an ambition she had had since she was 11 years old. When asked by Bishop John Allin, the head of the church, not to proceed with the ceremony, she is said to <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> [...] "Sonny, I'm old enough to have changed your nappies." [...] In September 1976, the church voted to allow women into the priesthood, and Piccard served as a priest in Saint Paul, Minnesota, until she died at the age of 86. One of her granddaughters, the Rev. Kathryn Piccard, also an Episcopal priest, said of her: [...] "She wanted to expand the idea of what a respectable lady could do. She had the image of the street-wise old lady." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Ghost of a Chance" [...] {{introduced}} {{several important}} characters {{that would be}} regularly featured throughout the series. Among them were prosecuting attorney Ed Danvers, played by Željko Ivanek, and police department bosses Colonel Burt Granger and Captain George Barnfather, played by Gerald F. Gough and Clayton LeBouef, respectively. Ivanek was cast by his long-time friend Fontana, who thought Danvers was written in a dull and simple way, but felt confident Ivanek could [...] "make it a real character". The episode also introduced Officer Chris Thormann (Lee Tergesen), who would become {{the center of a}} significant season one subplot in the next episode, [...] "", when he would be shot in the head during a failed arrest. Detective Tom Pellegrini, who handled the real-life Latonya Kim Wallace case and served {{as the basis for the}} Tim Bayliss character, appeared on-screen [...] as the police officer who first discovered Adena Watson's body. Pellegrini, who was still haunted by his failure to solve the Wallace case, specifically asked to be in that scene. During filming, he stayed close to the actress who played Watson, which Secor interpreted as an attempt to make amends to the real Wallace child. Although Pellegrini personally advised Secor on his performance, the actor later said he learned more about how to play Bayliss by watching Pellegrini during that scene than anything else the detective could <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
500|$|Desiring a {{realistic}} depiction of vulpine behavior and habits, Mannix {{spent more than}} a year studying the behaviors of a mated pair of foxes that he kept at his home. He stated that they were [...] "so tame [...] could turn them loose and watch them hunt, fight, make love, and live an almost normal life." [...] Additionally, he studied wild foxes and interviewed trappers, hunters, game wardens, and [...] "Masters of Hounds" [...] to learn what they felt foxes would and would not do. In the novel's postscript, Mannix discusses this research. [...] To defend his novel against charges of improbability, he recounts his observations of wild foxes and discusses other people's stories about fox behavior. Regarding the actions Tod takes in eluding the hunters, he details both witnessing wild foxes performing such acts and stories others shared with him that he used as a basis for some of the story's events. For example, he notes that while people <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that foxes do not really run among sheep or cattle herds to escape hounds, he himself used to watch them do just that from his bedroom window. In the case of a fox running along train tracks as a train is approaching, Mannix drew on a story told to him by a master of hunting in the area of Whitford Sales—near Thorndale, Pennsylvania—who had to stop hunting in the area because of a fox who consistently killed pursuing hounds on the Trenton Cutoff using this method.|$|E
500|$|In a 2015 interview, Pierre {{notes that}} fans <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> {{that they find}} Commit This to Memory a [...] "winter album," [...] to which he agrees, noting the unintentional mention {{of the new year}} in several songs. [...] His lyricism on Commit This to Memory centralizes around change and, in his words, [...] "being a {{complete}} fuckup, yet, at the same time, being somewhat successful". On the record, he [...] "addresses the themes of substance abuse, psychological disorders and failing relationships." [...] Pierre penned [...] "Everything Is Alright" [...] as a summary of his OCD (Obsessive–compulsive disorder) tendencies. He intended to utilize his social anxiety and fears in the song's form, which he has since employed in numerous other compositions. [...] "I don’t think the [...] "tongue-in-cheek" [...] is correct, but it’s something where the verses are one thing and then the chorus is another, but it's sort of like giving yourself a pep talk," [...] said Pierre. The song's lyrics include hating such mundane things as [...] "theme parks, flying, strangers, [...] waiting in line," [...] things that Pierre genuinely disliked {{at the time of the}} song's writing. For the record, he intended to simplify his lyrics to enhance storytelling and he drew inspiration from Tom Waits, Ben Folds and John K. Samson's writing styles. Keeping in the Waits/Folds inspiration, Pierre strove to write from another person's point of view; in the case of [...] "Time Turned Fragile", it is sung from the perspective of his father.|$|E
