50|$|For example, an amine will {{displace}} phosphine {{from the}} adduct with the acid BF3. In the same way, bases could be classified. For example, bases donating a lone pair from an oxygen atom are harder than bases donating through a nitrogen atom. Although the classification was never quantified {{it proved to}} be very useful in predicting the strength of adduct formation, using the key concepts that hard acid — <b>hard</b> <b>base</b> and soft acid — soft base interactions are stronger than hard acid — soft base or soft acid — <b>hard</b> <b>base</b> interactions. Later investigation of the thermodynamics of the interaction suggested that hard—hard interactions are enthalpy favored, whereas soft—soft are entropy favored.|$|E

50|$|The hard/soft acid/base {{principle}} is utilized to predict molecular interactions and reaction direction. In general, interactions between molecules {{of the same}} type are preferred.

5000|$|Because {{the oxygen}} atom in water has two lone pairs, water often {{acts as a}} Lewis base, or {{electron}} pair donor, in reactions with Lewis acids, although it can also react with Lewis bases, forming hydrogen bonds between the electron pair donors and the hydrogen atoms of water.

5000|$|As a <b>hard</b> <b>base,</b> water reacts readily {{with organic}} carbocations; {{for example in}} an {{hydration}} reaction, a hydroxyl group (...) and an acidic proton {{are added to the}} two carbon atoms bonded together in the carbon-carbon double bond, resulting in an alcohol. When addition of water to an organic molecule cleaves the molecule in two, hydrolysis is said to occur. Notable examples of hydrolysis are the saponification of fats and the digestion of proteins and polysaccharides. Water can also be a leaving group in SN2 substitution and E2 elimination reactions; the latter is then known as a dehydration reaction.|$|E

50|$|Colourless, {{diamagnetic}} Al(acac)3 is structurally {{similar to}} other tris complexes, e.g. Fe(acac)3. The trisacetylacetonates of the lanthanides often adopt coordination numbers above 8.

5000|$|An {{application}} of HSAB theory {{is the so-called}} Kornblum's rule (after Nathan Kornblum) which states that in reactions with ambident nucleophiles (nucleophiles that can attack from two or more places), the more electronegative atom reacts when the reaction mechanism is SN1 and the less electronegative one in a SN2 reaction. This rule (established in 1954) [...] predates HSAB theory but in HSAB terms its explanation {{is that in a}} SN1 reaction the carbocation (a hard acid) reacts with a <b>hard</b> <b>base</b> (high electronegativity) and that in a SN2 reaction tetravalent carbon (a soft acid) reacts with soft bases.|$|E

Special circular collars had a <b>hard</b> <b>base</b> which {{was covered with}} canvas and embroidered with glass beads, buttons and chains. Also there were reticular breast-collars made of red glass-beads and copper buttons. They finally matched perfectly with a huge embroidery of «panar» and «ruca». The Moksha women wore plenty of decorations on their hips. These decorations were made of shells, buttons and pendants. There were also special towels «kes-kolucjat» on hips. There could be 6 towels in one set. The footwear called «karht`» was made of bast. The bast shoes were criss-cross braided, with low sides and special loops. The Moksha women wrapped their legs around with white or black pieces of material called onuchi.|$|E
5000|$|Class A metals are metals {{that form}} hard acids. Hard acids are acids with {{relatively}} ionic bonds. These metals, such as iron, aluminium, titanium, sodium, calcium and the lanthanides, would rather bond with fluorine than iodine. They form stable products with <b>hard</b> <b>bases,</b> which are bases with ionic bonds. They target molecules such as phospholipids, nucleic acids and ATP.|$|R

50|$|One of {{the major}} {{recreational}} transport infrastructure systems in the city is the East Gippsland Rail Trail which begins in {{at the entrance to}} East Bairnsdale adjacent to Howitt Park. The track consists of asphalt that extends to Nicholson where it then becomes a track made from <b>hard</b> <b>base</b> gravel that forms a solid surface. Almost 100 km in length, the multi-use trail permits running, walking, cycling and horse-riding as it follows the alignment of the former railway line to Orbost. The Bairnsdale section of the track is relatively straight, long and flat and takes users over two small bridges and crosses Phillips Lane and Morrisson Road before it intersects with the Princes Highway, which was given that name in 1920 when the Country Roads Board assumed control of the whole length of highway between Melbourne and Eden.|$|E

Baradwaj Rangan called Kaakka Muttai an [...] "outstanding debut" [...] by Manikandan, {{going on to}} add, [...] "This {{is one of the}} most assured debuts I've seen — one deserving of more than just that consolation-prize-of-a-National-Award...Kaaka Muttai is so entertaining that it’s easy to forget how sad the undercurrents are". Indo-Asian News Service gave it 5 stars out of 5 and wrote, [...] "Kaaka Muttai is a little gem that's highly recommended and deserves to be celebrated". The Times of India gave the film 4 stars out of 5 and wrote, [...] "Manikandan's Kaaka Muttai is multi-layered; on the surface, it is all warm and inviting — a feel-good film about two kids and their simple desire and the earnestness in the filmmaking invites comparison with Iranian films like Children of Heaven...there is a <b>hard</b> <b>base</b> to it as well and from time to time, the film turns into a commentary on the class divide in our society and how it is exploited by wily politicians, an allegory of the effects of globalisation, and even a satire on media's obsession with sensationalism". Rediff gave it 4 out of 5, too, calling it a [...] "a delightful entertainer with a subtle message", [...] "brilliant" [...] and [...] "definitely a must watch". Firstpost wrote, [...] "Kaakka Muttai (is) one of the most charming films you'll see this year. It's beautifully shot, without making either slums or poverty look photogenic and exotic".|$|E

30|$|The {{effect of}} the {{presence}} of other metal ions present in the solution on the anodic peak currents of Cd (II) was evaluated. A 10 % change in the current response is assumed as a constant current response. No effect on the determination of Cd (II) was observed up to 250 -fold of Pb (II), 5 -fold of Cu (II), 25 -fold Ni (II), and 30 -fold Cr (VI). The results of interference study can be justified by hard-soft acid base theory. The main binding sites in these modifiers are COOH and OH groups, which are <b>hard</b> <b>bases,</b> whereas the metals Pb (II) and Cu (II) are intermediate; Cd (II), Hg (I), and Zn (II) are soft acids. According to hard-soft acid <b>base</b> theory, <b>hard</b> acid tends to form complexes with <b>hard</b> <b>bases,</b> and soft acids tend to form complexes with soft bases. Since copper is strongly bonded on electrode surface, so it is the most interfering metal.|$|R
