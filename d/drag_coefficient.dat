5|$|In May 1985, {{designers}} {{started work}} on the F1 project. In late 1985, designers presented the first exterior study models to F1 management, featuring a sports car-like design with a low-slung hood and narrow front profile. By 1986, the sedan used a three-box design with an upright stance, more prominent grille, and a two-tone body. Extensive modeling and wind tunnel tests resulted in a low <b>drag</b> <b>coefficient</b> for a conventional production vehicle of the time (C'd 0.29). For the passenger cabin, the materials-selection tests evaluated 24 different kinds of wood and multiple types of leather {{for two years before}} settling on specific trim combinations. By 1986, the Lexus marque was created to support the launch of the flagship sedan, and the vehicle became known as the Lexus LS. Following eight design reviews, subsequent revisions, concept approval in September 1986, and over US$1 billion in development expenses, the final design for the production Lexus LS 400 (chassis code UCF10) was frozen in May 1987 with design patents filed on 13 May 1987.|$|E

40|$|The {{use of the}} Buckingham Pi theorem in {{dimensional}} analysis suggests that the aerodynamic drag force that is exerted on parachutes is a quadratic function of speed, but it cannot determine the <b>drag</b> <b>coefficients</b> because they must be determined experimentally. In this article, experimental data are presented and used in two different, but complementary, ways {{to demonstrate that the}} drag force is quadratic, and to determine the corresponding <b>drag</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Curve-fitting a second-degree polynomial to the collected data makes it possible to verify directly that the nature of the force is quadratic and to estimate <b>drag</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Predicted terminal speeds of the parachutes are also used to determine the <b>drag</b> <b>coefficients.</b> A comparison of the two sets of results indicates that the combined use of the methods helps improve the accuracy of the drag force obtained...|$|R
25|$|The {{reduction}} of drag in road vehicles {{has led to}} increases in the top {{speed of the vehicle}} and the vehicle's fuel efficiency, as well as many other performance characteristics, such as handling and acceleration. The two main factors that impact drag are the frontal area of the vehicle and the <b>drag</b> <b>coefficient.</b> The <b>drag</b> <b>coefficient</b> is a unit-less value that denotes how much an object resists movement through a fluid such as water or air. A potential complication of altering a vehicle's aerodynamics is that it may cause the vehicle to get too much lift. Lift is an aerodynamic force that flows perpendicular to the airflow around the body of the vehicle. Too much lift can cause the vehicle to lose road traction which can be very unsafe. Lowering the <b>drag</b> <b>coefficient</b> comes from streamlining the exterior body of the vehicle. Streamlining the body requires assumptions about the surrounding airspeed and characteristic use of the vehicle.|$|E
25|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{design of}} cars {{has evolved from}} the 1920s {{to the end of}} the 20th century. This change in design from a blunt body to a more streamlined body reduced the <b>drag</b> <b>coefficient</b> from about 0.95 to 0.30.|$|E
25|$|Airships {{and some}} bodies of {{revolution}} use the volumetric <b>drag</b> <b>coefficient,</b> {{in which the}} reference area is {{the square of the}} cube root of the airship volume (volume to the two-thirds power). Submerged streamlined bodies use the wetted surface area.|$|E
40|$|Realistic {{modeling}} of polar sea ice dynamics and atmospheric processes over sea ice needs a detailed {{representation of the}} near-surface atmospheric fluxes of momentum. In this study, parametrizations of neutral <b>drag</b> <b>coefficients</b> mostly used in different general circulation models are compared with a recently developed parametrization including the impact of sea ice morphology. The new parametrization, using the sea ice and melt pond fraction as governing parameters, accounts for the effect of form drag caused by edges at leads, melt ponds, and floes. Based on remote sensing data of ice and melt pond fraction, it is shown that during Arctic summer the traditionally used <b>drag</b> <b>coefficients</b> differ from the new ones by a factor 0. 5 - 1. 2. The geographic distribution of <b>drag</b> <b>coefficients</b> obtained from both parametrizations is very different. Differences are due to a nonlinear and non-monotonic dependence of <b>drag</b> <b>coefficients</b> on sea ice concentration in the new parametrization. Citation: Lupkes, C., V. M. Gryanik, A.

25|$|The term drag area {{derives from}} aerodynamics, {{where it is}} the product of some {{reference}} area (such as cross-sectional area, total surface area, or similar) and the <b>drag</b> <b>coefficient.</b> In 2003, Car and Driver magazine adopted this metric as a more intuitive way to compare the aerodynamic efficiency of various automobiles.|$|E
25|$|The Bluebird was {{modified}} to front-wheel drive in October 1983, but retained the boxy styling of its predecessor.

40|$|Sea-ice {{elevation}} profiles and thickness measurements {{have been}} collected during summer 2011 in the Central Arctic. These two different data sets have been combined {{in order to obtain}} surface and bottom topography of the sea-ice. From the bottom profile, the keels of ridges are detected. Then, a parameterization of oceanic <b>drag</b> <b>coefficients</b> that accounts for the keels depth and density is applied. The calculated oceanic <b>drag</b> <b>coefficients</b> are highly variable (between about 2 × 10 − 3 and about 8 × 10 − 3) within the range of observed values. In order to estimate the contribution of variable <b>drag</b> <b>coefficients</b> on the Ekman pumping, the calculated <b>drag</b> <b>coefficients</b> are used in an idealized model experiment, where sea ice is drifting at constant velocity on an ocean at rest. The resulting variations of the Ekman vertical velocity are in the same order of magnitude as for variable ice velocity at the surface. In most state-of-the-art general circulation models, the variations of <b>drag</b> <b>coefficients</b> are not taken into account. The simple experiment carried out in the present study suggests that neglecting this contribution can lead to an incorrect representation of the momentum exchange between ice and ocean and to an underestimation of the Ekman pumping, with consequences for the large scale ocean circulation...|$|R

25|$|In 1885, Michelson began a {{collaboration}} with Edward Morley, spending considerable {{time and money}} to confirm with higher accuracy Fizeau's 1851 experiment on Fresnel's <b>drag</b> <b>coefficient,</b> to improve on Michelson's 1881 experiment, and to establish the wavelength of light as a standard of length. At this time Michelson was professor of physics at the Case School of Applied Science, and Morley was professor of chemistry at Western Reserve University (WRU), which shared a campus with the Case School on the eastern edge of Cleveland. Michelson suffered a nervous breakdown in September 1885, from which he recovered by October 1885. Morley ascribed this breakdown to the intense work of Michelson during the preparation of the experiments. In 1886, Michelson and Morley successfully confirmed Fresnel's <b>drag</b> <b>coefficient</b> – this result was also considered as a confirmation of the stationary aether concept.|$|E
25|$|The Aerodynamics Team is {{responsible}} for designing and constructing the outside shell of the vehicle. At most speeds, much of the power to drive the car is spent on air resistance. Thus, a shell with a low <b>drag</b> <b>coefficient</b> must be built.

25|$|While they do {{not have}} the biggest impact on the <b>drag</b> <b>coefficient</b> due to their small size, radio antennas {{commonly}} found protruding from the front of the vehicle can be relocated and changed in design to rid the car of this added drag.

40|$|A {{hierarchy}} of parametrizations of the neutral 10 m <b>drag</b> <b>coefficients</b> over polar sea ice with different morphology regimes is derived {{on the basis}} of a partitioning concept that splits the total surface drag into contributions of skin drag and form drag. The new derivation, which provides <b>drag</b> <b>coefficients</b> as a function of sea ice concentration and characteristic length scales of roughness elements, needs fewer assumptions than previous similar approaches. It is shown that form drag variability can explain the variability of surface drag in the marginal sea ice zone (MIZ) and in the summertime inner Arctic regions. In the MIZ, form drag is generated by floe edges; in the inner Arctic, by edges at melt ponds and leads due to the elevation of the ice surface relative to the open water surface. It is shown that an earlier fit of observed neutral <b>drag</b> <b>coefficients</b> is obtained as a special case within the new concept when specific simplifications are made which concern the floe and melt pond geometry. Due to the different surface morphologies in the MIZ and summertime Arctic, different functional dependencies of the <b>drag</b> <b>coefficients</b> on the sea ice concentration result. These differences cause only minor differences between the MIZ and summertime <b>drag</b> <b>coefficients</b> in average conditions, but they might be locally important for atmospheric momentum transport to sea ice. The new parametrization formulae can be used for present conditions but also for future climate scenarios with changing sea ice conditions...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made in}} the Langley 300 -mph 7 - by 10 -foot tunnel to determine the aerodynamic characteristics of a refined deep-step planing-tail hull with various forebody and afterbody shapes and, for comparison, a streamline body simulating the fuselage of a modern transport airplane. The results of the tests indicated that the configurations incorporating a forebody with a length-beam ratio of 7 had lower minimum <b>drag</b> <b>coefficients</b> than the configurations incorporating a forebody with length-beam ratio of 5. The lowest minimum <b>drag</b> <b>coefficients,</b> which were considerably less than that of a conventional hull and slightly less than that of a streamline body, were obtained on the length-beam-ratio- 7 forebody, alone and with round center boom. <b>Drag</b> <b>coefficients</b> and longitudinal- and lateral-stability parameters presented include the interference of a 21 -percent-thick support wing...|$|R
40|$|In {{employing}} {{blade element}} momentum (BEM) method {{to compute the}} performance of a turbine propeller, the lift and <b>drag</b> <b>coefficients</b> of propeller element/airfoil are needed. The coefficients are usually obtained from model experiment. Unfortunately, the model experiment can only be conducted for small angle of attack until stall mode. Beyond stall mode, Viterna extrapolation method is commonly used. The method is used to predict the lift and <b>drag</b> <b>coefficients</b> from stall angle to 90 o. Beyond that range, besides Viterna method, original flat plate theory assumption can also be adopted. The present study compares the lift and <b>drag</b> <b>coefficients</b> extrapolation using Viterna method and flat plat theory. NACA 2415 airfoil shape is used for computation.

25|$|Teague's {{low-drag}} design, which predated {{the fuel}} {{crisis and the}} flood of small foreign imports into the American market, was highly innovative. Its <b>drag</b> <b>coefficient</b> of 0.43 was relatively low for that time.

25|$|Aerodynamics were a {{focus of}} the vehicle design. The flat plastic {{undertray}} is used for ground effect aerodynamics and the rear bumper - {{in conjunction with the}} aerodynamically shaped muffler - forms a diffuser to reduce rear lift.
