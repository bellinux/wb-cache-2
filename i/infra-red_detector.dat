40|$|There {{has been}} much {{interest}} in the advancement of III-Nitride growth technology to fabricate AlGaN/GaN heterostructures for intersubband transitions (ISBTs). The large conduction band offset in these structures (up to 2 eV) allows transition energies in the near- to the far-infrared region, which have applications from telecommunications, such as in all-optical switches, to <b>infra-red</b> <b>detectors</b> for sensing and imaging. To date, ISBT electroluminescence has been elusive and absorption measurements remain an important method to verify band structure calculations. The growth quality can be inferred from the absorption spectrum, which will have line broadening with contributions that are both inhomogeneous (large-scale interface roughness, and non-parabolicity) and homogeneous (electron scattering related lifetime broadening). In the present work we calculated the contributions of various homogeneous broadening mechanisms (electron interaction with longitudinal-optical (LO) phonons, acoustic phonons, impurities and alloy disorder) to the full linewidth, and also the contribution of band non-parabolicity, which contributes to the inhomogeneous broadening. Calculations are then compared to the measured absorption spectra of several samples...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{work has}} focused on {{exploiting}} the observation that the stress-sum contours (isopachics), obtained from TSA, {{in the vicinity of}} the tip take the form of a simple curve – the cardioid. The analysis made use of the cardioid nature of the isopachics by deriving expressions for the SIFs in terms of the cardioid area and the positions of certain tangents to the curve. Both Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and Differential Evolution (DE) have also proved successful for parameter estimation, but some of the curve-fits indicated that the cardioid form was inappropriate for the base model, particularly for mixed-mode cracks. The effect of cracktip interaction has been explored and shows this has a small effect on the cardioid form. New, higher resolution <b>infra-red</b> <b>detectors</b> have become available since the original data was collected, so the object of the current paper is to use new techniques to extract the cardioid form and use a GA to perform the curve fitting...|$|R

They are only sensitive to changes in the IR flux and are well suited to sensing movements of people. The applications of low cost arrays with limited (a few hundred) elements for people sensing and radiometry will be illustrated. The performances of uncooled pyroelectric arrays are ultimately driven by the materials used. For this reason, continuous improvements in materials technology and figures-of-merit (FoM) are important. The performance of dense, bulk pyroelectric ceramics has not increased for several years, but nevertheless it is possible to obtain significant improvements in performance through the use of tape-cast, functionally gradient materials (FGMs) in which controlled porosity is used to control the permittivity and heat capacity of the material. A model for the performance of such a material will be presented, and compared with experimentally determined properties of FGMs based on a modified-PZT pyroelectric ceramic. The use of ferroelectric thin films is offering considerable potential for low cost and high performance.

Aerobee was the first US-designed rocket to reach space (albeit not orbit) and completed over 1,000 flights before it was retired in 1985.

The objective of this project is to design the hardware for an automated test station for the MFPA chips. This design was fabricated and assembled by the author.
