40|$|The thermal {{stability}} of nitrogen (N) functionalities on the sidewalls of N-doped multi-walled carbon nanotubes was investigated at temperatures ranging between 1000 degrees C and 2000 degrees C. The structural {{stability of the}} <b>doped</b> <b>tubes</b> was then correlated with the electrical conductivity both at the bulk and at the individual tube levels. When as-grown tubes were thermally treated at 1000 degrees C, we observed a very significant decrease in the electrical resistance of the individual nanotubes, from 54 k Omega to 0. 5 k Omega, which is attributed to a low N doping level (e. g. 0. 78 at% N). We noted that pyridine-type N was first decomposed whereas the substitutional N was stable up to 1500 degrees C. For nanotubes heat treated to 1800 degrees C and 2000 degrees C, the tubes exhibited an improved degree of crystallinity which was confirmed by both the low R value (I(D) /I(G)) in the Raman spectra {{and the presence of}} straight graphitic planes observed in TEM images. However, N atoms were not detected in these tubes and caused an increase in their electrical resistivity and resistance.

40|$|Controlling the {{diameter}} and chirality of carbon nanotubes to fine tune their electronic band gap {{will no longer}} be enough to satisfy the growing list of characteristics that future carbon nanotube applications are starting to require. Controlling their band gap, wall reactivity and mechanical properties is imperative to make them functional. The solution to these challenges is likely to lie in smart defect engineering. Defects of every kind can induce significant changes on the intrinsic properties of carbon nanotubes. In this context, this thesis analyzes the effects of doping single and double walled carbon nanotubes with nitrogen and boron. We describe the synthesis of N-doped single-walled carbon nanotubes (N-SWNTs), that agglomerate in bundles and form long strands (< 10 cm), via the thermal decomposition of ferrocene/ethanol/benzylamine (FEB) solutions in an Ar atmosphere at 950 °C. Using Raman spectroscopy, we noted that as the N content is increased in the starting FEB solution, the growth of large diameter tubes is inhibited. We observed that the relative electrical conductivity of the strands increases with increasing nitrogen concentration. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed novel features for highly <b>doped</b> <b>tubes,</b> that are related to chemical reactions on N sites. (cont.) We also carried out resonance Raman studies of the coalescence process of double walled carbon nanotubes in conjunction with high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) experiments on the same samples, heat treated to a variety of temperatures and either undoped or Boron doped. As the heat treatment temperatures are increased (to 1300 °C) a Raman mode related to carbon-carbon chains (w = 1855 cm- 1) is observed before DWNT coalescence occurs. These chains are expected to be 3 - 5 atoms long and they are established covalently between adjacent DWNTs. The sp carbon chains trigger nanotube coalescence via a zipper mechanism and the chains disappear once the tubes merge. Other features of the Raman spectra were analyzed as a function of heat treatment with special emphasis on the metallic or semiconducting nature of the layers constituting the DWNTs. DWNTs whose outer wall is metallic tend to interact more with the dopant and their outer tubes are the predominant contributors to the line shape of the G and G' bands. (cont.) The metallic or semiconducting nature of the layers of the DWNTs does not affect their coalescence temperature.

30|$|Recently, {{chemical}} doping of CNTs is {{an attractive}} proposition {{for a wide range}} of potential applications. Extrinsic <b>doping</b> of the <b>tube</b> surfaces can give rise to the formation of localized electronic states [9] and makes the tubes chemical active; hence, N-doped CNTs are less stable than their pure carbon counterparts, breaking easily [10] and oxidizing at lower temperature than undoped CNTs [11] due to the fact of nitrogen atoms as localized defects, which will be energetically less stable than a pure carbon lattice. Moreover, it will make CNT surfaces chemically active by chemical modification [12]. Their active surfaces mean they can be dispersed in a range of solvents not possible with undoped tubes [13]. On the other hand, it is found that N-doped CNTs only show the metallic behavior with a strong donor peak just above the Fermi level [14], unlike undoped CNTs which exhibit a variety of metallic and semiconducting behavior depending on their chirality.|$|R

The total charge passed through the system during potential controlled electrolysis of the thin layer sample is indeed found to be proportional to the amount of calcium present, but non-Faradaic processes do contribute to the obtained signal. We introduce here a multi-pulse procedure that allows one to perform a second excitation pulse at the same excitation potential after exhaustive ion transfer voltammetry of calcium has taken place. The intercept of the calibration curve after background subtraction is found as 20. 6 ± 0. 6 μC, significantly lower than the value of 54. 1 ± 0. 8 μC for the uncorrected curve.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{electronic}} properties of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) from room temperature down to 10 mK by performing electronic transport spectroscopy measurements on individual single-wall nanotubes, nanotube ropes and untreated bulk SWNT material. Transport in metallic single-wall nanotubes at dilution refrigerator temperatures occurs via the resonant tunneling of electrons through discrete molecular orbitals of the tubes. The discrete energy level splitting in a 0. 8 μm long nanotube was roughly 1. 2 meV, which agrees with the 1 meV estimate for the energy level splitting. Zeeman splitting of a single particle level was observed when a magnetic field was applied perpendicular to the tube, which yielded g = 1. 8 for the electronic g-factor in a nanotube. Due to the small capacitance of the nanotube, the conductance at low bias voltages is suppressed by the Coulomb blockade. Surprisingly, the differential conductance of the tube shows a pattern of single electron charging that suggests the tube behaves as a couple of quantum dots in series. A numerical simulation, based on {{a model of a}} tube with three levels, reproduces some prominent features of the data. ^ Electrons in a nanotube occupy 1 D subbands. Sharp van Hove singularities in the density of states are expected at the band edges of the 1 D modes and were observed as steps in the current-voltage characteristics of a semiconducting nanotube at 77 K. By varying an external gate voltage we electrostatically <b>doped</b> the <b>tube</b> and controllably populated its subbands. The IV characteristics of a segment of the nanotube covered in part by an impurity were highly asymmetric. This was {{in sharp contrast to the}} symmetric IVs observed for a clean segment of the same tube. A simple band model, in which the impurity acts as a local charge dopant, can account for the diodic behavior of the tube. ^ Early experiments on “mats” of bulk SWNT material revealed that low temperature transport in the bulk occurs via three dimensional (3 D) variable range hopping of electrons between localized states. A typical characteristic temperature T 0 for the material is 110 K. The bulk samples also exhibited a negative magneto-resistance, which indicates that transport in the mats is partly phase coherent. We used 3 D weak localization theory to fit the data and obtained l 2 ̆ 6 phis; = 1500 Å for the phase coherence length at 100 mK. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{preparation}} of silica-doped high aspect-ratio TiO 2 nanotubes and their apatite-forming ability were demonstrated in this study. The high aspect-ratio TiO 2 nanotube layers were produced by electrochemical anodic oxidation of Ti in chloride-containing electrolytes. Nanotubes were doped with different concentrations of silica particles through anodization in NaCl electrolyte containing different concentrations of water glass - 24 g/L or 48 g/L Na 2 SiO 3). The biomimetic apatite deposition behavior was evaluated under simulated body fluid (SBF) with an ion concentration nearly equal to human blood plasma. The experimental results collectively demonstrate the successful silica doping of the resultant nanotube layers with significant abundant OH groups on their surfaces. The results of hydroxyapatite (HA) growth on nanotubes clearly {{show that the}} silica doping greatly enhances the fast nucleation and growth of HA, especially for the tubes in their &# 8220;as-formed&# 8221; amorphous state, which usually require {{a long time for}} apatite induction.

The maximum event {{rate at which the}} detector could operate was limited to ~ 1 sec(^- 1), by the presence of internal fields which resulted in spuriousness or inefficiency. The use of modified H„T, pulsing systems has also been investigated as a means of reducing the internal field, A modified detector was constructed, utilising large diameter, low pressure flash tubes, in an attempt to improve the maximum event rate, yet maintain the same useful resolution. An energy resolution of 33 % and spatial and angular resolutions of 11 mm and 2 º (FWHM) were obtained, which compares favourably with more complex and expensive detectors. Unexpectedly, at event rates in excess of a few per second, the tubes behaved either spuriously or inefficiently, due to large internal fields. Investigations into the mechanisms of formation and decay of the internal fields have been made by observation of the digitisation output pulse. This novel approach may, with refinement, be of use in future studies of gas discharges since it is particularly sensitive to the gas breakdown mechanism. The significance of the outer surface resistance of the flash tube has also beer demonstrated to be of importance to the performance of the tube.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{dedicated}} to development and application of a novel large-scale first-principles approach to study the electronic structure and quantum conductance of realistic nanoscale materials. Electron transport at the nanometer scale involves phenomena which are {{beyond the realm of}} classical transport theory: the wave character of the electrons becomes central, and the Schrddinger equation needs to be solved explicitly. First-principles calculations can nowadays deal with systems containing hundreds of electrons, but simulations for nanostructures that contain thousands of atoms or more need to rely on parametrized Hamiltonians. The core of our approach lies in the derivation of exact and chemically-specific Hamiltonians from first-principles calculations, in a basis of maximally-localized Wannier functions, that become explicit tight-binding orbitals. Once this optimal basis is determined, the Hamiltonian matrix becomes short-ranged, diagonally-dominant, and transferable - i. e. a large nanostructure can be constructed by assembling together the Hamiltonians of its constitutive building block. This approach is first demonstrated for pristine semiconducting and metallic nanotubes, demonstrating perfect agreement with full first-principles calculations in a complete planewave basis. (cont.) Then, it is applied to study the electronic structure and quantum conductance of functionalized carbon nanotubes. The first class of functionalizing addends, represented by single-bond covalent ligands (e. g. hydrogens or aryls), turns out to affect very strongly the back-scattering and the conductance, since sp 3 rehybridization at the sidewall carbon where a group is attached dramatically perturbs the conjugated [pi]-bonding network. Inspection on the shape and the on-site energy of MLWFs before and after functionalizations leads {{to the conclusion that the}} effect of sp 3 rehybridization is essentially identical to removing a "half-filled" p-orbital from the [pi]-manifold. In this perspective, the chemical difference between functional groups (e. g. different electronegativity of the residues) is relatively minor, even if, of course, will lead to different <b>doping</b> of the <b>tube.</b> We also find that these single-bond ligands tend to cluster, and are more stable when two groups are located nearby (incidentally, the degree of perturbation at the Fermi level becomes weaker when such paired configuration is assumed). The second class of functionalizing addends, represented by cycloaddition functionalizations (e. g. carbenes and nitrenes), demonstrates a radically different behavior. (cont.) These addends are bonded to two neighboring sidewall carbon atoms, creating a three-membered ring structure. On narrow-diameter tubes, cleaving of the sidewall bond takes place to release the high strain energy of a three-membered ring. In the process, the two sidewall carbons recover their original sp 2 hybridization. This step is crucial, since the quantum conductance of a metallic nanotube then recovers almost perfectly the ideal limit of a pristine tube: the bond cleavage restores a transparent conduction manifold. Bond cleavage is controlled by the chemistry of the functional groups and the curvature of the nanotubes. High-curvature favors bond opening, whereas in graphene the bond is always closed; in between the two limits, chemistry determines the critical curvature at which the open-to-closed transition takes place. The preference for bond opening or closing has been screened extensively for different classes of functional groups, using initially some molecular homologues of the nanotubes. It is found that a subclass of addends, exemplified by dicyanocarbene, can assume both the open and closed form in the same tube around a narrow range of diameters. (cont.) While these two forms are very similar in energy, and separated by a small barrier (hence they can be considered "fluxional" tautomers), the quantum conductance in the closed case is found to be significantly lower than that in the open case. Interconversion between the two minima could then be directed by optical or electrochemical means, in turn controlling the conductance of the functionalized tubes. We envision thus that this novel class of functionalization will offer a practical way toward non-destructive chemistry that can either preserve the metallic conductance of the tubes, or modulate it in real-time, with foreseeable applications in memories, sensors, imaging, and optoelectronic devices. by Young-Su Lee.

40|$|Single-wall carbon {{nanotubes}} after {{a decade}} of research show fascinating properties with a promising prospective for possible applications. Their nanometer size and micrometer lengths make them an ideal material for research in nanotechnology. Contrary to most of the molecules, experiments in diﬀerent scientiﬁc areas have been possible due to their robust, chemical inert characteristics (Chapter 1). We have successfully produced CNTs by CVD method. It has been shown that this method is well suited for the investigation of their electrical and mechanical properties. The main advantages of the CVD technique is that CNTs can be grown at speciﬁc location with ﬂexibility to routinely implement them for diﬀerent investigation purposes. Their electronic transport properties have been explored by fabricating the contacts by EBL or optical lithography in straightforward manner. In this thesis, investigation has been focused on CNT’s electronic transport properties from room to low temperature. Although their main characterization at room temperature (the gate dependance and high bias characteristics) does not depend dramatically on the contact resistance, low temperature measurement reveal the importance of the contact resistance and their correlation with the observed phenomena. We have found that problem of the contact resistance can be overcome by annealing of the devices contacted with Ti or using Pd as metallic electrodes on as grown CNT (Chapter 2). Ambipolar ﬁeld-eﬀect transistor action has been demonstrated on asgrown semiconducting SWNTs (Chapter 3). The observed ambipolar FETs can be tuned with a back-gate from p- to n-type conduction through the semiconducting gap. We have attributed high tunability of our devices to hydrogen presence during the CVD grow, which probably reduce trapped charges in a Si/SiO 2 substrate, making coupling to the gate more eﬀective. Electron and hole transport in the Coulomb blockade regime have been investigated in detail. A strong sensitivity on disorder has been observed in semiconducting SWNTs, which eﬀectively brake the nanotube in small sections ≈ 40 nm forming multi-dot system. However, for suﬃcient doping i. e. by the gate voltage, localized states can be populated, where the transport occurs through an individual orbital. Moreover, <b>doping</b> of the <b>tube</b> section to higher subbands has been demonstrated. Detailed, two terminal transport measurements at low temperature have been performed on the metallic SWNT devices (Chapter 4). Spectroscopy on a SWNT QD can be performed by measuring the conductance {{as a function of the}} gate and bias voltages. For low transparent contacts, a SWNT behaves as a quantum dot where the transport phenomena are dominated by the single-electron charging effect (Coulomb blockade). For high transparent contacts, the four-fold degeneracy is observed with the Kondo effect. We have discussed several possible shell filling scenarios in SWNTs. In detail, the ground state of CNTs at half-filling, i. e. for N = 2 added electrons to one shell, is analyzed. We demonstrate that this state is either the singlet or a state for which the singlet and triplet are effectively degenerate, allowing in the latter case for the appearance of the Kondo effect at N = 2. For even higher transparency Fano resonances are observed. The origin of these resonances are identified as an interference between the resonant and non-resonant channels within a bundle of SWNTs. Finally, as grown CNTs have been suspended with three different methods to explore their mechanical properties (Chapter 5). We have shown that thermal vibrations are readily observed in SEM if the suspended length of a SWNT is sufficient (& 1 μm). Good agrement is found between thermal vibration derived for an elastic beam in continuum mechanics, with corresponding Young’s modulus in TPa range. However, for the SWNTs suspended by wet etching Young’s modulus seems to be smaller (� 20 GPa). The possible interpretations are that wet etching severely damage CNT or that the boundary conditions are different than in the cases for the growth over predefined trenches and Si 3 N 4 membranes. Our investigation showed that possible implementation of CNTs as nano-electromechanical resonators urges for careful design of the experiments with desirable control of their physical properties (diameter). In this thesis, we have demonstrated that transport investigation in CNTs show pronounced quantum effects with fascinating possibilities to explore the fundamental phenomena which has been elusive in other systems (S-QD-S, spin injection in low dimensional systems, Luttinger liquid, etc). In that respect, the exploration of CNTs opened a new chapter in material science and nanotechnology, as important milestone for the future investigation of molecular based devices...|$|R
