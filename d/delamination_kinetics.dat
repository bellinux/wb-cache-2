40|$|International audienceLocal Electrochemical Impedance Mapping (LEIM) {{methodology}} {{was adopted}} {{to quantify the}} propagation of electrochemically active regions with a micrometric precision. The method consisted {{in the use of}} the gradient modulus of the admittance map as a parameter for the spatial quantifi-cation. Numerical simulations were used to optimize the experimental conditions, namely the AC frequency, the distance between the local bi-probe and the working electrode, and the distances between the probes for the local bi-probe used for the local current mapping. This analysis was reinforced by experimental verifications on coated electrodes. The quantitative LEIM methodology was successfully applied to follow the <b>delamination</b> <b>kinetics</b> on Zn coated with the polyvinyl butyral polymer in NaCl solutions. At 1 kHz, the LEIM response only reflected the position of the anodic front beneath the polymer because oxygen reduction reaction was diffusion limited and hence, independent of the applied potential. This novel LEIM methodology completes the set of usual tools used to investigate the delamination mechanisms on metal substrates...|$|E

The delamination {{is caused by the}} total stress including the internal oxygen pressure in LSM near the electrode/electrolyte interface, and the tensile stress by the oxygen migration from the YSZ electrolyte to LSM lattice. Weibull theory is used to determine the survival probability of electrode/electrolyte interface under the total stress. The relaxation time corresponding to the time for oxygen diffusion from the interface to the microcracks in La₀. ₈Sr₀. ₂MnO₃ links the survival probability with polarization time, thus the survival interface area can be predicted with varying anodic polarization time. The model is validated with experimental data. The effects of applied anodic current and operating temperature are discussed. The present model provides a starting point to study more complex cases, such as composite oxygen electrodes.

40|$|The {{oxidation}} of dopamine in aqueous solutions deposits thin conformal {{films on}} a wide variety of material surfaces. These films consist of a material known as polydopamine (PDA), and they exhibit chemical and structural similarities to melanin pigments and adhesive proteins secreted by mussels. The facile synthesis and versatile adhesion of PDA enable the functional modification of numerous material surfaces for applications in biomedical devices, energy storage, and water purification. This thesis details fundamental investigations into the deposition, oxidation, and adhesive mechanisms of PDA films. Depositing PDA films on substrates with different controlled chemistries revealed the importance of solution pH and initial deposition rates on the morphology of the films. The deposition of PDA molecules with increasing pH depends on two competing factors: increased generation rate of PDA molecules versus increased solubility due to catechol ionization. The areal density and coverage of three-dimensional PDA islands is influenced by the surface charge and hydrophobicity of the substrate in aqueous solutions. Spectroscopic and electrochemical characterization of PDA films revealed that redox-inactive metal cations can accelerate the oxidation of PDA. The generation of radicals of 5, 6 -dihydroxyindole were monitored in situ via ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy as a function of cation concentration and pH. The extent of oxidation was quantified by cyclic voltammetry. The resulting oxidation modifies the metal sorption properties of PDA by generating more carboxylic acid groups and enhancing the iron chelation of the films. The adhesive stability of PDA films was characterized by <b>delamination</b> <b>kinetics</b> of films on SiO 2 and indium tin oxide (ITO). PDA film adhesion is a substrate, salt, and oxidation-dependent phenomenon. Long-term adhesive stability of PDA films can be promoted by use of higher dopamine concentrations during synthesis, incorporation of multivalent cations, and avoiding alkaline conditions and strongly oxidizing electrical bias. Elastic moduli of PDA films were quantified by compressive thin film wrinkling, and the measured value of 2. 0 ± 0. 9 GPA agrees with simulations of PDA based on an oligomeric aggregate model. This thesis helps develop a framework for understanding the synthesis, composition, microstructure, and stability of PDA films...|$|E
