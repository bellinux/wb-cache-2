500|$|The first-round {{series against}} the Magic was touted as the matchup {{between two of the}} league's best young big men in Bosh and Dwight Howard. Howard {{dominated}} throughout the series, while Bosh had a serires-best effort in Game 4 with 39 points and 15 rebounds. General Manager Bryan Colangelo said at a press conference after the series, [...] "Whether it's protecting [...] inside the paint, <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more of a presence in there, to just getting him another scorer that's going to shoulder some of that burden, it's something that's clear we have to get better", hinting that the roster was in need of an overhaul. Bosh said after the loss, [...] "They played a great series, they executed on offence and defense better than we did and {{when it came to the}} small things, they did a better job... I can't sit here and bark in protest that the better team didn't win. That's pretty obvious. They beat us pretty good." [...] Unlike the previous campaign, Bosh was not named to any of the All-NBA teams.|$|E

A legal dispute with Rough Trade had delayed the album by almost seven months (it had been {{completed}} in November 1985), and Marr {{was beginning to feel}} the stress of the band's exhausting touring and recording schedule. He later told NME, [...] "'Worse for wear' wasn't the half of it: I was extremely ill. By the time the tour actually finished it was all <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit...</b> dangerous.

[...] He allegedly received notice of his dismissal via a Post-it note stuck to the windscreen of his car. It read, [...] "Andy – you have left the Smiths. Goodbye and good luck, Morrissey."

2500|$|In 1989 Spin {{magazine}} rated The Queen is Dead as {{number one}} of [...] "The Greatest Albums Ever Made". Spin {{was not alone}} in this designation—numerous periodicals rank the Smiths and their albums, especially The Queen is Dead, high on their best ever lists. NME, for example, has dubbed the Smiths the most important rock band of all time. However, a legal dispute with Rough Trade had delayed the album by almost seven months (it had been completed in November 1985), and Marr was beginning to feel the stress of the band's exhausting touring and recording schedule.

2500|$|Gillan had {{substantial}} {{input into}} Amy's costume, {{as well as}} her hair and make-up. In the first episode, costume designer Ray Holman stated that Amy's identity was not clear and that she wore her own clothes later on. Gillan thought that Amy had inner confidence to wear clothes that showed [...] "a bit of skin from time to time". Gillan said she tried on many things, {{but when it came to}} short skirts she [...] "just thought it was right" [...] and showed that Amy was [...] "comfortable and confident about her look". She believed that the skirts reflected what young women typically wear at her age. Executive producer Piers Wenger also noted that Amy's 1970s flying jacket, which she wears [...] "quite a lot", reflected Gillan was a [...] "born adventurer" [...] and Amy developed a love for travel and adventure. In the sixth series, Amy wears more jeans and longer trousers; Gillan stated, [...] "she's <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more tomboyish as she becomes more of an action girl". Amy never wears heels, as Gillan desired that the footwear be functional for saving the world.|$|E
2500|$|In a 1993 {{interview}} with Miller, Option wrote that success was a touchy subject for him, quoting Miller's joking {{example of a}} typical review: [...] "Nothing good ever happens to Scott Miller, but somehow he's managed to drag his broken body into a studio {{one more time and}} make another album." [...] Miller continued that he was [...] "past the point of fighting" [...] discussions of how [...] "arty or brainy" [...] he was, but had hoped for greater emphasis [...] "on what the songs are about—be it the boy-girl situation, or being depressed about some key failure I've had, or <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of understanding about life." [...] In another 1993 interview, Miller mused:I don't think I'm in danger of making albums that don't age well, because I haven't ever fit into the times spectacularly well. I've always been aware of myself drawing on a musical vocabulary so broad {{that a lot of people}} don't get what I consider to be my real songwriting coups. I think they go right past a lot of people. The bad part of that is I probably won't become a big star. But the good part is that I don't think people will find the albums less useful over time. They'll sound as good in 2004 as they will in 1994.|$|E
