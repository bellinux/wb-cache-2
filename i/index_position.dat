60|$|We rode through endless {{thickets}} of yellow-pollened cassi--if riding {{it could}} be called; for those fragrant thickets were inhabited by wasps. And such wasps! Great yellow fellows the size of small canary birds, darting through the air with behind them drifting a bunch of legs {{a couple of inches}} long. A stallion abruptly stands on his forelegs and thrusts his hind legs skyward. He withdraws them from the sky long enough to make one wild jump ahead, and then returns them to their <b>index</b> <b>position.</b> It is nothing. His thick hide has merely been punctured by a flaming lance of wasp virility. Then a second and a third stallion, and all the stallions, begin to cavort on their forelegs over the precipitous landscape. Swat! A white-hot poniard penetrates my cheek. Swat again!! I am stabbed in the neck. I am bringing up the rear and getting more than my share. There is no retreat, and the plunging horses ahead, on a precarious trail, promise little safety. My horse overruns Charmian's horse, and that sensitive creature, fresh-stung at the psychological moment, planks one of his hoofs into my horse and the other hoof into me. I thank my stars that he is not steel-shod, and half-arise from the saddle at the impact of another flaming dagger. I am certainly getting more than my share, and so is my poor horse, whose pain and panic are only exceeded by mine.|$|E

The inverted index was comprised of two tables. The first table contained for each word <b>indexed</b> <b>positions</b> pointing to the other table [e.g. (word, index_positions)]. The second table contained sentiment scores for each <b>indexed</b> <b>position</b> [e.g. (<b>index,</b> SentimentScores)]. Thus, sentiment scores could be quickly found based on indexed words of the first table, and indexes of the second table instead of iterating each word in SentiWordNet (1 st version of algorithm). The inverted index was created before execution of an experiment.|$|R

Position selection is performed using a genetic algorithm (GA) which takes a list of cutting tools assigned to certain machining operations together with total number of <b>index</b> <b>positions</b> available on the ATC or turret magazines and, catalogue value of indexing time as the input, and then randomly generates an initial population of position sets (chromosomes).

Based on the fitness values, the next generation is formed from the newly generated sequences and old population.

40|$|AbstractWhen {{subjects}} learn a novel motor task, {{several sources}} of feedback (proprioceptive, visual or auditory) {{contribute to the}} performance. Over the past few years, several studies have investigated the role of visual feedback in motor learning, yet evidence remains conflicting. The {{aim of this study}} was therefore to investigate the role of online visual feedback (VFb) on the acquisition and retention stages of motor learning associated with training in a reaching task. Thirty healthy subjects made ballistic reaching movements with their dominant arm toward two targets, on 2 consecutive days using a robotized exoskeleton (KINARM). They were randomly assigned to a group with (VFb) or without (NoVFb) VFb of <b>index</b> <b>position</b> during movement. On day 1, the task was performed before (baseline) and during the application of a velocity-dependent resistive force field (adaptation). To assess retention, participants repeated the task with the force field on day 2. Motor learning was characterized by: (1) the final endpoint error (movement accuracy) and (2) the initial angle (iANG) of deviation (motor planning). Even though both groups showed motor adaptation, the NoVFb-group exhibited slower learning and higher final endpoint error than the VFb-group. In some condition, subjects trained without visual feedback used more curved initial trajectories to anticipate for the perturbation. This observation suggests that learning to reach targets in a velocity-dependent resistive force field is possible even when feedback is limited. However, the absence of VFb leads to different strategies that were only apparent when reaching toward the most challenging target...|$|E
