Prefabricated (GAC) stainless steel arches were used for 60 - 198 days (median time 122 days). The effect was recorded with a measuring microscope on dental casts from {{before and after the}} treatment. Molar positions were determined from the tips of the four cusps of the tooth in relation to a coordinate system based on palatal reference points. The centre of rotation of the molars during <b>derotation</b> were calculated from the movement of their cusps. Before <b>derotation</b> the first molars were significantly mesiopalatally rotated compared with the normal occlusion group. The <b>derotation</b> overcompensated the initial rotation. In about two-thirds of the cases the mesiobuccal cusp of the molar moved distally during the <b>derotation.</b> In the remaining cases it moved mesially or remained unchanged. The median distal movement was 0. 3 mm on the right and 0. 5 mm on the left side.

40|$|Study Design: A {{retrospective}} radiographic study. Purpose: To {{evaluate the}} axial plane lumbar responses after anterior selective thoracic fusion (STF) {{in patients with}} main thoracic adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (MT-AIS). Overview of Literature: Anterior scoliosis surgery induces more MT <b>derotation</b> through disc preparation than posterior surgery. Methods: Twenty-eight MT-AIS patients treated with STF were evaluated after a minimum follow-up (FU) of 2 years. The MT and lumbar coronal angles, {{as well as the}} MT and lumbar rotational angles at the most rotated vertebrae were measured. Results: At the last FU, the MT coronal correction and <b>derotation</b> rates were 65 % and 41 %, respectively. The lumbar coronal correction rate was 61 % but there was minimal lumbar <b>derotation</b> (2 %). Nine cases were decompensated (coronal balance> 10 mm). After surgery, the compensated and decompensated groups showed similar MT coronal and axial correction rates. During the FU, the MT and lumbar apecies rotated in the same direction (r= 0. 443). In addition, significant MT <b>derotation</b> occurred in the decompensated group with increasing lumbar rotational correction loss. At the last FU, while the MT coronal correction was similar between the two groups, there was more MT <b>derotation</b> in the decompensated group. Furthermore, the MT rotational change was strongly associated with the coronal C 7 plumb line position (r= 0. 728).

Methods In a prospective study, 30 children with spastic diplegia and IRG were treated with FDO as part of a multilevel surgery and were examined pre- and postoperatively clinically, by three-dimensional gait analysis and by torsional MRI according to a standardised protocol. Results A correlation (r = 0. 317, p = 0. 015) between the extent of intraoperative <b>derotation</b> and mean hip rotation in stance as well as the anteversion angle measured on torsional MRI (r = 0. 454, p < 0. 001) was found. However, no significant correlation was observed between anteversion angle (tMRI) and mean hip rotation in stance, either before or after FDO. Conclusions Significant improvements were found in IRG after FDO, confirming the results of previous studies. There was no correlation between the anteversion measured on MRI and the mean hip rotation in stance in 3 D gait analysis before or after FDO. Thus, the data suggest that if the intraoperative extent of <b>derotation</b> is determined only by the anteversion angle, the result will not be better after FDO. It might only help to avoid retroversion and indicate the maximum amount of femoral <b>derotation.</b> In this study the extent of the intraoperative <b>derotation</b> was orientated at the preoperative midpoint of rotation.

40|$|STUDY DESIGN: A {{prospective}} {{cohort study}} of Cobb angles (CA) and apical vertebral rotations (AVR) in 25 {{patients who had}} adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. OBJECTIVE: To assess in vivo the concomitant vertebral <b>derotation</b> occurring with correction of scoliosis deformity {{as a result of}} coupling effect by using the fulcrum bending radiograph and to assess whether the fulcrum bending radiograph can predict the amount of postoperative apical <b>derotation</b> when no additional intraoperative apical <b>derotation</b> maneuver is used. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a 3 -dimensional coupling deformity. Various studies have reported vertebral derotational effects, using different implant constructs and surgical techniques for AIS. However, none of them have considered the spontaneous coupling effect on vertebral <b>derotation</b> produced by correction of the coronal deformity, in particular, using the predictive capacity of the preoperative fulcrum bending radiograph. METHOD: Twenty-five patients with flexible Lenke type 1 AIS with CA greater than 45 degrees who underwent posterior spinal fusion with instrumentation, without direct apical <b>derotation</b> were prospectively assessed. CA and AVR in standing, supine, and fulcrum bending positions preoperatively and in supine position postoperatively were assessed on radiographs and computed tomographic scans. RESULTS. : The study entailed 80 % adolescent girls and 20 % adolescent boys (mean age, 15. 5 years). The mean AVR values on preoperative standing, supine, and fulcrum bending positions and postoperation were 24. 2 degrees, 17. 7 degrees, 9. 8 degrees, and 8. 1 degrees respectively. The preoperative AVR highly correlated with the preoperative CA (R = 0. 75). The postoperative AVR was correlated with the postoperative CA (r = 0. 82) and the change in curve magnitude (r = - 0. 49), correction rate (r = - 0. 83), and fulcrum bending correction index (r = - 0. 45) (P < 0. 05). There {{was no significant difference in}} AVR between preoperative fulcrum bending and postoperative assessment. CONCLUSION: Correction of scoliosis deformity produces spontaneous reduction of rotational deformity through coupling. The amount of spontaneous apical vertebral <b>derotation</b> with fulcrum bending can be used to assess the flexibility of the rotational deformity. In flexible curves, it also predicts the amount of apical <b>derotation</b> achievable with surgery. These should be considered when assessing the derotational effect of different implants and surgical strategies. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

30|$|A {{treatment}} {{option in}} class I and class II malocclusions with {{mild to moderate}} crowding and concomitant molar rotations {{is the use of}} a transpalatal arch (TPA).

40|$|The {{moments and}} forces {{delivered}} by round transpalatal arches {{of steel and}} of beta-titanium (TMA) for symmetrical <b>derotation</b> of molars were studied in laboratory experiments. Three sizes of arches were tested in two series. In the first series, the degree of activation was checked for symmetry in a computer-based strain-gauge measuring system. In the second series, the activation {{was carried out in}} a way simulating clinical use. The mesio-distal and transverse forces and the derotating moments at full activation and during <b>derotation</b> in steps of 5 degrees were measured. At full activation, the steel arches delivered relatively large moments which, however, decreased rapidly during deactivation. The TMA arches had a larger working range. It was not possible to achieve full symmetry of the moments at the two ends of the arch. The difference of the two moments resulted in forces acting on the two anchorage teeth in a mesio-distal direction. These forces were generally small but could reach clinically relevant magnitude. The <b>derotation</b> resulted in a contractive force of up to 2. 7 N which has to be compensated for by expansion. The mode of activation simulating clinical use resulted in reasonably constant forces and moments.

Methods: We reviewed data on patients who underwent proximal femoral <b>derotation</b> osteotomy for symptomatic intoeing gait caused by femoral anteversion. Only symptomatic patients were considered for corrective <b>derotation</b> osteotomy. Degree of femoral anteversion was confirmed on computed tomography (CT) scan. 				 					Results: Thirty-five extremities were operated in 21 patients with an average age of 13. 3 (8 – 18) years. Mean follow-up was 16  months (6 – 36 months). Mean femoral anteversion angle was 40. 8 ° (28 °– 53 °). External rotation of extended hips improved significantly, from 30 ° to 51. 8 ° (p <  0. 0001). Mean foot progressing angle improved from 15. 2 ° internally rotated preoperatively to 7. 7 ° externally rotated. Intoeing completely resolved in all except two patients. Thirteen out of 21 children complained about tripping and frequent falling while running and playing sports, eight patients had hip pain while 13 children had knee pain preoperatively. Tripping, falling and hip pain resolved in all patients postoperatively, while three patients whose primary complaint was knee pain failed to improve postsurgery.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of this retrospective study were {{to evaluate the}} effect of direct vertebral <b>derotation</b> on the sagittal alignment of the spine after selective posterior thoracic fusion for Lenke Type I adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Preservation of the sagittal alignment has become critical {{in the management of}} spinal deformity. Better coronal and rotational corrections in posterior selective thoracic fusion for AIS have been reported with direct vertebral <b>derotation</b> as compared with the simple rod rotation technique. A greater lordogenic effect has been anticipated with direct vertebral derotation; however, data comparing those two techniques in terms of correction in the sagittal plane are still lacking. Standing full-spine PA and standard lateral serial X-rays of a total of 30 consecutive patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis treated between 2002 and 2008 at a single institution were evaluated. All the patients had Lenke Type I curves and underwent selective posterior thoracic fusion with pedicle screw instrumentation. Patients who were treated with additional osteotomies and concave or convex thoracoplasty or concomitant anterior releases were excluded. Minimum follow-up period was 24  months. Preoperative and postoperative coronal and sagittal spinal alignments in both the groups were compared. In 13 patients, the correction was achieved by means of a simple rod rotation (SRR). In 17 patients, the technique of direct vertebral <b>derotation</b> (DVD) was used. Scoliosis correction averaged 67 and 69 %, respectively, and was similar in both groups (p >  0. 05). Thoracic kyphosis and lumbar lordosis remained unchanged in the SRR group (p >  0. 1). In the direct vertebral <b>derotation</b> group, a significant decrease of both thoracic kyphosis and lumbar lordosis of 8. 1 ° and 11. 8 °, respectively, was observed (p <  0. 0001). Global sagittal balance remained within normal limits in all the patients at the latest follow-up. Decrease in thoracic kyphosis and lumbar lordosis should be taken into account when using direct vertebral <b>derotation</b> for selective posterior thoracic fusion in AIS.

30|$|Uterine torsion has a 12 % overall {{perinatal}} mortality rate [3] and needs urgent intervention. Uterine preservation is the aim in pregnancy. In early pregnancy, the uterus should be manually untwisted at laparotomy. At term, the torsion should be managed by manual <b>derotation</b> followed by delivery by caesarian section. If <b>derotation</b> is not possible, the fetus is first delivered by a transverse posterior hysterotomy followed by manual correction [9]. Predisposing factors should be looked for and corrected if possible. Plication of uterosacral ligaments has been described to keep the uterus anteverted and prevent recurrence [9]. In the presence of gangrene, hysterectomy remains the only option. Although most reports deal with torsion in pregnancy, few actually describe the treatment in women past the childbearing age. Here, the choice of treatment may be less conservative. Presence of a uterine pathology, like fibroid, justifies hysterectomy. Even in absence of any apparent cause, we strongly believe in its removal rather than <b>derotation</b> and fixation, since the organ has no function in the elderly and preservation may invite recurrence. A subtotal hysterectomy has been advocated [10] in the emergency situation, when excision is done through the elongated isthmus, as the procedure is simple, rapid, less hemorrhagic, and more aseptic.|$|E

Abstract—The {{correction}} of torsional deformities with the Ilizarov apparatus is accompanied by rotational and trans-lational displacement, which affects the biomechanics of the bone fragments. Understanding the biomechanical factors will assist in designing the optimal treatment strategy and mechanical properties of the fixator, thus shortening the duration of treatment and improving the outcomes. In {{order to determine the}} impact of different types of derotators on the kinematics of bone fragments in Ilizarov apparatus, physical models were studied. Translational and derotational displacement was measured using non-contact method (Optotrak Certus Motion Capture System). The results of the studies conducted on physical models have shown that regardless of the type of the derotator, the divergence between the applied angle of <b>derotation</b> and the obtained angle of rotation relative to fragments needs to be taken into account. Transverse displacement of fragments occur by 3. 5 mm to approximately 9 mm, depending on the angle of <b>derotation.</b> For correction of rotational deformities up to 30, it is advisable to use the type Z derotators because of its higher accuracy of <b>derotation.</b> Different types of derotators can affect the biomechanical conditions in the regenerating bone tissue through different kinematics characteristics.

Scoliosis Cobb angles and apical vertebral rotations in standing, supine and fulcrum bending positions before surgery, and in supine position after surgery, were measured on x-rays and CT scans. They were compared using paired t-test. RESULTS: Eighteen patients were included. The mean age at surgery was 15. 5 yr. The Cobb angles and apical vertebral rotations in standing, supine and fulcrum bending positions before surgery and in supine position after surgery were 54 °, 26 °; 40 °, 19 °; 17 °, 10 °; and 14 °, 8 ° respectively. The differences in Cobb angles and apical vertebral rotation between standing, supine and fulcrum bending positions were statistically significant. The differences in Cobb angle and apical vertebral rotation between fulcrum bending position and postoperation were statistically insignificant. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that spontaneous apical <b>derotation</b> occurred concomittently with correction of the coronal deformity. The amount of vertebral <b>derotation</b> achievable under fulcrum bending may predict the post-operative vertebral rotation correction. Apical rotation was corrected by 27 % on supine and 62 % on fulcrum bending positions. Such spontaneous <b>derotation</b> effect should be considered when assessing the effects with different implants and surgical strategies.
