He gave me the cast album of Into the Woods, and I became obsessed with it. I remember going to my final exam in the spring of '89.

The bird was still breathing, though it barely stirred as I picked it up from the ground. I cupped it {{in my hands and}} walked over to sit down {{in the shade of a}} large tree. I was struck by the senselessness of a tiny bird falling victim to our built environment. After a few minutes, the bird opened its eyes. Ten minutes later it was able to perch on my index finger. After half an hour it was actively looking around. It gave me a final look, then zoomed up to perch in the top of the tree. The bird was gone, but it seemed to have left me with a message, and perhaps a calling.

40|$|As a new {{hurricane}} season opened in June of 2006, it emerged {{that a number}} of online gaming sites were offering bettors the opportunity to wager on whether New Orleans might suffer another Katrina calamity. Commentators condemned the announced practice with howls of disgust, labeling it both tasteless and heartless. Perhaps they were right. All <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> as one who grew up in New Orleans, however, was how risk pools might hereby be broadened to include all the world’s bettors. We shouldn’t condemn these people; we should use them—while requiring that they maintain margin accounts at their betting sites. For to bet on an event’s happening is a way to insure against it, and there are currently more things we’re able to bet on than to purchase ordinary insurance policies against. This essay elaborates and draws consequences from that observation. In a manner I hope is more concretely appreciable and intuitively graspable than in more technical work I did some years back, I work to show that we have it within our power to spread risks both more justly and more efficiently than we do now—in effect by designing new hedging instruments suitable for “ordinary Janes and Joes. ” In this sense the essay amounts to a contribution to the project of “democratizing” finance. Working along such lines now seems particularly worthwhile, as more and more people below the tops of our income and wealth distributions face more and more uninsurable risks—both to labor incomes and to that one form of wealth which they hold when they hold anything more than mere “human capital”—their homes...|$|R

Two years after his parole, Gaskins was arrested for the rape of a twelve-year-old girl, but he absconded while awaiting sentence. He was rearrested in Georgia and sentenced to eight years of imprisonment. Gaskins was paroled in November 1968.Upon his release, Gaskins moved {{to the town of}} Sumter and began work with Fort Roofing company. His first non-prison-related murder victim was a hitchhiker whom he tortured and murdered in September 1969, before sinking her body in a swamp. In his memoirs, he wrote: [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> is how <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do anything <b>I</b> wanted to her." [...] This hitchhiker was to be the first of many he picked up and killed while driving around the coastal highways of the American South.

He tortured and mutilated his victims, while attempting to keep them alive for as long as possible. He confessed to killing these victims using a variety of methods including stabbing, suffocation, mutilation, and even claimed to have cannibalized some of them. He later confessed to killing [...] "eighty to ninety" [...] such victims, although his claims to have committed any [...] "coastal kills" [...] have never been corroborated.

30|$|The InTeGrate project {{challenges}} {{instructors to}} situate {{the design of}} course materials first within their own classrooms, and then secondly within the classrooms of their collaborators and others who may use the materials. This authentic and practical application {{may help explain why}} the pedagogical change shown in the qualitative and quantitative data focused on items and questions influenced by situational factors. Participants’ responses to regularly scheduled written reflections completed throughout their development experience provide support for this interpretation. For example, Rachel stated that “Our course structures all being different has been challenging as we develop materials” and Linda (who worked with a different group of instructors), noted “Our different experiences in the classroom, and also teaching outside the classroom, helped us <b>think</b> <b>about</b> multiple experiences”. The value of thinking about the implementation of materials in different academic environments was also summarized in Beth’s reflection where she acknowledged that her collaborators “helped me see different types of assignments that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> write and ways <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> my own classroom and students”. She went on to discuss the value of thinking about applying teaching materials to different environments “I like that I was forced to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> how an exercise would work in a classroom different from my own with students that were also different”. Mandy reflected that her group had to struggle and adapt to “disparate approaches to assessment in our classes due to class size, student populations, etc”. Developing materials for a diverse audience can also be beneficial after instructors {{have had the opportunity to}} pilot their activities in their classrooms. For example, Amy expressed the view that “I liked classroom testing, that this was done in three different institutions, and the results shared, and how this sparked revisions…” The diverse application of teaching strategies required by participants in the InTeGrate project may better equip instructors with the pedagogical content knowledge and experience necessary to overcome situational barriers. Additionally, information and experiences gained from the piloting of their new materials were readily transferred within each team because group members all had similar teaching backgrounds.|$|R
