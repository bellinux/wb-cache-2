5|$|Wulfstan wrote some {{works in}} Latin, and {{numerous}} works in Old English, then the vernacular. He {{has also been}} credited with a few short poems. His works can <b>generally</b> <b>be</b> divided into homiletic, legal, and philosophical categories.|$|E
5|$|A {{critical}} {{issue is how}} to design protected areas for amphibians which will provide suitable conditions for their survival. Conservation efforts {{through the use of}} protected areas have shown to <b>generally</b> <b>be</b> a temporary solution to population decline and extinction because the amphibians become inbred. It is crucial for most amphibians to maintain a high level of genetic variation through large and more diverse environments.|$|E

5|$|A.viridimontanum is {{difficult}} to distinguish from its parent species in the field. It can <b>generally</b> <b>be</b> separated from A.pedatum by {{the shape of the}} ultimate segments (the smallest divisions of the leaf), and by its habitat on thin, exposed serpentine soils rather than in rich woodlands. It more closely resembles A.aleuticum; however, the stalks of the ultimate segments and the false indusia are longer and the spores larger.|$|E
5|$|Coastal {{areas of}} Wales, and those near rivers, produce many {{different}} forms of fish and shellfish. Traditional fishing methods, such as wade netting for salmon, remained in place for 2,000 years. Welsh coracles, simple boats made of a willow frame and covered in animal hides, were noted by Romans and were still in use in the 20th century. Once landed, fish would <b>generally</b> <b>be</b> wind-dried and smoked, or cured with salt.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to produce a plasma that is not quasineutral. An electron beam, for example, has only negative charges. The density of a non-neutral plasma must <b>generally</b> <b>be</b> very low, or it must be very small, otherwise it will be dissipated by the repulsive electrostatic force.|$|E
50|$|Flowers with diurnal {{anthesis}} <b>generally</b> <b>are</b> {{brightly colored}} {{in order to}} attract diurnal insects, such as butterflies.Flowers with nocturnal anthesis <b>generally</b> <b>are</b> white or less colorful, and as such, they contrast more strongly with the night. These flowers typically attract nocturnal insects including many moth species.|$|R

5|$|Solar {{thermal power}} plants can <b>generally</b> <b>be</b> {{built in a}} few years because solar plants are built almost entirely with modular, readily {{available}} materials. In contrast, many types of conventional power projects, especially coal and nuclear plants, require long lead times.|$|E
5|$|The curve-billed thrasher can <b>{{generally}}</b> <b>be</b> found running rapidly from {{cover to}} cover or flying near ground level from bush to bush. However, this bird is not shy about being in the open. It is generally a forager on ground level but can be very aggressive in routing out potential competitors for food at feeders, such as the Inca dove and round-tailed ground squirrel. It will usually destroy any nest of cactus wrens.|$|E
5|$|After the First Crusade, Crusaders who did {{not return}} to their homes in Europe helped found the Crusader states of the Principality of Antioch, the County of Edessa, the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and the County of Tripoli. The castles they founded to secure their {{acquisitions}} were designed mostly by Syrian master-masons. Their design was very similar to that of a Roman fort or Byzantine tetrapyrgia which were square in plan and had square towers at each corner that did not project much beyond the curtain wall. The keep of these Crusader castles would have had a square plan and <b>generally</b> <b>be</b> undecorated.|$|E

5|$|Concurrent {{programming}} languages, libraries, APIs, {{and parallel}} programming models (such as algorithmic skeletons) {{have been created}} for programming parallel computers. These can <b>generally</b> <b>be</b> divided into classes based on the assumptions they make about the underlying memory architectureâ€”shared memory, distributed memory, or shared distributed memory. Shared memory programming languages communicate by manipulating shared memory variables. Distributed memory uses message passing. POSIX Threads and OpenMP {{are two of the}} most widely used shared memory APIs, whereas Message Passing Interface (MPI) is the most widely used message-passing system API. One concept used in programming parallel programs is the future concept, where one part of a program promises to deliver a required datum to another part of a program at some future time.|$|E
5|$|During the day, {{the solitary}} tasselled {{wobbegong}} can <b>generally</b> <b>be</b> found lying inside caves or under ledges with its tail curled. Individual sharks tend to remain within a local area and have favored resting spots. While resting, it opportunistically ambushes nearby fishes and invertebrates, and also lures in prey by waving its tail {{to mimic the}} appearance of a small fish. At night, it emerges and actively forages for food. This species is aplacental viviparous, though little is known of its life history. The tasselled wobbegong has been reported to bite and kill humans unprovoked; attacks may result from people accidentally disturbing the shark or being misperceived as prey. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Near Threatened, as outside of Australia it is threatened by fisheries and habitat degradation.|$|E
5|$|During {{the tour}} matches, which were usually played {{consecutively}} {{with only one}} or no days between fixtures, Bradman rotated the trio of openers, so one would <b>generally</b> <b>be</b> rested while the other two opened,N- but in the Tests, Morris and Barnes were preferred. Bradman accommodated Brown in his first-choice team by playing him out of position in the middle order {{in the first two}} Tests and against Worcestershire and the MCC, when he fielded the strongest XI. However, Brown appeared uncomfortable in the unfamiliar role, and after making 73 runs at 24.33 in the first two Tests, he was dropped.|$|E

5|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} {{poisoning}} include carbon monoxide detectors, proper venting of gas appliances, keeping chimneys clean, and keeping exhaust systems of vehicles in good repair. Treatment of poisoning generally consists of giving 100% oxygen along with supportive care. This should <b>generally</b> <b>be</b> carried out until symptoms {{are no longer}} present and the HbCO level is less than 10%. While hyperbaric oxygen therapy is used for severe poisonings, the benefit over standard oxygen delivery is unclear. The risk of death among those affected is between 1 and 30%.|$|E
5|$|In a {{volcanic}} eruption, lava, tephra (volcanic bombs, lapilli, and ash), and various gases are expelled from {{a volcanic}} vent or fissure. While many eruptions only pose dangers to the immediately surrounding area, Earth's largest eruptions {{can have a}} major regional or even global impact, with some affecting the climate and contributing to mass extinctions. Volcanic eruptions can <b>generally</b> <b>be</b> characterized as either explosive eruptions, sudden ejections of rock and ash, or effusive eruptions, relatively gentle outpourings of lava. A separate list is given below for each type.|$|E
5|$|Of the 71 {{words in}} this list, 67 are nouns, and most would <b>generally</b> <b>be</b> {{considered}} loanwords; the only modern-English words that contain Q not followed by U {{and are not}} borrowed from another language are qiana, qwerty, and tranq. However, all of the loanwords on this list {{are considered to be}} naturalised in English according to at least one major dictionary (see References), often because they refer to concepts or societal roles that do not have an accurate equivalent in English. For words to appear here, they must appear in their own entry in a dictionary; words which occur only as part of a longer phrase are not included.|$|E

5|$|South Dakota can <b>generally</b> <b>be</b> {{divided into}} three regions: eastern South Dakota, western South Dakota, and the Black Hills. The Missouri River serves as a {{boundary}} in terms of geographic, social, and political differences between eastern and western South Dakota. The geography of the Black Hills, long considered sacred by Native Americans, differs from its surroundings {{to such an extent}} it can be considered separate from the rest of western South Dakota. At times the Black Hills are combined with the rest of western South Dakota, and people often refer to the resulting two regions divided by the Missouri River as West River and East River.|$|E
5|$|South Dakota {{is a state}} {{located in}} the north-central United States. It is usually {{considered}} {{to be in the}} Midwestern region of the country. The state can <b>generally</b> <b>be</b> divided into three geographic regions: eastern South Dakota, western South Dakota, and the Black Hills. Eastern South Dakota is lower in elevation and higher in precipitation than {{the western part of the}} state, and the Black Hills are a low, isolated mountain group in the southwestern corner of the state. Smaller sub-regions in the state include the Coteau des Prairies, Coteau du Missouri, James River Valley, the Dissected Till Plains, and the Badlands. Geologic formations in South Dakota range in age from two billion-year-old Precambrian granite in the Black Hills to glacial till deposited over the last few million years. South Dakota is the 17th-largest state in the country.|$|E
5|$|Stock ducks {{would be}} chosen from ducklings hatched in March, with a typical breeder keeping six males and twenty laying females {{at any given}} time. The females would be kept for around a year before mating, {{typically}} to an older male. They would then <b>generally</b> <b>be</b> replaced, to reduce the problems of inbreeding. Stock ducks were allowed to roam freely during the day, and would swim in local ponds which, although privately owned, were treated as common property among the duck breeders; breeders would label their ducks with markings on the neck or head. The stock ducks would forage for greenery and insects, supplemented by greaves (the residue left after the rendering of animal fat). As ducks lay their eggs at night, the ducks would be brought indoors overnight.|$|E
