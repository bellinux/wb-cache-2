He supported most aspects of the foreign policy of the Reagan administration, including its hardline stance against the Soviet Union and policy towards Central American conflicts, such as backing the Contras in Nicaragua.

500|$|Rilke {{depicted}} this infinite, transcendental beauty {{with the}} symbol of angels. However, he {{did not use the}} traditional Christian interpretation of angels. [...] He sought to utilize a symbol of the angel that was secular, divorced from religious doctrine and embodied a tremendous transcendental beauty. [...] In this, however, Rilke commented that he was greatly influenced by the depiction of angels found in Islam. For Rilke, {{the symbol of}} the angel represents a perfection that is [...] "beyond human contradictions and limitations" [...] in a [...] "higher level of reality in the invisible." [...] Where there is incongruity that adds to mankind's despair and anxiety is due to [...] human nature <b>keeping</b> <b>us</b> clinging to the visible and the familiar.

500|$|Upon being {{approached}} by the BBC {{to develop a}} new police procedural drama, Jordan explained that he was conflicted between emulating the former BBC police drama Dixon of Dock Green, using [...] "a set of flawless characters roaming the streets dispensing justice and words of wisdom", or creating a more modern drama, developing characters who would [...] "snort a line of coke, beat up the missus on the way out and shag each other in the locker rooms". Jordan went on to research his new project by spending time with first serving officers, who [...] "portrayed a world of endless, statistic-led red tape". After spending time with first serving officers, Jordan concluded that he was left with an image [...] "not of a modern-day police force, fighting crime on the streets and <b>keeping</b> <b>us</b> all safe, but some kind of unwieldy, top-heavy administrative process, more concerned with public opinion than dispensing justice." ...|$|E

500|$|Adnan Riaz of Hardcore Gamer said Episode 3: Chaos Theory was a {{dramatic}} improvement that presented a [...] "thrilling, poignant, fascinating and... enticing" [...] narrative whose outcome from past decisions also added a sense of realism. Peter Paras of Game Revolution complimented the character beats, particularly the development of Chloe Price, who he said [...] "really comes into her own as [...] fully-formed character". Though GameSpots Alexa Ray Corriea said that the fetch quests interfered with its emotional quality, the episode built up to a [...] "killer cliffhanger" [...] according to Farokhmanesh. GameZones Matt Liebl said Episode 4: Dark Room was [...] "easily the most emotional episode" [...] and that the mystery of Rachel Amber had done a [...] "tremendous job in <b>keeping</b> <b>us</b> hooked". Tom Hoggins of The Telegraph said the developer's venture into subjects like social division, online bullying, parental conflict and suicide as [...] "bold". Critics said there were tonal problems, caused by the game's [...] "cheap ways" [...] of progressing the plot, such as character inconsistency and superfluous shocks. Critics were more favorable towards the episode's puzzles and relationships. They said the final episode, Polarized, had a [...] "fitting conclusion" [...] to the coming of age story of Max Caulfield {{and the relationship between}} the two leads was carried out successfully. One stealth sequence was described as [...] "tedious" [...] and [...] "out-of-place" [...] while other aspects inhabiting the same course of events were favoured. Reviewers were essentially divided on the ending, citing the episode's subtitle as something that mirrored their own feelings toward it.|$|E

500|$|... "And Then There Were Fewer" [...] {{received}} widespread acclaim from {{critics and}} viewers, with one critic calling the storyline [...] "solidly funny, well-plotted, and nearly perfectly executed".

Natalie Zutter of Ology also praised the episode, calling it, [...] "Surprisingly, {{the best of the}} evening." [...] In the summary of her review, Zutter wrote that it was a [...] "fun murder mystery that lets us see all our favorite Quahog folks", while continuing to wonder whether the characters who were killed off would remain dead.|$|E

[...] Obama did later note that the HB2162 modification had stipulated that the law not be applied in a discriminatory fashion, but the president said there was still the possibility of suspected illegal immigrants [...] "being harassed and arrested".
