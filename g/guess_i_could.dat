500|$|Imperial Bedrooms {{opens with}} an {{acknowledgement}} from Clay, the main character, {{that both the}} Less Than Zero novel and its film adaption are actual representational works within the narrative of his life: [...] "The movie {{was based on a}} book by someone we knew... It was labeled fiction but only a few details had been altered and our names weren't changed and there was nothing in it that hadn't happened." [...] The Los Angeles Times described this as a [...] "nifty little trick", as it allows Ellis to establish the newer book [...] "as the primary narrative, one that trumps Ellis as author and the real world." [...] The San Francisco Chronicle calls it a [...] "neat trick of authorial self-abnegation". Another reviewer describes it as Ellis at [...] "his most ambitious", a [...] "Philip Rothian, doppelgänger gambit", making his new narrator [...] "the real Clay" [...] and the other an imposter. This allows Ellis to skilfully, [...] "with writerly jujitsu", acknowledge Robert Downey Jr.'s popular performance as Julian in the moralistic 1987 film, in which he died; Ellis appreciates the adaptation as a [...] "milestone in a lot of ways". The device also allows the novelist to insert self-critique; The Sunday Times reviewer notes that Imperial Bedrooms finds its characters [...] "still a little sore at their depiction as inarticulate zombies". John Crace, in his [...] "digested read" [...] of Imperial Bedrooms, insinuates through parody that [...] "the author" [...] of the metafictional Less Than Zero is also meant to be Ellis, describing him in Clay's voice as [...] "too immersed in the passivity of writing and too pleased with his own style to bother with many commas to admit it so he wrote me into the story as the man who was too frightened to love." [...] With regard to the opening narrative conceit, Ellis queries [...] "Is it complication ... or is it clarification?", opining that it certainly is the latter for Clay. Even though Ellis never names himself explicitly in the book, he conceded to Lawson that one can [...] "guess [...] is who the Clay of Imperial Bedrooms is referring to." [...] Ellis did, however, reveal that he had not decided when writing the novel whether Clay was referring to him or not. Eileen Battersby likened Bedrooms to Lunar Park (2005), cited his use of [...] "self-consciousness as a device." [...] This device was picked up on by several other critics—in particular, Vice noted that [...] "the scatological violence of American Psycho" [...] and [...] "the otherworldly terror of Lunar Park" [...] had here been combined. Ellis himself raised the [...] "sequel" [...] question, commenting [...] "...I don't think it is [...] Well, I mean, it is and it isn't. It's narrated by him, sure. But I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> maybe have switched the names around and it could stand alone." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 13, 2009, Charles Pratt, Jr., head {{writer of}} the series, was interviewed by TV Guide about the Reese and Bianca relationship. After saying {{he felt he had}} longer to tell the love story and {{that it could have been}} better told if not for Riegel {{temporarily}} departing as Bianca, Pratt was viewed by fans and critics as blaming Riegel for the failure of the storyline. [...] "I was led to believe we had her for longer than we really did — suddenly I got word that Eden is leaving now," [...] stated Pratt. [...] "We got to play everything we wanted to with Bianca and Reese but not in the time we’d hoped for — in my mind, it was a two-year story. I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have rushed to the wedding earlier so that they’d have had more time together as a married couple and then had them break up, but I think the fans would have been even more unsatisfied with that." ...|$|E

60|$|You see, {{it was an}} {{endurance}} test, and no man {{likes to}} give another best. Faugh! it was steam beer. I had learned more expensive brews. Not for years had I drunk steam beer; but when I had, I had drunk with men, and <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> show these youngsters some ability in beer-guzzling. And the drinking began, and I had to drink {{with the best of}} them. Some of them might lag, but the guest of honour was not permitted to lag.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, to be short, the groaning chap was taken, and my man left. I was mad, {{but there}} was no time for talk, and the selfish one went off and left that poor feller to run his one chance. I had my rifle, and <b>guessed</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hobble up to use it if need be; so we settled back to wait without much hope of help, {{everything}} being in a muddle. And wait we did till morning, for that ambulance did not come back till next day, when most of us were past needing it.|$|R
6000|$|... "At the end {{she said}} we must {{advertise}} for the picture. I said it would kill Blakey if he saw it; and she said: No matter, let it kill him; it would show him that we valued his gift, and were moving heaven and earth to find it; and, at any rate, it would kill me if I kept myself in suspense. I said I should not care for that; but with her sympathy <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> live through the night, and I was sure I should find the thing at the Milk Street office in the morning.|$|R
6000|$|The American laughed. [...] "If I didn't, I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> learn. It can't {{be harder}} than playing the fiddle, and I've worried into that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{hear myself}} a mile away," [...] the trooper said. [...] "Still, that horse of yours is making row {{enough for a}} squadron." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "There!" [...] Darius said triumphantly. [...] "You {{can see how}} near Joshua Barney {{comes to}} the truth when he makes a <b>guess!</b> <b>I</b> believe he <b>could</b> stay at Nottingham without ever gettin' a report from anybody, an' tell just what the enemy was doin'." ...|$|R
2500|$|After comedian {{and actress}} Ellen DeGeneres {{came out as}} a lesbian, Falwell {{referred}} {{to her in a}} sermon as [...] "Ellen DeGenerate". DeGeneres mocked him, saying, [...] "Really, he called me that? Ellen DeGenerate? I've been getting that since the fourth grade. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> I'm happy <b>I</b> <b>could</b> give him work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've had an {{interesting}} talk with Mr. Weston," [...] he said indifferently. [...] "That's quite a smart young man, but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> one <b>could</b> call him a little obstinate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> if I wasn't {{afraid of}} uncle. He knows {{so much more}} than I do, he'd laugh," [...] began Geordie, evidently puzzled by the question.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> find him," [...] said Carl {{in a low}} voice. [...] "You go out to Mother Kruger's. I'll {{tell him}} you'll be there in about an hour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There isn't much choice. The {{place is}} full," [...] said Jerry. [...] "I'D like that corner near the road, I <b>guess.</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hear the teams going {{past and the}} people talking." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I presume," [...] {{the mother}} interrupted, [...] "that {{she would be}} {{self-supporting}} {{by the time she}} had taken six months' lessons, and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> she <b>could</b> get along till then." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Everybody talking Chinook, not <b>guessing</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> spit {{it better}} than most; and principally two girls who'd run away from Haine's Mission up the Lynn Canal. They were trim creatures, good to the eye, and I kind of thought of casting that way; but they were fresh as fresh-caught cod. Too much edge, you see. Being a new-comer, they started to twist me, not knowing I {{gathered}} in every word of Chinook they uttered.|$|R
2500|$|Gibson {{described}} his character Guy, saying, “He's not a silver-tongued devil. He's kind of immature {{and he has}} some rough edges and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> you <b>could</b> say the same for me.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{go up to}} the Armenian with you, perhaps. When {{would you}} like to go? You know I've always got lots of dates but I--um--let's see, I think I could go to-morrow evening." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would have}} shied rocks at them," [...] said Tommy, {{who had come}} down from the tree. [...] "They may be bigger than I am, but I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> outrun 'em," [...] and at this remark the others had to smile.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{brings me}} to something, Cynthia," [...] said Jeff, [...] "and I don't want you to say {{anything}} till I've got through. I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> help mother run the place as well as Jackson, and I could stay here next winter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Huh! <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> we <b>could</b> {{find our}} way out sooner or later," [...] {{retorted}} his twin. To Andy, getting lost in the woods would seem {{nothing more than a}} big joke.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is {{there no}} one else who could do that?" [...] Acton asked. [...] "It seems to me there's {{nothing wrong with that}} man Gordon. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> you <b>could</b> leave it to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wish you {{was in the}} House," [...] remarked Mr. Adams of Barren. [...] "None of us is much on talk, but if we had you, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> we <b>could</b> lay things wide open." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, here we are!" [...] he exclaimed, as {{he pulled}} off his gauntlets. [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get along with {{something}} to eat. How about you? They treat you as well here as any place I know of in New England." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, well, I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do that, too, if I had to," [...] {{answered}} the youngest Rover boy quickly. [...] "But the roads {{from here to}} Chicago are pretty good, they tell me, so I don't think we'd have many punctures or blow-outs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd love to, and I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> I can mend gloves; Merry taught me, so I'd better {{begin on}} them, {{if you have}} any," [...] said Molly, much pleased at {{being able to do}} {{anything}} for her father, and still more so at being asked.|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, he was sore!" [...] {{she told}} Janet the next morning, {{relating}} the incident with relish, [...] "for two cents {{he would have}} knocked Charlie over the ropes. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> he <b>could</b> do it, too, all right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Tommy!" [...] said Celia, {{with her}} {{broadest}} smile. [...] "Won't that be enough? I got Betty {{to show me}} how to make a cottage pudding. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> we <b>could</b> call it a flat pudding if we wanted to." ...|$|R
5000|$|McBride states: I'm {{proud of}} my Jewish history....Technically <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> you <b>could</b> say I'm Jewish since my mother was Jewish...but she {{converted}} (to Christianity).

6000|$|... "I've been partly expecting this," [...] he observed. [...] "It's {{quite clear}} that {{one or two of}} the big land {{exploitation}} people have a hand in the thing. I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> put my finger right down on them. You said the man's name was Hames?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Jimmy {{looked at}} him with sudden concern in his face. [...] "Then I'll be good and lonely to-night," [...] he said. [...] "Say, do you think I could take out the fiddle now and then to keep me company? I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> play it, like a banjo, with my fingers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{see what}} you mean, but in some respects she's much older. In fact, I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> give you {{a year or two}} myself. But it seems to me you've kind of wilted since we began to talk. You've gone slack and your eyes look heavy. Say, I'm sorry if I've made you tired." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not one. Any way, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> they <b>could</b> hardly do {{it without}} the consent of the trustees. You and I are not likely to give ours." [...] He paused for a moment. [...] "Well," [...] he added, [...] "I guess Waynefleet could be {{depended}} on." ...|$|R
5000|$|During {{the third}} show I {{was given the}} sign, {{which of course is}} the fingers across the throat, which in show {{business}} means you better finish. We were very swiftly evacuated by Iroquois helicopters. We could see the jungle where the battle was well and truly taking place and I remember that instinctive... that feeling of - this is very bad; this is dangerous. This {{is going to be a}} sad night, and indeed it was. You know, 17-year-old thoughts and through 17-year-old eyes, <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see thousands and thousands of orange lights, which of course was the gunfire, and I'll never forget it.

500|$|An {{interviewer}} {{concluded that}} Howarth was physically attractive {{and that this}} {{may have contributed to}} the character's magnetism. Howarth replied, [...] "I know what the convention of a good-looking person is, and I know that for some reason skinny white guys are big now. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> you <b>could</b> blame it on that." ...|$|R
