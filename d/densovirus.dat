50|$|Sea star wasting {{disease or}} starfish wasting {{syndrome}} {{is a disease}} of starfish and several other echinoderms that appears sporadically, causing mass mortality of affected starfish. There are around 40 different species of sea stars that {{have been affected by}} this disease. The disease seems to be associated with raised water temperatures. It starts with the emergence of lesions, followed by body fragmentation and death.

40|$|Mosquito <b>densoviruses</b> (DNVs) are {{candidate}} {{agents for}} paratransgenic control of malaria and other vector-borne diseases. Unlike other mosquito DNVs, the Anopheles gambiae DNV (AgDNV) is non-pathogenic to larval mosquitoes.

Using life table analysis, we show that AgDNV infection has minimal effects on An. gambiae survival (no significant effect in 2 replicates and a slight 2 day survival decrease in the third replicate). Using microarrays, we show that AgDNV has very minimal effect on the adult mosquito transcriptome, with only 4 – 15 genes differentially regulated depending on the statistical criteria imposed. The minimal impact upon global transcription provides some mechanistic understanding of lack of virus pathogenicity, suggesting a long co-evolutionary history that has shifted towards avirulence.

Similar to NS 1, the hybrid NS 1 –GFP localized in the nucleus predominantly in a punctate pattern. Transducing virus particles carrying the NS 1 –GFP gene infected mosquito larvae. Expression of GFP was detected as early as 48 h postinfection and in larval and pupal stages. Midgut, hindgut, and Malpighian tubule cells expressed GFP soon after transduction.

40|$|Age is a {{critical}} determinant of the ability of most arthropod vectors to transmit a range of human pathogens. This {{is due to the}} fact that most pathogens require a period of extrinsic incubation in the arthropod host before pathogen transmission can occur. This developmental period for the pathogen often comprises a significant proportion of the expected lifespan of the vector. As such, only a small proportion of the population that is oldest contributes to pathogen transmission. Given this, strategies that target vector age would be expected to obtain the most significant reductions in the capacity of a vector population to transmit disease. The recent identification of biological agents that shorten vector lifespan, such as Wolbachia, entomopathogenic fungi and <b>densoviruses,</b> offer new tools for the control of vector-borne diseases. Evaluation of the efficacy of these strategies under field conditions will be possible due to recent advances in insect age-grading techniques.

Results: Phylogenetic analysis showed that HaDV 2 was similar {{to members of the}} genus Iteradensovirus. However, compared to current members of the genus Iteradensovirus, the sequence identity of HaDV 2 is less than 44 % at the nucleotide-level, and lower than 36, 28 and 19 % at the amino-acid-level of VP, NS 1 and NS 2 proteins, respectively. Moreover, NS 1 and NS 2 proteins from HaDV 2 were smaller than those from other iteradensoviruses due to their shorter N-terminal sequences. Two transcripts of about 2. 2 kb coding for the NS proteins and the VP proteins were identified by Northern Blot and RACE analysis. Using specific anti-NS 1 and anti-NS 2 antibodies, Western Blot analysis revealed a 78 kDa and a 48 kDa protein, respectively. Finally, the localization of both NS 1 and NS 2 proteins within the cell nucleus was determined by using Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) labelling.

40|$|Abstract. Following per oral {{infection}} of Aedes aegypti larvae with Aedes albopictus parvovirus (AaPV), infected {{males and females}} adults were tested {{for their ability to}} transmit the virus venereally and vertically, respectively. Both types of transmission were observed. A low percentage (2. 2 %) of AaPV-free females were found contaminated by the virus after mating with AaPV-infected males. Although no significant difference was observed in the fecundity of orally infected and virus-free females, 17. 1 % of infected ones died before egg laying, whereas no mortality occurred during the same period in virus-free females. There was a clear relationship between the virus titer in the orally infected females and both mortality and infection in their offspring. The virus titer averaged IO 6250 % tissue culture infective doses (TCID 50 s) in F, females and 10 " TCID 50 in F, females. Nevertheless, AaPV did not persist in an experimentally infected population of mosquitoes beyond the second generation. <b>Densoviruses</b> have been isolated from several species of insects, mainly Lepidoptera, and most of them cause lethal diseases in their hosts and are pathogenic only for inverte brates.

Since densonucleosis virus persistently infects mosquito populations, and is demonstrated to negatively affect multiplication of dengue virus in Aedes albopictus, {{it would be interesting}} to study if this virus has a role in determining the susceptibility of the vector mosquito Ae. aegypti to chikugunya virus. Methods Mosquito cell lines and adult Ae. aegypti mosquitoes infected with <b>densovirus</b> were superinfected with Chikungunya virus and both the viruses were quantitated by determining their genomic copy number by real time amplification. Comparison was made between the log of genomic copy numbers of the viruses in the presence and absence of each other. Results The log of copy number of the viruses did not vary due to co-infection. Even though the RNA copy number of chikungunya virus increased over the period of time, no change was observed in the RNA copy number between the control and the co-infected group on any given day.
