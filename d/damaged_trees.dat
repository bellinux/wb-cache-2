5|$|Heavy {{damage was}} {{reported}} in Jamaica. Upon making landfall in Florida, the hurricane produced a 7ft (2m) storm tide, and in Georgia, hurricane-force winds extended into the southwestern portion of the state, while tropical storm force winds occurred along the coastline.

5|$|In Massachusetts, the {{hurricane}} moved from Connecticut through the Springfield area. There {{was a small}} F1 tornado in Middlesex County that <b>damaged</b> <b>trees.</b> High winds knocked over thousands of trees, and about 500,000 people statewide lost power. Heavy rainfall caused stream flooding, although the heaviest damage was from the winds. The hurricane destroyed a radio tower in Framingham and damaged hundreds of homes in the eastern portion of the state. Along the coast, the storm tide caused minor coastal flooding and damaged hundreds of boats. Across Massachusetts, damage was estimated at $61 million, including $6 million from crop damage.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{relatively}} weak nature of the storm, impact was generally minor. Rip currents in Alabama and Florida led to five fatalities. The sixth death from the storm was also related to rough seas and occurred {{near the mouth of}} the Mississippi River in Louisiana. Storm surge and high tides also caused coastal flooding in the state, especially in Cameron Parish. Relatively strong winds left more than 2,000without electricity and <b>damaged</b> <b>trees</b> and the roofs of mobile homes. Storm surge caused coastal flooding in eastern Texas, particularly in the Gilchrist area. At least 25homes sustained damage, while portions of a few major roads, such as Interstate 10, were closed. Minor inland flooding occurred due to heavy rainfall, with a portion of Texas State Highway 36 being temporarily shutdown. Strong winds in the region damaged hundreds of homes, downed trees, and left about 300,000people without electricity. Overall, damage from Tropical Storm Edouard totaled slightly more than $550,000 (2008USD).|$|E
5|$|Less severe {{property}} damage was recorded {{west of the}} storm's track into St. Margarets Bay and Mahone Bay. In addition to Halifax Regional Municipality's urban core, the town of Truro and all of rural Colchester County {{as well as the}} western part of Pictou County experienced {{property damage}} and power outages from falling trees; numerous barns and other agricultural buildings were damaged east of the storm's path, including a replica of the Hector in Pictou Harbour. The severity of property damage in the metropolitan areas of Halifax and Dartmouth of Halifax Regional Municipality initially led some forecasters to believe that Juan was likely a Category3 hurricane; however, the sustained wind reports did not justify that suggestion. Many of the deciduous trees in central Nova Scotia still had leaves, which magnified the effects of wind damage. Overall, the number of <b>damaged</b> <b>trees</b> was estimated to be in the millions.|$|E

Furthermore, tree core samples dated the damage to 1965. This provided physical evidence that something airborne may have come crashing through the trees and landed in the woods.

Continuing north, downtown Greensburg was completely devastated by the tornado, with numerous businesses destroyed. Two schools, a tractor supply company, the Greensburg City Hall and other businesses fell victim to the violent winds and were destroyed or flattened. A motel {{on the west side of}} town was severely <b>damaged,</b> <b>trees</b> throughout the town were completely denuded and debarked, and vehicles were thrown hundreds of feet.

Train cars were also overturned and hazardous materials teams were called to inspect the wreckage. A tank car carrying about 14,000 gallons (53,000 liters) of ammonia started to leak when workers lifted it. The courthouse and the grain elevator were spared the worst of the tornado's effects. Meanwhile, the Greensburg meteorite, which was feared to have been blown away, was found and recovered a few days afterwards. Greensburg High School was mostly destroyed by the tornado, sustaining EF4 damage. Numerous homes were swept away across from the high school, four of which were well-bolted to their foundations, warranting an EF5 rating at those residences.
