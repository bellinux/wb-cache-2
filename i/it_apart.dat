5|$|Baseball {{has certain}} {{attributes}} that set <b>it</b> <b>apart</b> {{from the other}} popular team sports in the countries where it has a following. All of these sports use a clock; in all of them, play is less individual and more collective; and in none {{of them is the}} variation between playing fields nearly as substantial or important. The comparison between cricket and baseball demonstrates that many of baseball's distinctive elements are shared in various ways with its cousin sports.|$|E

After that first election, the parliament held its first session on 11 July 1979, electing Simone Veil MEP as its President.

5|$|Berkshire No. 7 is a {{wood and}} steel barge {{constructed}} in 1935. It is historically {{important as a}} transitional canal barge and {{as one of the}} few surviving wooden-hulled canal boats. It was used to transport bulk cargo, including shipping fertilizer, from Connecticut to Long Island Sound. It sank in 1974 along with the Elmer S. Dailey and the Priscilla Dailey in the harbor of Bridgeport, Connecticut on the west side of the Pequonnock River. The sunken vessel has deteriorated to the point that a salvage operation could result in breaking <b>it</b> <b>apart.</b> The Berkshire No. 7 was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 21, 1978.|$|E
5|$|The Kentish rebels had {{assembled}} a wide-ranging {{list of people}} whom they wanted the King to hand over for execution. It included national figures, such as John of Gaunt, Archbishop Sudbury and Hales; other {{key members of the}} royal council; officials, such as Belknap and Bampton who had intervened in Kent; and other hated members of the wider royal circle. When they reached the Marshalsea Prison in Southwark, they tore <b>it</b> <b>apart.</b> By now the Kent and Essex rebels had been joined by many rebellious Londoners. The Fleet and Newgate Prisons were attacked by the crowds, and the rebels also targeted houses belonging to Flemish immigrants.|$|E

There was no intervening version 5.0 or 6.0, and the jump to version 7.0 was purely a marketing decision, based on {{keeping up with}} the suite of products in Microsoft Office which were then at the same number. It also reflected the development effort required to develop the first full 32-bit application version, designed to work with the Windows 95 operating system, which set <b>it</b> <b>apart</b> from its competition at the time.|$|E
5|$|The schoolhouse {{was built}} in 1883, {{in the village of}} Chana, Illinois. Due to the {{elimination}} of the Chana School District, the school was abandoned by the 1960s. A restoration effort was undertaken in the late 1990s, ending with a move and refurbishment in 2002 and 2003. The building now stands in a public park along the Rock River in Oregon, Illinois. Its interior also features architectural elements which set <b>it</b> <b>apart</b> from the typical 19th-century schoolhouse. From a distance, the building is dominated by its bell tower.|$|E
5|$|While {{planning}} his revenge, however, Aloha's turn to {{face the}} fear of having his planet attacked comes. A hostile alien invader known as Captain Kabuki (voiced by Lorelei King) descends upon Little Muu and starts taking <b>it</b> <b>apart,</b> piece by piece, contrasting on what Aloha himself had once tried to do to Crater Planet in the first game. Aloha flees the onslaught in his space pod, and lands on an asteroid far away from Little Muu, where he calls for help from his sworn enemy, Universal City Hall. Once again, Robbit is dispatched to help, and manages to free the parts of Little Muu which Kabuki has taken, and ultimately faces Kabuki one-on-one in mortal combat. Robbit defeats Kabuki, resulting in the latter escaping.|$|E

5|$|A salient {{feature of}} Buddhist {{philosophy}} which sets <b>it</b> <b>apart</b> from Indian orthodoxy is {{the centrality of}} the doctrine of not-self (Pāli. anatta, Skt. anātman). The Buddha's not-self doctrine sees humans as an impermanent composite of five psychological and physical aspects instead of a single fixed self. In this sense, what is called ego or the self is merely a convenient fiction, an illusion that does not apply to anything real but to an erroneous {{way of looking at the}} ever changing stream of five interconnected aggregate factors. The relationship between these aggregates is said to be one of dependent-arising (pratītyasamutpāda). This means that all things, including mental events, arise co-dependently from a plurality of other causes and conditions. This seems to reject both causal determinist and epiphenomenalist conceptions of mind.|$|E
5|$|Built in 1837, the Acors Barns House is a two-and-one half story Greek Revival {{house with}} a gable roof and clapboarded exterior. The front facade {{of the house is}} five bays wide with 6-over-6 sash and the main {{entrance}} has a Greek Revival portico supported by fluted Doric columns from top step. The simple single-panel door is surrounded by sidelights. The corners of the building have simple pilasters and four chimneys rising from the top. The rear of the house has a one-story veranda with a shallow hipped roof that is supported by square columns with a simple balustrade. The veranda has large 6-over-9 sash windows that extend almost a full story. In 1975, the area surrounding the property has undergone significant change, but the house is surrounded by trees and shrubs and a wrought iron fence that helps set <b>it</b> <b>apart</b> from the neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|By May 2009 LCR {{had become}} {{insolvent}} {{and the government}} received agreement to use state aid to purchase the line and also to open it up to competition to allow other services to use <b>it</b> <b>apart</b> from Eurostar. LCR's hitherto wholly owned subsidiary, HS1 Ltd, thus became {{the property of the}} Secretary of State for Transport. On 12 October 2009 a proposal was announced to sell £16billion of state assets including HS1 Ltd in the following two years to cut UK public debt. The government announced on 5 November 2010 that a concession to operate the line for 30years had been sold for £2.1billion to a consortium of Canadian investors. Under the concession, HS1Ltd has the rights to sell access to track and to the four international stations (St Pancras, Stratford, Ebbsfleet and Ashford) on a commercial basis, under the scrutiny of the Office of Rail Regulation. At the end of 30years, ownership of the assets will revert to government.|$|E

5|$|Designed by Adrian D. Smith of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the Franklin Center, {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous and {{recognized}} buildings in Chicago. The building's form features setbacks at the 15th, 30th and 45th floors. Designed in the postmodern architectural style, it is a granite-clad steel-framed building resting on pile foundations. The structure is characterized by strong vertical lines, spiked roof pinnacles, granite cladding and setbacks. The granite is a deep red color at the base, but changes shade to rose-beige at the top. Above the 5th floor, the lighter rose-beige granite is protected by silk-screened aluminum panels. The building relies on Gothic detailing to showcase verticality. The building's verticality evokes images of 1920s buildings, and the sturdiness of the structure is reminiscent of the Chicago Board of Trade Building. In addition to its design, the building relies on its location at the farthest corner from the Willis Tower to set <b>it</b> <b>apart.</b>|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{ships are}} removed from the fleet by going through {{a process known as}} ship {{breaking}} or scrapping. Ship-owners and buyers negotiate scrap prices based on factors such as the ship's empty weight (called light ton displacement or LDT) and prices in the scrap metal market. In 1998, almost 700ships were scrapped in places like Alang, India and Chittagong, Bangladesh. This is often done by 'beaching' the ship on open sand, then cutting <b>it</b> <b>apart</b> by hand with gas torches, a dangerous operation that results in injuries and fatalities, as well as exposure to toxic materials such as asbestos, lead, and various chemicals. Half a million deadweight tons worth of bulk carriers were scrapped in 2004, accounting for 4.7% of the year's scrapping. That year, bulkers fetched particularly high scrap prices, between $340 and $350 per LDT.|$|E
5|$|In 721/2, {{the main}} {{phase of the}} Second Arab–Khazar War began on the Caucasus front. In the winter of this year, 30,000 Khazars {{launched}} an invasion of Armenia and inflicted a crushing defeat on {{the army of the}} local governor Mi'laq ibn Saffar al-Bahrani at Marj al-Hijara in February/March 722. In response, Caliph Yazid II (r. 720–724) sent al-Jarrah with 25,000 Syrian troops to Armenia, placing him in command of the Umayyad offensive against the Khazars. Al-Jarrah was swiftly successful in driving the Khazars back across the Caucasus, and fought his way north along the western coast of the Caspian Sea, recovering Derbent and advancing onto the Khazar capital of Balanjar. The Khazars tried to defend the city by ringing the citadel with a laager of wagons, but the Arabs broke <b>it</b> <b>apart</b> and stormed the city on 21 August 722 (or 723). Most of Balanjar's inhabitants were killed or enslaved, but a few managed to flee north. The Arabs also took the town of Wabandar, and even approached Samandar (near modern Kizlyar).|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} of Brazil, it was once {{considered}} probable that the Portuguese navigator Duarte Pacheco Pereira had made a voyage to the Brazilian coast in 1498. This belief has since been dismissed, however, {{and it is now}} thought that he voyaged to North America instead. There is more certain evidence that two Spaniards, Vicente Yáñez Pinzón and Diego de Lepe, traveled along the northern coast of Brazil between January and March 1500. Pinzón went from what is today Fortaleza (capital of the Brazilian state of Ceará) to the mouth of the Amazon River. There he encountered another Spanish expedition led by Lepe, which would reach as far as the Oyapock River in March. The reason Cabral is credited with having discovered Brazil, rather than the Spanish explorers, is because the visits by Pinzón and Lepe were cursory and had no lasting impact. Historians Capistrano de Abreu, Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen, Mário Barata and Hélio Vianna concur that the Spanish expeditions did not influence the development of what would become the only Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas—with a unique history, culture and society which sets <b>it</b> <b>apart</b> from the Hispanic-American societies which dominate the rest of the continent.|$|E
5|$|In 721/722, {{the main}} {{phase of the}} war began. In the winter of this year, 30,000 Khazars {{launched}} an invasion of Armenia and inflicted a crushing defeat on the mostly Syrian army of the local governor Mi'laq ibn Saffar al-Bahrani at Marj al-Hijara in February/March 722. In response, Caliph Yazid II (r. 720–724) sent {{one of his most}} celebrated generals, al-Jarrah ibn Abdallah, with 25,000 Syrian troops north. Al-Jarrah was swiftly successful in driving the Khazars back across the Caucasus, recovered Derbent and even advanced on Balanjar. The Khazars tried to defend their capital by ringing the citadel with a laager of wagons, but the Arabs broke <b>it</b> <b>apart</b> and stormed the city on 21 August 722 or 723. Most of Balanjar's inhabitants were killed or enslaved, but a few managed to flee north. Despite their success, however, the Arabs had not yet defeated the main Khazar army, which like all nomad forces was not dependent on cities for supplies. The continuing threat of the Khazar army forced the Arabs to abandon any attempt to capture Samandar as well, and to retreat to Warthan south of the Caucasus. The sources are obscure on al-Jarrah's activity in 723, but he seems to have led another campaign north (which may indeed be the Balanjar campaign). In response, the Khazars raided south of the Caucasus, but in February 724, al-Jarrah inflicted a crushing defeat on them in a battle between the rivers Cyrus and Araxes that lasted for several days. Al-Jarrah followed up his success by capturing Tiflis and bringing Caucasian Iberia and the lands of the Alans under Muslim suzerainty, becoming the first Muslim commander to campaign through the Darial Pass in the process. This secured the Muslims' own flank against a possible Khazar attack through the Darial, while conversely it gave the Muslim army a second invasion route into Khazar territory.|$|E
5|$|Unlike other Novomessor species, workers forage {{early in}} the morning and late {{afternoon}}, whereas N. cockerelli and N. albisetosus forage during the afternoon and evening. However, it is unknown whether or not these ants are active during the night. Foragers first emerge from their nests at 9 A.M. and return by 5 P.M. They are rarely seen during the middle of the day when temperatures reach 95–100°F (35–38°C), although the ground temperature is considerably higher. Workers are commonly seen foraging between 9 and 11 A.M. and 3 to 5 P.M. Most workers forage on the ground, but sometimes they can be seen walking on low herbage without feeding on the plants or collecting any seeds. Excavated nests showed no evidence that these ants collect seeds, and no workers were seen collecting them or carrying them back to the nest. N. ensifer ants are solitary foragers that work 25 ft (7 m) away from their home nest. N. ensifer predominately feeds on insects they prey on, consuming dead insects such as ichneumon wasps, bembicine wasps and small moths. When a worker discovers a dead insect, it will start to pull and carry it back to the nest immediately, and other nestmates will join once they detect it. Workers do not cooperate with each other and pull the insect from all directions, accidentally tearing <b>it</b> <b>apart.</b> However, the workers will eventually have a piece of the insect left and return it to the nest. The only known predator of N. ensifer is the giant horned lizard (Phrynosoma asio). Mites and Springtail arthropods are known to dwell inside nests, but their function or purpose within a colony is unknown.|$|E
