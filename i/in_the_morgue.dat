5|$|Earlier travels had exposed Géricault {{to victims}} of {{insanity}} and plague, and while researching the Méduse his effort to be historically accurate and realistic led to an obsession with the stiffness of corpses. To achieve the most authentic rendering of the flesh tones of the dead, he made sketches of bodies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morgue</b> of the Hospital Beaujon, studied the faces of dying hospital patients, brought severed limbs back to his studio to study their decay, and for a fortnight drew a severed head, borrowed from a lunatic asylum and stored on his studio roof.|$|E

5|$|While Osborn lies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morgue,</b> it is {{revealed}} that the goblin formula gave him a previously-unknown healing factor which restores him to life; {{in the process of}} sneaking out, he kills someone with a similar physique to himself to feign his death. No longer suffering from bouts of amnesia, Norman escapes to Europe, where he can move freely and unnoticed. During this time abroad, believed dead by the general public, he orchestrates several plots, including replacing Aunt May with a genetically altered actress, and faking his own son's death.|$|E
5|$|A {{secretary}} at the FBI office, Dorothy Bahnsen (Jane Perry), helps Dales find a file that mentions Gissing, {{one of the}} two other men mentioned by Bill who had committed suicide. She explains that she files all the unsolved cases under X because there is more room under X than U. Gissing's body is still <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morgue</b> and Dales convinces the technician to cut open the body where they find a strange creature has been sewn into Gissing's chest. Dales goes to Skur's wife and tells her what was done to her husband and that he wants to expose the experiments. Skur's wife goes down into the backyard bomb shelter to tell Skur, but he is overcome by his parasite and kills her.|$|E

Mark and his team arrive at her hotel, but they find the room is empty. Diana goes {{to the hospital to}} see Paul, he tries to call for help, but he is too weak. Diana tells him that she did not push him, but if she did, he would be <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morgue.</b> She asks him to tell the truth and do the right thing, before leaving through the side entrance of the room.|$|E
5|$|In {{the waiting}} room outside the morgue, the doctor tells Buffy that Joyce died of an {{aneurysm}} suddenly and painlessly. Left alone with Buffy, Tara tells her that her own mother {{died when she was}} 17 and she went through something similar. Dawn goes alone to the morgue to see Joyce's body. While she is there, one of the bodies, now a vampire, gets up. After noticing Dawn has not come back, Buffy goes to look for her and finds her <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morgue,</b> being attacked by the vampire. As Buffy fights and kills the vampire, the sheet falls from Joyce's face. Looking at her mother, Dawn asks where she went, as she reaches out to touch her cheek.|$|E
5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) arrives late to {{the crime}} scene and John Doggett (Robert Patrick) tells her that the man's blood all drained {{abruptly}} in the hotel. A child’s bloody print is found, but Scully doesn’t believe that a child did this. Meanwhile, the beggar, somehow disguised as an ordinary-looking Caucasian man, applies for a janitorial job at a Cheverly, Maryland elementary school. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>morgue,</b> Scully describes the massive stomach damage done to the body which leads Doggett to the idea of drugs being forcibly cut out of him. However, the man showed no sign of drugs in the blood tests and Scully tells Doggett that his time of death was 24 to 36 hours prior, long before he left India. Due to a discrepancy in weight, she begins to believe that there was a passenger in the corpse.|$|E

50|$|Harry Marks, from James Marks and Son also {{designed}} a small, decorative <b>morgue</b> at <b>the</b> {{western end of}} <b>the</b> hospital <b>in</b> 1896. {{it was not until}} the construction of this building that <b>the</b> <b>morgue</b> services were removed from the original hospital site <b>in</b> Ruthven Street. <b>The</b> <b>morgue</b> is a one-roomed building which was built for £158. Unlike the functional design of most <b>morgues,</b> <b>the</b> Marks designed <b>morgue</b> was richly decorated with timber fretwork on bargeboards, timber eaves brackets and roof detailing. This building remained in use until a new adjacent morgue was constructed <b>in</b> 1940. <b>The</b> 1896 <b>morgue</b> is now used as a store.|$|R
5|$|The police arrest {{a second}} suspect named Tweety (Vincent Miller), who {{was found in}} {{possession}} of the murdered woman's locket. The detectives question Marvin and Tweety separately until Tweety identifies the shooter as 19-year-old Vaughn Perkins (Lloyd Goodman). Howard is surprised to learn Vaughn has a mostly clean criminal record, and his family insists Vaughn would never kill anybody. Vaughn is arrested without incident, but Ellison is unable to identify the three suspects {{because he does not}} remember their faces. Meanwhile, Ellison sees his wife's body <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morgue,</b> and gets upset that her clothes and wedding ring have been removed. Bayliss later returns the ring to Ellison, who admits he feels guilty for not protecting his wife or stopping the shooter. Ellison asks to hold Bayliss' gun just to know how it feels, and Bayliss reluctantly agrees.|$|E
5|$|Finding her mother's body, Buffy {{at first}} denies what she sees, {{to the point}} of imagining {{alternate}} realities. Whedon stated that these mini dream sequences were like documentaries; people who find their loved ones dead are desperate to imagine a different, better outcome, and they create fantasies that cause much more pain when they are forced to return to the harshness of reality. Later in the hospital, Buffy imagines what she {{might have been able to}} do to save Joyce, although the doctor tells her there was nothing to be done. Willow and Xander express anger and helplessness. Anya, new to mortality and human connections, is childlike in her innocence and questions. Xander's anger and Anya's confusion allow them to be mothered somewhat by Willow, who needs to take care of someone. Dawn is deeply in denial, unable to understand that the woman she thought she had known all her life was gone. Tara, who has gone through the ordeal before, represents the acceptance phase, soothing and helping the others to work through what they are experiencing. Buffy toward the end also begins to see acceptance when she tells Dawn that the body <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morgue</b> is not their mother; Joyce is gone.|$|E
25|$|The {{revolution}} caused {{dozens of}} casualties. The exact number is unknown, {{but it is}} recognised that as of 6 October, 37 people killed in the revolution were registered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morgue.</b> Several injured turned up at the hospitals, some of whom later died. For example, out of 78 injured victims checked into Hospital de São José, 14 died in the following days.|$|E

25|$|Megalyn Echikunwoke as Tara Price; the {{day-shift}} {{medical examiner}} who replaced Alexx following her departure.

25|$|Scenes were filmed at the Watergate complex, {{for which}} the {{production}} was granted {{permission to use the}} roof of a George Washington University campus building.

Washington,D.C. police officer Quintin Peterson was employed as a consultant on the film. Peterson, who has acted as a script consultant and technical adviser on numerous productions in the city, helped the production to accurately depict the city's police force.|$|E
25|$|A {{trial is}} {{currently}} in progress at the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR). The case, brought forward by Mario Joseph from the Bureau des Avocats Internationaux (BAI) and Brian Concannon from the Institute for Justice & Democracy in Haiti, concerns Jimmy Charles, a grassroots activist who was arrested by UN troops in 2005, and {{handed over to the}} Haitian police. His body was found a few days later <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morgue,</b> filled with bullet holes. The BAI filed a complaint in Haitian courts, to no avail, and in early 2006 it filed a petition with the IACHR. The IACHR accepted the case regarding the State of Haiti, and rejected the complaint against Brazil.|$|E
5|$|The first {{full-length}} {{version was}} Murders <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Rue <b>Morgue</b> by Universal Pictures in 1932, directed by Robert Florey and starring Bela Lugosi, Leon Ames and Sidney Fox, with Arlene Francis. The film bears {{little resemblance to}} the original story.|$|R

500|$|Mahmoud Makki Abutaki was a 22-year-old {{college student}} majoring in engineering, {{when he died}} on 17February after being {{shot in the back}} by police. Medics pulled about 200 pellets of birdshot from his chest and arms. Abutaki's elder brother, Ahmed, who was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morgue</b> while holding his brothers' hands, {{recalled}} the last conversation they had the previous night for the media present: [...] "He said, 'This is my chance, to have a say, so that maybe our country will do something for us.' My country did do something; it killed him." ...|$|E
500|$|Audiences reacted more emotionally than Whedon {{expected}} to Emma Caulfield's performance. Anya's blunt innocence {{was similar to}} a plot twist, as viewers did not expect the depth of sensitivity that she portrayed in her monologue, which Whedon considers [...] "the heart of the experience" [...] and critic Noel Murray reiterates as the [...] "whole point of the episode in bolded, capital letters". Xander's punching the wall and hurting his hand served to give the four in this scene something to concentrate on, to redirect their helplessness, which was another facet of the physicality {{of dealing with the}} crisis. Whedon used another long tracking shot from Joyce's face <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morgue</b> following the doctor down the hall to speak with Buffy and the Scoobies to cement the reality of their being so close in proximity, as opposed to cutting shots to give the possibility that it was part of another set located somewhere else. The vampire that attacks Dawn <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morgue</b> was a touch many viewers took to be out of place for the episode. This scene contrasts the more fantasy-related deaths common in the series with Joyce's realistic death. Furthermore, similar to Xander's parking ticket and the sounds of life outside Buffy's house, in Sunnydale vampires are a normal experience, and it was intended to show that life for Buffy continues.|$|E

They hold John at gunpoint, where he admits that the [...] "bombs" [...] will simply triangulate the location of a diamond he stole off a former lover. However, by using the devices and the pyramid, he discovers there is no diamond; John's former lover anticipated dying, and thus set a trap to kill her murderer. [...] The device turns out to be a bomb which attaches itself to John and begins a ten-minute countdown.|$|E

25|$|Through his {{association}} with Dracula (in which he appeared with minimal makeup, using his natural, heavily accented voice), Lugosi found himself typecast as a horror villain in movies such as Murders <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Rue <b>Morgue,</b> <b>The</b> Raven, and Son of Frankenstein for Universal, and the independent White Zombie. His accent, while {{a part of his}} image, limited the roles he could play.|$|R
