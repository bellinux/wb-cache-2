2500|$|Of course, the Coriolis force does still {{impact the}} {{direction}} of the flow of water, but only minutely. Only if the water is so still that the effective rotation rate of the Earth is faster than that of the water relative to its container, and if externally applied torques (such as might be caused by flow over an uneven bottom surface) are small enough, the Coriolis effect may indeed determine {{the direction of}} the vortex. Without such careful preparation, the Coriolis effect is likely to be much smaller than various other influences on <b>drain</b> <b>direction</b> such as any residual rotation of the water and the geometry of the container. Despite this, the idea that toilets and bathtubs drain differently in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres has been popularized by several television programs and films, including Escape Plan, Wedding Crashers, The Simpsons episode [...] "Bart vs. Australia", Pole to Pole, and The X-Files episode [...] "Die Hand Die Verletzt". Several science broadcasts and publications, including at least one college-level physics textbook, have also stated this.|$|E

The bottom-contact-type OTFT with an active layer of copper-phthalocyanine (CuPc) was cleaved and internal potential distribution of its channel region was visualized. The potential distribution on the cross section changed depending on the applied drain and gate voltage. Horizontal potential distribution in the semiconductor film from source to <b>drain</b> <b>direction</b> was roughly consistent with the results of surface potential imaging previously reported.

40|$|The {{lifetime}} {{and stability of}} AlGaN/GaN heterostructure field effect transistors at high power levels can be enhanced by introducing field plates to reduce electric field peaks in the gate-drain region. Simulations of the electric field distribution along the channel using the 2 D ATLAS software from Silvaco indicate that above a characteristic drain source voltage three spatially separated electric field peaks appear, one located at the drain-side edge of the gate foot, one {{at the end of}} the drain-sided gate field plate, and one {{at the end of the}} source shield field plate. The close correlation between lateral electric field and the electroluminescence due to hot electron related intra-band transitions can be very helpful when optimizing the electric field distribution in high power devices. Electroluminescence microscopy images of devices with gate and source shield field plate reveal the peaks located at the locations of enhanced electric field. By studying the voltage dependence of the electroluminescence peaks the influence of the field plates on the electric field distribution in source <b>drain</b> <b>direction</b> can be visualized...|$|E

40|$|Long-term {{stability}} {{and reliability of}} AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMT) can be validated by various stress tests which allow studying the physical mechanisms responsible for degradation. As the electroluminescence (EL) intensity {{is related to the}} kinetic energy and density of the channel electrons accelerated in the electric field, both local current and electric field changes can result in an increase or decrease of the EL intensity. The electric field distribution in source <b>drain</b> <b>direction</b> peaks at the drain side edge of the gate foot and the field plates. It is strongly dependent on the gate design and the passivation /semiconductor interface trap density. Although the spatial resolution of the electroluminescence microscopy (ELM) set-up is limited to a few microns, the technique allows to monitor submicron changes in the device geometry and hence to identify elevated electric field peaks being responsible for the acceleration of the degradation process. ELM also benefits from the fact that submicron imperfections at the Schottky interface of the gate electrode result in strong local current variations. It has been used to selectively identify suitable positions for further failure analysis of focused ion beam prepared cross sections by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Process induced imperfections as voids at the Schottky interface after stress have been localized...|$|E

40|$|Thin disk laser is analyzed, {{assuming}} that the heat is drained in the same direction, as the optical pulse, withdrawing the stored energy, comes. Amplified spontaneous emission, the background loss, and overheating {{are taken into account}} with simple model. The scaling laws of the basic parameters are deduced. For the case of fixed repetition rate, the upper bound of thickness is obtained. Key parameters are suggested. The key energy parameter is promoted as criterion for evaluation of different laser materials for the high energy, high mean power disk lasers. The maximum energy per active element is estimated. For the scaling up the power and/or energy withdrawn from a single active element, the background loss should scale down inversely proportional to the cube of the background loss. This scaling law gives the criterion whether the heat should be <b>drained</b> in the <b>direction</b> orthogonal to the beam that withdraws the energy. Copyright © 2008 Dmitrii Kouznetsov.

The beds of limestone could generally be traced in the direction towards NW; the most distinct tectonic structures are in the Dinaric direction and transversely to the Dinaric direction. Three bigger streams and one smaller flow from the flysch on the contact with limestone, which sink into the limestone. The following caves are connected to the cave system: Ocizeljska jama, Blažev spodmol, Maletova jama s slapom, Jama z naravnim mostom, Jurjeva jama v Lokah and Jama S- 4 / Socerb; the entrances of four of those caves function as occasional ponors.

At the narrowest point, due west, the island is a mere 300 meters off the mainland. Yet all transports arrives via the Prek Toek Sap estuary from Koh K'chhang fishing village to the north, a distance of around 3 km. Roughly pentagonal shaped with four sides of similar length, a shorter and rugged fifth side in the South, the inner coastline is dominated by extensive mangrove marshes. Along the sea-facing coast, sizable beaches can be found, littered with shells, the sands of rather coarse composition. Still, due to the unspoiled, pristine state, dense, lush and primeval vegetation, its general remoteness and very sparse population, Koh Thmei {{is considered one of}} the most ecologically esteemed Cambodian islands among its visitors.The island's center is roughly the highest point with two main peaks, separated by a river {Prek Koh Krabei}. The peaks rise to over 100 meters and <b>drain</b> in all <b>directions,</b> lending Koh Thmei the shape of a gentle mountain.

3000|$|A {{previous}} study of Central Groundwater Board (Roy 2004) {{has been used}} to identify the land use/land cover of the study area. The soil and land-use/land cover property of the area have been used to delineate the recharge polygons and to mark the recharge areas. Rainfall, river discharges are the main sources of groundwater recharge in this area. Average annual recharge values of 250  mm/year is used for the model. The study area falls in coastal alluvium; clear demarcation of the boundary is limited up to groundwater table depth. The study area falls within the <b>drain</b> in north-west <b>direction</b> (Dhauriha nala), north-east (Kanchi nala), and Bay of Bengal in south. Extensive field investigation has been carried out in the study area and interacted with field department to obtain most of the parameters used in MODFLOW. Conductivity has been collected from the previous published papers and literature (Mohapatra 2011) having values as K [...] x [...] (0.005  m/day), K [...] y [...] (0.005  m/day), and K [...] z [...] (0.0005  m/day). The map of recharge zones which is made by soil and land-use map of the study area is either scrubby or under rice cultivation consists of sandy soil with the agriculture and fallow land type land use. The urban area with buildings and concretized roads reduced the recharge and increased usage due to inflow of tourists. Hydraulic parameters of the previous studies reported by Singh et al. (2002) are taken into consideration during model calibration. The major part of the study area is covered by alluvium, which is covering 70 % part of the study area and composed of sandy, forms the principal and potential confined aquifers. The thickness of the alluvium varies from 80 to 120  m {{in different parts of the}} study area. The bore wells are the only source to fulfill domestic demands of this area. Data related to pumping wells have been collected by local administrative authority. Average discharges from the pumping wells have been found in the range of 2000  m 3 /day. Due to the presence of illegal pumping wells and insufficient data, total water consumption has also been calculated by other methods reported by Mohapatra (2011).|$|R
40|$|The {{key to the}} {{understanding}} of Money movements is given by the difference existing between settlement spaces and transportation spaces. The former is a contiguously settled space within which money movements are of an osmotic nature, viz, money flows as liquid does in compensating differences of pressure within a cellular tissue. Settlement spaces only exist on land and their extension depends on the earth`s surface configuration. A transportation space, on the contrary, can over land and sea and its extension, being chiefly determined by technical progress, has grown considerably in the course of history. Part of the transportation spaces coincide with the settlement spaces, the other part bridging the gaps between them. Inside a transportation space money moves by leaps and bounds and {{there is no guarantee that}} natural compensatory flows, crossing the gaps between the different settlements spaces, will be instigated. Only in case of an incidental perfect harmony between their respective economic structures could such an automatic adjustment be relied upon. However, their economic structures depend primarily on internal conditions, so that disharmonies are the rule and <b>drains</b> in one <b>direction</b> to another must ensue. If a settlement space is completely covered by transportation spaces we say that an economic space has developed. Like the settlement space it is therefore separated by gaps from other economic spaces, thus forming a natural interior market. Inside an economic space transportation movements of money may also occasion drains, but their volume is limited by the harmony imposed by spatial interdependence and is moreover mitigated by compensatory osmotic flows. Whilst political boundaries, at least in Europe, have changed little in the last century, the economic and transportation spaces have grown considerably. This explains why efforts are being made to reach an "integration". Aiming at unifying the artificially segregated "home" markets in order to create an unfettered economic space, which is the natural interior market. However, we find many inconsistencies and lack of clarity in the discussion on this topic, as politicians are guided rather by political than by economic considerations. Ignoring spatial relationships these are often incompatible with true integration, going so far as to try to achieve the membership of unwilling nations which are located in other spaces.
