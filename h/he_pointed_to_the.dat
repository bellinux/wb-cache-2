5|$|In 1865, Cancellor's {{death was}} used in a medical journal article {{discussing}} adult hydrocephalus. Despite Willis' statement that Cancellor had no pre-existing medical condition that would have caused or contributed to his death, author Samuel Wilks suggested not only that Cancellor had hydrocephalus, {{but that he was}} consequently more susceptible to physical injury as a result. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> autopsy finding of fluid in Cancellor's brain to support his assertions and argued that this effusion would have caused physical weakness.|$|E
5|$|On 10 December 1936, Álvarez put the Republic's {{case to the}} League of Nations, further {{demanding}} that the League condemn Italy's and Germany's decision to recognise the Nationalists. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> risk of the Spanish war spreading, and suggested that the Non-Intervention Committee was ineffective. This charge was denied by Lord Cranborne and Édouard Viénot, the British and French representatives respectively, who appealed to the League to endorse the mediation plan. The League condemned intervention, urged its council's members to support non-intervention, and commended mediation. It then closed discussion on Spain, leaving it to the Committee. The mediation plan, however, was soon dropped. Britain and France continued to consider, and put forward, plans to prevent foreign volunteers, outside of the Committee.|$|E
25|$|At the 1964 general election, Hughes-Young faced another {{challenge}} from Labour, who had selected Dr David Kerr; in his election address <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that Labour had opposed the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962 {{and asked how}} the local housing situation would cope without restrictions on immigration. In line with the national swing, Labour gained the constituency by 2,245 votes.|$|E

25|$|Grey was {{determined}} to end the threat of an independence movement and presented a case to the Colonial Office in London that emphasised the threats and dangers of the King Movement, claiming that the European settlement {{was in danger of}} being wiped out. As evidence. <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> theft of large amounts of gunpowder from Kawau Island in 1856 and the attack on Auckland City from the sea that was only stopped by a British warship and troops from Fort Britomart. To meet the danger, the British Government sent out 14,000 troops, commanded by Cameron.|$|E
500|$|Responding later, in an indieWIRE panel {{discussion}} hosted by Anne Thompson, Universal Studios chairman Adam Fogelson agreed in principle with Fithian, saying [...] "there {{are very few}} reasons other than historical behavior why almost any film can't work on almost any weekend ..." [...] he said. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 2005 success of White Noise on the first weekend of January as having opened that time up to similar low-budget horror films.|$|E
500|$|During Nolting's {{first meeting}} with Diệm after the {{assassination}} attempt, the president adamantly asserted that the media {{was responsible for the}} bombing. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Newsweek article and other [...] "derogatory articles in the press", using them to justify his claim that [...] "the Americans were supporting the revolution". Diệm declared that while some journalists were portraying the bombing as a wake-up call he saw it as [...] "a warning to them—an indicator of the danger of their irresponsibility [...] ".|$|E

500|$|In 1996, Boycott {{assaulted}} Margaret Moore, {{a former}} lover. Boycott denied the charges, claiming {{she had fallen}} over and injured herself. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that Moore was in financial difficulties {{and said that he}} would never hit a woman. However, in the second trial beginning on 20 October 1998, Boycott, having missed the first trial in January where his conviction had been set, appeared before a French magistrates' court and was given a three-month suspended sentence, and his £5,300 fine was confirmed. He was criticised by the Magistrate for the way he conducted his case and for [...] "rudely interrupting" [...] Mrs Moore's barrister.|$|E
500|$|Gjems-Onstad deliberated his post-war {{views on}} the war in a 2008 ten-minute {{television}} special. As he saw it, the Norwegian Labour Party government before the war stood [...] "entirely {{on the side of the}} Soviet Union." [...] <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union as the greatest murderer of the war, and considered that nobody had [...] "opened their eyes" [...] to the fact that the Soviet Union was the only country that won territorial gains following the war. While he maintained that the coup headed by Vidkun Quisling was both bad and illegal, he considered that Quisling should be judged softer in light of the situation at the time. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> government fleeing the country, and what he considered the [...] "pitiful" [...] reaction of Prime Minister Johan Nygaardsvold. He also noted that while some of the figures in the Quisling regime had acted out far too harshly, some others had tried to maintain Norway's interests against the occupiers; the alternative of letting the Germans run the country completely unopposed under Josef Terboven could in his mind have ended up far worse. Gjems-Onstad said he believed that the treason by Quisling should be compared with the lack of preparations for war by Nygaardsvold and the Labour Party government. Gjems-Onstad also complained that he for unexplained reasons had been kept away from public arrangements related to the Second World War. He said he had not been invited to a single such event. He was also in possession of a large archive of wartime material from the resistance movement in Trøndelag, but said he had not been approached with interest by any public institution.|$|E
500|$|He {{was walking}} down a quiet {{suburban}} street {{on his way home}} after his usual evening teaching session. He noticed three youths hovering several yards away {{on the opposite side of}} the street. When they approached him he was ready. [...] "Give us your money, or you'll get hurt" [...] said the leader of the three. Abbe looked at each one in turn, then casually took his wallet out of his jacket pocket, throwing it on the floor between himself and the antagonists. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wallet and said, [...] "I am prepared to die for that wallet, what about you?" [...] The three would-be attackers looked at the wallet on the floor, then at Abbe and then at each other and then moved away. Abbe picked up his wallet and calmly walked home.|$|E

500|$|The {{event has}} been rated by several sources. Adam Gutschmidt, writing for Online Onslaught, stated that [...] "many of the substitutions hurt the matches" [...] and that [...] "the main event was bland". The Other Arena opined that the Four Doinks match {{was the worst}} on the card and that the {{confrontation}} between Lex Luger and Ludvig Borga was boring. Scott Criscuolo and Justin Rozzero reviewed the event for The History of WWE. Both writers gave Survivor Series 1993 a [...] "C" [...] rating and viewed the Family Feud match as the worst on the card. Matt Peddycord, writing for 411mania.com, gave the event a 5.5 out of 10 rating. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crowd's chant of [...] "We want Doink!" [...] as evidence that fans were upset by the Four Doinks match.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} notable aspects of Justice Black's {{jurisprudence}} was {{the view that the}} entirety of the federal Bill of Rights was applicable to the states. Originally, the Bill of Rights was binding only upon the federal government, as the Supreme Court ruled in Barron v. Baltimore (1833). According to Black, the Fourteenth Amendment, ratified in 1868, [...] "incorporated" [...] the Bill of Rights, or made it binding upon the states as well. In particular, <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Privileges or Immunities Clause, [...] "No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States." [...] He proposed that the term [...] "privileges or immunities" [...] encompassed the rights mentioned in the first eight amendments to the Constitution.|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{about the}} moment when Nico Rosberg let him past {{in the early stages}} of the race, Hamilton told the press that he had thanked his {{teammate}} for [...] "being a gentleman". When asked how painful it had been to be asked to let Hamilton go by, Rosberg said: [...] "It was more painful the feeling that I had in the car. That was the worst. Around Monaco, that's not a nice feeling to have. I had no confidence at all. The second thing [...] was just a consequence of that." [...] Mercedes's motorsport director Toto Wolff also praised Rosberg for working for the team and moving to the side without questioning the team's decision. Rosberg was however unable to give an explanation for his slow pace during the early stages. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> possibility that his car's tyre and brake temperatures had been particularly affected by the period behind the safety car.|$|E
6000|$|Leaving Blake's veiled threat unanswered, <b>the</b> Duke turned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> old rake. [...] "These rogues," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> prisoners, [...] "demand proofs ere {{they will}} admit {{the truth of}} the impeachment." ...|$|R

500|$|Excavation of Chestnuts Long Barrow {{revealed}} {{that it had}} been systematically destroyed in one event, and Ashbee suggested that the same may have happened to the Coldrum Stones. He believed that the kerb-stones around the barrow were toppled, laid prostrate in the surrounding ditch, and then buried during the late 13th or early 14th century, by Christians seeking to obliterate non-Christian monuments. Conversely, the archaeologist John Alexander—who excavated Chestnuts in 1957—suggested that the Medway tombs were destroyed by robbers looking for treasure within them. As evidence, <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Close Roll of 1237, which ordered the opening of tumuli on the Isle of Wight in search for treasure, a practice which may have spread to Kent around the same time. Alexander believed that the destruction in Kent may have been brought about by a special commissioner, highlighting that the [...] "expertness and thoroughness of the robbery" [...] at Chestnuts would have necessitated resources beyond that which a local community could probably muster. Ashbee further suggested that in subsequent centuries, locals raided the damaged Coldrum tomb for loamy chalk and stone, which was then re-used as building material.|$|E
500|$|At {{the podium}} interviews, {{conducted}} by former Formula One driver Martin Brundle, Hamilton thanked his team and expressed satisfaction {{about how the}} race went. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> problems of driving on the full wet tyres {{for such a long}} distance, saying that they were about to [...] "drop off", meaning to lose much of their grip to the race surface, when he came in to change. He complimented Ricciardo on driving [...] "phenomenally all weekend". Ricciardo himself lamented his misfortune in losing the race during his second pit stop. In regard to his team's error and their different strategy at the previous race in Spain, which he felt had cost him a chance at victory there as well, he said: [...] "Two weekends in a row I've been screwed now. It sucks. It hurts." [...] He emphasised that it had not been his decision to pit at that time, but that the team had called him in and criticised them for not being ready when he arrived. Sergio Pérez on the other hand was [...] "extremely happy" [...] with the performance by him and the team, saying that the race was his favourite podium finish while driving for Force India.|$|E
500|$|In 1898, Stansfield was {{appointed}} Superintendent at Bexley Mental Hospital and advocated the cottage or villa system of dispersed accommodation unconnected by corridors; this was, in his opinion, more economical {{and made the}} classification and separation of recent and chronic cases easier. He also recommended {{a significant increase in}} the number of medical staff, and the use of parole and rewards for [...] "practicable or industrious" [...] patients. He was able to influence the LCC enough that they added villas to Bexley and used them at the Hellingly Hospital (opened in 1903). Stansfield remained superintendent at Bexley until 1921 and his tenure witnessed the institution of his parole system and the construction of a hospital wing for men. Some of his views have proven controversial. <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> [...] "mass of degeneracy in the lower ranks of the population which is increasing out of all proportion to the remainder of the population" [...] and asked [...] "how are we as a nation to overcome the evil and stem the flow of this rising tide?" [...] This was a view, and a question, which played into wider debates about eugenics at the turn of the 20th century. The years after the First World War and their changes frustrated him, spurring his retirement in 1921, although he served as President of the Kent Branch of the British Medical Association for the 1921–22 year.|$|E

2500|$|He {{indirectly}} hearkened {{back to the}} Lochner era economic {{due process}} cases, accusing the court of writing its own economic policy into the law, when such a regulation should be within the police power of the state. [...] <b>He</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> potentially misleading nature of commercial speech, and suggested that consumers who truly needed such information could easily seek it out themselves.|$|E
2500|$|At Rabbi Frank's next sermon, he {{said that}} a [...] "Jew who remains silent {{in the face of}} {{prejudice}} leveled at another group of God's children is traitorous to the basic principle of Judaism." [...] Referring to the people who violently supported segregation, <b>he</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Jewish concept of repentance and forgiveness, saying, [...] "no man should be so merciless that he will not forgive even the most sordid actions of men." ...|$|E
2500|$|When later {{questioned}} about his comments, Ellison {{told a reporter}} that Osama bin Laden, and not the Bush administration, {{was responsible for the}} attacks. Ellison also said, [...] "In the aftermath of a tragedy, space is opened up for governments to take action that they could not have achieved before that."

And <b>he</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Beatitudes as showing what gives deep happiness, what we should strive to live up to every day: being poor in spirit and meek and humble of heart, merciful and peacemakers, hungering and thirsting for righteousness.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is evident}} from the Islamic traditions that God is not chastising the mutual {{attraction}} and love between them but that <b>he</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> associated factors that made their love affair impossible.

5000|$|Khalidi calls Plan Dalet a [...] "Master Plan for the Conquest of Palestine". <b>He</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Zionist {{ideas of}} {{transfer}} {{and of a}} Jewish state in all of Palestine, and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> offensive character of the military operations of the Zionists as the main proof of his interpretation.|$|R
