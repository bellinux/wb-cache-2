We discuss the relation of the voltage and the current in the equivalent network with the electric and magnetic fields in the physical circuit. We also present a new technology based on mesh reduction to eliminate redundancy and hence reduce the order of the equivalent RLC network. This new technology comprises a generalization of the basis functions used in the disretization of the surface currents. The generalized basis functions allow for a more efficient meshing of complex geometrical structures in terms of polygonal shaped cells. The increased simulation performance is demonstrated in the examples. We present numerical simulation results for two real-life examples: an RF board interconnect layout and a high-density ball-grid array package. 1...|$|R
50|$|A report {{conducted}} by Acorn Canada of low and moderate income Canadian families found that 83.5% of respondents believe the monthly cost of <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> internet service in Canada is very expensive. The Canadian Internet Registration Authority reports that in 2015 Canadians paid {{an average of}} $38.91 per month for <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> internet service, or an average of $203.04 monthly for all communication services combined.

50|$|Roll {{slitting}} is {{a technique}} heavily used by Converters (industry). The converter industry normally refers to companies who print, coat and laminate materials. A typical converter {{is a company that}} produces flexible packaging material for packaging food. This may involve purchasing large rolls of plastic film such as biaxially orientated polypropylene (BOPP) which is then printed to the customer's design and coated with cold seal adhesive for use on <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>packaging</b> machines. This material is printed and coated in wide, large diameter rolls for maximum efficiency. The rolls are then slit, using a slitting machine, into smaller rolls of the size to be used on the packaging machine.|$|E
50|$|Many <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> {{internet}} <b>packages</b> {{offered in}} Canada have data caps, or online data consumption limits that when surpassed {{will result in}} additional charges being applied to a user's monthly bill. Data caps in Canada can be as low as 20GB, which is over six times lower than the lowest data cap in the United States of 150GB. Data caps contribute to the digital divide by discouraging online usage in users due to the fear of incurring overage charges for any bandwidth consumed once one's data cap has been exceeded. This results in further difficulties for low income families and minority groups regarding being able to afford and make significant use of <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> internet access at home.|$|R
5000|$|II Morrow shifted {{focus from}} marine {{business}} to development of package process automation technology for UPS such as vehicle management systems, automated <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>package</b> sorting systems, {{as well as}} delivery and tracking systems. In 1999, II Morrow was renamed to UPS Aviation Technologies, and re-focused towards modernizing UPS' Boeing 7xx series Heavy Iron Transport Category Aircraft fleet, as well they also re-entered the general aviation marketplace. It certified the first Gamma 3 WAAS GPS engine for FAA Certified Precision GPS approaches. The new certified WAAS engine yielded vertical and horizontal accuracy of one meter RMS in guidance into airports without existing ILS approaches. This GPS technology met the FAA's TSO-C146a primary navigation standards for en route, terminal and approach phases of flight—with WAAS augmentation as the sole means of navigation. This primary GPS [...] "sole source" [...] navigation capability was integrated into the CNX-80. The CNX-80 WAAS GPS/COM/NAV integrated navigator was the first product in the industry approved for primary GPS navigation. It also enabled LPV [...] "glidescope" [...] approaches without requiring ground nav aids. New LNAV (GPS) approaches provide the accuracy and safety of an ILS—without the ground-based localizer and glideslope equipment. Later, the CNX-80 was renamed the GNS-480, under Garmin.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1995 With edge {{rates of}} <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> digital devices pushing into the sub-nano second range, {{interconnections}} {{with the associated}} packages {{play a major role}} in determining the speed, size and performance of digital circuits and systems. The purpose of this study is to develop experimental techniques based on time domain peeling algorithms (dynamic deconvolution) for accurate electrical characterization and circuit modeling of general interconnection structures. This thesis describes the basic principles and computational procedure of these time domain peeling algorithms, accompanied by many illustrations and examples of practical interconnection structures in <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> electronic <b>packages.</b> These include general single (isolated) interconnections with nonuniform cross section, general uniformly/ nonuniformly coupled interconnection structures with discontinuities, power/ ground systems with the associated parallel plane structures, resistive lossy interconnections in thin film single and multi-chip modules, and multilayer high-pin-count packages. It is shown that the distributed circuit models consisting of cascaded transmission line sections lead to an accurate evaluation of the time domain response of <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> interconnection structures. These distributed models are synthesized from the time domain reflection and transmission (TDRIT) measurements, and the impedance profiles of the distributed model are extracted by using scattering matrix-based peeling algorithms By direct time domain integration or frequency domain optimization, the distributed circuit model can also be used to construct the lumped element circuit model as well as the proposed hybrid element model consisting of transmission lines and lumped elements. The hybrid model is intended to combine the efficiency of the lumped element model with the accuracy of the distributed circuit model leading to efficient accurate simulation of circuits in general CAD tools. The accuracy of these circuit models is also confirmed by comparing the simulated data with the measured data for the test fixtures on printed circuit boards (PCBs) and chip-to-chip level interconnections. The techniques developed in this thesis can help to assure the signal fidelity of <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> circuits in the early design stage by incorporating interconnect models into integrated circuit design and simulation...|$|R

This paper {{takes a look at}} the practical and cost effective design aspects of the 10 - 12. 5 Gbps links as well as the feasibility and requirements for the next generation of serial links operating in the 20 - 25 Gbps range.

40|$|Cost-effective, {{reliable}} operation of reciprocating compressors requires {{a balance between}} pulsation control and performance. With high-speed units, acoustic excitation frequencies more severely overlap the acoustic and mechanical response frequencies of the passages and the piping system. To achieve good cylinder performance and pulsation control, the designer must more than ever understand the capabilities and limitations of the tools used for design. Internal gas passage acoustics, cylinder-to-cylinder and cylinder-to-piping interactions, and non-linear flow losses can {{have a significant effect}} on the accuracy of the design predictions. Industry standard digital models typically solve the linear frequency domain piping response equations coupled to a piston face velocity source. Typically, these models are non-interactive with the piping and, therefore, the predicted cylinder performance does not accurately reflect the acoustics of the cylinder passages or the attached piping. Analog models (which also solve the linear acoustics of the piping system) do, in a limited fashion, allow interaction of the piping and the cylinder. However, this interaction is controlled by the very nature of the analog electrical components and, for high-speed units, the analog can under predict valve and pulsation effects. The Gas Machinery Research Council (GMRC) has funded an effort to develop a digital design system with full interaction between cylinder and piping components, enhanced to meet the demanding requirements of today’s <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> compressor <b>packages.</b> This paper presents the initial results of this effort. This enhanced model accurately reflects the effect of the internal gas passages and piping acoustics on the performance of the cylinder. A comparison is made between field data, predictions from the enhanced digital model, predictions from a non-interactive cylinder and piping digital model, and predictions from an analog simulation. Differences in the capabilities of the various design tools investigated are summarized...|$|R
