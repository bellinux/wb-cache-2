So I went and it was just total improv and obviously it was sloppy at first, but I got out all my thoughts and then I wrote everything down that I said and then I perfected the timing of it. So it was totally spontaneous." ...|$|E

This is to go some way in thanking you for that." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{helped you}} to escape," [...] Macheson said, [...] "but I did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> done. There is another matter. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> {{to go away}} from here quietly and swear never to molest----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Surely you {{can trust}} me," [...] the woman said. [...] "I would lay down my life for you, and I know Adolphe would do so too when he <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done for us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What did {{you expect}} when {{you asked me to}} see <b>you?</b> <b>What?</b> <b>You</b> <b>know</b> me. I am Lingard. You lived with me. You've heard men speak. <b>You</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> done. Well! <b>What</b> did <b>you</b> expect?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Most interesting! You must pardon me, but as {{nobody ever}} <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> just found out, you will excuse my ignorance,' said Logan, who, to be sure, {{had never heard}} of the brave Lord Willoughby.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have seen}} it. I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> to {{tell from the}} instant you entered. And your father <b>has</b> given <b>you</b> his consent?' raising her hand, as if to say, 'I give up all hopes of him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are {{the nurse}} {{of this young}} lady," [...] Beric said to her sternly, [...] "and should {{know better than to}} bring her into danger. If Norbanus <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done he would <b>have</b> <b>you</b> cut in pieces." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Mr. Grey! I do not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done to him," [...] {{said her}} Ladyship, {{settling}} {{at least a}} dozen bracelets; [...] "but, but--" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "By no means," [...] said Cyaxares, [...] "your {{grandfather}} {{would be}} very much displeased to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> done. He would not only condemn you for acting thus, but he would reprove us too, severely, for allowing you to do so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mark {{was telling}} me last night about the great college <b>you</b> <b>had</b> chosen; I thought {{it must be a}} very {{original}} and interesting way to educate one's self, and wanted very much to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> been studying lately.

Chicago is to be sacrificed, but it shall be Chicago alone." ...|$|R
5000|$|Dear Boy was {{actually}} a song to Linda's ex-husband: [...] "I guess <b>you</b> never <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> missed."

6000|$|... "Then {{go round}} {{and let the}} boys <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> told me. They can meet outside Ransome's shanty. The dinner-hour will do. I'll be there to meet them." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] she answered, [...] "perhaps {{he wanted}} me to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> done, and, anyway, he had to put me on my guard.

6000|$|The {{eyes of the}} {{tradesman}} {{stood out}} of his head like a snail's; he really seemed for an instant likely to fling himself upon the stranger.

6000|$|She went on, without {{noticing the}} interruption. [...] "You won't think me ungrateful? We had better speak of {{something}} else. Only this evening, your mother sent for me, and--don't be angry!--I am afraid {{she might be}} vexed if she <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been saying to me. Perhaps I am wrong?
