5|$|Qualitative {{models are}} {{occasionally}} used. One <b>example</b> <b>is</b> qualitative scenario planning in which possible future events are played out. Another <b>example</b> <b>is</b> non-numerical decision tree analysis. Qualitative models often suffer {{from lack of}} precision.|$|E
5|$|An <b>example</b> <b>is</b> {{from this}} game by Steinitz and Bernhard Fleissig.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>example</b> <b>is</b> {{furnished}} by substances like aluminium hydroxide, Al(OH)3.|$|E
30|$|These <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> {{given in}} [14]. Other <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> {{provided}} therein.|$|R
5000|$|The first <b>examples</b> <b>were</b> {{manufactured}} using assorted M1855 lock blanks and {{are mounted}} in iron with high and medium high lockplate humps. Later <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> mounted in brass with a graceful [...] "S" [...] shaped hammer. Only {{the very early}} <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> known to have a patchbox.|$|R
3000|$|... {{by using}} simple techniques. Some {{numerical}} <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> provided {{to support our}} theoretical results. These <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> experimental verifications of theoretical discussions.|$|R
5|$|Another <b>example</b> <b>is</b> {{potassium}} cobaltinitrite, , {{which is}} used as artist's pigment {{under the name of}} Aureolin or Cobalt Yellow.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} knights' fortifications, {{over the years}} various {{individuals}} or families built their own fortifications. These were mainly fortified residences or private watchtowers. A notable surviving <b>example</b> <b>is</b> Mamo Tower, built in 1657 in Marsaskala.|$|E
5|$|Batesian mimicry, {{where an}} edible species resembles a distasteful or {{dangerous}} species. This is {{most common in}} insects such as butterflies. A familiar <b>example</b> <b>is</b> the resemblance of harmless hoverflies (which have no sting) to bees.|$|E
3000|$|... {{of systems}} (1) and (2). Some {{numerical}} <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> provided {{to support our}} theoretical results. These <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> experimental verifications of theoretical discussions.|$|R
25|$|Only 5 <b>examples</b> <b>were</b> {{thought to}} remain, all at former RAF Hornchurch, but two well-preserved <b>examples</b> <b>were</b> rediscovered in 2014 in Docking in North Norfolk.|$|R
30|$|In this section, several {{numerical}} <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> given {{serving the}} following purposes: clarifying {{the idea of}} the method, testing its effectiveness in ranking especially at different decision levels and finally its ability to avoid some shortcomings in some previous ranking methods. The first three numerical <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> from Chen and Sanguansat (2011), <b>example</b> 4 <b>is</b> from Wang and Luo (2009), examples 5 and 6 are from Deng et al. (2006), while <b>example</b> 7 <b>is</b> due to Rezvani (2014). Finally, <b>example</b> 8 <b>is</b> from Singh (2015). All the fuzzy numbers in the <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> ranked at α = 0.5 unless otherwise stated, and the reduction ratio used is 0.9.|$|R
5|$|Black swans feature as emblems and decorations on most {{important}} public buildings in Western Australia. An <b>example</b> <b>is</b> {{the tower of}} the Fremantle Town Hall.|$|E
5|$|Excavations have {{uncovered}} examples of metalwork at Zaculeu. These were small ornamental pieces. An <b>example</b> <b>is</b> {{a representation of}} a butterfly worked from tumbaga, an alloy of gold and copper, dated to the Postclassic period.|$|E
5|$|In the Canary Islands {{there was}} also a belief in vampiric beings, here in the form of blood-sucking witch. One such <b>example</b> <b>is</b> {{provided}} by the legend of the Witches of Anaga in Tenerife.|$|E
40|$|We study smooth complex {{projective}} varieties X of maximal Albanese {{dimension and}} of general type satisfying with vanishing holomorphic Euler characteristic. We {{prove that the}} Albanese variety of X has at least three simple factors. <b>Examples</b> <b>were</b> constructed by Ein and Lazarsfeld, and we prove that in dimension 3, these <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> (up to abelian étale covers) the only ones. By results of Ueno, another source of <b>examples</b> <b>is</b> provided by varieties X of maximal Albanese dimension and of general type with p_g(X) = 1. <b>Examples</b> <b>were</b> constructed by Chen and Hacon, and again, we prove that in dimension 3, these <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> (up to abelian étale covers) the only ones. We also formulate a conjecture on the general structure of these varieties in all dimensions...|$|R
30|$|In this section, two design <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> {{presented}} {{to illustrate the}} design process, and three simulation <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> employed to demonstrate the performances of designed wavelets in the applications.|$|R
30|$|Unlike usually random selection, the non-MC <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> {{selected}} {{considering the}} initial detection procedure. That <b>is,</b> the non-MC <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> {{selected from the}} level set segmented regions not containing MC. Thus, the negative <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> specific to the used segmentation method, which is an advantage over the traditional random selection method. There were 4146 (1382 [*]×[*] 3) training examples in total.|$|R
5|$|Many ancient {{standing}} stone monuments were erected {{during the}} prehistoric period, amongst the best-known are Stonehenge, Devil's Arrows, Rudston Monolith and Castlerigg. With {{the introduction of}} Ancient Roman architecture there was a development of basilicas, baths, amphitheaters, triumphal arches, villas, Roman temples, Roman roads, Roman forts, stockades and aqueducts. It was the Romans who founded the first cities and towns such as London, Bath, York, Chester and St Albans. Perhaps the best-known <b>example</b> <b>is</b> Hadrian's Wall stretching right across northern England. Another well-preserved <b>example</b> <b>is</b> the Roman Baths at Bath, Somerset.|$|E
5|$|Many of the twenty-two {{countries}} {{listed here}} typically {{have had a}} long-standing agreement with a former occupying country; one <b>example</b> <b>is</b> the agreement between Monaco and France, which has existed for at least 300 years.|$|E
5|$|Poetry {{can be a}} {{powerful}} vehicle for satire. The Romans had a strong tradition of satirical poetry, often written for political purposes. A notable <b>example</b> <b>is</b> the Roman poet Juvenal's satires.|$|E
50|$|The NF110 was a {{diesel-electric}} locomotive built by General Motors Diesel for narrow gauge service with the Canadian National Railways in Newfoundland (see: Newfoundland Railway). Only nine <b>examples</b> <b>were</b> built between 1952 and 1953, although thirty-eight identical NF210 were later built. The last <b>examples</b> <b>were</b> retired in 1986 and afterwards three <b>examples</b> <b>were</b> preserved in non-operating condition, all located in Newfoundland.|$|R
50|$|The {{first three}} <b>examples</b> above <b>are</b> {{commutative}} {{and all of}} the above <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> associative.|$|R
30|$|In this section, three {{numerical}} <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> {{studied to}} demonstrate {{the accuracy of the}} present method. The <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> computed using Mathematica 5.0. Results obtained by the method are compared with the analytical solution of each <b>example</b> and <b>are</b> found to be in good agreement with each other.|$|R
5|$|The Sun, for <b>example,</b> <b>is</b> {{estimated}} to have increased in luminosity by about 40% since it reached the main sequence 4.6 billion (4.6 × 109) years ago.|$|E
5|$|The {{word for}} Mount in Indonesian and many {{regional}} languages {{of the country}} (such as Javanese) is Gunung. Thus, Mount Merapi for <b>example,</b> <b>is</b> referred to as Gunung Merapi in Indonesian and also in some English-based sites.|$|E
5|$|Titanium(III) and titanium(II) also form stable {{chloride}}s. A notable <b>example</b> <b>is</b> titanium(III) chloride (TiCl3), {{which is}} used as a catalyst for production of polyolefins (see Ziegler-Natta catalyst) and a reducing agent in organic chemistry.|$|E
5000|$|The {{design was}} based on the earlier NF110 {{locomotives}}, also built for CNR in Newfoundland. The engines were some of the very few [...] narrow gauge locomotives in North America. Thirty-eight were built between 1956 and 1960. The last <b>examples</b> <b>were</b> retired in 1990 and afterwards six <b>example</b> <b>were</b> preserved across Newfoundland. Eleven <b>examples</b> <b>were</b> exported to Chile, eight to Nicaragua, and two to Nigeria.|$|R
30|$|Hamming loss. The Hamming loss is {{calculated}} as: FP + FN/∑Total population, and is between 0 and  1, where 0 indicates no <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> incorrectly predicted, and 1 indicates all <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> incorrectly predicted.|$|R
50|$|These {{surfaces}} {{have the}} symmetries of a crystallographic group. Numerous <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> known with cubic, tetragonal, rhombohedral, and orthorhombic symmetries. Monoclinic and triclinic <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> certain to exist, but have proven hard to parametrise.|$|R
5|$|Tungsten {{trioxide}} {{can form}} intercalation compounds with alkali metals. These {{are known as}} bronzes; an <b>example</b> <b>is</b> sodium tungsten bronze.|$|E
5|$|When facing {{world-class}} opponents, Gossip {{more often}} {{fell victim to}} their combinations. A famous <b>example</b> <b>is</b> his loss, also at New York 1889, to Mikhail Chigorin (White), who lost world championship matches to Steinitz in 1889 and 1892.|$|E
5|$|A {{well-documented}} <b>example</b> <b>is</b> {{found in}} the Amish migration to Pennsylvania in 1744. Two {{members of the new}} colony shared the recessive allele for Ellis–van Creveld syndrome. Members of the colony and their descendants tend to be religious isolates and remain relatively insular. As a result of many generations of inbreeding, Ellis-van Creveld syndrome is now much more prevalent among the Amish than in the general population.|$|E
2500|$|One <b>example</b> <b>was</b> {{bought by}} the French navy in March 1912 to equip the {{seaplane}} tender La Foudre, the first seaplane carrier in history. [...] A second <b>example</b> <b>was</b> delivered to the Navy in December 1913.|$|R
50|$|A Gnome-powered <b>example</b> <b>was</b> {{used by the}} Graham White flying {{school at}} Hendon, being used there in 1912. Another Gnome-powered <b>example</b> <b>was</b> entered by Lewis Turner in the 1912 Aerial Derby, but only {{took part in the}} speed trials.|$|R
50|$|The highest {{concentration}} of sand dams with the strongest track record {{is found in}} Kenya although <b>examples</b> <b>are</b> found throughout world’s semi-arid regions from Angola to Zimbabwe.
