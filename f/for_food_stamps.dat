40|$|The <b>Food</b> <b>Stamp</b> Program reduces {{benefits}} to households as their earnings rise. This reduction {{is affected by}} household participation in other Government assistance programs (cross-program effects) and by the wide variation in State-specific reduction rates for earnings in Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). This study shows that, <b>for</b> <b>food</b> <b>stamp</b> recipients who also received cash benefits through TANF in 2005, an extra dollar of earnings led {{to a change in}} <b>food</b> <b>stamp</b> benefits ranging from a reduction of 36 cents to an increase of 9 cents.

Lopez-De La Cruz also assisted farmworkers by translating for them, taking them to the doctors, writing letters, and filling out paperwork for {{those who could not}} write. In addition to her work protesting, organizing, and running the hiring hall; Lopez-De La Cruz acted as an interpreter for farm workers and often testified at hearings on farm labor, pushed <b>for</b> <b>food</b> <b>stamps</b> for farm workers in Fresno, pushed for bilingual education, and was eventually appointed to community and state organizations like the Fresno County Economic Opportunity Commission, the Central California Action Associates (Community education project where she taught English to Farm workers), and California’s Commission on the Status of Women. In 1966 Lopez-De La Cruz volunteered to teach farm workers practical English at the CCAA in an old building on Olive Avenue in Fresno, CA. When the CCAA got a local TV show on Fresno’s Channel 53, Lopez-De La Cruz enthusiastically taught English on the show for a short period that ended when Arnold’s truck broke down. Lopez-De La Cruz also assisted the UFW by consulting as an expert farmworker. In 1971, Delores Huerta reached out to Lopez-De La Cruz to help her negotiate a contract with Christian Brothers Wine Company. Since she was a farm worker and Huerta was not, Lopez-De La Cruz could accurately know how much work was acceptable and for what pay. In 1972 she represented the Christian Brothers Workers at the first convention of the United Farm Workers of America in Fresno.|$|E

This study employs multi-level analytical techniques to conduct an analysis of determinants of <b>Food</b> <b>Stamp</b> Program participation among eligible households in the fifty American states. These techniques are applied to analyze two hierarchical levels of data: household and state. At the household level, an extensive set of demographic characteristics of eligible households are examined. Among major household-level variables, multiple means-tested programs participation is the strongest predictor of <b>Food</b> <b>Stamp</b> Program participation. <b>Food</b> <b>Stamp</b> Program eligible households that receive greater number of means-tested programs participate in the program at dramatically higher probabilities than those that receive fewer. Moreover, multiple means-tested participation is the only household-level determinant that illustrates interstate variations. That is, participation levels among eligible households are different with a given number of means-tested programs, and this number varies among the states. These findings are expanded to include state-level variables that account <b>for</b> <b>Food</b> <b>Stamp</b> Program participation variations at the household level and at the state level. Five state-level variables are used: a ratio of federal matching funds <b>for</b> <b>Food</b> <b>Stamp</b> Program administration, measured by the amount of federal grants <b>for</b> <b>Food</b> <b>Stamp</b> Program administration as a proportion of state welfare budgets; administrative costs per <b>Food</b> <b>Stamp</b> Program case; poverty and nonurban factor; industrialization and employment factor; and political factor. These state-level variables and factors have sizable effects on the <b>Food</b> <b>Stamp</b> Program participation and demonstrate their indicative role in accounting for a large portion of interstate variations. However, there is some room for future research to improve this model by expanding the levels of analysis to include other levels of analysis such as a time-series element or by introducing variables not included in this analysis, especially those representing administrative arrangements at the state level or stigmatization at the household level. While the latter variables may affect the demand of <b>Food</b> <b>Stamp</b> Program beneficiaries, the former variables are highly manipulatable for the purpose of influencing the supply side of <b>Food</b> <b>Stamp</b> Program provision...|$|R

To qualify for these additional federal funds, states must maintain their state-funded expenditures for employment and training at a level no lower than in fiscal year 1996; these additional funds are referred to as maintenance-of-efforts funds. The act requires that at least 80 percent of all employment and training funds be spent on able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWD).
