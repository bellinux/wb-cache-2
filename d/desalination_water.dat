25|$|Water {{supply and}} {{sanitation}} in Saudi Arabia {{is characterized by}} challenges and achievements. One of the main challenges is water scarcity. In order to overcome water scarcity, substantial investments have been undertaken in seawater <b>desalination,</b> <b>water</b> distribution, sewerage and wastewater treatment. Today about 50% of drinking water comes from desalination, 40% from the mining of non-renewable groundwater and only 10% from surface water in the mountainous southwest of the country. The capital Riyadh, located {{in the heart of}} the country, is supplied with desalinated water pumped from the Persian Gulf over a distance of 467km. Water is provided almost for free to residential users. Despite improvements, service quality remains poor, for example in terms of continuity of supply. Another challenge is weak institutional capacity and governance, reflecting general characteristics of the public sector in Saudi Arabia. Among the achievements is a significant increase in desalination, and in access to water, the expansion of wastewater treatment, as well as the use of treated effluent for the irrigation of urban green spaces, and for agriculture.|$|E

50|$|CNT can be {{used for}} <b>desalination.</b> <b>Water</b> {{molecules}} can be separated from salt by forcing them through electrochemically robust nanotube networks with controlled nanoscale porosity. This process requires far lower pressures than conventional reverse osmosis methods. Compared to a plain membrane, it operates at a 20 °C lower temperature, and at a 6x greater flow rate. Membranes using aligned, encapsulated CNTs with open ends permit flow through the CNTs' interiors. Very-small-diameter SWNTs are needed to reject salt at seawater concentrations. Portable filters containing CNT meshes can purify contaminated drinking water. Such networks can electrochemically oxidize organic contaminants, bacteria and viruses.|$|E
50|$|MIKE 3 is a {{computer}} program that simulates flows, cohesive sediments, water quality,and ecology in rivers, lakes, estuaries, bays, coastal areas and seas in three dimensions.

MIKE 3 is widely recognized as the gold standard for environmental and ecological studies. MIKE 3 can be used for assessment of hydrographic conditions for design, construction and operation of structures and plants in stratified waters, environmental impact assessment studies, coastal and oceanographic circulation studies, including fine sediment dynamics, sea ice simulations, lak hydrodynamics, water pollution studies and restoration projects, analysis of cooling water recirculation and <b>desalination,</b> <b>water</b> quality and ecological forecasting, phenomena whenever 3D flow structures is important.|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decade osmotically driven {{membrane}} processes have attracted growing interest in wastewater treatment, desalination and power generation. A hybrid forward osmosis–nanofiltration (FO–NF) system designed for brackish <b>water</b> <b>desalination</b> was systematically investigated in this study. The hybrid FO–NF process was also compared with a stand-alone reverse osmosis (RO) process in brackish <b>water</b> <b>desalination.</b> It is found that the hybrid FO–NF process has many advantages over the stand-alone RO process in brackish <b>water</b> <b>desalination,</b> such as lower hydraulic pressure, less flux decline caused by membrane fouling and higher flux recovery after cleaning. Other benefits like no pre-treatment requirement, higher permeate quality and no need for chemical cleaning in brackish <b>water</b> <b>desalination</b> can also be achieved by the hybrid FO–NF system.

5000|$|Osmosis {{may be used}} {{directly}} to achieve separation of water from a solution containing unwanted solutes. A [...] "draw" [...] solution of higher osmotic pressure than the feed solution is used to induce a net flow of water through a semi-permeable membrane, such that the feed solution becomes concentrated as the draw solution becomes dilute. The diluted draw solution may then be used directly (as with an ingestible solute like glucose), or sent to a secondary separation process {{for the removal of}} the draw solute. This secondary separation can be more efficient than a reverse osmosis process would be alone, depending on the draw solute used and the feedwater treated.

The Plan describes the current status and the environmental and technical issues related to projections of demand and supply, groundwater abstraction, <b>desalination,</b> <b>water</b> supply and sanitation, irrigation, wastewater treatment and Emirati governance and institutions. The government has run a media campaign to encourage people to save water. It has also distributed water-saving toilets and showerheads free of charge.

5000|$|The {{concept of}} a [...] "backstop" [...] {{resource}} is a resource that is sufficiently abundant and sustainable to replace non-renewable resources.

Similarly, Gleick and Palaniappan defined [...] "backstop water sources" [...] to be those resources that can replace unsustainable and non-renewable use of water, albeit typically at a higher cost.The classic backstop water source is desalination of seawater. If the rate of water production is not sufficient in one area, another [...] "backstop" [...] could be increased interbasin transfers, such as pipelines to carry freshwater from where it is abundant to an area where water is needed. Water can be imported into an area using water trucks. The most expensive and last resort measures of getting water to a community such as <b>desalination,</b> <b>water</b> transfers are called “backstop” water sources.

40|$|A {{pilot study}} was {{conducted}} to assess the effect of water quality changes on iron and copper release in distribution systems. Three finished waters were prepared from groundwater source by conventional treatment, lime softening and reverse osmosis (RO). To mimic desalinated seawater, sea salts were added to RO treated water. Both lime softening and RO treatment significantly decreased the calcium concentration and alkalinity of groundwater. During a yearlong investigation, the impact of seasonal changes on iron and copper release was also evaluated. The results showed that groundwater after lime softening slightly increased iron release potential but significantly decreased copper release. <b>Desalination</b> <b>water</b> caused much higher iron release but lower copper release than conventionally treated groundwater. Blended water with conventional groundwater and <b>desalination</b> <b>water</b> resulted in intermediate iron release but much high copper release.
