50|$|Scholars like Raikes (1968) and Suraj Bhan (1972, 1973, 1975, 1977) {{have shown}} that based on archaeological, geomorphic and sedimentological {{research}} the Yamuna may have flowed into the Sarasvati during Harappan times. There are several dried out river beds (paleochannels) between the Sutlej and the Yamuna, some of them two to ten kilometres wide. They are not always visible on the ground because of excessive silting and <b>encroachment</b> <b>by</b> <b>sand</b> of the dried out river channels. The Yamuna may have flowed into the Sarasvati river through the Chautang or the Drishadvati channel, since many Harappan sites have been discovered on these dried out river beds.|$|E
5000|$|When the oratory was abandoned, another church (now {{known as}} St Pirans Old Church, [...] ) was built nearby on the inland {{side of the}} stream. As {{mentioned}} by Carew (above) it was thought the stream would protect the church from <b>encroachment</b> <b>by</b> <b>sand.</b> This {{proved to be the}} case for several hundred years and the church, completed by the 12th century, was enlarged in 1462. However, mining for tin caused the stream to dry up and eventually the church was engulfed by the dunes. The last service was held in 1795 after which the old church was partially dismantled and the materials used to build a new church inland. However, the old churchs graveyard was used for burials until 1835 before sand enveloped it.|$|E
5000|$|For {{approximately}} half its length, from Sloat Boulevard to Lincoln Way, the Great Highway {{is both an}} expressway and a parallel street. The expressway is built atop a raised berm, which overlays a pre-existing wall built to keep the adjacent area clear from frequent <b>encroachment</b> <b>by</b> <b>sand</b> dunes; however due to the strong winds and blowing sand, there are still several days when the Great Highway is closed to traffic each year. Also atop the berm is a gravel jogging path and a cement walking / bicycling path. The parallel street, also named 'Great Highway', is immediately adjacent below and {{to the east of}} the expressway, with buildings on its east side. The only access to the upper-level highway is at each end. There are crosswalks with traffic lights along this section to allow pedestrians to reach the beach.|$|E

5000|$|Encroachment from {{population}} pressure: This widely documented {{phenomenon is}} associated with the ever-increasing use of non-renewable resources.

Encroachment of old age: The process of ageing, and terminal illness, may be experienced as encroaching shadows on human dignity. Equally, while near the peak of their careers, people may note the encroachment of youth and change.|$|R

40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the vulnerability of}} the native Mediterranean pond turtle to <b>encroachment</b> <b>by</b> the invasive red-eared slider in southern Spain. We first obtained an ecogeographical favourability model for the Mediterranean pond turtle. We then modelled the presence/absence of the red-eared slider in the Mediterranean pond turtle range and obtained an encroachment favourability model. We also obtained a favourability model for the red-eared slider using the ecogeographical favourability for the Mediterranean pond turtle as a predictor. When favourability for the Mediterranean pond turtle was high, favourability for the red-eared slider was low, suggesting that in these areas the Mediterranean pond turtle may resist <b>encroachment</b> <b>by</b> the red-eared slider. We also calculated favourability overlap between the two species, which is their simultaneous favourability. Grids with low overlap had higher favourability values for the Mediterranean pond turtle and, consequently, were of lesser conservation concern. A few grids had high values for both species, being potentially suitable for coexistence. Grids with intermediate overlap had similar intermediate favourability values for both species and were therefore areas where the Mediterranean pond turtle was more vulnerable to <b>encroachment</b> <b>by</b> the red-eared slider. We mapped the favourability overlap to provide a map of vulnerability of the Mediterranean pond turtle to <b>encroachment</b> <b>by</b> the red-eared slider.

5000|$|An {{indication}} of early settlement is the Croes Siencyn Incised Stone, a Scheduled monument on Marlas Road, ( [...] , grid ref: SS822823). This is a weathered stone with an incised cross, dated to 11th or 12th century, moved to its present garden location in 1945 from 'between Kenfig and Pyle'. The early expansion of Pyle was brought {{about when the}} ancient borough of Kenfig was abandoned after being overwhelmed <b>by</b> <b>sand</b> during a catastrophic <b>encroachment</b> <b>by</b> the sea in the mid fifteenth-century. The road through Kenfig was diverted {{one and a half}} miles inland and brought Pyle to prominence while Kenfig dwindled into a straggle of a few houses. The walls of Pyle St James' parish church are reputed to have been moved stone by stone from the old town, relocated further inland as the sand encroached. This gave rise to the church sometimes being referred to as the upside-down church, because the first stones moved would have been the higher ones in the original church.|$|R

5000|$|Encroachment from flooding: Construction of {{settlements}} in flood plains, ignoring {{the tendency of}} rivers to flood occasionally, results in situations in which river water encroaches on properties in ways that can prove extremely costly. Here encroachment on flood plains <b>by</b> buildings engenders <b>encroachment</b> <b>by</b> flooding. <b>Encroachment</b> from rising sea levels: This is a more dramatic and permanent example of encroachment from flooding whose major effects are predicted to become evident over the coming decades. It is caused by failure to respond effectively {{to the challenge of}} global warming and rising carbon emissions. Here encroachment on air quality engenders <b>encroachment</b> <b>by</b> rising sea levels.|$|R
