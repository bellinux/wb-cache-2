He awakes to discover that the truck <b>drove</b> <b>by</b> itself with its Navitron Autodrive System. He informs other truck drivers, who inform him that he cannot let anyone know about the Autodrive system because it would make all truck drivers lose their jobs. However, Homer tells the passengers of a passing bus about the system, which causes an angry mob of truckers to go after Homer. But even after the Autodrive system ejects itself from Homer's semi, Homer is able to escape from the angry trucker mob. Homer and Bart arrive in Atlanta to finish Red's shipment on time, and then commandeer a train full of napalm so they can return to Springfield.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Aim {{to conquer}} the low {{efficiency}} of the current auto-CVT actuated by hydraulic system, a new design was proposed based on {{the analysis of the}} energy loss, which used compounded disc spring clamp set and motorized actuation system. Through the special design of the compounded disc spring and the balance spring, the axial thrust was well counterpoised, thus it achieved the result that the actuation system could be <b>droved</b> <b>by</b> low power motor. The test results show that the CVT developed according to the new design can reduce the power consumption obviously and improve the power performance...|$|R

25|$|The Duke boys added {{a custom}} air horn to the General Lee that played the first twelve {{notes of the}} song Dixie. The Dixie horn was not {{originally}} planned, until a Georgia local hot rod racer <b>drove</b> <b>by</b> and sounded his car's Dixie horn. The producers immediately rushed after him asking where he had bought the horn. Warner Bros. purchased several Chargers for stunts, as they generally destroyed at least one or two cars per episode. By {{the end of the}} show's sixth season, the Chargers were becoming harder to find, and more expensive. In addition, the television series Knight Rider began to rival the General Lee's stunts. As such, the producers used 1:8 scale miniatures, filmed by Jack Sessums' crew, or recycled stock jump footage — the latter being a practice that had been in place to an extent since the second season, and had increased as the seasons passed.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, Shoghi Effendi, {{the head}} of the Bahá'í Faith, planned an {{international}} teaching plan termed the Ten Year Crusade.

During the plan Ali Nakhjavani and his wife <b>drove</b> <b>by</b> car with two African pioneers from Uganda where the religion was growing very quickly to open new countries to the religion. The first pioneer in the region was Max Kinyerezi October 6 who settled in what was then French Equatorial Africa, and then Enoch Olinga to British Cameroon on October 15. In Limbe (then called Victoria), through the efforts of Olinga, Jacob Tabot Awo converted to the religion becoming the first Cameroonian Bahá'í. During the following year there were many converts to the religion, many of whom were from the Basel Mission system of Protestant Christians. Meherangiz Munsiff, a young Indian woman, arrived in French Cameroon in April 1954 in Douala after helping to found the Bahá'í Faith in Madagascar. A letter from Olinga describes the advancement of the religion into 6 towns and translation work into the Duala language had begun of a pamphlet.|$|E
500|$|Gary Rydstrom and {{his team}} at Skywalker Sound were hired for the film's sound production. Like Howard, Rydstrom {{employed}} different sounds for the two cultures. Focusing on the machine and mechanical sounds of the early industrial era for the explorers, {{he felt that the}} Atlanteans should have a [...] "more organic" [...] sound utilizing ceramics and pottery. The sound made by the Atlantean flying-fish vehicles posed a particular challenge. Rydstrom revealed that he was sitting at the side of a highway recording one day when a semi-truck <b>drove</b> <b>by</b> at high speed. When the recording was sped up on his computer he felt it sounded very organic, and that is what is heard within the film. Rydstrom created the harmonic chiming of the Heart of Atlantis by rubbing his finger along the edge of a champagne flute, and the sound of sub-pods moving through water with a water pick.|$|E

On Martha's Vineyard, electronic stores reported their best business sales in years, with supplies of D-batteries being cleaned off the shelves. Many residents purchased these as well as battery-powered radios and flashlights. President George H. W. Bush, staying at his home in Kennebunkport, Maine, evacuated to Pease Air Force Base in New Hampshire. To avoid possible risks by using helicopter, he <b>drove</b> <b>by</b> motorcade to the base. During this time, portions of Interstate 95 were closed to allow him direct access to the Air Force base; however, this created many miles of backup as {{thousands of}} residents moved inland. Eight shelters were opened in New Hampshire, and about 5,200people – mostly tourists – evacuated the coastline.

500|$|The {{episode was}} storyboarded by artist Anthony Williams. Davies offered Edgar Wright the {{opportunity}} to direct the episode, but Wright was forced to decline, as he was still working on Shaun of the Dead. Instead, the episode was directed by Keith Boak. [...] "Rose" [...] began filming in July 2004, {{as part of the}} first production block alongside episodes four and five. The first five days were spent filming in London, while the rest was filmed in Cardiff. The production team was given permission to add more lights to the London Eye. For the scene in which the Doctor and Rose are running through London, careful timing was undertaken by the production team because they wanted a London bus to travel behind them, but this had to be accomplished by waiting for a bus to come. In other scenes filmed in Cardiff, a London bus and a van of the London Evening Standard <b>drove</b> <b>by</b> to give the illusion of London. The exterior of Rose's council estate was filmed at a London estate as well as a Cardiff one in other scenes. Mickey's flat is the same set as the Tyler's, just redecorated. The production team sought to film the Cardiff scenes in secrecy, but the day before they began the Cardiff Council issued a press release naming the streets where they would be filming. The Autons' attack during the climax was filmed on Working Street, Cardiff from 20 to 22 July 2004. with scenes set around major London landmarks like the London Eye being the exception. Henrik's, where Rose works, is actually the department store Howells, and the pizza restaurant is La Fosse. It took the production team a while to find a restaurant that would require minimal set dressing but would be willing to close for a day. The street where Rose joins the Doctor is St David's Market, while service tunnels {{in the basement of a}} hospital in Cardiff were used for the basement of Henrik's where Rose is menaced by Autons. Studio filming mainly took place from August to October 2004.|$|E
