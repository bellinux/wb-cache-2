By 1936 the Māori figure was 82,326, although the sudden rise in the 1930s was {{probably due to the}} introduction of the <b>family</b> <b>benefit</b> − payable only when a birth was registered, according to Professor Poole. Despite a substantial level of intermarriage between the Māori and European populations, many ethnic Māori retained their cultural identity.

Sold it was, however, and carried away in a van; except the bed, a few chairs, and the kitchen table. With these possessions we encamped, as it were, in the two parlours of the emptied house in Windsor Terrace; Mrs. Micawber, the children, the Orfling, and myself; and lived in those rooms night and day. I have no idea for how long, though {{it seems to me}} for a long time. At last Mrs. Micawber resolved to move into the prison, where Mr. Micawber had now secured a room to himself. So I took the key of the house to the landlord, who was very glad to get it; and the beds were sent over to the King's Bench, except mine, for which a little room was hired outside the walls in the neighbourhood of that Institution, very much to my satisfaction, since the Micawbers and I had become too used to one another, in our troubles, to part. The Orfling was likewise accommodated with an inexpensive lodging in the same neighbourhood. Mine was a quiet back-garret with a sloping roof, commanding a pleasant prospect of a timberyard; and when I took possession of it, with the reflection that Mr. Micawber's troubles had come to a crisis at last, I thought it quite a paradise.|$|E

Four types of <b>family</b> <b>benefits</b> including eight distinctive categories are analysed: child-benefit, child care allowances, child-raising allowances, and other benefits (birth and adoption grants, allowance for single parents, special allowances for children with disabilities, advance payments for maintenance and other allowances). The paper is based on primary and secondary analysis of 28 sets of national data provided through the European Union's Mutual Information System on Social Protection (MISSOC). Three categories of member states are considered: founder member states of the EU, other “old” member states, and the new Central and Eastern ones. Chronological development of national regulations with impact on <b>family</b> <b>benefits</b> is analysed in connection with the moment of becoming a member state. Various forms of <b>family</b> <b>benefits</b> legislation and their main subjects of interest are further researched. The last part of the article looks at the coverage of <b>family</b> <b>benefits.</b> Seven member states operate in this respect based on regulations adopted before EU accession. Belgium, Finland, and Lithuania have the “most preserved” family regulations per category of member states. The first three topics of family regulations are: child, family, and allowance / benefit. The most frequently provided <b>family</b> <b>benefits</b> are: birth and adoption grants, and special allowance for children with disabilities.

40|$|Abstract Background Many OECD {{countries}} have replied to economic recessions with an adaption in public spending on social <b>benefits</b> for <b>families</b> {{and young people}} in need. So far, no study has examined the impact of public social spending during the recent economic recession on health, and social inequalities in health among young people. This study investigates whether an increase in public spending relates to a lower prevalence in health complaints and buffers health inequalities among adolescents. Methods Data {{were obtained from the}} 2009 / 2010 “Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) ” study comprising 11 – 15 -year-old adolescents from 27 European countries (N[*]=[*] 144, 754). Socioeconomic position was measured by the Family Affluence Scale (FAS). Logistic multilevel models were conducted for the association between the absolute rate of public spending on <b>family</b> <b>benefits</b> per capita in 2010 and the relative change rate in <b>family</b> <b>benefits</b> (2006 – 2010) in relation to adolescent psychological health complaints in 2009 / 2010. Results The absolute rate of public spending on <b>family</b> <b>benefits</b> in 2010 did not show a significant association with adolescents’ psychological health complaints. Relative change rates of public spending on <b>family</b> <b>benefits</b> (2006 – 2010) were related to better health. Greater socioeconomic inequalities in psychological health complaints were found for countries with higher change rates in public spending on <b>family</b> <b>benefits</b> (2006 – 2010). Conclusions The results partially support our hypothesis and highlight that policy initiatives in terms of an increase in <b>family</b> <b>benefits</b> might partially benefit adolescent health, but tend to widen social inequalities in adolescent health during the recent recession...|$|R
