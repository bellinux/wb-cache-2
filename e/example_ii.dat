5000|$|... "Onward, Christian Soldiers" [...] is a 19th-century English hymn. The {{words were}} written by Sabine Baring-Gould in 1865, and the music was {{composed}} by Arthur Sullivan in 1871.

In a more informal tone sometimes the particle -no (...) is added instead to show a personal interest of the speaker: Dōshite konai-no? [...] "Why arent (you) coming?".

40|$|Given a {{directed}} {{graphical model}} with binary-valued hidden nodes and real-valued noisy observations, consider deciding upon the maximum a-posteriori (MAP) or the maximum posterior-marginal (MPM) assignment under the restriction that each node broadcasts only to its children exactly one single-bit message. We present a variational formulation, viewing the processing rules local to all nodes as degrees-of-freedom, that minimizes the loss in expected (MAP or MPM) performance subject to such online communication constraints. The approach {{leads to a}} novel message-passing algorithm to be executed offline, or before observations are realized, which mitigates the performance loss by iteratively coupling all rules in a manner implicitly driven by global statistics. We also provide (i) illustrative <b>examples,</b> (<b>ii)</b> assumptions that guarantee convergence and efficiency and (iii) connections to active research areas. ...|$|R

50|$|Similar is {{the case}} in the example below:In the <b>example</b> <b>ii,</b> like in example i, in Gujarati {{language}} ‘who (nominative)’ meaning “I” and ‘me (ergative)’ meaning “I” but in LDA, they use ‘me’ meaning “I” in both the cases. Also in Urdu Language “mE” and in Persian Language “man” meaning “I” is used in both the cases. Thus due to the contact of Urdu and Persian language and metaphorical extension they have dropped the word ‘who’ meaning “I” and have adopted the word ‘me’ meaning “I” to explain both the senses I (nominative) and I (ergative). Thus from example i and ii, we can observe the impact of Urdu and Persian language on Gujarati Language through metaphorical extension.|$|E
50|$|As {{noted above}} the {{exhaustive}} ballot {{is similar to}} the two-round system. However under the two-round system if no candidate achieves an absolute majority in the first round then, rather than just a single candidate being eliminated, all candidates are immediately excluded except the two with the most votes. There is then a second and final round. Because, at most, it requires voters to return to the polls only once, the two-round system is considered more practical for large public elections than the exhaustive ballot, and is used in many countries for the election of presidents and legislative bodies. However the two systems often produce different winners. This is because, under the two-round system, a candidate may be eliminated in the first round who would have gone on to win the contest if they had been permitted to survive to the second round. In Example I above the winner would not have changed if the two rounds system had been used instead of the exhaustive ballot. However, in <b>Example</b> <b>II</b> the two round system would have elected Nashville instead of Knoxville.|$|E
50|$|Like {{virtually}} all electoral systems (see the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem), the contingent vote {{is open to}} tactical voting. In particular, like both the two-round system and instant-runoff voting, it is vulnerable to the tactics of 'push-over' and 'compromise'. Under the contingent vote, compromising occurs where a voter gives a first or other high preference to a candidate not because they necessarily support them, but {{as a way of}} avoiding the election of a candidate who they dislike even more. The contingent vote is more vulnerable to compromising than IRV. In the first example given in this article, if a large number of Catherine supporters had 'compromised', and given a first preference to Brian, then Brian would have been elected instead of Andrew, a candidate whom Catherine supporters dislike even more. This tactic would have been effective under IRV as well as the contingent vote. In <b>Example</b> <b>II,</b> Brad supporters, had they predicted that Brad would not make it to the second round, could have compromised by giving their first preferences to Carter, and thereby have ensured his election. This would not have been a necessary tactic under IRV because the votes of Brad supporters would have ended up with Carter anyway—when Brad was eliminated they would have transferred to him.|$|E
