500|$|... "What's Your Name" [...] is an midtempo electro song, and bases its melody on {{thrusting}} new wave-influenced synths. It {{contains a}} [...] "whimsical" [...] beat that utilizes sirens and wind instruments. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune compared the song's synth riff {{to the music}} that was popular during the 1980s MTV generation, while John Soeder from The Plain Dealer noted its similarity to British duo the Eurythmics. Usher monotonously repeats the pick-up line hook, [...] "What's your name?", and thereby pays homage to his bachelor history. The song's lyrics describe [...] "the feeling you <b>get</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> run into a woman that makes you speak gibberish".|$|E
500|$|BBC News {{reported}} that [...] "According to , his storyboard led to delays, disputes over broadcast standards and a threatened walk {{out by the}} animation department." [...] However, Al Jean disputed this, saying [...] " [...] didn't walk out. Obviously they didn't. We've depicted the conditions in a fanciful light before." [...] Commenting on hiring Banksy to create the titles, Jean joked, [...] "This is what you <b>get</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> outsource." [...] Although conceding {{to the fact that}} The Simpsons is largely animated in South Korea, Jean went on to state that the scenes shown in titles are [...] "very fanciful, far-fetched. None of the things he depicts are true. That statement should be self-evident, but I will emphatically state it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{novel is}} narrated {{in the first}} person through a series of [...] nine journaux intimes, kept by Mountstuart from age 17 until shortly before his death at 85. French {{literary}} journals, always published posthumously, are often extremely candid accounts, particularly of the author's sexual life. Boyd, himself a francophile, includes masturbation, prostitution and Mountstuart's three marriages. While Boyd had earlier written work in the form of memoir or biography, a journal is different: [...] "For a start, it's written without the benefit of hindsight, so there isn't the same feeling you <b>get</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> look back and add shape to a life. There are huge chunks missing." [...] The novel's grounding in everyday life and focus on characterisation place it firmly within realism.|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "A superb episode. Some colorful background for Homer and Marge (and a glimpse of Homer and Barney's schooldays) plus our introduction {{to the world of}} the McBain films. Excellent." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson thought the episode was a [...] "fine program", and added that Lovitz made Artie [...] "amusingly annoying". Jacobson thought the episode captured the [...] "tone of the mid-Seventies with warmth and insight", and the courtship [...] "seemed charming but not sappy, and the show worked well overall." [...] Jacobson's favorite line of the episode was Grampa's advice to Homer about Marge, [...] "Oh, son, don’t overreach! Go for the dented car, the dead-end job, the less attractive girl!" [...] When Homer arrives at the Bouvier house to pick up Marge for the prom, Selma tells Patty [...] "Marge's dates get homelier all the time," [...] to which Patty replies [...] "That's what you <b>get</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> don't put out." [...] Dawn Taylor of The DVD Journal thought these were the best lines of the episode. IGN ranked Lovitz as the eighth best guest star in the show's history.|$|E
500|$|Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly {{coined the}} song as [...] "thumping" [...] {{and said that}} [...] "Brown and guest Justin Bieber trade verses assuring their ladies of their dedication." [...] Joanne Dorken of MTV News UK said [...] "It seems that {{everything}} Justin Bieber touches turns to gold at the moment and this cutesy ballad is no exception." [...] Dorken complimented how well the song showed the blending of the pair's voices, and she commented, as [...] "the most 'pop' song on the LP, we are hoping Chris decides {{to make this a}} single... a sure fire hit." [...] Nadia Noir of WNOW-FM wrote, [...] "What do you <b>get</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> combine two of pop's best-looking/greatest dancers, the sexy rasp of Justin Bieber, and a dance-jam/love-song? A combination of all the best elements of music!" [...] Nick Levine of BBC Music said the track was part of Brown's identity crisis on the album, as [...] "Next to You" [...] was just two tracks after the [...] "grisly sex jam" [...] of [...] "Wet the Bed" [...] featuring Ludacris. Levine called the collaboration a [...] "wholesome-as-homemade-chutney hook-up." [...] While complementing that the album had [...] "something for everyone", Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone called [...] "Next to You" [...] a [...] "puppy-love declaration." [...] Bri LaPelusa called the song a [...] "dreamy ballad" [...] and said it melted Brown and Bieber's [...] "angelic" [...] voices. She went on to add that [...] "Next to You" [...] "might be affirmation that Chris Brown is once again an accepted celebrity." ...|$|E
2500|$|Not all of {{the songs}} are mid-tempo or ballads, Bangladesh also {{produced}} a song called [...] "Let Me Go" [...] which Hammp described as an [...] "up-tempo club song." [...] On the chorus, Norwood sings [...] "You know how I <b>get</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> let me go", {{and later in the}} song she makes reference to Twitter and her mother. The song interpolates [...] "Tonight" [...] by Swedish pop singer Lykke Li. Deluxe edition bonus track [...] "Can You Hear Me Now?”, producer Danja's sole contribution on Two Eleven, works up an extended musical foreplay around a single mind-numbing groove. Built around an instrumental that was originally produced for Diddy – Dirty Money's 2010 album Last Train to Paris, it was re-constructed by Love for Norwood. Danja used heavy vocoding during production of the song.|$|E

2500|$|In another {{interview}} Cedric elaborated on the kidnapping/vanishing themes, saying [...] "Lyrically, I {{wanted to}} incorporate elements of traditional songs. So {{that it would}} sound like our world had these handed down, traditional songs that were to do with real random vanishings and kidnappings. That {{is a big part}} of Latin culture. People get kidnapped all the time. I wanted to cover everything. Right from the exhilarating feeling you <b>get</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> put the ransom note down, the adrenaline rush when you realise a loved one has been taken from you, followed by that bleak, dismal area of not knowing what to do. Especially if you don't come from money. We had two friends that we knew from Texas who just randomly vanished. We've never known whether they just took off or if they met foul play. I found it an interesting subject matter to tackle. I wanted the lyrics to instil that bleak feeling you can get from living somewhere like El Paso. Even though I haven't lived at home for ages, it's still with me. The stories that come from across the border still hit home really hard. I just wanted to have a soundtrack for that really." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Algerian police used {{night vision}} devices to {{identify}} the lead hijacker, Abdul Abdullah Yahia. The government sent his mother to plead for her son to release the passengers, hoping that her pleas would cause Yahia to give in. The tactic backfired. Zahida Kakachi, a passenger, said that Yahia became enraged by the attempt. The hijackers began to target the French passengers; two staff members of the Embassy of France in Algeria, a secretary and a chef, were on board. The hijackers used the chef, Yannick Beugnet, by having him plead in the microphone. The hijackers demanded that if the Algerian government did not let the A300 take off before 9:30pm, the hijackers would kill one passenger every 30 minutes, starting with Beugnet. They threatened to shoot him and throw {{him out of the}} door. The French diplomat said that the Algerians assured them that the hijackers were bluffing while the French demanded that the aircraft be allowed to take off. When the deadline passed, the hijackers fatally shot the chef. The door open warning light in the cockpit indicated to the pilots that another passenger had been murdered. Enraged, Captain Delhemme yelled at the Algerian authorities, saying [...] "see what you <b>get</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> play tough?!". The airline knew that the chef was murdered since it listened to the conversations between the aircraft and the control tower. Philippe Legorjus, a former Air France security adviser, {{said in an interview that}} the airline employees [...] "lived through" [...] the event [...] "with great emotion." [...] Passenger Zahida Kakachi recalls Lotfi calmly converting two stewardesses to Islam, herself and another woman, though Kakachi was only pretending so that she would not enrage or upset Lotfi.|$|E

[...] "I was speaking of {{what you would have}} to go through if you aimed at becoming a real artist--if you took music and the drama as a higher vocation in which you would strive after excellence. On that head, what I have said stands fast. You would find--after your education in doing things slackly for one-and-twenty years--great difficulties in study; you would find mortifications in the treatment you would <b>get</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> presented yourself on the footing of skill. You would be subjected to tests; people would no longer feign not to see your blunders. You would at first only be accepted on trial. You would have to bear what I may call a glaring insignificance: any success must be won by the utmost patience. You would have to keep your place in a crowd, and after all it is likely you would lose it and get out of sight. If you determine to face these hardships and still try, you will have the dignity of a high purpose, even though you may have chosen unfortunately. You will have some merit, though you may win no prize. You have asked my judgment on your chances of winning. I don't pretend to speak absolutely; but measuring probabilities, my judgment is:--you will hardly achieve more than mediocrity." ...|$|E

But I have never seen {{painting}} which made so deep an impression upon me. <i Tenez>, I had just the same feeling as when I went to the Sistine Chapel in Rome. There too I was awed by the greatness {{of the man who}} had painted that ceiling. It was genius, and it was stupendous and overwhelming. I felt small and insignificant. But you are prepared for the greatness of Michael Angelo. Nothing had prepared me for the immense surprise of these pictures in a native hut, far away from civilisation, in a fold of the mountain above Taravao. And Michael Angelo is sane and healthy. Those great works of his have the calm of the sublime; but here, notwithstanding beauty, was something troubling. I do not know what it was. It made me uneasy. It gave me the impression you <b>get</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are sitting next door to a room that you know is empty, but in which, you know not why, you have a dreadful consciousness that notwithstanding there is someone. You scold yourself; you know it is only your nerves -- and yet, and yet... In a little while it is impossible to resist the terror that seizes you, and you are helpless in the clutch of an unseen horror. Yes; I confess I was not altogether sorry when I heard that those strange masterpieces had been destroyed." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{like to hear}} Mr. Rogers complimented. I am not stingy in {{compliments}} to him myself. Why, I did it to-day when I {{sent his}} wife a telegram to comfort her. That {{is the kind of}} person I am. I knew she would be uneasy about him. I knew she would be solicitous about what he might do down here, so I did it to quiet her and to comfort her. I said he was doing well for a person out of practice. There is nothing like it. He is like I used to be. There were times when I was careless--careless in my dress when I got older. You know how uncomfortable your wife can <b>get</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are going away without her superintendence. Once when my wife could not go with me (she always went with me when she could--I always did meet that kind of luck), I was going to Washington once, a long time ago, in Mr. Cleveland's first administration, and she could not go; but, in her anxiety that I should not desecrate the house, she made preparation. She knew that there was to be a reception of those authors at the White House at seven o'clock in the evening. She said, [...] "If I should tell you now what I want to ask of you, you would forget it before you get to Washington, and, therefore, I have written it on a card, and you will find it in your dress--vest pocket when you are dressing at the Arlington--when you are dressing to see the President." [...] I never thought of it again until I was dressing, and I felt in that pocket and took it out, and it said, in a kind of imploring way, [...] "Don't wear your arctics in the White House." ...|$|E
