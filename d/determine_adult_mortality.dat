40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the entomopathogenic activity of Fusarium avenaceum (strain 10 A) against adults of Sitophilus oryzae infesting wheat grain. Bioassays were carried out to <b>determine</b> the <b>adult</b> <b>mortality</b> of S. oryzae when the conidial suspension of the fungus strain was applied using three types of fungus treatment. Results obtained have indicated significant differences (P= 0. 05) in the mean percentage of <b>adult</b> <b>mortality</b> due to the treatment with the fungus compared to the control. The highest mean percentage of <b>adult</b> <b>mortality</b> was obtained by the direct spraying of S. oryzae adults with the fungus conidial suspension before introduction of the treated adults into pots containing wheat grain; the lowest mean percentage of <b>adult</b> <b>mortality</b> was obtained by spraying the inner surfaces of pots with the fungus conidial suspension before introducing the grain and insects. This study demonstrated the typical growth of F. avenaceum on the outer surfaces of the dead treated adults of S. oryzae. Presence of the external fungus growth on the dead insects indicated that the death of S. oryzae adults was attributed to the fungus infection. Results obtained in the present paper represent the first record of efficacy of F. avenaceum against a coleopteran stored-grain insect, mainly including S. oryzae...|$|R

This article estimates the impact of AIDS-related <b>adult</b> <b>mortality</b> on primary school attendance in rural Kenya using a panel of 1, 266 households surveyed in 1997, 2000, and 2002. The paper distinguishes between effects on boys’ and girls’ education to understand potential gender differences resulting from <b>adult</b> <b>mortality.</b> We also estimate how <b>adult</b> <b>mortality</b> affects child schooling before as well as after the death occurs. The paper also estimates the importance of households’ initial asset levels in influencing the relationship between <b>adult</b> <b>mortality</b> and child school attendance. We find {{that all of these}} distinctions are important when estimating the magnitude of the effects of <b>adult</b> <b>mortality</b> on child school attendance. The probability that girls in initially poor households will remain in school prior to the death of a working age adult in the household drops from roughly 88 % to 55 %. Boys in relatively poor households are less likely than girls to be in school after an adult death. By contrast, we find no clear effects on girls’ or boys’ education among relatively non-poor households, either before or after the timing of <b>adult</b> <b>mortality</b> in the household. We find a strong correlation between working-age <b>adult</b> <b>mortality</b> in our data and lagged HIV-prevalence rates at nearby sentinel survey sites.

One readily available resource is household survey data. While birth histories collected in surveys have produced reasonable estimates of child mortality, the use of sibling survival data collected in similar household surveys has not been comprehensively analysed, largely because of concerns of underreporting. Methods This paper uses sibling survival schedules from 29 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) to generate estimates of under- 5 mortality and of the summary measure of <b>adult</b> <b>mortality</b> 45 q 15 -the probability of dying between ages 15 and 59.

A {{longitudinal}} dataset {{was used}} to investigate <b>adult</b> <b>mortality</b> in rural South Africa {{in order to determine}} location, trends, high impact determinants and policy implications. Adult (15 - 59 years) mortality data for the period 1993 - 2010 were extracted from the health and demographic surveillance system in the rural sub-district of Agincourt.

It was found that <b>adult</b> <b>mortality</b> significantly increased over time with a reduction observed late in the study period. Non-communicable disease mortality appeared to increase and decrease in parallel with communicable mortality, whilst deaths due to external causes remained constant. Male gender, unemployment, circular (labour) migrant status, age and gender of household heads, partner and/or other household death, low education and low household socio-economic status were identified as significant and highly attributable determinants of <b>adult</b> <b>mortality.</b> Health facility remoteness was a risk for <b>adult</b> <b>mortality</b> and households falling outside a critical buffering zone were identified.

The need to reliably monitor the impact of such intervention programs in countries has led to significant advances in demographic methods and data sources, particularly with large-scale, cross-national survey programs such as the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). Although no comparable effort has been undertaken for <b>adult</b> <b>mortality,</b> the availability of large datasets with information on adult survival from censuses and household surveys offers an important opportunity to dramatically improve our knowledge about levels and trends in <b>adult</b> <b>mortality</b> in countries without good vital registration. To date, attempts to measure <b>adult</b> <b>mortality</b> from questions in censuses and surveys have generally led to implausibly low levels of <b>adult</b> <b>mortality</b> owing to biases inherent in survey data such as survival and recall bias.

The probabilities of a man or woman dying by the age of 70 years in high-mortality districts was 62 % and 54 %, respectively, whereas the probability of a man or woman dying by the age of 70 years in low-mortality districts was 40 % and 30 %, respectively. The roughly 10 -year survival gap between high-mortality and low-mortality districts was nearly as extreme as the survival gap between the entire Indian population and people living in high-income countries. <b>Adult</b> <b>mortality</b> risks at ages 15 – 69 years was highest in east India and lowest in west India, by contrast with the north–south divide for {{child mortality}}. Vascular disease, tuberculosis, malaria and other infections, and respiratory diseases accounted for about 60 % of the absolute gap in <b>adult</b> <b>mortality</b> risk at ages 15 – 69 years between high-mortality and low-mortality districts.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundAs child {{mortality}} decreases rapidly worldwide, premature <b>adult</b> <b>mortality</b> {{is becoming an}} increasingly important contributor to global mortality. Any possible worldwide reduction of premature <b>adult</b> <b>mortality</b> {{before the age of}} 70 years will depend on progress in India. Indian districts increasingly have responsibility for implementing public health programmes. We aimed to assess age-specific and sex-specific <b>adult</b> <b>mortality</b> risks in India at the district level. MethodsWe analysed data from five national surveys of 0 · 27 million adult deaths at an age of 15 – 69 years together with 2014 demographic data to estimate age-specific and sex-specific <b>adult</b> <b>mortality</b> risks for 597 districts. Cause of death data were drawn from the verbal autopsies in the Registrar General of India's ongoing Million Death Study. FindingsIn 2014, about two-fifths of India's men aged 15 – 69 years lived in the 253 districts where the conditional probability of a man dying at these ages exceeded 50 %, and {{more than a third of}} India's women aged 15 – 69 years lived in the 222 districts where the conditional probability of a woman dying exceeded 40 %. The probabilities of a man or woman dying by the age of 70 years in high-mortality districts was 62 % and 54 %, respectively, whereas the probability of a man or woman dying by the age of 70 years in low-mortality districts was 40 % and 30 %, respectively.

30|$|When {{considering}} {{all of the}} methods, male <b>adult</b> <b>mortality</b> was higher than female mortality, as expected, {{with the exception of}} the direct siblinghood estimates which showed higher mortality for females in Mali, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. For the widowhood method, notable differences were observed in Mali, Cameroon, and South Sudan, where results are inconclusive. The indirect siblinghood method yielded slightly higher, yet comparable, <b>adult</b> <b>mortality</b> estimates to those derived by the orphanhood method up to 2005 for most countries. However, <b>adult</b> <b>mortality</b> estimates using the widowhood method remain lowest and underestimated for all the countries in SSA. Generally, after 2005, the indirect siblinghood method tends to show a rise in the trend of both male and female <b>adult</b> <b>mortality</b> rates which is unexpected, given the fact that a number of these countries in SSA had introduced antiretroviral therapy (ART) programmes between 2003 and 2005 to help reduce <b>adult</b> <b>mortality.</b> The possible explanation for this upward trend is that, generally, indirect methods are not sensitive to changes in mortality in the short term (Timaeus 2013 b; Boerma et al. 1992). In addition, biases in the reporting of siblings contribute to the observed pattern of mortality estimates. The omission of dead siblings by older respondents biases the mortality estimates downwards at older ages, thus suggesting that <b>adult</b> <b>mortality</b> increased when compared to reports by younger siblings. Therefore, more deaths are reported in the recent period than previously. The direct siblinghood <b>adult</b> <b>mortality</b> rates were lower than those obtained from the indirect siblinghood method before smoothing. Generally, scholars (Adetunji 1996; Preston 1985) have found that indirect methods yield higher mortality estimates than direct methods. The differences have been attributed to data errors, violation of assumptions, and internal biases within the methods.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Health inequities in {{developing}} countries are difficult to eradicate because of limited resources. The neglect of <b>adult</b> <b>mortality</b> in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is a particular concern. Advances in data availability, software and analytic methods have created opportunities to address this challenge and tailor interventions to small areas. This study demonstrates how a generic framework {{can be applied to}} guide policy interventions to reduce <b>adult</b> <b>mortality</b> in high risk areas. The framework, therefore, incorporates the spatial clustering of <b>adult</b> <b>mortality,</b> estimates the impact of a range of determinants and quantifies the impact of their removal to ensure optimal returns on scarce resources. METHODS: Data from a national cross-sectional survey in 2007 were used to illustrate the use of the generic framework for SSA and elsewhere. <b>Adult</b> <b>mortality</b> proportions were analyzed at four administrative levels and spatial analyses were used to identify areas with significant excess mortality. An ecological approach was then used to assess the relationship between mortality "hotspots" and various determinants. Population attributable fractions were calculated to quantify the reduction in mortality as a result of targeted removal of high-impact determinants. RESULTS: Overall <b>adult</b> <b>mortality</b> rate was 145 per 10, 000. Spatial disaggregation identified a highly non-random pattern and 67 significant high risk local municipalities were identified. The most prominent determinants of <b>adult</b> <b>mortality</b> included HIV antenatal sero-prevalence, low SES and lack of formal marital union status. The removal of the most attributable factors, based on local area prevalence, suggest that overall <b>adult</b> <b>mortality</b> could be potentially reduced by ∼ 90 deaths per 10, 000. CONCLUSIONS: The innovative use of secondary data and advanced epidemiological techniques can be combined in a generic framework to identify and map mortality to the lowest administration level. The identification of high risk mortality determinants allows health authorities to tailor interventions at local level. This approach can be replicated elsewhere...|$|R

The World Health Organization (2016) <b>adult</b> <b>mortality</b> estimates are for the period 1990 – 2013 and were derived from life tables constructed using United Nations World Population Prospects data. Whereas, the United Nations Population Division <b>adult</b> <b>mortality</b> estimates are for the period 1990 – 2010 and were derived from life tables based on smoothed projected population by age and sex data for the World Population Prospects (United Nations 2014). The <b>adult</b> <b>mortality</b> rates by Reniers et al.
