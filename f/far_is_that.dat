5|$|The {{limitation}} of the argument so <b>far</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it only shows {{the existence of a}} necessary existent, and that is different from showing the existence of God as worshipped in Islam. An atheist might agree that a necessary existent exists, but it could be the universe itself, or there could be many necessary existents, none of which is God. Avicenna is aware of this limitation, and his works contains numerous arguments to show the necessary existent must have the attributes associated with God identified in Islam.|$|E

[...] He also commented: [...] "One intriguing thing about the series so <b>far</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> some of the scenarios have been rather adult for a show broadcast at 6pm.

Another featured Cerberus doing what all dogs do (no matter how many heads they have) and urinate on a motorbike – well, half man-half motorbike." ...|$|E

He explained that [...] "when you're playing a character of solid blackness, {{that in itself is}} very interesting, {{in the sense that you}} have no other motivation other than the accumulation of power. It's not so much about not having a moral center, it's just that the only thing that mattered is increasing power."

500|$|Mikhail Gorbachev, then General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, said, [...] "The {{main reason}} {{that there has}} been no {{national}} consolidation so <b>far</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Comrade Karmal is hoping to continue sitting in Kabul with our help." [...] Karmal's position became less secure when the Soviet leadership began blaming him for the failures in Afghanistan. Gorbachev, worried over the situation, told the Soviet Politburo [...] "If we don't change approaches , we will be fighting there for another 20 or 30 years." [...] It is not clear when the Soviet leadership began to campaign for Karmal's dismissal, but Andrei Gromyko discussed the possibility of Karmal's resignation with Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, the Secretary-General of the United Nations in 1982. While it was Gorbachev who would dismiss Karmal, {{there may have been a}} consensus within the Soviet leadership in 1983 that Karmal should resign. Gorbachev's own plan was to replace Karmal with Mohammad Najibullah, who had joined the PDPA at its creation. Najibullah was thought highly of by Yuri Andropov, Boris Ponomarev and Dmitriy Ustinov, and negotiations for his succession may have started in 1983. Najibullah was not the Soviet leadership's only choice for Karmal's succession; a GRU report noted that the majority of the PDPA leadership would support Assadullah Sarwari's ascension to leadership. According to the GRU, Sarwari was a better candidate as he could balance between the Pashtuns, Tajiks and Uzbeks; Najibullah was a Pashtun nationalist. Another viable candidate was Abdul Qadir, who had been a participant in the Saur Revolution.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a rather}} {{different}} notice written in 1350, Ludolph of Sudheim, a parish priest from Westphalia, correctly {{refers to the}} Pyramids as sepulchers, and says [...] "these tombs are called by the natives Pharaoh's granaries." [...] Some twenty years earlier the German Dominican William of Boldensele had traveled about Egypt and left (1336) a very critical account of the notion: [...] "the simple people of the country say that these were Pharaoh's barns and granaries in which Joseph had the wheat kept {{in the time of}} the great famine mentioned in the Bible ... But this cannot be true at all, for no place for putting in the wheat can be found there, and there is in inside these columns no empty space where anything can be placed. [...] For from top to bottom they are closed and made entirely of huge stones well joined to one another—except that there is a very small door quite high above the ground and a very narrow and very dark little passage through which one descends there for a certain distance, but it is not all wide enough to put grain in, as those of the country say and believe." [...] The German knight's memoir would provide the framework, and many of the details, {{for one of the most}} popular books of the late Middle Ages, the Travels of John Mandeville (1356). [...] The supposed author most likely did not visit the locales in his narrative, and in the case of his account of the Pyramids, he actually reverses the conclusions and reasoning of William: [...] "these are Joseph’s Granaries, which he had made to store the wheat for hard times ... Some say that they are tombs of the great lords of antiquity, but that is not true, for the common word through the whole country near and <b>far</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they are Joseph's Granaries, and they have it written thus in their chronicles. [...] On the other hand, if they were tombs, they would not be empty inside, nor would they have entrances for going inside, nor are tombs ever made of such a large size and such a height—which is why it is not to be believed that they are tombs." ...|$|E
