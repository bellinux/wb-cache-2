While not the main {{event of the}} show, the semi-main event was rated 5 stars by the Wrestling Observer Newsletter, which also voted La Pareja del Terror the Team of the Year and Art Barr the <b>Heel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Year. After the match, Barr and Guerrero first cut off each other's hair and then had the last of it shaved off {{as a result of}} their loss.|$|E
5|$|Authors Lisa R. Baba, Jacqueline M. McGrath, and Jiexin Liu {{examined}} use of vibration {{delivery to}} infants to mitigate pain while doing heel stick procedures in a 2010 {{article for the}} Journal of Perinatal & Neonatal Nursing. Their sample size included 20 babies of age 35 weeks or more, and they tracked their subjects' levels of pain on the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale while giving mechanical vibration to alleviate discomfort for a heel stick procedure. Vibration was delivered using the Magic Wand, which they bought through Vibratex. They set the Magic Wand to the highest setting {{and placed it on}} the <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> infant for five seconds before administering the heel stick procedure. Their results found that oscillation sensations delivered to newborns who had previously had discomfort from neonatal heel pricks were able to deliver some relief. They wrote that additional research was indicated in the form of a randomized clinical trial with a greater sample size of newborns.|$|E
5|$|The Rolls-Royce Mermaid {{propulsor}} pods {{fitted to}} QM2 {{have proven to}} be prone to failure. The failures had been so frequent and extensive that Carnival Corp. (USA), by way of its Cunard Line division, has taken Rolls-Royce Corp. (UK) to court in the United States in January 2009. The former placed claim that the Mermaid pod propulsion systems fitted to Cunard Line's flagship Queen Mary 2 are inherently defective in design. Cunard contends that Rolls Royce knew about the design deficiencies and deliberately conspired to mislead, deceive and defraud in the course of winning the contract. The Achilles’ <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> design has been the motors' massive thrust bearings, which have continued to show a tendency to fail even after numerous attempts at redesign. In January 2011 Carnival Corporation was awarded US$24 million (approx. UK£15 million at the time of verdict) by the United States court due to the repeated failure of the propulsors.|$|E

25|$|The midsole is {{the layer}} {{in between the}} outsole and the insole, {{typically}} there for shock absorption. Some types of shoes, like running shoes, have additional material for shock absorption, usually beneath the <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foot, where one puts the most pressure down.

25|$|The Robotic Arm (RA) is {{designed}} to extend 2.35 m from its base on the lander, and {{has the ability to}} dig down to 0.5 m below the surface. It took samples of dirt and ice that were analyzed by other instruments on the lander. The arm was designed and built for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory by Alliance Spacesystems, LLC (now MDA US Systems, LLC) in Pasadena, California. A rotating rasp-tool located in the <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scoop was used to cut into the strong permafrost. Cuttings from the Rasp were ejected into the <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scoop and transferred to the front for delivery to the instruments. The Rasp tool, also called the Icy Soils Acquisition Device (ISAD), was conceived of at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The flight version of the Rasp was designed and built by HoneyBee Robotics in Manhattan NY. Commands were sent for the arm to be deployed on May 28, 2008, beginning with the pushing aside of a protective covering intended to serve as a redundant precaution against potential contamination of Martian subsoil by Earthly life-forms.|$|E

25|$|The hips {{should be}} relaxed and the rider should lean {{forwards}} slightly {{with the movement}} of the horse. In cross country, the rider tends {{to stay out of the}} saddle and be standing up with their knees bent and the upper body leaning over the horse's withers. The <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rider should be in line with their shoulders and then the back of their riding hat in dressage to make the canter look neat.|$|E
25|$|Ballet {{shoes are}} soft, pliable shoes made of canvas or leather, with either {{continuous}} or two-part sole (also called split-sole), used for ballet dancing. The sole is typically made of leather, with thicker material under {{the ball and}} <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foot, and thinner and thus more flexible material under the arch so that the foot can be easily pointed. They are typically secured by elastics {{across the top of}} the foot.|$|E
25|$|The {{most popular}} four-mallet grip for vibraphone is the Burton grip, named for Gary Burton. One mallet is held between the {{thumb and index}} finger and the other is held between the index and middle fingers. The shafts cross {{in the middle of the}} palm and extend past the <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hand. For wide intervals, the thumb often moves in between the two mallets and the inside mallet is held in the crook of the fingers.|$|E

25|$|An achilles <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Indian {{nuclear power}} programme, however, {{is the fact}} that they are not signatories of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. This has many times in their history {{prevented}} them from obtaining nuclear technology vital to expanding their use of nuclear industry. Another consequence of this is that much of their programme has been domestically developed, much like their nuclear weapons programme. United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act seems to be a way to get access to advanced nuclear technologies for India.|$|E
25|$|High-heeled {{footwear}} (often abbreviated as {{high heels}} or simply heels) is footwear {{that raises the}} <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wearer's foot {{significantly higher than the}} toes. When both the heel and the toes are raised equal amounts, as in a platform shoe, it is technically not considered to be a high heel; however, there are also high-heeled platform shoes. High heels tend to give the aesthetic illusion of longer, more slender legs. High heels come {{in a wide variety of}} styles, and the heels are found in many different shapes, including stiletto, pump (court shoe), block, tapered, blade, and wedge.|$|E
25|$|A pointe shoe employs two fabric {{ribbons and}} an elastic band to secure {{it to the}} foot. Most {{of the work of}} {{securing}} shoes to feet is done by the ribbons. The two ribbons wrap around the dancer's ankle in opposite directions, overlapping one another so as to form a cross at the front. The ends are then tied together in a knot, which is then tucked under the ribbon {{on the inside of the}} ankle to hide it from view. The elastic band—which traverses the front of the ankle below the ribbons—keeps the <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shoe in place against the foot when the dancer is en pointe.|$|E

25|$|The outsole is {{the layer}} in {{direct contact with}} the ground. Dress shoes often have leather or resin rubber outsoles; casual or work-oriented shoes have outsoles made of natural rubber or a {{synthetic}} material like polyurethane. The outsole may comprise a single piece, or may be an assembly of separate pieces, often of different materials. On some shoes, the <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sole has a rubber plate for durability and traction, while the front is leather for style. Specialized shoes will often have modifications on this design: athletic or so called cleated shoes like soccer, rugby, baseball and golf shoes have spikes embedded in the outsole to improve traction.|$|E
25|$|The {{most visible}} {{difference}} {{in relation to}} ice hockey skates is that figure skates {{have a set of}} large, jagged teeth called toe picks on the front part of the blade. The toe picks are used primarily in jumping and should not be used for stroking or spins. If used during a spin, the toe pick will cause the skater to lose momentum, or move away from the center of his/her spin. Blades are mounted to the sole and <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boot with screws. Typically, high-level figure skaters are professionally fitted for their boots and blades at a reputable skate shop. Professionals are also employed to sharpen blades to individual requirements.|$|E
25|$|Where the {{crossing}} between Ciliegiolo and Calabrese Montenuovo occurred {{is not known}} with some believing the cross happened in Tuscany while other ampelographers suggesting it may have happened in southern Italy. Evidence for this latter theory is the proliferation of seedless mutations of Sangiovese, known under various synonyms, throughout various regions of southern Italy including Campania, Corinto nero which is grown {{on the island of}} Lipari just north of Sicily and Tuccanese from the Puglia region in the <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Italian boot. In Campania, among the many seedless mutations of Sangiovese still growing in the region are Nerello from the commune of Savelli, Nerello Campotu from the commune of Motta San Giovanni, Puttanella from Mandatoriccio and Vigna del Conte.|$|E
