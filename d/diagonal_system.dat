With a stability analysis based on linear <b>diagonal</b> <b>systems</b> of arbitrary dimension, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for the coefficients of a method to be A(α) and A(α, β) stable, extending previous results on this subject given by Hairer [1] and Wambecq [3], [4], [5]...|$|R

50|$|While the Laws of the Game and FIFA {{mandate for}} a single referee with assistants as {{described}} above, a less common system, the dual system, has two referees with no assistants. The system is used some matches played under {{the rules of the}} National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) in the United States, and in other youth or amateur matches. Both referees have equal authority, and the decision of one referee is binding on the other. Each referee is primarily responsible for a specific area of the field {{similar to those of the}} assistant referees in the <b>diagonal</b> <b>system,</b> except that the referees are allowed and encouraged to move away from the touch line into the field, particularly as play approaches the goal lines. Like the assistant referees in the <b>diagonal</b> <b>system,</b> each referee is responsible for patrolling one touch line and one goal line and determining possession for the restart if the ball goes out of play on either of those two boundaries.|$|E
50|$|In {{many cases}} in the UK, referees now use more of a 'curve' based on a line running {{from the edge of}} the 18 yard box, and when near the centre circle they then curve to a line level with the other 18 yard box line.

He {{was also the first}} to employ the <b>diagonal</b> <b>system</b> of control for referees as a standard practice. According to Belgian referee John Langenus, who had been in charge of the 1930 FIFA World Cup Final, he had seen referees from his country making a similar attempt at scientific positioning on the field of play.|$|E
50|$|Assistant referees wear {{a uniform}} {{identical}} {{to that of the}} referee and carry brightly-coloured flags (usually red, yellow, or some pattern involving those colours) which are used to indicate their decisions to the referee, players, and spectators. During the game each assistant referee oversees one touch-line and one end of the field utilising the <b>diagonal</b> <b>system</b> of control. The more senior of the two assistants will normally occupy the side of the field containing the technical areas, to help oversee substitutions. At higher levels of play, the assistant referees' flags may be equipped with buttons that the assistant referee may press to send an audible signal to the referee {{in order to get the}} referee's attention. Also at the highest levels of play, particularly in matches held in large stadiums, the entire officiating crew may be equipped with wireless microphones and earpieces to facilitate vocal communication across long distances or through loud stadium noise.|$|E

Levinson dichotomies for <b>diagonal</b> <b>systems,</b> etc. We prove that under general uniform conditions upon the functions h and k, these dichotomies are not destroyed by integrable perturbations. This result generalizes the property of roughness of ordinary dichotomies under integrable perturbations...|$|R

Once however this level of divergence is reached, the scatter immediately covers the entire, available outcome space. This randomisation is also observed in the other panels.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Paper {{describes}} phenomena {{related to}} the vehicle acceleration on the curve, with the high speed, considering inertia forces and driving force. Design/methodology/approach: The phenomena were investigated with three tools: classical analytical mechanics, computer simulation and tests with physical model.

Nevertheless such a behavior resulted in conclusion that <b>diagonal</b> transmission <b>system</b> would be useful influencing vehicle safety, specifically at slippery roads. Practical implications: There is a possibility of <b>diagonal</b> transmission <b>system</b> application for sport vehicles to improve performance. For utilitarian vehicles increasing safety {{is the most important}} aspect, especially in cooperation with ESP system. When it comes to special and military vehicles both mentioned above features are desired. Possible power-pack application is an additional advantage.

40|$|Recently Heteroscedastic Discriminant Analysis (HDA) {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{as a replacement for}} Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) in speech recognition systems that use mixtures of diagonal covariance Gaussians to model the data. Typically HDA and LDA involve a dimension reduction of the feature space. A specific version HDA that involves no dimension reduction, and is popularly known as Maximum Likelihood Linear Transform (MLLT) is often used on the feature space to give significant improvements in performance. MLLT approximately diagonalizes the class covariances, and in effect, tries to approximate the performance of a full-covariance system. However, the performance of a full-covariance system could in some cases be much better than using MLLT-based <b>diagonal</b> covariance <b>system.</b> We propose the method of Multiple Linear Transforms (MLT), that bridges this gap in performance, while maintaining the speed efficiency of a <b>diagonal</b> covariance <b>system.</b> This technique improves the performance of a <b>diagonal</b> covariance <b>system,</b> over what could be obtained from HDA or MLLT...|$|R
