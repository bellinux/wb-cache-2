Objective: We hypothesized that increasing doses of mixed fiber, consumed in muffins for breakfast, would proportionally influence satiety, gut hormone levels, and subsequent food intake. Design: This was a randomized, double-blind, crossover study. Healthy men (n= 10) and women (n= 10) with a BMI of 24 &#x 00 B 1; 2 (mean&#x 00 B 1;SEM) participated in this study. Fasting subjects consumed a muffin with 0, 4, 8, or 12 g of mixed fibers and approximately 500 kcal.

No difference in the cross-bridge turnover rate was observed at the same level of cross-bridge attachment (activation state), showing that changes in Ca 2 + sensitivity were not due to changes in cross-bridge kinetics. Energy cost calculations demonstrated higher energy consumption in Tg-R 145 <b>G</b> <b>fibers</b> compared with Tg-WT fibers. The addition of 3 mm 2, 3 -butanedione monoxime at pCa 9. 0 showed that there was ∼ 2 - 4 % of force generating cross-bridges attached in Tg-R 145 <b>G</b> <b>fibers</b> compared with less than 1. 0 % in Tg-WT fibers, suggesting that the mutation impairs the ability of the cardiac troponin complex to fully inhibit cross-bridge attachment under relaxing conditions. Prolonged force and intracellular [Ca 2 +] transients in electrically stimulated intact papillary muscles were observed in Tg-R 145 G compared with Tg-WT. These results suggest that the phenotype of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is most likely caused by the compensatory mechanisms in the cardiovascular system that are activated by 1) higher energy cost in the heart resulting from a significant decrease in average force per cross-bridge, 2) slowed relaxation (diastolic dysfunction) caused by prolonged [Ca 2 +] and force transients, and 3) an inability of the cardiac TnI to completely inhibit activation in the absence of Ca 2 + in Tg-R 145 G mice...|$|R

After the postprandial 7 -h period. a controlled, low-fat, cholesterol-free diet was served and ileos-tomy effluent was sampled throughout the 24 -h period. Bile acid and fat excretion (24 h) increased by 93 % and 146 %, respectively (P < 0. 05), and total and endogenous cholesterol excretion decreased by 14 % and 19 %. respectively (P < 0. 05), after the OB test meal. The change in hepatic cholesterol synthesis was strongly related to the change in bile acid excre-tion (Spearman r = 0. 89. P < 0. 02). The postprandial chylo-micron lipid concentration tended to be lower after the OB test meal (- 43 % for cholesterol, P = 0. 07) whereas {{there was no difference}} in cholesterol absorption measured by isotope in five subjects.
