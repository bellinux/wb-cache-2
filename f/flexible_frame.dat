25|$|Because the Mona Lisas poplar support expands and {{contracts}} {{with changes in}} humidity, the picture has experienced some warping. In response to warping and swelling experienced during its storage during World War II, and to prepare the picture for an exhibit to honour the anniversary of Leonardo's 500th birthday, the Mona Lisa was fitted in 1951 with a flexible oak frame with beech crosspieces. This <b>flexible</b> <b>frame,</b> which is used {{in addition to the}} decorative frame described below, exerts pressure on the panel to keep it from warping further. In 1970, the beech crosspieces were switched to maple after {{it was found that the}} beechwood had been infested with insects. In 2004–05, a conservation and study team replaced the maple crosspieces with sycamore ones, and an additional metal crosspiece was added for scientific measurement of the panel's warp.|$|E
25|$|John G. Harries {{considered}} {{a common ground}} in the ideas that underlie developments in 20th-century art such as Serial art, Systems Art, Constructivism and Kinetic art. These kind of arts often do not stem directly from observations of things visible in the external natural environment, but from the observation of depicted shapes and {{of the relationship between}} them. Systems art, according to Harries, represents a deliberate attempt by artists to develop a more <b>flexible</b> <b>frame</b> of reference. A style in which its frame of reference is taken as a model to be emulated rather than as a cognitive systems, that only leads to the institutionalization of the imposed model. But to transfer the meaning of a picture to its location within a systemic structure does not remove the need to define the constitutive elements of the system: if they are not defined, one will not know how to build the system.|$|E

60|$|The Unknown.--Nothing is more absurd, I may {{say more}} impious, than for man, with a ken {{surrounded}} by the dense mists of sense, to reason respecting the decrees of eternal justice. You adopt here the same limited view that you embraced in reasoning against the indestructibility of the sentient principle in man from the apparent division of the living principle in the polypus, not recollecting that to prove a quality can be increased or exalted does not prove {{that it can be}} annihilated. If there be, which I think cannot be doubted, a consciousness of good and evil constantly belonging to the sentient principle in man, then rewards and punishments naturally belong to acts of this consciousness, to obedience, or disobedience; and the indestructibility of the sentient being is necessary to the decrees of eternal justice. On your view, even in this life, just punishments for crimes would be almost impossible; for the materials of which human beings are composed change rapidly, and in a few years probably not an atom of the primitive structure remains yet even the materialist is obliged in old age to do penance for the sins of his youth, and does not complain of the injustice of his decrepit body, entirely changed and made stiff by time, suffering for the intemperance of his youthful <b>flexible</b> <b>frame.</b> On my idea, conscience is the frame of the mind, fitted for its probation in mortality. And this is in exact accordance with the foundations of our religion, the Divine origin of which is marked no less by its history than its harmony with the principles of our nature. Obedience to its precepts not only prepares for a better state of existence in another world, but is likewise calculated to make us happy here. We are constantly taught to renounce sensual pleasure and selfish gratifications, to forget our body and sensible organs, to associate our pleasures with mind, to fix our affections upon the great ideal generalisation of intelligence in the one Supreme Being. And that we are capable of forming to ourselves an imperfect idea even of the infinite mind is, I think, a strong presumption of our own immortality, and of the distinct relation which our finite knowledge bears to eternal wisdom.|$|E

50|$|A Fuel Model is {{a stylized}} set of fuel bed {{characteristics}} {{used as input}} {{for a variety of}} wildfire modeling applications. Wildfire behavior models, such as those of Rothermel, take into account numerous empirical variables. While these inputs are important for equation outputs, they are often difficult and time-consuming, if not impossible, to measure for each fuel bed. A fuel model defines these input variables for a stylized set of quantitative vegetation characteristics that can be visually identified in the field. Depending on local conditions, one of several fuel models may be appropriate. As Anderson states “Fuel models are simply tools to help the user realistically estimate fire behavior. The user must maintain a <b>flexible</b> <b>frame</b> of mind and an adaptive method of operating to totally utilize these aids". Furthermore, depending on the application, the user must choose a fuel model classification system. The major classification systems for use in the United States include the National Fire Danger Rating System, the 13 ‘original’ fuel models of Anderson and Albini, the subsequent set of 40 fuels produced by Scott and Burgan, and the Fuel Characteristics Classification System.|$|E

40|$|Modern office {{buildings}} are often open plan buildings with a frame consisting of flat RC slabs, RC columns and non-load bearing {{internal and external}} partitions and facades. These modern framed structures are more flexible than older conventional buildings with load bearing walls and are less susceptible to differential settlement damage. The use of conventional guidelines for differential settlement on modern <b>flexible</b> <b>framed</b> structures may therefore be over-conservative. The literature review of the study highlights the factors producing differential settlement, the types of damage caused by differential settlement and conventional guidelines for limiting differential settlement damage. Conventional guidelines focusing on 2 D structures lack provision for the 3 D deformation of a structure. To determine the behaviour of a modern <b>flexible</b> <b>framed</b> structure a numerical experiment was performed, which consisted of the design according to British Standards and Eurocodes of a 3 D, 5 -bay by 5 -bay, 6 storey flat slab RC frame with pad foundations on clay. The behaviour of the designed structure undergoing differential settlement was then analysed by means of linear-elastic finite element analyses. The results show firstly {{that it is possible}} to normalise structural behaviour to the soilstructure stiffness ratio, secondly the importance of 3 D deformation of the structure and thirdly that stiffer load-displacement responses of foundations may also affect the behaviour of the structure. A stiffer load-displacement response may occur with the reuse of foundation...|$|R
