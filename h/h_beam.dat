500|$|On {{a further}} {{visit to the}} set, Gerrold was called into Coon's office. He was {{informed}} {{that he needed to}} change the name of the fuzzies, as the legal department was concerned about similarities in the name with <b>H.</b> <b>Beam</b> Piper's 1962 novel Little Fuzzy. He subsequently came up with a variety of alternative names. Through a process of elimination, he ended up with the name [...] "tribble". He took the name to Coon, who hated it. But after seeing the alternatives, he agreed to it. Gerrold turned in the script on July 17, entitled [...] "You Think You've Got Tribbles...?". While Coon disliked the name of the small furry creatures, he bought the script. Gerrold's submitted script was within the standard page count for an episode, but, when it was retyped for distribution by the production's mimeo department, it ballooned from 60 to 80 pages due to Gerrold's not having used a typewriter with the 10 point pitch (10 characters per inch) Pica standard of the TV and film industry. This meant that some twenty pages needed to be cut from the script.|$|E

500|$|Browne had {{acquired}} some good-quality {{material in the}} process of planning the launch of a new slick version of Amazing, and when the plan was abandoned this material appeared in the continuing pulp version. This included [...] "Operation RSVP" [...] by <b>H.</b> <b>Beam</b> Piper, and [...] "Satisfaction Guaranteed", by Isaac Asimov. Despite the cancellation of the planned change to a slick format, news had reached the writing community of Amazings new approach, and Browne began to receive much better material than Palmer had been able to publish. The existing stable of Amazing writers, such as Rog Phillips and Chester S. Geier, were replaced by writers such as Fritz Leiber, Fredric Brown, and Clifford D. Simak. Browne also discovered several writers who went on to success in the field, publishing first stories by Walter M. Miller, Mack Reynolds, John Jakes, Milton Lesser and Charles Beaumont, all within the space of nine months in late 1950 and early 1951. Browne was disappointed by the cancellation of the planned slick version, however, and to some extent reverted to Palmer's policy of publishing sensational fiction. In 1952, for example, he serialized the anonymous Master of the Universe, which purported to be a history of the future from 1975 to 2575.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, both Thrilling Wonder and Startling Stories began to publish much more mature fiction {{than they had}} during the war, and {{although}} Astounding was still the leading magazine in the field, {{it was no longer}} the only market for the writers who had been regularly selling to Campbell. [...] Many of the best new writers still broke into print in Astounding rather than elsewhere. [...] Arthur C. Clarke's first story, [...] "Loophole", appeared in the April 1946 Astounding, and another British writer, Christopher Youd, began his career with [...] "Christmas Tree" [...] in February 1949. [...] Youd would become much better known under his pseudonym [...] "John Christopher". [...] William Tenn's first sale, [...] "Alexander the Bait", appeared in May 1946, and <b>H.</b> <b>Beam</b> Piper's [...] "Time and Time Again" [...] in the April 1947 issue was his first story. [...] Along with these newer writers, Campbell was still publishing strong material by authors who had become established during the war. [...] Among the better-known stories of this era are [...] "Vintage Season", by C.L. Moore (under the pseudonym Lawrence O'Donnell); Jack Williamson's story [...] "With Folded Hands"; The Players of Null-A, van Vogt's sequel to The World of Null-A; and the final book in E.E. Smith's Lensman series, Children of the Lens.|$|E
500|$|Only eight US {{science fiction}} or fantasy {{magazines}} survived World War II: Astounding Science Fiction, published by Street & Smith; Weird Tales, from Delaney's Short Stories, Inc.; Standard Magazines' Startling Stories and Thrilling Wonder Stories; Ziff-Davis's Amazing Stories and Fantastic Adventures; Popular's Famous Fantastic Mysteries; and Planet Stories, published by Love Romances, Inc. [...] All {{had been forced}} to quarterly schedules by the war, except Weird Tales, which was bimonthly, and Astounding, still the leading sf magazine. [...] Campbell continued to find new writers: William Tenn, <b>H.</b> <b>Beam</b> Piper, Arthur C. Clarke and John Christopher all made their first sales to Astounding in the late 1940s, and he published many stories now regarded as classics, including [...] "Vintage Season" [...] by C.L. Moore, [...] "With Folded Hands..." [...] by Jack Williamson, Children of the Lens by E.E. Smith, and The Players of Null-A by A.E. van Vogt. [...] The pace of invention which had marked the war years for Astounding was now slackening, however, and in Ashley's words the magazine was now [...] "resting on its laurels". [...] In 1950, Campbell published an article on dianetics by L. Ron Hubbard; this was a psychological theory that would eventually evolve into scientology, a new religion. [...] Dianetics was denounced as pseudoscience by the medical profession, but to the dismay of many of Astoundings readers it was not until 1951 that Campbell disavowed it.|$|E

500|$|When Future was relaunched {{in early}} 1950, the sf {{magazine}} field {{was not particularly}} crowded, and Lowndes was able to attract moderately good stories from writers who were either well-known or on their {{way up in the}} field. [...] The first issue included stories by James Blish, Lester del Rey and Murray Leinster; other authors featured in the early issues included Fritz Leiber, Judith Merril, <b>H.</b> <b>Beam</b> Piper, and L. Sprague de Camp. [...] Some of the better-known stories Lowndes published in the early 1950s were [...] "And There Was Light" [...] by del Rey, [...] "If I Forget Thee, Oh Earth" [...] by Arthur C. Clarke, and [...] "Liberation of Earth" [...] by William Tenn, which Damon Knight described as [...] "the funniest story [...] ever written". [...] He also bought work by some of the women writers active in the 1950s, including several early stories by Carol Emshwiller. [...] Lowndes knew many successful writers in the field, and was able to call on them for stories, but the expanding sf magazine market of the mid-1950s meant that the best material was spread thinly. [...] To attract readers, Lowndes established a friendly and personal style for the magazine, with letter columns and departments aimed at science fiction fans. [...] Blish, writing as William Atheling, Jr., commented in 1953 that Lowndes was doing a [...] "surprisingly good job" [...] with Future, despite the low rates and the slow payment to authors.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The heating {{neutral beam}} (HNB) systems at ITER are {{designed}} to inject a total of 33 MW of either 1 MeV D 0 or 870 keV <b>H</b> 0 <b>beams</b> into the ITER plasma using two injectors with a possible addition of a third injector later to increase the injected power to ∼ 50 MW. The injectors operate in a radioactive environment and should survive the life time of ITER, placing thereby stringent requirements on material and manufacturing choices. To ensure a smooth operational phase of neutral beams at ITER, a neutral beam test facility is under construction at Consorzio RFX, Padova, (hereinafter referred to as RFX), and consists of two test beds. The 100 -kV SPIDER test bed {{will be used to}} optimize the source operation for <b>H</b> and D <b>beams.</b> The 1 -MV MITICA test bed is essentially a full scale ITER prototype injector. The manufacturing and operational experiences at MITICA will not only establish the manufacturing processes of ITER HNB components but will also allow validation of the operational space of the injectors for ITER HNB. Operation of the two facilities is expected to begin in 2016 and 2019, respectively. Currently, the experiments on the ELISE facility, IPP Garching, with a half ITER sized RF beam source are underway. The ITER relevant parameters for the <b>H</b> <b>beams</b> have been achieved. Efforts are underway to optimize the same with D beams. The experimental database from ELISE will be an important input for establishing the SPIDER operation.
