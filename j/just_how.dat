5|$|At {{the age of}} 15 he was an {{offered a}} trial at Leeds United, where his uncle Jim was left back, but turned it down and instead joined his father in the mines. He worked in the mines {{for a short time}} but handed in his notice after finding out <b>just</b> <b>how</b> {{difficult}} and unpleasant it was to work deep underground. He applied to join the police and reconsidered the offer from Leeds United. His trial game for Leeds clashed with his police interview, and Charlton chose to play in the game; the trial was a success and he joined the ground staff at Elland Road.|$|E

To the actor, he wanted the audience to wonder what Lex was going to do to Lana; it was a moment meant to show <b>just</b> <b>how</b> unpredictable Lex can be.|$|E

5|$|The {{ships were}} {{originally}} intended to be laid down 1 September 1939, but they were delayed until November to allow improvements to the shipyards to be completed. A total of sixteen ships were planned in the August 1939 building program, but this was scaled back to four in July 1940 and two in October 1940 {{when it became clear}} <b>just</b> <b>how</b> unprepared the Soviets were for any large-scale naval construction program. Work on these ships ceased shortly after the German invasion.|$|E
5|$|Castile regained {{control of}} Gibraltar in the Eighth Siege of 1462. The Moorish threat receded {{following}} {{the completion of}} the Reconquista and the fortifications were allowed to fall into decay, with very few cannon mounted on the batteries. In 1535, the Spanish naval commander Álvaro de Bazán the Elder warned King Charles I that Gibraltar's defences were seriously inadequate and recommended that the Line Wall Curtain be extended all the way to Europa Point on the southern tip of Gibraltar and that the town's southern wall should be strengthened. However, his advice was ignored. The soldier and writer Pedro Barrantes Maldonaldo noted that by 1540 Gibraltar's north-west bastion (presumably referring to North Bastion) had only four guns, while the castle's few guns were all dismounted (and therefore unusable), and there were no gunners. The garrison's equipment was antiquated and their numbers were few. The town's walls were still essentially medieval and could not have resisted mid-16th century artillery. The fall of Constantinople 90 years earlier showed <b>just</b> <b>how</b> vulnerable such walls could be {{in the face of a}} heavy artillery bombardment.|$|E
5|$|Despite these efforts, on 21February {{it became}} clear <b>just</b> <b>how</b> {{fundamentally}} opposed the groups were. Philip Nye, one of the dissenting brethren, asserted in a speech that a presbytery set over local congregations would become as powerful as the state and was dangerous to the commonwealth, provoking vigorous opposition from presbyterians. The next day, the Assembly finally began to establish a prescription for presbyterian government. Owing to a strong belief in {{the unity of the}} church, the Assembly continued to try to find ways to reconcile the dissenting brethren with the majority throughout 1644, including the establishment of a special committee for that purpose in March. However, on 15November, the dissenting brethren presented their reasons for disagreement {{with the rest of the}} Assembly to Parliament, and on 11December the majority submitted a draft of a presbyterian form of government.|$|E

5|$|Edward was {{responsible}} for implementing royal justice through his network of judges and officials. It is uncertain to what extent Edward took a personal interest in dispensing justice, but {{he appears to have}} involved himself to some degree during the first part of his reign, and to have increasingly intervened in person after 1322. Edward made extensive use of Roman civil law during his reign when arguing in defence of his causes and favourites, which may have attracted criticism from those who perceived this as abandoning the established principles of the English Common Law. Edward was also criticised by contemporaries for allowing the Despensers to exploit the royal justice system for their own ends; the Despensers certainly appear to have abused the system, although <b>just</b> <b>how</b> widely they did so is unclear. Amid the political turbulence, armed gangs and violence spread across England under Edward's reign, destabilising the position of many of the local gentry; much of Ireland similarly disintegrated into anarchy.|$|E
5|$|Sea snakes were {{at first}} {{regarded}} as a unified and separate family, the Hydrophiidae, that later came to comprise two subfamilies: the Hydrophiinae, or true/aquatic sea snakes (now 16genera with 57species), and the more primitive Laticaudinae, or sea kraits (one genus, Laticauda, with five species). Eventually, as it became clear <b>just</b> <b>how</b> closely related the sea snakes are to the elapids, the taxonomic situation became less well-defined. Some taxonomists responded by moving the sea snakes to the Elapidae, thereby creating the subfamilies Elapinae, Hydrophiinae, and Laticaudinae, although the latter may be omitted if Laticauda {{is included in the}} Hydrophiinae. No one has yet been able to convincingly work out the phylogenetic relationships between the various elapid subgroups, and the situation is still unclear. Therefore, others opted to either continue to work with the older traditional arrangements, if only for practical reasons, or to lump all of the genera together in the Elapidae, with no taxonomic subdivisions, to reflect the work that remains to be done.|$|E
5|$|The {{books are}} based on the vampire myth, but Twilight vampires differ in a number of {{particulars}} from the general vampire lore. For instance, Twilight vampires have strong piercing teeth rather than fangs; they glitter in sunlight rather than burn; and they can drink animal as well as human blood. Meyer comments that her vampire mythology differs from that of other authors because she wasn't informed about the canon vampires, saying, It wasn't until I knew that Twilight would be published that I began to think about whether my vampires were too much the same or too much different from the others. Of course, I was far too invested in my characters at that point to be making changes... so I didn't cut out fangs and coffins and so forth as a way to distinguish my vampires; that's <b>just</b> <b>how</b> they came to me.|$|E

5|$|The exact {{systematic}} {{placement of}} the king vulture and the remaining six species of New World vultures remains unclear. Though both are similar in appearance and have similar ecological roles, the New World and Old World vultures evolved from different ancestors {{in different parts of}} the world. <b>Just</b> <b>how</b> different the two are is currently under debate, with some earlier authorities suggesting that the New World vultures are more closely related to storks. More recent authorities maintain their overall position in the order Falconiformes along with the Old World vultures or place them in their own order, Cathartiformes. The South American Classification Committee has removed the New World vultures from Ciconiiformes and instead placed them in Incertae sedis, but notes that a move to Falconiformes or Cathartiformes is possible. Like other New World vultures, the king vulture has a diploid chromosome number of 80.|$|E

5|$|The first match began under a {{cloud of}} Grace-inspired {{controversy}} on Thursday, 20 June at The Oval, where Gloucestershire were beaten by 16 runs. Surrey made 150 (Grace 4–43) and 136 (Grace 6–70), but Gloucestershire's response was 111 (Grace 40) and 159 (Grace 31). This was a fine all-round performance by Grace, though {{he would not have}} been happy with two more innings under 50, and it serves to illustrate <b>just</b> <b>how</b> much Gloucestershire depended on him. The next match at Hove began the following Monday, 24 June, and Gloucestershire won by an innings and 67 runs after losing the toss and being asked to field. Sussex were all out for 93 (Grace 0–21) and 71 (Grace 4–13); in between, Gloucestershire made 231 despite Grace scoring a duck. His brothers did the batting in this one, Fred scoring 71 and E. M. 53.|$|E
5|$|With rain {{shortly before}} the race, the start was taken behind the safety car, forcing all drivers to start the race on the full wet tyres. As Ricciardo led the field behind the safety car, Daniil Kvyat had {{to come into the}} pit lane on lap two, {{complaining}} of technical issues. He rejoined with a new steering wheel, being a lap down {{on the rest of the}} pack already. The race started in earnest on lap seven, with Ricciardo defending his lead at the restart. Kevin Magnussen made a pit stop for intermediate tyres at the end of the lap, but his teammate Jolyon Palmer proved <b>just</b> <b>how</b> slippery it still was when he crashed out just a lap later, being caught out by a wet zebra crossing and causing a virtual safety car period. More cars came into the pitlane for intermediate tyres over the following laps. On lap twelve, Kimi Räikkönen damaged his front wing on the guardrail at the Loews hairpin, resulting in his front wing getting caught under his front tyres, blocking Grosjean's way in the process. Räikkönen retired some corners later. Meanwhile, Ricciardo built a gap at the front, being ten seconds clear of Rosberg on lap 13. One lap later, Sebastian Vettel was the first of the front runners to change to intermediate tyres. Mercedes issued team orders demanding Rosberg let Hamilton past on lap 16, but the gap had by then grown to 13 seconds.|$|E
