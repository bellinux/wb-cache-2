5|$|If the ionic {{compound}} is soluble in a solvent, it can {{be obtained}} as a solid compound by evaporating the solvent from this electrolyte solution. As the solvent is evaporated, the ions do not go into the vapour, but stay in the remaining solution, and when they become sufficiently concentrated, nucleation occurs, and they crystallize into an ionic compound. This process occurs widely in nature, and is the means of formation of the <b>evaporite</b> minerals. Another method of recovering the compound from solution involves saturating a solution at high temperature and then reducing the solubility by reducing the temperature until the solution is supersaturated and the solid compound nucleates.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In many tectonized regions, <b>evaporites,</b> {{which served}} as décollement zones, are brought to the surface, where they are studied {{as part of the}} normal {{sedimentary}} succession and their internal struc-tures are commonly treated as the primary products of deposition and synsedimentary deformation. <b>Evaporites,</b> however, respond to tecton-ism {{in a manner that is}} vastly different from other rocks in the suc-cession. Associated limestone, dolostone, and siliciclastic beds may re-main virtually unaffected by the same degree of deformation that sig-nificantly alters <b>evaporites.</b> Even modest differential stresses, with geo-logically reasonable strain rates applied at low temperatures (20 – 2008 C), result in significant recrystallization, foliation, and flow in <b>evaporites,</b> whereas other rocks (non-evaporites) in the same succession may show little apparent change. The large differences in physical properties between <b>evaporites</b> and both carbonate and siliciclastic li-thologies in such tectonized sections result in <b>evaporites</b> that no longer reflect their original sedimentary environment because of recrystalli-zation and plastic deformation. Yet, because their structures and fab-rics may not be recognized as secondary, they can be misinterpreted as original features indicative of primary depositional environments...|$|R
5000|$|These authors {{showed that}} also predating the {{deposition}} {{of the first}} cycle of <b>evaporites,</b> a major erosional phase can be observed along the basin margins, corresponding to a major [...] "relative sea level drop", associated with tectonic activity (marking {{the end of the}} so-called [...] "Mes-1" [...] unconformity bound depositional sequence). Following this assumption that this major event corresponds to the major Messinian drawdown, Bache et al. (2009) [...] concluded that the Mediterranean bathymetry significantly decreased before the precipitation of central basins <b>evaporites.</b> Van Dijk et al. (1998) had baptised this end member scenario the [...] "Hunchback Scenario". Regarding these works, a deep water formation for central Messinian <b>evaporites</b> seems unlikely. The assumption that central basin <b>evaporites</b> partly deposited under a high bathymetry and before the major phase of erosion should imply the observation of a major detritic event above <b>evaporites</b> in the basin. Such a depositional geometry has not been observed on data, as the detrical wedges are merely confined to the basin marginal areas.|$|R

This new occurrence from Hungary previously thought to be devoid of <b>evaporites</b> is part of a growing body of evidence of evaporitic basins inside the Carpathian Arc. We suggest the presence of <b>evaporites</b> perhaps in the entire Central Paratethys during the salinity crisis. Different scenarios are suggested for what subsequently happened to these <b>evaporites</b> to explain their presence or absence in the geological record. Where they are present, scenario A suggests that they were preserved in subsiding, deep basins overlain by younger sediments that protected the <b>evaporites</b> from reworking, like in the studied area.

Scenario B explains how the supposedly brackish Sarmatian could have been hyper/normal saline locally by providing a source of the excess salt from the reworking and dissolving of BSC halite into seawater.

25|$|The {{national}} park lies atop an underground <b>evaporite</b> layer or salt bed, {{which is the}} main cause of the formation of the arches, spires, balanced rocks, sandstone fins, and eroded monoliths in the area. This salt bed is thousands of feet thick in places, and was deposited in the Paradox Basin of the Colorado Plateau some 300 million years ago when a sea flowed into the region and eventually evaporated. Over millions of years, the salt bed was covered with debris eroded from the Uncompahgre Uplift to the northeast. During the Early Jurassic (about 210 Ma) desert conditions prevailed in the region and the vast Navajo Sandstone was deposited. An additional sequence of stream laid and windblown sediments, the Entrada Sandstone (about 140 Ma), was deposited on top of the Navajo. Over 5,000 feet (1,500 m) of younger sediments were deposited and have been mostly eroded away. Remnants of the cover exist in the area including exposures of the Cretaceous Mancos Shale. The arches of the area are developed mostly within the Entrada formation.|$|E

25|$|The sulfate {{minerals}} all {{contain the}} sulfate anion, 2−. They {{tend to be}} transparent to translucent, soft, and many are fragile. Sulfate minerals commonly form as evaporites, where they precipitate out of evaporating saline waters; alternative, sulfates {{can also be found}} in hydrothermal vein systems associated with sulfides, or as oxidation products of sulfides. Sulfates can be subdivided into anhydrous and hydrous minerals. The most common hydrous sulfate by far is gypsum, CaSO4⋅2H2O. It forms as an <b>evaporite,</b> and is associated with other evaporites such as calcite and halite; if it incorporates sand grains as it crystallizes, gypsum can form desert roses. Gypsum has very low thermal conductivity and maintains a low temperature when heated as it loses that heat by dehydrating; as such, gypsum is used as an insulator in materials such as plaster and drywall. The anhydrous equivalent of gypsum is anhydrite; it can form directly from seawater in highly arid conditions. The barite group has the general formula XSO4, where the X is a large 12-coordinated cation. Examples include barite (BaSO4), celestine (SrSO4), and anglesite (PbSO4); anhydrite {{is not part of the}} barite group, as the smaller Ca2+ is only in eight-fold coordination.|$|E

40|$|A {{possible}} deep-water non-evaporitic unit {{equivalent of}} the Messinian Lower <b>Evaporites</b> has been recognised in the Northern Apennine foredeep. This unit, whose existence is implicitly admitted in the two-step model of the Mediterranean Messinian salinity crisis is documented {{here for the first}} time; it occurs throughout the Apennine foredeep basin below a thick horizon of resedimented gypsum deposits, usually ascribed to the Lower <b>Evaporites.</b> Actually, the Lower <b>Evaporites</b> of the Apennine foredeep basin include both shallow-water, in situ precipitated facies and deep-water, resedimented facies deposited in distinct depocenters. The usually envisaged coeval nature of the two deposits has been recently challenged in several works based on a) physical–stratigraphic considerations about the downbasin correlation of the Messinian erosional surface cutting on top the in situ <b>evaporites</b> with the sharp base of the resedimented <b>evaporites</b> unit and b) the common occurrence of a barren unit below the resedimented <b>evaporites</b> which has no obvious equivalents in pre-evaporitic successions underlying the in situ precipitated <b>evaporites.</b> In this work a multidisciplinary study has been carried out on a 140 m-thick composite section (Fanantello section) to definitely assess the age and palaeoenvironmental characteristics of the unit underlying the resedimented gypsum deposits. The topmost part of the section comprises a 60 m-thick succession of barren euxinic shales falling entirely within a reversed polarity chron and characterised by a) the complete disappearance of Foraminifera, b) the occurrence of high salinity tolerant thecosomatous pteropods (Creseis sp.) c) the abundance peaks of the calcareous nannofossil Sphenolithus abies (interpreted as related to highly stressed likely hyperhaline conditions), d) the appearance of hyperhaline and/or stratified water molecular indicators (gammacerane, b 0. 2 pristane/phytane ratio, b 1 n-alkanes odd–even predominance).

40|$|Salt {{tectonics}} and mud volcanism in the Latakia and Cyprus Basin, eastern Mediterranean, is {{investigated by}} means of swath sounding, reflection seismics and side-scan data {{as well as by}} camera and video sledge observations. Both basins are located east of Cyprus and are associated with the collision front between the African and Anatolian plate. The Pliocene–Quaternary sediment succession is underlain by up to 1 km thick Messinian <b>evaporites.</b> Both thick-skinned plate tectonic and thin-skinned salt tectonic control fluid dynamics and associated mud volcanism in the Latakia and Cyprus Basin {{as well as at the}} Troodos Latacia Culmination, which separates both basins. An end-member model is proposed which explains the presence of elongated topographic highs and trenches along the Troodos Larnaca Culmination and south of it by gravity gliding of the Messinian <b>evaporites</b> and associated fluid migration. Thin-skinned extension in the Troodos Larnaca Culmination and boudinage, respectively, facilitate fluid flow through and out of the <b>evaporites.</b> The fluid or mud flow dissolutes the salt layer and creates elongated trenches. Mud intrudes into the Pliocene–Quaternary sediments above the trenches. Consequently, the overburden is thickened and forms morphological ridges. South of the culmination the <b>evaporites</b> and overburden are folded due to thin-skinned shortening of the <b>evaporites.</b> In one instance fluid extrusion out of the <b>evaporites</b> is inferred from seismic data interpretation. The outflow caused a volume reduction and collapse of the <b>evaporites.</b> Mud volcanoes and fold anticlines align above deep-rooted transpressional fault systems which are associated with the African–Anatolian collision zone. The faults may act as conduits for rising fluids. In the western part of the survey area, where the Cyprus Arc strikes almost West–East and the collision occurred more frontal and stress was highest, mud volcanoes emerged. Further to the east, where the Cyprus Arc runs SW–NE and sinistral strike-slip has been proposed, fold anticlines evolved. Particular mud volcanoes and folds emerged prior to the deposition of the Messinian <b>evaporites.</b> The undisturbed upper Pleistocene sequences as well as the absence of significant mud outflow on the seafloor strongly suggest that the main fluid dynamic ceased...|$|R
500|$|Deserts contain {{substantial}} mineral resources, sometimes {{over their}} entire surface, giving them their characteristic colors.
