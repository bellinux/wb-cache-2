5|$|Alessandro Farnese, as Paul III, was {{the last}} of the popes {{appointed}} by the ruling Medici family of Florence. He was socially ambitious, a careerist and not particularly pious. <b>He</b> <b>kept</b> a concubine, fathered four children out of wedlock and viewed the throne as an opportunity to fill his coffers while he placed his relatives in high positions. A talented and cunning political operator, Paul was precisely the sort of man the Florentines needed to assist them in their defence against French and Spanish threats.|$|E
5|$|Although David James {{remained}} as England's starting goalkeeper in a 2–2 draw against Austria {{in the first}} 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification match, Robinson started every subsequent match, keeping six clean sheets in nine competitive appearances, with a further three in seven friendly matches before the tournament. At the World Cup finals in Germany, Robinson was named in England's World Cup squad and was ever-present in England's campaign, keeping clean sheets in {{four out of five}} matches that he played. After the opening World Cup match against Paraguay, when his counterpart Justo Villar was injured seven minutes into the match, Robinson sent Villar his gloves as a gesture of goodwill. England had won the match 1–0. In addition to the clean sheet against Paraguay, <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> one in the group match against Trinidad and Tobago, although he drew criticism for making errors on crosses. Following England's progression from the group stage, <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> a clean sheet against Ecuador in the round of 16. He also kept a clean sheet in the following match, a quarter-final match against Portugal, although Portugal won 3–1 in a penalty shoot-out to eliminate England from the tournament.|$|E

6000|$|... "Sure!" [...] he said huskily. [...] "Here comes a lad {{now that}} was born on the Bowery and knows every inch of it. If he's ever been above Bleecker street <b>he's</b> <b>kept</b> it to himself." ...|$|R
5|$|As a prisoner, he battled starvation, {{receiving}} {{only a small}} meal of mush {{served in}} a tin cup—a utensil <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> {{for the rest of}} his life. With a weight below , Buckles developed beriberi, and led fellow captives in calisthenics to counter the effects of imprisonment. Their captors showed little mercy, but Buckles was allowed to grow a small garden, which he often used to help feed children who were imprisoned there.|$|E
5|$|At {{the third}} barrel, Scamper spit the {{bit out of}} his mouth, causing the bridle to drop to his chest, but <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> running full speed ahead. While running down the home stretch after the third barrel, James had nothing but a single rein around Scamper's neck with which to control him. Despite these occurrences, the pair crossed the finish line {{with a time of}} 14.4 seconds to win both the round and the 1985 World Barrel Racing Championship.|$|E
5|$|By now aged nearly 56, Kruger {{resolved}} that {{he could}} no longer travel constantly between Boekenhoutfontein and the capital, and in August 1881 he and Gezina moved to Church Street, Pretoria, from where he could easily walk to the government offices on Church Square. Also around this time he shaved off his moustache and most of his facial hair, leaving the chinstrap beard <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> thereafter. His and Gezina's permanent home on Church Street, what is now called Kruger House, would be completed in 1884.|$|E

6000|$|... "We're going. Harry's outside. I {{told him}} you didn't want to see him, so <b>he's</b> <b>kept</b> out of your way. But {{he wants to know}} if he can come in just for a minute to say good-bye to you." ...|$|R
5|$|Clark {{never married}} and <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> no account of any romantic relationships, {{although}} his family held {{that he had}} once been in love with Teresa de Leyba, sister of Don Fernando de Leyba, the lieutenant governor of Spanish Louisiana. Writings from his niece and cousin in the Draper Manuscripts in the archives of the Wisconsin Historical Society attest to their belief in Clark's lifelong disappointment over the failed romance.|$|E
5|$|David left London in March, {{arriving}} in Rome {{just before the}} Easter celebrations. She toured the country, watching cooks {{at home and in}} restaurants and making extensive notes on the regional differences in the cuisine. While in Rome she met the painter Renato Guttuso; deeply impressed by his work, particularly his still lifes, she asked if he would illustrate her book. To her surprise he agreed and, while considering the fee of £60 absurdly low, <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> to his word and produced a series of illustrations.|$|E
5|$|Despite Stroheim's {{reputation}} as a perfectionist, Greed contains anachronisms. In the scenes on Polk Street, the main characters are clothed in 1890s fashions, but the extras wear 1920s clothing. Stroheim {{did his best to}} avoid such historical mistakes; he shot only those buildings that were from the era Greed was set in, and <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> motor vehicles out of sight while filming. Daniels stated that, despite his desire for authenticity, Stroheim sometimes had walls knocked out of real locations to achieve a desired camera position.|$|E

50|$|It {{is unclear}} where Owain was imprisoned, but some {{scholars}} believe <b>he</b> was <b>kept</b> in Dolbadarn Castle near Llanberis. Wherever <b>he</b> was <b>kept,</b> Llywelyn reluctantly released Owain in 1277 {{under the terms}} of the Treaty of Aberconwy, after some 20 years of captivity.|$|R
5|$|Despite his {{contract}} with Sengoku, Mann went on to make his North American debut against Doug Evans on 11 September 2010 at Shark Fights 13. The bout saw Mann hit Evans with multiple combinations and low kicks, before utilising a flying knee. Evans counter-attacked with takedowns, which <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> up into the final round. Mann won the bout via split decision (47–48, 48–47, 48–47) to become the new Shark Fights Featherweight champion.|$|E
5|$|During the Great Depression Flanders {{began to}} write about social policy. His major concern was human {{development}} in a technological era. He addressed employing spiritual guidance with a “program of human values” to achieve a good life. Nevertheless, his underlying goal was to achieve “full employment.” So, <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> himself grounded in economic principles, as understood and debated during that era.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{to regain}} a public {{position}} in the Orange Free State failed, and in 1888 Spruyt once more returned to the South African Republic. He was allowed to work as law agent in the lower courts, and – being well-known and popular – set up a successful law practice. Until {{the end of his}} life <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> a healthy interest in the affairs of the state, especially in land cases.|$|E

5|$|Forster had a {{successful}} season with Celtic, winning a runner-up medal in the League Cup and Scottish Premier League. Between them, Forster and fellow goalkeeper Łukasz Załuska kept 23 clean sheets in the league, breaking Celtic's previous clean sheet record from the 2001–02 season. Forster kept 21 of the clean sheets. He capped off his season with a 3–0 victory over Motherwell to help Celtic win the Scottish Cup. In total, <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> 24 clean sheets in 44 matches for Celtic.|$|E
5|$|Fàbregas {{got another}} brace in a 4–0 victory against Osasuna in the Copa del Rey. He also {{scored in the}} semi-final of the {{competition}} against Valencia to help Barcelona to the final with a 3–1 win on aggregate. <b>He</b> <b>kept</b> a regular run in the Barcelona side {{for the rest of}} the season, including appearances in both semi-final legs of the 3–2 aggregate defeat to Chelsea in the Champions League, and a substitute appearance in the 3–0 victory against Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final.|$|E
5|$|Harlan {{complained to}} Goebbels {{that all the}} {{characters}} were negative; to this, Goebbels retorted that Harlan would not turn down the role of Richard III {{just because he was}} a negative character. However, Goebbels acceded to Harlan's insistence on rewriting the script and Harlan spent from November 1939 to March 1940 revising the script although <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> much of what Metzger and Möller had written.|$|E

5|$|He {{lived in}} Hvalstad, Asker, where {{he owned a}} nine decare small farm. The {{property}} included three equal parts of garden, forest and arable land. He often cut lumber from the forest to build his own furniture. At various times, he had rabbits, sheep, cows, calves, piglets and a fish pond of brown trout at his property. According to himself, <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> the livestock largely in protest against tax authorities, while also as a hobby.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{he raised}} over £300,000 for Sport Relief in a bike ride with fellow Match of the Day {{presenter}} Adrian Chiles, {{the idea for}} which emerged in an off the cuff question from cycling fan Chiles to Shearer as to how <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> fit since retirement. Shearer also played and scored twice in Soccer Aid, a game involving celebrities and former players at Wembley Stadium in September 2008, {{to raise money for}} UNICEF.|$|E
5|$|In the manga The Saga of Darren Shan, the titular {{character}} is fascinated by spiders. <b>He</b> <b>kept</b> them as pets until he killed {{one that he}} got when he was nine years old.

Later on, we find out that he can communicate with spiders.|$|E
