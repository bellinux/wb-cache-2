25|$|Bimetal strips {{are used}} in {{miniature}} circuit breakers to protect circuits from <b>excess</b> <b>current.</b> A coil of wire is used to heat a bimetal strip, which bends and operates a linkage that unlatches a spring-operated contact. This interrupts the circuit and can be reset when the bimetal strip has cooled down.|$|E
25|$|Arcing between tube {{elements}} {{can destroy}} the tube. An arc {{can be caused}} by applying voltage to the anode (plate) before the cathode has come up to operating temperature, or by drawing <b>excess</b> <b>current</b> through a rectifier, which damages the emission coating. Arcs can also be initiated by any loose material inside the tube, or by excess screen voltage. An arc inside the tube allows gas to evolve from the tube materials, and may deposit conductive material on internal insulating spacers.|$|E

25|$|Many simple DC power {{supplies}} regulate the voltage using either series or shunt regulators, but most apply a voltage reference using a shunt regulator {{such as a}} Zener diode, avalanche breakdown diode, or voltage regulator tube. Each of these devices begins conducting at a specified voltage and will conduct as much current as required to hold its terminal voltage to that specified voltage by diverting <b>excess</b> <b>current</b> from a non-ideal power source to ground, often through a relatively low-value resistor to dissipate the excess energy. The power supply is designed to only supply a maximum amount of current that is within the safe operating capability of the shunt regulating device.|$|E
25|$|A {{circuit breaker}} is an {{automatically}} operated electrical switch {{designed to protect}} an electrical circuit from damage caused by <b>excess</b> <b>current,</b> typically resulting from an overload or short circuit. Its basic function is to interrupt current flow after a fault is detected. Unlike a fuse, which operates once and then must be replaced, a circuit breaker can be reset (either manually or automatically) to resume normal operation. Circuit breakers are made in varying sizes, from small devices that protect low-current circuits or individual household appliance, up to large switchgear designed to protect high voltage circuits feeding an entire city. The generic function of a circuit breaker, RCD or a fuse, as an automatic means of removing power from a faulty system is often abbreviated as ADS (Automatic Disconnection of Supply).|$|E

[...] This kind of regulator is usually employed only in low voltage, low current circuits because SS diodes have both voltage and current limitations. [...] It is also very inefficient, because it dumps <b>excess</b> <b>current,</b> which is not available to the load.|$|E
40|$|<b>Excess</b> <b>currents</b> due to field-assisted {{tunneling}} in both {{forward and}} reverse bias directions {{have been observed}} in n(+) -p silicon solar cells. These currents arise from the effect of conducting paths produced in the depletion layer by n(+) diffusion and cell processing. Forward-bias data indicate a small potential barrier with height of 0. 04 eV at the n(+) end of conducting paths. Under reverse bias, <b>excess</b> tunneling <b>currents</b> involve a potential barrier at the p end of the conducting paths, the longer paths being associated with smaller barrier heights and dominating at the lower temperatures. Low-reverse-bias data give energy levels of 0. 11 eV for lower temperatures (253 - 293 K) and 0. 35 eV for higher temperatures (293 - 380 K). A model is suggested to explain the results...|$|R

Base electrodes consisting of Nb with a surface layer of amorphous Nb-Si or Nb-Al have been fabricated. Tunnel barriers grown from these alloys have shown reduced capacitance when compared to barriers formed on pure Nb surfaces. In addition, low <b>excess</b> <b>currents</b> have been observed in these junctions; however, the junction characteristics are sensitive to the thickness and composition of this amorphous layer...|$|R
2500|$|Active {{regulators}} employ {{at least}} one active (amplifying) component such as a transistor or operational amplifier. Shunt regulators are often (but not always) passive and simple, but always inefficient because they (essentially) dump the <b>excess</b> <b>current</b> which is not available to the load.

2500|$|Fuse {{selection}} {{depends on}} the load's characteristics. Semiconductor devices may use a fast or ultrafast fuse as semiconductor devices heat rapidly when <b>excess</b> <b>current</b> flows. The fastest blowing fuses are designed for the most sensitive electrical equipment, where even a short exposure to an overload current could be very damaging. [...] Normal fast-blow fuses are the most general purpose fuses. [...] The time delay fuse (also known as anti-surge, or slow-blow) are designed to allow a current which is above the rated value of the fuse to flow {{for a short period}} of time without the fuse blowing. [...] These types of fuse are used on equipment such as motors, which can draw larger than normal currents for up to several seconds while coming up to speed.|$|E

40|$|Corrosion of {{aluminum}} {{in a system}} of engineered copper particles was studied in order to elucidate the nature of the interactions be-tween multiple pitting sites. Single copper particles were fabricated on isolated, thin-film aluminum electrodes to enable independent measurements of excess anodic and cathodic currents flowing during open circuit exposures to dilute aqueous chloride solutions. In-situ fluorescence microscopy allowed imaging of local changes in solution pH during the exposure. Under the experimental conditions explored here, the anodic dissolution {{of aluminum}} beneath the majority of particles was balanced by cathodic reactions on the same electrode. However, <b>excess</b> anodic <b>currents</b> were also observed on some single electrodes due to accelerated dissolution of aluminum beneath the copper particles. These <b>excess</b> anodic <b>currents</b> were balanced by cathodic currents distributed between the other electrodes. Fluctuations in the <b>excess</b> anodic <b>currents</b> were correlated with fluctuations in the open circuit potential and with localized increases in solution pH above each of the copper particles. The transient nature of this accelerated dissolution suggests that it may evolve under anodic control...|$|R

The opportunity for successfully applying the combination of reflectance and reflectance anisotropy spectroscopy in situ methods for investigating III-V structure growth on a Ge substrate has been demonstrated. Photovoltaic properties of the III-V/Ge narrow-band subcell of the triple-junction solar cells have been investigated.

50|$|The {{first problem}} is {{resolved}} {{by the use of}} circuit breakers—devices that can be reset after they have broken current flow. In modern systems that use less than about 10 kW, miniature circuit breakers are typically used. These devices combine the mechanism that initiates the trip (by sensing <b>excess</b> <b>current)</b> as well as the mechanism that breaks the current flow in a single unit. Some miniature circuit breakers operate {{solely on the basis of}} electromagnetism. In these miniature circuit breakers, the current is run through a solenoid, and, in the event of <b>excess</b> <b>current</b> flow, the magnetic pull of the solenoid is sufficient to force open the circuit breaker's contacts (often indirectly through a tripping mechanism). A better design however arises by inserting a bimetallic strip before the solenoid—this means that instead of always producing a magnetic force, the solenoid only produces a magnetic force when the current is strong enough to deform the bimetallic strip and complete the solenoid's circuit.|$|E

The integrated intensity of photons emitted with energy above 1. 5 eV is shown to be proportional, for large negative gate biases, to the product of gate and drain currents, suggesting direct recombination of channel hot electrons with impact‐ionization‐generated holes as the dominant emission mechanism. The deviation from simple proportionality at gate voltages around 0 V indicates that in implanted devices in open channel conditions other mechanisms, such as bremsstrahlung, may significantly contribute to the intensity of the emitted light...|$|R
