50|$|Some {{transmissions}} do {{not allow}} the driver to arbitrarily select any gear. Instead, the driver may only ever select the next-lower or next-higher gear ratio. Sequential transmissions often incorporate a synchro-less <b>dog-clutch</b> engagement mechanism (instead of the synchromesh dog clutch common on H-pattern automotive transmissions), {{in which case the}} clutch is only necessary when selecting first or reverse gear from neutral, and most gear changes can be performed without the clutch. However, sequential shifting and synchro-less engagement are not inherently linked, though they often occur together due to the environment(s) in which these transmissions are used, such as racing cars and motorcycles.|$|E
50|$|At Olympia's Commercial Motor Show in March 1907 Commer {{exhibited}} a motor-bus chassis with a 30-36 horsepower engine and a gearbox invented by Mr Linley, the works manager. <b>Dog-clutches</b> made the change {{rather than the}} spur wheels which remained in constant mesh. As well as the bus chassis Commer displayed a char-a-banc for thirty passengers and delivery vans being run by a substantial enterprise.|$|R
50|$|A {{review of}} the 1913 model, {{on display at the}} 1912 Motor Cycle and Cycle Car Show at Olympia, stated {{that it was one of}} the first cycle cars made in this country, and that it had benefitted from the {{production}} of only one model for the past 2 years. The emphasis was on its ability as a touring car rather than for sporting purposes. The engine was an air-cooled 8 h.p. JAP V-twin with Bosch magneto ignition and B and B carburetor. Transmission was through a metal-to-metal disc clutch, then by Renold chain to the gearbox offering two forward speeds, with the gear always in mesh and selected by substantial <b>dog-clutches.</b> There was then Renold chain back to the back axle, which was remarkably strong with double radius rods, and a massive differential. It was stated that the engine could be started from the driver's seat, though did not explain the mechanism. The weight was 5cwt, and the cost 95 guineas.|$|R
