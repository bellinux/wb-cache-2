The {{aim of the}} presented work {{was to assess the}} antibacterial activity of berberine chloride (BECl) in light of the effect exerted by common antibiotics on selected reference strains of oral streptococci (OST), and to evaluate the magnitude of interactions. Three representative oral microorganisms were investigated: Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175 (SM), S. sanguinis ATCC 10556 (SS), S. oralis ATCC 9811 (SO) and microdilution tests, along with disc diffusion assays were applied. Here, we report that growth (viability) of all oral streptococci was reduced by exposure to BECl and was dependent primarily on exposure/ incubation time. A minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of BECl against OST ranged from 512 µg/mL (SS) to 1024 µg/mL (SM, SO). The most noticeable antibacterial effects were observed for S. sanguinis (MIC 512 µg/mL) and the most significant synergistic action was found for the combinations BECl-penicillin, BECl-clindamycin and BECl-erythromycin. The S. oralis reflects the highest MBC value as assessed by the AlamarBlue assay (2058 µg/mL).

A total of 7181 patients were screened for MRSA. 7357 S. aureus were isolated in clinical cultures. Of 898 screened asylum seekers, almost 10 % were MRSA positive. Of 118 asylum seekers with S. aureus in clinical cultures almost 19 % were MRSA positive. The general patient population had a 1. 3 % rate of MRSA in S. aureus isolates. A higher rate of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) positive strains (RR: 2. 4; 95 % CI: 1. 6 - 3. 4) was found in asylum seekers compared to the general patient population.

However, what has not been taken into account is that honey varies {{markedly}} in the potency of its antibacterial activity. Manuka (Leptospermum scoparium) honey from New Zealand has been found to have substantial levels of non-peroxide antibacterial activity associated with an unidentified phytochemical component, denoted as Unique Manuka Factor (UMF). Aims: Considering the potential antimicrobial effects of manuka honey, the present study attempted to investigate effects of twice daily use of manuka honey with UMF 19. 5 on salivary levels of Mutans streptococci in children. Study Design: The investigation was a stratified comparison of two parallel groups of children who either used manuka honey with regular tooth brushing regimen or continued only with regular tooth brushing regimen twice daily under professional supervision for a 21 -day period. A total of three salivary samples were taken from each individual at baseline, day 10, and day 21; colony counts of Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) were determined.

40|$|Using {{two studies}} {{of a simple}} design it has been {{possible}} to furnish proof {{of the influence of}} hand hygiene prior to insertion of peripheral venous catheters on the incidence of complications. In the first study detailed data were collected anonymously for each patient on the procedure used for catheter insertion or on any complications. Data were collected for around 64 % of patients in one hospital. Evaluation of the questionnaires revealed that there was {{a significant increase in the}} incidence of complications in line with an increasing duration of the indwelling period of between 24 and 96 hours. The unexpected finding of this evaluation study was that in the case of catheters with an indwelling period of more than two days there were highly significantly lower complication rates in those cases in which hand disinfection was carried out or gloves donned before catheter placement. The second study, based on the former, documented the cases giving rise to complications. The proportion of peripheral venous catheters implicated in complications was 24 %. Here, too, there was a sharp rise in the risk of complications in line with the duration of the indwelling period. Catheters placed in the OR during the patient’s hospital stay showed a significantly lower risk of complications than those inserted on wards, or even in the outpatient department. Conductance of hygienic hand disinfection or the wearing of disposable gloves resulted in significantly lower complication rates compared to normal handwashing or omission of a hand <b>hygiene</b> <b>measure.</b> The most plausible explanation for this positive effect exerted by the wearing of disposable gloves or conductance of hygienic hand disinfection prior to catheter placement is that there was no recontamination during repalpation, as often seen, of the prepared venepuncture site...|$|E
40|$|The mucosal {{immune system}} {{consists}} of molecules, cells, and organized lymphoid structures {{intended to provide}} immunity to pathogens that impinge upon mucosal surfaces. Mucosal infection by intracellular pathogens results in the induction of cellmediated immunity, as manifested by CD 4 -positive (CD 4 +) T helper-type 1 cells, as well as CD 8 + cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. These responses are normally accompanied by the synthesis of secretory immunoglobulin A (S-IgA) antibodies, which provide an important {{first line of defense}} against invasion of deeper tissues by these pathogens. Newgeneration live, attenuated viral vaccines, such as the cold-adapted, recombinant nasal influenza and oral rotavirus vaccines, optimize this form of mucosal immune protection. Despite these advances, new and reemerging infectious diseases are tipping the balance in favor of the parasite; continued mucosal vaccine development will be needed to effectively combat these new threats. Behavioral changes in the human host may be contributing to the emergence of new diseases. Perhaps emerging pathogens become resistant to antibiotics or (through genetic recombination) become more resistant to host defenses. Recombination events or lack of exposure can result in loss of immunity of the population to the pathogen, as has been well documented with influenza virus. Recombination events increase the infection rate by the emerging pathogen and, in the case of influenza virus, occasionally result in pandemics. A large number of emerging pathogens are mucosally transmitted and must cross mucosal barriers to infect the host. Thus, our ultimate defense against new and reemerging infectious disease will require effective mucosal vaccines. Mucosal surfaces are prominent in the gastrointestinal, urogenital, and respiratory tracts and provide portals of entry for pathogens. Increased sanitation and hygiene, the use of antibiotics, and childhood vaccination have enormously decreased the death rate from infectious diseases over the last century (1).

40|$|On-farm {{biosecurity}} {{practices have}} been promoted in many animal industries to protect animal populations from infections. Current approaches based on regression modelling techniques for assessing biosecurity perceptions and practices are limited {{for analysis of}} the interrelationships between multivariate data. A suitable approach, which does not require background knowledge of relationships, is provided by Bayesian network modelling. Here we apply such an approach to explore the complex interrelationships between the variables representing horse managers' perceptions of effectiveness of on-farm biosecurity practices. The dataset was derived from interviews conducted with 200 horse managers in Australia after the 2007 equine influenza outbreak. Using established computationally intensive techniques, an optimal graphical statistical model was identified whose structure was objectively determined, directly from the observed data. This methodology is directly analogous to multivariate regression (i. e. multiple response variables). First, an optimal model structure was identified using an exact (exhaustive) search algorithm, followed by pruning the selected model for over-fitting by the parametric bootstrapping approach. Perceptions about effectiveness of movement restrictions and access control were linked but were generally segregated from the perceptions about effectiveness of personal and equipment hygiene. Horse managers believing in the effectiveness of complying with movement restrictions in stopping equine influenza spread onto their premises {{were also more likely}} to believe in the effectiveness of reducing their own contact with other horses and curtailing professional visits. Similarly, the variables representing the effectiveness of disinfecting vehicles, using a disinfectant footbath, changing into clean clothes on arrival at the premises and washing hands before contact with managed horses were clustered together. In contrast, horse managers believing in the effectiveness of disinfecting vehicles (<b>hygiene</b> <b>measure)</b> were less likely to believe in the effectiveness of controlling who has access to managed horses (access control). The findings of this analysis provide new insights into the relationships between perceptions of effectiveness of different biosecurity measures. Different extension education strategies might be required for horse managers believing more strongly in the effectiveness of access control or hygiene measures. 8 page(s...|$|E
30|$|The {{link between}} SA {{carriage}} and outbreaks {{of skin and}} soft-tissue infections is not always clear. Outbreaks of PVL-positive MRSA infection {{have been reported in}} sports teams with high carriage of methicillin-susceptible SA (23.0 to 48.5 %) but not significantly linked to CA-MRSA carriage [24 – 26]. In a 1 -year surveillance study of MRSA nasal carriage among student athletes, colonization alone appeared insufficient to trigger outbreaks [24]. However, CA-SA infection outbreaks remain low in European athlete population compared to USA athlete population. The reported outbreaks are usually linked to poor hygiene practices and the implementation of simple hygiene measures can efficiently halt the transmission [27]. In our study, we did not find any PVL-positive MRSA carrier, nonetheless, the high SA carriage associated with skin contact during sport practice increases the risk of SA transmission between players [19] and therefore the risk of SA carriage and infection [7]. Previous study reported a higher risk of S. aureus carriage overtime in contact sports athletes and that efforts should focus to prevent transmission of S. aureus among these athletes [28]. Prevention of SA carriage and infection in that population could be achieved by simple <b>hygiene</b> <b>measure</b> promotion as skin wound disinfection and covering during practice, showering after practice and competition, using liquid soap rather than bar soap, washing clothes and equipment after practice, refraining from cosmetic body shaving, and discouraging athletes from sharing towels and personal hygiene items [29, 30]. Our data did not allow identifying risk factors for SA carriage. We found that long-term antibiotic therapy was associated with SA carriage, but this classical risk factor was no longer significant in multivariate analysis. As French data on SA carriage among athletes were lacking, we based our sample size on American data; we therefore overestimated the carriage proportion, which partly explains the lack of statistical power. Sample size was a major limitation to the study. Despite showing a high carriage, it was only out of 300 athletes. Finally, one interesting control would be to apply the same swabbing technique to a sample of the Limousin general population.|$|E

This double-blind, crossover, {{randomized}} study {{aimed to}} examine the bad breath-inhibiting effect of 3 commercially available mouthrinses on morning halitosis during an experimental period of 12 days without mechanical plaque control. METHODS: Twelve medical students with a healthy periodontium refrained from all means of mechanical plaque control during 3 experimental periods of 12 days (with intervening washout periods of at least 3 weeks). A professional oral cleaning preceded each period. During each experimental period, as the only oral <b>hygiene</b> <b>measure</b> allowed, the students rinsed twice a day {{with one of the}} following formulations in a randomized order: CHX-Alc (a 0. 2 % chlorhexidine [CHX] solution); CHX-NaF (CHX 0. 12 % plus sodium fluoride 0. 05 %); or CHX-CPC-Zn (CHX 0. 05 % plus cetylpyridinium chloride 0. 05 % plus zinc lactate 0. 14 %). After 12 days, morning breath was scored via volatile sulfur compound (VSC) level measurements of the mouth air and organoleptic ratings of the mouth air, the expired air, and a scraping of the tongue coating. At the 12 -day visit, a questionnaire (subjective ratings) was completed and samples taken from both the tongue coating and the saliva for anaerobic and aerobic culturing and vitality staining. The de novo supragingival plaque formation was also recorded. All parameters were correlated with the baseline registrations. RESULTS: Although oral hygiene during the 3 experimental periods was limited to oral rinses, bad breath parameters systematically improved, {{with the exception of a}} slight increase in VSC levels while using CHX-Alc, a finding which was associated with the direct influence of the CHX on the sulfide monitor. The oral microbial load after the use of CHX-NaF remained unchanged, while for the CHX-Alc and CHX-CPC-Zn, significant reductions in both aerobic and anaerobic colony forming units (CFU) /ml were noticed in comparison with baseline data for both tongue coating and saliva samples. The composition of microflora, on the other hand, did not reveal significant changes. The supragingival plaque formation was inhibited, in descending order, by CHX-Alc, CHX-CPC-Zn, and CHX-NaF. The subjective scores for the rinses indicated a higher appreciation for CHX-CPC-Alc and CHX-NaF because of a better taste and fewer side effects. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that morning halitosis can be successfully reduced via daily use of mouthrinses.

Does a performance feedback based intervention lead to increased compliance? 3. 	Does such an intervention lead to a change in behavior of HCWs with regard to hand hygiene procedures and relevant care activities? 4. 	Do the variables of gender or professional group (nursing staff, physicians, other HCWs) affect compliance? The data collected was statistically analyzed and evaluated. 1. 	The overall rate of compliance was 57. 0 % in the first period and 61. 6 % in the second period (p < 0. 001). 2. 	Feedback based intervention led to a moderate increase in compliance in both the intervention and control groups. There was therefore no advantage to performance feedback as improvement was equal in both groups (intervention group 8. 8 percentage points (14. 7 %) (p = 0. 003), control group 8. 5 percentage points (15. 7 %) (p = 0. 005)). 3. 	Intervention did not cause a statistically significant effect regarding the different hand hygiene procedures. There was an increase in all hand hygiene procedures evaluated to be compliant in the second observation period. However, the number of failure to perform hand hygiene activities remained consistently high even after intervention. As regards the relevant care activities, significant results were only shown in some aspects. It was found that HCWs are more likely to carry out hand <b>hygiene</b> <b>measures</b> after patient care than before. A demonstrable positive effect (p < 0. 001) of intervention was shown on compliance after relevant care activities, but not before. Nevertheless, intervention can at best be considered a partial success as only hand hygiene activities that are performed before relevant care activities can significantly reduce the risk of infection to the patient. 4. 	The analysis of gender distribution showed no statistically significant differences. With respect to the professional groups, a statistically significant positive effect of intervention was only demonstrated for nursing staff. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed in order to identify significant factors influencing compliance. A significant odds ratio was identified for the comparison between the first and the second periods and for the implementation of hand <b>hygiene</b> <b>measures</b> after relevant care activities (for both the intervention and the control groups). Further studies with optimized interventions are necessary to improve compliance with hand <b>hygiene</b> <b>measures</b> and therefore reduce the risk of nosocomial infections...|$|R
