5|$|Season five {{features}} Monica and Chandler {{trying to}} keep their new relationship a secret from their friends. Phoebe gives birth to triplets in the show's 100th episode. She gives birth to a boy, Frank Jr. Jr., and two girls: Leslie and Chandler. (They had originally thought {{that there were two}} boys and one girl, but decided to keep the name Chandler, despite the baby turning out a girl.) Emily states that the only condition in which she would remain married to Ross <b>is</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> stops all communication with Rachel. Ross agrees, but during a last dinner with all six main characters together, Emily phones Ross and, upon discovering Rachel is there, realizes she does not trust him, which ends the marriage. Phoebe begins a relationship with a police officer, Gary (Michael Rapaport), after finding his badge and using it as her own. Monica and Chandler go public with their relationship, to the surprise and happiness of their friends. They decide to get married on a trip to Las Vegas, but change their plans after witnessing Ross and Rachel drunkenly stumble out of the wedding chapel.|$|E
500|$|Secretariat wintered in Florida {{but did not}} race until March 17, 1973 in the Bay Shore Stakes at Aqueduct, {{where he}} went off as the heavy favorite. As the trainer {{of one of his}} opponents put it, [...] "The only chance we have <b>is</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> falls down." [...] Racing boxed in by horses on each side, Turcotte decided to go through a narrow gap between horses rather than try to circle the field. Secretariat broke free and won easily, but one of the other jockeys claimed that Secretariat had {{committed}} a foul going through the hole. The stewards reviewed photos from the race and determined that Secretariat was actually {{on the receiving end of}} a bump, so let the result stand. The Bay Shore established that Secretariat had improved over the winter and that he could also handle adversity.|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, {{the season}} {{expanded}} to 16 games. There were also several rule changes in this period. In 2005, players {{were no longer}} allowed {{to run out of}} bounds. The only way for a player to go out of bounds presently <b>is</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> is tackled into or deliberately contacts the side boards. This was also the first year the ArenaBowl was played at a neutral site. In 2007, free substitution was allowed, ending the [...] "iron man" [...] era of one-platoon football; also, games ending in ties were abolished. And in 2008, the [...] "jack" [...] linebacker was allowed to go sideboard to sideboard without being penalized for [...] "illegal defense".|$|E

2500|$|Arriving on Earth-12, a {{universe}} resembling the Batman Beyond television series, another Monitor who has named himself Nix Uotan arrives, and informs Bob {{that all the}} Monitors have taken on names for themselves, such as the Monitor of Earth-8, who now calls himself Solomon. By stating that Ray Palmer lives [...] "a life of no consequence", he unintentionally reveals the location of Ray Palmer and Bob reasons {{that the only way}} Nix Uotan could know what Ray is doing <b>is</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was on his Earth. The group then arrive on Earth-51, a near-perfect world where super-crime has long been eradicated. They locate Ray, living the life of his deceased counterpart. Bob reveals himself to have been working for Solomon's cause and tells Ray that he must be exterminated. The Challengers attempt to stop Bob, who succeeds in killing the alternate versions of Barry Allen, Ralph Dibny and Jean Loring, but Ray and the Challengers escape. After Monarch descends upon Earth-51, with his Crime Society and Extremists recruits, Kyle and Ray are then confronted by Power Ring and alternate versions of Booster Gold and Supergirl, whilst elsewhere Donna faces an alternate version of herself as Jason fights with Gorgon of Earth-8.|$|E

Commander Raffleton, regretting his great need of haste, explained that he had found Malvina asleep beside a menhir not far from Huelgoat, in Brittany, and was afraid that he had woke her up. For further particulars, would the Professor kindly apply to Malvina? For himself, he would never, he felt sure, be able to thank the professor sufficiently.|$|E
