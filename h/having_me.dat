500|$|On August 25, 2010, Mitchell {{signed a}} two-year deal worth $3.5 million per {{season with the}} Los Angeles Kings. He had {{interest}} from several other teams, including the Washington Capitals and San Jose Sharks. The Canucks were also offering a one-year contract between $1.8 and $2 million, but were not willing to match the Kings' deal. Mitchell expressed disappointment in leaving the Canucks, but stated he was [...] "looking forward to going to a team which, I get the feeling, is really passionate about <b>having</b> <b>me</b> there." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the nature}} of the episode, many of the {{characters}} are dressed as cultural icons and characters from fiction. Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) is dressed as Scarlett Johansson's version of the superhero Black Widow from the 2012 superhero film The Avengers. Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) is dressed as Charlie Brown, the protagonist in the comic strip Peanuts by Charles M. Schulz. Angela is dressed as former First Lady Nancy Reagan, with her husband State Senator Robert Lipton wearing a Ronald Reagan mask. Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) is dressed as a dinosaur, but states that he is [...] "the Electoral College". Andy is dressed as George Michael. For the episode, Wilson's character is dressed up as a pig. Wilson noted that the [...] "writers really just wanted to torture me by <b>having</b> <b>me</b> in a pig's nose for an entire week of shooting".|$|E
500|$|Filming {{began in}} June 1990 and took eight weeks (a third {{less time than}} {{required}} by Miller's Crossing), and the estimated final budget for the movie was US$9 million. The Coens worked well with Deakins, and they easily translated their ideas for each scene onto film. [...] "There was only one moment we surprised him," [...] Joel Coen recalled later. An extended scene called for a tracking {{shot out of the}} bedroom and into a sink drain [...] "plug hole" [...] in the adjacent bathroom as a symbol of sexual intercourse. [...] "The shot {{was a lot of fun}} and we had a great time working out how to do it," [...] Joel said. [...] "After that, every time we asked Roger to do something difficult, he would raise an eyebrow and say, 'Don't be <b>having</b> <b>me</b> track down any plug-holes now.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Dear father!' cried Blockhead-Hans, 'I {{must have}} a horse too. What a desire for {{marriage}} <b>has</b> seized <b>me!</b> If she will <b>have</b> <b>me,</b> she WILL <b>have</b> <b>me,</b> and if she won't <b>have</b> <b>me,</b> I will <b>have</b> her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{would you}} <b>have</b> <b>me</b> say?" [...] {{and she looked}} at him through her tears, so haggard, so wild, so changed, that he was almost frightened at her countenance. [...] "What would you <b>have</b> <b>me</b> say? what would you <b>have</b> <b>me</b> do?" ...|$|R
500|$|The main cast was put {{together}} {{through a process of}} auditions and readings. Actors often did not know whether Chase liked their performances or not. Michael Imperioli, who beat out several actors for the part of Christopher Moltisanti, recalls [...] "He's got a poker face, so I thought he wasn't into me, and he kept giving me notes and <b>having</b> <b>me</b> try it again, which often is a sign that you're not doing it right. I thought, I'm not getting this. So he said, 'Thank you,' and I left. I didn't expect to hear back. And then they called." [...] Chase also said he wanted Imperioli because he had been in Goodfellas. James Gandolfini was invited to audition for the part of Tony Soprano after casting director Susan Fitzgerald saw a short clip of his performance in the 1993 film True Romance. Lorraine Bracco, who had played the role of mob wife Karen Hill in Goodfellas, was originally asked {{to play the role of}} Carmela Soprano. She took the role of Dr. Jennifer Melfi instead because she wanted to try something different and felt the part of the highly educated Dr. Melfi would be more of a challenge for her. Tony Sirico, who has a criminal background, signed on to play Paulie Walnuts as long as his character was not to be a [...] "rat".|$|E
500|$|Azaria did {{not expect}} to hear from the show again, but they {{continued}} to call him back, first to perform the voice of Chief Wiggum and then Apu Nahasapeemapetilon. He felt that, initially, [...] " [...] didn't seem too pleased with what I had done... was very exacting... was kind of impatiently directing me on the ABCs of comedy. But then, much to my surprise, he would still keep <b>having</b> <b>me</b> back every week. But each week, I {{thought it was going to}} be my last week because I really didn't think I had done that well." [...] Nevertheless, by the show's second season he was performing multiple recurring voices and so was given a contract and made a permanent member of the main cast. Since he joined later than the rest of the cast, Groening still considered Azaria the [...] "new guy". In addition to Moe, Wiggum and Apu, Azaria provides the voices of Comic Book Guy, Carl Carlson, Cletus Spuckler, Professor Frink, Dr. Nick Riviera, Lou, Snake Jailbird, Kirk Van Houten, the Sea Captain, Superintendent Chalmers, Disco Stu, Duffman, the Wiseguy and numerous one-time characters. His co-star in The Simpsons, Nancy Cartwright, wrote that: [...] "The thing about Hank that I most remember is that he started out so unassuming and then, little by little, his abilities were revealed and his contributions to the show escalated. I realized Hank was going to be our breakaway star." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Now they're <b>having</b> <b>me</b> sing. I sort of half-sing, half-talk, with hips-and-eye stuff. You {{know what}} I mean—like Maurice Chevalier. I {{used to sing}} at home and people would say, 'Pipe down! You're terrible!' But the studio thinks my voice is great." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By St. Paul! How {{would you}} <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> address him?" [...] he inquired. [...] "Would you <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> use cajolery with him--the lout? Would you <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> plead mercy from him, and beg him, in honeyed words, {{to be patient}} with a wilful lady? Let be, Messer Gonzaga, we shall weather it yet, never doubt it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What {{would you}} <b>have</b> <b>me</b> do?' he {{retorted}} {{in a kind}} of helpless desperation. 'It is easy to talk and sneer. What would you <b>have</b> <b>me</b> do?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, but I am {{not under}} His shadow! The Evil One <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> again! He will <b>have</b> <b>me.</b> Aren't those his claws? He will have me!" ...|$|R
2500|$|Barwick was {{featured}} as a stunt double on the Canadian TV series Heartland {{as a special}} guest. She {{always wanted to be}} in a film. She said, [...] "Looking at how easy it would have been for Heartland to hire an actor to ride a horse around and pretend to be paralyzed made the experience of <b>having</b> <b>me</b> there even more special." ...|$|E
2500|$|Viglione played drums on Fighting Naked, {{the debut}} album from his {{childhood}} friend Holly Brewer's band, HUMANWINE released through Warner Music Group's Cordless Recordings. Through March and April 2007, he went on a US national tour to support this release. Shortly thereafter, he performed drums for the Nine Inch Nails album, Ghosts I-IV. [...] "Collaborating with Trent on 'Ghosts' was a great experience and he really allowed {{it to be a}} truly creative atmosphere, in <b>having</b> <b>me</b> build a drum kit and allowing me to improvise my drum parts." [...] Around that time, he also wrote, toured, and recorded with various artists including the likes of Jules Shear, Jesse Malin, Martin Bisi, as well as Franz Nicolay/Major General.|$|E
2500|$|The Pesikta Rabbati {{taught that}} Joseph guarded himself against lechery and murder. That he guarded himself against lechery is {{demonstrated}} by the report of him in [...] “But he refused, and said to his master's wife: 'Behold, my master, <b>having</b> <b>me,</b> knows not {{what is in the}} house, and he has put all that he has into my hand; he is not greater in this house than I; neither has he kept back any thing from me but you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?” That he guarded himself against murder {{is demonstrated by}} his words in [...] “As for you, you meant evil against me; but God meant it for good.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yet {{you would}} not <b>have</b> <b>me</b> leave out one single line, {{you would not}} <b>have</b> <b>me</b> lower the torch for one second! You suggest caution!--you, who haven't the word 'fear' in your vocabulary! It is your house, not mine. There are more bombs to be bought in Paris. Yet tell <b>me,</b> would you <b>have</b> <b>me</b> spare a single word of the truth?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Father," [...] she pleaded, [...] "why be angry? You {{would not}} <b>have</b> <b>me</b> marry against the inclinations of my heart? You would not <b>have</b> <b>me</b> wedded {{to a man}} whom I despise?" ...|$|R

2500|$|In the post-fight interview, an {{emotional}} Fury said, [...] "This {{is a dream}} come true. We worked so hard for this. I've done it. It's hard to come to foreign countries ‎and get decisions. It just means {{so much to me}} to come here and get the decision." [...] He then took the microphone to thank Klitschko, [...] "I'd like to say to Wladimir, you're a great champion. And thanks very much for <b>having</b> <b>me.</b> It was all fun and games during the buildup." [...] Klitschko failed to throw his well-known right hand, mostly due to Fury's constant movement and mocking. He said, [...] "Tyson was the faster and better man tonight. I felt quite comfortable in the first six rounds, but I was astonished that Tyson was so fast in the second half as well. I couldn't throw my right hand because the advantage was the longer distance he had." [...] Klitschko had a rematch clause in place.|$|E
2500|$|Reports {{circulated}} in early 2011 that Gaga wanted the perfume to smell {{of blood and}} semen. However, the singer stated that while the perfume {{was based on the}} molecular structure of the two substances, it would not smell of them. She further explained that the blood element was based on a sample her own blood molecules to create [...] "a sense of <b>having</b> <b>me</b> on your skin". Rather than blood and semen, she said that the perfume would smell like an [...] "expensive hooker". The packaging lists the perfume's notes as [...] "tears of belladonna, crushed heart of tiger orchidea with a black veil of incense, pulverized apricot and the combinative essences of saffron and honey drops". According to the product packaging, instead of the pyramidal structure used in most perfumes, Lady Gaga Fame uses [...] "push-pull technology", where the ingredients demonstrate aspects of each note without precedence. Rather than utilizing top, middle, and base notes, the perfume is based on three accords – [...] "dark" [...] (containing the Belladonna notes), [...] "sensual" [...] (containing the honey, saffron, and apricot notes), and [...] "light" [...] (containing the Tiger Orchid notes) which come together to produce a floral, fruity scent.|$|E
