5|$|The Maine Coon {{is a long}} {{or medium}} haired cat. The coat is soft and silky, {{although}} texture may vary with coat color. The length is shorter on the <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulders,</b> and longer on the stomach and flanks with some cats having a lion-like ruff around their neck. Minimal grooming {{is required for the}} breed, compared to other long-haired breeds, as their coat is mostly self-maintaining owing to a light-density undercoat. The coat is subject to seasonal variation, with the fur being thicker in the winter and thinner during the summer.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, {{the body}} of a 34-year-old woman, eight months pregnant, was {{discovered}} in her apartment in Hamburg, Germany. The body was bloated and discolored, and upon initial examination, {{it was found that the}} head of the fetus had made its appearance in the vaginal opening. At autopsy, medical examiners found that both the <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulders</b> of the fetus had emerged, and concluded that it was a case of postmortem fetal extrusion in progress. The woman, who had given birth twice before, had died of a heroin overdose. The case was unusual and serendipitous, as few medical practitioners have been able to observe and document the progress of postmortem fetal extrusion.|$|E
5|$|Both species {{usually are}} solitary foragers, {{although}} the northern giant mouse lemur {{tends to be}} the most social, possibly due to its higher population density. Up to eight (typically four) adult males, adult females, and juveniles may be found in a northern giant mouse lemur nest, whereas Coquerel's giant mouse lemurs do not nest communally, except when females share their nest with their offspring. Males do groom and call to females when they come into contact, and according to radio-tracking and direct observations at Analabe near Kirindy, they form pair bonds, sometimes briefly traveling together during the dry season. However, most interactions between adults are infrequent and typically occur later at night and particularly during the dry season in overlapping core areas, often involving chases and other agonistic behavior, and only rarely social grooming. During the mating season, males act aggressively towards one another, pulling out fur around the <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulders</b> and biting the head.|$|E
5|$|Lyon later {{apologized to}} the House as a whole, {{claiming}} he had not known it was in session when he confronted Griswold, and meant no breach of decorum or disrespect to the body; he also provided a written letter of apology. Not satisfied with the apology, on February 15, 1798, Griswold retaliated by attacking Lyon with a wooden cane, beating him about the <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulders</b> in view of other representatives on the House floor. Lyon retreated to a fire pit and defended himself with the tongs until other Congressmen broke up the fight, with several pulling Griswold by his legs {{to get him to}} let go of Lyon. Although the committee appointed to investigate recommended censure of both Lyon and Griswold, the House as a whole rejected the motion. The issue was resolved when both Lyon and Griswold promised the House that they would keep the peace and remain on good behavior.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{proposes a}} face {{occlusion}} verification method for an {{automated teller machine}} (ATM) application. The proposed method mainly consists of three steps. Firstly, a <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> shape is detected by applying B-spline active contour to motion edges. This motion edge is generated by a kurtosis-based frame selection and distance transformationbased motion edge detection. Secondly, a face area is estimated by fitting an ellipse to the detected <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> shape. Finally, occlusion of the face area is determined by measuring skin color area ratio (SCAR) of whole face area and facial component areas. Experimental {{results show that the}} proposed <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulder</b> detection method has 94. 8 % detection rate even though there are various types of severe occlusions in faces, and the proposed occlusion verifier has 86. 7 % verification rate.
