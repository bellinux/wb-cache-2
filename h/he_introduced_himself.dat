500|$|When the Duke {{team went}} to the White House in honor of their {{championship}} in late May, President Obama caught Scheyer off guard by calling him [...] "my homeboy," [...] when <b>he</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>himself</b> to Scheyer, and then saying it again ("my homeboy from the Chicago area") {{when he said he}} had been following Scheyer since his high school days in Chicago. [...] Scheyer said: [...] "that was probably the coolest moment of my life." [...] Obama also noted that Scheyer, Kyle Singler, and Nolan Smith were the top-scoring trio in the NCAA for the year (at 52.4 points per game).|$|E
500|$|... "I {{was rather}} taken aback {{when the doctor}} entered the Anfield boot room", Wark said. [...] "He was small in stature and I {{could not help but}} detect the smell of alcohol on his breath as <b>he</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>himself</b> to me. I was even more {{surprised}} when he announced we would stay put to conduct the medical examination. [...] "He took my blood pressure, looked at the reading and muttered 'that's fine'. Then something happened that to this day I still cannot get over. He asked me to bend down and touch my toes. [...] "Trying not to show my surprise, I did exactly as he asked and as I lifted my head he spoke again, this time to announce 'you've passed'. That was it, my Liverpool medical." ...|$|E

500|$|Mengele's {{research}} {{subjects were}} better fed and housed than other prisoners and temporarily {{safe from the}} gas chambers. He established a kindergarten for children that were the subjects of experiments, along with all Romani {{children under the age}} of six. The facility provided better food and living conditions than other areas of the camp, and even included a playground. When visiting his child subjects, <b>he</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>himself</b> as [...] "Uncle Mengele" [...] and offered them sweets. But he was also personally responsible for the deaths of an unknown number of victims that he killed via lethal injection, shootings, beatings, and through selections and deadly experiments. Lifton describes Mengele as sadistic, lacking empathy, and extremely antisemitic, believing the Jews should be eliminated entirely as an inferior and dangerous race. Mengele's son Rolf said his father later showed no remorse for his wartime activities.|$|E
500|$|Blek {{was built}} for iOS by {{brothers}} Denis and Davor Mikan. While both had coding experience, neither were game developers by trade. This was their first game together as Kunabi Brother. Denis had published short stories and a novel, and Davor released music on a Crónica Electrónica. Davor previously made Flash games and developed the idea for Blek from this experience. He approached Denis about converting the video game Snake for touchscreens, and Denis returned {{with the idea of}} [...] "a line representing an idea that springs to life after it has been drawn". This thought was likely inspired by the calligraphy and ink drawings in a book by Japanese poet Matsuo Basho that Denis was reading. They had several prototypes by mid-2013, when Davor joined an Parisian artist in residence program, where he felt he was treated differently when <b>he</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>himself</b> as a game developer instead of as a musician. This experience invigorated his interest in the game medium and led to the brothers' push to finish the game over the next six months.|$|E

[...] Discovering that they enjoyed similar music, the two began writing songs together.|$|E

2500|$|At {{this time}} Brahms also chose {{to change his}} image. Having been always clean-shaven, in 1878 he {{surprised}} his friends by growing a beard, writing in September to the conductor Bernhard Scholz [...] "I am coming with a large beard! Prepare your wife for a most awful sight." [...] The singer George Henschel recalled that after a concert [...] "I saw a man unknown to me, rather stout, of middle height, with long hair and a full beard. In a very deep and hoarse voice <b>he</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>himself</b> as 'Musikdirektor Müller'... an instant later, we all found ourselves laughing heartily at the perfect success of Brahms's disguise". The incident also displays Brahms's love of practical jokes.|$|E

He established an alibi by going back out for some drinks, being sure to converse with others, before returning to retrieve Bennett's body and belongings to dispose of them. He was back on the road the next day. The body was found a few days later, but there were no suspects and no leads.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2011, Ali Khamenei {{supported}} the Egyptian uprising against their government, describing it as Islamic awakening instead of Arab Spring.

(Iranians are not Arabs, and Iran's official language is Persian) <b>He</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>himself</b> as [...] "your brother in religion", while praising the [...] "explosion of sacred anger". Later, in [...] "Islamic Awakening conferences" [...] which were held in Tehran, Khamenei praised the Muslim youths of Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Yemen and Bahrain for {{what he described as}} Islamic awakening. He also paralleled these events with Islamic revolution in Iran during his Nowruz oration in 2011. However, major protests against the Iranian regime also broke out throughout Iran in 2011, and they became known as the 2011–12 Iranian protests.|$|E

2500|$|More than 30 {{years after}} the Winter Soldier Investigation, during the 2004 presidential {{campaign}} in which former VVAW spokesman and Navy veteran John Kerry was a candidate, the WSI was again in the news. [...] Steve Pitkin, who participated at the investigation in 1971, now claimed just weeks before the presidential election at an anti-Kerry political rally {{that he was not}} originally planning to testify at the WSI, but was pressured by Kerry and others into testifying about rape, brutality, atrocities and racism. Pitkin also signed a 2004 affidavit making similar claims about Kerry, but after being challenged by other participants, admitted that his recollections were flawed. [...] On 1971 archival film footage of the WSI panel, Pitkin criticized the press for its coverage of the war, and detailed what he considered poor training for combat in Vietnam, and low morale he claimed to have witnessed while there. Although <b>he</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>himself</b> by saying, [...] "I'll testify about the beating of civilians and enemy personnel, destruction of villages, indiscriminate use of artillery, the general racism and the attitude of the American GI toward the Vietnamese," [...] his actual testimony contained no such statements.|$|E

[...] On May 28, 1928, Fish, then 58years old, visited the Budd family in Manhattan under the pretense of hiring Edward; he later confessed {{that he planned to}} tie Edward up, mutilate him, and leave him to bleed to death. <b>He</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>himself</b> as Frank Howard, a farmer from Farmingdale, New York. Fish promised to hire Budd and his friend Willie, and said he would send for them in a few days. He failed to show up, but he sent a telegraph to the Budd family apologizing and set a later date. When Fish returned, he met Grace Budd. He apparently changed his intended victim from Edward Budd to Grace Budd and quickly made up a story about having to attend his niece's birthday party. He convinced the parents, Delia Flanagan and Albert Budd I, to let Grace accompany him to the party that evening. The elder Albert Budd was a porter for the United States Equitable Life Assurance Society. Grace had a younger sister, Beatrice, two older brothers, Edward and George Budd, and a younger brother, Albert Budd II. Grace left with Fish that day but never returned.|$|E
