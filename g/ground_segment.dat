2500|$|In May 2009, Anatoly Perminov, then {{director}} of the Russian Federal Space Agency, stated that actions were undertaken to expand GLONASS's constellation and to improve the <b>ground</b> <b>segment</b> to increase the [...] navigation definition of GLONASS to an accuracy of [...] by 2011. In particular, the latest satellite design, GLONASS-K {{has the ability to}} double the system's accuracy once introduced. The system's <b>ground</b> <b>segment</b> is also to undergo improvements. As of early 2012, sixteen positioning ground stations are under construction in Russia and in the Antarctic at the Bellingshausen and Novolazarevskaya bases. New stations will be built around the southern hemisphere from Brazil to Indonesia. Together, these improvements are expected to bring GLONASS' accuracy to 0.6m or better by 2020.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>ground</b> <b>segment</b> is {{composed}} of multiple Wide-area Reference Stations (WRS). These precisely surveyed ground stations monitor and collect information on the GPS signals, then send their data to three Wide-area Master Stations (WMS) using a terrestrial communications network. The reference stations also monitor signals from WAAS geostationary satellites, providing integrity information regarding them as well. As of October 2007 there were 38 WRSs: [...] twenty in the contiguous United States (CONUS), seven in Alaska, one in Hawaii, one in Puerto Rico, five in Mexico, and four in Canada.|$|E
2500|$|The {{squadron}} {{is responsible}} for command {{and control of the}} Milstar and Advanced Extremely High Frequency satellites through dedicated extremely high frequency antennas and the Air Force Satellite Control Network. The multi-satellite constellation links command authorities to high priority United States forces via communications terminals on aircraft, ships, submarines, trucks and ground sites with encrypted voice and data. [...] The <b>ground</b> <b>segment</b> consists of a fixed site located in the Satellite Operations Building at Schriever Air Force Base and a site at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. [...] The squadron also operated three geographically distributed Advanced Ground Mobile vehicles. At higher readiness levels and during exercises, squadron personnel deploy with United States Northern Command and United States Strategic Command to provide survivable, secure communications and command and control. [...] Milstar has about 1500 terminals. [...] As the Advanced Extremely High Frequency network becomes fully operational it will add 5000 additional terminals and serve forces from Canada, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.|$|E

2500|$|Each Galileo {{satellite}} has two master passive {{hydrogen maser}} atomic clocks and two secondary rubidium atomic clocks which {{are independent of}} one other. As precise and stable space-qualified atomic clocks are critical components to any satellite-navigation system, the employed quadruple redundancy keeps Galileo functioning when onboard atomic clocks fail in space. The onboard passive hydrogen maser clocks' precision is four times better than the onboard rubidium atomic clocks and estimated at 1 second per 3 million years (a timing error of a nanosecond or 1 billionth of a second (10−9 or 1/1,000,000,000 s) translates into a [...] positional error on Earth's surface), and will provide an accurate timing signal to allow a receiver to calculate {{the time that it}} takes the signal to reach it. The Galileo satellites are configured to run one hydrogen maser clock in primary mode and a rubidium clock as hot backup. Under normal conditions, the operating hydrogen maser clock produces the reference frequency from which the navigation signal is generated. Should the hydrogen maser encounter any problem, an instantaneous switchover to the rubidium clock would be performed. In case of a failure of the primary hydrogen maser the secondary hydrogen maser could be activated by the <b>ground</b> <b>segment</b> to take over within a period of days as part of the redundant system. A clock monitoring and control unit provides the interface between the four clocks and the navigation signal generator unit (NSU). It passes the signal from the active hydrogen master clock to the NSU and also ensures that the frequencies produced by the master clock and the active spare are in phase, so that the spare can take over instantly should the master clock fail. The NSU information is used to calculate the position of the receiver by trilaterating the difference in received signals from multiple satellites.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} several {{classes of}} intersection graphs of line segments {{in the plane}} and prove new equality and separation results between those classes. In particular, we show that: (1) intersection graphs of <b>grounded</b> <b>segments</b> and intersection graphs of downward rays form the same graph class, (2) not every intersection graph of rays is an intersection graph of downward rays, and (3) not every intersection graph of rays is an outer segment graph. The first result answers an open problem posed by Cabello and Jejčič. The third result confirms a conjecture by Cabello. We thereby completely elucidate the remaining open questions on the containment relations between these classes of segment graphs. We further characterize {{the complexity of the}} recognition problems for the classes of outer <b>segment,</b> <b>grounded</b> <b>segment,</b> and ray intersection graphs.

The benefits of ARAIM {{would include a}} reduced ground infrastructure, a reduced dependency on any one GNSS core constellation, and, in general, a lesser exposure to single points of failure. In ARAIM, as in RAIM, the aircraft compares the various ranging measurements that it makes to different satellites {{to ensure that they}} are consistent with each other. However, for the aircraft to meet its integrity requirement, the satellites must perform within a certain set of expectations. Current GNSS <b>ground</b> <b>segments</b> deployed or under deployment may not offer sufficient guarantees that these expectations will always be met. For this reason, ARAIM will require an independent ground monitor that would provide an Integrity Support Message to the users.
