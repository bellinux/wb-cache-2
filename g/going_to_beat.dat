Beckett’s plays often have a certain open-endedness and this sketch is no different. Perhaps because it has taken so little time to build up to this climax it lacks the {{resonance}} of Endgame’s concluding scene where we never know if Clov ever leaves Hamm or the close of Happy Days where the audience is left wondering if Willie is reaching for the gun or for Winnie.|$|E
500|$|Before a 1994 {{playoff game}} against the Steelers' long-time rival Cleveland Browns, Steelers {{defensive}} tackle Brentson Buckner accidentally dropped a Towel that he was waving during the player introductions. Browns running back Earnest Byner stepped on the Towel yelling, [...] "We don't care about your towel. We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> you this time." [...] This act [...] "provok other Steelers and Browns to mingle. Not affectionately." [...] The Steelers won the game 299.|$|E
500|$|Some bookmakers {{made the}} Yankees a 15-to-1 Series favorite, while others, like New York's top betting commissioners, thought the teams were evenly matched. One New York Times writer found [...] "little {{justification}} for installing either team as the favorite". Regardless of the odds, players from both teams were confident of victory. Hornsby said, [...] "We're {{going to come}} through winners. We have the better pitching staff, the better hitters and the greater experience. That's {{what it takes to}} win. ... We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> the Yankees. Any of my ball players will tell you that, and we expect to do it." [...] Yankee skipper Miller Huggins retorted, ...|$|E

500|$|After McCain and Palin were {{defeated}} in the general election, a Republican campaign advisor told The New York Times that the McCain Campaign was not happy about the prank, which caused friction between McCain and Palin. McCain and his advisors were allegedly upset that Palin did not tell them beforehand that she planned to speak with who she thought was Nicolas Sarkozy. McCain strategist Steve Schmidt called a meeting and demanded to know who let Palin talk to the fake Sarkozy without checking with senior advisors first. Steve Biegun, one of Palin's aides admitting to vetting the call without speaking to campaign advisors or the U.S. State Department, told the Los Angeles Times that [...] "No one's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> me up more than I beat myself up for setting up the governor like that." ...|$|E
500|$|Busch also commented, [...] "When Jeff Gordon {{has a good}} car and he's got the {{opportunity}} to beat you, he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> you, there's no doubt about that. He's my hero and I've always watched him and what he's been able to accomplish over the years, so it's no surprise that he beat us." [...] The race result left Kyle Busch leading the Driver's Championship with 80 points. Kurt Busch, who finished eighth, was second with 77, eight points ahead of Stewart and Allmendinger. Gordon was fifth with 65 points. Ford maintained their lead in the Manufacturers' Championship with 12 points.

500|$|Although {{he was a}} striker, Dickov {{was better}} known for his {{tenacity}} than his goal-scoring exploits. In a 2003 interview with the Independent on Sunday he provided a summary of his playing style: [...] "The ability to battle {{is one of the}} main parts of my game. I know my limits. I am not the sort who gets the ball and is then <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> five or six players and stick it in the top corner from God knows where. But, whether I'm playing well or not, the one thing you will get from me is 110 per cent, upsetting defenders and basically giving them pain." [...] Rio Ferdinand was mentioning his name as the biggest headache to deal with on the pitch. His combative approach resulted in Manchester City manager Joe Royle naming him [...] "The Wasp", and during his time at Leicester he was known as [...] "The Pest".|$|E

500|$|In August 2005, ABC {{announced}} that Dick Clark {{would return to}} New Year's Rockin' Eve for its 2006 edition, marking his first television appearance since the stroke. For that broadcast, it was also announced Clark would {{be joined by a}} new co-host, media personality and American Idol host Ryan Seacrest. Seacrest had previously hosted Fox's competing New Year's Eve Live—which, ironically, would be hosted by Philbin that year. Speaking to USA Today, Seacrest reminisced on having watched New Year's Rockin' Eve in his childhood, stating that [...] "I knew when I was on other shows, I knew we weren't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> Dick Clark. He is New Year's Eve." [...] As a part of a long-term deal with Dick Clark Productions, Seacrest also became an executive producer for the special. In an interview with People Magazine in December 2005, Seacrest revealed that while Clark had not completely recovered from the stroke, and that his speech was not exactly like how it was beforehand, Clark had made great progress since the original diagnosis.|$|E
500|$|Strauss {{was born}} in St Ulrich near Vienna (now a part of Neubau), Austria, on October 25, 1825, to the {{composer}} Johann Strauss I. His paternal great-grandfather was a Hungarian Jew – a fact which the Nazis, who lionised Strauss's music as [...] "so German", later tried to conceal. His father did {{not want him to}} become a musician but rather a banker. Nevertheless, Strauss Junior studied the violin secretly as a child with the first violinist of his father's orchestra, Franz Amon. When his father discovered his son secretly practising on a violin one day, he gave him a severe whipping, saying that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> the music out of the boy. It seems that rather than trying to avoid a Strauss rivalry, the elder Strauss only wanted his son to escape the rigours of a musician's life. It was only when the father abandoned his family for a mistress, , that the son was able to concentrate fully on a career as a composer with the support of his mother.|$|E
500|$|Kyle Busch, who {{finished}} second, said, [...] "He {{was on a}} mission today, that's for sure. When Jeff Gordon has a good car {{and he has the}} opportunity to beat you, he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> you. He's my hero. I've always watched him and what he's been able to accomplish over the years." [...] In the subsequent press conference, pole position winner, Edwards, stated his frustration at his accident, [...] "I’m not exactly sure what happened. I’ll have to talk to Kyle about it. I thought at first he was just frustrated and he turned left to get back in line and he didn’t know I was there, but I watched the tape and I think he really did get loose. He hit me hard and I was left with nothing. I got rammed to the infield." [...] Rick Hendrick, the owner of Hendrick Motorsports, expressed his enjoyment of winning the race, stating, [...] "When you're a champion like Jeff Gordon, you know you can still do it, (even) when people overlook you. He's been right there but he hasn't had that edge. I think we're {{going to see a lot}} of momentum out of that team right now." ...|$|E

500|$|Going {{into the}} event, Phelps' compatriot Ian Crocker {{was seen as}} the swimmer with the best chance of beating Phelps. Crocker beat Phelps' 100 metre {{butterfly}} world record in 2003, and had since lowered it twice: once at the 2004 United States Olympic trials, and then at the 2005 World Championships in Montreal. Before the Olympics, Crocker and Phelps held the seventeen fastest times ever in the event. In 2004, Crocker was the favorite in the men's 100 metre butterfly, but lost to Phelps by four hundredths of a second. This victory gave Phelps the right to swim in the final of the 4 × 100 metre medley relay, however he gave up the spot to Crocker, and took his turn in the semifinals. Although holding the world record, Crocker had lost the last four times that he was up against Phelps in the 100 metre butterfly, including the 2008 United States Olympic Trials. Some thought that Crocker was not in the same shape that he was when we broke the world record, including Canadian Broadcasting Company (CBC) analyst Byron MacDonald who said that [...] "If he's (Crocker) <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> Phelps in Beijing, Crocker has to get close to his world record time of 50.40. He just hasn't shown it [...] can do it this year".|$|E
