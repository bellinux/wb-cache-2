40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with acknowledging <b>farm</b> <b>animals</b> and their co-presence in the more-than-human space of the livestock farm, and with accounting for them responsibly in sustainability debates. The enrolment of <b>farm</b> <b>animals</b> as actors in political agendas for environmental sustainability, and <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> welfare {{suggests that there are}} new ways of seeing and being with <b>farm</b> <b>animals</b> that permit their relational presence and recognise their subjectivity. Indeed geographers have in recent years acknowledged animals and their relations with humans, and they have begun to recognise the nature of animal subjectivies. However, within the fundamental rethinking of animals that has been provoked by these discussions, I suggest that <b>farm</b> <b>animals</b> have remained relatively invisible. Occupying ethically confusing terrain, <b>farm</b> <b>animals</b> have nonetheless been visible in a set of philosophical positions regarding their moral status, yet these debates present a rather confusing picture in which the <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> as an individual is conspicuous by its absence. In seeking to redress the invisibility of <b>farm</b> <b>animals</b> within these debates, and recast them in relation to humans and the broader farm ecology, this thesis attempts to set out an epistemological and methodological framework through which <b>farm</b> <b>animals</b> might become visible as individual fleshy beings. Drawing on the concept of agricultural stewardship and new agendas in <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> welfare science, it makes use of new methodological tools that have emerged in the social sciences to conduct a relational study of the livestock farm; a study in which <b>farm</b> <b>animals</b> themselves participate. It also considers how the divisions that have been constructed between humans, <b>farm</b> <b>animals</b> and the environment can be reconfigured as a more unified political science of the livestock farm.

40|$|Concerns {{about the}} welfare of {{agricultural}} animals in corporate or “factory farming” systems are growing. Increasingly, {{it is suggested that}} modern <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> production practices are morally objectionable, causing physical and mental suffering to animals. Such criticisms are premised on beliefs about the mental capacities of <b>farm</b> <b>animals</b> that are not wholly supported by scientific evidence, for little is known about <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> cognition. Some animal scientists, realizing that concerns about the treatment of agricultural animals cannot be addressed in absence of knowledge about <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> mentality, have begun cognitive studies of <b>farm</b> <b>animals.</b> Subsequently, several ethical problems have emerged. In this paper it is argued that while <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> cognition studies are needed, scientists must consider the moral problems and implications of the research, and must devise empirically testable hypotheses about those aspects of cognitive behavior that are relevant to discussions about moral treatment of <b>farm</b> <b>animals...</b>|$|R

40|$|Antimicrobial use in <b>farm</b> <b>animals</b> might {{contribute}} to the development of antimicrobial resistance in humans and animals, and there is an urgent need to reduce antimicrobial use in <b>farm</b> <b>animals.</b> Veterinarians are typically responsible for prescribing and overseeing antimicrobial use in animals. A thorough understanding of veterinarians' current prescribing practices and their reasons to prescribe antimicrobials might offer leads for interventions to reduce antimicrobial use in <b>farm</b> <b>animals.</b> This paper presents the results of a qualitative study of factors that influence prescribing behaviour of <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> veterinarians. Semi-structured interviews with eleven <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> veterinarians were conducted, which were taped, transcribed and iteratively analysed. This preliminary analysis was further discussed and refined in an expert meeting. A final conceptual model was derived from the analysis and sent to all the respondents for validation. Many conflicting interests are identifiable when it comes to antimicrobial prescribing by <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> veterinarians. Belief in the professional obligation to alleviate animal suffering, financial dependency on clients, risk avoidance, shortcomings in advisory skills, financial barriers for structural veterinary herd health advisory services, lack of farmers' compliance to veterinary recommendations, public health interests, personal beliefs regarding the veterinary contribution to antimicrobial resistance and major economic powers are all influential determinants in antimicrobial prescribing behaviour of <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> veterinarians. Interventions to change prescribing behaviour of <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> veterinarians could address attitudes and advisory skills of veterinarians, as well as provide tools to deal with (perceived) pressure from farmers and advisors to prescribe antimicrobials.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> {{sector is}} the single largest {{anthropogenic}} user of land, contributing to many environmental problems, including global warming and climate change. OBJECTIVES: The {{aim of this study}} was to synthesize and expand upon existing data on the contribution of <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> production to climate change. METHODS: We analyzed the scientific literature on <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> production and documented greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as well as various mitigation strategies. DISCUSSIONS: An analysis of meat, egg, and milk production encompasses not only the direct rearing and slaughtering of animals, but also grain and fertilizer production for animal feed, waste storage and disposal, water use, and energy expenditures on farms and in transporting feed and finished animal products, among other key impacts of the production process as a whole. CONCLUSIONS: Immediate and far-reaching changes in current animal agriculture practices and consumption patterns are both critical and timely if GHGs from the <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> sector are to be mitigated.
