5|$|If k2 {{is greater}} than one, F2−F1 <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> number; thus, the added inverse-cube force is attractive, as {{observed}} in the green planet of Figures1–4 and 9. By contrast, if k2 is less than one, F2−F1 is a positive number; the added inverse-cube force is repulsive, as observed in the green planet of Figures5 and 10, and in the red planet of Figures4 and 5.|$|E
5|$|The poem's {{narrative}} {{echoes the}} text of the Nunc dimittis, a liturgical prayer for Compline derived from the Gospel passage. Eliot introduces literary allusions to earlier writers Lancelot Andrewes, Dante Alighieri and St. John of the Cross. Several critics have debated whether Eliot's depiction of Simeon <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> portrayal of a Jewish figure and evidence of anti-Semitism on Eliot's part.|$|E

5|$|The {{imperative}} mood is used {{to issue}} orders. It is always combined with the second person. The optative {{is used to}} express wishes or exhortations and is never used with the second person. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> imperative form used to issue prohibitions. Both optative and imperative have transitive and intransitive paradigms. There are two transitive positive imperative paradigms: a standard one, {{and one that is}} considered rude and is usually used to address children.|$|E
5|$|The dusky {{crag martin}} feeds mainly on insects caught in flight. When nesting, birds often fly {{back and forth}} near to a rock face or {{building}} hunting for their prey. This martin is more gregarious outside the breeding season, and may form small flocks where food is abundant. Vertical surfaces are preferred for hunting, and {{a study of the}} Eurasian crag martin, which has a similar foraging technique, showed that cliff faces generate standing waves in the airflow which concentrate insects near vertical areas. The martin exploits the area close to the cliff when it hunts, relying on its high manoeuvrability and ability to perform tight turns. When feeding young, foraging is concentrated on the profitable patches in the immediate vicinity of the nest, since there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> correlation between foraging distance and feeding rate.|$|E

25|$|Shyness {{can also}} be seen as an {{academic}} determinant. It has been determined that there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> relationship between shyness and classroom performance. As the shyness of an individual increased, classroom performance was seen to decrease.|$|E
25|$|The gamma {{distribution}} {{has been used}} to model the size of insurance claims and rainfalls. This means that aggregate insurance claims and the amount of rainfall accumulated in a reservoir are modelled by a gamma process. The {{gamma distribution}} is also used to model errors in multi-level Poisson regression models, because the combination of the Poisson distribution and a gamma distribution <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> binomial distribution.|$|E

50|$|An example would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> {{cross-sectional}} {{relationship between}} illness and vaccination, {{if it is}} observed that where the incidence of one is higher than average, the incidence of the other tends to be lower than average. Similarly, there would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> temporal relationship between illness and vaccination if it is observed in one location that times with a higher-than-average incidence of one tend to coincide with a lower-than-average incidence of the other.|$|R

25|$|The {{existence}} of a tax can increase economic efficiency in some cases. If there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> externality associated with a good, meaning that it has negative effects not felt by the consumer, then a free market will trade {{too much of that}} good. By taxing the good, the government can increase overall welfare as well as raising revenue. This type of tax is called a Pigovian tax, after economist Arthur Pigou.|$|E
25|$|Like Xist, the Tsix gene encodes a large RNA {{which is}} not {{believed}} to encode a protein. The Tsix RNA is transcribed antisense to Xist, meaning that the Tsix gene overlaps the Xist gene and is transcribed on the opposite strand of DNA from the Xist gene. Tsix <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> regulator of Xist; X chromosomes lacking Tsix expression (and thus having high levels of Xist transcription) are inactivated much more frequently than normal chromosomes.|$|E
25|$|Upstream, PI3K/AKT {{signalling}} is deregulated {{through a}} variety of mechanisms, including overexpression or activation of growth factor receptors, such as HER-2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) and IGFR (insulin-like growth factor receptor), mutations in PI3K and mutations/amplifications of AKT. Tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> regulator of PI3K signaling. In many cancers the PTEN expression is decreased and may be downregulated through several mechanisms, including mutations, loss of heterozygosity, methylation, and protein instability.|$|E

50|$|When this {{metal master}} {{was removed from}} the lacquer (master), it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> master or master matrix, since it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> copy of the lacquer. (In the UK, this was called the master; note the {{difference}} from soft master/lacquer disc above). In the earliest days the negative master <b>was</b> used as <b>a</b> mold to press records sold to the public, but as demand for mass production of records grew, another step was added to the process.|$|R

25|$|When the sun warms the Earth's surface, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> {{temperature}} gradient in atmosphere. The {{speed of sound}} decreases with decreasing temperature, so this also creates a negative sound speed gradient. The sound wave front travels faster near the ground, so the sound is refracted upward, away from listeners on the ground, creating an acoustic shadow at {{some distance from the}} source. The radius of curvature of the sound path is inversely proportional to the velocity gradient.|$|E
25|$|Free workers also earn {{compensating}} differentials, whereby {{they are}} paid more for doing unpleasant work. Neither sustenance nor enforcement costs rise with the unpleasantness of the work, however, so slaves' costs do not rise by the same amount. As such, slaves are more attractive for unpleasant work, and less for pleasant work. Because the unpleasantness {{of the work is}} not internalised, being born by the slave rather than the owner, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> externality and leads to over-use of slaves in these situations.|$|E
25|$|The die <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> {{image of}} the glass master: typically, several are made, {{depending}} {{on the number of}} pressing mills that are to make the CD. The die then goes into a press, and the physical image is transferred to the blank CD, leaving a final positive image on the disc. A small amount of lacquer is applied as a ring around the center of the disc, and rapid spinning spreads it evenly over the surface. Edge protection lacquer is applied before the disc is finished. The disc can then be printed and packed.|$|E
