5|$|On February 28, 1985, Congressman James H. Weaver gave {{a speech}} in the United States House of Representatives in which he {{asserted}} that the Rajneeshees {{were involved in the}} bioterror attack in Oregon. At a series of press conferences in September 1985, Rajneesh accused several of his recently departed lieutenants of <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> and other crimes, including the poisoning of Mike Sullivan, a Jefferson County district attorney, and asked state and federal authorities to investigate his allegations. The assassination plot was uncovered by federal law enforcement {{as a result of the}} ensuing investigation into activities at Rajneeshpuram. Turner was never physically harmed, and had retired by 1995.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Poland, he fought in 1626 against the Swedes {{in the last}} phase of the Polish–Swedish War, where he {{took part in the}} battle of Gniew. His <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> conflict, which lasted till the Truce of Altmark in 1629, was rather limited, and he spent much time {{in other parts of the}} country. During that period and afterward, he lobbied for support of his candidature for the Polish throne, as his father, Sigismund, was getting more advanced in his age, and the succession to the Polish throne did not occur through inheritance but rather through the process of royal elections. While Władysław, and his father Sigismund, tried to ensure Władysław's election during Sigismund's life, this was not a popular option for the nobility, and it repeatedly failed, up to and including at the sejm of 1631. Sigismund suffered a sudden heart attack on 23 April 1632 and died in the morning hours of 30 April, forcing the issue to be taken up again.|$|E

5|$|In 1950, the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War and Britain's heavy <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> conflict led to a flurry of orders being issued; the need for capable modern interceptors was felt to be so pressing that the RAF was willing to consider accepting interim fighter aircraft while more capable fighters would continue to be pursued. In particular, the RAF felt that a pair of proposed fighter aircraft from Hawker Aircraft and Supermarine were of high importance and thus placed orders for these proposed fighters 'off the drawing board' in 1950. The reasoning behind these two aircraft being ordered in 1950 was intended to serve as an insurance policy in the event of either one of these projects failing to produce a viable aircraft; these two aircraft would later become known as the Supermarine Swift and the Hawker Hunter respectively.|$|E

25|$|Cassiterite {{production}} {{peaked at}} 1,000 tonnes in 1990, but was under 700 tonnes in 2000.

At {{least part of}} the increase in production is because of new mines opening up in Rwanda. However it is true, as has frequently been observed, that the increase is also because of the fraudulent re-export of Congolese coltan. In addition to the well-publicised <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> trade of the Rwandan Defence Force (RDF), another important factor in the coltan re-export is that international dealers are under pressure not to buy from the DRC, thus increasing the incentive for DRC coltan to be re-exported as Rwanda's. Rwanda is also alleged to be trading in fraudulently exported gold and diamonds from the DRC.|$|E

The Undertaker and Kane's rivalry resurfaced during the match, but they patched their relationship up soon after. Kane later turned heel by assaulting The Undertaker, leading to a match between the two at SummerSlam. The match ended when The Undertaker removed Kane's mask, causing him to flee the ring, covering his exposed face. Kane stayed in contention for the WWF Championship {{for the remainder of}} the year and ended 2000 in a feud with Chris Jericho; Kane defeated him at Survivor Series and again at Rebellion, but he ultimately lost to Jericho in a Last Man Standing match at Armageddon.|$|E
25|$|Much of Brady's overall <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> {{conflict}} was peripheral. On {{the afternoon of}} June 8, 1832, Henry Dodge and his men, including James W.

That night Stephenson returned to Galena, Illinois, while Dodge moved to Hickory Point where he remained overnight. The next morning Dodge set out for Dixon's Ferry, where he camped with General Brady. On June 11, Dodge escorted Brady to the mouth of the Fox River to confer with Atkinson. Dodge left the conference with clear authority from Atkinson to deal with the violence in the mining region. Hugh Brady set out for Fort Hamilton, with the brigade commanded by Alexander Posey and his two companies of regulars, on June 20. Brady was eventually given a larger force but was stricken with dysentery in July and did not participate further in the war.|$|E
