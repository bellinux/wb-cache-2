5|$|In general, {{motion is}} {{classified}} {{according to the}} anatomical plane it occurs in. <b>Flexion</b> <b>and</b> <b>extension</b> are examples of angular motions, in which two axes of a joint are brought closer together or moved further apart. Rotational motion may occur at other joints, for example the shoulder, and are described as internal or external. Other terms, such as elevation and depression, describe movement above or below the horizontal plane. Many anatomical terms derive from Latin terms with the same meaning.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{symptom of}} prepatellar {{bursitis}} is the {{swelling of the}} area around the kneecap. It generally does not produce a significant amount of pain unless pressure is applied directly to the swelling. The area of swelling may be red (erythema), warm to the touch, or surrounded by cellulitis, particularly if the area has become infected. In such cases, the bursitis is often accompanied by fever. Unlike arthritis, prepatellar bursitis generally does not affect the range of motion of the knee, though it may cause some discomfort when the knee is completely flexed. <b>Flexion</b> <b>and</b> <b>extension</b> of the knee may cause crepitus.|$|E

It is important to verify {{at the end of}} the procedure that there is some lateral patellar translation with the knee extended, with a firm lateral endpoint. Furthermore, the correct patellar tracking is also assessed dynamically under arthroscopic view.|$|R
25|$|In this {{articulation}} {{the movements}} permitted are <b>flexion</b> <b>and</b> <b>extension</b> {{in the plane}} of the palm of the hand, abduction and adduction in a plane at right angles to the palm, circumduction, and opposition.|$|E
25|$|Whiplash can be {{described}} as a sudden strain to the muscles, bones and nerves in the neck. The neck is made up of seven vertebrae, referred to as the cervical vertebrae. The first two cervical vertebrae, the axis and atlas, are shaped differently from the remaining five. The atlas and axis are responsible for movement of the skull from side to side (cervical rotation to the right and left); also moving forward and backward (cervical <b>flexion</b> <b>and</b> <b>extension).</b> Excessive extension and flexion can disrupt the vertebrae.|$|E
25|$|Muscle {{action that}} moves the axial {{skeleton}} work over a joint with an origin and insertion {{of the muscle}} on respective side. The insertion is on the bone deemed to move towards the origin during muscle contraction. Muscles are often present that engage in several actions of the joint; able to perform for example both <b>flexion</b> <b>and</b> <b>extension</b> of the forearm as in the biceps and triceps respectively. This {{is not only to}} be able to revert actions of muscles, but also brings on stability of the actions though muscle coactivation.|$|E

40|$|Mammalian {{locomotion}} {{is characterized}} by the use of asymmetrical gaits associated with extensive <b>flexions</b> <b>and</b> <b>extensions</b> of the body axis. Although the impact of sagittal spine movements on locomotion is well known, little information is available on the kinematics of spinal motion. Intervertebral joint movements were studied in two metatherian and three eutherian species during the gallop and halfbound using high-speed cineradiography. Fast-Fourier transformation was used to filter out high frequency digitizing errors and keep the lower frequency sinusoid oscillations that characterize the intervertebral angular movements. Independent of their regional classification as thoracic or lumbar vertebrae, 7 ± 1 presacral intervertebral joints were involved in sagittal bending movements.

25|$|Active {{treatments}} are light repetitive exercises that work {{the area to}} maintain normality. Basic information is also given to teach the patient that exercises as instructed will not cause any damage to their neck. These exercises are done at home or {{under the care of}} a health professional. When beginning a rehabilitation regimen, it's important to begin with slow movements which include cervical rotation until pain threshold three to five times per day, <b>flexion</b> <b>and</b> <b>extension</b> of the shoulder joint by moving the arms up and down two to three times, and combining shoulder raises while inhaling and releasing the shoulder raise while exhaling. Soderlund and colleagues also recommend that these exercises should be done every day until pain starts to dissipate. Early mobilization is important for preventing chronic pain, but pain experienced from these exercises might cause psychological symptoms that could have negative impact on recovery. Rosenfeld found that doing active exercises as often as once every waken hour during one month after trauma decreases the need for sick leave three years after trauma from 25% to 5.7%.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the tail's ability to {{function}} as a proprioceptive sensor/modulator has also been investigated. As aforementioned, the tail demonstrates a high degree of muscularization and subsequent innervation that ostensibly collaborate in orienting the organism. Specifically, this is accomplished by coordinated <b>flexion</b> <b>and</b> <b>extension</b> of tail muscles to produce slight shifts in the organism's center of mass, orientation, etc., which ultimately assists it with achieving a state of proprioceptive balance in its environment. Further mechanobiological investigations of the constituent tendons in the tail of the rat have identified multiple factors that influence how the organism navigates its environment with this structure. A particular example is that of a study in which the morphology of these tendons is explicated in detail. Namely, cell viability tests of tendons of the rat's tail demonstrate a higher proportion of living fibroblasts that produce the collagen for these fibers. As in humans, these tendons contain a high density of golgi tendon organs that help the animal assess stretching of muscle in situ and adjust accordingly by relaying the information to higher cortical areas associated with balance, proprioception, and movement.|$|E

[Results] We found that toe-grip strength was significantly lower in the 90 ° hip <b>flexion</b> <b>and</b> knee <b>extension</b> sitting position than in the 90 ° hip <b>and</b> knee <b>flexion</b> sitting position <b>and</b> standing position. Moreover, the 90 ° hip <b>and</b> knee <b>flexion</b> sitting position produced the best intraclass correlation coefficient (r = 0. 813). [Conclusion] The results suggest that 90 ° hip <b>and</b> knee <b>flexion</b> while sitting is the most suitable limb position for measuring toe-grip strength, as this position allows maximum strength to be exerted and allows measurements to be repeated...|$|R

2500|$|A {{number of}} {{processes}} are inhibited once the initial flexion has begun.

Long IPSPs are generated to prevent these events. [...] The extensor muscles are inhibited to prevent competition between the extensor and flexors. Rapid IPSPs presented at the muscle receptor organ (MRO) [...] prevent the stretch receptor from initiating extension while they are also presented at the fast extensor motor neurons and the fast extensor muscles.

50|$|To {{prevent the}} problem, a common {{recommendation}} {{is to keep}} the shoulder joint fully moving to prevent a frozen shoulder. Often a shoulder will hurt when it begins to freeze. Because pain discourages movement, further development of adhesions that restrict movement will occur unless the joint continues to move full range in all directions (adduction, abduction, <b>flexion,</b> rotation, <b>and</b> <b>extension).</b> Physical therapy <b>and</b> occupational therapy can help with continued movement.|$|R

2500|$|The lumbosacral joint, {{between the}} sacrum {{and the last}} lumbar vertebra, has, like all vertebal joints, an {{intervertebral}} disc, anterior and posterior ligaments, ligamenta flava, interspinous and supraspinous ligaments, and synovial joints between the articular processes of the two bones. [...] In addition to these ligaments the joint is strengthened by the iliolumbar and lateral lumbosacral ligaments. [...] The iliolumbar ligament passes between {{the tip of the}} transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra and the posterior part of the iliac crest. [...] The lateral lumbosacral ligament, partly continuous with the iliolumbar ligament, passes down from the lower border of the transverse process of the fifth vertebra to the ala of the sacrum. [...] The movements possible in the lumbosacral joint are <b>flexion</b> <b>and</b> <b>extension,</b> a small amount of lateral flexion (from 7 degrees in childhood to 1 degree in adults), but no axial rotation.
