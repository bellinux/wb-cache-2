The most prominent study for examining retirement behavior in the United States is the ongoing Health and Retirement Study (HRS), first fielded in 1992. The HRS is a nationally representative longitudinal survey of adults in the U.S. ages 51+, conducted every two years, and contains {{a wealth of information}} on such topics as labor force participation (e.g., current employment, job history, retirement plans, industry/occupation, pensions, disability), health (e.g., health status and history, health and life insurance, cognition), <b>financial</b> <b>variables</b> (e.g., assets and income, housing, net worth, wills, consumption and savings), family characteristics (e.g., family structure, transfers, parent/child/grandchild/sibling information) {{and a host of other}} topics (e.g., expectations, expenses, internet use, risk taking, psychosocial, time use).|$|E

2500|$|Financial {{economics}} is {{the branch of}} economics studying the interrelation of <b>financial</b> <b>variables,</b> such as prices, interest rates and shares, as opposed to goods and services. Financial economics concentrates on influences of real economic variables on financial ones, in contrast to pure finance. [...] It centres on managing risk {{in the context of}} the financial markets, and the resultant economic and financial models. [...] It essentially explores how rational investors would apply risk and return to the problem of an investment policy. [...] Here, the twin assumptions of rationality and market efficiency lead to modern portfolio theory (the CAPM), and to the Black–Scholes theory for option valuation; it further studies phenomena and models where these assumptions do not hold, or are extended. [...] "Financial economics", at least formally, also considers investment under [...] "certainty" [...] (Fisher separation theorem, [...] "theory of investment value", Modigliani–Miller theorem) and hence also contributes to corporate finance theory. Financial econometrics is the branch of financial economics that uses econometric techniques to parameterize the relationships suggested.|$|E

Referring to the purposive sampling method, the number of samples {{in this study was}} 49 firms from 1999 to 2003.

The test of non-financial variable influence on underpricing, significant variables were the auditor’s and underwriter’s reputations, and sort of industry. The firm’s age variable influence on underpricing was insignificant. It means that the non-financial variable influenced underpricing simultaneously.

This paper {{analyses}} {{the relationship}} between <b>financial</b> stress indicator <b>variables</b> and monetary policy in South Africa with emphasis on how robust these variables {{are related to the}} monetary policy interest rate. The <b>financial</b> stress indicator <b>variables</b> comprise a set of variables from the main segments of the South African financial market that include the bond and equity securities markets, the commodity market and the exchange rate market. The empirical results show that the set of <b>financial</b> stress indicator <b>variables</b> from the bond and equity securities markets as well as those from credit markets and property markets are robustly associated with the monetary policy interest rate, while the set of <b>financial</b> stress indicator <b>variables</b> from commodity markets and the exchange rate market are weakly associated with the monetary policy interest rate.

40|$|The recent {{turmoil in}} {{financial}} markets has reinforced {{the importance of}} leading economic indicators especially consumer confidence index. Moreover, the dynamic response of emerging financial markets in this volatile environment has sparked an interest in investigating the information content of <b>financial</b> market <b>variables.</b> The motivation {{of this study is}} to bring together these two strands of research. Hence, the main aim is to examine empirically the relationship between consumer confidence and <b>financial</b> market <b>variables</b> for an emerging economy, namely Turkey. In emerging markets where the future is uncertain rather than risky, consumer confidence should be modeled as an economic indicator which possesses information from past and current economic outlook rather than a forecasting indicator of future rates of consumption (and growth). Thus, consumer sentiment should have a close relationship with high frequency <b>financial</b> market <b>variables</b> such as interest rates, exchange rates and the stock exchange index. Using weekly data for the period of January 2003 – December 2007, this study empirically shows the existence of cointegration between consumer confidence and the <b>financial</b> market <b>variables</b> of interest. Therefore, in emerging markets consumer confidence should be viewed as an endogenous variable depending on information content of financial markets rather than just reflecting the sensitivity of consumers about the future of the economy...|$|R
