Unlike optical ray tracing where the medium between objects typically has a constant refractive index, signal ray tracing must deal with the complexities of a spatially varying refractive index, where changes in ionospheric electron densities influence the refractive index and hence, ray trajectories. Two sets of signals are broadcast at two different elevation angles. When the main signal penetrates into the ionosphere, the magnetic field splits the signal into two <b>component</b> <b>waves</b> which are separately ray traced through the ionosphere.

Applying corresponding nonlinear Pauli equation we include Fermi spin current contribution in the spin evolution. We find that the spectrum of <b>extraordinary</b> <b>waves</b> consists of three branches: {{two of them are}} well-known <b>extraordinary</b> <b>waves</b> and the third one is the spin-electron acoustic wave (SEAW). Earlier SEAWs have been considered in the electrostatic limit. Here we include the electromagnetic effects in their spectrum at the propagation perpendicular to the external magnetic field. We find that the SEAW spectrum considerably changes at the account of transverse part of electric field. We obtain that the separate spin evolution modifies spectrum of the well-known <b>extraordinary</b> <b>waves</b> either.

40|$|Near Vertical Incidence Skywave {{propagation}} {{can provide}} High Frequency (HF: 3 - 30 MHz) radio coverage {{in an area}} of 300 by 300 km without the need for any intermediate infrastructure. It is therefore very well suited for disaster relief communication. However, electromagnetic waves refracted in the ionosphere are prone to fading caused by multipath propagation and by polarization change in the ionosphere. Historically, different diversity reception systems have been devised to reduce this fading. By contrast, modern HF Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) techniques exploit the multipath aspects of the ionosphere to achieve an increased data throughput or a reduction of the required signal-to-noise ratio. The effectiveness of diversity reception and HF MIMO increases with decreasing correlation between the received signal streams. Electromagnetic waves propagating through the ionosphere consist of two characteristic <b>wave</b> <b>components</b> with circular polarization of opposite sense, the ordinary and <b>extraordinary</b> <b>waves,</b> each following a different path through the ionosphere. Adaptation of the polarization of the receive antennas to these characteristic waves provides two signal streams with high isolation.

Furthermore, based on the refractive index surface, the refractive indices and effective optical admittances of the forward and backward propagating <b>extraordinary</b> <b>waves</b> (p polarized wave) are analyzed in detail. With regard to the symmetry incidence, optical properties, such as the input optical admittance, transmittance and reflectance, are not identical for an <b>extraordinary</b> <b>wave</b> under common condition, i. e., angular selectivity. Based on an analysis of refractive index surface, the effective optical admittances of the forward and backward propagating <b>extraordinary</b> <b>waves</b> are equal in this particular case; transmittance and reflectance under the symmetry incidence are completely overlapped, similar to findings in the isotropic thin film. We validate our analysis using the developed software package.

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} retrieving individual <b>wave</b> <b>components</b> in a multi-directional sea wave model. To solve this problem, a currently and commonly used method is three-dimensional discrete Fourier transform (3 D DFT) {{on the radar}} image sequence. However, the uniform frequency and the uniform wavenumber in a wavenumber frequency domain can not always strictly satisfy the dispersion relation, and the spectral leakage in both temporal and spatial domains exists due to the limited analysis area selected from an image sequence. As a result, the DFT method incurs undesirable error performance in retrieving directional <b>wave</b> <b>components.</b> By deeply investigating the data structure of the multi-directional sea wave model, we obtain a new and decomposable matrix representation for processing the <b>wave</b> <b>components.</b> Then, a novel successive cancellation method is proposed to efficiently and effectively extract individual <b>wave</b> <b>components,</b> whose frequency and wavenumber rigorously satisfy the liner dispersion relation. Thus, it avoids spectral leakage in the spatial domain. The algorithm is evaluated by using linear synthetic wave image sequences. The validity of the proposed novel algorithm is verified by comparing the retrieved parameters of amplitude, phase, {{and direction of the}} individual <b>wave</b> <b>components</b> with the simulated parameters as well as those obtained by using the 3 D DFT method. In addition, the reconstructed sea field using the retrieved <b>wave</b> <b>components</b> is also compared with the simulated remote sensing images as well as those attained using the inverse 3 D DFT method. All the simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm is more effective and has better performance for retrieving individual <b>wave</b> <b>components</b> from the spatio-temporal remote sensing image sequences than the 3 D DFT method...|$|R
