40|$|Complex {{challenges}} face {{higher education}} today, including a public call to reform. Most change efforts within {{institutions of higher}} education occur at the department level, requiring academic <b>department</b> <b>chairs</b> to lead change. While <b>department</b> <b>chairs</b> {{have a significant impact on}} the future of higher education, their positions and roles are misunderstood, training and development processes for <b>department</b> <b>chairs</b> are inconsistent, and how <b>department</b> <b>chairs</b> learn to lead is unknown. The purpose of this study was to explore the informal and formal learning paths of academic <b>department</b> <b>chairs.</b> Of particular interest in this study were the learning methods of <b>department</b> <b>chairs</b> who reported engaging in behaviors associated with transformational leadership. The results of this correlational study were that leadership is affected by accumulated life experiences or incidental learning; informal learning more than formal learning contributes to transformational leadership; and learning from work experiences in the context of the work, rather than learning away from work, is the best mechanism for developing academic leaders in higher education today...|$|R

Initially, {{the leadership of}} the Department of Home Economics was split between Morgan (as the head of the household science division) and Mary Patterson (as the head of the household arts division). Morgan was not fond of sharing a department with Patterson, who had a background in decorative arts and no inclination toward science. By 1920, Berkley president David Prescott Barrows agreed to Morgan's request to separate the two divisions into distinct departments since they had different curricula, philosophies and faculty, and Morgan became the sole chair of the Department of Household Science.|$|E
40|$|The {{academic}} {{department is}} a fundamental unit for transforming the university's visions and goals into reality. In contrast, higher education undervalues administrative positions in general and <b>department</b> <b>chairs</b> in particular, believing that an administrative role is a temporary task. Little investigation has been conducted into effective leadership approaches in departmental leadership in higher education in general and in higher education in Saudi Arabia in particular. Therefore, the overarching {{purpose of this study}} was to identify effective leadership practices, characteristics and behaviors that contribute to the effectiveness of female academic <b>department</b> <b>chairs</b> and the challenges that they face. A qualitative approach informed with grounded theory techniques was used in this study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with former <b>department</b> <b>chairs,</b> current <b>department</b> <b>chairs</b> and faculty members. Vignettes were the basis of the faculty members' interviews to avoid any ethical concerns and to allay any fears of repercussion from their <b>department</b> <b>chairs.</b> The findings of the study indicate that effective chairs are distinguished by a combination of skills, knowledge, behaviors and attitudes. Although leadership in Saudi Arabia is based on a centralized system, the findings demonstrate the tendency toward more collaborative leadership that promotes collegiality and collective interest. Specific recommendations were made to better prepare <b>department</b> <b>chairs</b> for this crucial position in institutions of higher education. The study came at a time when the country is taking significant reforms in women’s issues...|$|R

Meiklejohn began to work on adult education in the University of Wisconsin Extension Division in July 1932, where some of the Experimental College's ideas took hold. He later moved to Berkeley.

30|$|First, {{our study}} into {{departmental}} leadership in VPE revealed an influence of organizational {{values and beliefs}} regarding departmental leadership on the role conception of <b>department</b> <b>chairs.</b> For instance, our findings revealed ambiguity amongst <b>department</b> <b>chairs</b> regarding their own role {{as a leader of}} quality teaching. This ambiguity seems to stem from a tension between values of academic freedom and collegiality {{on the one hand and}} the desire for leadership of teaching on the other hand. This tension came forward specifically in the two departments offering degree programs. Chairs and instructors across departments do not seem to agree whether the chair should be considered as supervisor of teachers (as in the K- 12 sector, characterized by formal supervisee observation and evaluation) or as first amongst equals (as in the university context, characterized by faculty autonomy and limited direct supervision by <b>department</b> <b>chairs).</b> The study of leadership for learning by <b>department</b> <b>chairs</b> thus needs to take into account the ways in which the chair position is organizationally and culturally situated.|$|R
