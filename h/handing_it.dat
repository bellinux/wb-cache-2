5|$|Historians {{of science}} {{differ in their}} views of the {{significance}} of the scientific accomplishments in the medieval Islamic world. The traditionalist view, exemplified by Bertrand Russell, holds that Islamic science, while admirable in many technical ways, lacked the intellectual energy required for innovation and was chiefly important for preserving ancient knowledge, and <b>handing</b> <b>it</b> on to medieval Europe. The revisionist view, exemplified by Abdus Salam, George Saliba and John M. Hobson holds that a Muslim scientific revolution occurred during the Middle Ages. Scholars such as Donald Routledge Hill and Ahmad Y Hassan argue that Islam was the driving force behind these scientific achievements.|$|E

When she asks the trolls if she can buy back the ring, the trolls become suspicious and discover the wanted poster of Snow, leading to a fight.

As she hands him back the items, including the wedding ring, Snow looks at the ring, then places it on her finger before <b>handing</b> <b>it</b> back to him as they go their separate ways.|$|E
5|$|Salo and Alesi {{became the}} first drivers to make {{scheduled}} pit stops on lap 16. Coulthard made a pit stop one lap later to remove the debris from his radiator and rejoined in sixth. Button became the race's fifth retirement because of an engine failure on lap 19. Michael Schumacher continued to set consecutive fastest laps, as he built an 8.8-second gap to Barrichello by his first pit stop on lap 24. Barrichello took over the lead for one lap before his pit stop on the following lap <b>handing</b> <b>it</b> back to Michael Schumacher.

5000|$|<b>Hand</b> <b>It</b> Over is {{the seventh}} studio album by {{alternative}} rock band Dinosaur Jr., released on March 25, 1997 on Reprise Records. It peaked at #188 in the United States. According to a 2007 Magnet magazine interview with band leader J Mascis, <b>Hand</b> <b>It</b> Over is his favorite album from the group's major label {{period of the}} 1990s. The band enjoyed a somewhat renewed appreciation from critics on <b>Hand</b> <b>It</b> Over. However, {{in the years following}} the band's hiatus, <b>Hand</b> <b>It</b> Over would become hard to find due to it not having the initial strong sales of Where You Been and Without a Sound which both sported moderate radio hits. <b>Hand</b> <b>it</b> over sold 34,000 units in US.|$|R

5|$|The {{weather had}} begun to deteriorate, and {{it was decided that}} the schuit was not strong enough to bring the {{remaining}} Malagasy ashore. One end of a rope was anchored to the shore, and at low tide volunteers from the Dutch group on shore swam out to Meermin, bringing {{the other end of the}} rope with them and <b>handing</b> <b>it</b> up to the crew on the ship. The crew then helped the remaining fifty-three Malagasy climb down to the Dutch volunteers, who helped them to shore, some carrying children on their backs. The Dutch built a fire to warm the Malagasy after their immersion in the water, and fed them; three wagons took them to Cape Town on 12March. Of the 140 or so Malagasy who had been shipped, 112 reached the Cape Colony as slaves.|$|E
5|$|The {{third round}} of green-flag pit stops {{commenced}} fifteen laps later when Bräck became the first driver to stop. Franchitti inherited the first position until he made his pit stop on lap 143, <b>handing</b> <b>it</b> to Manning. This meant Manning became the first driver to lead his début CART race twice. The fourth caution was necessitated on the 155th lap when Manning's right-hand rear wing endplate became detached and landed on the track {{between the first and}} second turns. Manning made a pit stop but his crew elected not to make repairs to his rear wing. It assisted in making his car develop less understeer and slightly improved its balance. Racing resumed on lap 163 with Bräck leading a single-file restart. The left side of Kanaan's car collided heavily with the wall on the backstraight six laps later, triggering the fifth (and final) caution. All drivers (including Bräck) made pit stops under caution. A crew member on Bräck's team dropped a left-rear wheel nut dropping him to ninth place. Fernández was observed speeding and was required to move to the rear of the field. Da Matta's team were slow to fit his right-rear tyre preventing him from taking the first position and he emerged in second place.|$|E
5|$|Brian and Stewie {{manage to}} sneak in {{backstage}} at the concert, where Miley asks why they're here. Brian then explains that Stewie has a 'tumor' shaped like a football, which convinces Miley to let them hang out with her backstage. Miley and Stewie quickly become best friends and they sing a song which Stewie wrote. Soon, Chris realizes that the Monkey has {{spent more time with}} him, like taking him to play baseball and going to a father and son BBQ in Monkeykid. Chris then says to Peter that he has never gave as much attention to him as the monkey has, so he grows to resent his own father. While having ice-cream with Miley, Stewie notices a signal interference on her cell phone when <b>handing</b> <b>it</b> to her. He then realises something is strange about Miley. Upon spying on her, Stewie and Brian discover that she is actually an android after seeing an employee insert a USB drive on the control panel on Miley's back. They both realized that Miley was created by Walt Disney Imagineering to become the perfect teen idol that can never fail. When Brian curiously asks if she can perform other tasks, Stewie agrees to reprogram Miley to have sex with Brian by gaining access to the control panel. However, it goes wrong and he accidentally sends Miley into a rage, forcing Stewie and Brian to run away from the monstrous Miley.|$|E

25|$|The album {{benefits}} from lavish investment in production, although this {{puts it in}} a similar position to The Sound's Heads and Hearts album {{in that it is}} much more polished than Borland's other solo material. Critical reception ranged from the noncomittal to welcoming; Allmusic described it as 'one hour of finely woven tapestry, of gorgeous music', albeit 'Not quite as good as 1989's Alexandria, <b>handing</b> <b>it</b> three stars out of five, while David Cavanagh gave it four, praising the atmosphere of 'a strange, dizzy optimism' pervading the album.

25|$|There is {{corruption}} {{within the}} distribution system: relief workers sell {{parts of the}} relief aid (cooking oil, wheat flour, and soap) {{on the black market}} instead of <b>handing</b> <b>it</b> out to refugees.

On the other hand there are many refugees without a ration card (card lost or refugee status not given or lost). Many cancelled refugees live in Kakuma and rely on rations of friends/family/ neighbours. Also some refugees have livestock that needs to be fed.|$|E
