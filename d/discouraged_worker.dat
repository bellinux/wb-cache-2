6000|$|The tramp {{is one of}} {{two kinds}} of men: he is either a <b>{{discouraged}}</b> <b>worker</b> or a discouraged criminal. Now a discouraged criminal, on investigation, proves to be a <b>discouraged</b> <b>worker,</b> or the descendant of discouraged workers; so that, in the last analysis, the tramp is a <b>discouraged</b> <b>worker.</b> Since there is not work for all, discouragement for some is unavoidable. How, then, does this process of discouragement operate? ...|$|E
60|$|These men, the <b>{{discouraged}}</b> <b>worker</b> and the discouraged criminal, voluntarily withdraw {{themselves from}} the struggle for work. Industry does not need them. There are no factories shut down through lack of labor, no projected railroads unbuilt for want of pick-and-shovel men. Women are still glad to toil for a dollar a week, and men and boys to clamor and fight for work at the factory gates. No one misses these discouraged men, and in going away they have made it somewhat easier for those that remain.|$|E
60|$|As I say, {{it is an}} extravagance {{for a man to}} patronise {{a casual}} ward. And that they know it {{themselves}} is shown by the way these men shun it till driven in by physical exhaustion. Then why do they do it? Not because they are discouraged workers. The very opposite is true; they are discouraged vagabonds. In the United States the tramp is almost invariably a <b>discouraged</b> <b>worker.</b> He finds tramping a softer mode of life than working. But this is not true in England. Here the powers that be do their utmost to discourage the tramp and vagabond, and he is, in all truth, a mightily discouraged creature. He knows that two shillings a day, which is only fifty cents, will buy him three fair meals, a bed at night, and leave him a couple of pennies for pocket money. He would rather work for those two shillings than for the charity of the casual ward; for he knows that he would not have to work so hard, and {{that he would not be}} so abominably treated. He does not do so, however, because there are more men to do work than there is work for men to do.|$|E

50|$|The Office for National Statistics publishes monthly {{estimates}} of the number of <b>discouraged</b> <b>workers</b> and the series runs from March to May 1993 when it was estimated there were 167,000 of them. In March to May 2013 it was estimated there were 63,000 <b>discouraged</b> <b>workers.</b> However because this estimate comes from a survey it may be that the number of <b>discouraged</b> <b>workers</b> is undercounted because people are embarrassed to state that they do not believe there are any jobs available for them.|$|R
5000|$|In economics, a <b>discouraged</b> <b>worker</b> is {{a person}} of legal {{employment}} age who is not actively seeking employment or who does not find employment after long-term unemployment. This is usually because an individual has given up looking or has had no success in finding a job, hence the term [...] "discouraged".|$|E
50|$|In the United States, a <b>discouraged</b> <b>worker</b> {{is defined}} as a person not in the labor force who wants and is {{available}} for a job and who has looked for work sometime in the past 12 months (or since the end of his or her last job if a job was held within the past 12 months), but who is not currently looking because of real or perceived poor employment prospects.|$|E
50|$|The {{information}} on the number and composition of the <b>discouraged</b> <b>worker</b> group in Canada originates from two main sources. One source is the monthly Labour Force Survey (LFS), which identifies persons who looked for work {{in the past six}} months but who have since stopped searching. The other source is the Survey of Job Opportunities (SJO), which is much closer in design to the approach used in many other countries. In this survey, all those expressing a desire for work and who are available for work are counted, irrespective of their past job search activity.|$|E
50|$|In Canada, <b>discouraged</b> <b>workers</b> {{are often}} {{referred}} to as hidden unemployed because of their behavioral pattern, and are often described as on the margins of the labour force. Since the numbers of <b>discouraged</b> <b>workers</b> and of unemployed generally move in the same direction during the business cycle and the seasons (both tend to rise in periods of loweconomic activity and vice versa), some economists have suggested that <b>discouraged</b> <b>workers</b> {{should be included in the}} unemployment numbers because of the close association.|$|R

5000|$|The Bureau of Labor Statistics {{does not}} count {{discouraged}} workers as unemployed but rather refers {{to them as}} only [...] "marginally attached to the labor force". This means that the officially measured unemployment captures so-called [...] "frictional unemployment" [...] and not much else. This has led some economists {{to believe that the}} actual unemployment rate in the United States is higher than what is officially reported while others suggest that discouraged workers voluntarily choose not to work. Nonetheless, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has published the <b>discouraged</b> <b>worker</b> rate in alternative measures of labor underutilization under U-4 since 1994 when the most recent redesign of the CPS was implemented.|$|E
50|$|A {{prolonged}} {{period of}} unemployment {{can lead to}} what economists call the <b>discouraged</b> <b>worker</b> effect, where workers {{drop out of the}} labor supply. The wives of discouraged workers do not behave as secondary workers, altering their labor supply in response to their spouses' transitory bouts with unemployment, but rather, these wives become breadwinners (Maloney, p. 183). Between 2007 and 2009, the United States saw a large increase in women's contribution to family income, resulting from a decrease in husband's earnings because three out of four eliminated jobs had belonged to men (Mattingly & Smith, p. 344). Working wives also worked more hours if their spouses stopped working (Mattingly & Smith, p. 355).|$|E
50|$|The United States Department of Labor {{first began}} {{tracking}} discouraged workers in 1967 and found 500,000 at the time. Today, In the United States, {{according to the}} U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics as of April 2009, there are 740,000 discouraged workers. There is an ongoing debate as to whether discouraged workers {{should be included in}} the official unemployment rate. Over time, it has been shown that a disproportionate number of young people, blacks, Hispanics, and men make up discouraged workers. Nonetheless, it is generally believed that the <b>discouraged</b> <b>worker</b> is underestimated because it does not include homeless people or those who have not looked for or held a job during the past twelve months and is often poorly tracked.|$|E
40|$|<b>Discouraged</b> <b>workers</b> {{are defined}} in many countries, {{including}} Canada, {{as people who}} want work and yet are not job-hunting because they believe suitable employment is not available. (1) Their belief may derive {{from a variety of}} factors, including a shortage of jobs in their locality or line of work; perceived discrimination for reasons such as age, race, sex and religion; a lack of necessary skills, training or experience; or a chronic illness or disability. "Discouraged workers " are part of a larger group said to be "on the margins " of the labour force- that is, people who, regardless of their reasons, are not looking for a job even though they want to work. (2) <b>Discouraged</b> <b>workers</b> are distinguished from others on the margins in that their reasons for not looking are fundamentally related to their perception that they would be unable to secure a suitable job. There are several inter-related reasons for the interest in <b>discouraged</b> <b>workers.</b> For example, these persons tend to enter the labour force in an economic recovery and withdraw in a recession. The label "hidden unemployed", often assigned to <b>discouraged</b> <b>workers,</b> probably traces its origins to this behavioural factor. As well, the numbers of <b>discouraged</b> <b>workers</b> and of unemployed generally move in the same direction during the business cycle and the seasons.

30|$|In Section 2, {{we present}} macro {{analysis}} of the <b>discouraged</b> <b>worker</b> effect and demonstrate cross-correlations between the cyclical components of the analysed variables and the selected macroeconomic indicators. Looking for asymmetry in the duration or size of the <b>discouraged</b> <b>worker</b> effect, we {{examine the relationship between}} the participation rate or the <b>discouraged</b> <b>worker</b> rate and the unemployment rate. In a microeconomic perspective (Section 3), we approximate the <b>discouraged</b> <b>worker</b> effect by the outflow from unemployment to inactivity and identify factors that entice older workers to withdraw from the job search. We focus on the roles of old-age benefits and the business cycle. In Section 4, we discuss the results, and in Section 5, we present our conclusions.|$|E
30|$|By {{looking at}} labour force participation, {{we wanted to}} {{identify}} factors that affected workers’ withdrawal from the labour market. We broadened the standard definition of the <b>discouraged</b> <b>worker</b> effect. We wanted to determine to what extent old-age benefits discouraged workers from active job search. We treated these benefits as an alternative source of income. They could be already paid out or shortly available to eligible workers. We focused on the outflow from unemployment to inactivity and approximated the <b>discouraged</b> <b>worker</b> effect by this outflow. Thus, we did not analyse pure <b>discouraged</b> <b>worker</b> effect. By discouraged workers, in turn, we meant those who had stopped seeking a job during the 1 -year interval.|$|E
30|$|By the <b>{{discouraged}}</b> <b>worker</b> rate we {{meant the}} ratio of the number of discouraged workers to the population.|$|E
50|$|As {{a general}} practice, <b>discouraged</b> <b>workers,</b> {{who are often}} {{classified}} as marginally attached to the labor force, {{on the margins of}} the labor force, or as part of hidden unemployment, are not considered part of the labor force, and are thus not counted in most official unemployment rates—which influences the appearance and interpretation of unemployment statistics. Although some countries offer alternative measures of unemployment rate, the existence of <b>discouraged</b> <b>workers</b> can be inferred from a low employment-to-population ratio.|$|R
5000|$|In Canada, while <b>discouraged</b> <b>workers</b> {{were once}} less educated than [...] "average workers", {{they now have}} better {{training}} and education but still tend to be concentrated in areas of high unemployment. <b>Discouraged</b> <b>workers</b> are not seeking a job for one of two reasons: labour market-related reasons (worker discouragement, waiting for recall to a former job or waiting for replies to earlier job search efforts) and personal and other reasons (illness or disability, personal or family responsibilities, going to school, and so on).|$|R

30|$|The results {{produced}} some interesting findings. In a macroeconomic perspective, {{it appears that}} the added worker effect prevailed over the <b>discouraged</b> <b>worker</b> effect. The <b>discouraged</b> <b>worker</b> effect arose with lag. When economic conditions worsened, workers at first increased their job search activity, most probably to compensate for the decrease in household income. As time elapsed, they became discouraged with the unsuccessful job search and left the labour market. This substantial delay can be partially explained by the inertia in the labour market {{and the fact that it}} takes time until a new equilibrium is reached.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} change in the {{adjustment}} mechanism of Japan's labor market before and after the collapse of bubble economy around early 1990 s. Comparison of Phillips curves among industrialized countries shows that Japan's Phillips curve has become much flatter in the 1990 s. The steeper Phillips curve before the 1990 s would be attributable to nominal wage flexibility reflecting flexible bonus payments or annual spring wage negotiations, slow employment adjustment, and the large <b>discouraged</b> <b>worker</b> effects. On the other hand, the flatter Phillips curve after 1990 s and onward would be attributable to the existence of downward nominal wage rigidity under the low and negative inflation rate as well as a decline in <b>discouraged</b> <b>worker</b> effects. Therefore, it is concluded that while slow employment adjustment mechanism did not change so much, fast wage adjustment mechanism deteriorated to some extent due to downward nominal wage rigidity in the 1990 s, and also flexible labor supply adjustment such as <b>discouraged</b> <b>worker</b> effects got smaller in the 1990 s. We also explore the reasons for a persistent rise in Japan's unemployment rate after collapse of bubble economy, emphasizing a lack of nominal shock absorption due to downward rigidity in nominal wages that created unemployment, slow employment adjustment mechanism that prevented the employment from recovering, and weak <b>discouraged</b> <b>worker</b> effects that kept unemployment rate high. ...|$|E

30|$|Apart {{from the}} {{asymmetry}} in {{the length of}} the adjustment process, we analysed the asymmetry {{in the size of the}} <b>discouraged</b> <b>worker</b> effect over the business cycle. We applied the solutions proposed by Darby et al. (1998) and O’Brien (2011). The first paper defined the dummy variable. It equals one from the period when the cyclical component of GDP reaches a peak until the trough and zero elsewhere. In our model, the dummy variable coefficient was not statistically significant. Thus, the impacts from the cyclical downturn and the economic recovery on the <b>discouraged</b> <b>worker</b> rate were comparable in size.|$|E
30|$|We {{primarily}} {{contribute to}} the literature by analysing {{the impact of the}} availability of old-age benefits on the participation of older workers. We check if these benefits tempt workers to exit from the labour force. These benefits may demotivate workers from further job search activity, causing low participation rates. Thus, we extend the definition of the <b>discouraged</b> <b>worker</b> effect and do not refer to pure cyclicality of the labour force participation. In macroeconomic perspective, we seek for the asymmetry in the size and duration of the effect. We find a time-varying <b>discouraged</b> <b>worker</b> effect. The added worker effect prevails at first. Then, the <b>discouraged</b> <b>worker</b> effect arises. It is asymmetric in intensity (stronger in recessions than expansions) and length (certain workers leave the workforce permanently). In a microeconomic perspective, females and older workers are more likely to quit the labour market. The availability of old-age benefits multiplies the probability of withdrawal from the labour market. We perceive our findings as an argument to increase the retirement age, which we understand as the age of the availability of the old-age benefits.|$|E
40|$|Abstract We {{test whether}} the <b>discouraged</b> <b>worker</b> or added worker effect {{prevails}} in the Polish labour market. The <b>discouraged</b> <b>worker</b> effect {{implies that the}} participation rate is procyclical {{with respect to the}} GDP and countercyclical with respect to the unemployment rate. The added worker effect yields contrary findings. We analyse the period 1994 – 2014 with quarterly data. We focus on the working age population, both males and females. We apply a range of methods to obtain robust results, some of which have never been employed to resolve this problem. They include ad hoc filtration, spectral analysis, unobserved component model, time-varying parameter model, and frequency domain regression. The results indicate that the added worker effect prevails in most of the business cycle frequencies. It is significant and varies over time. It is true for both males and females. It is considerably stronger in contractions than in expansions. In low business cycle frequencies, the <b>discouraged</b> <b>worker</b> effect prevails. Although the last case is rare, it proves the heterogeneity of labour force behaviour over the business cycle. ...|$|E
