5|$|Violence in Kentucky <b>increased</b> <b>with</b> the {{outbreak}} of the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783). Native Americans who were unhappy about the loss of Kentucky in treaties saw the war as a chance to drive out the colonists. Isolated settlers and hunters became the frequent target of attacks, convincing many to abandon Kentucky. By late spring of 1776, fewer than 200 colonists remained in Kentucky, primarily at the fortified settlements of Boonesborough, Harrodsburg, and Logan's Station.|$|E
30|$|Besides, the HTC ratio <b>increases</b> <b>with</b> <b>increasing</b> {{heat flux}} at all {{operating}} temperatures. This {{effect can be}} explained by the Brownian motion, and the thermophoresis effect [28]. The thermophoresis effect holds that nanoparticles can diffuse under the effect of a temperature gradient. The diffusion <b>increases</b> <b>with</b> <b>increasing</b> temperature gradient. In the boiling heat transfer, a great temperature gradient exists for the nanofluid near the heated surface. It <b>increases</b> <b>with</b> <b>increasing</b> heat flux and correspondingly increases the diffusion of nanoparticles, and hence the heat transfer is enhanced. Meanwhile, higher temperature leads to stronger Brownian motion, which also enhances the energy transportation. Therefore, the HTC enhancement <b>increases</b> <b>with</b> <b>increasing</b> heat flux.|$|R

In some cases the same spider bites a victim multiple times. Historically, victims were often bitten on the genitalia, though this phenomenon disappeared as outhouses were superseded by plumbed indoor toilets. Conversely, bites {{on the head and}} neck have <b>increased</b> <b>with</b> use of safety helmets and ear muffs. Precautions to avoid being bitten include wearing gloves and shoes while gardening, not leaving clothes on the floor, and shaking out gloves or shoes before putting them on. Also, children can be educated not to touch spiders.|$|E

5|$|During the {{afternoon}} hours of February10, 2009, a strong, {{middle and upper}} storm system moved across the Four Corners region into the central and southern Great Plains. A moist, low-level air mass streamed northward across Texas and Louisiana into eastern Oklahoma and the Ozarks ahead of the system. Daytime heating of the moistening boundary layer increased throughout {{the afternoon}} across Oklahoma and Texas as cloud cover shifted eastward. Cooling aloft, {{in conjunction with the}} approaching storm system, led to atmospheric instability, resulting in thunderstorms. A very strong wind field <b>increased</b> <b>with</b> height through the lower troposphere, resulting in a wind shear favorable for rotation in the thunderstorms.|$|E

5|$|Early {{stripline}} directly coupled resonator filters were end-coupled, but {{the length}} was reduced and the compactness successively <b>increased</b> <b>with</b> {{the introduction of}} parallel-coupled line filters, interdigital filters, and comb-line filters. Much of this work was published by the group at Stanford led by George Matthaei, and also including Leo Young mentioned above, in a landmark book which still today serves as a reference for circuit designers. The hairpin filter was first described in 1972. By the 1970s, most of the filter topologies in common use today had been described. More recent research has concentrated on new or variant mathematical classes of the filters, such as pseudo-elliptic, while still using the same basic topologies, or with alternative implementation technologies such as suspended stripline and finline.|$|E
5|$|Following the Confederate raid on Washington that {{resulted}} in the Battle of Fort Stevens, new assessments were made of weak spots in Washington's defenses. In the three years between the construction of Fort Stanton and the attack on Fort Stevens, Fort Stanton's perimeter had been greatly <b>increased</b> <b>with</b> the addition of two subsidiary forts and additional rifle pits and trenches, as well as the completion of the military ring road. A report by Maj. Gen. Christopher C. Augur of the U.S. Volunteers recommended Fort Stanton receive one 32-pounder howitzer, two 4½-inch rifled guns, four 12-pounder howitzers, and two 12-pounder Napoleons to bolster its defenses and control its position {{at the center of the}} Eastern Branch defenses.|$|E
