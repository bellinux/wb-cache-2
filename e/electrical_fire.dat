5|$|On 20 July 1913, {{while making}} an {{intermediate}} stop in Hoboken, New Jersey, Breslau was being warped into position when an <b>electrical</b> <b>fire</b> broke {{out at the}} pier where she was docking. Breslau made an emergency departure into the Hudson River, during which time the blaze was extinguished. The ship was not damaged {{and none of the}} 1,500 passengers aboard were injured in the incident. The ship left for Philadelphia on schedule the next day.|$|E
40|$|Arc faults {{can produce}} very high {{temperatures}} and can easily ignite combustible materials; thus, they represent {{one of the}} most important causes of <b>electrical</b> <b>fires.</b> The application of arc fault detection, as an emerging early fire detection technology, is required by the National Electrical Code to reduce the occurrence of <b>electrical</b> <b>fires.</b> However, the concealment, randomness and diversity of arc faults make them difficult to detect. To improve the accuracy of arc fault detection, a novel arc fault detector (AFD) is developed in this study. First, an experimental arc fault platform is built to study <b>electrical</b> <b>fires.</b> A high-frequency transducer and a current transducer are used to measure typical load signals of arc faults and normal states. After the common features of these signals are studied, high-frequency energy and current variations are extracted as an input eigenvector for use by an arc fault detection algorithm. Then, the detection algorithm based on a weighted least squares support vector machine is designed and successfully applied in a microprocessor. Finally, an AFD is developed. The test results show that the AFD can detect arc faults in a timely manner and interrupt the circuit power supply before <b>electrical</b> <b>fires</b> can occur. The AFD is not influenced by cross talk or transient processes, and the detection accuracy is very high. Hence, the AFD can be installed in low-voltage circuits to monitor circuit states in real-time to facilitate the early detection of <b>electrical</b> <b>fires...</b>|$|R
50|$|Arc faults {{are one of}} {{the leading}} causes for {{residential}} <b>electrical</b> <b>fires.</b> Each year in the United States, over 40,000 fires are attributed to home <b>electrical</b> wiring. These <b>fires</b> result in over 350 deaths and over 1,400 injuries each year.|$|R
40|$|Although <b>electrical</b> <b>fires</b> {{constitute}} the greatest {{percentage of the}} main causes of building fires, the critical evidence used by fire investigators to identify <b>electrical</b> <b>fires</b> is not always convincing to the general public. In this study, we scrutinized the microstructures of fire-causing copper wires and simulated the external environmental conditions required {{for the formation of}} fire-causing arc beads. Our metallographic investigation revealed that the primary thermal dendrites of copper at the fire-causing arc bead grew parallel to one another, but in the opposite direction to the heat flow. We determined the relationships of the undercooling (∆T 0), the growth velocity (ν), and the primary spacing (λ) of the dendrites with respect to the electrical wire’s diameter. Accordingly, fire investigators can now identify fire-causing arc beads in terms of these metallographic characteristics, thereby providing clear scientific evidence for litigant judgments of <b>electrical</b> <b>fires...</b>|$|R
5|$|She was {{transferred}} to the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron (BCS) in February 1915 although she was being repaired after an <b>electrical</b> <b>fire</b> at the time. Rear Admiral Horace Hood took command of the 3rd BCS on 27 May 1915. The 1st and 3rd BCS sortied in response to the German bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft on 24–25 April 1916, but failed to locate the German ships in heavy weather.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the earthquake, {{multiple}} phone lines were down, and scattered power outages affected about 54,000 households. Moreover, at least 70 underground 11,000 volt cables sustained some degree of damage, contributing to the outages. The shaking ruptured local water mains, resulting in widespread flooding that affected several streets. Furthermore, officials ordered the closure of bridges in the area as a precautionary measure; one bridge was reported to have succumbed to the strong ground motions. Days after its occurrence, a small <b>electrical</b> <b>fire</b> ignited in a control panel at Christchurch Hospital due to dislodged wiring as a result of ongoing aftershocks.|$|E
5|$|The plugs-out test {{began on}} the morning of January 27, 1967, and {{immediately}} was plagued with problems. First the crew noticed a strange odor in their spacesuits, which delayed the sealing of the hatch. Then, communications problems frustrated the astronauts and forced a hold in the simulated countdown. During this hold, an <b>electrical</b> <b>fire</b> began in the cabin, and spread quickly in the high pressure, 100% oxygen atmosphere. Pressure rose high enough from the fire that the cabin inner wall burst, allowing the fire to erupt onto the pad area and frustrating attempts to rescue the crew. The astronauts were asphyxiated before the hatch could be opened.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} Crunch Bandicoot {{was designed}} by Craig Whittle of Traveller's Tales and Sean Krankel of Universal. The concept of battling mini-bosses within the game's levels was dropped to uphold the fast and frantic pace of the series' gameplay. Multiplayer capability was also considered before being dropped. An earlier draft of the story featured an alternate version of the game's climax and ending, which involved Crash battling Crunch in a mechanical robot suit. At {{the end of the}} fight, Crunch would destroy Crash's suit with a bolt of electricity. The resulting debris would render Cortex unconscious, destroy the remote control device controlling Crunch and start an <b>electrical</b> <b>fire</b> in the space station. As the Bandicoots escape to resume their beach-going vacation, the ruins of the space station would crash-land onto the island of Cortex's original settlement, conveniently allowing Cortex and Uka Uka to resume their world domination bids.|$|E
5|$|Beacon Hill Station {{opened to}} the public on July 18, 2009 during a weekend of free service celebrating the inaugural day of Central Link service. The line's opening was delayed from its {{projected}} July 3 date due in part to slowdowns in Beacon Hill construction. The year after the line opened, nine air pockets above the tunnel, caused by soil slides above the tunnel boring machine, were discovered and filled with cement to prevent sinkholes. Service to the southbound platforms at Beacon Hill and Mount Baker were suspended for a daylong emergency drill in November 2010, briefly restricting service to the northbound platform while maintaining a 10-minute headway. During a winter storm in January 2012, an overnight train running to keep the overhead catenary free of ice stalled inside the Beacon Hill Tunnel, allowing for ice build up that canceled Link service for several hours. In late 2013, Beacon Hill Station was closed for two hours after the discovery of smoke in the tunnel, station, and nearby Mount Baker Station, coming from a homeless encampment {{on the west side of}} Beacon Hill. The incident prompted Sound Transit to hold meetings with the Seattle Fire Department on preventing a total system shut-down in the event of an <b>electrical</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|E

25|$|On November 9, 2010, Boeing 787, ZA002 made an {{emergency}} landing at Laredo International Airport, Texas, after smoke and flames were detected in the main cabin during a test flight. The <b>electrical</b> <b>fire</b> caused some systems to fail before landing. Following this incident, Boeing suspended flight testing on November 10, 2010, ground testing continued. After investigation, the in-flight fire was primarily attributed to foreign object debris (FOD) that was present in the electrical bay. After electrical system and software changes, the 787 resumed flight testing on December 23, 2010.|$|E

25|$|On October 10, 1984, in South Pasadena, California, a {{major fire}} broke out at an Ole's Home Center {{hardware}} store located in a shopping plaza. The store was completely destroyed by the fire, and four {{people died in the}} blaze, including a two-year-old child named Matthew and 17 year old employee Jimmy Cetina. On the following day, arson investigators from around southern California converged on the destroyed store, and declared the cause to be an <b>electrical</b> <b>fire.</b> However, John Orr, as an arson investigator, insisted that the cause was arson.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters (GFCIs), Arc-fault circuit interrupter devices (AFCI) are equally important as they offer added protection from potentially hazardous arc-faults resulting from damage in branch circuit wiring {{as well as}} extensions to branches such as appliances and cord sets. By detecting hazardous arc-faults and responding by interrupting power, AFCIs helps {{reduce the likelihood of}} the home's electrical system being an ignition source of a fire. Dual Function AFCI/GFCI devices offer both <b>electrical</b> <b>fire</b> prevention and shock prevention in one device making them a solution for many rooms in the home, especially when replacing an existing standard receptacle or existing ungrounded receptacle.|$|E
25|$|The {{only part}} of the railway {{property}} that remained Lowe's was the observatory on Echo Mountain. It boasted a 16-inch (406.4mm) reflective telescope from which many astronomical finds were made. It was blown down in a gale in 1928. The railway fell in stages to the Echo Mountain House fire, a kitchen fire on February 4, 1900; a wind-aided brush fire on Echo Mountain in 1905, which wiped out everything except the observatory and the astronomer's cabin; a Rubio Canyon flash flood in 1909 that destroyed the Pavilion; and an <b>electrical</b> <b>fire</b> that razed the Tavern in 1936.
