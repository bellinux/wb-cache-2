40|$|The ACP-EU {{agreements}} on bananas {{have been under}} threat from the World Trade Organisation, following pressure from the United States, and producers represented by three major multinational corporations and four Latin American countries (see Spore 74). Meeting in Brussels on 28 October 1998, the Agriculture ministers of the European Union decided {{to hold on to}} their commitments. The quota for ACP bananas entering the European market duty-free was upheld. This ended the system of quotas by country, and ratified the position taken at the <b>inter-parliamentary</b> <b>meeting</b> of ACP States in March 1998 in Mauritius and scheduled to enter into effect on 1 January 1999. There will be no specific quota for bananas from Cameroon or Côte d'Ivoire, but an overall quota for all ACP countries with a ceiling at about 860, 000 tonnes a year. This decision was met with delight by African producers, and with strong protests from the Caribbean producers, even though they had signed the Mauritius agreement. The ACP-EU Lomé Convention of 1990 runs out in February 2000, and if the existing benefits for ACP countries are not renewed, they could be frozen. In any case, negotiations for a new Convention have been started by the European Union. We have not heard the last of the banana case [...] .

The article details the creation of Community and shows the evolution of its activities over the past 20 years. The organization's management structure as well as its main bodies, including the Conference of Heads of State and Government, the Executive Secretariat, as well as regular <b>meetings</b> at ministerial, <b>inter-parliamentary</b> conference, <b>meeting</b> of representatives of the judicial authorities are described.
