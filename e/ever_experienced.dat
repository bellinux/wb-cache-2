5|$|It was {{the grandest}} sight I <b>ever</b> <b>experienced,</b> {{to look out}} of the {{lighthouse}} on a very stormy day, and see oneself hanging, as it were, over the ocean, surrounded on three sides by a fearful chasm in which the air was so thickly crowded with birds as to produce {{the appearance of a}} heavy snowstorm, whilst the cries of these myriads, mingled with the roar of the ocean and the howling of the tremendous gusts of wind coming up from below as if forced through a blast pipe, made it almost impossible to hear a person speak.|$|E
5|$|Its {{multiplayer}} {{features were}} praised; according to McCaffrey, the co-operative multiplayer mode had enough content {{for a separate}} game. Although he appreciated Spies vs. Mercs' faster pace, he found the mode less innovative than its predecessor. Reeves partially agreed, describing the revived Spies vs. Mercs mode as refreshing, intense, and bloody. De Matos wrote {{that it was one}} of the best multiplayer modes he had <b>ever</b> <b>experienced,</b> and the Blacklist version had evolved and modernized while remaining creative. Daniel Bloodworth of GameTrailers praised the game's satisfying co-op design, which tasks players to plan and coordinate strategy.|$|E
5|$|In 518, Scupi was {{destroyed}} by a violent earthquake, possibly the most devastating one Macedonia has <b>ever</b> <b>experienced.</b> At that time, the region was threatened by the Barbarian invasions, and the city inhabitants had already fled in forests and mountains before the disaster occurred. Scupi was eventually rebuilt by Justinian I. During his reign, many Byzantine towns were relocated on hills and other easily defendable places to face invasions. Scupi was thus transferred on another site: the promontory on which stands the fortress. However, Scupi was sacked by Slavs {{at the end of}} the 6th century and the city seems to have fallen under Slavic rule in 695. The Slavic tribe which settled in Scupi were probably the Berziti who had invaded the entire Vardar valley. The city is not mentioned during the three following centuries but along with the rest of Upper Vardar it became part of the expanding First Bulgarian Empire in the 830s.|$|E

He spent a month at Jefferson Barracks Military Post in Missouri and then five months at Southern Illinois Normal University in Carbondale, Illinois, for ground school training; McGovern later maintained that both the academic work and physical training were the toughest he <b>ever</b> <b>experienced.</b> He spent two months at a base in San Antonio, Texas, and then went to Hatbox Field in Muskogee, Oklahoma, for basic flying school, training in a single-engined PT‑19. McGovern married Eleanor Stegeberg on October 31, 1943 during a three-day leave (lonely and in love, the couple had decided to not wait any longer); his father presided over the ceremony at the small Methodist church in Woonsocket. After three months in Muskogee, McGovern went to Coffeyville Army Airfield in Kansas for a further three months of training on the BT‑13. Around April 1944, McGovern went on to advanced flying school at Pampa Army Airfield in Texas for twin-engine training on the AT‑17 and AT‑9. Throughout, Air Cadet McGovern showed skill as a pilot, with his exceptionally good depth perception aiding him. Eleanor McGovern followed him to these different duty stations, and was present when he received his wings and was commissioned a Second Lieutenant.|$|E

We {{explored the}} use of self-reported information provided by reproductive-aged women participating in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).

In addition to descriptive statistics, we used multinomial logistic regression to identify factors associated with <b>ever</b> <b>experiencing</b> infertility only, difficulty staying pregnant only, and neither infertility nor difficulty staying pregnant. We also explored the association between healthcare coverage and type of treatment received among women <b>ever</b> <b>experiencing</b> infertility only or difficulty staying pregnant only. ResultsCompared with women reporting having never experienced either infertility or difficulty staying pregnant, women who reported <b>ever</b> <b>experiencing</b> difficulty staying pregnant only {{were significantly more likely}} to report a history of depressive disorders and smoking (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1. 69, 95...|$|R

25|$|My sister's {{disposition}} was not naturally gregarious; circumstances favoured and fostered her {{tendency to}} seclusion; except {{to go to}} church or take a walk on the hills, she rarely crossed the threshold of home. Though her feeling for the people round was benevolent, intercourse with them she never sought; nor, with very few exceptions, <b>ever</b> <b>experienced.</b> And yet she knew them: knew their ways, their language, their family histories; she could hear of them with interest, and talk of them with detail, minute, graphic, and accurate; but WITH them, she rarely exchanged a word.|$|E
25|$|Biographers {{disagree}} {{on whether or}} not Burton <b>ever</b> <b>experienced</b> homosexual sex (he never directly acknowledges it in his writing). Allegations began in his army days when Charles James Napier requested that Burton go undercover to investigate a male brothel reputed to be frequented by British soldiers. It has been suggested that Burton's detailed report on the workings of the brothel may have led some to believe he had been a customer. There is no documentary evidence that such a report was written or submitted, nor that Napier ordered such research by Burton, and {{it has been argued that}} this is one of Burton's embellishments.|$|E
40|$|Applying a {{methodology}} similar to Feldstein and Altman (1998) to Slovenia's unemployment insurance (UI) system, the paper shows that unemployment insurance savings accounts (UISAs) are {{a viable alternative}} to a modest, but not generous, UI system. Under the modest regime, only one quarter of workers end their working life with a negative cumulative balance and 43 % <b>ever</b> <b>experience</b> a negative UISA balance; in contrast, under the generous regime, 49 % of workers end their working life with a negative cumulative balance and 66 % <b>ever</b> <b>experience</b> a negative balance. The simulations also show that the level of redistribution under UISAs lags behind the redistribution implied by the UI system. ...|$|R

It came in early 1876, when Chauncey Vibbard was scheduled to be sent to Albany for repainting prior to the opening of the regular season, allowing for a direct passage from New York uninterrupted by way-landings. Chauncey Vibbard accordingly departed New York at 5:20 am on April 18, bearing a party of excursionists who had been promised the fastest steamboat ride they had <b>ever</b> <b>experienced.</b> They were not to be disappointed; in spite of less than ideal conditions, Chauncey Vibbard arrived at her Albany pier at 11:40 am, setting a new record time of 6 hours 20 minutes, eclipsing her own previous record of 6 hours 42 minutes, set a dozen years earlier, by no less than 22 minutes.|$|E

40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{examined}} the effects of early life conditions on the timing of the onset of heart disease. We use the remarkable example of a representative sample of the population of older Puerto Ricans aged 60 – 74 who lived in the countryside during childhood (n = 1, 438) {{to examine the effects of}} seasonal exposures to poor nutrition and infectious diseases during late gestation on the timing of the onset and the probability of <b>ever</b> <b>experiencing</b> adult heart disease. Cox and log logistic hazard models controlling for childhood conditions (self-reported childhood health status and socioeconomic status [SES], rheumatic fever, and knee height) and adult risk factors (adult SES, obesity, smoking, exercise, and self-reported diabetes) showed that the risk of onset of heart disease was 65 % higher among those born during high-exposure periods compared with unexposed individuals. However, there were no significant differences in median time of onset for those <b>ever</b> <b>experiencing</b> heart disease. As a comparison, we found that there were no significant seasonality effects for those who lived in urban areas during childhood. We conclude that early exposures in utero have important ramifications for adult heart disease among the older Puerto Rican population. We show, however, that while exposure is associated with the probability of <b>ever</b> <b>experiencing</b> adult heart disease, it is not associated with the timing of onset among those who do experience it...|$|R
