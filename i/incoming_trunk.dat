25|$|The {{incoming}} {{section of}} the office, being fixed {{to the structure of}} the last four digits of the telephone number, had a limit of 10,000 phone numbers. In some of the urban areas where Panel was used, even a single square mile might have three or five times that many. Thus the incoming selectors of several separate switching entities shared floor space and staff, but required separate <b>incoming</b> <b>trunk</b> groups from distant offices. Sometimes an Office Select Tandem was used to distribute incoming traffic among the offices. This was a Panel office with no senders or other common control equipment; just one stage of selectors and accepting only the Office Brush and Office Group parameters. Panel Sender Tandems were also used when their greater capabilities were worth their additional cost.|$|E

50|$|A tandem {{version of}} the 1XB omitted the {{incoming}} section and Line Link Frames and replaced the junctor circuits with <b>incoming</b> <b>trunks,</b> leaving only the ability to connect those <b>incoming</b> <b>trunks</b> to outgoing trunks. In many cases the resulting Crossbar tandem switch (XBT) replaced a Panel Sender Tandem, because its multi-frequency senders were able to receive seven digits and some were modified to accept ten. Sometimes it replaced an Office Select Tandem as well, since its Revertive Pulse senders were able to accept Office Brush and Group parameters. In big cities, some XBT were strictly incoming Class 4 telephone switches, some outgoing, a few both-way, and some only for tandem traffic within the metropolitan area. Specialization was less marked in less dense areas. XBT served local telephone companies until the late 20th Century when they were replaced by 4ESS switches or other digital switches.|$|R
50|$|Centrex {{was invented}} in the mid 1960s by the Engineering Department of New York Telephone to replace the PBX switchboards of large customers. It was a feature package of the 5XB {{crossbar}} system. Much equipment had to be redesigned, including <b>incoming</b> <b>trunks</b> and markers. The redesigned equipment was so expensive that usually a separate 5XB switch was used just for Centrex customers, while POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service) customers were wired to an unmodified exchange.|$|R
50|$|The Audichron {{sales force}} found sponsors, such as banks, for its time and {{temperature}} machines in a city. Once a sponsor had been obtained, Audichron would lease the machines to the local phone company. An Audichron field service engineer would then visit the telephone company and help install the Audichron equipment in the central office. The phone company would then hook up <b>incoming</b> <b>trunks</b> to the Audichron equipment and would bill the final customer (e.g., the bank) each month for the trunks and the Audichron equipment. Audichron received payments from the telephone company.|$|R
50|$|In telecommunication, a spill-forward {{feature is}} a service feature, in the {{operation}} of an intermediate office, that, acting on <b>incoming</b> <b>trunk</b> service treatment indications, assumes routing control of the call from the originating office. This increases the chances of completion by offering the call to more trunk groups than are available in the originating office.|$|E
50|$|Ferrods were {{mounted in}} pairs, usually with {{different}} control windings, so one could supervise a switchward {{side of a}} trunk and the other the distant office. Components inside the trunk pack, including diodes, determined for example, whether it performed reverse battery signaling as an <b>incoming</b> <b>trunk,</b> or detected reverse battery from a distant trunk; i.e. was an outgoing trunk.|$|E
50|$|It {{was also}} less {{efficient}} for tandem calls, since the fabric {{is unable to}} connect a trunk directly to a trunk. Instead, each <b>incoming</b> <b>trunk</b> that {{has the ability to}} make tandem calls has to have a line link frame appearance, {{as if it were a}} line. To avoid expense, incoming trunks were divided into groups, some of them having tandem ability and some not. This complication was avoided in places big enough to pay for a separate tandem switch.|$|E
30|$|TELIC's {{objective}} is to automatically establish LSPs for <b>incoming</b> traffic <b>trunks</b> in MPLS aware Diffserv domain with constraint-based routing that achieves targets of TE for different traffic classes [4, 6].|$|R
50|$|Bell Labs {{took over}} Centrex {{development}} in the late 1960s. The NYTel version was designated Centrex I, and the Bell Labs revision Centrex II with additional features. The unreliable Step switches were replaced by a Centrex Position Link Circuit (CXPL), a small, dedicated two stage crossbar network. In the early 1970s Centrex III arrived, a complete redesign bringing more versatility to the old 5XB system. Rather than <b>incoming</b> <b>trunks</b> having appearances on the ordinary Line Link Frame for transfer purposes, Centrex III (or Phase 3 Centrex) had a separate four stage Transfer Network of six-wire crossbar switches to connect to a Transfer Trunk. CXPL continued in use for connecting to consoles. Among other changes, the Phase 3 consoles used DTMF rather than multifrequency pulsing. The Centrex product line was also extended down-market, with Centrex Small Business for customers having mere dozens of lines and no attendant console.|$|R
50|$|The {{switchboard}} {{is usually}} {{designed to accommodate}} the operator, who sits facing it. It has a high back panel, which consists of rows of female jacks, each jack designated and wired as a local extension of the switchboard (which serves an individual subscriber) or as an <b>incoming</b> or outgoing <b>trunk</b> line. The jack is also associated with a lamp.|$|R
50|$|The PBX had the {{important}} feature {{that someone who}} received a call in error could jiggle the switchhook, causing a light to flash to recall the operator to connect the caller to the desired extension. The feature was implemented in Centrex with a timing circuit to detect this hook flash {{and set up a}} three way connection among outside party, inside party and operator. For this purpose the <b>incoming</b> <b>trunk</b> also needed its own data storage in the form of reed relay packs to store the identity of the connected line.|$|E
50|$|At the {{terminating}} office, a Terminating Sender Link circuit connected a terminating sender to the trunk, {{in order}} to receive the phone number, typically using Revertive Pulse as in the panel switch to receive only the last four digits. Multi-frequency Terminating Senders were introduced in the 1950s as part of Direct Distance Dialing, and also used for incoming traffic from some local crossbar exchanges. The Terminating Sender activated an Incoming Marker, which then used a Number Group Circuit to find the line, marked an idle path, and operated the crossbar switches to use the links to connect the <b>incoming</b> <b>trunk</b> to the line.|$|E
50|$|As in {{previous}} designs, supervision of incoming calls is handled by relay sets known as <b>incoming</b> <b>trunk</b> circuits. Unlike {{in previous}} designs, {{this work is}} also done in the trunk circuit for outgoing calls, {{so there are no}} junctor circuits. Since different outgoing trunks are connected to different places and are used for different calls, their relay sets can be specialized for a particular kind of signalling or call metering (see automatic message accounting) or other peculiarity. Thus a TSPS trunk can give complete control to an operator, while an E and M signaling trunk can do the kind of signaling required of a private long-distance line, while a local outgoing trunk can be simpler.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1960s Batman series, {{commissioner}} Gordon {{was played}} by Neil Hamilton, and {{is portrayed as}} not only having the Bat-Signal at his disposal, but also a red emergency hotline telephone (known as the Bat-Phone) that connects directly to the Batcave, the Batmobile and (unbeknownst to Gordon) Bruce Wayne's study. Gordon's switchboard operators are twice shown {{to be able to}} <b>trunk</b> <b>incoming</b> lines into the Batphone circuit, enabling him to telephone Batman from remote locations (ironically once from Wayne Manor, and the other from a phone booth adjacent to that being used by Bruce Wayne). Batman and Robin are regular visitors to his office. The series occasionally made light of his dependence on Batman. In [...] "The Devil's Fingers", when Batman is apparently unavailable, Gordon and Police Chief O'Hara lament that they will have to solve a case by themselves; this contrasted the cold open of the pilot episode [...] "Hi Diddle Riddle", in which Gordon reluctantly decides to summon Batman only after O'Hara and all of his bureau chiefs gather and unanimously agree that the Riddler is beyond their abilities. This version of Gordon has at least two grown children, the elder of whom is unspecified but has given him at least two grandchildren, and the younger being Barbara (and, unbeknownst to her father, Batgirl). His wife is occasionally mentioned but never named.|$|R
50|$|Previous systems use relays in the <b>incoming</b> <b>trunk</b> circuit {{to control}} ringing and to return busy tone. 5XB uses a ringing {{selection}} switch (RSS): a crossbar switch with ten verticals, serving ten trunks. The various levels provide various tones, and ringing current of various durations and cadences (especially valuable for party lines). Levels 0 and 1 {{are used as}} discriminating levels to set polarity for selective ringing on tip side or ring side. An especially sensitive wire spring RT relay is used to detect off-hook from a line being rung, release the RSS hold magnet, and engage the shielded supervision relay so reverse battery answer supervision would {{be returned to the}} originating end.|$|E

5000|$|The {{operator}} or [...] "attendant" [...] had a {{large and}} complex attendant console, replacing the old, larger and even more complex switchboard and giving additional control of a connection. Its buttons and lights needed approximately fifty pairs of wires. Incoming calls arrived on an Attendant Trunk which, for customers {{with more than one}} console, waited for one to become idle and then connected to it, initially via Step by Step switches arranged as a Trunk Finder and Position Finder making up a small Automatic call distributor some years before that term was invented. Customers who preferred the old cord switchboards could use an adapted [...] "608" [...] board. In either case the console communicated with the <b>incoming</b> <b>trunk</b> with coded plus and minus 130 VDC signals on Tip, Ring or both wires.|$|E
50|$|On January 8, 1902 fifteen New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad commuters from New Rochelle {{were killed}} when a local New York Central Railroad train from White Plains missed a red light and rear-ended the train stopped in Park Avenue Tunnel. The {{accident}} was linked to exhaust smoke obstructing view of traffic signals. The resulting public outcry led to calls for electrification {{of the line and}} replacement of the then-overcrowded Grand Central Depot. In 1903 state legislators passed a law banning steam locomotives from Manhattan after June 30, 1908 and demanding electrification of New York Central Railroad (NYCRR). The company, which had already contemplated electrification, introduced electric traction on its Manhattan trunk lines in the end of 1906. The NYCRR mainline employed third rail electric supply because low clearance in the tunnels ruled out use of overhead lines. The trains changed electric locomotives for steam engines at Croton-Harmon and North White Plains. Other <b>incoming</b> <b>trunk</b> lines were largely electrified by 1923. The isolated Staten Island Railway, operated by Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, remained powered by outdated coal-fired 4-4-0 camelbacks and 2-4-4Ts hauling wooden cars.|$|E
50|$|Early {{crossbar}} exchanges {{were divided}} into an originating side and a terminating side, while the later and prominent Canadian and US SP1 switch and 5XB switch were not. When a user picked up the telephone handset, the resulting line loop operating the user's line relay caused the exchange to connect the user's telephone to an originating sender, which returned the user a dial tone. The sender then recorded the dialed digits and passed them to the originating marker, which selected an outgoing trunk and operated the various crossbar switch stages to connect the calling user to it. The originating marker then passed the trunk call completion requirements (type of pulsing, resistance of the trunk, etc.) and the called party's details to the sender and released. The sender then relayed this information to a terminating sender (which could be on either the same or a different exchange). This sender then used a terminating marker to connect the calling user, via the selected <b>incoming</b> <b>trunk,</b> to the called user, and caused the controlling relay set to pass intermittent ring voltage of about 90 V AC at 20 Hz to ring the called user's phone bell, and return ringing tone to the caller.|$|E
5000|$|The Incola was {{a luxurious}} hotel with an elegant dining hall, as {{described}} by an Okanagan resident in the 1920s: [...] "Dinner at the Incola hotel was a real treat...the dining room at the Incola was on a second storey level, so as {{to give you a}} lovely view of the lake, so you went up quite a broad flight of steps to reach the entrance in those days. The room was quite large and impeccably furnished with white linen-covered tables, high-back chairs, lovely shining silver and glassware, as well as imported English china...and of course there were the equally impeccable dressed men waiters...The food was delicious and served in a leisurely fashion. There were English meat pies,seafood, and of course, always 'Roast Beef with Yorkshire Pudding.' And for dessert there was a wide variety, especially of tarts and pastries usually wheeled in on a tea cart, from which you could 'choose your pick.' It was the 'upper-crust atmosphere' they managed to produce, however, which left you with the glorious feeling of 'being somebody' that was the highlight of the occasion, and was such a delightful contrast to the more rough and tumble atmosphere on the American side." [...] The hotel also had telephones starting from the early 1930s. Below is the account of worker in charge of installing them: [...] "In the early thirties the Incola Hotel management decided that telephones should be installed in each room to replace the old wooden push button buzzers used to summon a bus boy. When called, the bus boy had to climb from one to four floors to ascertain the guest's needs and repeat the trip with the necessary supplies. It did not make for fast service. When the order was given to the Okanagan Telephone Company to go ahead, Cliff Greyell, manager of the Penticton office ordered...one switchboard, 80 telephones, wire and fuse protectors for the <b>incoming</b> <b>trunk</b> lines. My job was to install the telephones in the rooms and different parts of the hotel. The job proved quite an experience for me, especially wiring some of the rooms while the guests were still in the rooms and didn't mind a bit about being interrupted." ...|$|E
40|$|Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) is a {{high-speed}} broadband Internet service that is {{best suited for}} residential use. In this paper, an analytically tractable information-theoretic model is proposed to determine optimal subchannel allocation in an ADSL system whose down-stream modem has wireline and/or wireless trunks at its input. The relevant (downstream) ADSL modem at the central office is assumed to receive packets from different types of trunks, such as optical lines, copper cables and/or wireless links, or their concatenated version. In information-theoretic point of view, this ADSL modem is modeled as a “demultiplexer ” {{in the sense that}} it selects out a specific set of bits and assigns it to an appropriate subchannel consistent with the Hartley-Shannon law specified SNR-level of the subchannels. The pertinent analyses pursued in evaluating a subchannel allocation metric (SAM) refer to the following: Hybrid CDMA/FDMA microcellular-fed fiber with a specified BER as the <b>incoming</b> <b>trunk</b> on an ADSL system and FEXT-infested copper lines customer loop access lines. The resultant performance of downs-stream ADSL traffic on subchannels is ascertained by the metric, SAM. Simulated results are presented and discussed...|$|E
