5000|$|The phrase [...] "hardworking families" [...] or [...] "working families" [...] is {{an example}} of a <b>glittering</b> <b>generality</b> in {{contemporary}} political discourse. It is used in the politics of the United Kingdom and of the United States, and was heavily used by the political parties in the campaign of the United Kingdom general election, 2005 and the Australian federal election, 2007 where the Rudd Labor Party used the term extensively.|$|R
50|$|A <b>glittering</b> <b>generality</b> (also called glowing generality) is {{an emotionally}} {{appealing}} phrase so {{closely associated with}} highly valued concepts and beliefs that it carries conviction without supporting information or reason. Such highly valued concepts attract general approval and acclaim. Their appeal is to emotions such as love of country and home, and desire for peace, freedom, glory, and honor. They ask for approval without examination of the reason. They are typically used by politicians and propagandists.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. This essay {{surveys the}} issues between Georgists and Roman Catholics in three classes: {{issues that are}} not peculiarly Roman Catholic (RC) but play out across faiths and denominations, issues that are peculiarly RC, and points of {{similarity}} and agreement. Addressed in this fashion are the tensions that arise between the social gospel and individual salvation, between specifics and <b>glittering</b> <b>generalities,</b> between noblesse oblige and governmental reform, between the doc-trine of original sin and tabula rasa, {{between the rich and}} the poor, between the dignity of labor and the honor of predation, between democracy and authority, between the regulatory emphasis rooted in the philosophy of Aquinas and free markets, and between plain talk and gobbledegook...|$|R
50|$|The {{basic premise}} {{underlying}} the Court’s ruling is its iteration, and constant reiteration, of {{the proposition that}} the First Amendment bars regulatory distinctions based on a speaker’s identity, including its “identity” as a corporation. While that <b>glittering</b> <b>generality</b> has rhetorical appeal, it is not a correct statement of the law. Nor does it tell us when a corporation may engage in electioneering that some of its shareholders oppose. It does not even resolve the specific question whether Citizens United may be required to finance some of its messages with the money in its PAC. The conceit that corporations must be treated identically to natural persons in the political sphere is not only inaccurate but also inadequate to justify the Court’s disposition of this case.|$|R

[...] "You {{understand}} the general lines on which I think the paper should be conducted?" [...] The sub-editor nodded. Mr. Wilberfloss made him tired. Sometimes he made him more tired than at other times. At the present moment he filled him with an aching weariness. The editor meant well, and was full of zeal, but he had a habit of covering and recovering the ground. He possessed the art of saying the same obvious thing {{in a number of different}} ways to a degree which is found usually only in politicians. If Mr. Wilberfloss had been a politician, he would have been one of those dealers in <b>glittering</b> <b>generalities</b> who used to be fashionable in American politics.|$|R
500|$|The Griffin family {{decides to}} take a {{vacation}} at Quagmire's cabin at Lake Quahog. When they go swimming in the lake, they discover that an oil refinery is dumping toxic waste into it; as they flee the lake their hair falls out, forcing them to wear powdered wigs until it grows back. Lois complains to Mayor Adam West, who admits that he sanctioned the dumping in exchange for free hair oil. Outraged, Lois decides to run against West in the upcoming mayoral election. Peter and his friends become strong supporters of Lois's campaign, realizing that they'd {{be able to get}} away with almost everything should she become mayor. But Lois's campaign soon falters as Mayor West proves more politically savvy. While Lois bores voters with detailed plans to improve the city, Mayor West uses <b>glittering</b> <b>generalities</b> and statements completely unrelated to the questions posed to him. Following Brian's advice to give short, simple answers, Lois resorts to similar tactics, dropping controversial terms such as [...] "Jesus" [...] and [...] "9/11" [...] in meaningless ways. She eventually gains the populace's support and wins the election.|$|R

And it is recognized as natural ideology of the Presidential candidates.

And for the appealing expressions, Park GeunHye focuses onlogical appealing and Moon Jae In focuses on emotional appealing. It leads to the interpretation that both of the candidate...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} study is to analyze the dominant propaganda strategies that were reflected in an hour-long program of Radio Martì, a broadcast produced on behalf of Voice of America in the United States and aired to Cuba. Through propaganda techniques, a content {{analysis was used to}} determine which strategies were present in the commentator 2 ̆ 7 s coverage of the program, El Dia de la Prensa Libre on May 3 rd, 2012. This study uncovered propaganda strategies, including testimonials, flag-waving, <b>glittering</b> <b>generalities,</b> appeal to prejudice, image manipulation, over-simplicity, assertion, and third party technique, that were utilized in an effort to present nuanced perspectives on the broadcasts transmitted on Radio Martì. The use of these strategies demonstrates that the program continues to use propaganda when broadcasting to Cuba after the conflict of interest incident with the United States and Radio Martì in 2006. Beyond the analysis of this broadcast, {{the results of this study}} cannot be generalized, but they can be viewed as an exemplar of the broadcast 2 ̆ 7 s stance on propaganda messages to Cuba on behalf of American journalists...|$|R

5000|$|Philosophers (and {{other users}} of logic) {{spend a lot}} of time and effort searching for and {{removing}} (or intentionally adding) ambiguity in arguments because it can lead to incorrect conclusions and can be used to deliberately conceal bad arguments. For example, a politician might say, [...] "I oppose taxes which hinder economic growth", an example of a <b>glittering</b> <b>generality.</b> Some will think he opposes taxes in general because they hinder economic growth. Others may think he opposes only those taxes that he believes will hinder economic growth. In writing, the sentence can be rewritten to reduce possible misinterpretation, either by adding a comma after [...] "taxes" [...] (to convey the first sense) or by changing [...] "which" [...] to [...] "that" [...] (to convey the second sense) or by rewriting it in other ways. The devious politician hopes that each constituent will interpret the statement in the most desirable way, and think the politician supports everyone's opinion. However, the opposite can also be true - an opponent can turn a positive statement into a bad one if the speaker uses ambiguity (intentionally or not). The logical fallacies of amphiboly and equivocation rely heavily on the use of ambiguous words and phrases.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>glittering</b> <b>generality</b> has two qualities- it is {{vague and}} it has {{positive}} connotations. Words and phrases such as [...] "common good", [...] "reform", [...] "courage", [...] "democracy", [...] "freedom", [...] "hope", [...] "patriotism", [...] "strength", are terms with which {{people all over the}} world have powerful associations, and they may have trouble disagreeing with them. However, these words are highly abstract and ambiguous, and meaningful differences exist regarding what they actually mean or should mean in the real world. George Orwell described such words at length in his essay [...] "Politics and the English Language" [...] The words democracy, socialism, freedom, patriotic, realistic, justice have each of them several different meanings which cannot be reconciled with one another. In the case of a word like democracy, not only is there no agreed definition, but the attempt to make one is resisted from all sides. It is almost universally felt that when we call a country democratic we are praising it: consequently the defenders of every kind of regime claim that it is a democracy, and fear that they might have to stop using that word if it were tied down to any one meaning. Words of this kind are often used in a consciously dishonest way. That is, the person who uses them has his own private definition, but allows his hearer to think he means something quite different. Statements like [...] "Marshal Pétain was a true patriot," [...] "The Soviet press is the freest in the world," [...] "The Catholic Church is opposed to persecution," [...] are almost always made with intent to deceive. Other words used in variable meanings, in most cases more or less dishonestly, are: class, totalitarian, liberal, reactionary, equality.|$|R

They are name-calling, <b>glittering</b> <b>generality,</b> transfer, plain folks, card-stacking and bandwagon. Testimonial employed by none of the characters because there is nothing or no one that is promoted. The most frequently used technique is name-calling because of the easiness of finding the ideas to compare the hearer’s appearance to something worse. Furthermore, when the characters employ warfare utterances, they use particular themes in each technique in order to achieve their goal. (2) In Glee Season 4 TV series, the characters employed either face saving act or face threatening act to respond to the warfare utterances. The responses given to the warfare utterances found can be divided into three types. They are verbal response, non-verbal response, and no-response. All three types of response are found in both face saving act and face threatening act. Face saving act is more desired than face threatening act. This happens because the characters want to shape public opinion and be recognized as kind, obedient, and avoid causing further problem...|$|R
