5000|$|Projectors share {{a common}} history with cameras in the camera obscura. Camera obscura (Latin for [...] "dark room") is the natural optical {{phenomenon}} that occurs when {{an image of a}} scene at {{the other side of a}} screen (or for instance a wall) is projected through a small hole in that screen to form an inverted image (left to right and upside down) on a surface opposite to the opening. The oldest known record of this principle is a description by Han Chinese philosopher Mozi (ca. 470 to ca. 391 BC). Mozi correctly asserted that the camera obscura image is inverted because light travels in straight lines from its source. In the 11th century Arab physicist Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) described experiments with light through a small opening in a darkened room and realized that a smaller <b>hole</b> <b>provided</b> a sharper image.|$|E
50|$|The term {{free point}} {{is used to}} {{describe}} the delineating point between the stuck pipe and the free pipe in a pipe string.

A good way to visualize this is to hold a piece of string with your left hand. With your right hand grab the bottom third of that string. The 2/3rds of the string above your right hand would be considered free, since you can move the string however you may like. The section of string inside and below your right hand is stuck, since no matter what you do to the free string it will not affect the string in or below your right hand.|$|E

50|$|The Insurrection {{essentially}} {{began at}} the Nietzschean-populated Hephaistos System, where a convenient rogue black <b>hole</b> <b>provided</b> the Nietzschean Alliance with a trap to lure High Guard ships into the system to be ambushed and destroyed by waiting ships. One-by-one, the Nietzscheans managed to pick off High Guard starships until they got {{the attention of the}} Andromeda and Dylan Hunt. The Andromedas captain realized it was a trap too late, {{and by the time the}} shock set in, the Andromeda was too far from a Slip-point to be able to escape the system alive. Dylan Hunt ordered his crew to abandon ship and, with his then pilot, the insectoid hermaphrodite Refractions of Dawn, sent the ship directly into the singularity, hoping for a slingshot effect to thrust the ship toward the nearest Slip-point. The Nietzscheans followed the grand prize into the black hole but also went for the escape pods, but many of the crew managed to escape and warn the High Guard. Because of sabotage by the Nietzschean XO, Gaheris Rhade, the Andromeda was unable to pull back and slingshot away and was frozen in time, teetering at the edge of the event horizon.|$|E

If they are also using a wired or wireless infrastructure network at the same time, they are providing a bridge to the secured organizational network through the unsecured Ad hoc connection. Bridging is in two forms. A direct bridge, which requires the user actually configure {{a bridge between the}} two connections and is thus unlikely to be initiated unless explicitly desired, and an indirect bridge which is the shared resources on the user computer. The indirect bridge may expose private data that is shared from the user's computer to LAN connections, such as shared folders or private Network Attached Storage, making no distinction between authenticated or private connections and unauthenticated Ad-Hoc networks. This presents no threats not already familiar to open/public or unsecured wifi access points, but firewall rules may be circumvented in the case of poorly configured operating systems or local settings.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new set of {{primitives}} to realize a large-area covering realistic tactile display. They stimulate the skin surface with suction pressure (SPS method) as our former paper proposed. The dif-ference from the former device is that a single suction <b>hole</b> <b>provides</b> a pair of primitives. Since the identical <b>hole</b> <b>provides</b> the multiple primitives, we can expect Multi-Primitive Tactile Stimulation is realized more stably, and the physical structure is simpler than the former method. The method uses the frequency charac-teristics of the mechanoreceptor sensitivity and a fea-ture of SPS that suction pressure through a hole does not reach the deep receptors, Pacinian corpuscles. We show the basic theory and results of fundamental ex-periments. In the experiments, we show the spatial feature of the virtual object (edged or round) can be controlled by the temporal profile of the primitives.

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of how long a journey within a black hole can last. Based on our observations, we make two conjectures. First, for {{observers}} that have entered a black hole from an asymptotic region, we conjecture that the length of their journey within is bounded by a multiple of the future asymptotic "size" of the black <b>hole,</b> <b>provided</b> the spacetime is globally hyperbolic and satisfies the dominant-energy and non-negative-pressures conditions. Second, for spacetimes with R^ 3 Cauchy surfaces (or an appropriate generalization thereof) and satisfying the dominant energy and non-negative-pressures conditions, we conjecture that the length of a journey anywhere within a black hole is again bounded, although here the bound requires a knowledge of the initial data for the gravitational field on a Cauchy surface. We prove these conjectures in the spherically symmetric case. We also prove that there is an upper bound on the lifetimes of observers lying "deep within" a black <b>hole,</b> <b>provided</b> the spacetime satisfies the timelike-convergence condition and possesses a maximal Cauchy surface. Further, we investigate whether one can increase the lifetime of an observer that has entered a black hole, e. g., by throwing additional matter into the hole. Lastly, in an appendix, we prove that the surface area A of the event horizon of a black hole in a spherically symmetric spacetime with ADM mass M_ADM is always bounded by A < 16 π M_ADM^ 2, provided that future null infinity is complete and the spacetime is globally hyperbolic and satisfies the dominant-energy condition.

40|$|Thermal {{stability}} of AlSiCu/W/n+p diodes with two different W contact structures prepared by selective W {{chemical vapour deposition}} (W-CVD), was first investigated. The diodes with the self-aligned W-contacted structure were able to sustain a 30 min furnace annealing up to 500 “C without degradation of electrical characteristics. The diodes with the contact-hole W-contacted structure were thermally less stable than the diodes with the self-aligned W-contacted structure, presumably because the sidewall of the W-filled contact <b>hole</b> <b>provided</b> a path for diffusion of Al into the Si substrate, leading to junction spiking.

40|$|We {{consider}} gedanken {{experiments to}} destroy an extremal or nearly extremal Kerr-Newman black hole by {{causing it to}} absorb matter with sufficient charge and/or angular momentum as compared with energy that it cannot remain a black hole. It was previously shown by one of us that such gedanken experiments cannot succeed for test particle matter entering an extremal Kerr-Newman black hole. We generalize this result here to arbitrary matter entering an extremal Kerr-Newman black <b>hole,</b> <b>provided</b> only that the non-electromagnetic contribution to the stress-energy tensor of the matter satisfies the null energy condition. We then analyze the gedanken experiments proposed by Hubeny and others to over-charge and/or over-spin an initially slightly non-extremal Kerr-Newman black hole. Analysis of such gedanken experiments requires that we calculate all effects on the final mass of the black hole that are second-order in the charge and angular momentum carried into the black hole, including all self-force effects. We obtain a general formula for the full second order correction to mass, δ^ 2 M, which allows us to prove that no gedanken experiments of the generalized Hubeny type can ever succeed in over-charging and/or over-spinning a Kerr-Newman black <b>hole,</b> <b>provided</b> only that the non-electromagnetic stress-energy tensor satisfies the null energy condition. Our analysis is based upon Lagrangian methods, and our formula for the second-order correction to mass is obtained by generalizing the canonical energy analysis of Hollands and Wald to the Einstein-Maxwell case. Remarkably, we obtain our formula for δ^ 2 M without having to explicitly compute self-force or finite size effects. Indeed, in an appendix, we show explicitly that our formula incorporates both the self-force and finite size effects for the special case of a charged body slowly lowered into an uncharged black hole.
