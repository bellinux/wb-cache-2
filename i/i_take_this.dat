5|$|Prior to his marriage, Cooper had {{a series}} of romantic {{relationships}} with leading actresses, beginning in 1927 with Clara Bow, who advanced his career by helping him get one of his first leading roles in Children of Divorce. Bow was also responsible for getting Cooper a role in Wings, which generated an enormous amount of fan mail for the young actor. In 1928, he had a relationship with another experienced actress, Evelyn Brent, whom he met while filming Beau Sabreur. In 1929, while filming The Wolf Song, Cooper began an intense affair with Lupe Vélez, which was the most important romance of his early life. During their two years together, Cooper also had brief affairs with Marlene Dietrich while filming Morocco in 1930 and with Carole Lombard while making <b>I</b> <b>Take</b> <b>This</b> Woman in 1931. During his year abroad in 1931–32, Cooper had an affair with the married Countess Dorothy di Frasso, while staying at her Villa Madama in Rome.|$|E

25|$|Rinehart wrote {{hundreds}} of short stories, poems, travelogues and articles. Many of her books and plays were adapted for movies, such as The Bat (1926), The Bat Whispers (1930), Miss Pinkerton (1932), and The Bat (1959 remake). In 1933 RCA Victor released The Bat {{as one of}} the earliest talking book recordings. Based on Rinehart's novel Lost Ecstasy (1927), <b>I</b> <b>Take</b> <b>This</b> Woman (1931), starring Carole Lombard and Gary Cooper, was an early sound film based on Rinehart's works.|$|E
25|$|My idea {{suggested}} to that gentleman {{was to write}} a story in which the principal character should be a miser, who had a daughter, and that the struggles of feeling between the love for his child and his love of money, should produce certain effects and results; and as all my ancestors were mixed up in the Rebellion of '45, I suggested that the story should be of that date, in order that I might introduce some scenes and circumstances connected with that great party struggle, and also wishing to let the public of the present day have a peep at the places of public amusement of the period, I took considerable pains to give correct views and descriptions of those places which are now copied and produced upon the stage; and <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> opportunity of complimenting my friend Halliday for the very excellent and effective manner in which he has dramatised the story.|$|E

500|$|MGM {{capitalized}} on Tracy's popularity, casting him in four movies for 1940. <b>I</b> <b>Take</b> <b>This</b> Woman with Hedy Lamarr {{was a critical}} and commercial failure, but the historical drama Northwest Passage—Tracy's first film in Technicolor—proved popular. He then portrayed Thomas Edison in Edison, the Man. Howard Barnes of the New York Herald Tribune was not charmed by the story, but wrote that Tracy, [...] "by sheer persuasion of his acting", made the film worthy. Boom Town was {{the third and final}} Gable-Tracy picture, also featuring Claudette Colbert and Hedy Lamarr, {{making it one of the}} most anticipated films of the year. The film opened to the biggest crowd since Gone With the Wind.|$|E

500|$|The {{marriage}} to Powell increased Lombard's fame, while {{she continued to}} please critics with her work in Up Pops the Devil and <b>I</b> <b>Take</b> <b>this</b> Woman (both 1931). In reviews for the latter film, which co-starred Gary Cooper, several critics predicted that Lombard was set to become a major star. She went on to appear in five films throughout 1932. No One Man and Sinners in the Sun were not successful, but Edward Buzzell's romantic picture Virtue was well received. After featuring in the drama No More Orchids, Lombard was cast as {{the wife of a}} con artist in No Man of Her Own. Her co-star for the picture was Clark Gable, who was rapidly becoming one of Hollywood's top stars. The film was a critical and commercial success, and Wes Gehring writes that it was [...] "arguably Lombard's finest film appearance" [...] to that point. It was the only picture that Gable and Lombard, future husband and wife, made together. There was no romantic interest at this time however, as she recounted to Garson Kanin: [...] " [...] did all kinds of hot love scenes... and I never got any kind of tremble out of him at all".|$|E

500|$|On October 24, 2012 a {{video was}} {{released}} showing Patrick B. Moran, the Congressman's {{son and a}} field director with his father's campaign, discussing a plan to cast fraudulent ballots proposed to him by someone who posed as a fervent supporter of the campaign. In response to the person's suggestion about trying to cast votes {{in the names of}} 100 inactive voters, Patrick Moran attempted to discourage the scheme, but also discussed the practical difficulties of forging documentation such as utility bills. [...] The person he was speaking with was actually a conservative activist with James O'Keefe's Project Veritas, and was secretly recording the conversation. Patrick Moran resigned from the campaign, saying he didn't want to be a distraction during the election, and stating, [...] "at no point have I, or will I ever endorse any sort of illegal or unethical behavior. At no point did <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> person seriously. He struck me as being unstable and joking, and for only that reason did I humor him. In hindsight, I should have immediately walked away, making it clear that there is no place in the electoral process for even the suggestion of illegal behavior, joking or not." ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the more}} {{important}} performances in Cooper's early career was his portrayal of a sullen legionnaire in Josef von Sternberg's 1930 film Morocco with Marlene Dietrich in her introduction to American audiences. During production, von Sternberg focused his energies on Dietrich and treated Cooper dismissively. Tensions came to a head after von Sternberg yelled directions at Cooper in German. The [...] actor approached the [...] director, physically picked him up by the collar and said, [...] "If you expect to work in this country you'd better get on to the language we use here." [...] Despite the tensions on the set, Cooper produced [...] "one of his best performances", according to Thornton Delehanty of the New York Evening Post. In 1931, after returning to the Western genre in Zane Grey's Fighting Caravans with French actress Lili Damita, Cooper appeared in the Dashiell Hammett crime film City Streets playing a westerner who gets involved with big-city gangsters in order to save the woman he loves. Cooper concluded the year with appearances in two unsuccessful films: <b>I</b> <b>Take</b> <b>This</b> Woman with Carole Lombard, and His Woman with Claudette Colbert. The demands and pressures of making ten films in two years left Cooper exhausted and in poor health, suffering from anemia and jaundice. He had lost [...] during that period, and felt lonely, isolated, and depressed by his sudden fame and wealth. In May 1931, Cooper left Hollywood and sailed to Algiers and then Italy, where he lived for the next year.|$|E

2500|$|More recently, BBC {{film critic}} Mark Kermode {{challenged}} the film's status, [...] "At {{the risk of}} being thrown out of the 'respectable film critics' circle, may <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>this</b> opportunity to declare officially that in my opinion The Deer Hunter {{is one of the worst}} films ever made, a rambling self indulgent, self aggrandizing barf-fest steeped in manipulatively racist emotion, and notable primarily for its farcically melodramatic tone which is pitched somewhere between shrieking hysteria and somnambulist sombreness." ...|$|E

Kelly ended up giving the song to her, which resulted in Monica thanking him [...] "from the bottom of [...] heart". The label then brought up the idea to her to put Brandy on the song, which was initially intended as a solo song.|$|E

2500|$|C: [...] "Under {{the south}} wall is {{the figure of}} a knight cross-legged with a loose vest over a suit of chain armour.

This effigy, in the sculptural style of the 13th century, with its legs broken off below the knees and missing the right arm, is now in Atherington Church, on the floor. It is suggested by Coulter (1993) to represent Sir William de Champernowne, father of Lady Joan Willington. Such figures with crossed legs are generally believed to represent crusaders.|$|E

[...] Regarding the different explanations afterward for what had happened, she said, [...] "In the wake of an attack like this, in the fog of war, there's always going to be confusion. And I think it is absolutely fair to say that everyone had the same intelligence. Everyone who spoke tried to give the information that they had. As time has gone on, that information has changed.
