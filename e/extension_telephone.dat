5000|$|An off-premises {{extension}} (OPX), sometimes {{also known as}} off-premises station (OPS), is an <b>extension</b> <b>telephone</b> at a location distant from its servicing private branch exchange (PBX).

5000|$|PBXs (Private Branch Exchanges) or PABXs (Private Automatic Branch Exchanges) are {{telephone}} {{systems that}} serve {{an organization that}} has many <b>telephone</b> <b>extensions</b> but fewer <b>telephone</b> lines (sometimes called [...] "trunks") that connect that organization {{to the rest of}} the global telecommunications network.|$|R
50|$|DSL signals may be {{degraded}} {{by older}} telephone lines, surge protectors, poorly designed microfilters, Repetitive Electrical Impulse Noise, and by long <b>telephone</b> <b>extension</b> cords. <b>Telephone</b> <b>extension</b> cords are typically made with small-gauge, multi-strand copper conductors {{which do not}} maintain a noise-reducing pair twist. Such cable is more susceptible to electromagnetic interference and has more attenuation than solid twisted-pair copper wires typically wired to telephone jacks. These effects are especially significant where the customer's phone line is more than 4 km from the DSLAM in the telephone exchange, which causes the signal levels to be lower relative to any local noise and attenuation. This will {{have the effect of}} reducing speeds or causing connection failures.|$|R
50|$|Each PBX-connected station, {{such as a}} {{telephone}} set, a fax machine, or a computer modem, {{is often referred to}} as an extension and has a designated <b>extension</b> <b>telephone</b> number that may or may not be mapped automatically to the numbering plan of the central office and the telephone number block allocated to the PBX.|$|E
5000|$|In {{residential}} telephony, an <b>extension</b> <b>telephone</b> is {{an additional}} telephone wired to the same telephone line as another. In middle 20th century telephone jargon, the first telephone on a line was a [...] "Main Station" [...] and subsequent ones [...] "Extensions". Such extension phones allow making or receiving calls in different rooms, for example in a home, but any incoming call would ring all extensions and any one extension being in use would cause the line to be busy for all users. Some telephones intended for use as extensions have built in intercom features; a key telephone system for a small business may offer two to five lines, lamps indicating lines already in use, the ability to place calls on 'hold' and an intercom {{on each of the}} multiple extensions.|$|E

50|$|A closed system, {{such as an}} {{intercom}} {{or private}} branch exchange, need not comply with standards for ringing {{if it does not}} use standards-compliant <b>telephone</b> <b>extensions.</b> Some office <b>telephones</b> replace the bells with separately-wired low-voltage DC buzzers or use entirely custom-designed extensions which only work with one manufacturer's switchboard. These avoid the need to generate 20Hz 90V sinusoidal AC, but are not compatible with standard telephone ringers.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Masters Diploma(Technology) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 1988 The project entails {{designing}} and installing an emergency fire telephone system (EFTS) for the 23 storey Cape Town Administrative Civic Centre. The original system, with its mostly analogue circuitry, has no documentation available, {{is difficult to}} maintain and has become unreliable. After considering alternative systems the most economical option was to expand the original system by adding more extension telephones and to redesign the control section. The new EFTS briefly operates as follows: The status of ninety six extension telephones, installed at the emergency exits on each floor, are displayed on a mimic status display which both operators can monitor. Any emergency call can be identified by a green flashing LED and a distinctive bleep. The LED indicates the exact position and number of the telephone in the building, Each operator has a keypad and a two digit numeric display fitted his telephone. The operator can immediately answer incoming calls by pressing the queue button. Calls queue on a {{first in first out}} basis. The number of the <b>extension</b> <b>telephone</b> will be displayed on a numeric display. The operator can also select the extension he wishes to contact, by dialling the extension number on the keypad. The EFTS consists of nine printed circuit boards. A rack mounted Microcomputer board, made up of a Motorola MC 6809 microprocessor, six 6821 PlAs, 2 kilobyte RAM, up to 16 kilobyte ROM and a watchdog timer controls the EFTS. Two Telephone Controller boards process voice signals and generate logic control signals for the CMOS voice switching circuitry on the Multiplexer Monitor boards. Six Multiplexer Monitor boards switch the two operators to any of the ninety six extension telephones and continuously monitor the <b>extension</b> <b>telephone</b> lines for faults and handset statuses. Noise and over voltage line protection is provided. The multiplexing of the 192 LEDs on the Mimic Status Display is controlled by the Microcomputer board. An unusual principle used in this design is the combination of low frequency AM and audio to affect communication. Two uninterruptable power supplies provide user independence from mains. Software used for the EFTS is written in 6809 Assembly Language. A Real time interrupt controls the Mimic Status Display. Operator actions are interfaced with the program logic by means of hardware interrupts...|$|E

50|$|During {{his tenure}} as Chief Engineer, large {{irrigation}} works were conceived, launched and executed. Nawab Saheb was responsible for construction of several buildings and bridges including major bridges over the Godavari and the Manjira River. <b>Extension</b> of <b>telephone</b> service to the districts was due to his initiative. He was responsible for large irrigation projects viz., Wyra, Paler, the Fateh Nahar, and bridges. One of his prize design projects was the Nizamsagar dam.|$|R
50|$|With {{the advent}} of competition, each {{individual}} carrier required its own prefixes in each rate center in each municipality, depleting available prefixes within high-growth and high-competition areas. (These were already under pressure due to increased use of direct inward dial PBX <b>extensions,</b> mobile <b>telephones,</b> pagers, fax machines and dial-up modems at the time). Many of these new prefixes were largely empty. This led to a rapid increase in {{the introduction of new}} area codes.|$|R

50|$|The {{demarcation}} point varies from building type and service level. In its simplest form, the {{demarcation point}} is a junction block where <b>telephone</b> <b>extensions</b> join to connect to the network. This junction block usually includes a lightning arrester (which requires a wire to ground). In multi-line installations such as businesses or apartment buildings, the demarcation point may be a punch down block. In most places this hardware existed before deregulation.|$|R

30|$|Speech {{recorded}} from a {{throat microphone}} is robust {{to the surrounding}} noise, but sounds unnatural unlike the speech recorded from a close-speaking microphone. This paper addresses the issue of improving the perceptual quality of the throat microphone speech by mapping the speech spectra from the throat microphone to the close-speaking microphone. A neural network model is used to capture the speaker-dependent functional relationship between the feature vectors (cepstral coefficients) of the two speech signals. A method is proposed to ensure {{the stability of the}} all-pole synthesis filter. Objective evaluations indicate the effectiveness of the proposed mapping scheme. The advantage of this method is that the model gives a smooth estimate of the spectra of the close-speaking microphone speech. No distortions are perceived in the reconstructed speech. This mapping technique is also used for bandwidth <b>extension</b> of <b>telephone</b> speech.|$|R
50|$|In 2010 a VPN {{client was}} added to the {{firmware}} as of release 0623C7F.

Other users in the global corporation can dial the user's extension and the phone will ring.|$|R
50|$|The {{hardware}} {{also has}} multiple legitimate applications. While a telephone exchange includes a central source of ringing voltage at the switchboard, a {{private branch exchange}} or telephone-based intercom must provide a local source of AC ringing voltage. Theatrical performances often deploy a ringing telephone on-stage as a stage prop. An analog telephone adapter for voice over IP applications has to provide its own ringing voltage generator and other line signaling services for standard <b>telephone</b> <b>extensions.</b> The hardware may also be useful to technicians for test purposes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Extension</b> of {{landline}} <b>telephones</b> {{to remote}} areas not previously served {{has been largely}} superseded {{by the use of}} mobile phones, primarily of GSM format, which now covers the entire region {{with the exception of a}} few sparsely populated mountainous areas and large national parks. Many people, even the poorest and frequently also children, have cellular telephones, although they have no fixed-line telephone. In this sense, Isan has led advanced nations where land-line service is now being superseded by cellular technology. The region also has the lowest literacy rate when compared with other regions in Thailand.|$|R
