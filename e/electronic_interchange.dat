UN/EDIFACT messages are used by almost all national customs administrations, all major seaports and a large range of companies (including over 100 000 in the retail sector), and throughout international supply chains.

[...] In 1975 Informatics had arranged with the National Wholesale Druggists’ Association to create a central clearinghouse for the processing of electronic purchase orders within the industry. [...] In 1978 that association formally endorsed the use of Ordernet, which led Informatics to create an Ordernet Services Division.

Many companies are using EDI nowadays to improve the exchange of information needed to support their business relations with other companies[1]. EDI is defined here as the <b>electronic</b> <b>interchange</b> of normalized and standardized data (messages) between the (automated) information systems of different companies [2].

Applying text-mining approaches to discover knowledge previously unknown patters retrieved from the web documents by using partitioned cluster analysis methods such as k- means methods using Euclidean distance measure algorithm for EDI text document datasets is unique area of research these days. Our experiments employ the standard K-means algorithm on EDI text documents dataset that most commonly used in <b>electronic</b> <b>interchange.</b> We also report some results using text mining clustering application solution called WEKA.

DTD's (or Schemas) definition associated with XML documents introduces data modelling in XML's world, allowing the specification of a hierarchy of concepts or elements that constitute the XML document. Taking into account that the purpose of these data models is the highly structured information exchange among several systems, it is required to incorporate security mechanisms that allow a secure interchange. The World Wide Web Consortium (W 3 C) is working in the recommendations of several XML security standards. Between them, we emphasize in the XML-Signature Syntax and Processing, which allows the insertion and information processing of authentication and digital signature. Once the XML security standards have been approved as recommendations, the following step will be to include them completely or just certain parts in future or new versions of the DTD's or existing Schemas, but at present many DTD’s exists that do not consider these security components within their definition. This is the case of the NewsML DTD, standard for the press news <b>electronic</b> <b>interchange.</b> The XML security standards are characterized by high flexibility and extensibility, because of that it is necessary to make an exhaustive study of the domain where it is intended to be applied and define...|$|E

Despite the concepts mentioned above, the system still deals with a number of disadvantages as: the amount of time that passes between placing the order and receiving the merchandise, the safety of the payments, the ability to test the product quality but most of all the lack of the public trust as for as personal data is concerned during the e-transactions. As a consequence, the enterprises have become more and more aware of these aspects, trying to acknowledge and reduce all these risks and therefore the consumers’ lack of trust assuring higher security standard transactions.

It has long {{been used by the}} major laboratories, but is now beginning to be used by headquarters staff to communicate with field offices and contractors and as the access point to DOE`s repositories of information. It will soon become key to efficient conduct of operations. Sites without effective access to the Internet will have to rely on secondary, less effective communications. Therefore, the task team believes it is essential that Hanford become a full participant in utilizing this resource. To make this happen an effective access and delivery infrastructure must be provided to DOE and contractor staff and standard ways of doing business on the Internet are required. Much of the technology exists today for robust <b>electronic</b> <b>interchange</b> of information. The use of this technology needs to be expanded and coordinated throughout the DOE and Hanford contractor community. As the use of Internet within DOE is advancing rapidly, it will become the preferred method for communication and information sharing within 5 years. The conclusion of the Internet Inter-Contractor task team is that the use of the Internet is essential to communicate as well as provide and obtain information and knowledge. The Hanford Site must foster, support, and implement necessary changes to the technology infrastructure to improve user access, maintain security, and assure we are effective participants in the networked community...|$|E
40|$|In diesem Beitrag wird gezeigt, welchen Einfluss Kultur auf die Gestaltung von Technik haben kann. Beispiel ist die Entwicklung so genannter <b>Electronic</b> <b>Interchange</b> Systeme (EDI-Systeme) in der koreanischen und deutschen Automobilindustrie. In Deutschland ist unter der Regie des Verbandes der Automobilindustrie ein gemeinsamer, industrieweit verwendeter Standard entwickelt worden. Dagegen haben die Automobilhersteller in Korea je eigene Standards entwickelt, alle Versuche Dritter, auch für die koreanische Automobilindustrie einen einheitlichen Standard zu definieren, sind gescheitert. Die in diesem Beitrag zur Diskussion gestellte These besagt, dass zwei tief in der koreanischen Kultur verankerte Werte, der geschlossene Kollektivismus und die hierarchische Autorität, für die Gestaltung von EDI in Korea verantwortlich sind.

The example presented is how key features of Korean culture, collectivism and hierarchical authoritarianism, affect {{the shaping of}} a large socio-technical system: electronic data interchange (EDI) system. This perspective casts new light an cultural research that, while generally confirming national culture - technology development ties at the organisation level, has had less success accounting for the shaping effects of culture at the interorganisational level. And there is especially missing international comparative research an this topic. The research that is building the empirical basis {{of this article was}} an the development of EDI systems in Korean and German automotive industry. The important finding presented here shows that closed collectivism and authoritarianism in Korea are responsible for the development of 'closed EDI systems' of the car producing Korean chaebols and the failure of developing an industry-wide EDI Standard.
