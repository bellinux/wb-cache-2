5|$|Anoplotherium is an extinct mammal {{from the}} Eocene to Oligocene epochs, <b>first</b> <b>found</b> near Paris. Hawkins's models draw on Owen's {{speculation}} about its camel-like appearance. (They are now {{thought to be}} related to hippopotamus and pigs). Three models were made, forming a small herd.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} named after the {{collector}} who <b>first</b> <b>found</b> it, Gilbert Hammond. He supplied natural history specimens to Oldfield Thomas and others.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{acquired}} conditions augment {{the risk of}} thrombosis. A prominent example is antiphospholipid syndrome, which is caused by antibodies against constituents of the cell membrane, particularly lupus anticoagulant (<b>first</b> <b>found</b> in people with the disease systemic lupus erythematosus but often detected in people without the disease), anti-cardiolipin antibodies, and anti-β2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies; it is therefore regarded as an autoimmune disease. In some cases antiphospholipid syndrome can cause arterial as well as venous thrombosis. It is also more strongly associated with miscarriage, and can cause {{a number of other}} symptoms (such as livedo reticularis of the skin and migraine).|$|E

5|$|A {{particularly}} {{large and}} rich region for detecting interstellar molecules is Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2). This giant molecular cloud lies {{near the center}} of the Milky Way galaxy and is a frequent target for new searches. About half of the molecules listed below were <b>first</b> <b>found</b> near Sgr B2, and nearly every other molecule has since been detected in this feature. A rich source of investigation for circumstellar molecules is the relatively nearby star CW Leonis (IRC +10216), where about 50 compounds have been identified.|$|E
5|$|Albertite, {{a type of}} asphalt, was <b>first</b> <b>found</b> in Albert County in 1849 by the Canadian {{geologist}} Abraham Gesner, {{inventor of}} kerosene. Over 200,000tonnes of the mineral were shipped to Boston within 30 years. Large deposits of gypsum found eight kilometres (five miles) from the mining site were shipped around the globe as well. The Petitcodiac River {{was used as the}} primary means for transporting the minerals at the time.|$|E

5|$|C.mutica {{populations in}} Europe were <b>first</b> <b>found</b> in the Netherlands in 1995. During a species inventory, several {{specimens}} {{of an unknown}} caprellid were recovered by Platvoet et al. from artificial structures {{in and around the}} Neeltje-Jans and the Eastern Scheldt storm surge barrier in Burghsluis, Zeeland. As with the case of the first discovery of C.mutica in North America, Platvoet et al. initially misidentified them as a new species. Remarking upon the resemblance of the caprellids to C.acanthogaster, they named it Caprella macho. They were later discovered to be introduced populations of C.mutica rather than a new species.|$|E
5|$|Coal {{balls in}} North America were <b>first</b> <b>found</b> in Iowa coal seams in 1894, {{although}} {{the connection to}} European coal balls was not made until Adolf Carl Noé (whose coal ball was found by Gilbert Cady) drew the parallel in 1922. Noé's work renewed interest in coal balls, and by the 1930s had drawn paleobotanists from Europe to the Illinois Basin in search of them.|$|E
5|$|Coal balls were <b>first</b> <b>found</b> in England, {{and later}} {{in other parts of}} the world, {{including}} Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, the former Czechoslovakia, Germany, Ukraine, China, and Spain. They were also encountered in North America, where they are geographically widespread compared to Europe; in the United States, coal balls have been found from Kansas to the Illinois Basin to the Appalachian region.|$|E

5|$|Commit This to Memory is {{the second}} studio album by American rock band Motion City Soundtrack. Produced by Mark Hoppus, the album was {{released}} on June 7, 2005, in the United States by Epitaph Records. Motion City Soundtrack, formed in 1997, had <b>first</b> <b>found</b> success with their debut album, I Am the Movie (2002). The band toured in the interim years, creating positive word-of-mouth. In 2004, the band joined Blink-182 {{on the road for}} a string of shows, which led to their bassist, Mark Hoppus, joining the band in the studio for his first producing effort.|$|E
5|$|Europium was <b>first</b> <b>found</b> in 1890 by Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, who {{obtained}} basic fractions from samarium-gadolinium concentrates {{which had}} spectral lines not {{accounted for by}} samarium or gadolinium. However, the discovery of europium is generally credited to French chemist Eugène-Anatole Demarçay, who suspected samples of the recently discovered element samarium were contaminated with an unknown element in 1896 and {{who was able to}} isolate it in 1901; he then named it europium.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of the}} 20th century, gay {{relationships}} were discouraged from being shown in comics which were seen mainly as directed towards children. Until 1989, the Comics Code Authority (CCA), which imposed de facto censorship on comics sold through news stands in the United States, forbade any suggestion of homosexuality. Artists had to drop subtle hints while not stating directly a character's orientation. Overt gay and lesbian themes were <b>first</b> <b>found</b> in underground and alternative titles which did not carry the CCA's seal of approval.|$|E

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1965, the first {{vascular}} plant was found growing on the northern shore of Surtsey, mosses became visible in 1967, and lichens were <b>first</b> <b>found</b> on the Surtsey lava in 1970. Plant colonisation on Surtsey has been closely studied, the vascular plants in particular {{as they have been}} of far greater significance than mosses, lichens and fungi in the development of vegetation.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{influenced}} by Elvis Presley, Gillan started and fronted several local bands in the mid-1960s, and eventually joined Episode Six when their original singer left. He <b>first</b> <b>found</b> widespread commercial success after joining Deep Purple in 1969. After an almost non-stop workload, {{during which time}} he recorded six albums in four years, and problematic relationships with other band members, particularly guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, Gillan resigned from the band in June 1973, having given a lengthy notice period to their managers.|$|E
5|$|Mascarene martins will mob the Mauritius kestrel, {{suggesting}} that it {{is perceived as a}} potential predator. Martins on Mauritius may be infected by an endemic trypanosome, Trypanosoma phedinae, although the pathogenicity is unknown. Protozoan blood parasites of the genus Haemoproteus have also been found in the martin on Mauritius, although no blood parasites were found in a Madagascan specimen. A new species of louse fly, Ornithomya cecropis, was <b>first</b> <b>found</b> on a martin in Madagascar, and another bird from that island carried the feather mite Mesalges hirsutus, more commonly found in parrots.|$|E

5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} moissanite {{is found}} in only minute quantities in certain types of meteorite and in corundum deposits and kimberlite. Virtually all the silicon carbide sold in the world, including moissanite jewels, is synthetic. Natural moissanite was <b>first</b> <b>found</b> in 1893 as a small component of the Canyon Diablo meteorite in Arizona by Dr. Ferdinand Henri Moissan, after whom the material was named in 1905. Moissan's discovery of naturally occurring SiC was initially disputed because his sample may have been contaminated by silicon carbide saw blades that were already on the market at that time.|$|E
5|$|The Phengaris rebeli (formerly Maculinea rebeli), {{common name}} {{mountain}} Alcon blue, is {{a species of}} butterfly in the Lycaenidae family. It was <b>first</b> <b>found</b> and described in Styria, Austria, on Mount Hochschwab around 1700. Although it was initially classified as a subspecies of P. alcon, a European researcher, Lucien A. Berger, designated it as a separate species in 1946.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} of erect limbs in mammals is incomplete — living and fossil monotremes have sprawling limbs. The parasagittal (nonsprawling) limb posture appeared {{sometime in the}} late Jurassic or early Cretaceous; it {{is found in the}} eutherian Eomaia and the metatherian Sinodelphys, both dated to 125 million years ago. Epipubic bones, a feature that strongly influenced the reproduction of most mammal clades, are <b>first</b> <b>found</b> in Tritylodontidae, suggesting that it is a synapomorphy between them and mammaliformes. They are omnipresent in non-placental mammaliformes, though Megazostrodon and Erythrotherium appear to have lacked them.|$|E
