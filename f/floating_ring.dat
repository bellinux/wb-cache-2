The pump is designed {{in such a way}} that the plungers are connected to a <b>floating</b> <b>ring.</b> This <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> can be moved horizontally by a control lever & thus causes an eccentricity in the centre of rotation of the plungers. The amount of eccentricity can be controlled to vary the discharge. The suction & discharge can be totally reversed seamlessly by shifting the eccentricity to the opposite side. Hence both quantity & direction can be varied in a radial piston pump, just as in the Swash plate pump.|$|E

The charging system also use non-rotating floating rings in turbochargers of internal combustion engines [4]. In some combinations of design and condition parameters of the rotor bearing system, the dimension of rotor and rings motion trajectory can essentially increase, though it is still limited [1 – 3]. To decrease journal and ring oscillation amplitudes and loadings affecting the bearing, the design with three lubricant films can be used.

40|$|<b>Floating</b> <b>ring</b> seal with bump foil(BFRS) was newly {{proposed}} and tested. BFRS {{which has a}} thickness of bump (0. 076, 0. 1 and 0. 12 mm) are separately tested for pressure-drops of 3. 0, 5. 0 and 7. 0 MPa and rotor-speed up to 24, 800 rpm. The measured data included leakage performance, attitude angle, lock-up eccentric ratio, and rotordynamic coefficients such as stiffness, damping and equivalent whirl frequency ratio to decide the whirling stability of seal were compared with <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> seal. When the thickness of bump <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> seals is increasing, leakage flow rate somewhat increases. Also, the lock-up eccentric ratio of the bump <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> seal with large thickness is {{lower than that of}} the <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> seal or small thickness of bump foil. The attitude angle increases linearly with the operating speeds in both cases. The direct damping coefficients increase significantly with the increments in bump-foil thickness and hydrostatic pressure-drop, but diminish with the rising rotor-speed. Especially, Coulomb friction damping force between the bump foil and housing surface contributes to the enhancement of direct damping coefficient value. Whirl frequency ratio of the <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> seal without bump shows somewhat small in low speed ranges. When bump foil thickness is 0. 074 mm or 0. 1 mm, WFR is insensitive in rotating speed and pressure. But BFRS(0. 12 mm) shows up more stable tendency according to decreasing whirl frequency ratio in high speed ranges. The design parameters determined from these test results will be used to enhance the stability in high pressure and high speed turbomachinery seals...|$|E
40|$|As one of {{the most}} common faults, rotor {{imbalance}} in a turbocharger will give rise to the bending vibration, which may cause damage to and even destroy the bearings and impellers. Therefore, it is necessary to detect rotor imbalance as early as possible. The present paper develops a mathematical model for investigating the rotor dynamic characteristics of a commercial automotive turbocharger supported on <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> bearings. In order to reveal the behaviours of oil film instabilities the model takes into account nonlinear hydrodynamic oil film forces instead of linearization. A two-dimensional elastic collision model is introduced to deal with the rub-impact process between such solid parts as journal, <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> and the bearing. In addition, the change of clearances in <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> bearing due to temperature increases are also estimated by ignoring the variation of lubricating oil viscosity. Following model development, a numerical simulation is implemented to study the bending vibration of the turbocharger and <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> bearing under the influence of rotor imbalance.

The device comprises a <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> installed between the journal and bearing housing of a fluid film bearing.

40|$|Abstract: Physical {{models and}} fast {{computational}} programs aim {{to improve the}} design and performance of turbocharger (TC) rotordynamics. Most commercial automotive TCs incorporate <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> bearings (FRBs) owing to their low cost and reduced power losses. However, persistent subsynchronous motions afflict this type of rotor/bearing system, albeit reaching limit cycles that enable their continuous operation. FRBs comprise two fluid films in series and are prone to show one or two subsynchronous instabilities over extended speed ranges of operation. A flow model for prediction of FRB forced response is detailed here. The model incorporates a lumped-parameter thermal energy balance for estimation of the lubricant viscosity and thermal growth of the rotor, bearing and <b>floating</b> <b>ring.</b> The FRB model, fully integrated into a non-linear rotordynamics computational program, predicts the <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> speed, journal and ring eccentricities, power loss and the rotordynamic force coefficients of {{the inner and outer}} films {{as a function of the}} load applied at a given rotor speed. Knowledge of the actual load conditions, static and dynamic, and the changes in operating clearance and effective lubricant viscosity are most important for accurate estimation of a TC dynamic forced response. Predictions for the exit lubricant temperature, power losses and <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> speeds agree well with measurements obtained in an automotive turbocharger test rig. The rotordynamic stability characteristics of the test TC are also highlighted...|$|E

A significant impact to the audible tonal noise spectrum {{results from the}} vibratory motions of fast-rotating turbocharger rotor systems in multiple hydrodynamic bearings such as <b>floating</b> bearing <b>rings.</b> Particularly, the study of self-excited non-linear vibrations of the rotor-bearing systems is crucial for the understanding, prevention or reduction of the noise and, consequently, for a sustainable engine acoustics development.

New <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> capsules were developed using different polymers and were compared for various parameters. The formulation with HPMC and sodium CMC has better floating properties. The effects of polymers concentration on drug release were studies by in vitro release studies. The interaction studies of combined drug with polymers were determined using FT-IR spectroscopy. The entrapped air within the gel barrier and lower densities of HPMC and sodium CMC resulted in better floating behavior. Steady slow gel formations showed prolonged drug release. The in vitro release rates were generally found to be faster with low concentration of carbopol showing release within 2 h, while formulations containing high amount of HPMC showed release in 8 h. In particular, the higher concentration of HPMC formulation shows the best drug release performance. A very low change in peak shift was observed only with sodium alginate formulations.

50|$|Fishing lights {{fall into}} two {{different}} groups: those that are portable {{and those that are}} permanently mounted. Generally, portable lights are powered by batteries and this sets practical limits to the kind of light that can be used. Most portable light sources are relatively low in light intensity and have short operating times. Lights drawing more than a few tens of watts are not practical. The old classic, a 12 volt automobile incandescent headlight mounted on a Styrofoam <b>float</b> <b>ring,</b> is probably the least expensive and lasts for a few hours before the battery is discharged. Battery-operated fluorescent lamps are three times more efficient in converting electricity to light. Therefore, comparing lamps of similar brightness, they can be operated about three times longer before the battery is discharged. Also, the operating lifetime of fluorescent lights are about ten times longer than incandescent lights. Commercial portable fishing lights based on fluorescent lamps vary widely in intensity. The best use 25-40 watt lamps that emit about 1000-3000 lumens per tube. Costing $160-$200, they are available through the internet, sport stores and catalogs. Lights made up of LED lights are an up-and-comer but to date are 10 to 100 times less bright than a fishing light using a standard 25-40 watt fluorescent lamp. LEDs are extremely efficient in converting electrical energy to light. As the cost of LEDs decrease and their brightness increases, expect to see functional fishing lights consisting of large arrays of LEDs.|$|R

The results are large bycatches of king crabs together with the crabs’ damages on the gear and catch. In the cod gillnet fisheries, the problem might be solved by using specially made gillnets (“norsel-mounted” nets) where the net itself is floated 0. 5 meters above the seabed. The norsel-mounted nets were compared with standard nets in the Varangerfjord (eastern Finnmark) in the period 17 March - 28 May 1999. The trials showed that norsel nets needed more floats than the standard nets to get the net to stand properly in the sea (to get the norsels stretched out suitably). By using extra <b>float</b> (<b>rings)</b> on the norsel mounted nets the bycatches of king crab were reduced to an acceptable level with an average of 0. 6 crabs/net, compared with 3. 3 crabs/net on standard and 6. 7 crabs/net on nor-se 1 nets without extra float. Norse 1 nets caught only about l/ 3 as many fish as standard nets. The catch results indicated that the gear configuration functioned in order to reduce the bycatch of red king crab.

Hydrodynamic thrust bearings must securely restrain unbalanced axial forces, arising during any possible operating modes. Using of the different types of intermediate elements provides a stable position of the rotor in the radial bearings. Recently flexible rotors have been widely used in small-sized turbo-machines.
