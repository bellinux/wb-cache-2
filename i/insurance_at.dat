25|$|Health {{insurance}} benefits are an attractive way for employers {{to increase the}} salary of employees as they are nontaxable. As a result, 65% of the non-elderly population and over 90% of the privately insured non-elderly population receives health <b>insurance</b> <b>at</b> the workplace.

25|$|Going {{home for}} rural {{healthcare}} in China is not ideal either. Over the past 30 years, {{that part of}} the health system has run down because government funding has fallen while everything else has become more expensive. Health facilities attempted to make up shortfalls by charging ever larger fees for diagnosis and treatment, especially for a difficult disease like tuberculosis. In China today, patients' payments keep the health services running and the medical staff have been encouraged to supply profitable health goods and services, especially drugs. Their own jobs depend on adequate operational funds, which are largely generated through user fees. Meanwhile, over the same 30 years, the socialist system of universal rural health-insurance collapsed and was not replaced apart from some pilot tests of an under-resourced community-based scheme in the 1990s. Until recently, virtually all rural residents, 900 million in all, had no health <b>insurance</b> <b>at</b> all. This situation will change if the current experiments with community-based health-insurance succeed and are then adopted nationally, but in the meantime as many as 10% of rural households have catastrophic medical payments (exceeding 40% of their disposable income) every year.|$|E

500|$|From 2017 onwards, {{states can}} apply for a [...] "waiver for state innovation" [...] {{that allows them to}} conduct {{experiments}} that meet certain criteria. To obtain a waiver, a state must pass legislation setting up an alternative health system that provides <b>insurance</b> <b>at</b> least as comprehensive and as affordable as ACA, covers at least as many residents and does not increase the federal deficit. These states can be exempt from some of ACA's central requirements, including the individual and employer mandates and the provision of an insurance exchange. The state would receive compensation equal to the aggregate amount of any federal subsidies and tax credits for which its residents and employers would have been eligible under ACA plan, if they cannot be paid under the state plan.|$|E

Many other aspiring Olympic athletes also trained at San Jose; the list included Millard Hampton, Andre Phillips, John Powell, Mac Wilkins, and Al Feuerbach.

500|$|As a candidate, Carter had {{proposed}} {{health care reform}} that included key features of Kennedy's national health insurance bill, but in December 1977, President Carter told Kennedy his bill must be changed to preserve a large role for private insurance companies, minimize federal spending (precluding payroll tax financing), and be phased-in so as to not interfere with Carter's paramount domestic policy objective—balancing the federal budget. Kennedy and labor compromised and made the requested changes, but broke with Carter in July 1978 when he would not commit to pursuing a single bill with a fixed schedule for phasing-in comprehensive coverage. Frustrated by Carter's budgetary concerns and political caution, in a December 1978 speech on national health <b>insurance</b> <b>at</b> the Democratic midterm convention, Kennedy said regarding liberal goals overall that [...] "sometimes a party must sail against the wind" [...] and in particular should provide health care as [...] "a basic right for all, not just an expensive privilege for the few." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Roger Feldman, Blue Cross Professor of Health <b>Insurance</b> <b>at</b> the University of Minnesota, one of {{the main}} reasons that medical fraud is such a {{prevalent}} practice is that nearly all of the parties involved find it favorable in some way. [...] Many physicians see it as necessary to provide quality care for their patients. [...] Many patients, although disapproving of the idea of fraud, are sometimes more willing to accept it when it affects their own medical care. [...] Program administrators are often lenient on the issue of insurance fraud, as they want to maximize the services of their providers.|$|E
