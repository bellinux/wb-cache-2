5000|$|There are few {{implements}} {{that give}} more general satisfaction in use or that are simpler in construction and operation than the <b>hay</b> <b>tedder.</b> Robert L. Ardrey, American Agricultural Implements The tedder came into {{use in the}} second half of the nineteenth century. While Charles Wendel claims in his Encyclopedia of American farm implements & antiques that the machine wasn't introduced to the United States until the 1880s, there are enough indications that the tedder was in use in the 1860s—The New York Times reports on its efficacy in 1868, and in that same year the Annual Report of the Commissioner of Agriculture in Maine comments on the American-made Hubbard's <b>hay</b> <b>tedder,</b> which had been on the market since 1863; according to the Maine report, in 1859 the machine was [...] "an implement lately imported from England." ...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>tedder</b> (also called <b>hay</b> <b>tedder)</b> is {{a machine}} used in haymaking. It is used after cutting and before windrowing, and uses moving forks to aerate or [...] "wuffle" [...] the hay and thus {{speed up the}} process of hay-making. The use of a <b>tedder</b> allows the <b>hay</b> to dry ("cure") better, which results in {{improved}} aroma and color.|$|R
5000|$|American machines, such {{as those}} made by Garfield, by Mudgett, and by Bullard (Ezekiel W. Bullard of Barre, Massachusetts, is {{credited}} in one source with {{the invention of the}} machine, nicknamed [...] "the grasshopper"), typically used a system with a revolving crank {{in the middle of the}} arm and a lever at the upper end, or a system whereby rotating wheels moved the forks up and down. The first tedder widely available on the American market was the already mentioned Bullard's <b>Hay</b> <b>Tedder,</b> which had forks moving up and down on a compound crank, working in a motion described as [...] "the energetic scratching of a hen." [...] The American <b>Hay</b> <b>Tedder,</b> made by the Ames Plow Company of Boston and described in 1869 as a [...] "new machine, remarkable for its simplicity and perfection of working, was more like the British machine in its rotational operation.|$|R
5000|$|In an early, simple <b>hay</b> <b>tedder</b> {{described}} in 1852 and manufactured in Edinburgh {{by the company}} of Mr. Slight, the two wheels, via a spur wheel and a pinion, drive a set of light wheels, the [...] "rake wheels"; on these two rake wheels are mounted eight rakes, which pick up and disperse the hay. A later [...] "English hay-tedder" [...] uses two separate cylinders with rotating forks that can be reversed to lay the hay down lightly for improved exposure to air.|$|R

50|$|That night, Brougham sabotages {{the next}} morning’s hunt by laying a drag with a fox in a sack over the fields. He {{especially}} marks a blind spot behind a high wall, and moves a large <b>hay</b> <b>tedder</b> behind, intending for Gethryn (who {{has been given}} the honour of leading the hunt) to be impaled upon its lethal tines. Unbeknownst to Brougham, his plan goes awry when a farmer repositions the tedder early the next morning. The hunt commences but comes to a halt at the specified spot. Gethryn reveals to the gathered crowd that he discovered and removed the hay-tedder booby trap earlier that morning and, {{with the help of}} the lead fox hound, will detect the scent of the culprit amongst a group of hunt saboteurs. Brougham, once again disguised, is identified and runs off, mounting Derek's horse. When Derek shouts a command to the horse, the animal stops short, throwing Brougham and impaling him on the very same machine he intended for Gethryn.|$|R

He also installed guards that prevented straw or grain from wrapping around the roller.Spangler invented a combined <b>hay</b> rake and <b>tedder</b> which was patented in 1893.
