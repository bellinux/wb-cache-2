40|$|A {{domino effect}} is a chain of {{accidents}} in which an accident in a unit propagates into nearby units, triggering secondary accidents and so on. Some examples are LPG <b>explosions</b> <b>in</b> Mexico in 1984, Buncefield fires and <b>explosions</b> <b>in</b> UK in 2005, and recently, the Caribbean Petroleum Refining tank <b>explosions</b> and fires <b>in</b> Puerto Rico in 2009. Due to their high impact low probability nature, domino effects have started to be recognized not only by risk and safety practitioners but also in technical standards and legislation concerned with the control of major accident hazards...|$|R

5|$|Flight 663 {{was unable}} to recover from its unusually steep bank and plunged into the icy water of the Atlantic Ocean, where it {{exploded}} with bright orange flames. The Pan American 707 {{was the first to}} relay news of the crash, as it was receiving permission to land.

5|$|News reports {{described}} the incident {{as the biggest}} {{of its kind in}} peacetime Europe and certainly the biggest such <b>explosion</b> <b>in</b> the United Kingdom since the 1974 Flixborough disaster. The flames had been extinguished by the afternoon of 13 December 2005. However, one storage tank re-ignited that evening, which the fire-fighters left to burn rather than attempting to extinguish it again.|$|E

5|$|A gas <b>explosion</b> <b>in</b> a {{residential}} area of Rosario, the third-largest city in Argentina, occurred on August 6, 2013. It {{was caused by}} a large gas leak; a nearby building collapsed, and others were at high risk of structural failure. Twenty-two people died, and sixty were injured. Several organizations helped secure the area, search for survivors and aid people who lost their homes. Shortly after the explosion, the time needed for reconstruction was estimated at six months.|$|E

Meanwhile, Clear is trapped inside her car with a leaking gas tank, surrounded by loose live wires. Alex arrives in time to save Clear and grabs the wire, allowing her {{to escape from the}} car seconds before it explodes, leaving Alex incapacitated.|$|E
5|$|Americium often enters {{landfills}} from discarded smoke detectors. The rules {{associated with}} the disposal of smoke detectors are relaxed in most jurisdictions. In 1994, 17-year-old David Hahn extracted the americium from about 100 smoke detectors {{in an attempt to}} build a breeder nuclear reactor. There have been a few cases of exposure to americium, the worst case being that of chemical operations technician Harold McCluskey, who at the age of 64 was exposed to 500 times the occupational standard for americium-241 {{as a result of an}} <b>explosion</b> <b>in</b> his lab.

5|$|Amy starts {{becoming}} more afflicted {{by the image}} of the Angel in her eye, and the Doctor instructs her to keep her eyes closed, preventing her from seeing it. Octavian has the clerics guard Amy while he, the Doctor, and River make for a secondary control room {{on the other side of}} the oxygen factory. During this, the Doctor learns that River is Octavian's prisoner, promised a full pardon if she helped capture the Angel. Octavian is killed by an Angel but this allows the Doctor and River to enter and secure the control room. They analyze the crack the Doctor saw and confirm that the leaking energy came from an <b>explosion</b> <b>in</b> time, and are able to narrow the date of the explosion's epicenter.|$|E
5|$|An early {{version of}} the modern {{self-help}} book, the 18th-century British conduct book drew on many literary traditions, such as advice manuals and religious narratives. There was an <b>explosion</b> <b>in</b> the number of conduct books published {{during the second half}} of the 18th century, and Wollstonecraft took advantage of this burgeoning market when she published Thoughts. However, the book was only moderately successful: it was favourably reviewed, but only by one journal and it was reprinted only once. Although it was excerpted in popular contemporary magazines, it was not republished until the rise of feminist literary criticism in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Armstrong {{served on}} two spaceflight {{accident}} investigations.

Armstrong opposed the report's recommendation to re-design the service module's oxygen tanks, {{the source of the}} <b>explosion.</b> <b>In</b> 1986, President Ronald Reagan appointed him to the Rogers Commission which investigated the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster of that year.
