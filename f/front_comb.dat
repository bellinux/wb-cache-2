One old hag was doing a younger woman's hair; I noticed that even for Spain it was beautiful, very thick, curling, and black as night. The girl held a carnation in her hand to put in <b>front</b> of the <b>comb</b> when the operation was completed. Another woman suckled a baby, and several tiny children were playing about happily, while their mothers chatted to one another, knitting.|$|R
25|$|The Caprice {{police car}} {{has had a}} {{positive}} reception, placing perfect scores in an assessment by The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, with the only criticism being directed at over-cautious electronic stability control. What also makes the Caprice PPV different from its Australian & Middle Eastern counterparts {{the lower end of}} the front bumper is based on the Commodore Omega Series II's <b>front</b> end, honey <b>comb</b> grille similar to the 2001-2011 Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor, and the interior is also from the Commodore Omega which is the common trim of VE Commodore to be used by law enforcement in Australia and New Zealand. The detective version uses the same interior that the Middle Eastern spec Caprice LS.|$|R
50|$|Flavian and Antonine hairstyles {{are perhaps}} the most famous, and extravagant, of Imperial Rome's styles. During this time the aristocratic women’s style became the most flamboyant. The styles were lofty, with masses of shaped curls and braids. The high arching crowns on the front were made using fillets of wool and toupees, and could be {{attached}} {{to the back of the}} head as well as the front. Typically, as in the case of the famous Fonseca Bust (pictured),this particular hairstyle appears to have been popular during the Flavian period. The hair was combed into two parts; the <b>front</b> section was <b>combed</b> forwards and built with curls, while the back was plaited and coiled into an elaborate bun. This fashion was described by the writer Juvenal as the hairstyles that made women appear tall from the front but quite the opposite from the back.|$|R
5000|$|The {{iconography}} {{carved in}} the <b>front</b> of the <b>comb</b> represents Christ in the center, surrounded by St. Peter on his left and St. Paul on his right. The iconography on the back represents the Virgin Mary crowning an Emperor, probably Leo VI, and assisted by the angel Gabriel. By this image of coronation, various experts have suggested the explicit willingness to show the divine approval of the imperial power on earth. Others {{have suggested that the}} ceremonial comb was made perhaps in order to celebrate the coronation of the Emperor Leo VI. However, due to the significance of the Psalms in the Byzantine liturgy of Pentecost, the three inscriptions bearing the Psalms 20 and 44 suggest that the comb was made perhaps for the celebration of Pentecost. The arches, niches, and windows carved on the ivory suggest a striking resemblance with the interior architecture of the east end of the Hagia Sophia cathedral.|$|R
6000|$|They had {{pictures}} {{hung on the}} walls--mainly Washingtons and Lafayettes, and battles, and Highland Marys, and {{one called}} [...] "Signing the Declaration." [...] There was some that they called crayons, {{which one of the}} daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only fifteen years old. They was different from any pictures I ever see before --blacker, mostly, than is common. One was a woman in a slim black dress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a cabbage {{in the middle of the}} sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with a black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and very wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive on a tombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her other hand hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule, and underneath the picture it said [...] "Shall I Never See Thee More Alas." [...] Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight to the top of her head, and knotted there in <b>front</b> of a <b>comb</b> like a chair-back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up, and underneath the picture it said [...] "I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas." [...] There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the moon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had an open letter in one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it, and she was mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth, and underneath the picture it said [...] "And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas." [...] These was all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn't somehow seem to take to them, because if ever I was down a little they always give me the fan-tods. Everybody was sorry she died, because she had laid out a lot more of these pictures to do, and a body could see by what she had done what they had lost. But I reckoned that with her disposition she was having a better time in the graveyard. She was at work on what they said was her greatest picture when she took sick, and every day and every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it done, but she never got the chance. It was a picture of a young woman in a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump off, with her hair all down her back, and looking up to the moon, with the tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded across her breast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two more reaching up towards the moon--and the idea was to see which pair would look best, and then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was saying, she died before she got her mind made up, and now they kept this picture over the head of the bed in her room, and every time her birthday come they hung flowers on it. Other times it was hid with a little curtain. The young woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face, but there was so many arms it made her look too spidery, seemed to me.|$|R
40|$|Activities of honeybees Apis mellifera L. colony are {{coordinated by}} an {{effective}} communication network {{in which the}} queen plays a central role by controlling behavior and reproduction of workers through pheromones. Most pheromones are produced in the mandibular (QMP) and tergal gland and distributed over the queen?s cuticle. The acquisition of these pheromones from the cuticular body surface of the queen is performed by antennating and licking of the retinue workers. Workers of a colony are able to recognize their own queen. Foreign queens which are introduced without protection are normally killed by the workers. While {{a lot of work}} has been performed on the primer and releaser effect of certain queen pheromones, it is still unknown how the workers distinguish their own queen from foreign ones. The fact that queens can be exchanged successfully by protecting the foreign queen for some days demonstrates that workers are able to ?learn? their queen. It is likely that a certain chemical pattern of the cuticle (odor or taste) is finally responsible for the recognition and acceptance as ?own?. In this context, this work has three different objectives: - To better understand the bees? behavior to ?own? and ?foreign? queens and to quantify certain behavioral traits of the queen-workers interaction. - To study the learning ability for own and foreign queens by the use of the Proboscis Extension Reflex (PER) {{in order to have a}} tool for future tests of odorous compounds. - To compare the cuticular pattern of queens of different origin. In all three approaches, virgin and mated queens and queens of different kin relation to each other were reared and established in Kirchhainer nuclei colonies. These queens were compared due to the following hypothesis: If the workers perceive their own queen by a distinct smell and if closely related queens have a more similar chemical pattern on the cuticle, then a related foreign queen should be easier ?learned?/ accepted than a non related one. For this purpose, first a specific bioassay had to be developed and established to enable the record of workers behavior to the queen without an inhibition of the complex social interactions between queens and workers. This ?cage bioassay? consists of a small wooden box with a glass <b>front,</b> a wax <b>comb,</b> 30 - 40 worker bees and a queen. For the tests, the own queen of this mini-colony was removed and a foreign queen was introduced. For a period of about 2 hours certain aggressive and benign actions, respectively, of the workers toward the queen were recorded. In the first set of tests, queens of different kin relations were compared. The results showed, in general, an aggressive reaction against the introduced foreign queens. However, there were clear lower benign and stronger aggression behaviors against unrelated queens compared to the related ones. Some of the unrelated queens were even killed. However, these differences were only significant when virgin queens were exchanged but not when mated queens were used. Concerning the duration of the aggressive action of workers, aggression generally decreased between the beginning and the end of the test; again, this was significant only in the experiments with virgin queens. This indicates, that at least in virgin queens the individual recognition by the worker bees depends on a kin specific odorous pattern of the queen. The same types of queens used in the cage bioassays were used for the learning experiments. A classical olfactory conditioning (PER) of worker honeybees was applied by using a living queen as the source of odor. Hereby the queen was offered in a way that the worker bees could not touch the body surface. The gradual increase in the learning curves was a good indication that the workers are able to learn the queen?s odor and, therefore, can be used as a kind of ?biosensor?. After having learned a queen?s odor, the conditioned workers were tested by offering virgin and mated queens, respectively, with defined kin relation to the queen used for the conditioning before. The results revealed clear differences in the cues used for the ?learning? of individual mated and individual virgin queens, respectively. The workers could significantly discriminate between the learned odor of a mated queen and any other mated queen irrespective of the relatedness. In contrast, worker bees could not discriminate virgin queens from each other. As the worker could only use volatile substances for the associative learning, one can conclude the following: In virgin queens the volatile ?bouquet? is neither individual specific nor kin specific. In mated queens the bouquet has only an individual specificity. Probably, the huge amount of many volatile gland products (including the main component 9 -ODA) makes each mated queen ?unique?. But as in the cage bioassays the worker could recognize whether an introduced virgin queen was related to the own queen or not, these recognition must depend on non volatile substances of the virgin queens cuticle which are perceived by licking. If learned and tested queens were of different mating status the worker bees could significantly discriminate between such individuals (except learned odor of mated queens/ tested odor of related virgin queens). This is not surprising because the GC-MS analysis confirmed the huge differences in the odorous pattern (and here mainly the volatile polar gland products) between virgin (= young) and mated (=elder) queens. From the same types of queens used for the cage bioassays and PER, queens? heads and abdomens were extracted in a solvent and the obtained extracts were analyzed using GC-MS. From the extracts of queen abdomens 32 substances (hydrocarbons and polar compounds) were identified and chosen to calculate the ?chemical distance? between queens of different kin relation (sister vs. unrelated) and between sister queens having different ages and mating status. For that purpose, a matrix of Nei-distances was applied as a measure for the similarity of different patterns. The results showed a significantly higher concordance in the chemical pattern within sister queens compared to non related ones. The ?chemical distance? increased from sister queens over half sister to non-related queens. Cluster analyses of the Nei distance and multidimensional scaling clearly confirmed the differentiation between unrelated queens and the similarity of sister queens. Using the same statistical methods, also a clear differentiation between queens of different ages and mating status could be demonstrated. The results presented in this work confirmed with 3 different approaches that workers are able to learn their own queen with different learning cues depending on the mating status of the queen. In virgin queens it could be demonstrated for the first time that the kin relation between different queens can be recognized, presumably by low or non-volatile substances. The chemical analyses confirmed that the cuticular pattern of queens could be used for the differentiation not only according to age but also according to kin. Das Sozialverhalten innerhalb eines Bienenvolkes (Apis mellifera L.) wird durch ein wirkungsvolles Kommunikationsnetzwerk koordiniert, in dem Königinnenpheromone eine zentrale Rolle bei der Kontrolle von Verhalten und Reproduktion der Arbeiterinnen spielen. Die meisten Pheromone werden in der Mandibel- und der Tergittaschendrüse gebildet. Die Perzeption dieser Pheromone durch die Arbeiterinnen erfolgt durch Betasten mit den Antennen und Lecken an der Kutikula der Königinnen. Die Arbeiterinnen eines Volkes sind in der Lage ihre eigene Königin zu erkennen. Ungeschützt ins Bienenvolk eingebrachte fremde Königinnen werden normalerweise von den Arbeiterinnen getötet. Es gibt zahlreiche Untersuchungen zu Primer- und Releaser-Effekten von bestimmten Bestandteilen des Königinnenpheromons. Nach wie vor ist aber nicht bekannt, wie die Arbeiterinnen zwischen ihrer eigenen und fremden Königinnen unterscheiden. Die Tatsache, dass Königinnen erfolgreich ausgetauscht werden können, nachdem man sie einige Tage lang durch einen Käfig geschützt hat, zeigt, dass die Arbeiterinnen in der Lage sind, den Geruch der Königin zu lernen. Vermutlich ist ein bestimmtes chemisches Muster der Kutikula (Duft oder Geschmack) für die Erkennung und Akzeptanz als ?eigen? verantwortlich. Diese Arbeit hat daher drei verschiedene Zielsetzungen: - das Verhalten von Bienen gegenüber eigenen und fremden Königinnen besser zu verstehen und bestimmte Verhaltensmerkmale der Interaktion zwischen Königin und Arbeiterinnen in einem Biotest zu quantifizieren - mit Hilfe des Rüssel-Reflexes (PER) zu prüfen, ob fremde und eigene Königinnen anhand von Duftstoffen ?erlernt? werden können - die Zusammensetzung der Kutikuladuftstoffe von Königinnen unterschiedlicher Verwandtschaft und Paarungsstatus zu untersuchen Für alle drei Ansätze wurden unbegattete und begattete Königinnen mit unterschiedlichen Verwandtschaftsverhältnissen zueinander aufgezogen und in Kirchhainer Begattungskästchen gehalten. Der Arbeit lag die folgende Hypothese zu Grunde: Wenn Arbeiterinnen ihre Königin anhand eines eindeutigen Dufts wahrnehmen und verwandte Königinnen ein ähnlicheres chemisches Muster besitzen, sollte der Duft einer verwandten Königinnen leichter gelernt oder akzeptiert werden, als der einer nicht verwandten Königin. Zunächst war es notwendig, einen speziellen Biotest zu entwickeln und zu etablieren, der eine quantitative Erfassung des Verhaltens der Arbeiterinnen gegenüber der Königin erlaubt, ohne die sozialen Interaktionen zwischen Königinnen und Arbeiterinnen zu stören. Dieser ?Käfig-Biotest? besteht aus einer kleinen Holzkiste mit einer Glasscheibe, einer Wabe mit 30 - 40 Arbeiterinnen und einer Königin. Für die Versuche wurde die eigene Königin dieses Mini-Volkes entfernt und stattdessen eine fremde Königin eingesetzt. Für einen Zeitraum von 2 Stunden wurden dann bestimmte aggressive und|$|R
