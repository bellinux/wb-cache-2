25|$|Whether a {{claimant}} {{can seek}} damages {{depends on whether}} the misrepresentation was innocent, negligent or fraudulent. The damages available will reflect losses, not a person's expectations, unless the misrepresentation was a promise incorporated as a term into the contract. Provided no double recovery results <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>possible</b> to rescind and claim damages (again, though, not expectation damages as if the contract were still in existence). There are four categories of damages claim, which are a combination of common law and the Misrepresentation Act 1967.|$|E
25|$|A {{radiation}} level of 10 sieverts per hour is read at a ventilation shaft between reactors 1 and 2. The area is subsequently sealed. The reading of 10 Sv is the maximum for many Geiger counters, including those used for these readings. One official states that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>possible</b> that the radiation readings were higher since the counter was reading its maximum. Radiation has been impeding attempts to replace cooling systems. These {{are the highest}} readings logged indoors since the initial March 2011 explosions.|$|E
25|$|APCI {{generally}} suffers less ion suppression than ESI, {{as discussed}} previously. Where possible, if ion suppression is unavoidable {{it may be}} advisable to switch from ESI to APCI. If this is not possible, {{it may be useful}} to switch the ESI ionisation mode from positive to negative. Since less compounds are ionisable in negative ionisation mode, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>possible</b> that the ion suppressing species may be removed from the analysis. However, it should also be considered that the analyte of interest may not be ionised effectively in negative mode either, rendering this approach useless.|$|E

25|$|It is not {{required}} to move through every rank below to achieve a higher rank. For example, many officers promote directly to sergeant without ever being senior officers. Also, many assistant chiefs are promoted directly from the rank of lieutenant. Councilman C.O. Bradford was promoted to assistant chief from the rank of sergeant. Jack Heard was promoted to chief from the rank of sergeant. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>possible</b> to become chief as an outsider such {{as in the case of}} Lee Brown, who went on to become mayor, and Harold Hurtt.|$|E

Although the Americans had crossed the bridge successfully, their toehold on the eastern bank was tenuous. The Germans still maintained control of the heights overlooking the bridge and the area around the slim bridgehead. If the Germans had been able to organize a coordinated, concentrated counterattack within the first 48 hours, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>possible</b> they could have pushed the Americans back across the Rhine.|$|E

The results of equilibrium binding experiments indicate that the selectivity of the MIP, which is synthesized with a single functional monomer calix [4] arene derivative or acrylamide is poor; while the selectivity of another MIP, which is synthesized with two functional monomers (both calix [4] arene derivative and AM), showed higher and better selective recognition abilities for R-BZH. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>possible</b> to separate and enrich R-BZH from hydantoin-based compounds by molecularly imprinting technique...|$|R
25|$|As Piaget {{believed}} {{development was}} a universal process, his initial sample sizes were inadequate, {{particularly in the}} formulation of his theory of infant development. Piaget’s theories of infant development were based on his observations of his own three children. While this clearly presents problems with the sample size, Piaget also probably introduced confounding variables and social desirability into his observations and his conclusions based on his observations. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>possible</b> Piaget conditioned his children to respond in a desirable manner, so, rather than having an understanding of object permanence, his children might have learned to behave in a manner that indicated they understood object permanence. The sample was also very homogenous, as all three children had a similar genetic heritage and environment. Piaget did, however, have larger sample sizes during his later years.|$|E
25|$|However, memory scepticism {{has been}} criticized as being {{applicable}} to public language, also. If one person can misremember, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>possible</b> that several people can misremember. So memory scepticism could be applied with equal effect to ostensive definitions given in a public language. For example, Jim and Jenny might one day decide to call some particular tree T; {{but the next day}} both misremember which tree it was they named. If they were depending entirely on their memory, and had not written down the location of the tree, or told anyone else, then they would appear to be with the same difficulties as the individual who defined S ostensively. And so, if this is the case, the argument presented against private language would apply equally to public language.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the final}} steps for a {{periphery}} country to rise to semi-periphery or core status is to educate its citizens. Raising the literacy rate allows ideas to spread more quickly through a country and also allows people to better communicate with themselves {{and the rest of}} the world. Also once universities are developed a country can begin to research new technology. Researching new technology can help a country to better compete in a global market by becoming more efficient or selling new technology and industrial techniques. If education and industry is allowed to become developed enough <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>possible</b> for a periphery country to rise to core country status and become a leader in the global market. Another way in which periphery countries better their education system is by spending money to send university level students and staff abroad to places such as the U.S. and Europe to receive better education.|$|E

25|$|After Fouchier {{offered an}} article {{describing}} this {{work to the}} leading academic journal Science, the US National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) recommended against publication of the full details of the study, and the one submitted to Nature by Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Wisconsin describing related work. However, after additional consultations at the World Health Organization and by the NSABB, the NSABB reversed its position and recommended publication of revised versions of the two papers. However, then the Dutch government declared {{that this type of}} manuscripts required Fouchier to apply for an export permit in the light of EU directive 428/2009 on dual use goods. After much controversy surrounding the publishing of his research, Fouchier complied (under formal protest) with Dutch government demands to obtain a special permit for submitting his manuscript, and his research appeared in a special issue of the journal Science devoted to H5N1. The papers by Fouchier and Kawaoka conclude that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>possible</b> that a natural chain of mutations could lead to an H5N1 virus acquiring the capability of airborne transmission between mammals, and that a H5N1 influenza pandemic would not be impossible.|$|E
500|$|The Florence Times {{wrote of}} Presley: [...] "the fellow isn't a bad actor.

In fact, given the normal amount of the more {{painstaking}} type of direction, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>possible</b> that Mr. Wiggle-hips could develop into a really competent actor. As long, however, as he can continue to attract audiences in present proportions there's little need in worrying with drama schools." [...] Allrovi rated the movie with four stars out of five, stating: [...] "The film's highlight is a brief exchange of fisticuffs between Elvis and Walter Matthau.

500|$|Jeremy R. Jehangiri {{criticized the}} Court's ruling {{for failing to}} account for {{psychological}} pressures inherent in the [...] "perceived legitimacy of the [...] authority".

Likewise, Marissa Reich also argued that passengers feel significant [...] "psychological pressures" [...] to cooperate with police searches on buses, and police should therefore warn passengers that consent is voluntary. Joshua Fitch also criticized the Court for ignoring the impact of [...] "racial disparagement" [...] with respect to an individual's ability to walk away from encounters with police. He argued that [...] "iven the historical treatment of black males by members of law enforcement, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>possible</b> that Drayton and Brown feared refusing the officers' requests because they feared violent consequences". Fitch also argued that police should provide warnings similar to Miranda warnings that [...] "inform citizens of their right to refuse consent", and that decisions like Drayton [...] "consistently [...] rules that require citizens to fend for themselves when it comes to constitutional rights".|$|E

500|$|The walls, {{known as}} Changcheng (長城) – {{literally}} [...] "long walls", but often translated as [...] "Great Wall" [...] – were mostly constructed of tamped earth, with some parts built with stones. Where natural barriers like ravines and rivers sufficed for defence, {{the walls were}} erected sparingly, but long fortified lines were laid where such advantageous terrains did not exist. Often {{in addition to the}} wall, the defensive system included garrisons and beacon towers inside the wall, and watchtowers outside at regular intervals. In terms of defence, the walls were generally effective at countering cavalry shock tactics, but there are doubts as to whether these early walls were actually defensive in nature. Nicola Di Cosmo points out that the northern frontier walls were built far to the north and included traditionally nomadic lands, and so rather than being defensive, the walls indicate the northward expansions of the three northern states and their desire to safeguard their recent territorial acquisitions. This theory is supported by the archeological discovery of nomadic artifacts within the walls, suggesting the presence of pre-existing or conquered barbarian societies. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>possible,</b> as Western scholars like di Cosmo and Lattimore suggest, that nomadic aggression against the Chinese in the coming centuries was partly caused by Chinese expansionism during this period.|$|E

In 2003, Homogenic placed on number 21 on Pitchforks list of the top one hundred albums of the 1990s, claiming it as [...] "one of the most perfectly formed records of any era, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>entirely</b> <b>possible</b> that Björk will never approach this level of consistently enrapturing beauty again". In 2007, Slant Magazine gave the highest possible rating of five out of five stars, describing the album as [...] "gorgeous and evocative" [...] and praising it {{as one of the best}} albums of the 1990s. In a career retrospective in 2007, Spin gave the album five out of five stars. In 2011, Slant Magazine placed the album at number one on their list of best albums of the 1990s.
