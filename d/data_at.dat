5|$|Completing {{objectives}} and defeating enemies is rewarded with experience points, {{which are used}} to unlock or upgrade existing disciplines and improve each characters' statistics, such as strength or agility. Weapons, armor, and other accessories can be purchased or upgraded using money or valuable items, which are collected throughout the game. The character's inventory is grid-based; objects occupy an allotted amount of space, requiring {{the management of the}} storage space available. A belt allows some items to be selected for immediate use during gameplay, such as healing items, without the need to access them in the main inventory. The first version of the game allows progress to be saved only in the main character's haven or safehouse; it automatically saves other <b>data</b> <b>at</b> specific points. An update to the game enabled players to save their in-game <b>data</b> <b>at</b> any point in the in-game narrative.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{sites in}} {{southern}} Africa reflect the four characteristics of behavioral modernity. Blombos Cave, South Africa contains personal ornaments {{and what are}} presumed to be the tools used {{for the production of}} artistic imagery, as well as bone tools. Still Bay and Howieson's Poort contain variable tool technologies. These different types of assemblages allow researchers to extrapolate behaviors that would likely be associated with such technologies, such as shifts in foraging behaviors, which are further supported by faunal <b>data</b> <b>at</b> these sites.|$|E

Nødnett gives full coverage along all national and county roads. The system also allows interoperability towards the maritime radio.

5|$|Prior to the {{formation}} of Tropical Depression Fourteen, the southern Caribbean Sea was under a large area of low pressure. On October 30, satellite imagery showed that the area of pressure was beginning to form into a tropical disturbance. A reconnaissance aircraft was scheduled for the next morning to investigate the forming system, but by 1400 UTC on October 31, the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida had upgraded the system to a tropical depression based on the imagery and surface <b>data.</b> <b>At</b> this time, the specialists at the Hurricane Center believed that this was its most developed stage of its lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Robert FitzRoy was {{appointed}} in 1854 {{as chief of}} a new department within the Board of Trade {{to deal with the}} collection of weather <b>data</b> <b>at</b> sea as a service to mariners.

5|$|Several {{species and}} forms were {{described}} before 1800, {{most of them}} with inadequate locality <b>data.</b> <b>At</b> least two names — Amphidromus laevus (Müller, 1774) and the form A. perversus f. aureus Martyn, 1784 — still (as of 2017) {{have not yet been}} reported from a precise locality. During {{the first half of the}} nineteenth century, many species and varieties were named, again usually with poor locality data. Not until Eduard von Martens (1867) published his monograph was there an attempt to cover the entire complex of species within this genus. The 1867 monograph contained considerable information both on the variation within the genus, and on the problems of the geographic distribution of the species. Many concepts that originated with von Martens are still (as of 2017) in use.|$|E

Moreover, during the voyage, the submarine collected reams of oceanographic <b>data.</b> <b>At</b> the cruise's conclusion, Triton received the Presidential Unit Citation and Captain Beach received the Legion of Merit from President Dwight D.
