Through comparison of <b>fixative</b> <b>solutions</b> and of clearing methods, we found optimal conditions to achieve clearer deep-tissue imaging of specific immunolabeled targets and explain what methods result in vivid volume imaging. In addition, we demonstrated that three-dimensional digital image processing after optical clearing produces objective quantitative data for the whole-tissue analysis, focusing on the spatial distribution of mitotic cells in the epididymal tubule.

GP chondrocyte (GPC) hypertrophy has been implicated {{to be the main}} determinant of bone growth rate; however the mechanism is poorly understood. The work of this thesis examined some of the cellular process that drives the chondrocyte swelling or hypertrophy particularly in a mammalian post natal GPs using living in situ GPC and fixed GP tissues. Confocal scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to determine living in situ GPC volume and dimension changes in proliferative zone (PZ) through to hypertrophic zone (HZ) chondrocytes of different GPs of various bones. While PZ cells showed similar volumes and dimensions, HZ cells varied in different GPs, even within the same long bone but at opposite ends. However, the hypertrophic cell volume measured at a single post natal age (day 7) was independent of the corresponding bone length. This could reflect a complex interplay between local and systemic factors in different GPs, which occurs throughout the active phase of bone growth.

40|$|Abstract. Raman {{spectroscopy}} provides {{valuable information}} on the physicochemical properties of hard tissues. While the technique can analyze tissues in their native state, analysis of fixed, embedded, and sectioned specimens may be necessary on certain occasions. The {{information on the}} effects of fixatives and embedding media on Raman spectral properties is limited. We examined the effect of ethanol and glycerol as fixatives and a variety of embedding media (Araldite, Eponate, Technovit, glycol methacrylate, polymethyl methacry-late, and LR white) on Raman spectral properties (mineralization, crystallinity, and carbonation) mea-sured from the cortical bone of mouse humeri. Humeri were fixed in ethanol or glycerol, followed by embedding in one of the media. Nonfixed, freeze-dried, and fixed but not embedded sections were also examined. Perio-steal, endosteal, and midosteal regions of the intracor-tical envelope were analyzed. Raman spectra of <b>fixative</b> <b>solutions</b> and embedding media were also recorded separately in order to examine the specifics of overlap between spectra. We found significant effects of fixation, embedding, and anatomical location on Raman spectral properties. The interference of ethanol with tissue seemed to be relatively less pronounced than that of glycerol. However, there was no single combination of fixation and embedding that left Raman spectral parameters unaltered. We conclude that careful selec-tion of a fixation and embedding combination should be made based on the parameter of interest and the type of tissue. It may be necessary to process multiple samples from the tissue, each using a combination appropriate for the Raman parameter in question...|$|R
40|$|The {{remarkable}} {{increase in}} chondrocyte volume {{is a major}} determinant in the longitudinal growth of mammalian bones. To permit a detailed morphological study of hypertrophic chondrocytes using standard histological techniques, the preservation of normal chondrocyte morphology is essential. We noticed that during fixation of growth plates with conventional <b>fixative</b> <b>solutions,</b> there was a marked morphological (shrinkage) artifact, and we postulated that this arose from the hyper-osmotic nature of these solutions.  To test this, we fixed proximal tibia growth plates of 7 -day-old rat bones in either (a) paraformaldehyde (PFA; 4 %), (b) glutaraldehyde (GA; 2 %) with PFA (2 %) with ruthenium hexamine trichloride (RHT; 0. 7 %), (c) GA (2 %) with RHT (0. 7 %), or (d) GA (1. 3 %) with RHT (0. 5 %) and osmolarity adjusted to a ‘physiological’ level of ~ 280 mOsm. Using conventional histological methods, confocal microscopy, and image analysis on fluorescently-labelled fixed and living chondrocytes, we then quantified the extent of cell shrinkage and volume change. Our data showed that the high osmolarity of conventional fixatives caused a shrinkage artefact to chondrocytes. This was particularly evident when whole bones were fixed, but could be markedly reduced if bones were sagittally bisected prior to fixation. The shrinkage artefact could be avoided by adjusting the osmolarity of the fixatives to the osmotic pressure of normal extracellular fluids (~ 280 mOsm). These results {{emphasize the importance of}} fixative osmolarity, in order to accurately preserve the normal volume/morphology of cells within tissues...|$|R
40|$|The {{morphogenesis}} of the Drosophila embryonic heart tube {{has emerged}} as a valuable model system for studying cell migration, cell-cell adhesion and cell shape changes during embryonic development. One of the challenges faced in studying this structure is that the lumen of the heart tube, as well as the membrane features that are crucial to heart tube formation, are difficult to visualize in whole mount embryos, due to the small size of the heart tube and intra-lumenal space relative to the embryo. The use of transmission electron microscopy allows for higher magnification of these structures and gives the advantage of examining the embryos in cross section, which easily reveals {{the size and shape of}} the lumen. In this video, we detail the process for reliable fixation, embedding, and sectioning of late stage Drosophila embryos in order to visualize the heart tube lumen as well as important cellular structures including cell-cell junctions and the basement membrane.

Destruction of the vein graft's endothelial lining prior to graft implantation results in a more thrombogenic graft which is essentially a collagen-lined tube. This study used light, transmission, and scanning electron microscopy to investigate effects of various methods of vein graft preparation on endothelial and smooth muscle cells of the dog cephalic vein. Veins were removed and stored in one of three heparinized solutions at 10 C for either five minutes or one hour: autologous blood, Plasmalyte® or Plasmalyte® with 0. 6 mg/ml papaverine HCI added. The vein wall was extremely sensitive to dissection, manipulation, or introduction of <b>fixative</b> <b>solutions</b> and reacted to such stimuli with severe contraction which not only diminished the luminal diameter but also resulted in protrusion of endothelial cells into the lumen and formation of cytoplasmic extensions of medial smooth muscle cells. Such cytoplasmic extensions were particularly frequent in the immediate subendothelial area and appeared to be instrumental in elevating, separating, or desquamating the endothelial cell lining. Veins stored in blood alone demonstrated the greatest vessel wall contraction and endothelial cell loss. Veins soaked in Plasmalyte®-papaverine solution had the most relaxed and normal appearance with minimal endothelial cell loss. Papaverine-treated veins which were subjected to brief periods of distension at pressures of 100 mmHg or greater demonstrated large gaps between the endothelial lining cells. The results suggest pretreatment with papaverine greatly reduces vein graft endothelial cell loss due to contraction, although such relaxation may be detrimental if vein grafts are subjected to excessive pressure prior to reversal of relaxation...|$|R
