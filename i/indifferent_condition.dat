The ball, when related to the positive charged surface by the intervening dielectric, has its opposite sides brought into contrary states, that side towards the boiler being negative and the outer side positive. More inductric action is directed towards it than would have passed across the same place if the ball had not been there, for several reasons; amongst others, because, being a conductor, {{the resistance of the}} particles of the dielectric, which otherwise would have been there, is removed (1298.); and also, because the reacting positive surface of the ball being projected further out from the boiler than when there is no introduction of conducting matter, is more free therefore to act {{through the rest of the}} dielectric towards surrounding conductors, and so favours the exaltation of that inductric polarity which is directed in its course. It is, as to the exaltation of force upon its outer surface beyond that upon the inductric surface of the boiler, as if the latter were itself protuberant in that direction. Thus it acquires a state like, but higher than, that of the surface of the boiler which causes it; and sufficiently exalted to discharge at its positive surface to the air, or to affect small particles, as it is itself affected by the boiler, and they flying to it, take a charge and pass off; and so the ball, as a whole, is brought into the contrary inducteous state. The consequence is, that, if free to move, its tendency, under the influence of all the forces, to approach the boiler is increased, whilst it at the same time becomes more and more exalted in its condition, both of polarity and charge, until, at a certain distance, discharge takes place, it acquires the same state as the boiler, is repelled, and passing to that conductor most favourably circumstanced to discharge it, there resumes its first <b>indifferent</b> <b>condition.</b>|$|E

An in-depth analysis of the mechanisms of electrodermal habituation and dishabituation was conducted, focusing on the role of state measures as determinants of the phasic response profile. Twenty-four young adult participants completed an auditory dishabituation task while electrodermal activity was recorded. Participants listened to a series of 10 innocuous tones of the same frequency (standards), followed by a deviant tone of a different frequency, and succeeded by 2 ÃÂ¿ 4 tones of the same frequency as the initial 10 stimuli. All stimuli had a random stimulus onset asynchrony of 5 ÃÂ¿ 7 s. Participants completed an <b>indifferent</b> <b>condition</b> in which there was no task in relation to the stimuli, and a significant condition where instruction was given to count the stimuli silently; order was counterbalanced between participants. As predicted, both skin conductance responses (SCRs) and skin conductance levels (SCLs) were larger for the significant than the <b>indifferent</b> <b>condition.</b> The initial phasic ORs were dependent on pre-stimulus arousal level, and there were significant decreases in both SCR and SCL over the first 10 standards in both conditions. Phasic response recovery was apparent to the deviant stimulus, and dishabituation to the following standard stimulus; both effects were enhanced in the significant condition. Sensitisation was apparent in SCL following the initial and deviant stimuli, but the extent of this was confounded with incomplete resolution of the preceding phasic OR in the significant condition. In the <b>indifferent</b> <b>condition,</b> dishabituation was independent of deviant-related sensitisation; this could not be tested in the significant condition. These findings suggest that dishabituation is not a process of sensitisation, but rather, a disruption of the habituation process...|$|E

Although this fish prefers the warm surface layer, it is relatively <b>indifferent</b> to hydrological <b>conditions,</b> since it may also occur in the thermocline down to the higher levels of 'Central South Atlantic Water'. The oxygen concentration appears to have an important effect upon their distribution, especially the low concentrations occurring with the upwelling.

Therefore, the ring-shaped structures revealed by burning previously ground otoliths could be easily interpreted. Thus, an accurate method for ageing tropical fish is now available. From the age determinations for the Congolese stock, it appears that growth is fast and total mortality rate high. An influence of fishing effort, which increased 3 times during the exploited phase of sampled specimens, appears both in growth and in total mortality. From there an estimate for the fishing mortality could be given. The estimates of dynamic parameters for the Congolese stock are then used in the Beverton-Holt model.

40|$|Surfactant {{precipitation}} applied as a surfactant mediated protein purification {{technique has}} considerable potential in protein extraction, {{and therefore the}} understanding of the interactions involved and the folding behaviour in the precipitated protein was the first aim of this thesis. The key system parameters such as buffer salt concentration, molar ratio of surfactant to protein and pH which determines the protein stability in protein-surfactant complex formation were evaluated. The surfactant:protein ratio determines saturation of protein binding sites while pH determines the strength of affinity for ionic binding which influences hydrophobic binding with surfactant monomers causing the protein to lose its conformation. The protein-surfactant binding varied for lysozyme, cytochrome c and ribonuclease A with trypsin and α -chymotrypsin, and hence the denaturation profile. In the second aim, protein recovery from surfactant precipitation was enhanced by improving the solvent recovery method and, implementing a new and novel counterionic surfactant recovery method. The effect of a variety of recovery phases and solution conditions on lysozyme recovery was analysed in terms of their ability in maintaining protein stability, recovery yield, and activity. It was found that solvent recovery was limited by solvent polarity and protein solubility, and that the cationic surfactant, trioctylmethylammonium chloride (TOMAC), used to form nonpolar ion pairs with sodium bis-(2 -ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate (AOT) was the most efficient method for recovering protein. The third aim was to assess the influence of protein properties, such as charge and hydrophobicity, on protein separation. The selective extraction of a target protein from mixtures of proteins in both buffer and fermentation broth was investigated. It appears that the optimum surfactant:protein molar ratio for the extraction of the proteins from fermentation broth (lysozyme, cytochrome c and ribonuclease A; 16, 17 and 22 respectively) were similar to those in a buffer system. Lysozyme and ribonuclease A were selectively separated from a binary mixture. The extraction behaviour was well represented by surface charge distribution which is <b>indifferent</b> to system <b>conditions.</b> However, certain broth constituents induced the formation of some unfolded irreversible non-dissolvable precipitate in the recovery process. Finally, the use of non-ionic surfactants, ionic/non-ionic mixed surfactants, and cationic surfactants were investigated in surfactant precipitation system. Non-ionic surfactant does not support direct precipitation of proteins using surfactant or recovery of protein from a protein-surfactant complex, and has no effect in a mixed ionic/non-ionic system. The application of cationic surfactant precipitation to separate trypsin inhibitor was attempted, and good recovery was obtained. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
50|$|The {{account of}} the unnamed Levite in Judges 19-20 shows that the taking of concubines was not the {{exclusive}} preserve of Kings or patriarchs in Israel {{during the time of}} the Judges, and that the rape of a concubine was completely unacceptable to the Israelite nation and led to a civil war. In the story, the Levite appears to be an ordinary member of the tribe dedicated to the worship of God, who was undoubtedly dishonored both by the unfaithfulness of his concubine and her abandonment of him. However, after four months, he decides to follow her back to her family home to persuade her to return to him. Her father seeks to delay his return and he does not leave early enough to make the return journey in a single day. The hospitality he is offered at Gibeah, the way in which his host's daughter is offered to the townsmen and the circumstances of his concubine's death at their hands describe a lawless time where visitors are both welcomed and threatened in equal measure. The most disturbing aspect of this account is that both the Levite and his (male) host seek to protect themselves by offering their womenfolk to their aggressors for sex, in exchange for their own safety. The Levite acts in a way that indicates he believes the multiple rape of his unfaithful concubine is preferable to the violation of the virginity of his host's daughter or a sexual assault on his own person. In the morning, the Levite appears to be quite <b>indifferent</b> to the <b>condition</b> of his concubine and expects her to resume the journey, but she is dead. He dismembers her body and distributes her (body parts) throughout the nation of Israel as a terrible message. This is considered outrageous by the Israelite tribesmen, who then wreak total retribution on the men of Gibeah and the surrounding tribe of Benjamin when they support them, killing them without mercy and burning all their towns. The inhabitants of (the town of) Jabesh Gilead are then slaughtered as a punishment for not joining the eleven tribes in their war against the Benjamites, and their four hundred unmarried daughters given in forced marriage to the six hundred Benjamite survivors. Finally, the two hundred Benjamite survivors who still have no wives are granted a mass marriage by abduction by the other tribes.|$|R

Yet this progress has not intrinsically altered our perception of death, except to make it more unacceptable. Although death is seen as a natural phenomenon, part of the normal order of things, it is often an ordeal and a tragedy for those who witness it, as death is not merely the end of a life, but also the end of an existence, the loss of a unique individual who is special and irreplaceable. Death is thus experienced sometimes as an injustice, an outrage, whatever ideas, representations, and beliefs are held on what happens to the person after death, whether death is seen as annihilation or not, as an enigma, a mystery, a passage, a metamorphosis… For many people, whether or not death has meaning depends more on the sense, or lack of it, accorded to life, in accordance with their religious, spiritual or philosophical views. The perception of death differs according, for example, to whether life is held to have no meaning unless it is lived with full possession of all physical and mental faculties, or rather that {{it is part of a}} greater whole that includes, for example, an afterlife, which gives transcendent meaning to the hardships of the life that is coming to an end. It is the tension between the natural side of death and what death contributes to the meaning of life that is today at the heart of debates in France on the end of life. Medicine obviously is not immune to this tension. It responds to the tension through a form of prudential wisdom. Because medicine above all relates to human existences prey to diseases that may be seriously debilitating, life-threatening or life-ending. In the struggle for life, it is medicine’s task to preserve the conditions of a life sufficiently viable to give rise to a veritable existence, and not to seek to avoid death <b>indifferent</b> to the <b>conditions</b> of the existence that ensues. It was in this spirit that the SRLF made its recommendations of 2002 on the withholding and withdrawal of treatment in intensive care [1]. These recommendations were updated in 2009 [2] and were fundamental in the drawing up of Leonetti’s law on the rights of patients and the end of life (No. 2005 – 370 of 22 April 2005). In 2010 an end-of-life issues group was tasked, among other things, with reviewing the state of knowledge on end-of-life conditions and related healthcare practices and with bringing to the public debate objective and reliable data on the reality of end-of-life situations in France. Once again it was the same spirit that drove the recent public debate led by Professor Didier Sicard, Honorary President of the French National Ethics Committee, who was asked by the French President to review end-of-life issues, with a view to drawing up a draft law on the end of life and palliative care.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyse the content of the {{interdisciplinary}} conversations in Göttingen between 1949 and 1961. The task is to compare models for describing reality presented by quantum physicists and theologians. Descriptions of reality <b>indifferent</b> disciplines are <b>conditioned</b> by the development of the concept of reality in philosophy, physics and theology. Our basic problem is stated in the question: How is it possible for the intramental image to match the external object?Cartesian knowledge presupposes clear and distinct ideas in the mind prior to observation resulting in a true correspondence between the observed object and the cogitative observing subject. The Kantian synthesis between rationalism and empiricism emphasises an extended character of representation. The human mind is not a passive receiver of external information, but is actively construing intramental representations of external reality in the epistemological process. Heidegger's aim was to reach a more primordial mode of understanding reality than what is possible in the Cartesian Subject-Object distinction. In Heidegger's philosophy, ontology as being-in-the-world is prior to knowledge concerning being. Ontology can be grasped only in the totality of being (Dasein), not only as an object of reflection and perception. According to Bohr, quantum mechanics introduces an irreducible loss in representation, which classically understood is a deficiency in knowledge. The conflicting aspects (particle and wave pictures) in our comprehension of physical reality, cannot be completely accommodated into an entire and coherent model of reality. What Bohr rejects is not realism, but the classical Einsteinian version of it. By the use of complementary descriptions, Bohr tries to save a fundamentally realistic position. The fundamental question in Barthian theology is the problem of God as an object of theological discourse. Dialectics is Barth¿s way to express knowledge of God avoiding a speculative theology and a human-centred religious self-consciousness. In Barthian theology, the human capacity for knowledge, independently of revelation, is insufficient to comprehend the being of God. Our knowledge of God is real knowledge in revelation and our words are made to correspond with the divine reality in an analogy of faith. The point of the Bultmannian demythologising programme was to claim the real existence of God beyond our faculties. We cannot simply define God as a human ideal of existence or a focus of values. The theological programme of Bultmann emphasised the notion that we can talk meaningfully of God only insofar as we have existential experience of his intervention. Common to all these twentieth century philosophical, physical and theological positions, is a form of anti-Cartesianism. Consequently, in regard to their epistemology, they can be labelled antirealist. This common insight also made it possible to find a common meeting point between the different disciplines. In this study, the different standpoints from all three areas and the conversations in Göttingen are analysed in the frameworkof realism/antirealism. One of the first tasks in the Göttingen conversations was to analyse the nature of the likeness between the complementary structures inquantum physics introduced by Niels Bohr and the dialectical forms in the Barthian doctrine of God. The reaction against epistemological Cartesianism, metaphysics of substance and deterministic description of reality was the common point of departure for theologians and physicists in the Göttingen discussions. In his complementarity, Bohr anticipated the crossing of traditional epistemic boundaries and the generalisation of epistemological strategies by introducing interpretative procedures across various disciplines...|$|R
40|$|Human {{communities}} have remained {{under the influence}} of geographical factors until recently. Besides this, a human community is not such a being which accept the geographical factors as they are and remain <b>indifferent</b> to such <b>conditions</b> as plant and animal communities do, but is a living creature which attempts to change, to challenge against them. There is a geographical location on which every civilization that has experienced historical events is established. The most important role in spread and expansion, ordissipation and destruction of a civilization is assumed by the natural conditions of the time. A political formation established on a geographical territory that is extremely rich of favorable climate conditions, fertile soils and water resources will undoubtedly develop. History has three never changing main elements. Place (location) time and human. Historical events cannot be clearly explained without any one of them. In order to {{have a better understanding of}} the history, not only the geography on which human communities live, but also how the geographical factors influence the lives of people living on a location should be known. Hence, what the history requires is not an absolute knowledge of geography. On the contrary, what the history requires is the influence of the soil, waters and seas of that location on the people living on it. Human is a living creature using and dominating the natural resources, recognizing their boundaries, and adapting to several things which he cannot overcome. Geographical factors have positively or negatively influenced human communities and political, economical, religious and cultural lives of such communities, and are continuing to influence albeit not as intense as formerly. Each human community occupies a place on the world. In other words, all the human {{communities have}} geographical location. Geographical location influences the material lives of the human communities living on it in different ways. For instance, lives of the people settled on seaside and of people settled on flatlands, lives of people settled along rivers and of people settled on moorlands are different from each other. In this case, historical events should be tried to be explained within the framework of the influences of geographical locations on which communities live on the communities Throughout the history, one of the most important elements in choice of a geography as a settlement area by people has been closeness to water resources. Moreover, many kingdoms established in Anatolia have chosen the geographies where water resources are located as settlement area. For instance, while the Hittite State, which has dominated Anatolia since the mid-IInd millennium B. C., settled on the region comprising Kızılırmak, the Phrygians, which became a strong kingdom in the first quarter of Ist millennium BC, settled on the Sakarya basin, and the Urartian Kindom, which emerged between the 9 th- 6 th centuries BC, settled on the region between Van and Urmiye lakes. Among the said kingdoms, the Hittites and Phrygians found the water resources areas in Middle Anatolia, and the Urartians found the water resources areas in East Anatolia suitable for themselves. This was the case for the villages just as was for kingdoms and cities. First villages were concentrated on a junction point, along shores of a river, on cross points of rivers, or nearby a resource. Water resources have both influenced the spread areas of the kingdoms established in Anatolia and been influential on the political events that have taken place between the kingdoms. As it is known, the concept of political boundary is not applicable in the Ancient Age history. Instead, the geography has been identified as boundary. Thus, at the end of the war that took place inthe Ancient Age between Med and Lydian Kingdoms in 585 B. C., Kızılırmak emerges as the boundary separating the two states from each other. Furthermore, Aras and Dicle Rivers, which are among the most important water resources of Anatolia, still serve as a boundary. Besides all these, according to the Ancient Age literature, the fact that human communities which settle on a region give theirnames to the geography they settle on is a known method. Almost all of the water resources located in Anatolia have been calledwith such names that are different from those used in the Ancient Age. Among these which are covered by this study, Kızılırmak has been called with the names Marasantiya and Halys, Sakarya has been called with the name Sangarios, Aras has been called with the name Araxes, Fırat and Dicle rivers have been called with their Sumerian and Akkadiannames as well as such names as Euphrates and Tigris. Anatolia, which has had the most important natural resources and located at the junction point of the world since the most ancient ages, has always been attention-attractive with its many regions and differentgeographical characteristics isolated from each other with mountain ranges. In virtually every age of the history, it has been split into neighborhoods having various cultural characteristics. These have over time turned into regions bearing different geographical names, where different ethnical groupslive. It is very usual that people living in Anatolia have given several names to the localities they lived on. Some of these names have disappeared, whereas some have not changed although others have settled on that region. Besides this, the geography of Anatolia show great variation in terms of elevation, climate, water resources and strategy. Middle and East Anatolia Regions, which are subject of this study, which have extremely rich history and natural resources, constitute a central region located between Mediterranean and Mesopotamia on the south, Iran on the east, Black Sea on the north, Caucasia on the north-east, and Aegean Sea on the west by their geographical locations. Hence, this region is a junctionpoint of the ancient civilizations which have shined and faded thousands of years ago. East Anatolia’s high flatlands and Middle Anatolia’s moorlands had all the favorable features to meet needs of the people who have lived in the prehistoric ages. They had attracted people with plentitude of the water resources, presence of natural shelters, meadow and forest areas and particularlyplentifulness of hunt animals. Today, although Middle and East Anatolia Regions exhibit a semi-naked appearance, it is very likely that they were such regions covered by dense forests and winter-resistant forests along the creeks and brooks flowing curved within the basins in prehistoric ages. Both Middle Anatolia region and East Anatolia region are on such locations which could be considered adequate in terms of water resources. Most important water resources of Middle Anatolia are Kızılırmak and Sakarya rivers, and their branches, Delice and Porsuk creeks. Most important water resources of Middle Anatolia Region are Aras, Fırat and Dicle rivers, and their branches, Kura, Karasu, Murat and Habur. The water resources called with these names nowadays have influenced either settlement potential or settlement density of Middle and East Anatolia for both prehistoric and historical ages. Prehistoric cave drawings in East Anatolia Region and accommodation places in Middle Anatoliaare very important in terms of enlightening the prehistoric ages of both Anatolia and neighbor countries. When reviewed the archeological map of both Middle Anatolia region and East Anatolia region, a dense settlement is encountered in prehistoric ages, particularly in the Bronze Age. Number of written documents on to the prehistoric ages of Middle and East Anatolia has increased since the mid-IInd millennium B. C., and are increasing day by day. While in these ages the most importantpolitical formation in Middle Anatolia was the Hittite State, which had chosen the curve of Kızılırmak as central territory for itself, a number of Hurri states are mentioned about for East Anatolia. It has now been understood that the central region of the Hurrians was the Van Lake field. We encounter the Hittites and Phrygians,who have chosen for themselves the area where water resources existed, Kızılırmak and Sakarya basins, in the early Ist millennium B. C. in Middle Anatolia, and the Urartian State, which has settled on the region occupied by the Hurris and established a strong kingdom in East Anatolia. Just like for the villages and cities, one of the most important requirements for the states to be able to survive is water resources. While not the most important, the trouble suffered in the water resources and the accompanying drought are remarkable among the reasons that have been influential in collapse of the Hittites. Water resources, in another words, running water network, is of utmost importance today as was in the past. Particulars of water resources in many aspects from their names to their importance in the Ancient Age, from their roles in the events that have taken place between the kingdoms to their records encountered in ancient will be addressed in this study...|$|R
