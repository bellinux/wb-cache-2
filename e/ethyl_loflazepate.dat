50|$|<b>Ethyl</b> <b>loflazepate</b> (marketed {{under the}} brand names Meilax, Ronlax and Victan) {{is a drug}} which is a {{benzodiazepine}} derivative. It possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. In animal studies it {{was found to have}} low toxicity, although in rats evidence of pulmonary phospholipidosis occurred with pulmonary foam cells developing with long-term use of very high doses. Its elimination half-life is 51-103 hours. Its mechanism of action is similar to other benzodiazepines. <b>Ethyl</b> <b>loflazepate</b> also produces an active metabolite which is stronger than the parent compound. <b>Ethyl</b> <b>loflazepate</b> was designed to be a prodrug for descarboxyloflazepate, its active metabolite. It is the active metabolite which is responsible for most of the pharmacological effects rather than <b>ethyl</b> <b>loflazepate.</b> The main metabolites of <b>ethyl</b> <b>loflazepate</b> are descarbethoxyloflazepate, loflazepate and 3-hydroxydescarbethoxyloflazepate. Accumulation of the active metabolites of <b>ethyl</b> <b>loflazepate</b> are not affected by those with renal failure or impairment. The symptoms of an overdose of <b>ethyl</b> <b>loflazepate</b> include sleepiness, agitation and ataxia. Hypotonia may also occur in severe cases. These symptoms occur much more frequently and severely in children. Death from therapeutic maintenance doses of <b>ethyl</b> <b>loflazepate</b> taken for 2 - 3 weeks has been reported in 3 elderly patients. The cause of death was asphyxia due to benzodiazepine toxicity. High doses of the antidepressant fluvoxamine may potentiate the adverse effects of <b>ethyl</b> <b>loflazepate.</b>|$|E

5000|$|N-Desalkylflurazepam (also {{known as}} Norflurazepam) is a {{benzodiazepine}} analog and an active metabolite {{of several other}} benzodiazepine drugs including flurazepam, flutoprazepam, fludiazepam, midazolam, quazepam, and <b>ethyl</b> <b>loflazepate.</b> [...] It is long-acting, prone to accumulation, and binds unselectively to the various benzodiazepine receptor subtypes. [...] It has been sold as a designer drug from 2016 onward.|$|E
50|$|Ethyl carfluzepate {{is mainly}} a {{hypnotic}} drug {{which is a}} benzodiazepine derivative and induces sleep in a strong manner. It is similar to <b>ethyl</b> <b>loflazepate</b> in chemical structure, the other difference being an absence of methylcarbamoyl group. Its also similar in metabolism to this substance, only the methyl-carboxylate group would {{be the difference between}} the main metabolites. Two of the main metabolites must be the 3-hydroxylate or the substance with only a hydrogen atom at the 3-position of the molecule structure. In order to that the resulting main metabolite could probably be ethyl-7-cloro-5-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methylcarbamate)-2-oxo-3H-1,4-benzodiazepine-3-hydroxylate (and the 3-OH instead of the 3H metabolite). Its properties are mainly sedative and hypnotic.|$|E
40|$|A {{volunteer}} {{study was}} undertaken {{to assess the}} respiratory effects of <b>ethyl</b> <b>loflazepate,</b> a new benzodiazepine, and to correlate these with plasma concentrations of the active metabolites. Twelve volunteers were given placebo, 2 mg <b>ethyl</b> <b>loflazepate,</b> and 6 mg <b>ethyl</b> <b>loflazepate</b> on separate occasions. Respiration and plasma metabolite levels were assessed hourly for 8 h and at 24 h. The 6 mg <b>ethyl</b> <b>loflazepate</b> treatment produced a significant decrease (P less than 0. 02) in the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide at 5 h. However this did not equate with a peak in plasma metabolite concentrations which were maintained at a plateau level from 4 to 24 h...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Benzodiazepines {{carry the}} risk of {{inducing}} cognitive impairments, which may go unnoticed while profoundly disturbing social activity. Furthermore, these impairments are partly associated with the elimination half-life (EH) of the substance from the body. The object {{of the present study}} was to examine the effects of etizolam and <b>ethyl</b> <b>loflazepate,</b> with EHs of 6 h and 122 h, respectively, on information processing in healthy subjects. Methods Healthy people were administered etizolam and <b>ethyl</b> <b>loflazepate</b> acutely and subchronically (14 days). The auditory P 300 event-related potential and the neuropsychological batteries described below were employed to assess the effects of drugs on cognition. The P 300 event-related potential was recorded before and after drug treatments. The digit symbol test, trail making test, digit span test and verbal paired associates test were administered to examine mental slowing and memory functioning. Results Acute administration of drugs caused prolongation in P 300 latency and reduction in P 300 amplitude. Etizolam caused a statistically significant prolongation in P 300 latency compared to <b>ethyl</b> <b>loflazepate.</b> Furthermore, subchronic administration of etizolam, but not <b>ethyl</b> <b>loflazepate,</b> still caused a weak prolongation in P 300 latency. In contrast, neuropsychological tests showed no difference. Conclusions The results indicate that acute administration of <b>ethyl</b> <b>loflazepate</b> induces less effect on P 300 latency than etizolam. </p...|$|E

No previous reports have described cases showing comorbidity with psychiatric disease or symptoms. In this case, we showed a patient with PKD who exhibited several manifestations of anxiety disorder. Case: A 35 -year-old Japanese man with PKD had been maintained on carbamazepine since he was 16 years of age without any attacks. However, 10 years before this referral, {{he became aware of}} a feeling of breakdown in his overall physical functions. He had then avoided becoming familiar with people out of concern that his physical dysfunctions might be perceived in a negative light. One day he was referred by the neurologic department at our hospital to the Department of Psychiatry because of severe anxiety and hyperventilation triggered by carbamazepine. We treated with escitalopram, aripiprazole, and <b>ethyl</b> <b>loflazepate.</b> Both his subjective physical condition and objective expressions subsequently showed gradual improvement. At last, the feelings of chest compression and anxiety entirely disappeared. Accordingly, increases in plasma monoamine metabolite levels were observed, and the c. 649 dupC mutation, which has been found in most Japanese PKD families, was detected in his proline-rich transmembrane protein 2 gene. Conclusion: This is the first report to describe psychiatric comorbidities or symptoms in a PKD case. The efficacy of psychotropic medication used in this case, the resulting changes in plasma monoamine metabolite levels, and the recent advances in the molecular understanding of PKD suggested slight, but widespread alterations to the neurotransmitter systems in the brain.
