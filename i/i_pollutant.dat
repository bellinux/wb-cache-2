Nine types of metallic materials, namely iron, Q 235 steel, 20 # steel, 16 Mn steel, copper, bronze, brass, aluminum, and aluminum alloy, were selected as specimens for corrosion tests. Ten sets of the nine materials were all exposed to ambient air, and then each set was collected individually after exposure to ambient air for consecutive 6, 13, 20, 27, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, and 70 days, respectively. After the removal of the corrosion products {{on the surface of the}} exposed specimens, the corrosion rate of each material was determined.

Motivated by prior studies on accidents associated with mining operations, this paper builds a formal optimization model to address the above three sustainability related issues for a mining operation with the optimal decision on mining quantity. To be specific, we model the number of accidents as a Poisson distribution with a quantity dependent distribution parameter. We formulate the objective function via the mean-variance approach, and incorporate analytical constraints which relate to environmental sustainability and CSR into the model. We analytically derive the algorithm which can find the globally optimal solution for the optimization problem.

The wake structure behind a queue of studied vehicles is mainly dominated by the last one, while the preceding vehicle(s) {{will lead to a}} stronger downwash flow in the wake. For the vehicle with rear slant angle (α 30 °) which has a two-dimensional wake flow, the vehicular exhaust jet plume will be carried by such a wake flow to form an "n-shaped" scalar distribution region behind the vehicle with a peak scalar region at its center. The preceding vehicle(s) will further enlarge the n-shaped scalar distribution region and push the peak scalar region closer to the ground. It is clearly shown that the two- or three-dimensional flow behind the studied vehicle can provide different shapes of exhaust scalar dispersion and distribution fields in the vehicle wake.

A circular structure of the Bio-AG system which {{is different from the}} previously applied network structures is assumed. Since the negative externalities (<b>i.</b> e., <b>pollutant</b> emissions from the biomass industry) occur in the Bio-AG system, the property rights are taken into consideration to model the externalities-adjusted profits. Therefore, the changes in profits due to changes in the property rights (assuming no property rights, allocating property rights to agricultural sector, and allocating property rights to biomass power generation sector) are quantified. Further, the decomposition shows that the biomass power generation sector is less affected by technical inefficiency if contrasted to allocative inefficiency in terms of the profit loss. The findings suggest that the biomass power generation technology influences the profits of the biomass industry. What is more, the inefficient allocation of resources is now the key factor undermining performance of the biomass industry. Therefore, the government should adopt measures to improve the allocation of resources and prevent excessive investments or development of less efficient technologies...|$|R

40|$|Background information. A {{significant}} and increasing source of nutrients to freshwater and marine ecosystems is atmospheric deposition (AD), either as “wet deposition ” or as “dry deposition ” of particles and “gaseous exchange ” between {{the air and}} water. Three steps are involved in wet deposition: (<b>i)</b> the <b>pollutants</b> need to {{come into contact with}} condensed water in the atmosphere; (ii) the pollutants must be scavenged by the droplets; and (iii) it then has to start raining before the condensed water evaporates back into water vapor, thereby releasing the pollutants back into the air (Seinfeld and Pandis, 2006). Dry deposition can be conceptualized as a three-step process: (1) the gas or particle is moved toward the surface by thermally or mechanically driven eddies; (2) it is transferred by diffusion across a thin layer close to the surface where turbulence is absent; and (3) the gas or particle is captured by the surface (Seinfeld and Pandis, 2006).
