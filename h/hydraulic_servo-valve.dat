An actuator characteristic number is defined to provide a base for an optimum design of force actuators with combined weight, frequency, and force considerations. This characteristic number may {{also be used to}} compare hydraulic and electromagnetic force actuators. In tests, this actuator generated 182. 3 Newton force at a frequency of 100 Hz and a displacement amplitude of 5. 8 x 10 exp - 5 meter...|$|E
40|$|The {{injection}} molding process, {{due to its}} versatility, cost effectiveness, and ability to produce intricate shapes to tight specifications, is widely used in plastics processing. Mold cavity pressure {{plays an important role}} in determining the quality of the molded articles. The dynamic behaviour and control of cavity pressure were studied in this research project. The work deals with all phases of the process: filling, packing, and cooling. A real-time data acquisition and computer control system has been developed to assist the implementation of advanced control techniques for {{injection molding}} machine operation. Modularity and extensibility were emphasised in its development. The dynamics of cavity pressure during filling were investigated and found to be both non-linear and time-varying in relation to the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>servo-valve</b> opening which is the manipulated variable. A self-tuning control system was designed and tested for a wide range of conditions. The transition of the filling-to-packing was found to be best detected by the derivative of the cavity pressure. The dynamics of cavity pressure during packing were studied and modelled similarly as for filling. The self-tuning technique was successfully extended into the packing phase. Cavity pressure is essentially independent of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>servo-valve</b> opening once the cavity gate freezes and the process enters the cooling phase. A cooling system was designed to provide quick manipulation of coolant temperature. Controlled pressure cooling time (CPCT) was proposed to represent the behaviour of cavity pressure during the cooling phase. Its dynamics in relation to coolant temperature were found to be best described as a first order system. A control system for CPCT was designed and successfully tested...|$|E

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} system {{identification}} and modeling techniques {{applied to a}} fly-by-wire system for pitch control of a commercial jet aircraft. The objective {{of the work is}} to build a model based on system identification techniques and generic modeling of the system, therefore using the "grey box" approach. The identification data was obtained from experimental tests performed at Embraer "Iron Bird" laboratory. An overview on flight controls systems is presented, focusing on fly-by-wire technology. To provide the theoretical bases for the experimental identification, a review on system identification techniques is presented, together with the preliminary modeling and determination of model structure. It is further presented the identification test laboratory configuration, test procedure and results analysis using the Matlab "System Identification Toolbox". The resulting transfer function obtained from system identification process is used to identify the dynamical characteristics of the system's components (<b>hydraulic</b> actuator, <b>servo-valve,</b> electronic control). The linear model identified is therefore analyzed and validated and the non-linearities identified during the analysis are included in the final complete model...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to obtain the correct {{hydraulic}} proprieties of a <b>hydraulic</b> spool <b>servo-valve</b> using computational fluid-dynamics (CFD) techniques and adopting an accurate enough mesh to analyse the flow pattern inside the valve. The zones where thickening of the mesh is necessary have been detected and a method to generate the mesh, based on Reynolds numbers and spool stroke, has successfully been used to minimize computational resources. A comparison with numerical and experimental results (Dong and Ueno, 1999) confirms the accurate description of the behaviour of the valve. The results have been compared with the theoretical behaviour, through a 1 D multi-physics model simulation, {{in order to understand}} in which conditions the theoretical model is not able to describe the valve properties carefully enough and a more accurate CFD model should be used. As CFD analysis requires high computational resources, a method to improve 1 D model accuracy through CFD techniques has been proposed, so that after a preliminary CFD analysis of the valve, {{it would be possible to}} analyse a whole hydraulic system with a 1 D mode...|$|R
40|$|Communication acceptée à un congrès IFAC 2017 International audienceIn {{the active}} {{anti-roll}} bar control on heavy vehicles, roll stability and energy consumption of actuators are two essential but conflicting performance objectives. In a previous work, the authors proposed an integrated model, including four electronic <b>servo-valve</b> <b>hydraulic</b> actuators in a linear yaw-roll model {{on a single}} unit heavy vehicle. This paper aims to design an H ∞ active anti-roll bar control and solves a Multi-Criteria Optimization (MCO) problem by using Genetic Algorithms (GAs) to select the weighting functions for the H ∞ synthesis. Thanks to GAs, the roll stability and the energy consumption are handled using a single high level parameter and illustrated via the Pareto optimality. Simulation results in frequency and time domains emphasize {{the efficiency of the}} use of the GAs method for a MCO problem in H ∞ active anti-roll bar control on heavy vehicles...|$|R
40|$|The {{injection}} molding process, {{due to its}} versatility, cost effectiveness, and ability to produce precise complex articles is widely used in plastics processing. Mold cavity pressure is a good indicator of the processes {{taking place in the}} cavity and {{plays an important role in}} determining the quality of the molded articles. The dynamic modeling and control of cavity pressure, based on a physically-based approach, is studied in this research project. The work deals with the filling and packing phases. A lumped physically-based model was developed in order to study the behavior of the system. The model is derived from conservation laws and incorporates a physical understanding of the process. The whole system was divided into subsystems including the hydraulic system, ram-screw, barrel, and polymer delivery system. It was found necessary to account for polymer melt elasticity as well as non-Newtonian behavior of the polymer melt flow. Consideration of the growing solid skin in the polymer delivery system was found to be necessary. The dynamics of the cavity pressure during the filling phase were investigated and found to be non-linear and time-varying in relation to the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>servo-valve</b> opening which is the manipulated variable. The dynamic behavior of the cavity pressure is approximated by piece-wise linearization of the non-linear governing equations to derive a transfer function using the physically-based model which is of fifth order. Adaptive PI, PID, and IMC controllers were designed and tested for the control of the cavity pressure. Various tuning techniques, along with changes in set-point, were used to determine conservative settings for the PI and PID controllers. A similar approach was used to study the dynamics of the cavity pressure during the packing phase. A sixth order transfer function, with piece-wise linearization, was derived to approximate the non-linear and time-varying behavior of the cavity pressure during packing. The adaptive PI, PID, and IMC controllers were successfully applied into the packing phase. The transition of the filling-to-packing was selected to be detected by the derivative of the cavity pressure and adaptive controllers were successfully used for this phase. Two commonly used {{injection molding}} grade thermoplastics, polyethylene and polystyrene, were used in experimental part of this work for model validation and controller testing...|$|E
40|$|International audienceRollover {{of heavy}} vehicle is an {{important}} road safety problem worldwide. Although rollovers are relatively rare events, they are usually deadly accidents when they occur. The roll stability loss is {{the main cause of}} rollover accidents in which heavy vehicles are involved. In order to improve the roll stability, most of modern heavy vehicles are equipped with passive anti-roll bars to reduce roll motion during cornering or riding on uneven roads. However these may be not sufficient to overcome critical situations. This paper introduces the active anti-roll bars made of four electronic <b>servo-valve</b> <b>hydraulic</b> actuators, which are modelled and integrated in a yaw-roll model of a single unit heavy vehicle. The control signal is the current entering the electronic servo-valve and the output is the force generated by the hydraulic actuator. The active control design is achieved solving a linear optimal control problem based on the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) approach. A comparison of several LQR controllers is provided to allow for tackling the considered multi-objective problems. Simulation results in frequency and time domains show that the use of two active anti-roll bars (front and rear axles) drastically improves the roll stability of the single unit heavy vehicle compared with the passive anti-roll bar...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of how pulsatile flow affects flux behaviour in crossflow micro-filtration was investigated. The effects of pulsatile flow were sub-divided into shear effects and backflushing effects. A <b>servo-valve</b> <b>hydraulic</b> piston pump {{was applied to}} generate pulsatile flows in the membrane module with particular waveforms. Four types of fluid pulsation with specific flow-rate and pressure waveforms were produced for experimental tests. Two parameters, /dVcf/ maxand Pmin, were examined independently for their effect during pulsatile flow, which was estimated by comparing the cake resistance during steady flow and pulsatile flow at the same mean crossflow velocity, trans-membrane pressure and membrane resistance. Filtration tests for all the pulsatile flows with clean water confirmed that pulsatility only affects cake depositions. Without particles, no flux improvement was obtained. The results for the microfiltration of 0. 5 g/ 1 silica suspension showed that for pulsatile flows without backflushing (i. e. no negative transmembrane pressure peak), the fluid pulsation decreased cake resistance when the shear related parameter /dVcf/max exceeded a critical value for each given waveform. When the instantaneous transmembrane pressure reached negative values, i. e. back-flushing occurred, the cake resistance was reduced for all pressure waves tested. Cake resistance was reduced more for more negative P min. With two of the waveforms tested, the cake resistance was almost completely eliminated. In contrast, the shear affected cake resistance reduction differently for each waveform. Comparing cake reduction results for different pulsatile waveforms, it was found that, for the square wave, the cake resistance reduction was higher for both shear and backflushing effect tests, while for the short spike waveform, the cake resistance reduction was lower. The flux waveforms were seen to follow the variations in transmembrane pressure. The flux response time was longer than the time required for the pressure changes, but was not dependent on {{the direction of the}} pressure change...|$|R
