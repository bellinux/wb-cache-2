5|$|Disney {{settled on}} the film's concept as work neared {{completion}} on The Sorcerer's Apprentice, an elaborate Silly Symphonies short designed as a comeback role for Mickey Mouse, who had declined in popularity.

The soundtrack was recorded using multiple audio channels and reproduced with Fantasound, a pioneering sound reproduction system that made Fantasia the first commercial film shown in stereophonic sound.|$|E

5|$|Although {{societal}} {{awareness of}} AIDS had developed {{at a slower}} pace in Canada than in the United States, films regarding the disease had appeared nearly concurrently: both the first Canadian documentary and the first American <b>feature-length</b> <b>film</b> on the subject, Nik Sheehan's No Sad Songs and John Erman's An Early Frost respectively, were released in 1985. However, the majority of the early gay artists with AIDS had died by the time Hoolboom made Frank's Cock; as such, the film scholar Thomas Waugh considers Hoolboom a second-generation figurehead in AIDS activism and one of the earliest not coming from the gay community.|$|E

5|$|Eraserhead is a 1977 American surrealist body horror film written, produced, and {{directed}} by filmmaker David Lynch. Shot in black-and-white, Eraserhead is Lynch's first <b>feature-length</b> <b>film,</b> coming after several short works.

5|$|In 1914, {{while working}} for the Balboa Amusement Producing Company, William Jossey wrote the {{screenplay}} for the first <b>feature-length</b> <b>film</b> adaptation. Filming took place in Long Beach, California, where the Balboa studios were located. Footage of an actual church under construction {{across the street from}} the studio was used for a scene in which one was built by St. Elmo. Contemporary writers credited Bertram Bracken as director, as do some modern sources, including the American Film Institute. Others consider the film the directorial debut of J. Gordon Edwards. Both men subsequently had long careers directing for Fox Film.|$|E

5|$|St. Elmo is a 1914 American silent drama film {{produced}} by the Balboa Amusement Producing Company and distributed by William Fox's Box Office Attractions Company. It was the first <b>feature-length</b> <b>film</b> adaptation of Augusta Jane Evans's 1866 novel of the same name. The story follows {{the life of the}} title character (played by William Jossey), who kills his cousin (Francis McDonald) over the love of Agnes (Madeline Pardee), falls from grace, and eventually finds redemption and love with Edna (Gypsy Abbott). It is disputed who directed the film; many sources credit Bertram Bracken, while others list St. Elmo as J. Gordon Edwards's directorial debut.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons Movie, a <b>feature-length</b> <b>film,</b> was {{released}} in theaters worldwide on July 26 and July 27, 2007. Previous attempts to create a film version of The Simpsons failed {{due to the lack}} of a script of appropriate length and production crew members. Eventually, producers Brooks, Groening, Al Jean, Mike Scully, and Richard Sakai began development of the film in 2001. They conceived numerous plot ideas, with Groening's being the one developed into a film. The script was re-written over a hundred times, and this creativity continued after animation had begun in 2006. The film was a box office success, and received overwhelmingly positive reviews.|$|E
