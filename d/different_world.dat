50|$|Tadashi Ehara, {{the buyer}} for the San Francisco game store Gambit, became the second {{employee}} of Chaosium. <b>Different</b> <b>Worlds</b> magazine {{was launched in}} 1979 by Ehara and Greg Stafford of Chaosium as a general-interest role-playing magazine. Ehara became the first editor of <b>Different</b> <b>Worlds,</b> and remained editor-in-chief throughout the magazine's run. Ehara left Chaosium in 1985 and took <b>Different</b> <b>Worlds</b> with him, due to financial difficulties the company was having, and publishing resumed with <b>Different</b> <b>Worlds</b> #39 (May/June 1985) through Ehara's new partner, Sleuth Publications; only eight issues were published by Sleuth over a two-year period, ending with <b>Different</b> <b>Worlds</b> #46 (May/June 1987). Much of the Judges Guild inventory was sold to Ehara. Gamelords was sold to Ehara in 1986, and he received 10,000 pounds of backstock in 344 cartons on December 1, 1986. Ehara's last big acquisition while at Sleuth was a license to publish the original Empire of the Petal Throne game. Ehara withdrew from Sleuth, taking with him all the RPG products and properties he had acquired over the previous two years. Ehara then used <b>Different</b> <b>Worlds</b> {{as the basis of}} a new company, <b>Different</b> <b>Worlds</b> Publications, although he only put out one more issue of <b>Different</b> <b>Worlds,</b> #47 (Fall 1987). From 1987-1989, Ehara also published a reprint of Empire of the Petal Throne (1987), and a reprint of part of Gamescience's Swords & Glory (1987-1988), the second Tékumel RPG.|$|R

5|$|When {{his mother}} left the group, Guest moved {{back with her}} to the United Kingdom. Guest, his mother and {{stepfather}} Martin moved to north London, and he began the process of experiencing adolescence in a society different from that inside the Rajneesh movement. Guest reentered society at age 11, and faced confusion over the contrast in experiences between his childhood in the Rajneesh movement and his new experiences as a teenager in London. He enrolled in the Haverstock School in north London, but had trouble during his teen years with drugs and alcohol. He had difficult relations with his stepfather, and had not spent much time with him prior to the move to London. Anne and Martin went through a period of time where they thought they were beings from a <b>different</b> <b>world,</b> and read books on UFOs. Guest fostered his interest in reading, and went on to study at university.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to Miyamoto's design {{mentality of}} {{creating}} the gameplay system first, development started out with the scenario writing, which Flagship was in charge of. Some of the staff members, the team led by director and designer Hidemaro Fujibayashi that was responsible for tasks other than the storyline, wanted to skip the remake and create an original Zelda title right away. As the first installment in the series was deemed too difficult for {{the new generation of}} players, more and more changes were applied {{to the point where it}} had an entirely <b>different</b> <b>world</b> map. As a result, the team ran into problems because the scenario and the maps had to be reworked constantly to make all the modifications match. The Game Boy Color's screen presented an additional hurdle when attempting to rework the earlier Zelda title as it is narrower than that of a television; players could not view an entire room without scrolling which made it easy to overlook stairways or clues on walls.|$|E
50|$|The {{application}} of functions to value sets creates combinations of value sets from <b>different</b> <b>worlds.</b> Narrowing reduces those worlds by eliminating combinations of <b>different</b> <b>worlds</b> {{from the same}} world set. Narrowing rules also detect situations where some combinations of worlds are shown to be impossible.|$|R

5|$|Germany's Miroslav Klose equalled the Brazilian Cafu as {{the player}} with most matches {{being on the}} winning side at the World Cup, with 16 victories. Klose played his 23rd World Cup match, equalling Paolo Maldini on 2nd place on most World Cup matches, with only Lothar Matthäus {{remaining}} with more (25). Klose has played in more knockout games than Matthäus or Cafu – 13, and also became the only player {{to take part in}} four World Cup semi-finals (Uwe Seeler previously played in three semi-finals). In the match, he broke the record for the most goals scored at the World Cup with 16, overtaking Brazil's Ronaldo's total of 15; Ronaldo was in attendance at the match as a commentator. Thomas Müller's goal was Germany's 2,000th in the history of their national team. Müller became the third player in history to score five or more goals in two <b>different</b> <b>World</b> Cups (after Klose and the Peruvian Teófilo Cubillas) and the second player to score five or more goals in consecutive World Cups (after Klose). Toni Kroos' first-half double scored in 69 seconds was the fastest pair of goals scored in World Cup history by the same player.|$|E
