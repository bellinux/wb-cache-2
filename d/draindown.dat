40|$|Previous {{laboratory}} and field {{research has demonstrated}} that virgin synthetic and cellulose fibers provide important attributes for hot mix asphalt (HMA) : reduced asphalt (mastic) <b>draindown</b> during construction for certain types of mixtures, reinforcement which significantly reduces cracking; and, in some cases, reduced rutting. By-product fibers from grinding of scrap tires offer an excellent, low-cost alternative to virgin and cellulose fibers. Currently, most of these fibers are being disposed of in landfills or incinerated. Two types of recycled tire fibers were evaluated to determine whether they can be used in different types of HMA mixtures as a replacement of currently used cellulose fibers or mineral fiber. The researchers tested three different types of mixtures: stone mastic asphalt (SMA), permeable friction course (PFC), and coarse mix high binder (CMHB) mixtures with two different types of recycled tire fibers, one cellulose fiber, and no fiber. HMA specimens were prepared using all of these combinations and tested using several common laboratory test procedures.

40|$|Stone Matrix Asphalt (SMA) is a gap graded mix, {{characterized}} by high coarse aggregates, high asphalt contents and polymer or fiber additives as stabilizers. High concentration of coarse aggregate maximizes stone-to-contact and interlocking {{in the mix}} which provides strength, and the rich mortar binder provides durability. The stabilizing additives composed of cellulose fibers, mineral fibers or polymers are added to SMA mixtures to prevent <b>draindown</b> from the mix. In comparison to dense graded mixtures SMA has higher proportion of coarse aggregate, lower proportion of middle size aggregate and higher proportion of mineral filler. It resists permanent deformation and {{has the potential for}} long term performance and durability. In the present study, an attempt has been made to study the engineering properties of mixtures of stone matrix asphalt made with three types of binders namely conventional bitumen 80 / 100 and 60 / 70 and modified binder CRMB 60, with a non-conventional natural fiber, namely coconut fiber. The binders and fibers in different proportions are used for preparation of mixes with a selected aggregate grading. The role of a particular binder and fiber with respect to their concentrations in the mix is studied for various engineering properties. For this, various Marshall samples of SMA mixtures with and without fibers with varying binder type and its concentration are prepared. The optimum binder content is determined keeping the suggested air voids content in the mix. Marshall properties such as stability, flow value, unit weight, air voids are used to determine optimum binder content and optimum fiber content for each type of binder for further studies on SMA mixes. Thereafter, the <b>draindown</b> characteristics, both static and repeated indirect tensile strength parameters and moisture susceptibility characteristics in terms of tensile strength ratio and retained stability of different SMA mixtures values have been studied for such mixes. It is observed that only 0. 3 % addition of coconut fiber significantly improves the Marshall properties of SMA mixes.

Utilization of the SMA mix in Indonesia has constraints in gain stabilizer and also difficulty to comply the gradations, mainly because it needs a relatively large amount of filler. Alternative of local materials {{that can be used}} is asbuton (natural rock asphalt from Buton Island). Asbuton is expected to act as a stabilizer and simultaneously provides an additional filler. The objective of this research is to evaluate the performance of the SMA that uses the asbuton. The methodology used in this research is the experimental method, its starts from material testing, design mix and performance testing that includes dynamic modulus, permanent deformation and fatigue resistance. The results obtained showed asbuton can prevent asphalt <b>draindown</b> as well as increase the proportion of filler. <b>Draindown</b> asphalt can be prevented by using binder absorbers with fiber cellulose and viscosity boosters with asbuton. Asbuton (LGA 50 / 25) can behave as a stabilizer as well as cellulose fiber. Addition of asbuton also improves the performance of the SMA mix, as shown with increase in the value of dynamic stability. In terms of resistance to fatigue, SMA with cellulosa as stabilizer and SMA with asbuton as stabilizer, relatively have the same performance. Master curve of dynamic modulus indicates SMA with asbuton as stabilizer is relatively stiffer at high temperatures (more than 4. 4 °C), but relatively less stiff (less brittle) at low temperatures...|$|E

30|$|Recently, the {{application}} of fiber in asphalt modification has attracted many researchers. Experimental results have shown that fibers have better performance than polymers in reducing <b>draindown</b> of AC mixtures, {{and this is the}} reason why fibers are widely used in stone matrix asphalt and open-graded friction course (Hassan et al. 2005). In terms of efficiency, fiber–asphalt mixture shows a slight increase in the optimum asphalt binder content compared with the pure asphalt mixture. In this way, adding fibers to asphalt is very similar to the addition of very fine aggregates. Thus, fibers can stabilize asphalt to prevent leakage. This is due to the adsorption of asphalt on fibers (Tapkin et al. 2010; Wu et al. 2014). The reported results indicate that fiber–asphalt mixtures have good moisture resistance, creep compliance, and rutting resistance, low-temperature anti-cracking properties, and durability (Tapkin et al. 2010). The mechanism of how fibers modify asphalt is complicated, yet the impact upon pavement performance is profound (Hassan et al. 2005).|$|E
40|$|Stone Mastic Asphalt (SMA) is a gap-graded asphalt mixture {{that depends}} on the stone-to-stone contact to provide its load {{carrying}} capacity against rutting. However,binder <b>draindown</b> is a problem for SMA mixtures, due to its intentional high binder content. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the volumetric properties, binder drainage, rutting and stripping performances in the SMA 14 mixture. Two different cellulose fibres were used in SMA 14 mix, which is synthetic fibre (Viatop 66) and natural fibre (Kenaf) to prevent binder drainage. In this study, 0. 3 percent cellulose fibres, by weight of mixture, were uniformly combined with the dried aggregate before the asphalt cement was added during mixing process. Laboratory specimens were prepared using 50 blows of the Marshall hammer per side. The optimum binder content (OBC) for SMA 14 mixtures was selected to produce 4 percent air voids and <b>draindown</b> of less than 0. 3 percent. The OBC for the SMA 14 mix with synthetic fibre (Viatop 66) was found to be 6. 1 percent at 4 percent air voids, while the OBC for the SMA 14 mix with natural fibre (Kenaf) was found to be 5. 9 percent at 4 percent air voids. The obtained OBC was used to prepare samples for rutting and stripping tests. Number of compaction applied for rutting and stripping samples were based on a trial and error method to obtain 7 ± 0. 5 percent of air voids. Rut depth for SMA 14 mix with natural fibre (Kenaf) obtained is 1. 6 mm compared to SMA 14 mix with synthetic fibre (Viatop 66) which is 1. 8 mm. The tensile strength ratio recorded for both mixes are greater than 80 percent, that resulting in enough stripping resistance. Based on ESEM, in SMA 14 mix with natural fibre, the voids were filled with natural fibre and the fibre interacts well with the other substances. This indicates that the natural fibre could efficiently retain the binder in the mix. Therefore,natural fibre could be an alternative material to replace the synthetic fibre for the SMA 14 mixture...|$|E

Afterward, the basket was heated in an environmental chamber under higher temperatures, and some asphalt binder would melt, flow, and drop out due to the heating effect. Two temperatures, 130 and 140  °C, were used for all the fibers, while an additional temperature of 170  °C was applied for the cellulose fiber, since no obvious asphalt drops could be measured at lower temperatures. The sample was weighed at 30 -min intervals, to determine the weight loss of asphalt binder. Lower weight loss and flowing of asphalt indicated the fiber’s greater capacity to adsorb and stabilize asphalt.|$|E

40|$|Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) {{has been}} using Open Graded Friction Course (OGFC) mixture to improve skid {{resistance}} of asphalt pavements under wet weather. The OGFC mixture design strongly depends on the Optimum Binder Content (OBC) which represents if the mixture has sufficient bonding between the aggregate and asphalt binder. At present, the FDOT designs OGFC mixtures using a pie plate visual <b>draindown</b> method (FM 5 - 588). In this method, the OBC is determined based on visual inspection of the asphalt binder <b>draindown</b> (ABD) configuration of three OGFC samples placed on pie plates with pre-determined trial asphalt binder contents (AC). The inspection of the ABD configuration is performed by trained and experienced technicians who determine the OBC using perceptive interpolation or extrapolation based on the known AC of the above samples. In order to eliminate the human subjectivity involved in the current visual method, an automated method for quantifying the OBC of OGFC mixtures was developed using digital images of the pie plates and concepts of perceptual image coding and neural network (NN). Phase I of the project involved the FM- 5 - 588 based OBC testing of OGFC mixture designs consisting of a large set of samples prepared {{from a variety of}} granitic and oolitic limestone aggregate sources used by FDOT. Then the digital images of the pie plates containing samples of the above mixtures were acquired using an imaging setup customized by FDOT. The correlation between relevant digital imaging parameters and the corresponding AC was investigated initially using conventional regression analysis. Phase II of the project involved the development of a perceptual image model using human perception metrics considered {{to be used in the}} OBC estimation. A General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) was used to uncover the nonlinear correlation between the selected parameters of pie plate images, the corresponding AC and the visually estimated OBC. GRNN was found to be the most viable method to deal with the multi-dimensional nature of the input test data set originating from each individual OGFC sample that contains AC and imaging parameter information from a set of three pie plates. GRNN was trained by 70 % and tested by 30 % of the database completed in Phase I. Phase III of the project involved the configuration of a quality control tool (QCT) for the aforementioned automated method to enhance its robustness and the likelihood of implementation by other agencies and contractors. QCT is developed using three quality control imaging parameters (QCIP), orientation, spatial distribution, and segregation of ABD configuration of pie plate specimens (PPS) images. Then, the above QCIP were evaluated from PPS images of a variety of independent mixture designs produced using the FDOT visual method. In general, this study found that the newly developed software (GRNN-based) provides satisfactory and reliable estimations of OBC. Furthermore, the statistical and computer-generated results indicated that the selected QCIP are adequate for the formulation of quality control criteria for PPS production.

The influence of bituminous mastics extends to the overall stability of a mixture, air void distribution, bitumen <b>draindown</b> during transport, a mixture's workability during the laying process, and the overall in-time performance of the pavement. To understand the properties of asphalt mixtures and their resistance to environmentally induced failure mechanisms, it is paramount to study not only bitumen and the asphalt mixture but also the mastic itself. Current asphalt design procedures do not take mastic behavior into account, however; this omission leads to a significant flaw in the ability to design and predict asphalt concrete response. This paper presents the results of an ongoing research project to enhance the understanding of the mastic phase as well as to develop a new test protocol to characterize mastics. A description is given of the measurements of mastic viscosity for different types of mastics in which the bitumen source is kept as a constant but with varying fillers as well as concentrations. Environmental susceptibility was investigated by subjecting the samples to aging and moisture conditioning.

A porous asphalt pavement differs from traditional asphalt pavement designs in that the structure permits fluids to pass freely through it, reducing or controlling the amount of run-off from the surrounding area.

The overall benefits of porous asphalt pavements may include both environmental and safety benefits including improved stormwater management, improved skid resistance, reduction of spray to drivers and pedestrians, {{as well as a}} potential for noise reduction. With increasing environmental awareness and an evolving paradigm shift in stormwater management techniques, this research aims to provide guidance for Canadian engineers, contractors, and government agencies on the design of porous asphalt pavement structures.
