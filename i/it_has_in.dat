5|$|In Glenfinnan, the Hogwarts Express crosses a viaduct, as <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> {{the past}} films. Aerial scenes were shot in Glen Coe, in Clachaig Gully, and Glen Etive, which, {{at the time}} of filming, {{was one of the few}} places in Scotland without snow, making it ideal for a backdrop.|$|E
5|$|In some cases, yes, I think <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> {{terms of}} some of the stuff they did in the Middle East {{supporting}} the pro-democracy demonstrators. But a lot of bad things too, unnecessarily harassing people – I would class that as a bad thing. DDOSing the CIA website, stealing customer data and posting it online just for shits and giggles is not a good thing.|$|E
5|$|Integrity: being {{whole and}} complete, and honoring one’s word. In the est context {{the word is}} used to depict a matter of workability, rather than with the moral overtones <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> {{everyday}} usage.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, the Swedenborgian Church of North America {{had about}} 1,800 members, almost {{identical}} to the membership <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> 1981 but rather less than the 5,440 <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> 1925.|$|R

5|$|The {{company made}} its first {{acquisition}} on March 2, 1988, with its purchase of Network Innovations. In its two divestments, {{both of which were}} during the 1990s, parts of the company were sold to other companies. In 2013, Apple acquired thirteen companies—more than <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> any other year so far. Apple's largest acquisition was that of Beats Electronics in August 2014 for US$3 billion. Of the companies Apple has acquired, 49 were based in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{watershed}} of Abrahams Creek {{is continuing}} to become more developed, but at a slower rate than <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> the past. The lower reaches of the watershed are the most heavily urbanized, while the upper reaches are still largely rural. This {{has been the case}} as early 1893. The upper reaches of the watershed have a dendritic drainage system.|$|E

50|$|Senior {{also set}} about {{building}} {{the size of}} the Socialist Party's membership ranks. Historian David A. Shannon recalled:"When Clarence Senior became national secretary in the summer of 1929, he brought to the national office some long-needed vigor. the results were immediate. By the end of 1929 the Socialist Party had gained more members than <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> all the years since 1923. Through the United Socialist Drive <b>it</b> <b>had</b> raised more funds than <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> years, <b>it</b> <b>had</b> revived the flow of Socialist pamphlets which had all but dried up since the war, and <b>it</b> <b>had</b> boosted the circulation of Socialist newspapers....|$|R
5|$|In towns, the Cape sparrow {{competes with}} both the native {{southern}} grey-headed sparrow and house sparrow, which was introduced to southern Africa in the 19thcentury. Since it is more established around humans in its range than either, it successfully competes with both species, though they may exclude it from nesting in holes. A survey by birdwatchers completed in 2000 found the Cape sparrow increasing in abundance in some suburban areas of South Africa (the northern Johannesburg area, and Pietermaritzburg) and decreasing in others (the southern Cape Town area). The house sparrow was reported decreasing in several urban areas, as <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> parts of Europe, declines which are attributed to factors including the increasing density of garden plantings and increases in predation.|$|E
5|$|Locations in England {{included}} the River Thames, {{for the flight}} of the Order of the Phoenix to Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place, and the flight of Dumbledore's Army to the Ministry of Magic. This sequence also includes such landmarks as the London Eye, Canary Wharf, Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, and the HMS Belfast. Filming at Platform 9¾ took place at King's Cross Station, as <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> the past. A telephone booth near Scotland Yard was used as Harry and Arthur Weasley enter the Ministry, while the crew closed the Westminster tube station on 22 October 2006 to allow for filming of Arthur Weasley accompanying Harry to his trial at the Ministry of Magic. Other scenes were filmed in and around Oxford, specifically at nearby Blenheim Palace in Woodstock.|$|E

50|$|In {{historical}} times, {{the village}} was mentioned {{for the first time}} in a letter passed in 1257 by Friar Estevão Martins, 12th abbot of the Monastery of Alcobaça. The bay was the sea port of Alcobaça, where activities related to fishing and shipbuilding were developed. <b>It</b> <b>had,</b> <b>in</b> 1801, 932 inhabitants. In 1839 the parishes of Alfeizerão, Salir do Porto and Serra do Bouro were annexed. <b>It</b> <b>had,</b> <b>in</b> 1849, 3,596 inhabitants.|$|R

25|$|However, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> {{recent years}} also been {{incorporated}} in the Advent liturgy in the Church of Norway.

25|$|Though the Chabad {{movement}} {{was founded in}} Eastern Europe, a center of Ashkenazic Jewry, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> {{the past several decades}} attracted a significant number of Sephardi Jews as adherents. Some Chabad communities are now a mix of Ashkenazi and Sephardi Chabad Hasidim. In Montreal, close to 25% of Chabad households include a Sephardi parent.|$|E

25|$|Since {{a buffet}} {{involves}} diners serving themselves, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> the past been considered an informal form of dining, less formal than table service. In recent years, however, buffet meals are increasingly popular among hosts of home dinner parties, especially in homes where limited space complicates the serving of individual table places.|$|E
25|$|Historically, the Indian {{team has}} not {{performed}} as well overseas as <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> India. Since the year 2000, the Indian team underwent major improvements {{under the guidance}} of coach John Wright and captain Saurav Ganguly. The team drew a Test series with Australia in Australia, which is usually considered a tough tour. It was followed by a historic Test and ODI series win against arch-rivals Pakistan while playing in Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{a relief}} showing {{starving}} Bedouins was unearthed, {{which is very}} similar to the one from the pyramid of Unas. This discovery is significant as Unas' relief was thought to be the unique witness of a real event: the declining quality of life of Saharan Bedouins brought about {{by the end of the}} Sahara wet phase c. 2350 BC, when <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> fact a mostly symbolic value.|$|E

25|$|Hitchens {{argues that}} the human race no longer needs {{religion}} to the extent <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> the past. He says {{the time has come}} for science and reason to take a more prominent role in the life of individuals and larger cultures; that de-emphasizing religion will improve the quality of life of individuals, and assist the progress of civilization. It is in effect a rallying call to atheists to fight the theocratic encroachment on free society.|$|E
25|$|Sexually {{transmitted}} diseases {{also made a}} resurgence {{around the same time}} as prostitution, and have been directly linked to prostitution. There are fears that prostitution may become the main route of HIV transmission as <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> developing countries such as Thailand and India. Some regions have introduced a policy of 100% condom use, inspired by a similar measure in Thailand. Other interventions have been introduced recently at some sites, including STI services, peer education and voluntary counselling and testing for HIV.|$|E
25|$|The {{marsh frog}} (Pelophylax ridibundus, a {{non-native}} species introduced from Europe in the 1930s) is now {{commonly found in}} the upper Mole and its tributaries around Newdigate and Gatwick. There {{is no evidence that}} the presence of the frogs has had a deleterious effect on indigenous amphibians. A second non-native species, the edible frog (Pelophylax kl. esculentus) was introduced to a site at Newdigate in the early 1900s. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>in</b> 2008 been recorded in tributaries of the River Mole at Capel and Brockham.|$|E
