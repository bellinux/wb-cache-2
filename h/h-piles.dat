40|$|<b>H-piles</b> {{are widely}} used to support bridge piers and foundations, {{particularly}} those founded on relatively weak subsoil layers. The piles are forcefully driven to stronger layers to transfer the load of the entire structure to the bearing strata. Driven steel <b>H-piles</b> are designed to effectively interact with their surrounding environment {{in and out of}} the ground without failure. Standard practices such as AASHTO/LRFD and state codes regulate the load bearing capacity and drivability of <b>H-piles</b> to ensure safe performance during their service life.

40|$|Negative skin {{friction}} (NSF) {{is a common}} problem {{to be considered in}} designing pile foundations located in consolidating ground. Failures of foundations due to either NSF induced compressive axial force (Dragload) or excessive pile foundation settlement (Downdrag) has been widely reported in the literature. The results of eleven centrifuge model tests, numerical simulations and simple analytical solutions were reported which were undertaken to achieve four objectives: first, to investigate response of piles subjected to NSF with different pile tip location with respect to end-bearing stratum layer, and secondly, to study the effect of pile shapes on development of negative shear stress on pile shafts, and thirdly, to investigate and compare behaviour of floating piles subjected to NSF with shielding by either a sacrificing ring or a group of sacrificing piles, and finally, to look at the effect of axial live loads on load transfer mechanism along piles experiencing locked-in NSF [...] In this study, larger downdrag is developed on floating piles and neutral plane (NP) is located lower towards pile tip with stiffer end-bearing layer. Neutral plane locations on a single pile can be estimated by a simple analytical approach considering displacement compatibility, cavity expansion at the pile tip and vertical force equilibrium of piles. It is found that depth of NP increases with increasing end bearing stiffness of pile, interface friction angle and surcharge. Axial load effects on load transfer mechanism of piles with different pile tip location with locked-in dragload are investigated. For single floating piles with Y= 0. 25 D and Y= 1. 00 D, the amount of measured axial load requires to completely overcome the dragload was about 1. 75 Pmax and 1. 44 Pmax, respectively. Unlike single pile, amount of axial load required to eliminate NSF for pile group can be as large as more than 4 times Pmax for the floating pile group. To study the effect of openness of pile sections on load transfer mechanism of NSF, centrifuge and three-dimensional numerical modeling of conventional pile shapes, circular, rectangular with aspect ratio = 2 and <b>H-pile</b> were carried out. Vertical shear mechanism predicts that external shaft friction induced on piles with close sections is insignificant. Only a little reduction in σv̕ result. On the other hand, large reduction in vertical effective stress is experienced by the soil element located at the pan area of an <b>H-pile</b> (open section). Fairly good agreement with centrifuge tests results is made with the analytical prediction by vertical shear mchanism and numerical simulations. The shielding effects on dragload and downdrag are represented quantitatively using two dimensionless terms, Pr and Wr, respectively. The measured Pr of the center pile surrounded by a sacrificing ring with 0. 50 L, 0. 75 L and 1. 00 L length was 42 %, 54 % and 67 %. Correspondingly, measured Wr of the center pile surrounded by a sacrificing ring with 0. 50 L, 0. 75 L and 1. 00 L length was 15 %, 25 % and 50 %. This shows that shielding effect on dragload increase gently with an increase in sacrificing ring length, while the shielding effect on downdrag increase exponentially with an increase in length of the ring. For center pile shielded by means of a group of 3 x 3 sacrificing piles in full length measured Pr and Wr are 47 % and 43 %, respectively. Moreover, the sacrificing ring only occupy one-forth of the material weight of a group of sacrificing piles for the same spacing and provide better shielding effect. Numerical simulations of the centrifuge model tests on center piles revealed that the observed shielding effects on a center pile are attributed to the stress transfer from consolidating soft soil to sacrificing structures. As consolidation proceeds, the relatively stiff sacrificing structure "hang-up" soils, leading to a significant reduction in the σv̕, σh̕ in the soil and thus NSF on center piles. Sacrificing ring provides a better distribution of material to give a larger surface area for hanging up soils. Soils neighboring the center pile are enclosed or isolated by the relatively stiff ring so that stress transfer from far field to the enclosed soils is negligible. This leads to the enhanced reduction in NSF along lengths of the sacrificing ring...|$|R
40|$|Prebored precast {{prestressed}} concrete pile (PPPCP) {{is a new}} pile type imported from Japan to Macau. During the construction of PPPCP, the soil at the proposed pile location is agitated to a loose state and then mixed with cement grout before the installation of a precast {{prestressed concrete}} pile. It is an environmentally friendly technique which generates little noise to nearby residents and little disturbance to nearby structures during construction. Moreover, the material cost of PPPCP can be 30 % {{less than that of}} the steel <b>H-pile</b> with similar design load-carrying capacity. However, the engineering behavior of PPPCP is not well analyzed outside Japan. In this research, a comprehensive study is carried out on two fully instrumented trial PPPCPs and three working PPPCPs installed in Macau. Full-scale pile load test data are available for analysis and the engineering behavior of this new type of pile is investigated. In this study, a new method that used to estimate the ultimate capacity of PPPCP from non-failing load tests is developed. As for the load-settlement characteristics, an empirical equation is proposed to evaluate the elastic settlement of PPPCP and a hyperbolic function is recommended to simulate creep settlement. The shaft and tip resistance of the PPPCP are investigated and the separation between the shaft and tip resistance is made. The distribution and development of shaft resistance along the pile shaft is analyzed and the load transfer mechanism of PPPCP is better understood. A new correlation between the SPT-N value, the effective vertical stress and the unit shaft resistance of PPPCP is proposed. Furthermore, a numerical model is established to simulate the behavior of PPPCP under static load. A PLAXIS 2 D model is used to serve this purpose and the simulated load-settlement behavior exhibits a good agreement with the results of static pile load tests. It is observed that the load distribution along the pile shaft simulated by the PLAXIS 2 D axisymmetric model is generally in good agreement with the measured distribution. It seems that the PLAXIS 2 D model can provide a good simulation of the load transfer mechanism of PPPCP with reasonable accuracy. After this study, the engineering behavior of the newly introduced pile, i. e. PPPCP, is better understood, and this would be beneficial for promoting its application in the industry. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R

The importance of such vibration has increased rapidly due to developments in construction in urban areas, where the effects of ground borne vibration on both humans and structures are considerable. Research has been undertaken to improve techniques used in the measurements, analyses and evaluation of ground vibrations caused by rail and road traffic, blasting and in particular those generated from pile driving activities. The amplitude of the vibration caused by the pile driving operation is a function of pile type, hammer type and the ground conditions. In order to investigate the effects of these three variables, a large number of visits were made to different sites which provided a range of different driving conditions. The main requirements in the analysis of the vibrations measured include vibration amplitude and their relevant frequency. The vibration amplitude is usually expressed in term of peak particle acceleration, velocity or displacement. In this work, the ground vibration is measured in terms of peak particle velocity using velocity transducers (geophone). In order to evaluate the true peak particle resultant velocity, the three components of the ground vibration are measured simultaneously by three orthogonally positioned sets of geophone. Recording the vibration data is achieved by employing a portable digital recorder which digitizes the analogue signals recieved from the transducers and stores the captured data on standard floppy disks for further analysis. The results are presented in tables and diagrams and detailed comments are given in the discussion of the recorded data. Some methods of analyses are reviewed and two new methods are proposed. These proposed methods include the application of the hemispherical projection technique in interpreting and displaying the three dimesional vibration information into a two dimensional plane.

Great concern has arisen over the performance of jacked piles as {{compared with that of}} driven piles. This paper describes a comprehensive field study that was aimed at investigating the differences and similarities between the behaviour of jacked <b>H-piles</b> and that of driven <b>H-piles.</b> The instrumented piles, varying in length from 32 to 55 m and having a design capacity of up to 3540 kN, were installed in residual soils whose properties are close to silty sands. The load test results indicate that the shaft resistance of jacked piles is generally suffer and stronger than that of driven piles, but the base resistance of jacked piles is weaker than that of driven piles. At a load level of twice the design capacity, the percentage of pile head load carried by base varies from 2 % to 10 % for jacked piles, with a mean value of 6 %; for driven piles the percentage varies from 6 % to 61 % with a mean value of 38 %. The back-calculated values of the shaft friction coefficient, β, were found to be in a range of 0. 25 - 0. 6 for both jacked and driven piles.

In establishing these parameters, the effects of residual driving stresses are included. The results indicate that if the area between the pile flanges {{is assumed to be}} one-half plugged by the soil, then the ultimate capacity in compression can be estimated by applying the correlations established by Coyle and Castello for full displacement piles. The results also indicate that the pile's load-settlement characteristics can be approximated by again assuming the flange area to be one-half plugged and modeling the pile-soil system on the axially loaded pile computer program known as APILE.

Their predictability for high capacity long driven <b>H-piles</b> in weathered soils is in doubt. In this thesis, the final sets of 4, 278 <b>H-piles</b> of 28 - 80 m long, dynamic measurements of 255 of them and static loading tests of 13 instrumented piles from a site are studied. Pile behaviours caused by a hammer impact and under static test load are compared with 361 <b>H-piles</b> of 14 - 25 m long from another site and theoretical predictions. Measured data revealed that the load-transfer mechanism varied with pile length and applied load. Piles deformed almost linearly with increased load and might fail in buckling with or without large plastic deformation. Unit side resistance degraded after prolonged hard driving. Maximum impact forces at final set were scatter but their means were insensitive to hammer type, ram weight, ram drop and pile length. Maximum impact compression of pile and affected pile length existed. Creep settlement and set-up effect in weathered soils were quantified. Geotechnical design parameters for local soils were calibrated. Factors affecting dynamic soil parameters were explained. Two improvements to {{the prediction}}s were proposed. The energy-based equation uses the final sets and energy transferred to pile head to estimate the affected pile length. Piles longer than the length estimated will be considered as long piles and existing theories have to be applied with caution. If this length is used instead of full pile length in Hiley formula, predictability of the formula can be improved. The advantages of this modification to Hiley formula are its simplicity to use in field and the low cost compared with the stress-wave monitoring techniques. The new Case damping model approximates the Case damping factor as the sum of hysteretic damping of pile and viscous damping of surrounding soil. Based on this model, the effects of variation in load-distribution along pile shaft and set-up of pile in layered soils, and the incomplete mobilization of soil at pile toes to the Case damping factor can be explained...|$|E

This study concludes that the regional LRFD procedure will increase the plan pile length by 25 % for sand and 12 % for mixed soil profile as opposed to 86 % and 93 %, respectively, if the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) procedure had been implemented. Despite the additional cost incurred by switching to the regional LRFD procedure, it satisfies the target reliability index of 2. 33 for a redundant pile group and the 1 % probability of failure stipulated in the AASHTO LRFD Specifications.

When this happens, the effective stresses between the soil and the pile wall diminish, and the pile shaft resistance decreases. A piling project {{was carried out in}} a marble area in Hong Kong, where highly variable rockhead contours and deep depressions filled with weak soil deposits were found. Many steel <b>H-piles</b> were driven to depths of more than 100 m, and the verticality of such long piles was a concern.

This paper aims at interpreting the verticality of the four long piles, studying the relevance of pile verticality to the encountered geological features, and studying the effect of pile verticality on the pile capacity. The maximum lateral pile movement during driving was up to 8. 7 m at a depth of 100 m, and the maximum local pile inclination reached 0. 139. The lateral {{movements of}} the piles during driving well matched the rockhead inclination and soil conditions. Both one-way sway and two-way cyclic sway of the test piles were observed. Cyclic sway was shown to cause more severe reduction of the pile shaft resistance than one-way sway. DOI: 10. 1061 /(ASCE) GT. 1943 - 5606. 0000707.

40|$|Driven steel <b>H-piles</b> are {{commonly}} used in Hong Kong as the foundation to support structures. These piles are traditionally installed with termination criteria derived from Hiley's formula. However, the assumptions in Hiley's formula are not suitable for long piles. In this research, the application of wave equation analysis in deriving termination criteria for long steel <b>H-piles</b> founded in granitic saprolites was studied and implemented. A methodology to develop final set tables for long driven piles using wave equation analysis was outlined. To verify the performance of piles final set using the wave equation approach, two preliminary piles, PP- 1 A 2 - 2 and PP- 1 B 3 - 1, were installed based on the new termination criteria. Dynamic and static load tests were carried out on these two piles to confirm the adequacy of pile capacity. Both the pile settlement values at twice the design load and the residual settlement values were well below allowable limits. Hence, the proposed methodology can provide a cost-effective yet safe solution to long piles. Soil parameters for wave equation analyses of driven piles in 6 types of common soils in Hong Kong were also derived from a comprehensive correlation study. With these parameters, final set tables for piles of different lengths can be developed for pile construction. A Hong Kong Driven Pile Database was developed in this project using Microsoft Access. The database contains information of over 1500 piles, with complete records of 308 static load tests, 1276 dynamic tests and 257 CAPWAP analyses. It {{is one of the}} largest databases for steel <b>H-piles</b> in the world. To assist pile design in future projects, comprehensive searching functions are developed and demonstrated with design examples. Using the piling data in the database, the reliability of pile capacity prediction by various dynamic methods was evaluated. It is found that Hiley's formula generally underestimates the capacity of long piles. The predictions from Case's method and CAPWAP analysis are less scattered but these methods also underestimate the pile capacity. An evaluation study on 348 cases of steel <b>H-piles</b> founded on saprolites was also conducted to study the accuracy of driving stress predictions by the methods proposed by ICE (1954) and Bowles (1988), and by wave equation analysis. It is found that the wave equation analysis gives the best predictions among the three methods. The mean and standard deviation of the measurement-to-prediction ratio are 0. 98 and 0. 085, respectively. The load transfer in 14 instrumented long piles founded in granitic saprolites was also studied. The distributions of shaft resistance with depth were developed and the characteristics of the mobilization of both toe and shaft resistances were also studied. The Beta values and toe capacity factor Nq for granitic saprolites were back calculated. For Beta values, the mean is 0. 63 while the standard deviation is 0. 38. For toe capacity factor Nq, the mean and standard deviation are 98 and 50, respectively. Local movements of 3. 3 - 8. 3 % of pile diameter are required for substantial mobilization of the toe resistance. For substantial mobilization of shaft resistance, local movements of 1. 0 - 8. 0 % of pile diameter are required. These values are in a wider range than those for concrete piles. The pile capacity changes with time after construction, which is referred to as pile setup. The setup effect of steel <b>H-piles</b> founded in granitic saprolites, however, has not been sufficiently studied in the literature. In this project, the setup effect was studied through a series of dynamic tests and static load tests carried out on piles PP- 1 B 3 - 1 and PP- 1 A 2 - 2 up to 106 days after the end of driving. Setup in shaft resistance was observed while relaxation occurred at the pile toe. The setup factor Ai for completely decomposed granite was evaluated. The mean of Ai is 0. 58, which is slightly higher than those reported by Bullock et al. (2005), based on relatively short concrete piles in sand and clay. The setup factor tends to decrease with depth...|$|E
40|$|Although dynamic {{methods such as}} driving {{formulas}} {{and wave}} equation analyses {{have been used for}} the determination of the bearing capacity of piles for decades, experience with dynamic methods for very long piles is still limited. This papers aims at evaluating performance of Hiley's formula and a wave equation program GRLWEAP using four cases of very long steel <b>H-piles</b> driven into weathered materials. The pile length studied varies from 78 in to 108 in. The geotechnical pile capacities and pile driving characteristics predicted using Hiley's formula and GRLWEAP are compared and the maximum stresses during installation of these long piles are studied. The wave equation analysis shows superiority over Hiley's formula at hard driving. For the four cases studied, the pile capacity values from Hiley's formula are consistently lower than those from the wave equation analysis and from a static load test...|$|E
40|$|A {{dynamic load}} test program {{consisting}} of 38 sites and 111 piles with restrikes was conducted throughout Illinois {{to improve the}} Illinois Department of Transportation design of driven piling. Pile types included steel <b>H-piles</b> and closed-ended pipe (shell) piles. Piles were driven into all soil types including clay, silt, sand, shale, and limestone. Predictive methods for estimating pile capacity were investigated and include the K-IDOT (static) method, WSDOT (dynamic formula), WEAP, PDA, and CAPWAP. Pile capacities were taken as the capacity estimated using CAPWAP for beginning of restrike conditions. Piles were monitored during initial driving. Piles were re-driven several days later to assess the amount of setup to assess the effect of time, pile type and soil type. Restrikes were conducted typically between 3 - 15 days after initial driving. Modifying WSDOT to include effects of setup explicitly with specific equations (Skov and Denver...|$|E
40|$|T-walls in New Orleans {{appeared}} to survive hurricane Katrina while I-walls failed in several sections. However, {{it is still}} unclear whether these T-walls truly survived the hurricane with fair amount of safety margins or barely survived it with hidden damages. The initial design of T-walls is based on rather oversimplified loading conditions with limited consideration of soil structure interaction. In this study, rigorous 3 D numerical analyses are conducted incorporating realistic loading conditions and rigorous soil-structure interactions but with time saving techniques to evaluate the detailed behavior of T-walls. This paper addressed the procedure of innovative 3 D numerical analyses and important findings using special structural elements in FLAC 3 D. From this study, T-walls are found to have adequate stress levels in <b>H-piles</b> and concrete walls. However, it showed that the major factor that may cause the instability of the T-wall is the slope instability type rotational force {{that could not be}} considered in the initial design. This unexpected rotational force, however, was counteracted by the batter piles so that the overall integrity of the T-wall system is maintained. ...|$|E
40|$|Since 2008, the Public Works Department of Malaysia {{had adopted}} the {{integral}} abutment bridge concept {{as one of}} the initiatives to reduce the maintenance costs of bridges. Although this type of bridge is popular in the developed country such as United States, United Kingdom and Japan, the use of integral bridges in the South East Asia Country is considered relatively new. While most of the researches focussed on theoretical dynamic characteristic of bridge founded with <b>H-piles,</b> this paper presents the theoretical dynamic characteristics of integral bridge abutment with bored piles determined by the FE modal analysis performed by using ABAQUS software. A single-span integral bridge located in Pahang, Malaysia has been selected as the case study. The modal characteristics of the same design of bridge with simply supported bridge yield different values of modal frequency, which are higher.
