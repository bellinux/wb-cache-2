5|$|Bloody Fun Days {{theme was}} {{inspired}} by the short story Everything Can Be Beaten by Jhonen Vasquez. The story centres on a monster called It, who spends his life in the confines of a single room, waiting in front of a chute that kittens slide down. He crushes the kittens with a hammer. One day It decides to leave the room, and encounters a world full of 'cute' animals. It responds by crushing the creatures, the only thing <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> doing.|$|E
5|$|Crash {{has been}} voiced by several actors: Brendan O'Brien in Crash Bandicoot, Cortex Strikes Back, Warped, Crash Bash, The Wrath of Cortex, The Huge Adventure, N. Tranced, and Ripto's Rampage; Billy Pope in Crash Team Racing; Steven Blum in Nitro Kart; and Jess Harnell in Tag Team Racing, Crash of the Titans, Mind over Mutant, Skylanders: Imaginators, and N. Sane Trilogy. In the Japanese {{versions}} of the games, he is voiced by Kappei Yamaguchi up to Crash Nitro Kart and by Makoto Ishii in Crash Boom Bang!. In Skylanders Academy, he is voiced by Eric Rogers. Unlike other appearances, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> speaking full sentences with an Australian accent.|$|E
5|$|Federer {{plays with}} a single-handed backhand, which gives him great variety. He employs the slice, {{occasionally}} {{using it to}} lure his opponent to the net and deliver a passing shot. Federer can also fire topspin winners and possesses a 'flick' backhand with which he can generate pace with his wrist; this is usually used to pass the opponent at the net. His serve is difficult to read because he always uses a similar ball toss, regardless of what type of serve {{he is going to}} hit and where he aims to hit it, and turns his back to his opponents during his motion. He is often able to produce big serves on key points during a match. His first serve is typically around 200km/h (125mph); however, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> serving at 220km/h (137mph). Federer is also accomplished at serve and volleying, and employed this tactic frequently in his early career.|$|E

5|$|Giovinco is a small, quick, {{technically}} gifted, and agile player, with noted dribbling skills, balance, acceleration, {{and excellent}} ball control; these characteristics {{allow him to}} beat opponents, hold up the ball {{with his back to}} goal or in tight spaces, and create space or chances for teammates, despite his lack of strong physical attributes. Although <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> scoring goals, he also possesses good link-up play as well as notable playmaking skills, and he is known for his vision, creativity, and his passing and striking ability with both feet, despite being naturally right footed, as well as his accuracy and ball delivery from free kicks. Giovinco is capable of playing in several offensive positions, and he is usually deployed in a free role as a second striker, although he is also capable of playing as a winger, on either flank, or in the centre as a creative attacking midfielder; he has also been used in a more offensive, central role as a main striker.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a mysteriously ill Jordan {{continues}} {{to ask about}} Helen's whereabouts, and her remarks about Helen's conditions lead Black to believe she is starting to experience the seemingly-psychic visions <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> seeing, which allow {{him to see the}} evil people are capable of. Elsewhere, Green is arrested. His property is searched but Helen is nowhere to be foundâ€”although another corpse is dug up in the garden, evidently killed nine years before. Black deduces that Green could not have killed Helen at the cabin as his house was already being watched by the police. He sees a set of tools in Green's home which he realizes were not used for murder or torture, but to immure Helen in the basement. Black and the police dismantle a newly finished plaster wall, finding Helen injured but alive; it is at this point that Black realizes Green was simply a pawn, used by his father to lure victims to the house.|$|E
5|$|Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) {{invites the}} {{regional}} branch managers and Dunder Mifflin Scranton Human Resources representative Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) to a corporate wilderness retreat, {{but does not}} invite Michael Scott (Carell). To show that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> surviving in the wilderness, Michael leaves Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) {{in charge of the}} office and instructs Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) to abandon him deep in the forest with merely a knife and a roll of duct tape. Contrary to Michael's wishes, Dwight stays behind and surreptitiously monitors his condition from a distance. Michael proves to be completely incapable of living out in the wild by himself. Dwight is forced to come out of hiding to save Michael when he tries to eat wild mushrooms.|$|E

5|$|A German mutant with {{a strong}} Catholic faith and the {{appearance}} of a blue demon. Nightcrawler was used by Stryker in an assassination attempt on the President of the United States and gives help to the X-Men. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> teleporting himself (and others) instantly from one location to another. Nightcrawler can teleport through walls, but prefers to only teleport when he can see his landing site. On his body are many scarification marks, one for every sin. Cumming had always been Singer's choice for the role, but at first he was not available due to scheduling conflicts. At some point, Ethan Embry had been reported to be in contention for the role. Ultimately, the film remained in development long enough for Cumming to accept the part. Singer also felt comfortable in casting him since he speaks German fluently. The drawings of Adam Kubert were used as inspiration for Nightcrawler's makeup design, which took four hours to apply. For the scene where Nightcrawler has his shirt off, Cumming went through nine hours of makeup. To best pose as Nightcrawler, Cumming studied comic books and illustrations of the character.|$|E
5|$|Agile, quick, creative, and powerful, Balotelli is {{credited}} with pace, flair, physical strength, technical ability, and an eye for goal; his height, elevation and physique allow him to excel in the air, and <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> scoring with his head or with either foot, from both inside or outside the area. Although he normally plays in a central role as a main striker, he is a versatile forward, who is capable of playing anywhere along the front line, and has also been deployed as a winger or as a second striker. Despite his talent, however, he has been criticized by managers, teammates, and the media for a perceived poor and immature attitude at times, {{as well as his}} for his poor movement and work-rate, inconsistency, mentality, and volatile temperament and arrogant behaviour on the pitch, which has often led him to pick up unnecessary bookings throughout his career. Balotelli has also been accused of diving, and is thus regarded by teammates and the media as a promising but undisciplined player. Due to his powerful shot, Balotelli is also a set-piece specialist, and is {{regarded as one of the}} best penalty kick takers in world football, a view backed by his former Manchester City goalkeeping teammate Joe Hart. Balotelli missed his first competitive penalty against Napoli on 22 September 2013 when it was saved by Pepe Reina; the first time in 22 attempts as a professional.|$|E
5|$|Tactically, Messi {{plays in}} a free attacking role; a {{versatile}} player, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> attacking on either wing or through {{the centre of the}} pitch. His favoured position in childhood was the playmaker behind two strikers, known as the enganche in Argentine football, but he began his career in Spain as a left-winger or left-sided forward. Upon his first-team debut, he was moved onto the right wing by manager Frank Rijkaard; from this position, he could more easily cut through the defence {{into the middle of the}} pitch and curl shots on goal with his left foot, rather than predominantly cross balls for teammates. Under Guardiola and subsequent managers, he most often played in a false nine role; positioned as a centre-forward or lone striker, he would roam the centre, often moving deep into midfield and drawing defenders with him, in order to create and exploit spaces for passes, dribbling runs or combinations with Xavi and Iniesta. Under the stewardship of Luis Enrique, Messi returned to playing in the right-sided position that characterised much of his early career, while also being deployed in a deeper, free role. With the Argentina national team, Messi has similarly played anywhere along the frontline; under various managers, he has been employed on the right wing, as a false nine, or in a deeper, creative role as a classic number 10 or attacking midfielder.|$|E

50|$|Roberto Mussi (born 25 August 1963) is {{a former}} Italian footballer, who played as a defender; a {{versatile}} player, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> playing both as a centre-back or right-back. Due to his dynamism, tenacity, work-rate, and technique, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> helping his team both offensively and defensively as a fullback on the flank. At international level, he represented Italy at the 1994 FIFA World Cup, where they reached the final, and at UEFA Euro 1996. Following his retirement, {{he worked as a}} manager.|$|R
25|$|At {{the same}} time, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> moments of genuine warmth. In The Ark in Space, he salutes the human race's indomitability, and later stories {{establish}} that Earth is his favourite planet (The Stones of Blood). He {{is the first}} Doctor to refer to his companions as his best friends.|$|E
25|$|An airbender who {{disappeared}} from public sight {{a hundred years}} ago. While chronologically one hundred and thirteen years old, Aang still retains his biological age of twelve. He is the latest incarnation of the Avatar Spirit. Though <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> bending all four elements, {{at the beginning of}} the film he has only learned to airbend.|$|E
25|$|The {{function}} of the bloodâ€“testis barrier (red highlight in diagram above) may be to prevent an auto-immune reaction. Mature sperm (and their antigens) arise long after immune tolerance is established in infancy. Therefore, since sperm are antigenically different from self tissue, a male animal can react immunologically to his own sperm. In fact, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> making antibodies against them.|$|E

25|$|In the Super Smash Bros. series, Toad {{is shown}} to emit spores like a real {{mushroom}} whenever he is attacked, as shown when Peach uses her standard special move. However, this has never {{been seen in the}} main Mario series games. Toad exhibits a similar technique in Mario Sports Mix where <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> using the spores to cause mushrooms to sprout from the ground, and his special move is also based on this skill. He is also capable of using these emitted spores as a shield against various attacks in this game.|$|E
25|$|Doom also {{possesses}} originally minor mystical capabilities due to teachings from Tibetan monks, {{but later}} increased {{them to a}} considerable extent due to tutoring from his lover Morgan Le Fay. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> energy projection, creating protective shields, and summoning hordes of demonic creatures. Even {{at a time when}} his abilities were consistently referred to as minor, with assistance from his technology and by tag-teaming with Doctor Strange, Doom managed to come in second in a magic tournament held by the ancient sorcerer the Aged Genghis. After Strange relinquished the title of Sorcerer Supreme, he admitted that Doom had enough magical ability that he might become the new Sorcerer Supreme.|$|E
25|$|Strangely, he {{has become}} more and more akin to HYV of the seeds he sells. Like them, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> high-yielding {{varieties}} of phrase and word. At a Gandhi seminar, he will speak of the relevance of Gandhi. At a meeting in Madras on the necessity of combine harvesters. At another meeting on appropriate technology, he will plump for organic manures. At a talk in London, he will speak on the necessity of chemical fertilizers. He will label slum dwellers â€˜ecological refugeesâ€™, and advertise his career as a quest for â€˜imparting an ecological basis to productivity improvement.â€™ This, after presiding over, and indiscriminately furthering, one of the ecologically most devastating technologies of modern times â€“ the HYV package of the Green revolution.|$|E

25|$|In {{the third}} part, Price {{is forced to}} be {{inactive}} again, to see if Crawford is worthy of her or not; at the same time, Price knows she can best serve the Bertrams by refusing to marry Crawford despite their pressure on her to give in. When Price does become active again when she loses interest in her needlework to allow her eyes to be locked with Crawfordâ€™s, she nearly loses Edmund who is convinced she does not love him. When Crawford comes to court Price at Portsmouth, despite being impressed {{to a certain extent}} by him, by remaining inactive, she demands of Crawford more perseverance and moral commitment than <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of,</b> which causes the superficial Crawford to soon lose interest in her. And in this way, Price marries Edmund and upholds the values which she cherishes.|$|E
25|$|A {{person of}} no {{capacity}} or limited in {{capacity to make}} juridical acts, who has wrongfully damaged the rights of another, shall be jointly liable with his guardian for any injury arising therefrom if <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> discernment {{at the time of}} committing such an act. If he is incapable of discernment at the time of committing the act, his guardian alone shall be liable for such injury. In the case of the preceding sentence, the guardian is not liable if there is no negligence in his duty of supervision, or if the injury would have been occasioned notwithstanding the exercise of reasonable supervision. If compensation cannot be obtained according to the provisions of the preceding two sentences, the court may, on the application of the injured person, take the financial conditions among the tortfeasors, the guardian and the injured person into consideration, and order the tortfeasors or his guardian to compensate for a part or the whole of the injury.|$|E
25|$|A talented, {{technically}} gifted, hardworking {{and creative}} player, {{with an eye}} for goal, ForlÃ¡n is a quick, clever, complete and versatile forward, with a good positional sense, who is capable of playing anywhere along the front line. He has been deployed as a main striker, as a supporting forward, as an attacking midfielder, and even as a winger, often drifting onto the flank to begin attacking plays. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> scoring with either foot, both from {{inside and outside the}} area, and he is also an accurate set-piece and penalty kick taker. In addition to his accurate finishing, movement, and goalscoring ability, ForlÃ¡n is a skilful player, gifted with good technical ability and ball control, as well as good vision, passing ability, intelligence, and awareness on the ball; these attributes also enable him to be deployed in a more creative role, in which he can play off of other players and drop into deeper positions to link-up the midfield with the attack, making him a capable assist provider. In addition to his footballing skills, ForlÃ¡n has also been praised for his leadership and determination throughout his career.|$|E
