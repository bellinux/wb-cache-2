5|$|From January to October 1890, Morris serialised his novel, News from Nowhere, in Commonweal, {{resulting}} in improved circulation for the paper. In March 1891 {{it was published}} in book form, before being translated into French, Italian, and German by 1898 and becoming a classic among Europe's socialist community. Combining utopian socialism and soft science fiction, the book tells the tale of a contemporary socialist, William Guest, who falls asleep and awakes in the mid-20th century, discovering a future society based on common ownership and democratic control of the means of production. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>society</b> there is no private property, no big cities, no authority, no monetary system, no divorce, no courts, no prisons, and no class systems; it was a depiction of Morris' ideal socialist society.|$|E
5|$|I {{certainly}} don't see gay {{and lesbian}} history starting with Stonewall... and I don't see resistance starting with Stonewall.

Certainly something special happened on that night in 1969, and we've made it more special in our need to have what I call a point of origin... it's more complex than saying that {{it all started with}} Stonewall.|$|E

For him he painted, among others, a large picture {{of the royal family}} of England: in the middle compartment are all the younger branches of the family on a very large canvas, and on one hand above the door a half length of her majesty Queen Caroline; the picture of the king was intended to fill the niche opposite to it, but Mr. Aikman's death happening before it was begun, the place for it is left blank. This picture came into the possession of the Duke of Devonshire, whose father married Lady Mary Boyle, daughter and only child to the Earl of Burlington.|$|E

And thus, activities of modern corporations are the ones which enable corporations to maintain themselves. Modern corporations are social existence and infinite living existence.

2500|$|Radcliffe {{was born}} Ann Ward in Holborn, London, on 9 July 1764. Her father was William Ward (1737–1798), a haberdasher, who moved {{the family to}} Bath to manage a china shop in 1772. Her mother was Ann Oates (1726–1800) of Chesterfield. Radcliffe {{occasionally}} lived with her Uncle, Thomas Bentley, in Chelsea, who was in partnership with a fellow Unitarian, Josiah Wedgwood, maker of the famous Wedgwood china. Sukey, Wedgwood's daughter, also stayed in Chelsea and is Radcliffe's only known childhood companion. Sukey later married Dr Robert Darwin and had a son, Charles Darwin. Although mixing in some distinguished circles, Radcliffe seems to have made little impression <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>society</b> and was described by Wedgwood as [...] "Bentley's shy niece".|$|E

2500|$|Numerous criticisms {{have been}} leveled at Constructivist epistemology. The most common {{one is that}} it either {{explicitly}} advocates or implicitly reduces to relativism. This is because it takes the concept of truth to be a socially [...] "constructed" [...] (and thereby socially relative) one. This leads {{to the charge of}} self-refutation: if what is to be regarded as [...] "true" [...] is relative to a particular social formation, then this very conception of truth must itself be only regarded as being [...] "true" [...] <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>society.</b> In another social formation, it may well be false. If so, then social constructivism itself would be false in that social formation. Further, one could then say that social constructivism could be both true and false simultaneously.|$|E

He is alive in children in classrooms in Harlem, in classrooms in Soweto." [...] Mandela ends the film with a quote from Malcolm X himself, with Malcolm in a film clip saying the last four words.

5000|$|According to {{an article}} in Kodaly Envoy by Lum Chee-Hoo, some time between 1922 and 1931, members of an {{organization}} called the Society for the Preservation of Spirituals collected a version from the South Carolina coast. [...] "Come by Yuh", as they called it, was sung in Gullah, the creole language spoken by the former slaves living on the Sea Islands of South Carolina and Georgia, as well as The Bahamas. It is possible this is the earliest version, if it was collected before 1926.

50|$|The Supreme Court {{concluded}} that, {{given the}} basic {{position of the}} marriage relationship <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>society's</b> hierarchy of values and the concomitant state monopolization of the means for legally dissolving this relationship, due process did prohibit a state from denying, solely because of inability to pay, access to its courts to individuals who sought judicial dissolution of their marriages. Thus, the Court held that a state could not, consistent with the obligations imposed on it by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, pre-empt the right to dissolve this legal relationship without affording all citizens access to the means it had prescribed for doing so.|$|R

[...] In reality, it is local ordinaries, not the Society, that in the document are authorized, if they wish, to delegate jurisdiction to SSPX priests to assist canonically at some marriages.|$|E
2500|$|The {{last step}} is that {{effectively}} capitalist market society develops {{human beings in}} an inverted way. The capitalist economy is not primarily organized for the people, but people are organized for the capitalist economy, to serve others who already have plenty of wealth. In an increasingly complex division of labour offering little job security, there {{is more and more}} external pressure forcing people to act in all kinds of different roles, masking themselves in the process; by this act, they also acquire more and more behavioural and semiotic flexibility, and develop more and more relational skills and connections. The necessity to work and relate in order to survive thus accomplishes the [...] "economic formation of society" [...] at the same time, even if <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>society</b> people lack much control over the social relations in which they must participate. It is just that the whole development occurs in an imbalanced, unequal and uncoordinated way, in which the development of some becomes conditional on the lack of development by others.|$|E
