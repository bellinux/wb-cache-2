25|$|I think no, it {{has been}} too long. If they {{would have made it}} to a million in like 2 months, then they would have had something. They even got {{sponsored}} by that gum factory. I felt like it's three years later, forget it. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> that people signed numerous times on the petition so it is probably only like 150,000 people that actually signed it.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{felt ashamed}} if people watched {{television}} {{and saw what}} was happening in our Dewan. In my heart, <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> that all this happened because there was a live broadcast at that time," [...] said the Prime Minister.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were three}} {{casualties}} {{lying in the}} garden of Government House. You think: What sort of mood {{are they going to be}} in when their [...] are shot up? When we were actually lying down I felt a bit humiliated but <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> apprehensive about what was going to happen next. One of the Argentine officers came along and actually struck one of the guards and told us to stand up. We stood up and he shook my hand and a few other guys' hands and said that we shouldn't lie down, that we should be proud of what we'd done." ...|$|E
5000|$|Two generations gone. Gone in a moment! I {{have felt}} for myself, but <b>I</b> have <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> for the Prince Regent. My Charlotte is {{gone from the}} country—it has lost her. She was a good, she was an admirable woman. None could know my Charlotte as I did know her! It was my study, my duty, to know her character, but it was my delight! ...|$|R
60|$|May 9. Went to the wreck, {{and with}} the crow made way {{into the body of}} the wreck, and felt several casks, and {{loosened}} them with the crow, but could not break them up. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>also</b> a roll of English lead, and could stir it; but it was too heavy to remove.|$|R
60|$|I {{was still}} rather raw over the {{deception}} {{which had been}} practised upon me, but the warmth of Holmes's praise drove my anger from my mind. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>also</b> {{in my heart that}} he was right in what he said and that it was really best for our purpose that I should not have known that he was upon the moor.|$|R
2500|$|.....in Buddhism {{the image}} of the mother as the {{embodiment}} of compassion is used a lot. She'll do anything for the children. As a mother I felt that depth of love and commitment and having somebody who I really would give my own life for—it was very powerful {{to have that kind of}} relationship. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> that I didn't really grow up until I had my children. There were ways that maturity was demanded of me and having children brought forth that maturity. So I wouldn't say my children were an inspiration in the sense of what I thought would have been a spiritual inspiration before I had children. More so I think meeting the challenges of motherhood with what I had learned made my practice very rich.|$|E
2500|$|It was a {{very hard}} {{thing for me to}} do because I liked him but I really felt what he did was awful and that unless I felt myself if I didn’t say something, I’d be a hypocrite. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> that if {{somebody}} who was supportive of him didn’t say something, it would not be good. And so it got a lot of attention. I got a call from Erskine Bowles who was Chief of Staff about three or four days later saying {{that he was going to}} express an opinion which wasn’t universally held at the White House– he thought I helped the president by bursting the boil, that was the metaphor he used. The following Sunday morning, I'm at home and the phone rings, it’s the White House. And it’s now about a week and a couple of days since I made the speech. The president says, it was the president, [...] "I just want you to know that there’s nothing you said in that speech that I don’t agree with. And I want you to know that I’m working on it." [...] And we talked for about forty-five minutes. It was amazing.|$|E
6000|$|I {{admit that}} {{for my part}} <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> rather sick and clung tightly to {{the hand of the}} Glittering Lady. She, however, placed her other hand upon my shoulder, saying in a low voice: ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Initially, I {{wanted to}} be a {{full-time}} model and never thought I could act. As time went by, modelling became not that exciting or enjoyable as posing {{in front of the camera}} became monotonous. <b>Also,</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> my name was not being highlighted. The name gets highlighted only in films. So I wanted to act." [...] —Taapsee talking about how she got into films ...|$|R
60|$|This was well. I felt {{it to be}} so. I {{knew that}} her {{presence}} would have a disturbing influence on my studies, which were by that time nearly completed. <b>I</b> <b>felt,</b> <b>also,</b> that it was madness in me {{to fall in love}} with a girl whom I could not hope to marry for years, even if she were willing to have me at all, which I very much doubted.|$|R
60|$|People {{have said}} {{of me that}} I have never known what fear was. No doubt you have heard them say it. For many years, out of a foolish pride, I have let the saying pass. And yet now, in my old age, I {{can afford to be}} honest. The brave man dares to be frank. It is only the coward who is afraid to make admissions. So I tell you now that <b>I</b> <b>also</b> am human; that <b>I</b> <b>also</b> have <b>felt</b> my skin grow cold, and my hair rise; that I have even known what it was to run away until my limbs could scarce support me. It shocks you to hear it? Well, some day it may comfort you, when your own courage has reached its limits, to know that even Etienne Gerard has known what it was to be afraid. I will tell you now how this {{experience}} befell me, and also how it brought me a wife.|$|R
60|$|My {{surprise}} at hearing my own name correctly given was only equaled by the admiration <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> for my companion's complete and absolute assurance. Mr. Cullen and I exchanged a perfunctory handshake, which left me without {{any change in}} my feelings toward him.|$|E
60|$|I felt hurt. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> {{that if the}} {{interview}} were prolonged I might feel even more hurt. So I left him without a word, and drifted {{over to the other}} end of the car, where I took up a position between a stout lady and the door.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to tell you why," [...] he answered. [...] "Because when Pelham heard you laugh last night he was like a madman. He {{believed}} that it was the voice of Phyllis Poynton. And I--I--when I saw you, <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> that miracles were at hand. Look here!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Fr. Boucher {{wrote about}} the Conversations: [...] "When reading the text, I felt that this very little brother whom Jesus, Mary and Therese guided by the hand, would {{have a role to}} play in the Church and in the world. <b>Also,</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> {{pressured}} not to lose this treasure that passed through my eyes, through my hands and through my heart. I humbly admit that Br. Marcel taught me more about the spiritual life than I taught him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Women!" [...] she retorted, with subdued vehemence. [...] "Yes, I am a woman! Your eyes see that, O Rajah Laut, {{but can you}} see my life? <b>I</b> <b>also</b> have heard--O man of many fights--I {{also have}} heard the voice of fire-arms; <b>I</b> <b>also</b> have <b>felt</b> the rain of young twigs and of leaves cut up by bullets fall down about my head; <b>I</b> <b>also</b> know how to look in silence at angry faces and at strong hands raised high {{grasping}} sharp steel. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> saw men fall dead around me without a cry of fear and of mourning; and I have watched the sleep of weary fugitives, and looked at night shadows full of menace and death with eyes that knew nothing but watchfulness. And," [...] she went on, with a mournful drop in her voice, [...] "I have faced the heartless sea, held on my lap the heads {{of those who died}} raving from thirst, and from their cold hands took the paddle and worked so that those with me did not know that one man more was dead. I did all this. What more have you done? That was my life. What has been yours?" ...|$|R
40|$|Liminality is {{the realm}} of {{primitive}} hypothesis, {{where there is a}} certain freedom to juggle with the factors of existence. Victor Turner (1987, p. 15) Dad, you were always a myth of a man, even when you were alive [...] I use myth in a way different from how the term is com-monly used today. I use the word to juggle with the factors of my existence while juggling with the factors of existence writ large. My own embodied sense of liminality—of betweenness—frees me up to overgeneralize and over-specify at the same time. I’ve been in-between for fifteen years now—one year longer than I knew my father, who died at age 39. Identifying with Tom Frentz (2008 a, 2008 b), <b>I</b> <b>also</b> have <b>felt</b> like a trickster, ever since my dad’s death. But something is changing in me...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear fellow,' said Eugene, {{sitting on}} his bed, 'I felt that we had bored one another so long, that an {{unbroken}} continuance of those relations must inevitably terminate in our flying to opposite points of the earth. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> that I had committed every crime in the Newgate Calendar. So, for mingled considerations of friendship and felony, I took a walk.' ...|$|E
60|$|I was {{inclined}} to agree with Harry, but <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> {{that if it were}} impossible to lessen Colonel Carrington's opposition to myself there was no use making further sacrifices hopelessly. Even his own people had shown signs of revolt, and Grace's long patience appeared exhausted. There are limits beyond which respectful obedience degenerates into weakness, and the ruler of Carrington had reached them.|$|E
60|$|It was hard, no doubt, but I did not pity him; {{secretly}} I {{could only}} feel anger against him {{for refusing to}} enlighten me, while making such a presence of openness; and <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> disgusted with myself for having joined him in his rank repast. But dissimulation was necessary, and so, after conversing a little more on indifferent topics, and thanking him for his hospitality, I left him alone {{to go on with}} his smoky task.|$|E
5000|$|... "Nobody ever apologised to us. We done {{sixteen and}} a half years. What {{happened}} 30 years ago was a disaster. People say 21 people lost their lives that day. What about the six men who went to prison? We lost our lives <b>also.</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> sorry for what happened in Birmingham that night, but people must remember I done sixteen {{and a half}} years in prison for something I did not do." [...] John Walker of the Birmingham Six, reflecting on the Birmingham pub bombings, 2004.|$|R
5000|$|I {{think the}} last couple of years, the company was losing focus on what was going on. I felt we weren't keeping up with technology. <b>Also,</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> we weren't doing enough with young acts and {{building}} a client base like we had done back in the early '80s with acts like The Police, Bon Jovi, Bob Dylan, Bryan Adams, and we weren't really getting on top of the new breed of acts. I was getting frustrated with that and thought I'd like {{to give it a try}} on my own. Michael Chugg ...|$|R
5000|$|In a January 2013 {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, series creator Ryan Murphy spoke about Alfonso Gomez-Rejon's {{direction of the}} episode, [...] "Alfonso also worked a lot with Martin Scorsese so <b>I</b> think it <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> very Departed to me. I loved it. I thought all the choices were so fresh and so original. I loved the progressions of the characters. I really loved and I think the audience will love seeing Lana be that Hitchcock heroine. I thought the production design was brilliant. It was an episode of happy mistakes because {{so many things that}} we wrote and so many locations we wanted weren’t available. Like that mausoleum was a happy accident. It wasn't at all what was written but it was available." ...|$|R
60|$|Ah, Sir, she {{was lovely}} indeed! And {{in my heart}} I not only envied Rochez his good fortune but <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> how entirely unworthy he was of it. Nor did the {{beautiful}} Leah give me the impression of being quite so deeply struck with his charms {{as he would have}} had me believe. Indeed, it struck me during those few minutes that I stood dutifully talking to her duenna that the fair young Jewess cast more than one approving glance in my direction.|$|E
60|$|Little {{by little}} the fierce {{chattering}} of her teeth began to abate as {{the warmth of}} her surroundings stole through her. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>felt,</b> even in this strangely awakening position, {{the influence of the}} quiet; and sleep began to steal over me. Several times I tried to fend it off, but, as I could not make any overt movement without alarming my strange and beautiful companion, I had to yield myself to drowsiness. I was still in such an overwhelming stupor of surprise that I could not even think freely. There was nothing for me but to control myself and wait. Before I could well fix my thoughts I was asleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "He is {{infatuated}} {{about my}} face, or the pose of my head, {{or something of}} that sort," [...] Babbie said bitterly, [...] "or {{he would not have}} endured me so long. I have twice had the wedding postponed, chiefly, I believe, to enrage my natural enemy, his sister, who is as much aggravated by my reluctance to marry him as by his desire to marry me. However, <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> that imprisonment for life was approaching as the day drew near, and I told him that if he did not defer the wedding I should run away. He knows I am capable of it, for twice I ran away from school. If his sister only knew that!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Two {{recurring}} {{cast members}} of Smash, Jesse L. Martin and Daphne Rubin-Vega, {{were also in}} the original cast of Rent. Joshua Safran, who was associated with Rent through his ex-boyfriend Anthony Rapp, consulted with both actors {{to be sure they}} felt that the story was appropriate and not exploitative. [...] "If Daphne or Jesse had said, 'We feel like this story is in poor taste,' or, 'We don’t think you should do this story,' we’d pulled the plug on it ... <b>Also,</b> because <b>I</b> know them from back in the day — I lived with them ... <b>I</b> think they <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> like <b>I</b> had a connection to that history, and what I was doing was writing my life, in a way." ...|$|R
60|$|His {{disappointment}} was patent. It was {{his desire}} to understand all things that white men understand, and here, in this matter, he failed. <b>I</b> <b>felt,</b> <b>also,</b> that there was challenge in his attitude. He was bent upon compelling me to show him the wisdom of pictures. Besides, he had remarkable powers of visualization. I had long since learned this. He visualized everything. He saw life in pictures, felt life in pictures, generalized life in pictures; and yet {{he did not understand}} pictures when seen through other men's eyes and expressed by those men with color and line upon canvas.|$|R
60|$|By {{very slow}} degrees, and with {{frequent}} relapses that alarmed and grieved my friend, I recovered. I {{remember the first}} time I became capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window. It was a divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my convalescence. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>also</b> sentiments of joy and affection revive in my bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time I became as cheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion.|$|R
60|$|Well, {{that was}} {{something}} by way of reward for a life-long devotion. I felt that I was satisfied with my position as unofficial advisor-in-chief to Sara and self-appointed guardian of Betty. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> that, for the furtherance of the cause I had taken to heart, {{it was a good}} thing that Sara had again refused to marry me. I had a sixth sense which informed me that a staid old family friend might succeed with Betty where a stepfather would have signally failed. Betty's loyalty to her father's memory was passionate, and vehement; she would view his supplanter with resentment and distrust; but his old familiar comrade was a person to be taken to her heart.|$|E
6000|$|... [2] Since this {{conversation}} I {{have had a}} letter from another well-authenticated psychic, a man making his living by honest labor as a carpenter, who gives very definitely his experience on emitting an etheric double. He says: [...] "One evening, while sitting at the table, I began {{to feel as if}} I were swelling up. My thumb felt as big as my arm, and my arm as big as my leg. While I was perfectly aware that I was at the dinner-table, <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> myself in the hall trying to enter the dining-room. I found the knob, I opened the door. The others saw me traverse the room toward myself. My dual body came close beside me and vanished with a snap." ...|$|E
60|$|As I walked away, I {{was full}} of thoughtfulness; what had been {{incidentally}} revealed to me of Captain Ahab, filled me with a certain wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him. And somehow, at the time, I felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him, but for I don't know what, unless it was the cruel loss of his leg. And yet <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>felt</b> a strange awe of him; but that sort of awe, which I cannot at all describe, was not exactly awe; I {{do not know what}} it was. But I felt it; and it did not disincline me towards him; though I felt impatience at what seemed like mystery in him, so imperfectly as he was known to me then. However, my thoughts were at length carried in other directions, so that for the present dark Ahab slipped my mind.|$|E
6000|$|... 261. At another time, though {{just before}} I was pretty well and savoury in my spirit, yet {{suddenly}} there fell upon {{me a great}} cloud of darkness, which did so hide from me the things of God and Christ, that I was as if I had never seen or known them in my life: <b>I</b> was <b>also</b> so over-run in my soul with a senseless heartless frame of spirit, that I could not feel my soul to move or stir after grace and life by Christ; I was as if my loins were broken, or as if my hands and feet had been tied or bound with chains. At this time <b>also</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> some weakness to seize upon my outward man, which made still the other affliction the more heavy and uncomfortable to me.|$|R
60|$|And as I {{watched him}} I felt {{in my own}} being, in my very muscles themselves, the surge and thrill of desire to go leaping from bough to bough; and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>also</b> the {{guarantee}} of the latent power in that being and in those muscles of mine. And why not? Little boys watch their fathers swing axes and fell trees, and feel in themselves that some day they, too, will swing axes and fell trees. And so with me. The life that was in me was constituted to do what my father did, and it whispered to me secretly and ambitiously of aerial paths and forest flights.|$|R
60|$|But {{this was}} not to be all. I recollected the {{handcuffs}} in his state-room, which he preferred to use on sailors instead of the ancient and clumsy ship irons. So, when we left him, he lay handcuffed hand and foot. For {{the first time in many}} days I breathed freely. I felt strangely light as I came on deck, as though a weight had been lifted off my shoulders. <b>I</b> <b>felt,</b> <b>also,</b> that Maud and I had drawn more closely together. And I wondered if she, too, felt it, as we walked along the deck side by side to where the stalled foremast hung in the shears.|$|R
