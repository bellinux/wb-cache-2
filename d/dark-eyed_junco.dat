5|$|Of the 127 {{bird species}} found along the Merced River, only 35 occur {{along the entire}} length of the river. Many of these birds are migratory and only pass the area a few times every year, while 109 species of birds are found only in the {{breeding}} season. Birds are more abundant along the slow-moving lower river, which has more suitable riparian habitat compared to the rocky, swift upper river. Common species of bird throughout the basin include ruby-crowned kinglet, cedar waxwing, American robin, yellow-rumped warbler, tree swallow and European starling, and several endangered species, including white-tailed kite and Swainson's hawk. Birds that occur commonly in the middle and upper sections of the Merced River include mourning dove, Cassin's finch, California quail, <b>dark-eyed</b> <b>junco,</b> woodpecker, dipper, great blue heron, scrub jay, red-winged blackbird, red-tailed hawk, turkey vulture, cliff swallow, canyon wren, merganser, and bald eagles.

500|$|The typical {{image of}} {{migration}} is of northern landbirds, such as swallows (Hirundinidae) and birds of prey, making long flights to the tropics. However, many Holarctic wildfowl and finch (Fringillidae) species {{winter in the}} North Temperate Zone, in regions with milder winters than their summer breeding grounds. For example, the pink-footed goose migrates from Iceland to Britain and neighbouring countries, whilst the <b>dark-eyed</b> <b>junco</b> migrates from subarctic and arctic climates to the contiguous United States and the American goldfinch [...] from taiga to wintering grounds extending from the American South northwestward to Western Oregon. Migratory routes and wintering grounds are traditional and learned by young during their first migration with their parents. [...] Some ducks, such as the garganey Anas querquedula, move completely or partially into the tropics. The European pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca also follows this migratory trend, breeding in Asia and Europe and wintering in Africa.|$|E
500|$|Ricketts Glen State Park has {{extensive}} acreage of [...] "interior forest" [...] that is {{far from}} open space; several bird species that are area-sensitive are found within these forests in the park, including the black-throated green warbler, red-eyed vireo, <b>dark-eyed</b> <b>junco</b> and black-capped chickadee. Two species of owl, barred and northern saw-whet, inhabit the deep forests.

40|$|The {{abundance}} and habitat associations of overwintering birds in Platte River Valley of central Nebraska may influence their long-term survival. I observed {{a total of}} 51 species {{over a three-year period}} in shrub-grassland, forest, grassland, and cropland habitats during the winter. Grassland habitats had the lowest abundance of wintering birds, while abundances in shrub-grassland, forest, and cropland habitats were higher and similar. Species richness was highest in forests (x= 2. 97 species) and lowest in grasslands (x = 0. 73 species) and croplands (x = 0. 57 species). Overall, horned larks (Eremophila alpestris), American tree sparrows (Spizella arborea), black-capped chickadees (Parus atricapillus), <b>dark-eyed</b> <b>juncos</b> (Junco hyemalis), western meadowlarks (Sturnella neglects), and red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) were the most abundant wintering birds in the Platte River Valley.

40|$|An {{earlier study}} of {{free-living}} male <b>dark-eyed</b> <b>juncos</b> found {{an increase in}} plasma corticosterone (B) in re-sponse to experimental elevation of plasma testosterone (T) (E. D. Ketterson et al., 1991, Horm. Behav. 25, 489 – 503). To investigate whether the increase was caused by enhanced secretion of corticosterone or by a slower clearance rate, or both, we exposed 52 captive yearling male <b>dark-eyed</b> <b>juncos</b> (Junco hyemalis) to day lengths corresponding to those of spring and implanted them {{with one or two}} testosterone-filled or sham implants (10 T-I, 22 T-II, and 20 C-males). We then examined the effect of experimentally elevated testosterone on plasma corticosterone and on corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), as measured by the ability of steroid-stripped plasma to bind labeled corticosterone. Plasma samples were taken five times, 2 weeks before experimental prolongation of day length and approximately every 3 weeks thereafter. Treatment with testosterone increased both plasma testosterone and plasma corticosterone two to three times above control levels, and the degree of elevation was dose-dependent. Only when all treatment groups were pooled, however, were plasma testosterone and corticosterone significantly correlated. The relation-ship between plasma corticosterone and time required to bleed the birds was similar for all three treatment groups, suggesting that there was no effect of treatment on the stress response. Testosterone significantly in-creased the capacity of the plasma to bind corticosterone, presumably because it contained more CBG, when com-pared to the plasma of controls. However, treatment with testosterone did not affect the affinity of the plasma for corticosterone. It seems likely that exogenous testoster-one elevated corticosterone by slowing the corticoste-rone clearance rate via an increase in CBG. It is not clear what the net effect of chronic elevation of testosterone would be on the availability of corticosterone to targe...|$|R

50|$|To a female, {{multiple}} mating {{means an}} increase {{number of young}} that a female can produce, often times this also means an increase number of young {{they have to take}} care of.

In <b>dark-eyed</b> <b>juncos,</b> dunnocks, and Galapagos hawks, mating with multiple males increases the amount of care a female can gain for her offspring. Often times multiple mates allow females to have more sired offspring and the paternity of the offspring typically falls outside of the biological parents—meaning a different male may look after another male's offspring.|$|R
