25|$|Denmark was a {{founding}} member of European Free Trade Association (EFTA). During the 1960s, the <b>EFTA</b> <b>countries</b> were {{often referred to as the}} Outer Seven, as opposed to the Inner Six of what was then the European Economic Community (EEC). In 1973, along with Britain and Ireland, Denmark joined the European Economic Community (now the European Union) after a public referendum. The Maastricht Treaty, which involved further European integration, was rejected by the Danish people in 1992; it was only accepted after a second referendum in 1993, which provided for four opt-outs from policies. The Danes rejected the euro as the national currency in a referendum in 2000. Greenland gained home rule in 1979 and was awarded self-determination in 2009. Neither the Faroe Islands nor Greenland are members of the European Union, the Faroese having declined membership of the EEC in 1973 and Greenland in 1986, in both cases because of fisheries policies.|$|E

50|$|Up to {{the early}} 1990s, however, {{mobility}} in VET - and in particular in initial VET and for young workers - was very limited and certainly not a realistic proposition except for a very small minority {{of the total population}} engaged in VET. Mobility took a quantum leap upwards on the agenda of European and national VET-policies more or less precisely a decade ago, notably with the introduction of the enlarged Petra programme (Petra II) in 1992. That year, 8500 placements were grant-aided through the programme, {{and by the end of}} the programme period in 1995, the total number approached 35 000 for the then 12 EU Member States. A significant development at national level was the establishment by the Danish government in 1992 of the PIU programme, which gave people in initial vocational training not just the opportunity but the right to undertake all or part of their mandatory work placements in another EU or <b>EFTA</b> <b>country.</b> Funding was provided by Danish employers through the Employers’ reimbursement scheme for apprentices and trainees (AER). This was the first of several national programmes for placements abroad that have since been set up in various countries.|$|R

In the first two months of 1991, manufacturing output surpassed last year's level by 5 percent, with the production of investment and consumer goods recording the highest gains.
