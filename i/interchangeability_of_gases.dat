50|$|The Wobbe Index (WI) or Wobbe {{number is}} an {{indicator}} <b>of</b> the <b>interchangeability</b> <b>of</b> fuel <b>gases</b> such as natural gas, {{liquefied petroleum gas}} (LPG), and town gas and is frequently defined in the specifications <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> supply and transport utilities.|$|R
40|$|The burning {{characteristics}} <b>of</b> natural <b>gas</b> and {{the determination}} of its inter-changeability with liquefied petroleum gas on domestic burners are presented in this paper. Earlier studies had sought the correlation of heating values with specific gravities {{as a basis for}} determining the <b>interchangeability</b> <b>of</b> the <b>gas.</b> In this study, it is established that, additionally burning characteristics, which depend on chemical composition, must also be included to accurately predict the range <b>of</b> <b>interchangeability</b> achievable in a given situation. The Wobbe Number, combustion potential and yellow tip index are calculated for both liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and various compositions representative of associated low-pressure and non-association high pressure natural gas. These were then graphically presented as area enclosed by lines representing limits of flash back, lifting and incomplete combustion. It is found that natural gas can be interchanged with LPG as substitute gas for domestic burners, without adjustment of the burner nozzle. The necessary condition for this is that the quality of combustion for the associated natural gas is enhanced when it is fed into the burner above the hydrocarbon and water dew points <b>of</b> the <b>gas,</b> and at twice the pressure at which bottled liquefied petroleum gas is usually supplied to the burners...|$|R
40|$|The global {{increase}} in natural gas (NG) consumption and its steady decline in availability have spurred {{the search for}} new or alternative energy sources, such as pyrolysis gases. This article examines whether {{it is possible to}} burn pyrolysis gases from common plastic wastes in conventional burners without any adjustment to burner design. To determine the <b>interchangeability</b> <b>of</b> individual <b>gases,</b> several multiindex methods applicable to combustion devices in Europe, the USA, and the UK were used. This report is a continuation of a previous article (Part I) discussing the results of graphical methods for determining interchangeability. Similar to Part I, the results here imply that poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) gases produced at a minimum of 700 C have the highest replacement potential, and gases produced by polystyrene (PS) pyrolysis at 900 C also conform with replacement requirements. For plastics mixtures, gases generated by pyrolysis at a minimum of 700 C would be suitable alternatives to NG. These findings may contribute to plastic waste reduction as well as the discussion of reducing NG consumption. There is significant potential for follow-up research in this area, because the replacement of conventional fuels with gases obtained from wastes has not yet been sufficiently explored.

40|$|<b>Interchangeability</b> <b>of</b> drug {{products}} {{has very}} different features with small molecules and with biologicals. With small-molecule drugs, {{a statement of}} bioequivalence generally indicates therapeutic equivalence and interchangeability. In contrast, with the much more sensitive and complicated biological drugs, a declaration of biosimilarity emphatically {{does not imply that}} a patient could be switched from one product to another. Both formulations may be prescribed and administered to subjects who have not received yet the drug in any of its forms. However, regulatory agencies have been very cautious about enabling and permitting interchangeability. Notably, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of the USA sets very formidable and severe conditions for enabling the <b>interchangeability</b> <b>of</b> biological drug products.

The third study found that about two-thirds of the organizations in the sample agreed that the <b>interchangeability</b> <b>of</b> tasks occurred, but the data indicated that it was limited to about 12 % of tasks, not dissimilar to the estimates from the case studies.

2500|$|The {{industrial}} revolution was facilitated by two elements: <b>interchangeability</b> <b>of</b> parts and division of labor. Division of labor {{has always been}} a feature from the beginning of civilization, {{the extent to which the}} division is carried out varied considerably depending on period and location. Compared to the Middle Ages, the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery were characterized by a greater specialization in labor, one of the characteristics of growing European cities and trade. It was in the late eighteenth century that Eli Whitney popularized the concept <b>of</b> <b>interchangeability</b> <b>of</b> parts when he manufactured 10,000 muskets. Up to this point in the history of manufacturing, each product (e.g. each gun) was considered a special order, meaning that parts of a given gun were fitted only for that particular gun and could not be used in other guns. [...] <b>Interchangeability</b> <b>of</b> parts allowed the mass production of parts independent of the final products in which they would be used.|$|R

40|$|Natural gas {{interchangeability}} {{is the key}} {{subject in}} the industry today and most recently Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) {{has emerged as a}} major source and differs substantially from domestically produced gas. Interchangeability means the characteristics of a design that allow direct placement of one item without requiring any modification. This research was a challenge, as it is difficult to find the suitable equipment and available equipment in the lab is limited to a lab scale only as the objective is to investigate to what degree LNG in its gaseous form is interchangeable and to show Wobbe Index (WI) is a measure <b>of</b> the fuel <b>interchangeability.</b> From the research that has been conducted, the key parameters used to investigate the <b>interchangeability</b> <b>of</b> a fuel <b>gas</b> WI, Calorific Value (CV), Air Fuel Ratio (A/F) and CARI (Combustion Air Requirement). This research is conducted by experiment, studying the methane as LNG and LPG (at different composition) using Boys calorimeter to find the CV and WI. Then, the Flame Propagation and Stability Unit are used to measure each fuel gases A/F and CARI index. As expected, the result showed that LNG has higher WI value that is 304. 787 Btu/Ft 3 when compared to LPG with the value of 238. 08 Btu/Ft 3, followed with Propane with the value 228. 51 Btu/Ft 3 and Butane with the value of WI 210. 816 Btu/Ft 3. As a conclusion, LNG has much better characteristics in interchangeability factor and higher heating value meaning higher Wobbe Index which is better performance in terms <b>of</b> <b>interchangeability</b> when compared to other fuel. It is safe to say LNG provides higher energy to the burner and provides much efficient as well as safer combustion process. The accuracy and the efficiency of this research could be improved by using a metered or digitalizing the Boy’s Calorimeter and well as customizing the flame properties for the flame propagation and stability unit at a constant flame color and rate...|$|R
