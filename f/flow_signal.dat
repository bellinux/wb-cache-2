The oxygenation level dependent signal, known now as BOLD, {{has become the most}} popular because of its greater overall contrast/noise, but Kwong showed also that MRI could be used to detect a blood <b>flow</b> <b>signal</b> through the apparent change in T1 relaxation rates associated with the replenishment of blood in brain tissue, and demonstrated how the measured signal changes could be used to directly infer a quantitative measurement of the change in brain perfusion. This forms the basis of a second set of modern methods known now as arterial spin labeling, increasingly used when quantification of baseline and changing physiology is required. Kwongs was clearly the first work in this field to apply these methods to human brain mapping.|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo {{test the}} value of {{acceleration}} <b>flow</b> <b>signals</b> proximal to the leaking orifice in assessing the severity of prosthetic mitral valve regurgitation, 39 consecutive patients undergoing left ventriculography were examined by Doppler color flow imaging. Acceleration row signals proximal to the regurgitant orifice were detected in 27 or the 31 patients who had prosthetic mitral regurgitation by left ventriculography (sensitivity 87 %). All four patients without acceleration <b>flow</b> <b>signals</b> had mild prosthetic mitral regurgitation by angiography. No acceleration <b>flow</b> <b>signals</b> were detected in any patient without prosthetic regurgitation by left ventriculography (specificity 100 %). Individual values of the maximal area of acceleration <b>flow</b> <b>signals</b> obtained from three orthogonal planes in seven patients with mild prosthetic mitral regurgitation by angi ography ranged from 0 to 17 mm 2 (mean 4 ± 6). In 8 patients with moderate prosthetic mitral regurgitation by angiography, the maximal area of acceleration <b>flow</b> <b>signals</b> ranged from 21 to 58 mm 2 (mean 33 ± 15), whereas the maximal area of acceleration <b>flow</b> <b>signals</b> in 16 patients with severe prosthetic regurgitation ranged from 20 to 173 mm 2 (mean 102 ± 41). The maximal area of the acceleration <b>flow</b> <b>signals</b> from three planes correlated well with the angiographic grade of prosthetic mitral regurgitation. There {{was a significant difference}} in the maximal area of acceleration <b>flow</b> <b>signals</b> between mild and moderate (p < 0. 001), moderate and severe (p < 0. 001) and mild and severe (p < 0. 001) prosthetic mitral regurgitation. Thus, measurement of acceleration <b>flow</b> <b>signals</b> by Doppler color flow imaging is useful in assessing the severity of prosthetic mitral regurgitation...|$|R

Although echocardiographic visualization of the septal rupture was obtained in only two of the six patients, unusual Doppler <b>flow</b> <b>signals</b> were detected in the apical portion of the right ventricle in all six patients. Five patients had unusual <b>flow</b> <b>signals</b> during both systole and diastole; one had such signals only during systole.

MethodsA total of 51 hepatic tumors in 32 patients with HCC were treated using a microwave system with a frequency of 2, 450 MHz. Before and after PMAT, color Doppler imaging with a bolus injection of Levovist® (Schering AG, Berlin, Germany), at a dose 5 mL at 400 mg/mL, was performed with an A 128 XP 10 /ART unit (Acuson, Mountain View, CA), with a probe frequency of 3. 5 MHz. ResultsImmediately after PMAT, gray-scale ultrasound imaging of the treated tumor appeared as a hyperechoic area with an acoustic shadow around the electrode. Non-contrast-enhanced color <b>flow</b> <b>signals</b> were detected in all 51 nodules before treatment, while color <b>flow</b> <b>signals</b> disappeared in 49 (96. 1 %) nodules and were still present in two nodules after the treatment. Contrast-enhanced sonography with Levovist® demonstrated only 36 nodules without <b>flow</b> <b>signals</b> and 15 nodules still having <b>flow</b> <b>signals,</b> 30 days after PMAT.

These patients underwent ultrasound examination before operation. The classification of Doppler ultrasound blood <b>flow</b> <b>signals</b> in the focus was recorded. The expression of MMP- 9 and CD 31 in carcinoma tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry, and MVD was calculated.

ResultsThe classification of Doppler ultrasound blood <b>flow</b> <b>signals</b> was as follows: grade 0 (15 cases); grade 1 (20 cases); grade 2 (15 cases); grade 3 (10 cases).

Background. Echo contrast agents are good ultrasound reflectors and could be used as Doppler signal enhancers. Sonicated albumin microbubbles are transpulmonary echo contrast agents and could enhance left heart Doppler signals after peripheral venous injection. Methods. Thirty-one patients with various heart diseases without intracardiac shunts were assessed with Doppler echocardiography before and after injection of sonicated albumin. Results. After an intravenous injection, pulsed Doppler <b>signals</b> of transmitral <b>flow</b> became more intense in all 16 patients examined, although flow velocity itself was not changed. In Doppler color flow imaging, the maximal mitral regurgitant signal area increased from 312 ± 405 mm 2 to 434 ± 465 mm 2, an average increase of 59 ± 40 % in all 17 patients with mitral regurgitation (p < 0. 01). These effects were considered to be due to improvement of signal to noise ratio by the enhancement of Doppler <b>flow</b> <b>signals.</b> The duration of enhancement of pulsed Doppler transmitral <b>flow</b> <b>signals</b> was significantly longer than that of the left ventricular echocardiographic opacification (44 ± 11 s vs. 17 ± 7 s, p < 0. 01).

Uniquely, this study simultaneously tests the signaling and agency abatement motivations as explanations {{of the impact of}} dividend increases on stock prices and bid-ask spreads. The agency abatement hypothesis argues that increased dividends constrict management's future behavior, abating the agency problem with shareholders. The signaling hypothesis asserts that dividend increases signal that managers expect higher or more stable cash flows in the future. Mean stock price responses to dividend increase announcements during 1995 are examined over both short (_ 1, 0) and long (_ 1, 504) windows.

Hence monitoring the changes in the <b>flow</b> <b>signal</b> during ongoing mechanical ventilation would give information about the dynamic mechanics of the respiratory system. Any change in the mechanics of the respiratory system including the endotracheal tube (ETT) and the ventilatory circuit would affect the shape of the <b>flow</b> <b>signal.</b> Knowledge of the airway pressure distal to the ETT at the carina level (= tracheal pressure) is required for calculating the extra resistive load exerted by the endotracheal tube in order to compensate for it. In a porcine model, the <b>flow</b> <b>signal</b> was used to non-invasively calculate tracheal pressure. There was good agreement between calculated and measured tracheal pressure with different modes of ventilation. However, calculation of tracheal pressure assumes that the inner diameter of the ETT is known, and this assumption is not met if the inner diameter is narrowed by secretions. Flow that passes a narrowed tube is decelerated and this is most pronounced with the high flow of early expiration, yielding a typical time constant over expiratory volume pattern that is easy to recognize during mechanical ventilation. This pattern reliably detected partial endotracheal obstruction during volume and pressure controlled mechanical ventilation. A change in compliance of the respiratory system modifies the elastic recoil and this also affects the rate of the expiratory flow and the shape of its signal. In a porcine model, lung volume gains on the <b>flow</b> <b>signal</b> generated by the heartbeats (cardiogenic oscillations) provided information about the compliance of the respiratory system during ongoing mechanical ventilation In conclusion analyzing the <b>flow</b> <b>signal</b> during ongoing ventilation can be a cheap, non-invasive and reliable tool to monitor the elastic and resistive properties of the respiratory system including the endotracheal tube...|$|E
