25|$|The {{hull of the}} Contessa 32 is {{generally}} seen as a cross between older and newer designs. She has the well ballasted keel, low centre of gravity, and narrow beam of traditional English cutters, but has a <b>fin</b> <b>keel</b> characteristic of newer, lighter racing yachts. The narrow beam and substantial ballast provide {{a high degree of}} positive stability, with an AVS of 155Â°, although due to her small size the STIX is only 33. If knocked down or capsized, the Contessa readily rights herself. Because it is shorter than a full-length keel, a <b>fin</b> <b>keel</b> creates less drag. The blending of the keel into the hull forward captures the lateral stability of a full keel, and with the cut away aft portion lends greater responsiveness to the helm. While the skeg bestows additional lateral resistance to the hull aft producing directional stability, its robust design also supports and protects the rudder.|$|E
2500|$|The Contessa 32 is a 9.75 metre (32ft) {{fibreglass}} monohull sailing yacht, {{designed in}} 1970 by David Sadler {{in collaboration with}} yachtbuilder Jeremy Rogers, as a larger alternative to the Contessa 26. With over 750 hulls built, the yacht {{has become the most}} successful one-design cruiser-racer of all time. The yachts have a masthead sloop rig, with a <b>fin</b> <b>keel</b> and a skeg-mounted rudder, a cutting edge concept for the period which now represents a cross between newer and older designs.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>fin</b> <b>keel</b> is of {{cast iron}} with a double resin coating to prevent {{corrosion}} and is of a hydrodynamic design supplying maximum lift with good stability. The keel is mounted to the hull and has a separate moulded keel grid that provides greater strength in this area. The keel is attached with [...] stainless steel flat head bolts, nuts and flat washers. No gasket is used to mount the keel as the mating surfaces are well matched. Keels are mounted at the factory using a silicone marine sealer between the keel and hull.|$|E

2500|$|The C 37/40 is a Canadian [...] {{fibreglass}} monohull sailing yacht, {{designed in}} 1988 by Robert W. Ball of Cuthbertson & Cassian (C Designs) {{as a replacement}} for the earlier C 37 dating from 1981. The yachts have a masthead sloop rig, with a <b>fin</b> <b>keel</b> and a spade-type rudder. The C 37/40 is intended as a cruiser/racer or oceangoing racer (depending on model). First built in 1988, the design is now out of production. Over one hundred of the 37/40 type were built before the Canadian plant closed in 1994.|$|E

2500|$|All of the {{interior}} liners are overlaid and bonded to the hull and deck and the hull to deck joint is bonded with adhesive and then mechanically fastened with stainless steel bolts through the signature C slotted aluminum toerail. The fixed elliptical <b>fin</b> <b>keel</b> has an eight percent foil at the root with reduced chord and an extended trailing edge-hull fillet for interference drag reduction, and an eleven percent foil at the tip to help lower the centre of gravity (VCG). A keel / centreboard combination is an option. The D/L ratio ranges from 206 to 231, depending on model. The opening transom of the + and XL model is simple to operate and transforms to a walk through transom / swim platform including an integral folding ladder providing {{easy access to the}} water. [...] The R version has an open transom.|$|E
60|$|Later on we {{returned}} to Malu, picked up seven recruits, hove up anchor, and started to beat out the treacherous entrance. The wind was chopping about, the current upon the ugly point of reef setting strong. Just as {{we were on the}} verge of clearing it and gaining open sea, the wind broke off four points. The Minota attempted to go about, but missed stays. Two of her anchors had been lost at Tulagi. Her one remaining anchor was let go. Chain was let out to give it a hold on the coral. Her <b>fin</b> <b>keel</b> struck bottom, and her main topmast lurched and shivered as if about to come down upon our heads. She fetched up on the slack of the anchors at the moment a big comber smashed her shoreward. The chain parted. It was our only anchor. The Minota swung around on her heel and drove headlong into the breakers.|$|E
5000|$|When the fin keeled {{and lifting}} keel HEOLs have raced each other, the <b>fin</b> <b>keel</b> {{model has been}} shown to only have a slight edge. In low or no wind conditions, the {{windward}} appendage that is the lifted keel of the twin keel model adds slight drag. In strong wind conditions, the difference is even smaller, and an astute twin keel crew can [...] "take" [...] a <b>fin</b> <b>keel</b> crew if the <b>fin</b> <b>keel</b> crew becomes momentarily lax.|$|E
50|$|Built between 1974 and 1981, the Sadler 25 was {{normally}} rigged as a masthead sloop,and {{was offered}} with {{the option of}} deep or shallow <b>fin</b> <b>keels,</b> twin bilge keels or a centre plate.|$|R

5000|$|A {{bilge keel}} is {{often in a}} [...] "V" [...] shape, welded {{along the length of}} the ship at the turn of the bilge. Although not as {{effective}} as stabilizing <b>fins,</b> bilge <b>keels</b> have a major advantage in their low impact on internal ship arrangements. Unlike <b>fins,</b> bilge <b>keels</b> do not have any components inside the hull that would adversely affect cargo or mission spaces. Like <b>fins,</b> bilge <b>keels</b> have the disadvantage of increasing the hydrodynamic resistance of the vessel, thus hindering forward motion.|$|R

50|$|A keelboat is a {{riverine}} cargo-capable working boat, or a small- to mid-sized recreational sailing yacht. The {{boats in}} the first category have shallow structural keels, and are nearly flat-bottomed and often used leeboards if forced in open water, while modern recreational keelboats have prominent fixed <b>fin</b> <b>keels,</b> and considerable draft. The two terms may draw from cognate words with different final meaning.|$|R

50|$|Once motion {{has been}} established, the motion {{itself can be}} {{controlled}} {{with the use of}} other fins. Boats control direction (yaw) with fin-like rudders, and roll with stabilizer <b>fins</b> and <b>keel</b> <b>fins.</b> Airplanes achieve similar results with small specialised fins that change the shape of their wings and tail fins.|$|R
2500|$|The keel {{surface on}} the bottom of the hull gives the ship greater {{directional}} control and stability. In non-sailing hulls, the keel helps the hull to move forward, rather than slipping to the side. In traditional boat building, this is provided by the structural keel, which projects from the bottom of the hull along most or all of its length. In modern construction, the bar keel or flat-plate keel performs the same function. There are many types of fixed keels, including full <b>keels,</b> long <b>keels,</b> <b>fin</b> <b>keels,</b> winged keels, bulb keels, and bilge keels among other designs. Deep-draft ships will typically have a flat bottom and employ only bilge keels, both to aid directional control and to damp rolling motions ...|$|R
5000|$|Atypically for a New Zealand boat, the Beachcomber was {{designed}} to have either a twin <b>keel</b> or <b>fin</b> configuration. Cabin layout is in two variations - a traditional style coach-house (standard) and a raised deck (flush deck) versions. The first 3 boats had the cabin and deck made from glass over ply the subsequent boats had balsa/GRP sandwich {{the same as the}} hulls [...] Only three, or possibly four, were completed with <b>fin</b> <b>keels.</b> Racing results would tend to suggest that there was little difference in performance between the two configurations.|$|R
