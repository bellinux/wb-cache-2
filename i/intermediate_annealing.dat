Thus the denaturation can occur at the Tc, proceed to primer annealing, and then polymerase-mediated extension. Each round of amplification will include these three stages in that order. By utilizing the lower denaturation temperature, the reaction will discriminate towards the products with the lower Tm - i.e. the variant alleles.

Thin gauge pearlitic steels require at least one <b>intermediate</b> <b>annealing</b> treatment between hot rolling and cold rolling. The globularised cementite in medium carbon steels provides then higher ductility, formability and machinability.

Such a reheating device induces pearlite globularisation after transformation on the run out table, and hence the conventional <b>intermediate</b> <b>annealing</b> treatment presently performed could be avoided.

In the cases of the wires heat-treated at 600 ÂºC for 0. 5 - 2 h, un-reacted Mg and MgB 2 phases coexisted.

The influence of the temperature ramp parameters such as rise/decrease temperature speed and <b>intermediate</b> <b>annealing</b> steps on the dopant activation rate and surface morphology have been investigated. A reduction of the temperature ramp slope reduces the surface roughness by 50 %. Inclusion of a pre-activation annealing step at low temperatures (1300 °C) further reduces the surface roughness.

We also demonstrate that the inclusion of a post-activation annealing at intermediate temperatures (1150 °C) reduces significantly the surface roughness.
