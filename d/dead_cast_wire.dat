40|$|Wire is a {{versatile}} product that offer the highest strength in any material and has therefore been a product form {{that is highly}} valued in engineering alloys. The idea of direct <b>casting</b> <b>wire</b> directly from metallic alloy melt {{has been around for}} long but for many reasons has not progressed to large scale commercialization. The main problem had been the difficulty of maintaining a stable melt stream while melt jet can be quenched and continuously solidified into unbroken wire product. Here, we consider the factors responsible for stabilizing a liquid metallic melt jet and the optimization of these. Experimentation with Fe-Si-B-Cr melts for single and multi-strand is reported. It is demonstrated that high strength metallic glass wires were castable using up to five strands. The role of oxide forming elements in stabilizing and widening the range of process parameters is emphasized. X-ray photon electron spectroscopy (XPS) of direct <b>cast</b> <b>wires</b> showed that stable Cr/Si oxide were formed and the evaluation of experimental cast data suggest that a minimum concentration of oxide former is required to maintain continuity in wire products. Other significant process parameters to be optimized for continuous wire formation in multi-streaming <b>wire</b> <b>casting</b> were, nozzle spacing, nozzle-water clearance, and the cast temperature. The multi-streaming of the <b>wire</b> <b>casting</b> process was achieved using laser drilled nozzles and thus provided a credible path for increasing the throughput in a <b>wire</b> <b>casting</b> process...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Effect of Si {{content of}} Al-Si matrix on roll <b>cast</b> <b>wire</b> {{inserted}} strip {{was investigated in}} this paper. 99. 5 %Al, Al- 4 %Si, Al- 12 %Si and Al- 18 %Si were used as matrix. Slit depth of the nozzle, superheat of melt, wire-diameter and roll speed {{was chosen as the}} casting parameters, too. Addition of the Si was useful to prevent the reaction between the matrix and the wire. A downward melt drag twin roll caster could <b>cast</b> the <b>wire</b> inserted strip of the Al-Si matrix of which Si content was ranging up to 18 %. Composite strip, which matrix was hyper eutectic Al- 18 %Si, could be cast at the speeds up to 20 m/min. The gap between the wire and matrix became thin when the superheat was high. When the slit depth of the nozzle was too shallow, the wire could not be inserted in the strip. The thickness of the wire inserted strip became thinner as the roll speed became higher...|$|R

30|$|The {{expenditure}} on treating distal radius fractures {{is expected}} to rise with the increasing popularity of ORIF of distal radius fractures. Few studies have directly compared the costs of different treatment options of distal radius fractures. Farner et al. [16] showed that open treatment is associated with higher costs and subsequent complications compared with percutaneous fixation in the elderly. Likewise, in their economic evaluation within a RCT, Karantana et al. [17] found no evidence to support the cost-effectiveness, {{from the perspective of the}} National Health Service (NHS), of fixation using a volar locking plate over percutaneous fixation for dorsally displaced distal radial fractures. An economic analysis by Shauver et al. [18] found that although ORIF was the most preferred treatment, it was also the most expensive, compared to <b>casting,</b> <b>wire</b> fixation and external fixation.|$|R
50|$|Andrea {{is portrayed}} by Laurie Holden (The X-Files, The Shield, Silent Hill), who was cast {{as part of}} the series in 2010. Prior to the show, Holden had been in two of Frank Darabont's films, The Majestic (2001) and The Mist (2007); in the latter she starred with three other Walking <b>Dead</b> <b>cast</b> members (Melissa McBride, Juan Gabriel Pareja and Jeffrey DeMunn). Soon after being cast, she read through the comics to analyze and get a {{definite}} understanding of Andrea's character. She acknowledged her enjoyment of having a much more physical role than on some of her other past projects, as well as her excitement towards having her character gradually become a warrior like in the comics.|$|R

5000|$|According to {{researcher}} Marie W. Dallum, in {{her book}} Daddy Grace, Bishop Grace also claimed that {{by the power of}} the Holy Ghost he could raise the dead.

She would accompany Grace in his missionary tours and testify to the fact. This account and others by followers of Bishop Grace and recorded in the United House of Prayer publications were picked up and reported by the outside press.
