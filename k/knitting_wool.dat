40|$|Early {{studies on}} the {{saturated}} felting value of the untreated plain <b>knitted</b> <b>wool</b> fabrics were only confined to a narrow range of yarn linear densities and machine gauges without any generalised conclusion. In this project, the plain <b>knitted</b> <b>wool</b> fabrics produced on commongauge flat-knitting machines were investigated {{in terms of a}} wide range of yarn linear densities, loop lengths, tightness factors, yarn twists and fibre diameters. The knitted fabrics were taken to undergo the IWS 6 x 5 A washing in order to obtain the saturated felting shrinkage. The data obtained after statistical analyses revealed that the saturated felting value of the untreated plain <b>knitted</b> <b>wool</b> fabrics depended upon loop length and tightness factor while the yarn linear density, fibre diameter and yarn twist had no significant effect on the saturated felting value. Further regression analysis also entailed the development of a mathematical model for predicting the saturated felting value of the untreated plain <b>knitted</b> <b>wool</b> fabrics.

40|$|This paper {{intends to}} find out the factors that {{influence}} the overall subjective rating of appearance of <b>knitted</b> <b>wool</b> fabrics after industrial washing. These factors involve fabric handle and physical properties of fabrics. Fifty-three <b>knitted</b> <b>wool</b> samples are washed at different washing parameters with different levels, the washing procedures simulate the industrial washing at factories. Fabric professionals assess washed fabrics subjectively into 7 grades. Change of surface roughness, thickness, dimensions, color, and twisting of washed fabrics are measured objectively by color data reflectance, thickness meter, image analysis, color data L*a*b and skewing. The influencing factors for fabric appearance can be selected. Subjective ratings of fabric appearance of <b>knitted</b> <b>wool</b> fabrics can be compared with objectively evaluated factors to see the individual and multiple correlations.

40|$|Earlier {{studies on}} the {{dimensional}} behaviour and properties of plain <b>knitted</b> <b>wool</b> fabrics were only confined to a narrow range of yarn counts and machine gauges leading to sectional and conflicting experimental results. In this project, plain <b>knitted</b> <b>wool</b> fabrics produced by common-gauge hand flat-knitting machines were investigated for dimensional properties in terms of appropriate yarn linear densities, twist factors and tightness factors. The knitted fabrics were then allowed to undergo the simulated industrial relaxation. The data obtained after statistical analysis revealed the significance {{as well as the}} correlation of loop length, yarn count, tightness factor, machine gauge and twist factor that would affect the linear and area dimensions of the resultant fabrics.

The company's 1791 Hebble Mill was replaced after being destroyed by fire in 1905. Thomas and Henry Harrap developed the business as Messrs Harrap Bros.

5000|$|Boiled wool/felt yardage {{is created}} commercially by first weaving or <b>knitting</b> <b>wool</b> fibers {{resulting}} in a fabric of uniform thickness. The material may either be dyed first or left natural, with or without design and embellishment. It is then [...] "boiled" [...] and agitated in hot water and suds, shrinking the fabric {{without the use of}} chemicals. The result is a tighter and more dense material, usually shrinking anywhere from twenty to fifty percent. Wool that has been boiled/felted is thought to be warmer, more durable, and windproof.|$|E

50|$|China's {{cotton textile}} {{industry}} {{is the largest}} in the world, producing yarn, cloth, woolen piece goods, <b>knitting</b> <b>wool,</b> silk, jute bags, and synthetic fibers.

In addition to garments and textiles, output from light industry includes footwear, toys, food processing, and consumer electronics. Heavy industries include iron and steel, coal, machine building, armaments, petroleum, cement, chemical fertilizers, and autos. High technology industries produce high-speed computers, 600 types of semiconductors, specialized electronic measuring instruments, and telecommunications equipment.|$|E

50|$|Summer designs {{revealed}} in February 1933 marked {{a milestone in}} Borea's designing career. From this point she no longer showed pants, {{with the exception of}} plus fours, which she styled for boating. Her very feminine sports frocks and evening gowns were quite similar, except for theirlengths. The frocks were shorter, sixteen inches off the floor, while the evening gowns were ankle-length. Both possessed accentuated sunburn decolletes, suspended from very small ribbon-threaded metal chains. Borea lowered the waistlines of her creations to the hipbone. Her fashions began to exaggerate fullness in overblouses and the wide, flared, gored skirts she designed. Borea's bathing suits were short and flaring, made fromplain wool or checked cotton. She created taffeta blouses with linen suits. For spring and summer Borea used knitted shoulder yokes. A white suede golf jacket she designed had a knitted white cotton yoke. Her mixed wool motor and travel coats featured <b>knitted</b> <b>wool</b> yokes in very dark tones. Borea's cotton or linen dresses and jackets had yokes with bright contrasts and belts of <b>knitted</b> <b>wool.</b>|$|R
