5|$|After {{the death}} of his first wife, he married on 24 August 1764 to Hedwig von Platen (17386 September 1818). <b>His</b> <b>only</b> <b>son,</b> Friedrich von Zieten (6 October 176529 June 1854), whose baptism Frederick witnessed, was first a captain of hussars and from 18001824 {{councilor}} of Ruppin. In 1840 he was raised to the nobility by Frederick William II of Prussia. He died in 1854, unmarried, and was buried in the local cemetery.|$|E

5|$|Around 1210, Theodore {{was invited}} by his {{half-brother}} Michael I Komnenos Doukas to Epirus, where Michael had founded an independent Greek principality. Michael wanted Theodore's aid, as <b>his</b> <b>only</b> <b>son,</b> the future Michael II Komnenos Doukas, was underage and illegitimate, while Michael's other half-brothers {{were considered to}} lack the ability to rule. Laskaris allowed Theodore to leave, but bound him with an oath of allegiance to himself and his heirs. Before going to Epirus, Theodore had married Maria Petraliphaina, {{with whom he had}} four children.|$|E
5|$|At 80years of age, Buckner memorized five of Shakespeare's plays because {{cataracts}} {{threatened to}} blind him, but an operation saved his sight. On {{a visit to}} the White House in 1904, Buckner asked President Theodore Roosevelt to appoint <b>his</b> <b>only</b> <b>son</b> as a cadet at West Point, and Roosevelt quickly agreed. His son would later serve in the U.S. Army and be killed at the Battle of Okinawa, making him the highest-ranking American to have been killed by enemy fire during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{candidates}} declared their {{candidacy for}} the Democratic nomination, including Rhea and Lieutenant Governor Chandler. Former governor Beckham {{was not a}} candidate; <b>his</b> <b>only</b> <b>son</b> had died in late 1934, devastating his family and leaving his wife strongly opposed to another political campaign. Near {{the end of the}} primary campaign, Laffoon suffered an attack of appendicitis and required an appendectomy, leaving him unable to campaign for Rhea. Two candidates dropped out of the race prior to the election.|$|E
50|$|On his death, he was {{succeeded by}} <b>his</b> <b>only</b> {{surviving}} <b>son,</b> Wolfgang.|$|R
50|$|<b>His</b> <b>only</b> {{surviving}} <b>son,</b> Daniel Parke Custis, was {{the first}} husband of Martha Washington.|$|R
50|$|Born in 1357 in London, England, he was {{the third}} son of <b>his</b> mother and <b>only</b> <b>son</b> of <b>his</b> father. He was heir {{to the office of}} Lord Marshal, Earldom of Norfolk and Barony of Manny. His two other half-brothers had died before being ten years of age; thus, he was <b>his</b> parents' <b>only</b> <b>son.</b>|$|R
5|$|While Adams was {{attending}} the ratifying convention, <b>his</b> <b>only</b> <b>son</b> Samuel Adams, Jr. died at just 37 years of age. The younger Adams {{had served as}} surgeon in the Revolutionary War, but had fallen ill and never fully recovered. The death was a stunning blow to the elder Adams. The younger Adams left his father the certificates that he had earned as a soldier, giving Adams and his wife unexpected financial security in their final years. Investments in land made them relatively wealthy by the mid-1790s, but this did not alter their frugal lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|At age 37, Mary {{turned her}} {{attention}} to finding a husband and producing an heir, which would prevent the Protestant Elizabeth (still next-in-line under the terms of Henry VIII's will and the Act of Succession of 1544) from succeeding to the throne. Edward Courtenay and Reginald Pole were both mentioned as prospective suitors, but her cousin Charles V suggested she marry <b>his</b> <b>only</b> <b>son,</b> Prince Philip of Spain. Philip had a son from a previous marriage and was heir apparent to vast territories in Continental Europe and the New World. As part of the marriage negotiations, a portrait of Philip, by Titian, was sent to her in September 1553.|$|E
5|$|Filitti was {{preparing}} his retirement from public life, and designated <b>his</b> <b>only</b> <b>son</b> Manole as a {{curator of the}} Filitti Archive. Filitti Jr was a lawyer, financier and amateur rugby footballer, who would later serve as manager of the Phoenix Oil Factory. Married to actress Mimi Enăceanu, he was for long based in Iași, sharing a villa with the poet Mihail Codreanu. It was there that Ioan C.'s grandson Ion was born in 1936. His baptism was a public affair involving some of the established aristocratic houses, {{and one of the}} last functions ever attended by Filitti Sr (who met and befriended Codreanu on the occasion).|$|E
50|$|William III {{inherited}} estates at Glantonbury Manor and at Barrington Court {{from his}} father in his native county of Somerset. At the latter he built Strode House (1674). His three marriages were to Elizabeth Rivett (1656), Margaret Osborne (1675) and, thirdly, to Jane Ellys. <b>His</b> <b>only</b> <b>sons</b> were William IV (1675-1746) and Barnard (1695-1782), both by his third wife.|$|R
50|$|The title became extinct on {{the death}} of <b>his</b> <b>only</b> {{surviving}} <b>son,</b> the second Baronet, in 1855.|$|R
50|$|He {{ascended the}} throne in March {{and died in}} June, leaving <b>his</b> <b>only</b> {{surviving}} <b>son,</b> Liutprand, the kingdom.|$|R
5|$|In 1216, when a Scottish army {{invaded the}} Eden valley and Alan of Galloway {{occupied}} Westmorland, Brougham Castle played {{no part in}} the county's defence, probably because it was unfinished. Construction would have been suspended until Alan retreated in 1217. Vieuxpont received control over the king's revenues from Cumberland, and these helped fund {{the construction of the}} castle. Brougham Castle was constructed {{in the northern part of}} the old Roman fort, and stone from the ruins was probably used to help build the castle. When Robert de Vieuxpont died in 1228, <b>his</b> <b>only</b> <b>son</b> John was a minor, so his property was taken into the care of a warden.|$|E
5|$|In 1261, Alexander III, King of Scots (died 1286) sent an {{emissary}} to Norway {{to discuss}} the Isles. Negotiations proved fruitless, and the following year William I, Earl of Ross (died 1274) is recorded to have launched a vicious attack on Skye. The assault was likely carried out on behalf of Alexander, {{in response to the}} failure of Scottish mission to Norway the year previous. In response, Hákon organised a massive military force to re-assert Norwegian control along the western seaboard of Scotland. At this time, the Norwegian king was {{at the height of his}} power, and <b>his</b> <b>only</b> <b>son</b> had just recently been recognised as heir to the throne.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, King Christian VIII of Denmark {{died and}} <b>his</b> <b>only</b> <b>son,</b> Frederick ascended the throne. Frederick was childless, {{had been through}} two {{unsuccessful}} marriages, and {{was assumed to be}} infertile. A succession crisis arose as Frederick ruled in both Denmark and Schleswig-Holstein, and the succession rules of each territory differed. In Holstein, the Salic law prevented inheritance through the female line, whereas no such restrictions applied in Denmark. Holstein, being predominantly German, proclaimed independence and called in the aid of Prussia. In 1852, the great powers called a conference in London to discuss the Danish succession. An uneasy peace was agreed, which included the provision that Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg would be Frederick's heir in all his dominions and the prior claims of others (who included Christian's own mother-in-law, brother-in-law and wife) were surrendered.|$|E
50|$|Lord Belmore died at Bath on 2 February 1802 aged 61 and was {{succeeded by}} <b>his</b> <b>only</b> {{surviving}} <b>son.</b>|$|R
50|$|Emich Carl died at Amorbach on the 4 July 1814 and was {{succeeded by}} <b>his</b> <b>only</b> {{surviving}} <b>son,</b> Carl Friedrich.|$|R
50|$|<b>His</b> <b>only</b> {{remaining}} <b>son,</b> Sir Charles Philip Jennings survived him {{by only a}} few months, whereupon the baronetcy became extinct.|$|R
5|$|Kirill {{suffered}} {{a nervous breakdown}} in 1923 and Victoria nursed him back to health. She encouraged his dreams of restoring the monarchy in Russia and becoming Tsar. At Saint-Briac Kirill, aware of the murders of Tsar Nicholas II and <b>his</b> <b>only</b> <b>son,</b> officially declared himself the Guardian of the Throne in 1924. Victoria went {{on a trip to}} the United States in 1924, hoping to raise American support for restoration of the monarchy. Her efforts evoked little response, due to the isolationism prevalent in the United States during the 1920s. She continued in her efforts to help Kirill restore the monarchy and also sold her artwork {{to raise money for the}} household.|$|E
5|$|Ashmole met the {{botanist}} and collector John Tradescant {{the younger}} around 1650. Tradescant had, with his father, {{built up a}} vast and renowned collection of exotic plants, mineral specimens and other curiosities {{from around the world}} at their house in Lambeth. Ashmole helped Tradescant catalogue his collection in 1652, and, in 1656, he financed the publication of the catalogue, the Musaeum Tradescantianum. In 1659, Tradescant, who had lost <b>his</b> <b>only</b> <b>son</b> seven years earlier, legally deeded his collection to Ashmole. Under the agreement, Ashmole would take possession at Tradescant's death. When Tradescant died in 1662, his widow, Hester, contested the deed, claiming her husband had signed it when drunk without knowing its contents, but the matter was settled in Chancery in Ashmole's favour two years later. Hester was to hold the collection in trust for Ashmole until her death. Ashmole's determined aggressiveness in obtaining the Tradescant collection for himself has led some scholars to consider that Ashmole was an ambitious, ingratiating social climber who stole a hero's legacy for his own glorification.|$|E
5|$|Charles was {{the only}} son of King Charles X Gustav of Sweden and Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp. His father {{died when he was}} five years old, so Charles was educated by his {{governors}} until his coronation at the age of seventeen. Soon after, he was forced out on military expeditions to secure the recently acquired dominions from Danish troops in the Scanian War. Having successfully fought off the Danes, he returned to Stockholm and engaged in correcting the country's neglected political, financial and economic situation, managing to sustain peace during the remaining 20 years of his reign. Changes in finance, commerce, national maritime and land armaments, judicial procedure, church government and education emerged during this period. Charles XI was succeeded by <b>his</b> <b>only</b> <b>son</b> Charles XII, who made use of the well-trained army in battles throughout Europe.|$|E
50|$|Henry finally {{converted}} to Protestantism {{under the influence}} of <b>his</b> <b>only</b> remaining <b>son,</b> Julius, and died in 1568 at Wolfenbüttel.|$|R

50|$|After Viscount Molyneux's {{death at}} Croxteth in 1700 his title passed to <b>his</b> <b>only</b> {{surviving}} <b>son,</b> William Molyneux, 4th Viscount Molyneux.|$|R
5|$|Cibber and Katherine had 12 {{children}} between 1694 and 1713. Six died in infancy, {{and most of}} the surviving children received short shrift in his will. Catherine, the eldest surviving daughter, married Colonel James Brown and seems to have been the dutiful one who looked after Cibber in old age following his wife's death in 1734. She was duly rewarded at his death with most of his estate. His middle daughters, Anne and Elizabeth, went into business. Anne had a shop that sold fine wares and foods, and married John Boultby. Elizabeth had a restaurant near Gray's Inn, and married firstly Dawson Brett, and secondly (after Brett's death) Joseph Marples. <b>His</b> <b>only</b> <b>son</b> to reach adulthood, Theophilus, became an actor at Drury Lane, and was an embarrassment to his father because of his scandalous private life. His other son to survive infancy, James, died in or after 1717 before reaching adulthood. Colley's youngest daughter Charlotte followed in her father's theatrical footsteps, but she fell out with him and her sister Catherine, and she was cut off by the family.|$|E
5|$|El Greco made Toledo his home. Surviving {{contracts}} mention him as {{the tenant}} from 1585 onwards of a complex consisting of three apartments and twenty-four rooms which belonged to the Marquis de Villena. It was in these apartments, which also served as his workshop, that he passed {{the rest of his}} life, painting and studying. He lived in considerable style, sometimes employing musicians to play whilst he dined. It is not confirmed whether he lived with his Spanish female companion, Jerónima de Las Cuevas, whom he probably never married. She was the mother of <b>his</b> <b>only</b> <b>son,</b> Jorge Manuel, born in 1578, who also became a painter, assisted his father, and continued to repeat his compositions for many years after he inherited the studio. In 1604, Jorge Manuel and Alfonsa de los Morales gave birth to El Greco's grandson, Gabriel, who was baptized by Gregorio Angulo, governor of Toledo and a personal friend of the artist.|$|E
5|$|In 1525 Dudley married Guildford's {{daughter}} Jane, who {{was four}} years his junior and his former classmate. The Dudleys belonged to the new evangelical circles of the early 1530s, and their 13 children were educated in Renaissance humanism and science. Sir Edward Guildford died in 1534 without a written will. <b>His</b> <b>only</b> <b>son</b> having predeceased him, Guildford's nephew, John Guildford, asserted that his uncle had intended him to inherit. Dudley and his wife contested this claim. The parties went to court and Dudley, who had secured Thomas Cromwell's patronage, won the case. In 1532 he lent his cousin, John Sutton, 3rd Baron Dudley, over ₤7,000 on {{the security of the}} baronial estate. Lord Dudley was unable to pay off any of his creditors, so when the mortgage was foreclosed in the late 1530s Sir John Dudley came into possession of Dudley Castle.|$|E
50|$|When Bernhard died, was {{succeeded by}} <b>his</b> <b>only</b> {{surviving}} <b>son</b> Johann Wilhelm, born {{of his first}} wife after their reconciliation in 1675.|$|R
