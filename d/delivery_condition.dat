5000|$|When, in 1983, {{it finally}} {{became clear that}} the 79-year-old railbuses on the Stubai Valley Railway (Stubaitalbahn) were to be {{withdrawn}} from service, the Tiroler MuseumsBahnen Society was founded in May of that same year [...] "with the aim of preserving these historically important vehicles for posterity." [...] Although initially the prospect of acquiring suitable premises for the society did not look good, thanks to political supporters, including the then mayor, Nischer, the former locomotive depot and part of the Stubaital station (waiting room and movements office) were able to be acquired and the Localbahn Museum was opened as early as summer 1985. In order to create space for more vehicles, the majority of the trailer cars from the Stubai Valley Railway were sold or rented. For example, an Igler driving trailer, several Igler trailer cars and some goods wagons from the Stubai Valley Railway were added to the collection. In 1989 the first vehicle - goods wagon 32 from the Stubai Valley Railway - was restored to its original state. By the beginning of 2009 another 16 vehicles - some in their original <b>delivery</b> <b>condition</b> - were made operational. In 1991 they celebrated the centenary of the Innsbruck Tramway with the Innsbruck transport companies. Around the turn of the millennium the locomotive shed, which dates to 1903 and had by then become dilapidated, was given a major overhaul. In 2000 they celebrated the centenary of the Innsbruck Mountain Railway was commemorated in Innsbruck and the surrounding area and, in 2004, it was followed by centenary celebrations for the Stubai Valley Railway. In October 2008 the museum railway company itself celebrated its 25th anniversary with the active participation of politicians from the state of Tyrol and the city of Innsbruck.|$|E

This research experiment integrates affective forecasting (AF) research to study whether the delivery of a psychotherapeutic intervention affects participants' level of impact bias, treatment participation, and outcome. Analyses were conducted on data collected from a longitudinal online experiment completed Fall 2013 - Spring 2014 that randomly assigned participants {{to one of three}} conditions: delivery, delivery AF, or control.

40|$|The study {{investigated}} the role of social reinforcement, when teaching two preschoolers with no functional vocal verbal behavior first instances of echoic responses, using rapid motor imitation responding. The dependent variables for the experiment were: (1) echoic tacts (echoics presented under the controlling variables of tacts) and (2) generalized motor imitation responses to the rapid motor imitation antecedent procedure (Ross & Greer, 2003; Tsiouri & Greer, 2003). Three single case reversal experimental designs were implemented, counterbalanced across two conditions: (1) delivery of praise and social reinforcement contingently upon only correct rapid motor imitation and echoic responses and (2) delivery of generalized social interaction on a fixed time schedule without extinction of correct echoic responses. Results showed {{that the number of}} echoics significantly increased during the contingent social reinforcement condition, when compared with the fixed time <b>delivery</b> <b>condition,</b> during which data consistently remained at a lower level, while motor imitation responding remained at high levels during both experimental conditions.

30|$|Besides {{the tests}} with milled products, defined {{fractions}} obtained from sieving milled GAC are investigated. The sieved fractions are then used as filter materials in defined rapid small-scale column tests (RSSCT) {{that are designed}} to comply with the hydraulic dimensioning of large filters used in pilot or full-scale applications. The RSSCT design allows for quick and hydraulically realistic conditions during testing[50, 51]. One drawback of the RSSCT method is that during milling, the external surface of the GAC is increased due to the production of smaller GAC particles (the internal surface which determines the adsorption capacity for OMP is only affected insignificantly)[52]. Effluents from wastewater treatment plants contain effluent organic matter besides natural background organic matter (e.g. humic and fulvic substances). It has been shown that different fractions of the dissolved organic carbon (with regard to size exclusion chromatography and online organic carbon detection) can be removed by adsorption onto powdered activated carbon[53]. Large organic molecules are able to block activated carbon pores and therefore potentially reduce the OMP adsorption capacity. Large molecules therefore might cause more adverse blockage on large GAC particles (with small external surface) compared to small GAC particles (with larger external surface). Thus, blockage by large organic molecules can be more pronounced when using original GAC than when using ground GAC. Therefore, GAC products are also tested in their original <b>delivery</b> <b>condition.</b>|$|E
40|$|Due to the RoHS and WEEE {{legislative}} requirements {{the implementation of}} lead free solder material is of prior significance in electronic manufacturing. As a consequence, many efforts have been started in order to adapt the soldering technology {{as well as to}} provide adequate equipment and materials. While European RoHS regulations currently exempt high Pb solders used as component solders and die attaches for automotive and other high temperature applications, there is a strong drive to find Pb-free alternatives for these high temperature electronic applications, as well. The development of lead-free solder materials with improved reliability properties requires a detailed understanding of the microstructure and thermal behavior. Aluminium-Germanium and Aluminum-Germanium-Copper alloys are described in literature as possible alternative solder materials for high temperature silicon die attach. However, no micro structural or process properties are released. In this study, DSC measurements will be performed to analyze the melting point of the different alloys and the crystallization behaviour. High resolution micro structural analyses will be shown at Al-Ge and Al-Ge-Cu alloys in initial condition and after melting processes.

Additionally the wetting behaviour of the two alloys will be described for different surfaces.

40|$|International audienceRecent neurophysiological {{and brain}} imaging {{studies have shown}} that the motor system is {{involved}} in language processing. However, it is an open question whether this involvement is a necessary requisite to understand language or rather a side effect of distinct cognitive processes underlying it. In order to clarify this issue we carried out three behavioral experiments, using a go-no go paradigm. Italian verbs expressing hand actions, foot actions or an abstract content served as stimuli. Participants used their right hands to respond. In Experiment 1, in which a semantics decision task with an early delivery of the go signal (during processing language material) was used, slower responses were found for hand action-related verbs than for foot action-related verbs. In Experiment 2, using the same task with either an early or a delayed delivery of the go signal (when language material had been already processed), no difference was found between responses to the two verb categories in the delayed <b>delivery</b> <b>condition.</b> In Experiment 3, in which a lexical decision task with an early delivery of the go signal was used, again no difference between the two verb categories was found. The present findings demonstrate that during language processing the modulation of the motor system crucially occurs while performing a semantics decision task, thus supporting the notion that this involvement is a necessary step to understand language rather than a side effect of upstream cognitive processes...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{proportional}} changes in V̇O 2,max with alterations in O 2 delivery, {{it is widely}} held that O 2 availability limits V̇O 2,max. In contrast, reductions in V̇O 2,max are also seen when mitochondrial oxidative capacity is reduced. Taken collectively, these prior {{results are consistent with}} the notion {{that there is not a}} single-step limitation to V̇O 2,max. We used a pump-perfused rat hindlimb model to test the hypothesis that combining moderate reductions in O 2 delivery and mitochondrial oxidative capacity would yield a greater reduction in V̇O 2,max than seen when performing each intervention independently, demonstrating an interaction between O 2 supply and mitochondrial oxidative capacity in determining V̇O 2,max. Four groups of animals were studied: two in high O 2 <b>delivery</b> <b>conditions</b> (hindlimb O 2 delivery: 88 ± 1 μmol O 2 min− 1; mean ± s. e. m.) and two in moderately reduced O 2 <b>delivery</b> <b>conditions</b> (66 ± 2 μmol O 2 min− 1). One group at each level of O 2 delivery was treated with 0. 1 μM myxothiazol to reduce mitochondrial oxidative capacity via competitive inhibition of NADH cytochrome c reductase. V̇O 2,max in control animals (no myxothiazol) was 29 % lower in the moderately reduced O 2 delivery group (592 ± 24 mmol O 2 min− 1 (100 g) − 1); P < 0. 05) than in the high O 2 delivery group (833 ± 63 μmol O 2 min− 1 (100 g) − 1). Similarly, V̇O 2,max was reduced by 29 % (594 ± 22 μmol O 2 min− 1 (100 g) − 1); P < 0. 05) in myxothiazol-treated animals in high O 2 <b>delivery</b> <b>conditions</b> compared to control animals in high O 2 <b>delivery</b> <b>conditions.</b> When myxothiazol treatment was combined with moderately reduced O 2 delivery, V̇O 2,max was reduced by an additional 18 % (484 ± 21 μmol O 2 min− 1 (100 g) − 1); P < 0. 05) compared to either intervention performed independently.

SettingNational Health Service maternity hospitals in Liverpool and Manchester regions. Population 277 women with epilepsy (WWE) and 315 control women. MethodsWWE were recruited from antenatal clinics. Controls were matched for age and parity but not gestational age. Information was obtained by interview and from clinical records. Main outcome measuresObstetric complications, mode of <b>delivery,</b> <b>condition</b> of newborn. ResultsDistribution of epilepsy syndromes was similar to previous surveys. Most WWE (67 %) received monotherapy with carbamazepine, sodium valproate or lamotrigine. Half WWE had no seizures during pregnancy but 34 % had tonic clonic seizures. Seizure-related injuries were infrequent. Pregnancies with obstetric complications were increased in women with treated epilepsy (WWTE 45 %, controls 33 %; p= 0. 01). Most had normal vaginal delivery (WWTE 63 %, controls 61 %; p= 0. 65). Low birth weight was not increased (WWTE 6. 2 %, controls 5. 2 %; p= 0. 69). There were more major congenital malformations (MCM) (WWTE 6. 6 %, controls 2. 1 %; p= 0. 02) and fetal/infant deaths (WWTE 2. 2 %, controls 0. 3 %; p= 0. 09).

The concentration of S 100 B, in colostrums of the first three days from the delivery, was assessed with commercial immunoluminometric assay. The production of colostrums was significantly higher in Burkinabe women, where the colostrums S 100 B levels in the first day of lactation showed to be at 24 h higher than those of Sicilian mothers (672. 21 ± 256. 67 ng/ml vs 309. 36 ± 65. 28 ng/ml) and progressively decreased reaching the values of Sicilian mothers in the second and third day (204. 31 ± 63. 25 ng/ml and 199. 42 ± 45. 28 ng/ml, respectively). Correlation was found between the level of S 100 B and the length of stage II (duration of expulsive phase of delivery), but the correlation with pain was found only in Burkinabe women. The S 100 B level in colostrums of Burkinabe mothers differs from that of Sicilians only in the first day of lactation, and in consideration that Burkinabe women produce more colostrums, their newborns receive, during the first days of life, an higher amount of S 100 B. The elevated quantity of S 100 B ingested by Burkinabe newborn in the first days of life could promote the physiological postnatal brain adaptation and maturation in the precarious <b>delivery</b> <b>condition</b> of African infants. </p...|$|E

40|$|Conference paper (selected oral communication) Dermal {{delivery}} of catechins {{may be an}} effective approach for protection of skin against inflammation, aging and cancer caused by exposure to radiation and environmental toxicants. Catechins are flavonoid-type polyphenols showing capacity to attenuate UV-induced skin injury, carcinogenesis and melanoma metastasis, but the prevalence of beneficial effects depends on compound concentration. In this work, catechin penetration through the skin was simulated to predict the concentration in different layers: stratum corneum, viable epidermis and dermis. By combining these results with expected dose-effect relationships of the compounds, bioactivity profiles were calculated for relevant skin regions. Since the concentration dependences of catechin capacities to protect dermal fibroblasts and to inhibit melanoma cells (data aggregated from published literature) follow different types of dose-effect curves, bioactivity profiles in the skin can be different, even for the same <b>delivery</b> <b>conditions.</b> This method allows to estimate the <b>delivery</b> <b>conditions</b> (time and concentrations) required to achieve the desired biological/pharmacological activities at critical skin strata, namely, viable epidermis and dermis where metastatic melanoma cells and susceptible fibroblasts localize.
