5|$|The only grave {{goods were}} a pot found {{with the female}} adult body and partial remains of wicker, fur and linen with the other bodies. In the predynastic period bodies were usually buried naked and {{sometimes}} loosely wrapped. In such a burial, when the body is covered in warm sand, the environmental conditions mean {{that most of the}} water in the body is quickly evaporated or drained away, meaning that the corpse is naturally dried and preserved. This method was widely used in the pre-dynastic Egyptian period, before artificial mummification was developed. The natural mummification that occurred with these <b>dry</b> <b>sand</b> burials may have led to the original Egyptian belief in an after-death survival and started the tradition of leaving food and implements for an afterlife.|$|E
5|$|Sand dunes are accumulations of {{windblown sand}} {{piled up in}} mounds or ridges. They form {{downwind}} of copious sources of dry, loose sand and occur when topographic and climatic conditions cause airborne particles to settle. As the wind blows, saltation and creep {{take place on the}} windward side of the dune and individual grains of sand move uphill. When they reach the crest, they cascade down the far side. The upwind slope typically has a gradient of 10° to 20° while the lee slope is around 32°, the angle at which loose <b>dry</b> <b>sand</b> will slip. As this wind-induced movement of sand grains takes place, the dune moves slowly {{across the surface of the}} ground. Dunes are sometimes solitary, but they are more often grouped together in dune fields. When these are extensive, they are known as sand seas or ergs.|$|E

25|$|Some bottles are {{ballasted}} with <b>dry</b> <b>sand</b> so {{that they}} float vertically {{at or near the}} ocean surface, and are less influenced by winds and breaking waves than other bottles that are purposely not ballasted. Wooden blocks float higher in the water and thus are more influenced by wind—a design specially suited for simulating travel paths of plastic waste that is less dense than glass containers.|$|E
25|$|In the north, a scrub-covered, {{semi-desert}} plain {{referred as}} the Guban lies {{parallel to the}} Gulf of Aden littoral. With a width of twelve kilometres {{in the west to}} as little as two kilometres in the east, the plain is bisected by watercourses that are essentially beds of <b>dry</b> <b>sand</b> except during the rainy seasons. When the rains arrive, the Guban's low bushes and grass clumps transform into lush vegetation. This coastal strip is part of the Ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands ecoregion.|$|E

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{thermal conductivity}} (lambda) database of three <b>dry</b> standard <b>sands</b> (Ottawa C- 109, Ottawa C- 190, and Toyoura) was developed using a transient line heat source technique. The database contains lambda data representing {{a variety of}} soil compactions and temperatures (T) ranging from 25 A degrees C to 70 A degrees C. The tested standard sands, due to their repeatable physical characteristics, {{can be used as}} reference materials for validation of thermal probes applied to similar dry granular materials. The measured data show an increasing trend of thermal conductivity at dryness (lambda(dry)) against T in spite of declining quartz lambda with T. The air content (porosity) controls the lambda of <b>dry</b> <b>sands</b> by acting as a very effective thermal insulator around solid soil particles. As a result, a diminutive increase of lambda(dry) with T is driven by increasing lambda of air. The experimental lambda data of <b>dry</b> <b>sands</b> were exceptionally well predicted by de Vries and Woodside-Messmer models, and also by a thermal conductance model, a product of lambda of solids and the thermal conductance factor...|$|R
25|$|At Stoney Creek Station, a {{gatehouse}} {{was erected}} in 1909. By 1911 the complex included an open shelter shed with an enclosed office, plus a ladies' {{room with a}} curved roof to the east. By 1936 the complex consisted of the shelter shed; ladies' room; a water tank for steam trains, supplied from Stoney Creek Falls and a sand shed (west end of station); plus two fettler's camping quarters and a trolley and tool shed (either side of track, east end of station). Only the shelter shed, the water tank and the sand shed survive. The latter was once used to refill sandboxes on trains, which enabled <b>dry</b> <b>sand</b> to be dropped onto the tracks to assist traction. In the 1980s a telephone line and its poles were removed. The siding is used by QR maintenance gangs to wait for tourist trains to pass, and the shelter shed is used when it is raining. Exotic plantings in the station's gardens have being replaced by natives, {{in keeping with the}} National Park, although mature mango trees of heritage significance have been retained.|$|E
500|$|Sodium forms {{flammable}} {{hydrogen and}} caustic sodium hydroxide on contact with water; ingestion and contact with moisture on skin, eyes or mucous membranes can cause severe burns. Sodium spontaneously explodes {{in the presence}} of an oxidizer such as water. Fire extinguishers based on water accelerate sodium fires; those based on carbon dioxide and bromochlorodifluoromethane should not be used on sodium fire. Metal fires are Class D, but not all Class D extinguishers are workable with sodium. [...] An effective extinguishing agent for sodium fires is Met-L-X. Other effective agents include Lith-X, which has graphite powder and an organophosphate flame retardant, and <b>dry</b> <b>sand.</b> Sodium fires are prevented in nuclear reactors by isolating sodium from oxygen by surrounding sodium pipes with inert gas. Pool-type sodium fires are prevented using different design measures called catch pan systems. They collect leaking sodium into a leak-recovery tank where it is isolated from oxygen.|$|E

40|$|Sludge, {{which is}} {{produced}} as {{a by-product of}} all treatment processes, has considerable potential as a fertilizer and soil conditioner. Many authorities now discharge the sludge after treatment directly to agricultural land in liquid form, while some others dewater and dry it first. In either case, with proper marketing, it is generally possible for an authority to earn revenue by this means, although it is rare for the income {{to cover all the}} cost involved. In some industrial sludge the total solid concentration may range between 2000 - 100000 ppm and it is reported that more than 6000 waste water treatment plants use the conventional sludge <b>drying</b> <b>sand</b> bed. An experimental investigation was carried out to assess the efficacy of solar energy for drying of sludge from pharmaceutical industrial waste over a sand bed covered with glass as compared to the conventional sludge <b>drying</b> over a <b>sand</b> bed as well as to reduce environmental pollution The two drying beds are constructed in 12 cm thick brick wall with cement mortar and has an effective area of 0. 5 m (2). On the 0. 4 m thick layer of gravel and send the sludge layer from pharmaceutical industry was deposited. The Solar Sludge <b>Drying</b> <b>Sand</b> Bed (SSDSB) reduced drying time by about 25 - 35 % as compared to the Conventional Sludge <b>Drying</b> <b>Sand</b> Bend (CSDSB). The rate of evaporation from the sludge surface and hence the drying was a function of solar radiation. The condensed evaporated water was qualitatively analyzed for probable reuse...|$|R

2500|$|B. cephalotes {{are mostly}} nocturnal, {{although}} they have been seen scurrying from one hiding place to another during the day.

[...] Their nocturnal lifestyle may be helpful in the acquisition of prey. [...] As the beetles are active during the night, they can more easily capture their prey that is diurnal. [...] An additional advantage of the beetle’s nocturnal habit is the decreased amount of predators active while the beetle is active.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This study {{examined}} the effect of surface (concrete, grass, <b>dry</b> beach <b>sand,</b> wet beach sand) and gender on pedometer accuracy during walking. Methods: Fifty-two healthy university students volunteered for this study and completed six 150 -m walking trials {{for each of the}} four different surfaces while wearing a YAMAX SW- 700 Digiwalker pedometer. For each trial, time, number of steps taken and number of steps registered by the pedometer were recorded. These variables and pedometer accuracy for each walking surface and gender were analyzed by two-way repeated-measures ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc tests. Results: Walking over <b>dry</b> beach <b>sand</b> significantly reduced walking speed (concrete, 5. 6 +/- 0. 5 km[middle dot]h- 1; grass, 5. 6 +/- 0. 5 km[middle dot]h- 1; <b>dry</b> beach <b>sand,</b> 5. 0 +/- 0. 5 km[middle dot]h- 1 : wet beach sand, 5. 4 +/- 0. 4 km[middle dot]h- 1) and increased the number of steps taken (concrete, 190 +/- 13; grass, 186 +/- 12; <b>dry</b> beach <b>sand,</b> 207 +/- 12; wet beach sand, 194 +/- 11) and registered (concrete, 195 +/- 14; grass, 191 +/- 14; <b>dry</b> beach <b>sand,</b> 213 +/- 15; wet beach sand, 201 +/- 16) by the pedometer compared with concrete and grass. Compared with males, females registered a greater number of pedometer steps (204 +/- 18 vs 197 +/- 15) and a greater absolute (9 +/- 12 vs 3 +/- 7 steps) and relative (4. 46 +/- 5. 72 vs 1. 63 +/- 3. 57 %) pedometer error during walking over <b>dry</b> beach <b>sand.</b> Conclusions: Walking on a soft surface such as <b>dry</b> beach <b>sand</b> significantly reduced walking speed and increased pedometer error for females compared with males, possibly by exacerbating hip and walking movements. Identification of gender and softer surfaces should be considered when documenting physical activity levels in field studies...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Culturable enterococci and a {{suite of}} {{environmental}} variables were collected during a predominantly dry summer at a beach impacted by nonpoint source pollution. These data were used to evaluate sands {{as a source of}} enterococci to nearshore waters, and to assess the relationship between environmental factors and dry-weather enterococci abundance. Best-fit multiple linear regressions used environmental variables to explain {{more than half of the}} observed variation in enterococci in water and <b>dry</b> <b>sands.</b> Notably, during <b>dry</b> weather the abundance of enterococci in <b>dry</b> <b>sands</b> at the mean high-tide line was significantly positively related to sand moisture content (ranging from < 1 − 4 %), and the daily mean ENT in water could be predicted by a linear regression with turbidity alone. Temperature was also positively correlated with ENT abundance in this study, which may indicate an important role of seasonal warming in temperate regions. Inundation by spring tides was the primary rewetting mechanism that sustained culturable enterococci populations in high-tide sands. Tidal forcing modulated the abundance of enterococci in the water, as bot...|$|R
