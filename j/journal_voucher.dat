50|$|Beginning Inventory (usually from a {{physical}} count) + receipts - shipments = Ending Inventory. Some accountants will add or subtract a value using an adjustment entry (<b>journal</b> <b>voucher),</b> however if all receipts (purchases) and shipments (invoices) are captured as transactions, this would never need to occur.|$|E
50|$|The term {{can also}} be used with {{reference}} to accounts receivable, where it is also a document representing intent to make an adjustment to an account, and for the general ledger where there is need to adjust the accounts within that ledger; in that case it is referred to as a <b>journal</b> <b>voucher.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to investigate, analyze and finally develop the {{prototype}} of Centralized Automation System for Open Item Transaction (DPT) at PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. The system can minimize the open item transaction (DPT) that is expecfed to reduce the penally, expense and processing time. The data were collected from the Head Office and 2 branches in Jakarta. A descriptive method and a combined method System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and protolyping development were used to analyze the collected data. The results of the study is in forms of logical model of the system (data flow diagram, dictionary and process descriptions), physical design of the system and the protorype of the system. To optimize th e overall system, some changes to the branch applications such as inter-branch online <b>voucher</b> <b>journal</b> a nd transaction process enhancement are made. Later, to focus on the organization effectiveness. two units in Head Office PGT and SAK, were merged to be one unit (unit PGT). I suggest that the management be more intensified on the evalualion and provide system recovery to avoid process failures at the Head Office. If it is to be implemented at all branches, it will be better to use the pilot project to reduce the risk rate. ...|$|R
