50|$|A generic formal {{parameter}} is a value, a variable, a constant, a type, a subprogram, {{or even an}} instance of another, designated, <b>generic</b> <b>unit.</b> For generic formal types, the syntax distinguishes between discrete, floating-point, fixed-point, access (pointer) types, etc. Some {{formal parameter}}s can have default values.|$|E
50|$|There are twelve <b>generic</b> <b>unit</b> types: Garrison, Assassin, Trickster, Gunner, Shooter, Sorceress, Paladin, Breaker, Venery, Archer, Priestess, and Witch. In addition, eight monster classes exist: Harpuia, Skeleton, Drake, Undine, Pixie, Vampire, Golem, and Rail Cannon. Most major story {{characters}} {{have their own}} unique classes. New units can be permanently recruited in between battlefields.|$|E

50|$|Clinical trials units (CTU) are {{specialised}} {{biomedical research}} units which design, centrally coordinate and analyse clinical trials and other studies. Some CTUs specialise in different methodologies, such as randomised controlled trials, cluster randomised trials, surgical trials, {{and health services}} research.

50|$|Like {{many games}} {{produced}} in the mid-1970s, the limited replayability {{and scope of the}} game left it in the shadow of Squad Leader, whose open-ended format with <b>generic</b> <b>unit</b> counters and geomorphic mapboards (as well as very high quality mounted mapboards and overall production value) would be of much greater and wider appeal to wargamers as a whole.|$|E
50|$|In 1795 {{a new law}} {{replaced}} the three names gravet, grave and bar by a single <b>generic</b> <b>unit</b> name: the gram. The new gram was equal to the old gravet. Four new prefixes were added to cover the same range of units as in 1793 (milligram, centigram, decigram, gram, decagram, hectogram, kilogram, myriagram). The brass prototype of the grave was renamed to provisional kilogram.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the body}} of a <b>generic</b> <b>unit,</b> the (formal) type {{parameter}} is handled like its upper bound (expressed with [...] if not constrained). If the return type of a method is the type parameter, the result (e.g. of type [...] ) can be referenced by a variable of the type of the upper bound (or [...] ). In the other direction, the wildcard fits no other type, not even : If [...] has been applied as the formal type parameter of a method, no actual parameters can be passed to it. However, objects of the unknown type can be read from the generic object and assigned to a variable of a supertype of the upperbound.|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{virtually}} every other RPG released at the time or since, the non-boss battles of Destiny of an Emperor do not consist solely of encounters with <b>generic</b> <b>units.</b> While <b>generic</b> enemy <b>units</b> do appear in the game, most random battles are fought against one or more generals randomly selected from those roaming the lands the player's party is traveling through at the time. Additionally, most of these unique units can be recruited. After being defeated in battle, there is a random chance that the general will offer to join the party, usually {{under the condition that}} the player character pays him a bribe of either money or horses (which can be purchased at item shops). Once recruited, the general will no longer be encountered in random battles.|$|R

5000|$|A {{number of}} non-selectable, non-upgradable heroes appear and are playable in certain missions. In {{the case of}} the good campaign, these [...] "guest" [...] heroes include Merry, Pippin, Treebeard, Theodred, Prince Isildur and <b>generic</b> <b>unit</b> captains. On the evil campaign, these {{additional}} companions include Orc chieftains and captains, Uruk-hai lieutenants and captains, and in a few select missions, the Dark Lord Sauron himself. On both sides, standard-bearers are also occasionally available and add to the command points on a given flank. The campaign comprises 24 levels, in addition to 2 tutorial levels and 6 bonus missions. All of the missions in a given episode must be completed to move to the next portion of the trilogy. Several bonus levels and heroes are unlockable by meeting specific conditions while playing the game.|$|E
5000|$|In structuralism-influenced {{studies of}} mythology, a mytheme is a {{fundamental}} <b>generic</b> <b>unit</b> of narrative structure (typically involving a relationship between a character, an event, and a theme) from which myths {{are thought to be}} constructed - a minimal unit that is always found shared with other, related mythemes and reassembled in various ways ("bundled") or linked in more complicated relationships. For example, the myths of Adonis and Osiris share several elements, leading some scholars to conclude that they share a source, i.e. images passed down in cultures or from one to another, being ascribed new interpretations of the action depicted, as well as new names in various readings of icons. Claude Lévi-Strauss (1908-2009), who gave the term wide circulation, wrote, [...] "If one wants to establish a parallel between structural linguistics and the structural analysis of myths, the correspondence is established, not between mytheme and word but between mytheme and phoneme." ...|$|E
50|$|Chinese Farm offers rather limited {{value in}} {{simulating}} Israeli efforts {{to cross the}} Suez Canal and Egypt's counter efforts. The map and scenarios are sufficient to develop a general operational understanding of the simulated events. Order of battle data is problematic, however, and most brigade and lower units have <b>generic</b> <b>unit</b> designations and some counters include unexplained letter designators. Those letter designators are abbreviations {{of the names of}} the IDF brigade commanders, and the full names can be ascertained from any detailed history of the conflict; the numerical designators are either IDF brigade numbers or Egyptian division, or independent regiment, numbers. Unit designators are irrelevant to unit positioning, and the accompanying materials do not describe how the opposing forces were arrayed historically. Information on Egyptian and Israeli doctrine, tactics, and equipment is also largely absent. The Designer's Notes and Player's Notes are sparse in adding context and do not include references or recommended further reading. The game was published in 1975 when there was little detailed information openly available. Unsurprisingly, SPI made some order of battle errors.|$|E

The map and scenarios are sufficient to develop a general operational understanding of the simulated events. Order of battle data is problematic, however, and most brigade and lower units have <b>generic</b> <b>unit</b> designations and some counters include unexplained letter designators. (The letter designations on the units of the [...] "G1" [...] IDF brigade identify the 'Golani' Mechanised Infantry Brigade.

Unit designators are irrelevant to unit positioning, and the accompanying materials do not describe how the opposing forces were arrayed historically. The order of battle also excludes the Syrian 5th Mechanized Division, the unit responsible for breaking through Israeli defenses in the southern Golan Heights. Information on Syrian and Israeli doctrine, tactics, and equipment is largely absent.

40|$|The {{composition}} of many professional services {{firms in the}} Urban Development area has moved away from a discipline specific ‘silo’ structure to a more multidisciplinary environment. The benefits of multidisciplinarity have been seen in industry by providing synergies across many of the related disciplines. Similarly, the Queensland University of Technology, Bachelor of Urban Development degree has sought to broaden the knowledge base of students and achieve a greater level of synergy between related urban development disciplines through the introduction of <b>generic</b> and multidisciplinary <b>units.</b> This study aims {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of delivering core property units in a multidisciplinary context. A comparative analysis has been undertaken between core property <b>units</b> and more <b>generic</b> <b>units</b> offered in a multidisciplinary context from introductory, intermediate and advanced years within the property program. This analysis was based on data collected from course performance surveys, student performance results, a student focus group and was informed by a reflective process from the student perspective and lecturer/ tutor feedback. The study showed that there are many benefits associated with multidisciplinary unit offerings across the QUT Urban Development program particularly in the more <b>generic</b> <b>units.</b> However, these units require a greater degree of management. It is more difficult to organise, teach and coordinate multidisciplinary student cohorts due to a difference in prior knowledge and experience between each of the discipline groups. In addition, the interaction between lecturers/ tutors and the students frequently becomes more limited. A perception exists within the student body that this more limited face to face contact with academic staff is not valuable which may be exacerbated by the quality of complimentary online teaching materials. For many academics, non-attendance at lectures was coupled with an increase in email communication. From the limited data collected during the study there appears to be no clear correlation between large multidisciplinary student classes and student academic performance or satisfaction. ...|$|R

In the case of lambda expressions, which are used to define the way <b>generic</b> <b>units</b> are built, the two semantics do not agree. We present a number of situations of practical importance when the current situation is unsatisfactory and propose a series of changes to the extended static semantics to remedy this. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Recon Fires is {{a concept}} whereby {{military}} units manoeuvre on the battlespace to elicit a response from an unknown enemy. One key question about the implementation of this concept is: “how many Recon Fires missions can a <b>generic</b> <b>unit</b> perform before becoming operationally unviable? ” To investigate this, a multi-method approach combining seminar wargaming, closed-loop simulation and Markov modelling and analysis was used. Previous studies that have taken a similar approach generally conclude with statistical {{analysis of the data}} from the closed-loop simulation. An advantage of taking the additional step of generating a Markov Chain was that only a single typical Recon Fires Mission needed to be modelled, reducing the time to develop the closed-loop simulation model. This in turn gave quicker turn-around on results and allowed greater exploration of “what if ” situations. The seminar wargame allowed the Recon Fires aspects to be isolated from the broader operation and gave initial insights into the concept. It also provided the key data required to construct a closed-loop simulation. The closed-loop simulation was then run multiple times for different starting states. Each starting state represented a different strength of the force before it began a Recon Fires mission. The generated data was analysed directly and used to construct the Markov Chain. The Markov Chain was then analysed to find the mean time until the <b>generic</b> <b>unit</b> became operationally unviable...|$|E
