The World Health Organization estimates that nearly 5 million people in Nepal lack access to safe drinking water while globally, 1. 1 billion lack access to improved water supplies. Point-of-use water treatment technologies, such as household ceramic water filters, offer an affordable and effective means of treating water to standards suitable for drinking. The fact that ceramic water filters can be manufactured and produced by local ceramists with local materials makes ceramic filters particularly attractive as a point-of-use treatment technology that is affordable, appropriate, and sustainable. This thesis examines existing ceramic water filter technologies, production processes, and methods for bringing a low-cost ceramic water filter to market in Nepal. Three types of disk filters and five types of candle filters are evaluated in terms of microbiological removal efficiency and flow rate. A red-clay grog <b>disk</b> <b>filter</b> coated with colloidal silver {{and three of the}} five candle filters (Katadyn®, Ceradyn, Katadyn® Gravidyn, and the Hari Govinda white-clay candle filter capped on both ends) also coated with colloidal silver, performed the best in terms of microbiological removal efficiency (> 98 %) and flow rate (ranging from 641 mL/hr/candle (Ceradyn) to 844 mL/hr/candle (Gravidyn)). In addition to filter testing, a guideline for developing a ceramic water filter in preparation for bringing a product to market is presented, along with a discussion on the importance of laboratory and field testing to ensure overall product performance. A step-by-step summary of the production process is also presented along with a comparison of the theoretical flow rate through a candle filter versus a <b>disk</b> <b>filter.</b> Recommendations for future work include testing and modifying the current disk-filter prototype design and research on the most appropriate filter element for the proposed prototype. by Robert W.

30|$|If {{the amount}} of adsorbates was larger than {{breakthrough}} adsorption amount of adsorbent materials, target compounds could flow away with solution. In order to obtain high removal efficiency, breakthrough amount should be investigated. Under the optimum conditions, the breakthrough amount was investigated by pumping 100  mL solution with initial concentration of the three target estrogens {{in the range of}} 1.0 to 20.0  mg/L through the <b>disk</b> <b>filter</b> device. The results indicated that satisfactory removal yields (above 90 %) were obtained during 1.0 to 15.0  mg/L. When the initial concentration was increased to 20.0  mg/L, a drop about 11.29 % to 14.76 % of removal yields of all the three target estrogens was occurred. The marked decline indicated the adsorption breakthrough of Nylon 6 nanofibers mat. According to the experimental results, the breakthrough initial concentration of all the three estrogens was 15.0  mg/L, while the removal yields of DES, DS, and HEX were 97.55 [*]±[*] 1.36 %, 95.13 [*]±[*] 1.65 %, and 93.37 [*]±[*] 1.49 %, respectively. Therefore, the maximum dynamic adsorption capacity of DES, DS, and HEX by Nylon 6 nanofibers mat was calculated as 365.81, 356.74, and 350.13  mg/g for DES, DS, and HEX, respectively. It was evident that highly dynamic estrogen adsorption performance could be obtained using Nylon 6 nanofibers mat as sorbent material.|$|E

The results indicated that the amount of adsorbent strongly influenced estrogens adsorption yield. The removal yields of DES, DS, and HEX increased from 70.15 [*]±[*] 1.93 % to 97.59 [*]±[*] 2.26 %, 62.47 [*]±[*] 1.96 % to 96.72 [*]±[*] 1.81 %, and 60.32 [*]±[*] 2.23 % to 96.26 [*]±[*] 1.68 %, respectively, with an increase in the adsorbent amount from 1.0 to 4.0  mg, and the variations of removal for target contaminants using 5.0  mg nanofibers were not remarkable. The higher adsorption yields for higher adsorbent amount are due to the increase of more available binding sites for the adsorption. And then, after a certain point (4.0  mg), the adsorption yield stayed nearly constant {{may be due to the}} saturation of binding sites on the adsorbent surface. Therefore, 4.0  mg of the Nylon 6 nanofibers mat was found to be optimum of the further dynamic flow mode adsorption.|$|E

Particularly in Mediterranean regions, where it is more {{difficult}} to meet the agricultural water demand with conven-tional resources, wastewater reuse represents a viable option. Drip irrigation is particularly suitable for wastewater reuse because it minimises the health risks to farmers and product consumers due to contact with the wastewater. The performance of drip irrigation systems using wastewater is mainly limited by emitter clogging, and this discourages farmers from introducing it. The paper gives the results of exper-imental trials on the behaviour of six kinds of filters (gravel media, disk and screen) and four types of drip emitters (vortex and labyrinth) using five kinds of municipal wastewater that have not undergone previous advanced treatment. The performance of the emitters and filters tested depends {{on the quality of the}} wastewater: total suspended solids and organic matter content influence the percentage of totally clogged emitters, the mean discharge emitted, the emission uniformity coefficient, and the operating time of the filter between cleaning operations.

40|$|AbstractA Micromechanical RF ChannelizerbyMehmet AkgulDoctor of Philosophy in Engineering - Electrical Engineering and Computer SciencesUniversity of California, BerkeleyProfessor Clark T. -C. Nguyen, ChairThe power {{consumption}} {{of a radio}} generally goes as the number and strength of the RF signals it must process. In particular, a radio receiver would consume much less power if the signal presented to its electronics contained only the desired signal in a tiny percent bandwidth frequency channel, rather than the typical mix of signals containing unwanted energy outside the desired channel. Unfortunately, a lack of filters capable of selecting single channel bandwidths at RF forces the front-ends of contemporary receivers to accept unwanted signals, and thus, to operate with sub-optimal efficiency. This dissertation focuses on {{the degree to which}} capacitive-gap transduced micromechanical resonators can achieve the aforementioned RF channel-selecting filters. It aims to first show theoretically that with appropriate scaling capacitive-gap transducers are strong enough to meet the needed coupling requirements; and second, to fully detail an architecture and design procedure needed to realize said filters. Finally, this dissertation provides an actual experimentally demonstrated RF channel-select filter designed using the developed procedures and confirming theoretical predictions. Specifically, this dissertation introduces four methods that make possible the design and fabrication of RF channel-select filters. The first of these introduces a small-signal equivalent circuit for parallel-plate capacitive-gap transduced micromechanical resonators that employs negative capacitance to model the dependence of resonance frequency on electrical stiffness in a way that facilitates the analysis of micromechanical circuits loaded with arbitrary electrical impedances. The new circuit model not only correctly predicts the dependence of electrical stiffness on the impedances loading the input and output electrodes of parallel-plate capacitive-gap transduced micromechanical device, but does so in a visually intuitive way that identifies current drive as most appropriate for applications that must be stable against environmental perturbations, such as acceleration or power supply variations. Measurements on fabricated devices in fact confirm predictions by the new model of up to 4 × improvement in frequency stability against DC-bias voltage variations for contour-mode disk resonators as the resistance loading their ports increases. By enhancing circuit visualization, this circuit model makes more obvious the circuit design procedures and topologies most beneficial for certain mechanical circuits, e. g., filters and oscillators. The second method enables simultaneous low motional resistance (Rx 70, 000) at 61 MHz using an improved ALD-partial electrode-to-resonator gap filling technique that reduces the Q-limiting surface losses of previous renditions by adding an alumina pre-coating before ALD of the gap-filling high-k dielectric. This effort increases the Q over the ~ 10, 000 of previous renditions by more than 6 × towards demonstration of the first VHF micromechanical resonators in any material, piezoelectric or not, to meet the simultaneous high Q (> 50, 000) and low motional resistance Rx (8, 800 supplied by polysilicon disk resonators employing for the first time capacitive transducer gaps small enough to generate coupling strengths of Cx/Co ~ 0. 1 %, which is a 6. 1 × improvement over previous efforts. The filter structure utilizes electrical tuning to correct frequency mismatches due to process variations, where a dc tuning voltage of 12. 1 V improves the filter insertion loss by 1. 8 dB and yields the desired equiripple passband shape. An electrical equivalent circuit is presented that captures not only the ideal filter response, but also parasitic non-idealities that create electrical feed-through, where simulation of the derived equivalent circuit matches the measured filter spectrum closely both in-band and out-of-band. The combined 2. 7 dB passband insertion loss and 50 dB stopband rejection of the demonstrated 206 -element 0. 09 % bandwidth 223. 4 -MHz differential micromechanical <b>disk</b> <b>filter</b> represents a landmark for capacitive-gap transduced micromechanical resonator technology. This demonstration proves that the mere introduction of small gaps, on the order of 39 nm, goes a long way towards moving this technology from a research curiosity to practical performance specs commensurate with the needs of actual RF channel-selecting receiver front-ends. It also emphasizes the need for tuning and defensive stress-relieving structural design when percent bandwidths and gaps shrink, all demonstrated by the work herein. Perhaps most encouraging is that the models presented in dissertation used to design the filter and predict its behavior seem to be all be spot on. This means that predictions using these models foretelling 1 -GHz filters with sub- 200 &# 8486; impedances enabled by 20 nm-gaps might soon come true, bringing this technology ever closer to someday realizing the ultra-low power channel-selecting communication front-ends targeted for autonomous set-and-forget sensor networks.

Some of the sludge is fed back into the aeration lanes, to assist {{the start of the}} secondary treatment process, while some is surplus, so is dewatered and passes on to the sludge treatment process. The liquid from the final settlement tanks is of sufficient quality that it can be discharged into Salmons Brook, from where it makes its way into the Lee Navigation. Before discharge, some of the water is passed through a tertiary treatment phase, where a fine filter is used to remove residual fine particles. The woven mesh membrane must be washed periodically to remove any accumulated sediments. <b>Disk</b> <b>filters</b> capable of treating between 40 and 50 percent of the works flow were installed in 2012, and Thames Water hoped to increase this to allow all of the flow to be filtered by 2015.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the design optimization of the coupling beam of wine glass (WG) mode micromechanical <b>disk</b> <b>filters</b> using the simulated annealing algorithm. The filter under consideration {{consists of two}} identical wine-glass mode disk resonators, mechanically coupled by a flexural mode beam. Such coupled two-resonator system exhibits two mechanical resonance modes with closely spaced frequencies that define the filter passband. The frequencies of the constituent resonators determine the center frequency of the filter, while the bandwidth {{is determined by the}} stiffness and location of attachment of the coupling beam. The goal is to design a filter with a commonly used bandwidth, namely 100 kHz. The design variables that control the bandwidth value are the beam length, the beam width, and the location of attachment of the coupling beam from the center. The simulated annealing algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem, since the governing dynamic equations of the resonator-coupling system are highly nonlinear. The resulting optimum design is simulated using the finite element method, which confirms the achievement of the desired center frequency and bandwidth...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a controlling and positioning approach for an optical <b>filter</b> <b>disk.</b> In the known applications where Hall-effect sensors and magnets (radially positioned) are applied, {{the purpose of}} the latter is to help developing a binary code used mainly for filter identification. The number of sensors is equal to the maximum number of magnets that participate in forming the filter identity code. Therefore, three sensors and the corresponding number of magnets radially positioned for each position are required for the identification of seven filters. The precise position of the <b>filter</b> <b>disk</b> is reached by counting up the steps of a stepper motor. The presented approach applies only one Hall-effect sensor. The fore working front of one magnet, positioned along the disk periphery, is used to precisely mark each filter position. At a certain distance after the main magnet, a second one is positioned in order to form an identity code. The paper contains an algorithm for optical <b>filter</b> <b>disk</b> control and positioning, along with the mathematical formalism on which it is based.
