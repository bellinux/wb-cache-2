40|$|Low-temperature, co-fired {{ceramics}} (LTCC) are {{the substrate}} material-of-choice {{for a growing}} number of multi-chip module (MCM) applications. Unlike the longer-standing hybrid microcircuit technology based upon alumina substrates, the manufacturability and reliability of thick film solder joints on LTCC substrates have not been widely studied. An investigation was undertaken to fully characterize such solder joints. A surface mount test vehicle with <b>Daisy</b> <b>chain</b> electrical <b>connections</b> was designed and built with Dupont{trademark} 951 tape. The Dupont{trademark} 4569 thick film ink (Au 76 -Pt 21 -Pd 3 wt. %) was used to establish the surface conductor pattern. The conductor pattern was fired onto the LTCC substrate in a matrix of process conditions that included: (1) double versus triple prints, (2) dielectric frame versus no frame, and (3) three firing temperatures (800 C, 875 C and 950 C). Pads were examined from the test vehicles. The porosity of the thick film layers was measured using quantitative image analysis in both the transverse and short transverse directions. A significant dependence on firing temperature was recorded for porosity. Solder paste comprised of Sn 63 -Pb 37 powder with an RMA flux was screen printed onto the circuit boards. The appropriate components, which included chip capacitors of sizes 0805 up to 2225 and 50 mil pitch, leadless ceramic chip carriers having sizes of 16 I/O to 68 I/O, were then placed on the circuit boards. The test vehicles were oven reflowed under a N{sub 2 } atmosphere. The solderability of the thick film pads was also observed {{to be sensitive to the}} firing conditions. Solderability appeared to degrade by the added processing steps needed for the triple print and dielectric window depositions. However, the primary factor in solderability was the firing temperature. Solderability was poorer when the firing temperature was higher...|$|R

50|$|<b>Daisy</b> <b>chaining</b> DNA is {{the process}} of when DNA {{undergoing}} PCR amplification becomes tangled and forms a 'daisy chain.' During PCR, primers or dNTP's will eventually be used up and limit further reactions; it is when the primers deplete that causes <b>daisy</b> <b>chaining.</b> Since the denaturing and annealing processes still continue without primers, the single-stranded DNA molecules reanneal to themselves. However, this reannealing does not always occur to another complementary strand. It is this imperfect match up that causes 'tangles'. These tangles look like a <b>daisy</b> <b>chain.</b>|$|R

40|$|For many {{positive}} odd integers n, whether prime or not, the set Un of units of Zn contains members t, u, v and w, say with respective orders τ, ψ, ω and π, such {{that we can}} write Un as the direct product Un = 〈t〉×〈u〉×〈v〉×〈w〉. Each element of Un can then be written in the form thuiv jwk where 0 ≤ h<τ, 0 ≤ i<ψ, 0 ≤ j<ωand 0 ≤ k<π. We can then often use the structure of 〈t〉×〈u 〉 ×〈v〉×〈w 〉 to arrange the τψωπ elements of Un in a <b>daisy</b> <b>chain,</b> i. e. in a circular arrangement such that, as we proceed once round the chain in either direction, the set of differences between each member and the preceding one is itself the set Un.

50|$|Though <b>daisy</b> <b>chains</b> are {{sometimes}} used by free climbers {{as a type}} of sling (a quick attachment used from harness directly to a belay anchor), and for ad hoc purposes {{similar to those of the}} backpacker, the canonical use for a <b>daisy</b> <b>chain</b> is in aid climbing, wherein the leader will typically attach one end to the harness, and the other to the top-most anchor placement (by carabiner or fifi hook), particularly after having ascended in étriers as high as possible. This allows the leader to hang from the <b>daisy</b> <b>chain</b> while preparing the next anchor placement.
