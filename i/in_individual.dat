40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{the prevalence of}} thyroid dysfunction and autoimmunity (TAI) and to determine age-specific reference ranges <b>in</b> <b>individuals</b>   60  kIU/L) and/or outliers, data of 547 individuals {{were used to determine}} age-specific reference ranges. The prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) and subclinical hyperthyroidism (sch) was determined according to the reference ranges from the commercial assay and also according to the calculated age-specific reference ranges. From our study population. Results From the 676 individuals included, 559 (83 %) were <  60  year-old and 117 (17 %) ≥  60  year-old. The prevalence of sch and TAI was comparable between both groups (8. 6 % vs. 13. 7 % and 15. 4 % vs. 20. 5 % respectively). The prevalence of SCH was significantly higher <b>in</b> <b>individuals</b> ≥  60  years, compared to that <b>in</b> <b>individuals</b> <  60  years (14. 5 % vs. 5. 4 %; p <  0. 001). The calculated 2. 5 and 97. 5 percentile for the age-specific TSH range was 0. 24 and 4. 4 mIU/L <b>in</b> <b>individuals</b> <  60  years and 0. 15 and 8. 2  mIU/L <b>in</b> <b>individuals</b> ≥  60  years.

Conclusions The prevalence of SCH was higher <b>in</b> <b>individuals</b> ≥  60  years, compared to that <b>in</b> <b>individuals</b> <  60  years, but when age-specific TSH reference ranges were used, it was comparable between both study groups.

5|$|A {{range of}} {{battlefield}} memorials emerged. The huge Douaumont ossuary {{was built to}} remember Verdun through a private French charity, organised by the Bishop of Verdun.

The Romanian authorities built a similar mausoleum at Mărăşeşti, explicitly likened to the use French ossuary at Verdun. Amidst some concerns about denigrating the importance of other battlefields, the CBMC focused on producing a single major memorial at Vimy. In Turkey, the entire battlefield of Gallipoli was ceded to Britain and her imperial allies in 1923, and the area was turned into an extended memorial to the war dead. There were no settlements to reconstruct, so the graves were largely left scattered <b>in</b> <b>individual</b> graves or small cemeteries, and the slopes were planted with Australian vegetation.
