For several decades {{it has been}} the home of India's main financial services, and a focus for both infrastructure development and private investment. From being an ancient fishing community and a colonial centre of trade, Mumbai has become South Asia's largest city and home of the world's most prolific film industry.|$|E
5|$|Biological {{structures}} or sequences {{in different}} taxa are homologous {{if they are}} derived from a common ancestor. Homology thus implies divergent evolution. For example, many insects (such as dragonflies) possess two pairs of flying wings. In beetles, the first pair of wings <b>has</b> <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> pair of hard wing covers, while in Dipteran flies the second pair of wings has evolved into small halteres used for balance.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1965, UC Santa Cruz {{began as}} a {{showcase}} for progressive, cross-disciplinary undergraduate education, innovative teaching methods and contemporary architecture. Since then, it <b>has</b> <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> modern research university {{with a wide variety}} of both undergraduate and graduate programs, while retaining its reputation for strong undergraduate support and student political activism. The residential college system, which consists of ten small colleges, is intended to combine the student support of a small college with the resources of a major university.|$|E

5|$|After passing {{playing fields}} to the south, the A1 briefly becomes Market Place, a former street market that <b>has</b> <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> short stretch of shops, then becomes Falloden Way – built between 1914 and 1924 {{as part of}} a {{programme}} of planned extensions to Hampstead Garden Suburb, and runs on an embankment due to a dip in the ground caused by Mutton Brook, a tributary of the River Brent, which runs parallel to the road immediately to the south for its entire length. The north side of the road is occupied by 1930s housing blocks, whilst the southern side is occupied by a narrow strip of parkland following the brook, and by the northern tip of Big Wood and Little Wood – two of the few surviving remnants of the ancient woodland that once covered what is now north London.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} Age, the Age of Eden, the player learns a mysterious entity is {{controlling}} the world's other lifeforms and sending {{them against the}} player. This entity {{turns out to be}} Bolbox, a lifeform that <b>has</b> <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> freakish and evil advanced being by consuming the crystals, believing itself to be the first human, but in reality is a gigantic single-celled organism. In the game's final battle, the player and Bolbox fight to determine who will gain entry into Eden and become Gaia's partner. Bolbox is defeated, and the player joins Gaia in Eden and is granted the gift of intelligence. It is also revealed the crystals were introduced to Earth by an advanced civilization on Mars, who misguidedly wished to help Earth by speeding its evolution with the crystals. Upon realizing the dangers the crystals create, the Martians decide to leave Earth alone and observe until it becomes advanced enough for them to interact with.|$|E
5|$|The diverse {{origins of}} Malagasy culture {{are evident in}} its {{tangible}} expressions. The most emblematic instrument of Madagascar, the valiha, is a bamboo tube zither carried to Madagascar by early settlers from southern Borneo, and is very similar in form {{to those found in}} Indonesia and the Philippines today. Traditional houses in Madagascar are likewise similar to those of southern Borneo in terms of symbolism and construction, featuring a rectangular layout with a peaked roof and central support pillar. Reflecting a widespread veneration of the ancestors, tombs are culturally significant in many regions and tend to be built of more durable material, typically stone, and display more elaborate decoration than the houses of the living. The production and weaving of silk {{can be traced back to}} the island's earliest settlers, and Madagascar's national dress, the woven lamba, <b>has</b> <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> varied and refined art.|$|E

5|$|The octopus is bilaterally {{symmetrical}} {{along its}} dorso-ventral axis; {{the head and}} foot are {{at one end of}} an elongated body and function as the anterior (front) of the animal. The head includes the mouth and brain. The foot <b>has</b> <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> set of flexible, prehensile appendages, known as arms, that surround the mouth and are attached to each other near their base by a webbed structure. The arms can be described based on side and sequence position (such as L1, R1, L2, R2) and divided into four pairs. The bulbous and hollow mantle is fused {{to the back of the}} head and is known as the visceral hump; it contains most of the vital organs. The mantle cavity has muscular walls and contains the gills; it is connected to the exterior by a funnel or siphon. The mouth of an octopus, located underneath the arms, has a sharp hard beak.|$|E
5|$|Silicon Alley, {{centered}} in Manhattan, <b>has</b> <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> metonym for the sphere encompassing the New York City metropolitan region's high tech industries, including the Internet, new media, telecommunications, digital media, software development, biotechnology, game design, financial technology (fintech), and other fields within information technology that {{are supported by}} the area's entrepreneurship ecosystem and venture capital investments. , New York City hosted 300,000 employees in the tech sector. In 2015, Silicon Alley generated over US$7.3 billion in venture capital investment, most based in Manhattan, {{as well as in}} Brooklyn, Queens, and elsewhere in the region. High technology startup companies and employment are growing in Manhattan and across New York City, bolstered by the city's emergence as a global node of creativity and entrepreneurship, social tolerance, and environmental sustainability, as well as New York's position as the leading Internet hub and telecommunications center in North America, including its vicinity to several transatlantic fiber optic trunk lines, the city's intellectual capital, and its extensive outdoor wireless connectivity. Verizon Communications, headquartered at 140 West Street in Lower Manhattan, was at the final stages in 2014 of completing a US$3 billion fiberoptic telecommunications upgrade throughout New York City. As of October 2014, New York City hosted 300,000 employees in the tech sector, with a significant proportion in Manhattan.|$|E
