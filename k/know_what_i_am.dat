500|$|McCartney has {{publicly}} professed support for Everton, and also shown favour for Liverpool. In 2008, he ended speculation about his allegiance when he said, [...] "Here's the deal: {{my father was}} born in Everton, my family are officially Evertonians, so if {{it comes down to}} a derby match or an FA Cup final between the two, I would have to support Everton. But after a concert at Wembley Arena I got a bit of a friendship with Kenny Dalglish, who had been to the gig and I thought 'You <b>know</b> <b>what?</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> just going to support them both because it's all Liverpool.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike his provocative written language, Wills {{spoke in}} a breezy and laconic manner. In one of his {{borderline}} [...] "thought disordered" [...] letters, {{it is evident that}} at times he entered a state of depersonalisation: [...] "I do not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> standing on ... when anyone speaks to me I cannot {{for the life of me}} make out what they are talking about—everything seems so curious." [...] In 1884, Hammersley compared Wills' incipient madness and fiery glare to that of Adam Lindsay Gordon, the Australian bush poet. Wills' mental instability is a source for speculation: epilepsy has been suggested as a possible cause of his perplexed mental state, and a variant of bipolar illness may account for his disjointed thinking and flowery, confused writings.|$|E
500|$|Gallagher {{stated in}} a 2006 radio {{interview}} with Russell Brand {{that he does}} not believe in God or [...] "an all-guiding force". Despite this assertion, throughout his career, many of his songs have mentioned God ("Carry Us All", [...] "Gas Panic!," [...] "The Hindu Times" [...] and [...] "Little by Little"), and all the tracks he had contributed to Dig Out Your Soul, {{as well as the other}} bandmates' songs, have lyrics and references to God and other biblical terms. Dig Out Your Soul has been described by Gallagher as a [...] "religious Armageddon". But in recent interviews for Dig Out Your Soul regarding religion, he stated [...] "See, I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> If I was an atheist I'd just write songs about not believing in God – but I don't know what I am." ...|$|E

500|$|Tired {{of being}} the only boy in his class to have never kissed a girl, Butters {{purchases}} his first kiss from Sally, who sells kisses for $5. Having won the respect of his classmates, he devises a plan to advertise Sally's services to other unpopular boys at the school. Sally gives Butters a 40 percent cut for his advertising and managing services, and Butters soon turns the venture into a full-fledged [...] "kissing company" [...] by recruiting more girls to fill in during times in which Sally is busy. Upon learning about Butters' business, Kyle tells him that he is [...] "nothing but a common pimp". Oblivious to what the word means, Butters attends a pimp convention where he seeks advice from more-experienced pimps, including one called Keyshawn. Afterward, he starts to mimic the pimp jargon, such as referring to Sally as his [...] "bottom bitch", and incorporating [...] "Do you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> saying?" [...] into his conversations.|$|E
2500|$|In his 1970 book I Seem To Be a Verb, he wrote: [...] "I live on Earth at present, and I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> I {{know that}} I {{am not a}} category. I am not a thing—a noun. I {{seem to be a}} verb, an {{evolutionary}} process—an integral function of the universe." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, Fox made a {{statement}} about her personal life: [...] "I have slept with other women but I've not been in love before Myra Stratton. People say I'm gay.... I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> All I know is that I'm in love with Myra [...] I love her completely and {{want to spend the}} rest of my life with her." [...] Fox said that she had been reluctant to come out because, having already dealt with obsessed fans and stalkers, she feared fans' possible reactions. In 2009, she announced her plans to form a civil partnership with Stratton.|$|E

2500|$|Despite his {{financial}} problems and bankruptcy in 1987, Gwynn remained unfazed on the field. In the Padres home opener, Marvell Wynne, Gwynn, and John Kruk hit back-to-back-to-back homers {{to start the}} game for San Diego, the first time an MLB team had led off a game with three consecutive home runs. In June, he had 44 hits in 93 at-bats for a [...]473 average, the best month in his career. He finished fifth among NL outfielders voting for the All-Star game, which Padres manager Larry Bowa called [...] "a joke". However, Gwynn was unperturbed: [...] "People put a premium on the home-run hitters. I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> I’m a contact hitter and not a home-run hitter ... I’m {{not going to try}} to be something I’m not." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the time, {{the rebels}} {{had yet to}} {{completely}} surround Duchang, so Taishi Ci managed to sneak past the enemy at night and enter the fortress to meet Kong Rong. He asked Kong Rong to let him lead soldiers to fight their way out, but Kong refused and insisted on waiting for reinforcements. The rebels came closer day by day. Kong Rong wanted to seek help from Liu Bei, the Chancellor of Pingyuan State (平原國; around present-day Pingyuan, Shandong), {{but no one had}} any idea on how {{to break out of the}} siege. Taishi Ci volunteered to fight his way out and seek reinforcements from Liu Bei, but Kong Rong said, [...] "The rebels have completely surrounded the fortress. Everyone thinks it is impossible to break out. It will be very difficult for you to break out no matter how courageous you are." [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "When I was away, you treated my mother very generously. She feels grateful, hence she told me to help you. She knew that I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> doing, and that I can help you. Now, everyone says it is impossible to break out. If I were to agree with them, I will not be able to repay your kindness. Why, then, did my mother send me here for? We are in a very desperate situation. I hope you won't hesitate any longer." [...] Kong Rong agreed to let him break out of the siege.|$|E

6000|$|Don't--I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{going to}} say. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> an abject idiot, which, all things considered, is not remarkable.--Ever your affectionate and horrible atheist, ...|$|R

6000|$|Mrs. Fountain: [...] "So it <b>was.</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{thinking}} about; and I do {{beg your}} par-- But {{this is a}} man's bath-robe!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't complain. Of course <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> about. <b>I</b> {{suppose it}} won't be so very dull when {{everybody}} {{is up in}} London." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{bringing}} Helen to, and she didn't flinch," [...] said Sheppard, somewhat {{surprised at}} the tone in which the colonel spoke.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, are you hurt?" [...] Mrs. March implored. [...] "I'm {{sure you}} must <b>be</b> killed; and <b>I</b> did it! <b>I</b> don't <b>know,</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{thinking}} of!" ...|$|R
60|$|Indeed, <b>I</b> scarce <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing, but <b>I</b> obeyed; and as I did so I {{heard the}} firelocks bang and the balls whistle in the birches.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> about," [...] he said, {{with the}} same grim laugh at my folly. [...] "What is a man worth who has lost his self-command?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} you are really thinking, MacIan," [...] {{repeated}} Turnbull, laughing. [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> thinking, anyhow. And I rather fancy it's the same." ...|$|E
