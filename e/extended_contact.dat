25|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, the Stó:lō's by then <b>extended</b> <b>contact</b> with Europeans {{enabled them to}} learn about and get vaccinated for {{protection}} against smallpox. In 1862, the effects of another smallpox outbreak on the Stó:lō were limited in comparison with that related to northern indigenous people, {{because they had been}} inoculated with the vaccine. Although deadly smallpox epidemics broke out at least once more (and possibly in 1824 and 1862), it was, however, only {{one of a number of}} serious diseases that would strike the region. Measles, mumps, tuberculosis, influenza, and venereal diseases also caused high fatalities among the Stó:lō population.|$|E
25|$|Southland was a {{scene of}} early <b>extended</b> <b>contact</b> between Europeans and Maori, notably whalers and missionaries – Wohlers at Ruapuke. In 1853, Walter Mantell {{purchased}} Murihiku from local Maori iwi, claiming the land for European settlement. Otago, of which Southland was itself part, {{was the subject of}} planned settlement by the Free Church, an offshoot of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland. Settlement broadened with the discovery of gold in Central Otago in the 1860s. Today, traces of Scottish speech persist in Southland voices, with R often pronounced with a rolling burr.

500|$|Indigenous {{populations have}} been present in modern-day Maine for 11,000 years, with year-round {{occupation}} for 6,000 years. Burial sites associated with an Algonquian-speaking culture date back 5,000 years. The Wabanaki Confederacy, which included the Passamaquoddy and Penobscot tribes, also pre-dates European contact in the region. The Passamaquoddy may have had contact with Giovanni da Verrazzano in 1524, but their first <b>extended</b> <b>contact</b> with Europeans would have been with a short-lived settlement built on Dochet Island by Samuel de Champlain and Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons in 16041605. Research by Emerson Baker in 1989 uncovered over 70 extant deeds documenting private purchases of land from indigenous peoples by English-speaking settlers, the earliest dating to 1639. But, most Passamaquoddy lands [...] "remained {{beyond the reach of}} English settlers" [...] until the mid-18th century.|$|E

30|$|The {{transition}} from atomic stick-slip to continuous sliding {{has been observed}} {{in a number of}} ways. If <b>extended</b> <b>contacts</b> are moved in different directions, so-called structural lubricity is observed when the two surface lattices are non-matching. Alternatively, a “superlubric” state of motion can be achieved if the normal force is reduced below a certain threshold, the temperature is increased, or the contact is actuated mechanically. These processes have been partially demonstrated using atomic force microscopy, and they can be theoretically understood by proper modifications of the Prandtl-Tomlinson model.|$|R

2500|$|Bacterial {{conjugation}} is {{the transfer}} of genetic material between bacterial cells by direct cell-to-cell contact or by a bridge-like connection between two cells. [...] Bacterial conjugation has been extensively studied in Escherichia coli, but also occurs in other bacteria such as Mycobacterium smegmatis. Conjugation requires stable and <b>extended</b> <b>contact</b> between a donor and a recipient strain, is DNase resistant, and the transferred DNA is incorporated into the recipient chromosome by homologous recombination. E. coli conjugation is mediated by expression of plasmid genes, whereas mycobacterial conjugation is mediated by genes on the bacterial chromosome.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{winemaking}} {{decisions that}} can {{have a significant effect}} include the temperature of fermentation and what time, if any, that the wine allowed to spend aging on the lees. Burgundian winemaking tends to favor <b>extended</b> <b>contact</b> on the lees and even [...] "stirring up" [...] the lees within the wine while it is aging in the barrel in a process known as bâttonage. Colder fermentation temperatures produces more [...] "tropical" [...] fruit flavors like mango and pineapple. The [...] "Old World" [...] style of winemaking favors the use of wild, or ambient yeast, though some will also use specially cultivated yeast that can impart aromatic qualities to the wine. A particular style of yeast used in Champagne is the Prise de Mousse that is cultivated for use worldwide in sparkling Chardonnay wines. A potential drawback of using wild yeast is that the fermentation process can go very slow with the results of the yeasts being very unpredictable and producing potentially a very different wine each year. One Burgundian winemaker that favors the use of only wild yeast is Domaine des Comtes Lafon which had the fermentation of its 1963 Chardonnay batch take 5 years to complete when the fermentation process normally only takes a matter of weeks.|$|E
