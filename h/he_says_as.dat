500|$|Leslie sees Jeanine Restrepo (Loretta Fox), an {{influential}} zoning board member {{who could help}} Leslie with her plans to turn the Sullivan Street pit into a park. Leslie is too nervous to approach her, so she practices with Mark (Paul Schneider), who teasingly pinches her nose because <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>as</b> Jeanine, [...] "I can do whatever I want"; Ann pinches Mark's nose and Leslie pinches Ann's, and Mark summarizes, [...] "It's fun {{to pretend to be}} zoning board members." [...] Marlene suggests Leslie try sucking up to Jeanine in her speech, but it comes across awkwardly when Leslie claims to [...] "love" [...] Jeanine. When Leslie tries to approach her later, Jeanine suggests Leslie make an appointment with her secretary. Marlene says this means Jeanine is blowing them off, and tells Leslie to blackmail Jeanine with the knowledge that her husband has a DUI offense in Illinois. Leslie shares the advice with Ann, who says she believes it is unethical and wrong; offended, Leslie accuses Ann of pampering Andy. ("He's got three crutches, {{and one of them is}} you. And the other two are crutches.") Ann storms off.|$|E
500|$|The Initiative's {{goals are}} {{gradually}} made clearer. A recurring character {{since the second}} season is Spike (James Marsters), a mercenary vampire who has fought both against and with Buffy in the past, depending on what suits his interests. Recently wanting to kill Buffy, Spike is captured by the Initiative before he can get to her and implanted with a chip in his brain that causes intense pain if he tries to attack humans to feed on them, or even to fight them. Buffy begins enthusiastically training with the Initiative, {{spending more time with}} Riley, and trying to impress Dr. Walsh. At different times, Willow, Xander, and Giles caution Buffy that she does not know the Initiative's true motives and there are questions about their mission that are unanswered. Buffy begins asking questions during [...] "The I in Team". After being sent after a Polgara demon, a being with a skewer in its arm, she wants to know why the demon must be captured alive and unharmed as she is used to killing demons. Her questions at first confound Dr. Walsh—who answers to no one—then cement Dr. Walsh's decision to remove Buffy from the Initiative. After a botched attempt to kill Buffy, Dr. Walsh consoles herself by going into laboratory room 314 and speaking to her pet project, Adam who is laying on a table, apparently unconscious. Adam rises and impales Dr. Walsh with the skewer in his arm—the one taken off the Polgara demon. His first word is [...] "Mommy", which <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>as</b> Dr. Walsh falls to the floor, dead.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good morning, Mr. Smallweed, good morning!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>as</b> {{he comes}} in. [...] "You {{have brought the}} sergeant, I see. Sit down, sergeant." ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{feeling was}} mixed, too, {{with a feeling}} of his unworthiness, which deepened the more closely he studied her. She was so free from all bruise and stain of life's battle. There were no {{questionable}} places in her life. Could <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>as</b> much? ...|$|R
6000|$|Is <b>he</b> <b>saying,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> grimly laughs, {{and strikes}} his thirty-fives and forties: [...] "Bah! I know you, Time, godlike and dread though you seem. What are you but a phantom--a dream--like {{the rest of}} us here? Ay, less, for you will pass away and be no more. Fear him not, immortal men. Time is but the shadow of the world upon the {{background}} of Eternity!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But {{then you}} know, George, you behaved {{to him in}} the handsomest manner; <b>he</b> <b>says</b> so, <b>as</b> you do indeed to everybody; and this is your reward.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The displeasure of {{your grace}} {{is worse than}} death," [...] <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>as</b> he takes his {{overcoat}} and hat from {{a corner of the}} mantelpiece and leaves the room.|$|E
6000|$|... "And about,--about,--about what <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>as</b> to loving her, you know? There {{has been}} a sort of promise between them, Mr. Comfort, and no young man could have spoken more {{honestly}} than he did." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{must not}} stop here," [...] <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>as</b> Cummings {{comes to a}} halt by his side. [...] "Help the boys, and leave me here long enough to hold them in check until you have put {{considerable}} distance between the crowd and yourselves." ...|$|E
60|$|Before <b>he</b> had {{finished}} <b>saying</b> <b>as</b> much Mr. Britling was talking again.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you mean}} Mr. Edwards, yes; I believe <b>he</b> did <b>say</b> <b>as</b> much. Indeed, from his manner, {{he seemed to}} have monopolized all the love near the Village of Peace." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A hair of the {{dog that}} bit him," [...] <b>he</b> would <b>say</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> poured out the beer, {{carefully}} so that the foam should not make him wait too long to drink.|$|R
6000|$|... "Misther Thady, yer honer, Father John says as how he'll be glad av yer honer'll {{come down}} to dinner with him at six; and <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>as</b> how you must come, Mr. Thady, because divil a bit he'll ate himself, he says, till you're in it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So he says. He met {{the captain}} of that tramp vessel somewhere and got him {{interested}} in the hunt by promising him {{a share of the}} find. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>as</b> soon as he can get hold of a Spaniard who knows the exact location of the island he'll set sail." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oi be aveared, by what t' constable told me, as he won't be able vor {{to prove}} it. It seems as how he didn't get to Painton till t' morning. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>as</b> how he were awalking aboot on t' moor all night. So you see {{he will have}} hard work vor to clear hisself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mine moder," [...] was all <b>he</b> could <b>say,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> groaned heavily. In a {{few seconds}} he {{recovered}} with a start and bade {{the man in the}} bow paddle for his life.|$|R
50|$|Mystical Rose (2000), a dementing woman's {{prayer and}} life, has no literal basis in Scrimger's own {{past or present}} - except, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> insofar <b>as</b> we are all only one corner away from {{personal}} disintegration.|$|R
60|$|On {{this subject}} {{it was quite}} {{impossible}} that Belton should say anything. Clara was standing by him, and she, as he knew, was engaged to Captain Aylmer. So circumstanced, what could <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>as</b> to Clara's settlement in life? That something should be said {{between him and the}} old man, and something also between him and Clara, was a matter of course; but it was quite out of the question that he should discuss Clara's prospects in life in presence of them both together.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't mean {{to remain}} here, Mr Whittlestaff. It's just that as I'm coming to. There's Timothy Baggett is down there among the hosses, and <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>as</b> I am {{to go with}} him. So I've come up here {{to say that if}} he's allowed to sleep it off to-day, I'll be ready to start to-morrow." ...|$|E
60|$|The servant {{takes as}} little heed of what <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>as</b> {{she seems to}} take of what she has said herself. She draws off her glove to get some money from her purse. Jo silently notices how white and small her hand is and what a jolly servant she must be to wear such {{sparkling}} rings.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Let Mr Haredale go on,' said Gashford, upon whose unwholesome {{face the}} {{perspiration}} {{had broken out}} during this speech, in blotches of wet; 'I don't mind him, Sir John; it's quite as indifferent to me what <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>as</b> it is to my lord. If he reviles my lord, as you have heard, Sir John, how can I hope to escape?' ...|$|E
60|$|We {{hastened to}} assure the Professor that, in {{accordance}} with the high standards of honour represented by our journal, we should of course regard anything that <b>he</b> might <b>say</b> <b>as</b> ultramicroscopic and treat it accordingly.|$|R
60|$|As for Swedenborg's so costly book, Kant {{laughs at}} it. There {{is in it}} no evidence, only assertion. Kant ends, having pleased nobody, <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> and <b>as</b> ignorant as when he began, by citing cultivons notre jardin.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] <b>he</b> would <b>say,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> sat ponderously {{down with}} {{the air of a}} man opening an {{interesting}} conversation, [...] "I was just figuring it out that eleven months ago to-day I was in Pekin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I grieve to say, miss, {{that the}} servants, all but two, have given notice {{and want to}} leave the house today. They have talked the matter over among themselves; the butler has spoken for the rest. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>as</b> how they are willing to forego their wages, and even to pay their legal {{obligations}} instead of notice; but that go today they must." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What'll I {{do about}} Baggett, sir?" [...] said the poor woman, coming back. [...] "He's a lying {{there at the}} gate, and the perlice doesn't like to touch him because of you, sir. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>as</b> how if you could take him into the stables, he'd sleep it off among the straw. But then he'd be just as bad after this first go, to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>as</b> much {{himself in}} one of his letters to Bolingbroke:—“All my {{endeavours}} to distinguish myself were only for want of a great title and fortune, that I might be used like a lord by those who have an opinion of my parts; whether right or wrong is no great matter. And so the reputation of wit and great learning does the office of a blue ribbon or a coach-and-six.”(31) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{have you}} got to-day, Alf?" [...] <b>he</b> would <b>say,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> strolled over to the marquis. The name of the Chief was, I believe Alphonse, but [...] "Alf" [...] was near enough for Mr. Smith.|$|R
6000|$|Reverend Finch was {{suffering}} under a second suspension of speech. All <b>he</b> could <b>say</b> <b>as</b> {{we approached the}} door of the silent and solitary building--and he said that with extreme difficulty--was, [...] "Pray let us be careful!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not it, {{the little}} toad, but 'twas saving he as ricked her back somehow, {{and made her}} a cripple for life, as you see, ma'am; and she was six months in the hospital, till the doctor, <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>as</b> how <b>he</b> couldn't do nothing more for her, so Hewlett and me we took her in, as she is my own sister, you see, and we couldn't let her go to the workhouse, but she do want a little broth or a few extrys now and then, ma'am, more than we poor folks can give her." ...|$|R
6000|$|Plain {{practical}} rowing of the get-the-boat-along {{order is}} not a very difficult art to acquire, but it takes a good deal of practice before a man feels comfortable, when rowing past girls. It is the “time” that worries a youngster. “It’s jolly funny,” <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>as</b> for the twentieth time within five minutes he disentangles his sculls from yours; “I can get on all right when I’m by myself!” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How do you do," [...] he said, as {{he shook}} hands. [...] "Real {{glad to know}} you. Yes, I {{got a letter from}} John Laning, my brother-in-law, tellin' me all about you. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>as</b> how you want a guide fer these parts. Well, I don't want to brag, but I reckon I know the lay o' the land 'round here about as good as any o' 'em, and a heap sight better nor lots." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We shall all {{leave for}} Paris to-morrow, {{as early as}} possible," [...] <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>as</b> he finally takes leave of the General and the préfet, [...] "and take the money with us, of course. If the King--which God forbid!--is obliged to leave Paris, it will be most {{acceptable}} to him, until {{the day when the}} allies are once more in the field and ready to crush, irretrievably this time, this Corsican scourge of Europe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gentlemen--ladies and gentlemen," [...] <b>he</b> was <b>saying</b> <b>as</b> Burton entered, [...] "the next {{item on the}} {{catalogue}} is number 17, described as an oak chest, said {{to have come from}} Winchester Cathedral and to be a genuine antique." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My young master," [...] <b>he</b> was <b>saying,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{glanced at}} the letter he still held in his hand, [...] "tells me that any {{questions}} you may ask I may answer as freely as I am permitted to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>he</b> <b>says</b> it <b>as</b> partly {{believing that}} it is true. If it be true I will hang myself. There will be nothing left among men or women fit to live for. You think it shameful that I should love him." ...|$|R
