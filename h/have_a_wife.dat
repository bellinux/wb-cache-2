5|$|The story {{describes}} the romantic relationship between Annis Wychwood, a wealthy spinster, and Oliver Carleton, a rake who cares little for society's opinion of him. The two meet while jointly supervising Carleton's ward, Lucilla. Heyer granted her heroine {{a level of}} independence that was rare in Regency times and rare for Heyer's novels. Although the hero's personality {{is similar to that}} of many of Heyer's other heroes, in a departure from romance novel convention he experienced little personal growth in the novel; his primary change was to accept that he would like to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>wife.</b>|$|E
5|$|Generally, Banai's {{birth is}} not {{discussed}} in the folk songs. Few regard her as an avatar of the apsara (celestial nymph) Rambha, while others consider her {{as one of the}} seven daughters of Indra, the king of the gods. She is found by a Dhangar in a golden box in the forest, hidden in a termite mound or a pit. Her Dhangar father (sometimes named Yamu) is the chief of shepherds, who owns nine lakh sheep and goats, nine lakh lambs and numerous barren ones. Yamu is said to have prayed for a child and finds Banai in a box. A virgin ewe is said to have fed Banai her milk, as Yamu does not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> and does not know how to feed the infant. In another miracle, a three-storeyed house appears at the place of Yamu's tent for the young Banai to reside, {{while the rest of the}} Dhangars live in tents. She grows up as a rich shepherdess and becomes the overseer of twelve Dhangar vadas (pastoral settlements or camps, inhabited by different Dhangar clans). She cares for her sheep, grazes them and learns how to breed them.|$|E

25|$|Polygamy (specifically polygyny) {{had been}} practised in Chinese {{societies}} {{for thousands of}} years. Since the Han Dynasty, Chinese men {{have been able to}} legally have only one wife. It was common for privileged Chinese men to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> and various concubines, however. For those who could afford a dowry and support a family of multiple concubines and children, polygyny provided a better chance of issuing heirs. The importance of this was apparent in the imperial court, which usually housed hundreds of concubines. Aside from concubinage, having multiple wives with equal status was also accepted prior to the ban on polygamy.|$|E
25|$|The {{early history}} of Gil-galad is {{somewhat}} obscure, as Tolkien himself repeatedly {{changed his mind about}} who exactly Gil-galad was, and how to fit him into the already existing history of the First Age (see concept and creation, below). Gil-galad was certainly born in Beleriand {{at some point during the}} First Age. He was perhaps at some point sent to live in the Falas with Círdan the Shipwright, but this is unclear; certainly after the fall of Nargothrond he was living on the Isle of Balar with Círdan, and became the last High King of the Noldor following the fall of Gondolin and the death of Turgon. Gil-galad, despite his long life (he was born during the First Age and lived through almost the entirety of the Second), was not known to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>wife,</b> nor any children. Due to this, and the fact that there were few Noldor remaining in Middle-earth, the title of High King of the Noldor in Exile ended with his death.|$|E
500|$|Grimaldi met {{his future}} wife, Maria Hughes in 1796. [...] The eldest {{daughter}} of the proprietor of the Sadler's Wells theatre, Richard Hughes, Maria was introduced to Grimaldi by his mother, Rebecca Brooker, and a romance soon blossomed. [...] They married on 11 May 1799 and moved to 37 Penton Street, Pentonville. [...] Later that year, Grimaldi appeared in a succession of shows including A Trip to Scarborough (as a countryman) and Rule a Wife and <b>Have</b> <b>a</b> <b>Wife</b> (as a maid). [...] The roles he took in these productions were eccentric and usually reserved for low comedians. Despite this, he was praised for his characterisations and was deemed a player of legitimate adult roles at Drury Lane, which qualified {{him to become a}} member of the prestigious Drury Lane Theatrical Fund.|$|E

500|$|PedroII {{regarded}} {{the death of}} his son as [...] "the most fatal blow that I could ever receive, and certainly I would not have survived were it not that I still <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> and two children". The Emperor wrote to his brother-in-law Dom FernandoII, King-consort of Portugal: [...] "By the time you receive this, you will certainly have learnt of the grievous loss I have undergone... God who has made me pass though so hard a testing, will in his mercy give me grounds to console my sorrows." [...] PedroII had already lost another son, Dom Afonso, almost three years earlier. He revealed his inner turmoil in a sonnet: [...] "Twice already I have suffered death, for the father dies who sees his son is dead." [...] Except for brief inspection visits, the Emperor avoided Santa Cruz thereafter.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{were aware}} that Matthew Macfadyen would leave the series after playing Tom Quinn for two years, {{and they did not}} know whether he would return for the first two episodes. An eight- to nine-member team came up with the new character of Adam Carter. They wanted Adam to have a different dynamic than Tom; the producers set up a girlfriend/boyfriend storyline in the first series [...] with Adam, they wanted him to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> (Fiona Carter) who works in the Security Service, since married couples working in that environment are common. They wanted Adam to be more animated and energetic than Tom. Writer Howard Brenton wanted him to have an MI6 background, and have something awful happen to him in the past. Brenton invented the backstory of Syria early on into the third series, which he wanted to revisit in the fourth series.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2011, it was {{announced}} that Jackson would vacate the role due to the heavy amount of work he was receiving. TV Guide reported that Jackson attempted to negotiate with the network for a lighter schedule and to be repaired with on-screen love interest Herbst (Elizabeth), but was denied on both accounts. Jackson explained: [...] "I love to work hard but I've been at maximum capacity in terms of mental and emotional output for months on end and it has become too difficult. I am extremely thankful that they wanted to give me all those storylines with so much depth, but there's just no balance. (...) I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> and three kids and other things in life I have to think about. I just knew I couldn't sustain the schedule at GH and that kind of emotion for much longer. It was just too intense." [...] Jackson confirmed the character would not die or be recast, and last appeared the week of December 19, 2011.|$|E
2500|$|The first [...] "Woman Detective Constable" [...] was {{appointed}} in 1973. 1973 {{was also the}} year that the separate [...] "Women's Department" [...] was fully integrated into the Metropolitan Police. Female police officers did not get equal pay with male police officers until 1974. In 1976 the first [...] "Woman Chief Superintendent" [...] {{was appointed}} {{to take charge of}} a subdivision. In 1977 the first female traffic officer, Dee O’Donoghue, was hired. In 1979 the first female dog handler, Nicola Gray, was hired. Prior to this, women were prohibited from being dog handlers since rules stated that an officer should <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> who could look after a puppy while the officer went to work. In 1995 Pauline Clare became the first female chief constable, for Lancashire. The prefix [...] "Woman" [...] in front of female officers' ranks has been obsolete since 1999. In 2017 Cressida Dick became the first female Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Service and therefore the most senior Police Officer in England and Wales.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{passport}} check, the hijackers {{had discovered that}} an Algerian police officer was a passenger on the flight. To get the Algerian government to cave in, the hijackers came to the police officer {{and asked him to}} follow them. Kakachi recalled that the police officer, two rows behind her, was hesitant to follow the hijackers as {{he did not know what}} was going to happen. Several passengers recalled him pleading [...] "Don't kill me, I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> and child!" [...] The hijackers shot the police officer in the head on the top of the boarding stairs. The pilots and most of the passengers initially did not know that the Algerian police officer had been killed. Delhemme recalled that his first contact with the passenger cabin during the hijacking was when a flight attendant, allowed into the cockpit, asked the pilots if they needed anything. According to Delhemme, he asked for a glass of water from the attendant as the pilots' throats were parched and the pilots had difficulty swallowing. The attendant then whispered to the captain that the hijackers had already killed a passenger.|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Mani of She'ab (in Galilee), Rabbi Joshua of Siknin (also in Galilee), and Rabbi Johanan {{all said}} {{in the name of}} Rabbi Levi that Nadab and Abihu died because of four things, in {{connection}} with each of which Scripture mentions death: (1) Because they had drunk wine, for in connection with drinking wine [...] mentions death, saying, [...] "Drink no wine nor strong drink [...] [...] [...] so that you do not die." [...] (2) Because they lacked the prescribed number of garments (while officiating), for in connection with appropriate garments [...] mentions death, saying, [...] "And they [...] shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons [...] [...] [...] so that they bear no iniquity and die." [...] Nadab and Abihu lacked their robes (implied perhaps by the report of [...] that they their bodies were carried out in their tunics), in connection with which [...] mentions death, saying, [...] "And it shall be upon Aaron to minister [...] [...] [...] so that he does not die."
