40|$|Yttrium iron <b>garnet</b> <b>powders</b> {{have been}} {{synthesized}} by chemical coprecipitation using two different precursors, nitrates and chlorides, and by an oxides mixture route. It is shown that {{depending on the}} precursors and synthesis conditions used pure yttrium iron <b>garnet</b> <b>powders</b> can be obtained with a mono or multidomain magnetic behaviour. The yttrium iron garnet crystalline structure, as studied by Raman spectroscopy, was already formed after calcination at temperatures as low as 800 ºC when the nitrate precursors were used. However, calcination temperatures of up to 1100 ºC were required to obtain yttrium iron <b>garnet</b> <b>powders</b> when the precursors were chlorides or when the oxides mixture route was chosen. The saturation magnetization of the powders correlates well with the structural characterization: when nitrate precursors were used, the saturation magnetization was already close to the bulk value, 26. 8 emu/cc, after calcination at 800 ºC. However, the saturation magnetization of the powders obtained by the chlorides and oxides mixture routes was close to zero up to calcination temperatures of 1100 ºC. Finally, both the chlorides and the oxides mixture routes yield multidomain micro...|$|R

However, they cannot operate properly in real air because they contain highly unstable and volatile electrolytes. Here, we report the fabrication of solid-state Li-air batteries using garnet (i. e., Li 6. 4 La 3 Zr 1. 4 Ta 0. 6 O 12, LLZTO) ceramic disks with high density and ionic conductivity as the electrolytes and composite cathodes consisting of <b>garnet</b> <b>powder,</b> Li salts (LiTFSI) and active carbon. These batteries run in real air based on the formation and decomposition at least partially of Li 2 CO 3. Batteries with LiTFSI mixed with polyimide (PI: LiTFSI) as a binder show rechargeability at 200 degrees C with a specific capacity of 2184 mAh g(- 1) (carbon) at 20 mu A cm(- 2). Replacement of PI: LiTFSI with LiTFSI dissolved in polypropylene carbonate (PPC: LiTFSI) reduces interfacial resistance, and the resulting batteries show a greatly increased discharge capacity of approximately 20300 mAh g(- 1) carbon and cycle 50 times while maintaining a cutoff capacity of 1000 mAh g(- 1) carbon at 20 mu A cm(- 2) and 80 degrees C.

Nanocrystalline yttrium {{aluminium}} <b>garnet</b> (nYAG) <b>powder</b> has been synthesized via sol-gel and co-precipitation methods using nitrate precursors.

It was found that a complete transformation to nYAG was observed at 925 C/ 2 h and 1000 C/ 1 h for the coprecipitation and sol-gel samples respectively. An intermediate YAlO 3 phase was formed at 900 C in all powders regardless of the synthesis methods. The powder morphologies obtained from TEM revealed very similar particle sizes for the two routes (20 - 30 nm); whilst the extent of agglomeration was higher for the sol-gel method.

40|$|International audienceThe {{connectivity}} of FeS-melts in olivine and in {{a fertile}} peridotite matrix has been addressed through in-situ electric impedance spectroscopy (IS) measurements at 1 GPa. A first series of experiments used sintered powder samples of a fertile peridotite xenolith mixed with 5 - 15 vol% FeS of eutectic composition. The sheared high-T garnet peridotite with Mg# ∼ 0. 90 is composed of 60 vol% olivine, 15 % orthopyroxene, 5. 3 % clinopyroxene and 19 % <b>garnet,</b> the <b>powder</b> grain size was 20 - 30 μm, {{similar to the one}} employed by Yoshino et al. [2004]. For a second series, San Carlos olivine aggregates were used as solid matrix and 10 - 20 vol. % of eutectic FeS were added. For these, the average grain size was 3 μm, much smaller than in the experiments by Yoshino et al. [2003]. The powder mixtures of peridotite+FeS and olivine aggregates+FeS were first annealed for 2 - 5 days in a conventional piston-cylinder at 1 GPa and 950 - 970 °C. The electrical conductivity of samples has been measured using the impedance spectroscopy method in a BN-graphite-CaF pressure cell with concentric cylindrical electrodes made from Mo- or Re-foil (which corresponds to an oxygen fugacity close to the IW buffer). The results indicate that up to 15 vol% of FeS the melt phase does not built a stable interconnected network in a peridotite matrix, as was recently indicated by Walte et al. [2007]. The percolation threshold for a stable FeS network in olivine matrix lies at 17. 5 vol%, much higher the 6 vol% found by Yoshino et al. [2003]. Our result is in line with the high dihedral angles of typically 70 - 100 for Fe-S melts in mantle materials. The higher interconnectivity threshold of this study, as compared to previous studies [Yoshino et al. 2003, 2004; Roberts et al., 2007] is a result of our smaller starting grain sizes (for olivine) in combination with much longer run durations. Both these experimental conditions result in enhanced grain growth and thus to a higher degree of textural equilibration, leading to the occurrence of the time depending pinging off of Fe-S melt films in our texturally more mature experiments...|$|R
40|$|Transparent {{ceramics}} {{are becoming}} more and more important for two new types of applications. On the one hand in cases where high mechanical and thermal demands in combination with optical properties are required, on the other hand where the optical properties of transparent materials like glass are not sufficient e. g. in positronemission-tomography (PET) diagnostics. Most state of the art PET-scanners are using high-priced single crystals as scintillator material. The technological challenge is to replace single crystal by cost-efficient transparent ceramics. Producing transparent ceramics is ordered in synthesis of the powders and in manufacturing of these into transparent ceramics. The aim of this work was to synthesize single phase yttrium-alumina-and Luthetiumalumina- <b>garnet</b> (YAG, LuAG) <b>powders</b> partially doped with neodymium or praseodymium by four different synthesis routes (Pechini-synthesis, sol-gel-route, coprecipitation and solid state reactions). Additionally industrial LuAG and LuPO 4 powders were characterized and manufactured. The powders were processed as submicron- and nanopowders. Newly produced single-phase powders were homgenized with additions of sintering additives like tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and binders like polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Moulding the powders were carried out by unaxial pressing, cold isostatic pressing and in individual cases also by slip casting. The achieved green densities were in a range of 25 - 42 %. Examination of calcination behaviour leads to a calcination temperature of 1000 °C with 2 hours dwell time in air atmosphere. Only solid state reactions resulted into transparent YAG, YAG:Pr, LuAG, LuAG:Pr ceramics. Solid state reactions of nanopowders resulted in heterogeneously transparent samples. Ceramics made by powders of other synthetic routes gave nontransparent ceramics due to porosity and additional phases. Transmission measurements of the manufactured transparent ceramics showed in classical one step sintering and two step sintering program significant lower transmission than respectitive single crystals but similar transmission compared to ceramics reported in literature...|$|R
