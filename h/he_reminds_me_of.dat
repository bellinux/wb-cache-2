500|$|Russell Crowe {{originally}} {{auditioned for}} a different role in the film before Sharon Stone asked that the actor try for the lead male role. [...] "When I saw Romper Stomper (1992), I thought Russell was not only charismatic, attractive and talented but also fearless," [...] Stone reasoned. [...] "And I find fearlessness very attractive. I was convinced I wouldn't scare him." [...] Raimi found Crowe to be [...] "bold and challenging. <b>He</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> what we imagine the American cowboy to have been like." [...] On working with Raimi, Crowe later described the director as [...] "sort of like the fourth Stooge." ...|$|E
500|$|Development of Gaga's third studio album, Artpop, began {{shortly after}} the release of her second record, Born This Way (2011), and by the {{following}} year, the album's concepts were [...] "beginning to flourish" [...] as Gaga collaborated with producers Fernando Garibay and DJ White Shadow. In the meantime, the singer also worked with French disc jockey Madeon. This was his first experience collaborating with a vocalist face-to-face. On MTV News he clarified that he had [...] "always wanted to work with pop artists and my #1 on my list was Lady Gaga. So when I had the opportunity to do that, I was really thrilled." [...] Having mutual respect for each other's work, Gaga praised Madeon's production skills saying, [...] "He is so amazing. He has such an understanding of music at such a young age. <b>He</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> myself so much. He's obsessed, so obsessed with music." ...|$|E
500|$|In the meantime, Gaga {{also worked}} with French DJ Madeon. This was his first {{experience}} collaborating face-to-face with a vocalist. He clarified with MTV News that he had [...] "always {{wanted to work with}} pop artists and my #1 on my list was Lady Gaga. So when I had the opportunity to do that, I was really thrilled." [...] Madeon was associated with co-writing and co-producing three songs on Artpop, [...] "Venus", [...] "Mary Jane Holland" [...] and [...] "Gypsy". In August 2013, while being interviewed by French radio station, Fun Radio, Gaga confirmed that she had recorded [...] "Gypsy" [...] with Madeon and RedOne, as well as White Shadow. Having mutual respect for each others' work, Gaga praised Madeon's production skills saying, [...] "He is so amazing. He has such an understanding of music at such a young age. <b>He</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> myself so much. He's obsessed, so obsessed with music." [...] "Gypsy" [...] was described as Artpops most personal song, about travelling the world and the loneliness associated with it. The song showcases Gaga's fans as being the people with whom she feels at home.|$|E
60|$|I liked Nielsen's looks then. <b>He</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> Jim Emett, the Mormon giant to whom {{difficulties}} and obstacles were but spurs to achievement. Such men {{could not be}} defeated.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{meant no}} offence," [...] the recruit said. [...] "The man <b>he</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> had a queer history, and I suppose {{that is what}} put it into my head." ...|$|R
60|$|He was a sheet-anchor-man, {{an earnest}} Baptist, and was well known, {{in his own}} part of the ship, to be {{constant}} in his solitary devotions in the chains. <b>He</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> St. Anthony going out into the wilderness to pray.|$|R
500|$|In {{reviewing}} {{the first three}} episodes, The New York Times saw in [...] "prim, righteous Brother Justin [...] more of a caricature, but Clancy Brown finds ways to bring some subtle glints of personality to the role." [...] Time commented, [...] "Brother Justin {{comes across as a}} typical whited sepulcher [...] if there's one thing more trite than a dwarf in a surreal drama, it's a preacher with a dark side [...] and Brown's campy performance largely involves shouting 'Enough!' and 'No-o-o-o!' with horror-flick pathos." [...] Entertainment Weekly considered Brown's Brother Justin [...] "delightfully unsettling as the creepy evangelist taking his orders from the wrong superpower", and Variety thought Brown was doing [...] "a superb job straddling the line between stoic and menacing, and there are hints about his weaknesses, conveyed quickly with subtlety." [...] A season 1 DVD review by DVD Talk saw Clancy Brown's performance as [...] "nothing short of brilliant. [...] Brown also has a difficult task capturing the duality of Brother Justin, a man who presents a physically intimidating presence but who wants little more than to be a subdued and loyal servant of his Lord, and he succeeds on every level." [...] DVDverdict stated in a season 2 review that [...] "Brown's presence and charisma is dazzling; he is both likable and frightening. He is an actor {{with a great deal of}} range, and he uses all of it in this series." [...] Referring to Brown's portrayal as [...] "a man of God in Carnivale", the Los Angeles Times saw Brown's [...] "eyes always betray him as someone who, all things considered, would probably be happier caving in your skull and smoking a cigarette afterward than talking to you for another minute." [...] Time Magazine's James Poniewozik depicted the Boardwalk Empire character Nelson Van Alden (played by Michael Shannon) as [...] "such a histrionic, guilt-wracked, damnation-obsessed monster that <b>he</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> Brother Justin".|$|E
2500|$|He had the {{pleasing}} {{face and}} he was very virtuous. His speaking style was so delightful that people were not tired of hearing his words and his bright face was very charming. Khomeini said about him: «When I see him, <b>he</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> Allah.» ...|$|E
2500|$|Tubridy {{has been}} subject to {{commentary}} about his physical appearance. He {{describes himself as a}} [...] "young fogey". Podge and Rodge, a televised puppet chat show, commented on his [...] "stupid awkward eyes, <b>he</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> the undead" [...] and introduced him as [...] "South Dublin on a stick" [...] when he appeared on their TV show.|$|E
60|$|I saw Uriah {{watch her}} while she greeted us; and <b>he</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> an ugly and rebellious genie {{watching}} a good spirit. In the meanwhile, some slight sign passed between Mr. Micawber and Traddles; and Traddles, unobserved except by me, went out.|$|R
2500|$|In 2011 {{country music}} artist Brantley Gilbert {{paid tribute to}} LeDoux in his single [...] "Country Must Be Countrywide," [...] with the line [...] "From his Wranglers to his boots – <b>he</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> Chris LeDoux. With that Copenhagen smile, Country must be countrywide." ...|$|R

2500|$|Frawley's final on-camera {{performance}} was on October 25, 1965, {{with a brief}} cameo appearance in Lucille Ball's second television sitcom The Lucy Show in the episode [...] "Lucy and the Countess Have a Horse Guest". Frawley plays a horse trainer and Lucy comments: [...] "You know, <b>he</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> someone I used to know." [...] (Vivian Vance, who by then had left The Lucy Show except for an occasional guest appearance, {{does not appear in}} that episode.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film 4 stars out of 4, writing: [...] "Kill Bill, Volume 1 shows Quentin Tarantino so {{effortlessly}} and brilliantly {{in command of}} his technique that <b>he</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> a virtuoso violinist racing through 'Flight of the Bumble Bee'– or maybe an accordion prodigy setting a speed record for 'Lady of Spain'. I mean that as a sincere compliment. The movie is not about anything at all except the skill and humor of its making. It's kind of brilliant." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{willingness}} to play {{anywhere on the}} pitch has earned him the sobriquet El Ilusionista (The Illusionist), El Cerebro (The Brain), El Anti-Galáctico (a pun on Real Madrid players' nickname Los Galácticos), El Caballero Pálido (The Pale Knight) and most recently Don Andrés from the Spanish press. Zinedine Zidane also praised Iniesta, stating on the Spanish radio station Cadena COPE, [...] "Iniesta really impresses me. He's got so much influence in Spain's game. <b>He</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> myself." [...] Fernando Torres, Spain's striker, said, [...] "We've been playing together since we were 15 and I have never, ever seen him play badly." [...] He {{is widely regarded as}} one of the most respected and best midfielders of all time.|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{was nervous}} as hell," [...] says Fabian. [...] "I {{walked in and}} <b>he</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> a hippy-dippy kind of guy which I loved. He was cool, he was warm, he asked me a lot about my {{personal}} life, I guess to put me at ease." ...|$|R
60|$|The man didn't say a word. He {{seemed to}} be {{brooding}} on something. He {{was one of those}} silent men. <b>He</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> Joe, the old dog down the street at the grocer's shop, who lies at the door all day, blinking and not speaking to anybody.|$|R
60|$|He {{lifted a}} dish-cover, and helped {{his wife and}} daughter. His face was lined and fallen like an old man's after debauch, but his hand did not shake, and his voice was clear. As he worked to restore us by speech and action, <b>he</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> a grey-muzzled collie herding demoralised sheep.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{nonsense}} he talks!" [...] Cristel exclaimed. [...] "All mere fancy! <b>He</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> the {{old song}} called 'The Nervous Man.' Do you know it, Mr. Roylake?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Glad to know him,' says I, 'but in {{his present}} {{condition}} <b>he</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> the joke Shakespeare got off on Julius Cæsar. We might say about your friend: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh {{you meant}} Sir Luke Strett? Certainly he's a fine type. Do you know," [...] Susie continued, [...] "whom <b>he</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of?</b> Of our great man--Dr. Buttrick of Boston." ...|$|E
5000|$|The most calm-browed cricketer I have seen. <b>He</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> {{a master}} {{who gets the}} whole school to and from a picnic without losing his reason or a boy. Of all the protagonists in that fiercest {{controversy}} bodyline, I should say that he alone {{came out of it}} with reputation heightened and personal friendships increased. He neither concealed nor exaggerated a difficulty.|$|R
60|$|I {{listened to}} this {{plausible}} explanation with interest, but, {{at the same}} time, with doubts of the lasting nature of the lady's submission to circumstances; suggested, perhaps, by the constraint in the Minister's manner. It was well {{for both of us}} when we changed the subject. <b>He</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> the discouraging view which the Doctor had taken of the prospect before him.|$|R
60|$|On {{returning}} to our places, I mechanically moved my chair away from the table. My mind was by this time {{in such a state}} of confusion and uncertainty about what it would be best for me to say or do next, that I forgot for the moment the position he had assigned to me when we lit the candles. <b>He</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> this directly.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, {{it is from}} an old {{lawyer at}} Bath whom I used to know. <b>He</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> {{something}} I said to him {{four or five years}} ago--some little time before we were married--about Dorothy.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not wish}} to hear about my uncle at Tanis. <b>He</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> too many things that give pain, and there are nights when one wishes to escape pain, which is sure to be found again on the morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look at Shields," [...] said Mr. Spence. [...] "He {{might be}} posing for a statue {{to be called}} 'Despair!' <b>He</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> Macduff. Macbeth, Act iv., somewhere near the end. 'What, all my pretty chickens, at one fell swoop?' That's what Shields is saying to himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had {{not long}} to wait. He was in liquor {{again the next}} day, and the next. Hearing this, Mr. Bapchild {{instructed}} me to send him the letter from my husband's brother. <b>He</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> {{some of the stories}} about my husband which I had refused to believe in the time before I was married; and he said it might be well to make inquiries.|$|R
60|$|I awakened late. Banks {{was already}} there to dress me, to congratulate me as discreetly as a well-trained servant should; nor did <b>he</b> <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> {{the fact that he}} had offered to lend me money, for which {{omission}} I liked him the better. In the parlour I found the captain sipping his chocolate and reading his morning Chronicle, as though all his life he had done nothing else.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{because you}} don't know him. He's an enthusiast about ideas, and {{careless}} about outward things. <b>He</b> often <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> the Apostle Paul." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't. Besides, it {{made him}} seem so ridiculous, and--I don't know why it is--I can't forgive a man for looking ridiculous. Thank goodness, my darling Sam couldn't look ridiculous, even if he tried. He's wonderful, Jane. <b>He</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> a knight of the Round Table. You ought to see his eyes flash." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ay; {{anybody can}} {{be what you}} call graceful, if he lives a little time in a city, and keeps his eyes open. And he might have picked up his gentlemanliness {{by going to the}} {{galleries}} of theatres, and watching stage drawing-room manners. <b>He</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> one of the worst stories I ever heard in my life.' ...|$|E
60|$|The author, then, {{was an old}} fellow. I {{think we}} might learn as much from the story. An old man he was, or a man who felt old. Do you know whom <b>he</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of?</b> Why, of Mr. Bowes, of the Theatre Royal, Chatteris; of Mr. Bowes, that battered, old, kindly sentimentalist who told his tale with Mr. Arthur Pendennis.|$|E
60|$|Edward's Italian is (I fear) very weak. When {{we began}} to get really into the language, <b>he</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> poor Roche in Germany. But {{he seems to have}} picked up a little this morning. He has been unfortunate with the unlucky Egg, leaving a pair of his shoes (his {{favourite}} shoes) behind in Paris, and his flannel dressing-gown yesterday morning at Domo d'Ossola. In all other respects he is just as he was.|$|R
60|$|We found Mr. Enderton {{standing}} by himself. His face {{was of the}} hue of wood ashes, his expression haggard. <b>He</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> {{a man who had}} fallen from a considerable height, and who had been frightened and stupefied by the shock. I comprehended the situation without difficulty, and felt quite sure that had he had the choice he would have much preferred a thrashing to the plain talk he had heard from Mrs. Lecks.|$|R
6000|$|... "An ill-conditioned fellow, our host," [...] <b>he</b> said--"quite <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> {{our friend}} Brogard at the Chat Gris in Calais. You {{remember}} him, Lady Blakeney?" ...|$|R
