30|$|Chapter one, “Language, Learning and ‘Educational Knowledge’”, aims to {{demonstrate}} that the process of learning is itself a linguistic process. To do that, Halliday traces back to {{the very beginning of the}} learning process, the ontogenetic beginning of a human child. By observing how a human infant develops his own protolanguage, Halliday is able to show that a child not only uses language to express, but also to act, the two functions corresponding to what he calls the ideational and <b>interpersonal</b> <b>metafunctions</b> of language. The linguistic and the learning ability of the child keep developing until he meets a new challenge when he goes to school: the transition from “commonsense knowledge” to “educational knowledge”.|$|R

40|$|In {{homage to}} the work of Uroš Mozetič, the paper takes as its {{starting}} point previously developed suggestions about how the language of “Eveline” conveys a picture of the heroine as a passive, paralysed character. Using Hallidayan Systemic Functional Linguistics as a model of stylistic analysis, it investigates the contribution of both the ideational and the <b>interpersonal</b> <b>metafunctions</b> to the meaning of the text. The results extend and amend some ideas from the literature, such as the supposed prevalence of stative verbs, and suggest that while the short story as a whole predominantly uses material processes, their potential for change is mitigated by Joyce’s aspect, tense, and usuality choices. Eveline as the main character crucially has the role of a Senser, observing and internally reacting to the world around her, and even the processes in which she acts upon things and people are modalised and shown to be either hypothetical or instigated by others...|$|R
30|$|As {{mentioned}} above, the <b>interpersonal</b> <b>metafunction</b> {{focuses on}} language {{as an element}} of dialogic exchange, and {{it is assumed that}} all languages possess resources for the exchange of meanings, either by means of propositions (exchange of information) or proposals (exchange of goods-&-services). SFG proposes a relationship between the modes of meaning of the three metafunctions and their respective modes of expression. As regards the <b>interpersonal</b> <b>metafunction,</b> its mode of meaning is enactment, and its mode of expression is prosody, i.e. the organization of grammatical structure “characterized as running across more than one constituent” ((Matthiessen 2007): 778 : Matthiessen et al. 1987 : 33). The various systems that make up the system network of MOOD in BH serve to enact tenor relations between interactants in dialogue in the Hebrew text. The following edited dialogue 3 will serve as a point of departure for the discussion of the basic speech functions and their realization in the Mood structure of the Hebrew clause. The dialogue begins when Saul and a servant are sent to look for his father’s lost asses.|$|E
40|$|In {{systemic}} functional {{approach to}} <b>interpersonal</b> <b>metafunction,</b> Halliday defines clause {{as a unit}} of exchange, with two main constituents called Mood and Residue. Mood (sometimes called Modal element) which is the main element of clause in process of meaning exchange realizes selection of mood in clause, and it is composed of Subject and Finite. Subject is invested with modal responsibility whereas finite realizes primary tense and modality. Drawing upon theoretical framework outlined above, present research explores <b>interpersonal</b> <b>metafunction</b> of gender talk in ELT classrooms. Objective is to determine different clausal structures (Declaratives, Integratives, Imperatives and Exclamatives) used by interlocutors with different genders using Azeri as their mother tongue, Farsi (Persian) and English as their second and foreign languages respectively. This research uses oral form of teacher-student interaction in classroom context as its corpus. About twelve hours of oral conversation between students and teachers from eight randomly selected classrooms are recorded and transcribed, resulting to 3288 clauses. Our findings show that dominant Mood used by both genders is declarative of third person simple present tense causing the process of meaning exchange to be one-sided and partial. Reconstructing clausal structures used by different genders in ELT classrooms may result into students’ high language proficiency in bilingual context of situation...|$|E

The interactants in any particular dialogue all contribute to its creation, “tak[ing] turns at this interactive process, each time adopting a speech role and assigning a complementary one to the other” ((Halliday & Matthiessen 2014): 15).|$|E

40|$|The {{globalization}} {{of higher education}} has been greatly accelerated in the 21 st century. International student recruitment not only enriches cultural diversity but also provides huge revenue to education providers. This study is a written discourse analysis of the introductory pages of university prospectuses in the two culturally distinct institutional contexts of Hong Kong and the United Kingdom. Applying Bhatia’s (1993) model of applied genre analysis, a five-move generic structure has been identified in 14 selected introductory pages which display evidence of interdiscursivity “with elements of advertising and other promotional genres” (Fairclough, 1993 : 146). The introductory pages are established as a hybrid promotional genre sharing a recognisable set of three communicative purposes: persuading, welcoming and informing. Halliday’s (1994) functional grammar approach is adopted to closely examine how the introductory pages represent the experimental and <b>interpersonal</b> <b>metafunctions</b> of language by analysing the grammar of clauses (with a focus on transitivity) and allocation of social roles (with a focus on personal pronouns). Although there are variations shown in move structures, promotional strategies and linguistic and multimodal resources, both Hong Kong and British universities tend to maintain a common institutional role and most irregularities are due to “organisational differences ” (Bhatia, 1999 : 27). Individual universities push out the generic boundaries to fulfil private intentions so as to stand out from their regional or international counterparts. It is hoped that the recommendations for writing prospectuses can be applied effectively and extended to other related advertising genres to help universities and international educational organisation produce better promotional texts which target their intended audience...|$|R
40|$|Well {{established}} {{in the history of}} Deaf studies is the existence of two opposing perspectives of d/Deaf people, widely known as the cultural view and the medical view (Lane, 1995, 1999; Lane, Hoffmeister & Bahan, 1996). These perspectives, born from a sociological foundation, discuss society’s understanding of d/Deafness, be that as a cultural and linguistic minority or as pathology. Although these perspectives are quite well contested in society, both by the Deaf community and medical professionals, there has been little to no attention paid to the linguistic realizations of such ideologies. This study aims to fill that gap by engaging in a robust research design in order to discover the very intricacies of those realizations. It presumes that a difference in reference term (d/Deaf vs. hearing-impaired) can spark a particular discourse, one that serves the agenda of the ideology within which it is grounded. I argue that a multi-layered discourse analysis fixed in the tradition of Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) (Halliday, 1985; 1994; 2014) will reveal the ways in which these ideologies are nestled in discourse. Investigating the ideational and <b>interpersonal</b> <b>metafunctions</b> through a series of methods, such as transitivity (Halliday, 2014; Thompson, 2004), social actor representation (van Leeuwen, 1996), appraisal (Martin, 1999; Martin & White, 2005), as well as through a corpus analysis, will provide insight as to how these ideologies are woven into discourse to build a particular reality of d/Deaf people and how such a reality, or representation in this case, is evaluated and negotiated through discourse. My claim is that these analytical tools are the way in which linguistic realizations of ideologies concerning d/Deaf people can be parsed out and explained, in a CDA (Fairclough, 1989, 1992) sense, bringing to light the discursive mechanisms used to represent d/Deaf people as a cultural minority or disabled people...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{to report on}} teachers’ ability in {{composing}} expository texts. The texts were composed by six high school teachers in Bandar Lampung, Lampung, Indonesia. This study is a descriptive qualitative case study investigating three Analytical and three Hortatory Expository texts. Those texts were analyzed using Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) {{to deal with the}} textual, experiential and <b>interpersonal</b> <b>metafunctions</b> which were exposed within the texts’ Theme, Transitivity and Mood systems. The results of texts analyses then were confirmed and validated through interviews conducted with the teachers. The result of this study shows that the teachers could demonstrate appropriate strategies to compose the texts although some problems of writing were evident in the texts. The grammatical analyses indicate that the writers had successfully attempted to use some of the main conventions of written argumentative discourse. In this case, to construe textual metafunction, the teachers could employ the demands of the generic form of arguing genre, the linguistic devices as well as the thematic progression. Furthermore, referring to experiential metafunction, the teachers could demonstrate their ability to use various linguistic resources such as appropriate conjunction system and appropriate Process types, Circumstantials and Nominalisations. Finally, interpersonally, the writers could enrich the text with the use of appropriate Modality to create objective arguments and communicate with the readers. However, the study reveals that not all of the teachers’ texts can be considered successful or mature texts in that they seem to have problems with Argument development characterized with lack of fact and objective evidence, inconsistency of argument, and absence of intertextuality. Besides, the inappropriate use of imperative mood, realis/universal statements and some syntax errors are also found. It is found that the teachers’ problems were mainly to do with their time management to carry out the task which resulted in their inability to give maximum efforts to work with the texts. In addition their background knowledge and language competence as well as their commitment to carry out the task also appeared to be problems in producing the texts. Thus, the teachers are suggested to commit to more practices and to have effective teacher trainings to maintain and improve the teachers’ professional competence particularly to concern the issue of SFL and GBA within the curriculum...|$|R

Discussion [...] 8. Conclusions [...] AppendicesIn the world today, the demand for English teachers is growing exponentially in wide-ranging contexts and for numerous purposes. Despite this demand, teachers who do not speak English as their first language continue to experience bias in hiring and in the workplace even when they are well-qualified. In the United States, where the immigrant population has grown and continues to grow significantly, TESOL programs are also scurrying to meet the demand for ESL teachers. The teacher learners themselves form a diverse pool of native (NES) and nonnative English (NNES) speakers with various backgrounds in language learning. This qualitative study delved into the academic writing of the NES and NNES participants, who were enrolled in a Master's in Education/TESOL program in New York. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to investigate their literacy development and language learning to add to the growing body of research in this area, specifically to discover more about the background and needs of NESs and NNESs in teacher preparation programs. [...] This study explored the nature of literacy and language development among NES and NNES teacher learners through an analysis of surveys and a two-pronged textual analysis, which involved a thematic content analysis and a Hallidayan Systemic Functional Linguistic (SFL) analysis of the literacy and linguistic autobiographies that the participants wrote as part of their coursework. Specific observer perspectives offered within the SFL framework, in particular the experiential and <b>interpersonal</b> <b>metafunctions,</b> were used as tools to discover how the participants construed and negotiated their experiences of language and literacy. SysConc, an SFL concordancing tool, aided in the selection of targeted clause complexes with the pronominal "I" and words related to literacy, including read, write, listen, speak, book, language, and learn. [...] The interpretation of the data indicated that literacy learning and language development are complex, interactive, and sometimes emotionally charged processes, about which the participants often expressed themselves through non-assertive lexicogrammatical choices. The comparison of data also revealed the people who most influenced the participants' language development, and the similarities and differences among their writings from the standpoint of grammatical intricacy. The research has implications for the development of literacy and the training of teachers of English. Mode of access: World Wide Web. 1 online resource (xvii, 413 pages) colour illustration...|$|R
40|$|O objetivo desta dissertação de mestrado é o exame linguístico, de cunho crítico, do processo de idealização do herói do romance As Minas de Prata, de José de Alencar. É reconhecida a importância da língua no processo de construção da obra literária, mas, na prática, a língua tem recebido um tratamento relativamente pequeno, justamente em uma área em que tem papel essencial. As Minas de Prata, obra publicada em meados do século XIX, no contexto da independência política do Brasil, como parte de um projeto {{cultural}} e político, revela esforços do seu autor para construir um herói que represente valores ideais para a comunidade brasileira nascente. A idealização diz respeito ao uso de certas escolhas linguísticas culturalmente contextualizadas, mostrando certos fatos ao mesmo tempo em que se ocultam outros, como forma de orientar a construção de sentido por parte dos leitores; será examinada linguisticamente em termos da Avaliatividade, um sistema que trata do posicionamento do escritor em relação à mensagem e ao interlocutor, em termos de: Afeto, Julgamento ético de pessoas e Apreciação estética de objetos, proposto pela Gramática Sistêmico- Funcional (GSF). Essa teoria permite fazer a relação entre a microestrutura linguística do texto alencariano com a macroestrutura do discurso, em que se encontra a idealização, e assim o faz apoiando-se nos três significados simultâneos construídos pela linguagem: a informação, a interação e a construção do texto. A GSF inclui em seu bojo a Linguística Crítica, para a qual, qualquer aspecto da estrutura linguística carrega significação ideológica. A pesquisa responde às seguintes perguntas: (a) Como se realiza a idealização do herói em As Minas de Prata? (b) Que escolhas léxicogramaticais são feitas, em termos das Metafunções Ideacional e Interpessoal para expressar essa idealização? Os resultados mostram a realização da idealização pela construção, por meio de escolhas léxico-gramaticais, de um herói que personifica valores ideais: amor, religiosidade e fidalguia de caráter; e pela proposição desses valores à comunidade, por meio do vínculo que se estabelece entre ela e o heróiThe {{main purpose}} of this work is the critical linguistic examination of the hero idealization process in the novel As Minas de Prata, written by José de Alencar. The importance of language in a literary work building process is well recognized but, in practice, the language has received relatively little treatment {{in an area that}} plays an essential role. As Minas de Prata, work published in mid-nineteenth century, {{in the context of the}} political independence of Brazil, as part of a cultural and political project, reveals its author's efforts to build a hero that represents optimal values for Brazilian developing community. The idealization concerns the use of certain culturally contextualized linguistic choices showing some facts while hiding others in order to guide the reader s construction of meaning. It will be linguistically examined in terms of Appraisal, a system that deals with the writer's position in relation to the message and to the caller considering: Affection, Ethical Judgment of People and Assessment Aesthetic of Objects, proposed by Systemic Functional Grammar (SFG). This theory allows the relationship between linguistic microstructure of Alencar s text and the macro-structure of the speech, in which idealization appears, and is supported by the three simultaneous meanings constructed by language: information, interaction, and text construction. The SFG includes the Critical Linguistics for which any aspect of linguistic structure carries ideological significance. The study answers the following questions: (a) how does the idealization of the hero in As Minas de Prata is carried out? (b) What lexicogrammatical choices are made in terms of Ideational and <b>Interpersonal</b> <b>Metafunctions</b> to express this idealization?

This paper provides answers to the questions, namely (1) how is mood of text using Waijewa language, and  (2) how does mood realize metafunction of interpersonal meaning in text? Based on Sistemic Functional Linguistic (SFL) theory, the mood text in this paper is viewed from mood system, modality, mood structure, and <b>interpersonal</b> <b>metafunction</b> of meaning. This paper used spoken data collected from the observation  of four sessions of proposing to a girl or in Waijewa language called Kette Katonga Weri Kawendo hereon abbreviated to KKWK, practiced in Wewewa society. Based on the data analysis, it is found out that mood system in text consists of indicative and imperative. The indicative covers declarative and interrogative. The declarative consists of exclamation and affirmative. The affirmative type is the most used which consisted of   2. 596 (83 %) use. This is caused by clauses repetition used by tenors. Whereas, exclamative is the least used which consists of 37 (1. 2 %) use. This fact indicates that the tenor should keep his background social prestice. The predicate are either followed or preceded by modality. Modalisation were used by groom’s parents, whereas modulation were used by bride’s parents. Mood structure of affirmative is S^P;  exclamative is EW^S^P;  imperative is  P^C/ C^P; yes/no interrogative is P^S) / (P^C) /  (S^P); and wh-interrogative is QW^ P^S.  Interpersonal metafunction of meaning aims to get information, give information, and to state opinion of decision made, such as choosing mediators, stating and requesting the amount of dowries, stating time for completing dowries, {{time to take the}} bride to groom’s place, and time for bride and groom to get marry. </p...|$|E

As a medical text is delocated and relocated from one institutional context to another, transformations take place with regard to: the ideational options of tense, transitivity and process, the interpersonal options of modality and speaker's comment, and its rhetorical organization. These transformations constitute the codes of the pedagogic device. These operate as a symbol system having two ideological effects.

The semantic system associated with these factors of interpersonal communication is referred to as SPEECH FUNCTION, which simultaneously realizes the three systems of MOVE, INITIATING ROLE, and COMMODITY. This semantic system creates meanings related to the contextual variable of tenor, and these meanings are realized on the stratum of lexicogrammar by means of the MOOD system.

The methods that writers of these guides employ are analysed within the context of metadiscourse, and the discussion focuses on whether or not these methods are effective. Qualitative text analyses are used along with a descriptive approach to evaluate the <b>interpersonal</b> and textual <b>metafunctions</b> in the texts. Elements that are identified in the research can be used in future analyses of similar academic texts which are aimed at students. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|After {{introducing}} {{the notion that}} meaning-making during reading includes both inter-personal and intra-personal meaning-making and exploring several issues raised by any attempt to research this activity, a number of gaps are identified in the current model of the reading transaction, arising largely from Rosenbla~t's only-partial adoption of concepts from Peirce. Wiley's re-focusing of Peirce's theories of meaning and the dialogical self is then used as a starting-point for the modification of the transactional model {{and a variety of}} disciplinary perspectives are drawn on to propose ways in which the transactional model might encompass multimodal intra- and inter-personal dialogical meaning-making activity. After an account of the case study, selected semiotic resources are analyzed as instances of multimodal intra-personal, dialogical meaning-making activity embedded in higher-scalar ecosocial systems of interpretance and constituted by ideational, <b>interpersonal</b> and textual <b>metafunctions.</b> An attempt is úthen made first to demonstrate the multimodality of intra-personal meaning-making activity through the exploration of descriptions of meaning-making activity involving sound, and then to examine the role of emotion in intra-personal meaning-making. After a consideration of the role of genre in readers' responses, differences in the same reader's responses to different texts, the generic and ideological nature of different readers' responses to the same texts and some issues n;lated to the development of response over time are explored. The findings of the case study are then outlined, its strengths and weaknesses assessed and directions for future research and practice explored.

Literary corpus stylistics can use corpus linguistic methods to test claims made by literary critics and identify hitherto unnoticed features. Existing literary studies of soliloquies tend to define and classify them, to trace the history of the form or to offer literary appreciation; yet they pay surprisingly little attention to the language which characterises soliloquies. By creating a soliloquy corpus and a dialogue corpus from 37 Shakespeare plays, and comparing the former against the latter using WordSmith Tools, I identify key language forms in soliloquies. Using an analytical framework broadly based on Halliday’s ideational, <b>interpersonal</b> and textual <b>metafunctions</b> of language, I interpret my results and relate them, where possible, to literary critical interpretations. I also compare comedy, history and tragedy soliloquy corpora. My main findings show the following linguistic features to be characteristic of soliloquies in general: words relating to mental states and the body; pragmatic noise; linking adverbials and first-person pronouns. Characteristic forms in comedy, history and tragedy emphasise love, the monarch and the supernatural respectively. The empirical evidence presented here shows that Shakespeare regularly exploited certain language forms in soliloquies to represent expressions of doubt, resolve, introspection and strong emotion, among others. These forms not only add depth to characterisation, aid plot development and provide performance cues for actors, but may also conform to certain audience expectations...|$|R

Directivity is approached as a social, interactional and linguistic {{phenomenon in the}} participants ’ sequences of email message initiations and responses. The contextual analysis focuses on 147 emails appearing in different message chains initiated by emails conveying a request for action. The study investigates how directives are realized lexico-grammatically and which contextual functions the diverse manifestations serve in different messages. The study also aims {{to find out how}} the interactants ’ roles are established, maintained and re-established through different directive realizations, and how different participants are linguistically engaged in the on-going sequences of interactions. A transmethodological approach is used to analyze the email interaction. The linguistic analysis draws from a functionaldialogic approach and the intaractants ’ directive behaviour is analyzed through the lens of the grammatical systems of mood and modulation within the <b>interpersonal</b> <b>metafunction.</b> Theoretically, the study aims to test the applicability o...|$|E

The teaching {{is based on the}} concept that language as a system of choice by which writers can communicate certain functions that allow them to express their experiences, to interact with others, and to create coherent message. Consequently, systemic functional grammar which views language as a strategic, meaning-making resource is implemented. However the facts show students of English Department have limited knowledge on it. Their average score is unsatisfactory, below 70. The objectives of the research are to describe (1) the students’ mastery on <b>interpersonal</b> <b>metafunction,</b> experiential metafunction, and textual metafunction; and (2) to describe the classroom implementation of systemic functional grammar course. This naturalistic study is conducted at English Department. The subjects of this research are one lecturer and 30 students taking structure 3 course. Data are collected through classroom observation and relevant documentation. The result indicates that students’ mastery of systemic functional grammar is low.

40|$|Masters of ArtThere {{has been}} a great deal of {{research}} exploring Halliday’s (1978, 1994, 2004) Systemic Functional Linguistic (SFL) approach. However, there has been little work that specifically targets SFL to explore African discourse. Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) views language as “social semiotic”, that is, language is functional in terms of what it can do or what can be done with it; and semantic in that it is used to make meanings (Halliday’s, 1978). This study explores SFL to analyse narratives of identity as told by Yoruba students at three Western Cape Universities: University of the Western Cape (UWC), University of Cape Town (UCT) and University of Stellenbosch (SUN). This research is both quantitative and qualitative in outlook and results of the study are presented. I used the qualitative method to collect and analyse the data; but a certain amount of quantitative analysis was presented as well in order to determine the predominant identity options favoured by the students. A total of 14 Yoruba students were interviewed for data collection which was analysed with SFL <b>interpersonal</b> <b>metafunction</b> theoretical approach. Specifically, the study examines linguistic choices that the students utilize to maintain and reconstruct their identities in Cape Town. This concentrates on the aspects of Mood component combining Subject and Finite element, Residual component comprising Predicator, Complement and Adjunct as well as Modality in participants’ narratives. Besides, an important aspect of the study was the consideration given to ethical issues. Analyses are presented on tables showing the frequencies of the interpersonal elements as configuration for preference use of different Subjects, Finites, Predicators, Complement and Adjuncts to either strengthen or weaken positions. Equally, the metaphorically expressions of objectivity to highlight the continuities and contradictions in the students’ narratives of identity in the diaspora was considered. These serve as interpersonal elements used by participants for stylizing and personalizing different identities options. Also, the study presents how the students organize their message for cohesion/coherence in their narratives. Thus, SFL establishes how the linguistic choices of the students reflect identity options in their new environment. The study shows the strengths of systemic-functional approach in its integration of what the students said, with what they might mean within the situation in which they said them. Finally, I conclude that these elements of <b>interpersonal</b> <b>metafunction</b> framework make participants’ narratives coherent while revealing the different identities they appropriated in the diaspora...|$|E
40|$|A problem arose {{during a}} study aiming to {{investigate}} affordances of professional, academic and regulatory discourses for mathematics teachers describing their own classroom practices. One {{aim was to}} seek each teacher’s own choice of words so an approach was adopted to help the researcher avoid putting words into participants’ mouths. As a result, the teachers’ accounts were initially tentative, role relationships were negotiable and language choices took longer to make. What challenges are there for researchers seeking mathematics teachers’ accounts of their own classroom practices? How can relationships be established {{during the early stages}} of research without the researcher putting words into the teachers’ mouths? Is it possible to elicit original and authentic accounts and what, if anything, might originality and authenticity mean in this context? Initial fieldwork involved observing and videoing lessons and interviewing the teacher afterwards using the video as stimulus. Video aided recall was used to limit the need for the interviewer to introduce language in order to seek descriptions. This was important for the research to avoid inadvertently introducing discourses not chosen by the teacher. I adopt a perspective on language as social semiotic (Halliday, 1978). The analytical framework of systemic functional linguistics seeing language as having ideational, <b>interpersonal</b> and textual <b>metafunctions</b> is useful. Paying attention to the ideational function offers insights into the agency of speakers in their constructions of experience. Paying attention to the interpersonal function offers insights into the relationships between participants in the interview (researcher and teacher). Paying attention to the textual function offers insights into how purpose emerges over time. This research with mathematics teachers in London, England will be relevant for any subject teachers in any country where teachers have a range of discourses to navigate when articulating their practices in different situations with different people for different purposes. It was found that, at least for these teachers, notions of originality and authenticity in accounts of classroom practices must be expressed with nuance to be meaningful. The analysis reveals that accounts are contingent on institutional settings, relationships between participants and reflexively on language choices. HALLIDAY, M. A. K.

40|$|Current policy {{mandates}} that emergent bilingual (EB) students partake in standardized assessments {{before they are}} fully proficient in English. Additionally, standardized assessments are quickly converting to an online administration. The increase in design features inherent in computer-based assessments will most likely {{increase the number of}} construct-irrelevant factors and affect the accessibility of assessment items for EBs. This study used frequency analyses, descriptive statistics, item semiotic complexity measures, Spearman’s rank-order correlation, one- and two-way analysis of variance, and Chi-square test of independence to examine the semiotic components and complexity of items included in a Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium Grade 8 practice test, and how the semiotic features of the items affected non-EB and EB students as they solved four of the items. Results indicate that the SBAC items have different ideational, <b>interpersonal,</b> and textual <b>metafunctions</b> as well as intersemiotic relations than items in curriculum resources. The average item semiotic complexity was approximately 69 components, indicating that students had to correctly interpret, as intended by the item writers, 69 different constituents to answer an item correctly. Regardless of language group, students’ reported actions and thinking involved very few semiotic components or intersemiotic relations belonging to the test items. For all items combined, EBs had a higher total cognitive load than non-EBs. As item semiotic complexity increased, EBs’ scores decreased while non-EBs’ scores remained constant once a certain item semiotic complexity level was reached. Results indicate that as cognitive load decreased, total score increased for both language groups. Additionally, total cognitive load negatively affected both groups of students during problem-solving and non-EBs during interpretation. This study provides the PARCC and SBAC assessment consortia with information relevant to designing test items using multiple semiotic resources used in computer-based assessments in ways that are sensitive to the characteristics of EB students. Results from this study contribute to the establishment of a research agenda on the relationship between the semiotic properties of test items and the achievement of EB students in large-scale tests. Additionally, the information gained from this study informs teachers on how they can use semiotic resources to support their students in the classroom...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{language}} variation of English as foreign language (EFL) learners {{in the virtual}} environment of blogs in an Omani context. To this end, multiple data resources were used comprising student-writers’ blog-texts with their comments and hyperlinks, and interviews with them. The corpus comprises eight posts in Blog 1 and fourteen posts in Blog 2, written over two semesters of an English foundation course. The study responds to four primary questions, 1. To what extent can my students’ blog-texts be conceptualised as belonging to a register? 2. To what extent can my students’ blog-texts be conceptualised as belonging to a genre or as an emergent genre? 3. How do the student-writers construct their voice and express themselves in their blog-texts? 4. What {{is the role of}} blogs in EFL writing classes {{in the context of this}} study? The study uses a systemic functional framework focusing on register and genre analyses. The register analysis was carried out using UAM software, through which the ideational, <b>interpersonal</b> and textual <b>metafunctions</b> of the blog-texts were examined. The register analysis showed that these blogs are an informative type of blogs with a weak tenor indicating the characteristics of both spoken and written modes of language. The genre analysis showed that the blog-texts are generally consistent with Rose and Martin’s (2012, p. 130) genre categories. It also indicated a genre hybridity in some blog-texts, through which blog-texts signify the stages of various genres. The register analysis also helped in understanding how student-writers construed their textual self-expression, voice and stance. This study contributes to the present knowledge on how meanings are constructed throughout the discourse in online environments such as blogs; it supports and advances the previous investigations regarding online genre/s and register. The findings can have implications in ELT, as teachers can identify the particular lexico-grammatical features that need to be introduced in writing classes regarding text types; it can be also a way to recognise what learners know and need to know about the genre and register of texts. The findings offer some further study in the field of language and technology, particularly the role of blogs in EFL classes...|$|R
