40|$|PLAIN ENGLISH SUMMARY: Patient {{safety is}} a growing {{research}} area. However, although patients and the public are increasingly involved in clinical research, there is little guidance {{on how best to}} involve patients in patient safety <b>research.</b> Here we <b>focus</b> on how patients can contribute to the design of patient safety research. We conducted a workshop with patients as part of a project exploring errors and safety in the delivery of intravenous medication (medication given via a vein). The workshop was designed to explore how best to engage with hospital inpatients about these issues, to generate research topics, and to inform researchers about patients' experiences. Nine patients participated, each of whom had previously received intravenous medication. Participants advised against using terms such as 'error'; they also advocated caution when using terms such as 'safety' when describing the study to patients as this may worry some who had not thought about these issues before. We received thorough and useful feedback on our patient information sheets to ensure they were clear and understandable to patients. Patients also shared rich experiences with us about their treatment, which emphasised the need to <b>extend</b> <b>our</b> <b>research</b> <b>focus</b> to include a wider range of factors affecting quality and safety. ABSTRACT: Background Patient safety has attracted increasing attention in recent years. This paper explores patients' contributions to informing patient safety research at an early stage, within a project on intravenous infusion errors. Currently, {{there is little or no}} guidance on how best to involve patients and the wider public in shaping patient safety research, and indeed, whether such efforts are worthwhile. Method We ran a 3 -hour workshop involving nine patients with experience of intravenous therapy in the hospital setting. The first part explored patients' experiences of intravenous therapy. We derived research questions from the resulting discussion through qualitative analysis. In the second part, patients were asked for feedback on patient information sheets considering both content and clarity, and on two potential approaches to framing our patient information: one that <b>focused</b> on <b>research</b> on safety and error, the other on quality improvement. Results The workshop led to a thorough review of how we should engage with patients. Importantly, there was a clear steer away from terms such as 'error' and 'safety' that could worry patients. The experiences that patients revealed were also richer than we had anticipated, revealing different conceptions of how patients related to their treatment and care, their role in safety and use of medical devices, the different levels of information they preferred, and broader factors impacting perceptions of their care. Conclusion Involving patients at an early stage in patient safety research can be of great value. Our workshop highlighted sensitivities around potentially worrying patients about risks that they might not have considered previously, and how to address these. Patient representatives also emphasised a need to expand the focus of patient safety research beyond clinicians and error, to include factors affecting perceptions of quality and safety for patients more broadly...|$|R

The {{international}} andinterdisciplinary {{field of the}} Learning Sciences brings together researchers from the fields of cognitive science,educational research, psychology, computer science, artificial intelligence, information sciences, anthropology,sociology, neurosciences, and other fields to study learning {{in a wide variety}} of formal and informal contexts (seewww. isls. org). The field emerged in the late 1980 s and early 1990 s, with the first ICLS held in 1991 atNorthwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, USA. Subsequent meetings of ICLS were held again in Evanston,USA (1996), Atlanta, GA, USA (1998), Ann Arbor, MI, USA (2000), Seattle, WA, USA (2002), Santa Monica,CA, USA (2004), Bloomington, IN, USA (2006), Utrecht, the Netherlands (2008), Chicago, IL, USA (2010),Sydney, NSW, Australia (2012), and Boulder, CO, USA (2014). ICLS 2016 is the first time that the conferenceis being held in Asia. Submissions for ICLS 2016 were received in November 2015, and then went through a process of peer review. An impressive number of submissions were received (571). The paper review process was very competitive. The overall acceptance rate for submissions was 37 %. We accepted 65 % of symposium submissions, 31 %of full papers, 34 % of short papers, and 43 % of posters. The program reflects broad geographicrepresentation, with contributions from 31 countries and regions. We are especially grateful to those whoperformed reviews. 342 experts completed over 1, 600 reviews of the submissions. As in recent years, foreach symposium, full paper and short paper, we assigned a senior reviewer who examined all reviews andmade a recommendation regarding acceptance in the category submitted, acceptance in an alternatecategory, or rejection. These senior reviewers greatly helped us make the decisions for each submission. The conference theme of ICLS 2016 is “Transforming Learning, Empowering Learners. ” It directs our attentionto a key commitment of the Learning Sciences: providing an insightful understanding of how people learn. Aswe trace the genesis of the Learning Sciences, we are reminded of the main goal of this field of research, that is,to gain a deep understanding of the conditions and processes that lead to effective learning, and to use theresearch findings to redesign learning environments to bring about deep learning. Learning Sciences isconcerned with transforming learning and empowering learners. This long-standing commitment <b>extends</b> <b>our</b> <b>research</b> <b>focus</b> to the design of pedagogical interventions and learningenvironments to foster among participants a kind of learning that is transformative and empowering. This requireschallenging established beliefs about learning, teaching, and the design of learning environments. The theme“Transforming Learning, Empowering Learners” aims at reaffirming the key thrust of Learning Sciencesresearch, discussing advances in the field, and strategizing future directions to enhance our impact oneducational practice. ICLS 2016 aims to bring together learning scientists to adjudicate various academicrenditions of how people learn, and to institute further inquiry that encourages deep and probing examination ofthe nexus of instruction and learning, as well as the roles of technology. To address the conference theme, wearticulated the following strands...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – The {{telecommunications}} and Information Technol-ogy (IT) industry are converging {{into a single}} highly competitive market, where service diversity is the critical success factor. To provide diverse services, the telecommunications operator must evolve the traditional voice service centric network into a generic Service Centric Network. This transformation is aided by an ar-chitecture. An appropriate, but incomplete, architecture is the Service Delivery Platform (SDP). The SDP aims at abstracting network, service and management complexities. <b>Our</b> <b>research</b> <b>focuses</b> on overcoming the complexities of attaining a SDP, by building a framework based various levels of abstraction. This paper provides a motivation and requirements for such a frame-work. In the paper, we first discuss convergence and its implica-tions. We also uncover generic framework requirements based on these implications. Second, we define service centric networks and architectures. Third, we elaborate on the SDP and define additional framework requirements that overcome SDP specific complexities. Fourth, we discuss <b>our</b> <b>research</b> <b>focus.</b> Last, we conclude and discuss future work on the SDP...|$|R
