People in Mickey Mouse and other Tokyo Disneyland costumes appeared on television dancing it with Takuya Kimura.|$|R
50|$|The bulk {{of people}} in the town are now {{employed}} in blue collar roles including manufacturing and retail roles. The local Euro Terminal set up in the 1990s has not materialised with a <b>huge</b> <b>boom</b> in jobs as hoped. Other well-known local employers include Honeywell, a large electronics firm based in the Newhouse industrial estate.|$|R
50|$|In the mid-1890s, bicycling became {{accessible}} to {{the population at large}} {{with the advent of the}} mass-produced, chain-driven safety bicycle. A <b>huge</b> <b>boom</b> in bicycle sales occurred, then collapsed as the market became saturated. Bicycle manufacturers were no longer able to support the League financially, and the interest of its members, largely well-to-do hobbyists, turned elsewhere.|$|R
50|$|Orlem was {{traditionally}} {{inhabited by}} the East Indians. According to a 2004 Church census, there were around 7,000 Tamil Catholics in the Orlem parish. With the <b>huge</b> <b>boom</b> {{of the call}} centre service industry in the 2000s, Orlem witnessed a large influx of young working class executives. The real estate value of Orlem has increased considerably in past few years.|$|R
50|$|Veikkaus {{was founded}} in 1940 by the Football Association of Finland and the Finnish Workers' Sports Federation under the name Oy Tippaustoimisto AB. The agency first offered only sports betting, but in 1971 the Finnish {{national}} lottery was kicked off, and it proved a <b>huge</b> <b>boom.</b> Today, approximately seventy per cent of Finnish people say they {{take part in the}} Lottery at least annually.|$|R
50|$|Armament {{consisted}} of four (but up to eight) Revelli 6.5 mm or 7.7 mm machine guns in front ring mounts and two <b>boom</b> <b>ring</b> mounts.

2500|$|In the 1970s, a time {{of state}} {{financial}} crisis, funding to higher education was cut, and international agencies stepped in over the next decade. Most of this funding, though, went {{to meet the needs}} of primary schools. [...] In the 1990s and 2000s there was a <b>huge</b> <b>boom</b> in Senegalese primary and secondary education, much of it funded through international projects. In 1984 around 50% of Senegalese children received primary education and by 2004 more than 90% did.|$|R
50|$|The video {{starts with}} a {{waitress}} in a restaurant {{standing in front of}} a door with the camera panned toward the floor. A fried pancake falls onto the floor behind her, leaving it to the viewer's imagination as to where it came from. The camera pans sideways over to Imani in the same waitress uniform pressing the play button on a <b>huge</b> <b>boom</b> box, which starts playing the subject song, visibly bored. A series of daydream sequences follow.|$|R
50|$|The {{industry}} was highly regulated {{until the early}} 1990s. Following deregulation, the decade witnessed a <b>huge</b> <b>boom</b> in auto production, as nationalization was abandoned in favor of privatization. Japan acquired the 40% shares of Pak Suzuki in 1991. In 1993, the Indus Motor Company began production of Toyota Corollas. In 1994, the Pakistan Automotive Manufacturer Association formed, and Honda Atlas introduced manufacturing of the Honda Civic. In 1995, the Engineering Development Board inaugurated the PAP show.|$|R

50|$|In 1950, Osman {{traveled}} to Saudi Arabia. The Persian Gulf area was experiencing a <b>huge</b> <b>boom</b> {{in the construction}} sector, largely related to the oil boom. Osman {{was able to take}} advantage of this, and within a short period of time was carrying out multimillion-dollar projects in Kuwait, Libya, Iraq, and the UAE, amassing a great deal of wealth. Osman mentions that in most of these countries, he found the construction markets dominated by monopolies and cartels of foreign companies.|$|R

By 1935 the United Front was formed from the National Education Workers, culminating with the creation of the National Confederation of Education Workers, during a period of a <b>huge</b> <b>boom</b> in worker, peasant and popular union associations.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of these factors, prices for land in the Chicago Loop rose from {{essentially}} nothing in 1830 ($800 per acre in 2012 dollars) to New York levels by 1836 ($327,000 per acre in 2012 dollars), a 40,775% increase, with even higher prices around Dearborn Avenue and the Chicago River. Furthermore, Illinois in general experienced a <b>huge</b> <b>boom</b> in real estate prices and town foundations. Walters estimates that the foundations of 1/3 of all towns ever created in central Illinois occurred between 1835 and 1837.|$|R
50|$|Televised kickboxing was a <b>huge</b> <b>boom</b> from 1965 to 1975 {{when it was}} {{broadcast}} on the four TV stations, TBS, Nippon Television, TV Asahi and TV Tokyo all over Japan. TV Asahi requested a player from Kyokushin in February, 1969, and Masutatsu Ōyama elected Soeno and Terutomo Yamazaki to enter the competitions. Ōyama also founded a kickboxing gym called Kyokushin Gym where they practiced kickboxing about two months before entering the kickboxing competitions in April, 1969. Soeno fought in the welterweight division at kickboxing.|$|R

I don't care what these crackerjack whack jobs tell you — your kid is not autistic. He's just stupid. Or lazy. Or both.|$|R
5000|$|Retired: Late 1986 Age 24 during [...] "the year of no sponsors" [...] {{when even}} some of the most {{respected}} top pros could not find sponsorships due to manufacturers cutting back or dropping entirely their factory racing teams. The cause of this were in part to the financial problems brought on by the advents of the revival of skateboarding, the high price of producing bicycles in the United States and most importantly companies trying to start and make room for freestyle teams with the <b>huge</b> <b>boom</b> in BMX Freestyle.|$|R

25|$|Modernist sculptors largely {{missed out}} on the <b>huge</b> <b>boom</b> in public art {{resulting}} from the demand for war memorials for the two World Wars, but from the 1950s the public and commissioning bodies became more comfortable with Modernist sculpture and large public commissions both abstract and figurative became common. Picasso was commissioned to make a maquette for a huge -high public sculpture, the so-called Chicago Picasso (1967). His design was ambiguous and somewhat controversial, and what the figure represents is not clear; {{it could be a}} bird, a horse, a woman or a totally abstract shape.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the first}} few decades, both residences and {{businesses}} occupied the area, but increasingly business predominated. [...] "There are old stories of people's houses being surrounded by the clamor of business and trade and the owners complaining that they can't get anything done," [...] according to a historian named Burrows. The opening of the Erie Canal in the early 19th century meant a <b>huge</b> <b>boom</b> in business for New York City, since {{it was the only}} major eastern seaport which had direct access by inland waterways to ports on the Great Lakes.

60|$|And {{now we are}} on board; and alas! {{some time}} before the breeze will be so. Take care of that <b>huge</b> <b>boom,</b> {{landsman}} Claude, swaying and sweeping backwards and forwards across the deck, unless you wish to be knocked overboard. Take care, too, of that loose rope's end, unless you wish to have your eyes cut out. Take my advice, lie down here across the deck, as others are doing. Cover yourself with great-coats, like an Irishman, to keep yourself cool, and let us meditate little on this strange thing, and strange place, which holds us now.|$|R

50|$|Edwards' {{tenure in}} the 1970s {{coincided with a}} <b>huge</b> <b>boom</b> in the state's oil and gas {{industry}} after the gas pricing crisis of 1973. Edwards was able to greatly expand the state's oil revenues by basing severance taxes on a percentage of the price of each barrel rather than the former flat rate. This oil money fueled a massive increase in state spending (an 163% increase between 1972 and 1980), and Edwards was able to consistently balance the state budget due to the boom in oil revenue. Much of this increased spending went toward health and human services program and increased funding for vocational-technical schools and higher education.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of a}} major {{restructuring}} of British Steel in the late 1970s Corby Steelworks was closed down, {{and there was no}} longer any need for a large dragline to assist in the recovery of iron ore. On 4 July 1980 Sundew walked to its final resting place and the <b>huge</b> <b>boom</b> was lowered onto a purpose-built earth mound. There it remained for seven years until being scrapped over a six-month period from January to June 1987. The cab is preserved at Rutland Railway Museum which is now known as Rocks By Rail - The Living Ironstone Museum. In 2014 the Heritage Lottery Fund awarded £8,100 for its restoration.|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{describes the}} process of assessment of environmental impacts from their inception to the present. It deals with the procedures of the EIA and SEA, which are analyzed by legislative norms and laws. Further, there are specified principles and processes of individual phases for comparing both methods. In the practical part, this process is demonstrated on biogas plants, which are subject to assessment under Act no. 100 / 2001 Coll. The concluding part of this thesis discusses {{the analysis of the}} evolution of biogas plants in the Czech Republic in the years 2002 - 2015. This illustrates the <b>huge</b> <b>boom</b> of buildings producing biogas...|$|R

40|$|Ad Hoc Networks {{provide a}} real {{opportunity}} to design flexible networks, very simple to deploy. However they remain a particular computation environment, characterized by the deficiency of pre-existed and centralized infrastructure. In the other hand, SIP protocol, which knows a <b>huge</b> <b>booming</b> in internet networks, requires centralized entities, like proxy server, registrar server and location service; consequently SIP is not adapted to Ad Hoc networks. We have presented in a new technique VNSIP (Virtual Network for Session Initiation Protocol) {{to fix the problem}} related to constraints of SIP deployment in MANET (Mobile Ad Hoc Networks). In this paper we use a new algorithm which we have called MCAC (MANET Call Admission Control) to improve VNSIP Performances...|$|R
