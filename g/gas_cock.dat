5|$|The Nikkatsu Company {{made three}} popular Sun Tribe films in 1956, a genre {{based on a}} {{contemporary}} youth subculture whose interests revolved around beach life, jazz music and their progressive attitudes towards sex. The films met with moral public outcries and a fourth production was shut down {{at the behest of}} Eirin (The Motion Picture Code of Ethics Committee). However, the genre later experienced a resurgence which included The Warped Ones. The film marked director Koreyoshi Kurahara's first collaboration with screenwriter Nobuo Yamada. They reused many elements of Kurahara's earlier Sun Tribe film The Time of Youth (1959), including abortion, a near fatality via an opened <b>gas</b> <b>cock</b> and a criminal act near water, an explosion beside a stream in the former and the rape on the beach in the latter.|$|E
50|$|By mid-1878 Bartlett {{introduced}} several devices {{which enabled}} lamplighting via electricity which he produced from an office at 950 Broadway. There were three inventions which each {{related to the}} other. One was an electric <b>gas</b> <b>cock</b> and lighter, which was controlled {{by the hand and}} which could be adjusted upon any gas fixture. The second was an automatic <b>gas</b> <b>cock</b> and lighter used in street lights and buildings. The third was an electric signal. As an experiment the lamps around Madison Square were fitted with automatic lighters. Each could be lighted or extinguished in a short time by placing a finger on the button of a battery at the office at 950 Broadway. Also the battery could be connected to a clock and the lights extinguished in just a moment.|$|E

50|$|Before <b>gassing,</b> <b>cock</b> {{the marker}} by pulling back the cocking handle (located {{near the front}} of the marker {{on the left side of}} the receiver). This pulls back the front and rear bolts and allows access to chamber while also {{ensuring}} that the valve is not being depressed by the rear bolt when the propellant supply is screwed in, which would result in a leak. A click should be heard. Release the cocking handle.|$|R
50|$|The Action T4 organisers, Viktor Brack and Karl Brandt, {{ordered that}} the {{execution}} of the sick had to be carried out by medical doctors because Hitler's memorandum of authorisation of 1 September 1939 only referred to doctors. The operation of the gas tap was thus the responsibility of doctors in the death centres. However, {{during the course of the}} euthanasia programme, the <b>gas</b> <b>cocks</b> were occasionally operated by others in the absence of the doctors or for other reasons. Also, many doctors used pseudonyms rather than their real names in the documents.|$|R
