500|$|Brocklebank {{was hired}} by Emmerdale to play Ivan for a three episode stint. They {{introduced}} Ivan {{as part of the}} storyline about the character of Jarvis Skelton (Richard Moore) getting too old to be a binman. Brocklebank told Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury that the serial's producers did not intend for his character to develop, but they enjoyed his work and kept him on. They later extended his contract to last into mid-2006. Brocklebank found that taking the role gave him a [...] "new respect" [...] for soap opera actors because of <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>he</b> had to work. While the actor is from Warwickshire; Ivan is a Geordie and has the regional accent. Brocklebank had to put the accent on for the role and members of the public were confused when they heard him speak in person.|$|E
500|$|Kouao {{was arrested}} {{on the day that}} Climbié died, and Manning the {{following}} day. Kouao told police, [...] "It is terrible, I have just lost my child". On 20 November 2000, at the Old Bailey, the trial into her death opened, where Kouao and Manning were charged with child cruelty and murder. Kouao denied all charges, and Manning pleaded guilty to charges of cruelty and manslaughter. The judge described the people in Climbié's case as [...] "blindingly incompetent". In his diary, Manning described Climbié as Satan, and said that no matter <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>he</b> hit her, she did not cry or show signs that she was hurt. On 12 January 2001, both were found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment. The judge said to them, [...] "what Victoria endured was truly unimaginable. She died at both your hands, a lonely drawn out death". Kouao went to Durham prison and Manning went to Wakefield prison.|$|E
500|$|Much {{like other}} sandbox games, the player uses melee attacks, guns, and {{explosives}} {{to fight the}} opposing forces, and can run, climb buildings, jump across rooftops, or use vehicles to navigate the city. Crackdown features a series of character-based skills that can be upgraded to increase specific traits {{that can be used}} in combat, driving, or on-foot agility. These skills include: [...] "Agility", which increases the Agent's ability to jump, run, and swim; [...] "Driving", affecting how well he can handle a vehicle and uprades it [...] "Explosives", which affects the power and range of explosive weapons and explosive power [...] "Strength" [...] that increases the Agent's strength, namely by increasing his ability to lift and throw, as well as <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>he</b> can strike an opponent and increses health and [...] "Firearms", which improves the character's aptitude with weapons. Crackdowns skills make few concessions to realism: character abilities are similar to those of comic book superheroes or cartoon characters. This concept is further highlighted by the ink-like outlines drawn around in-game characters.|$|E

He always talks about how much he loves this place. I know if he had to {{highlight}} one race to get his first win, I'm sure he'd tell you in a minute he couldn't be happier. You only get one chance to get your first win. It's a special thing, especially when you do it here." [...] The race result moved Menard up five positions to 14th in the Driver's Championship with 553 points, 53 points behind tenth.

500|$|... "California King Bed" [...] is a rock power ballad; Ryan Dombell of Pitchfork Media {{compared}} it to the Aerosmith song, [...] "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing". The Shama Joseph produced [...] "Man Down" [...] is a reggae song with an electro rhythm, in which Rihanna sings in a West Indian accent. [...] "Raining Men" [...] is a hip-hop song, which features rap vocals from Trinidadian rapper Nicki Minaj. Rihanna described the song as a fun song that differs from the original, referring to the 1979 single by The Weather Girls with similar title [...] "It's Raining Men". [...] "Complicated" [...] was produced by Tricky Stewart and Ester Dean. Leah Greenblatt from Entertainment Weekly said [...] "Even while telling a recalcitrant man <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>he</b> is to love, she [...] sounds almost buoyant, her newly expanded vocals eager to scale the song's high-altitude house beat". The final track is the sequel to Rihanna's duet with Eminem, [...] "Love the Way You Lie". [...] "Love the Way You Lie (Part II)", which was produced by Alex da Kid, features Rihanna as the protagonist and lead vocalist, viewing aspects of a relationship from a female perspective, unlike the original, which featured Eminem as lead vocalist and was from a male perspective.|$|E
500|$|... "Complicated" [...] {{garnered}} {{critical acclaim}} from music critics. Colin Gentry of 4Music named the song {{the highlight of}} the album, continuing to write that Rihanna pours her heart out to the listener as she sings about the intensity of her [...] "despair". Jon Parales of The New York Times described [...] "Complicated" [...] as being one of the more [...] "emotional" [...] songs on Loud. Emily Mackay of NME noted that the lyrics [...] "Why do you make it so hard to love you?/I hate it" [...] were reminiscent of songs by English pop girl group, Sugababes. Steve Jones of USA Today observed that Rihanna's opinions of men are not just present on [...] "Complicated", but rather that it is a recurring theme on Loud, writing [...] "On more than one occasion, she makes it clear that she likes her men complicated and that they can expect her to be the same." [...] Jones also listed it as one of his top songs to download from the album. Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly commented that the [...] "spiraling dance-floor siren" [...] persona Rihanna adopted on the lead single from Loud, [...] "Only Girl (In the World)", was carried through onto [...] "Complicated". Greenblatt continued to praise Rihanna's vocal performance, writing: [...] "Even while telling a recalcitrant man <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>he</b> is to love, she sounds almost buoyant, her newly expanded vocals eager to scale the song's high-altitude house beat." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Socrates {{is nearly}} done, Dionysus, {{who is to}} judge the speeches, arrives, {{in the person of}} Alcibiades.

60|$|Ever since Lucy {{had reached}} her teens {{there had been}} {{predictions}} {{that she would be}} kidnapped, and now the thing had come to pass. She was in danger, she knew, but in infinitely less than had any other wild character of the uplands been her captor. She believed, if she went quietly and obediently with Creech, that she would be, at least, safe from harm. It was hard luck for Bostil, she thought, but no worse than he deserved. Retribution had overtaken him. <b>How</b> terribly <b>hard</b> <b>he</b> would take the loss of his horses! Lucy wondered if he really ever would part with the King, even to save her from privation and peril. Bostil was more likely to trail her with his riders and to kill the Creeches than to concede their demands. Perhaps, though, that threat to sell her to Cordts would frighten the hard old man.|$|R
2500|$|I {{must confess}} I've still {{yet to be}} {{convinced}} that Cose is ready for test cricket. Last summer he earned his test place, and confirmed it with his century in Melbourne. But since then a question mark has arisen over his dedication to cricket, and also over his ability to play on wickets which are doing a bit. And he is definitely suspect outside his off stump. I'd like to see Gary work harder at his game. He appears to be overweight and I wonder <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>he</b> is prepared to work at his batting at this stage.|$|E
2500|$|Billy Evans picked Kirk for his 1922 [...] "National Honor Roll," [...] and {{credited}} Kirk's {{performance to}} physical conditioning:"Bernie Kirk of Michigan {{was the leading}} end of the west this year. ... Condition made Kirk a star. [...] He lacked condition in 1921. [...] At that time he was just [...] as able, otherwise as this year. [...] But nobody mentioned him and he did nothing much to help his team. [...] Kirk realized why he failed in 1921 and immediately began preparing for the season of 1922. [...] Careful diet, regular hours and well-planned exercise brought him into remarkable condition. [...] Kirk was fit when the training season started. [...] Kirk played every minute of every game he started this year. [...] He never had time taken out. [...] He was really a physical marvel, considering <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>he</b> played." ...|$|E
2500|$|After a long {{overture}} depicting {{night and}} dawn, the curtain opens on Adam, lamenting the quarrel between his sons Cain and Abel (Aria: [...] "Charmant séjour, lieux solitaires"). No matter <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>he</b> tries, he cannot reconcile the jealous Cain to his brother. Abel arrives and joins Adam in a prayer hoping that Cain will soon {{change his mind}} (Duet: [...] "Unissons-nous pour le rendre sensible"). Eve is also worried about her son, who has taken to spending his days alone in the forest (Aria: [...] "Insensible aux tourments"). Cain's wife Méala is concerned about their children (Aria: [...] "J'attendais que l'aurore en ramenant le jour"). Cain enters and accuses Adam of favouring his brother (Aria: [...] "Quoi! toujours ton image est offerte à mes yeux"). But the united pleas of his family finally persuade him to accept reconciliation with his brother (Sextet with chorus: [...] "Ô moment plein de charmes"). However, even as the two brothers swear friendship, a voice is heard crying [...] "Never!" [...] It is the demon Anamalech, jealous of the happiness of the humans. To avert the curse, the brothers decide to sacrifice to God on their altars. Abel's sacrifice receives a favourable omen, but Anamalech overthrows Cain's altar. Feeling his brother has been accepted {{and he has been}} rejected, Cain curses everyone and runs off to the wilderness.|$|E
40|$|The {{purposes}} {{of the present study}} were to investigate how a belief in the academic career has an effect on an apathy tendency of university student. First, two scales were constructed. One is for measuring degree of one’s belief in the academic career (Belief in academic career scale), and the other is for measuring <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> one thinks <b>he</b> has made an effort to pass the university entrance exam (Effort to pass the university entrance exam scale). Next, Belief in academic career scale, Effort to pass the university entrance exam scale, Apathy mentality scale, Identity scale were administered to 251 freshmen of the best university and good university. The data were analyzed using likelihood ratio test. It was shown that the stronger belief in academic career scale was related to greater apathy tendency for male freshmen, and cause of apathy might be different between male and female students...|$|R
6000|$|Why, moreover, {{should the}} Barchester clergy have looked coldly on Mr. Quiverful? Had they not all {{shown that they}} {{regarded}} with complacency the loaves and fishes of their mother church? Had they not all, by some hook or crook, done better for themselves than he had done? They were not burdened as he was burdened. Dr. Grantly had five children and nearly as many thousands a year on which to feed them. It was very well for him to turn up his nose at a new bishop who could do nothing for him, and a chaplain who was beneath his notice; but it was cruel in a man so circumstanced to set the world against the father of fourteen children because he was anxious to obtain for them an honourable support! He, Mr. Quiverful, had not asked for the wardenship; he had not even accepted it till he had been assured that Mr. Harding had refused it. <b>How</b> <b>hard</b> then that <b>he</b> should be blamed for doing that which not to have done would have argued a most insane imprudence! ...|$|R

5000|$|In May 1949, {{a little}} over two years after his first performance, Raizō formed a study group with two other young kabuki performers. These were Rishō Arashi (known later in his kabuki career as Arashi Kichisaburō VIII, and as Yatarō Kitagami in his acting career) and Nakamura Taro II. They called this group the Tsukushikai (つくし会), which can be {{translated}} as [...] "exhaustive meeting," [...] and together they focused diligently on training. However, there was one obstacle that this training could not overcome: Kudanji had been the son of a member of a minor politician in Kyoto rather than a kabuki actor, and had only been apprenticed (to an actor known as Ichikawa Sadanji II) because of Kudanji's own strong desire to enter the world of kabuki. Thus Kudanji was forever labeled as a montei agari - someone born and raised outside of the kabuki world and its [...] "lineage" [...] and later apprenticed into it - and doomed never to exceed a supporting role. That being the case, no matter <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> Raizō trained, <b>he</b> was unlikely to gain noteworthy roles as a kenmon performer as long as he remained the son of Kudanji.|$|R

5000|$|Hollyoaks has mainly been {{considered}} as a 'teen soap', as it was originally aimed, as the [...] "fourth British soap-opera". In 2008, Gemma Merna, who played Carmel McQueen, admitted she felt the show is underrated: [...] "We are completely underrated as a show, which is so frustrating," [...] Gemma told the Daily Star. [...] "People just think we are gorgeous models who have nothing else to offer. But the truth is we have some seriously talented actors and we're fed up with being the little sister to Corrie, EastEnders and Emmerdale. We're fighters and we're so passionate about what we do. We have the balls and just go for it. And I think we should get credit for that!". Ricky Whittle, who plays Calvin Valentine, explained that {{the time and effort}} required to produce Hollyoaks, often goes unnoticed. He also said: [...] "There's an idea that we're the party soap, the happy soap, the soap that has loads of fun, but people don't realise <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> we work". <b>He</b> went on, [...] "Everyone thinks it's all glamour, premieres and parties but they need to realise that we do put it in. We are working hard for a living as well and it's not as easy as it sounds. At the minute, especially with the late night stuff, we're doing 12-hour days, sometimes six or seven days a week." ...|$|R
