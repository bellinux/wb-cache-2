2500|$|The word [...] "benzene" [...] derives {{historically}} from [...] "gum benzoin" [...] (benzoin resin), an aromatic resin {{known to}} European pharmacists and perfumers since the 15th {{century as a}} product of southeast Asia. An acidic material was derived from benzoin by sublimation, and named [...] "flowers of benzoin", or benzoic acid. The hydrocarbon derived from benzoic acid thus acquired the name benzin, benzol, or benzene. Michael Faraday first isolated and identified benzene in 1825 from the oily residue derived from the production of illuminating gas, giving it the name bicarburet of hydrogen.H6, although he doesn't realize it because he (like most chemists at that time) used the wrong atomic mass for carbon (6 instead of 12). In 1833, Eilhard Mitscherlich produced it by distilling benzoic acid (from <b>gum</b> <b>benzoin)</b> and lime. He gave the compound the name benzin. In 1836, the French chemist Auguste Laurent named the substance [...] "phène"; this word has become the root of the English word [...] "phenol", which is hydroxylated benzene, and [...] "phenyl", the radical formed by abstraction of a hydrogen atom (free radical H•) from benzene.|$|E
5000|$|Rashi {{writes that}} onycha was a root from the ground. Benzoin almonds do not {{resemble}} the resins they actually are but {{appear as a}} rough stony almonds. Not being native to Palestine they {{could easily have been}} mistaken as portions of a root since they do not seem to adequately resemble any other portion of a plant body. However it seems that the root of benzoin was also used. The ancient Greeks and Romans used benzoin root in a seasoning sauce for a meat boiled in sweet herbs. A Roman supper sometimes included shellfish prepared with pepper, cinnamon, and benzoin root. Benzoin root was also used in a recipe for seasoning goose liver. Benzoin root is still used today in incense recipes. Also the resin proper is procured near the root of the tree. Resin procured from the tree during the first three years is referred to as head benzoin. That which is obtained during the next 7 or 8 years is known as the belly benzoin. The third type is called foot benzoin, and is obtained by splitting the tree and scraping the wood of the trunk and roots. This latter source contains impurities. Rambam says that onycha was rubbed with bitter vetch to remove impurities. The Talmud also appears to indicate that onycha came from an annual plant. <b>Benzoin</b> <b>gum</b> is harvested annually, and not being native to Palestine it is possible confusion slipped in identifying its annual yield with its life span. Different Styrax trees are often misidentified or referred to as a [...] "bush." [...] Onycha {{is said to have been}} soaked in wine to enhance its fragrance which was often done with resins used for incense.|$|R
2500|$|Some {{difficulty}} {{has arisen}} since {{the passing of}} the Adulteration of Food and Drugs Act concerning the use of the Pharmacopoeia as a legal standard for the drugs and preparations contained in it. The Pharmacopoeia is defined in the preface as only [...] "intended to afford {{to the members of the}} medical profession and those engaged in the preparation of medicines throughout the British Empire one uniform standard and guide whereby the nature and composition of, substances to be used in medicine may be ascertained and determined". It is obvious that it cannot be an encyclopaedia of substances used in medicine, and can only be used as a standard for the substances and preparations contained in it, and for no others. It has been held in the Divisional Courts (Dickins v. Randerson) that the Pharmacopoeia is a standard for official preparations asked for under their pharmacopoeial name. But there are many substances in the Pharmacopoeia which are not only employed in medicine, but have other uses, such as sulphur, <b>gum</b> <b>benzoin,</b> tragacanth, gum arabic, ammonium carbonate, beeswax, oil of turpentine, linseed oil, and for these a commercial standard of purity as distinct from a medicinal one is needed, since the preparations used in medicine should be of the highest possible degree of purity obtainable, and this standard would be too high and too expensive for ordinary purposes. The use of trade synonyms in the Pharmacopoeia, such as saltpetre for purified potassium nitrate, and milk of sulphur for precipitated sulphur, is partly answerable for this difficulty, and has proved to be a mistake, since it affords ground for legal prosecution if a chemist sells a drug of ordinary commercial purity for trade purposes, instead of the purified preparation which is official in the Pharmacopoeia for medicinal use. This would not be the case if the trade synonym were omitted. For many drugs and chemicals not in the Pharmacopoeia there is no standard of purity that can be used under the Adulteration of Food and Drugs Act, and for these, as well as for the commercial quality of those drugs and essential oils which are also in the Pharmacopoeia, a legal standard of commercial purity is much needed. This subject formed the basis of discussion at several meetings of the Pharmaceutical Society, and the results have been embodied in a work called Suggested Standards for Foods and Drugs by C.G. Moor, which indicates the average degree of purity of many drugs and chemicals used in the arts, as well as the highest degree of purity obtainable in commerce of those used in medicine.|$|E

50|$|Many {{scholars}} cite Styrax officinalis as {{the biblical}} storax, however the yield of resin produced by S. officinalis, if any is produced at all, is extremely small.

5000|$|The internationally renowned Bible scholar Bochart stated, at {{one point}} in his research, that onycha was {{actually}} benzoin, a gum-resin from the Styrax species. [...] H.J. Abrahams states that the use of benzoin in the Biblical incense is not inconceivable since Syro-Arabian tribes maintained extensive trade routes prior to Hellenism. Styrax Benzoin was available via import to the biblical lands during the Old Testament era. Herodotus of Halicarnassus in the 5th century BCE indicates that different kinds of styrax resins were traded. Styrax benzoin was used by the ancient Egyptians in the art of perfumery and incense. The apothecary of Shemot (book of Exodus) would have been familiar with its aromatic uses. S. benzoin has a history steeped in antiquity and was once employed as an incense in Egypt. All the compounds identified in benzoin resin were detected in an archaeological organic residue from an Egyptian ceramic censer, thus proving that this resin was used as one of the components of the mixture of organic materials burned as incense in ancient Egypt. [...] An ancient Egyptian perfume formula (1200 BCE) contained benzoin as one of its chief ingredients. The name [...] "benzoin" [...] is probably derived from Arabic lubān jāwī (لبان جاوي, [...] "Javan frankincense"); compare the mid-eastern terms [...] "gum benjamin" [...] and [...] "benjoin". The word 'Storax' is an alteration of the Late Latin styrax. In the Orphic hymns it is στόρακας or στόρακα. As pointed out earlier, the original word shecheleth was replaced with onycha by the Septuagint translation. Onycha in turn is derived from the onyx stone meaning [...] "fingernail". Conder writes that [...] "the root of the Hebrew word shecheleth means to drop or distil, and shecheleth would seem, therefore, to mean some exudation.” Another writer says that the Hebrew shecheleth identifies with the Syriac shehelta which is translated as “a tear or distillation” and that “the context and the etymology seem to require the gum of some aromatic plant [...] [...] [...] The Hebrew word would seem to mean something that exuded, having odorous qualities.” The book of Ecclesiasticus lists storax as one of the ingredients when alluding to the sacred incense of the biblical tabernacle. [...] The Hindustanis use Benzoin to burn in their temples—a circumstance strongly in favor of the hypothesis that benzoin is part of the incense formula of Exodus. [...] The infrequent mention of benzoin by name in antiquity is quite suspicious considering its importance in ancient recipes. [...] It stands to reason it must have been known by another name not currently used today. References to it by name are conspicuously missing also from the Old Testament. Callcott writes “It has been suggested [...] that <b>Gum</b> <b>Benzoin,</b> which is not mentioned by any other name in scripture, must be onycha. Its fracture has exactly the lustre required by the name[...] [...] The gum is a secretion of the bark, and is of great efficacy in healing wounds[...] [...] Such are the pretensions of the Benzoin to be looked upon as the true Onycha, which, from the text, as I have already said, must have been some fragrant vegetable gum in itself, of foreign production, and ranking with stacte, and myrrh, and galbanum [...] [...] [...] all which conditions are fulfilled by the Gum Benzoin.” [...] Dioscorides and Galen describe two kinds of bdellium, the second of which is Benzoin, according to Hardouin and Sprengel. Pererra describes benzoin tears as [...] "flattened pieces, some of which are angular, and the larger of them [...] [...] [...] an inch in length." [...] He says that [...] "externally, these pieces are shiny." [...] This description most certainly fits well with the interpretation of [...] "onycha" [...] which means [...] "fingernail." [...] He continues to say many of the pieces [...] "are of an amber or reddish-yellow colour" [...] and continues to describe parts of it as [...] "translucent or milky, and frequently striped." [...] This is a good description of the appearance of various onyx stones, from which the name onycha is derived. He says that many tears of Styrax benzoin [...] "are translucent, or, in a few cases, almost transparent." [...] One type of benzoin has [...] "numerous, white, small pieces [...] [...] [...] intermingled, which thereby give the broken surface a speckled appearance" [...] which he calls [...] "marbly." [...] As mentioned above, although the word onycha has been interpreted as meaning [...] "nail" [...] it is pointed out that nail or claw is actually an extended connotation of onyx, derived from the translucent and sometimes veined appearance of the gemstone onyx. Onyx comes in a variety of colors the most prominent being either the black and veined striped gem or the pinkish translucent striped gem. One related Styrax is black and the benzoin discussed thus far seems to be of the pinkish, translucent sort. Steeping Styrax benzoin tears in wine can enhance its fragrance as well as its translucent qualities and [...] "shiny" [...] appearance, thus making it appear even more like the onyx gem. Rambam stated that soaking onycha in wine made it beautiful. Benzoin tears look very different from other resins and appear to be small stones rather than the vegetable product that it is.|$|E
