500|$|Filhol had {{classified}} Plesiorycteropus {{as close}} to the aardvark on the basis of morphological similarities. In his 1946 review, Charles Lamberton was unable to provide a <b>definitive</b> <b>allocation,</b> confused by the various similarities he saw with aardvarks, pangolins, armadillos, and anteaters. He believed it was most likely a primitive, isolated member of [...] "Edentata", a group in which he included aardvarks, pangolins, and Xenarthra (sloths, armadillos, and anteaters). He rejected some alternatives, such as a close affinity to aardvarks or the possibility that the material assigned to Plesiorycteropus did not in fact represent a single animal. Bryan Patterson, who revised tubulidentates (the order of which the aardvark is the only living representative) in the 1970s, accepted Plesiorycteropus {{as a member of the}} group, dismissing many similarities with pangolins and other animals as convergent. However, he placed it as the only member of its own subfamily Plesiorycteropodinae in view of its differences from other tubulidentates (subfamily Orycteropodinae), and hypothesized that it arrived on Madagascar in the Eocene, at the same time as the lemurs. Johannes Thewissen, who critiqued some aspects of Patterson's classification in 1985, also accepted Plesiorycteropus as a tubulidentate without comment.|$|E
40|$|This {{report of}} a conference held in January 2001, {{entitled}} "Planning for our local communities", deals with the following four key areas: engagement with young people using creative methods; presenting reliable information to young people, {{in a way to}} which they will respond; targeting young people between 10 and 13 years, their parents and those who work with them, to raise awareness, knowledge and understanding; and targeting young people between 18 and 25 years, to develop programmes with them. The County Wexford Community Based Drugs Initiative (CBDI) identified the need for programmes and training, with <b>definitive</b> budget <b>allocation,</b> as well as the involvement of the whole community in developing the strategic framework...|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} procurement {{approach is}} ever-present within the construction industry. With fundamental design principles founded on <b>definitive</b> risk <b>allocation,</b> this transactional based approach fails to acknowledge or foster the cooperative relationships {{considered to be}} vital {{to the success of}} any project. Contractual design encourages stakeholders to defend their own individual interest to the likely detriment of project objectives. These failings are not disputed, however, given that trust is a fundamental requirement for human interaction the influence of trust is potentially important in terms of stakeholder relationships and ultimate project success. Trust is therefore examined within this context. A conceptual framework of trust is presented and subsequently used to code and analyse detailed, semi-structured interviews with multiple stakeholders from different projects. Using a phenomenological investigation of trust via the lived experiences of multiple practitioners, issues pertaining to the formation and maintenance of trust within traditionally procured construction projects are examined. Trust was found to be integral to the lived experiences of practitioners, with both good and bad relationships evident within the constructs of traditional procurement mechanisms. In this regard, individual personalities were considered significant, along with appropriate risk identification and management. Communication, particularly of an informal nature, was also highlighted. A greater emphasis on project team selection during the initial stages of a project would therefore be beneficial, as would careful consideration of the allocation of risk. Contract design would also be enhanced through prescriptive protocols for developing and maintaining trust, along with mandated mechanisms for informal communication, particularly when responding to negative events. A greater understanding regarding the consequences of lost trust and the intricacies of trust repair would also be of value. ...|$|R
40|$|Non-structural {{carbohydrates}} (NSCs) {{are critical}} to maintain plant metabolism under stressful environmental conditions, {{but we do not}} fully understand how NSC allocation and utilization from storage varies with stress. While it has become established that storage allocation is unlikely to be a mere overflow process, very little empirical evidence has been produced to support this view, at least not for trees. Here we present the results of an intensively monitored experimental manipulation of whole-tree carbon (C) balance (young Picea abies (L.) H Karst.) using reduced atmospheric [CO 2] and drought to reduce C sources. We measured specific C storage pools (glucose, fructose, sucrose, starch) over 21 weeks and converted concentration measurement into fluxes {{into and out of the}} storage pool. Continuous labeling (13 C) allowed us to track C allocation to biomass and non-structural C pools. Net C fluxes into the storage pool occurred mainly when the C balance was positive. Storage pools increased during periods of positive C gain and were reduced under negative C gain. 13 C data showed that C was allocated to storage pools independent of the net flux and even under severe C limitation. Allocation to below-ground tissues was strongest in control trees followed by trees experiencing drought followed by those grown under low [CO 2]. Our data suggest that NSC storage has, under the conditions of our experimental manipulation (e. g., strong progressive drought, no above-ground growth), a high allocation priority and cannot be considered an overflow process. While these results also suggest active storage <b>allocation,</b> <b>definitive</b> proof of active plant control of storage in woody plants requires studies involving molecular tools...|$|R
