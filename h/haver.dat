25|$|The Flamingo {{opened on}} December 26, 1946, {{at which time}} only the casino, lounge, theater, and {{restaurant}} were finished. Although locals attended the opening, few celebrities materialized. A handful drove in from Los Angeles despite bad weather. Some celebrities present were Raft, June <b>Haver,</b> Vivian Blaine, Sonny Tufts, Brian Donlevy, and Charles Coburn. They were welcomed by construction noise and a lobby draped with drop cloths. The desert's first air conditioning collapsed regularly. While gambling tables were operating, the luxury rooms that would have served as the lure for people to stay and gamble were not ready. As word of the losses {{made their way to}} Siegel during the evening, he began to become irate and verbally abusive, throwing out at least one family. After two weeks, the Flamingo's gaming tables were $275,000 in the red and the entire operation shut down in late January 1947.|$|E

The claim that billions of dollars had been wasted on defense spending was deemed an overreaction. Former DIA chief Lt. Gen. James R.

Hitz also recommended reprimands for nearly 12 serving and former CIA officers, including several deputy directors for operations and former directors William H. Webster, Robert M. Gates, and R.

[...] Hitz's report also claimed that CIA officers in the Directorate of Operations (DO) distributed sensitive intelligence reports despite suspecting that their sources were Soviet-controlled.

500|$|Singer Gruff Rhys has {{described}} [...] "Ysbeidiau Heulog" [...] as [...] "throwaway pop ... old time pop music", likening the song {{to the work}} of ELO and going on to claim that it is a tribute to late 1960s pop bands such as The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band and Os Mutantes. Rhys has stated that his lyrics are about [...] "looking back at a bad time which had the odd good moment" [...] and that [...] "If there's any song that doesn't sum up [...] it's !" [...] The track was recorded in 1999 at Famous Studios, Cardiff and was engineered by Greg <b>Haver.</b> Overdubs were added at Ofn studios, Llanfaelog, Wales with the help of Gorwel Owen who also mixed the song at the studio along with the Super Furry Animals.

500|$|RMS Titanic Inc. {{has also}} {{attempted}} to secure exclusive physical {{access to the}} wreck site. In 1996, it obtained a court order finding that it had [...] "the exclusive right to take any and all types of photographic images of the Titanic wreck and wreck site." [...] It obtained another order in 1998 against Deep Ocean Expeditions and Chris <b>Haver,</b> a British Virgin Islands corporation that aimed to run tourist trips to Titanic {{at a cost of}} $32,000 per person (it now charges $60,000). This was overturned in March 1999 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which ruled that the law of salvage did not extend to obtaining exclusive rights to view, visit and photograph a wreck. The court pointed out that Titanic is [...] "located in a public place" [...] in international waters, rather than in a private or controllable location to which access could be restricted by the owner. Granting such a right would also create a perverse incentive; since the aim of salvage is to carry out a salvage operation, leaving property in place so that it could be photographed would run counter to this objective.|$|E
500|$|Jeff Killed John was the forerunner band to Bullet for My Valentine and {{was formed}} in 1998 by Matthew Tuck, Michael [...] "Padge" [...] Paget, Nick Crandle, and Michael [...] "Moose" [...] Thomas while {{studying}} music at Bridgend College. They started playing Nirvana and Metallica cover songs. In 1999, the band released their first ever EP, Better Off Alone. They released another two-track EP in 2002, You/Play with Me, which was produced by Greg <b>Haver.</b> The EP was financed through the Pynci scheme for new Welsh musicians and the release garnered radio airplay on BBC Radio 1's broadcast at Newport's T.J.'s. Jeff Killed John's music followed the nu metal trend set by bands such as Korn and Limp Bizkit. Shortly after, the band released another two-track EP titled Eye Spy. In 2003, their second EP was released titled Don't Walk Away. This was a promotional CD and was shipped to different record companies, {{as well as being}} given out locally in Bridgend. Bassist Crandle left the band on the eve of entering the recording sessions for the band's self-titled EP and was replaced by Jason James. The band then changed their name to Bullet for My Valentine and reworked their musical strategy; they decided to play heavy metal songs with [...] "harmony guitars and big angelic choruses," [...] according to frontman Tuck. In late 2003, they released their final EP before record labels actually began to notice their potential. This happened due to the sudden change in their strategy and sound, which the band claims came [...] "directly out of their heads." [...] Their self-titled EP consisted of five songs; most of the songs became precursors of tracks from The Poison.|$|E

The majority of Mwng {{was recorded}} [...] with Owen at Ofn Studios in Llanfaelog, Wales. According to Rhys, the band had to play in separate rooms to avoid the sound of one instrument bleeding onto the track of another during recording due to Ofn's small size. [...] "Y Gwyneb Iau" [...] and [...] "Ysbeidiau Heulog" [...] were recorded at Famous Studios in Cardiff, and were engineered by Greg <b>Haver,</b> while [...] "Y Teimlad" [...] was recorded at Real World Studios, Box, Wiltshire, and was engineered by Michael Brennan, Jr. [...] "Sarn Helen" [...] was recorded and engineered by keyboardist Cian Ciaran in his living room. Overdubs for all songs were added at Ofn with Owen, who also mixed the album at the studio along with the Super Furry Animals. Songs were recorded almost entirely live, with the band wanting to make a [...] "really immediate record" [...] as a reaction against the drawn out recording sessions for Guerilla and 1997's Radiator, which had taken several months and proved frustrating for the group. The version of [...] "Nythod Cacwn" [...] that appears on the album is the original demo, with [...] Rhys on drums. The band felt that, although the demo did not sound very professional, there was a warmth to it that {{would be impossible to}} recreate were the group to record the song again. The album's title translates into English as [...] "Mane". According to Rhys, the band did not have the mane of a particular animal in mind, but felt it could be [...] "an extension of a Super Furry Animal".|$|E
