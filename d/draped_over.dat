5|$|Defence from thermal {{weapons and}} fire attacks was usually water or other liquids such as urine; hides were soaked and <b>draped</b> <b>over</b> {{vulnerable}} wooden hoardings and siege engines, and vats and barrels of liquid were collected and stored by defenders and attackers. Hides were hung in an overlapping manner {{so that any}} water would run down the whole structure to extinguish flames.|$|E
5|$|Kruger's {{body was}} {{initially}} buried in The Hague, but was soon repatriated with British permission. After ceremonial lying in state, he was accorded a state funeral in Pretoria on 16 December 1904, the vierkleur of the South African Republic <b>draped</b> <b>over</b> his coffin, and buried {{in what is}} now called the Heroes' Acre in the Church Street Cemetery.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the quick}} {{shooting}} schedule, the rain forced several exterior scenes to be re-written to be shot inside. Other scenes were shot with a large tarp <b>draped</b> <b>over</b> the actors. Due {{to the fact that}} the rainfall was audible in the background, Corman used the film's score and an assortment of sound effects to drown out the noise. The first scene shot was Beverly Garland and John Ireland's love scene in a tree. The tree was home to a colony of red ants, who crawled all over the actors and repeatedly bit them.|$|E
5|$|On March 13, 2015 DC Comics {{released}} 25 Joker-themed variant {{covers for}} its various monthly series for release that June, {{in celebration of}} the character's 75th anniversary. Among them was a cover to Batgirl #41 by artist Rafael Albuquerque that took its inspiration from The Killing Joke. The cover depicts the Joker {{standing next to a}} tearful Batgirl, who has a red smile painted across her mouth. The Joker has one hand holding a revolver <b>draped</b> <b>over</b> Batgirl's shoulder and is pointing to her cheek with the other hand, as if gesturing to shoot her.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{alterations}} are {{visible to the}} naked eye as pentimenti. A piece of paper <b>draped</b> <b>over</b> the edge of the table is clearly visible in outline, despite having been painted over with detailing of the table itself. Sigismunda's index finger which was bent towards and perhaps touching the heart has been straightened, but the outline of the tip is still visible on the surface of the heart. A looped cord in the top right-hand corner is poorly concealed under the topmost layer of paint. It is also known that, to attempt to appease critics, Hogarth repainted the fingers of Sigismunda so that the blood that was previously there would no longer be visible.|$|E

5|$|McIntyre {{then began}} wrestling as a singles wrestler, {{immediately}} feuding with The Fabulous Moolah, unsuccessfully challenging her at Wrestlemania 2 (the referee counted the pin on McIntyre despite her left leg being <b>draped</b> <b>over</b> the bottom rope {{which should have}} stopped the count). She won the WWF Women's Championship on July 3, 1986 when she defeated Moolah at the Brisbane Festival Hall on the WWF's 1986 Australian tour, but Moolah regained the title six days later at the Sydney Entertainment Centre (the only two times the WWF Women's Championship changed hands in the Southern Hemisphere). Years later, Moolah called McIntyre the best female wrestler in Canada. In 1987, McIntyre consistently lost matches to Moolah and Sherri Martel. She also competed at the Survivor Series, teaming with Moolah, Rockin' Robin, and the Jumping Bomb Angels against Martel, Leilani Kai, Judy Martin, Donna Christanello, and Dawn Marie. By 1990, however, the women's division in the WWF was again on hiatus.|$|E
5|$|O'Sullivan {{began the}} 2005/2006 {{season at the}} Grand Prix, and reached the final, but lost 2–9 against John Higgins. In his last-32 match with Mark King at the UK Championship, O'Sullivan sat with a wet towel <b>draped</b> <b>over</b> his head {{for most of the}} contest, and lost 8–9. He then {{successfully}} defended his Premier League title. Having finished first in the league stage, he defeated Steve Davis 5–3 in the semi-finals, and Stephen Hendry 6–0 in the final. O'Sullivan then reached the final of the Masters, but lost 9–10 against Higgins. O'Sullivan skipped the Malta Cup, and then lost his opening matches at the next two ranking events, as he lost 1–5 against Ian McCulloch at the Welsh Open and 0–5 against James Wattana at the China Open.|$|E
5|$|People {{have been}} living in deserts for millennia. Many, such as the Bushmen in the Kalahari, the Aborigines in Australia and various tribes of North American Indians, were {{originally}} hunter-gatherers. They developed skills in the manufacture and use of weapons, animal tracking, finding water, foraging for edible plants and using the things they found in their natural environment to supply their everyday needs. Their self-sufficient skills and knowledge were passed down through the generations by word of mouth. Other cultures developed a nomadic way of life as herders of sheep, goats, cattle, camels, yaks, llamas or reindeer. They travelled over large areas with their herds, moving to new pastures as seasonal and erratic rainfall encouraged new plant growth. They took with them their tents made of cloth or skins <b>draped</b> <b>over</b> poles and their diet included milk, blood and sometimes meat.|$|E

5|$|Smith, {{a philosopher}} who forged the new {{discipline}} of economics, is, by contrast, depicted in contemporary attire, showing {{his concern for}} the practical matters of economic activity, a gown <b>draped</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder retains the connection to philosophy and academia. Smith's economic ideas are also encoded into the statue: the plough behind him represents the agrarian economics he supplanted, the beehive before, {{is a symbol of}} the industry he predicted would come. His hand, resting on a globe, is obscured by the gown: a literal presentation of Smith's famous metaphor of the invisible hand. The life-and-a-half size statue of Smith, is cast in bronze from a plaster model by the sculptor and was unveiled in 2008. It was funded by private subscriptions organised by the Adam Smith Institute.|$|E
5|$|The Nightmare {{simultaneously}} offers {{both the}} image of a dream—by indicating the effect of the nightmare on the woman—and a dream image—in symbolically portraying the sleeping vision. It depicts a sleeping woman <b>draped</b> <b>over</b> the end of a bed with her head hanging down, exposing her long neck. She is surmounted by an incubus that peers out at the viewer. The sleeper seems lifeless and, lying on her back, takes a position then believed to encourage nightmares. Her brilliant coloration is set against the darker reds, yellows, and ochres of the background; Fuseli used a chiaroscuro effect to create strong contrasts between light and shade. The interior is contemporary and fashionable and contains a small table on which rests a mirror, phial, and book. The room is hung with red velvet curtains which drape behind the bed. Emerging from a parting in the curtain is the head of a horse with bold, featureless eyes.|$|E
5|$|The seven British Army Infantry battalions of the Scottish Division, {{plus the}} Scots Guards and Royal Scots Dragoon Guards regiments, use the Saltire {{in a variety}} of forms. Combat and {{transport}} vehicles of these Army units may be adorned with a small, (130x80mm approx.), representation of the Saltire; such decals being displayed on the front and/or rear of the vehicle. (On tanks these may also be displayed on the vehicle turret). In Iraq, during both Operation Granby and the subsequent Operation Telic, the Saltire was seen to be flown from the communications whip antenna of vehicles belonging to these units. Funerals, conducted with full military honours, of casualties of these operations in Iraq, (plus those killed in operations in Afghanistan), have also been seen to include the Saltire; the flag being <b>draped</b> <b>over</b> the coffin of the deceased on such occasions.|$|E
50|$|To {{increase}} {{traffic safety}} for children commuting {{to and from}} school, many communities have begun working with The Institute for Traffic Safety (kōtsū anzen kyōkai) to distribute yellow plastic covers that <b>drape</b> <b>over</b> {{the back of the}} randoseru to increase its visibility.|$|R

5|$|The video {{begins when}} a young man is seen walking alone {{in a small town}} to the snowy {{football}} fields in a morning winter. A cut-scene shows Swift inside a house wearing a comfy sweater <b>draped</b> <b>over</b> one shoulder. She is brooding and singing about her lost love while wandering morosely around her apartment. She is also seen sitting in the bathtub, missing her boyfriend who she didn't treat well when they were together. About halfway through, it starts to snow inside the spacious house. A montage of Swift writing a letter is shown alternately with scenes of her boyfriend strolling around the town. It is then revealed that the whole situation is the aftermath of a break-up between Swift and her boyfriend. It is also shown that Swift slips the letter that she has written in his coat pocket before he leaves. The final scene shows her ex-boyfriend sitting in the bleachers, reading her apology letter.|$|E
5|$|When {{the pilgrims}} reach the {{appropriate}} Miqat (depending on where they're coming from), they {{enter into a}} state of holiness – known as Ihram – that consists of wearing two white seamless cloths for the male, with the one wrapped around the waist reaching below the knee and the other <b>draped</b> <b>over</b> the left shoulder and tied at the right side; wearing ordinary dress for the female that fulfills the Islamic condition of public dress with hands or face uncovered; taking ablution; declaring the intention (niyah) to perform pilgrimage and to refraining from certain activities such as clipping the nails, shaving any part of the body, having sexual relations; using perfumes, damaging plants, killing animals, covering head (for men) or the face and hands (for women); getting married; or carrying weapons. The ihram is meant to show equality of all pilgrims in front of God: there is no difference between the rich and the poor.|$|E
5|$|Despite some claims, {{such as that}} by the {{historian}} Max von Boehm, that the largest crinolines measured up to ten yards (30feet) around, the photohistorian Alison Gernsheim concluded that the maximum realistic circumference was in fact between five-and-a-half and six yards. Whilst a loosely gathered skirt <b>draped</b> <b>over</b> a large hoop would certainly require a higher yardage, Gernsheim noted that ten yard hems were highly improbable. Staged photographs showing women wearing exaggeratedly large crinolines were quite popular, such as a widely published sequence of five stereoscope views showing a woman dressing {{with the assistance of}} several maids who require long poles to lift her dress over her head and other ingenious means of navigating her enormous hoopskirt. Such photographs, which re-enacted contemporary caricatures rather than accurately reflecting reality, were aimed towards the voyeur's market. However, it was a fact that the size of the crinoline often caused difficulties in passing through doors, boarding carriages and generally moving about. By the late 1860s many crinolines were of a significantly reduced size, as noted by a Victoria and Albert Museum curator observing the sizes of cage crinolines in the Museum's collection.|$|E

5|$|The {{engagement}} {{was declared}} on 5 December 1865, {{and despite the}} Prince of Wales's initial refusal to attend, Princess Alice intervened, and the wedding was a happy occasion. The Queen allowed the ceremony to take place at Windsor Castle, albeit in the Private Chapel rather than the grander St George's Chapel on 5 July 1866. The Queen relieved her black mourning dress with a white mourning cap which <b>draped</b> <b>over</b> her back. The main participants filed into the chapel {{to the sound of}} Beethoven's , creating a spectacle only marred by the sudden disappearance of Prince George, the Duke of Cambridge, who had a sudden gout attack. Christian filed into the chapel with his two supporters, Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar and Prince Frederic of Schleswig-Holstein, and Helena was given away by her mother, who escorted her up the aisle with the Prince of Wales and eight bridesmaids. Christian looked older than he was, and one guest commented that Helena looked as if she was marrying an aged uncle. Indeed, when he was first summoned to Britain, he assumed that the widowed Queen was inspecting him as a new husband for herself rather than as a candidate for one of her daughters. The couple spent the first night of their married life at Osborne House, before honeymooning in Paris, Interlaken and Genoa.|$|E
