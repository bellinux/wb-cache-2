40|$|A {{detailed}} {{investigation of}} the Raman response of the inner tube radial breathing modes (RBMs) in double-wall carbon nanotubes is reported. It revealed {{that the number of}} observed RBMs is two to three times larger than the number of possible tubes in the studied frequency range. This unexpected increase in Raman lines is attributed to a splitting of the inner tube response. It is shown to originate from the possibility that one type of inner tube may form in different types of outer tubes {{and the fact that the}} inner tube RBM frequency depends on the diameter of the <b>enclosing</b> <b>tube.</b> Finally, a comparison of the inner tube RBMs and the RBMs of tubes in bundles gave clear evidence that the interaction in a bundle is stronger than the interaction between inner and outer tubes.

40|$|Wounding is {{a severe}} {{impairment}} of function, especially for an exposed organism like the network-forming true slime mould Physarum polycephalum. The tubular network {{making up the}} organism's body plan is entirely interconnected and shares a common cytoplasm. Oscillatory contractions of the <b>enclosing</b> <b>tube</b> walls drive the shuttle streaming of the cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic flows underlie the reorganization of the network for example by movement toward attractive stimuli or away from repellants. Here, we follow the reorganization of P. polycephalum networks after severe wounding. Spatial mapping of the contraction changes in response to wounding reveal a multi-step pattern. Phases of increased activity alternate with cessation of contractions and stalling of flows, giving rise to coordinated transport and growth at the severing site. Overall, severing surprisingly acts like an attractive stimulus enabling healing of severed tubes. The reproducible cessation of contractions arising during this wound-healing response may open up new venues to investigate the biochemical wiring underlying P. polycephalum's complex behaviours...|$|E

40|$|Inexpensive {{synthesis}} of electroceramic materials {{is required for}} efficient energy storage. Here {{the design of a}} scalable process, flame spray pyrolysis (FSP), for {{synthesis of}} size-controlled nanomaterials is investigated focusing on understanding the role of air entrainment (AE) during their aerosol synthesis with emphasis on battery materials. The AE into the enclosed FSP reactor is analysed quantitatively by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and calculated temperatures are verified by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Various Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 (LTO) particle compositions are made and characterized by N 2 adsorption, electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction while the electrochemical performance of LTO is tested at various charging rates. Increasing AE decreases recirculation in the <b>enclosing</b> <b>tube</b> leading to lower reactor temperatures and particle concentrations by air dilution as well as shorter and narrower residence time distributions. As a result, particle growth by coagulation - coalescence decreases leading to smaller primary particles that are mostly pure LTO exhibiting high C-rate performance with more than 120 mAh/g galvanostatic specific charge at 40 C, outperforming commercial LTO. The effect of AE on FSP-made particle characteristics is demonstrated also in combustion synthesis of LiFePO 4 and ZrO 2...|$|E
40|$|Horz {{describes}} {{the evidence for}} lava tubes associated with rills in lunar photoimaging. These tubes have terrestrial counterparts as described by Billings, et al., and Gillet. The widths of these tubes range from 10 s to 100 s of meters. Their roof thickness are at least 0. 125 to 0. 25 times their widths and stand unsupported on the Moon. To confine one atmosphere of internal pressure, static roof thickness {{must be at least}} 16 m. Favorable locations of lava tubes may be surveyed using roving gravity meters on Doodle Bugs, which consist of platforms containing equipment for communication with Earth-based control stations. The stable - 20 C temperature of the lava tubes should provide a workable habitat environment. The greater than 16 m of basalt in the roof should give adequate radiation and impact protection. Typically, after clearing entries and grading ramps, habitats might be placed in tubes and inflated. Later, larger habitats might be built by <b>enclosing</b> <b>tube</b> sections with compacted-regolith dams. The interior can then be sealed to hold an atmosphere. The huge lava tubes inferred from the photographs are capable of providing habitats hundreds of meters wide, in lengths of kilometers...|$|E

50|$|Riders {{begin by}} {{climbing}} 65 {{feet to the}} top of the Blastenhoff tower. Two-passenger rafts are brought {{to the top of}} the tower on a conveyor belt. After passengers board and once the blocking systems indicates the channel ahead is clear, a small conveyor rolls the raft forward into the first drop â€” the ride's largest. At the bottom of the drop, water jets propel the raft uphill into a small dip and then another short uphill section. The raft then enters an <b>enclosed</b> <b>tube</b> section and travels 190 degrees back the other direction. This section features two drops and two uphill blasts followed by a right turn in an <b>enclosed</b> <b>tube.</b> Upon exiting the tube the raft drops downhill, turns right again then drops downhill a second time. Another uphill blast leads to a downhill section then the final uphill blast sends the rafts into an <b>enclosed</b> <b>tube</b> with a right turn helix followed by a left turn then a final small drop into the splash pool.|$|R

50|$|In 2003, Wildwater Kingdom was overhauled. Several older body slides {{were removed}} and {{replaced}} with four modern colored body slides, two of which were open and two of which were <b>enclosed</b> <b>tube</b> slides. Three inflated tube slides were also added. One of the slides is mostly open and straight down, another is winding and completely enclosed, and the third slide also winds but is partially open. A new children's water play area was also added. In July, the park announced that Hercules would close Labor Day and in 2005 be replaced by Hydra the Revenge, a $13 million, steel floorless Bolliger & Mabillard coaster. Hercules closed and would be replaced {{as a result of}} high maintenance costs, a rough ride, and low ridership. Soon after, it was demolished, reducing the coaster count to eight.|$|R
50|$|Wildwater Kingdom has 22 water slides, three aquatic playlands for children, a water funhouse, two tubing rivers, two wave {{pools and}} other water rides.

The season pass lot was eliminated and now season pass holders must park in the regular lot at no additional cost. In 2007, a six-lane mat racing water slide called the Aqua Racer was added, sponsored by Capital BlueCross. Two <b>enclosed</b> <b>tube</b> slides (Torpedo Tubes) were dismantled {{at the end of}} 2006. In 2014, Wildwater Kingdom opened a new slide complex called Snake Pit. Snake Pit features 6 slides total and includes Python Plummet, Boa Blasters, and Constrictor. Riptide Run and The Lily Pads were removed to make way for Snake Pit.|$|R
