5|$|Because viruses use vital {{metabolic}} pathways within host {{cells to}} replicate, they {{are difficult to}} eliminate without using <b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> cause toxic effects to host cells in general. The most effective medical approaches to viral diseases are vaccinations to provide immunity to infection, and antiviral <b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> selectively interfere with viral replication.|$|E

5|$|An {{irreversible}} inhibitor permanently inactivates the enzyme, {{usually by}} forming a covalent bond to the protein. Penicillin and aspirin are common <b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> act in this manner.|$|E
25|$|Consolidation {{chemotherapy}} {{is given}} after remission {{in order to}} prolong the overall disease-free time and improve overall survival. The <b>drug</b> <b>that</b> is administered {{is the same as}} the <b>drug</b> <b>that</b> achieved remission.|$|R

5|$|Doxorubicin {{and several}} {{chemotherapeutic}} drugs (including cyclophosphamide) cause dyspigmentation. Other groups of <b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> cause this problem include antimalarials, amiodarone, heavy metals (but not iron), tetracyclines, and antipsychotics.|$|E
5|$|If the {{symptoms}} of delayed ischemia do not improve with medical treatment, angiography may be attempted to identify the sites of vasospasms and administer vasodilator medication (<b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> relax the blood vessel wall) directly into the artery. Angioplasty (opening the constricted area with a balloon) may also be performed.|$|E
5|$|Several <b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> target {{molecular}} pathways in {{lung cancer}} are available, {{especially for the}} treatment of advanced disease. Erlotinib, gefitinib and afatinib inhibit tyrosine kinase at the epidermal growth factor receptor. Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand. It may be useful in the treatment of bone metastases.|$|E

5|$|The {{condition}} {{is difficult to}} treat, and may involve fillings, fluoride to fight tooth decay and <b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> increase saliva for dry mouth, as well as oral hygiene instruction. It can be medically dangerous for active methamphetamine users because of the cardiac problems that can result from the interaction of local anesthetic with the drug.|$|E
5|$|Treatment of {{the thyroid}} disease usually leads to {{resolution}} of the paralytic attacks. Depending {{on the nature of}} the disease, the treatment may consist of thyrostatics (<b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> reduce production of thyroid hormone), radioiodine, or occasionally thyroid surgery.|$|E
5|$|During {{her second}} year, Geiling was {{retained}} by the FDA to research unusual deaths related to elixir sulfanilamide, a sulfonamide medicine. Kelsey assisted on this research project, {{which showed that}} the 107 deaths were caused {{by the use of}} diethylene glycol as a solvent. The next year, the United States Congress passed the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938. That same year she completed her studies and received a Ph.D. in pharmacology at the University of Chicago. Working with Geiling led to her interest in teratogens, <b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> cause congenital malformations (birth defects).|$|E

5|$|Fasting {{is a risk}} factor, {{possibly}} because of depletion of liver glutathione reserves. The concomitant use of the CYP2E1 inhibitor isoniazid {{increases the risk of}} hepatotoxicity, though whether 2E1 induction is related to the hepatotoxicity in this case is unclear. Concomitant use of other <b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> induce CYP enzymes, such as antiepileptics including carbamazepine, phenytoin, and barbiturates, have also been reported as risk factors.|$|E
5|$|HIV {{infections are}} usually {{treated with a}} {{combination}} of antiviral drugs, each targeting a different stage in the virus's life-cycle. There are <b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> prevent the virus from attaching to cells, others that are nucleoside analogues and some poison the virus's enzymes that it needs to reproduce. The success of these drugs is proof of the importance of knowing how viruses reproduce.|$|E
5|$|Heterodimeric {{antibodies}} have {{a greater}} range in shapes they can take and the <b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> {{are attached to the}} arms don’t have to be the same on each arm, allowing for different combinations of drugs to be used in cancer treatment. Pharmaceuticals are able to produce highly functional bispecific, and even multispecific, antibodies. The degree to which they can function is impressive given that such a change shape from the natural form should lead to decreased functionality.|$|E

5|$|Medications may be {{prescribed}} to treat sleep problems and depression. Analgesics such as ibuprofen {{can be taken}} for headache, but paracetamol (acetaminophen) is preferred {{to minimize the risk}} of intracranial hemorrhage. Concussed individuals are advised not to use alcohol or other <b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> have not been approved by a doctor as they can impede healing. Activation database-guided EEG biofeedback has been shown to return the memory abilities of the concussed individual to levels better than the control group.|$|E
5|$|Nausea and {{vomiting}} are largely determined by {{activity in the}} area postrema in the medulla of the brainstem, in a region known as the chemoreceptor trigger zone. This area contains a large population of type D2 dopamine receptors. Consequently, <b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> activate D2 receptors have a high potential to cause nausea. This group includes some medications that are administered for Parkinson's disease, {{as well as other}} dopamine agonists such as apomorphine. In some cases, D2-receptor antagonists such as metoclopramide are useful as anti-nausea drugs.|$|E
5|$|Tetrabenazine was {{approved}} in 2008 {{for treatment of}} chorea in Huntington's disease in the US. Other <b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> help to reduce chorea include neuroleptics and benzodiazepines. Compounds such as amantadine or remacemide are still under investigation but have shown preliminary positive results. Hypokinesia and rigidity, especially in juvenile cases, can be treated with antiparkinsonian drugs, and myoclonic hyperkinesia can be treated with valproic acid.|$|E

5|$|The pilot {{episode of}} the American {{animated}} television series Sit Down, Shut Up originally aired in the United States on April 19, 2009 on the Fox network. The episode introduced the faculty and staff at Knob Haven High School in the fictional town of Knob Haven, Florida. In the episode, the school is facing a financial crisis and acting principal Sue Sezno has to either fire a teacher or make sure the school wins a football game. Meanwhile, assistant principal Stuart Proszakian becomes addicted to <b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> were found in a student's locker.|$|E
5|$|The two neurotransmitters {{that are}} used most widely in the {{vertebrate}} brain are glutamate, which almost always exerts excitatory effects on target neurons, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is almost always inhibitory. Neurons using these transmitters {{can be found in}} nearly every part of the brain. Because of their ubiquity, <b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> act on glutamate or GABA tend to have broad and powerful effects. Some general anesthetics act by reducing the effects of glutamate; most tranquilizers exert their sedative effects by enhancing the effects of GABA.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of <b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> can help prevent or {{interrupt}} malaria in travelers to places where infection is common. Many of these drugs are also used in treatment. Chloroquine may be used where chloroquine-resistant parasites are not common. In places where Plasmodium is resistant to one or more medications, three medications—mefloquine (Lariam), doxycycline (available generically), or the combination of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride (Malarone)—are frequently used when prophylaxis is needed. Doxycycline and the atovaquone plus proguanil combination are the best tolerated; mefloquine is associated with death, suicide, and neurological and psychiatric symptoms.|$|E
