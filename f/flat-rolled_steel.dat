In this compliance proceeding, the United States claimed that the Redetermination issued by China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) continued to violate WTO law. At {{the center of the}} dispute were MOFCOM’s findings that the US imports had the effect of suppressing and/or depressing the prices of domestic like products. While the Panel reached the conclusion that the MOFCOM findings were inconsistent with WTO rules, it did not clarify the criteria for determining such price effects. In this comment, we call for the adoption of a clearer and more objective standard for determining price suppression/depression in antidumping and countervailing duty investigations, via the tools of economic modeling...|$|R

40|$|During {{the past}} quarter-century, the American {{iron and steel}} {{industry}} has undergone far-reaching structural changes. Until the mid- 1980 s the established, integrated producers responded to these changes with essentially defensive measures. Then they began to embark on a radically new strategy [...] the establishment of joint ventures with foreign, especially Japanese, competitors. So far, these ventures have been concentrated in the production of <b>flat-rolled,</b> galvanized <b>steels,</b> for which the automotive industry is the main customer. American firms were motivated mainly by the belated recognition of a technology gap and by the prospect of infusions of capital from their partners. The Japanese producers saw in strategic partnering a hedge against protectionism and an opportunity to supply the growing coated-products market, which included increasing numbers of Japanese "transplant" automobile manufacturers. While {{it is too early to}} assess the implications of these moves in terms of the steel industry's potential globalization, it seems clear that the joint ventures have upgraded domestic firms' technological and managerial capabilities, as well as providing customer industries with improved products. For policy-makers, they have raised questions about the meaning of "the national interest" as a justification for protecting an industry like iron and steel. steel industry joint ventures technology transfer business strategy...|$|R
50|$|With {{sixty percent}} of Canada's steel being {{produced}} in Hamilton by Stelco and Dofasco, the city {{has become known as}} the Steel Capital of Canada. After nearly declaring bankruptcy, Stelco returned to profitability in 2004. On August 26, 2007 United States Steel Corporation acquired Stelco for C$38.50 in cash per share, owning more than 76 percent of Stelco's outstanding shares. On September 17, 2014, US Steel Canada announced that it was applying for bankruptcy protection {{and that it would be}} closing down its Hamilton operations.Dofasco, in 1999, was the most profitable steel producer in North America and in 2000, the most profitable in Canada. It currently has approximately 7,300 employees at its Hamilton plant and produces over four million tons of steel annually, representing about 30% of Canada's <b>flat-rolled</b> sheet <b>steel</b> shipments. Dofasco is one of North America's most profitable steel companies, and Dofasco was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index in 2006 for the seventh year in a row. Dofasco produces steel products for the automotive, construction, energy, manufacturing, pipe and tube, appliance, packaging, and steel distribution industries. Dofasco is currently a stand-alone subsidiary of Arcelor Mittal, the world's largest steel producer. Previously ordered by the U.S. Department of Justice to divest itself of the Canadian company, Arcelor Mittal has now been allowed to retain Dofasco provided it sells several of its American assets instead.|$|R
40|$|International audienceNumerical {{simulation}} is used {{to study}} patented high-C <b>steel</b> <b>flat-rolled</b> wire cold forming processes. An elasto-plastic power law, identified from mechanical tests, is used into Forge 2005 ® finite element (FEM) package in order to describe the material behaviour during wire drawing followed by cold rolling. A through-process approach has been favoured, transferring residual wire-drawing stresses and strain into the flat-rolling preform. This mechanical analysis, associated with a triaxiality study, points to dangerous areas where fracture may initiate due to high tensile stresses. Lemaître's isotropic damage criterion, including crack closure effect, a - 1 / 3 cut-off value of stress triaxiality, and tension/compression damage asymmetry, has been used and has confirmed the previous analysis. A number of non-coalesced voids nucleated on inclusions have been observed in the Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), especially in high-deformation zones ("blacksmith's cross"). Their evolution has been simulated in the FEM model using spherical numerical markers, which deform into oblate or prolate ellipsoids. The deformation-induced morphological evolution of voids observed in the SEM compares well with the geometrical evolution of the markers, {{which suggests that the}} morphologies observed do not result from micro-crack propagation, but from material transport of the nucleated voids...|$|R

40|$|This paper explores whether imports or new {{technology}} {{has played a}} greater role in the recent restructuring of the American steel industry. A modified version of an injury index model developed by Pindyck and Rotemberg (1987) is used to analyze the comparative impact of steel imports and thin-slab minimills on capacity utilization rates in the <b>flat-rolled</b> <b>steel</b> industry. The analysis finds that, while rising import levels may have aggravated the decline of traditional steel production, the emergence of minimill production methods are a more fundamental cause of declining capacity utilization rates in the traditional steel sector...|$|E
30|$|Steel is the {{material}} of choice for a large number and very diverse industrial applications. Surface qualities along with other properties {{are the most important}} quality parameters, particularly for <b>flat-rolled</b> <b>steel</b> products. Traditional manual surface inspection procedures are awfully inadequate to ensure guaranteed quality-free surface. To ensure stringent requirements of customers, automated vision-based steel surface inspection techniques {{have been found to be}} very effective and popular during the last two decades. Considering its importance, this paper attempts to make the first formal review of state-of-art of vision-based defect detection and classification of steel surfaces as they are produced from steel mills. It is observed that majority of research work has been undertaken for cold steel strip surfaces which is most sensitive to customers' requirements. Work on surface defect detection of hot strips and bars/rods has also shown signs of increase during the last 10  years. The review covers overall aspects of automatic steel surface defect detection and classification systems using vision-based techniques. Attentions have also been drawn to reported success rates along with issues related to real-time operational aspects.|$|E
40|$|Increase of {{requirements}} to {{quality of the}} <b>flat-rolled</b> <b>steel</b> causes the appearance of new methods and im-provement of the well-known approaches to improving the geometry of thin-gage rolled steels. On modern rolling mills, control {{and management of the}} strips cross-section is carried out by a profile and flatness control system (PFC). The main channel of the influence of such systems on the geometric parameters of the rolled steel is the axial shifting of S-shaped working rolls in CVC (Continuous Variable Crown) mills. The performance of the PFC is determined by the correct choice of the initial (machining) profile of the working rolls. The paper discusses the way to improve the meth-odology of grinding S-shaped working rolls by taking into account the thermal deformations, arising from the contact with the hot strip. The mathematical model of the thermal condition of S-shaped rolls,which allows to predict the change of the roll’s thermal profile, gives the possibility to create the algorithm for the grinding of the working rolls in hot condition and increase the accuracy of performance of their machining profile...|$|E
40|$|This paper models {{linkages}} between {{upstream and downstream}} goods in the U. S. market for <b>flat-rolled</b> <b>steel.</b> These vertical linkages are important to account for when estimating the impact of trade restrictions on imports of flat rolled steel because some types of flat rolled steel are predominately used to produce other types of flat rolled steel {{and in some cases}} also make up a large share of their production costs. Previous research has modeled the {{linkages between}} upstream and downstream goods with CGE models and vertically linked partial equilibrium models. Drawing upon this literature, this paper builds a vertically linked version of the CES COMPAS model that incorporates vertical linkages as constant cross price elasticities in both downstream supply functions and upstream factor demand functions. Compared to estimates from the CES COMPAS without vertical linkages, introduction of a trade restriction increases demand for upstream goods and decreases supply of downstream goods, increasing prices of both upstream and downstream goods, while increasing shipments of upstream goods and decreasing shipments of downstream goods. In estimating the impact of the safeguard measures imposed on the flat rolled steel market, accounting for the vertical linkages is most important when estimating the impact on domestically produced slab since all downstream products produced from slab were subject to the safeguard tariffs.
