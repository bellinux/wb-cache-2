40|$|Simulations of <b>dry</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>friction</b> {{between a}} metal {{asperity}} and an incommensurate metal surface reveal unusual atomic processes. The lateral force exhibits a quasiperiodic variation with {{the displacement of}} an asperity; each period consists of two different stick-slip processes involving structural transitions. While one layer of asperity changes and matches the substrate lattice in the first slip, two asperity layers merge into a new one through a structural transition during the second slip. This leads to wear. The lateral force decreases abruptly during these slip stages, but it increases between two consecutive slips and resists the relative motion. The analysis of the order suggests that each structural transition {{is associated with a}} first-order phase transition. Nonadiabatic atomic rearrangements during these phase transitions involve a new kind of mechanism of energy dissipation in the <b>dry</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>friction...</b>|$|E

40|$|International audience— Usually, {{the joint}} {{transmission}} friction model for robots {{is composed of}} a viscous friction force and of a constant <b>dry</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>friction</b> force. However, according to the Coulomb law, the dry friction force depends linearly on the load driven by the transmission, which {{has to be taken}} into account for robots working with large variation of the payload or inertial and gravity forces. Moreover, for robots actuating at low velocity, the Stribeck effect must be taken into account. This paper proposes a new inverse dynamic identification model for n degrees of freedom (dof) serial robot, where the <b>dry</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>friction</b> force is a linear function of both the dynamic and the external forces, with a velocity-dependent coefficient. A new sequential identification procedure is carried out. At a first step, the friction model parameters are identified for each joint (1 dof), moving one joint at a time (this step has been validated in [23]). At a second step, these values are fixed in the n dof dynamic model for the identification of all robot inertial and gravity parameters. For the two steps, the identification concatenates all the joint data collected while the robot is tracking planned trajectories with different payloads to get a global least squares estimation of inertial and new friction parameters. An experimental validation is carried out with an industrial 3 dof robot...|$|E

40|$|The work {{is devoted}} to {{modelling}} of <b>dry</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>friction</b> between contacting surfaces and related problems of contact mechanics. To {{limit the number of}} physical phenomena involved, the studies are targeted to systems used in vacuum conditions, hence {{there is no need to}} consider environmental parameters, such as humidity or oxidation films. Although friction has been studied over many years, challenges remain for obtaining a comprehensive understanding and a quantitative description of influence of nanometre scale effects on friction at micro/macro levels. Many existing models are critically re-examined using ideas of nanoscience. The studies start from the classic Zhuravlev model well-known as the Greenwood - Williamson model representing rough surfaces as collections of spherical elastic asperities. Contact problems for bodies of various shapes are investigated using the Galin solution along with the Borodich rescaling formulae. The rescaling method is applied to indentation experiments by spherical and nominally sharp punches and then a way to model dry friction following Zhuravlev’s arguments is outlined. New ways for numerical simulations of <b>dry</b> <b>sliding</b> <b>friction</b> are presented assuming the friction force is defined by the total energy dissipated over the sliding distance. Novel hierarchical, multiscale, multilevel structural models for simulation of sliding dry friction are presented. The models reflect the physical mechanisms which are most relevant to dry friction at the specific length scales: the chemical interactions at the atomic scale, the adhesive (van der Waals) interactions at the nanoscale, and the mechanical interlocking of asperities and their coupling at the micro and macroscales. Although the models include some features of known models, the nanotribological interpretation of the features is novel. It is argued that the nano-asperities do not deform plastically due to the so-called Polonsky-Keer effect. The obtained results are in good agreement with the experimental observations found in literature...|$|E

Methodology. Graphitized hypoeutectoid, eutectoid and hypereutectoid steels have been used as a research material. Experimental alloys have been studied in the condition after thermal hardening.
