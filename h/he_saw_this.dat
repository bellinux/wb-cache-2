5|$|After {{the judges}} {{returned}} home, Lawrence {{was made a}} Baron for his work at Nuremberg, but Birkett received nothing. The lack of reward for his work pushed him into depression, which he took many months to recover from. He was eventually made a Privy Counsellor in the 1947 Birthday Honours list, but <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> as poor reward for the work he had put in at Nuremberg.|$|E

5|$|According to Znaniecki, {{sociology}} can {{be divided}} into the study of four dynamic social systems: social action theory, social relation theory, social actors theory, and social groups theory. Znaniecki saw social actions as the foundation of a society, as they give rise to more complex social relations, and <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> theory as the foundation of all the others. Unlike Max Weber, he did not believe that everything can be reduced to social actions; he was also quite skeptical of any insights coming from the science of psychology, which he held in low esteem.|$|E

5|$|In 1817 Heber {{accepted}} {{the post of}} canon at St Asaph, the relative proximity of which enabled the extra duties {{to be carried out}} without interfering with his parish work. His main literary task during these years was a biography and critical study of the complete works of the 17th-century cleric Jeremy Taylor; the works, with Heber's critique, were published in 15 volumes between 1820 and 1822. This period of Heber's life was saddened by the death, on 24 December 1818, of his infant daughter after a short illness. Two more daughters were born later, in 1821 and 1824 respectively; both lived to adulthood. In 1822 Heber was elected to the church office of Preacher of Lincoln's Inn, which would require a regular term of residence in London. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> both as an extension of his service to the Church and as a means of renewing contact with old friends.|$|E
5|$|In 1924 Tippett {{became the}} {{conductor}} of an amateur choir in the Surrey village of Oxted. Although <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> initially {{as a means}} of advancing his knowledge of English madrigals, his association with the choir lasted many years. Under his direction it combined with a local theatrical group, the Oxted and Limpsfield Players, to give performances of Vaughan Williams's opera The Shepherds of the Delectable Mountains and of Tippett's own adaptation of an 18th-century ballad opera, The Village Opera. He passed his Bachelor of Music (BMus) exams, at his second attempt, in December 1928. Rather than continuing to study for a doctorate, Tippett decided to leave the academic environment. The RCM years had brought him intense and lasting friendships with members of both sexes, in particular with Francesca Allinson and David Ayerst.|$|E
5|$|Semantic {{challenges}} to divine command theory have been proposed; the philosopher William Wainwright argued {{that to be}} commanded by God and to be morally obligatory do not have an identical meaning, which he believed would make defining obligation difficult. He also contended that, as knowledge of God is required for morality by divine command theory, atheists and agnostics could not be moral; <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> as a weakness of the theory. Others have challenged the theory on modal grounds by arguing that, even if God's command and morality correlate in this world, they may not do so in other possible worlds. In addition, the Euthyphro dilemma, first proposed by Plato (in the context of polytheistic Greek religion), presented a dilemma which threatened either to leave morality subject to the whims of God, or challenge his omnipotence. Divine command theory has also been criticised for its apparent incompatibility with the omnibenevolence of God, moral autonomy and religious pluralism, although some scholars have attempted to defend the theory from these challenges.|$|E

25|$|While Ballard {{had been}} {{interested}} in the sea since an early age, his work at Woods Hole and his scuba diving experiences off Massachusetts spurred his interest in shipwrecks and their exploration. His work in the Navy had involved assisting {{in the development of}} small, unmanned submersibles that could be tethered to and controlled from a surface ship, and were outfitted with lighting, cameras, and manipulator arms. As early as 1973, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> as way of searching for the wreck of the Titanic. In 1977, he led his first expedition, which was unsuccessful.|$|E
25|$|Douglasa {{plaintiff}} and {{defendant in}} several trials for civil or criminal libel. In 1913 {{he was charged}} with libelling his father-in-law. Also in 1913 he accused Arthur Ransome of libelling him in his book Oscar Wilde: A Critical Study. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> trial as a weapon against his enemy Ross, not understanding that Ross would not be called to give evidence. The court found in Ransome's favour. Douglas was bankrupted by the failed libel suit. Ransome did, however, remove the offending passages from the 2nd edition of his book.|$|E
25|$|Franklin saw the {{printing}} press as a device to instruct colonial Americans in moral virtue. Frasca argues <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> as a service to God, because he understood moral virtue in terms of actions, thus, doing good provides a service to God. Despite his own moral lapses, Franklin saw himself as uniquely qualified to instruct Americans in morality. He tried to influence American moral life through construction of a printing network based on a chain of partnerships from the Carolinas to New England. Franklin thereby invented the first newspaper chain. It {{was more than a}} business venture, for like many publishers since, he believed that the press had a public-service duty.|$|E

25|$|Jean-Baptiste Lamarck had {{originally}} proposed a theory on the transmutation {{of species that}} was largely based on a progressive drive toward greater complexity. Lamarck also believed, as did many others at the time, that characteristics acquired {{during the course of}} an organism's life could be inherited by the next generation, and <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> as a secondary evolutionary mechanism that produced adaptation to the environment. Typically, such characteristics included changes caused by the use or disuse of a particular organ. It was this mechanism of evolutionary adaptation through the inheritance of acquired characteristics that much later {{came to be known as}} Lamarckism. Although Alfred Russel Wallace completely rejected the concept in favor of natural selection, Charles Darwin always included what he called Effects of the increased Use and Disuse of Parts, as controlled by Natural Selection in On the Origin of Species, giving examples such as large ground feeding birds getting stronger legs through exercise, and weaker wings from not flying until, like the ostrich, they could not fly at all.|$|E
25|$|On 28 August 1796 this {{combined}} Franco-Spanish {{squadron of}} 20 vessels, carrying 1,500 regular troops, appeared {{off the coast}} of Newfoundland. Considerable alarm was occasioned in England by the first accounts of these events in Newfoundland, the news being to the effect that the French had actually landed 1,500 men at Bay Bulls and 2,000 at Portugal Cove in Conception Bay, from which they were marching against St. John's., one of the most heavily fortified ports of North America, alongside New York Harbour and Boston, boasting one castle, five fortresses, six separate gun emplacements, and a defensive boom protecting the harbour's entrance. At St. John's the local garrison of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment, the Royal Artillery, the Royal Newfoundland Volunteers, aided by most able-bodied men, established a camp atop Signal Hill at the beginning of September. A boom was constructed across the harbour and three fire ships prepared. French Admiral Joseph de Richery, decided not to land after <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> force, and after hovering in the area for several days, he chose instead to land at Bay Bulls, 18 miles south of St. John's, on 4 September.|$|E
25|$|While the {{historic}} meeting for {{selection of a}} caliph was proceeding, Abdulrehman ibn Abu Bakr and Abdur Rahman bin Awf revealed that they saw the dagger used by Piruz, the assassin of Umar. A night before Umar's assassination, reported Abdur Rahman bin Awf, he saw Hormuzan, Jafina and Abu Lulu, while they were suspiciously discussing something. Surprised by his presence, the dagger fell; {{it was the same}} two-sided dagger used in the assassination. Abudulrehman ibn Abu Bakr, son of the late caliph Abu Bakr also confirmed that, a few days before Umar's assassination, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> dagger with Hurmuzan. After the mystery of the assassination was revealed by two of the most notable government figures, it seemed clear that it had been planned by the Persians residing in Medina. Infuriated by this, Umar's younger son Ubaidullah ibn Umar sought to kill all the Persians in Medina. He killed Hurmuzan, Jafinah, and the daughter of Umar's assassin Abu Lulu, who {{is believed to have been}} a Muslim. Ubaidullah was intercepted by the people of Medina, who prevented him from continuing the massacre. Amr ibn al-Aas is said to have intercepted him and convinced him to hand over his sword. The murder of Jafinah enraged Saad ibn Abi Waqqas, his foster brother, and he assaulted Ubaidullah ibn Umar; again the companions intervened. When Umar was informed about the incident, he ordered that Ubaidullah should be imprisoned and the next caliph should decide his fate.|$|E

500|$|Navigation on {{the first}} [...] from Burrowbridge to Ham Mill was much easier than on the final stretch to Taunton, and in 1638, John Mallett, the Sheriff of Somerset and member of {{parliament}} for Bath, obtained a Commission under the Great Seal from King Charles II. This granted him and his heirs sole navigation rights from Bridgwater to Ham Mills, and allowed him to improve the river at his own expense. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> as a philanthropic action, as it reduced the price of coal to the poor people of Taunton, as well as improving the transport infrastructure.|$|E

500|$|Smetana {{initially}} went to Gothenburg without Kateřina. Writing to Liszt, he {{said that}} the people there were musically unsophisticated, but <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> as an opportunity [...] "...for an impact I could never have achieved in Prague." [...] Within a few weeks of his arrival, he had given his first recital, opened a music school that was rapidly overwhelmed by applications, and become conductor of the Gothenburg Society for Classical Choral Music. In a few months Smetana had achieved both professional and social recognition in the city, although he found little time for composition; two intended orchestral works, provisionally entitled Frithjof and The Viking's Voyage, were sketched but abandoned.|$|E
500|$|Blaine {{is portrayed}} by actor Darren Criss, who had auditioned for Glee several times for several roles before the {{character}} Blaine was created. He originally auditioned to play Finn Hudson. Criss made several audition videos for Glee, {{of which he}} posted only one to the social networking website MySpace where he sang a cover of Bill Withers' song Lean on Me. Although the series writers have seen them, he considers them supplemental to his main audition, which was for series creator Ryan Murphy. Murphy had not seen any of Criss's previous auditions, but knew he was the right actor for Blaine as soon as <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> one. The actor cut his long hair before auditioning, to suit the [...] "serious and preppy" [...] role.|$|E
500|$|In 1962 Harper was a {{founding}} member of the Rhodesian Front (RF), an alliance of conservative voices centred around the former Dominion Party and defectors from the UFP. The party's declared goal was independence for Southern Rhodesia without radical constitutional change and without any set timetable for the introduction of majority rule. After the RF won a surprise victory in the November 1962 general election—Harper comfortably retained his seat in Gatooma, and elsewhere the country's first black MPs were elected—the new Prime Minister Winston Field made him Minister of Irrigation, Roads and Road Traffic in the new government. Over the next few years, Harper became one of the main agitators in the Cabinet for a unilateral declaration of independence (UDI); equating Southern Rhodesia to India, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> as a way to prevent a repeat of [...] "the same mistake".|$|E
5000|$|In 1916 Moellendorff {{developed}} {{the concept of}} [...] "social economy" [...] which was a variant of socialism in which rather than eliminating private property subordinates private interests to the society as a whole. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>this</b> might be implemented by an organisation like Bismarck's National Economic Council (Volkswirschaftsrat).
