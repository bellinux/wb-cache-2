Materials and Methods: Important factors in the derivatization and measurement processes were optimized using the one-factor-at-a-time method. The peak areas were assumed as the GC-MS response to evaluate the extraction efficiency of acrylamide, and optimization for all tests was performed two times. Figures of merit of the proposed method were evaluated. The amount of acrylamide in four potato chips samples, obtained from the market in Tehran city, was determined using the proposed method.

To account for the observed non-ideal capacitive behaviour, the coating capacitance and dielectric constant values were extracted from the EIS data in two ways: (i) by using a complex-capacitance representation and (ii) by fitting to the EIS data a model that assumed an exponential distribution of coating resistivity. The agreement of values obtained by these independent methods served to validate the model used to account for the observed pseudo constant-phase-element (CPE) behaviour of the coatings.

To explore the potential of airborne <b>gravimetry,</b> the <b>Gravimetry</b> <b>using</b> Airborne Inertial Navigation (GAIN) project was recently established at the faculty of Aerospace Engineering at TU-Delft, and is currently building and testing an in-house strapdown airborne gravimetry system with the objective of providing low-cost, high-accuracy gravity data for use {{in a wide range of}} applications in geodesy and geophysics. Within this thesis, the inertial sensors that will be used within the GAIN strapdown IMU are calibrated and modeled with a simulator to predict the accuracy of the airborne system when completed. A sensitivity study of several campaign parameters is done to understand which parts of the hardware and operating conditions are critical to the performance of the system. Of the list of applications for airborne gravity data, natural resource exploration is one of the more demanding in terms of accuracy and resolution, with a requirement of 0. 5 - 2 mGal at 2 km resolution. This is beyond the range of current strapdown systems, so in addition to assessing the performance of the current strapdown system, additional tests were made to see what would be needed to achieve this higher level of accuracy. The simulation results suggest that the performance of the GAIN strapdown system, under ideal conditions, would be 1. 4 mGal at 2 km resolution. Furthermore, the performance is limited by the accelerometers whose accuracy must improve by a factor of three before the 0. 5 mGal level can be achieved; however, other options were identified that could also be used to achieve this.

We discuss the methods used to derive diffusion coefficients, and concentration of the sorbed species, from capacitance measurements. As such, we postulate that the cause of anomalous diffusion behaviour {{is due to the fact}} that the penetrant enters the polymer because of classical diffusion down the concentration gradients, which are modified a result of the time dependence of the surface concentration. Hence, an apparent two-stage sorption profile is not necessarily significant in a heterogeneous coating and Brasher's equation remains the most appropriate for data analysis. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Tools sand filter with Reverse Osmosis technology is affecting the decrease in Total Solid and hardness. For Solid analysis, from minute 0 to minute 45, each getting a yield of 0. 004 mg / L, 0. 0024 mg / L, 0. 0004 mg / L, 0. 0032 mg / L. while for analysis Hardness of minutes to 0 up to the 45 th minute, respectively to get the result of 8. 8 ppm, 4. 8 ppm, 5. 2 ppm, 3. 2 ppm and from the results of organoleptic test sample initially becomes turbid clear, odor of the samples initially rotten becomes odorles...|$|R
