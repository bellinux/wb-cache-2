5000|$|The TO-3 {{case has}} {{a flat surface}} which can be {{interfaced}} to a heatsink, normally via a thermally conductive but electrically <b>insulating</b> <b>washer.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Thermocouple {{connection}} in gas appliances. The end ball (contact) {{on the left}} is insulated from the fitting by an <b>insulating</b> <b>washer.</b> The thermocouple line consists of copper wire, insulator and outer metal (usually copper) sheath which is also used as ground.|$|E
40|$|Semiconductor package {{has been}} {{developed}} for high power semiconductor devices that operate in the GHz-frequency range at several watts. Package includes stud, insulating ring, electrically conductive washer, <b>insulating</b> <b>washer,</b> braze ring, and cap. It is mechanically strong {{and can be used}} with variety of circuits...|$|E
2500|$|Most {{higher quality}} {{instruments}} {{are designed to}} prevent or reduce galvanic corrosion between any steel in the valves and springs, and the brass of the tubing. [...] This may {{take the form of}} desiccant design, to keep the valves dry, sacrificial zincs, replaceable valve cores and springs, plastic <b>insulating</b> <b>washers,</b> or nonconductive or noble materials for the valve cores and springs. Some instruments use several such features.|$|R
5000|$|The metal package can be {{attached}} to a heat sink, making it suitable for devices dissipating several watts of heat. Thermal compound is used to improve heat transfer between the device case and the heat sink. Since the device case {{is one of the}} electrical connections, an insulator may be required to electrically isolate the component from the heatsink. <b>Insulating</b> <b>washers</b> may be made of mica or other materials with good thermal conductivity.|$|R
25|$|A magnetically {{shielded}} room (MSR) model {{consists of three}} nested main layers. Each of these layers is made of a pure aluminium layer, plus a high-permeability ferromagnetic layer, similar in composition to molybdenum permalloy. The ferromagnetic layer is supplied as 1mm sheets, while the innermost layer is composed of four sheets in close contact, and the outer two layers are composed of three sheets each. Magnetic continuity is maintained by overlay strips. <b>Insulating</b> <b>washers</b> {{are used in the}} screw assemblies to ensure that each main layer is electrically isolated. This helps eliminate radio frequency radiation, which would degrade SQUID performance. Electrical continuity of the aluminium is also maintained by aluminium overlay strips to ensure AC eddy current shielding, which is important at frequencies greater than 1Hz. The junctions of the inner layer are often electroplated with silver or gold to improve conductivity of the aluminium layers.|$|R
40|$|Improved thermal-switch disks {{help protect}} {{electrical}} batteries against high currents like those due to short circuits or high demands for power in circuits supplied by batteries. Protects batteries against excessive temperatures. Centered by <b>insulating</b> fiberglass <b>washer.</b> Contains conductive polymer that undergoes abrupt increase in electrical resistance when excessive current raises its temperature above specific point. After cooling, polymer reverts to low resistance. Disks reusable...|$|R
