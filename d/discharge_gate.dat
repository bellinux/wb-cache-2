40|$|Abstract. A {{vertical}} {{livestock feed}} mixer with spring-controlled packaging unit was designed, constructed and tested. This design had in focus a weighing and gauging mechanism which made possible a semi-automatic packaging {{in conjunction with}} feed mixing and discharge operations. The main components of the machine included a double-wall cylindrical mixing chamber consisting of recycling gate, <b>discharge</b> <b>gate,</b> evacuating gate, window and a screw conveyor inside an inner cylinder. The packaging mechanism {{is attached to the}} <b>discharge</b> <b>gate</b> and the base of the frame with the frame serving as the structural support for the machine and its contents. The main design parameters included screw conveyor features such as helix angle, fill ratio, normal pressure due to bulk load on screw shaft, axial force per pitch, total screw torque, capacity and power requirements of the screw conveyor. The design concept of the packaging mechanism involved determination of free length of spring, total active length, pitch of spring, spring index, stiffness of spring, maximum shear stress and total spring rate. In a hitch-free operation, the machine was designed to package 25 kg of mixed feed ingredients at a time. In operation, the feed ingredients are scooped and moved upward by the rotary movement of the screw conveyor and then sprayed back into the smaller cylinder without passing through the internal tube. A preliminary testing was carried out on the machine to determine the actual discharge rate and hence the performance of the packaging mechanism. Results revealed that an average discharge rate of 0. 356 kg/s was obtained. Powered by a 2 hp single phase electric motor, the machine has a mixing capacity of 4. 124 m 3 /h with a production cost of $ 470. Nomenclatur...|$|E
40|$|Air vent {{systems are}} {{designed}} to protect hydropower penstocks and reservoir outlets under various operating conditions. During an emergency closure of an upstream gate the hydraulic jump that forms downstream of the gate is not stationary and may advance downstream potentially increasing the total air demand. A lab-scale physical model of a general outlet works piping configuration was constructed at Reclamation’s Hydraulics Laboratory in Denver, CO to observe hydraulic jump behavior during emergency gate closures. Parameters including gate <b>discharge,</b> <b>gate</b> closure rate, air vent size, and downstream pipe pressure were tested at two different pipe slopes. Results indicate that the hydraulic jump travel speed is dependent on air vent size as well as gate closure rate, both of which affect the internal pressure in the pipe near the vent connection. For a shallow-sloped pipe, the jump speed remains steady throughout the entire pipe length if the air supply is sufficient. However, if air flow is significantly reduced due to an undersized air vent, unsteady travel speeds and pressure surges were observed. This {{was not the case}} for a steep-sloped pipe which produced steady jump speeds for all vent sizes. Once completed, these results are expected to be applicable for prediction of hydraulic jump travel speed and its effects on air demand for vent sizing considerations based on hydraulic operating conditions...|$|E
40|$|Wall flumes are {{vertical}} conduits {{attached to}} the walls of grain bins through which grain can flow. Flumes are thought to encourage funnel flow throughout {{the height of the}} bin while reducing the dynamic loads and moments associated with plug flow and side unloading. Discharge outlets from the flume can be placed at any location along the vertical line of the flume. Tests were performed with soft red winter wheat in a smooth-walled, model grain bin 2. 44 m in diameter and 7. 44 m tall, constructed of galvanized steel. Tests were conducted both with and without the flume. During unloading, the wall flume created an Ã¢Â€ÂœartificialÃ¢Â€Â funnel flow regime within all parts of the bin which produced wall loads smaller than those measured during filling, other than at the onset of discharge in which a small load spike was observed. However, in unloading through the flume unbalanced wall loads were observed around the circumference of the bin, which produced overturning moments in the plug flow zone. Tests were conducted in which flow was transferred from the wall flume to the center <b>discharge</b> <b>gate.</b> This switch in the discharge position created wall loads significantly larger than those measured during filling at the flume location where the switch occurred. Operator caution should be used in performing these types of flow switches within bins when using wall flumes...|$|E

The variation of a large-scale spanwise vortex behind a sluice gate is examined and discussed. The suction effect on approaching flow near the pipe column is examined using numerical modeling.

40|$|In 1985, Dashidaira dam with <b>discharge</b> <b>gate</b> {{had been}} built {{for the first time}} in Japan, at Kurobe River in Toyama Prefecture. Six years later, in 1991, the dam sediments were flushed out for the first time and {{impacted}} on the downstream of Kurobe River. The dam sediments and the suspension contained a large amount of organic matter (with high C, N and S contents) with sludge-smell. The annual catch of bentic fishes (exp. flatfish) and the annual haul of wakame seaweed have been decreased year by year since the first discharge of the dam sediments in 1991. Until now, it has been reported that the sludge has deposited in the Toyama Bay which is apprehensive of influence of discharged dam sediments, because suspended particles affect the fish's gill respiration. In this study, suspension of river water were collected at three bridges during discharge from Dashidaira and Unazuki Dam in June 19 th- 22 nd and in June 30 th-July 2 nd, 2001. River water quality and suspended solid were analyzed chemically, physically and mineralogically. Extremely low DO and Eh values were observed at the periods during first discharge in June 19 th- 22 nd at two bridges. Moreover, during second discharge in June 30 th-July 2 nd, DO and Eh values were constant. Therefore it was shown that drastic decreased of DO and Eh values were a peculiar phenomenon during first discharge in June 19 th- 22 th, 2001. The results of NCS elemental analyses were suggested that high organic contents were related with drastic decreased of DO and Eh values. Clay mineralogy of both Unazuki Dam sediments and suspended solid on the seabed at the offing of Kurobe River mouth, show abundant semctite with chlorite, mica clay minerals and kaolin minerals, suggesting those are the almost same origin. The dam sediments associated with organic matter impacted on downstream and the seabed, and was the cause of affecting bentic fishes and wakame seaweed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Cavitation, usually {{known as}} a {{destructive}} phenomenon, involves turbulent unsteady two-phase flow. Having such features, cavitating flows have been turned to a challenging topic in numerical studies and many researches are being done for better understanding of bubbly flows and proposing solutions to reduce its consequent destructive effects. Aeration may be regarded as an effective protection against cavitation erosion in many hydraulic structures, like gated tunnels. The paper concerns numerical simulation of flow in <b>discharge</b> <b>gated</b> tunnel of a dam using RNG ε−k model coupled with the volume of fluid (VOF) method and the zone which is susceptible of cavitation inception in the tunnel is predicted.

40|$|Abstract: The “Afsluitdijk” is an icon in the Netherlands. It is the 32 km long closure barrier, which {{separates}} {{the nature of}} the tidal Wadden Sea from the fresh IJssel lake. It was built for safety and economic developments between 1927 and 1932. Fish like salmon, eel and smelt, have great trouble in passing the remaining <b>discharge</b> <b>gates</b> near Den Oever and Kornwerderzand. The “FishMigrationRiver (FMR) Afsluitdijk” is a unique project near Kornwerderzand, allowing a variety of fish to reach their spawn, bread and living grounds. The FMR creates an intertidal zone, where fresh and saline water meet and fish might migrate, without jeopardizing the safety or increasing the salinity on the IJssel lake. Call it a barrier for water and salt, but open for fish almost continuously. An important step for the evaluation of the functioning of the FMR is the hydraulic operability. A series of hydrodynamic investigations was carried out to evaluate the various aspects of the FMR.

Previous works examined <b>gate</b> <b>discharge</b> ratings under low supply-channel flow velocity perpendicular to the <b>gate</b> <b>discharge</b> pipeline. Here, additional testing was conducted to test the hypothesis that higher velocities in the supply channel would show decreased meter gate flow compared to the low-velocity ratings, but that the published gate calibration method would still yield accurate flow-rate calculations. All testing was conducted in a test facility with the <b>gate</b> <b>discharge</b> pipe set perpendicular to the supply channel, as is common in field installations. Velocities up to 0. 94 m=s (3. 1 ft=s) were tested with the smaller gate and 0. 66 m=s (2. 2 ft=s) for all other gates. These velocities are on the upper end of velocities found in common earthen irrigation canals (and in many lined channels at the farm delivery level) in California. Interestingly, results indicate that the Froude number of the supply-channel flow did not have a statistically significant (at an α-level of 0. 01) influence on <b>gate</b> <b>discharge</b> coefficients.
