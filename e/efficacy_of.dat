5|$|A related {{issue is}} the {{inclusion}} of pregnant women in clinical studies. Since other illnesses can exist concurrently with pregnancy, information is needed on the response to and <b>efficacy</b> <b>of</b> interventions during pregnancy, but ethical issues relative to the fetus, make this more complex. This gender bias is partly offset by the iniation of large scale epidemiology studies of women, such as the Nurses' Health Study (1976), Women's Health Initiative and Black Women's Health Study.|$|E

40|$|It {{is unknown}} why the potencies and <b>efficacies</b> <b>of</b> {{long-chained}} guanidine-type histamine H 2 -receptor (H 2 R) agonists are lower at the H 2 R of human neutrophils {{than at the}} H 2 R of the guinea pig atrium. To elucidate these differences, we analyzed fusion proteins of the human H 2 R (hH 2 R) and guinea pig H 2 R (gpH 2 R), respectively, and the short splice variant of Gs (GsS) ex-pressed in Sf 9 cells. The potencies and <b>efficacies</b> <b>of</b> small H 2 R agonists in the GTPase assay and the potencies of antagonists at inhibiting histamine-stimulated GTP hydrolysis by hH 2 R-GsS and gpH 2 R-GsS were similar. In contrast, the potencies and <b>efficacies</b> <b>of</b> guanidines were lower at hH 2 R-GsS than at gpH 2 R-GsS.

5|$|Natalizumab and {{mitoxantrone}} {{are considered}} highly effective {{both in terms}} of relapse rate reduction and halting disability progression, however, they are related to dangerous side-effects that have led them to be considered second-line treatments.

Moreover, mitoxantrone is also highly useful to reduce attacks and disability, but it is generally not considered as a long-term therapy due to its severe cardiac toxicity.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} <b>efficacies</b> <b>of</b> {{ethylene}} oxide gas (EOG), hydrogen peroxide gas plasma (PLASMA), and low-temperature steam formaldehyde (LTSF) sterilization methods.

All items were contaminated with Bacillus stea-rothermophilus spores or used a standard biological indicator.

Besides this, demographic characteristics are often less predictive than the attitudes jurors hold; for example, attitudes towards rape are better verdict-predictors than gender in rape trials.|$|E
5|$|The <b>efficacy</b> <b>of</b> {{chemical}} pesticides {{tends to}} diminish over time.

This necessitates higher concentrations of chemical, more frequent applications and a movement to more expensive formulations.|$|E
