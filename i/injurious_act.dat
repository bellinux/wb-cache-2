The thought that she herself might be what Will most cared for did throb through her an instant, but then came doubt: {{the memory of the}} little they had lived through {{together}} turned pale and shrank before the memory which suggested how much fuller might have been the intercourse between Will and some one else with whom he had had constant companionship. Everything he had said might refer to that other relation, and whatever had passed between him and herself was thoroughly explained by what she had always regarded as their simple friendship and the cruel obstruction thrust upon it by her husband's <b>injurious</b> <b>act.</b> Dorothea stood silent, with her eyes cast down dreamily, while images crowded upon her which left the sickening certainty that Will was referring to Mrs. Lydgate. But why sickening? He wanted her to know that here too his conduct should be above suspicion.|$|E

40|$|Parasomnia ” {{refers to}} unusual behavior, {{especially}} violent or <b>injurious</b> <b>acts,</b> associated with sleep. The term is invoked increasingly {{in the hope}} of absolving someone accused of violent nocturnal behavior from criminal and civil liability. In such cases, a sleep medicine specialist may be invited by law enforcement agencies, the legal community, or both to assist in the criminal investigation or to render a medical opinion about these often bizarre behaviors. It is thought that if these complex behaviors were performed while the person accused of the acts was still technically asleep then they were performed without consciousness or full awareness. In this way the defense team is able to develop a “sleepwalking defense” under the guise of classic automatism. This latter maneuver was first introduced in the British House of Lords around 1843 under the M’Naghten Rules and formulated upon the compassionate principle that it is morally wrong to punish an individual who is deprived, either permanently or temporarily, of the intent that is necessary for the act to be defined as a crime. It is likely that violence during the sleep period is more frequent than previousl...|$|R
40|$|The {{principle}} that a State {{is responsible for}} causing environmental harm outside its territory in breach of an international obligation {{has been slow to}} evolve to address the allocation of loss due to accidents. In settling the well-known dispute between the United States and Canada concerning the activities of the Canadian smelter located in Trail, British Columbia, the arbitral tribunal asserted a general duty {{on the part of the}} State to protect other States from injurious acts by individuals (both state and non-state actors) within its jurisdictions. The tribunal, however, noted the difficulty determining what constitutes an <b>injurious</b> <b>act,</b> but it may be concluded that a State 2 ̆ 7 s failure to regulate or prevent serious harm from polluting activities, in instances where it would protect its own inhabitants, would constitute a wrongful act. The Trail Smelter arbitration left open the question of whether a State exercising all due diligence would be liable if transfrontier harm results despite the State 2 ̆ 7 s best efforts - whether there would be strict liability. States appear hesitant to accept international rules that would oblige them to restrict or accept liability for activities whose harmful environmental consequences are likely to be limited to their own territory. Here, economic interests play a major political role. However, specific activities such as nuclear activities and marine pollution present a significant risk for the environment of the commons or of other States. While international law has been slow in placing the risk of loss on the actor profiting from the enterprise, economic globalization potentially could lead to progress by harmonizing the conditions of operation in certain fields of activities dangerous to human health and to the environment...|$|E
40|$|Circumstances {{of modern}} wars have placed service members {{at risk for}} harming noncombatants and {{engaging}} in other possible morally <b>injurious</b> <b>acts.</b> Studying a sample of 1, 203 combat veterans from the National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study (NVVRS), this investigation used structural equation modeling (SEM) to test (1) whether experiences of abusive violence are positively directly linked with drug or alcohol problems and suicidality when accounting for traditional combat stressors, and (2) to what extent experiences of abusive violence have positive indirect effects on these postdeployment outcomes via posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and war-related guilt. Overall, 40 % of the sample had witnessed or were directly involved in acts of abusive violence while deployed in Vietnam. When controlling {{for the effects of}} traditional combat stressors, SEM results revealed that exposure to acts of abusive violence in Vietnam was linked indirectly with substance abuse via PTSD symptoms and both directly and indirectly with suicidality via PTSD symptoms. There was also a significant link between atrocity exposure and war-related guilt in the model, but veterans’ remorse about behavior in Vietnam failed to uniquely predict study outcomes beyond the symptomatology of PTSD. These findings highlight the effects of disproportionate warzone violence on postdeployment mental health, while also suggesting the need for broader conceptual models of combat trauma...|$|R
5000|$|Judicial {{immunity}} is stated {{as providing}} [...] "the maximum ability judges to deal fearlessly and impartially with the public". The justification is as follows: {{because of the}} likelihood of innocent individuals being convicted {{in a court of}} law under false claims, the [...] "burden" [...] of being subjected to a court of law (a trial) would [...] "dampen" [...] the judges [...] "enthusiasm" [...] or [...] "passion". Opponents of judicial immunity argue that this doctrine is not adequately justified. For example, judges could be shielded from any personal capacity liability, and still be subject to official capacity liability so that they may be held accountable for their <b>injurious</b> <b>acts</b> -- thus [...] "balancing" [...] the [...] "evil" [...] to better protect the fundamental rights of victims. Judicial immunity does not protect judges from suits stemming from administrative decisions made while off the bench, like hiring and firing decisions. But immunity generally does extend to all judicial decisions in which the judge has proper jurisdiction, even if a decision is made with [...] "corrupt or malicious intent."

40|$|Drawing on Judith Butler’s {{concept of}} {{injurious}} speech, this article conceptualises the ‘Grexit’ crisis {{as a series}} of performances. More specifically, we investigate how the Greek government framed the bailout plans tabled by the Troika as a form of torture. By adopting phrases such as ‘fiscal water-boarding’, ‘asphyxiation’, and ‘suicide’, the Syriza government sought to narrate the harm inflicted on Greece by its creditors. Paying attention to this language is important as it casts new light on how Greek sovereign debt has been framed, negotiated, and contested. In many ways, the overarching objective {{of this article is to}} tell a different story that takes discursive transitivity and restaging into account. By shifting the emphasis onto injurious speech, the article also brings the unintended effects of this language into focus. Despite the recurrent accusations made by Syriza as it attempted to resolve the Greek sovereign debt crisis, this article questions whether their bargaining strategy ‘misfired’. On closer consideration, we find that the <b>injurious</b> speech <b>acts</b> performed by the Syriza government compromised their ability to negotiate a third bailout deal in 2015. The observations remind us that words can wound in ambivalent ways. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|In The Human Stain (2000), Philip Roth invokes {{what has}} come to be Philip Wylie 2 ̆ 7 s most lasting {{literary}} claim, railing against the bridle [that] is still on public rhetoric, the inspiration it provides for personal posturing, the persistence just about everywhere of this de-virilizing pulpit virtue-mongering that H. L. Mencken identified with boobism, that Philip Wylie thought of as Momism, that the Europeans unhistorically call American puritanism, that the likes of Ronald Reagan call America 2 ̆ 7 s core values, and that maintains widespread jurisdiction by masquerading itself as something else—as everything else [,…] a dominatrix in a thousand disguises (his emphasis, Roth 153). ^ Although Roth does not cite Wylie as being correct in laying blame for this “virtue-mongering” at the door of the feminine—for he writes that Wylie “thought of [this] as Momism” (my emphasis, Roth 153) —Roth redeploys a set of anxieties regarding the fear of emasculation and effeminization that are central to Wylie 2 ̆ 7 s Generation of Vipers (1942), Tomorrow! (1954), and Triumph (1962). Within Roth 2 ̆ 7 s The Human Stain, this fear of a “de-virilizing” presence in American society is referenced to the feminine: The Human Stain anthropomorphizes “propriety” in the figure of a “dominatrix,” a cruel and harsh mistress of culture (Roth 153). I use Roth 2 ̆ 7 s invocation of Philip Wylie 2 ̆ 7 s literary contributions to call attention to the lasting, but subtle, influence of this writer on American culture—and to note that Wylie 2 ̆ 7 s influence builds upon pre-existing aspects of American culture, such as the “American puritanism” that Roth directly refers to, and the Anglo-European traditions that inform this same “puritanism” (Roth 153). Philip Wylie 2 ̆ 7 s work modernizes, for his time, traditional modes of blaming, targeting, and taming the feminine, doing so under the guise of producing national, cultural, and personal reform. Wylie 2 ̆ 7 s backdrop—the field against which these <b>injurious</b> <b>acts</b> are performed, which is also a functional setting and means of injuring—is the possible event of nuclear holocaust. Tomorrow! and Triumph employ nuclear war in a process of violent cultural reformation. ^ Given his toxification of the feminine, Wylie has understandably come to be a somewhat toxic literary personage himself. However, this is one of the most pressing reasons that his writing demands study—especially from a feminist perspective. Reading Wylie through Michel Foucault, Elaine Scarry, and other like critics of process by which the human is an object of power, I approach the textual set of Generation of Vipers, Tomorrow!, and Triumph as a tripartite case: a body of knowledge, or a knowable body of sorts, which may be studied and written about so as to generate information that sheds light on archaic and persistent cultural pathologies, and provide an illustration of the culture of the Cold War. ...|$|R

40|$|Violent {{offending}} and injecting {{drug use}} (IDU) are highly comorbid, serious behaviours. Despite extensive empirical investigation, the mechanisms underpinning this comorbidity remain unclear, which is, in part, {{due to a}} widespread assumption that drug use causes violence. In an effort {{to better understand the}} liability to violent offending among IDU, this thesis aimed to answer three major unresolved issues: (i) Does drug use cause violence or do underlying factors predispose individuals to drug use and violence? (ii) Is there heterogeneity in the nature of, and risk profiles for, violent offending? (iii) Are risks for violent offending specific to IDU? Addressing these issues was possible through quantitative examination of two large epidemiological datasets: one of community-based IDU (N= 300) and a large treatment-based case-control sample (N= 1, 927). Analyses were structured according to a developmental framework that has not previously been used in this area. This framework focuses on the impact of early life predisposing factors on long term adverse behavioural outcomes. Violent offending was found to be highly prevalent among IDU, with a significant minority (approximately one-third) having committed a serious, <b>injurious</b> violent <b>act.</b> Findings regarding the risks for the likelihood (Chapter Two), severity (Chapter Three), stability (Chapter Four) and specificity (Chapter Five) of violent offending were remarkably consistent across the Chapters. Childhood psychopathology, higher scores on aggressive and impulsive trait measures, and childhood maltreatment were found to be strongly, positively correlated with the initial liability to violent offending. Substance use, on the other hand, appeared to play a greater role in the maintenance of violent behaviour. The findings further indicated that heterogeneity in violent patterns was best explained by the extent of cumulative exposure to early-life and substance use risks, such that IDU with greater early-life risk exposure engaged in more stable, serious violent behaviour. The antisocial markers noted among violent IDU were absent in a matched Control group, supporting a hypothesis of risk specificity for violence. This thesis provides new information to a growing literature regarding the substance use-violent offending association, and has implications for the early identification and intervention in individuals at high risk for an adverse developmental cours...|$|R
60|$|It {{is not in}} {{the matter}} of {{education}} only, that misplaced notions of liberty prevent moral obligations on the part of parents from being recognised, and legal obligations from being imposed, where there are the strongest grounds for the former always, and in many cases for the latter also. The fact itself, of causing the existence of a human being, {{is one of the most}} responsible actions in the range of human life. To undertake this responsibility--to bestow a life which may be either a curse or a blessing--unless the being on whom it is to be bestowed will have at least the ordinary chances of a desirable existence, is a crime against that being. And in a country either over-peopled, or threatened with being so, to produce children, beyond a very small number, with the effect of reducing the reward of labour by their competition, is a serious offence against all who live by the remuneration of their labour. The laws which, in many countries on the Continent, forbid marriage unless the parties can show that they have the means of supporting a family, do not exceed the legitimate powers of the state: and whether such laws be expedient or not (a question mainly dependent on local circumstances and feelings), they are not objectionable as violations of liberty. Such laws are interferences of the state to prohibit a mischievous act--an <b>act</b> <b>injurious</b> to others, which ought to be a subject of reprobation, and social stigma, even when it is not deemed expedient to superadd legal punishment. Yet the current ideas of liberty, which bend so easily to real infringements of the freedom of the individual, in things which concern only himself, would repel the attempt to put any restraint upon his inclinations when the consequence of their indulgence is a life, or lives, of wretchedness and depravity to the offspring, with manifold evils to those sufficiently within reach to be in any way affected by their actions. When we compare the strange respect of mankind for liberty, with their strange want of respect for it, we might imagine that a man had an indispensable right to do harm to others, and no right at all to please himself without giving pain to any one.|$|R
60|$|What I {{contend for}} is, that the inconveniences which are {{strictly}} {{inseparable from the}} unfavourable judgment of others, {{are the only ones}} to which a person should ever be subjected for that portion of his conduct and character which concerns his own good, but which does not affect the interests of others in their relations with him. <b>Acts</b> <b>injurious</b> to others require a totally different treatment. Encroachment on their rights; infliction on them of any loss or damage not justified by his own rights; falsehood or duplicity in dealing with them; unfair or ungenerous use of advantages over them; even selfish abstinence from defending them against injury--these are fit objects of moral reprobation, and, in grave cases, of moral retribution and punishment. And not only these acts, but the dispositions which lead to them, are properly immoral, and fit subjects of disapprobation which may rise to abhorrence. Cruelty of disposition; malice and ill-nature; that most anti-social and odious of all passions, envy; dissimulation and insincerity; irascibility on insufficient cause, and resentment disproportioned to the provocation; the love of domineering over others; the desire to engross more than one's share of advantages (the [Greek: pleonexia] of the Greeks); the pride which derives gratification from the abasement of others; the egotism which thinks self and its concerns more important than everything else, and decides all doubtful questions in its own favour;--these are moral vices, and constitute a bad and odious moral character: unlike the self-regarding faults previously mentioned, which are not properly immoralities, and to whatever pitch they may be carried, do not constitute wickedness. They may be proofs of any amount of folly, or want of personal dignity and self-respect; but they are only a subject of moral reprobation when they involve a breach of duty to others, for whose sake the individual is bound to have care for himself. What are called duties to ourselves are not socially obligatory, unless circumstances render them at the same time duties to others. The term duty to oneself, when it means anything more than prudence, means self-respect or self-development; and for none of these is any one accountable to his fellow-creatures, because for none of them is it for the good of mankind that he be held accountable to them.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} two {{attempts}} to control hate speech against the lesbian, gay and bisexual communities in New Zealand. It argues that freedom of speech is not absolute and there are methods to control it {{for the good of}} society. The thesis examined the primary documents, regarding Living Word, tracing the history of that attempt to control the hatred generated by these videos. It examines what happened during that period and how discourse developed, and provides recommendations for future consideration. I argue the videos in question form part of the continuum of discourse surrounding sexual orientation, and inform, and are informed by, the discourse surrounding homosexuality in wider society. Seen as being {{at one end of the}} spectrum of that discourse, they encourage discrimination and hatred against members of the non-heterosexual communities, and may therefore be regarded as hate speech. There is little in New Zealand that addresses hate speech against these communities. There have been two {{attempts to control}} this type of hate speech. The first was regarding Paul Cameron's Exposing the AIDS Scandal (1988) before the Indecent Publications Tribunal, seeking to have the publication ruled indecent as it held gay men and people living with AIDS as inherently inferior to other people, and it demeaned and degraded them. This attempt failed as the Tribunal held that the invective was not concentrated enough to be classed as hate speech. It did, however, provide a definition of hate speech that can be developed in New Zealand law. The second was the case known as the Living Word case, after the appellant. This complaint to the Office of Film and Literature Classification was laid by the Human Rights Action Group (Wellington) against AIDS: What you haven't been told (1989) and Gay Rights/Special Rights: Inside the homosexual agenda (1993). The videos represent lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and transgender people, and people living with HIV/AIDS, as inferior to other people by reason of their sexuality or HIV status, and degrades, demeans and dehumanises them. Therefore, a classification of objectionable was sought. The Office held the videos to be hateful, but felt that those communities were strong enough to withstand the assault these videos made. On appeal to the Film and Literature Board of Review, the Board concluded the video did treat members of those communities as lesser people, and did degrade, demean and dehumanise them and classified the videos as objectionable. The New Zealand distributors of the videos, Living Word Distributors, appealed to the High Court, which dismissed the appeal. Living Word then appealed to the Court of Appeal, seeking to narrow the gateway of material that could be censored and on the grounds the classification interfered with their freedom of speech. The Court of Appeal overturned the earlier decisions, narrowed the gateway of material that could be censored, and remitted the videos back to the Film and Literature Board of Review. The study concluded that hate speech is, in terms of the Films, Videos and Publications Classification <b>Act,</b> <b>injurious</b> to the public good, and ought to be able to be classified...|$|R
