25|$|This was Russia's {{first time}} hosting the Winter Olympic Games, and its first time hosting the Paralympic Games. The {{site of a}} {{training}} centre for aspiring Olympic athletes, in 2008, the city had no world-class level athletic facilities fit for international competition. To get the city ready for the Olympics, the Russian government committed a $12 billion <b>investment</b> <b>package,</b> shared 60%–40% {{between the government and}} private sector. According to some estimates, the investments necessary to bring the location up to Olympic standards may have exceeded that of any previous Olympic games. By January 2014 the construction costs had been reported to exceed the $50 billion mark, making it the most expensive Olympic Games in history. According to a report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, this cost will not boost Russia's national economy, but may attract business to Sochi and the southern Krasnodar region of Russia in the future as a result of improved services.|$|E

50|$|Unbalanced {{growth is}} a natural path of {{economic}} development. Situations that countries are in at any {{one point in time}} reflect their previous investment decisions and development.

Unbalanced investment can complement or correct existing imbalances. Once such an investment is made, a new imbalance is likely to appear, requiring further compensating investments. Therefore, growth need not take place in a balanced way. Supporters of the unbalanced growth doctrine include Albert O. Hirschman, Hans Singer, Paul Streeten and Marcus Fleming.|$|R

Increasing health expenditure by just $ 5 per person per year up to 2035 in 74 high-burden countries could yield up to nine times that value in economic and social benefits. These returns include greater gross domestic product (GDP) growth through improved productivity, and prevention of the needless deaths of 147 million children, 32 million stillbirths, and 5 million women by 2035.

40|$|When {{implemented}} {{within a}} favourable legislative framework, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) can produce domestic growth-enhancing spillovers in host countries. Other potential positive effects include {{the provision of}} investment capital, the creation of local employment and the transfer of sophisticated technology or advanced knowledge. African nations in particular have been historically reliant on externally-provided funds. Prevailing low income levels, marginal savings rates {{and the absence of}} functioning financial markets necessary to provide local start-up capital continue to keep Africa reliant on foreign inflows. Considering China’s increasing financial commitments to Sub- Saharan Africa (SSA) over the last decade, this study examines the state of current Sino-African investment relationships. Specific attention is paid to the outcomes of this strategic bilateral alliance in order {{to determine whether or not}} a mutually beneficial investment relationship has evolved. The distinct nature and structure of, the motivation behind and the most significant determinants of Chinese FDI to SSA are all analysed in accordance with traditional FDI theories. A case study approach is used to establish whether China’s contemporary interest in SSA differs from historical investments and to also investigate country-specific commonalities and differences. Of particular relevance to SSA are resource-backed Chinese loans that finance major infrastructure projects in host nations. Interestingly, a lot of the Sino-African <b>investment</b> <b>packages</b> resemble similar deals struck between China and Japan in the 1970 s. The results of this study indicate that China’s investment motives seem more diverse than initially expected. Resource-seeking, profit-seeking and market access-seeking reasons appear to be the most important motives. After establishing the Top- Ten recipients of Chinese FDI in SSA, these nations are then classified into three major categories: resource-, oil- or agricultural-rich nations. Undiversified resource- or oil-rich economies are found to have secured the largest shares of Chinese FDI. This study suggests that China’s contemporary “African Safari” is an unconventional way of providing financial assistance. Rather than solely supplying FDI, China finances a diverse mix of instruments, the most important being concessional loans, export credits, zero-interest loans and the establishment of Special Economic Zones. A profound difference to traditional Western <b>investment</b> <b>packages</b> is China’s non-interference approach. Accordingly, Beijing not only refrains from intervening in host countries’ domestic affairs but also refuses to attach formal conditionalties to its loans. China’s “financial safari” into Africa has produced many positive as well as negative effects in host countries. Nevertheless, it would seem that the positive effects outweigh the negative and China’s FDI could contribute to sustainable development in SS...|$|R

40|$|The {{economy of}} Tanzania, {{like those of}} many other sub-Saharan African countries, {{displays}} strong geographic and locational disparities. We develop a three-location spatial applied general equilibrium model calibrated to the 2001 Tanzanian Social Accounting Matrix to {{examine the impact of}} various public investment programs on household welfare across this diverse geography in which production and consumption are locationally specific and transport costs support equilibrium price differences across locations. We examine how different public <b>investment</b> <b>packages</b> combined with reforms in the transport sector alter the equilibrium structure and location of economic activity. The choice of financing arrangement matters for welfare, since tax incidence, relative price, and real exchange rate movements are non-neutral. We show that the distributional consequences of alternative investment programs may matter more in terms of household welfare than the direct consequences of targeting investment to particular sectors or locations. For instance, under some financing scenarios, interventions that aid agriculture may lead to decreases in the welfare of the rural unskilled labor force, because the financing mechanisms create distortions that effectively skew the terms of trade sufficiently powerfully against the rural unskilled as to outweigh the direct welfare-enhancing effects of the public investment. We also note that welfare gains are generated by the movement of rural workers out of quasi-subsistence agriculture into higher productivity jobs in other sectors and locations...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{examines}} {{the costs and}} regulations concerning highways and motorways in the Scandinavian countries, both in an historical and a future perspective. Technical and financial information on the highway network is briefly presented. The Scandinavian countries have a quite similar regulatory regime. The national road authorities are responsible for planning of road investments and operations. The Parliaments {{are responsible for the}} final decisions on investments in the highway network. The construction and maintenance activities are done mainly on contract by private enterprises. Denmark has a couple of mega toll projects, like the Great Belt and the Öresund Bridge which have given opportunities for exciting regional development, but where there also is some concern with respect to risk and economic robustness. Norway has the largest number of toll financed projects. They count for around 25 % of the road investments. None of them is in the mega class as single projects, but the toll financed <b>investment</b> <b>packages</b> in Oslo, and other larger cities are of quite substantial magnitude. Sweden has not used toll financing much. The only projects are the Svinesund Brigde (under construction) and the Öresund Bridge where the first is in collaboration with Norway and the latter in collaboration with Denmark. The toll fees are regulated by the authorities, to maintain public control over potential monopoly power in most of the toll projects. Public Private Partnerships (PPP) is not much used in any of the countries, but there are trial projects under way in Norway and considerable interest for this financing regime in Denmark. Sweden appears to be more reluctant towards the PPP arrangement...|$|R
