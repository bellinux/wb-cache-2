25|$|In Portugal, a {{traditional}} soup made {{of rice and}} chicken meat is named canja or Canja de galinha. The Portuguese likely picked up the dish from their colony in Goa, India; where the soup remains a staple (particularly for the ill). The rice is not cooked {{for as long as}} in Asian congee, so it is very soft, but not disintegrated. Traditionally, a boiling fowl containing small, immature eggs is used; the eggs are carefully boiled and served in the canja. This soup is sometimes served with a <b>fresh</b> <b>mint</b> leaf on top. Strongly valued as comfort food, it is traditionally given to people recovering from disease, as in Asia, and in some regions of Portugal, there is even an ancient custom of feeding the mother a strict diet of canja in the first weeks after childbirth. It is also eaten traditionally in Brazil and Cape Verde, former Portuguese colonies.|$|E

5000|$|In the {{introduction}} to his interview with Green in the Paris Review Terry Southern wrote: [...] "An ancient trade compliment, to an author whose technique is highly developed, has been to call him a 'writer's writer'; Henry Green {{has been referred to}} as a 'writer's writer's writer.'" [...] Green was always more popular among fellow authors than with the general public; none of his books sold more than 10,000 copies, although he was more widely read in the 1940s, when Loving appeared briefly on U.S. bestseller lists. He was admired in his lifetime by W. H. Auden, Christopher Isherwood, Eudora Welty, Anthony Burgess, and Rebecca West. The latter said of him, [...] "He was a truly original writer, his prose was <b>fresh</b> <b>minted,</b> he drove his bloodless scalpel inches deeper into the brain and heart, none of it had been said before. He is nearly forgotten." [...] V. S. Pritchett called Green [...] "the most gifted prose writer of his generation". Following the publication of Life in 1952 W.H.Auden commented that Henry Green was [...] "the best English novelist alive".|$|R
