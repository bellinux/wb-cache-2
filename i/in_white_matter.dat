40|$|Objective　To {{calculate}} the radios of peak area of proton {{magnetic resonance spectroscopy}} metabolites <b>in</b> brain <b>white</b> <b>matter</b> of normal infants and young children, to observe the features of metabolite spectra, and to explore the relations between their ratio with age. Methods　The peak areas of metabolites, including N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), and their ratio of NAA/Cho, NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr, <b>in</b> paraventricular <b>white</b> <b>matter</b> of 180 normal infants and young children with different ages as evaluated by multi-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Results　<b>In</b> paraventricular <b>white</b> <b>matter,</b> spectrum of NAA increased, and that of Cho decreased gradually, while {{both of them were}} stabilized at 2 years old. Cr was increased obviously within 3 months, and stabilized after 4 months. Significant differences were found in ratio of different metabolites <b>in</b> paraventricular <b>white</b> <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> different ages (P< 0. 05). The ratios of NAA/Cho and NAA/Cr <b>in</b> paraventricular <b>white</b> mater were positively correlated with age (r= 0. 741, r= 0. 625), while that of Cho/Cr was negatively correlated with age (r=– 0. 552, P< 0. 05).

2500|$|Astrocytes are a {{sub-type of}} glial {{cells in the}} central nervous system. They are also known as astrocytic glial cells. Star-shaped, their many {{processes}} envelop synapses made by neurons. [...] Astrocytes are classically identified using histological analysis; many of these cells express the intermediate filament glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Several forms of astrocytes exist in {{the central nervous system}} including fibrous (<b>in</b> <b>white</b> <b>matter),</b> protoplasmic (in grey matter), and radial. The fibrous glia are usually located within white matter, have relatively few organelles, and exhibit long unbranched cellular processes. This type often has [...] "vascular feet" [...] that physically connect the cells to the outside of capillary walls when they are in proximity to them. The [...] protoplasmic glia are the most prevalent and are found in grey matter tissue, possess a larger quantity of organelles, and exhibit short and highly branched tertiary processes. The radial glia are disposed in planes perpendicular to the axes of ventricles. [...] One of their processes abuts the pia mater, while the other is deeply buried in gray matter. [...] Radial glia are mostly present during development, playing a role in neuron migration. Müller cells of the retina and Bergmann glia cells of the cerebellar cortex represent an exception, being present still during adulthood. When in proximity to the pia mater, all three forms of astrocytes send out processes to form the pia-glial membrane.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the degree of <b>white</b> <b>matter</b> pathology <b>in</b> the cerebral cortex in cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) and to study the relationships between the <b>white</b> <b>matter</b> and grey matter pathologies. Hence, the pathological changes <b>in</b> cortical <b>white</b> <b>matter</b> were studied <b>in</b> individual gyri of the frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal cortex in eleven cases of vCJD. Vacuolation (‘spongiform change’), deposition of the disease form of prion protein (PrPsc) in the form of discrete PrP deposits, and gliosis were observed <b>in</b> the <b>white</b> <b>matter</b> of virtually all cortical regions studied.

In addition, the densities of glial cells and PrP deposits were positively correlated in the frontal and parietal cortex. <b>In</b> the <b>white</b> <b>matter</b> of the frontal cortex and inferior temporal gyrus, there was a negative correlation between the densities of the vacuoles and the number of surviving neurons in laminae V/VI of the adjacent grey matter.

40|$|Background: Positron {{emission}} tomography (PET) images with amyloid tracers show normal uptake <b>in</b> healthy <b>white</b> <b>matter,</b> {{which suggests that}} amyloid tracers are potentially useful for studying such <b>white</b> <b>matter</b> diseases as multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: Twelve patients diagnosed with MS (5 with RRMS, 5 with SPMS, and 2 with PPMS) and 3 healthy controls underwent studies with MRI and 18 F-florbetaben-PET imaging. Images were preprocessed using Statistical Parametric Mapping software. We analysed 18 F-florbetaben uptake in demyelinating plaques (appearing as hyperintense lesions in FLAIR sequences), <b>in</b> normal-appearing <b>white</b> <b>matter,</b> and <b>in</b> grey matter. Results: Mean standardized uptake value relative to cerebellum was higher <b>in</b> normally appearing <b>white</b> <b>matter</b> (NAWM) (1. 51 ± 0. 12) than <b>in</b> damaged <b>white</b> <b>matter</b> (DWM) (1. 24 ± 0. 12; P =. 002). Mean percentage of change between NAWM and DWM was − 17. 56 % ± 6. 22 %. This percentage of change correlated negatively with EDSS scores (r = − 0. 61, p <. 05) and with age (r = − 0. 83, p < 0. 01). Progressive forms of MS showed a more pronounced reduction of the uptake in DWM in comparison to relapsing-remitting form. Conclusions: Uptake of 18 F-florbetaben <b>in</b> damaged <b>white</b> <b>matter</b> is lower than that occurring <b>in</b> normally-appearing <b>white</b> <b>matter.</b> These findings indicate that amyloid tracers {{may be useful in}} studies of MS, although {{further research is needed to}} evaluate the utility of amyloid-PET in monitoring MS progression...|$|R

40|$|Cigarette smoking doubles {{the risk}} of {{dementia}} and Alzheimer's disease. Various pathophysiological pathways have been proposed to cause such a cognitive decline, but the exact mechanisms remain unclear. Smoking may affect the microstructural integrity of cerebral <b>white</b> <b>matter.</b> Diffusion tensor imaging {{is known to be}} sensitive for microstructural changes <b>in</b> cerebral <b>white</b> <b>matter.</b> We therefore cross-sectionally studied the relation between smoking behaviour (never, former, current) and diffusion tensor imaging parameters <b>in</b> both normal-appearing <b>white</b> <b>matter</b> and <b>white</b> <b>matter</b> lesions as well as the relation between smoking behaviour and cognitive performance. A structured questionnaire was used to ascertain the amount and duration of smoking in 503 subjects with small-vessel disease, aged between 50 and 85 years.

Using diffusion tensor imaging, fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity were calculated <b>in</b> both normal-appearing <b>white</b> <b>matter</b> and <b>white</b> <b>matter</b> lesions. A history of smoking was associated with significant higher values of mean diffusivity <b>in</b> normal-appearing <b>white</b> <b>matter</b> and <b>white</b> <b>matter</b> lesions (P-trend for smoking status = 0. 02) and with poorer cognitive functioning compared with those who never smoked. Associations with smoking and loss of structural integrity appeared to be strongest <b>in</b> normal-appearing <b>white</b> <b>matter.</b> Furthermore, the duration of smoking cessation was positively related to lower values of mean diffusivity and higher values of fractional anisotropy <b>in</b> normal-appearing <b>white</b> <b>matter</b> [beta = - 0. 004 (95 % confidence interval - 0. 007 to 0. 000; P = 0. 03) and beta = 0. 019 (95 % confidence interval 0. 001 - 0. 038; P = 0. 04) ].
