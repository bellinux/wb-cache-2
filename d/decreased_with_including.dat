40|$|We present {{explicit}} {{evaluation of}} K-shell ionization caused by photoelectric absorption, by Compton scattering, and by electron collisions in supernovae envelopes. Each process {{derives from the}} radioactivity that dominates the bolometric luminosity of the model supernovae. We include the ionization by bremsstrahlung. We find that electron-collision ionization with decelerating Compton electrons is the dominant process of K-shell ionization for light elements (lighter than Si) whereas photoelectric K-shell absorption of Comptonized gammas is the dominant process of K-shell ionization for heavy elements (like Fe). The relative importance of the ionization processes also depends upon composition and upon time, as well as upon supernova type. For Type Ia all four ionization sources are of importance. We present fitting formulas for the deposition of radioactive power in each class of models studied. The energy deposition of all mechanisms <b>decreases</b> <b>with</b> time, <b>including</b> the rate of K-shell ionizations of all elements throughout the supernovae model evaluated herein. We compare the relative contributions to the energy deposition and confirm with greater numerical detail results already established...|$|R

The relationship with temperature is similar to that derived from a simple model in which an air mass is progressively cooled under Rayleigh conditions as it moves toward the inland plateau.

40|$|The Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) {{combines}} deep HST and Spitzer imaging {{with the}} deepest Chandra/XMM observations to probe obscured AGN at higher redshifts than previous multiwavelength surveys. We present a self-consistent {{implementation of the}} AGN unification paradigm, which postulates obscured AGN wherever there are unobscured AGN, to successfully explain the infrared, optical, and X-ray number counts of X-ray sources detected in the GOODS fields. Assuming either a constant ratio of obscured to unobscured AGN of 3 : 1 (the local value), or a ratio that <b>decreases</b> <b>with</b> luminosity, and <b>including</b> Compton-thick sources, we can explain the spectral shape and normalization of the extragalactic X-ray "background" as a superposition of unresolved AGN, predominantly at z~ 0. 5 - 1. 5 and L_x~ 10 ^ 43 - 10 ^ 44 ergs/s.

40|$|Water Survey {{conducted}} {{this study}} to � 1 � assess the potential of artificial neural networks �ANNs � in forecasting weekly nitrate-nitrogen �nitrate-N � concentration; and � 2 � evaluate the uncertainty associated with those forecasts. Three ANN models were applied to predict weekly nitrate-N concentrations in the Sangamon River near Decatur, Illinois, based on past weekly precipitation, air temperature, discharge, and past nitrate-N concentrations. Those ANN models were more accurate than the linear regression models having the same inputs and output. Uncertainty of the ANN models was further expressed through the entropy principle, as defined in the information theory. Using several inputs in an ANN-based forecasting model reduced the uncertainty expressed through the marginal entropy of weekly nitrate-N concentrations. The uncertainty of predictions was expressed as conditional entropy of future nitrate concentrations for given past precipitation, temperature, discharge, and nitrate-N concentration. In general, the uncertainty of predictions <b>decreased</b> <b>with</b> model complexity. <b>Including</b> additional input variables produced more accurate predictions. However, using the previous weekly data �week t� 1 � did not reduce the uncertainty in the predictions of future nitrate concentrations �week t� 1 � based on current weekly data �week t�...|$|R

With this in mind, I set out to measure self-reported knowledge/awareness and performance of appropriate foot self-care among diabetic patients attending Dr. Yusuf Dadoo Hospital-a level one urban hospital. My premise which was borne by my result was that foot self-care and awareness thereof was poor among sampled diabetic patients. This {{can be attributed to}} both scant education and infrequent foot examination by clinicians and poor adherence to appropriate foot care by majority of the patients surveyed. Objectives: To determine the awareness and performance of appropriate foot self-care practices among diabetic patients attending the out-patient unit of Dr. Yusuf Dadoo Hospital. Study design and methods: This was a descriptive cross sectional study. Participants were consecutively recruited until the sample size of 120 was reached. A questionnaire was used to collect data. Data was analysed using STATA version 10. 0. Main outcome measures: foot self-care practices, the level of awareness of foot self-care and foot abnormalities found in diabetics Results: There were more females (60...|$|R
