40|$|Warped discs {{have been}} found on (sub-) parsec scale in some nearby Seyfert nuclei, {{identified}} by their maser emission. Using dust radiative transfer simulations we explore their observational signatures in the infrared {{in order to find}} out whether they can partly replace the molecular torus. Strong variations of the brightness distributions are found, depending on the orientation of the warp with respect to the line of sight. Whereas images at short wavelengths typically show a disc-like and a point source component, the warp itself only becomes visible at far-infrared wavelengths. A similar variety is visible in the shapes of the spectral energy distributions. Especially for close to edge-on views, the models show silicate feature strengths ranging from deep absorption to strong emission for variations of the lines of sight towards the warp. To test the applicability of our model, we use the case of the Circinus galaxy, where infrared interferometry has revealed a highly elongated emission component matching a warped maser disc in orientation and size. Our model is for the first time able to present a physical explanation for the observed dust morphology as coming from the AGN heated dust. As opposed to available torus models, a warped disc morphology produces a variety of silicate feature shapes for <b>grazing</b> <b>lines</b> of sight, close to an edge-on view. This could be an attractive alternative to a claimed change of the dust composition for the case of the nearby Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068, which harbours a warped maser disc as well.

40|$|Could the dips of "Boyajian's Star" (KIC 8462852) {{have been}} caused by matter in our Solar System? The {{interval}} between periods of deep dips is nearly twice the orbital period of the Kepler satellite. I consider heliocentric obscuring rings in the outer Solar System that <b>graze</b> the <b>line</b> of sight to the star once per orbit of Kepler. The hypothesis predicts that future dips may be observed from Earth during windows separated by a year, although their detailed structure depends on the distribution of particles along the ring.

40|$|Although being {{possibly}} widespread on {{the mainland}} of Australia, where it is recognised {{as part of the}} Stackhousia monogyna Labill. complex, S. gunnii Hook. f. is an endangered species in Tasmania, with only 10 known extant populations, all in the drier parts of the southern Midlands. These populations occur largely on roadsides or lightly grazed paddocks in vegetation that was originally either Themeda triandra grassland or Eucalyptus pauciflora woodland. An ordination of floristic data from sites with and without S. gunnii showed that the species occupies a floristically distinct environment. The floristic differences between stands of S. gunnii relate partly to {{the presence or absence of}} tree cover and substantially to precipitation. The groups of species that preferentially occur with S. gunnii are geophytes, non-geophytic herbs and exotic plants, while those that are concentrated elsewhere include shrubs, grasses and non-geophytic graminoids. Permanent transects were monitored over a 4 -year period at seven sites with varying grazing, firing and disturbance. The number of shoots varied markedly between years in all sites, but not synchronously, even when transects were in close proximity. Although shoot numbers increased after fires occurred on several ungrazed transect lines, they decreased on one <b>grazed</b> <b>line.</b> Deep mechanical disturbance of one site resulted in a dramatic decrease in shoot numbers in the following year. However, they increased steadily over the following 2 years. Shoot emergence occurred at twice the expected rate on bare ground in all years and at all sites, and a substantial proportion of shoots was confined to this type of surface. However, shoots were also recorded in fewer numbers in grass cover, herb cover and non-vascular plant crusts. Like some other threatened plants of grassy ecosystems, S. gunnii seems to be rare because it cannot survive with heavy grazing disturbance, ploughing and fertilisation, and, at the other extreme, because it is susceptible to elimination in the absence of environmental conditions and disturbances that create bare ground...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} vegetation changes superimposed by grazing and their effect on small mammals in the Karoo (South Africa) on grazed farmland and an adjacent, 10 -year livestock enclosure. Plains and drainage line habitats were compared by monitoring vegetation height and cover, and small mammal species composition and abundance along transects. Animals were captured by live trapping. Vegetation cover was low on the grazed compared to the ungrazed study site, but vegetation height did not differ. The number of small mammal individuals {{and the number of}} species captured was higher at the ungrazed study site. Two species of climbing rodents captured in the ungrazed drainage line were absent from the <b>grazed</b> drainage <b>line.</b> Numbers of small mammals captured on the plains were similar for grazed and ungrazed land, but grazed plains were dominated by a single species of gerbil.

We propose a new direct method of surface reconstruction which is based on 3 D regularized uniform bicubic B-spline surface patches. This reconstruction is achieved by observing the motion of occluding contours where the view <b>lines</b> <b>graze</b> the surface. It is shown that such a reconstruction of 3 D surface is possible when the motion of the camera is known, with the exception of those fully concave parts where no view line can be tangential to the surface. Once a set of overlapping B-spline surface patches which constitute the 3 D surface of an object are recontructed, our developed method can fuse them efficiently to obtain a global surface. This is based on 3 D triangular mesh and regularized uniform bicubic B-spline surface interpolation. This method differs from some of the previous works: First, it {{considers the}} problem of regularization on the 3 D surface instead of smoothing the contours in the 2 D image. Second, we propose a global surface recovery from small local patches. Previous authors have been content only with the recovery of some local properties of the surface such as 3 D shape position and surface curvature estimation.
