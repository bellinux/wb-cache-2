5000|$|Dark current {{contributes}} {{two kinds}} of noise: dark offset, which is only partly correlated between pixels, and the shot noise associated with dark offset, which is uncorrelated between pixels. Only the shot-noise component Dt {{is included in the}} formula above, since the uncorrelated part of the dark offset is hard to predict, and the correlated or mean part is relatively easy to subtract off. The mean dark current contains contributions proportional both to the area and the linear dimension of the photodiode, with the relative proportions and scale factors depending on the design of the photodiode. Thus in general the <b>dark</b> <b>noise</b> of a sensor may be expected to rise as the size of the sensor increases. However, in most sensors the mean pixel dark current at normal temperatures is small, lower than 50 e- per second, thus for typical photographic exposure times dark current and its associated noises may be discounted. At very long exposure times, however, it may be a limiting factor. And even at short or medium exposure times, a few outliers in the dark-current distribution may show up as [...] "hot pixels".|$|E

Young's Theatre of Eternal Music was a minimal music noise group in the mid-60s with John Cale, Marian Zazeela, Henry Flynt, Angus Maclise, Tony Conrad, and others. The Theatre of Eternal Music's discordant sustained notes and loud amplification had influenced Cale's subsequent contribution to The Velvet Underground in his use of both discordance and feedback. Cale and Conrad have released noise music recordings they made during the mid-sixties, such as Cale's Inside the Dream Syndicate series (The Dream Syndicate being the alternative name given by Cale and Conrad to their collective work with Young).The aptly named noise rock fuses rock to noise, usually with recognizable [...] "rock" [...] instrumentation, but with greater use of distortion and electronic effects, varying degrees of atonality, improvisation, and white noise.

50|$|The 50 ktons {{pure water}} is {{continually}} reprocessed at rate about 30 tons/h {{in a close}} system since early 2002. Now, raw mine water is recycled through the first step (particle filters and RO) for some time before other processes, which involve expensive expendables, are imposed. Initially, water from the Super-Kamiokande tank is passed through nominal 1 μm mesh filters to remove dust and particles, which reduce the transparency of the water for Cherenkov photons, and provide a possible radon source inside the Super-Kamiokande detector. Heat exchanger is used to cool down the water {{in order to reduce}} the PMT <b>dark</b> <b>noise</b> level as well as suppress the growth of bacteria. Surviving bacteria are killed by UV sterilizer stage. A cartridge polisher (CP) eliminates heavy ions which also reduce water transparency and include radioactive species. The CP module increases the typical resistivity of recirculating water from 11MΩ cm to 18.24 MΩ cm, approaching chemical limit. Originally, ion-exchanger (IE) was included in system, but it was removed when IE resin was found to be a significant radon source. The RO step that removes additional particulates, and the introduction of Rn-reduced air into the water that increases radon removal efficiency in the vacuum degasifier (VD) stage which follows were installed in 1999. After that, a VD removes dissolved gases in the water. These gases are dissolved in water with a serious background of events source for solar neutrinos in the MeV energy range and the dissolved oxygen encourages the growth of bacteria. The removing efficiency of removing is about 96%. Then, the ultra filter (UF) is introduced to remove particles whose minimum size corresponds to molecular weight approximately 10,000 (or about 10 nm diameter) thanks to hollow fiber membrane filters. Finally, a membrane degasifier (MD) removes radon dissolved in water, and the measured removal efficiency for radon is about 83%. The concentration of radon gases is miniaturized by realtime detectors. In June, 2001 typical radon concentrations in water coming into the purification system from the Super-Kamiokande tank were <2 mBq m−3, and in water output by the system, 0.4±0.2 mBq m−3.|$|E
40|$|For {{several decades}} the {{physical}} mechanism underlying discrete <b>dark</b> <b>noise</b> of photoreceptors {{in the eye}} has remained highly controversial and poorly understood. It is known that the Arrhenius equation, {{which is based on}} the Boltzmann distribution for thermal activation, can model only a part (e. g. half of the activation energy) of the retinal <b>dark</b> <b>noise</b> experimentally observed for vertebrate rod and cone pigments. Using the Hinshelwood distribution instead of the Boltzmann distribution in the Arrhenius equation has been proposed as a solution to the problem. Here, we show that the using the Hinshelwood distribution does not solve the problem completely. As the discrete components of noise are indistinguishable in shape and duration from those produced by real photon induced photo-isomerization, the retinal discrete <b>dark</b> <b>noise</b> is most likely due to 'internal photons' inside cells and not due to thermal activation of visual pigments. Indeed, all living cells exhibit spontaneous ultraweak photon emission (UPE), mainly in the optical wavelength range, i. e., 350 - 700 nm. We show here that the retinal discrete <b>dark</b> <b>noise</b> has a similar rate as UPE and therefore <b>dark</b> <b>noise</b> is most likely due to spontaneous cellular UPE and not due to thermal activation...|$|E

40|$|<b>Noise</b> due to <b>dark</b> {{current is}} a serious {{limitation}} for taking long exposure time images with a CCD digital camera. Current solutions have serious drawbacks: interpolation of pixels with high dark current leads to smoothing effects or other artifacts – especially if {{a large number of}} pixels are corrupted. Due to the exponential temperature dependence of the dark current, dark frame subtraction works best for temperature controlled high end CCD imaging systems. On the physical level, two independent signals (charge generated by photons hitting the CCD and by the dark current) are added. Due to its random distribution, adding (or subtracting) the <b>dark</b> current <b>noise</b> signal increases the entropy of the resulting image. The entropy is minimal if the dark current signal is not present at all. A dark frame is a good representation of the <b>dark</b> current <b>noise.</b> As the generated dark current depends on the temperature equally for all pixels, a noisy image can be cleaned by the subtraction of a scaled dark frame. The scaling factor can be determined in an optimization step which tries to minimize the entropy of the cleaned image. We implemented a software system that effectively removes <b>dark</b> current <b>noise</b> even from highly corrupted images. The resulting images contain almost no visible artifacts since only the noise signal is removed. This extends the range of usable exposure times of digital cameras without temperature control systems by about one to two orders of magnitude. 1...|$|R
40|$|Wavefront sensors, {{which use}} {{solid-state}} CCD or CMOS photosensors, are {{sources of errors}} in adaptive optic systems. Inaccuracy in the detection of wavefront distortions introduces considerable errors into wavefront reconstruction and leads to overall performance degradation of the adaptive optics system. The accuracy of wavefront sensors is significantly affected by photosensor noise. Thus, {{it is crucial to}} formulate high-level photosensor models that enable adaptive optic engineers to simulate realistic effects of noise from wavefront sensors. However, the complexity of solid-state photosensors and multiple noise sources makes it difficult to formulate an adequate model of the photosensor. Moreover, the characterisation of the simulated sensor and comparison with real hardware is often incomplete due to lack of comprehensive standards and guidelines. Owe to these difficulties, engineers work with oversimplified models of the wavefront sensors and consequently have imprecise numerical simulation results. The paper presents an approach for the modelling of noise sources for CCD and CMOS sensors that are used for wavefront sensing in adaptive optics. Both <b>dark</b> and light <b>noise</b> such as fixed pattern noise, photon shot noise, and read noises, as well as, charge-to-voltage noises are described.
