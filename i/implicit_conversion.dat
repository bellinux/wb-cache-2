25|$|C++ {{is often}} {{considered}} to be a superset of C, but this is not strictly true. Most C code can easily be made to compile correctly in C++, {{but there are a few}} differences that cause some valid C code to be invalid or behave differently in C++. For example, C allows <b>implicit</b> <b>conversion</b> from void* to other pointer types, but C++ does not (for type safety reasons). Also, C++ defines many new keywords, such as new and class, which may be used as identifiers (for example, variable names) in a C program.|$|E
2500|$|The more type {{restrictions}} that are {{imposed by the}} compiler, the more strongly typed a programming language is. [...] Strongly typed languages often require the programmer to make explicit conversions in contexts where an <b>implicit</b> <b>conversion</b> would cause no harm. [...] Pascal's type system {{has been described as}} [...] "too strong" [...] because, for example, the size of an array or string is part of its type, making some programming tasks difficult. Haskell is also strongly typed but its types are automatically inferred so that explicit conversions are often (but not always) unnecessary.|$|E

50|$|Among {{dynamically}} typed languages, Python is moderately type-checked. <b>Implicit</b> <b>conversion</b> {{is defined}} for numeric types (as well as booleans), so one may validly multiply a complex number {{by a long}} integer (for instance) without explicit casting. However, there is no <b>implicit</b> <b>conversion</b> between (e.g.) numbers and strings; a string is an invalid argument to a mathematical function expecting a number.|$|E

5|$|C# is more type safe than C++. The only <b>implicit</b> <b>conversions</b> {{by default}} {{are those that}} are {{considered}} safe, such as widening of integers. This is enforced at compile-time, during JIT, and, in some cases, at runtime. No <b>implicit</b> <b>conversions</b> occur between Booleans and integers, nor between enumeration members and integers (except for literal 0, which can be implicitly converted to any enumerated type). Any user-defined conversion must be explicitly marked as explicit or implicit, unlike C++ copy constructors and conversion operators, which are both implicit by default.|$|R

50|$|The {{notion of}} subtyping in {{programming}} languages {{dates back to}} the 1960s; it was introduced in Simula derivatives. The first formal treatments of subtyping were given by John C.

40|$|Abstract. Gradual typing {{enables a}} mixture of static and dynamic typing within the same program. There are four {{properties}} that are desirable in a gradually-typed language: 1) the type system allows <b>implicit</b> <b>conversions</b> {{to and from the}} dynamic type so that values can easily pass between statically and dynamically-typed regions of code, 2) the overhead associated with <b>implicit</b> <b>conversions</b> is low, 3) if one of these conversions fails, the guilty source location is blamed, and 4) statically-typed regions of code execute just as efficiently as code written in a statically-typed language. This paper presents the first design, monotonic objects, that has all four properties in the presence of mutable state. On the way to this design we develop guarded objects, a natural extension of earlier work that imposes some overhead on statically-typed regions of code. ...|$|R

5000|$|This code can be {{corrected}} {{by using an}} array instead of a character pointer, as this allocates memory on stack and initializes it {{to the value of}} the string literal:char s = [...] "hello world";s0 = 'H'; // equivalently, *s = 'H';Even though string literals cannot be modified (rather, this has undefined behavior in the C standard), in C they are of [...] type, so there is no <b>implicit</b> <b>conversion</b> in the original code, while in C++ they are of [...] type, and thus there is an <b>implicit</b> <b>conversion,</b> so compilers will generally catch this particular error.|$|E

5000|$|C++ {{does not}} allow the <b>implicit</b> <b>conversion</b> of [...] to other pointer types, even in assignments. This was a design {{decision}} to avoid careless and even unintended casts, though most compilers only output warnings, not errors, when encountering other casts.|$|E

5000|$|In C++11, the [...] keyword can now {{be applied}} to {{conversion}} operators. As with constructors, it prevents using those <b>conversion</b> functions in <b>implicit</b> <b>conversions.</b> However, language contexts that specifically need a boolean value (the conditions of if-statements and loops, and operands to the logical operators) count as explicit conversions and can thus use a bool conversion operator.|$|R
5000|$|An {{alternative}} {{definition for}} [...] "weakly typed" [...] refers to languages, such as Perl and JavaScript, which permit {{a large number}} of <b>implicit</b> type <b>conversions.</b> In JavaScript, for example, the expression [...] implicitly converts [...] to a number, and this conversion succeeds even if [...] is , , an , or a string of letters. Such <b>implicit</b> <b>conversions</b> are often useful, but they can mask programming errors.Strong and static are now generally considered orthogonal concepts, but usage in the literature differs. Some use the term strongly typed to mean strongly, statically typed, or, even more confusingly, to mean simply statically typed. Thus C has been called both strongly typed and weakly, statically typed.|$|R

5000|$|In the {{following}} example program, one variable, , is assigned the value , and another variable, [...] is assigned the text string [...] When the operator [...] is run, the left associativity of the operator will lead to an <b>implicit</b> <b>conversion</b> of the right argument to the same type as the left side (type [...] ) before the addition is performed.|$|E
50|$|Each {{programming}} language {{has its own}} rules on how types can be converted. Languages with strong typing typically do little <b>implicit</b> <b>conversion</b> and discourage the reinterpretation of representations, while languages with weak typing perform many implicit conversions between data types. Weak typing language often allow forcing the compiler to arbitrarily interpret a data item as having different representations—this can be a non-obvious programming error, or a technical method to directly deal with underlying hardware.|$|E
50|$|In the C {{family of}} {{languages}} and ALGOL 68, the word cast typically refers to an explicit type conversion (as opposed to an <b>implicit</b> <b>conversion),</b> causing some ambiguity about {{whether this is a}} re-interpretation of a bit-pattern or a real data representation conversion. More important is the multitude of ways and rules that apply to what data type (or class) is located by a pointer and how a pointer may be adjusted by the compiler in cases like object (class) inheritance.|$|E
