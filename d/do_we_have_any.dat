The study at hand is concerned specifically with {{the problem in the}} College of Home Economics. Through a study of the data known about students at the time of entrance into the College, it was thought that a better basis for selection night be recommended for the admission of students to the College. Such questions as the following arise {{in the mind of the}} research worker: 1. Do the group psychological tests given at the University at the time of entrance give us one basis by which we may predict probable academic success or failure? 2. Are the known high school quartiles dependable bases for selection of successful students? 3.

Is there some insight to be gained by considering which teams beat which other teams solely examining the seeds? We pose an answer to these questions by using the difference in the seeds of the two players as the basis for a test statistic. We offer several models for the underlying probability structure to examine the null distribution and power functions and determine these for small tournaments (less than five teams). One structure each for 8 teams and 16 teams is examined, and we conjecture an asymptotic normal distribution for the test statistic. ...|$|E

This paper {{is concerned with the}} problematic of critique in critical literacy. Critique plays a crucial role in arousing awareness of, and resistance against, social and political oppression.

This voyage of discovery shows that zero deforestation efforts are an excellent means of addressing the challenges in making cocoa production and trade sustainable. Many other issues need to be addressed before cocoa — or even better, chocolate — is truly sustainable. Efforts to make supply chains “green” must be embedded in a broader discussion about how to ensure sustainability, from commodity production to end products, from farmer to consumer, and not just at some of the points along the way...|$|E

As is common in computer vision or unsupervised learning applications, {{we do not know}} in advance how many subspaces there are nor <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> information about their dimensions. We develop a novel geometric analysis of an algorithm named sparse subspace clustering (SSC) [11], which significantly broadens the range of problems where it is provably effective. For instance, we show that SSC can recover multiple subspaces, each of dimension comparable to the ambient dimension. We also prove that SSC can correctly cluster data points even when the subspaces of interest intersect. Further, we develop an extension of SSC that succeeds when the data set is corrupted with possibly overwhelmingly many outliers. Underlying our analysis are clear geometric insights, which may bear on other sparse recovery problems. A numerical study complements our theoretical analysis and demonstrates the effectiveness of these methods...|$|E

40|$|When running {{software}} applications and services, {{we rely on}} the underlying execution platform: the hardware and {{the lower levels of}} the software stack. The execution platform is susceptible {{to a wide range of}} threats, ranging from accidental bugs, faults, and leaks to maliciously induced Trojan horses. The problem is aggravated by growing system complexity and by increasingly pertinent outsourcing and supply chain consideration. Traditional mechanisms, which painstakingly validate all system components, are expensive and limited in applicability. What if the platform assurance problem is just too hard? <b>Do</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> hope of securely running software when we cannot trust the underlying hardware, hypervisor, kernel, libraries, and compilers? This article will discuss a potential approach for doing just so: conducting trustworthy computation on untrusted execution platforms. The approach, proof-carrying data (PCD), circumnavigates the threat of faults and leakage by reasoning solely about properties of a computation’s output data, regardless of the process that produced it. In PCD, the system designer prescribes the desired properties of the computation’s outputs. These properties are then enforced using cryptographic proofs attached to all data �owing through the system and veri�ed at the system perimeter as well as internal nodes. 40 FEATUR...|$|E
