She moved into Tracy's house for this period, and was {{with him when he}} died on June 10, 1967. Out of consideration for Tracy's family, she did not attend his funeral. It was only after Louise Tracy's death, in 1983, that Hepburn began to speak publicly about her feelings for her frequent co-star. In response to the question of why she stayed with Tracy for so long, despite the nature of their relationship, she said, [...] "I honestly don't know. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>say</b> that I could never have left him." [...] She claimed to not know how he felt about her and that they [...] "just passed twenty-seven years [...] together in what was to me absolute bliss." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dolphy was posthumously {{inducted}} into the Down Beat magazine Hall of Fame in 1964. John Coltrane paid tribute to Dolphy in an interview: [...] "Whatever I'd say would be an understatement. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>say</b> my life was made much better by knowing him. He {{was one of the}} greatest people I've ever known, as a man, a friend, and a musician." [...] Dolphy's mother, Sadie, who had fond memories of her son practicing in the studio in the backyard of their house, gave instruments that Dolphy had bought in France but never played to Coltrane, who subsequently played the flute and bass clarinet on several albums before his own death in 1967.|$|E

Khan, however, was hesitant at first but agreed and worked upon {{the concept of the}} show for two years. In an interview with Zee News, he said, [...] "Initially I was scared to do the show as we were travelling on a different path. I was worried. It was in a way difficult, but we knew what we are doing is different, but it comes straight from our heart." [...] He also added, [...] "I cannot say I understand TV completely.

2500|$|He {{was a great}} character. According to E.W. Swanton, [...] "He {{always had}} a few pet bees buzzing around in his bonnet, and used to inveigh against the {{criminal}} folly of selectors and authority generally if their view did not match his own." [...] When Maurice Leyland was preferred to Frank Woolley in the touring party to Australia in 1928-9, he fulminated against {{the selection of a}} [...] "cross-batted village-greener". When he scored 63* in the 1892 University Match, three of the best Cambridge batsmen were run out during his innings, including no less a figure than F.S. Jackson, his captain. When it appeared that one of them would have to go, Weigall is supposed to have sacrificed his partner by calling: [...] "Get back, Jacker. I'm set." [...] Swanton sums him up thus: [...] "... he may well sound a rather preposterous fellow... <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>say</b> that every cricketer was his friend, and that he never spoke an unkind word about anyone." ...|$|E

5000|$|In other words, {{learning}} is a process by which a person gains specific knowledge, understanding of this knowledge, or a specific skill (ability). Often learning involves gaining all three to varying degrees.

True learning involves internalization of the knowledge being learned.

60|$|A species, for instance--and I {{suspect it}} {{is a common}} case with insects--may abound in a single spot, simply because, long years ago, a single brood of eggs {{happened}} to hatch at a time when eggs of other species, who would have competed against them for food, did not hatch; and they may remain confined to that spot, though there is plenty of food for them outside it, simply because they do not increase fast enough to require to spread out in search of more food. Thus I should explain a case which I heard of lately of Anthocera trifolii, abundant for years in one corner of a certain field, and only there; while there was just as much trefoil all round for its larvae as there was in the selected spot. <b>I</b> <b>can,</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> <b>only</b> give hints: but they will suffice, I hope, to show the path of thought into which I want young naturalists to turn their minds.|$|R

I cannot, [...] merely on account of pecuniary profit or literary [...] reputation, go back from what I have deliberately felt and [...] thought it right to do; and if I were to tear out the [...] dedication I should never look at the volume again without [...] remorse and shame. As for the literary public, it must [...] accept my book precisely as I think fit to give it, or let [...] it alone. Nevertheless I have no fancy for making myself a [...] martyr when it is honourably and conscientiously possible to [...] avoid it; and I always measure out heroism very accurately [...] according to the exigencies of the occasion, and should be [...] the last man in the world to throw away a bit of it [...] needlessly. So I have looked over the concluding paragraph [...] and have amended it in such a way that, while doing what I [...] know to be justice to my friend, it contains not a word that [...] ought to be objectionable to any set of readers.

40|$|Anyone {{familiar}} with current initiatives {{in higher education}} {{is well aware of}} the increasing emphasis on public service as a component of an undergraduate degree, and the rhetoric of contemporary dialogues might well lead one to believe that public service is an entirely new concept in American higher education. This essay offers a different view. Far from being new, public service {{in one form or another}} was a significant element of the college curriculum from the seventeenth century until the Civil War. The reappearance of this notion, I believe, signals a rebirth, but at the same time marks a departure from the trends that developed after 1865. At the same time, the field considered here is somewhat circumscribed. This essay is concerned with American higher education, but not with all of it. There is no mention of community colleges, an omission some may find serious, even inexcusable, in any discussion of the role of service in higher education. Likewise there is scant attention paid to the denominational colleges and universities founded between the 1820 s and 191 Os, which served the needs of an immigrant population and which also had significant service functions. In defense of these exclusions, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>only</b> that they occupy an interesting and important place in American higher education 2 ̆ 7 s past, but they are not central to the argument presented here...|$|R
