40|$|Due to the {{developments}} in catalysis {{and the use}} of improved and dedicated catalysts in modern polymerization processes, the variety of different grades of polyolefins produced (and with that the variety of possible applications) has increased rapidly over the past decades. Combined with the low prices of these polymers, this has lead to a huge growth rate of the annual worldwide production capacity for polyolefins. The more modern processes almost always utilize a number of different polymerization reactors in series, often being a combination of one or two liquid <b>phase</b> <b>reactors</b> and one or two gas <b>phase</b> <b>reactors.</b> At the same time, {{the developments}} ask for improved control on particle morphology.

40|$|We study {{stability}} of a dust {{layer in a}} gaseous disc subject to the linear axisymmetric perturbations. Instead of considering single-size particles, however, the population of dust particles is assumed to consist of two grain species. Dust grains exchange momentum with the gas via the drag force and their self-gravity is also considered. We show {{that the presence of}} two grain sizes can increase the efficiency of the linear growth of drag-driven instability in the protoplanetary discs. A second <b>dust</b> <b>phase</b> with a small mass, comparing to the first <b>dust</b> <b>phase,</b> would reduce the growth timescale even by a factor of two or more especially when its coupling to the gas is weak. It means that once a certain amount of large dust particles form, even though it is much smaller than that of small dust particles, the dust layer becomes more unstable and dust clumping are accelerated. Thus, presence of dust particles with various sizes must be considered in studies of dust clumping in protoplanetary discs where both large and small dust grains are present.

40|$|ABSTRACT: According to the European Community plan POWER III, the {{rehabilitation}} of the power system of Bosnia and Hercegovina (BiH) and its reconnection with Croatian power system should {{be completed by the}} end of 2005. Use of available resources under constraints imposed by actual and prospective states of the power systems of BiH and Croatia (particularly Adriatic lines) leads to operational problems: violation of (n- 1) criteria, high voltages, voltage instability, thermal power plants (TPPs) operating below minimum, etc. Having outstanding capabilities, pumped storage HPP Čapljina (2 x 240 MVA) could contribute to mitigating some of those problems while fully exploiting its advantages on the open electricity market. Two system services should be provided for HPP Čapljina: asynchronous start (with and/or without <b>phase</b> <b>reactors</b> at the generator starpoint) and transmission capacity for pumping.
