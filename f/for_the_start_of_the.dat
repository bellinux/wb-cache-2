5|$|During 2011–14, {{the club}} sold all 36,000 of its {{allocated}} season tickets each season and experienced an average match attendance {{that is very}} close to its maximum seating capacity (see table in previous section). Consequently, during the 2014–15 season, an expansion of the stadium was undertaken. The South Stand was extended {{with the addition of a}} third tier which, in conjunction with an additional three rows of pitch side seating, increased stadium capacity to approximately 55,000. Construction commenced on the South Stand in April 2014 and was completed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2015–16 season.|$|E
5|$|Fast {{also made}} his Swedish Hockey League debut in 2009–10, playing {{in two games}} with HV71, {{although}} he failed to record a point in either match.

5|$|Shirokov made an {{immediate}} impression {{in his first}} training camp with the Canucks, but suffered a minor setback during the pre-season, missing a week with an injured knee. He recovered {{in time for the}} end of the pre-season to lead the team in exhibition scoring with seven points in four games. As a result, Shirokov earned a roster spot <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2009–10 season, beating out fellow Canucks prospects Cody Hodgson and Michael Grabner.|$|E
5|$|The first {{company to}} supply kits for East Stirlingshire was Bukta between 1979 and 1987.

5|$|With early {{injuries}} to Canucks forwards during training camp, Glass made the line-up <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{season as the}} thirteenth forward. He scored his first goal with the Canucks on November 1, 2009, in a 3–0 win against the Colorado Avalanche. He recorded 11 points over 67 games in 2009–10.

5|$|After {{returning}} from South Africa, Harvey embarrassed the Board of Control when he frankly discussed his financial situation during a television interview. He {{revealed that the}} players earned only £85 per Test {{and that he was}} almost broke, despite being an automatic selection for Australia. Ten years of making time for cricket had disrupted his working life, so he was contemplating a move to South Africa, the homeland of his wife, Iris. Consequently, Harvey received a job offer to work as a sales supervisor for a glass manufacturer in Sydney, so he moved to New South Wales and gave up the Victorian captaincy. As a new player to NSW, he was behind vice-captain Richie Benaud in the state's pecking order, despite being the Test vice-captain, ahead of Benaud. Fatefully, Craig was unfit <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1958–59 season, due to the after-effects of hepatitis.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the 1943 season, Wensloff enlisted in the United States Army and served in World War II. When the Yankees were preparing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1944 season, the team originally had no idea where Wensloff was, as they had not heard from him. He was inactive for the 1944 season. In 1945, Wensloff was traded from the Yankees to the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League for Johnny Kreevich, allowing him to simultaneously pitch professionally and continue serving in the war. In 10 games for the Padres, he won three and lost four with a 3.82 ERA. After the 1945 season and the war ended, Wensloff remained in military service, and as a result did not play in 1946.|$|E
5|$|BSR Housewares {{became the}} club's first shirt sponsor during the 1981–82 season. The club's shirts have been {{sponsored}} {{for the majority}} of the time since then, although there was no shirt sponsor at the end of the 1993–94 season, after local solicitors Coucher & Shaw were closed down by the Law Society of England and Wales. Unusually for a Premier League club, Albion were again without a shirt sponsor <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2008–09 campaign, as negotiations with a new sponsor were still ongoing when the season began. The longest-running shirt sponsorship deal agreed by the club ran for seven seasons between 1997 and 2004 with the West Bromwich Building Society. Other sponsors have included T-Mobile (2004–08), Homeserve (2010–11), Bodog (2011–12), Zoopla (2012–14), Intuit Quickbooks (2014–15), TLCBET (2015–16) and K8 group (2016–2017).|$|E
