5|$|Advances {{of funds}} – Advances are federal funds {{provided}} to a recipient {{before the program}} activity is performed. Recipients determine the amount needed for a future expenditure (e.g., through budget process) and request the amount {{to the federal government}} (or in the case of subrecipients to the pass-through entity, see Subrecipient Monitoring below). The federal funds received are then expended to perform the specific activity (e.g., purchase good or service or for payroll). However, laws and regulations require recipients to request funds only when it is immediately needed, and recipients must try to minimize the amount of time between the receipts of funds to the actual disbursement. Examples of programs under these funding techniques are the Section 8 program and the Community Development Block <b>Grant</b> <b>program.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nine {{counties}} in Texas were declared disaster areas after Tropical Storm Fay: Brazoria, Frio, Galveston, La Salle, Live Oak, Matagorda, Nueces, San Patricio and Wharton. The declaration enabled business owners and residents {{to apply for}} federal and state government aid programs. Disaster housing checks handed out after the storm totaled to over $2.7million (2002USD; $3.1million 2007USD) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) had carried out over 2,700home and building inspections. Non-government relief programs such as The Individual and Family <b>Grant</b> <b>Program</b> had distributed over $400,000 (2002USD; $469,000 2007USD) in checks, and over $1million (2002USD; $1.2million 2007USD) in relief funds.

5|$|The Michigan Sea <b>Grant</b> <b>Program</b> {{organized}} a three-day dive {{to survey the}} Fitzgerald in 1989. The primary objective was to record 3-D videotape for use in museum educational programs and production of documentaries. The expedition used a towed survey system (TSS Mk1) and a self-propelled, tethered, free swimming remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV). The Mini Rover ROV was equipped with miniature stereoscopic cameras and wide angle lenses {{in order to produce}} 3-D images. The towed survey system and the Mini Rover ROV were designed, built and operated by Chris Nicholson of Deep Sea Systems International, Inc. Participants included the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Geographic Society, the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society (GLSHS), and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the latter providing RV Grayling as the support vessel for the ROV. The GLSHS used part of the five hours of video footage produced during the dives in a documentary and the National Geographic Society used a segment in a broadcast. Frederick Stonehouse, who wrote one of the first books on the Fitzgerald wreck, moderated a 1990 panel review of the video that drew no conclusions about the cause of Fitzgeralds sinking.|$|E
5|$|The new block <b>grant</b> <b>program</b> {{differed}} {{significantly from the}} former Food Stamp program in three major ways. First, the new NAP program was designed to distribute the benefits through physical cheques, ensuring that the benefit would be payable only to the beneficiary {{while at the same}} time reducing administrative costs, since the former physical vouchers (cupones in Spanish) were subject to storage and accountability problems, theft, counterfeiting and even trafficking. Second, the benefits were no longer restricted to vouchers redeemable only for food, but were provided in cash. The beneficiary could then elect to purchase a product or select services other than food. Third, the overall assistance provided to Puerto Rico was limited to an annual block appropriation, requiring the Puerto Rican government to adjust its program management to allocate the funds. Between 1982 and 1986, the U.S. Congress awarded $825 million annually in block grants for NAP program, and since then the appropriations have steadily increased by an estimated 3% to 4% to compensate for inflation. It has surpassed $1 billion annually since the early 1990s, and increased 30% from 1993 to 2002. Since fiscal year 2006, the appropriation has reached over $1.5 billion annually.|$|E
5|$|While at college, Reed interned for Congressman Joseph Patrick KennedyII. During his {{internship}} {{he learned}} about a federal dollar-for-dollar matching <b>grant</b> <b>program.</b> In his senior year and as the undergraduate trustee on the University's Board of Trustees, he instituted a $15-per-semester student fee increase to be matched by the federal grant, with monies to be earmarked for the university's endowment. The fees were expected to total nearly $300,000 per semester. The estimate was conservative {{in the sense that}} it only assumes the fees from slightly more than 75% of the 12,000 students. The four-year totals would approach a $2.4million addition to the endowment. Reed earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1991. He earned his juris doctorate from Howard University School of Law in 1995. In 2002 Reed was appointed as the youngest General Trustee to serve on Howard's Board of Trustees and continues to serve on that board.|$|E

5|$|During his career, Caldwell {{served on}} the faculties of the University of Chicago, Northwestern University, the University of Oklahoma, Syracuse University, and the University of California at Berkeley, and had shorter {{appointments}} at some 80 other collegiate institutions both within the U.S. and overseas. At various times, Caldwell served as advisor or consultant to the U.S. Senate, UNESCO, the United Nations, the Departments of Commerce, Energy, Defense, and Interior, and the National Institutes of Health. Although not a natural scientist, {{as part of his}} work towards establishing interdisciplinary study in universities and achieving a greater merging of the two worlds of science and public policy, he became deeply involved in national and international environmental affairs and worked closely with several important scientific bodies serving, among many appointments, on the Sea <b>Grant</b> <b>Program</b> of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the first Environmental Advisory Board of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the Pacific Science Congress, the President’s National Commission on Materials Policy, the Science Advisory Board for the Great Lakes of the International Joint Commission, as chair of the first Commission on Environmental Policy, Law and Administration for the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), and as advisor to the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Program (MAB), and the UNESCO working program for the environmental education and training of engineers.|$|E

40|$|Intergovernmental {{grants are}} a major policy tool and do much to define American federalism. As the 21 st century dawned, the {{national}} government operated over 650 <b>grant</b> <b>programs</b> for states and localities. By 2005, these grants totaled over $ 425 billion in federal outlays and, through matching requirements, fueled substantial expenditures by state governments from their own coffers (U. S. Office of Management and Budget 2005). Traditionally, students of federal <b>grant</b> <b>programs</b> have focused on policy changes forged by congress and the courts. At times, however, <b>grant</b> <b>programs</b> undergo major transformation via the implementation process.

40|$|As {{the cost}} of college {{continues}} to increase, state funding for higher education is decreasing. Students now face a growing burden to finance their education. As a result, state funded student <b>grant</b> <b>programs,</b> including need and nonneed based programs, are becoming increasingly important to improving the accessibility of higher education. Using data presented by the National Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs’ Annual Survey Reports on State-Sponsored Student Financial Aid for 2002 - 2003, 2006 - 2007, and 2011 - 2012, this paper seeks to understand what factors best predict the structure and outcomes of state funded <b>grant</b> <b>programs.</b> These factors include state educational attainment levels, income inequality, and a multidimensional measure of state partisanship. While I find some correlation between state funding for student <b>grant</b> <b>programs</b> and the independent variables of state income inequality and state educational attainment levels, there is no relationship found between political factors and state funding for student <b>grant</b> <b>programs.</b> I conclude less numerically observable variables within the states and within legislatures {{play a role in}} determining funding allocations for state funded student <b>grant</b> <b>programs...</b>|$|R
