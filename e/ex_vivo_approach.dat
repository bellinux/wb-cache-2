40|$|Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is an {{inherited}} muscle disease that {{is characterized by}} a lack of dystrophin expression in the membrane cytoskeleton of muscle fibers. This lack of dystrophin is responsible for muscle fiber necrosis which leads to the muscle atrophy and progressive muscle weakness, characteristic of the DMD pathology. Myoblast transplantation and gene therapy based on viral vectors {{have been shown to be}} efficient in the delivery of genes to skeletal muscle but has been hindered by several limitations. Results from our laboratory and others have shown that adenovirus and herpes simplex virus efficiently infect neonatal muscles, however, within a few days of mouse development, the muscle is largely refractory to transduction with both viral vectors. Since myoblasts possess the ability to fuse with immature and mature myofibers, and viral vectors can efficiently transduce myoblasts, the ex vivo technique can be used as an alternative method to achieve viral gene delivery to mature muscle fibers. We have demonstrated that the myoblast-mediated gene transfer may be used to deliver viral vectors (Adenovirus and herpes simplex virus type 1) into mature muscle. In addition, we have shown that the <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>approach</b> using mdx myoblasts engineered with adenoviral vectors, which carry the full-length dystrophin gene, is capable of restoring dystrophin to the injected mdx muscle.

Finally, experiments are ongoing to assess the regeneration-promoting effect of AMA 0428 in vivo.

We used in vitro and <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>approaches</b> to study the deacetylation of 3 / 15 ADON by enzymes and cells/tissues present on their way from the food matrix to the blood in humans. We found that luminal deacetylation by digestive enzymes and bacteria is limited. Using human cells, tissues and S 9 fractions, {{we were able to}} demonstrate that small intestine and liver possess strong deacetylation capacity compared to colon and kidneys. Interestingly, in most cases, deacetylation was more efficient for 3 ADON than 15 ADON. Although we initially thought that carboxylesterases (CES) could be responsible for the deacetylation of 3 / 15 ADON, the use of pure human CES 1 / 2 and of CES inhibitor demonstrated that CES are not involved. Taken together, our original model system allowed us to identify the small intestine and the liver as the main site of deacetylation of ingested 3 / 15 ADON in humans...|$|R
40|$|The {{systemic}} {{inflammatory response}} syndrome {{is a complex}} host response {{to a variety of}} clinical insults, generally leading to severe pathology. The human chorionic gonadotropin β-chain-related tetrapeptide leucine-glutamine- glycine-valine (LQGV) reduces hemorrhagic and LPS-induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome, but its mechanisms of action are not yet fully understood. Through the combination of in vivo, in vitro, and <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>approaches,</b> we demonstrate that LQGV actively stimulates corticosterone production in mice and thereby suppresses in vivo TLR 4 -directed inflammation upon LPS administration. Blocking in vivo glucocorticosteroid receptor signaling reduced the prosurvival effect of LQGV. Also, upon multiple TLR activation by heat-killed Listeria monocytogenes, splenocytes from LQGV-treated mice produced significantly less TNF-α and IL- 6, which was absent after in vitro blockage of the glucocorticosteroid receptor. Using adrenal gland and adrenal cell line cultures, we show that LQGV stimulates corticosterone production. Moreover, by using specific pharmacological inhibitors of the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and luteinizing hormone receptors as well as of cAMP signaling, we demonstrate that LQGV stimulates the ACTH receptor. These data show that the b-human chorionic gonadotropin-related tetrapeptide LQGV stimulates adrenal glucocorticosteroid production through activation of the ACTH receptor with consequent glucocorticoid receptor activation and immunosuppression in C 57 BL/ 6 mice.

40|$|The NF-κB pathway is {{regulated}} by SUMOylation {{at least at}} three levels: the inhibitory molecule IκBα, the IKK subunit γ/NEMO and the p 52 precursor p 100. Here we investigate the role of SUMO- 2 / 3 in the degradation of IκBα and activation of NF-κB mediated by TNFα. We found that under conditions of deficient SUMOylation, an important delay in both TNFα-mediated proteolysis of IκBα and NF-κB dependent transcription occurs. In vitro and <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>approaches,</b> {{including the use of}} ubiquitin-traps (TUBEs), revealed the formation of chains on IκBα containing SUMO- 2 / 3 and ubiquitin after TNFα stimulation. The integration of SUMO- 2 / 3 appears to promote the formation of ubiquitin chains on IκBα after activation of the TNFα signalling pathway. Furthermore, heterologous chains of SUMO- 2 / 3 and ubiquitin promote a more efficient degradation of IκBα by the 26 S proteasome in vitro compared to chains of either SUMO- 2 / 3 or ubiquitin alone. Consistently, Ubc 9 silencing reduced the capture of IκBα modified with SUMO-ubiquitin hybrid chains that display a defective proteasome-mediated degradation. Thus, hybrid SUMO- 2 / 3 -ubiquitin chains increase the susceptibility of modified IκBα to the action of 26 S proteasome, contributing to the optimal control of NF-κB activity after TNFα-stimulation...|$|R
