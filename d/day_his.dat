5|$|Beyond the OULC, Thorpe {{achieved}} {{the presidency of}} the Oxford University Law Society, although his principal objective was {{the presidency of the}} Oxford Union, an office frequently used as a stepping-stone to national prominence.

He was easily defeated by the future broadcaster Robin <b>Day.</b> <b>His</b> single-minded pursuit of office, and the dubious strategies he sometimes employed, led to some acrimonious campaigns, but he gained many supporters, and later in 1950 beat two formidable contenders—the socialist Dick Taverne and the Conservative William Rees-Mogg—to secure the presidency for the Hilary term of 1951.|$|E

Allen opted to play for Middlesex against Northamptonshire while the team for the second Test was being chosen, and took six for 77.
