40|$|Health {{of urban}} {{inhabitants}} {{is threatened by}} <b>hazardous,</b> chemical components <b>in</b> solid waste, particularly in illegally dumped waste. Improvements in solid waste management can be achieved {{with the aid of}} geo-informatics. Major decision support is aided through identification, collection and elaboration of data, and risk analysis of <b>hazardous</b> substances, <b>in</b> <b>combination</b> with optimized garbage collection logistics. Some of the developments in geo-informatics for waste management are described and applications at different locations in the world are explained...|$|R
30|$|In this study, {{new series}} of stable densely {{dispersed}} Ag NPs were obtained using an entirely green synthesis approach. In this approach, the natural non-toxic ingredients extracted from the myrrh plant were used, instead of common <b>hazardous</b> chemicals, <b>in</b> <b>combination</b> with UV light irradiation to create the Ag NPs. Myrrh extract {{has been used as}} reducing and capping agent for the synthesis of NPs which could be advantageous over microbial synthesis as there is no need of the elaborated process of culturing and maintaining the cells.|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates whether {{trucking}} {{firms that}} haul hazardous materials differ from firms {{who do not}} haul these goods. It employs a database of 75, 000 federal government safety audits of United States motor carriers. We find that hazardous materials firms are five times larger, in terms of annual fleet miles, than non-hazardous materials haulers, {{and are more likely}} to be general commodity carriers. Based on Poisson regression analysis, firms that carry hazardous materials exclusively have an accident rate 11 % higher than comparable firms that do not carry these commodities, and a rate of fatalities and serious injuries that is 22 % higher. Firms that carry <b>hazardous</b> materials <b>in</b> <b>combination</b> with general freight, have an accident rate that is 18 % higher and a fatality and injury rate that is 24 % higher. Among hazardous materials carriers, accident rates decline with firm size. Private carriers are safer than for-hire carriers. Haulers of gases in packages and liquids in tanks have the highest accident rates. Carriers of hazardous wastes have the lowest accident rates. Firms classified as "unsatisfactory " in safety audits by the federal government have an accident rate 50 % worse than other firms, though these accidents do not result in a higher incidence of fatalities and injuries. 1...|$|R
