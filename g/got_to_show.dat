Third Day's bassist Tai Anderson recalls that [...] "We got together in their home studio and had a jam session that went with Mac's idea of a song {{based on the idea}} of 'lift up your head' from the Psalms...

500|$|The {{end of the}} storyline was criticised by gay advocates after Charlie {{was seen}} having sex with Hugo Austin (Bernard Curry) and Joey left Summer Bay alone. Anderson also {{suggested}} that Hugo may {{have been enough to}} [...] "sway" [...] Charlie towards men. Some sceptics had suggested that Home and Away would not allow Charlie and Joey to remain in a same-sex relationship. Anderson later acknowledged she had feared that the story would see her typecast as [...] "the lesbian cop." [...] Anderson reflected on the storyline during an interview with The Daily Telegraph, saying [...] "The Charlie/Joey (lesbian) storyline was the first time you got to see Charlie's vulnerable side. (The controversy) blew my mind – I wasn't expecting it at all. I think it was a fantastic storyline because for the first time I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> the producers and audience what I could do." ...|$|E

500|$|Producer Lewis Merenstein had a {{background}} in jazz, and according to Merenstein, Morrison [...] "was not an aficionado of jazz when I met him. R and soul, yes; but jazz, no. For the Astral Weeks recording sessions, Merenstein first contacted veteran bassist Richard Davis. Perhaps {{best known for his}} work with Eric Dolphy, Davis essentially served as the session leader, and it was through Davis that Merenstein recruited guitarist Jay Berliner, percussionist Warren Smith, Jr., and drummer Connie Kay. All of these musicians had strong backgrounds in jazz; Berliner had worked closely with Charles Mingus and Kay was part of the Modern Jazz Quartet. Morrison was still working with Kielbania and Payne, but for these sessions, they were essentially replaced. According to Kielbania, [...] "I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> all the bass lines to Richard Davis. He embellished a lot of them, but I gave him the feeling." ...|$|E

In May 2005 organizers announced Wicked Wisdom would perform on {{the second stage of}} 2005's Ozzfest. Fans of the festival were outraged, claiming the band did not have the credibility to perform at the music festival. Aware of the questions about the band's addition to Ozzfest, Pinkett Smith said, [...] "I'm not here asking for any favors. You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> and prove. And not every audience is going to go for it." [...] Wicked Wisdom's guitarist Pocket Honore said while early dates of the tour were rocky, [...] "once word got out that we weren't a joke, people started coming out and by the sixth or seventh gig we were on fire". Pinkett Smith agreed, saying, [...] "After seven dates within the Ozzfest tour, the whole attitude of it started to turn around once the word of mouth started getting out." ...|$|E

Signing a two-year deal with Lincoln, Nutter stated — [...] "I {{think it will}} benefit {{me to have a}} fresh start, play in front of new people and show what I can do. I feel I'm better than this level but I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that and we have to show that as a team". His Lincoln debut came on the opening day of the 2011–12 season, playing the whole match as Lincoln twice squandered a lead to draw 2–2 with Southport at Haig Avenue. He scored his first goal for the club in November 2011, netting Lincoln's third with a shot from outside the area in a 3–0 home win over Ebbsfleet United. Nutter would add to his goal tally once more during the campaign when he scored a 20-yard free-kick in an important 2–0 win against relegation rivals Newport County on 24 March 2012. Nutter played in all 51 of Lincoln's matches during the season, with the club struggling to adapt during their first season back in non-league, finishing just above the relegation places.|$|E

As Susan's vision went, {{and later as}} she was put into the MRI scanner, Woodburne portrayed real fear and panic". TV Week named Susan as their third [...] "Top Aussie TV Mum". They said [...] "strong-spirited Susan has always doted on her kids, even while putting up with cheating hubby Karl (Alan Fletcher). The modern mum has seen it all, and still comes up smiling. In 2010, Susan was voted the third [...] "Most Popular TV Mum" [...] in a survey carried out by Yahoo!. Susan was placed seventh in a similar survey carried out by Vouchercodes.co.uk, to find [...] "Britain's favourite television mother". They said [...] "viewers identified with love for her family". In April 2010, Sky included Susan in their feature on the twenty-five most memorable Neighbours characters. They stated, [...] "Kindly but strong matriarch Susan {{may not be the}} most medically robust woman (amnesia, multiple sclerosis, frequent questionable haircuts), but she gets by thanks to her family. She's so devoted, in fact, that after Malcolm, Billy and Libby (sort of) flew the nest, she went and inherited Zeke and Rachel from second husband Alex. Despite her big heart, she can be counted on to get fierce with anyone who tries to upset the Ramsay Street balance – her frequent fights with Izzy in the middle of the street over Karl cemented her reputation as everyone's favourite soap mum." ...|$|E

SoapNet noted that [...] "Chloe's world is turned upside down" [...] {{as a result of}} the diagnosis. The leukemia storyline spans into January 2012. Hendrickson was happy with the storyline, stating that [...] "it was my supporting actors who supported me through the entire shooting day, and the writing. It was just all wrapped up in a neat little package. I could not ask for a better show." [...] Delia needs a bone marrow transplant to survive. Billy is being forced away from town by his wife's father Victor Newman (Eric Braeden). Victor arranges for Billy to secretly be able to donate his bone marrow, saving Delia's life, though he passes the donation off as Kevin's. Hendrickson praised the writing for the storyline as a [...] "full arc" [...] which had a [...] "beginning, middle and an end". She said, [...] "It was a great story. I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> a lot of range, and also got to work with some great supporting actors who were in those scenes." [...] For the 39th Daytime Emmy Awards, Hendrickson submitted the scenes in which Chloe is informed of Delia's leukemia, which allowed her to receive a nomination in the category of Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series. In July 2013, Delia has a health scare. In light of Chloe's marriage to Kevin ending and Billy experiencing troubles in his marriage to Victoria Newman (Amelia Heinle), Jamey Giddens of Zap2it observed that this could act as a catalyst towards a [...] "Chilly" [...] (Chloe and Billy) reunion, writing, [...] "The perfect storm of two failing marriages and a sick child seems to be conjuring up the right elements for some Chilly weather in Genoa City." ...|$|E
500|$|Kevin McHale's {{performance}} as Artie in [...] "Scream" [...] inspired several reviewers, including Kate Stanhope of TV Guide and Bell, to write of their regret that McHale could not dance more {{often on the}} show. Reiter called him [...] "a sorely underused Glee resource" [...] and called the number [...] "the best dance moment" [...] of the episode, and Bell declared, [...] "I have one word for this number: Epic." [...] Flandez called it a [...] "phenomenal job", and Stanhope cited [...] "killer performances" [...] by McHale on this number and others as evidence that with Artie only a junior [...] "there is life" [...] in New Directions after McKinley's current seniors graduate. Lynch called the number [...] "awesome" [...] {{and gave it a}}n [...] "A+", and Goldberg described it as [...] "a perfect example of what the show looks like when it's firing on all cylinders"; both reviewers praised the dancing of both performers. Chaney wrote that the performance [...] "lacked the energy and genuine aggression of the original Michael/Janet Jackson collaboration, although at least Kevin McHale and Harry Shum Jr. <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> off their dance skills", and gave it a [...] "C". She felt that [...] "Never Can Say Goodbye", to which she gave a [...] "B−", [...] "worked much better than every track that preceded it" [...] because it adapted the song to the show [...] "instead of trying to out-Jackson Jackson". Lynch called it [...] "a nice summation of her character's journey, but not vocally impressive enough to justify listening to outside of the episode" [...] and gave it a [...] "B". Bell described it as a [...] "blah performance", but Stanhope said it was [...] "sweet and reflective". Futterman wrote that it was [...] "a tune well-suited for Quinn's sultry voice and the flipped meaning she gives the lyrics", and Slezak had a similar take: he gave it an [...] "A" [...] and called it a [...] "remarkably lovely fit" [...] for her voice.|$|E

500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by film-maker Brett Ratner in Los Angeles, and features a cameo appearance from 30 Rock's Jack McBrayer. Prior to filming the video, or releasing the single, Carey had toned her body, and lost a reported twenty pounds. Due to her slim-down, she and Ratner wanted to flaunt Carey's new figure {{as much as possible}} throughout the video: [...] "Mariah looks better than she has ever looked. It's ridiculous. Mariah has an incredible body, but she was always kind of very voluptuous. Now she's just like, fit. And we were like, we've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> this body." [...] As the pair came up with the video's plot, Ratner contacted McBrayer to play a male leading role, alongside Carey. After receiving the call, McBrayer claimed he was so shocked by the proposal, that he didn't believe it at first. He only met with the producers after Ratner personally called him and assured him the authenticity of the offer. In an interview with MTV News, McBrayer joked [...] "I'm always worried now that somebody is pranking me, so at first I was very leery. But when I heard it was legit, and then later on we {{got a phone call from}} Brett Ratner, who directed it. I was like, 'This is either a very elaborate prank, or this is the real deal.'" [...] In the fantasy-themed story, he recalled what he considered the video's most memorable scene, in which he and Carey, dressed in medieval attire, were walking with a unicorn. Additionally, he described the filming process as very simple, as they were given very loose directions and pointers. McBrayer claimed that during one take, they were meant to play Frisbee on the mansion lawn, and he accidentally threw it at Carey's face, jokingly adding [...] "by the time she spins back around — bonk, right in her face. I threw a Frisbee in Mariah Carey's face! I'm like, I'm fired!." [...] When questioned by critics regarding the song and video, Carey responded [...] "Have you seen the 'Touch My Body' video? C'mon. Clearly you must see the humour in that. Even the lyrics, 'I will hunt you down'. If anyone doesn't get the joke by this time then they are an idiot." [...] In an interview with Reuters, Carey described working with Ratner, and her experience filming the video: ...|$|E
2500|$|There is no {{official}} state nickname. However, Missouri's unofficial nickname is the [...] "Show Me State", which appears on its license plates. This phrase has several origins. One is popularly ascribed to {{a speech by}} Congressman Willard Vandiver in 1899, who declared that [...] "I come from a state that raises corn and cotton, cockleburs and Democrats, and frothy eloquence neither convinces nor satisfies me. I'm from Missouri, and you have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> me." [...] This {{is in keeping with}} the saying [...] "I'm from Missouri" [...] which means [...] "I'm skeptical of the matter and not easily convinced." [...] However, according to researchers, the phrase [...] "show me" [...] was already in use before the 1890s. Another one states that it is a reference to Missouri miners who were taken to Leadville, Colorado to replace striking workers. Since the new men were unfamiliar with the mining methods, they required frequent instruction.|$|E
