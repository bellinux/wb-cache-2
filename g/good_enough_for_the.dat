5|$|The next year, Taylor pitched for the Double-A Albany-Colonie Yankees, {{where the}} Yankees {{planned to have}} Taylor work on his curveball, as they already felt that his fastball was <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> major leagues. Entering the season, he was named baseball's second-best {{prospect}} behind Chipper Jones. That year, Taylor had a 137 record, a 3.48 ERA, and 150 strikeouts in 163 innings, and also led the Eastern League with 102 walks. In 1994, {{he was expected to}} pitch for the Triple-A Columbus Clippers of the International League, and start for the Yankees to begin the 1995 season at the latest, dependent on how he would have performed in spring training. After the season ended, the Yankees wanted Taylor to take part in an instructional league to work on his fundamentals. Taylor declined to attend the camp, and instead chose to return to his home in North Carolina.|$|E

25|$|In the 2006 NBA season, Brand {{experienced}} a personal renaissance.

Although the Clippers eventually lost in game 7 of the second round (Western Conference Semifinals) against the Phoenix Suns, the Clippers had the best season that their franchise had ever seen at that time.

25|$|The phrase 'bush carpentry' is a {{familiar}} Australian usage, but finding an exact description of its practice is rare. The Macquarie Dictionary for example, defines a bush carpenter as a rough amateur carpenter, and G. A. Wilkes says he is a rough and ready carpenter. The Macquarie in turn defines rough-and-ready as rough, rude or crude, but <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> purpose. Wannan says that a bush carpenter is 'a very rough, unorthodox artisan indeed', and includes a sardonic excerpt from Henry Lawson to exemplify it. In his Bushcraft series Ron Edwards describes hut and furniture building, and 'stockcamp architecture', without once using the phrase 'bush carpentry', though 'rough and ready' recurs. Tocal Agricultural College offers a course in 'Traditional bush timber construction'; The word 'traditional' appears six times in the course outline, but not 'bush carpentry'.|$|E

25|$|Another pre-game storyline {{involved}} backup Steelers tight end/fullback Sean McHugh. McHugh, {{who spent}} {{the past three seasons}} with the Detroit Lions, made that team's 53-man roster {{at the end of the}} preseason, only to be released 24 hours later alongside linebacker Anthony Cannon in order for the Lions to make room for linebacker Ryan Nece and running back Marcus Thomas. The Steelers promptly signed McHugh after the team traded center Sean Mahan back to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in exchange for a draft pick before the start of the season. The subsequent media attention surrounding McHugh had to do with him being deemed not <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Lions (a team that would finish 0–16, the NFL's first imperfect season since the expansion 1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers), but good enough for a Super Bowl team such as the Steelers and being a valuable blocker for Ben Roethlisberger and Willie Parker. McHugh himself had mixed feelings about the situation, feeling bad for his former Lions teammates, but also feeling it's a little payback for the Lions for releasing him in the first place. McHugh would play in the Super Bowl as a blocker, much like his regular season role.|$|E
25|$|A {{day before}} the trade deadline, the Mavericks instigated a deal. The trade sent Josh Howard, James Singleton, and Drew Gooden to the Washington Wizards in {{exchange}} for Caron Butler, Brendan Haywood, and Deshawn Stevenson. The Mavericks felt that this trade was necessary due to Howard's declining performance and apparent unhappiness with the Mavericks organization. Some NBA analysts {{felt that this was}} a good move, because not only did it remove a disgruntled Howard from the line-up, it simultaneously brought Dirk Nowitzki a quality supporting cast, with many believing that the Mavs could contend for a title after the trade went through. The trade clearly worked, because the new-look Mavericks came out of the all-star break with a vengeance. On January 24, 2010, the Dallas Mavericks routed The New York Knicks 128–78. This was the third largest margin of victory in NBA history. The previous largest margin of victory for the Mavericks was 45 points. After dropping the second-half opener to the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Mavericks went on to win 13-straight games before losing to the New York Knicks. On April 10, the Mavericks clinched the Southwest division after defeating the Portland Trail Blazers 83–77. The Mavericks finished the season with a 55–27 record, <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> second seed in the Western Conference. The Mavericks then entered the post-season with quite a bit of optimism and an assurance that they could seriously contend for a title.|$|E
500|$|The strongest {{aspects of}} Friday's game were his ball skills, footballing {{intelligence}} and {{physical and mental}} strength.

5|$|The 1999–2000 Devils {{focused more}} on offense, which was {{reinforced}} by their 251 goals scored, <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> second in <b>the</b> league.

500|$|Friday's {{style of}} play was based around his {{exceptional}} ball skills, described by Cardiff doctor Leslie Hamilton as [...] "absolutely fabulous", and his instinctive footballing vision, which enabled him both to execute flamboyant individual moves and to create attacks for his teammates. Jimmy Andrews, his manager at Cardiff, later called Friday [...] "the complete centre-forward" [...] and placed him {{on a par with}} Alan Shearer, while Maurice Evans claimed that he could have played for England, and was at least on a level with international strikers he had worked with such as John Aldridge and Dean Saunders. This opinion was shared by Hamilton and Friday's Reading teammate John Murray, both of whom firmly declared in separate interviews that Friday would have been <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> England team had he [...] "sorted his head out", in Hamilton's words.|$|E
500|$|Although {{he would}} miss {{part of the}} {{following}} season with a concussion, his 12 goals and 45 assists still led all Devils defencemen in scoring, [...] The Devils were eliminated {{in the first round}} of the playoffs again, losing to the Pittsburgh Penguins in five games.

500|$|Writer Martin Aston {{notes that}} Albini [...] "stress live {{performances}} and quick takes".

According to Wiggs, Albini's [...] "hands-off" [...] style of engineering greatly helped to shape the sound of the recordings. Albini's contributions included convincing the band members {{to reduce the number of}} harmonies in the songs and give more prominence to Deal's vocals; Donelly believes this improved the album, by making the performances [...] "more effective and sadder and... focused". The tempo of the songs was faster than Wiggs had envisioned; this was necessary because Deal could not keep her breath long enough to slow down each note. The Breeders recorded the Lennon–McCartney composition [...] "Happiness is a Warm Gun" [...] at the request of Ivo-Watts.|$|E
