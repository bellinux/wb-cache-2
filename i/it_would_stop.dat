5|$|With a VFD, the {{stopping}} {{sequence is}} just the opposite as the starting sequence. The frequency and voltage applied to the motor are ramped down at a controlled rate. When the frequency approaches zero, the motor is shut off. A small amount of braking torque is available to help decelerate the load a little faster than <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>stop</b> if the motor were simply switched off and allowed to coast. Additional braking torque {{can be obtained by}} adding a braking circuit (resistor controlled by a transistor) to dissipate the braking energy. With a four-quadrant rectifier (active front-end), the VFD is able to brake the load by applying a reverse torque and injecting the energy back to the AC line.|$|E
5|$|In August 2017, NYC Ferry filed {{plans to}} build four ferry docks: one in Soundview, one in Yorkville, one near Stuyvesant Cove, {{and one on the}} Lower East Side. It also sought to add two more piers to its home port at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The Soundview route was revised so that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>stop</b> at East 34th Street instead of at East 62nd Street, which would no longer be built. That month, Brooklyn {{politicians}} called for docks to be built in Coney Island and Canarsie, owing to the new system's popularity. The Astoria route was projected to carry 1,800 daily passengers upon opening, by which point the service had seen 1.4 million riders. Due to even more ridership demand, three extra ferries were ordered in September 2017, by which time over 2 million people had ridden the ferry.|$|E
5|$|This rebellion, {{and ongoing}} {{political}} instability, sapped Sudirman {{of much of}} his remaining strength. On 5October 1948, after celebrations of the military's third anniversary, Sudirman collapsed. After being examined by numerous doctors, {{he was diagnosed with}} tuberculosis. At {{the end of the month}} he was brought to Panti Rapih Hospital and had his right lung collapsed, in hope that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>stop</b> the spread of the disease. During his time at the hospital, he delegated most of his duties to Nasution. However, the two continued to discuss plans for the war against the Dutch, and Sudirman continued to receive status reports. They agreed that guerrilla warfare, which had been applied on raids into Dutch-held territory since May, would be best suited for their needs; towards this goal, Sudirman issued a general order on 11November, with Nasution handling most of the preparations. Sudirman was released from the hospital on 28November 1948.|$|E

5|$|Up to 60,000 Italian {{volunteers were}} now {{operating}} in Spain, and {{the removal of}} foreign nationals was discussed by the Non-Intervention Committee. Italy had made a declaration that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>stop</b> Italian volunteers from fighting in Spain on 7 January 1937, and put a moratorium on volunteers on 20 January, also agreeing to support limitations on the number of volunteers on the 25th. Italy continued to request that belligerent rights be given to the Nationalists and Republicans, so both would gain the right to search vessels for contraband, thus removing the need for naval patrols. This request was opposed by the United Kingdom, France and the Soviet Union. British recognition of Italian sovereignty over Abyssinia following the Second Italo-Abyssinian War was an important issue during Anglo-Italian discussions in August 1937. Following Eden's disagreement with Chamberlain and Lord Halifax, Leader of the House of Lords and influential politician, over the issue, any agreement recognising Italian sovereignty was postponed until after the planned shipping conference had taken place.|$|E

25|$|When Fortis faced near bankruptcy, {{its assets}} were divided among several companies. The same {{insurance}} branch which previously sponsored Feyenoord became ASR. To help with their brand recognition, {{it decided to}} continue Fortis' sponsor obligations, but in 2011, it announced <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>stop</b> its sponsorship deal in the 2012â13 season. However, due to an economic recession, Feyenoord had trouble finding a new shirt sponsor. Feyenoord and ASR therefore reached a compromise: ASR would remain sponsor for one more season, giving Feyenoord the time it needed to find another sponsor. After negotiations with several corporations, Opel became the club's new sponsor, signing a contract until 2018.|$|E
25|$|In 1938 Mishaâs {{father was}} sent on an {{extended}} {{mission to the}} Far East, where he went with his whole family. They lived on the In Station in Birakan and Birobidzhan.

Misha and his brother Seva {{were sent to the}} town of Troitsk in the South Urals to their aunt Raya, their father's sister. Their father went to the front, and their mother stayed in Kiev and joined them later. In 1943, their aunt Raya, a general practitioner and surgeon, was mobilised, and Misha went with her on a medical train.

Russia and Ukraine also agreed on the volume of oil to be transported through Ukraine.

In November 2015, the National Post {{reported}} that a link between the southern provinces and the Alaska Railroad was again being considered by the Canadian federal government, this time routing to Alberta. In this scenario, the route would originate at Delta Junction, Alaska and use Carmacks, Yukon as a hub, like prior plans. The route would continue through Watson Lake, Yukon before entering British Columbia, where <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>stop</b> at Fort Nelson, British Columbia.

25|$|Anime {{follows the}} typical {{production}} of animation, including storyboarding, voice acting, character design, and cel production (Shirobako, itself a series, highlights {{many of the}} aspects involved in anime production). Since the 1990s, animators have increasingly used computer animation to improve {{the efficiency of the}} production process. Artists like NoburÅ Åfuji pioneered the earliest anime works, which were experimental and consisted of images drawn on blackboards, stop motion animation of paper cutouts, and silhouette animation. Cel animation grew in popularity until it came to dominate the medium. In the 21st century, the use of other animation techniques is mostly limited to independent short films, including the stop motion puppet animation work produced by Tadahito Mochinaga, KihachirÅ Kawamoto and Tomoyasu Murata. Computers were integrated into the animation process in the 1990s, with works such as Ghost in the Shell and Princess Mononoke mixing cel animation with computer-generated images. Fuji Film, a major cel production company, announced <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>stop</b> cel production, producing an industry panic to procure cel imports and hastening the switch to digital processes.|$|E
