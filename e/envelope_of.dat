5|$|This star is {{primarily}} {{composed of a}} carbon–oxygen mixture that was generated by helium fusion in the progenitor star. This is overlaid by an <b>envelope</b> <b>of</b> lighter elements, with the materials segregated by mass {{because of the high}} surface gravity. The outer atmosphere of Sirius B is now almost pure hydrogen—the element with the lowest mass—and no other elements are seen in its spectrum.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} in the future, IK Pegasi A will consume the {{hydrogen}} fuel at its core and start to evolve away from the main sequence to form a red giant. The <b>envelope</b> <b>of</b> a red giant can grow to significant dimensions, extending up to a hundred times its previous radius (or larger). Once IK Pegasi A expands to the point where its outer envelope overflows the Roche lobe of its companion, a gaseous accretion disk will form around the white dwarf. This gas, composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, will then accrete onto the surface of the companion. This mass transfer between the stars will also cause their mutual orbit to shrink.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the {{planetary}} formation epoch the inner Solar System was populated by 50–100 Moon- to Mars-sized planetary embryos. Further growth was possible only because these bodies collided and merged, which took less than 100million years. These objects would have gravitationally interacted with one another, tugging at each other's orbits until they collided, growing larger until the four terrestrial planets we know today took shape. One such giant collision is thought to have formed the Moon (see Moons below), while another removed the outer <b>envelope</b> <b>of</b> the young Mercury.|$|E

40|$|<b>Envelopes</b> <b>of</b> {{a marine}} isolate, c-A 1, {{and of a}} {{terrestrial}} isolate, 121, were compared for their susceptibility to disintegration in distilled water after exposure to 0. 05 m MgCl 2 and to 0. 1 and 1. 0 m NaCl. After exposure to MgCl 2 alone, both types <b>of</b> <b>envelopes</b> remained intact in distilled water. <b>Envelopes</b> <b>of</b> marine isolate c-A 1, but not of the terrestrial isolate, fragmented in distilled water after exposure to 1. 0 m NaCl. Partial reaggregation of the c-A 1 envelope fragments occurred on addition of MgCl 2. In cation-exchange experiments, bound Mg++ in the <b>envelopes</b> <b>of</b> both organisms was displaced by Na+. The <b>envelopes</b> <b>of</b> c-A 1 were found to contain lipopolysaccharide, muramic acid, {{and a variety of}} phospholipids, of which the major component was phosphatidylethanolamine, accompanied by lesser amounts of phosphatidic acid, diphosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylserine. Analyses <b>of</b> <b>envelope</b> acid hydrolysates revealed a similar amino acid distribution in the marine and terrestrial isolates, but <b>envelopes</b> <b>of</b> c-A 1 had less than half the total amino acid content <b>of</b> <b>envelopes</b> <b>of</b> 121 per <b>envelope</b> dry weight.

5|$|Brown {{speculates that}} the {{predicted}} planet {{is most likely}} an ejected ice giant, similar in composition to Uranus and Neptune: a mixture of rock and ice with a small <b>envelope</b> <b>of</b> gas. Based on its size, the considerable gravitational pull of Planet Nine could theoretically promote life in subsurface oceans with liquid water in nearby moons. Subsurface oceans have been discovered on the moons Enceladus (water), Dione (possibly water), and subsurface water is postulated for Neptune's largest moon Triton, and possibly also found on Europa.|$|E
5|$|MOA-2009-BLG-387L is a {{red dwarf}} in the Sagittarius {{constellation}} that is host to the planet MOA-2009-BLG-387Lb. The star {{is estimated to be}} nearly 20,000 light years away and approximately one fifth the mass of the Sun, although large confidence intervals exist, reflecting the uncertainties in both the mass and distance. The star drew the attention of astronomers when it became the lens of gravitational microlensing event MOA-2009-BLG-387L, in which it eclipsed a background star and created distorted caustics, an <b>envelope</b> <b>of</b> reflected or refracted light rays. Analysis of the caustic events and of follow-up observational data led to the planet's discovery, which was reported in February 2011.|$|E
5|$|The Patries {{envelope}} {{was composed}} of four alternating layers of cotton cloth and vulcanised rubber (the <b>envelope</b> <b>of</b> its predecessor, the Jaune, comprised three layers). The outside layer was of cotton cloth, covered with lead chromate to prevent the actinic components of sunlight from destroying the rubber skin which formed the second layer. This second layer prevented leakage of the hydrogen lifting gas from the envelope. The third layer was of cotton, which was protected by the rubber fourth and final layer from damage caused by the hydrogen. This final rubber layer was thinner, and therefore lighter, than the first. The rubber sheeting for the second and fourth layers was supplied by the German company Continental AG.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{paper is}} devoted to the {{properties}} <b>of</b> the <b>envelopes</b> <b>of</b> meromorphy of neighborhoods of symplectically immersed two-spheres in complex Kähler surfaces. The method used to study the <b>envelopes</b> <b>of</b> meromorphy is based on Gromov’s theory of pseudoholomorphic curves. The exposition includes a construction of a complete family of holomorphic deformations of a non-compact complex curve in a complex manifold, parametrized by a finite codimension analytic subset of a Banach ball. The existence of this family is used to prove a generalization of Levi’s continuity principle, which is applied to describe <b>envelopes</b> <b>of</b> meromorphy. Bibliography: 15 titles. In the present paper we study the <b>envelopes</b> <b>of</b> meromorphy of neighborhoods of two-spheres immersed in complex surfaces. Throughout the paper a complex surface means a (Hausdorff) connected complex two-dimensional manifold X countable at infinity. Let U be a domain in X...|$|R

5|$|The area of {{disturbed}} {{weather that}} would soon become Chantal began in a large <b>envelope</b> <b>of</b> low pressure {{on the morning of}} September 10. The disturbed weather, nested off the coast of Bermuda, was one of the remnants of an old frontal trough that had extended from Hispaniola to the central north Atlantic Ocean. This particular area of disturbed weather become part of the northeast portion of a low-pressure system. On September 10, a reconnaissance aircraft found sustained winds of 30mph (50km/h) and a 1010millibar (29.83inHg) pressure reading. This reading indicated the system developed into the fifth tropical depression of the 1983 season.|$|E
5|$|The {{difference}} {{in the shape of}} the light curves is believed to be caused, in the case of TypeII-L supernovae, by the expulsion of most of the hydrogen <b>envelope</b> <b>of</b> the progenitor star. The plateau phase in TypeII-P supernovae is due to a change in the opacity of the exterior layer. The shock wave ionizes the hydrogen in the outer envelope – stripping the electron from the hydrogen atom – resulting in a significant increase in the opacity. This prevents photons from the inner parts of the explosion from escaping. When the hydrogen cools sufficiently to recombine, the outer layer becomes transparent.|$|E
5|$|There exist several {{categories}} of Type II supernova explosions, which are categorized {{based on the}} resulting light curve—a graph of luminosity versus time—following the explosion. Type II-L supernovae show a steady (linear) decline of the light curve following the explosion, whereas Type II-P display a period of slower decline (a plateau) in their light curve followed by a normal decay. Type Ib and Ic supernovae are a type of core-collapse supernova for a massive star that has shed its outer <b>envelope</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen and (for Type Ic) helium. As a result, {{they appear to be}} lacking in these elements.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on September 29, 1998 and on October 5, an area of convection along the wave developed into Atlantic Hurricane Lisa. The wave axis continued westward, and after crossing Central America a low-level circulation developed on October 13, about 170miles (275km) south of the border between El Salvador and Guatemala. The system drifted northwestward, and as convection increased around the center a banding featured began to develop. At 0000UTC on October 15, the National Hurricane Center designated it as Tropical Depression Fourteen-E. The depression contained a large <b>envelope</b> <b>of</b> convective activity, and under favorable conditions including warm water, low vertical wind shear and good outflow, it gradually began to intensify. Initially, the exact direction of forward movement was somewhat uncertain, although a northwestward track was predicted. On the morning of October 15, visible satellite imagery suggested that the center of circulation was located northeast of the previous estimates. Thunderstorm activity organized close to the center by 1400UTC, and by 1800UTC the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Lester.|$|E
5|$|A unique {{feature of}} the Homunculus {{is the ability to}} measure the {{spectrum}} of the central object at different latitudes by the reflected spectrum from different portions of the lobes. These clearly show a polar wind where the stellar wind is faster and stronger at high latitudes thought to be due to rapid rotation causing gravity brightening towards the poles. In contrast the spectrum shows a higher excitation temperature closer to the equatorial plane. By implication the outer <b>envelope</b> <b>of</b> Eta Carinae A is not strongly convective as that would prevent the gravity darkening. The current axis of rotation of the star does not appear to exactly match the alignment of the Homunculus. This may be due to interaction with Eta Carinae B which also modifies the observed stellar winds.|$|E
5|$|After {{twenty years}} of career struggles and obscurity, Thelonious Monk had become a jazz star with a {{residency}} at the Five Spot Café in New York City's East Village. In his first stable job in years, he helped transform the small bar {{into one of the}} city's most popular venues, as it attracted bohemians, hipsters, and devout fans of Monk's music. His employment there was a result of an appeal by his manager Harry Colomby to the State Liquor Authority (SLA) to restore Monk's cabaret card. Monk was stripped of the card in 1951 when he was convicted of narcotics possession; he had refused to betray his friend and pianist Bud Powell to the police after they discovered Powell's glassine <b>envelope</b> <b>of</b> heroin laying beside Monk's feet in the car of Powell's female companion.|$|E

5|$|As a vespid wasp, P. exclamans nests are {{typically}} {{made up of}} paper with a single layer of cells with open combs. Although nest size varies, the upper limit is around 500 cells. Although many vespid wasp nests have an outer <b>envelope</b> <b>of</b> paper, P. exclamans nests do not. As indicated by Strassmann and Orgren, “Nests are approximately circular, and have a single off-center pedicel usually located towards {{the top of the}} nest. Cells near the pedicle are the oldest.” P. exclamans are particularly able to colonize new sites as foundresses often disperse into new territories. P. exclamans have often been found to have nests located near man-made structures and tend to more readily build nests in and near these man-made structures. Out of six wasp species, P. exclamans {{was the only one that}} occupied artificial nesting sites. It prefers well-lit, open sites.|$|E
5|$|Having {{learned the}} truth about Dexter's identity, Arthur (John Lithgow) confronts Dexter (Michael C. Hall) at the police station, where nobody else knows Arthur is the Trinity Killer. He warns Dexter to leave him alone from now on. When he leaves, Dexter follows Arthur in his car, and accidentally strikes another car on his way. Dexter follows Arthur to a bank, where he sees Arthur bring a large {{envelope}} back to his van. Dexter attacks Arthur, knocking him out and dragging him into the van, and Dexter realizes the envelope is filled with cash. Dexter plans to take Arthur's van away and kill Arthur, but he spots {{the driver of the}} car he struck earlier talking to police officers next to Dexter's car. Dexter hides the envelope and confronts the driver, who acts very irritable. A frustrated Dexter attacks him and is detained by the police.

5|$|In 2000, David Martill et al. {{announced}} {{the preservation of}} soft tissue in a specimen referred to a cf.

The fossil, with inventory number BRSMG CF2781, {{was in the early}} 1990s, in an already prepared state, discovered in the legacy of the late Professor John Challinor, which had used it to illustrate his lectures with. Its provenance is unknown. It consists of a series of eight caudal vertebrae in a cut slab of carbonate mudstone, which was judged to date from the late Hettangian to Sinemurian stages. Parts of the fossil were preserved {{in such a way that}} an <b>envelope</b> <b>of</b> preserved soft tissue is visible around the vertebrae, and show the presence of an epidermal layer over the scutes. The authors concluded that the osteoderms of all basal armoured dinosaurs were covered in a tough, probably keratinous layer of skin.|$|E

5|$|The National Hurricane Center {{forecasts}} {{storm surge}} using the SLOSH model, {{which is an}} abbreviation for Sea, Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes.

Local topography, bay and river orientation, depth of the sea bottom, astronomical tides, {{as well as other}} physical features, are taken into account in a predefined grid referred to as a SLOSH basin. Overlapping SLOSH basins are defined for the southern and eastern coastline of the continental U.S. Some storm simulations use more than one SLOSH basin; for instance, Hurricane Katrina SLOSH model runs used both the Lake Ponchartrain / New Orleans basin, and the Mississippi Sound basin, for the northern Gulf of Mexico landfall.

5|$|The nuclear {{pores are}} highly {{efficient}} at selectively allowing {{the passage of}} materials {{to and from the}} nucleus, because the nuclear envelope has a considerable amount of traffic.

The nuclear <b>envelope</b> <b>of</b> a typical mammalian cell contains 3000–4000 pore complexes. If the cell is synthesizing DNA each pore complex needs to transport about 100 histone molecules per minute. If the cell is growing rapidly, each complex also needs to transport about 6 newly assembled large and small ribosomal subunits per minute from the nucleus to the cytosol, where they are used to synthesize proteins.|$|E
