40|$|We use {{longitudinal}} data on over 1, 500 children born in 2001 in Vietnam {{to study the}} impact of early childhood stunting on height, lagging in schooling progression and cognitive outcomes in late childhood (age 8 - 10 years). Our preferred estimates utilize 2 SLS estimators to control for the endogenous determination of early childhood stunting and also include control for child sex and birth order, mother’s height and BMI, household socioeconomic status, and community characteristics. These estimates indicate that deficits in height-for-age at age 12 months have negative impacts on height in late childhood but not on schooling and cognitive outcomes in late childhood. The children who were stunted or moderately stunted at age 12 months display significant catch-up growth, recovering half of their deficits in height-for-age by age 8 years. Socioeconomic status in infancy has negative effects on both stunting in infancy and poor subsequent <b>educational</b> <b>outcomes</b> <b>in</b> late childhood, which result in significant associations between stunting in infancy and some subsequent <b>educational</b> <b>outcomes</b> <b>in</b> late childhood – but not causal effects once there is control fo...|$|E

Moreover, the more time first generation migrant children have received education in their origin country, the more relevant the education system of the origin country will be. Rumbaut (2004) has shown that educational performance of first generation migrant children differs extensively between children who have migrated {{at an early age}} and children who have migrated later in life.

40|$|This review aims {{to answer}} the {{following}} overarching review question: What is the evidence around how decentralising decision-making to the school level affects <b>educational</b> <b>outcomes</b> <b>in</b> low and middle income contexts (LMICs) ? This broad question has been broken down into two discrete sub-questions: (1) What is the impact of school-based decision-making on <b>educational</b> <b>outcomes</b> <b>in</b> LMICs? (2) Under what conditions and circumstances does school-based decision-making have a positive (or negative) impact on educational outcomes? The primary objective of the study, therefore, is to gather, assess and synthesise the existing evidence around how the decentralisation of decision-making to schools affects a broad range of <b>educational</b> <b>outcomes</b> <b>in</b> LMICs (question 1 above). This objective will be accomplished by examining the results of experimental and/or quasi-experimental studies that consider the impact of at least one model of school-based decision-making on any of the proximal or final outcomes depicted in the conceptual framework above. We also aim to draw conclusions about why particular models of school-based management work in some low-income country contexts (and not in others), in order to make determinations about the particular characteristics and contextual factors which lead to positive (or negative) impact (question 2 above). This objective will be accomplished by examining evidence collected through a broader range of studies, including but not limited to that obtained from the included studies referenced in response to question 1. In addition to examining the overall (positive and negative) effects of decentralisation processes on the outcomes of interest, we aim to examine how changes in decision-making processes might impact differentially on diverse groups within societies. We are particularly concerned with groups which have historically experienced poor service delivery and/or demonstrated poor educational outcomes (for example, marginalised or low-performing students) ...|$|E

Strategies to overcome differences in cultural and communicative codes between students and the dominating cultural ethos of schools, e. g. adaptation and resistance, are discussed. In the empirical part, some concepts and indicators relating to inclusion/exclusion deriving from the theoretical part are applied to the extreme cases at the North-South European axis: Spain and Norway.
