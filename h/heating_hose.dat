50|$|<b>Heated</b> <b>hoses</b> {{are used}} in bonding technology, filling and dosing systems, medical technology, chemical, {{pharmaceutical}} and food industry, extruder applications, and research & development. The <b>heated</b> <b>hoses</b> are used wherever a liquid, viscous or melted medium has to be transported {{from one place to}} another, e.g. chocolate, jelly or hotmelt. In most applications, the temperature of the medium needs to remain constant at a specified value irrespective of variations in ambient temperature.|$|R

50|$|A <b>heated</b> <b>hose</b> {{consists}} of a flexible hose, through which the media is pumped. This hose determines the resistance against temperature and chemicals. A heating element is wrapped on the hose and then it is covered with insulation material. Possible insulation materials are Polyamid, steel wire, ore silicone. The heating element contains a heat sensor. Fittings and fixtures can vary with the application.|$|R
50|$|Although modifying glass tubing is {{no longer}} an {{essential}} laboratory technique, many are still familiar with the basic methods. A glass cutter is used to break pieces of glass tubing into smaller pieces. Freshly cut edges are flame polished before use to remove the rough edge. Glass tubing can be bent by heating evenly over a Bunsen flame to red <b>heat.</b> <b>Hose</b> barbs can be added to tubing, giving a better grip and seal for attaching plastic or rubber tubing.|$|R
40|$|In {{this works}} {{the effects of}} the {{hardness}} on the stress relaxation behaviour of EPDM rubber at the room temperature were experimentally investigated. EPDM rubber show outstanding heat ozone and weather resistance and has excellent electrical properties. Therefore this rubber as an elastomer is an engineering material that has wide range of applications in industry such as door and window seals radiator garden and <b>heating</b> <b>hoses</b> tubing washers belts electrical insulation roofing membrane and rubber mechanical goods. In the study stress relaxation experiments were carried out for different loading programs by using EPDM specimens having different hardnesses. In addition for the loading programs that were implemented it is shown that for the EPDM rubbers tested the stress relaxation curves obtained at different stretch ratios may be represented by a single representative curve for the specimens having the same hardnesses...|$|R
40|$|Small-scale 3 D-printing {{has become}} a common appearance. Today there are many {{companies}} specialized in selling and designing small-scale 3 D-printers. Applications range from creating custom-made toys to creating spare parts for the 3 D-printer itself as well as medical applications such as skull parts, knee replacements and hip replacements. The research and development start-up company HB| 3 D uses a 6 degrees-of-freedom robotic arm combined with a plasticating single-screw extruder and <b>heated</b> <b>hose</b> to create large-scale thermoplast products. One challenge is to scale up the 3 D-printing process while ensuring a high-quality product. Feedback control looks promising in increasing the dimensional accuracy of large-scale printed objects by influencing the screw speed to minimize flow disruptions. The {{goal is to create}} a simulation of a model predictive controller and show that an output flow trajectory can be tracked within 1 percent accuracy. The flow response is modeled using a commercially available computational fluid dynamics software package (ANSYS FLUENT Academic Research version 18. 1). This computationally intensive model is simplified using system identification techniques; resulting in a wiener model. Finally, a simulation of using a model predictive controller to track an output flow reference signal is then performed...|$|R
5000|$|Wired {{glass is}} still {{utilized}} in the U.S. for its fire-resistant abilities, and is well-rated to withstand both <b>heat</b> and <b>hose</b> streams. This is why wired glass exclusively {{is used on}} service elevators to prevent fire ingress to the shaft, and also why it is commonly found in institutional settings which are often well-protected and partitioned against fire. [...] The wire prevents the glass from {{falling out of the}} frame even if it cracks under thermal stress, and is far more heat-resistant than a laminating material.|$|R
40|$|Several {{types of}} engine exhaust contain {{moisture}} {{that must be}} maintained in gaseous state when sampling particulates to prevent potential destruction of the particles or damage to the measurement apparatus. This is normally achieved by diluting the sample {{in order to reduce}} the partial pressure, thus avoiding condensation. When measuring size distributions of particulates emitted from a gasoline engine, a dilution ratio of at least 5 : 1 is recommended. However, in some operating modes (e. g. lean homogenous modes) or measurement locations (e. g. downstream of a particulate filter) this ratio can be too high for high-resolution measurements due to the low levels of particulates. The presented study investigates the potential for using a nafion dryer to remove water from the exhaust instead of diluting the sample. An electrical mobility measurement device, a Cambustion DMS 500 mk II, was operated without diluting the exhaust gases but with a nafion dryer to remove water from the exhaust. These dryers are commonly used for measuring particulates in airborne aerosols, but no information has been found in the open literature on their application in engine research. The sampling system was connected to a four cylinder SGDI-engine operating in modes that generate small amount of particulates. Samples were taken in four operating conditions, downstream of the catalyst. Overall losses in the complete system and components of the system were determined by tests with an artificially generated aerosol. Factors such as particulate losses, system performance and sample manipulation are discussed. Particulate size distributions were successfully recorded in operating regimes in which they are difficult to measure with conventional sampling systems using the required dilution. Particulate losses were found to be small in the nafion dryer but large in the <b>heated</b> <b>hose</b> prior to the nafion dryer...|$|R
40|$|The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) {{deactivated}} several aging {{nuclear fuel}} storage basins. Planners for this effort were greatly concerned that radioactive contamination {{present on the}} basin walls could become airborne as {{the sides of the}} basins became exposed during deactivation and allowed to dry after water removal. One way to control this airborne contamination was to fix the contamination in place while the pool walls were still submerged. There are many underwater coatings available on the market for marine, naval and other applications. A series of tests were run to determine whether the candidate underwater fixatives were easily applied and adhered well to the substrates (pool wall materials) found in INL fuel pools. Lab-scale experiments were conducted by applying fourteen different commercial underwater coatings to four substrate materials representative of the storage basin construction materials, and evaluating their performance. The coupons included bare concrete, epoxy painted concrete, epoxy painted carbon steel, and stainless steel. The evaluation criteria included ease of application, adherence to the four surfaces of interest, no change on water clarity or chemistry, non-hazardous in final applied form and be proven in underwater applications. A proprietary two-part, underwater epoxy owned by S. G. Pinney and Associates was selected from the underwater coatings tested for application to all four pools. Divers scrubbed loose contamination off the basin walls and floors using a ship hull scrubber and vacuumed up the sludge. The divers then applied the coating using a special powered roller with two separate <b>heated</b> <b>hoses</b> that allowed the epoxy to mix at the roller surface was used to eliminate pot time concerns. The walls were successfully coated and water was removed from the pools with no detectable airborne contamination releases...|$|R
50|$|Solar Shower: The {{immediate}} {{project is}} a shower. A tank {{of water on the}} roof uses solar energy to heat the water inside. The tank is painted black to maximize heat absorption, has reflectors aimed at it to increase heat absorption, and is shrink wrapped to preserve the <b>heat.</b> A garden <b>hose</b> hooked to it pours the water down into a wood and fiberglass structure. The gray water is then piped out of the box and into a bucket. Water is pulled up by a bicycle pulley to the roof.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} pictures illustrate {{an example}} of a successful fire test that led to a UL listing or a three-hour fire protection rating. The entire assembly is exposed to a fire for the specified amount of time per the objective of the test. Following this <b>heat</b> exposure, a <b>hose</b> stream is applied to the door. Fire doors and fire dampers are derated from the fire barriers they are in. In this case, a 3-hour rated door is acceptable for use in up to a 4-hour wall. Because it goes into a 4-hour wall, it received a 45PSI (31N/cm²) hose stream test.|$|R
40|$|The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) is deactivating several fuel storage basins. Airborne {{contamination}} is {{a concern}} when {{the sides of the}} basins are exposed and allowed to dry during water removal. One way of controlling this airborne contamination is to fix the contamination in place while the pool walls are still submerged. There are many underwater coatings available on the market that are used in marine, naval and other applications. A series of tests were run to determine whether the candidate underwater fixatives are easily applied and adhere well to the substrates (pool wall materials) found in INEEL fuel pools. The four pools considered included 1) Test Area North (TAN- 607) with epoxy painted concrete walls; 2) Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC) (CPP- 603) with bare concrete walls; 3) Materials Test Reactor (MTR) Canal with stainless steel lined concrete walls; and 4) Power Burst Facility (PBF- 620) with stainless steel lined concrete walls on the bottom and epoxy painted carbon steel lined walls on the upper portions. Therefore, the four materials chosen for testing included bare concrete, epoxy painted concrete, epoxy painted carbon steel, and stainless steel. The typical water temperature of the pools varies from 55 oF to 80 oF dependent on the pool and the season. These tests were done at room temperature. The following criteria were used during this evaluation. The underwater coating must: · Be easy to apply · Adhere well to the four surfaces of interest · Not change or {{have a negative impact on}} water chemistry or clarity · Not be hazardous in final applied form · Be proven in other underwater applications. In addition, it is desirable for the coating to have a high pigment or high cross-link density to prevent radiation from penetrating. This paper will detail the testing completed and the test results. A proprietary two-part, underwater epoxy owned by S. G. Pinney and Associates was selected to be applied by divers after scrubbing loose contamination off the basin walls and floors using a ship hull scrubber and vacuuming up the sludge. A special powered roller with two separate <b>heated</b> <b>hoses</b> that allowed the epoxy to mix at the roller surface was used to eliminate pot time concerns.

50|$|Hot water {{extraction}} equipment {{may be a}} portable unit that plugs into an electrical outlet, or a truck mount carpet cleaner requiring long hoses from the truck or trailer. Truck mounted equipment may be used where electricity is unavailable (e.g. if electrical service was terminated). Truck mount carpet cleaning may be unsuited to premises distant from a driveway or road, and hoses may need to pass through windows to reach upper floors of a building. Hoses needed for truck mount and professional portable carpet cleaning may present an inconvenience or tripping hazard to users of hallways, and pets or children can escape through doors that must be left ajar for <b>hoses.</b> <b>Heated</b> or air conditioned air will also escape from buildings when doors are left open for hoses, potentially creating a significant waste of energy. Truck mounted carpet cleaning equipment minimizes noise in the room being cleaned, but may cause noise and air pollution offensive to neighbors, and may violate anti-idling bylaws in some jurisdictions. However, truck-mounted cleaning is much faster than portable equipment, and the extra heat will dissolve more spots and stains, and more vacuum suction power will reduce drying times.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{manufacturers}} {{recommend that}} the end user perform daily and weekly maintenance. Units must be checked regularly for wear and tear and kept clean. Poorly connected, worn or frayed electrical connections may present a shock or fire hazard; worn hoses and masks may reduce {{the effectiveness of the}} unit. Most units employ some type of filtration, and the filters must be cleaned or replaced on a regular schedule. Sometimes HEPA filters may be purchased or modified for asthma or other allergy clients. Hoses and masks accumulate exfoliated skin, particulate matter, and can even develop mold. Humidification units must be kept free of mold and algae. Because units use substantial electrical power, housings must be cleaned without immersion. For humidification units, cleaning of the water container is imperative for several reasons. First, the container may build up minerals from the local water supply which eventually may be become part of the air breathed. Second, the container may eventually show signs of [...] "sluge" [...] coming from dust and other particles which make their way through the air filter which must also be changed as it accumulates dirt. To help clean the unit, some patients have used a very small amount of hydrogen peroxide mixed with the water in the container. They would then let it stand for a few minutes before emptying and rinsing. If this procedure is used, it is imperative to rinse the unit with soap and water before reinstalling onto the machine and breathing. Anti-bacterial soap is not recommended by sellers. To reduce the risk of contamination, distilled water is a good alternative to tap water. If traveling in areas where the mineral content or purity of the water is unknown or suspect, an alternative is to use a water [...] "purifier" [...] such as Brita. In cold climates, humidified air may require insulated and/or <b>heated</b> air <b>hoses.</b> These may be bought ready-made, or modified from commonly available materials.|$|R
