5|$|A {{resolution}} to this apparent inconsistency <b>is</b> <b>offered</b> <b>by</b> inflationary theory {{in which a}} homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the universe at some very early period (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the universe undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle horizon expands much more rapidly than previously assumed, so that regions presently {{on opposite sides of}} the observable universe are well inside each other's particle horizon. The observed isotropy of the CMB then follows from the fact that this larger region was in causal contact before the beginning of inflation.|$|E

5|$|In June 1139 {{a knight}} was killed during {{a fight in}} Oxford between a party of Roger of Salisbury's men {{and a group of}} noblemen. The king ordered Roger to attend his court to explain the {{circumstances}} of the incident and to surrender custody of his castles, which Roger refused to do, resulting in his and Alexander's arrest; Roger's other nephew, Nigel, evaded capture. Another possible explanation for the arrests <b>is</b> <b>offered</b> <b>by</b> the Gesta Stephani, a contemporary chronicle, which reported the king's fear that Roger and his nephews were plotting to hand their castles to the Empress Matilda. Stephen may alternatively have been attempting to assert his rights over the castles, and demonstrate his authority over powerful subjects. Alexander was imprisoned in Oxford, in conditions described by some medieval chroniclers as bad.|$|E
5|$|The Augustinian theodicy {{supports}} {{the notion of}} original sin. All versions of this theodicy accept the theological implications of the Genesis creation narrative, including the belief that God created human beings without sin or suffering. Evil {{is believed to be}} a just punishment for the fall of man: when Adam and Eve first disobeyed God and were exiled from the Garden of Eden. The free will of humans <b>is</b> <b>offered</b> <b>by</b> the Augustinian theodicy as the continued reason for moral evil: people commit immoral acts when their will is evil. The evil nature of human will is attributed to original sin; Augustinian theologians argue that the sin of Adam and Eve corrupted the will of human beings, maintaining that God is blameless and good, and not himself responsible for evil.|$|E
