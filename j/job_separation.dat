50|$|Printer Job Language (PJL) is {{a method}} {{developed}} by Hewlett-Packard for switching printer languages at the job level, and for status readback between the printer and the host computer. PJL adds job level controls, such as printer language switching, <b>job</b> <b>separation,</b> environment, status readback, device attendance and file system commands. While PJL was conceived as an extension to Printer Command Language (PCL), it is now supported by most PostScript printers. Many printer vendors have extended PJL to include commands proprietary to their products. Not all PJL commands documented by HP are implemented in all HP or other vendor products. PJL resides above all the other printer languages and parses commands first. The syntax mainly uses plain English words.|$|E

We relate long histories of their earnings forecasts to <b>job</b> <b>separations.</b> We find that relatively accurate past forecasts lead to favorable career outcomes such as remaining at or {{moving up to}} a high status (large, prestigious) brokerage house. Controlling for accuracy, optimistic forecasts relative to the consensus increase the chances of favorable <b>job</b> <b>separations.</b> <b>Job</b> <b>separations</b> depend much less on accuracy for analysts who cover stocks that are underwritten by their brokerage houses.

Furthermore, <b>job</b> <b>separations</b> were much less sensitive to accuracy and somewhat more sensitive to optimism during the stock market mania of the late 1990 s. These findings suggest that the well-documented analyst forecast optimism bias is likely due to incentives to promote stocks. ______________________________ We thank I/B/E/S for making their data available for academic use.

Monopsony theory suggests {{a link between the}} wage elasticity of labor supply and wage penalties. Should one group of workers be less elastic in their supply choices, that group is predicted to earn less than others. To measure wage elasticity, I estimate a hazard model on voluntary <b>job</b> <b>separations</b> using the RAIS, a linked employer-employee dataset that captures formal-sector workers’ job durations over time. Four models are specified and point to significant gender differences. Across the models, male elasticity ranges from 1.638 to 2.175 while female elasticity ranges from 1.22 to 1.502. The female wage penalty predicted by these elasticity differences ranges from 11.4 to 20.5 %, compared to an actual gender wage difference of 16.4 %. Results of higher male elasticity are robust to the use of a more parsimonious specification, a discrete-time approach, the use of job spell data for a single year, and disaggregation by region. I extend the model through decomposition methods to help clarify the association between earnings, <b>job</b> <b>separations,</b> and elasticity.|$|R

I find no evidence of an added worker effect among either men or women. Neither increases employment or labor market attachment in the year following a household job sep-aration. Instead, households rely on pension income, spending down assets and obtaining loans and credit. Households are {{no more likely to}} change composition following a <b>job</b> <b>separation</b> unless they contain a pension-eligible member.

Estimation results using job tenure data from the NLSY support the humped shaped pattern in <b>job</b> <b>separation</b> rates and favor this model above the learning model. When assuming a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) separation rule, this model of individual employment relations is embedded in a model of firm level employment, that satisfies Gibrat’s law.

The qualitative part draws on interviews with individuals who had left their firm.

But they also show that it is quite impossible to disentangle, in such contexts, whether the termination is voluntary (resignation) or involuntary (dismissal).
