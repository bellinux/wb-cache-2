40|$|In {{the context}} of a study on {{perceptions}} of justice among victims and offenders encountering the Belgian criminal justice system, 54 victims and offenders were interviewed about their experience with victim-offender mediation. In this article, we describe the factors that influenced these victims’ and offenders’ experiences with mediation and as such determined their satisfaction with mediation. In doing so, we pay explicit attention to the theoretical basis of these factors. Impact research on participation in restorative <b>justice</b> <b>programmes</b> is often limited to quantitatively mapping client satisfaction; in this article we wish to provide an impetus to the theoretical explanation of these quantitative findings. Relating the findings resulting from the in-depth interviews to the theoretical framework of procedural justice, we shed a light on the psychological processes that motivate expressions of (dis) satisfaction with restorative <b>justice</b> <b>programmes.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

The following issues are considered: the organisational status of projects, funding, systems of referral, resistance {{to the creation of}} programmes, relationship with women's refuge organisations and theoretical and ideological orientations. The findings suggest some resistance has been experienced, most importantly from probation officers and women's groups. The programmes are predominantly cognitive-behavioural in orientation and around half of all projects take men as part of a court order.

5000|$|Though Taylor had {{rejected}} complicity {{on any of}} the charges, the court said that he ordered and supported the RUF, while the prosecution said that RUF's undermining of a 1999 ceasefire prolonged the war and was financed by Taylor through the proceeds of illegally mined [...] "blood diamonds." [...] In reaction to the verdict, Richard Dekker, the head of the international <b>justice</b> <b>programme</b> at Human Rights Watch said: [...] "The Taylor verdict is a watershed moment, however it turns out. As president, Taylor {{is believed to have been}} responsible for so much murder and mayhem which unfolded in Sierra Leone. His was a shadow that loomed across the region". Christine Cheng of Exeter College, Oxford pointed to the politicisation of the trial and the degree to which the trial has been funded by Western states, though she added that the conclusion of Taylor's trial represented a [...] "milestone for the pursuit of international justice." [...] The prosecutor Brenda J. Hollis reacted to the verdict in saying:Today is for the people of Sierra Leone who suffered horribly because of Charles Taylor. This judgment brings some measure of justice to the many thousands of victims who paid a terrible price for Mr. Taylor’s crimes. Today’s historic judgment reinforces the new reality, that Heads of State will be held to account for war crimes and other international crimes. This judgment affirms that with leadership comes not just power and authority, but also responsibility and accountability. No person, no matter how powerful, is above the law. The judges found that Mr. Taylor aided and abetted the crimes charged in counts 1 through 11, and that he planned with Sam Bockarie the attacks on Kono, Makeni and Freetown in late 1998 and January 1999 during which the charged crimes were committed. The Trial Chamber’s findings made clear the central role Charles Taylor played in the horrific crimes against the people of Sierra Leone. Mr. Taylor’s conviction for murder acknowledges the thousands who were brutally killed. These men, women and children were violently taken from their family and friends, and many were killed in remote locations known only to their killers. Victims’ families were left destitute, with emotional wounds that will never heal.|$|E
40|$|There {{is little}} written on Restorative Justice in {{custodial}} settings. The present research constitutes {{a compilation of}} articles that aim to explore the applicability of restorative justice in prisons, and therefore fill the conceptual gap between the notion of imprisonment and that of restoration. Initially, this study creates a conceptual framework for restorative justice employing both historical and religious sources. More specifically, it seeks to (re) discover the historical roots of restorative justice {{as an attempt to}} settle long-lived disputations concerning its origin. Bearing in mind the results derived from the historical review, criticisms are raised based on conceptual and operational barriers prior to envisaging and providing suggestions {{for the construction of a}} ‘restorative prison’. In parallel, it is explained how and why some of the core elements of restorative justice (such as forgiveness, reintegration, and reconciliation) are compatible with religion (in our case, with Christianity) revealing the contribution of religion to the promotion of restorative justice. This part of our research reports findings from qualitative inquiries (interviews and participatory observation) referring to the restorative <b>justice</b> <b>programmes</b> developed by faith-based organizations in penitentiaries in New Zealand and in South Africa. On a theoretical level, the present thesis discusses the compatibility, as well as the barriers, between imprisonment and restorative justice focusing on how the latter could be overcome. Ultimately, the answers given here serve as a stepping-stone for measuring the capacity of a prison to progress in restorative justice matters. The methodological part is consisted of quantitative tools (questionnaires) addressed to prisoners held in several prisons across Belgium, evaluating their perceptions on the impact of crime on their victims, their possible openness or willingness to engaging in restorative activities, their relationships with the victim and the community, and the possible impact of religion on the implementation of restorative <b>justice</b> <b>programmes...</b>|$|R
