50|$|Edwin Loder {{organized}} a company, Loders Lime, {{to take over}} lime kilns already in operation at the community of Kananaskis, approximately 3 km east of Exshaw. Due {{to the need for}} more capital a new company was incorporated in 1906 and a new plant completed by 1908. A peak on <b>Door</b> <b>Jam</b> Mountain, above the hamlet and plant, is named after him. The Loder name is still connected with the area.|$|E
5000|$|Cam Winston (Brian Stokes Mitchell) is the deep-voiced tenant of the {{apartment}} above Frasier's and is Frasier's rival. The two frequently clash and compete over parking spaces, apartment board placement, and balcony rights. For all their rivalry, the two have near-identical tastes, mannerisms, and personalities, which prompt competitiveness between them. The two {{have a history of}} trumping each other tit-for-tat via {{the apartment}} board: while Frasier convinces the board to ban Cam from parking his Humvee in the provided garage, Cam, in passive protest, hangs an enormous American flag over Frasier's balcony, covering Frasier's view; as well as the obvious inconvenience, this incident also damages Frasier's standing with the board, as when he protests about the flag, Cam twists matters so as to make Frasier seem unpatriotic. When their parents feign a dating relationship to have the two come to a truce, Cam and Frasier finally end their feud and compromise with each other to please their parents. Martin and Cam's mother do eventually form a short lived relationship. Cam is exploited in the 10th-season episode, <b>Door</b> <b>Jam,</b> when Frasier finds an exclusive luxury spa invitation addressed to Cam in his own mail box due to their mail box exchange as a condition of their truce. Intrigued, Frasier and Niles go to the spa, but find that they are not on the [...] "list", prompting Niles to impersonate Cam's vocal characteristics in the charade, to get access into the spa.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{effectiveness}} of expedient protection strategies to reduce exposure to vapors from chemical warfare agents. This includes an examination of the physical and the psychological effectiveness of measures such as using a wet towel to seal a <b>door</b> <b>jam</b> against the infiltration of chemicals while sheltering in place or to provide expedient respiratory protection. Respiratory protection for civilians has never been considered a viable option for population protection in the CSEPP. Problems of storage, ability to effectively don respirators, and questionable fit have been primary factors in rejecting this option. Expedient respiratory protection seems to offer little benefits for population protection for chemical agent vapors. Furthermore, using wet towels as a vapor barrier at the bottom of a door should be discouraged. The wetted towel provides no vapor filtration and its effectiveness in infiltration reduction is unknown. Taping the bottom of the door will still likely provide greater infiltration reduction and is recommended as the current method for use in sheltering...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} is a checklist to determine the fire rating of a wall before any penetration is made through the wall. Please fill in any blanks below to determine the fire-rating {{and to ensure that}} any penetration is correctly protected. The back side of this sheet contains applicable code sections to help answer questions and fill in blanks. YES NO 1. Is there a fire rated door on the wall? (A fire rated door will usually have a label {{on the end of the}} door showing the fire-rating or a sticker near the door handles stating “BY ORDER OF THE FIRE MARSHAL THIS DOOR MUST REMAIN SHUT AT ALL TIMES”. Another indication is that the door may be on a magnetic holder. Also, check to see if there is glass in the door and if the glass is fire rated, i. e., wired glass) 2. Is there a fire rating on any doors along the assembly? (The rating is located on the hinge side of the <b>door</b> <b>jam</b> and the rating of the assembly is usually more than the door rating) Door rating is _______ minutes. * 3. Are there any fire/smoke dampers present along the assembly? * 4. Are there walls that extend to the structure or ceiling with 1 inch sheet rock? * 5. For all new buildings refer to the Construction Drawings for the location and type of fire-rate...|$|E

25|$|Harry and Kay Robinson {{purchased}} a new Audi 100 LS automobile from Seaway Volkswagen, Inc. in Massena, New York, in 1976. The following year, as Kay Robinson passed through Oklahoma on Interstate 44 {{en route to}} the Robinsons' new home in Arizona, the Audi was struck from the rear by a drunk driver in a 1971 Ford Torino. The impact of the collision itself did not directly injure any of the Robinsons, but the crash resulted in the Audi's <b>doors</b> <b>jamming</b> shut and a puncture in the car's gas tank. A fire then severely burned the trapped Kay Robinson and her two children riding in the Audi, Eva and Sam.|$|R
5000|$|By {{disrupting the}} {{electrical}} fields of machinery, Phantazia could short them out completely, or control them to some degree; opening computer-locked <b>doors,</b> <b>jamming</b> weapon and targeting systems, etc. Phantazia {{was able to}} disrupt the bioelectric energy fields and nervous systems of other living beings as well, resulting in pain, paralysis, loss of physical coordination, {{and in the case}} of superhumans, the inability to control their powers, causing them to fluctuate in strength, cease functioning altogether, or spew out uncontrollably. She has, for example, disrupted the blast field of Cannonball, making him vulnerable, and also caused the superhero Sleepwalker to temporarily lose control of his reality-warping ability.|$|R
50|$|The main <b>door</b> became <b>jammed</b> {{with a pile}} of {{approximately}} 200 women and children, which made it impassable. Eventually the side doors were also opened, but they also became jammed. Rescuers were able to pull about 50 people from these heaps, but no more.|$|R

50|$|Many patrons {{attempted}} to exit {{through the main}} entrance, {{the same way they}} had entered. The building's main entrance was a single revolving door, which was rendered useless as the crowd stampeded in panic. Bodies piled up behind both sides of the revolving <b>door,</b> <b>jamming</b> it until it broke. But then the oxygen-hungry fire leaped through the breach, incinerating whoever was left alive in the pile. Firemen had to douse the flames to approach the door. Later, after fire laws had tightened, it would become illegal to have only one revolving door as a main entrance without being flanked by outward opening doors with panic bar openers attached, or have the revolving doors set up so that the doors could fold against themselves in emergency situations.|$|R
50|$|When the 1984/86 {{fleet of}} ICTS cars were introduced, floors were carpet-lined, {{intended}} {{as a way to}} showcase SkyTrain as an elegant world class system. However, as maintaining the carpets proved difficult and sanitation issues quickly became a concern, they were replaced with wax flooring in the mid-1992. The Expo fleet of trains also initially equipped with passenger-initiated door buttons, meaning that individual door sets only opened at the push of a button when passengers wished to get on or off at a particular station. The buttons were removed between 1989 and 1991, {{due in large part to}} passenger confusion as to how to properly use the buttons as well as <b>doors</b> <b>jamming,</b> thus leading to the issue of frequent system-wide or area-specific delays.|$|R
500|$|The ship {{remained}} on the station until late August 1939, when the imminent start of the Second World War caused the Admiralty to order her to take up her war station with the Mediterranean Fleet at Malta. Duchess arrived there on 12 October and remained in the Mediterranean {{for the next two}} months. In December the ship, along with her sisters , [...] and , was assigned to escort the battleship HMS Barham back to the UK, and they departed Gibraltar on 6 December. During the morning of 12 December, Barham collided with Duchess off the Mull of Kintyre in heavy fog. The destroyer capsized and her depth charges exploded, killing 124 of her crew including her commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Robin White, who was stuck in his sea cabin when the sliding <b>door</b> <b>jammed.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{the final}} phase of the action against Bismarck, Rodney fired two 24.5 in torpedoes from her port-side tube and claimed one hit. According to Ludovic Kennedy, [...] "if true, is the only {{instance}} in history of one battleship torpedoing another". [...] Earlier in this same action the starboard side tube had its sluice <b>door</b> <b>jammed</b> {{as the result of a}} near miss from one of Bismarcks early salvos. On 27 September 1941, Nelsons port torpedo station almost proved to be a liability when an Italian air-launched 18-inch torpedo holed the compartment behind the torpedo body room, allowing 3,750 tons of water to enter the ship. Following this Nelsons torpedo tubes may have been removed although another source suggests the torpedo tubes were retained in both ships into 1945.|$|R
50|$|Another {{method is}} to use a {{doorstop}} which is a small wedge of wood, rubber, plastic, cotton or another material. Manufactured wedges of these materials are commonly available. The wedge is kicked into position and the downward force of the <b>door,</b> now <b>jammed</b> upwards onto the doorstop, provides enough static friction to keep it motionless.|$|R

5000|$|A {{writer for}} Spin said [...] "The Hyundai-sponsored {{collaboration}} [...] "Breakn' a Sweat" [...] (for the documentary RE:GENERATION), which features the three surviving {{members of the}} <b>Doors</b> <b>jamming</b> over a Skrillex beat, and is literally the sound of generations colliding, awkwardly if sort of admirably, but still... It's {{supposed to be a}} reworking of Miles Davis' 1958 modal-jazz classic [...] "Milestones." [...] See if you can tell. (Hint: You can't.)". Dan LeRoy from Alternative Press gave the song a negative review, saying [...] "If you want to complain, listen to “Breakn’ A Sweat,” a collaboration with what remains of the Doors that’s less dubstep than ghastly misstep. (The faux-rap interjections force you to imagine MC Hammer having his way with “Light My Fire” back in the day.) And whoever authorized the soundbite from a vintage Jim Morrison interview in order to give this track his posthumous imprimatur ought to be worried about his vengeful ghost".|$|R

50|$|Pont-Aven {{experienced}} {{a number of}} technical problems in her first year of service. Most serious was the flooding of an auxiliary engine room in August 2004 caused by a faulty sea valve leaving the ferry unable {{to move from the}} Plymouth terminal for two days. Many services were disrupted {{at the height of the}} holiday season, many passengers having to be transferred to services from Poole and Portsmouth. Interestingly, the problem occurred at the same time as a major breakdown on the Irish Ferries vessel M/V Normandy, which serves on the Rosslare - Cherbourg route. This situation left no passenger ferry link between Ireland and France and as a result many holidaymakers were forced to use the so-called Land-Bridge route, travelling from Ireland to Wales by ferry and driving to Plymouth or Portsmouth to board a ferry for France, or vice versa. Other problems included the bow <b>door</b> <b>jamming</b> shut and the unusual roll when travelling at high speed even in calm weather. However most faults have now been corrected and the vessel has become a popular member of the Brittany Ferries fleet.|$|R

The following day, [...] spotted the British ships of Force Z, the battleship [...] and the battlecruiser , escorted by four destroyers, headed north-northwest. Shortly after midnight on 10 December, 140 mi east of Kuantan, Malaya, I-58 was running on the surface when her lookouts spotted Force Z 600 meters (656 yards) away. After crash diving, Lieutenant Commander Kitamura attempts to fire a full six-torpedo salvo at Prince of Wales in the lead, but his first torpedo tube's outer <b>door</b> <b>jams.</b> Kitamura fires his five available torpedoes at Repulse, but misses. He reported that Force Z proceeding south-southwest at 24 kn and continues to track the British ships. The report was received by the light cruiser [...] which relayed it to Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa's flagship, the heavy cruiser [...] At 06:15, I-58 lost contact with Force Z. That afternoon, both British capital ships were sunk by torpedo bombers of the 22nd Air Flotilla from bases in French Indochina.|$|R

25|$|The {{structure}} was {{built out of}} coral stone on a high bluff overlooking the Indian Ocean. It consists of three major elements: a south court, used primarily for commerce; a residential complex including over one hundred individual rooms; and a wide stairway leading down a mosque that was situated on the beach. Other notable features include pavilion, which likely served as a reception hall, and an octagonal swimming pool. All of Husuni Kubwa spans across approximately two acres. The coral rag was set in limestone mortar and cut stone was used for decorative pieces, <b>door</b> <b>jams,</b> and vaults. The rooms were about 3 meters tall. The roof was made from cut limestone blocks laid across cut timbers and the floors were white plaster. The main entrance to Husuni Kubwa is from the shore. Most of the imported glazed pottery recovered at the site was Chinese celadon, though {{there were a few}} Ying Ch'ing stoneware sherds present. A Yuan dynasty flask dated to about A.D. 1300.

50|$|But {{things started}} to take a {{different}} course. The lead actress Mehr Hassan was locked inside the hotel room when the room <b>door</b> <b>jammed.</b> A mechanic had to be brought in to cut the lock and rescue the beautiful actress. She was totally freaked out since the lock was working perfectly fine just until the incident. The next day screenwriter, Sandeep Singh was discovered lying in front of the vending machine just after mid night. Emergency crews responded quickly and were able to revive him in few hours. He told the paramedics that he was just walking to vending machine to grab a bite when something punched him head on. He could not describe more than that. The special effects supervisor, Richard Miranda also experienced some strange presence in his room and he slept in his car {{for the duration of the}} shoot. Shooting was halted when most crew members threatened to quit. Param Gill changed the filming schedule. Rest of the filming was done in the day time by blocking out the doors and windows of hotel with sheets of black plastic. Security guards were hired to man the empty corridors.|$|R

5000|$|The {{interior}} of the Lenhart Farmhouse is a perfectly symmetrical Federal [...] "I" [...] House design with a central three-story walnut staircase and balustrade from the first floor to the attic. The east, west and ell room interior dimensions are 15 by 18 ft. Typical finishes include plaster and simple woodwork. Chair rails are found throughout the first floor [...] "I" [...] House rooms. The ash floorboards are of irregular widths from 4 to 8 inches wide. The walnut mopboards and quarter round are simply stated finishes to the plank floors. The interior doors {{on the first floor}} are three-panel walnut, and the exterior doors are two-panel poplar structurally designed with wooden pegs. All <b>door</b> <b>jams</b> and trim are poplar. The east fireplace is intact, with a large unadorned walnut mantle with only simple moldings. The west fireplace has been bricked and plastered over; none of the mantle remains. From evidence of the craftsmanship and plaster, it is conjecture by the author that the east fireplace was covered {{at the time of the}} c. 1925 enclosure of the porch.
