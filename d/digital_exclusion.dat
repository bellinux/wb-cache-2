40|$|This {{report was}} {{commissioned}} by the Department for Communities and Local Government. Research on the links between the diffusion of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and social and economic development has been undertaken for decades. Evidence of links between social and digital engagement, {{particularly with respect to}} the Internet, {{has been the focus of}} many studies conducted by academic as well as government institutions. These studies have shown consistently that individuals who have access to ICTs, from the telephone to the Internet, tend to have more schooling, higher incomes, and higher status occupations than do those who do not have access. This holds true within nations as well as cross-nationally, as evidenced by results from the World Internet Project However, despite the evidence, there remains significant debate around the existence, nature and causality of these links. This study has tackled these issues and developed new models of <b>digital</b> and social <b>exclusion.</b> It offers a robust analytic framework that is applicable to different survey datasets and can be adapted to new and emerging technologies.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{contribution}} {{is to provide a}} survey of the economic impact of digitalization processes in the economy and society at large (e-Inclusion). The following three main bodies of literature have been selected and reviewed: The first one is the very rich literature on digital divide/inclusion (section 7. 1). Although the latter investigates the causes (rather than the economic effects) of the processes of <b>digital</b> inclusion (or <b>exclusion)</b> it nonetheless provides several hints and useful indications for a better understanding of both the e-Inclusion phenomenon and (indirectly) its potential economic impact. Section 7. 2 reviews the standard econometric literature assessing the economic impact of ICT picking up those contributions which have (explicitly or implicitly) taken into account phenomena and variables related to e-Inclusion processes and their final economic effects. This is particular the case of the micro-economic literature exploring the impact of ICT on employability and wages and the most recent empirical attempt assessing the economic impact of broadband and internet.

40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} {{different aspects}} of the digital divide concept. As a consequence of increasingly widespread internet penetration, the debate related to the digital divide has shifted from a first to a second level divide concept. In the theoretical section of this chapter both of these divide concepts are briefly characterized according to their core aspects, the research indicators adopted and the main results of digital divide research: in short, while both of these concepts try to generalize barriers for internet use and abilities, differences lie in the indicators analysed. Furthermore, this paper includes the aspect of national socio-cultural contexts in the discussion. Based on the examples provided by the three participating countries, different patterns in the first and second level digital divide are highlighted to show how – with the growing complexity of societies – the transformations taking place in <b>digital</b> inclusion or <b>exclusion</b> can differ significantly in different national contexts. In order to do this, the dimensions of the digital divide and its connections with other social and cultural dimensions were analysed in Austria, Estonia and Italy. One dividing line for each country will be discussed, bearing in mind that these dividing lines are more or less typical to each national example, but could probably be identified in other countries too...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} how <b>digital</b> <b>exclusion</b> {{continues to}} present a serious and significant threat to the successful establishment of developed and developing countries as ‘information societies’. Based on a review of recent research and theoretical work, the chapter considers {{a number of different}} reasons why <b>digital</b> <b>exclusion</b> remains a complex and entrenched social problem - highlighting the need to recognise the mediating role of economic, cultural and social forms of capital in shaping individuals’ engagements with ICT. From this basis, the chapter proposes a hierarchical framework of <b>digital</b> <b>exclusion</b> based around conceptual ‘stages’ of ICT use. Using this framework, the argument is made that policy makers, technologists and other information society stakeholders face a considerable challenge to match the social affordances of ICTs with the everyday needs, interests and desires of individuals. In this sense <b>digital</b> <b>exclusion</b> continues to demand a complex set of policy responses which go far beyond simply increasing levels of hardware provision and support, and then assuming any ‘gaps’ to have been ‘bridged’.

40|$|Colleges and {{universities}} {{of all types}} and sizes offer online courses to meet student demand, reduce teaching costs, and increase enrollments (Allen & Seaman, 2011). By 2011, thirty-one percent of all postsecondary students were enrolled {{in at least one}} online course (Allen & Seaman, 2011). Though {{growth in the number of}} online offerings has been dramatic in recent years, empirical evidence does not consistently support many of its intended benefits. The target audience for these courses is frequently students who are non-traditional in some way, either due to age, employment or parental status, military service, or other factors (Bacow, Bowen, Guthrie, Lack, & Long, 2012), the same groups of students that community colleges serve (Bragg, 2011). Because community colleges are rapidly adding new online offerings to meet perceived demand (Mullin, 2010) many questions about the impact of online education on community college students arise. The present study examines for-credit, online course taking behavior among community college students. The data come from the Pearson Foundation Community College Student Survey 2011. Most previous studies focus on retention and success rates among online course takers and highlight differences based on distal characteristics such as race, gender, age, and academic ability (Jaggars, 2011). Because online course taking is an increasingly common element of the higher education experience, it is important to develop a holistic understanding of students who take courses online. Using the emerging conceptual framework of <b>digital</b> choice and <b>exclusion</b> as a guide (Eynon & Helsper, 2010), we aim to move beyond basic demographics and paint a more nuanced picture of who online students are, and why they have chosen to take classes online.

40|$|The rapid {{diffusion}} of the Internet has considerable potential for enhancing {{the way people}} connect with each other, the root of social capital. However, the more the Internet is used for building social capital the greater will the impact be on those whose access and/or usage is curtailed. It is therefore important to investigate the impacts of Internet on groups at risk of <b>digital</b> and social <b>exclusion.</b> The aim {{of this article is}} to examine how the use of the Internet influences social capital and community building in a disadvantaged area. Quantitative and qualitative data from a case study in a suburban area of Stockholm are used to evaluate the social impacts of two community-based Internet projects: a Local Net and an IT-Caf�. Each of the projects was aimed at enhancing digital inclusion and social capital in a disadvantaged local community. The paper examines the extent to which use of the Internet is associated with an enhancement of social participation, social trust and local identity in the area. The Local Net appears to have had limited success in meeting its goals; the IT-Caf� was more successful. Visitors to the IT-Caf� had more local friends, expressed less social distrust, perceived less tension between different groups in the area and felt a much stronger sense of local identity than non-visitors. Visitors praised the IT-Caf� as providing a meeting-place both online and offline. The Internet was used for networking, exchange of support and information seeking. Although it is difficult to establish causal priorities, the evidence suggests that an IT-Caf�, supporting both virtual and physical meetings, may be especially well suited to build social capital and a sense of local community in a disadvantaged area. The importance of social, rather than solely technological, factors in determining the impact of the Internet on social capital in disadvantaged local communities is stressed.

40|$|AbstractThe {{integration}} and adoption of digital technologies have enabled {{improvements in the}} quality of and inclusion in higher education. However, a significant proportion of the population has either remained or become digitally excluded. This systematic literature review elucidates the factors underlying the concepts of “digital exclusion” and the “digital divide” in higher education. The identified factors are grouped into three categories: social exclusion (i. e., low income, ICT-avoidance as the norm, lack of motivation and commitment, and physical or mental disability), <b>digital</b> <b>exclusion</b> (i. e., lack of hardware devices and Internet services) and accessibility (which include the division between rural and urban areas, as well as disparities in ICT literacy and information literacy). These factors are multi-tiered and overlapping. Studies on the digital divide, <b>digital</b> <b>exclusion,</b> and barriers to ICT adoption in higher education deal with similar factors, but these are experienced differently in different contexts. While generalizing these factors into categories enables {{a better understanding of the}} nature of <b>digital</b> <b>exclusion,</b> solving and circumventing them remains complex due their dependency on the particular context of a higher education institution...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{importance of}} the Internet {{as a means of}} communication has transformed economies and societies. For spatially and socially marginalized communities, this transformation has resulted in <b>digital</b> <b>exclusion</b> and further marginalization. This book presents a study of two kinds of marginalized communities: spatially marginalized rural communities and socially marginalized Gypsy-Travelers. Mechanisms of both social exclusion and <b>digital</b> <b>exclusion</b> were studied to create {{a better understanding of how}} marginalized communities deal with ongoing digitalization. The interplay between citizens, governments, and market players is a recurring theme throughout the book.

Altogether, this study shows that the Internet is not an equalizer, as it was once assumed by academics and policy makers. Instead, unequal access to the Internet shows that ‘offline’ geographies still matter in the digital age. Ongoing developments around <b>digital</b> <b>exclusion</b> in the Netherlands, and in a broader perspective around the ‘participation society’, beg the question how much can be asked of communities and what should be a public task.

40|$|Abstract: Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{critique}} the discourse of the digital divide and to propose ways of responding to digital inequalities. Design/methodology/approach – Illustrations of arguments are based on reviews of academic literature, projects reports, policy documents and research findings from the Penceil project, and are informed by critical theory. The research consisted of 47 semi-structured interviews and action research involving designing an e-literacy curriculum and running a course based on it. Findings – A discourse of missed opportunities and “being left behind”, present in policy statements and popular media, leads to objectifying non-users of information and communication technologies (ICT) as “others”. This discourse is often internalised by non-users, but it does not necessarily lead to positive actions, leaving some feeling inadequate. So far initiatives seeking to address the digital divide have had moderate success. To respond to <b>digital</b> <b>exclusion</b> we need to oppose the unchecked spread of e-services, and help non-users of ICT to become users or (if they choose to) informed “refusniks”. Initiatives aiming to facilitate people's sustainable and meaningful use of ICT ought to draw on individual and community resources. A curriculum should be determined by learners' experiences and their expressions of needs, and go beyond IT skills. Research limitations/implications – The paper does not offer a comprehensive review of <b>digital</b> <b>exclusion,</b> concentrating instead on chosen problems and arguments. It is based on the UK experience, and thus more relevant to developed rather than developing countries. Practical implications – The paper raises awareness of different issues related to <b>digital</b> <b>exclusion</b> and ways of addressing them. Originality/value – The paper calls to question current discourse and initiatives addressing the digital divide, highlighting their limitations. It presents alternative ways of responding to <b>digital</b> <b>exclusion...</b>|$|E
