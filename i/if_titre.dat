40|$|Cerebral {{toxoplasmosis}} is {{the most}} common cerebral mass lesion in AIDS patients in Brazil, and results in high mortality and morbidity, despite free access to HAART (highly active antiretroviral treatment). Molecular diagnosis based on conventional PCR (cnPCR) or real-time quantitative PCR (qrtPCR) has been indispensable for definitive diagnosis. We report here the evaluation of qrtPCR with blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from AIDS patients in Brazil. This prospective study was conducted for 2 years, analysing DNA samples extracted from 149 AIDS patients (98 blood and 51 CSF samples) with confirmed clinical and radiological diagnosis The laboratory diagnosis included cnPCR (with the B 22 /B 23 primer set) and indirect immunofluorescence (IF). For qrtPCR, two primer sets were simultaneously designed based on described genes and using a 6 -carboxyfluorescein dye-labelled TaqMan MGB (minor groove binder) probe One was Bug, which amplified a sequence from the B 1 gene The other was the RETg, which amplified a PCR product of the 529 bp sequence. The overall cnPCR and qrtPCR results were positive results were observed in 33. 6 % (50) patients The sensitivities were 98 % for cnPCR (B 22 /B 23), and 86 and 98 % for qrtPCR (B 1 Tg and RETg, respectively). Negative reactions were observed in 66 4 % patients. The specificities were 97 % for cnPCR and qrtPCR (B 1 Tg). and 88. 8 % for RETg These data show that RETg PCR is highly sensitive as it amplifies a repeat region with many copies; however, its specificity is lower than the other markers However, B 1 Tg PCR had good specificity, but lower sensitivity Among the patients, 20 had blood and CSF collected simultaneously Thus, their results permitted us to analyse and compare molecular, serological and clinical diagnosis for {{a better understanding of the}} different scenarios of laboratorial and clinical diagnosis. For nine patients with confirmed cerebral toxoplasmosis diagnosis, four scenarios were observed: (i) and (ii) negative molecular diagnosis for CSF and positive for blood with variable <b>IF</b> <b>titres</b> for the sera and CSF (negative or positive), (iii) positive molecular diagnosis with CSF and negative with blood, and (iv) positive molecular diagnosis in both samples. In the latter two situations, normally the <b>IF</b> <b>titres</b> in sera and CSF are variable. Other opportunistic infections were shown in 11 patients Despite the <b>IF</b> <b>titres</b> in sera and CSF being variable, all of them had negative molecular diagnosis for both samples qrtPCR allows for a rapid identification of Toxoplasma gondii DNA in patient samples; in a minority of cases discrepancies occur with the cnPCR.

40|$|From 2007 - 2010, {{during the}} recent Q fever {{epidemic}} in the Netherlands, over 4000 cases of acute Q fever were registered, which is an underestimation of {{the total amount of}} Coxiella burnetii infections due to a high amount of asymptomatic primary infections. In the literature it is stated that 1 - 5 % of patients develop chronic Q fever after acute Q fever. We demonstrated that the risk for development of chronic Q fever after a known acute Q fever episode is approximately 2. 5 % for all chronic Q fever cases, and 1. 5 % if limited to proven and probable chronic Q fever cases. We have also demonstrated that the majority of patients with chronic Q fever did not recall an acute Q fever episode. From the Dutch National Chronic Q Fever Database we identified 284 chronic Q fever patients of whom 151 (53. 7 %) had proven, 64 (22. 5 %) probable and 69 (24. 3 %) possible chronic Q fever. The majority of proven and probable chronic Q fever patients had a vascular focus of infection (56. 7 %), while endocarditis (34. 9 %) was less prevalent. We described that most patients who died of chronic Q fever-related complications, had a vascular focus of infection (79 %). Previously proposed risk factors for the development of chronic Q fever consist of pre-existing cardiac valvulopathy, vascular grafts and aneurysms, immunosuppression and pregnancy. Identified risk factors for chronic Q fever in this thesis were previous cardiac valvular surgery, vascular prosthesis, aneurysms, renal insufficiency, and increasing age. An association between immunosuppression and pregnancy, and chronic Q fever could not be confirmed in this study. A novel finding was the association between mild renal insufficiency and chronic Q fever. Increasing age also predisposed for the development of chronic Q fever. The diagnostic criteria of chronic Q fever have recently led to debate in the international literature. A positive C. burnetii PCR, in the absence of signs of acute Q fever, proves chronic Q fever, but this method has low sensitivity in blood. Until now, diagnosis of chronic Q fever relied mainly on serological examination. In this thesis, we have demonstrated that high phase I IgG titres have a high positive predictive value (PPV) to differentiate proven chronic Q fever from possible chronic Q fever, especially <b>if</b> <b>titres</b> exceed 1 : 4096. Nevertheless, sensitivity of high phase I IgG titres is low: 60 % in case of phase I IgG titres > 1 : 4096. In contrast, phase I IgG titres between 1 : 1024 and 1 : 4096 have high sensitivity (98 - 81 %), but a low PPV (62 - 77 %). These results emphasizes that serology is not a diagnostic tool on its own, but should be interpreted in relation with the clinical background. The diagnostic guideline of the Dutch Q fever Consensus Group combines PCR, serology, clinical data and radiological data. In this guideline, suspected chronic Q fever cases are divided in three groups in decreasing likelihood of chronic Q fever: proven, probable and possible. We have demonstrated that the guideline of the Dutch Q fever Consensus Group has better sensitivity and also takes more rare manifestations of chronic Q fever into accoun...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether IgE titres are associated with the severity of the reaction during a standardized egg challenge. We reviewed data obtained during oral challenge tests to egg performed between 2003 and 2005, and attributed a clinical score to the positive reactions. Serum specific IgE levels were analysed in relation with the severity of the reaction. We analysed data from 51 oral food challenges to egg, raw or cooked. Sixteen challenges (31 %) were negative and 35 (69 %) were positive of which 13 challenges (37 % of positive reactions) elicited a severe reaction. IgE levels in our patients ranged from undetectable to 14. 90 kU/l. We could determine a cut-off level of 8. 20 kU/l for a 90 % probability of clinical reactivity. IgE titres were statistically significantly different between the patients with absent, mild and moderate or severe reaction. Patients with negative challenge had IgE levels between 0. 35 and 6. 41 kU/l (median 1. 17), those with mild and moderate reaction had IgE levels ranging from 0. 35 to 14. 90 (median 2. 47) and patients with severe reactions had IgE between 1. 18 and 11. 00 (median 3. 70) (p = 0. 006).

50|$|Today, with {{serological}} testing (determination of coeliac disease specific antibodies in the blood) and duodenal biopsy with histological testing being available for diagnosing coeliac disease, patients with suspected coeliac disease are strongly advised to undergo both serological and biopsy testing before undertaking a gluten-free diet. People who present minor damage {{of the small}} intestine often have negative blood antibodies titers and many patients with coeliac disease are missed when duodenal biopsy is not performed. Serologic tests have high capacity to detect coeliac disease only in patients with total villous atrophy and have very low capacity to detect cases with partial villous atrophy or minor intestinal lesions with normal villi. Currently, gluten challenge is no longer required to confirm the diagnosis in patients with intestinal lesions compatible with coeliac disease and a positive response to a gluten-free diet. Nevertheless, in some cases, a gluten challenge with a subsequent biopsy {{may be useful to}} support the diagnosis, for example in people with a high suspicion for coeliac disease, without a biopsy confirmation, who have negative blood antibodies and are already on a gluten-free diet.

40|$|Pupal {{development}} is elicited {{early in the}} last larval instar of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta (Johannson), by a precise temporal and quantitative increase in the haemolymph titre of 20 -hydroxyecdysone. This increase in the titre {{is referred to as}} the pupal commitment peak, and it occurs once the titre of juvenile hormone (JH) has dropped. <b>If</b> the haemolymph <b>titre</b> of JH remains elevated at this time due to topical application of the hormone or of its analogue ZR 512, commitment is delayed or inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. This delay or inhibition is due to the curtailment of the commitment peak in the ecdysteroid titre, which results from a failure of the prothoracic glands (PG) to increase the synthesis/secretion of the premoulting hormone, ecdysone. Since the PG from ZR 512 - and JH 1 -treated larvae are capable of being activated in vitro by the prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), the effect of JH on the PG does not involve suppression of gland sensitivity to PTTH. The locus of the JH effect was determined to be the brain-retrocerebral complexes (Br-CC-CA), on the basis of experiments which tested the effect of implanted Br-CC-CA from pre-commitment larvae treated with JH on the occurrence of pupal commitment in head-ligated larval hosts. The implanted, JH-treated Br-CC-CA exhibited a delayed release of PTTH, and the effect was at concentrations of JH that were physiological. These results argue that JH functions to control the time during the last larval instar when pupal commitment occurs by dictating when PTTH will undergo gated release...|$|R
40|$|Background: Enteric fever is endemic in {{developing}} countries like India. Widal test in a single serum sample is often the only test relied upon for laboratory diagnosis. The test is considered positive <b>if</b> the antibody <b>titres</b> are higher than the cut – off value in a single test or a rising titre in paired sera.

So the aim of our {{study was to determine}} the base line titres of antibodies among apparently healthy populations and to define the significant titres of widal test. Materials and Methods: Samples were initially screened by Widal slide agglutination test and further confirmed by the Quantitative tube agglutination test. Results: Among the 500 samples from apparently healthy individuals, 260 samples were positive for agglutinins. 141 were positive for ‘O’ agglutinin and 163 were positive for ‘H’ agglutinin of Salmonella typhi. Among 141 samples, 30 showed agglutination up to 1 in 20 titre, 100 up to 1 in 40 and 25 (4. 8 %) up to 1 in 80. Among 163 samples, 18 showed a titre of 1 in 20, 120 showed a titre of 1 in 40 and 21 (4. 2 %) up to 1 in 80. Conclusion: When a single widal titre is used for the diagnosis of enteric fever in our locality, it will be more appropriate to change the currently used cutoff levels against S. typhi to ≥ 1 in 160 for anti-O and ‘H’ agglutinins remains the same of ≥ 1 in 160...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Lyme borreliosis is a multi-systemic disease {{caused by}} {{spirochete}} Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. The specific response {{is influenced by}} phenotypic characteristics of Borrelia, different antigen structure, their different geographic distribution, and the patient’s capability {{to react to the}} infection. The immune response to Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato develops relatively late, whereas in some patients it never develops. The immune response in the early phase of Lyme borreliosis is very similar to the one of healthy population. Diagnosis of borrelia. Clinical manifestation, detailed anamnesis and epidemiological data are crucial for making the diagnosis. The majority of patients in the late phase of Lyme borreliosis have IgG antibody response, which could be followed by IgM also throughout this period of time. The number of serologically positive findings increases with the duration of the infection. Specific borrelial antigens can be detected by a Western blot test. In patients with neuroborreliosis, antibodies could be synthesized only intrathecally. IgG and IgM antibody response can persist for many years after the treatment. There is no positive serological test, which could be the indicator of the disease activity on its own; even if it demonstrates high antibody <b>titre.</b> <b>If</b> there are no clinical signs of Lyme borreliosis, the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis should be primarily based on clinical findings, and serological results should be used only to confirm but not to make the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis. Specific antibodies from the IgM class can be proved in about 50 % of patients, 2 to 4 weeks after the onset of primary infection, but an early administration of the antibiotics can postpone or inhibit that response. Interpretation of serological results. When interpreting the serological test results with high level of sensitivity and specificity used for making diagnosis of lyme borreliosis, it is necessary to take into consideration the seroprevalence in a certain region. In the population with a low prevalence of the disease, the tests will have a low positive predicative value, i. e. the probability of indicating the real disease will be lower. According to the recommendations given by the Centre for Disease Control in North America, all extreme and positive results of EA and IFA are to be confirmed by a Western blot test. Diagnostic problems. The main problem in making diagnosis of lyme borreliosis is underestimation and overrating of the diagnosis. Not a single positive serologic test is the indicator of the disease activity on its own, regardless of the antibodies titre level, when clear clinical signs are scarce...|$|R
40|$|Poster Presentations: S 1 -P 15 BACKGROUND: A {{number of}} populations have {{experienced}} genuine “follow-up” waves of pandemic H 1 N 1 influenza A (pH 1 N 1) infection (eg, winter waves of 2010 - 2011 in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong and the 2011 - 2012 winter wave in Mexico). An upward age shift {{has been observed}} in laboratory-confirmed clinical cases in these follow-up waves compared with earlier pandemic waves. Continued circulation of seasonal H 3 N 2 influenza A (sH 3 N 2) {{in the absence of}} seasonal H 1 N 1 suggests that sH 3 N 2 and pH 1 N 1 will co-circulate for the foreseeable future. METHODS: We recruited randomly from households in Hong Kong and asked participants to attend a central clinic to answer a questionnaire and provide a blood sample. We conducted 4 rounds: round 1, July 4, 2009 -September 19, 2009; round 2, November 11, 2009 -February 6, 2010; round 3, December 13, 2010 -March 19, 2011; and round 4, August 24, 2011 -December 17, 2011. The timing of our rounds relative to waves of clinical cases was assessed using monthly subtype-specific test results from the Center for Health Protection, Hong Kong. Everyone who provided a sample in round 1, who did not explicitly refuse to be contacted again, was invited to participate in subsequent rounds. Serum samples from individuals who participated in all 4 rounds were tested in quadruples using standard hemagglutinin inhibitor assays for pH 1 N 1 and sH 3 N 2. An individual was assumed to have been infected between pairs of waves <b>if</b> the <b>titre</b> for the second sample was ≥ 4 -fold greater than that of the first sample. RESULTS: We obtained quadruples of serum from 445 individuals aged 4 - 79 years. In general, our rounds of recruitment did not neatly bracket waves of clinical cases: round 1 was taken toward the start of the initial prolonged wave of pH 1 N 1 and round 2 was close to the end of that period. Rounds 2 and 3 did bracket a clear clinical wave of sH 3 N 2. Although rounds 2 and 4 bracketed the follow-up wave of pH 1 N 1, the interval between rounds 2 and 4 was long and contained some infections {{from the end of the}} initial wave. Between rounds 1 and 2, 45 of 445 participants were infected with pH 1 N 1. Of these 45, 33 % (95 % CI, 22 %- 49 %) were aged ≤ 18 years (children), 24 % (95 % CI, 15 %- 40 %) were aged 19 - 44 years (young adults), 22 % (95 % CI, 13 %- 37 %) were aged 45 - 64 years (middle-aged adults), and 20 % (95 % CI, 11 %- 36 %) were ≥ 65 years (older adults). Between rounds 2 and 4, 123 of 445 participants were infected with pH 1 N 1. Of these 123, 13 % (95 % CI, 8 %- 20 %) were children, 23 % (95 % CI, 16 %- 31 %) were young adults, 52 % (95 % CI, 44 %- 62 %) were middle-aged adults, and 11 % (95 % CI, 7 %- 18 %) were older adults. Between rounds 2 and 3, 51 of 445 participants were infected with sH 3 N 2. Of these, 13 % (95 % CI, 7 %- 26 %) were children, 16 % (95 % CI, 8 %- 29 %) were young adults, 49 % (95 % CI, 37 %- 63 %) were middle-aged adults, and 22 % (95 % CI, 13 %- 35 %) were older adults. CONCLUSIONS: There was a substantial shift in infections away from children toward middle-aged adults between the initial and follow-up waves of pH 1 N 1 in Hong Kong. The age distribution of infections in the follow-up wave of pH 1 N 1 was similar to that of sH 3 N 2. Middle-aged adults may be more important for influenza A transmission during nonpandemic periods than was assumed previously. Here, because of the timing of rounds, we focused on the distribution of ages of those infected, rather than on between-round serologic attack rates. However, these data could be combined with catalytic and mechanistic models of transmission to produce accurate estimates of age-specific infection rates for individual waves. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|With Reg. (EC) No. 854 / 2004 {{coming into}} force, {{surveillance}} was implemented as risk based meat inspection for pigs {{being held in}} integrated production systems under controlled housing since weaning, more precisely outlined in Reg. (EC) No. 1244 / 2007. However, which data and examinations to be performed is not yet fully clear. The {{aim of this study}} was to collect data and to examine options to construct a profile for each farm based on infrastructure, laboratory data and p. m. findings as required in Reg. (EC) No. 854 / 2004. Material and Methods Data from 296 fattening farms associated to 2 farmer associations (the first one with 230 farms and the second one with 66 farms) were available, in addition 56 management parameters, results of serological examination (ELISA for Salmonella, Trichinella, Yersinia) and p. m. findings potentially reflecting hygiene efforts and efficacy at farm level for the period between 2005 and 2009. These data were connected to a farm profile. In total, 3. 346 meat juice samples were examined, the minimum sample size for each farm was 10 (n = 10 Trichinella; n = 6 Yersinia). Salmonella-ELISA was realized in an external laboratory, following the mandatory German Salmonella Monitoring system. ELISA for Trichinella and Yersinia took place in the institute’s laboratory. A farm was classified as positive <b>if</b> the antibody <b>titre</b> for one of the pathogens was positive. Eight farms were only Salmonella-positive and 93 farms only Yersinia-positive. Most of the farms (193 farms) were Salmonella- and Yersinia-positive, three farms were negative for all pathogens. No Trichinella antibodies were detected. The sequence of combination Management parameters: Comparison of the two farmer associations, of the negative farms and of positive and negative farms yielded no significant difference. Laboratory data: Cut off-levels for Salmonella and Yersinia-ELISA OD were increased to identify farms with a higher antibody burden. With this step, 22 farms were identified and classified as “highly burdened”. Again comparison of management parameters of these farms with the negative farms did not yield any significant difference. P. m. findings: Finally, eleven p. m. findings with a possible association to hygiene from the highly burdened farms were examined. P. m. findings were arranged in a list and farms on top of these lists were identified. Management parameters of three suspected farms were scrutinized again and factors possibly reflecting causes for the high antibody titres and frequent p. m. findings were identified: In this case procedure of desinfection, housing system and use of bedding. Conclusions: It was possible to collect data for food chain control from different sources and to combine them. It was also possible to use a single meat juice sample for several investigations; however, for this meat juice must be available not only for one testing procedure. Management parameters: Routine assessment as yes / no answer is certainly useful for basic characterisation of farms however such basic information could not identify farms with a pathogenic burden. Finally, combination of specific p. m. findings with increased cut offlevels identified farms which might possibly fail in biosecurity. More or other management or environmental conditions should be considered in order to find factors with a higher informative value. In the end, with a stepwise approach it was possible to identify suspected conditions which had not been recognized without that approach...|$|R
