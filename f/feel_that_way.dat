5|$|I {{actually}} wrote a {{song about}} it on my album, it's called 'GUY' and it stands for 'Go Under You'. So wearing make-up, smelling delicious and having suckable, kissable, edible things between your limbs is something I find strengthening because I know that when I pick the right guy, I can let him have it. Some women feel oppressed by make-up and clothing, and here’s to them, they {{have every right to}} <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> as well.|$|E
25|$|In October 2006, Common Sense Media {{released}} {{a white paper}} compiled from existing research on body image perceptions in kids and teens. The paper states {{more than half of}} boys as young as 6 to 8 think their ideal weight is thinner than their current size and that children with parents who are dissatisfied with their bodies are more likely to <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> about their own.|$|E
500|$|In the new forewords to the Cleis Press editions, Bannon {{addressed}} the criticisms of her characters as self-destructive in limiting roles, explaining that she simply depicted {{what she knew}} and felt at the time. Bannon has said she knows {{the concerns of the}} women who are uncomfortable with the themes of her books: [...] "I can understand that; they weren't there. To them some of it looks negative and some of it looks depressing. Although I didn't <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> I always felt excited when I was writing them." ...|$|E

5000|$|Chambers {{said that}} co-writing was {{something}} she {{always wanted to do}} but never felt comfortable with until this record because there was no pressure in recording it. Nicholson said that [...] "Writing was a product of our environment, something that happened in and around our daily lives. And something that getting to know the Chambers family has shown me is a beautiful way to make music." [...] "We didn't want a duets album, where people come together for a vocal collaboration and go on their way. We wanted an album that sounds like a band with two singers in it. It <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> to us. And we hope it <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> to the people who hear it too." [...] states Chambers again.|$|R
500|$|Amanda Tapping (Samantha Carter) {{found that}} the {{introduction}} of the Ori threat inhibited major character and relationship development in season 9. The characters are of equal rank, and regard each other with respect according to producer Joseph Mallozzi. They give each other fair weight in decision-making, and Mitchell defers to Carter on all science-related issues. Tapping's favorite Mitchell-Carter scenes were some [...] "neat sibling-type moments" [...] in [...] "Arthur's Mantle", and moments showing their history and friendship in [...] "Line in the Sand", [...] "The Road Not Taken", and Stargate: The Ark of Truth. Browder regretted after season 10 that he had not worked enough with the cast besides Tapping, and that [...] "the fans probably <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> as well".|$|E
500|$|Sorensen {{also felt}} {{that it would be}} strange to see Declan played by Mullally, saying: [...] "Of course it will be strange to see someone playing the part that I started and {{basically}} created, it's been my life. It's not just being Declan at the studio, I get 'Declan' on the street, at restaurants, everywhere. Declan is me so to hand it over is difficult." [...] He also felt humble that viewers thought the character would not be the same played by another actor, adding: [...] "I'm very humbled {{that a lot of people}} think that – I can understand why fans would <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> because I starred as Declan for the past three years and that's all anyone knows." ...|$|E
500|$|Yorke {{has said}} that the album's lyrics are based on [...] "that {{anonymous}} fear thing, sitting in traffic, thinking, 'I'm sure I'm supposed to be doing something else' ... it's similar to OK Computer in a way. It's much more terrifying." [...] At the same time, Yorke felt [...] "there's very little anger in In Rainbows. It's in no way political, or, at least, doesn't <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> to me. It very much explores the ideas of transience. It starts in one place and ends somewhere completely different." [...] In another interview, Yorke said the album was [...] "about the fucking panic of realising you're going to die! And that any time soon [...] possibly [...] a heart attack when I next go for a run." ...|$|E

"Well, I'm not {{suffering}} from thirst," [...] declared the King, [...] "for there's enough water inside me to float all the boats of Regos and Coregos {{or at least}} it <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> But never mind!

"The improvisational {{elements}} of our shows {{have always been}} one of our favorite parts about playing together, and we think the audience <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> too," [...] keyboardist Joel Cummins explains to Spinner. [...] "That's the inspiration for the S2 series. It's also a great way for us {{to stay on top of}} our chops." ...|$|R
500|$|According to Vig, the {{inspiration}} for the song was a newspaper article about a woman who had gone back to get revenge on an abusive husband, [...] "so {{we thought it would be}} cool to get a bit of retribution in there." [...] Vig also said he noted violence could also come from psychological stand point by seeing the story of a sado-masochistic couple who could not keep away from each other. Lyrically, Manson claimed [...] "'Vow' is about having feelings [...] You have to face your feelings of revenge and work out why you <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> It's about that conundrum when you're really angry but in reality you're in a pitiful state. Angry, twisted, but deep down, vulnerable." [...] During promotion for the song, Garbage joked to journalists that [...] "Vow" [...] was about John and Lorena Bobbitt.|$|E
500|$|... "Climax" [...] {{was written}} by Usher, Redd Stylez, Ariel Rechtshaid, and Diplo, who also {{produced}} the song. Diplo introduced the song's concept to Usher, who was working {{with him on a}} new album. Usher wanted to expand his music's style and depth by working with Diplo. Diplo recounted the experience in an interview for The Guardian, saying that [...] "I had explained to him about a moment I had with a girl where I felt like I could die with her and be content, but I didn't and life moved on, and that point in my life was over. It was a sad feeling but it was beautiful. He was relating with me about the idea and how many times you think things are perfect and <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> but they can pass." [...] They discussed the concept throughout the song's development and how it relates to Usher's life, as Diplo [...] "tried to help realise these lyrics and feelings." [...] After conceiving some melody lines, they wrote the song in about an hour.|$|E
500|$|G-Dragon {{is noted}} for his {{androgynous}} appearance, with the Korea JoongAng Daily calling him [...] "a notable star fashioning genderless style", noting how his image deviates from the fixed gender type {{of men and}} women. Vogue Magazine stated how his androgynous or gender-bending appearance defies a [...] "society that maintains traditional, patriarchal values and a noted adherence to manufactured beauty ideals." [...] When he collaborated with Italian footwear designer Giuseppe Zanotti to launch a limited-edition collection of men's and women's shoes, he stated that [...] "it's not just girls or women who get excited and worked up over pretty shoes. [...] uys can <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> too." [...] G-Dragon's fashion {{has been described as}} [...] "quirky and experimental" [...] by Rushali Pawar of the International Business Times while Taylor Glasby from the British Magazine Dazed and Confused characterized his style as [...] "fluid and far-reaching," [...] calling him a [...] "natural style chameleon." [...] Monica Kim from Vogue Magazine admired his [...] "uncanny knack for larger-than-life style that remains wearably cool." [...] Joe Coscarelli from The New York Times calls him [...] "a style icon, a chameleon who often makes peak-era Lady Gaga seem staid." [...] He has covered various issues of W, Dazed, Hypebeast, [...] Elle, Vogue, and landed editorials in Harper’s Bazaar, Esquire, among other Asian magazines.|$|E

500|$|Few male {{respondents}} {{had engaged in}} childhood sex play, {{and it did not}} seem to be important in the development of homosexuality. Homosexual men were less likely to report having enjoyed boys' activities such as football and to see themselves as having been very masculine while growing up, but more likely to report having enjoyed stereotypical girls' activities. Three variables (dislike of typical boys' activities, enjoying typical girls' activities, and feelings of masculinity or femininity) were combined into a composite measure called [...] "Childhood Gender Nonconformity", which proved to be the most important developmental variable. It appeared to make male respondents less likely to feel attraction to the opposite sex during childhood, but more likely to feel sexually different from other boys, experience homosexual arousal and activities, and become homosexual as adults. Homosexual men were more likely to recall having felt different from other boys their age, or to say that they felt different because they did not like sport, or because they were not interested in girls or were sexually interested in other boys. They were also more likely to report feeling different because they had stereotypical feminine traits or interests. Feeling different during childhood appeared to be irrelevant, but feeling different for gender reasons during adolescence had [...] "modest total effects". Boys who felt sexually different were more likely to become homosexual as adults, whether they began to <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> during childhood or adolescence. While homosexual men were more likely to have been labeled sexually different or homosexual before the age of 19, this apparently played no significant role in the development of sexual orientation.|$|E

[...] He apologized for his remarks on his blog later the same night saying in part, [...] "I don't <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> My dad is a Republican.

2500|$|His son's suicide {{inspired}} O'Connor {{to start}} a crusade against the man who sold the drugs to Hugh. He called Harry Perzigian [...] "a partner in murder" [...] and a [...] "sleazeball". Perzigian filed a defamation lawsuit against the actor. In 1997, a California jury threw out the case. In an interview on CNN's Larry King Live soon after the verdict, O'Connor said {{he would never be}} able to put his son's death behind him. [...] "I can't forget it. There isn't a day that I don't think of him and want him back and miss him, and I'll <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> until I'm not here any more," [...] he said.|$|E
2500|$|The album {{contained}} several {{tracks that}} seemed to indirectly reference what the group called [...] "The Incident", and the group remained defiant. Maguire commented that, [...] "I'd rather have a smaller following of really cool people who get it, who will grow with us as we grow and are fans for life, than people that have us in their five-disc changer with Reba McEntire and Toby Keith. We don't want those kinds of fans. They limit what you can do." [...] Maines also retracted her earlier apology to President Bush, stating, [...] "I apologized for disrespecting {{the office of the}} President, but I don't <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> anymore.

2500|$|To {{the chagrin}} of long-time fans, the band waited until 2010 to perform live, despite having been {{together}} (as Shadow Gallery) since the early 1990s. When asked the question in one interview, Wehrkamp explained that [...] "We have always been more a studio band than a performing band unfortunately, and while we rehearsed for a tour just before Tyranny was started, a few obstacles blocked our touring options, and we were locked back in the studio to make another record. I know {{there are many people}} who cannot understand why we haven't played in support of this record, and I can see why they <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> but honestly, it's very difficult." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1996, Jemison filed a {{complaint}} against a Texas police officer, accusing him of police brutality during a traffic stop that ended in her arrest. She was pulled over by Nassau Bay, Texas officer Henry Hughes for allegedly making an illegal U-turn and arrested after Hughes learned of an outstanding warrant on Jemison for a speeding ticket. In the process of arresting her, the officer twisted her wrist and forced her to the ground. In her complaint, Jemison said the officer physically and emotionally mistreated her. Jemison's attorney said she believed she'd already paid the speeding ticket years ago. She spent several hours in jail and was treated at an area hospital after release for deep bruises and a head injury. Jemison said in a televised interview that the incident has altered her feelings about police there. [...] "I always felt safe and comfortable [...] I don't <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> anymore at Nassau Bay and that's a shame," [...] she said. Jemison {{filed a lawsuit against}} the city of Nassau Bay and officer Hughes.|$|E
2500|$|Upon arriving, {{they find}} their door is open, {{suggesting}} a burglar {{is inside the}} house. Bart fetches Homer a makeshift weapon made from a cinder block tied to a chain that he calls [...] "The Defender". Homer swings it around to threaten the burglar, but when the family smells apple pie, they discover it is actually Homer's mother, Mona Simpson. Mona says that her days of activism are over, and that she is staying for good. When she asks if Homer will forgive her, a shaken Homer angrily replies that he will not, {{because of all the}} times she left him as a child. Homer explains that he feels hurt and abandoned when Mona is not around, and does not want to <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> again. Later that night, Mona tries to explain to Homer she has changed her ways, but, again Homer does not listen. Afterwards, Homer realizes he should have listened to his mother, and makes her a card as an apology: when he goes downstairs to apologize, he sees her {{sitting in front of the}} fire, and asks if she is asleep. When he then notices and questions that she is [...] "sleeping with her eyes open", her head slumps down and Homer realizes that she has died.|$|E

A BBC spokesperson responded by saying [...] "It's a shame Deepak <b>feels</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> but <b>that's</b> clearly his personal opinion.
