By a case control design, 248 overweight or obese subjects and 351 lean normal controls were recruited in Harbin region in north China. All three polymorphisms were genotyped by Sequenom single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection system in both cases and controls. Genotypes for all three polymorphisms were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium in control subjects. Both groups had similar distribution of alleles and genotypes created by the <b>three</b> <b>coding</b> polymorphisms of LEPR gene. No differences in frequencies of genotypes or alleles between cases and controls for any polymorphism individually were found by χ 2 analysis (p = 0. 444, p = 0. 507 and p = 0. 662, respectively). Further, when the haplotypes of three polymorphisms were assessed, no association for any haplotype of three polymorphisms was revealed. In the present study, the <b>three</b> <b>coding</b> polymorphisms in LEPR gene were firstly investigated in a population of northern Chinese. It was suggested that the <b>three</b> <b>coding</b> polymorphisms in LEPR gene were unlikely to have major effects on susceptibility to obesity in northern Chinese.

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{prestressing}} requirements and reliability indices of prestressed concrete bridge girders designed using three codes: the Chinese Code, the Hong Kong Code and the AASHTO LRFD Code. Typical post-tensioned concrete girders of spans ranging from 25 to 40 m are considered. Deterministic analysis {{indicates that the}} service limit state governs the design according to the Chinese Code and the AASHTO LRFD Code. However for the Hong Kong Code, only those with longer spans are controlled by the service limit state. The actual number of strands needed by the AASHTO LRFD Code is quite close to that needed by the Chinese Code, while that required by the Hong Kong Code is about 18 - 33 % higher than that required by the AASHTO LRFD Code. Disparity between reliability indices for flexural capacity based on {{the requirements of the}} service and strength limit states exists in all <b>three</b> <b>codes.</b> However, the disparity does not follow the same trends as that of the required number of strands for service and strength limit states in the <b>three</b> <b>codes.</b> In addition, the reliability index for flexural capacity according to the requirements of the service limit state is always higher than that of the strength limit state in the <b>three</b> <b>codes.</b> The actual reliability indices for flexural capacity of the girders considered according to the <b>three</b> <b>codes,</b> which are governed by the service limit state, are close to one another. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Background. The R-Matrix {{formalism}} is {{a crucial}} tool {{in the study of}} nuclear astrophysics reactions, and many codes have been written to implement the relevant mathematics. One such code makes use of Visual Basic macros. A further open-source code, AZURE, written in the FORTRAN programming language is available from the JINA collaboration and a C++ version, AZURE 2, has recently become available. Purpose. The detailed mathematics and extensive programming required to implement broadly applicable R-Matrix codes make comparisons between different codes highly desirable in order to check for errors. This paper presents a comparison of the <b>three</b> <b>codes</b> based around data and recent results of the astrophysically important 18 F(p,α) 15 O reaction. Methods. Using the same analysis techniques as in the work of Mountford et al. parameters are extracted from the two JINA codes, and the resulting cross-sections are compared. This includes both refitting data with each code and making low-energy extrapolations. Results. All extracted parameters are shown to be broadly consistent between the <b>three</b> <b>codes</b> and the resulting calculations are in good agreement barring a known low-energy problem in the original AZURE <b>code.</b> Conclusion. The <b>three</b> <b>codes</b> are shown to be broadly consistent with each other and equally valid in the study of astrophysical reactions, although one must be careful when considering low lying, narrow resonances which can be problematic when integrating.

40|$|Under the {{sponsorship}} of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) is developing a performance assessment methodology {{for the analysis of}} long-term disposal of high-level radioactive waste (HLW) in unsaturated welded tuff. As part of this effort, SNL evaluated existing strongly heat-driven flow computer codes for simulating ground-water flow in unsaturated media. The <b>three</b> <b>codes</b> tested, NORIA, PETROS, and TOUGH, were compared against a suite of problems for which analytical and numerical solutions or experimental results exist. The problems were selected to test the abilities of the codes to simulate situations ranging from simple, uncoupled processes, such as two-phase flow or heat transfer, to fully coupled processes, such as vaporization caused by high temperatures. In general, all <b>three</b> <b>codes</b> were found to be difficult to use because of (1) built-in time stepping criteria, (2) the treatment of boundary conditions, and (3) handling of evaporation/condensation problems. A drawback of the study was that adequate problems related to expected repository conditions were not available in the literature. Nevertheless, {{the results of this study}} suggest the need for thorough investigations of the impact of heat on the flow field in the vicinity of an unsaturated HLW repository. Recommendations are to develop a new flow code combining the best features of these <b>three</b> <b>codes</b> and eliminating the worst ones. 19 refs., 49 figs...|$|R
