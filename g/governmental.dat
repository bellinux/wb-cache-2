5|$|The ACCC {{conceded that}} the state governments were not {{carrying}} on businesses in procuring the medical products. This meant that the governments were immune from Sections46 and 47 of the TPA. Baxter argued that this immunity extended to itself, by claiming derivative <b>governmental</b> immunity.

While {{the court held that}} Baxter would have breached the TPA, <b>governmental</b> immunity under Section2B extended to Baxter Healthcare. Allsop J's judgment was upheld unanimously on appeal to the full bench of the Federal Court (Justices Mansfield, Dowsett and Gyles presiding).

The fact that such right of occupancy finds no recognition in any statute or other formal <b>governmental</b> action is not conclusive.|$|E
