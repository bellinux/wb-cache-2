40|$|The {{powdered}} solids trapped in <b>filter</b> <b>sleeves</b> in the aluminium tertiary industry are currently disposed of in secure landfills {{as a result}} of environmental considerations. Their classification as a hazardous waste is due to their high aluminium content as metallic aluminium or in compounds such as aluminium nitride. These compounds can react with a very low moisture content to release toxic or hazardous gases such as hydrogen and ammonia. This paper presents a low-cost process for the full recovery of this hazardous waste in three steps leading to the production of two different added-value materials. In the first step, mild acid hydrolysis of the waste is carried out to obtain a concentrated aluminium solution and an inert cake. The following steps consist of hydrotalcite synthesis with the resulting solution, and the production of transparent glasses in the CaO–Al 2 O 3 –SiO 2 system with the cake. Characterisation of the products obtained indicates that the hydrotalcites can adsorb anionic pollutants (molybdates) in a simple way, while the glasses afford improved optical properties in comparison with those prepared by direct vitrification of the waste.

40|$|The Moravian Archives in Bethlehem, Pa., (MAB), {{requests}} an implementation {{grant of}} $ 148, 085 {{to renovate the}} storage space in the facility's larger vault {{in order to improve}} storage conditions of its multifaceted collections related to the Moravian Church in North America, detailing the history of this important transatlantic religious group from the 18 th century to the present. Specific project renovations would include 1) the installation of compact, moveable shelving, 2) installation of a hanging storage system for framed materials, 3) re-housing of object collection into acid-free boxes, and 4) replacement of outdated fluorescent lighting with new energy-efficient lighting outfitted with UV <b>filtering</b> <b>sleeves.</b> These improvements would address many goals outlined in recent preservation assessments, and would ensure the preservation and continued access to MAB collections...|$|R
50|$|Separating the bran {{and other}} parts of the grain from the desired flour was {{historically}} a difficult and time-consuming process to carry out manually. Efforts to automate the process began early on. Edmund Brunt filed a provisional patent on a 'bolting machine' in 1614. John Milne patented a machine in 1765 which used several grades of wire mesh or cloth to separate flour from bran. A machine for manufacturing bolting cloth, used to filter the flour from bran {{and other parts}} of the grain, was patented in 1783 by Benjamin Blackmore. And in 1850, James Bell devised a means of separating flour by pushing the feedstock (or 'stock') against a vertical cloth ('bolting sleeve') while Joseph Foot patented a means of making the <b>filter</b> <b>sleeve</b> from silk instead of wool. Development continued into the 19th and 20th centuries, increasing the speed and efficiency of the process through improvements such as the addition of beaters and brushes to force the fine flour through the filters and to continuously clean the filters as they rotated.|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of utilising solid residues {{of the municipal}} wastes incineration such as grate (bottom) ash and electrofilter and <b>sleeve</b> <b>filter</b> fly ash, in combination with a porcelain stoneware body, {{in the preparation of}} tiles has been investigated. While the chemical, mineralogical, thermal and rheological characterisation of the waste raw materials carries out some problems arising by using fly ash, these seem to be overcome with the bottom ash. The introduction of up to 20 wt% of this powder into the ceramic body does not substantially change the mineralogical and thermal behaviour of the product...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Two point-of-use {{drinking}} water treatment systems designed using a carbon filter and foam material {{as a possible}} alternative to traditional biosand systems were evaluated for removal of bacteria, protozoa, and viruses. Two configurations were tested: the foam material was positioned vertically around the carbon <b>filter</b> in the <b>sleeve</b> unit or horizontally in the disk unit. The filtration systems were challenged with Cryptosporidium parvum, Raoultella terrigena, and bacteriophages P 22 and MS 2 before and after biofilm development to determine average log reduction (ALR) for each organism {{and the role of}} the biofilm. There was no significant difference in performance between the two designs, and both designs showed significant levels of removal (at least 4 log 10 reduction in viruses, 6 log 10 for protozoa, and 8 log 10 for bacteria). Removal levels meet or exceeded Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards for microbial purifiers. Exploratory test results suggested that mature biofilm formation contributed 1 – 2 log 10 reductions. Future work is recommended to determine field viability...|$|R
40|$|Magnesium–aluminium hydrotalcite-like {{compounds}} at {{ratios of}} 2 : 1, 3 : 1 and 4 : 1 were prepared using a non-conventional aluminium source, the hazardous wastes from the aluminium tertiary industry. The method consisted {{in a conventional}} coprecipitation at constant pH 10 with magnesium chloride hexahydrate and stable solutions of Al 3 + from dispersions of the fine powder from the <b>sleeve</b> <b>filter</b> suction system in the aluminium slag milling process. The characterisation of the resulting materials indicated that hydrotalcites were strongly dependent {{on the presence of}} iron in the layers, as well as the carbonate and chloride content in the interlayer which affected the final properties. XRD and SAED indicated low crystallinity for these materials. Furthermore, as can be seen by SEM, the formation of disordered tiny nuclei was significant causing small spherical agglomerates. The infrared spectra showed a change of symmetry in the interlayer for the different ratios and the textural data suggested the “ink-bottle shaped” mesopores and type IIb isotherms, similar to the results obtained for pillared clays, and the transition to H 2 type in the hysteresis loops {{as a function of the}} higher ratio.
