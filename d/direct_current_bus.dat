40|$|Microinverter {{has become}} a new trend for {{photovoltaic}} (PV) grid-tie systems due to its advantages which include greater energy harvest, simplified system installation, enhanced safety, and flexible expansion. Since an individual microinverter system is typically attached {{to the back of}} a PV module, it is desirable that it has a long lifespan that can match PV modules, which routinely warrant 25 years of operation. In order to increase the life expectancy and improve the long-term reliability, electrolytic capacitors must be avoided in microinverters because they have been identified as an unreliable component. One solution to avoid electrolytic capacitors in microinverters is using a two-stage architecture, where the high voltage <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> (DC) <b>bus</b> can work as a double line ripple buffer.

40|$|Thesis (MScIng (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. A bi-directional, direct {{conversion}} switch-mode converter is proposed {{for use in}} distributed household renewable energy systems. The converter is intended as the central interface between the household energy system’s low voltage <b>Direct</b> <b>Current</b> <b>bus</b> and the high voltage Alternating Current bus. The low voltage DC bus is connected to renewable generation and storage devices, while the high voltage AC bus {{is connected to the}} user’s equipment and the mains grid. The converter overcomes the inherent reverse-duty cycle problem associated with bi-directional converters by using a combination step-up / step-down half-bridge converter on the high voltage side of a high frequency transformer. The low voltage side of the transformer is driven by a full bridge inverter that acts as a rectifier during reverse mode. In order to control the flow of power in both directions the converter implements Average Current Mode Control. A method is developed to determine the transfer functions of common switch-mode converters by inspection alone. This method is applied to the proposed converter, and both current and voltage mode control loops are designed with the frequency response method. The control system is implemented using a Digital Signal Processor. A method of simultaneously simulating both the converter hardware and software is developed using VHDL. This method greatly reduced the development effort of the converter. The operation of the proposed converter is verified through this method of simulation. A prototype converter is constructed and successfully tested, thereby proving the viability of the proposed converter topology and control methodology...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the design and}} {{implementation}} of a control strategy for interfacing a hybrid wind and ultracapacitor energy system is presented. The proposed system consists of a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) -based wind turbine and an ultracapacitor storage element. The PMSG-based wind turbine is connected to a DC (<b>direct</b> <b>current)</b> <b>bus</b> through an uncontrolled rectifier and a DC-DC boost converter; the ultracapacitor is interfaced to the DC-bus using a bidirectional DC-DC converter. In a wind energy system, because of the unpredictable nature of wind speed, a Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithm is essential for determining the optimal operating point of the wind turbine. This work proposes a new and simple MPPT algorithm based on hybridization of the Optimum Relation Based (ORB) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) methods. The proposed MPPT is advantageous in being sensorless, converging quickly and requiring no prior knowledge of system parameters. In addition, a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) strategy has been applied in designing the DC-DC converter controllers because of its systematic procedure and stability advantages and simplicity. Two controllers based on the LQR method have been designed and implemented. One controller forces input current of the boost converter to track the optimal reference current generated by the proposed MPPT algorithm. The other regulates the DC-bus voltage at a desired level. The regulation is accomplished by controlling the bidirectional converter interfacing the ultracapacitor and the DC-bus. The proposed energy system and its controllers have been simulated in MATLAB/Simulink and implemented using a TMS 320 F 2812 eZdsp board. Simulation {{results indicate that the}} proposed PSO-ORB MPPT algorithm average efficiency is 99. 4 %, with harvested electrical energy 1. 9 % higher than the conventional OTC and ORB MPPT algorithms. The simulation results also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LQR controllers in obtaining good tracking and their ability to quickly restore the system to its nominal operating point when it is exposed to a disturbance. The simulation results are highly comparable with the experimental results that have successfully verified the functionality of the proposed control techniques...|$|E

Energy storage (ES) units are one solution to improve power supply quality and guarantee system stability. In this paper, a hybrid microgrid {{is built based on}} photovoltaic (PV) generator and ES; and coordinated control is proposed and developed to achieve power management in a decentralized manner. This control scheme contains three different droop strategies according to characteristics of PV and ES.

40|$|A {{power supply}} for {{battery-powered}} systems {{has been designed}} with an embedded controller {{that is capable of}} monitoring and maintaining batteries, charging hardware, while maintaining output power. The power supply is primarily designed for rovers and other remote science and engineering vehicles, but it can be used in any battery alone, or battery and charging source applications. The supply can function autonomously, or can be connected to a host processor through a serial communications link. It can be programmed a priori or on the fly to return current and voltage readings to a host. It has two output power busses: a constant 24 -V <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> nominal <b>bus,</b> and a programmable bus for output from approximately 24 up to approximately 50 V. The programmable bus voltage level, and its output power limit, can be changed on the fly as well. The power supply also offers options to reduce the programmable bus to 24 V when the set power limit is reached, limiting output power {{in the case of a}} system fault detected in the system. The smart power supply is based on an embedded 8051 -type single-chip microcontroller. This choice was made in that a credible progression to flight (radiation hard, high reliability) can be assumed as many 8051 processors or gate arrays capable of accepting 8051 -type core presently exist and will continue to do so for some time. To solve the problem of centralized control, this innovation moves an embedded microcontroller to the power supply and assigns it the task of overseeing the operation and charging of the power supply assets.
