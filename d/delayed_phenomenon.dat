40|$|Pathological {{laughter}} is an uncommon symptom usually caused by bilateral, diffuse cerebral lesions. It {{has rarely been}} reported in association with isolated cerebral lesions. Midbrain involvement causing pathological {{laughter is}} extremely unusual. We describe three patients who developed pathological laughter after midbrain and pontine-midbrain infarction. In two patients a small infarction in the left paramedian midbrain was detected, whereas the third one sustained a massive bilateral pontine infarction extending to the midbrain. Laughter heralded stroke by one day in one patient and occurred as a <b>delayed</b> <b>phenomenon</b> three months after stroke in another. Pathological laughter ceased {{within a few days}} in two patients and was still present at a two year follow-up in the patient with delayed-onset laughter. Pathological laughter can herald midbrain infarction or follow stroke either shortly after onset of symptoms or as a <b>delayed</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> Furthermore, small unilateral midbrain infarctions can cause this rare complication...|$|E
40|$|X-irradiation (100 – 1500 r) {{administered}} to the heads of rats 8 – 30 days of age inhibited the development of glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase (l-glycerol 3 -phosphate–NAD oxidoreductase, EC 1. 1. 1. 8) in the brain stem and cerebral hemispheres. At 40 days of age and older no effect was observed. This inhibition was a <b>delayed</b> <b>phenomenon,</b> dose-dependent and with no recovery. It is proposed that the inhibition of enzyme formation is related to radiation damage caused to DNA. Actinomycin D inhibited the development of glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase {{in a manner similar}} to ionizing radiation. Four other dehydrogenases also showed age-dependent radiosensitivities. `Malic enzyme' (EC 1. 1. 1. 40), lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1. 1. 1. 27) and malate dehydrogenase (EC 1. 1. 1. 37) ceased to be radiosensitive at about 8 days of age and isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP) (EC 1. 1. 1. 42) at 16 days. The correlation between developmental increase in enzyme activity and radiosensitivity held closely for glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase and isocitrate dehydrogenase and to a smaller extent for the others...|$|E

Anthracyclines and trastuzumab are the drugs most commonly associated with development of a cardiotoxic effect. Heart failure, myocardial ischemia, hypertension, myocarditis, and thrombosis are typical manifestation of cardiotoxicity by chemotherapeutic agents. Diagnosis and monitoring of cardiac side-effects of cancer treatment is of paramount importance.

Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting is often required for treatment. Review of literature shows few case reports discussing benign magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T 2 hyperintense changes in the corpus callosum of NPH patients after shunting due to mechanical compression of the middle and posterior regions of the body against falx cerebri leading to ischemic demyelination.

40|$|Protection against {{anaphylactic shock}} in mice by {{reserpine}} {{has been shown}} to be a <b>delayed</b> <b>phenomenon,</b> probably not dependent upon a direct effect of reserpine. The release and depletion of catechol amines by reserpine show little likelihood of being responsible for protection because these substances are in themselves protective against anaphylactic shock, while β-TM 10, a drug which interferes with their release is not. Since L-α-methyl dopa and reserpine both deplete serotonin, and since both protect against anaphylactic shock, it is proposed that serotonin depletion is responsible for the protection. Enterochromaffin substance is depleted in anaphylactic shock. It is also depleted by reserpine and serotonin, both of which protect against anaphylactic shock when given prior to challenge with antigen. The amount of enterochromaffin substance seems to correlate with susceptibility to anaphylactic shock. The behavior of animals undergoing anaphylactic shock and the effect of shock on body temperature is similar to the effects on behavior and temperature of treatment with reserpine, which is known to release serotonin. The effect of monoamine oxidase inhibition on animals undergoing anaphylactic shock is also similar to the effect of monoamine oxidase inhibition on animals given reserpine. These results are consistent with the views that the release of serotonin is causally related to anaphylactic shock in mice and that serotonin is accumulated in the chromogenic material of the enterochromaffin cell...|$|E

40|$|Understanding the {{pathophysiological}} changes {{triggered by}} an acute {{spinal cord injury}} is a primary goal to prevent and treat chronic disability with a mechanism-based approach. After the primary phase of rapid cell death at the injury site, secondary damage occurs via autodestruction of unscathed tissue through complex cell death mechanisms that comprise caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathways. To devise novel neuroprotective strategies to restore locomotion, it is, therefore, necessary {{to focus on the}} death mechanisms of neurons and glia within spinal locomotor networks. To this end, the availability of in vitro preparations of the rodent spinal cord capable of expressing locomotor-like oscillatory patterns recorded electrophysiologically from motoneuron pools offers the novel opportunity to correlate locomotor network function with molecular and histological changes long after an acute experimental lesion. Distinct forms of damage to the in vitro spinal cord, namely excitotoxic stimulation or severe metabolic perturbation (with oxidative stress, hypoxia/aglycemia), can be applied with differential outcome in terms of cell types and functional loss. In either case, cell death is a <b>delayed</b> <b>phenomenon</b> developing over several hours. Neurons are more vulnerable to excitotoxicity and more resistant to metabolic perturbation, while the opposite holds true for glia. Neurons mainly die because of hyperactivation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase- 1 (PARP- 1) with subsequent DNA damage and mitochondrial energy collapse. Conversely, glial cells die predominantly by apoptosis. It is likely that early neuroprotection against acute spinal injury may require tailor-made drugs targeted to specific cell death processes of certain cell types within the locomotor circuitry. Furthermore, comparison of network size and function before and after graded injury provides an estimate of the minimal network membership to express the locomotor program...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — All post-silicon tasks – validation, diagnosis, delay {{testing and}} speed-binning – must {{be carried out}} by {{applying}} vectors to actual chips, and capturing and analyzing responses. Yet, vectors used must be generated and analyzed using pre-silicon models of the circuit. Three comprehensive industrial studies demonstrate that existing approaches for generating and analyzing such vectors are inadequate, and one major weakness is that existing delay models either do not capture process variations or do not capture advanced <b>delay</b> <b>phenomenon</b> that significantly affect delays, especially multiple input switching (also known as near-simultaneous transitions) at inputs of a gate, the charge on internal capacitance and Miller effect. In this paper, we address two related questions. (1) How do we extend advanced delay models that capture these <b>delay</b> <b>phenomena</b> to also capture process variations? (2) How do we use such a model, especially to select paths and generate or evaluate vectors for post silicon tasks? In particular, we present a general approach for extending any delay model (pin-to-pin and beyond) to ensure that all minimum and maximum delay values computed are guaranteed to bound the corresponding delay values in silicon. We present extensive experimental results to demonstrate that our models capture variability in a way that tightly bounds the actual delays, at a computational complexity that is practical even for generating vectors...|$|R
