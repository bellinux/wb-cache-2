5|$|By {{applying}} post-structuralist {{theory to}} anarchism, Newman presents {{an account of}} post-anarchism. His post-anarchism is more substantive than that of earlier thinkers, and has influenced later approaches to the philosophy.

5|$|In December 2001, {{a series}} of deposit runs began to have a severe impact {{on the health of}} the banking system, leading the Argentine {{authorities}} to impose a partial deposit freeze. With Argentina no longer in compliance with the conditions of the expanded IMF-supported program, the IMF decided to suspend disbursements. At the end of December, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>climate</b> of severe political and social unrest, the country partially defaulted on its international obligations; in January 2002, it formally abandoned the convertibility regime.|$|E

25|$|The AIPA, {{from which}} the CNIPA is partly inherited, was {{established}} in 1993 <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>climate</b> {{of concern for the}} efficiency of public administration.

25|$|The Americas have {{developed}} both {{white and red}} wines, {{some of which are}} now recognized worldwide. White wines have to conquer hostile territories where red wine dominates such as the Rocky Mountains or Canada.

25|$|In 1988, the Chilean people denied General Augusto Pinochet a {{new term}} in a referendum, thus passing a key {{step in the}} country's {{transition}} to democracy. Unlike the privatization and liberalization in other infrastructure sectors, reform {{of the water and}} sanitation sector was thus not imposed by the military government but initiated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>climate</b> of democracy.|$|E

25|$|The {{politicization}} {{of science in}} the sense of a manipulation of science for political gains is a part of the political process. It is part of the controversies about intelligent design (compare the Wedge strategy) or Merchants of Doubt, scientists that are under suspicion to willingly obscure findings. e.g. about issues like tobacco smoke, ozone depletion, global warming or acid rain. However, e.g. in case of the Ozone depletion, global regulation based on the Montreal Protocol has been successful, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>climate</b> of high uncertainty and against strong resistance while in case of Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol failed.|$|E

40|$|Research {{shows that}} there are many bottle-necks in Public Private Partnership (PPP) Projects in Dutch spatial development. Due to the {{specific}} properties of Public Private Partnerships, these bottle-necks can lead to dysfunctional conflicts which are damaging the project. Hence the question is: how to prevent these conflicts? Literature doesn?t answer this question on <b>an</b> operational level <b>in</b> the context of <b>a</b> PPP project <b>in</b> spatial development. So ten cases of PPP in spatial development are selected <b>in</b> which <b>a</b> conflict escalated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> way that the existence of the project was on the edge. The research strategy is to compare cases <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cooperative <b>climate</b> with cases <b>in</b> <b>a</b> competitive <b>climate.</b> Data are collected by interviewing representatives of the public side as well of the private side. Analyzing the data, several interventions are found. Analysis shows that <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cooperative <b>climate</b> <b>a</b> rich variety of interventions is used, while <b>in</b> <b>a</b> competitive <b>climate</b> the interventions are limited. The analysis also shows that <b>in</b> <b>a</b> competitive <b>climate</b> interventions are more focused on the relationship between the partners than on feasibility, while <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cooperative <b>climate</b> both aspects are equally attended. Regardless of a cooperative or <b>a</b> competitive <b>climate,</b> the interventions found are concerning the feasibility of the project or the relation between actors. One moment it proves to be necessary to emphasize feasibility and the other moment the relationship. Therefore it is concluded that in spatial development dysfunctional conflicts in PPP projects can be prevented by balancing between feasibility and relationship. As such this research contributes to organizing collaboration. Real Estate and HousingArchitectur...|$|R
25|$|Fear may be {{politically}} and culturally manipulated to persuade citizenry of ideas which {{would otherwise be}} widely rejected or dissuade citizenry from ideas which would otherwise be wildly supported. In contexts of disasters, nation-states manage the fear not only to provide their citizens with an explanation about the event or blaming some minorities, but also to adjust their previous beliefs. The manipulation of fear is done by means of symbolic instruments as terror movies and the administration ideologies that lead to nationalism. After a disaster, the fear is re-channeled <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>climate</b> of euphoria based on patriotism.|$|E
25|$|The 1,600-year-old Sigiriya frescoes are {{an example}} of ancient Sri Lankan art at its finest. They {{are one of the}} best {{preserved}} examples of ancient urban planning in the world. They have been declared by UNESCO as one of the seven World Heritage Sites in Sri Lanka. Among other structures, large reservoirs, important for conserving water <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>climate</b> with rainy and dry seasons, and elaborate aqueducts, some with a slope as finely calibrated as one inch to the mile, are most notable. Biso Kotuwa, a peculiar construction inside a dam, is a technological marvel based on precise mathematics that allows water to flow outside the dam, keeping pressure on the dam to a minimum.|$|E
25|$|In warm, damp climates, H. aspersa may {{lay eggs}} {{as often as}} five times from February through October, {{depending}} on the weather and region. Mating and egg-laying begin when {{there are at least}} 10 hours of daylight and continue until days begin to get shorter. In the United States, longer hours of sunlight that occur when temperatures are still too cold will affect this schedule, but increasing hours of daylight still stimulate egg laying. If warm enough, the eggs hatch in about 2 weeks, or in 4 weeks if cooler. It takes the baby snails several more days {{to break out of the}} sealed nest and climb to the surface. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>climate</b> similar to southern California's, H. aspersa matures in about 2 years. In central Italy, H. aspersa hatches and emerges from the soil almost exclusively in the autumn. If well fed and not overcrowded, those snails that hatch at the start of the season will reach adult size and form a lip at the edge of their shell by the following June. If the environment is manipulated to get more early hatchlings, the size and number of snails that mature the following year will increase. In South Africa, some H. aspersa mature in 10 months, and under ideal conditions in a laboratory, some have matured in 6 to 8 months. Most of H. aspersa's reproductive activity takes place in the second year of its life.|$|E
