40|$|Spatial {{associations}} of tree saplings with spiny or toxic plants in <b>grazed</b> <b>woodlands</b> are generally explained by associational resistance, i. e., protection against grazing via a well-defended neighbor. In this study, we tested whether directed seed dispersal and post-dispersal seed removal by wood mice are additional {{explanations for the}} observed spatial association between thorny shrubs and trees, hence before associational resistance. We performed three studies in <b>grazed</b> <b>woodlands</b> in the Netherlands to test this idea. Our first seed dispersal experiment with tagged acorns showed indeed that wood mice disperse acorns directed towards shrubs. The majority of these dispersed acorns were, however, consumed. Our second experiment revealed that post-dispersal removal of cached acorns was higher under shrubs than in grassland and under trees, but also indicated the importance of within-shrub position: shrub centers were faster depleted than shrub edges. Also the number of freshly emerged seedlings and older saplings differed between micro-habitats, being higher under trees and at shrub inner-edges than at shrub outer-edges, shrub centers, and in grassland. The spatial associations with shrubs got stronger with the age of saplings, which probably reflect accumulated grazing effects over time, being higher in the open than in shrubs. We conclude that directed acorn dispersal and post-dispersal acorn removal by wood mice are two additional explaining mechanisms for the spatial associations between thorny shrubs and trees in <b>grazed</b> <b>woodlands,</b> before associational resistance. Our findings change the view that large herbivores are the sole main drivers behind tree recruitment patterns in <b>grazed</b> <b>woodlands...</b>|$|R

"This thesis examines the effects of species, rainfall and soil type on tree biomass regressions, {{as well as the}} effects of stand dominance and structure on stand biomass regressions in north-east Australian woodlands. This was achieved by examining tree characteristics and biomass relationships for a series of woodland monitoring sites throughout the study area. This study utilised a modified data set from this permanent monitoring site network to provide structural attributes for trees and communities of varying composition in the <b>grazed</b> <b>woodlands.</b> These data were supplemented with environmental data and tree harvest data sets. Initially, the research reported in this thesis developed allometric and stand biomass regressions for Callitris glaucophylla communities. This research also demonstrated that changes in tree-form were not reflected in changes in the environment, nor did such changes reflect changes in tree biomass regressions for three eucalypt species. As a result, a common regression provides a robust estimate of total aboveground biomass of eucalypt trees in the study area. Thus expensive destructive harvesting can generally be avoided for minor eucalypt species. Finally, this study demonstrated a successful methodology that described the stand structure of all the <b>grazed</b> <b>woodland</b> sites based on tree heights. This methodology was developed to allow the expansion of a single stand regression to estimate stand biomass across the entire north-east Australian woodlands. The findings demonstrated in this study, combined with the long-term data from the permanent monitoring network sites, should enhance the estimation of carbon flux within eucalypt communities of north-east Australia’s <b>grazed</b> <b>woodlands.</b> " [...] abstract...|$|R

40|$|Concern {{about the}} risk of harmful human-induced climate change has {{resulted}} in international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. We review the international and national context for consideration of greenhouse abatement in native vegetation management and discuss potential options in Queensland. Queensland has large areas of productive or potentially productive land with native woody vegetation cover with approximately 76 million ha with woody cover remaining in 1991. High rates of tree clearing, predominantly to increase pasture productivity, continued throughout the 1990 s with an average 345, 000 ha/a estimated to have been cleared, including non-remnant (woody regrowth) as well as remnant vegetation. Estimates of greenhouse gas emissions associated with land clearing currently have a high uncertainty but clearing was reported to contribute a significant proportion of Australia's total greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 (21 %) to 1999 (13 %). In Queensland, greenhouse emissions from land clearing were estimated to have been 54. 5 Mt CO(2) -e in 1999. Management of native vegetation for timber harvesting and the proliferation of woody vegetation (vegetation thickening) in the <b>grazed</b> <b>woodlands</b> also represent large carbon fluxes. Forestry (plantations and native forests) in Queensland was reported to be a 4. 4 Mt CO(2) -e sink in 1999 but there are a lack of comprehensive data on timber harvesting in private hardwood forests. Vegetation thickening is reported for large areas of the c. 60 million ha <b>grazed</b> <b>woodlands</b> in Queensland. The magnitude of the carbon sink in 27 million ha <b>grazed</b> eucalypt <b>woodlands</b> has been estimated to be 66 Mt CO(2) -e/a but this sink is not currently included in Australia's inventory of anthropogenic greenhouse emissions.

40|$|Habitat {{is a key}} {{determinant}} of breeding success in hole-nesting birds. Identifying {{the factors that influence}} breeding success is important in understanding nest-site selection behaviour and devising appropriate conservation strategies. This is especially true for declining species like the migratory Pied Flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca. Here, I analyse the effect of 24 habitat variables on clutch size, hatching success and fledging success for 137 Pied Flycatcher nests in Gloucestershire, UK, using volunteer-collected data from a 5 -year period. More successful nests tended to be located in areas with a lower density of mature trees but abundant saplings. Tree and sapling species richness was also important. Success was positively related to abundance of Oak Quercus robur and Silver Birch Betula pendula and negatively related to Beech Fagus sylvatica, Sycamore Acer pseudoplatanus and Bracken Pteridium aquilinum. Success was lower in boxes facing south-southwest and higher in boxes located on sorter trees. Despite Pied Flycatchers often being regarded as birds of <b>grazed</b> (open) <b>woodland,</b> success was not related directly to grazing. Close proximity to footpaths was associated with significantly lower clutch size, numbers of young to fledge, and percentage success, while close proximity to water was associated with increased success at all stages of breeding. This is a single-site study and the generality of these findings at other sites cannot be assumed without empirical testing. However, the results provide useful additional insight into success-habitat interactions in this species that, to some extent, challenge the general view of Pied Flycatchers, in the UK at least, as <b>grazed</b> <b>woodland</b> specialists...|$|R

40|$|Question Thorny shrubs play {{keystone}} {{roles in}} grazed ecosystems by defending non-protected plants against herbivores, but their establishment in grazed ecosystems is poorly understood. Which factors control establishment of recruits of thorny nurse shrubs in <b>grazed</b> temperate <b>woodlands?</b> Location Ancient <b>grazed</b> temperate <b>woodlands</b> (52 degrees 32 'N, 6 degrees 36 'E), The Netherlands. Methods We surveyed biotic and abiotic factors for saplings of thorny nurse shrubs in plots {{with and without}} saplings. To disentangle these factors, we performed a transplantation experiment over two growing seasons with nurse shrub saplings (Prunus spinosa and Crataegus monogyna) planted in two dominant vegetation types - tall unpalatable swards and short grazed lawns - half of them protected from herbivory via exclosures. Results Plots with shrub saplings had taller surrounding vegetation, higher soil pH and higher soil moisture than plots without saplings. These plots predominantly contained unpalatable sward species, while plots without saplings mainly contained palatable lawn species. After transplantation, sapling survival was higher in exclosures than in the open, and higher in sward exclosures than in lawn exclosures. Sapling growth was higher in swards than in lawns, higher inside than outside exclosures, and higher for Prunus than Crataegus, while browsing on saplings was higher in lawns. Conclusion Unpalatable swards form essential establishment niches for thorny shrubs in grazed temperate woodlands: they protect against herbivores before thorns fully develop in saplings, and sapling growth is better due to improved micro-environmental conditions. Once established and thorny, shrub saplings grow out of the protective range of the swards and in turn facilitate tree seedlings, which are essential for long-term persistence of <b>grazed</b> temperate <b>woodlands.</b> This study shows that nurse plants may start as proteges before becoming facilitators for other plants in a later life stage. This may be common for nurse plants in various ecosystems. We argue that improved understanding of establishment of nurse plants and their constraining factors is crucial for effective conservation and restoration in various ecosystems...|$|R

Each season bushy growth will sprout from the stumps/roots often appearing like small shrubs. Continuous grazing by livestock, regular burning and/or regular harvesting for fuel wood results in these 'shrubs' never attaining tree stature.

40|$|A diverse soil {{microbial}} community {{is involved in}} nitrogen cycling, and these microbes can be affected by land management practices and weed invasion. We surveyed 20 woodlands {{with a history of}} livestock grazing, with livestock recently excluded from 10 sites. We investigated whether soil nutrients were lower when grazing was excluded and higher when exotic grasses dominated the understory. Second, using quantitative real-time PCR, we investigated whether microbial nitrogen functional gene (NFG) abundance was altered with soil nutrient enrichment, livestock exclusion, and exotic grass invasion. The target genes were chiA (decomposition-ammonification), nifH (nitrogen fixation), nirK and narG (denitrification), and bacterial amoA (nitrification). Woodland soils were enriched in phosphorus and nitrogen compared to reference condition sites, but soil nutrients were not lower following livestock exclusion. Total nitrogen and nifH were negatively correlated in <b>grazed</b> <b>woodlands,</b> suggesting that aboveground herbivory reduces the capacity for belowground nitrogen fixation. Woodlands dominated by exotic grasses had higher levels of nitrate, narG, and nirK than those dominated by native grasses. We hypothesize that the increase in potential for denitrification was due to increases in soil nitrate, rather than changes in plant composition. Overall, soil physicochemistry explained more variation in NFG abundance than livestock presence or plant invasion, particularly for chiA and bacterial amoA, with significant relationships between the abundance of all five NFGs and total nitrogen or nitrate. All woodlands investigated had a history of anthropogenic disturbance and nutrification, and soil nutrient levels and the abundance of NFGs are likely to be related to long-term land management practices...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{introduced}} large herbivores on {{the abundance of}} Ixodes ricinus ticks and their Borrelia infections was studied in a natural woodland in The Netherlands. Oak and pine plots, either ungrazed or grazed by cattle, were selected. Ticks were collected weekly by blanket dragging. Borrelia infections were determined by PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism. Rodent densities were estimated using mark-release-recapture methods. On occasion, the cattle were inspected for tick infestations. Meteorological data were recorded for each habitat. Significantly more ticks were collected in the ungrazed woodland than in the <b>grazed</b> <b>woodland.</b> The ungrazed oak habitat had higher tick densities than the pine habitat, while in the grazed habitats, tick densities were similar. Borrelia infection rates ranged from zero in larvae to 26 % in nymphs to 33 % in adult ticks, and B. afzelii, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. garinii, and B. valaisiana were the species involved.
