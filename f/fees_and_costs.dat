5|$|In June 2009, a {{group of}} {{consumers}} filed the class action suits Owens v. Apple, Inc. and Johnson v. Apple Inc. against Apple on behalf of American individuals who purchased iTunes gift cards and who were then unable to use the cards to purchase iTunes music at the price advertised on the card because Apple raised {{the price of the}} music after it sold the cards to consumers. The Johnson case absorbed the Owens case and was settled on February 10, 2012, with payments to be made to consumers by Apple. The Owens complaint alleged that Apple wrongfully marketed, distributed, and sold iTunes gift cards and songs through its online iTunes store, while representing that consumers could use the gift cards to purchase songs for US$.99 a song and then, after such gift cards were purchased, raised the price on certain songs to $1.29 on April 7, 2009. The lawsuit's allegations included that Apple's conduct constituted breach of contract, violated the state consumer fraud statute, and violated consumer protection statutes of other states. The plaintiffs sought a $.30 refund remedy for each song that class members purchased using a $.99 iTunes card for which they were charged $1.29, plus their attorneys' <b>fees</b> <b>and</b> <b>costs.</b> Apple mounted a vigorous defense and sought to dismiss the suit but lost its motion in December 2009. Individuals are part of the class of plaintiffs if they are U.S. residents who purchased or received an iTunes Gift Card on which the card itself or its packaging contained language to the effect that songs were priced at $0.99 and who used the card to purchase one or more $1.29 songs from the iTunes Store on or before May 10, 2010. The settlement provides class members with an iTunes Store credit of $3.25 if an online claim form was submitted on or before September 24, 2012.|$|E

500|$|The defendants, MacShara and Rudzewicz, filed {{a motion}} to dismiss the case on the {{argument}} as Michigan residents, the District Court of Southern Florida did not have jurisdiction. After a hearing, the Court ruled that Florida has personal jurisdiction under State of Florida's long-arm statute, stating that [...] "...a non-resident Burger King franchise {{is subject to the}} personal jurisdiction of this Court in actions arising out of its franchise agreements". The partners filed a counter claim and alleged Burger King had violated Michigan's Franchise Investment Law and sought damages and fees. After a short trial, the Court found for Burger King and ordered Rudzewicz and MacShara to close the restaurant and awarded Burger King damages, <b>fees,</b> <b>and</b> <b>costs.</b>|$|E

[...] The Cherokee Nation issued a forceful response, saying [...] "it is not responsible for paying the <b>fees</b> <b>and</b> <b>costs</b> for the Capobiancos because of its Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity from suits without its express consent." [...] The Cherokees also [...] "made clear the tribe's displeasure with the Capobianco's very public media appearances, interviews and various fundraising schemes {{during the same time}} in which all the parties were under statutory gag order in South Carolina".|$|E
500|$|On August 23, 2010, U.S. District Judge Irma E. Gonzalez {{ruled that}} Trump University {{was not a}} public figure, {{did not need to}} show malice on Makaeff's part, and could proceed with its {{defamation}} claim. Makaeff appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, where a three-judge panel ruled unanimously on April 17, 2013, that Trump University is a [...] "limited-purpose public figure" [...] and that Trump University must demonstrate malice on Makaeff's part to establish defamation; it returned the case to the district court to consider the defamation claim against that standard. After additional briefing, U.S. District Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel ruled in Makaeff's favor on June 16, 2014, and dismissed the defamation claim. Makaeff then, at the court's invitation, presented evidence of her legal costs and fees in connection with the defamation litigation. She asked for $1.3 million, and on April 20, 2015 Curiel ordered Trump University to reimburse Makaeff $798,000 in legal <b>fees</b> <b>and</b> <b>costs.</b>|$|E

500|$|Due to a recessionary {{period in}} the United States {{beginning}} with the energy crisis in late 1979, sales began to decline at the location and the partnership failed to pay their required franchise fees and rent service to Burger King Corporation. After attempts over the intervening months to negotiate a compromise with MacShara and Ruzewicz failed, Burger King terminated the franchise agreement and ordered the pair to vacate the property. Rudzewicz and MacShara refused to comply and [...] continued operation of their restaurant even after they were served the notice. Burger King response was to file a lawsuit in May 1981 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida claiming breach of contract and trademark infringement. Burger King sought an injunction against the pair preventing them from operating the restaurant and seeking damages because MacShara and Ruzewicz were [...] "...tortiously infringing its [...] trademarks and service marks through their continued, unauthorized operation as a Burger King restaurant". The company also sought reimbursement of all legal <b>fees</b> <b>and</b> <b>costs</b> associated with the filing.|$|E
500|$|Under Lord Hardwicke, Chancery {{procedure}} was further reformed {{with a pair}} of orders published in 1741 and 1747, which mandated that a claimant who brought his case to court and had it dismissed immediately should pay full costs to the other side, rather than the 40 shillings previously paid, and that parties filing bills of review should pay £50 for the privilege. At the same time, a review of the Court's costs and fees was undertaken by a Parliamentary Committee. The Committee reported that <b>fees</b> <b>and</b> <b>costs</b> had increased significantly since the last review under Charles I, a number of expensive honorary positions had been created, and on many occasions court officers had not known what the correct fees were. At the same time, proceedings had grown to several thousand pages in length, necessitating additional expense. The Committee concluded [...] "that the interest which a great number of officers and clerks have in the proceedings of the Court of Chancery, has been a principal cause of extending bills, answers, pleadings, examinations and other forms and copies of them, to an unnecessary length, to the great delay of justice and the oppression of the subject". They recommended that a list of permissible fees be published and circulated to the court officials.|$|E

2500|$|In America Online, Inc. v. Prime Data Systems, Inc., the {{defendants}} sent millions of spam emails to AOL subscribers advertising computer software {{programs designed to}} facilitate bulk emailing by allowing users to harvest email addresses from the plaintiff's member directories, chat rooms, and electronic bulletin boards. The defendants also used technology designed to avoid AOL's spam filtering mechanisms. The defendants frequently used false and deceptive [...] "headers" [...] in email messages {{to make it appear}} as if AOL had sent the messages. The increased demand on AOL's servers resulting from the spam caused substantial delays of up to 24 hours in the delivery of all email to AOL members, forcing AOL to temporarily stop accepting any new messages. As the spam problem grew worse, AOL had to purchase {{millions of dollars worth of}} additional equipment to increase the capacity of its servers to handle the volume of email. The court held that this activity constituted a trespass to chattels and awarded injunctive relief, reasonable attorneys' <b>fees</b> <b>and</b> <b>costs,</b> as well as damages.|$|E

The atlas was sold commercially and not for free reuse by others. The dispute was whether Drauglis' license terms that would apply to [...] "derivative works" [...] applied to the entire atlas. Drauglis sued the defendants on June 2014 for copyright infringement and license breach, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, damages, <b>fees,</b> <b>and</b> <b>costs.</b> Drauglis asserted, among other things, that Kappa Map Group [...] "exceeded {{the scope of the}} License because defendant did not publish the Atlas under a license with the same or similar terms as those under which the Photograph was originally licensed." [...] The judge dismissed the case on that count, ruling that the atlas was not a derivative work of the photograph {{in the sense of the}} license, but rather a collective work. Since the atlas was not a derivative work of the photograph, Kappa Map Group did not need to license the entire atlas under the CC BY-SA 2.0 license. The judge also determined that the work had been properly attributed.|$|E
