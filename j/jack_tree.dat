According to the legend it was here the Travancore king Marthanda Varma once hid inside the hollow trunk of a Jackfruit tree to escape from his enemies during his war against the 'ettuveetil pillamar' (the eight nair chieftains). The King prayed to Lord Krishna for helping {{him as he was}} being {{surrounded}} by the enemies.

In 1797, shortly after the British {{occupied}} the lowlands, a rebellion broke out and sepoys of the 35th Madras Regiment were besieged within the walls of the Hanwella fort and took casualties. In 1803 during the first British-Kandyan War, Kandyan forces, under Pilima Talauva, attacked the fort which was commanded by Lieutenant Charles Mercer on the 3 September. The British managed to hold off the Kandyans until reinforcements arrived under the command of Captain William Pollard on the 6 September.Little evidence of the fort remains apart from remnants of the fortifications and the moat. A rest house is currently located on the site of the former fort. On the 17 December 1875 the then Prince of Wales, Albert Edward, stopped at the rest house and planted a <b>jack</b> <b>tree</b> on the site to commemorate his visit to Sri Lanka.

40|$|This paper {{tells the}} story of the <b>jack</b> (fruit) <b>tree</b> in Jharkhand, India.

It is a tale not just of corruption and delays, but also of colluding interests across the state–community divide. We also consider how this system was changed, and how the price of jackfruit increased, when trade in this timber was deregulated in the 1990 s. In the second part of the paper we revisit these tales and consider what they might tell us about some of the claims that have surfaced in the new environmental history. These claims relate to common property regimes, the organisational cultures of State Forestry Departments, the politics of environmentalism, and the meanings of empowerment...|$|R
50|$|The primary mode of {{employment}} in the Sakaleshapura region is agriculture. Crops grown include coffee, rice, pepper, cardamom, ginger and tea with coffee being dominant. Sakaleshapura coffee is shade grown {{on the slopes of}} the Western Ghats as the elevation is not high enough to enable the intensive cultivation practices followed in the Brazilian and Colombian highlands. But shade cultivation is acclaimed by environmentalists rather than sunlight cultivation followed in Ethiopia and other African Coffee growing nations, as western ghats runs through Sakaleshapura. Large timber yielding trees such as Rose wood and <b>Jack</b> <b>trees</b> provide shade for these coffee bushes.|$|R

40|$|AbstractFermentation {{by several}} types of {{microorganisms}} was considered as one of several factors causing quality degradation of the palm sap used for production of palm sugar. During harvesting period, pH value of the palm sap gradually decreasing from 6. 5 to approximately 4. 5. In {{order to avoid the}} rapid fermentation, traditionally, the local community uses a material made by mixing small pieces of heartwood of <b>jack</b> <b>tree</b> (Artocarpus heterophyllus) with slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) solution. However, the safety of this material if consumed by the human is still unclear. Consumption of food containing high concentration of slaked lime may cause several organ dysfunctions such as liver, kidney, also heart and cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate an alternative material substituting the traditional one by examining the antimicrobial and acidity-stabilizing effects of Yellow Root (Arcangelisia flava Merr) extract. Antimicrobial activity of the water extract was evaluated through a disc-diffusion method using three microorganisms, Salmonella typhii, Staphylococcus aureus, and Trichophyton rubrum. In addition, toxicity test was also performed using BSLT (brine shrimp lethality test). Water extract of A. flava exhibited a positive respond against Salmonella typhii, Staphylococcus aureus, and Trichophyton rubrum with inhibition zones of 19. 35, 16. 98, and 19. 78 mm, respectively at application level of 2 % (v/v). Furthermore, this extract also showed an ability to stabilize the acidity of fresh palm sap (pH 5. 8 - 6. 5) due to fermentation mechanism during harvesting and storing. The ability of the extract to stabilize the acid level may be caused by the presence of its active compounds such as alkaloid, tannin, and saponin. The glucosides of those compounds may inhibit the hydrolysis of disaccharide such as sucrose becomes its monosaccharides. Those compounds may also deactivate enzyme invertase secreted by the microbes which can increase the acid level. From the toxicity test, water extract of A. flava was considered as a natural product with no toxicity. Therefore, water extract of A. flava can be utilized as a safe natural food additive, especially in the production of palm sugar...|$|E
