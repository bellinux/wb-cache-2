40|$|The Navigation Rules Expert System (NRES) is a CLIPS-based {{implementation}} of the <b>International</b> and <b>Inland</b> Maritime <b>Navigation</b> Rules (COMDTINST M 16672. 2 C) to assist mariners. NRES functionality {{is divided into two}} components, the Mariner-Assistance Module and the Student-Tutor Module. The Mariner-Assistance Module (MAM) is designed for use in real-time operations to assist mariners in correctly determining both the maritime situation and the necessary action(s) to be taken in accordance with the <b>International</b> and <b>Inland</b> Maritime <b>Navigation</b> Rules. In practice, NRES could double-check navigation decisions and issue warnings when the possibility of accidents arises; while some human judgment will always be necessary in this task, it could well be useful on the bridge to have a different and dispassionate point of view. The Student-Tutor Module (STM) is designed to train students in the understanding and application of the <b>International</b> and <b>Inland</b> Maritime <b>Navigation</b> Rules in order to strengthen maritime navigation situational decision-making. The STM utilizes the NRES CLIPS rules database as the source from which the tutor questions are drawn and employs audio and visual cueing information derived from th...|$|R

40|$|Based on the unsatisfying {{situation}} for all stakeholders on the Austrian <b>inland</b> <b>navigation</b> market the research question {{of this paper}} is derived: Are there any universally valid <b>inland</b> <b>navigation</b> success factors? Which are they? Four European <b>inland</b> <b>navigation</b> systems are chosen, analysed and finally compared with the Austrian <b>inland</b> <b>navigation</b> system. The variations which derive from this arrangement are examined more closely. Those which {{have a positive effect on}} the progress of the <b>inland</b> <b>navigation</b> system will be designated as success factors. In this diploma thesis eleven success factors could be diagnosed. In the final part of this paper a recommended course of action for the Austrian <b>inland</b> <b>navigation</b> system is provided. However, the first step to improve the situation is to cause a positive change in the attitude of the government and the industry which is using this mode of transportation. Without this elementary transformation the implementation of the success factors would not have any positive impact. It is crucial for the survival of <b>inland</b> <b>navigation</b> in Austria that action must be taken. This is the only chance that waterborne transport remains as an attractive option beside rail and road in the long run. Without taking action <b>inland</b> <b>navigation</b> will keep losing its share in the Austrian modal split and eventually become of no relevance for the industry when choosing the mode of transport for their goods.

40|$|<b>Inland</b> <b>navigation</b> {{is known}} as a safe and {{environmentally}} friendly transport mode. Compared with maritime navigation and short sea shipping, it has to fulfill much stricter emission regulations. <b>Inland</b> <b>navigation</b> faces strong competition with road and rail transport, demanding superiority in environmental friendliness as competitive advantage. Therefore, <b>inland</b> <b>navigation</b> has to deal with the challenge of introducing highly efficient technologies for the improvement of its environmental performance being applicable to small spaces, in contrast to seagoing vessels where generally enough space is available. Focussed on emissions to the air, the environmental performance of <b>inland</b> <b>navigation</b> and means for its improvement are discussed in the light of results of the EU project CREATING (www. creating. nu) and the Cleanest Ship project (www. cleanestship. eu). The legislation with respect to exhaust emissions in waterborne and road transport is outlined briefly. Different emission reduction techniques and alternative fuels are discussed with respect to their emission reduction potential and applicability to <b>inland</b> <b>navigation.</b> The environmental performance of <b>inland</b> <b>navigation</b> with respect to emissions to the air is compared with road transport and the achievable compliance with emission standards is discussed. The application of advising tempomaat, low sulphur fuel equal to road standard EN 590, selective catalytic reduction and particulate matter filter is found to be the most suitable solution to improve the environmental performance of <b>inland</b> <b>navigation.</b> These systems are utilized in the demonstrator the Cleanest Ship, being briefly outlined in this paper...|$|R

40|$|<b>Inland</b> <b>navigation</b> {{systems are}} large scale {{networks}} {{that are used}} for transport. The navigation can be accommodated if the navigation condition are gathered, i. e. if there is enough volume of water in {{each part of the}} network. Thus, it is necessary to supply the <b>inland</b> <b>navigation</b> networks with water and to well dispatch the available volume of water on the whole system. This aim is generally achieved without difficulty in normal condition. However, during drought periods, the available volume of water is decreasing and the navigation conditions would not be reached every time. These situations are expected to be more current in the future specially in a global change context in which the frequency and the magnitude of drought events will increase. Hence, it is necessary to design some tools to study the resilience of <b>inland</b> <b>navigation</b> networks against drought events. For this purpose a flow network model, allowing to simulate the <b>inland</b> <b>navigation</b> systems, is proposed in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{analyses}} {{the choice}} between different transport modes, based {{on the concept of}} total logistics costs. Not only the cost of transportation itself is considered, but also all the other costs that arise in the supply chain, such as the costs of goods handling, the costs of inventory carrying, etc. In a first case-study, based on real-market data, {{the choice between}} road haulage and <b>inland</b> <b>navigation</b> is analysed for an annual volume of 55. 000 tonnes of bulk goods. In this case-study the trade-off between transport costs and inventory carrying costs is shown: <b>inland</b> <b>navigation</b> has lower transport costs, but its inventory carrying costs are higher. Due {{to the fact that the}} bulk goods considered have a low value, leading to low inventory carrying costs, <b>inland</b> <b>navigation</b> turns out to be the cheapest transport mode from the viewpoint of total logistics costs. It is shown that for goods with a significantly higher value (and thus larger inventory carrying costs), the difference in total logistics costs between both transport modes becomes very small. In a second case-study, a comparison is made between rail transport, <b>inland</b> <b>navigation</b> and road haulage for a volume of 80. 000 tonnes of bulk goods per year. Both rail transport and <b>inland</b> <b>navigation</b> require precarriage and/or oncarriage by truck, as well as goods handling. This increases the transport costs of both modes considerably. As a result, road haulage turns out to be the cheapest transport mode from the viewpoint of the total logistics costs. However, when a larger ship type can be deployed than the one currently used, the balance turns in favour of <b>inland</b> <b>navigation...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{a context}} of global change, <b>inland</b> <b>navigation</b> {{transport}} has gained interest with economic and environmental benefits. The development of this means of conveyance requires the improvement of its management rules {{to deal with the}} increase of navigation (schedules and frequency) and the potential impact of global change. To achieve this aim, it is first necessary to have a better knowledge about the dynamics of <b>inland</b> <b>navigation</b> networks and their interaction with the environment. Second, the potential effects of global change have to be anticipated. This article focuses on the modeling of <b>inland</b> <b>navigation</b> reaches. An <b>inland</b> <b>navigation</b> network is a large-scale distributed system composed of several interconnected reaches. These reaches are characterized by non-linearities, time delays, and generally no significant slope. To deal with these particularities, a gray-box model is proposed. It consists in determining the delays according to the physical characteristics of the system. The parameters of the model are identified with measured data. The gray-box model is used to reproduce the dynamics of the Cuinchy–Fontinettes reach located in the north of France. Postprint (author’s final draft...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{a global}} change context, governments in Europe want to promote {{alternative}} transports as <b>inland</b> <b>navigation</b> or railway instead of road transport. As example, in north of France, {{a shift of}} 20 % from road transport to these alternative transport solutions is expected by 2050. Reaching this goal requires not only the delivery of new infrastructures and equipment, but also the design of efficient management strategies. By focusing on waterborne transport, it is thus necessary to improve {{the management of the}} <b>inland</b> <b>navigation</b> networks particularly the water resource. Indeed, the waterborne transport accommodation is strongly linked to the available water resource. This will be a challenging point in a global change context. The paper deals with the global change impacts on <b>inland</b> <b>navigation</b> networks. It aims at proposing new contributions as compared to past and current results of European projects on climate change and <b>inland</b> <b>navigation.</b> It appeared that the multi-scale modeling approach for <b>inland</b> <b>navigation</b> networks that was proposed during the last TRA Conference in Paris in 2014 is useful to determine the resilience of these networks and their ability to guarantee the navigation conditions during drought and flood periods. The proposed tools are developed to consider two space and time scales. The first approach is used to determine the water quantity that is necessary to accommodate the navigation during half a day, and the second allows the efficient control of the gates to keep the water level of each navigation reach close to its setpoint by rejecting disturbances and compensating the waves due to the lock operations. One example based on the real <b>inland</b> <b>navigation</b> network of the north of France is used to highlight the contributions of the multi-scale modeling approach...|$|R
