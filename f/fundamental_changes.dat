40|$|This essay {{examines}} {{narratives of}} <b>fundamental</b> <b>change,</b> which portray {{a break in}} the continuity between a pre-transition and post-transition transgender subject, in accounts of transgender transitions. Narratives of <b>fundamental</b> <b>change</b> highlight the various changes that occur during transition and its disruptive effects upon a trans subject’s continuous identity. First, this essay considers the historical appearance of <b>fundamental</b> <b>change</b> narratives in the social sciences, the media, and their use by families of trans people, partners of trans people, and trans people themselves. After this is a consideration of Mark Johnson’s account of narrative as a meaning-making activity that occurs in the context of social norms. Johnson’s account is then applied to narratives of <b>fundamental</b> <b>change</b> to explain why these narratives occur, especially in relation to social norms and lived experience. The essay concludes by considering the trajectory of <b>fundamental</b> <b>change</b> narratives, looking at emerging transgender narratives, which stress a more integrated, complex account of transgender lives...|$|R

5|$|Macdonald's {{more than}} 15 years as premier brought <b>fundamental</b> <b>changes.</b> Under his leadership, the Nova Scotia {{government}} {{spent more than}} $100million paving roads, building bridges, extending electrical transmission lines and improving public education. Macdonald dealt with the mass unemployment of the Great Depression by putting the jobless to work on highway projects. He felt direct government relief payments would weaken moral character, undermine self-respect and discourage personal initiative. However, he also faced the reality that the financially strapped Nova Scotia government {{could not afford to}} participate fully in federal relief programs that required matching contributions from the provinces.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 18th century, {{the society}} of the kingdom {{followed}} age-old and deeply established norms of social interaction between people. Accounts by contemporaneous travellers indicate the widespread practice of the Hindu caste system and of animal sacrifices during the nine-day celebrations (called Mahanavami). Later, <b>fundamental</b> <b>changes</b> occurred due to the struggle between native and foreign powers. Though wars between the Hindu kingdoms and the Sultanates continued, the battles between native rulers (including Muslims) and the newly arrived British took centre stage. The spread of English education, the introduction of the printing press and the criticism of the prevailing social system by Christian missionaries helped make the society more open and flexible. The rise of modern nationalism throughout India also affected Mysore.|$|E
5|$|The Early Middle Ages in Romania {{started with}} the {{withdrawal}} of the Roman troops and administration from Dacia province in the 270s. In the next millennium a series of peoples, most of whom only controlled two or three of the nearly ten historical regions that now form Romania, arrived. During this period, society and culture underwent <b>fundamental</b> <b>changes.</b> Town life came to an end in Dacia with the Roman withdrawal, and in Scythia Minorthe other Roman province in the territory of present-day Romania400 years later. Fine vessels made on fast potter's wheels disappeared and hand-made pottery became dominant from the 450s.

5|$|At a September 10, 2008, press conference, Paul {{announced}} his general support of four third-party candidates: Cynthia McKinney (Green Party); Bob Barr (Libertarian Party); Chuck Baldwin (Constitution Party); and Ralph Nader (independent). He said {{that each of}} them had pledged to adhere to a policy of balancing budgets, bringing the troops home, defending privacy and personal liberties, and investigating the Federal Reserve. Paul also said that under no circumstances would he be endorsing {{either of the two}} main parties' candidates (McCain– Republican Party, or Obama– Democratic Party) because there were no real differences between them, and because neither of them, if elected, would seek to make the <b>fundamental</b> <b>changes</b> in governance that were necessary. He urged instead that, rather than contribute to the “charade” that the two-party election system had become, the voters support the third-party candidates as a protest vote, to force change in the election process. Later that same day, Paul gave a televised interview with Nader saying much the same again.|$|E

5|$|Because of his {{political}} connections and his mastery of French, McClellan received the assignment to be an official observer of the European armies in the Crimean War in 1855. Traveling widely, and interacting with the highest military commands and royal families, McClellan observed the siege of Sevastopol. Upon {{his return to the}} United States in 1856 he requested assignment in Philadelphia to prepare his report, which contained a critical analysis of the siege and a lengthy description of the organization of the European armies. He also wrote a manual on cavalry tactics that was based on Russian cavalry regulations. Like other observers, though, McClellan did not appreciate the importance of the emergence of rifled muskets in the Crimean War, and the <b>fundamental</b> <b>changes</b> in warfare tactics it would require.|$|E
5|$|From {{the summer}} of 1940, the Committee became {{increasingly}} divided between the members keen for closer collaboration with the Germans, led by Victor Leemans, and those who wished to remain strictly within the proscribed Belgian legal framework, led by Ernst de Bunswyck. In October 1940, the Germans were able to pass <b>fundamental</b> <b>changes</b> to the system of regional Burgomasters in the country though the Committee without resistance. The Committee had announced in October 1940 that it would refuse to enforce anti-Jewish legislation, but did not resist their implementation by the military government. The Committee's ambivalent stance meant that Belgian policemen and civil servants were not instructed to refuse to participate in rounding-up of Jews {{as part of the}} Final Solution from 1942. Tensions grew between the Germans and the committee in December 1940, and in early 1941 the Germans reshuffled the committee; appointing more pro-Nazi members. From March 1941, {{it became clear that the}} Committee would no longer be able to resist German demands, even those clearly violating the Hague Convention.|$|E
5|$|Retrospective {{coverage}} of Burnout 3: Takedown has been overwhelmingly favourable, with many publications considering {{it to be}} among the best games released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox consoles, as well {{as one of the greatest}} racing games ever made. Edge magazine called the game a pivotal moment for the series and reflected positively on the <b>fundamental</b> <b>changes</b> that had Criterion made in designing it. They praised the game for being balanced all round while noting that later instalments like Revenge and Dominator had pushed the series too far in a particular direction, consequently diluting a lot of what Burnout 3 had accomplished. IGN reaffirmed these thoughts in 2015, by declaring the game as the most perfect arcade racer ever conceived and the peak of the series. In 2015, USgamer listed Burnout 3: Takedown as the twelfth best game since 2000, stating that it remained at the forefront of the arcade racing genre.|$|E

5|$|The 13th century brought <b>fundamental</b> <b>changes</b> to the {{structure}} of Polish society and its political system. Because of constant internal conflicts, the Piast dukes were unable to stabilize Poland's external borders. Western Farther Pomerania broke its political ties with Poland {{in the second half of}} the 12th century and from 1231 became a fief of the Margraviate of Brandenburg, which in 1307 extended its Pomeranian possessions even further east, taking over the Sławno and Słupsk areas. Pomerelia or Gdańsk Pomerania became independent of the Polish dukes from 1227. In mid-13th century, Bolesław II the Bald granted Lubusz Land to the Margraviate, which made possible the creation of the Neumark and had far reaching negative consequences for the integrity of the western border. In the south-east, Leszek the White was unable to preserve Poland's supremacy over the Halych area of Rus', a territory that had changed hands on a number of occasions.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} debates arising during the 1970s was over the theory of punctuated equilibrium. Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould proposed that there was a pattern of fossil species that remained largely unchanged for long periods (what they termed stasis), interspersed with relatively brief periods of rapid change during speciation. Improvements in sequencing methods resulted in a large increase of sequenced genomes, allowing the testing and refining of evolutionary theories using this huge amount of genome data. Comparisons between these genomes provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of speciation and adaptation. These genomic analyses have produced <b>fundamental</b> <b>changes</b> in the understanding of the evolutionary history of life, such as the proposal of the three-domain system by Carl Woese. Advances in computational hardware and software allow the testing and extrapolation of increasingly advanced evolutionary models and the development of the field of systems biology. One of the results has been an exchange of ideas between theories of biological evolution and the field of computer science known as evolutionary computation, which attempts to mimic biological evolution for the purpose of developing new computer algorithms. Discoveries in biotechnology now allow the modification of entire genomes, advancing evolutionary studies to the level where future experiments may involve the creation of entirely synthetic organisms.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} {{and history of}} Sarawak {{has resulted in a}} broad diversity of ethnicity, culture and languages. Among the indigenous peoples of Sarawak, outside influences have led to many changes over time. The Iban tribal culture in Sarawak centred on the concept of the warrior and the ability to take heads from other tribes in battle. This practice, central as it was to the Iban people, was made illegal under James Brooke's rule and ultimately faded away although reminders of the practice are still seen in some long houses. Two other tribal peoples of the Sarawak Highlands, the Kelabit and Lun Bawang, have seen <b>fundamental</b> <b>changes</b> to their ethnic identities {{as a direct result of}} their conversion to Christianity. One major change was the shift in the focal point of their social interactions from the traditional long house to the local church. Their religious devotion has also helped shape their worldview outside of their village, particularly in response to change. For the Penan people, one of the last tribes to still be practising a nomadic lifestyle within the jungle, outside influence, particularly education, has resulted in a significant decline in the population that practice the nomadic lifestyle. Others settle down after intermixing with members of different tribes, such as the Orang Ulu. One direct result of this diversity in cultures, engendered by a policy of tolerance to all races, is the increasing numbers of tribal peoples marrying not only other Sarawakian tribes, but also to Chinese, Malays as well as citizens of European or American descent.|$|E

40|$|An {{unforeseen}} <b>fundamental</b> <b>change</b> {{of circumstances}} can be invoked to prompt {{the termination of}} a treaty, under the customary rule 'rebus sic stantibus', which is codified in Article 62 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT). The <b>fundamental</b> <b>change</b> must affect the essential basis of the treaty and radically transform obligations still to be performed.   Maritime boundaries are agreed upon {{in accordance with the}} United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and they delimit overlapping maritime entitlements, which are generated by coastal features. Natural occurrences can cause significant and unexpected changes in coastal geography which can affect circumstances essential to a maritime boundary treaty’s conclusion and radically alter the extent of on-going obligations. Treaties establishing boundaries cannot be subject to unilateral termination by virtue of a <b>fundamental</b> <b>change</b> of circumstances because they are excluded under Article 62 (2) (a) VCLT. However, the 'travaux préparatoires' of the International Law Commission and relevant case law suggests that the exclusion only covers treaties delimiting territorial boundaries and full sovereignty. Consequently, treaties establishing boundaries to the exclusive economic zone, exclusive fisheries zone and the continental shelf can be subject to termination due to a <b>fundamental</b> <b>change</b> of circumstances...|$|R
