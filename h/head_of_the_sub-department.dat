5|$|Luther {{broached}} {{the subject with}} Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, who was simultaneously developing a similar scheme. By 18 June, Hitler and Ribbentrop spoke <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Plan with Italian leader Benito Mussolini as a possibility that could be pursued after <b>the</b> defeat <b>of</b> France. Once he learned <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plan, SS-Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich, chief <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Reich Main Security Office (RSHA), insisted that Ribbentrop relinquish any future responsibility for the Plan to that office. As Heydrich had been appointed by Göring in January 1939 to oversee Jewish evacuation from German-occupied territory, the Jewish question was hence under his purview. Adolf Eichmann, <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> RSHA <b>Sub-Department</b> IV-B4, which dealt with Jewish affairs and evacuation, soon became involved. On 15 August, he released a memorandum titled Reichssicherheitshauptamt: Madagaskar Projekt (Reich Main Security Office: Madagascar Project), calling for <b>the</b> resettlement <b>of</b> a million Jews per year {{for four years and}} abandoning <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> retaining any Jews in Europe. The RSHA, he emphasized, would control all aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> program. While Rademacher called for the colony to be under German control but self-governing under Jewish administration, Eichmann made it plain that he intended for the SS to control and oversee every aspect <b>of</b> life on <b>the</b> island, which they would govern as a police state.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> origins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Architectural Services Department {{lie in the}} Architectural Office, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sub-departments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former Public Works Department (PWD). The PWD {{was founded}} in 1891, but <b>the</b> {{structure}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> department at that time is reportedly unclear. The Architectural Office existed by 1939, and following the disruption in operations during the Japanese occupation, the unit was kept busy in the postwar years by rebuilding work. The 1948 annual report <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Public Works Department reported that 274 government buildings were repaired that year. During the 1960s the Architectural Office was heavily involved in the resettlement housing programmes, but these duties were divested to the Hong Kong Housing Authority upon its 1973 establishment.|$|R

He oversaw the police raid on an Aboriginal community at Mapoon, on the Cape York Peninsula.
