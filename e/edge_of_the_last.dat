50|$|The {{topography}} of eastern Massachusetts was determined most {{by the fact}} that, at the maximum glaciation of the Pleistocene Era, it {{was the site of}} the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> glaciation, at approximately 18,000 BC. This glacier had planed the land under it nearly flat. Gravel- and boulder-lined streams ran along its surface. From 18,000 to about 10,000 BC, the glacier receded, dropping its stony contents as eskers and moraines, the dominant features of the region. The glacier's recession created ridges, deposited sand and gravel, the dominant material of the riverbed, over which mud has been deposited. Low-gradient drainage created the meandering streams, which typically drop no more than 30-40 feet.|$|E

50|$|There has {{not been}} a mention of male of female {{courtship}} neither in the field nor in captivity. The male in fact does not win by display, he wins by <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> display.Once <b>the</b> male is close enough to the female, he opens his wings a little to facilitate his jump on the females back. As soon as he lands he proceeds to hold on to her with his raptorial legs. His tibiae fit into a pair of grooves on either side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> females mesothorax in front <b>of</b> her wing-bases.When <b>the</b> male is in a secure position, copulation is initiated. The genitals, which are found on <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abdomen in both sexes, look quite different: the males possess a pair of asymmetrical claspers while the females have an ovipositor. The ovipositor is rather short in comparison to other insects. It is covered by part by <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> sternum. <b>The</b> abdomen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> male curves and twists in a 90Â° angle around the females to insert the claspers between the ovipositor and the sternum. <b>The</b> abdomen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> male then contracts in a peristaltic manner.

After getting away approximately 50 cm, he stops and freezes for about four minutes before he leaves eventually. This behavior could be interpreted as necessary rest after <b>the</b> efforts <b>of</b> copulating in a safe distance from the female.|$|R

They can then customize their character, such as changing its gender and eye or skin color. A character's species is only cosmetic and does not affect gameplay.
