25|$|In 1625, Duke Friedrich Kettler of Courland {{granted the}} town city rights, which were affirmed by King Sigismund III of Poland in 1626, {{although}} under what legal authority Sigismund <b>had</b> <b>is</b> debatable. Under Duke Jacob Kettler (1642–1681), Libau {{became one of}} the main ports of Courland as it reached the height of its prosperity. In 1637 Couronian colonization was started from the ports of Libau and Ventspils (Windau). Kettler was an eager proponent of mercantilist ideas. Metalworking and ship building became much more developed, and trading relations developed not only with nearby countries, but also with Britain, France, the Netherlands and Portugal.|$|E
25|$|The Indus Valley {{is one of}} the world's {{earliest}} urban civilizations, {{along with}} its contemporaries, Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt. At its peak, the Indus Civilization may have had a population of well over five million. Inhabitants of the ancient Indus river valley developed new techniques in metallurgy and handicraft (carneol products, seal carving) and produced copper, bronze, lead, and tin. The civilization is noted for its cities built of brick, roadside drainage system, and multistoried houses. The baths and toilets system the cities <b>had</b> <b>is</b> acknowledged {{as one of the most}} advanced in the ancient world. The grid layout planning of the cities with roads at exact right angles is a modern system that was implemented in the cities of this particular civilization. The urban agglomeration and production scale of this particular civilization was unsurpassed at the time and for many future centuries.|$|E

25|$|Ryelandt, “a Flemish artist”? Although Ryelandt {{wrote in}} French, the {{language}} {{of high school and}} college instruction at the time in all of Belgium, his native language was Dutch. As he held music to be a language sui generis, as his vocal music is set to texts in a variety of languages, and as he encouraged performances in translations, it is clear he aspired to be an international artist. Yet his reputation as a Flemish artist, which he has always <b>had,</b> <b>is</b> not undeserved. In his day it was unfashionable to consider Dutch a language on a par with, say, French or German. Ryelandt did consider it so (he disapproved of francophones who despised Dutch), and treated it so, in his compositions. And in a sense he acknowledged he was a Flemish artist, by accepting a representative function in the Christelijk Vlaams Kunstenaarsverbond ‘Christian Flemish Artists’ Organization’, besides Constant Permeke and Stijn Streuvels.|$|E
25|$|Heraclitus {{was born}} to an aristocratic family in Ephesus, in the Persian Empire, {{in what is now}} called present-day Efes, Turkey. His father was named either Blosôn or Herakôn. Diogenes says that he abdicated the kingship (basileia) in favor of his brother and Strabo {{confirms}} that there was a ruling family in Ephesus descended from the Ionian founder, Androclus, which still kept the title and could sit in the chief seat at the games, as well as a few other privileges. How much power the king <b>had</b> <b>is</b> another question. Ephesus {{had been part of the}} Persian Empire since 547 and was ruled by a satrap, a more distant figure, as the Great King allowed the Ionians considerable autonomy. Diogenes says that Heraclitus used to play knucklebones with the youths in the temple of Artemis and when asked to start making laws he refused saying that the constitution (politeia) was ponêra, which can mean either that it was fundamentally wrong or that he considered it toilsome. Two extant letters between Heraclitus and Darius I, quoted by Diogenes, are undoubtedly later forgeries.|$|E
25|$|Elasmosaurus {{had four}} sacral {{vertebrae}} (the fused vertebrae {{that form the}} sacrum connected to the pelvis), a number typical of elasmosaurids. The transverse processes here were very short, and the rib facets increased in size from the first to the fourth sacral vertebra. A ridge ran {{along the top of}} these vertebrae, and the lower sides of the centra were rounded, and bore pairs of nutritive foramina, separated by low ridges. The first tail (or caudal) vertebra could be distinguished by the preceding sacral vertebra by having smaller rib facets, and by being positioned in {{the lower half of the}} centrum. These vertebrae were almost circular in shape, and the first two bore a narrow keel in the middle of the upper side. The rib facets of the tail vertebrae were located on the lower side of the centra, and their oval shape became larger and broader from the third vertebra and onwards, but became smaller from the 14th vertebra. Here, the pre zygapophyses also reached over the level of the centra for most of their length, while the post zygapophyses reached over this level by half their length. The lower part of the centra were rounded from the first to the third tail vertebrae, but concave from the fourth to the 18th. The usual number of trail vertebrae in elasmosaurids is 30. Since the last tail-vertebrae of elasmosaurids were fused into a structure similar to the pygostyle of birds, it is possible this supported a tail-fin, but the shape it would have <b>had</b> <b>is</b> unknown.|$|E

500|$|Although Henry's {{marriage}} to Catherine {{has since been}} described as [...] "unusually good", {{it is known that}} Henry took mistresses. It was revealed in 1510 that Henry had been conducting an affair with one of the sisters of Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham, either Elizabeth or Anne Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon. The most significant mistress for about three years, starting in 1516, was Elizabeth Blount. Blount is one of only two completely undisputed mistresses, few for a virile young king. Exactly how many Henry <b>had</b> <b>is</b> disputed: David Loades believes Henry had mistresses [...] "only to a very limited extent", whilst Alison Weir believes there were numerous other affairs. Catherine did not protest, and in 1518 fell pregnant again with another girl, who was also stillborn. Blount gave birth in June 1519 to Henry's illegitimate son, Henry FitzRoy. The young boy was made Duke of Richmond in June 1525 in what some thought was one step on the path to his eventual legitimisation. In 1533, FitzRoy married Mary Howard, but died childless three years later. At the time of Richmond's death in June 1536, Parliament was enacting the Second Succession Act, which could have allowed him to become king.|$|E
