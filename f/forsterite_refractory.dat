40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of amorphous silica on the phase formation and study the physical characteristics of <b>forsterite</b> <b>refractory</b> prepared from quartz and MgO powder. Various samples were subjected to sintering temperature around 1100  °C and development of forsterite phase was characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The result indicate that the addition of rice husk ash (RHA) significantly affect the formation of forsterite phase. As the amount of RHA increased, it led to a better reaction between amorphous silica and periclase, later that will transform into forsterite phase at a temperature around 1100  °C. Formation of forsterite resulted in decrease of density, porosity, and thermal conductivity, while the opposite was observed for Cold Crushing Strength. Formation of forsterite phase was identified by XRD analysis of the sample. Based on the characteristics, the samples were considered as an insulator and of the potential use as refractory devices...|$|E
40|$|The oxygen isotopic {{composition}} {{of a variety}} of individual olivine grains (including <b>refractory</b> <b>forsterite</b> grains, cores of isolated olivine grains, FeO-rich rims, and individual matrix olivine grains) from the Allende CV 3 meteorite was investigated by ion microprobe mass spectrometry, in order to obtain information on the formation mechanism of these samples. It was found that the most primitive (i. e., refractory) olivine in Allende is far less enriched in O- 16 than are spinel and pyroxene in Ca,Al-rich inclusions, suggesting that Allende olivine must have formed in an environment that is less enriched in O- 16 compared to the gas from which Ca,Al-inclusions are formed. FeO-rich (26 - 30 wt pct) rims of isolated olivine grains are significantly higher in delta-O- 17 and delta-O- 18 than forsteritic cores, suggesting that these rims formed by condensation from an oxidized gas with higher delta-O- 17 than delta-O- 18. Matrix olivine was found to be highest in FeO and to have the lowest enrichment in O- 16...|$|R

40|$|Oxygen isotope {{compositions}} of bulk chondrules {{and their}} mineral separates in type 3 ordinary chondrites (UOC) show several % {{variability in the}} oxygen three isotope diagram with slope of approx. 0. 7 [1]. In contrast, ion microprobe analyses of olivine and pyroxene phenocrysts in ferromagnesian chondrules from LL 3. 0 - 3. 1 chondrites show mass dependent isotopic fractionation as large as 5 % among type I (FeO-poor) chondrules, while type II (FeO-rich) chondrules show a narrow range (less {{than or equal to}} 1 %) of compositions [2]. The. Delta(exp 17) O (=delta(exp 17) O- 0. 52 xdelta(exp 18) O) values of olivine and pyroxene in these chondrules show a peak at approx. 0. 7 % that are systematically lower than those of bulk chondrule analyses as well as the bulk LL chondrites [2]. Further analyses of glass in Semarkona chondrules show. 17 O values as high as + 5 % with highly fractionated d 18 O (max + 18 %), implying O- 16 -poor glass in chondrules were altered as a result of hydration in the parent body at low temperature [3]. Thus, chondrules in LL 3. 0 - 3. 1 chondrites do not provide any direct evidence of oxygen isotope exchange between solid precursor and O- 16 -depleted gas during chondrule melting events. To compare the difference and/or similarity between chondrules from LL and H chondrites, we initiated systematic investigations of oxygen isotopes in chondrules from Yamato 793408 (H 3. 2), one of the least equilibrated H chondrite [4]. In our preliminary study of 4 chondrules, we reported distinct oxygen isotope ratios from dusty olivine and <b>refractory</b> <b>forsterite</b> (RF) grains compared to their host chondrules and confirmed their relict origins [5]...|$|R

40|$|The Paris chondrite {{provides}} an excellent opportunity to study CM chondrules and refractory inclusions in a more pristine state than currently possible from other CMs, and to investigate the earliest stages of aqueous alteration captured within a single CM bulk composition. It {{was found in the}} effects of a former colonial mining engineer and may have been an observed fall. The texture, mineralogy, petrography, magnetic properties and chemical and isotopic compositions are consistent with classification as a CM 2 chondrite. There are ∼ 45 vol. % high-temperature components mainly Type I chondrules (with olivine mostly Fa 0 – 2, mean Fa 0. 9) with granular textures because of low mesostasis abundances. Type II chondrules contain olivine Fa 7 to Fa 76. These are dominantly of Type IIA, but there are IIAB and IIB chondrules, II(A) B chondrules with minor highly ferroan olivine, and IIA(C) with augite as the only pyroxene. The refractory inclusions in Paris are amoeboid olivine aggregates (AOAs) and fine-grained spinel-rich Ca–Al-rich inclusions (CAIs). The CAI phases formed in the sequence hibonite, perovskite, grossite, spinel, gehlenite, anorthite, diopside/fassaite and <b>forsterite.</b> The most <b>refractory</b> phases are embedded in spinel, which also occurs as massive nodules. Refractory metal nuggets are found in many CAI and refractory platinum group element abundances (PGE) decrease following the observed condensation sequences of their host phases. Mn–Cr isotope measurements of mineral separates from Paris define a regression line with a slope of 53 Mn/ 55 Mn = (5. 76 ± 0. 76) × 10 6. If we interpret Cr isotopic systematics as dating Paris components, particularly the chondrules, the age is 4566. 44 ± 0. 66 Myr, which is close to the age of CAI and puts new constraints on the early evolution of the solar system. Eleven individual Paris samples define an O isotope mixing line that passes through CM 2 and CO 3 falls and indicates that Paris is a very fresh sample, with variation explained by local differences in the extent of alteration. The anhydrous precursor to the CM 2 s was CO 3 -like, but the two groups differed in that the CMs accreted a higher proportion of water. Paris has little matrix (∼ 47 %, plus 8 % fine grained rims) and is less altered than other CM chondrites. Chondrule silicates (except mesostasis), CAI phases, submicron forsterite and amorphous silicate in the matrix are all well preserved in the freshest domains, and there is abundant metal preserved (metal alteration stage 1 of Palmer and Lauretta (2011)). Metal and sulfide compositions and textures correspond to the least heated or equilibrated CM chondrites, Category A of Kimura et al. (2011). The composition of tochilinite–cronstedtite intergrowths gives a PCP index of ∼ 2. 9. Cronstedtite is more abundant in the more altered zones whereas in normal highly altered CM chondrites, with petrologic subtype 2. 6 – 2. 0 based on the S/SiO 2 and ∑FeO/SiO 2 ratios in PCP or tochilinite–cronstedtite intergrowths (Rubin et al., 2007), cronstedtite is destroyed by alteration. The matrix in fresh zones has CI chondritic volatile element abundances, but interactions between matrix and chondrules occurred during alteration, modifying the volatile element abundances in the altered zones. Paris has higher trapped Ne contents, more primitive organic compounds, and more primitive organic material than other CMs. There are gradational contacts between domains of different degree of alteration, on the scale of ∼ 1 cm, but also highly altered clasts, suggesting mainly a water-limited style of alteration, with no significant metamorphic reheating...|$|R
