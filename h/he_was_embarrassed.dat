5|$|Clay, though embittered {{by another}} of his many defeats for the presidency, was appeased by Tyler's {{withdrawal}} from the still-unresolved Senate race, which would permit the election of Rives, and campaigned in Virginia for the Harrison/Tyler ticket. Tyler predicted the Whigs would easily take Virginia; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>embarrassed</b> when he was proved wrong, but was consoled by an overall victory—Harrison and Tyler won by an electoral vote of 234–60 and with 53 {{percent of the popular}} vote. Van Buren took only seven scattered states out of 26. The Whigs gained control of both houses of Congress.|$|E

Green went into practice at Jewish Hospital as an emergency physician, but grew dissatisfied and eventually switched specialties.

Following the expedition, he retired from his Virginia Regiment commission in December 1758. He did not return to military life until the outbreak of the revolution in 1775.|$|E

5|$|Leslie, Tom (Aziz Ansari), and Jerry join Carl {{to take a}} tour of {{the park}} where Jerry was mugged. Carl says the area is largely {{unprotected}} due to budget cuts, so Leslie vows to get more funding. She appears on Pawnee Today, the local news show, saying the Pawnee government failed the parks and that security is poor. Paul (Phil Reeves), the city manager, is angry over the television appearance, but informs Leslie the stunt worked and the mayor is offering $2,500 to help fix the park. While at a press conference about the money, Jerry confesses to Leslie that he wasn't mugged: he dropped a breakfast burrito in a creek, then fell while trying to grab it and dislocated his shoulder. He fabricated the mugger story because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>embarrassed</b> and didn't want everyone to make fun of him. Leslie angrily relates Jerry's story to Mark, but he stops her short when he says that Jerry was too scared of his co-workers to be honest with them. Leslie soon discovers Carl was offended by Leslie's statements about park security and plans to show footage of Jerry falling into the creek on Pawnee Today. Leslie negotiates with Carl to not show the event, and instead they talk during the show about how much they enjoyed the film Avatar, much to the anger of host Joan Callamezzo (Mo Collins). As part of their deal to not show the tape, Leslie buys Carl a brand new security cart. Carl hands over the tape, which she agrees to throw away after she watches it one last time. The office goes back to mocking Jerry, but with less venom than before, while Jerry confides that he doesn't really care because he's just two years away from retiring on a full pension and enjoying a peaceful retirement.|$|E

500|$|Many of Auden's poems {{during the}} 1930s and after were {{inspired}} by unconsummated love, and in the 1950s he summarised his emotional life in a famous couplet: [...] "If equal affection cannot be / Let the more loving one be me" [...] ("The More Loving One"). He had a gift for friendship and, starting in the late 1930s, a strong wish for the stability of marriage; {{in a letter to}} his friend James Stern he called marriage [...] "the only subject." [...] Throughout his life, Auden performed charitable acts, sometimes in public (as in his 1935 marriage of convenience to Erika Mann that provided her with a British passport to escape the Nazis), but, especially in later years, more often in private. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>embarrassed</b> if they were publicly revealed, as when his gift to his friend Dorothy Day for the Catholic Worker movement was reported on the front page of The New York Times in 1956.|$|E

500|$|Whitman was a vocal {{proponent of}} temperance {{and in his}} youth rarely drank alcohol. He once stated he did not taste [...] "strong liquor" [...] until he was 30 and {{occasionally}} argued for prohibition. One of his earliest long fiction works, the novel Franklin Evans; or, The Inebriate, first published November 23, 1842, is a temperance novel. Whitman wrote the novel {{at the height of}} popularity of the Washingtonian movement though the movement itself was plagued with contradictions, as was Franklin Evans. Years later Whitman claimed <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>embarrassed</b> by the book and called it [...] "damned rot". He dismissed it by saying he wrote the novel in three days solely for money while he was {{under the influence of alcohol}} himself. Even so, he wrote other pieces recommending temperance, including The Madman and a short story [...] "Reuben's Last Wish". Later in life he was more liberal with alcohol, enjoying local wines and champagne.|$|E
500|$|Arnett Doctor {{told the}} story of Rosewood to print and {{television}} reporters from all over the world. He raised the number of historic residents in Rosewood, as well as the number who died at the Carrier house siege; he exaggerated the town's contemporary importance by comparing it to Atlanta, Georgia as a cultural center. Doctor wanted to keep Rosewood in the news; his accounts were printed with few changes. According to historian Thomas Dye, Doctor's [...] "forceful addresses to groups across the state, including the NAACP, together with his many articulate and heart-rending television appearances, placed intense pressure on the legislature... to do something about Rosewood". In December 1996, Doctor told a meeting at Jacksonville Beach that 30 women and children had been buried alive at Rosewood, and that his facts had been confirmed by journalist Gary Moore. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>embarrassed</b> to learn that Moore was in the audience. As the Holland & Knight law firm continued the claims case, they represented 13 survivors, people who had lived in Rosewood {{at the time of the}} 1923 violence, in the claim to the legislature.|$|E
500|$|Hall also {{enacted a}} {{complete}} {{reform of the}} electoral system. [...] <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>embarrassed</b> that the LCL {{was in a position}} to win government despite having clearly lost the first-preference vote, and was committed to a fairer electoral system. [...] The reforms were significant, but did not go as far as the change to [...] "one vote one value" [...] that Labor and Dunstan had demanded. The lower house formerly had 39 seats—13 in Adelaide and 26 in the country. Now, 47 seats were to be contested: 28 in Adelaide and 19 in the country. [...] While there was still a slight rural weighting (since Adelaide accounted for two-thirds of the state's population), with Adelaide now electing a majority of the legislature, historical results made a Labor win at the next election likely. [...] Under the Playmander, Labor usually dominated Adelaide. [...] In most years, the LCL won almost no seats in the capital outside of the wealthy eastern crescent and around Holdfast Bay. [...] Under the circumstances, conventional wisdom was that Hall undertook electoral reform knowing he was effectively handing the premiership to Dunstan at the next election.|$|E
