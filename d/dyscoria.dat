50|$|Mydriatic/cycloplegic agents, such as topical homatropine, {{which is}} similar in action to atropine, are useful in {{breaking}} and preventing the formation of posterior synechia by keeping the iris dilated {{and away from the}} crystalline lens. Dilation of the pupil in an eye with the synechia can cause the pupil to take an irregular, non-circular shape (<b>Dyscoria)</b> as shown in the photograph. If the pupil can be fully dilated during the treatment of iritis, the prognosis for recovery from synechia is good. This is a treatable status.|$|E
40|$|<b>Dyscoria</b> {{was noted}} in a female owl monkey and 2 of her {{offspring}}. The third offspring was found dead with necrohemorrhagic encephalitis. Two male monkeys paired with the female died, 1 of which showed oral ulcers at necropsy. Histologic examination of the oral ulcers revealed syncytia and eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies in epithelial cells. Ocular examination revealed posterior synechia associated with the <b>dyscoria</b> in all 3 animals. Serum samples from the female and her offspring were positive for Herpesvirus simplex antibodies by ELISA. The clinical history, gross and microscopic lesions, and serology results suggests a herpesviral etiology, possibly H. simplex or H. saimiri 1. This report underscores {{the risks associated with}} introducing into breeding or research colonies animals that previously were kept as pets or those from unknown origin that could carry asymptomatic pathogenic Herpesvirus infections. In addition, herpesviral infection should be considered among the differential diagnoses if <b>dyscoria</b> is noted in nonhuman primates...|$|E
40|$|Most {{primates}} {{carry their}} own Herpesvirus species, which normally do not cause clinical disease {{in their natural}} host. However, when these viruses infect a different primate species, they can cause significant clinical disease or even death. 1 Clinical signs and lesions {{vary depending on the}} species of Herpesvirus and primate involved. In the case of α herpesviruses, clinical signs commonly include localized vesicles and ulcers affect-ing the skin, oral mucosa, conjunctiva, and external genitalia; encephalitis and disseminated fatal disease also have been observed in some cases. 1 Ocular lesions, mainly keratitis, 1, 13 have been described, and anisocoria has been reported recently. 8 However, to our knowledge, <b>dyscoria</b> ascribed to herpesvirus infection in humans or nonhuman primates has not previously been reported. Here we describe <b>dyscoria</b> associated with a herpesviral infection in an owl monkey colony...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOcular opacity, {{associated}} with reluctance {{to move and}} inability to feed properly, was observed in approximately 1 % of all newly hatched females from several related flocks of Mulard ducks. A 5 -week follow-up study of ten 1 -day-old affected females was performed, and they were compared with 10 control animals. Clinical, ocular and ultrasonographic examinations, a complete necropsy of 2 animals per group with histological examination of the eye, were performed weekly. A bilateral immature cortical anterior cataract was diagnosed at ocular examination and confirmed by ultrasonography in affected ducks. <b>Dyscoria</b> was occasionally observed in affected animals. Severe cataract, with Morgagnian globules, severe anterior fibre liquefaction and disorganisation were observed by photonic microscopy. No retinal or choroidal lesions were observed. No progression of ultrasonographic and microscopic lesions could be detected during the five weeks of examination. The female predisposition for the ocular lesions suggests a congenital sex-linked recessive cataract...|$|E
40|$|Many {{types of}} herpesviruses {{have been found}} in {{different}} non-human primate species causing sub-clinical or mild infection on its natural hosts and more severe infections, when transmitted to other species. The herpesviruses’ Family is composed by three subfamilies: Alphaherpesvirinae, Betaherpesvirinae e Gammaherpesvirinae. The herpesviruses have the capacity to remain dormant and vary its cell specificity. They can cause systemic and vesicular diseases on mucoses, depending on the hosts ’immune system, and it’s infections cause as much antibody as cell imune-mediated responses. The herpesviruses can present zoonotic potential and its diagnose can be done through sorology, virus isolation, PCR and histopathological exams. The herpesvirusis in non-human primates cause vesicular lesions and in some cases, <b>dyscoria.</b> Therefore, the inclusion of herpesvirusis as differential diagnosis is recommended. In the same way, the professional performance of veterinarians or public health agents are very important for prophylactic and therapy measures...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Pericentric {{inversion}} of chromosome 6 (6 p+q-) {{was found in}} a girl with Rieger's syndrome and in her father. The only ocular signs in the father were prominent iris mounds and Schwalbe's line. The association of chromosomal anomalies with Rieger's syndrome indicates the need for a chromosome banding test in familial or sporadic patients with the syndrome and in patients with mild anomalies of the anterior chamber angle. Rieger's syndrome is characterised by mesodermal anomalies of the anterior chamber angle and facial, dental, and musculoskeletal malformations. Major ocular abnormalities include hypoplasia of the anterior iris stroma, a prominent Schwalbe's line (posterior embryotoxon), and large peripheral an-terior synechiae stretching from the peripheral and mid portions of the iris (Waring et al., 1975). Abnormalities of the iris such as polycoria and <b>dyscoria</b> and secondary corneal anomalies such as microcornea and macrocornea occur frequently (Waring et al., 1975). On the basis of an extensive review of 175 patients Alkemade (1969) concluded that Rieger's anomaly is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern in 70 % of cases, while 30 % are thought to arise as isolated events (Alkemade, 1969). Thus, spontaneous or transmitted mutations associated with chromosomal anomalies may occur in Rieger's syndrome. Tabbara et al. (1973) reported the case of a young man with Rieger's syndrome associated with an extra metacentric chromosome. A case of Rieger's syndrome with associated inverted chromosome 6 in a young girl is presented here. Similar chromo-somal anomalies were found in the father, who presented minimal mesodermal anomalies of the anterior chamber angle.
