5|$|Danny {{is notable}} for its extreme rainfall, the tornadoes {{generated}} by it, {{and the destruction}} it produced on its path, causing a total of nine fatalities and $ (1997USD, $ USD) in damage. The storm dropped a record amount of rainfall for Alabama, as at least 36.71inches (932mm) fell on Dauphin Island. Flooding, power outages, and erosion occurred <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gulf Coast, and rescues had to be executed from flooded roadways. Tornadoes generated by Danny on the East Coast caused {{a great amount of}} damage. Of the nine fatalities caused by Danny, one happened off the coast of Alabama, four occurred in Georgia, two occurred in South Carolina, and two occurred in North Carolina.|$|E

5|$|During {{the last}} decade of the 19th century, {{minerals}} such as gold were mined with limited success. The last mine was abandoned in 1907, but panning for gold is still allowed <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forest, and in most circumstances no permit is required. After the end of the mining era, numerous camps were established by the Civilian Conservation Corps to help combat unemployment during the Great Depression of the 1930s. The camps housed groups of unemployed men who were paid by the federal government to build roads, hiking trails, and campgrounds for future travelers to the Yellowstone region. Visitation to national forests like Shoshone increased dramatically after World War II with the advent of better roads and accessibility to the region.|$|E
5|$|Groundwater {{levels have}} been dropping, to varying degrees, <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city, {{due in part}} to an {{increase}} in the amount of rainwater discharged directly into sewers rather than absorbed by the ground. A city agency, the Boston Groundwater Trust, coordinates monitoring of groundwater levels throughout the city via a network of public and private monitoring wells. However, Boston's drinking water supply, from the Quabbin and Wachusett Reservoirs to the west, is {{one of the very few}} in the country so pure as to satisfy federal water quality standards without filtration.|$|E

5|$|Laws {{have been}} passed <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world to protect bears from habitat destruction. Public {{perception}} of bears is often positive, as people identify with bears due to their omnivorous diets, their ability to stand on two legs, and their symbolic importance. Support for bear protection is widespread, at least in more affluent societies. Where bears raid crops or attack livestock, they may come into conflict with humans. In poorer rural regions, attitudes may be more shaped by the dangers posed by bears and the economic costs they cause to farmers and ranchers.|$|E
5|$|South Dakota's varied {{geography}} is inhabited by {{many species of}} birds. The state bird, the ring-necked pheasant, has adapted particularly well to the area after being introduced from China, and growing populations of bald eagles are spread throughout the state, especially near the Missouri River. The wild turkey is another large bird found <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state. The numerous lakes and wetlands of eastern South Dakota support migratory populations of Canada geese, snow geese, mallards, pelicans, and wood ducks. The prairie serves as home to songbirds such as meadowlarks (both the eastern and western varieties), goldfinches, and bluebirds, and the open landscape of the plains also suits many carnivorous birds, such as hawks, falcons, and owls.|$|E
5|$|The {{man-made}} chemical perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) may be compromising {{the immune system}} of bottlenose dolphins.

High levels of metal contaminants have been measured in tissues <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> globe. A recent study found high levels of cadmium and mercury in bottlenose dolphins from South Australia, levels which were later found to be associated with kidney malformations, indicating possible health effects of high heavy metal concentrations in dolphins.|$|E

5|$|Leeds' {{growth in}} the 19th century led to mass {{migration}} to the city; this resulted <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city becoming overcrowded and many new houses being built. The industrial revolution led {{to the increase in}} both working and middle classes, leading to the building of many new houses, aimed at both classes. The most common form of housing to be built for the working classes was the 'back to back'. Back to back terrace houses were built in the largely working class districts of Harehills, Holbeck, Hunslet, Beeston and Armley, whilst larger through terrace houses were built for the middle classes in Headingley and Kirkstall. Chapeltown developed as an affluent district of Leeds, and boasts many large Victorian villas, however the popularity of outer suburbs such as Roundhay towards the late 20th century brought land values down in Chapeltown and the area fell into decline.|$|E
5|$|The North American {{river otter}} is {{considered}} a species of least concern according to the IUCN Red List, as it is not currently declining at a rate sufficient for a threat category. By the early 1900s, river otter populations had declined throughout large portions of their historic range in North America. However, improvements in water quality (through enactment of clean water regulations) and furbearer management techniques have permitted river otters to regain portions of their range in many areas. Reintroduction projects have been particularly valuable in restoring populations <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States. However, river otters remain rare or absent in the southwestern United States. Water quality and development inhibit recovery of populations in some areas. The species is widely distributed throughout its range. In many places, the populations have re-established themselves because of conservation initiatives. Reintroduction of river otters may present a problem in that it may contaminate the genetic structure of the native population.|$|E
5|$|The code of Mongol law, {{known as}} the Yassa ("Great Law"), decreed strict rules and punishments <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mongolian Empire's society, {{especially}} those areas concerning trade and commerce. The Yassa helped suppress the traditional causes of tribal feuding and war, thus helping to ensure a peaceful trading and travelling environment; theft and animal rustling were outlawed, and the Mongol Empire under Genghis Khan even established a massive lost-and-found system. Harsh penalties including a retribution of nine times the original value of stolen goods helped deter theft on Mongol roads. The Yassa also decreed complete religious freedom, ensuring that Buddhists, Muslims, Christians, etc., were all allowed to travel freely throughout the empire; religious leaders were also exempted from taxation, as were doctors, lawyers, undertakers, teachers, and scholars. The Yassa did allow for flexibility and it usually adapted, absorbed, or built upon legal systems in remote parts of the empire, thus maintaining a level of openness to various societies and ensuring peace and stability.|$|E

In some places physicians are required by law to report if a person has had a seizure to the licensing body while in others the requirement is only that they encourage the person in question to report it themselves. Countries that require physician reporting include Sweden, Austria, Denmark and Spain. Countries that require the individual to report include the UK and New Zealand and the physician may report if they believe the individual has not already. In Canada, the United States and Australia the requirements around reporting vary by province or state. If seizures are well controlled most feel allowing driving is reasonable. The amount of time a person must be free from seizures before they can drive varies by country. Many countries require one to three years without seizures. In the United States the time needed without a seizure is determined by each state and is between three months and one year.|$|E
