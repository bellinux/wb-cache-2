5|$|Despite their {{relatively}} smaller brains {{compared to}} other primates, lemurs have demonstrated levels of technical intelligence in problem solving that are comparable to those seen in simians. However, their social intelligence differs, often emphasizing within-group competition over cooperation, which {{may be due to}} adaptations for their unpredictable environment. Although lemurs have not been observed using objects as tools in the wild, they can be trained to use objects as tools in captivity and demonstrate a basic understanding about the <b>functional</b> <b>properties</b> of the objects they are using.|$|E
5|$|The well-studied CAS {{proteins}} BCAR1 and NEDD9 {{have important}} roles in cancer and other pathological conditions, which have been addressed in many studies and reviews. EFS has attracted less study. However, the conserved <b>functional</b> <b>properties</b> of EFS relevant to cellular adhesion and migration, and RTK signaling, suggest changes in activity of this protein may also be relevant to cancer and other disease states, influencing prognosis and therapeutic response. The changes in EFS expression and post-translational modification {{in the context of}} disease discussed below are summarized in Table 2.|$|E
5|$|Since tool use is {{considered}} to be a key feature of primate intelligence, the apparent lack of this behavior in wild lemurs, as well as the lack of non-food object play, has helped reinforce the perception that lemurs are less intelligent than their simian cousins. However, another study at the Myakka City Lemur Reserve examined the representation of tool functionality in both the ring-tailed lemur and the common brown lemur and discovered that, like monkeys, they used tools with <b>functional</b> <b>properties</b> (e.g., tool orientation or ease of use) instead of tools with nonfunctional features (e.g., color or texture). Although the ring-tailed lemur may not use tools in the wild, it can not only be trained to use a tool, but will preferentially select tools based on their functional qualities. Therefore, the conceptual competence to use a tool may have been present in the common primate ancestor, even though the use of tools may not have appeared until much later.|$|E
30|$|Inverse <b>{{property}}</b> and <b>functional</b> <b>property</b> {{are taken}} into consideration. <b>Functional</b> <b>property</b> means the property has {{no more than one}} output value. For example, a spa shop has one unique ID. Similarly, it is an inverse <b>functional</b> <b>property.</b> Thus, we can infer that two spa shops cannot have the same ID. The other characteristics are symmetric property. Transitive property creates the inferences between two properties. For instance, Chiva-Som is in Hua Hin and Hua in is in Prachuap Kirikun province. Thus, Chiva-Som is in Prachuap Kirikun province.|$|R

My discussions of <b>functional</b> <b>property</b> will also help dispel the worry about the alleged cases of contingent identity with regard to theoretical statements in science.

5|$|What {{all these}} {{different}} varieties of functionalism share in common is the thesis that mental states are characterized by their causal relations with other mental states and with sensory inputs and behavioral outputs. That is, functionalism abstracts away from {{the details of the}} physical implementation of a mental state by characterizing it in terms of non-mental <b>functional</b> <b>properties.</b> For example, a kidney is characterized scientifically by its functional role in filtering blood and maintaining certain chemical balances. From this point of view, it does not really matter whether the kidney be made up of organic tissue, plastic nanotubes or silicon chips: it is the role that it plays and its relations to other organs that define it as a kidney.|$|E

25|$|The profuse binding of ricin {{to surface}} {{membranes}} allows internalization with {{all types of}} membrane invaginations. The holotoxin can be taken up by clathrin-coated pits, {{as well as by}} clathrin-independent pathways including caveolae and macropinocytosis. Intracellular vesicles shuttle ricin to endosomes that are delivered to the Golgi apparatus. The active acidification of endosomes is thought to have little effect on the <b>functional</b> <b>properties</b> of ricin. Because ricin is stable over a wide pH range, degradation in endosomes or lysosomes offers little or no protection against ricin. Ricin molecules are thought to follow retrograde transport via early endosomes, the trans-Golgi network, and the Golgi to enter the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).|$|E

25|$|Reverse {{genetics}} is {{a powerful}} tool to study and characterize the previously unknown viral genes. Reverse genetics system is currently available for VHSV. A vaccinia virus free reverse genetic system for Great Lakes VHSV (Genotype IVb) was developed by a research group from the USA. This system allows the investigators to explore the <b>functional</b> <b>properties</b> of individual viral genes of VHSV in detail. This system was immediately utilized to characterize the non-virion (NV) gene of novirhabdoviruses. Even though it has been demonstrated that the NV gene is not necessary for viral replication, it is highly essential for viral pathogenesis. A new role of NV protein has been discovered and demonstrated that it inhibits apoptosis at the early stage of viral infection. This discovery unlocked the mystery of presence of NV proteins in novirhabdoviruses.|$|E

All these factors contribute {{to the formation of}} what is known as a glial scar, which axons cannot grow across. The proximal segment attempts to regenerate after injury, but its growth is hindered by the environment. It {{is important to note that}} central nervous system axons have been proven to regrow in permissive environments; therefore, the primary problem to central nervous system axonal regeneration is crossing or eliminating the inhibitory lesion site. Another problem is that the morphology and <b>functional</b> <b>properties</b> of central nervous system neurons are highly complex, for this reason a neuron cannot be functionally replaced by one of another type (Llinás' law).|$|E

"The {{sequences}} of many proteins contain short, conserved motifs {{that are involved}} in recognition and targeting activities, often separate from other <b>functional</b> <b>properties</b> of the molecule in which they occur.

2500|$|One of the {{fundamental}} principles underlying neuroplasticity {{is based on the}} idea that individual synaptic connections are constantly being removed or recreated, largely dependent upon the activity of the neurons that bear them. The activity-dependence of synaptic plasticity is captured in the aphorism which is often used to summarize Hebbian theory: [...] "neurons that fire together, wire together"/"neurons that fire out of sync, fail to link". If two nearby neurons often produce an impulse in close temporal proximity, their <b>functional</b> <b>properties</b> may converge. Conversely, neurons that are not regularly activated simultaneously may be less likely to functionally converge.|$|E
2500|$|Organic cofactors are {{sometimes}} further divided into coenzymes and prosthetic groups. The term coenzyme refers specifically to enzymes and, as such, to the <b>functional</b> <b>properties</b> of a protein. On the other hand, [...] "prosthetic group" [...] emphasizes {{the nature of}} the binding of a cofactor to a protein (tight or covalent) and, thus, refers to a structural property. Different sources give slightly different definitions of coenzymes, cofactors, and prosthetic groups. Some consider tightly bound organic molecules as prosthetic groups and not as coenzymes, while others define all non-protein organic molecules needed for enzyme activity as coenzymes, and classify those that are tightly bound as coenzyme prosthetic groups. It should be noted that these terms are often used loosely.|$|E

It {{is in fact}} the base-point [...] from which jets derive their functional dependency. Thus, by varying the base-point, a jet yields a polynomial of order at most k at every point. This marks an important conceptual distinction between jets and truncated Taylor series: ordinarily a Taylor series is regarded as depending functionally on its variable, rather than its base-point. Jets, on the other hand, separate the algebraic properties of Taylor series from their <b>functional</b> <b>properties.</b> We shall deal with the reasons and applications of this separation later in the article.|$|E
