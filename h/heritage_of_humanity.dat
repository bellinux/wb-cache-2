5|$|A {{challenge}} to world conscience {{was provided by}} an influential 1968 article by Garrett Hardin that critically analyzed the dilemma in which multiple individuals, acting independently after rationally consulting self-interest (and, he claimed, the apparently low 'survival-of-the-fittest' value of conscience-led actions) ultimately destroy a shared limited resource, even though each acknowledges such an outcome is not in anyone's long-term interest. Hardin's conclusion that commons areas are practicably achievable only in conditions of low population density (and so their continuance requires state restriction on the freedom to breed), created controversy additionally through his direct deprecation {{of the role of}} conscience in achieving individual decisions, policies and laws that facilitate global justice and peace, as well as sustainability and sustainable development of world commons areas, for example including those officially designated such under United Nations treaties (see common <b>heritage</b> <b>of</b> <b>humanity).</b> Areas designated common <b>heritage</b> <b>of</b> <b>humanity</b> under international law include the Moon, Outer Space, deep sea bed, Antarctica, the world cultural and natural heritage (see World Heritage Convention) and the human genome. It will be a significant challenge for world conscience that as world oil, coal, mineral, timber, agricultural and water reserves are depleted, there will be increasing pressure to commercially exploit common heritage of mankind areas.|$|E

5|$|Since {{classical}} antiquity, {{the area}} around Kvarner Bay has been characterized as a meeting point of diverse cultures—from Hellenic and Roman cultures, through the Middle Ages and a succession of various rulers, to the present day. This blending {{is reflected in the}} folklore of the area, including Zvončari—bell-ringers best known for annual pageant in Kastav, listed on UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural <b>Heritage</b> <b>of</b> <b>Humanity.</b> Crossbowmen from Rab are a living history company reenacting an arbalest tournament first held in 1364 to commemorate the successful defence of the island using that weapon. A typical decorative motif used in the region is morčić (plural: morčići)—a dark skinned Moor used as a centerpiece on jewelry, usually earrings. Legend has it that the motif is related to a hypothesized battle between Croatian and Ottoman armies on Grobnik north of Rijeka, but {{it is more likely that}} it is of Venetian origin, as it is similar to the Venetian moretti motif, used mostly on brooches and pins.|$|E

Annexed into Imperial Japan in 1910, Korea was divided after its surrender in 1945, but a North Korean invasion led to the Korean War (1950-1953). Peace has since mostly continued with the two agreeing to work peacefully for reunification and the South solidifying peace as a regional power with the world's 10th largest defence budget.|$|R

50|$|ICH has {{recently}} drawn international attention {{because of its}} immeasurable contributions to the enhancement of human creativity and cultural diversity. However, ICH of each country has been disappearing rapidly as modernization and industrialization processes within each country were intensified. In particular, ICH {{is not easy to}} preserve and protect from destruction due to its immaterial and formless nature. It exists in people’s memory, ideas, and everyday practices. UNESCO has strenuously made efforts to establish safeguarding measures of ICH throughout the world due to distinctive characteristics of ICH. UNESCO’s initiatives signify its view of ICH as the common cultural <b>heritages</b> <b>of</b> <b>humanity.</b> As part <b>of</b> such initiatives, UNESCO announced the Convention for the safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2003. The Convention specifies safeguarding measures additionally proclaimed by the directives of ICH and related guidelines. Of the safeguarding methods, inventories are very important ways in which the intangible heritage community members can raise awareness <b>of</b> their cultural <b>heritage.</b> According to UNESCO, the process of inventorying ICH enhances the self-respect <b>of</b> <b>heritage</b> bearers and their respective communities and enriches human creativity. The Convention encourages the involvement of state parties in creating inventories of ICH existing in their territories and providing regular updates of any existing inventories. Updating of inventories is an ongoing process that can never be fully completed. The Convention allows some flexibility for the state parties in utilizing their own methods in inventory-making.|$|R
40|$|The {{protection}} of minorities in modern international law is intimately connected with and fuelled {{the recognition of the}} crimes of persecution and genocide. Minority protection represented the proactive component of the international efforts to ensure the contribution of certain groups to the cultural <b>heritage</b> <b>of</b> humankind. Prohibition and prosecution of persecution and genocide represented the reactive element of these same efforts. The restitution of cultural property to persecuted groups by the international community was recognition that their ownership and control of these physical manifestations was necessary for the realization of this purpose. In this article, I consider the emergence, contraction, and revival of the interconnection between minority protection, the prevention and punishment of genocide, and the protection and restitution <b>of</b> cultural <b>heritage</b> over the last century-long development of international law. It is argued that the central aim driving and interweaving these initiatives is the effort to ensure the continuing contribution of each group to the cultural <b>heritage</b> <b>of</b> all <b>humanity...</b>|$|R
40|$|Master of EducationKieran Egan has {{suggested}} a stage theory {{for education in}} which the student moves through four periods of development. The theory is predicated upon a notion of education being {{a particular type of}} discipline, different from other areas of study such as philosophy and psychology. The difference, according to Egan, is found in the definition of education as a cultural act. The dominance of psychologists like Piaget and theorists like Dewey has, according to Egan, allowed non-educational theories and practices to erode the proper function of education, that being the creation of a particular type of person. That type of person would be best described as having the characteristics of Egan's "Ironic" scholar, a person with intelligence, humanity and acceptance. Egan also suggests a particular curriculum and teaching methodology in the light of his stage theory. This curriculum is based on the cultural <b>heritage</b> <b>of</b> <b>humanity's</b> quest for enlightenment. The methodology used is to present this cultural heritage in story-form so that it engages children's interest. The story-form is also the most appropriate manner of presenting information to children because information is most easily understood in that format. Egan is critical of current trends in education which, he claims, tend to be destructive of its true function. Empiricism and socialization, according to Egan, have caused education to become mundane and soulless. Education needs to be redefined and theories need to be relevant and pertinent to the process of education. Egan's theory does serve to centre debate about education. His thoughts on educational development and methodology, although salutory, are at times idiosyncratic. His rejection of empiricism in education tends to make his ideas problematic.

50|$|Fifty countries, in {{the middle}} of the Cold War, contributed funds to save the monuments now {{considered}} part <b>of</b> the <b>heritage</b> <b>of</b> all <b>humanity.</b> Philae, Kalabsha, Wadi al-Sabua, Dakka, Derr and other sites were moved, with the temples of Abu Simbel receiving the most media attention. The temple of Amada was a difficult case, because of its small, beautifully painted reliefs. Chopping it into blocks, as was being done with the other temples, was not an option; the paintings would not have survived. Seeing that all seemed resigned to see the temple flooded by the silty waters of Lake Nasser, Christiane Desroches Noblecourt announced that France would save it. She asked two architects to propose a method for moving the temple in one piece. Their idea was to put the temple on rails and transport it hydraulically to a site a few kilometers away that was more than 60 meters higher. (needs citation).|$|R
