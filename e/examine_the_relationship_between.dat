25|$|A 2001 study, {{conducted}} by Aagaard et al., utilized MRI, ultrasonography and muscle biopsy techniques to <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> muscle architecture, contractile strength and pennation angle {{in the human}} quadriceps muscle after 14 weeks of resistance training. Upon completion of the training program, Aagaard et al. noticed a symmetrical increase in quadriceps CSA and volume, as each increased 10.2 and 10.3 percent respectively; however, these parameters increased disproportionately to quadriceps PCSA, which grew 16 percent. The rapid increase in PCSA {{was accompanied by a}} 35.5% increase in the fascicle pennation angle of the vastus lateris, one of the major quadriceps muscles, as well as a 16% increase in myofiber CSA. The increase in pennation angle in the vastus lateris resulted in an increase to the muscle’s PCSA, a measure proportional to the contractile force a pennate muscle is capable of producing. Work by Azizi et al. suggests this increase in pennation angle of the vastus lateris following resistance training generates an increase in the muscle’s AGR, a property which allows the whole muscle to contract with a higher velocity.|$|E

25|$|Long-term {{decreasing}} {{rates in}} fertility and increasing life expectancy could have damaging consequences for almost every European nation. One consequence of ageing might be lower inflation rates as elderly {{people are more}} inflation averse and have sufficient political power for governments to care about their preferences. These demographic trends provoked debate over the best policies that can reverse these trends and lessen their consequences. RAND Europe, an independent not-for-profit research institute, was able to collect these policies through research and analysis. There were three broad policy approaches that were generated from the debate. The first policy is to encourage childbearing among younger couples that involves marriage and cohabitation. The second policy states {{that there should be}} an increase in the immigration of working-age people. Thirdly, there should be an improvement of social policy in general, to mitigate negative consequences of these trends. The research intends to <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> demographic trends and European government policies and determine which policies can reduce the consequences of low fertility and population ageing.|$|E

500|$|Keynes {{had begun}} a {{theoretical}} work to <b>examine</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> unemployment, money and prices {{back in the}} 1920s. The work, Treatise on Money, was published in 1930 in two volumes. A central idea of the work was that if {{the amount of money}} being saved exceeds the amount being invested – which can happen if interest rates are too high – then unemployment will rise. This is in part a result of people not wanting to spend too high a proportion of what employers pay out, making it difficult, in aggregate, for employers to make a profit. Another key theme of the book is the unreliability of financial indices for representing an accurate – or indeed meaningful – indication of general shifts in purchasing power of currencies over time. In particular he criticised the justification of Britain's return to the gold standard in 1925 at pre-war valuation by reference to the wholesale price index. He argued that the index understated the effects of changes in the costs of services and of labour. In 1927 he wrote, [...] "We will not have any more crashes in our time." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, with {{advancement}} of biomedical sciences, {{a number of}} molecular markers in blood, other biospecimens and environment were identified as predictors of development or risk of a certain disease.

Genetic variation is typically determined using DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes. Since the 2000s, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been commonly performed to identify genetic risk factors for many diseases and health conditions.|$|E
