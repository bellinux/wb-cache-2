5|$|On 7 August 1936, France {{unilaterally}} declared non-intervention. Draft declarations {{had been}} put to the German and Italian governments. Such a declaration had already been accepted by the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, Poland, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, which renounced all traffic in war material, direct or indirect. The Portuguese Foreign Minister, Armindo Monteiro, was also asked to accept, but <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b> An ultimatum was put to Yvon Delbos by the British: halt French exports to Spain, or Britain would not be obliged to act under the Treaty of Locarno if Germany invaded; on 9 August, exports were duly suspended. However, collections for food, clothing and medical supplies to the Spanish Republicans continued. On 9 August, the Germans informed the British that 'no war materials had been sent from Germany and none will', which was blatantly false. During the blockade of the Strait of Gibraltar by the Spanish Republican Navy one German Junkers was captured {{when it came down}} in Republican territory, and explained as 'merely a transport aircraft'. Its release would be required before Germany signed the Non-Intervention Pact. Portugal accepted the pact on 13 August, unless her border was threatened by the war.|$|E

This was following Johnson's 76th Cup Series win, which tied the career mark of Earnhardt's. This is also the track where Earnhardt claimed his sixth Winston Cup Series title.|$|E
25|$|In 221, after Sun Quan pledged {{allegiance}} to Wei again, Zhang Liao was relocated from Hefei to the garrison at Yongqiu (雍丘; present-day Qi County, Henan), where he contracted an illness. When Cao Pi learnt that Zhang Liao was ill, he sent Liu Ye to visit Zhang and bring along an imperial physician to treat Zhang. He also ordered the huben guards {{to serve as}} messengers to constantly update him on Zhang Liao's condition – {{to the point where}} these messengers frequently encountered each other along the way while they were travelling between Cao Pi and Zhang Liao's locations. Later on, before Zhang Liao had recovered, Cao Pi visited him, <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> gave him an imperial robe as a gift, and ordered his servants to prepare imperial cuisine for Zhang. Zhang Liao returned to the garrison after his condition improved significantly.|$|E

500|$|In the 1969 NBA Playoffs, the 55-win Lakers {{defeated}} the Atlanta Hawks and the San Francisco Warriors, {{setting up the}} sixth finals series versus Boston in eight years. Prior to Game 1, West privately complained to Bill Russell of exhaustion, but then the Lakers guard scored 53points on Boston in a close two-point win. L.A. also took Game 2, with West scoring 41points. In Game 3, Russell opted to double-team West, and the guard's exhaustion began to show: West twice asked to be subbed for longer periods, and both times the Lakers fell back by double digits and finally lost by sixpoints. Game 4 saw Celtics guard Sam Jones hit an off-balance buzzer beater to tie the series, but in Game 5, the Lakers struck back and won by 13points; however, they suffered a major blow when West – who scored 39points and by far led all players in scoring during the entire series – lunged for a meaningless late-game ball and seriously pulled his hamstring: it was immediately visible that the injury would not heal {{until the end of}} the series. A limping West scored 26points in Game 6, but the Celtics won 99–90 with a strong Bill Russell, who held Chamberlain to only eightpoints in the entire game. In Game 7, Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke had put up thousands of balloons in the rafters of the Forum in Los Angeles. This display of arrogance motivated the Celtics and angered West. The Lakers trailed the entire game and were behind 91-76 after 3 quarters, but powered by a limping West, the Lakers closed the gap to 103-102 with two minutes to go and had the ball. But West committed costly turnovers and L.A. lost the game 108–106 despite a triple-double of 42points, 13rebounds and 12assists from West, who became the only winner of the Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award from the losing team. After the loss, West was seen as the ultimate tragic hero: after the game, Bill Russell <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> and John Havlicek said: [...] "I love you, Jerry".|$|E

Writing in Esquire in 1966, Phillip K. Tompkins noted factual discrepancies after he traveled to Kansas and spoke to some of the same people interviewed by Capote. In a telephone interview with Tompkins, Mrs. Meier denied that she heard Perry cry and that she <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> as described by Capote.

2500|$|On August 30, 1987, Vanunu's trial opened. He {{was charged}} with treason, aggravated espionage, and {{collection}} of secret information with intent to impair state security. The trial, held in secret, {{took place in the}} Jerusalem District Court before Chief Justice Eliyahu Noam and Judges Zvi Tal and Shalom Brenner. Vanunu was initially represented by Amnon Zichroni, then by Avigdor Feldman, a prominent Israeli civil and human rights lawyer. The prosecutor was Uzi Hasson. Vanunu was not permitted contact with the media but he wrote the details of his abduction (or [...] "hijacking", as he put it) on the palm of his hand, and while being transported he <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> against the van's window so that waiting journalists could get the information.|$|E
2500|$|In March 1997, Diana visited South Africa, {{where she}} met with President Nelson Mandela. On 2 November 2002, Mandela {{announced}} that the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund would be teaming up with the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund to help victims of AIDS. They had planned {{the combination of the}} two charities a few months before her death. [...] "When she stroked the limbs of someone with leprosy or sat on the bed of a man with HIV/AIDS and <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> she transformed public attitudes and improved the life chances of such people," [...] Mandela said about the late Princess. Diana had used her celebrity status to [...] "fight stigma attached to people living with HIV/AIDS", Mandela said. In October 2017, the Attitude magazine honoured Diana with its Legacy Award for her HIV/AIDS work. Prince Harry accepted the award on behalf of his mother.|$|E

2500|$|In 225, when Xiahou Shang became {{critically}} ill, {{he had to}} be {{sent back}} to the Wei imperial capital, Luoyang, from his post in Jing Province.

Cao Pi honoured him with the posthumous title [...] "Marquis Dao" [...] (悼侯) and wrote an official eulogy for him: [...] "(Xiahou) Shang had been a close companion to me since my childhood. He was loyal, sincere and faithful. Although we did not have the same parents, we were as close as brothers. He was like my stomach and heart, and like claws and teeth to me. He was intelligent, perceptive and exceptionally brilliant. It is a pity that his life ended so early. Alas, such is life! I hereby grant him the posthumous appointment of Senior General Who Attacks the South and award him the seal of the Marquis of Changling." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Liu Yao was {{defeated}} by Sun Ce subsequently in battle, Taishi Ci originally planned to accompany Liu Yao as he fled to Yuzhang Commandery (豫章郡; around present-day Nanchang, Jiangxi) for shelter. However, Taishi Ci went into hiding in the hills at Wuhu County (蕪湖縣; east of present-day Wuhu, Anhui) and declared himself the Administrator (太守) of Danyang Commandery (丹楊郡). By then, Sun Ce had conquered the territories east of Xuancheng County (宣城縣; present-day Xuancheng, Anhui); only the six counties west of Jing County (涇縣; north of present-day Jing County, Anhui) remained outside of Sun Ce's control. Taishi Ci headed to Jing County, where he established a base and managed to recruit the Shanyue people to join him. Sun Ce personally led his forces to attack Taishi Ci, defeated him in battle, and captured him. Later, he released Taishi Ci from his bonds, <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> and asked, [...] "Do you still remember our fight at Shen Village? What {{would you do if}} you captured me?" [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "I can't be certain about this."

2500|$|When {{the war was}} {{declared}} and the two armies were facing each other, Arjuna realized {{that he would have}} to kill his dear great-granduncle (Bhishma), on whose lap he had played as a child and his respected teacher (Drona), who had <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> and taught him how to hold the bow and arrow, making him the greatest archer in the world. Arjuna felt weak and sickened at the prospect of killing his entire family, including his 100 cousins and friends such as Ashwatthama. Despondent and confused about [...] what is right and what is wrong, Arjuna turned to Krishna for divine advice and teachings. Krishna, who Arjuna chose as his charioteer, advised him of his duty. This conversation forms the Bhagavad Gita, one of the most respected religious and philosophical texts in the Hindu religion. Krishna instructs Arjuna not to yield to degrading impotence and to fight his kin, for that was the only way to righteousness. He also reminded him that this was a war between righteousness and unrighteousness (dharma and adharma) and it was Arjuna's duty to slay anyone who supported the cause of unrighteousness, or sin. Krishna then revealed his divine form and explained that he is born on earth in each aeon when evil raises its head. It also forms one of the foremost treatise on the several aspects of Yoga and mystical knowledge.|$|E

2500|$|Zhang Wen {{was from}} Wu County (吳縣), Wu Commandery (吳郡), {{which is in}} present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu. His father, Zhang Yun (張允), was famous in Wu Commandery for valuing {{friendship}} and having a low regard for material wealth. Zhang Yun also served as an Official in the East Bureau (東曹掾) under the warlord Sun Quan, who became the founding emperor of Eastern Wu later. At a young age, Zhang Wen was already known for his good moral conduct and for having a dignified appearance. When Sun Quan heard about him, he asked his subjects, [...] "As of now, who is Zhang Wen comparable to?" [...] Liu Ji, the Grand Prefect of Agriculture (大農令), said, [...] "He is comparable to Quan Cong." [...] However, Gu Yong, the Minister of Ceremonies (太常), had a different opinion, [...] "Liu Ji doesn't know him well enough. No one is comparable to Zhang Wen as of now." [...] Sun Quan said, [...] "If it is so, Zhang Yun must be still alive." [...] When Zhang Wen was summoned to the Wu court to meet Sun Quan and his subjects, he impressed them with his demeanour and his eloquent responses to their questions. As {{he was about to}} leave, Zhang Zhao <b>held</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> and said, [...] "I entrust my plans to you. You should understand what I mean."
