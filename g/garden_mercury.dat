When Scorponok's band of Decepticons arrived on the planet in close pursuit, Repugnus {{was one of the}} Autobots who fought back to save the local Nebulan population. He and his fellow Monsterbots fought a battle to save the Nebulan <b>Mercury</b> <b>Gardens</b> from the {{encroaching}} Decepticons, but were forced to retreat by the Decepticon Headmasters when they realised the damage their battle was doing.|$|R
5000|$|Altgeld Gardens is {{a housing}} {{community}} located in south Chicago {{that was built}} in 1945 on an abandoned landfill to accommodate returning African-American World War II veterans. Surrounded by 53 toxic facilities and 90% of the city's landfills, the Altgeld Gardens area became known as a [...] "toxic doughnut".

Introduced in the Headmasters four-issue miniseries, the three Monsterbots joined with Fortress Maximus and other like-minded Autobots who wanted to leave Cybertron in order to escape the war on the planet. Relocating to the world of Nebulos, they were {{followed}} by Scorponok's Decepticon forces, who began wreaking havoc on the planet after members of both factions bonded to Nebulan natives as [...] "Headmasters". Attempting to defend Nebulos's beautiful <b>Mercury</b> <b>Gardens</b> against a Decepticon attack, the Monsterbots were overpowered by the Decepticon Headmasters and forced to retreat. They later departed Nebulos with the rest of Maximus's team and were integrated into the larger Autobot army on Earth.|$|R

The north of the town has {{developed}} on London Clay and is situated as much as [...] above sea level. The town centre is {{for the most part}} contained within a ring road formed of St Edwards Way, <b>Mercury</b> <b>Gardens,</b> Thurloe Gardens, Oldchurch Road and Waterloo Road. The market place and much of South Street and the High Street are pedestrianised. The railway cuts through the town from east to west on a viaduct, with the bulk of the central Romford area to its north. The River Rom flows through the town in underground channels and joins the Thames after flowing through Hornchurch; elsewhere along its course it is known as the River Beam and forms part of the strategic waterways Blue Ribbon Network. Romford has formed part of the continuously built-up area of London since the 1930s and is contiguous with Rush Green to the west, Collier Row to the north, Gidea Park to the east and Hornchurch to the south east. The Romford post town covers all of the former municipal borough and extends over a much wider area, including parts of Barking and Dagenham and Epping Forest.
