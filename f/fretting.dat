5|$|Jack White's {{voice is}} a singular, evocative {{combination}} of punk, metal, blues, and backwoods while his guitar work is grand and banging with just enough lyrical touches of slide and subtle solo work... Meg White balances out the fretwork and the <b>fretting</b> with methodical, spare, and booming cymbal, bass drum, and snare... All D.I.Y. punk-country-blues-metal singer-songwriting duos should sound this good.|$|E
5|$|For La belle Hélène, Offenbach secured Hortense Schneider to {{play the}} title role. Since her early success in his short operas, {{she had become a}} leading star of the French musical stage. She now {{commanded}} large fees and was notoriously temperamental, but Offenbach was adamant that no other singer could match her as Hélène. Rehearsals for the premiere at the Théâtre des Variétés were tempestuous, with Schneider and the principal mezzo-soprano feuding, the censor <b>fretting</b> about the satire of the imperial court, and the manager of the theatre attempting to rein in Offenbach's extravagance with production expenses. Once again the success of the piece was inadvertently assured by the critic Janin; his scandalised notice was strongly countered by liberal critics and the ensuing publicity again brought the public flocking.|$|E
25|$|The {{solution}} {{to the issue of}} <b>fretting</b> is to use a metal based anti-seize lubricant; being composed of assorted mixtures of aluminium, copper, graphite and nickel powders in a grease base – that allows repeated assembly and disassembly without wear and the elimination of <b>fretting</b> corrosion during use.|$|E
50|$|When {{the zero}} <b>fret</b> {{is viewed as}} an {{extension}} of the fingerboard by adding one more <b>fret</b> wire before the nut, then the luthier would fit a <b>fret</b> wire of identical dimensions. This will decrease the string action at the lower <b>fret</b> positions. To avoid this effect, luthiers often use a thicker <b>fret</b> wire at the zero <b>fret</b> position. While the straight and level zero <b>fret</b> improves the tuning accuracy along the lower <b>frets</b> (from <b>fret</b> 1 to 3 mainly) the elevated <b>fret</b> keeps the string action higher and helps to avoid string buzz.|$|R
5000|$|The {{number of}} <b>frets</b> {{installed}} on a bass guitar neck may vary. The original Fender basses had 20 <b>frets,</b> and most bass guitars have between 20 and 24 <b>frets</b> or <b>fret</b> positions. Instruments with between 24 and 36 <b>frets</b> (2 and 3 octaves) also exist. Instruments with more <b>frets</b> {{are used by}} bassists who play bass solos, as more <b>frets</b> gives them additional upper range notes. When a bass has {{a large number of}} <b>frets,</b> such as a 36 <b>fret</b> instrument, the bass may have a deeper [...] "cutaway" [...] to enable the performer to reach the higher pitches. Like electric guitars, <b>fretted</b> basses typically have markers on the fingerboard and {{on the side of the}} neck to assist the player in determining where notes and important harmonic points are. The markers indicate the 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th <b>fret</b> and 12th <b>fret</b> (the 12th <b>fret</b> being the octave of the open string) and on the octave-up equivalents of the 3rd <b>fret</b> and as many additional positions as an instrument has <b>frets</b> for. Typically, one marker is used for the 3rd, 5th, 7th and 9th <b>fret</b> positions and two markers are used for the 12th <b>fret.</b>|$|R

25|$|Cross-note tunings {{include a}} minor third, so giving a minor chord with open strings. <b>Fretting</b> the minor-third string {{at the first}} fret {{produces}} a major-third, so allowing a one-finger <b>fretting</b> of a major chord. By contrast, {{it is more difficult}} to fret a minor chord using an open major-chord tuning.|$|E
25|$|One {{solution}} {{to the issue of}} <b>fretting</b> is to use a metal based anti-seize lubricant between the mating parts. Composed of assorted mixtures of aluminum, copper, graphite and nickel powders in a grease base, such lubrication allows repeated assembly and disassembly without wear and the elimination of <b>fretting</b> corrosion during use.|$|E
25|$|For the shear joint, {{a proper}} {{clamping}} {{force on the}} joint components prevents relative motion of those components and the <b>fretting</b> wear of those {{that could result in}} the development of fatigue cracks.|$|E
50|$|PRS's {{signature}} <b>fret</b> markers {{include the}} standard moon inlays and the optional and sought after birds, often fashioned from pearl or paua (abalone) shell. The moons appear similar to standard dot inlays, {{but have a}} crescent more prominent {{than the rest of}} the dot. The bird inlays feature representations of the following species; peregrine falcon (3rd <b>fret),</b> marsh hawk (5th <b>fret),</b> ruby throated hummingbird (7th <b>fret),</b> common tern (9th <b>fret),</b> Coopers hawk (12th <b>fret),</b> kite (15th <b>fret),</b> sparrow (17th <b>fret),</b> storm petrel (19th <b>fret),</b> a landing hawk (21st <b>fret)</b> and a screech owl on a branch (24-fret models only). 20th and 25th anniversary edition production models feature updated and stylized versions of this standard inlay.|$|R

5000|$|Neck/Fingerboard: This is {{wider than}} the {{standard}} guitar (ca. 6.5-7.5 cm), and frequently is fitted with only 8 <b>frets,</b> although some modern models are fully <b>fretted</b> with 18 or 19 <b>frets</b> like a modern classical guitar. Originally the <b>frets</b> were movable cords of gut, similar to the <b>frets</b> employed on Renaissance lutes, but modern instruments use metal <b>frets</b> like those found on guitars.|$|R
25|$|Other tunings exist, {{including}} cross-tunings, {{in which}} the usually doubled string runs are tuned to different pitches. Additionally, guitarists may sometimes tune a mandolin to mimic {{a portion of the}} intervals on a standard guitar tuning to achieve familiar <b>fretting</b> patterns.|$|E
25|$|His {{innovative}} talents {{extended into}} his playing style, including licks, trills, chording sequences, <b>fretting</b> techniques and timing, which set {{him apart from}} his contemporaries and inspired many guitarists of the present day. He recorded with his wife Mary Ford in the 1950s, and they sold millions of records.|$|E
25|$|The cranks are {{pressed into}} place and {{prevented}} from squirming off via <b>fretting</b> by a bolt or nut installed into or onto the bottom bracket spindle. The head of the bolt or the nut sits inside a counterbore that is also threaded to accept a crank puller tool. The counterbore is often covered with a dust cover.|$|E
50|$|The flat tops on the <b>frets</b> {{that result}} from the {{leveling}} process are removed to achieve good intonation and comfortable playing. A crowning file is used to remove material {{from the sides of}} the <b>fret,</b> creating a round shape to reduce the area of contact between the strings and the <b>fret.</b> The most common types of crowning files are triangular or concave. The very top of the <b>fret</b> is left untouched leaving a small flat strip along the <b>fret.</b> This creates the ideal <b>fret</b> shape, while leaving the top of the <b>fret</b> intact and keeping all of the <b>frets</b> at the same height.|$|R
40|$|Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (<b>FRET)</b> using {{fluorescent}} protein variants {{is widely}} used to study biochemical processes in living cells. <b>FRET</b> detection by fluorescence lifetime measurements is the most direct and robust method to measure <b>FRET.</b> The traditional cyan-yellow fluorescent protein based <b>FRET</b> pairs are getting replaced by green-red fluorescent protein variants. The green-red pair enables excitation at a longer wavelength which reduces cellular autofluorescence and phototoxicity while monitoring <b>FRET.</b> Despite the advances in <b>FRET</b> based sensors, the low <b>FRET</b> efficiency and dynamic range still complicates their use in cell biology and high throughput screening. In this paper, we utilized the higher lifetime of NowGFP and screened red fluorescent protein variants to develop <b>FRET</b> pairs with high dynamic range and <b>FRET</b> efficiency. The <b>FRET</b> variations were analyzed by proteolytic activity and detected by steady-state and time-resolved measurements. Based on the results, NowGFP-tdTomato and NowGFP-mRuby 2 have shown high potentials as <b>FRET</b> pairs with large fluorescence lifetime dynamic range. The in vitro measurements revealed that the NowGFP-tdTomato has the highest Förster radius for any fluorescent protein based <b>FRET</b> pairs yet used in biological studies. The developed <b>FRET</b> pairs will be useful for designing <b>FRET</b> based sensors and studies employing Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) ...|$|R
50|$|Both deep-neck and free-neck citoles are {{depicted}} in illustrations with <b>frets.</b> <b>Frets</b> are often shown in pairs (two <b>frets</b> to mark one {{position on the}} neck). The number of <b>fret</b> positions varies. One Cantigas de Santa Maria citole has four <b>frets,</b> the others five. The Robert de Lisle Psalter citole (deep neck with thumbhole) is depicted with five <b>frets.</b> The Queen Mary Psalter citoles appear to show five. The abby of St. Savin citole, the Lincoln Cathedral (stained glass) citole, and the Giorgiano painting citole show eight. As no instruments with <b>frets</b> have survived, {{the nature of the}} <b>frets</b> is conjecture. Choices include the use of stings tied around the neck as <b>frets</b> and some sort of permanently mounted <b>fret.</b> Most illustrations aren't detailed enough to know which is used. One exception is the Giorgiano painting, which shows the <b>fret</b> going {{all the way around the}} neck, tied string <b>frets.</b> The St. Savin deep-neck citole is also detailed and does not show strings going all the way around the neck. The Ducal Palace Studiolo Cittern/Citole shows cuts in the neck in place of <b>frets.</b>|$|R
25|$|Kenneth Ray Carllile (April 2, 1931July 31, 1987), {{better known}} as Thumbs Carllile (Carlisle in some collections), was an {{innovative}} American country music guitarist and songwriter known for his zither-style fingerstyle playing, sitting with his guitar in his lap while <b>fretting,</b> picking and strumming with his fingers and thumbs. He performed with Little Jimmy Dickens at the Grand Ole Opry in the early 1950s, {{and was a member}} of Roger Miller's band from 1964 to 1972.|$|E
25|$|He was {{the most}} zealous and untiring fieldsman I ever saw, {{the sort of man}} who, if {{standing}} or <b>fretting</b> at deep square-leg, might be relied upon to back up cover-point on an emergency. Who that has experienced it will ever forget the sound, as of a mighty rushing steam-engine behind him, as he went to fetch a fourer when Inglis was on the war-path! His activity in very sooth covered not only much ground, but a multitude of other people's sins.|$|E
25|$|The {{bottom bracket}} shell is a short and large {{diameter}} tube, relative to the other tubes in the frame, that runs side to side and holds the bottom bracket. It is usually threaded, often left-hand threaded on the right (drive) side of the bike to prevent loosening by <b>fretting</b> induced precession, and right-hand threaded on the left (non-drive) side. There are many variations, such as an eccentric bottom bracket, which allows for adjustment in tension of the bicycle's chain. It is typically larger, unthreaded, and sometimes split. The chain stays, seat tube, and down tube all typically connect to the {{bottom bracket shell}}.|$|E
50|$|Tap {{harmonic}} is {{a technique}} used with <b>fretted</b> string instruments, (usually guitar). It is executed by tapping on the actual <b>fret</b> wire, most commonly at the 12th <b>fret,</b> but also can be executed by tapping any of the <b>fret</b> wires with proper technique. It can also be done by gently touching the string over the <b>fret</b> wire instead of tapping the <b>fret</b> wire if the string is already ringing.|$|R
50|$|The zero <b>fret</b> is {{positioned}} at the location normally {{occupied by the}} nut. On a guitar having a zero <b>fret,</b> the nut is located behind the zero <b>fret</b> and serves solely to keep the strings spaced properly. The strings rest atop the zero <b>fret,</b> which can be higher than the other <b>frets.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A <b>fret</b> is {{a raised}} element {{on the neck}} of a {{stringed}} instrument. <b>Frets</b> usually extend across the full width of the neck. On most modern western <b>fretted</b> instruments, <b>frets</b> are metal strips inserted into the fingerboard. On some historical instruments and non-European instruments, <b>frets</b> are made of pieces of string tied around the neck.|$|R
25|$|Number 46 {{is unusual}} among the merchant's {{houses in the}} town centre in being two bays wide; most similar houses {{originally}} had only a single bay. The original house probably incorporated a shop on the ground floor. In the original plan, the two principal chambers {{would have been on}} the first floor. One of the first-floor rooms, now used as a café, {{is a good example of}} a living chamber with decoration dating from the early 17th century. The walls have full-height oak panelling topped with an Ionic frieze, and the ceiling has decorative plasterwork in the intervening spaces between the beams, featuring strapwork and <b>fretting.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{work done}} by {{friction}} can translate into deformation, wear, and heat that can affect the contact surface properties (even the coefficient of friction between the surfaces). This can be beneficial as in polishing. The work of friction is used to mix and join materials {{such as in the}} process of friction welding. Excessive erosion or wear of mating sliding surfaces occurs when work due to frictional forces rise to unacceptable levels. Harder corrosion particles caught between mating surfaces in relative motion (<b>fretting)</b> exacerbates wear of frictional forces. Bearing seizure or failure may result from excessive wear due to work of friction. As surfaces are worn by work due to friction, fit and surface finish of an object may degrade until it no longer functions properly.|$|E
25|$|The overjoyed {{girls of}} UCLA's {{sorority}} Delta Nu, led by Margot, Serena, and Pilar, celebrate the engagement {{that is expected}} to happen that night of Warner Huntington III to their perky, sweet, and strikingly blonde sorority president, Elle Woods, who is <b>fretting</b> over finding the perfect dress for the occasion ("Omigod You Guys"). Once she acquires her dream dress, Elle goes to dinner with Warner, where he tells her that he needs someone more serious and breaks up with her ("Serious"). Elle is devastated and sulks for twelve days ("Daughter Of Delta Nu") but decides to chase Warner to Harvard Law School to show him that she can be serious. With help from Delta Nu sister Kate, Elle studies for the LSAT. Instead of writing a personal essay, Elle bursts into the Harvard admission offices backed by a squad of cheerleaders. She is accepted after revealing she is motivated by love ("What You Want").|$|E
50|$|Almost all guitars have <b>frets,</b> {{which are}} metal strips (usually nickel alloy or {{stainless}} steel) embedded along the fretboard and located at exact points that divide the scale length {{in accordance with}} a specific mathematical formula. The exceptions include fretless bass guitars and very rare fretless guitars. Pressing a string against a <b>fret</b> determines the strings' vibrating length and therefore its resultant pitch. The pitch of each consecutive <b>fret</b> is defined at a half-step interval on the chromatic scale. Standard classical guitars have 19 <b>frets</b> and electric guitars between 21 and 24 <b>frets,</b> although guitars have been made {{with as many as}} 27 <b>frets.</b> <b>Frets</b> are laid out to accomplish an equal tempered division of the octave. Each set of twelve <b>frets</b> represents an octave. The twelfth <b>fret</b> divides the scale length exactly into two halves, and the 24th <b>fret</b> position divides one of those halves in half again.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Frets</b> are {{the metal}} strips (usually nickel alloy or {{stainless}} steel) embedded along the fingerboard and placed at points that divide {{the length of}} string mathematically. The strings' vibrating length is determined when the strings are pressed down behind the <b>frets.</b> Each <b>fret</b> produces a different pitch and each pitch spaced a half-step apart on the 12 tone scale. The ratio of the widths of two consecutive <b>frets</b> is the twelfth root of two (...) , whose numeric value is about 1.059463. The twelfth <b>fret</b> divides the string in two exact halves and the 24th <b>fret</b> (if present) divides the string in half yet again. Every twelve <b>frets</b> represents one octave. This arrangement of <b>frets</b> results in equal tempered tuning.|$|R
40|$|Time-gated Förster {{resonance}} energy transfer (<b>FRET)</b> using the unique material combination of long-lifetime terbium complexes (Tb) and semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) provides many advantages for highly sensitive and multiplexed biosensing. Although time-gated detection can efficiently suppress sample autofluorescence and background fluorescence from directly excited <b>FRET</b> acceptors, Tb-to-QD <b>FRET</b> {{has rarely been}} exploited for biomolecular imaging. We demonstrate Tb-to-QD time-gated <b>FRET</b> nanoassemblies {{that can be applied}} for intra- and extracellular imaging. Immunostaining of different epitopes of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with Tb- and QD-conjugated antibodies and nanobodies allowed for efficient Tb-to-QD <b>FRET</b> on A 431 cell membranes. The broad usability of Tb-to-QD <b>FRET</b> was further demonstrated by intracellular Tb-to-QD <b>FRET</b> and Tb-to-QD-to-dye <b>FRET</b> using microinjection as well as cell-penetrating peptide-mediated endocytosis with HeLa cells. Effective brightness enhancement by <b>FRET</b> from several Tb to the same QD, the use of low nanomolar concentrations, and the quick and sensitive detection void of <b>FRET</b> acceptor background fluorescence are important advantages for advanced intra- and extracellular imaging of biomolecular interactions...|$|R

500|$|A {{reference}} work by Hal Leonard compares it to a pianist's approach, with Hendrix's [...] "thumb fret the bass notes, functioning in {{almost the same}} manner as a keyboardist's left hand, and the fingers of his <b>fretting</b> hand can be likened to a pianist's right hand". [...] Leonard also adds that guitarist Adrian Belew describes the technique as a [...] "lost art".|$|E
500|$|The 1960s {{standard}} of a [...] sealed width with [...] gravel shoulders was {{proving to be}} inadequate by the 1980s. Increasing numbers of truck and tourist coaches caused <b>fretting,</b> and reduced the actual sealed width to [...] along much of Eyre Highway. Main Roads in Western Australia spent around {{a million dollars a}} year on rehabilitating [...] sections. A major project to improve Eyre Highway, rather than just repair the damage, began in 1984 with federal government funding to reconstruct [...] in Western Australia.|$|E
5000|$|Fan <b>frets</b> (also fanned <b>frets,</b> slanted <b>frets),</b> or multi-scale: while <b>frets</b> are {{generally}} {{perpendicular to the}} instrument's neck centerline and parallel to each other, on a [...] "fanned" [...] fretboard, the <b>frets</b> are angled (spread like a fan) with only one center <b>fret</b> perpendicular to the neck’s centerline. This gives the lower-pitched strings more length and the higher strings shorter length (comparable to a piano or a harp where heaver strings have different lengths).The idea is to give more accurate tuning and deeper bass. Some think that fanned <b>frets</b> might be more ergonomic. Fanned <b>frets</b> first appeared on the 16th century Orpharion, {{a variant of the}} cittern, tuned like a lute. John Starrett revived the idea in the late seventies on his innovative instrument, the Starrboard. Rickenbacker employed a slanted <b>fret,</b> but it was not multi scale, or fanned. Novax Guitars among others offers such guitars today. The appearance of angled <b>frets</b> on these modern instruments belies the antiquity of this technique.|$|R
40|$|The {{influences}} of {{donor and acceptor}} concentrations on Forster resonant energy transfer (<b>FRET)</b> in a separated donor-acceptor quantum dot bilayer structure have been investigated. Donor intra-ensemble energy transfer is shown {{to have an impact}} on the donor-acceptor <b>FRET</b> efficiency in the bilayer structure. At high donor concentrations the <b>FRET</b> distance dependence and the acceptor concentration dependence in the separated donor-acceptor layer structure agree well with theories developed for <b>FRET</b> between randomly distributed, homogeneous donor and acceptor ensembles. However, discrepancies between measurement and theory are found at low donor concentrations. A donor concentration study shows that the <b>FRET</b> efficiency decreases with increasing donor concentration even though a donor concentration-independent <b>FRET</b> efficiency is predicted by standard theory. The observed dependence of the <b>FRET</b> efficiency on the donor concentration can be explained within the <b>FRET</b> rate model, for a constant, donor concentration independent <b>FRET</b> rate, by taking into account the concentration dependent donor reference lifetime arising from intra-donor ensemble <b>FRET.</b> This shows that the decrease in the <b>FRET</b> efficiency with increasing donor concentration is not a signature of a change in the donor-acceptor <b>FRET</b> rate, but due to the competition of the donor-acceptor and donor-donor energy transfer for the higher energy donors. As the intra-donor ensemble <b>FRET</b> represents another decay mechanism, the donor quantum yield for the higher energy donors decreases with increasing donor quantum dot (QD) concentration, as can also be seen from the redshift of the donor emission spectrum. Using this concentration dependent donor quantum yield in the calculation of the Forster radius, the <b>FRET</b> theory for homogeneous donor and acceptor ensembles can be modified to include the effect of the donor intra-ensemble transfer and to correctly describe the trends and absolute values of the measured <b>FRET</b> efficiencies as a function of the donor and the acceptor concentrations. These results show that in QD systems where intra-donor ensemble <b>FRET</b> is as important as the radiative and nonradiative donor decay mechanisms, the <b>FRET</b> rate rather than the <b>FRET</b> efficiency more appropriately characterizes the donor-acceptor <b>FRET.</b> By fitting with the rate model, <b>FRET</b> rates as high as (1. 2 ns) (- 1) have been determined for the structures presented here...|$|R
