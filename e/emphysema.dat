5|$|Air can {{be trapped}} {{under the skin}} in necrotizing infections such as gangrene, {{occurring}} as a late sign in gas gangrene, {{of which it is}} the hallmark sign. Subcutaneous <b>emphysema</b> is also considered a hallmark of fournier gangrene. Symptoms of subcutaneous <b>emphysema</b> can result when infectious organisms produce gas by fermentation. When <b>emphysema</b> occurs due to infection, signs that the infection is systemic, i.e. that it has spread beyond the initial location, are also present.|$|E
5|$|Subcutaneous <b>emphysema</b> is when gas or air is in {{the layer}} under the skin. Subcutaneous refers to the tissue beneath the skin, and <b>emphysema</b> refers to trapped air. It is {{sometimes}} abbreviated SCE or SE and also called tissue <b>emphysema,</b> or Sub Q air. Since the air generally comes from the chest cavity, subcutaneous <b>emphysema</b> usually occurs on the chest, neck and face, where {{it is able to}} travel from the chest cavity along the fascia. Subcutaneous <b>emphysema</b> has a characteristic crackling feel to the touch, a sensation that has been described as similar to touching Rice Krispies; this sensation of air under the skin is known as subcutaneous crepitation.|$|E

5|$|Spontaneous {{subcutaneous}} <b>emphysema</b> {{is thought}} to result from increased pressures in the lung that cause alveoli to rupture. In spontaneous subcutaneous <b>emphysema,</b> air travels from the ruptured alveoli into the interstitium and along the blood vessels of the lung, into the mediastinum and from there into the tissues of the neck or head.|$|E
5|$|Subcutaneous <b>emphysema</b> {{is often}} found in car {{accident}} victims because of {{the force of the}} crash.|$|E
5|$|COPD {{is a type}} of obstructive {{lung disease}} in which chronic incompletely {{reversible}} poor airflow (airflow limitation) and inability to breathe out fully (air trapping) exist. The poor airflow is the result of breakdown of lung tissue (known as <b>emphysema)</b> and small airways disease (known as obstructive bronchiolitis). The relative contributions of these two factors vary between people. Severe destruction of small airways can lead to the formation of large air pockets—known as bullae—that replace lung tissue. This form of disease is called bullous <b>emphysema.</b>|$|E
5|$|In children, {{additional}} causes include measles, echinococcosis, inhalation of {{a foreign}} body, and certain congenital malformations (congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation and congenital lobar <b>emphysema).</b>|$|E
5|$|Numerous etiologies of {{subcutaneous}} <b>emphysema</b> {{have been}} described. Pneumomediastinum was first {{recognized as a}} medical entity by Laennec, who reported it {{as a consequence of}} trauma in 1819. Later, in 1939, at The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Dr. Louis Hamman described it in postpartum woman; indeed, subcutaneous <b>emphysema</b> is sometimes known as Hamman's syndrome. However, in some medical circles, it can instead be more commonly known as Macklin's Syndrome after L. Macklin, in 1939, and M.T. and C.C. Macklin, in 1944, who cumulatively went on to describe the pathophysiology in more detail.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{symptoms}} of COPD are sputum production, shortness of breath, and a productive cough. These symptoms are present for {{a prolonged period}} of time and typically worsen over time. It is unclear if different types of COPD exist. While previously divided into <b>emphysema</b> and chronic bronchitis, <b>emphysema</b> is only a description of lung changes rather than a disease itself, and chronic bronchitis is simply a descriptor of symptoms {{that may or may not}} occur with COPD.|$|E
5|$|Tristano had {{a series}} of {{illnesses}} in the 1970s, including eye pain and <b>emphysema</b> (he smoked for most of his life). On November 18, 1978 he {{died of a heart attack}} at home in Jamaica, New York.|$|E
5|$|Baker {{married her}} third husband, British theater actor Donald Burton, on March 10, 1978, and resided in Hampstead, London, in the 1980s. The couple {{remained}} together until Burton's death from <b>emphysema</b> {{at their home}} in Cathedral City, California, on December 8, 2007.|$|E
5|$|Damage to the airways {{can cause}} {{subcutaneous}} <b>emphysema</b> (air {{trapped in the}} subcutaneous tissue of the skin) in the abdomen, chest, neck, and head. Subcutaneous <b>emphysema,</b> present in up to 85% of people with TBI, is particularly indicative of the injury when {{it is only in}} the neck. Air is trapped in the chest cavity outside the lungs (pneumothorax) in about 70% of TBI. Especially strong evidence that TBI has occurred is failure of a pneumothorax to resolve even when a chest tube is placed to rid the chest cavity of the air; it shows that air is continually leaking into the chest cavity from the site of the tear. Air can also be trapped in the mediastinum, the center of the chest cavity (pneumomediastinum). If air escapes from a penetrating injury to the neck, a definite diagnosis of TBI can be made. Hamman's sign, a sound of crackling that occurs in time with the heartbeat, may also accompany TBI.|$|E
5|$|He died of <b>emphysema</b> in Newton, Kansas, on 12 October 1964, and {{was buried}} in Arlington Cemetery. His son, Ennis Whitehead, Jr., later became a major general in the U.S. Army in the late 1970s, and in March 2003, his {{grandson}} Ennis Whitehead III was promoted to brigadier general in the Army Reserve, making three generations of general officers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{preceding}} and following his military service, Bleak worked numerous jobs around Idaho and Wyoming, {{working as a}} rancher, dairy farmer, truck driver, and meat cutter before retiring as a radioactive waste technician at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory.

5|$|Moore died of <b>emphysema</b> at Hilton Head on November 28, 1993, {{at the age}} of 78. He {{was buried}} at Forest Hill Cemetery in Northeast Harbor, Maine. He was named one of the 15 {{greatest}} game-show hosts of all time by Time.|$|E
5|$|Pat Nixon died on June 22, 1993, of <b>emphysema</b> {{and lung}} cancer. Her funeral {{services}} were {{held on the}} grounds of the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace. Former President Nixon was distraught throughout the interment and delivered a tribute to her inside the library building.|$|E
5|$|Protease {{inhibitory}} {{activity in}} blood plasma was first {{reported in the}} late 1800s, {{but it was not}} until the 1950s that the serpins antithrombin and alpha 1-antitrypsin were isolated. Initial research focused on their role in human disease: alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency is one of the most common genetic disorders, causing <b>emphysema,</b> and antithrombin deficiency results in thrombosis.|$|E
5|$|Subcutaneous <b>emphysema</b> of {{the chest}} wall is {{commonly}} among the first signs to appear that barotrauma, damage caused by excessive pressure, has occurred, {{and it is an}} indication that the lung was subjected to significant barotrauma. Thus the phenomenon may occur in diving injuries.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of subcutaneous <b>emphysema</b> {{in a person}} who appears quite ill and febrile after bout of vomiting followed by left chest pain is very suggestive of the diagnosis of Boerhaave's syndrome, which is a life-threatening emergency caused by rupture of the distal esophagus.|$|E
5|$|Chest x-ray is {{the initial}} imaging {{technique}} used to diagnose TBI. The film {{may not have}} any signs in an otherwise asymptomatic patient. Indications of TBI seen on radiographs include deformity in the trachea or a defect in the tracheal wall. Radiography may also show cervical <b>emphysema,</b> air in the tissues of the neck. X-rays may also show accompanying injuries and signs such as fractures and subcutaneous <b>emphysema.</b> If subcutaneous <b>emphysema</b> occurs and the hyoid bone appears in an X-ray to be sitting unusually high in the throat, {{it may be an}} indication that the trachea has been severed. TBI is also suspected if an endotracheal tube appears in an X-ray to be out of place, or if its cuff appears to be more full than normal or to protrude through a tear in the airway. If a bronchus is torn all the way around, the lung may collapse outward toward the chest wall (rather than inward, as it usually does in pneumothorax) because it loses the attachment to the bronchus which normally holds it toward the center. In a person lying face-up, the lung collapses toward the diaphragm and the back. This sign, described in 1969, is called fallen lung sign and is pathognomonic of TBI (that is, it is diagnostic for TBI because it does not occur in other conditions); however it occurs only rarely. In as many as one in five cases, people with blunt trauma and TBI have no signs of the injury on chest X-ray. CT scanning detects over 90% of TBI resulting from blunt trauma, but neither X-ray nor CT are a replacement for bronchoscopy.|$|E
5|$|He died on 23 March 2006, at the Lost Rivers District Hospital in Arco, Idaho, from <b>emphysema,</b> Parkinson's Disease, and {{complications}} from a hip fracture. He died {{the same day}} as another Medal of Honor recipient, Desmond Doss. At the time of his death, he had nine grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. Following his death, Bleak was cremated and his remains were scattered in Idaho, at a site which was supposedly his favorite fishing location. His family later placed a cenotaph in his honor at the Lost River Cemetery in Butte County, Idaho.|$|E
5|$|Icos {{developed}} several drugs {{whose purpose}} was to disrupt the process of inflammation in the body. The research program focused on {{the underlying causes of}} inflammation rather than specific disorders. The compounds developed by Icos were tested in clinical trials in the areas of sepsis, multiple sclerosis, ischemic stroke, heart attack, pancreatitis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial cystitis, psoriasis, hemorrhagic shock, sexual dysfunction, benign prostatic hyperplasia, rheumatoid arthritis, <b>emphysema,</b> chronic bronchitis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Nash's father Bob Senior {{collapsed}} {{and died in}} 1958 while at the MCG watching Collingwood win the 1958 VFL Grand Final. Laurie Nash later {{said that it would}} have been the perfect way for his father to die. Nash's brother Bob Junior died of <b>emphysema</b> in the early 1970s, while in 1975 Irene Nash, who had been in poor health for some time, died, leaving Nash heartbroken. Every day for five years he visited the cemetery where her remains were scattered.|$|E
5|$|On June 5, 1986, {{the couple}} was living in Auburn, Washington when Bruce Nickell, 52, {{came home from work}} with a headache. According to Stella, Nickell took four Extra-Strength Excedrin {{capsules}} from a bottle in their home for his headache and collapsed minutes later. Nickell died shortly thereafter at Harborview Medical Center, where treatment had failed to revive him. His death was initially ruled to be by natural causes, with attending physicians citing <b>emphysema.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Nixons {{moved to}} a gated complex in Park Ridge, New Jersey, in 1991. Pat's health was failing, {{and the house was}} smaller and {{contained}} an elevator. A heavy smoker most of her adult life who nevertheless never allowed herself to be seen with a cigarette in public, she eventually endured bouts of oral cancer, <b>emphysema,</b> and ultimately lung cancer, with which she was diagnosed in December 1992 while hospitalized with respiratory problems.|$|E
5|$|Asthma, chronic bronchitis, {{bronchiectasis}} {{and chronic}} obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are all obstructive lung diseases characterised by airway obstruction. This limits {{the amount of}} air that is able to enter alveoli because of constriction of the bronchial tree, due to inflammation. Obstructive lung diseases are often identified because of symptoms and diagnosed with pulmonary function tests such as spirometry. Many obstructive lung diseases are managed by avoiding triggers (such as dust mites or smoking), with symptom control such as bronchodilators, and with suppression of inflammation (such as through corticosteroids) in severe cases. One common cause of COPD and <b>emphysema</b> is smoking, and common causes of bronchiectasis include severe infections and cystic fibrosis. The definitive cause of asthma is not yet known.|$|E
5|$|Low oxygen levels and, eventually, {{high carbon}} dioxide {{levels in the}} blood can occur from poor gas {{exchange}} due to decreased ventilation from airway obstruction, hyperinflation and a reduced desire to breathe. During exacerbations, airway inflammation is also increased, resulting in increased hyperinflation, reduced expiratory airflow and worsening of gas transfer. This {{can also lead to}} insufficient ventilation and, eventually, low blood oxygen levels. Low oxygen levels, if present for a prolonged period, can result in narrowing of the arteries in the lungs, while <b>emphysema</b> leads to breakdown of capillaries in the lungs. Both these changes result in increased blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries, which may cause cor pulmonale.|$|E
5|$|Nelson owns Luck, Texas, a {{ranch in}} Spicewood, Texas, and also lives in Maui, Hawaii with several celebrity neighbors.While {{swimming}} in Hawaii in 1981, Nelson's lung collapsed. He {{was taken to}} the Maui Memorial Hospital and his scheduled concerts were canceled. Nelson temporarily stopped smoking cigarettes each time his lungs became congested, and resumed when the congestion ended. He was then smoking between two and three packs per day. After suffering from pneumonia several times, he decided to quit either marijuana or tobacco. He chose to quit tobacco. In 2008 he started to smoke marijuana with a carbon-free system to avoid the effects of smoke. In 2004 Nelson underwent surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome, as he had damaged his wrists by continuously playing the guitar. On the recommendation of his doctor, he canceled his scheduled concerts and only wrote songs during his recovery. In 2012 he canceled a fund-raising appearance in the Denver area. He suffered from breathing problems due to high altitude and <b>emphysema</b> and was taken to a local hospital. His publicist Elaine Schock confirmed soon after that Nelson's health was good and that he was heading to his next scheduled concert in Dallas, Texas. After repeated instances of pneumonia and <b>emphysema</b> through the years, Nelson underwent stem-cell therapy in 2015 to improve the state of his lungs.|$|E
5|$|Several {{therapeutic}} {{approaches are}} in use or under investigation {{to treat the}} most common serpinopathy: antitrypsin deficiency. Antitrypsin augmentation therapy is approved for severe antitrypsin deficiency-related pulmonary <b>emphysema.</b> In this therapy, antitrypsin is purified from the plasma of blood donors and administered intravenously (first marketed as Prolastin). To treat severe antitrypsin deficiency-related disease, lung and liver transplantation has proven effective. In animal models, gene targeting in {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} has been successfully used to correct an antitrypsin polymerisation defect and to restore the ability of the mammalian liver to secrete active antitrypsin. Small molecules have also been developed that block antitrypsin polymerisation in vitro.|$|E
5|$|When airways are damaged, air {{can escape}} {{from them and}} be trapped in the {{surrounding}} tissues in the neck (subcutaneous <b>emphysema)</b> and mediastinum (pneumomediastinum); if it builds up to high enough pressures there, it can compress the airways. Massive air leaks from a ruptured airway can also compromise the circulation by preventing blood from returning to the heart from the head and lower body; this causes a potentially deadly reduction {{in the amount of}} blood the heart is able to pump out. Blood and other fluids can build up in the airways, and the injury can interfere with the patency of the airway and interfere with its continuity. However, even if the trachea is completely transected, the tissues surrounding it may hold it together enough for adequate air exchange to occur, at least at first.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from the war, Davey worked for the South Australian Railways as a labourer and linesman over three periods between 1926 and 1946. He married Eugene Agnes Tomlinson on 25 August 1928, there being no children of the union. After suffering for many years with bronchitis and <b>emphysema,</b> he died on 21 December 1953 of a coronary occlusion. He was buried at the West Terrace AIF Cemetery, Adelaide, with full military honours. In addition to the Victoria Cross, Military Medal, 1914–15 Star, British War Medal and Victory Medal for his service in World War I, Davey was also later awarded the King George VI Coronation Medal and Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal. His medal set, including his Victoria Cross, {{was presented to the}} Australian War Memorial in Canberra in 1967, and is displayed in the Hall of Valour.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev had {{struggled}} with several ailments since 1974, most notably heart disease, leukemia, jaw cancer, <b>emphysema</b> and circulatory disease, {{all of which}} had been exacerbated by his heavy smoking and obesity. There had been rumours of Brezhnev's death ever since the mid-1970s; he had been absent from important meetings demanded by protocol and it was rumoured that his health was in decline. Brezhnev had rarely appeared in public for most of 1982 and was usually surrounded by doctors, although the Soviet Government insisted that he was not ill. He suffered a severe stroke in May 1982, but refused to relinquish office until he died on 10 November 1982 after suffering a heart attack. He was honoured with a state funeral in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis on the Red Square after a five-day period of nationwide mourning.|$|E
5|$|COPD {{develops}} as {{a significant}} and chronic inflammatory response to inhaled irritants. Chronic bacterial infections may also add to this inflammatory state. The inflammatory cells involved include neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages, two types of white blood cell. Those who smoke additionally have Tc1 lymphocyte involvement and some people with COPD have eosinophil involvement {{similar to that in}} asthma. Part of this cell response is brought on by inflammatory mediators such as chemotactic factors. Other processes involved with lung damage include oxidative stress produced by high concentrations of free radicals in tobacco smoke and released by inflammatory cells, and breakdown of the connective tissue of the lungs by proteases that are insufficiently inhibited by protease inhibitors. The destruction of the connective tissue of the lungs is what leads to <b>emphysema,</b> which then contributes to the poor airflow and, finally, poor absorption and release of respiratory gases. General muscle wasting that often occurs in COPD may be partly due to inflammatory mediators released by the lungs into the blood.|$|E
