This {{made him the}} favorite son of his father, Prince Gang, who himself attempted to escape from Korea to join the exiled Korean government. He overcame all attempts by the Japanese to marry him off to a minor Japanese noble, and married Lady Park Chan-ju, a granddaughter of Marquis Park Yŏng-hyo who was a husband of Princess Yŏnghye of Korea. They had two children, Yi Chung (李淸 이청 i chŏng) (born 23 April 1936) and Yi Jong (李淙 이종 i jong) (born 9 November 1940 - died 1966).|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{aimed to}} assess the {{presence}} of estrogenic endocrine disrupting compounds (e-EDCs) including estriol, bisphenol A (BPA), atrazine (ATZ), octylphenol, octylphenol diethoxylate, octylphenol triethoxylate, nonylphenol, Nonylphenol triethoxylate (NPE 3), nonylphenol diethoxylate (NPE 2) and 17 β-estradiol in: (<b>i)</b> Sai <b>Gon</b> and Dong Nai river waters which have been major raw water sources for drinking water supply for Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) and neighbouring provinces, and (ii) water pollution sources located in their catchment basin. NPE 3 and NPE 2 were detected {{in most of the}} surface water samples. Concentrations of NPE 3 were in a range of less than 5. 9 – 235  ng L− 1, whereas BPA was detected at significantly high concentrations in the dry season in canals in HCMC. In the upstream of Sai Gon and Dong Nai Rivers, ATZ concentrations were observed at water intake of water treatment plants served for HCMC water supply system. Similarly, high potential risk of NPE 2 and NPE 3 contamination at Phu Cuong Bridge near Hoa Phu water intake was identified. The significant correlation between NPE 2, dissolved organic carbon and total nitrogen was found. Estrogenic equivalent or estrogenic activity of Sai Gon and Dong Nai Rivers was lower than those of the previous studies. Compared with other studies, e-EDCs of pollution in Sai Gon river basin were relatively low...|$|R
40|$|African-American Vernacular English (AAVE), Black English Vernacular (BEV), or Ebonics, is {{a social}} dialect or a {{non-standard}} linguistic variety of American English which carries distinctive grammatical and phonological features. Because of these features, AAVE is considered a unique communication system that has been recognized among linguists as an alternate, regular, and systematic form of vernacular language. Common phonological characteristics of AAVE include reductions or deletions of particular sounds (e. g., [sstə] for Standard American English "sister" [sstər]) and different realizations and vocalizations. In this article, we examine the abbreviations of future going to (<b>i.</b> e., onna, <b>gon,</b> I’ma) which have been typically associated with AAVE. The variants of future going to have been studied in the interviews with six African-American public figures: rap artists Redman, Prodigy, MC Lyte, and Queen Latifah, a talkshow host, Oprah Winfrey, and a blues musician, B. B. King. We analyze the completely abbreviated form I’ma in correlation to gon, gonna, and going to {{in the first person}} singular and explore the use of gon in relation to gonna and going to in the remaining grammatical environments. The main objective {{of this study is to}} calculate the frequencies of future going to variants in the speech data of each interviewee and test the sociolinguistic variability of the feature by considering the influence of two external identity characteristics, gender and affiliation with Hip Hop culture...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} tiling {p,q} of the Euclidean space {{and of the}} hyperbolic space, and its dual graph Γq,p from a combinatorial point of view. A substitution σq,p on an appropriate finite alphabet is constructed. The homogeneity of graph Γq,p and its generation function are the basic tools for the construction. The tree associated with substitution σq,p is a spanning tree of graph Γq,p. Let un be the number of tiles of tiling {p,q} of generation n. The characteristic polynomial of the transition matrix of substitution σq,p is a characteristic polynomial of a linear recurrence. The sequence (un) n≥ 0 is a solution of this recurrence. The growth of sequence (un) n≥ 0 is given by the dominant root of the characteristic polynomial. The result {{of this paper is}} related to [6, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 2]. 1 Combinatorial structure of tiling {p, q} induced by the generation function Here we shall develop [2] using different combinatorial method.
