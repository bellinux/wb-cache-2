40|$|The {{developmental}} disorders of enamel are {{abnormalities of}} structure which can affect both dentitions. These abnormalities include amelogenesis imperfecta, <b>enamel</b> <b>hypoplasia</b> and dental fluorosis. The amelogenesis imperfecta is a <b>hereditary</b> change and <b>enamel</b> <b>hypoplasia</b> is a quantitative defect of enamel that occurs {{as a result}} of systemic problems, local and also inherited factors, or even the combination of them. Dental fluorosis is a hypoplasia caused by the chronic ingestion of fluoride during odontogenesis. All these anomalies have similar clinical characteristics, and it is necessary to be careful in their assessment. It is extremely important to know these abnormalities to establish a differential diagnosis and, consequently, a treatment plan, which can be set for each situation. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to review the literature regarding these three anomalies: amelogenesis imperfecta, <b>enamel</b> <b>hypoplasia</b> and dental fluorosis. It was concluded that to establish the differential diagnosis of these abnormalities as well as a proper treatment plan, it is indispensable the professional knowledge associated with the clinical examination.

The environmental factors can {{show up in}} the womb, during delivery, and a few months after birth. Lack of nutrition, especially vitamin A, C, and D, can cause <b>enamel</b> <b>hypoplasia.</b> Moreover, bacteria and viral infections such as syphilis, measles, chickenpox, and other illnesses which cause a high fever leads to <b>enamel</b> <b>hypoplasia.</b> Also, a prolonged delivery, prematurity, birth injury, or low birth weight can cause <b>enamel</b> <b>hypoplasia.</b> Infections happen because of diarrhea and vomiting can also cause <b>enamel</b> <b>hypoplasia.</b> Because <b>enamel</b> <b>hypoplasia</b> can happen in the womb, it provides significant archaeological information. If the mother experiences malnutrition and illness, the infant has a high risk of getting <b>enamel</b> <b>hypoplasia</b> when they are born. However, infants who are perfectly healthy can suffer from <b>enamel</b> <b>hypoplasia</b> as a result of trauma to the newly developed teeth or mouth.

40|$|Archaeological {{research}} into domestic animals {{has demonstrated that}} <b>enamel</b> <b>hypoplasia</b> is a potentially valuable tool for investigating a range of archaeological topics including domestication and animal management strategies. However, {{research into}} archaeological domestic populations has been hindered by the difficulty of recording and interpreting <b>enamel</b> <b>hypoplasia</b> in high-crowned species such as caprines and cattle. This research develops a methodological approach for recording <b>enamel</b> <b>hypoplasia</b> in high-crowned species which is applied to modern and archaeological caprine populations from three geographically distinct regions (Orkney, Kenya and Iceland). Modern caprines with known life histories are used to investigate baseline {{factors such as the}} impact of the environment and nutrition on the frequency and severity of <b>enamel</b> <b>hypoplasia</b> in caprines. These baselines are then used to interpret <b>enamel</b> <b>hypoplasia</b> in archaeological populations. Results indicate that <b>enamel</b> <b>hypoplasia</b> frequency and severity can be linked to variation in the climate /environment as well as nutrition levels in caprine populations. By comparing <b>enamel</b> <b>hypoplasia</b> frequency and severity between populations with similar baseline factors, variation in animal management strategies can be identified. Physiological and seasonal stress events including birth, weaning, and seasonal periods of malnutrition are also identified using <b>enamel</b> <b>hypoplasia</b> in both modern and archaeological populations. ...|$|R

Methods: Information was collected on the sex and socioeconomic status of the 1, 169 study participants' resident in Ile-Ife, Nigeria, recruited through a household survey. The children were clinically examined to assess for the presence of <b>enamel</b> <b>hypoplasia,</b> MIH and DMH. Associations between sex, socioeconomic status and the prevalence of <b>enamel</b> <b>hypoplasia,</b> MIH and DMH were determined. The proportion of children with <b>enamel</b> <b>hypoplasia</b> and MIH/DMH co-morbidity was also determined. Results: Among the 1, 169 study participants, 47 (4. 0 %) had MIH, 15 (1. 3 %) had DMH and 161 (13. 8 %) had <b>enamel</b> <b>hypoplasia.</b> One (0. 09 %) study participant had MIH/DMH co-morbidity, 12 (1. 0 %) had DMH/enamel hypoplasia co-morbidity, and 9 (0. 8 %) had MIH/hypoplasia co-morbidity. There was no significant association between the socioeconomic status and presence of <b>enamel</b> <b>hypoplasia</b> (p= 0. 22), MIH (p= 0. 78) or DMH (p= 1. 00). Conclusions: The socioeconomic status cannot be used as a distinguishing factor for <b>enamel</b> <b>hypoplasia,</b> MIH and DMH.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Enamel</b> <b>hypoplasia</b> is a {{developmental}} disturbance during enamel formation, {{defined as a}} macroscopic defect in the enamel, with a reduction of the enamel thickness with rounded, smooth borders. Information on the microstructural level is still limited, therefore further studies are of importance {{to better understand the}} mechanisms behind <b>enamel</b> <b>hypoplasia.</b> AIM: To study <b>enamel</b> <b>hypoplasia</b> in primary teeth by means of polarized light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. METHODS: Nineteen primary teeth with <b>enamel</b> <b>hypoplasia</b> were examined in a polarized light microscope and in a scanning electron microscope. RESULTS: The cervical and incisal borders of the <b>enamel</b> <b>hypoplasia</b> had a rounded appearance, as the prisms in the rounded cervical area of the hypoplasia were bent. The rounded borders had a normal surface structure whereas the base of the defects appeared rough and porous.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{longitudinal}} relationships between <b>enamel</b> <b>hypoplasia</b> and caries experience of primary second molars. The study sample was 491 subjects who received dental examinations at both age 5 and 9 by the calibrated examiners. Four primary second molars (n = 1, 892) were scored for the presence of <b>enamel</b> <b>hypoplasia</b> for each participant. Caries presence and number of decayed and filled surfaces (dfs) were determined at age 5 and 9. The relationships between <b>enamel</b> <b>hypoplasia</b> and caries experience were assessed. Among primary second molars, 3. 9 % of children and 1. 7 % of primary second molars had <b>enamel</b> <b>hypoplasia.</b> At age 5, 36. 8 % of children with hypoplasia had caries, while 16. 9 % of children without <b>enamel</b> <b>hypoplasia</b> had caries. At age 9, the corresponding numbers were 52. 6 % for children with hypoplasia and 34. 5 % for children without hypoplasia, respectively. At the tooth level, for age 5, 28. 1 % of teeth with hypoplasia had caries (mean dfs = 0. 40), and 7. 6 % of teeth without hypoplasia had caries (mean dfs = 0. 11).

To elucidate the pathological mechanisms of the <b>enamel</b> <b>hypoplasia</b> that arise from the deficiency of epithelial-mesenchymal junction molecules, such as COL 17, we investigated tooth formation in our recently established Col 17 −/− and Col 17 rescued mice. Compared with wild-type mice, the incisors of the Col 17 −/− mice exhibited reduced yellow pigmentation, diminished iron deposition, delayed calcification, and markedly irregular enamel prisms, indicating the presence of <b>enamel</b> <b>hypoplasia.</b> The molars of the Col 17 −/− mice demonstrated advanced occlusal wear. These abnormalities were corrected in the Col 17 rescued humanized mice. Thus, the Col 17 −/− mice clearly reproduced the <b>enamel</b> <b>hypoplasia</b> in human patients with junctional epidermolysis bullosa. We were able to investigate tooth formation in the Col 17 −/− mice because the Col 17 −/− genotype is not lethal. Col 17 −/− mouse incisors had poorly differentiated ameloblasts that lacked enamel protein-secreting Tomes’ processes and reduced mRNA expression of amelogenin, ameloblastin, and of other enamel genes. These findings indicated that COL 17 regulates ameloblast differentiation and is essential for normal formation of Tomes’ processes.
