5|$|Bani Na'im was annexed by Jordan {{after the}} 1948 Arab–Israeli War. In June 1967, after the Six-Day War, the town came under Israeli rule. In 1982, an 18-year-old {{resident}} of the town {{was shot and killed}} by Jewish settlers from nearby Kiryat Arba. In 1987, during the First Intifada, a committee against the Israeli occupation was set up in Bani Na'im. In May 1988, two residents were killed by the <b>Israeli</b> <b>Army</b> (IDF) {{in the center of the}} town.|$|E
5|$|At 2 a.m. on {{the night}} of 18 October 2015, a group of 30 Jews, on {{instruction}} from Rabbi Eliezer Berland, went to the tomb without permits, in contravention of a standing IDF order, to clean and paint the compound that was burned three days before. As they were attacked by local Palestinians, six of them were bruised by beatings, and one of their vehicles was burnt. They claimed that the Palestinian police, who had detained them, had also beaten them, before they were handed over to the <b>Israeli</b> <b>army,</b> which had been called to extract the others.|$|E
5|$|During the Six-Day War in June 1967, Deir al-Balah's mayor Sulaiman al-Azayiza briefly led local {{resistance}} against the incoming <b>Israeli</b> <b>Army</b> until formally surrendering the city shortly thereafter. The Israeli authorities {{took control of}} the springs, an important irrigation source. This move combined with increasing competition from Israeli citrus farmers, damaged the local citrus industry. In 1982 the mayor was dismissed and the municipal council of Deir al-Balah was disbanded and replaced by an Israeli military-appointed administration. During the course of the Israeli occupation, Deir al-Balah's urban areas extended into lands designated for agriculture, {{largely as a result of}} building restrictions which hindered organized expansion.|$|E

5|$|Countries in boreal climates {{often need}} snow camouflage, either by having {{reversible}} uniforms or simple overgarments. Such simple overgarments {{can be used}} for other terrains too.

5|$|Enderlin {{responded to}} Leconte and Jeambar in January 2005 in Le Figaro. He thanked them for rejecting that the scene had been staged. He had {{reported}} that the shots were fired by the Israelis because, he wrote, he trusted the cameraman, {{who had worked for}} France 2 since 1988. In the days following the shooting, other witnesses, including other journalists, offered some confirmation, he said. He added that the <b>Israeli</b> <b>army</b> had not responded to France 2's offers to cooperate with their investigation.|$|E
5|$|Glubb {{nevertheless}} {{knew that}} the <b>Israeli</b> <b>army</b> would sooner or later be stronger than his {{and that he had}} to prevent the strengthening of the Harel and Etzioni brigades to secure East Jerusalem. He redeployed his strength on 23 May to reinforce the blockade. The Iraqi army, at that time seconded by tanks, relieved the Legion units in northern Samaria and these were redeployed towards the Jerusalem sector. The 2nd Regiment of the Legion moved to Latrun. A full Jordanian brigade was placed in the area.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, al-Tamimi's sister, Bassama Tamimi {{died while}} visiting him in {{custody of the}} Israeli Army; it is alleged that she was struck and pushed {{down a flight of}} stairs by an <b>Israeli</b> <b>army</b> interpreter. Bassem's cousin Rushdi Muhammed Sa'id Tamimi was convicted of the October 1993 murder of Haim Mizrahi, a settler from Beit El, he was {{released}} in 2013. Bassem was arrested and reportedly tortured. In December 2011, al-Tamimi's cousin Mustafa Tamimi was killed by a direct hit from a gas grenade fired at close range.|$|E
50|$|Nevertheless, Meir was {{determined}} to gain the maximum strategic advantage before the final curtain came down on the conflict. Given the entanglement of the Egyptian and <b>Israeli</b> <b>armies,</b> the temptation was too great for the Israelis to resist. After a final push in the Sinai expelled the Egyptians, Meir gave the order to cross the Canal.|$|R

5000|$|The Washington Post {{stated that}} the war had been [...] "widely seen as a {{disaster}} for the Israeli military".

5|$|On 16 October 2015, amid {{a wave of}} {{violence}} between Palestinians and Israelis, dozens of Palestinians overran the tomb {{and a group of}} them set it on fire with petrol bombs. Palestinian security forces dispersed them and extinguished the flames; and although the tomb itself was not apparently damaged, the women's section was reported to be heavily damaged. Israeli security forces later arrived at the scene. According to a Palestinian official, the Palestinians had attempted to set up barricades in the area to prevent home demolitions by the <b>Israeli</b> <b>Army,</b> but a group of them proceeded to attack the tomb.|$|E
5|$|Under Egyptian control Deir al-Balah, whose {{population}} tripled {{through the}} influx of refugees from the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, was a prosperous agricultural town until its capture by Israel in the Six-Day War. After 27 years of Israeli occupation, Deir al-Balah became the first city to come under Palestinian self-rule in 1994. Since {{the outbreak of the}} Second Intifada in 2000, it has witnessed frequent incursions by the <b>Israeli</b> <b>Army</b> with the stated aim of stopping Qassam rocket fire into Israel. Ahmad Kurd, a Hamas member, was elected mayor in late January 2005.|$|E
5|$|Continuous {{building}} and land acquisitions increased {{the size of}} the orphanage grounds to nearly 150 acres (600 dunam) by World War I. At the beginning of World War II, the British mandatory government deported the German teachers and turned the compound into a closed military camp with the largest ammunition stockpile in the Middle East. On March 17, 1948, the British abandoned the camp and the Etzioni Brigade of the Haganah used it as a base of operations during the 1948 Israeli War of Independence. For the next 60 years the site served as an <b>Israeli</b> <b>army</b> base known as Camp Schneller. The army vacated the premises in 2008. As of 2011, the compound is being developed for luxury housing.|$|E
50|$|The April {{bombing was}} one of the first suicide attacks in the region.

5000|$|On {{the ending}} of the first United Nations Truce on July 8, most of the <b>Israeli</b> <b>army's</b> {{attention}} and resources were focused on Operations Danny and Dekel.

But in ten days, the Givati Brigade did succeed in [...] "conquering areas in the northern Negev and in the western Hebron district foothills." ...|$|R
5000|$|When the Jerusalem city {{government}} voted to permit sex-segregated public buses, Feiglin supported the action: [...] "I see {{discrimination against women}} as despicable. But {{it is unreasonable to}} force an ultra-Orthodox bus company to institute mixed seating on its buses against the wishes of its customers." [...] Feiglin also opposes the <b>Israeli</b> <b>army's</b> decision to allow women into combat units.|$|R
5|$|In 1951 the <b>Israeli</b> <b>army</b> summoned {{representatives of}} the World Lutheran Church to remove {{religious}} artifacts from the orphanage church; church representatives removed bells, windows and a pipe organ, but left the heavy marble altar encased in a wooden chest. The church was then converted into a basketball arena for the soldiers. In October 2009, {{on a tour of}} the facility after the army had vacated the grounds, the provost of the Evangelical German Lutheran Church of the Redeemer noticed the chest and asked for it to be opened, exposing the altar. The Lutherans negotiated for it to be moved to the Lutheran church at Augusta Victoria Hospital, where it was inaugurated in November 2010.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, the <b>Israeli</b> <b>Army</b> {{attempted}} to disperse the {{high concentration of}} Palestinian refugees in al-Shati camp and developed new housing schemes {{that resulted in the}} establishment of the northern Sheikh Radwan district. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and the PLO were vociferous in their opposition to the move, claiming it was forced resettlement. In 1972, Gaza's military governor dismissed the city's mayor, Rashad al-Shawa, for refusing to annex al-Shati camp to the municipality of Gaza. Since the 1970s, frequent conflicts erupted between Palestinians and the Israeli authorities in the city, leading to the First Intifada in 1987. Gaza became a center of confrontation during this uprising, and consequently, economic conditions in the city worsened.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptians {{sought to}} exploit this Israeli belief to their advantage. Ever since {{assuming}} office, Sadat had continually threatened Israel with war, engaging in brinkmanship, until his threats became ignored by Israel and the world. In order to position their forces {{for the attack}} against Israel, the Egyptians announced an exercise by the canal. Exercises had been conducted numerous times before, and in May and August 1973 false alarms had caused the <b>Israeli</b> <b>army</b> to mobilise {{in response to these}} exercises, costing Israel some $10 million on each occasion. This time, when the Egyptians began exercises on October 1 to last until October 7, Aman disregarded the heightened military activity as training maneuvers. Troop movements on the Syrian front were detected as well, but Aman concluded that the Syrians would not go to war without the Egyptians.|$|E
50|$|In 2002 the Supreme Court of Israel {{issued a}} {{temporary}} injunction banning {{the practice in}} the wake of the death of a Nidal Abu Mohsen (19) who was shot dead when he was forced by the IDF to knock on the door of his neighbor, Hamas militant Nasser Jarrar, in the West Bank village of Tubas and inform him of the <b>Israeli</b> <b>army's</b> demands that he surrender.|$|R
5000|$|In April 2004, Natan Sharansky who {{was then}} Israel's {{minister}} for diaspora affairs wrote to the BBC accusing its Middle East correspondent, Orla Guerin, as having a [...] "deep-seated bias against Israel" [...] following her description of the <b>Israeli</b> <b>army's</b> handling of the arrest of Hussam Abdo, who was captured with explosives strapped to his chest, as [...] "cynical manipulation of a Palestinian youngster for propaganda purposes." ...|$|R

5|$|From 1983 to 1993, Arafat based {{himself in}} Tunisia, {{and began to}} shift his {{approach}} from open conflict with the Israelis to negotiation. In 1988, he acknowledged Israel's right to exist and sought a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. In 1994 he returned to Palestine, settling in Gaza City and promoting self-governance for the Palestinian territories. He engaged {{in a series of}} negotiations with the Israeli government to end the conflict between it and the PLO. These included the Madrid Conference of 1991, the 1993 Oslo Accords and the 2000 Camp David Summit. In 1994 Arafat received the Nobel Peace Prize, together with Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, for the negotiations at Oslo. At the time, Fatah's support among the Palestinians declined with the growth of Hamas and other militant rivals. In late 2004, after effectively being confined within his Ramallah compound for over two years by the <b>Israeli</b> <b>army,</b> Arafat fell into a coma and died. While the cause of Arafat's death has remained the subject of speculation, investigations by Russian and French teams determined no foul play was involved.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} night hours of 24 October 2001, during the Second Intifada, the <b>Israeli</b> <b>Army</b> (IDF) {{launched}} an incursion into Beit Rima in {{what became the}} first major Israeli military raid into Palestinian-controlled territory, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW). The IDF stated {{the intent of the}} raid was to capture the alleged killers of Israeli Tourism Minister Rehavam Ze'evi, who was shot dead by members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) in retaliation for Israel's assassination of the party's leader Mustafa Zibri (Abu Ali Mustafa) in August. About 50 people from Beit Rima were detained and brought to the Israeli settlement of Halamish for interrogation. Most were released before the day's end, but eleven men remained in Israeli custody, two of whom Israel alleged to be directly involved in Ze'evi's assassination. In the course of the raid, Israeli forces killed six Palestinians, including three members of the Palestinian National Security Forces and two officers from the Civil Police, and wounded seven others. The Palestinian authorities in Beit Rima stated they had not received prior warning from the IDF and their slain men had been resting in an olive grove near the local police station, while Israeli military officials stated all those killed had either fired on Israeli forces or approached them threateningly and all were members of various armed groups. The HRW stated that the Red Crescent was prevented from treating the injured men until 7:00 am, a delay that resulted in the death of two of the police officers. Israeli forces also demolished three homes in the town, alleging that they belonged to family members of Ze'evi's killers.|$|E
5|$|When 27 August, fifteen {{days before}} 7 September, passed without a reply from either Sadat or Assad, {{it was clear}} no {{offensive}} would take place in September. During 28 and 29 August, Sadat met with Assad in Damascus, where they agreed to start the war in October. They specified October 6 as D-Day, and informed Ahmed Ismail and Tlass on 22 September, who in turn relayed the decision to the Chiefs of Staff. At the request of Ahmed Ismail, Sadat produced a presidential directive for war. Therefore, {{it was only in}} September, less than a month before the attack, that the date October 6 was finally selected as D-Day. The coordinated offensive would begin at 14:00 (Cairo Local Time). October 6 was chosen for several reasons. The speed of the water current and the tide were optimal for a crossing operation, and for most of the night there was a full moon, facilitating bridge construction. The date coincided with Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement. This was an important factor in choosing October 6 for an attack; observant Jews fast on that day, abstain from the use of fire or electricity (which meant transportation would be at a standstill), and much of the <b>Israeli</b> <b>army</b> would be demobilised. October also coincided with the month of Ramadan in the Muslim Calendar, which meant that Muslim soldiers would be fasting. It was in Ramadan that the Muslims won their first victory at the Battle of Badr in the year 634. Opting for something more inspirational than the High Minarets as a name, Operation Badr was chosen by Egyptian commanders as the codename for the assault.|$|E
5000|$|Though the Sho't {{tank was}} not {{commonly}} {{perceived as a}} principal battle tank during the Six Day War (1967), nor the Yom Kippur war (1973); {{it was in fact}} considered the <b>Israeli</b> <b>Army's</b> most-effective tank. This Israeli version of the Centurion earned its legendary status during the Battle of [...] "The Valley of Tears" [...] on the Golan Heights in the 1973 Yom Kippur War.|$|R
25|$|She {{had gone}} to Gaza {{as part of her}} senior-year college {{assignment}} to connect her home-town with Rafah in a sister cities project. While there, she had engaged with other International Solidarity Movement (ISM) activists in efforts to prevent the <b>Israeli</b> <b>army's</b> demolition of Palestinian houses. According to the Israeli authorities the demolitions were carried out to eliminate weapons-smuggling tunnels. According to human rights groups the demolitions were collective punishment.|$|R
50|$|The United Nations {{peacekeeping}} force in south Lebanon {{has said that}} it wants to clearly mark the boundary between Israel and Lebanon. UNIFIL force commander Maj. Gen. Alberto Asarta Cuevas said that he met with representatives of the Lebanese and <b>Israeli</b> <b>armies</b> to discuss the UN-drawn Blue Line boundary. The Blue Line is not marked clearly. A fence Israel erected to separate the countries does not always match the official boundary.|$|R
