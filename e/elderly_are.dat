5|$|In 1871, {{producer}} John Hollingshead brought Gilbert and Sullivan {{together to}} produce a Christmas entertainment, Thespis, at his Gaiety Theatre, a large West End house. The piece was an extravaganza in which the classical Greek gods, grown <b>elderly,</b> <b>are</b> temporarily replaced by a troupe of 19th-century actors and actresses, {{one of whom is}} the eponymous Thespis, the Greek father of the drama. Its mixture of political satire and grand opera parody mimicked Offenbach's Orpheus in the Underworld and La belle Hélène, which (in translation) then dominated the English musical stage.|$|E
5|$|Although benzodiazepines {{are much}} safer in {{overdose}} than their predecessors, the barbiturates, {{they can still}} cause problems in overdose. Taken alone, they rarely cause severe complications in overdose; statistics in England showed that benzodiazepines were responsible for 3.8% of all deaths by poisoning from a single drug. However, combining these drugs with alcohol, opiates or tricyclic antidepressants markedly raises the toxicity. The <b>elderly</b> <b>are</b> {{more sensitive to the}} side effects of benzodiazepines, and poisoning may even occur from their long-term use. The various benzodiazepines differ in their toxicity; temazepam appears most toxic in overdose and when used with other drugs. The symptoms of a benzodiazepine overdose may include; drowsiness, slurred speech, nystagmus, hypotension, ataxia, coma, respiratory depression, and cardiorespiratory arrest.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSyncope in the <b>elderly</b> <b>is</b> an {{extremely}} prevalent clinical condition characterized by high mortality and presence of recurrences. The diagnosis of syncope in the <b>elderly</b> <b>is</b> sometimes difficult and multidimensional geriatric assessment should be carefully administered. Diagnostic algorithms {{should be applied}} with attention, although unknown syncope is still frequent. The therapeutic approach to syncope in the <b>elderly</b> <b>is</b> complicated by the high prevalence of neurally-mediated syncope, in which the therapeutic approach is still unknown. The establishment of a “Syncope Unit” has certainly improved the diagnostic-therapeutic approach to patients with syncope, especially in old age where the management is extremely difficult...|$|R
5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{generally}} viewed as {{safe and effective}} for short-term use, although cognitive impairment and paradoxical effects such as aggression or behavioral disinhibition occasionally occur. A minority of people can have paradoxical reactions such as worsened agitation or panic. Benzodiazepines are also associated with increased risk of suicide. Long-term use is controversial {{because of concerns about}} adverse psychological and physical effects, decreasing effectiveness, and physical dependence and withdrawal. As a result of adverse effects associated with the long-term use of benzodiazepines, withdrawal from benzodiazepines often leads to improved physical and mental health. The <b>elderly</b> <b>are</b> at an increased risk of suffering from both short- and long-term adverse effects, and as a result, all benzodiazepines are listed in the Beers List of inappropriate medications for older adults.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish Parliament {{can give}} {{legislative}} consent over devolved matters {{back to the}} UK Parliament by passing a Legislative Consent Motion if United Kingdom-wide legislation is considered more appropriate for a certain issue. The programmes of legislation enacted by the Scottish Parliament have seen a divergence {{in the provision of}} public services compared {{to the rest of the}} UK. For instance, university education and care services for the <b>elderly</b> <b>are</b> free at point of use in Scotland, while fees are paid in the rest of the UK. Scotland was the first country in the UK to ban smoking in enclosed public places.|$|E
5|$|The {{benefits}} of benzodiazepines are least {{and the risks}} are greatest in the elderly. The <b>elderly</b> <b>are</b> at {{an increased risk of}} dependence and are more sensitive to the adverse effects such as memory problems, daytime sedation, impaired motor coordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls, and an increased risk of hip fractures. The long-term effects of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine dependence in the elderly can resemble dementia, depression, or anxiety syndromes, and progressively worsens over time. Adverse effects on cognition can be mistaken for the effects of old age. The {{benefits of}} withdrawal include improved cognition, alertness, mobility, reduced risk incontinence, and a reduced risk of falls and fractures. The success of gradual-tapering benzodiazepines is as great in the elderly as in younger people. Benzodiazepines should be prescribed to the elderly only with caution and only for a short period at low doses. Short to intermediate-acting benzodiazepines are preferred in the elderly such as oxazepam and temazepam. The high potency benzodiazepines alprazolam and triazolam and long-acting benzodiazepines are not recommended in the elderly due to increased adverse effects. Nonbenzodiazepines such as zaleplon and zolpidem and low doses of sedating antidepressants are sometimes used as alternatives to benzodiazepines.|$|E

25|$|The <b>elderly</b> <b>are</b> {{especially}} {{susceptible to}} {{increased risk of}} harm from motor impairments and drug accumulation side effects. Benzodiazepines also require special precaution if used by individuals that may be pregnant, alcohol- or drug-dependent, or may have comorbid psychiatric disorders. Clonazepam is generally not recommended for use in elderly people for insomnia due to its high potency relative to other benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|Zaleplon is not {{recommended}} for chronic use in the elderly. The <b>elderly</b> <b>are</b> {{more sensitive to the}} adverse effects of zaleplon such as cognitive side effects. Zaleplon may increase the risk of injury among the elderly.

25|$|The elderly metabolize benzodiazepines {{more slowly}} than younger {{individuals}} and are also {{more sensitive to the}} effects of benzodiazepines, even at similar blood plasma levels.

Long-acting benzodiazepines such as clonazepam are not generally recommended for the elderly due the risk of drug accumulation.|$|E

25|$|While {{there are}} {{certainly}} programs available {{for use by the}} elderly in Thailand, questions of equity have risen since their introduction.

25|$|Healthy ageing implies optimal {{well-being}} {{in spite}} of barriers resulting from age. The global population is ageing {{and will continue to}} have communication inabilities unless barriers of communication with the <b>elderly</b> <b>are</b> more highly promoted. Sensory impairments include hearing and vision deficits, which can cause communication barriers. Changes in cognition, hearing, and vision are easily associated with healthy ageing and can cause problems when diagnosing dementia and aphasia due to the similarities.|$|E
25|$|Adverse {{effects of}} benzodiazepines such as {{diazepam}} include anterograde amnesia and confusion (especially pronounced in higher doses) and sedation. The <b>elderly</b> <b>are</b> {{more prone to}} adverse effects of diazepam, such as confusion, amnesia, ataxia, and hangover effects, as well as falls. Long-term use of benzodiazepines such as diazepam is associated with drug tolerance, benzodiazepine dependence, and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Like other benzodiazepines, diazepam can impair short-term memory and learning of new information. While benzodiazepine drugs such as diazepam can cause anterograde amnesia, they do not cause retrograde amnesia; information learned before using benzodiazepines is not impaired. Tolerance to the cognitive-impairing effects of benzodiazepines does not tend to develop with long-term use, and the <b>elderly</b> <b>are</b> more sensitive to them. Additionally, after cessation of benzodiazepines, cognitive deficits may persist {{for at least six}} months; it is unclear whether these impairments take longer than six months to abate or if they are permanent. Benzodiazepines may also cause or worsen depression. Infusions or repeated intravenous injections of diazepam when managing seizures, for example, may lead to drug toxicity, including respiratory depression, sedation and hypotension. Drug tolerance may also develop to infusions of diazepam if it is given for longer than 24 hours. Adverse effects such as sedation, benzodiazepine dependence, and abuse potential limit the use of benzodiazepines.|$|E
