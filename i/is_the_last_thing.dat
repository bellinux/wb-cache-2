5|$|Nani is a {{young man}} who specialises in {{preparing}} fireworks. He is in love with his neighbour Bindu, a micro artist who runs Project 511, a non-governmental organisation (NGO). Bindu also develops feelings for Nani though she does not express them. Seeking to raise money for her NGO, Bindu visits the office of a rich, powerful industrialist named Sudeep, who also finds her attractive. He befriends her, donates 1.5 million (US$ thousand), and gains her trust. Sudeep sees Nani as a rival and plans to kill him. One night, Nani helps Bindu to finish a piece of micro art—a locket made from a pencil. While returning home, he is kidnapped by Sudeep, who kills him, making his death look like an accident. Unaware of the incident, Bindu proposes to the dying Nani by telephone; it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> Nani hears before he is reincarnated as a housefly that cannot remember its previous life.|$|E

Leonid Radzikhovsky, a political analyst and independent journalist, wrote that gaining new territories <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> Russia needs and compared the support of foreign separatists to throwing stones at one's neighbours, while living in the glass house.|$|E
25|$|Jude McGregor: Callum's older brother, {{who holds}} a grudge against Sephy, who he {{believes}} {{to be responsible for}} his brother's death. He hates all crosses but becomes romantically inclined towards a cross, Cara, to use her for her money. Despite his best efforts, he starts to have genuine feelings for Cara, but the resultant confusion and his conflicting emotions ultimately prove too much. He ends up beating her to death and taking all her money. He later attempts to use Callie Rose to get back at Sephy, by training her to be a terrorist, but his plan backfires when Jasmine takes the bomb and activates it in his hotel room. Before he is killed in the bomb blast, he finally admits his feelings for Cara to himself, as she <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> he sees before he is killed.|$|E

[...] Many grunge artists were uncomfortable with their success and the resulting attention it brought. Nirvana's Kurt Cobain told Michael Azerrad, [...] "Famous <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> I wanted to be." [...] Pearl Jam also felt the burden of success, with much of the attention falling on frontman Eddie Vedder.|$|E

What {{do you do if}} the couple think they're in love? It's less easy if the girl consents. ... The judges cannot do very much by themselves. Sending them [...] to jail per se will not make them reflect on their lives. That <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> that is going to happen.

500|$|Later {{that year}} the serial {{included}} a storyline which was branded [...] "bizarre" [...] after it mirrored {{a real life}} scandal that had occurred weeks earlier. Lewis who plays love interest Geoff had been {{caught up in a}} sex tape scandal which leaked onto the internet, the serial decided to include Nicole making a sex tape with Trey Palmer (Luke Bracey) and having it leaked. Trey filmed without Nicole's consent, when she found out the truth she ended their relationship. Trey thought she and Geoff were getting back together so aired the tape at a local film festival to gain revenge. James described Nicole's state of mind adding, [...] "She's quite vulnerable at the moment, with her dad, Roman, in prison. She's relying on Trey, so this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> she needs." ...|$|E
500|$|In her 2014 biography, Valerie Solanas, Breanne Fahs {{argues that}} it is {{unlikely}} that Solanas appeared at the Chelsea Hotel looking for Girodias. Fahs states that Girodias may have fabricated the account in order to boost sales of the SCUM Manifesto, which he had published. Fahs states that [...] "the more likely story ... places Valerie at the Actor's Studio at 432 West Forty-Fourth Street early that morning." [...] Actress Sylvia Miles states that Solanas appeared at the Actor's Studio looking for Lee Strasberg, asking to leave her play for him. Miles said that Solanas [...] "had a different look, a bit tousled, like somebody whose appearance <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> on her mind." [...] Miles told Solanas that Strasberg would not be in until the afternoon. Miles said that she accepted a copy of the play from Solanas and then [...] "... shut the door because I knew she was trouble. I didn't know what sort of trouble, but I knew she was trouble." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{series is}} {{illustrated}} by Fiona Staples, who was introduced to Vaughan by their mutual friend, writer Steve Niles, with whom Staples worked on Mystery Society. Vaughan, who did not meet Staples in person until just before their panel at the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con, explained his selection of Staples by describing his reaction upon first seeing her work, saying [...] "Her artwork is incredible. [...] doesn't look like anyone else. She is very unique. When I opened up this file I was like, 'This is going to work! Staples is co-owner of Saga and was given first billing {{on the cover of}} issue 31. In addition to designing all the characters, vehicles and alien races in the story, she provides painted covers and hand-letters Hazel's narration using her own handwriting, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> she does after finishing the artwork on a page. Staples renders the characters in a pen-and-ink style line while using all-color settings inspired by video games and Japanese animation. At the 2012 Image Expo, Staples described the process by which she produces her art as harkening back to animation cels, in which emphasis is placed on figures and backgrounds. Vaughan has stated that Staple's style has influenced the direction of the story. The character Ghüs, for example is entirely Staples' creation. Another example is the organic forms of most of the series' technology, such as the main characters' wooden rocket ship, which is derived from Staples' dislike of drawing mechanical objects. To design the series' various planetary settings, Staples looks to the real world for inspiration and then exaggerates some elements of them. Some rooms on the planet Cleave, for example, were inspired by Cambodian architecture.|$|E

2500|$|Randall Collins {{states that}} for Nagarjuna, {{ultimate}} reality was [...] "shunyata, emptiness". In Nagarjuna's thesis, adds Collins, this emptiness {{is not a}} negation, but the premise that [...] "no concepts are intelligible". David Kalupahana states that this topic has been debated by ancient and medieval Buddhist metaphysicians, with a divergence of views; emptiness is a view, adds Kalupahana, but [...] "holding up emptiness as an absolute or ultimate truth without reference to that which is empty <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> either the Buddha or Nāgārjuna would advocate".|$|E

2500|$|The seder {{is replete}} with questions, answers, and unusual {{practices}} (e.g. the recital of Kiddush which is not immediately followed by the blessing over bread, which is the traditional procedure for all other holiday meals) to arouse the interest and curiosity of the children at the table. The children are also rewarded with nuts and candies when they ask questions {{and participate in the}} discussion of the Exodus and its aftermath. Likewise, they are encouraged to search for the afikoman, the piece of matzo which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> eaten at the seder. Audience participation and interaction is the rule, and many families' seders last long into the night with animated discussions and much singing. The seder concludes with additional songs of praise and faith printed in the Haggadah, including Chad Gadya ("One Little Kid" [...] or [...] "One Little Goat").|$|E
2500|$|Erickson was an irrepressible {{practical}} joker, {{and it was}} {{not uncommon}} for him to slip indirect suggestions into all kinds of situations, including in his own books, papers, lectures and seminars. For example, a student arrived at one of the five-day intensive seminars he held in his home office {{near the end of his}} life. When Erickson asked why she had come, she replied frankly: [...] "My teacher told me that I should come to see you before you died." [...] Erickson smiled and said: [...] "You tell him that dying <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> I intend to do." [...] The group laughed at the pun. Then Erickson said, with a twinkle in his eye, [...] "Do you want to know how to avoid dying? Always wake up every morning.

2500|$|Palmerston enjoyed robust {{health in}} old age, living at Romsey {{in his home}} Foxhills, built in about 1840. On 12 October 1865 he caught a chill, and instead of {{retiring}} immediately to bed he spent {{an hour and a}} half dawdling. He then had a violent fever but his condition stabilised for the next few days. However, on the night of 17 October his health worsened, and when his doctor asked him if he believed in regeneration of the world through Jesus Christ, Palmerston replied: [...] "Oh, surely." [...] His last words were, [...] "That's Article 98; now go on to the next." [...] (He was thinking about diplomatic treaties.) An apocryphal version of his last words is: [...] "Die, my dear doctor? That <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> I shall do." [...] He died at 10:45 am on Wednesday, 18 October 1865 two days before his eighty-first birthday. Although Palmerston wanted to be buried at Romsey Abbey, the Cabinet insisted that he should have a state funeral and be buried at Westminster Abbey, which he was, on 27 October 1865. He was the fourth person not of royalty to be granted a state funeral (after Sir Isaac Newton, Lord Nelson, and the Duke of Wellington).|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the film, {{the camera}} moves slowly towards a wall in the Overlook and a 1921 photograph, {{revealed}} to include Jack Torrance seen at the middle of a 1921 party. In an interview with Michel Ciment, Kubrick overtly declared that the photograph suggests that Jack was a reincarnation of an earlier official at the hotel. Still, this has not stopped interpreters from developing alternative readings, such as that Jack has been [...] "absorbed" [...] into the Overlook Hotel. Film critic Jonathan Romney, while acknowledging the absorption theory, wroteAs the ghostly butler Grady (Philip Stone) tells him during their chilling confrontation in the men's toilet, 'You're the caretaker, sir. You've always been the caretaker.' Perhaps in some earlier incarnation Jack really was around in 1921, and it's his present-day self that is the shadow, the phantom photographic copy. But if his picture has been there all along, why has no one noticed it? After all, it's right {{at the center of the}} central picture on the wall, and the Torrances have had a painfully drawn-out winter of mind-numbing leisure in which to inspect every corner of the place. Is it just that, like Poe's purloined letter, the thing in plain sight <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> you see? When you do see it, the effect is so unsettling because you realise the unthinkable was there under your nose – overlooked – the whole time.|$|E
2500|$|Upon its release, Damita Jo {{received}} {{positive to}} mixed reviews from most music critics. The album holds an average score of 53 based on 13 reviews on Metacritic. Jesse Washington of The Associated Press commended Damita Jo as [...] "sinfully appealing" [...] and [...] "infectious," [...] saying [...] "relaxation <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> on her agenda with this sinfully appealing concoction of infectious beats and scandalous lyrics." [...] Washington added, [...] "Such content isn’t unusual in today’s pop culture landscape, where cable TV’s raunch is stealing viewers and awards from broadcast networks and the Cat in the Hat tells dirty jokes on movie screens." [...] Jackson's voice was considered [...] "sweet and frosting-light" [...] among the record's [...] "excellent tunes," [...] specifying [...] "We {{look for her}} to entertain us with excellent videos, saturate the radio with catchy tunes, and move our bodies in the club. Damita Jo" [...] has the goods to do exactly that." [...] USA Today rated the album {{three out of four}} stars, saying Jackson [...] "isn't sweating it musically" [...] despite negative publicity. The critique regarded Jackson to [...] "freely pursues her sexual and love fantasies", noting [...] "If she ever seemed tentative in her erotic explorations in the past, she's completely self-assured here. [...] This is a happy, loving Jackson, as prone to romantic walks on the beach as to roadside quickies." [...] Its premise of split personae was considered [...] "a bit complicated", but clarified [...] "that's who Damita Jo is." [...] Jackson's new collaborators were said to induece a [...] "freshening" [...] effect while maintaining familiarity.|$|E
