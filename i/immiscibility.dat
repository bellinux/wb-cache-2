25|$|Ethanol's {{miscibility}} {{with water}} {{contrasts with the}} <b>immiscibility</b> of longer-chain alcohols (five or more carbon atoms), whose water miscibility decreases sharply {{as the number of}} carbons increases. The miscibility of ethanol with alkanes is limited to alkanes up to undecane: mixtures with dodecane and higher alkanes show a miscibility gap below a certain temperature (about 13°C for dodecane). The miscibility gap tends to get wider with higher alkanes and the temperature for complete miscibility increases.|$|E
25|$|A {{mixture of}} 5% water with 95% {{tetrahydrofuran}} {{is an example}} of an azeotrope that can be economically separated using a pressure swing – a swing in this case between 1 atm and 8 atm. By contrast the composition of the water to ethanol azeotrope discussed earlier is not affected enough by pressure to be easily separated using pressure swings and instead, an entrainer may be added that either modifies the azeotropic composition and exhibits <b>immiscibility</b> with one of the components, or extractive distillation may be used.|$|E

500|$|Protactinium-233 {{is formed}} upon neutron capture by 232Th. It further either decays to uranium-233 or captures another neutron and {{converts}} into the non-fissile uranium-234. 233Pa has a relatively long half-life of 27 days and high cross section for neutron capture (the so-called [...] "neutron poison"). Thus instead of rapidly decaying to the useful 233U, a significant fraction of 233Pa converts to non-fissile isotopes and consumes neutrons, degrading the reactor efficiency. To avoid this, 233Pa is {{extracted from the}} active zone of thorium molten salt reactors, during their operation, so that it only decays to 233U. This is achieved using several meters tall columns of molten bismuth with lithium dissolved in it. In a simplified scenario, lithium selectively reduces protactinium salts to protactinium metal which is then extracted from the molten-salt cycle, and bismuth is merely a carrier. It is chosen because of its low melting point (271°C), low vapor pressure, good solubility for lithium and actinides, and <b>immiscibility</b> with molten halides.|$|E

The {{cause of this}} <b>immiscibility</b> is uncertain, but the <b>immiscibility</b> is thought to minimize the free energy between the two phases. Studies have shown {{there is a difference}} in thickness of the lipid rafts and the surrounding membrane which results in hydrophobic mismatch at the boundary between the two phases. This phase height mismatch has been shown to increase line tension which may lead to the formation of larger and more circular raft platforms to minimize the energetic cost of maintaining the rafts as a separate phase. Other spontaneous events, such as curvature of the membrane and fusing of small rafts into larger rafts, can also minimize line tension.|$|E

5000|$|In thermal equilibrium, {{each phase}} (i.e. liquid, solid etc.) of {{physical}} matter {{comes to an}} end at a transitional point, or spatial interface, called a phase boundary, due to the <b>immiscibility</b> of said matter with the matter {{on the other side of}} said boundary. This <b>immiscibility</b> is due to at least one difference between the two substances' corresponding physical properties. The behavior of phase boundaries has been a developing subject of interest and an active research field, called interface science, in physics and mathematics for almost two centuries, due partly to phase boundaries naturally arising in many physical processes, such as the capillarity effect, the growth of grain boundaries, the physics of binary alloys, and the formation of snow flakes.|$|E

50|$|Immiscible metals {{are unable}} to form alloys with each other. Typically, a mixture will be {{possible}} in the molten state, but upon freezing the metals separate into layers.

Both Magnesium-antimony and more recently lead-antimony were used in experiments at MIT. The electrode and electrolyte layers are heated until they are liquid and self-segregate due to density and <b>immiscibility.</b> They may have longer lifetimes than conventional batteries, as the electrodes go through a cycle of creation and destruction during the charge-discharge cycle, which makes them immune to degradation affecting conventional battery electrodes.|$|E

50|$|Intermediate {{compositions}} of plagioclase feldspar {{also may}} exsolve to two feldspars of contrasting composition during cooling, but diffusion is much slower than in alkali feldspar, {{and the resulting}} two-feldspar intergrowths typically are too fine-grained to be visible with optical microscopes. The <b>immiscibility</b> gaps in the plagioclase solid solutions are complex compared to {{the gap in the}} alkali feldspars. The play of colours visible in some feldspar of labradorite composition is due to very fine-grained exsolution lamellae.The specific gravity in the plagioclase series increases from albite (2.62) to anorthite (2.72-2.75).|$|E
50|$|Phase-boundary {{catalytic}} (PBC) {{systems can}} be contrasted with conventional catalytic systems. PBC is primarily applicable to reactions at the interface of an aqueous phase and organic phase. In these cases, an approach such as PBC is needed due to the <b>immiscibility</b> of aqueous phases with most organic substrate. In PBC, the catalyst acts at the interface between the aqueous and organic phases. The reaction medium of phase boundary catalysis systems for the catalytic reaction of immiscible aqueous and organic phases consists of three phases; an organic liquid phase, containing most of the substrate, an aqueous liquid phase containing most of the substrate in aqueous phase and the solid catalyst.|$|E
50|$|In organic compounds, {{the weight}} percent of {{hydrocarbon}} chain often determines the compound's miscibility with water. For example, among the alcohols, ethanol has two carbon atoms and is miscible with water, whereas 1-octanol with eight carbons is not. Octanol's <b>immiscibility</b> leads {{it to be}} used as a standard for partition equilibria. This is also the case with lipids; the very long carbon chains of lipids cause them almost always to be immiscible with water. Analogous situations occur for other functional groups. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is miscible with water, whereas valeric acid (C4H9COOH) is not. Simple aldehydes and ketones tend to be miscible with water, because a hydrogen bond can form between the hydrogen atom of a water molecule and the unbonded (lone) pair of electrons on the carbonyl oxygen atom.|$|E
50|$|Organosolv pulping {{involves}} contacting a lignocellulosic feedstock such as chipped {{wood with}} an aqueous organic solvent at temperatures ranging from 140 to 220 °C. This causes lignin {{to break down}} by hydrolytic cleavage of alpha aryl-ether links into fragments that are soluble in the solvent system. Solvents used include acetone, methanol, ethanol, butanol, ethylene glycol, formic acid, and acetic acid. The concentration of solvent in water ranges from 40 to 80%. Higher boiling solvents {{have the advantage of}} a lower process pressure. This is weighed against the more difficult solvent recovery by distillation. Ethanol has been suggested as the preferred solvent due to cost and easy recovery. Although butanol is shown to remove more lignin than other solvents and solvent recovery is simplified due to <b>immiscibility</b> in water, its high cost limits its use.|$|E
5000|$|The US Federal Railroad Administration {{moved on}} 8 August 2013 to tighten {{standards}} for shipments {{of crude oil}} from the Bakken formation (and other?) fields that contain volatile and/or corrosive chemicals, such as may issue from the hydraulic fracturing process. [...] Crude oil is classed as HAZMAT Class 3 Flammable Liquids. [...] The US regulator had ignored until 8 August 2013 the corrosive contents of Bakken formation crude oil. The <b>immiscibility</b> of crude oil and acid causes the acid to settle {{to the bottom of}} a container, and this may add to the corrosion. Given that a substantial fraction of rail stock is of DOT-111 type, the shipment of Bakken formation crude oil risks becoming more expensive over the medium term as the DOT-112 tank cars necessary for shipment will initially be relatively scarce.|$|E
50|$|Lunar granites are {{relatively}} rare rocks that include diorites, monzodiorites, and granophyres. They consist of quartz, plagioclase, orthoclase or alkali feldspar, rare mafics (pyroxene), and rare zircon. The alkali feldspar may have unusual compositions unlike any terrestrial feldspar, {{and they are}} often Ba-rich. These rocks apparently form by the extreme fractional crystallization of magnesian suite or alkali suite magmas, although liquid <b>immiscibility</b> may also play a role. U-Pb date of zircons from these rocks and from lunar soils have ages of 4.1-4.4 Ga, {{more or less the}} same as the magnesian suite and alkali suite rocks. In the 1960s, NASA researcher John A. O'Keefe and others linked lunar granites with tektites found on Earth although many researchers refuted these claims. According to one study, a portion of lunar sample 12013 has a chemistry that closely resembles javanite tektites found on Earth.|$|E
50|$|Dynamo {{theory is}} a {{proposed}} mechanism {{to explain how}} celestial bodies like the Earth generate magnetic fields. The presence or lack of a magnetic field can help constrain the dynamics of a planetary core. Refer to Earth's magnetic field for further details. A dynamo requires a source of thermal and/or compositional buoyancy as a driving force. Thermal buoyancy from a cooling core alone cannot drive the necessary convection as indicated by modelling, thus compositional buoyancy (from changes of phase) is required. On Earth the buoyancy is derived from crystallization of the inner core (which can occur {{as a result of}} temperature). Examples of compositional buoyancy include precipitation of iron alloys onto the inner core and liquid <b>immiscibility</b> both, which could influence convection both positively and negatively depending on ambient temperatures and pressures associated with the host-body. Other celestial bodies that exhibit magnetic fields are Mercury, Jupiter, Ganymede, and Saturn.|$|E

50|$|The aim of Tissue Processing is {{to remove}} water from tissues and replace with a medium that solidifies to allow thin {{sections}} to be cut. Biological tissue must be supported in a hard matrix to allow sufficiently thin sections to be cut, typically 5 μm (micrometres; 1000 micrometres = 1 mm) thick for light microscopy and 80-100 nm (nanometre; 1,000,000 nanometres = 1 mm) thick for electron microscopy. For light microscopy, paraffin wax is most frequently used. Since it is immiscible with water, the main constituent of biological tissue, water must first be removed {{in the process of}} dehydration. Samples are transferred through baths of progressively more concentrated ethanol to remove the water. This is followed by a hydrophobic clearing agent (such as xylene) to remove the alcohol, and finally molten paraffin wax, the infiltration agent, which replaces the xylene. Paraffin wax does not provide a sufficiently hard matrix for cutting very thin sections for electron microscopy. Instead, resins are used. Epoxy resins are the most commonly employed embedding media, but acrylic resins are also used, particularly where immunohistochemistry is required. Thicker sections (0.35μm to 5μm) of resin-embedded tissue can also be cut for light microscopy. Again, the <b>immiscibility</b> of most epoxy and acrylic resins with water necessitates the use of dehydration, usually with ethanol.|$|E

During the years at DuPont, his research was mainly focused on developing and applying inorganic homogeneous catalysis to industrial products such as fluorocarbons and nylon, as well as developing transition metal boryl compounds such as boryliridium complexes to facilitate transition-metal-catalyzed hydroboration of alkenes. [...] After he joined LANL, he turned his research interest into developing sustainable synthetic chemistry with multiphasic, multifunctional catalysis at low temperatures to minimize energy consumption and chemical wastes, as well as B-N containing compounds for chemical hydrogen storage. A majority of his recent research {{has been focused on}} sustainability and green chemistry, such as developing efficient transition metal-based catalysts for hydrogen storage compounds in order to utilize hydrogen as an alternate safe and clean energy resource. This research includes a broad work of B-N containing compounds such as ammonia-borane (H3NBH3) as an ideal hydrogen fuel carrier, as well as developing inexpensive earth-abundant transition metal-based catalysts such as iron complex to facilitate dehydrogenation process of ammonia-borane with less expenses. Furthermore, his study provides insight into the second hydrogen release step of dehydrogenation by isolation and characterization of reaction intermediate. Baker also works on utilizing copper and vanadium homogeneous catalysts to facilitate aerobic oxidation of lignocellulose to obtain small monomeric organic molecules which can produce more valuable chemicals and renewable biofuels. This research includes investigating reactivity and oxidation selectivity of different metal catalysts towards a variety of lignin models, a study of C-O bond and C-C bond cleavage pathways towards simple and complex lignin models, and the function of base in the aerobic oxidation process. Baker’s recent research also includes the development of tandem catalytic system to convert ethanol to n-butanol with high selectivity. N-butanol, owing to its high energy density and <b>immiscibility</b> with water, is known as a better renewable biofuel than ethanol. Additionally, Baker’s group has made substantial contributions to organofluorine chemistry, especially on metal-based fluorocarbenes, including synthesis of a variety of fluorocarbene transition metal complexes by directly introducing difluorocarbene ligands to transition metal centres such as cobalt and nickel, as well as investigating 2+2 cycloaddition reactions between metal fluorocarbenes and tetrafuoroethylene (TFE), which sheds light on a greener route to produce fluorocarbons from waste polytetrafluoroethylene materials.|$|E
