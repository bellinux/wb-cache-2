5|$|Experts {{disagree}} {{over whether}} temnospondyls were ancestral to modern amphibians (frogs, salamanders, and caecilians), {{or whether the}} whole group died out without leaving any descendants. Different hypotheses <b>have</b> <b>placed</b> modern amphibians as the descendants of temnospondyls, another group of early tetrapods called lepospondyls, or even as descendants of both groups (with caecilians evolving from lepospondyls and frogs and salamanders evolving from temnospondyls). Recent studies place a family of temnospondyls called the amphibamids as the closest relatives of modern amphibians. Similarities in teeth, skulls, and hearing structures link the two groups.|$|E
