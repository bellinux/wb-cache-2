5|$|In November 1932, it was {{reported}} that new radio equipment was to be installed at Lympne and St Inglevert operating on the 15 centimetre waveband at 2,000MHz, which would be used for the announcement of departures of non-radio aircraft across the Channel. Messages sent by radio were also printed out by a teleprinter, providing a record of the communication. The British Air Ministry and the French Ministère de l'Air co-operated in the arrangements for setting up the system, which was scheduled to come <b>into</b> <b>operation</b> in Spring 1933. It proved its effectiveness on 7 March 1933, when a non-radio de Havilland DH.60 Moth of British Air Transport failed to arrive at Lympne. The aircraft had ditched in the Channel and both occupants were rescued by a steamship bound for Amsterdam, the Netherlands. A new short-wave radio system came <b>into</b> <b>operation</b> on 16 January 1934, using equipment manufactured by Le Matériel Téléphonique, Paris.|$|E

5|$|On the ground, the CIA and the Royal Lao Army had {{initially}} {{been given the}} responsibility of stopping, slowing, or, at the very least, observing the enemy's infiltration effort.

5|$|The {{history of}} the {{ambulance}} begins in ancient times, {{with the use of}} carts to transport incurable patients by force.

5|$|Until 2009, {{the station}} had two {{operating}} furnace lines, which together {{were capable of}} burning a total of 250,000 tonnes of waste per year, and generated 20MW of electricity.

5|$|After {{the end of}} the Second World War, {{construction}} {{began on}} the second phase, the B Station. The station came <b>into</b> <b>operation</b> gradually between 1953 and 1955. It was nearly identical to the A Station from the outside and was constructed directly to its east as a mirror to it, which gave the power station its now familiar four-chimney layout. The construction of the B Station brought the site's generating capacity up to 509 megawatts (MW), making it the third largest generating site in the UK at the time, providing a fifth of London's electricity needs (with the remainder supplied by 28 smaller stations). It was also the most thermally efficient power station in the world when it opened.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – It {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} that aspects {{of sustainable development}} should be integrated <b>into</b> higher level <b>operations</b> management education. The aim of the paper is to outline the experiences gained at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden from integrating aspects of sustainable development <b>into</b> <b>operations</b> management courses. Design/methodology/approach – The paper {{is based on the}} authors’ experiences from teaching at Chalmers University of Technology, and the integration of sustainable development <b>into</b> <b>operations</b> management courses. The paper thus relies on an action research approach, similar in many ways to other papers in the field. Findings – The paper outlines several similarities between the fields of sustainable development and operations management. Although the results show that several challenges must be overcome when integrating the fields in courses. The challenges – that are scrutinized through the use of existing literature – relate to the scope differences between the fields, lack of sustainable development aspects in operations management text books, and misfit between needs and teacher competence, support, and course structures. Originality/value –The paper adds understanding by specifically addressing the integration of sustainable development <b>into</b> <b>operations</b> management courses. Universities and teachers within the field can consider the challenges outlined when integrating the two fields in courses...|$|R
5|$|Hindered by total Allied {{air superiority}} and a {{large-scale}} uprising by the French Resistance, the weak German forces were swiftly defeated. The Germans decided to withdraw towards the north through the Rhône valley, {{to establish a}} stable defense line at Dijon. Allied mobile units were able to overtake the Germans and partially block their route at the town of Montélimar. The ensuing battle led to a stalemate, with neither side able to achieve a decisive breakthrough, until the Germans were finally able to complete their withdrawal and retreat from the town. While the Germans were retreating, the French managed to capture the important ports of Marseille and Toulon, putting them <b>into</b> <b>operation</b> soon after.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 and 2009, {{the project}} met with delays {{to work on}} tramway infrastructure. Phase 1b {{of the project was}} {{cancelled}} because of a funding shortfall in April 2009.

In December 2009, media reported that the project budget was running over £545 million, and the system was unlikely to come <b>into</b> <b>operation</b> until February 2012 or later. The operating contract with Transdev was cancelled in December 2009 to reduce costs and it was announced that the trams would be operated by Edinburgh Trams Limited, a subsidiary of Transport for Edinburgh. In March 2010, Bilfinger Berger announced that the estimated completion date would be in 2014.|$|E
5|$|In early 1943, the Nazis {{decided to}} {{increase}} greatly the gassing capacity of Birkenau. Crematorium II, {{which had been}} designed as a mortuary with morgues {{in the basement and}} ground-level incinerators, was converted into a killing factory by installing gas-tight doors, vents for the Zyklon B (a highly lethal cyanide-based pesticide) to be dropped into the chamber, and ventilation equipment to remove the gas thereafter. It went <b>into</b> <b>operation</b> in March. Crematorium III was built using the same design. Crematoria IV and V, designed from the start as gassing centers, were also constructed that spring. By June 1943, all four crematoria were operational. Most of the victims were killed using these four structures.|$|E
