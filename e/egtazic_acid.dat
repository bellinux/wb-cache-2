50|$|EGTA (ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid), {{also known}} as <b>egtazic</b> <b>acid</b> (INN, USAN), is an aminopolycarboxylic acid, a {{chelating}} agent. It is a colourless solid that {{is related to the}} better known EDTA. Compared to EDTA, it has a lower affinity for magnesium, making it more selective for calcium ions. It is useful in buffer solutions that resemble the environment in living cells where calcium ions are usually at least a thousandfold less concentrated than magnesium.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} whether the antipyretic effect of dexa 2 methasone (DEX) delivered by intravenous injection (iv) on intracerebroventricularly (icv) administered <b>egtazic</b> <b>acid</b> 2 induced febrile response is relevant to the changes in cytosolic free calcium concentration of the hypothalamus. The colon temperatures were measured by a thermistor and the cytosolic free calcium concen 2 tration ([Ca 2 +]i) in dissociated brain cells was measured by Fura 22 AM. The results demonstrated that the pyretic action of <b>egtazic</b> <b>acid</b> (016 μmol, icv) was markedly inhibited by DEX (5 mg / kg,iv), but DEX (60 ～ 120 μmol / L) did′t affect [Ca 2 +]i in dissociated hypothalamus cells. Actinomycin D, which interferes with gene transcription (3 nmol, icv), completely abolished the antipyretic action of DEX on <b>egtazic</b> <b>acid</b> 2 induced fever. These findings suggest that the antipyretic action of DEX on <b>egtazic</b> <b>acid</b> 2 induced fever is related to the activation of certain gene expression in the brain,but not to the changes of transmembrane calcium ion current in hypothalamus neurons. Key words: fever; egtazic acid; glucocorticoid; actinomycin D; calcium; dexamethasone It is well established that glucocorticoids have an antipyretic action on fever induced by a variety of pyrogens[1 ～ 3]. However, cellular and molecular mechanisms by which glucocorticoids inhibit fever have not been precisely defined. Although reduction of fever by glucocorticoids has generally been at...|$|E
40|$|Experiments {{have been}} carried out with {{fibrinogen}} and with purified degradation products of fibrinogen and fibrin which demonstrate that the structure of D fragments obtained after prolonged plasmin digestion is influenced by several factors in the media. The previously described protective effect of calcium ions on the ??-chain carboxy-terminals of fibrinogen against attack has been confirmed by working at high plasmin concentrations and/or in the presence of 2 M urea. Several compounds such as EDTA, EGTA, citrate and iminodiacetic acid appear to have a separate effect. In the absence of calcium ions these compounds appear to make the ??-chain carboxy-terminal ends of the D and D-dimer fragments more susceptible to plasmin digestion. Finally, as demonstrated by experiments with purified D-E complexes from fibrinogen and with whole fibrinogen digests, the E moiety of the D-E complexes appears to be capable of protecting the D moiety against low plasmin concentrations also in the absence of calcium ions.

40|$|KEY WORDS complement; blood platelets; zymosan; {{vascular}} endothelium; vascular {{smooth muscle}} AIM: To observe {{the effects of}} activation of complements on platelets and subsequently on vascular endothelial cells (VEC) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). METHODS: Zymosan A-induced morphological change of platelets was determined with an aggregometer, and prothrombinase expression was quanitified using chromoge-nic substrate. Supernatant of zymosan A-treated platelet rich plasma (PRP) {{was added to the}} cultured VEC or VSMC for the observation of cell growth, DNA content, and the membrane microviscosity. RESULTS: Zymosan A induced marked metamorphosis, increased membrane microviscosity, and increased prothrombinase expression of platelets in PRP, but platelet metamorphosis induced by zymosan A was not found in washed platelets and fresh platelet suspended in platelet poor plasma (PPP) which had been pretreated with cobra venom factor (CVF). The effect of zymosan A on platelets was prevented by <b>egtazic</b> <b>acid</b> 5 mmol/L, Mn 2 + 10 mmol/L, tetrodotoxin 40 mmol/ L or indomethacin 100 mmol/L. The supernatant of zymosan A-treated PRP inhibited the growth of VEC, but accelerated the growth of VSMC and made most VSMC enter G 2 - and M- phase. The endoplasmic reticulum with rough surface and free ribosome in VSMC and vacuoles appeared in VEC mitochondria. CONCLUSION: Acti-vated complements induced significant shape change of platelets, stimulated platelets to release some factors and subsequently injured VEC, but accelerated the growth of VSMC, which may {{contribute to the development of}} blood coagulation and to the chronic inflammation...|$|E
40|$|Early plasmin {{degradation}} products (X fragments) of human fibrinogen were prepared {{in the presence}} of calcium-ions or EGTA, and purified on Sepharose 6 B-CL. X fragments were characterized with respect to amino-terminal amino acids, polypeptide-chain composition, anticlotting properties and calcium-binding. Amino-terminal amino acids were alanine and tyrosine. The molecular weights of the chains were about 26 000, 58 000 and 48 000 for A??-, B??- and ??-chains, respectively. X fragments were about 6 -times as potent in anticlotting behaviour as D fragments prepared {{in the presence of}} calcium ions. Calcium-binding properties were essentially identical to those of fibrinogen. No differences were observed between X fragments prepared in the presence of calcium ions and those prepared in the presence of EGTA. This indicates that the carboxy-terminal parts of the A??-chains of fibrinogen are not involved in calcium-binding and that differences in chain-remnants as observed in late plasmic {{degradation products}} (which depend on the presence of calcium ions or EGTA in the incubation medium) are introduced beyond the stage of fragment X formation.

40|$|AIM: To {{observe and}} compare the effects of {{phytoestrogen}} genistein, resveratrol and 17 β-estradiol on the tonic contraction and the phasic contraction of isolated gallbladder muscle strips and to study the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Isolated strips of gallbladder muscle from guinea pigs were suspended in organ baths containing Kreb’s solution, and the contractilities of strips were measured before and after incubation with genistein, resveratrol and 17 β-estradiol respectively. RESULTS: Similar to 17 β-estradiol, genistein and resveratrol could dose-dependently inhibit the phasic contractile activities, they decreased the mean contractile amplitude and the contractile frequencies of gallbladder muscle strips, and also produced a marked reduction in resting tone. The blocker of estrogen receptor ICI 182780 failed to alter the inhibitory effects induced by genistein and resveratrol, but potassium bisperoxo (1, 10 phenanthroline) oxovanadate bpV (phen), a potent protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, markedly attenuated the inhibitory effects induced by genistein and resveratrol. In calcium-free Kreb’s solution containing 0. 01 mmol/L <b>egtazic</b> <b>acid</b> (EGTA), genistein and resveratrol inhibited the first phasic contraction induced by acetylcholine (ACh), but {{did not affect the}} second contraction induced by CaCl 2. In addition, genistein, resveratrol and 17 β-estradiol also could reduce the contractile responses of ACh and KCl, and shift their cumulative concentration-response curves rightward. CONCLUSION: Phytoestrogen genistein and resveratrol can directly inhibit the contractile activity of isolated gallbladder muscle both at rest and in response to stimulation. The mechanisms responsible for the inhibitory effects probably due mainly to inhibition of tyrosine kinase, Ca 2 + influx through potential-dependent calcium channels (PDCs) and Ca 2 + release from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), but were not related to the estrogen receptors...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the subcellular mechanism(s) underlying increased left ventricular (LV) diastolic chamber stiffness (DCS) during angina (demand ischemia). BACKGROUNDIncreased DCS may result from increased diastolic myocyte calcium concentration and/or rigor. Therefore, we assessed the effects of direct alterations of both calcium-activated tension and high-energy phosphates on increased DCS. METHODSDemand ischemia was reproduced in isolated, isovolumic, red-cell perfused rabbit hearts by imposing low-flow ischemia and pacing tachycardia. This resulted in increased DCS. Interventions were performed after LV end-diastolic pressure had increased approximately 7 mm Hg. Initially, to determine the effects of altered calcium concentration or myofilament calcium responsiveness, hearts received either: 1) 5 or 14 mmol/L calcium chloride; 2) 8 mmol/L egtazic acid; 3) 5 mmol/L butane-dione-monoxime (BDM); or 4) 50 mmol/L ammonium chloride (NH 4 Cl). Then, to assess the contribution of decreased high-energy phosphate supply, hearts received 5) glucose (25 mmol/L) and insulin (400 μU/ml). RESULTS 1) Calcium chloride, 5 and 14 mmol/L, increased LV systolic pressure by 42 % and 70 %, respectively (p < 0. 001), indicating increased calcium-activated tension, but did not further increase DCS, implying intact diastolic calcium resequestration. 2) <b>Egtazic</b> <b>acid</b> reduced LV systolic pressure by 30 % (p < 0. 001), indicating reduced intracellular calcium, but failed to reduce increased DCS. 3) Butane-dione-monoxime and NH 4 Cl chloride affected contractile function (i. e., a calcium-driven force) but did not alter increased DCS. 4) Glucose and insulin, which increase high-energy phosphates during ischemia, reduced increased DCS by 50 % (p < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONSIncreased DCS during demand ischemia was insensitive to maneuvers altering intracellular calcium concentration or myofilament calcium-responsiveness, that is, evidence against an etiology of calcium-activated tension. In contrast, increased glycolytic substrate ameliorated increased DCS, supporting a primary mechanism of rigor-bond formation...|$|E
