The thermal response throughout the pump, and {{specifically in the}} bearing frame area, is quantified. Steady state bearing operating temperatures are measured for various lubrication options and cooling configurations. The experimental results are used to correlate an analytical thermal model previously developed to analyze response of an API 610 horizontal overhung process pump. The predictive capability of the model for bearing frame inline pumps is described. Conclusions are developed regarding lubrication and cooling requirements for bearing frame inline pumps to meet the operating temperatures required in refinery processing units...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} in situ {{measurements}} of source level radiated from various dredging ships {{were carried out}} with hydrophones attached to anchored buoys and suspended from a survey vessel to determine the noise level {{for each of these}} ships in UK coastal waters. In order to determine the distribution of the noise sources from the ships, a 7 -element hydrophone vertical line array was deployed from the survey vessel to measure the radiated noise. A digital compass was attached to the array to determine the orientation of the array to aid the beam forming. The noise from various operational modes, such as dredging in opposite directions, pump off and transit was recorded and processed to demonstrate the differences in noise levels and positions of the sources in the water column. The results of beam forming on the noise are presented and it is shown that full dredging does generate a very wide spectrum of noise and the most likely source is from the <b>inline</b> <b>pump...</b>|$|E

50|$|Earlier diesel pumps used an in-line layout with {{a series}} of {{cam-operated}} injection cylinders in a line, rather like a miniature inline engine. The pistons have a constant stroke volume, and injection volume (i.e., throttling) is controlled by rotating the cylinders against a cut-off port that aligns with a helical slot in the cylinder. When all the cylinders are rotated at once, they simultaneously vary their injection volume to produce more or less power from the engine. <b>Inline</b> <b>pumps</b> still find favour on large multi-cylinder engines such as those on trucks, construction plant, static engines and agricultural vehicles.|$|R
40|$|The overall {{optimization}} {{of diesel}} {{fuel injection equipment}} and combustion process is mandatory to fulfill the future emission regulations. Among the involved phenomena, a preliminary role is played by the strong link between the combustion behavior and the adopted strategies to promote the mixing of reactants. The aim of the present work {{is to develop a}} comprehensive modeling approach, having the capability to take the deep connection between fuel injection phenomena into account. For this scope, different computational tools, characterized by different roles, have been used and coupled, accounting for the interdependencies of the relevant sub-processes. Three main multi-step modeling approaches are outlined and then used in the analysis of practical cases; these can be summarized as follows: 1) multi-step modeling (0 D- 3 D CFD) for injection process and spray simulation with a unitary approach; 2) double step modeling (3 D- 0 D) of fuel metering component operation; 3) comprehensive multi-step lumped modeling of injection system operation, spray formation and fuel vaporization. The mechanical-hydraulic modeling of the injection systems is based on the 0 - 1 D code AMESim. To model the in-cylinder flows and the 3 D transient nozzle flow, the commercial FIRE code is used, whereas the lumped modeling of evaporation processes in cylinder ambient is self FORTRAN implemented. Several cases have been considered and the contribution of the modeling approach is presented evaluated. Two different injection system types (<b>inline</b> <b>pump</b> and common rail systems) are considered in the applications. Investigations are devoted to evaluate the influence on injection process of fuel characteristics and composition, injection strategies, injector layout, geometrical features and needle operating conditions...|$|E

50|$|Fuel is <b>pumped</b> from an <b>inline</b> {{injection}} <b>pump</b> to {{the injection}} nozzles. The injection pump is a pump with a rotational speed controller, fuel filter and a pump clutch. Some engines have an injection timing device {{instead of the}} pump clutch. The rotational speed controller is either an all-speed controller or an idle speed controller. The speed controllers are driven by the camshaft of the injection pump. The idle speed controller does affect the idle and redline speed only, while the all-speed controller affects every rotation speed. For fuel filtering a paper filter is used.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{determine}} the stability criteria of an <b>inline</b> axialpiston <b>pump</b> with an eccentric control system. The hydrostatic/hydrodynamic bearings of the swash plate was inspected with model building and simulation as method. The general approach has been to regard the swash plate as stiff, leading to the hydrostatic friction between the swash plate and the pump house to be considered more or less constant. Recent research treat the swash plate as bendable which could lead to the swash plate bearings’ friction being replaced from mixed friction to a full contact interaction between the swash plate and the pump house, with an increased friction as result. This increase in friction is theorized to increase the stability ofthe pump by limiting the movement of the swash plate in comparison to the fully lubricated bearing. ...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing.) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2002 Hot {{water used}} in the South African {{domestic}} sector is mostly heated by in-tank electrical resistance heaters. These so-called "geysers" are the major contributors to the undesirable high morning and afternoon peaks imposed on the national electricity supply grid. These peak demands continue to be of concern to Eskom. The "reduced capacity in-line water heating system design methodology" was developed to address this problem. A parallel <b>inline</b> heat <b>pump</b> water heater further reduces the electrical energy required. This paper employs a detailed statistical thermo-fluid simulation model to investigate the potential impact on the national peak electrical demand if this methodology is extensively applied in the domestic sector. The results will show that in certain areas of South Africa employing a micro heat pump for domestic hot water is a viable economic proposition. The coastal regions with the higher wet bulb temperatures and mild winter temperature fall in this category. The inland regions with their prolonged subzero temperatures requires {{a different approach to}} the standard way of using heat pumps. Implementing heat pumps for domestic use will also reduce the peak demand on the supply grid. Though the supplier of electricity will be selling less energy to customers, huge expenses in additional power stations to meet the peak demand, will be prevented. Master...|$|R
40|$|Highlights: • MIMS used to {{quantify}} the dissolved CH 4 inventory around a bubble emission site. • Conservative estimate of well 22 / 4 b seabed CH 4 emission was 1. 8 ktons yr− 1. • Stratification impedes immediate CH 4 release into the atmosphere. The dissolved methane (CH 4) plume rising from the crater of the blowout well 22 / 4 b in the Central North Sea was mapped during stratified water column conditions. Geochemical surveys were conducted close to the seafloor at 80. 3 m water depth, below the thermocline (61. 1 m), and in the mixed surface layer (13. 2 m) using membrane inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS) in combination with a towed CTD. Seawater was continuously transferred from the respective depth levels of the CTD to the MIMS by using an <b>inline</b> submersible <b>pump.</b> Close to the seafloor a well-defined CH 4 plume extended from the bubble release site ∼ 460 m towards the southwest. Along this distance CH 4 concentrations decreased from a maximum of 7872 nmol l− 1 to less than 250 nmol l− 1. Below the thermocline the well-defined CH 4 plume shape encountered at the seafloor was distorted and filaments were observed that extended towards the west and southwest in relation to current direction. Where {{the core of the}} bubble plume intersected this depth layer, footprints of high CH 4 concentrations of up to 17, 900 nmol l− 1 were observed. In the mixed surface layer the CH 4 distribution with a maximum of up to 3654 nmol l− 1 was confined to a small patch of ∼ 60 m in diameter. The determination of the water column CH 4 inventories revealed that CH 4 transfer across the thermocline was strongly impeded as only ∼ 3...|$|R
50|$|Diesel fuel {{is a form}} {{of light}} fuel oil, very similar to {{kerosene}} (paraffin), but diesel engines, especially older or simple designs that lack precision electronic injection systems, can run {{on a wide variety of}} other fuels. Some of the most common alternatives are Jet A-1 type jet fuel or vegetable oil from a very wide variety of plants. Some engines can be run on vegetable oil without modification, and most others require fairly basic alterations. Biodiesel is a pure diesel-like fuel refined from vegetable oil and can be used in nearly all diesel engines. Requirements for fuels to be used in diesel engines are the ability of the fuel to flow along the fuel lines, the ability of the fuel to lubricate the injector pump and injectors adequately, and its ignition qualities (ignition delay, cetane number). <b>Inline</b> mechanical injector <b>pumps</b> generally tolerate poor-quality or bio-fuels better than distributor-type pumps. Also, indirect injection engines generally run more satisfactorily on bio-fuels than direct injection engines. This is partly because an indirect injection engine has a much greater 'swirl' effect, improving vaporisation and combustion of fuel, and because (in the case of vegetable oil-type fuels) lipid depositions can condense on the cylinder walls of a direct-injection engine if combustion temperatures are too low (such as starting the engine from cold).|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesWe {{sought to}} {{investigate}} the effectiveness of glucocorticoid administration or continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration on endothelin and corticotropin-releasing factor release or clearance during prolonged fetal cardiac bypass and on the overall performance of fetuses. MethodsCirculating endothelin 1, 2, and 3 and corticotropin-releasing factor levels were measured in fetal ewes during a 60 -minute cardiac bypass period performed with an <b>inline</b> axial flow <b>pump.</b> Blood samples were collected before, during, and 90 minutes after cardiac bypass. Animals were divided into 4 groups. The betamethasone group (n = 6) received maternal treatment with 12 mg of betamethasone 1 and 2 days before the experiment. The methylprednisolone group (n = 5) received fetal treatment with 40 mg/kg intravenous methylprednisolone {{at the beginning of}} cardiac bypass. The continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration group (n = 4) underwent continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration with a 0. 3 -m 2 polysulfone filter during cardiac bypass. The final group was the control group (n = 4). ResultsMaternal steroid pretreatment failed to decrease endothelin or corticotropin-releasing factor production when compared with levels in the control animals. Fetal treatment with methylprednisolone produced a significant decrease in endothelin 2 production during cardiac bypass (P <. 02) and endothelin 1 production {{at the end of the}} experiment (P <. 02). Continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration blocked completely the increase of endothelin and corticotropin-releasing factor levels during cardiac bypass (P <. 02), which was maintained 90 minutes after cardiac bypass. Acid-base balance was preserved during cardiac bypass by the continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration but worsened after disconnection of the extracorporeal circuit, whereas animals treated with methylprednisolone had better pH, Paco 2, and bicarbonate levels by the end of the experiment. The overall tolerance of the procedure was better in the continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration group during cardiac bypass and in the methylprednisolone group at the end of the experiment. ConclusionsContinuous venovenous hemodiafiltration provides sustained stability of endothelin levels during fetal cardiac bypass. This technique might help, in association with fetal steroid treatment, to contain the inflammatory response leading to postbypass placental dysfunction...|$|R
