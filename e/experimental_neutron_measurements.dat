40|$|AbstractWe present Monte Carlo {{simulation}} {{data about}} Holmium magnetic thin film structures. As well known, this rare earth shows, at transition temperature TN, a helical {{order in the}} bulk phase. In contrast with the collinear ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic thin films, recent experimental works have proven that the transition temperature TN(n) (n being the film thickness) depends on n only by an empirical relation. In order to study the behavior of these film structures, we consider a Heisenberg model with easy-plane single ion anisotropy and seven coupling constant (J 0 in the plane and J 1 −J 6 between plane of the Ho hcp structure), obtained by <b>experimental</b> <b>neutron</b> <b>measurements...</b>|$|E

40|$|While spacecrafts {{experience}} temperatures from- 120 to 110 °C on the orbit, their surface reaches {{extremely high}} temperatures, well above 1000 °C, during descent {{into the atmosphere}} due to aerodynamic heating. Sophisticated insulation systems are designed for thermal protection. One of the steps in designing a protection system is <b>experimental</b> temperature <b>measurements.</b> <b>Neutron</b> flux induces point defects formation and accumulation in diamond and SiC single crystals, which causes overall lattice expansion. During thermal annealing this process is reversed, so the annealing temperature and time result in the “reduced ” lattice parameter (measured by X-Ray diffraction), which allows determining the maximum temperature, if the exposure time is known. This paper describes the use of irradiated single crystal high temperature sensors for measuring temperatures in thermal protection systems during spacecraft descent, {{as well as other}} space applications.

40|$|Accurate {{real-time}} {{monitoring of the}} reactivity is crucial to guarantee the safe oper-ations of all nuclear reactors. Several standard procedures are well-assessed for the on-line reactivity determination in critical reactor systems. For Accelerator-Driven Systems (ADS) the evaluation of such parameter is still a challenging task in {{the perspective of the}} development of such technology and for its scalability up to in-dustrial design. Several research programs (i. e. MUSE, FREY A) have been devoted to estimation of reactivity, testing them against various experiments. In this framework, the research activity performed during the Ph. D. program is focused on the development and assessment of a novel method for on-line reactiv-ity monitoring. The algorithm proposed, once implemented in a numerical tool, has been assessed for both source-free and source-driven systems. Several tests are performed using simulated experiments, (i. e. detector flux signals generated by nu-merical codes) providing promising results. The influence of the statistical noise in the accuracy of the reactivity estimation is investigated in order to prove the adequateness of the method when applied to real experimental detections. The ap-plication of the method to <b>experimental</b> <b>neutron</b> flux <b>measurements</b> has been carried out both critical and subcritical systems. The Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) Tur-bine Trip (TT) Benchmark based on the Turbine Trip test 2 (TT 2) in the American Peach Bottom 2 reactor is considered as an interesting test for the method in a typical thermal power reactor. The FREYA (Fast Reactor Experiments for hYbrid Applications) project provided the opportunity to test the method with real data of a source-driven system. The activities of IAEA Collaboration Research Project on Accelerator-Driven Systems (ADS) and Use of Low Enriched Uranium (LEU) in ADS consituted a good framework to apply the technique to further research facil-ities. In particular the collaboration with the Kyoto University Research Institute (KURRI), Japan, gave the possibility to use the method for the interpretation of the experiments involving the Kyoto University Critical Assembly (KUCA...|$|R
