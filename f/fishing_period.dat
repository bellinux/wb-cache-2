25|$|The {{southern}} school whiting (also {{known as}} the silver whiting or trawl whiting) is a common smelt whiting that inhabits the south and south-west coasts of Australia, and {{is closely related to}} the eastern school whiting. It is commonly caught by recreational fishermen, often while fishing for related species, especially the sought after King George whiting. Southern school whiting are taken on a variety of baits, with their natural prey such as marine worms, molluscs, prawns and sardines often used. Due to their schooling nature, many fish can be caught in a single <b>fishing</b> <b>period,</b> although most authorities ask for excess fish to be returned to the water alive. In Western Australia, southern school whiting and yellowfin whiting have a combined bag limit of 40 per person with no size restrictions, with no regulations applying elsewhere.|$|E

Also, {{in the north of}} the country, the main <b>fishing</b> <b>period</b> coincided with the haymaking period in the autumn. This resulted in underdevelopment of fishing because labor was devoted to haymaking. In the South, by contrast, the main <b>fishing</b> <b>period</b> was from February to July. Some historians have described Icelandic society as a highly conservative farming society. Because of the demand for farmhands in the short summers, tenant farmers and landowners opposed the formation of fishing villages. Fishing was considered risky compared to farming, and the Alþingi passed many resolutions restricting or forbidding landless tenants from living in coastal villages to pursue fishing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Using a bioeconomic {{model of}} the cod (Gadus morhua) and capelin (Mallotus villosus) {{fisheries}} of the Barents Sea, this study assesses {{the role of the}} fishermen’s behavior in reducing or intensifying the effects on the stocks caused by altered population dynamics. The analysis focuses on the economic development of the fisheries employing a coupled stock size–hydrography-based fishing strategy, which attempts to maximize returns from fishing over a given number of <b>fishing</b> <b>periods.</b> Results show that if the fishing strategy is based on a short optimization period of only two <b>fishing</b> <b>periods,</b> changes in population dynamics have a direct influence on the returns from fishing due to the strong pressure on the stocks applied by the fisheries. If the strategy is based on a longer optimization <b>period,</b> <b>fishing</b> activities may be deferred to allow for stock regrowth, which improves the economic performance of the fisheries. However, in that case, the relationship between population dynamics and fishing activities becomes less clear, as even a reduction of the carrying capacities of the two species allows for an increase in the amount of fish landed without causing a stock collapse due to an increased efficiency of fleet utilization. The simulations indicate that management considerations and the time horizon of the fishing strategy dominate the influence of altered population dynamics on the develop-ment of the stocks considered in the model...|$|R

The fishing grounds are shallow semi-enclosed locations with large tidal flows, freshwater inflows and abundant food. The average {{weight of a}} jellyfish when harvested is 2.5 kg, and in 2005, the recovery rate of reared jellyfish was 3.2%, {{with a total of}} 12,500 tons of reared jellyfish being caught.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explain under which {{circumstances}} using TACs as instrument to manage a fishery along with <b>fishing</b> <b>periods</b> may be interesting from a regulatory point of view. In order to do this, the deterministic analysis of Homans and Wilen (1997) and Anderson (2000) is extended to a stochastic scenario where the resource cannot be measured accurately. The resulting endogenous stochastic model is numerically solved for finding the optimal control rules in the Iberian sardine stock. Three relevant conclusions can be highligted from simulations. First, the higher the uncertainty about the state of the stock is, the lower the probability of closing the fishery is. Second, the use of TACs as management instrument in fisheries already regulated with <b>fishing</b> <b>periods</b> leads to: i) An increase of the optimal season length and harvests, especially for medium and high number of licences, ii) An improvement of the biological and economic variables when the size of the fleet is large; and iii) Eliminate the extinction risk for the resource. And third, the regulator would rather select the number of licences and do not restrict the season length. TAC, season lengths, fisheries management, stock uncertainty...|$|R

40|$|The {{report is}} based on {{interviews}} with fishermen and written sources that deal with sandeels and sandeel <b>fishing</b> <b>periods</b> along the coast of estern Norway. Observations, stories and figures are put together in an attempt to reconstruct and understand the occurrence and changes in sandeel abundance. The sources show that sandeel fry migrating into the west coast was an annual phenomenon varying in strength. The fry was important for the ecosystems along the coast. Large amounts of fish and birds followed and fed on the sandeels. Fry-shoals recruited probably also to coastal sandeel fields (and thus also important Danish seine fishing fields). The most likely explanation for the disappearance of these fry shoals along the coast is the increased harvest on sandeel on the North Sea fields in the 1970 s onwards. This has in turn greatly reduced/removed surplus amounts of larvae/fry previously ending up along the coast of Western Norway...|$|R
