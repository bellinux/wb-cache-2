25|$|A {{sedimentary}} basin also exists off the British Columbia Coast, and some <b>exploratory</b> <b>drilling</b> {{has taken place}} there. From 1967 to 1969, Shell drilled 14 deep dry holes from the Transocean 135-F semi-submersible – some west of Vancouver, others in Hecate Strait beside the Queen Charlotte Islands. Exploration off the west coast stopped in 1972 when the federal and British Columbia governments imposed moratoria on exploration, pending the results of studies into {{the environmental impact of}} drilling.

25|$|In August 2005, an Australian mining company, Yamarna Goldfields, {{suggested}} that Niue {{might have the}} world's largest deposit of uranium. By early September these hopes were seen as overoptimistic, and in late October the company cancelled its plans, announcing that <b>exploratory</b> <b>drilling</b> had identified nothing of commercial value. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission filed charges in January 2007 against two directors of the company, now called Mining Projects Group Ltd, alleging that their conduct had been deceptive and that they engaged in insider trading.

25|$|Robert LeMeur was {{designed}} to support seasonal <b>exploratory</b> <b>drilling</b> operations in the Beaufort sea. Her typical annual operational profile would begin in May with a warm-up that would gradually bring the vessel systems online after five months of cold lay-up. After commencing break-out, the Canmar icebreakers would first carry out one or more resupply missions to the drilling islands where exploratory activities have continued through the winter. In June, the icebreakers {{would return to the}} winter base to escort the drillships to predetermined drilling locations. Once the spread-mooring system had been deployed and drilling commenced, the icebreakers would remain on site to carry out ice management by breaking up large floes that could threaten the drilling operation. Once all ice had melted, Robert LeMeur would continue with supply missions to different Beaufort Sea drilling operations.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} geological {{feature of the}} Williamson diamond mine is the kimberlite pipe on which it is located. At 146 square kilometers in area at surface level, it ranks as the largest economically exploitable diamond-bearing volcanic pipe in the world. Recent <b>exploratory</b> <b>drill</b> cores conducted by De Beers have indicated that the pipe is a pyroclastic kimberlite, not a hypabyssal kimberlite as earlier suspected.

However, a review of mine operations and long term plans continues.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the Israel National Oil Company (INOC) was granted shaft-sinking permits in the Golan Heights. It {{estimated}} a recovery potential of two {{million barrels of}} oil, equivalent {{at the time to}} $24 million. During the Yitzhak Rabin administration (1992–1995), the permits were suspended as efforts were undertaken to restart peace negotiations between Israel and Syria. In 1996, Benjamin Netanyahu granted preliminary approval to INOC to proceed with oil exploration drilling in the Golan. INOC began undergoing a process of privatization in 1997, overseen by then-Director of the Government Companies Authority (GCA), Tzipi Livni. During that time, it was decided that INOC's drilling permits would be returned to the state. In 2012, National Infrastructure Minister Uzi Landau approved <b>exploratory</b> <b>drilling</b> for oil and natural gas in the Golan. The following year, the Petroleum Council of Israel's Ministry of Energy and Water Resources secretly awarded a drilling license covering half the area of the Golan Heights to a local subsidiary of New Jersey-based Genie Energy Ltd. headed by Effi Eitam.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Canadian Marine Drilling (Canmar), the {{drilling}} subsidiary of Dome Petroleum, purchased World Saga {{with the intention}} of converting the oil tanker to an ice-resistant mobile offshore drilling unit that could continue <b>exploratory</b> <b>drilling</b> operations in the Beaufort Sea beyond the short open-water season. Previously, the company had utilized drillships that had been winterized for arctic conditions, but existing mooring and dynamic positioning systems could not keep the vessel in place in moving first-year ice. This limited station-keeping ability shortened the drilling season in the Beaufort Sea to about 100 days which was not sufficient to drill and test a typical well within one summer season. An alternative approach was to use artificial islands, either dredged islands with gradually sloping sides or sand-filled concrete structures resting on a subsea gravel berm. While caisson-retained islands were considered to be the most appropriate and cost-effective way to extend the drilling season in the Beaufort Sea, relocating them was time-consuming and expensive as the structure had to be completely reconstructed every time it was moved to a new drilling location. The new drilling unit was intended to overcome these limitations.|$|E
500|$|Tiber was {{initially}} drilled by Transocean's fifth-generation dynamic positioned semi-submersible oil rig, Deepwater Horizon, with <b>exploratory</b> <b>drilling</b> commencing around March 2009, slightly delayed from the planned date of September 2008. [...] Much of the deeper gulf reserves are buried under salt accumulations {{thousands of feet}} thick, which present a problem for seismic exploration. BP had previously developed exploration techniques to bypass this difficulty. Oil was located at [...] "multiple levels". The field was announced on September 2, 2009, and BP shares rose 3.7 percent on the news. With Tiber joining at least ten other successful Lower Tertiary explorations in the area, analysts viewed the announcement as a sign for optimism, and a harbinger of renewed interest in, and production from, the offshore Gulf of Mexico.|$|E

The female woodwasp undertakes <b>exploratory</b> <b>drills</b> {{with the}} ovipositor prior to egg-laying to assess tree suitability. Previous work has shown that this behaviour is associated with assessing the osmotic pressure of the tree. Here we show that, in addition, the ovipositor is electrophysiologically active and capable of detecting ethanol and chemical components of solvent extracts of pine needles and bark. Scanning electron micrographs of the ovipositor show the presence of structures which may have a chemoreceptive function.

500|$|A {{series of}} expeditions to test Darwin's theory by {{drilling}} on Funafuti atoll in the Ellice Islands (now part of Tuvalu) {{was conducted by}} the Royal Society of London {{for the purpose of}} investigating whether basalt or traces of shallow water organisms could be found at depth in the coral.

At the time these results were regarded as inconclusive and it was not until the 1950s when, prior to carrying out nuclear bomb tests on Eniwetok, deep <b>exploratory</b> <b>drilling</b> through [...] of coral to the underlying basalt finally vindicated Darwin's theory. However, the geologic history of atolls is more complex than Darwin (1842) and Davis (1920 & 1928) envisioned.|$|E
500|$|The ditchers took {{a number}} of steps to ensure support for their proposals. [...] In 1921, WWPC secured a {{preliminary}} permit to build a dam at Kettle Falls, about [...] upstream from the Grand Coulee. [...] If built, the Kettle Falls Dam would have lain {{in the path of}} the Grand Coulee Dam's reservoir, essentially blocking its construction. [...] WWPC planted rumors in the newspapers, incorrectly stating that <b>exploratory</b> <b>drilling</b> at the Grand Coulee site found no granite on which a dam's foundations could rest, only clay and fragmented rock. This was later disproved with Reclamation-ordered drilling. Ditchers hired General George W. Goethals, engineer of the Panama Canal, to prepare a report. Goethals visited the state and produced a report backing the ditchers. [...] The Bureau of Reclamation was unimpressed by Goethals' report, believing it filled with errors. [...] In , President Warren G. Harding visited Washington state and expressed support for irrigation work there, but died a month later. [...] His successor, Calvin Coolidge, had little interest in irrigation projects. [...] The Bureau of Reclamation, desirous of a major project that would bolster its reputation, was focusing on the Boulder Canyon Project that resulted in the Hoover Dam. Reclamation was authorized to conduct a study in 1923, but the project's cost made federal officials reluctant. The Washington state proposals received little support from those further east, who feared the irrigation would result in more crops, depressing prices. [...] With President Coolidge opposed to the project, bills to appropriate money for surveys of the Grand Coulee site failed.|$|E
