40|$|Electron beam curing of {{composites}} is a non-autoclave process, and consolidation pressure during cure has therefore {{been limited}} to that which may be provided by vacuum bagging the part, or by the application of direct mechanical force. Tooling to apply mechanical force tends {{to be limited to}} simple geometric shapes and may also block (shadow) the electron beam’s path to the composite. Vacuum bagging is readily adapted to most complex three-dimensional parts but the applied consolidation is limited to roughly atmospheric pressure and therefore cannot be relied on to collapse the expansion of volatiles during cure of the electron beam cured laminate. Preventive measures are therefore needed to reduce the factors that cause voids. A critical opportunity to reduce voids in the cured laminate is to minimize air entrapment between plies during lay-up.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that the gauged BPS baby Skyrme model with a <b>double</b> <b>vacuum</b> potential allows for phase transitions from a non-solitonic to a solitonic phase, where the latter corresponds to a ferromagnetic liquid. Such a transition can be generated by increasing the external pressure $P$ or by turning on an external magnetic field $H$. As a consequence, the topological phase where gauged BPS baby skyrmions exist, is a higher density phase. For smaller densities, obtained for smaller values of $P$ and $H$, a phase without solitons is reached. We find the critical line in the $P,H$ parameter space. Furthermore, in the soliton phase, we find the equation of state for the baby skyrmion matter $V=V(P,H) $ at zero temperature, where $V$ is the "volume", i. e., area of the solitons.

We analyze the dependency {{of the structure of the}} solutions, the energies, angular momenta, electric and magnetic fields of the configurations on the gauge coupling constant $g$, and the electric potential. It is found that, generically, the coupling to the Chern-Simons term strongly affects the usual pattern of interaction between the skyrmions, in particular the electric repulsion between the solitons may break the multisoliton configuration into partons.
