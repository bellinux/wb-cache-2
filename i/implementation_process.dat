In addition to the reassessing of pesticide tolerances, the EPA accommodated the use of special classes of pesticides, addressed the public policy issue of clinical studies to verify pesticide effects, and expedited the availability of safe pesticides.|$|E

2500|$|An {{attempt to}} change the rules was made by Condoleezza Rice and Tzipi Livni when they brought forth the concept of a shelf agreement. [...] The idea was to {{disengage}} the linkage between negotiations and actions on the ground. In theory this would allow negotiations until a [...] "shelf agreement" [...] defining peace would be obtained. Such an agreement would not entail implementation. It would just describe what peace is. It would stay on the shelf but eventually will guide the implementation. The difficulty with this notion is that it creates a dis-incentive for Israel to reach such an agreement. The lack of clarity about what happens after agreement is reached will result in insurmountable pressures on Abbas to demand immediate implementation. However, from the Israeli point of view, the Palestinians are not ready to create a stable state, such an <b>implementation</b> <b>process</b> will almost guarantee instability in the Palestinian areas with a possible Hamas takeover as happened in Gaza.|$|E

The main attempt in the dissertation is to look at the EU from a new perspective. In this direction, in the Union, policy making, <b>implementation</b> and postimplementation <b>processes</b> are functioning in some sort of a system that all the member states are (the UK in our example) in contact with all related actors out of the central government bodies in order to ensure integration in every EU policy areas (our example is biodiversity policy).

That’s to say, today, in the EU policy making, implementation and post <b>implementation</b> <b>processes,</b> different actors play active role in various levels with different methods and this circumstances happen in a cyclical mode in that a result of one process feeds the other process and this goes on in a chain...|$|R

There are theoretical and empirical accounts of ABC <b>implementation</b> <b>processes</b> and techniques in different studies. This study is a synthesis of past studies on ABC implementation in organizational contexts. Using a literature analysis of published papers over the last ten years, the study develops a typology of implementation issues by three major themes: types of organizations, methodologies used to explain the <b>implementation</b> <b>processes,</b> and the factors leading to the adoption or abandonment of an ABC system. The findings suggest that ABC is used in manufacturing, service, and even government sector organizations, organizational, economic and sociological theories are used to explain the <b>implementation</b> <b>processes</b> and finally, technical and human factors affect the implementation or abandonment of an ABC system in any organization. The comprehensive account of an ABC system implementation related major considerations reported in this paper will enhance the knowledge base of the interested academic researchers and practitioners.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{interview}} based study which explored {{the implementation of}} a major policy initiative in Queensland, Australia, with particular attention to social justice issues. Interviews were conducted with key policy actors in three sections of the bureaucracy: strategic directions, performance and measurement; curriculum and assessment; and workforce and professional development. We were interested in {{the ways in which the}} tensions between redistributive and recognitive approaches to social justice were being managed in the bureaucracy. We drew on Bourdieu’s concepts of field, logic of practice, political discourse, habitus, capital, and symbolic power struggles to theorise the politics of discourse associated with such policy <b>implementation</b> <b>processes</b> within bureaucracies. The interview data revealed differences in approaches to equity issues and in the language used in the three sections of the bureaucracy. We argue that these differences, associated with the different priorities of the three sections and their differing roles in the <b>implementation</b> <b>processes,</b> reflect the different logics of practice operating within the different sections. The final section of the paper discusses the implications of the analysis for theorising equity and difference in education policy in new times, and considers the value of Bourdieu’s concepts for theorising policy <b>implementation</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R
