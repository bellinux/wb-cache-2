5000|$|In telecommunication, a {{combined}} <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (CDF) is a <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> that combines {{the functions of}} main and intermediate <b>distribution</b> <b>frames</b> and contains both vertical and horizontal terminating blocks.|$|R
50|$|Intermediate <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> {{for more}} about {{vertical}} and horizontal main <b>distribution</b> <b>frames.</b>|$|R
50|$|An {{intermediate}} <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (IDF) is a <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> in {{a central}} office or customer premises, which cross-connects the user cable media to individual user line circuits and {{may serve as a}} distribution point for multipair cables from the main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (MDF) or combined <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (CDF) to individual cables connected to equipment in areas remote from these frames.|$|R

50|$|Automated Main <b>Distribution</b> <b>Frame</b> (AMDF), (automated {{switching}} matrix, automated <b>distribution</b> <b>frame,</b> Loop Management System (LMS)), {{a technology}} to provide connectivity between subscriber (local loop, outside plant) - and office equipment (inside plant) lines {{in a telephone}} exchange (central office, CO) main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (MDF).|$|R
50|$|A {{complete}} LMS has {{software and}} hardware components. The latter is usually a switch fabric connected both to all required lines and line equipment at {{either side of a}} line. The functionality is similar to one performed by a Main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> or any other <b>distribution</b> <b>frame,</b> so sometimes is referred to as Automated Main <b>Distribution</b> <b>Frame.</b> A software component implies implementing management operations.|$|R
50|$|<b>Distribution</b> <b>frames</b> {{may grow}} to {{extremely}} large sizes. In major installations, audio <b>distribution</b> <b>frames</b> can {{have as many}} as 10,000 incoming and outgoing separate copper wires (balanced audio signals require two wires plus earth ground for each signal). Telephone signals do not use a separate earth ground wire, but some urban exchanges have about 250,000 wires on their MDF. Installing and rewiring these jumpers is a labour-intensive task, leading to attempts in the industry to devise so-called active <b>distribution</b> <b>frames</b> or Automated Main <b>Distribution</b> <b>Frames.</b> The principal issues which {{stand in the way of}} their widespread adoption are cost and reliability.|$|R

50|$|In telephony, a main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (MDF or main frame) is {{a signal}} <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> for {{connecting}} equipment (inside plant) to cables and subscriber carrier equipment (outside plant). The MDF is a termination point within the local telephone exchange where exchange equipment and terminations of local loops are connected by jumper wires at the MDF. All cable copper pairs supplying services through user telephone lines are terminated at the MDF and distributed through the MDF to equipment within the local exchange e.g. repeaters and DSLAM. Cables to intermediate <b>distribution</b> <b>frames</b> (IDF) terminate at the MDF. Trunk cables may terminate {{on the same}} MDF or on a separate trunk main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (TMDF).|$|R

40|$|The {{availability}} of <b>digital</b> <b>distribution</b> channels for media has raised several important questions for marketers. Notable {{among these are}} to what degree <b>digital</b> <b>distribution</b> channels cannibalize physical sales and whether legitimate <b>digital</b> <b>distribution</b> will dissuade consumers from using digital piracy channels. We address these questions using the removal of NBC television content from Appleâ€™s iTunes store in December 2007, and its restoration in September 2008, as natural shocks to the supply of legitimate digital content and analyzing its impact on DVD and piracy channels...|$|R
