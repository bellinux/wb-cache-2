By 1917 the assembly-line work force had increased to 550 employees who were turning out about 2500 instruments a month using a new <b>hydraulic</b> <b>expansion</b> process which Greenleaf introduced to the plant. In 1917 Conn introduced the Pan American brand for its second-line instruments. Conn founded the subsidiary Pan American Band Instrument Company in 1919 and later that year moved production of second-line instruments to the old Angledile factory. By 1930 the Pan American company was fully absorbed by Conn, but the Pan American brand for Conn's second-line instruments remained in use until 1955. By 1920 Conn was producing a complete line of saxophones. In this area they had stiff competition from other big saxophone makers such as Buescher and Martin. Around 1917 Conn introduced drawn tone holes (after a patent by W.S. Haynes in 1914) eliminating the necessity of soft-soldering tone hole platforms onto {{the bodies of the}} instruments. Around 1920 Conn introduced rolled tone hole rims, a feature that enhanced the seal of the pads and extended pad life. Rolled tone holes remained a feature of Conn saxophones until 1947.|$|E
50|$|The arteries of {{the heart}} (the {{coronary}} arteries) are the most frequent imaging target for IVUS. IVUS {{is used in the}} coronary arteries to determine the amount of atheromatous plaque built up at any particular point in the epicardial coronary artery. The progressive accumulation of plaque within the artery wall over decades is the setup for vulnerable plaque which, in turn, leads to heart attack and stenosis (narrowing) of the artery (known as coronary artery lesions). IVUS is of use to determine both plaque volume within the wall of the artery and/or the degree of stenosis of the artery lumen. It can be especially useful in situations in which angiographic imaging is considered unreliable; such as for the lumen of ostial lesions or where angiographic images do not visualize lumen segments adequately, such as regions with multiple overlapping arterial segments. It is also used to assess the effects of treatments of stenosis such as with <b>hydraulic</b> angioplasty <b>expansion</b> of the artery, with or without stents, and the results of medical therapy over time.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} of consistency limits according to Atterberg is of key importance in soil mechanics because it determines, {{in a simple}} way, results of interactions between solid and liquid phases in soils, and thus provides possibility to classify them in groups withsimilar mechanic properties. In most cases, {{the results of these}} investigations provide a good basis for predicting other properties such as deformability, <b>expansion,</b> <b>hydraulic</b> conductivity and strength of soils. This proves that basis factors influencing the valuesof consistency limits and other mechanic properties are the same. It is known that the values of consistency limits primarily depend on the type and quantity of clay minerals in soils. The article focuses on experimental evidence of dependence between the quantityof water at the liquid limit for soils and type, portion and specific surface of clay grains. Experiments were performed with monomineral soils, their mixtures and composed samples of clay- and non-clay components. It was established that in parallel orientation of clay particles the quantity of water between grains at liquid limit is dependent on their external specific surface...|$|R

First, the combined scheme was designed similar to the steam gathering scheme in the Ohaaki field (Wigly 1989); where the mixture comes from wells to the separator plant, and afterwards the plant’s steam and water are transported separately. Then, the concept of modular development of the field was adopted: the individual power plants were to be installed on individual groups of wells. Transport of steam–water mixture is not planned for distances over 500  m. Complexities of joint transportation were not relevant for this decision. The final project of Mutnovskoe plants consisted of long pipelines of steam–water mixture, but the complexity of this scheme by analogy with previous design had not been considered. Built during the construction of the plants, the steam–water pipelines were designed without the proper hydraulic calculation. Operation has shown that, in some cases, the mistakes were made in the selection of diameter for the pipelines. A small diameter led to essential pressure loss (more 2  bar/km). The inflated diameter led to stratification of the flow; liquid plugs were formed in rising sections and pulsations were created. Pipelines contained elements with great resistance, such as U-shaped compensators of thermal <b>expansions.</b> <b>Hydraulic</b> calculation of steam–water mixture pipelines in Kamchatka came to be used only after 2003 for construction of new pipelines and reconstruction of old ones.|$|R

In {{order to keep}} the reused roadway stable in its service life, numerical simulation, theoretical analysis and field observation were applied to investigate the deformation rule and failure mechanism of surrounding rock during mining period. Research results show that low strength and high stress difference environment is a fundamental reason of shear failure, different loading and unloading path in both ribs of roadway is the primary reason of asymmetric failure, and performance of bolting support is critical for the roadway stability. Therefore, control techniques of reused roadway are put forward that 1) high-strength and yielding bolts support the roof and ribs to adjust to massive convergence of roadway; 2) yielding counter-pulled cables reinforce small-pillar rib to strengthen the stability of samll coal pillar; and 3) <b>hydraulic</b> <b>expansion</b> bolts support the floor.

The proposed system as described previously would be based on the thawing-expansion/freezing-contraction behavior of a wax or perhaps another suitable phase-change material (PCM). The power generated by the system would be used to recharge the batteries in a battery- powered unmanned underwater vehicle [UUV (essentially, a small exploratory submarine robot) ] of a type that has been deployed in large numbers in research pertaining to global warming. A UUV of this type travels between the ocean surface and depths, measuring temperature and salinity. At one phase of its operational cycle, the previously proposed system would utilize the surface ocean temperature (which lies between 15 and 30 C over most of the Earth) to melt a PCM that has a melting/freezing temperature of about 10 C. At the opposite phase of its operational cycle, the system would utilize the lower ocean temperature at depth (e. g., between 4 and 7 C at a depth of 300 m) to freeze the PCM. The melting or freezing would cause the PCM to expand or contract, respectively, by about 9 volume percent. The PCM would be contained in tubes that would be capable of expanding and contracting with the PCM. The PCM-containing tubes would be immersed in a <b>hydraulic</b> fluid.

40|$|Consistency {{limits are}} {{extensively}} used in geotechnical engineering practice. These limits are {{commonly referred to}} the Atterberg Limits and the limits are the liquid limit, plastic limit and shrinkage limit. Consistency limits is potentially useful as an index property for predicting the behaviour of clay soils. The liquid limit in particular is used in many correlations with engineering properties. It provides a good basis form predicting the soil properties such as deformability, <b>expansion,</b> <b>hydraulic</b> conductivity and strength. Therefore, liquid limit has strong links to underlying mechanical behaviour. However, {{the determination of the}} liquid limit by Casagrande Liquid Limit Device and Cone Penetration Method which are in international standards have their own limitation as they requires several points to determine liquid limit of soil as these both methods uses trial and error method. This study presents the investigation on the use of oedometer method as an alternative way to determine the liquid limit of zeolite from saturated slurried condition by using a small consolidation pressure of 0. 9 kPa and 6 kPa. Thus by doing this, one can determine the liquid limit by one point determination technique as the equilibrium water content reached from the consolidation will be equivalent or nearer to the liquid limit of soil under the consolidation pressure either 0. 9 kPa or 6 kPa. The physical properties of zeolite were determined and the liquid limit of zeolite was determined from cone penetration method. The test results shows that by using a consolidation pressure of 0. 9 kPa, the value of liquid limit obtained from oedometer method is much nearer to the value of liquid limit obtained from the cone penetration method and the difference between those values obtained is less than 1 %. Meanwhile, the liquid limit value obtained by using consolidation pressure of 6 kPa does not tally and far away from the value of liquid limit obtained from cone penetration method. Hence, by using consolidation pressure of 0. 9 kPa, oedometer method can be used to determine the liquid limit of soil and for consolidation pressure of 6 kPa, other methods or different soil should be used and applied for determination of liquid limit value...|$|R

The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>expansion</b> to failure of rings o f carbon/epoxy composites represents the fust step away from the earlier studies of model systems to more realistic structures, and it appears that the rings behave {{in exactly the same way}} as tensile samples. Of greater significance, however, is the fact that polar-wound pressure vessels in the form of oblate spheroids with aluminium screw-thread end connexions also show the same kind of acoustic emission patterns. If a vessel is pressurized and held at constant pressure the acoustic output is gradually reduced until it ceases. If the vessel is unloaded and reloaded, the pressure at which emission recommences (about 93 per cent of the previous maximum) can then be considered to be a safe working pressure. The response o f these vessels to monotonic loading, cyclic loading and stress relaxation is very similar to that of unidirectional tensile samples. ...|$|E

A mathematical model has been developed to describe the dynamics of the tube-fluid system due to the pop-out phenomenon.

An analytical solution describing the wave propagation in the tube-fluid system was obtained. The model identified the potential failure locations and showed that the inherent system damping reduced the chances of failure but could not eliminate it completely. In addition, it showed that the coupling effect was more prominent in the tube as compared to the outer and inner fluids. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was conducted in order to investigate the effect of the geometrical and material properties on the response. The sensitivity analysis showed that the coupling effect vanished with the increase in tube stiffness and reached an asymptotic value with an increase in formation stiffness...|$|E

The structural integrity of tubes will be degraded by generating the corrosive crack at that location. The profilometry using the traditional bobbin probes which are currently applied for measuring the profile change of tubes gives us basic information such as axial locations and average magnitudes of deformations.

40|$|Background : Intramedullary {{fixation}} is {{the treatment}} of choice for closed diaphyseal fractures of femur and tibia. The axial and rotational stability of conventional interlocking nails depends primarily on locking screws. This method uses increased operating time and increased radiation exposure. An intramedullary implant that can minimize these disadvantages is obviously better. Expandable intramedullary nail does not rely on interlocking screws and achieves axial and rotational stability on <b>hydraulic</b> <b>expansion</b> of the nail. We analyzed 32 simple fractures of shaft of femur and tibia treated by self-locking expandable nail. Materials and Methods: Intramedullary fixation was done by using self-locking, expandable nail in 32 patients of closed diaphyseal fractures of tibia (n = 10) and femur (n = 22). The various modes of injury were road traffic accidents (n = 21), fall from height (n = 8), simple fall (n = 2), and pathological fracture (n = 1). Among femoral diaphyseal fractures 16 were males and six females, average age being 33 yrs (range, 18 - 62 yrs). Seventeen patients had AO type A (A 1 (n = 3), A 2 (n = 4), A 3 (n = 10)) and 5 patients had AO type B (B 1 (n = 2), B 2 (n = 2), B 3 (n = 1)) fractures. Eight patients having tibial diaphyseal fractures were males and two were females; average age was 29. 2 (range, 18 - 55 yrs). Seven were AO type A (A 1 (n = 2), A 2 (n = 3), A 3 (n = 2)) and three were AO type B (B 1 (n = 1), B 2 (n = 1), and B 3 (n = 1)). We performed closed (n = 27) or open reduction (n = 5) and internal fixation with expandable nail to stabilize these fractures. The total radiation exposure during surgery was less as no locking screws were required. Early mobilisation and weight-bearing was started depending on fracture personality and evidences of healing. Absence of localised tenderness and pain on walking was considered clinical criteria for union, radiographic criteria of union being continuity in at least in three cortices in both AP and lateral views. Patients were followed {{for at least one}} year. Results : The average operative time was 90 min (range, 55 - 125 min) for femoral fractures and 53 min (range, 25 - 115 min) for tibial fractures. Radiation exposure was minimum, average being 84 seconds (range, 54 - 132) for femoral fractures and 54 seconds (range, 36 - 78) for tibial fractures. All fractures healed, but few had complications, such as infection (one case with tibial fracture) bent femoral nail with malunion (n = 1), and delayed union (n = 3; 2 cases in femur and 1 case in tibia). Mean time of union was 5. 1 months (range, 4 - 10 &#x 00 BD; months) for femoral fractures and 4. 8 months (range, 3 - 9 months) for tibial fractures. Conclusion : We found the nail very easy to use with effective fixation in AO type A and B fractures in our setting. Less surgical time is required with minimum complications. The main advantage of the expandable nail is that if affords. satisfactory axial, rotatory, and bending stability with decreased radiation exposure to operating staff and the patient...|$|E
