40|$|The {{radiance}} {{measured by}} the Land Satellite (Landsat) multispectral scanner (MSS) in a given channel I, where I = 1, 2, 3, 4, is determined primarily by four quantities: 1. The reflectance ρI of the target (i. e., the element of the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s surface {{in the field of}} view), 2. The solar zenith angle θ, 3. The <b>haze</b> <b>level</b> τH in the atmosphere, and 4. The average reflectance ρI of the adjacent areas of the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s surface outside the field of view. In this paper the <b>haze</b> <b>level</b> τH is defined as the haze optical depth* at wavelength 0. 5 µm. The haze optical depth at other wavelengths X is denoted τH(λ). Normally, in the analysis of Landsat data one wishes to classify certain objects on the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s surface {{on the basis of their}} reflectance ρI. These objects may be in the same Landsat image or may be in several different images separated in space and time. Variations in θ, τH, ρI within a scene or from one scene to another change the data and therefore reduce classification accuracy. This paper describes a method for simulating the effects of such variations and correcting for them. Simulation and correction are really the same process since correction consists of simulating the MSS response if the value of the Sun angle, <b>haze</b> <b>level,</b> or background reflectance were different from the actual values...|$|E

The classification performance on the data sets using the algorithms is presented, along with results of statistical tests on the accuracy and proportion estimates.

The coatings were deposited on the substrates from water dispersions made of Ni 1 -xO pigment synthesized via the peroxo route by reaction of a H 2 O 2 /urea mixture with Ni-acetate precursor. The bunsenite Ni 1 -xO pigment was obtained after thermal treatment of xerogels at 400 degrees C for 24 h.

The tables also provide coefficients a and b such that for fixed, 9, r, and R the sensor response in a particular channel is given by C = αR + b. The minimum value method is used to determine T and RB is determined by averaging over the data. Appropriate a and b coefficients are then looked up in the tables. In most applications the signatures from a given segment (the training segment) are corrected to correspond to the same v values of 9, T, and R as some other segment. This is done by determining the a and b coefficients for each segment independently. From these coefficients the transformation is determined which corrects the training segment statistics...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE—To {{determine}} the mechanism through which topical mitomycin C prevents and treats corneal haze after photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) {{and to examine}} the effects of dosage and duration of exposure. METHODS—In 224 New Zealand rabbits, − 9. 0 diopter PRK with mitomycin C or balanced salt solution was performed. <b>Haze</b> <b>level</b> was graded at the slit-lamp. Rabbits were sacrificed at 4 hours, 24 hours, 4 weeks, or 6 months after surgery and immunohistochemistry was performed with TUNEL assay, Ki 67 and α-SMA.

A greater decrease in myofibroblasts was noted with prophylactic mitomycin C treatment than therapeutic mitomycin C treatment. There was, however, an anterior stromal acellular zone (approximately 20 % of the total stroma) in eyes treated with mitomycin C, which persisted to the maximum follow-up of 6 months.

40|$|Early season {{changes in}} optical depth change brightness, {{primarily}} along the soil line; and during crop development, changes in optical depth change both greenness and brightness. Thus, {{the existence of}} haze in the imagery could cause an unsuspecting analyst to interpret the spectral appearance as indicating an episodal event when, in fact, haze was present. The techniques for converting LANDSAT- 3 data to simulate LANDSAT- 2 data are in error. The yellowness and none such computations are affected primarily. Yellowness appears well correlated to optical depth. Experimental evidence with variable background and variable optical depth is needed, however. The variance of picture elements within a spring wheat field is related to its equivalent in optical depth changes caused by haze. This establishes the sensitivity of channel 1 (greenness) pixels to changes in haze levels. The between field picture element means and variances were determined for the spring wheat fields. This shows the variability of channel data on two specific dates, emphasizing that crop development can be influenced by many factors.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} changes in headlamp beam patterns {{as a function}} of the level of haze in sheets of plastic materials that were inserted in front of either a U. S. or a European low-beam headlamp. The level of haze was measured according to the method required by the U. S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. This method (ASTM Standard D 1003 - 92) measures the percentage of transmitted light that deviates from the incident beam through forward scatter by more than 2. 5 °. The actual effects on the beam pattern were then compared with predictions based on modeling the effects by assuming Gaussian distributions of the scattered light. The main finding is that the redictions for the four different plastic materials tested were neither uniformly accurate nor uniformly inaccurate. This lack of consistency is in agreement with the fact that the ASTM definition of haze does not uniquely specify the distribution of the scattered light. This problem with using the ASTM definition was confirmed by measuring the distributions of light scattering by two materials that had essentially the same ASTM index of haze. The implication of this research is that establishing a justifiable maximum <b>haze</b> <b>level</b> for headlamp lens materials would require using a definition of haze that uniquely defines the resultant distribution of the light scatter. Consequently, it is recommended that future research should evaluate the distribution of scattered light using actual materials for headlamp lenses after different lengths of weathering exposure...|$|E

To assess the effect of candidate fumigants on barley quality, malting and brewing trials were conducted with malting barley (Schooner), 9. 4 % moisture content, fumigated with carbonyl sulphide (COS), ethyl formate (EF) and carbon disulphide (CS 2) at concentrations of 20, 90 and 36 mg/L respectively for 7 days at 20 °C in riveted steel silos containing 33 t of barley. The appropriate industry body, the Malting and Brewing Industry Barley Technical Committee (MBIBTC) set the quality parameters to be evaluated and allocated work to the appropriate quality laboratories. Germination of fumigated barley was not affected by the fumigants. Residues of COS, EF and CS 2 in outloading barley samples were 0. 085 ± 0. 0052, 0. 4 ± 0. 1 and 2. 22 ± 0. 07 mg/kg respectively, which were below the experimental permits of maximum residue levels (MRL).

Materials and methods: Sixty eyes of 30 myopic patients were prospectively recruited to a randomized fellow eye study. Patients underwent conventional alcohol-assisted PRK in one eye (control group) and ASLA-modified transepithelial PRK in the other (30 eyes in each treatment arm). Primary endpoints were postoperative pain and haze scores at 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Secondary endpoints included visual acuity at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, corneal aberrations at 3, 6, and 12 months, and early and late onset haze. Refractive predictability, safety, and efficacy of the two methods were considered. Results: The {{average age of the}} cohort was 29 years (standard deviation [SD]: 9; range: 18 &ndash; 46), and the average spherical equivalent refractive error was - 4. 18 diopters (SD: 1. 9). At 3 days after surgery, the average pain score was 64 % lower in the ASLA group (P &lt; 0. 0005). At this point, 96 % of ASLA eyes had no epithelial defect, whereas 43 % in the alcohol-assisted group did not achieve complete epithelial healing, and required replacement of bandage contact lens.
