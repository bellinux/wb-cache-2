5|$|Due to its heat {{resistance}} and its affinity to oxygen and nitrogen, hafnium <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> scavenger for oxygen and nitrogen in gas-filled and incandescent lamps.

5|$|Although the puffball was {{originally}} described as new to science by Elizabeth Eaton Morse in 1935, {{it was not}} published validly until 60 years later. The species is named for its resemblance to Calvatia sculpta, from which it can be usually distinguished in the field by its less prominent pyramidal warts, and microscopically by the antler-like branches of its capillitium (thread-like material among the spores). Calbovista subsculpta <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> edible species while its interior flesh (the gleba) is still firm and white. As the puffball matures, its insides become dark brown and powdery from mature spores.|$|E
5|$|As Punakha Dzong {{is located}} at only 1,200 meters, you will not suffer from oxygen {{shortages}} as you would in higher places such as Paro Taktsang (Tiger's Nest), so it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> place for beginner hiker to start from, as you may struggle with altitude sickness {{in the first few}} days.

Brutal Legend will eventually get a sequel, Tim Schafer of developer Double Fine said June 13 during an appearance at E3 2017.|$|E
5|$|Common {{onions are}} {{normally}} available in three colour varieties. Yellow or brown onions (called red in some European countries), are full-flavoured {{and are the}} onions of choice for everyday use. Yellow onions turn a rich, dark brown when caramelised and give French onion soup its sweet flavour. The red onion (called purple in some European countries) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> choice for fresh use when its colour livens up the dish; it is also used in grilling. White onions are the traditional onions used in classic Mexican cuisine; they have a golden colour when cooked and a particularly sweet flavour when sautéed.|$|E
5|$|Common {{starlings}} {{will take}} over Eurasian nuthatch nest holes, reducing their breeding success. This {{is most likely to}} occur if the nest is high in a tree and there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> local breeding density of the nuthatch. Introduced ring-necked parakeets may also compete with Eurasian nuthatches for nesting holes. The parakeets tend to occur in fragmented urban woodlands, while nuthatches prefer large old oak woodlands, which reduces the level of competition. Ornithologists conducting a 2010 Belgian study suggested that the problem was not so severe as to warrant culling of the parakeets.|$|E

In January 2011, the horse competed at the Nad Al Sheba Racecourse in Dubai. He is also notable for his love of Manchester band The Smiths, citing Morrissey as an idol of his.|$|E
5|$|Hexagonal BN (h-BN) is {{the most}} widely used polymorph. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> {{lubricant}} at both low and high temperatures (up to 900°C, even in an oxidizing atmosphere). h-BN lubricant is particularly useful when the electrical conductivity or chemical reactivity of graphite (alternative lubricant) would be problematic. Another advantage of h-BN over graphite is that its lubricity does not require water or gas molecules trapped between the layers. Therefore, h-BN lubricants can be used even in vacuum, e.g. in space applications. The lubricating properties of fine-grained h-BN are used in cosmetics, paints, dental cements, and pencil leads.|$|E

5|$|In a Christianized version, the duel {{involves}} the Christian St.Elijah and the ala, {{but there is}} a belief that the saint and the dragons in fact cooperate: as soon as St.Elijah spots an ala, he summons the dragons, either takes them aboard his chariot or harnesses them to it, and they jointly shoot the ala with lightning. Arrow-shaped stones, like belemnites or stone-age arrowheads, are regarded as materialized lightning bolts imbued with a beneficial magical power, and finding one <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> omen.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} alkali metals, lithium {{has a single}} valence {{electron}} that is easily given up to form a cation. Because of this, lithium <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> conductor of heat and electricity {{as well as a}} highly reactive element, though it is the least reactive of the alkali metals. Lithium's low reactivity is due to the proximity of its valence electron to its nucleus (the remaining two electrons are in the 1s orbital, much lower in energy, and do not participate in chemical bonds).|$|E
