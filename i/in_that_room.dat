5|$|Inside, Rory {{finds himself}} drawn to an {{apartment}} with his name on it. Just as the Doctor and the others arrive, Rory finds an elderly version of himself in the bedroom. The Doctor warns that Rory's fate is now sealed—he will die <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>room,</b> without having seen Amy {{for a very long}} time beforehand. He deduces that the Angels have been using the Quay as a battery farm, sending the victims to their past while feeding off their time energy. Rory and Amy refuse to accept their fate, and as the Angels converge, they flee to the roof, where the Statue of Liberty, revealed to be a Weeping Angel, waits for them. Rory surmises that if he kills himself by jumping off the roof, he'll create a paradox that will destroy the building and the Angels, resetting the future. Refusing to allow him to die alone, Amy joins him and the two jump off the roof.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{sometimes}} {{played with the}} larger and heavier (and unnumbered) carom billiard balls instead of pocket billiard balls. Such is the case at the Union Club and was also at the University of Michigan Billiards & Games Room, where the faculty devoted {{most of their time}} to bottle pool. Not incidentally three-cushion billiards, which uses these larger balls, was also a mainstay <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>room</b> and touring three-cushion professional Carl Conlon was a fixture there until his death in 1997. In this variation, a solid-yellow (or dotted) second cue ball is used in place of the 1 ball, and the red ball, known traditionally as the , is used in place of the 2 ball. The use of such balls makes scoring by caroms easier, but makes pocketing balls (and scratching) more difficult because the larger balls must still be made in the ordinarily-sized pool pockets.|$|E

5|$|The {{title of}} the seventh and final Harry Potter book was {{announced}} on 21 December 2006 as Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was released on 21 July 2007 (0:01 BST) and broke its predecessor's record as the fastest-selling book of all time. It sold 11million copies in the first day of release in the United Kingdom and United States. The book's last chapter was one of the earliest things she wrote in the entire series.|$|E
25|$|The entire play {{takes place}} in one room, “the living room of a large and {{well-appointed}} suburban house”. <b>In</b> <b>that</b> <b>room</b> is a bar, which is well stocked with bottles of liquor. Time changes from Friday night to Saturday evening, then later the same Saturday, and eventually to early Sunday morning, but the setting remains the same. This one room {{is the focal point}} of the house, where all the characters can meet to argue about the living arrangements in the other rooms of the house.|$|E
25|$|The gatherings {{followed}} a definite ritual. First {{one of the}} members would present a paper. Then, black coffee and cakes were served; cigar and cigarettes were on the table and were consumed in great quantities. After a social quarter of an hour, the discussion would begin. The last and decisive word was always spoken by Freud himself. There was the atmosphere of the foundation of a religion <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>room.</b> Freud himself was its new prophet who made the heretofore prevailing methods of psychological investigation appear superficial.|$|E

25|$|Armstrong {{suggested}} Betsy Andreu {{may have}} been confused by possible mention of his post-operative treatment which included steroids and EPO that are taken to counteract wasting and red-blood-cell-destroying effects of intensive chemotherapy. The Andreus' allegation was not supported {{by any of the}} eight other people present, including Armstrong's doctor Craig Nichols, or his medical history. According to Greg LeMond (who has been embroiled with his own disputes with Armstrong), he (LeMond) had a recorded conversation, the transcript of which was reviewed by National Public Radio (NPR), with Stephanie McIlvain (Armstrong's contact at Oakley Inc.) in which she said of Armstrong's alleged admission 'You know, I was <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>room.</b> I heard it.' However, McIlvain has contradicted LeMond's allegations on the issue and denied under oath that the incident in question ever occurred in her sworn testimony.|$|E
500|$|Geisel {{variously}} {{stated that}} the book took between nine and 18 months to create. Donald Pease notes that he worked on it primarily alone, unlike with previous books, which had been more collaborative efforts between Geisel and his wife, Helen. This marked a general trend in his work and life. As Robert L. Bernstein later said of that period, [...] "The more I saw of him, the more he liked being <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>room</b> and creating all by himself." [...] Pease points to Helen's recovery from Guillain–Barré syndrome, which {{she was diagnosed with}} in 1954, as the marker for this change.|$|E

[...] He bade his friends goodbye and then uttered his last words, to his executioners: [...] "Kill me good." [...] The trap was sprung by means of a rope which, along with three dummy ropes, extended into an adjoining room. [...] Each of the four executioners concealed <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>room</b> pulled his rope simultaneously, but only the sheriff knew which was the trigger.|$|E

500|$|The new {{library was}} remodeled on several occasions, {{with a new}} wing added in 1941. The 1918 {{building}} was located on {{the southeast corner of}} Campus Way and Waldo Place and after the 1941 addition, had about [...] of space spread over three floors and a full basement. Designed in the neoclassical style, the exterior was made of bricks and contained decorative plaques constructed of concrete, with the gabled roof covered with tile. The original design had two-story reading rooms, which were converted to single-story rooms in the 1950s. A mural painted by J. Leo Fairbanks was added to the main reading room in 1929 as a gift from the school's class of 1925. The mural was titled Recorded Information and was the second mural <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>room</b> by Fairbanks, who was the longtime head of the school's art department.|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} in Vancouver, British Columbia. The opening sequence was filmed outside at night, though the subsequent sceneLucy's interrogation and executionoccurred in a motel set constructed on a sound stage. Atypical to the series, the motel room {{did not have a}} noticeable theme. Production designer John Marcynuk commented, [...] "That motel room was essentially a killing floor for the boys...and {{it was kind of a}} cold interrogation scene, so we tried to keep it not so friendly. When you walked through it, it definitely felt like a place [...] a murder had been committed. It wouldn't have been the first time a murder had been committed <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>room,</b> either. It was the type of place where bad things happen." [...] Marcynuk took a different approach for Gordon's death scene, utilizing green tones and a cool color palette to create a greater visual contrast with the blood.|$|E

500|$|Writer and {{executive}} producer Maurice Hurley thought that [...] "Heart of Glory" [...] was the closest experience he had on the show to directly place his own personal philosophy into a script. He later credited fellow executive producer Rick Berman with helping to write the script for [...] "Heart of Glory", saying [...] "When I had a problem, I could go in and we could sit there, close the door, yell and scream. I'd pace, he'd make suggestions. The two of us made stories work <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>room</b> {{that had to be}} shot within a couple of days. We were under enormous time pressure, and we were working hand in glove. We had a wonderful time, on that show, especially." [...] Hurley wrote the screenplay in two days from a story created by Herbert Wright and D. C. Fontana. Because of the delays, the Klingon language portions of the script didn't make any actual sense in translation and were simply Klingon sounding words created by Hurley.|$|E
500|$|During the 2016 Republican primaries, McCain said {{he would}} support the Republican nominee {{even if it was}} Donald Trump, but {{following}} Mitt Romney's March 3 speech, McCain endorsed the sentiments expressed in that speech, saying he had serious concerns about Trump's [...] "uninformed and indeed dangerous statements on national security issues". [...] Relations between the two had been fraught since early in the Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016, when McCain referred to a room full of Trump supporters as [...] "crazies", and the real estate mogul then said of McCain: [...] "He insulted me, and he insulted everyone <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>room...</b> He is a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured... perhaps he was a war hero, but right now he's said a lot of very bad things about a lot of people." [...] Following Trump becoming the presumptive nominee of the party on May 3, McCain said that Republican voters had spoken and he would support Trump. [...] McCain himself faced a primary challenge from Kelli Ward, a fervent Trump supporter, and then was expected to face a potentially strong challenge from Democratic Congresswoman Ann Kirkpatrick in the general election. The senator privately expressed worry over the effect that Trump's unpopularity among Hispanic voters might have on his own chances but also was concerned with more conservative pro-Trmp voters; he thus kept his endorsement of Trump in place but tried to speak of him as little as possible given their disagreements. [...] However McCain defeated Ward in the primary by a double-digit percentage point margin and gained a similar lead over Kirkpatrick in general election polls, and when the Donald Trump Access Hollywood controversy broke, he felt secure enough to on October 8 withdraw his endorsement of Trump. McCain stated that Trump's [...] "demeaning comments about women and his boasts about sexual assaults" [...] made it [...] "impossible to continue to offer even conditional support" [...] and added that he would not vote for Hillary Clinton, but would instead [...] "write in the name of some good conservative Republican who is qualified to be president." [...] McCain, now 80 years of age, went on to defeat Kirkpatrick, securing a sixth term as United States States Senator from Arizona.|$|E
