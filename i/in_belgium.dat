The deep disposal of high-level radioactive waste (HLW) has been studied <b>in</b> <b>Belgium</b> for more than 30 years. Boom Clay is studied as a reference host formation for HLW disposal. The Hades underground research laboratory (URL) is located at −223 m in the Boom Formation at the Mol site. The Belgian URL is operated by the Euridice Economic Interest Group, a joint organisation between SCK•CEN, the Belgian Nuclear Research Centre which initiated the research on waste disposal <b>in</b> <b>Belgium</b> in the 1970s and 1980s and ONDRAF/NIRAS, the Belgian agency for radioactive waste management. <b>In</b> <b>Belgium,</b> the regulatory body in charge of guidance and licensing approval is the Federal Agency of Nuclear Control, created in 2001.|$|E

5|$|After Napoleon's total {{defeat in}} 1815, the Congress of Vienna merged the French {{territory}} <b>in</b> <b>Belgium</b> with the Netherlands {{to form the}} United Kingdom of the Netherlands as a buffer state against the French.

The synergy of combining the manufacturing centers <b>in</b> <b>Belgium</b> with the important exporting ports in the Netherlands encouraged growth of the industrial cloth manufacturing and metallurgic centers in Wallonia. Keen to promote the economic development of the southern provinces as well, William I founded the Société Générale des Pays-Bas in 1822 to provide businesses with capital to invest in machinery. The Société Générale served as a driving force behind Belgian industrialization in the 19th century, and at its height controlled large swathes of the national economy. William I also encouraged the creation of educational facilities in the Southern Provinces, founding the State University of Leuven, the University of Liège and Ghent University in 1817.|$|E
