Reporting his observations, Harriot noted only [...] "strange spottednesse" [...] in the waning of the crescent, but was ignorant to the cause. Galileo, {{due in part to}} his artistic training and the knowledge of chiaroscuro, had understood the patterns of light and shadow were, in fact, topographical markers. While not being the only one to observe the moon through a telescope, Galileo was the first to deduce the cause of the uneven waning as light occlusion from lunar mountains and craters. In his study, he also made topographical charts, estimating the heights of the mountains.

50|$|Claudius was <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> emperor to use freedmen to {{help with}} the day-to-day running of the Empire. He was, however, forced to {{increase}} their role as the powers of the princeps became more centralized and the burden larger. This was partly due to the ongoing hostility of the Senate, as mentioned above, but also due to his respect for the senators. Claudius did not want free-born magistrates to have to serve under him, as if they were not peers.|$|E

According to Meriam-Webster, however, [...] "Palahniuk was <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> person to use the metaphor. It's the stuff of self-help books and inspirational posters and elementary school assurances. The imagery before negation is lovely; we are each unique snowflakes, each worth treasuring because each is uniquely beautiful. Palahniuk's denial of the individual's snowflake status struck a chord." [...] The unique as a snowflake metaphor has been used with elementary school students to celebrate their individuality and teamwork.|$|E
50|$|The Blind Beggar of Alexandria was <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> {{disguise}} play {{to appear}} on the Elizabethan stage; the anonymous The Knack to Know an Honest Man (1594), another Admiral's play, is one prior instance, and others can be noted. Yet the popularity of Chapman's play gave an impetus to the comic device; disguise plays were produced frequently in its aftermath. The anonymous Look About You (printed 1600), The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green (1600) by Henry Chettle and John Day, Westward Ho and Northward Ho (c. 1604-5) by Thomas Dekker and John Webster, and Ben Jonson's Every Man in His Humour (1598), Volpone (1606) and The Alchemist (1610) are among the various examples that can be cited.|$|E
50|$|Externally {{the palace}} {{is faced with}} white marble and the windows are tinted and reflective, which makes the ancient {{architecture}} in the Kremlin appear particularly picturesque. However, from the start, {{the construction of a}} large modern public building in an historic neighborhood generated quite an uproar, especially since the building replaced several heritage buildings including the old neo-classical building of the State Armory and some of the back corpuses of the Great Kremlin Palace. Although this was <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time that the Soviet government destroyed architectural heritage (notably the Chudov and Ascension cloisters) in the Kremlin and in the country in general, by the mid 1950s laws were in place effectively considering all pre-Soviet constructions as historical monuments and preventing their demolition, in someways making the construction illegal. Nevertheless, the Palace was integrated into the larger complex of the Great Kremlin Palace with walkways linking it to the Patriarchal chambers and the Terem Palace.|$|E

50|$|From {{this set}} of considerations, Boyd {{concluded}} that to maintain an accurate or effective grasp of reality one must undergo a continuous cycle of interaction with the environment geared to assessing its constant changes. Boyd, though he was <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> to do so, then expanded Darwin's theory of evolution, suggesting that natural selection applies not only in biological but also in social contexts (such as the survival of nations during war or businesses in free market competition). Integrating these two concepts, he stated that the decision cycle was the central mechanism of adaptation (in a social context) and that increasing one's own rate and accuracy of assessment vis-a-vis one's counterpart's rate and accuracy of assessment provides a substantial advantage in war {{or other forms of}} competition. The key to survival and autonomy is the ability to adapt to change, not perfect adaptation to existing circumstances. Indeed, Boyd noted that radical uncertainty is a necessary precondition of physical and mental vitality: all new opportunities and ideas spring from some mismatch between reality and ideas about it, as examples from the history of science, engineering and business illustrate.|$|E
5000|$|Allan Hunter of Screen International wrote: [...] "Love {{adheres to}} Seidl's methods of working without a {{traditional}} script and developing individual scenes from detailed planning {{and the interaction}} of professional and non-professional actors. In Love, that results in memorable, highly convincing naturalistic moments as Teresa discusses her desires and vulnerability with a giggly fellow sex tourist or bitterly confronts {{the reality of a}} country where love is a transaction rather than a genuine response of the heart. It also creates a rambling, overlong film that just doesn’t grip sufficiently to overcome the predictability of the story." [...] Leslie Felperin wrote in Variety: [...] "Ulrich Seidl's Paradise: Love is <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> film to explore the world of wealthy women and the young studs who service them; it's not even the first {{to do it in a}} sex-tourism context, having been beaten to the punch by 2006's Heading South. But it sure as hell is the dirtiest. ... Repulsive and sublimely beautiful, arguably celebratory and damning of its characters, it's hideous and masterful all at once, Salo with sunburn." [...] Also Screen International and The Hollywood Reporter compared the film to Heading South in their reviews.|$|E

5000|$|David Browne of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} album a B- rating, writing that, [...] "Although Oral Fixation is <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time a Latina act has aimed {{straight}} for {{the middle of the}} North American road and nearly lost control of the wheel in the process, it's among the most disappointing. For all the musical ingredients at her disposal, Shakira winds up with a relatively bland dish." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote that the weakest part in some songs on the album are [...] "the main(stream) hook, an attempt at radio-accessibility that white-washes the personality that sets Shakira apart from her competition." [...] Barry Walters of Rolling Stone acknowledged that, [...] "Occasionally clumsy but most often clever, Shakira's English lyrics and performances still lack the confidence of her Spanish tracks, yet Oral Fixation manages to maintain the musical credibility that Fijacion Oral won back." [...] Edward Oculicz of Stylus Magazine concluded that, [...] "Oral Fixation Volume 2 strikes a good balance between the creative audacity of its more extreme songs, all of which work as good pop, and the filler, which is well crafted and catchy." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} play {{is one of the}} {{principal}} criteria of mental health. ” 1 I n over 30 years of working with children, fam-ilies, and teachers in Waldorf kindergartens allover the world, I have observed one consistent feature of childhood: creative play is a central activ-ity in the lives of healthy children. Play helps children weave together all the elements of life as they expe-rience it. It allows them to digest life and make it their own. It is an outlet for the fullness of their creativity, and it is an absolutely critical part of their childhood. With creative play, children blos-som and flourish; without it, they suffer a serious decline. I am <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> to note this fact. The central importance of creative play in children’s healthy development is well supported by decades of research. And yet, children’s play, in the creative...|$|E

A Brief Primer on Vampire Biology I'm <b>hardly</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> author to take a stab at rationalising vampirism in purely biological terms.
