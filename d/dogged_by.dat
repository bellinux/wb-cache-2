5|$|In 1762, George III {{acquired}} Buckingham House {{and it was}} enlarged {{over the}} next 75 years. During the 18th century, London was <b>dogged</b> <b>by</b> crime, and the Bow Street Runners were established in 1750 as a professional police force. In total, more than 200 offences were punishable by death, including petty theft. Most children born in the city died before reaching their third birthday.|$|E
5|$|In {{the seasons}} {{following}} the FA Cup triumph, {{the club was}} <b>dogged</b> <b>by</b> allegations of financial irregularities, culminating in the suspension of seventeen players in 1906, including captain Billy Meredith, who subsequently moved across town to Manchester United. A fire at Hyde Road destroyed the main stand in 1920, and in 1923 the club moved to their new purpose-built stadium at Maine Road in Moss Side.|$|E
5|$|Nixon's {{career was}} {{frequently}} <b>dogged</b> <b>by</b> his persona and the public's perception of it. Editorial cartoonists and comedians often exaggerated his appearance and mannerisms, {{to the point}} where the line between the human and the caricature became increasingly blurred. He was often portrayed with unshaven jowls, slumped shoulders, and a furrowed, sweaty brow.|$|E

2500|$|The SI Limited {{averaged}} 40.7mph from Christchurch to Oamaru {{while the}} Daylight, Lark and Pochantas and Cavalier just beat that at 43mph, <b>dogged</b> [...] <b>by</b> grades {{and the same}} [...] political demands for extra stops. [...] The last British steam express routes were London-Southampton-Bournemouth, 1967 (107 miles, 1 stop, 2.05 hrs); Edinburgh–Aberdeen, 1966 (151 miles, 4 stops, 3hrs) and London to Exeter 1964 (171 miles, 4hrs) & Liverpool to Glasgow in 1967 (2.5 hrs), were fast and demanding.|$|R
50|$|A deeply private person, Stow's {{life was}} <b>dogged</b> at times <b>by</b> {{loneliness}} and depression (including two suicide attempts), probable alcoholism, {{an addiction to}} prescription drugs, and a struggle {{to come to terms}} with his homosexuality in a time when it was oppressed.|$|R
5|$|Off the field, Miller was <b>dogged</b> <b>by</b> {{speculation}} as {{to whether}} he would honour a contract he had signed with Rawtenstall Cricket Club in the English Lancashire League, which would have ended his Test career. Miller resolved that he would remain in Australia, and accepted a job offer in New South Wales, but kept his decision private.|$|E
5|$|Bruce {{was among}} five former Premier League players signed by Birmingham manager Trevor Francis to add {{experience}} to a squad expected to challenge for promotion. He was made {{captain of the}} team, but his Birmingham career was <b>dogged</b> <b>by</b> a series of disagreements with Francis. Director David Sullivan {{felt the need to}} publicly deny rumours that Bruce was lined up to replace Francis as manager after the club's stock market flotation. While playing for Birmingham, Bruce was the subject of several bids from his old Manchester United colleague Bryan Robson to sign for Middlesbrough, but the transfer never happened.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the growth}} of Canberra and the ACT was slow. The American {{architect}} Walter Burley Griffin won the competition to design Australia's new capital and was appointed to oversee its construction. He was frequently <b>dogged</b> <b>by</b> disputes with Australian authorities and the onset of World War I, which hindered progress. In 1921, Burley Griffin was fired, and multiple planning bodies were established, but achieved little, {{in part due to}} the Great Depression.|$|E
25|$|An archeological dig led by Ron Williamson to {{mark the}} 200th anniversary of the war shed {{new light on the}} battle. The dig {{unearthed}} evidence that the destruction of the magazine and its impact on US forces was bad luck. The Americans just happened to be at the exact distance of the shock wave and its debris field. The documentary film Explosion 1812 argues that the battle had a much greater impact than previously assumed. The mistreatment by US forces of the civilian Canadian population, <b>dogged</b> resistance <b>by</b> militia and the burning of British symbols and buildings after the battle led to a hardening of Canadian popular opinion.|$|R

50|$|<b>By</b> <b>dogged</b> perseverance, {{he taught}} himself to draw and paint, and {{to such a}} great {{proficiency}} that belied his disability. He devoted himself mainly to line-drawing, and, {{with the help of}} an attendant to supply his materials, and a specially adapted desk, produced work of great beauty and thorough artistic finish in every detail. He was also able to write legibly using the same method.|$|R
5|$|Production at Site S ceased in late 1945 due to {{the cold}} weather. All work was then done at Salt Wells. The plant was {{completed}} in January 1946, and all equipment was installed and working by May 1946. Work was initially <b>dogged</b> <b>by</b> an unacceptably large number of defects {{in the form of}} cracks or imperfections in the explosive blocks. The core of the problem was that the techniques used at Los Alamos did not scale to a production site, so different methods were required. Special instrumentation was devised by Caltech's Ira Bowen to assess the quality of the explosive blocks.|$|E
5|$|The {{tour was}} <b>dogged</b> <b>by</b> {{financial}} controversy with the Australians accused by the British press of being {{interested only in}} money. The allegations were refuted by the Australian press but it later became clear, when an England team arrived in Australia the following winter, {{that there had been}} a financial dispute between Alexander and the English team manager James Lillywhite, resulting in the two teams at first boycotting each other. The dispute was never evident while Murdoch's team was in England as they completed all their scheduled fixtures, winning eighteen matches and losing seven with seven drawn.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the mid-1980s, Solidarity persevered as an {{exclusively}} underground organization. Its activists were <b>dogged</b> <b>by</b> the Security Service (SB), {{but managed}} to strike back: on May 1, 1982, a series of anti-government protests brought out thousands of participants—several dozen thousand in Kraków, Warsaw and Gdańsk. On May 3 more protests took place, during celebrations of the Constitution of May 3, 1791. On that day, communist secret services killed four demonstrators – three in Warsaw and one in Wrocław.|$|E

She refused to let him act again until he was 22. His most famous role is that of Caliber, a James Bond-like super-spy. Although <b>dogged</b> for years <b>by</b> rumors that he's gay (he is), he recently married supermodel Gina Beach.|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{provides}} a wide-ranging account of theatre in Birmingham, the UK’s second largest city. As a vital centre {{for the production}} of mass armaments and vehicles essential for the war effort, Birmingham was home to a rapidly expanding and socially diverse population. I show how theatres overcame wartime constraints to reflect that diversity with examples drawn from the popular entertainment provided by the city’s music halls, variety and melodrama theatres contrasted with the more decorous touring plays, musicals and spectacular home-grown pantomimes enjoyed at the prestigious Theatre Royal and Prince of Wales. The <b>dogged</b> attempts <b>by</b> the recently-established Birmingham Repertory Theatre to sustain an artistically and intellectually ambitious programme of new and classic drama also reveal a more complex response to the effects of war...|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{popularity}} of the Bannerman Clarke character among readers of Monster Island, and the implicit nature of his apparent death, several Wellington fans began to express hopes of his survival in the comments of the online serialization of it and its sequel, Monster Planet. This became a meme among some Wellington fans, and hope eventually became partly replaced <b>by</b> <b>dogged</b> insistence—in spite of Wellington's own indications that, yes, Clarke was indeed dead.|$|R
5|$|A month-long European trek began June 10 in Madrid, {{covering}} major festivals including Glastonbury and Roskilde. Matt Walker {{stood in}} for Vig {{for the rest}} of the summer. Garbage performed two shows in Nice and Lyon supporting Red Hot Chili Peppers, and a further two headlining French shows in Lille and Paris with Mercury Rev as support. The European leg ended at Espárrago Rock in Spain on July 12. Throughout the run, Manson was <b>dogged</b> <b>by</b> vocal problems, leading to the cancellation of a few festival appearances. After a six-week break, Garbage returned to the United Kingdom to perform their last European shows of the year – two intimate club gigs in London.|$|E
5|$|As the Browns recaptured {{a hint of}} past {{success in}} 1994, all was not well behind the scenes. Modell was in {{financial}} trouble. The origins of Modell's woes dated to 1973, when he worked out a deal to lease Cleveland Municipal Stadium from the city for a pittance: only enough to service the facility's debt and pay property taxes. Cleveland Browns Stadium Corporation, or Stadium Corp., a company Modell and a business associate created and owned, held the 25-year lease. Stadium Corp. then subleased the stadium to the Browns and the Cleveland Indians, and rented it out for concerts and other events. While the deal worked fine {{for the city and}} Modell early on, the owner was later <b>dogged</b> <b>by</b> excessive borrowing and lawsuits.|$|E
5|$|Brown's {{government}} introduced {{monetary and}} fiscal policies {{to help keep}} the banks afloat during the financial crisis in 2008, and as a result the United Kingdom's national debt increased dramatically. The Government took majority shareholdings in Northern Rock and Royal Bank of Scotland, both of which experienced financial difficulties. Large amounts of money were injected into several other banks, including newly merged HBOS-Lloyds TSB, which received £17billion. Domestic policies focusing on education, employment and health were introduced by the administration. The Labour Party was persuaded to give Gurkhas settlement rights in Britain by the campaign of actress Joanna Lumley and attracted criticism for its handling of the Scottish Government's release of Abdelbaset al-Megrahithe only person to have been convicted over the 1988 Lockerbie bombing. Brown was also <b>dogged</b> <b>by</b> allegations of bullying.|$|E
50|$|Opposing Fu Manchu in {{the early}} stories are Denis Nayland Smith and Dr. Petrie. They are in the Holmes and Watson tradition, with Dr. Petrie narrating the stories while Nayland Smith carries the fight, combating Fu Manchu more <b>by</b> <b>dogged</b> {{determination}} than intellectual brilliance (except in extremis). Nayland Smith and Fu Manchu share a grudging respect for one another, as each believes a man must keep his word even to an enemy.|$|R
6000|$|Sebastian's voice quavered and stammered for a moment. He tried just {{at first}} to {{continue}} and complete his sentence: [...] "And these organs," [...] he went on, aimlessly, [...] "these bull's-eyes that I spoke about, are so arranged--so arranged--I was speaking {{on the subject of}} crustaceans, I think--crustaceans so arranged--" [...] then he broke down utterly and turned sharply round to me. He did not look at Hilda--I think he did not dare; but he faced me with his head down and his long, thin neck protruded, eyeing me from under those overhanging, penthouse brows of his. [...] "You sneak!" [...] he cried, passionately. [...] "You sneak! You have <b>dogged</b> me <b>by</b> false pretences. You have lied to bring this about! You have come aboard under a false name--you and your accomplice!" ...|$|R
50|$|Among {{the leaders}} of Bihar {{belonging}} to the 20th century, whom {{the people of this}} state would long remember for the constructive and invaluable services rendered towards the progress of Bihar, Sahay would certainly find a prominent place. His life is a superb example of how a man can attain his cherished dream <b>by</b> <b>dogged</b> determination, systematic planning and hard labour. He dream of an independent India and an ever progressing Bihar for which he sacrificed his whole life.|$|R
5|$|Following the merger, the Jets {{fell into}} mediocrity; Namath was <b>dogged</b> <b>by</b> {{injuries}} {{through much of}} his later career. In 1981, New York qualified for {{the playoffs for the}} first time in the post-Namath era. They reached the AFC Championship Game in 1982; they were defeated on a rain-soaked Orange Bowl field by the Miami Dolphins. Beginning with the 1984 season, the team played in New Jersey's Giants Stadium. The team started the 1986 season with a 10–1 record, but the injury-plagued Jets lost their last five regular season games and relinquished a ten-point fourth quarter lead to lose in double overtime to the Cleveland Browns in the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|In 1816, {{the couple}} famously spent a summer with Lord Byron, John William Polidori, and Claire Clairmont near Geneva, Switzerland, where Mary {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} her novel Frankenstein. The Shelleys left Britain in 1818 for Italy, where their second and third children died before Mary Shelley {{gave birth to her}} last and only surviving child, Percy Florence Shelley. In 1822, her husband drowned when his sailing boat sank during a storm near Viareggio. A year later, Mary Shelley returned to England and from then on devoted herself to the upbringing of her son and a career as a professional author. The last decade of her life was <b>dogged</b> <b>by</b> illness, probably caused by the brain tumour that was to kill her at the age of 53.|$|E
5|$|On 9 September 1899, Gan {{died at the}} age of 55 in {{his house}} at No. 87 Amoy Street. His total assets were worth an {{estimated}} S$550,000. He was buried at Leng Kee Sua somewhere on the hill by the side where Leng Kee Road runs today. Due to redevelopment of the area, his body was disinterred and reburied in a family grave at Bukit Brown Cemetery. After the death of his father, Gan Tiang Tok continued the family business for three years, though by the turn of century it was no longer so lucrative. Gan Tiang Tok was <b>dogged</b> <b>by</b> ill health from 1903 until his death in 1927 at the age of 68.|$|E
5000|$|After {{graduating from}} Dartmouth, {{he was hired}} {{to serve as the}} head {{football}} coach at the University of California, Berkeley for the 1905 college football season. He led the team to a record of 4-1-2 in his only year as the coach. An account written by a student described Knibbs' coaching style as follows:"All hopes and fears of our University are now bound up in the coming Stanford-California football game. We are lying very low and keeping very quiet, as the policy of our Eastern coach, Knibbs, of Dartmouth, is most conservative. Most of the practising is secret, and the field is closed to all save the squad except two afternoons of each week. The work his sic year has been tackled in a serious, <b>dogged</b> style <b>by</b> all those out; this alone has won much respect for our new coach." ...|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, {{although}} the Austrians had spread their forces along their border, they had concentrated their guns at favourable positions around the bridges over the Po. When on 8 April, Murat finally launched his {{first attempt to}} cross the bridge at Occhiobello, a <b>dogged</b> defensive action <b>by</b> Mohr's outnumbered infantry combined with a devastating artillery barrage, threw the Neapolitan attack back in disarray. After successive charges, including one by an entire dragoon regiment, were repulsed by the Austrians, the Neapolitan morale slowly disintegrated and the assault petered out.|$|R
5|$|Braille {{had always}} been a sickly child, and his {{condition}} worsened in adulthood. A persistent respiratory illness, long believed to be tuberculosis, <b>dogged</b> him, and <b>by</b> the age of forty, he was forced to relinquish his position as a teacher. Despite the lack of a cure at the time, Braille lived with the illness for 16 years. When his condition reached mortal danger, he was admitted to the infirmary at the Royal Institution, where he died in 1852, two days after he had reached the age of forty-three.|$|R
5|$|The Renaissance {{began in}} times of {{religious}} turmoil. The late Middle Ages {{was a period of}} political intrigue surrounding the Papacy, culminating in the Western Schism, in which three men simultaneously claimed to be true Bishop of Rome. While the schism was resolved by the Council of Constance (1414), a resulting reform movement known as Conciliarism sought to limit the power of the pope. Although the papacy eventually emerged supreme in ecclesiastical matters by the Fifth Council of the Lateran (1511), it was <b>dogged</b> <b>by</b> continued accusations of corruption, most famously in the person of Pope Alexander VI, who was accused variously of simony, nepotism and fathering four children (most of whom were married off, presumably for the consolidation of power) while a cardinal.|$|E
5|$|According to Crowley, Reuss {{had named}} him {{head of the}} O.T.O. upon his death, but this was {{challenged}} by {{a leader of the}} German O.T.O., Heinrich Tränker. Tränker called the Hohenleuben Conference in Thuringia, Germany, which Crowley attended. There, prominent members like Karl Germer and Martha Küntzel championed Crowley's leadership, but other key figures like Albin Grau, Oskar Hopfer, and Henri Birven backed Tränker by opposing it, resulting in a split in the O.T.O. Moving to Paris, where he broke with Olsen in 1926, Crowley went through a large number of lovers over the following years, with whom he experimented in sex magic. Throughout, he was <b>dogged</b> <b>by</b> poor health, largely caused by his heroin and cocaine addictions. In 1928, Crowley was introduced to young Englishman Israel Regardie, who embraced Thelema and became Crowley's secretary for the next three years. That year, Crowley also met Gerald Yorke, who began organising Crowley's finances but never became a Thelemite. He also befriended Thomas Driberg; Driberg did not accept Thelema either. It was here that Crowley also published one of his most significant works, Magick in Theory and Practice, which received little attention at the time.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{continued}} to be <b>dogged</b> <b>by</b> controversy about not holding {{a referendum on the}} EU Treaty of Lisbon. On the morning of 13 December 2007, Foreign Secretary David Miliband stood in for Brown at the official signing ceremony in Lisbon of the EU Reform Treaty, which was attended by all other European heads of government. At the time, Brown was appearing before the Liaison Committee; he went to Portugal to sign the treaty that afternoon. Brown was criticised by opponents {{on both sides of the}} House and in the press. His critics said that neither Brown nor Labour had a mandate to ratify the treaty without public consent. Conservative leader David Cameron pointed to Labour's 2005 manifesto, which had pledged to give the British public a referendum on the original EU Constitution. Brown said the Treaty differed on significant points from the Constitution and was no longer a constitution but an ordinary treaty, and as such did not require a referendum. He also responded with plans for a lengthy debate on the topic and stated that he believed the document to be too complex to be decided by referendum.|$|E
40|$|The {{establishment}} {{of higher education}} institutions in Australia has normally been an initiative of government. However, in case of the Queensland Conservatorium of Music, the long and tortuous journey towards its opening in 1957 was characterised <b>by</b> the <b>dogged</b> persistence <b>by</b> numerous individuals, who today might be termed lobbyists. Without their collective efforts, the institution's arrival might have delayed even longer than the half-century which elapsed from the time when Queensland having a premier music school was first mooted. Themes of cultural deprivation that amounted to a 'state's rights' catchcry figure strongly, and also became a socio-political issue as families sent their musically talented children to conservatoria in Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney or overseas. The succession of agitators for a Queensland conservatorium provides an interesting snapshot of the state's musical community during the early 20 th century. This article discusses the 'power of persistence' {{by a number of}} musical advocates, some of them well-known community leaders, and others whose contributions have faded from public memory, but were no less significant.

"Your {{favourite}} Awkward Davies can {{be positively}} <b>dogged,</b> if crossed <b>by</b> a new hand: {{but in a}} boarding-party, or storming a shore-position, he is worth his weight in gold, heavy though he is.

What Stephen calls his berserker rage fairly clears the enemy's decks before him. He also howls. But he has other sides: not only is he very useful when you must sway up the mast short-handed, but in sudden emergencies too." [...] (p. 98-99).|$|R
