25|$|<b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tabernacle {{marked a}} ritual boundary: an Israelite healed of tzaraath would be {{presented}} by the priest who had confirmed his healing 'at <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tabernacle <b>of</b> Meeting', and a woman healed of prolonged menstruation would present her offering (two turtledoves or two young pigeons) to the priest 'at <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tabernacle <b>of</b> Meeting'.

5|$|After the eulogies, {{the three}} {{speakers}} each laid a wreath at the casket, and the Senate Chaplain, the Reverend Barry Black, gave the benediction. Cheney escorted Nancy Reagan to the casket, where {{she said her}} goodbyes. The dignitaries in the room paid their respects during the next half-hour. In a rare instance, the <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Capitol were then opened to the public, who stood in lines stretching many blocks to view the casket.|$|E

5|$|The {{interior}} of the machine was very complicated and designed to mislead those who observed it. When opened on the left, the front <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cabinet exposed a number of gears and cogs similar to clockwork. The section was designed so that if the back <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cabinet were open {{at the same time}} one could see through the machine. The other side of the cabinet did not house machinery; instead it contained a red cushion and some removable parts, as well as brass structures. This area was also designed to provide a clear line of vision through the machine. Underneath the robes of the Ottoman model, two other doors were hidden. These also exposed clockwork machinery and provided a similarly unobstructed view through the machine. The design allowed the presenter of the machine to open every available door to the public, to maintain the illusion.|$|E
5|$|The wooden <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cathedral {{were carved}} in Tiflis in 1889. The {{paintings}} were {{moved out of}} the cathedral by the order of Catholicos Mkrtich Khrimian in 1891 and are now kept in various museums in Armenia, including the National Gallery of Armenia. The frescoes inside the cathedral were restored by Lydia Durnovo in 1956 and in 1981–82 under the directorship of Vardges Baghdasaryan.|$|E
5|$|After thirty-four {{hours of}} lying in state, the <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Capitol were {{closed to the}} public and Nancy Reagan was escorted in, where she had a moment alone with the casket. A {{military}} honor guard entered and carried it down the west steps of the Capitol to a 21-gun salute where Nancy, holding her hand over her heart, met it. After it was placed in a hearse, the motorcade departed on the five-mile-trip (8km) to the Washington National Cathedral, where the state funeral service was to be held; crowds lined the route of the cortege as the hearse made its way.|$|E

Somali employees of the embassy—known as foreign service nationals (FSNs)—could not be evacuated. Local banks had been closed {{for some time and}} the embassy was unable to pay the FSNs. The Ambassador left the FSNs with keys to the commissary and warehouse on the embassy compound and they were permitted to take anything they needed.|$|E
5|$|Concerts {{performed}} by the Grant Park Orchestra and directed by Kalmar {{were part of a}} June 19, 2009, citywide Burnham Plan centennial celebration that included the unveiling of the Burnham Pavilion elsewhere in the park. The concert featured the world premiere of Michael Torke's work for symphony and chorus entitled Plans, paired with Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 3. Also, the pavilion serves as host to the annual Chicago Winter Dance Festival. During the festival there is a month of free dance instructions behind the glass <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pavilion stage and free skating instruction at the McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink.|$|E
5|$|Considering that he {{majored in}} {{political}} science and economics, Kanō's family thought that after graduating from university, he would pursue a career in some government ministry. Indeed, through influential friends of his father's, he was initially offered a position with the Ministry of Finance. However, his love for teaching led him instead to accept a position teaching at Gakushuin. The students of Japan's elite attended Gakushuin and were of higher social positions than their teachers. The students were allowed to ride in rickshaws (jinrikisha) right to the <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> classes, whereas teachers were forbidden. The teachers often felt compelled to visit the homes of these students whenever summoned to give instruction or advice. In effect, the teachers were treated as servants.|$|E

5|$|Reagan's casket, a Marsellus Masterpiece model, {{was carried}} by a {{military}} honor guard representing all branches of the United States Armed Forces into {{the lobby of the}} library to lie in repose. There, a brief family service was conducted by the Reverend Dr. Michael H. Wenning, former pastor of Bel Air Church, where Reagan worshipped. When the prayer service concluded, Nancy Reagan and her family approached the casket, where Nancy laid her head on it. After the family left, the <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> presidential library opened, and the public began filing in at a rate of 2,000 an hour throughout the night. In all, about 108,000 people visited the presidential library to see the casket.|$|E
5|$|The 757-200M, a {{convertible}} version {{capable of carrying}} cargo and passengers on its main deck, entered service with Royal Nepal Airlines in 1988. Also known as the 757-200 Combi, the type retains the passenger windows and cabin <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 757-200, while adding a forward port-side cargo door {{in the manner of}} the 757-200PF. Kathmandu-based Royal Nepal Airlines, later renamed Nepal Airlines, included the convertible model as part of an order for two 757s in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Those {{tending the}} {{furnaces}} were {{unaware that the}} heat from the fires had melted the copper lining of the flues and started a chimney fire. With the <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> furnaces open, more oxygen was drawn into the furnaces, which ensured the fire burned more fiercely, and the flames driven further up the flues than they should have been. The flues had been weakened over time by having footholds cut in them by the child chimney sweeps. Although these footholds would have been repaired as the child exited on finishing the cleaning, the fabric of the chimney was still weakened by the action. In October 1834 the chimneys had not yet had their annual sweep, and a considerable amount of clinker had built up inside the flues.|$|E

The stall plates, however, are not removed; rather, they remain {{permanently}} affixed {{to the back of the}} stall, so that the stalls of the chapel are festooned with a colourful record of the Order's Knights (and now Ladies) since 1911. The entryway just outside the <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chapel has the names of the Order's Knights from before 1911 inscribed into the walls giving a complete record of the members of the order.|$|E
5|$|Armed looters were {{observed}} entering the embassy compound {{as the final}} wave departed. The <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chancery—the main building of the embassy—were reportedly blown open by RPGs within two hours of the embassy's evacuation. Somali employees of the embassy—known as foreign service nationals (FSNs)—could not be evacuated. Ambassador Bishop tried unsuccessfully to have these employees airlifted to safer parts of Somalia. Many of the FSNs had sought refuge in the embassy {{with their families and}} about 30 were hired as guards and protected the embassy throughout the ordeal. Local banks had been closed for some time and the embassy was unable to pay the FSNs. The Ambassador left the FSNs with keys to the commissary and warehouse on the embassy compound and they were permitted to take anything they needed.|$|E
5|$|At 20:30 {{the parents}} left 5A to dine {{with their friends}} in the Ocean Club's open-air tapas {{restaurant}}, located {{on the other side}} of the pool. 5A lay about 55 metres (160ft) from the restaurant as the crow flies, but getting to the restaurant involved walking along a public street to reach the <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ocean Club resort, then walking through the resort to the other side of the pool, a distance of about 82 metres (295ft). The top of the apartment was visible from the tapas restaurant, but not the doors. The patio doors could be locked only from the inside, so the McCanns left them closed but unlocked, with the curtains drawn, so they could let themselves in that way when checking on the children. There was a child-safety gate at the top of the steps from the patio and a low gate at the bottom, which led to the street.|$|E
