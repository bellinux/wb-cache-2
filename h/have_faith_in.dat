5|$|In Reformed theology, baptism is {{a sacrament}} {{signifying}} the baptized person's union with Christ, or {{becoming part of}} Christ and being treated {{as if they had}} done everything Christ had. Sacraments, along with preaching of God's word, are means of grace through which God offers Christ to people. Sacraments are believed to have their effect through the Holy Spirit, but these effects are only believed to be beneficial to those who <b>have</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> Christ.|$|E
5|$|The chapter {{asserts that}} the king should be truthful, avoid anger, be virtuous and lead by example. The king, ministers and {{citizens}} should, states the Manasollasa's first sub-book, refrain from injury to others, practice self-restraint and generosity, <b>have</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> gods, feed and support the poor and helpless, and be friendly. The king, according to the text, should honour his ancestors and all guests.|$|E
5|$|The main {{position}} on Spirit baptism among the Reformed churches, dispensationalists, and many Baptists {{is that the}} baptism with the Holy Spirit occurs simultaneously with regeneration, when those who <b>have</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> Jesus Christ receive the Holy Spirit and are incorporated {{into the body of}} Christ.|$|E

5|$|In Reformed theology, baptism is {{the sacrament}} of {{initiation}} into the visible church, or body of people who publicly claim faith in Christ. Baptism also signifies regeneration and remission of sin. Reformed Christians believe that the children of those who express faith in Christ should be baptized. Because baptism {{is believed to be}} beneficial only to those who <b>have</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> Christ, infants are baptized {{on the basis of the}} promise of faith which will come to fruition later in life.|$|E
5|$|Kyle becomes annoyed, {{responding}} {{that the}} economy is not actually angry with them, and that they should be out spending money, and continues to preach {{that the economy}} only exists as a mental construct, and that people have lost their faith in it because of the recession. He then convinces his friends that if they want the economy to be strong, they must <b>have</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> it. Upon hearing of this heresy, Randy and his makeshift economic council decide that they must kill Kyle. Cartman, in his desire to obtain a copy of , says that he will deliver Kyle to Randy and his friends in exchange for the game.|$|E
5|$|Many of Model's fellow {{officers}} considered him a Nazi. He frequently harangued his troops to <b>have</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> the Führer and uphold {{the virtues of}} National Socialism. He accepted the offer of SS-Gruppenführer Hermann Fegelein to appoint a Waffen-SS officer as his adjutant at Army Group North in 1944, after the Heerespersonalamt had refused him an adjutant, and filled the Nationalsozialistischer Führungsoffizier (NSFO, essentially a Nazi political commissar) post at Army Group B that had been vacant before his arrival. His habit of parroting the Führer's orders caused him {{to be viewed as}} a sycophant, even if he often undermined or ignored those orders in practice.|$|E

And, if they <b>had</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> any other things or persons beside God, they merely shared in the general popular ignorance and {{mistakes}} of their own age; and we must not judge those who, born in an age of darkness, were struggling earnestly toward the light, as we judge those who, born in an age of scientific light, are retiring of their own will back into the darkness.|$|R
5|$|Prosperity {{theology}} (sometimes {{referred to}} as the prosperity gospel, the health and wealth gospel, or the gospel of success) is a religious belief among some Christians, who hold that financial blessing and physical well-being are always the will of God for them, and that faith, positive speech, and donations to religious causes will increase one's material wealth. Prosperity theology views the Bible as a contract between God and humans: if humans <b>have</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> God, he will deliver security and prosperity.|$|E

The court, however, refused to pass any direction {{on the grounds that the}} issue was related to the aspect of law and order, and it thus directed the petitioners to <b>have</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> the Bombay High Court and seek further hearing there.|$|E
5|$|In the 1913 session, Coolidge enjoyed renowned {{success in}} arduously {{navigating}} to passage the Western Trolley Act which connected Northampton {{with a dozen}} similar industrial communities in western Massachusetts. Coolidge intended to retire after his second term as was the custom, but when the President of the State Senate, Levi H. Greenwood, considered running for Lieutenant Governor, Coolidge decided to run again for the Senate {{in the hopes of}} being elected as its presiding officer. Although Greenwood later decided to run for reelection to the Senate, he was defeated primarily due to his opposition to women's suffrage; Coolidge was in favor of the women's vote, won his own re-election and with Crane's help, assumed the presidency of a closely divided Senate. After his election in January 1914, Coolidge delivered a published and frequently quoted speech entitled <b>Have</b> <b>Faith</b> <b>in</b> Massachusetts, which summarized his philosophy of government.|$|E

5|$|At the 1920 Republican National Convention, most of {{the delegates}} were {{selected}} by state party conventions, not primaries. As such, the field was divided among many local favorites. Coolidge was one such candidate, and while he placed as high as sixth in the voting, the powerful party bosses running the convention, primarily the party's U.S. Senators, never considered him seriously. After ten ballots, the bosses and then the delegates settled on Senator Warren G. Harding of Ohio as their nominee for president. When {{the time came to}} select a vice presidential nominee, the bosses also made and announced their decision on whom they wanted – Sen. Irvine Lenroot of Wisconsin – and then prematurely departed after his name was put forth, relying on the rank and file to confirm their decision. A delegate from Oregon, Wallace McCamant, having read <b>Have</b> <b>Faith</b> <b>in</b> Massachusetts, proposed Coolidge for vice president instead. The suggestion caught on quickly with the masses starving for an act of independence from the absent bosses, and Coolidge was unexpectedly nominated.|$|E

25|$|Reformed theologians, {{along with}} other Protestants, believe {{salvation}} from punishment for sin is {{to be given to}} all those who <b>have</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> Christ.

25|$|German {{reaction}} to the French Revolution was mixed at first. German intellectuals celebrated the outbreak, hoping to see the triumph of Reason and The Enlightenment. The royal courts in Vienna and Berlin denounced {{the overthrow of the}} king and the threatened spread of notions of liberty, equality, and fraternity. By 1793, the execution of the French king and the onset of the Terror disillusioned the Bildungsbürgertum (educated middle classes). Reformers said the solution was to <b>have</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> the ability of Germans to reform their laws and institutions in peaceful fashion.|$|E
25|$|Ford's {{first wife}} was actress and dancer Eleanor Powell (1943–1959), {{with whom he}} had his only child, actor Peter Ford (born 1945). The couple {{appeared}} together on screen just once, in a short film produced in the 1950s entitled <b>Have</b> <b>Faith</b> <b>in</b> Our Children. When they married, Powell was more famous than Ford. Ford dated Christiane Schmidtmer during the mid-1960s, but subsequently married actress Kathryn Hays (1966–1969); Cynthia Hayward (1977–1984), and Jeanne Baus (1993–1994). All four marriages ended in divorce. Ford was not on good terms with his ex-wives, except for Cynthia Hayward, with whom he remained close until his death. He also had a long-term relationship with actress Hope Lange in the early 1960s, although they never married.|$|E

25|$|President Narayanan in {{his speeches}} {{consistently}} sought {{to remind the}} nation of its duties and obligations towards the Dalits and Adivasis, the minorities, and the poor and downtrodden. He called the nation's attention to various recalcitrant social ills and evils, such as atrocities against women and children, caste discrimination and the ingrained attitudes it nurtured, abuse {{of the environment and}} public utilities, corruption and lack of accountability in the delivery of public services, religious fundamentalism, advertisement-driven consumerism, and flouting of human rights, and lamented the absence of public concern, political debate, and civic action to address them. Drawing from the experiences of his own home state Kerala, he pointed out that education was at the root of human and economic development. He hoped that the establishment would not fear the awakening of the masses through education, and spoke of the need to <b>have</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> the people.|$|E
25|$|The early French {{withdrawal}} has {{led some}} to speculate that Kapisa will become a security vacuum just outside Kabul. This would be no small matter: the “ring of steel” that surrounds Afghanistan’s capital has been broken {{so many times that}} few <b>have</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> the capital’s safety anymore. Several of those early attacks, before the influx of French troops, were planned and supported out of the Tagab Valley. The French presence there had reduced the ability of militants in Kapisa to launch attacks into Kabul. When the French leave, the U.S. would not have the troops to fill in the gap, leaving a big opportunity for militants north of Kabul to strike back.Most of the province population believe that the long-term presence of foreign forces in Afghanistan can only serve to perpetuate the war cycle and the departure of the French will weaken the Taliban stance. Over 60 French soldiers have been killed in Kapisa since 2008, with hundreds more injured severely. With the help of Afghan National Army, French forces conducted operations to repel the insurgents and Afghan forces were able to gain a foothold in Kapisa valleys. They oversaw the formation of the 3rd Brigade of the 201st Afghan corps that is now deployed in Kapisa and of the Afghan police who now are solely responsible for providing the province’s security.|$|E
25|$|Merida and Belle later stumble upon a witch's home, {{where they}} sneak inside {{to use a}} {{cauldron}} to do a locator spell, which conjures up a futuristic vision of a Southern moor where three men are vying for Merida's hand in marriage, followed by her three brothers brought in by their captors who remove the bags off their heads. Unfortunately, the United Clans also plan to kills Merida's brothers and take DunBroch from Merida. Belle tells Merida its time to change fate, so Belle reads the scroll. As Belle watches Merida practices her archery skills, she's just finished up creating the potion, which will turn Merida into a bear so she can save her brothers. Belle is skeptical about using the spell to change fate, but Merida says otherwise. As they reach the United Clans, Merida threatens {{to take them out}} but as she drinks the potion, Belle told her it wasn't the actual potion, then tells Merida that she should <b>have</b> <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> her own fate without magic. When the United Clans' archers aim their arrows at her brothers, Merida showed them who was in charge by aiming her arrows at the targets and takes them out. The clans then bow down to Merida to acknowledge her as the Queen of DunBroch. With that out of the way, Merida let Belle return to Camelot to join the others.|$|E
