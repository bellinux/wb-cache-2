60|$|Suddenly {{a strange}} rumble reached their ears, a rumble that made both Wumble and Slim Jim turn pale {{and look at}} each other with faces full of fear. The rumble rose and <b>fell,</b> <b>shaking</b> the earth beneath them, and {{mingling}} with a grinding and crashing and ripping that seemed to strike each one to the very heart.|$|R
5000|$|Chachigadeva {{appears to}} have {{maintain}} a sovereign status and the territory inherited from his father. The Sundha Hill inscription poetically describes him as [...] "destroying the roaring Gurjara lord Virama, hating the enemy Salya, taking exquisite delight in <b>felling</b> the <b>shaking</b> (or leaping) Pātaka, depriving of his colour Sanga, and a thunderbolt to the mountain - the furious Nahara".|$|R

5000|$|There are {{two main}} natural forces {{responsible}} for causing defects in timber: abnormal growth and rupture of tissues. Rupture of tissue includes cracks or splits in the wood called [...] "shakes". [...] "Ring shake", [...] "wind shake", or [...] "ring failure" [...] is when the wood grain separates around the growth rings either while standing or during <b>felling.</b> <b>Shakes</b> may reduce {{the strength of a}} timber and the appearance thus reduce lumber grade and may capture moisture, promoting decay. Eastern hemlock is known for having ring shake. A [...] "check" [...] is a crack {{on the surface of the}} wood caused by the outside of a timber shrinking as it seasons. Checks may extend to the pith and follow the grain. Like shakes, checks can hold water promoting rot. A [...] "split" [...] goes all the way through a timber. Checks and splits occur more frequently at the ends of lumber because of the more rapid drying in these locations.|$|R
6000|$|At this Captain Manly {{clapped his}} hand upon our hero's {{shoulder}} and <b>fell</b> to <b>shaking</b> {{him so that}} he could hardly stand, crying out to him the while to be silent. Says he: [...] "How do you dare, an officer of this ship, to quarrel with a passenger of mine! Go straight to your cabin, and stay there till I give you leave to come out again." ...|$|R
60|$|Nothing {{more was}} said. They ate their last biscuit. Jones packed the calves {{away in the}} tepee, {{and turned to the}} dogs. All day they had worried him; {{something}} was amiss with them, and even as he went among them a fierce fight broke out. Jones saw it was unusual, for the attacked dogs showed craven fear, and the attacking ones a howling, savage intensity that surprised him. Then one of the vicious brutes rolled his eyes, frothed at the mouth, shuddered and leaped in his harness, vented a hoarse howl and <b>fell</b> back <b>shaking</b> and retching.|$|R
6000|$|... "His hoary beard {{in silver}} rolled, [...] He seemed some seventy winters old; [...] A palmer's amice wrapped, him round, [...] With a wrought Spanish baldric bound, [...] Like a pilgrim {{from beyond the}} sea: [...] His left hand held his book of might; [...] A silver cross was in his right; [...] The lamp was placed beside his knee: [...] High and majestic was his look, [...] At which, the <b>fellest</b> fiends had <b>shook,</b> [...] And all unruffled, was his face: [...] They trusted his soul had gotten grace." ...|$|R
60|$|With {{a little}} crash the pistol <b>fell</b> from her <b>shaking</b> fingers. She stood looking down upon him with dilated eyes. Her faculties seemed {{for a moment}} numbed. She could not realize what she saw. Surely it was a dream. A moment before {{he had been a}} strong man, she had been in his power, a poor {{helpless}} thing. Now he lay there, a doubled-up mass, with ugly distorted features, and a dark wet stain dripping slowly on to the carpet. It could not be she who had done this. She had never let off a pistol in her life. Yet the smoke was curling upwards in a faint innocent-looking cloud to the ceiling. The smell of gunpowder was strong in the room.|$|R
50|$|A {{long time}} ago, the Dragon Kings of the East Sea and West Sea fought {{in a bloody}} war to gain control over the sea. The East Sea was losing the war steadily. To win the war, the Dragon King of the East Sea ordered his son, Choribdongi, to get Wang Janggun (King General), a giant born {{as the son of}} Cheonhwang Jeseok, one of the minor deities of the sky, and Jihwang Jeseok, one of the minor earth goddesses. Wang Janggun's height was three meters, and his arms and legs were of iron. His face was red, and flame sprouted his eyes. When Choribdongi met Wang Janggun, Wang Janggun was {{chopping}} down an impossibly thick tree. When the tree <b>fell,</b> the sound <b>shook</b> the entire earth.|$|R
6000|$|While this {{dialogue}} passed, {{the soldiers had}} already bound and secured their prisoner. Milnwood returned at this instant, and, alarmed at the preparations he beheld, hastened to proffer to Bothwell, though with many a grievous groan, the purse of gold {{which he had been}} obliged to rummage out as ransom for his nephew. The trooper took the purse with an air of indifference, weighed it in his hand, chucked it up into the air, and caught it as it <b>fell,</b> then <b>shook</b> his head, and said, [...] "There's many a merry night in this nest of yellow boys, but d--n me if I dare venture for them--that old woman has spoken too loud, and before all the men too.--Hark ye, old gentleman," [...] to Milnwood, [...] "I must take your nephew to head-quarters, so I cannot, in conscience, keep more than is my due as civility-money;" [...] then opening the purse, he gave a gold piece to each of the soldiers, and took three to himself. [...] "Now," [...] said he, [...] "you have the comfort to know that your kinsman, young Captain Popinjay, will be carefully looked after and civilly used; {{and the rest of the}} money I return to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mademoiselle {{sank into}} her chair {{opposite}} to them, breathless and hot. She accepted {{a glass of}} wine and begged for a cigarette. She whispered in Macheson's ear that the big man was a forger, an affair of the year before last. He was safe away from Paris, but the price of his liberty was more than he could pay. The man there to the left with the lady in pink, no! not the Vicomte, the one beyond, he was tried for murder a month ago. There was a witness missing--the case <b>fell</b> through, but--mademoiselle <b>shook</b> her shoulders significantly. The lady with fair hair and dark eyes, Macheson asked, was she English? But certainly, mademoiselle assured him. She was the divorced wife of an English nobleman. [...] "To-night she is alone," [...] mademoiselle added, [...] "but it is not often! Ah, monsieur!" ...|$|R
25|$|South of {{the belt}} of timber lay Oberson's Field, where Greusel had time to form his brigade and nine cannon on the forest edge on the south side. Sul Ross alertly led the 6th Texas Cavalry in pursuit of Bussey's force. But when Ross rode into the field, his men were fired on and quickly <b>fell</b> back. Greusel <b>shook</b> out two {{companies}} of skirmishers from the 36th Illinois and posted them along the southern edge {{of the belt}} of timber between Oberson's and Foster's fields. The Federal gunners began lobbing shells over the belt of timber. Though the howitzers were fired blindly, their first shell bursts panicked the Cherokees, who rapidly retreated and could not be rallied. Meanwhile, McCulloch had formed Louis Hébert's 4,000-man infantry brigade across a wide front and sent them south. Hébert took control of the four regiments east of the north-south Leetown Road, while McCulloch took charge of the four regiments west of the road.|$|R

60|$|In his pride--for he {{was proud}} yet--he let the world go from him freely. As it <b>fell</b> away, he <b>shook</b> it off. Whether he {{imagined}} its face as expressing pity for him, or indifference to him, he shunned it alike. It {{was in the same}} degree to be avoided, in either aspect. He had no idea of any one companion in his misery, but the one he had driven away. What he would have said to her, or what consolation submitted to receive from her, he never pictured to himself. But he always knew she would have been true to him, if he had suffered her. He always knew she would have loved him better now, than at any other time; he was as certain that it was in her nature, as he was that there was a sky above him; and he sat thinking so, in his loneliness, from hour to hour. Day after day uttered this speech; night after night showed him this knowledge.|$|R

40|$|Because {{a history}} of shaking is often lacking in the {{so-called}} “shaken baby syndrome,” diagnosis is usually based on a constellation of clinical and radiographic findings. Forty-eight cases of infants and young children with this diagnosis seen between 1978 and 1985 at the Children 2 ̆ 7 s Hospital of Philadelphia were reviewed. All patients had a presenting history thought to be suspicious for child abuse, and either retinal hemorrhages with subdural or subarachnoid hemorrhages or a computerized tomography scan showing subdural or subarachnoid hemorrhages with interhemispheric blood. The physical examination and presence of associated trauma were analyzed; autopsy findings for the 13 fatalities were reviewed. All fatal cases had signs of blunt impact to the head, although {{in more than half}} of them these findings were noted only at autopsy. All deaths were associated with uncontrollably increased intracranial pressure. Models of 1 -month-old infants with various neck and skull parameters were instrumented with accelerometers and shaken and impacted against padded or unpadded surfaces. Angular accelerations for shakes were smaller than those for impacts by a factor of 50. All <b>shakes</b> <b>fell</b> below injury thresholds established for subhuman primates scaled for the same brain mass, while impacts spanned concussion, subdural hematoma, and diffuse axonal injury ranges. It was concluded that severe head injuries commonly diagnosed as shaking injuries require impact to occur and that shaking alone in an otherwise normal baby is unlikely to cause the shaken baby syndrome...|$|R
60|$|But now came on two adventures, both tragical and comical. First, {{our guide}} was {{encountered}} by three wolves and a bear, who set upon {{him and his}} horse, and wounded him in three places; upon which my man, riding up to his assistance, shot one of them dead upon the spot, which made the others retire into the woods. But the pleasantest adventure was, to behold my man attack the bear. 'Tis such a creature, that if you let him alone, he will never meddle with you, and this my man very well knew, and so begging leave of me in broken English, he told us, he would make good laugh. 'Why, you silly fool,' said I, 'he'll eat you up at a mouthful.' Eatee me up, replied he, by way of scorn, me not only eatee him, but make much good laugh. Upon which, pulling off his boots, he claps on his pumps, and running after the monstrous beast, he called out, {{that he wanted to}} discourse with him, and then throwing stones on purpose to incense him, the beast turns about in fury, and, with prodigious strides, shuffles after him. But though he was not swift enough to keep up pace with Friday, who made up to us as it were for help; yet being angry, 'You dog,' said I, 'immediately take horse, and let us shoot the creature.' But he cried, Dear master, no shoot, me make you laugh much. And so he turned about, making signs to follow, while the bear ran after, till coming to a great oak, he ascended in a minute, leaving his gun, at the bottom of it. Nor did the bear make any difficulty of it, but ascended like a cat, though his weight was very great. You must consider I was not a little amazed at the folly of my man, as not perceiving any thing to occasion our laughter, till such time as we rode up nearer, and beheld the bear mounted upon the oak, on the beginning of the same branch, to which Friday clung at the farther end, where the bear durst not come. Hereupon Friday cried out, Now master, me make much laugh, me make bear dance. Upon which he <b>fell</b> a <b>shaking</b> the bough, which made the creature look behind him, to see how he could retreat. Then as if the bear had understood his stammering English, Why you no come farther, Mr. Bear said he, pray, Mr. Bear come farther; and then indeed we all burst into a laughter; especially when we perceived Friday drop like a squirrel upon the ground, leaving the beast {{to make the best of}} his way down the tree. And now thinking it the most convenient time to shoot the creature, Friday cried out, O dear master, no shoot, me shoot by and by; when taking up the gun, me no shoot yet, said he me make one more much laugh. And accordingly he was as good as his word; for the creature descending backwards from the tree very leisurely, before he could lay one foot on the ground, Friday shot him through the ear, stone dead; and looking to see whether we were pleased, he burst out into a hearty laughter, saying, So we kill de bear in my country, not with the gun, but with much long arrows. Thus ended our diversion, to our great satisfaction; especially in a place where the terrible howlings struck us with a continual terror. But the snows now growing very deep, particularly on the mountains, the ravenous creatures were then obliged to seek for sustenance in the villages, were coming by surprise on the country people, killed several of them, besides a great number of their sheep and horses.|$|R
