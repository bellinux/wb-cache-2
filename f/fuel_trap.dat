40|$|Particle image {{velocimetry}} {{is applied}} to measure the vertical (r-z) plane flow structures in a light-duty direct-injection diesel engine with a realistic piston geometry. The measurements are corrected for optical distortions due to the curved piston bowl walls and the cylindrical liner. Mean flow fields are presented and contrasted for operation both with and without fuel injection and combustion. For operation with combustion, the two-dimensional divergence of the measured mean velocity fields is employed as a qualitative indicator of the locations of mean heat release. In agreement with numerical simulations, dual-vortex, vertical plane mean flow structures that may enhance mixing rates are formed approximately mid-way through the combustion event. Late in the cycle a toroidal vortex forms outside the bowl mouth.

40|$|International audienceFusion <b>fuel</b> {{retention}} (<b>trapping)</b> {{and release}} (desorption) from plasma-facing components are critical issues for ITER and for any future industrial demonstration reactors such as DEMO. Therefore, understanding the fundamental mechanisms behind {{the retention of}} hydrogen isotopes in first wall and divertor materials is necessary. We developed an approach that couples dedicated experimental studies with modelling at all relevant scales, from microscopic elementary steps to macroscopic observables, {{in order to build}} a reliable and predictive fusion reactor wall model. This integrated approach is applied to the ITER divertor material (tungsten), and advances {{in the development of the}} wall model are presented. An experimental dataset, including focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy, isothermal desorption, temperature programmed desorption, nuclear reaction analysis and Auger electron spectroscopy, is exploited to initialize a macroscopic rate equation wall model. This model includes all elementary steps of modelled experiments: implantation of fusion fuel, fuel diffusion in the bulk or towards the surface, <b>fuel</b> <b>trapping</b> on defects and release of <b>trapped</b> <b>fuel</b> during a thermal excursion of materials. We were able to show that a single-trap-type single-detrapping-energy model is not able to reproduce an extended parameter space study of a polycrystalline sample exhibiting a single desorption peak. It is therefore justified to use density functional theory to guide the initialization of a more complex model. This new model still contains a single type of trap, but includes the density functional theory findings that the detrapping energy varies as a function of the number of hydrogen isotopes bound to the trap. A better agreement of the model with experimental results is obtained when grain boundary defects are included, as is consistent with the polycrystalline nature of the studied sample. Refinement of this grain boundary model is discussed as well as the inclusion in the model of a thin defective oxide layer following the experimental observation of the presence of an oxygen layer on the surface even after annealing to 1300 [*]K...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} the prompt and {{cost-effective}} intervention and remediation of tanker wrecks dealing with eventual leaks and recovering the <b>fuel</b> <b>trapped</b> in their tanks, even at considerable depths, is described. The method is of general applicability {{as long as}} the trapped pollutant does not dissolve and is of lower density than sea water. It relies on gravity to channel the flow of spilt fuel to-wards the surface. Instead of channeling the flow direct-ly to the surface, the fuel-water mix is directed to a buffer reservoir/separator some 30 - 50 m below the sea surface {{so as not to be}} affected by rough weather. This is achieved by means of a light, quickly deployable flexible structure that should stay in place until all the tanks of the wreck are emptied and the pollution threat eliminated. The buffer reservoir, into which the spilt fuel is channelled, is provided with standard equipment through which shuttle vessels, weather permitting, can recover the fuel rapidly, using standard off-shore equipment and procedures.

50|$|From an army manual on {{pile driving}} hammers:The initial start {{up of the}} hammer {{requires}} the piston (ram) to be raised {{to a point where}} the trip automatically releases the piston, allowing it to fall by gravity. As the piston falls, it activates the fuel pump, which discharges a metered amount of fuel into the ball pan of the impact block. The falling piston also blocks the exhaust ports, and compression of <b>fuel</b> <b>trapped</b> in the cylinder begins. The compressed air exerts a pre-load force to hold the impact block firmly against the drive cap and pile. At the bottom of the compression stroke, the piston strikes the impact block, atomizing the fuel and starting the pile on its downward movement. In the instant after the piston strikes, the atomized fuel ignites, and the resulting explosion exerts an even greater force on the already moving pile, driving it further into the ground. The reaction of the explosion rebounding from the resistance of the pile drives the piston upward. As the piston rises, the exhaust ports open, releasing the gases and force of the explosion into the atmosphere. After the piston stops its upward movement, it again falls by gravity to start another cycle.|$|R
40|$|Recently, the {{development}} of a novel ultrasonic inspection technique that detects radial fatigue cracks {{on the far side of}} so-called “weep” holes in thin airframe stiffeners was reported [1]. These cracks tend to be located on the upper part of the weep hole (at 12 o’clock position) therefore are not readily detectable by conventional ultrasonic inspection techniques from the lower skin of the wing. The new technique utilizes circumferential creeping waves propagating around the inner surface of the hole to perform the inspection. However, the wet wing has to be emptied and dried out before inspection because even a small amount of fluid <b>fuel</b> <b>trapped</b> in these rather small (approximately 6 – 7 mm in diameter) holes would strongly affect the propagation of circumferential creeping waves. We have searched the literature for published results on circumferential creeping wave propagation around fluid-filled cylindrical cavities in elastic media. Surprisingly, although the analytical solution of this canonical problem can be readily constructed from existing building blocks, very little was found in terms of numerical results that could be used to gain better understanding of the phenomenon. This motivated us to attack the problem by numerically solving the dispersion equation and constructing the corresponding dispersion and attenuation curves for a specific case of interest, namely, for that of a water-filled cylindrical hole in aluminum...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} and breakup of diesel sprays was investigated experimentally {{on a common}} rail diesel injector using a long range microscope. The objectives were to further the fundamental understanding of the processes involved in the initial stage of diesel spray formation. Tests were conducted at atmospheric conditions and on a rapid compression machine with motored in-cylinder peak pressures up to 8 MPa, and injection pressures up to 160 MPa. The light source and long range imaging optics were optimised to produce blur-free shadowgraphic images of sprays with a resolution of 0. 6 µm per pixel, and a viewing region of 768 × 614 µm. Such fine spatial and temporal resolutions allowed the observation of previously unreported shearing instabilities and stagnation point {{on the tip of}} diesel jets. The tip of the fuel jet was seen to take the shape of an oblate spheroidal cap immediately after leaving the nozzle, due to the combination of transverse expansion of the jet and the physical properties of the fuel. The spheroidal cap was found to consist of residual <b>fuel</b> <b>trapped</b> in the injector hole {{after the end of the}} injection process. The formation of fuel ligaments close to the orifice was also observed, ligaments which were subsequently seen to breakup into droplets through hydrodynamic and capillary instabilities. An ultra-high speed camera was then used to capture the dynamics of the early spray {{formation and}} primary breakup with fine temporal and spatial resolutions. The frame rate was up to 5 million images per second and exposure time down to 20 ns, with a fixed resolution of 1280 × 960 pixels covering a viewing region of 995 × 746 µm. A vortex ring motion within the vapourised spheroidal cap was identified, and resulted in a slipstream effect which led to a central ligament being propelled ahead of the liquid jet...|$|R
50|$|An Onboard {{refueling}} {{vapor recovery}} system (ORVR) is a vehicle fuel vapor emission control system that captures volatile organic compounds (VOC, potentially harmful vapors) during refueling. There {{are two types of}} vehicle emission control systems: the ORVR, and the Stage II vapor recovery system. Without either of these two systems, <b>fuel</b> vapors <b>trapped</b> inside gas tanks would be released into the atmosphere, each time refueling of the vehicle occurred. However, an ORVR system is able to retain those emissions, delivering them to the vehicle's carbon-filled canister and then to dispose of those vapors by adding them to the engine intake manifold and the stream of fuel supplying the engine, during normal operation. The goal behind implementing the ORVR system throughout the U.S. is to eventually make the Stage II systems obsolete.|$|R

40|$|Naturally, {{there are}} complex {{interactions}} among {{internal combustion engine}} parameters such as in-cylinder pressure, emissions, speed, and load. These basic relationships are studied in a naturally aspirated, spark-ignited, two-stroke, large-bore natural gas engine. The typical application for such an engine is operating heavy machinery such as large compressors and oil field pump jacks. Cylinder pressure averaged over 300 cycles is captured for eight speeds from 350 to 525 RPM and six loads of 50 % to 100 % of maximum torque at each respective speed. Non-sequential individual cycle pressure curves are captured to depict cyclic variation at each operating point. Emissions are measured for each operating point. Equivalence ratio, delivery ratio, and trapping efficiencies are also calculated. The behavior of these parameters are then quantified and described {{in the context of}} cyclic variation. It is shown that low load cyclic variation is extreme, having coefficient of variance (COV) of indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) values over 40 %. Low load cycles are shown to frequently misfire or experience partial burn. Cyclic variation is shown to decrease with increasing load and decreasing speed. Air flow rate is shown to increase with engine speed. It is also shown that the overall system equivalence ratio is highest at high loads and low speeds, and the values are between 0. 55 and 0. 90. Brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) is suspected to decrease with increasing load, likely due to improved scavenging at high load. Delivery ratio is shown to be, on average, slightly greater than 1. 0 at most operating conditions. <b>Fuel</b> <b>trapping</b> efficiency has a complex trend with increasing speed. Air trapping efficiencies disagree with those calculated for fuel, and are likely incorrect due to the lean-burning nature of the engine. Scavenging efficiency results are not credible. Emissions of CO 2, NO, and THC are shown (and emissions of CH 4 are suspected) to have an inverse correlation with cyclic variation; emissions of O 2 are shown (and emissions of CO are suspected) to have direct correlation with cyclic variation...|$|R

Carbon dioxide, which is released during the combustion of conventional <b>fuels,</b> <b>traps</b> heat within earth's atmosphere and as a result the global temperature is expected to rise at levels above any experienced before by our civilisation. In order for the carbon dioxide emissions, which are released to the atmosphere by human activities with{{in buildings}}, to be stabilised and reduced, all new buildings should be designed towards net operational zero emissions. More than forty percent of the energy consumed in UK is within buildings. By exploring all the options for the provision of low carbon energy and the efficient use of energy this thesis provides a background in technologies and examines their value to a building. Low and zero carbon technologies are qualitatively and quantitatively assessed especially for new buildings. For all the technologies examined, technical aspects of their design are appraised and their financial viability in the current business environment is examined.

5000|$|Most {{automotive}} engines use aluminum pistons {{that move}} in an iron cylinder. The average temperature of a piston crown in a gasoline engine during normal operation is typically about , and the coolant {{that runs through}} the engine block is usually regulated at approximately [...] Aluminum expands more than iron at this temperature range, so for the piston to fit the cylinder properly when at a normal operating temperature, the piston must have a loose fit when cold. In the 1970s, increasing concern over exhaust pollution caused the U.S. government to form the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which began writing and enforcing rules that required automobile manufacturers to introduce changes that made their engines run cleaner. By the late 1980s, automobile exhaust pollution had been noticeably improved, but more stringent regulations forced car manufacturers to adopt the use of electronically controlled fuel injection and hypereutectic pistons. Regarding pistons, it was discovered that when an engine was cold during start-up, a small amount of <b>fuel</b> became <b>trapped</b> between the piston rings. As the engine warmed up, the piston expanded and expelled this small amount of fuel which added to the amount of unburnt hydrocarbons in the exhaust.|$|R
40|$|Partially Premixed Combustion (PPC) is a {{promising}} combustion concept for future IC engines. However, controllability of PPC {{is still a}} challenge and needs more investigation. The scope {{of the present study}} is to investigate the ignition sensitivity of PPC to the injection timing at different injection pressures. To better understand this, high-speed shadowgraphy is used to visualize fuel injection and evaporation at different Start of Injections (SOI). Spray penetration and injection targeting are derived from shadowgraphy movies. OH* chemiluminescence is used to comprehensively study the stratification level of combustion which is helpful for interpretation of ignition sensitivity behavior. Shadowgraphy results confirm that SOI strongly affects the spray penetration and evaporation of fuel. However, spray penetration and ignition sensitivity are barely affected by the injection pressure. There is a critical SOI range, in which a significant amount of <b>fuel</b> is <b>trapped</b> in the crevice volume. Injection in this critical range has a negative influence on the combustion efficiency and ignition sensitivity. Impingement of liquid fuel on the piston crown advances the combustion phasing by providing higher levels of stratification. Moreover, results of combustion stratification study show that stratification level has an inverse correlation with combustion phasing of PPC for late injections...|$|R

The obvious solution is to bend the tube around into a torus (donut) shape. But doing so causes the solenoid windings to be closer together on the inside of the curve, simply because of its smaller radius.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{experiments to}} investigate high-altitude relight of a lean direct injection (LDI) combustor. The features that make LDI technology less polluting {{in terms of}} NOx compared to conventional combustors are expected to impede relight performance. Therefore an improved understanding of ignition behaviour is required to ensure that stringent relight requirements can be satisfied. Realistic operating conditions are simulated in a ground-based test facility. The application of laser diagnostics presents particular difficulties due to the large quantities of liquid fuel that impinge on the combustor walls during relight. Advances {{are made in the}} application of planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) to monitor fuel placement in a combustor under these conditions. A novel apparatus is developed to deliver a laser sheet to the combustion chamber while protecting all optical surfaces from contamination. The PLIF images are compared with the cold flow field obtained from CFD modelling. These results indicate that <b>fuel</b> becomes <b>trapped</b> inside the central recirculation zone in high concentrations. High-speed flame imaging performed simultaneously with the PLIF measurements provides important insights into the motion and breakup of flame during relight. An algorithm developed to track the flame activity reveals that the initial spark kernel is convected downstream, before breaking apart and moving upstream towards a recovery origin close to the fuel injector.

Rocket engines have cycle lifetimes measured in minutes or even seconds, preventing truly heavy deposits. However, rockets are much more sensitive to a deposit, as described above. Thus, kerosene systems generally entail more teardowns and overhauls, creating operations and labor expenses. This is a problem for expendable engines as well as reusable ones, because engines must be ground-fired some number of times before launch. Even cold-flow tests, in which the propellants are not ignited, can leave residues.|$|R
40|$|PLIF {{has been}} used to observe the {{in-cylinder}} transport of unburned <b>fuel</b> that, while <b>trapped</b> in the ring-land and ring-groove crevices, survives combustion in the propagating flame.

At the location of the top-ring gap, we observed unburned fuel lying in the cool boundary layer along the cylinder wall during the later stages of the expansion stroke. This layer is scraped into the roll-up vortex during the exhaust stroke. These data lead us to conclude that away from the end gap, unburned, high pressure charge, trapped between the two compression rings escapes as a wall jet after ring-reversal near the bottom center.

Gold proposed that fossil <b>fuels</b> were <b>trapped</b> inside the core of the Earth in randomized molecular form nearly 4.5 billion years ago. Over time, the extreme heat of the core [...] "sweated" [...] the rocks that contained these molecules, pushing them up through the porous layers of the Earth. As they move up toward the surface, the hydrocarbons fueled the development of large microbial colonies, which served as the basis for life on Earth. The migrating fossil fuels collect biological remnants before becoming trapped in deep underground reservoirs. Soon after Gold started publishing his theories, researchers discovered a number of ecosystems functioning under [...] "conditions of heat and pressure once thought impossible to sustain life". In addition, Gold discovered that the location of major oil-producing regions in the Middle East and southeast Asia was defined by large scale patterns in surface geology and topography, such as deep fault lines. He also pointed to the abundance of helium in oil and gas reserves as evidence for [...] "a deep source of the hydrocarbons". Moreover, a few oil reserves thought to have been exhausted were suddenly generating vast amounts of crude oil. [...] From this, Gold proposed that the Earth may possess a virtually endless supply - suggesting as much as [...] "at least 500 million years' worth of gas" [...] - of fossil fuels.|$|R
40|$|Processes {{of erosion}} and {{redeposition}} {{and their impact}} on plasma facing materials in devices for magnetically confined fusion are discussed. Volatile molecules formed in the erosion process are partly pumped out but the majority of species released from the wall components returns to the surface causing the modification of its morphology. Prompt redeposition and redeposition after global transport reduce the gross erosion at any surface. Detailed analysis shows that erosion and deposition can coexist on otherwise erosion-dominated surfaces due to local inhomogenities. The erosion yield of redeposited material of sub-monolayer thickness significantly differs from that observed for thick targets. On deposition dominated areas one observes the formation of thick co-deposits containing a mixture of <b>trapped</b> <b>fuel</b> atoms (hydrogen isotopes) and species removed originally from the wall. This leads to a large and long-term fuel accumulation (tritium inventory) in a device. Reduced mechanical integrity of such layers stimulates their flaking and peeling-off if a critical thickness has been reached. This, in turn, results in the formation of hydrogen-rich dust particles.

50|$|Volumetric {{efficiency}} (VE) in {{an internal}} combustion engine design refers to the efficiency with which the engine can move the charge of fuel and air {{into and out of}} the cylinders. Volumetric efficiency is also the ratio of air volume drawn into the cylinder to the cylinder's swept volume. More specifically, volumetric efficiency is a ratio (or percentage) of the mass of air and <b>fuel</b> that is <b>trapped</b> by the cylinder during induction divided by the mass that would occupy the displaced volume if the air density in the cylinder were equal to the ambient air density. The flow restrictions in the intake system create a pressure drop in the inlet flow which reduces the density (unless boosts like turbos or superchargers or cam tuning techniques are used). Volumetric efficiency can be improved in a number of ways, most effectively this can be achieved by compressing the induction charge (forced induction) or by aggressive cam phasing in naturally aspirated engines as seen in racing applications. In the case of forced induction volumetric efficiency can exceed 100%.|$|R
40|$|High-energy {{materials}} such as emulsions, slurries and ammonium-nitrate fuel-oil (ANFO) explosives play crucial roles in mining, quarrying, tunnelling and many other infrastructure activities, because of their excellent transport and blasting properties. These explosives engender environmental concerns, due to atmospheric pollution caused by emission of dust and nitrogen oxides (NOx) from blasts, the latter characterised by the average emission factor of 5 kg (t AN explosive) − 1. This first-of-its-kind review provides a concise literature account {{of the formation of}} NOx during blasting of AN-based explosives, employed in surface operations. We estimate the total NOx emission rate from AN-based explosives as 0. 05 Tg (i. e., 5 × 104 t) N per annum, compared to the total global annual anthropogenic NOx emissions of 41. 3 × 106 t N y− 1. Although minor in the global sense, the large localised plumes from blasting exhibit high NOx concentration (500 ppm) exceeding up to 3000 times the international standards. This emission has profound consequences at mining sites and for adjacent atmospheric environment, necessitating expensive management of exclusion zones. The review describes different types of AN energetic materials for civilian applications, and summarises the essential properties and terminologies pertaining to their use. Furthermore, we recapitulate the mechanisms that lead to the formation of the reactive nitrogen species in blasting of AN-based explosives, review their implications to atmospheric air pollution, and compare the mechanisms with those experienced in other thermal and combustion operations. We also examine the mitigation approaches, including guidelines and operational-control measures. The review discusses the abatement technologies such as the formulation of new explosive mixtures, comprising secondary <b>fuels,</b> spin <b>traps</b> and other additives, in light of their effectiveness and efficiency.

His 1958 description was simple and direct: Magnetic confinement in the stellarator is based on a strong magnetic field produced by solenoidal coils encircling a toroidal tube. The configuration is characterized by a 'rotational transform', such that a single line of magnetic force, followed around the system, intersects a cross-sectional plane in points which successively rotate about the magnetic axis. ... A rotational transform may be generated either by a solenoidal field in a twisted, or figure-eight shaped, tube, or by the use of an additional transverse multipolar helical field, with helical symmetry.|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} study, {{in order to}} investigate the effect of charge stratification on combustion behavior such as combustion efficiency and combustion phasing which also largely affects the emissions, an experiment was conducted in a heavy-duty compression ignition (CI) metal engine. The engine behavior and emission characteristics were studied in the transition from HCCI mode to PPC mode by varying the start of injection (SOI) timing. To gain more detailed information of the mixing process, in-cylinder laser diagnostic measurements, namely fuel-tracer planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) imaging, were conducted in an optical version of the heavy-duty CI engine mentioned above. To the authors’ best knowledge, {{this is the first}} time to perform fuel-tracer PLIF measurements in an optical engine with a close to production bowl in piston combustion chamber, under transition conditions from HCCI to PPC mode. Results show that four mixing schemes can be distinguished as the SOI timings are varied during the transition. They are linked to the results presented in the reference paper, where emissions were varied in different zones. For SOI at - 100 crank angle degree (CAD), fuel distribution is homogeneous as expected. With other SOI timings, a significant part of the <b>fuel</b> mixture was <b>trapped</b> in the squish region and crevice area before start of combustion (SOC) as shown by PLIF results. The observations in the reference metal engine paper were confirmed by this measurement. Results are also in good agreement with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations performed for this engine...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDetailed {{measurements}} of near-nozzle spray formation {{are essential to}} better understand and predict the physical processes involved in diesel fuel atomisation. We used long-range microscopy to investigate the primary atomisation of diesel, biodiesel and kerosene fuels in the near-nozzle region, both at atmospheric and realistic engine conditions. High spatial and temporal resolutions allowed a detailed observation of the very emergence of fuel from the nozzle orifice. The fluid that first exited the nozzle resembled mushroom-like structures, as occasionally reported by other researchers for atmospheric conditions, with evidence of interfacial shearing instabilities and stagnation points. We captured the dynamics of this phenomenon using an ultra-fast framing camera with frame rates up to 5 million images per second, and identified these structures as residual fluid trapped in the orifice between injections. The residual fluid has an internal vortex ring motion which results in a slipstream effect that can propel a microscopic ligament of liquid fuel ahead. We showed that this mechanism {{is not limited to}} laboratory setups, and that it occurs for diesel fuels injected at engine-like conditions with production injectors. Our findings confirm that <b>fuel</b> can remain <b>trapped</b> in the injector holes after the end of injection. Although we could not measure the hydrocarbon content of the trapped vapourised fluid, we observed that its density was lower than that of the liquid fuel, but higher than that of the in-cylinder gas. We conclude that high-fidelity numerical models should not assume in their initial conditions that the sac and orifices of fuel injectors are filled with in-cylinder gas. Instead, our observations suggest that the nozzle holes should be considered partially filled with a dense fluid...|$|R
40|$|High-quality Ce 3 +-doped Y 3 Al 5 O 12 (YAG:Ce 3 +) {{phosphors}} were synthesized by a facile sol-gel combustion method. In this sol-gel combustion process, {{citric acid}} {{acts as a}} <b>fuel</b> for combustion, <b>traps</b> the constituent cations and reduces the diffusion length of the precursors. The XRD and FT-IR results show that YAG phase can form through sintering at 900 degrees C for 2 h. This temperature is much lower than that required to synthesize YAG phase via the solid-state reaction method. There were no intermediate phases such as YAlO 3 (YAP) and Y 4 Al 2 O 9 (YAM) observed in the sintering process. The average grain size of the phosphors sintered at 900 - 1100 degrees C is about 40 nm. With the increasing of sintering temperature, the emission intensity increases due to the improved crystalline and homogeneous distribution of Ce 3 + ions. A blue shift has been observed in the Ce 3 + emission spectrum of YAG:Ce 3 + phosphors with increasing sintering temperatures from 900 to 1200 degrees C. It can be explained that the decrease of lattice constant affects the crystal field around Ce 3 + ions. The emission intensity of 0. 06 Ce-doped YAG phosphors {{is much higher than}} that of the 0. 04 Ce and 0. 02 Ce ones. The red-shift at higher Ce 3 + concentrations may be Ce-Ce interactions or variations in the unit cell parameters between YAG:Ce 3 + and YAG. It can be concluded that the sol-gel combustion synthesis method provides a good distribution of Ce 3 + activators at the molecular level in YAG matrix. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.
