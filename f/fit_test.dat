2500|$|Fit {{testing of}} tight-fitting masks of negative-pressure {{respirators}} became {{widely used in}} US industry in 1980-s. At the beginning, {{it was thought that}} the half-mask fit quite well to the worker's face, if during a <b>fit</b> <b>test</b> the protection factor (fit factor) is not less than 10 (later, experts began to use [...] "safety factor" [...] = 10 during the fit test; threshold fit factor become 10 × 10 = 100). The widespread use of fit testing in the industry gives professionals optimism, and they allowed to the employers restrict the use of half mask respirators in accordance with the values of worker's personal fit factor (the maximum concentration of pollutants = personal Fit Factor × PEL), but not more than 100 × PEL. However, scientific studies have shown that although such test increases the effectiveness of protection, the risk of leakage of large amounts of unfiltered air is maintained. Furthermore, the studies have shown that non-filtered air under the mask is not uniformly mixed with the filtered air, which leads to large errors in the measurement of the in-facepiece concentration of contaminants, and subsequent calculations of fit factors - the latter is often much smaller than the [...] "measured" [...] value. So, specialists recommend not allowed usage negative pressure half mask respirators then harmful substances' concentrations exceeds 10 PEL. Therefore, OSHA standards require to restrict using of half-mask negative-pressure respirators up to 10 PEL after obtaining fit factor {{greater than or equal to}} 100 during the mask selection for the worker (they used a safety factor = 10).|$|E

30|$|The {{exposure}} risk to MERS-CoV can exert significant psychosocial {{stress on}} HCWs. Death {{has occurred in}} young HCWs who acquired MERS-CoV infection [28], which adds to this fear. During the SARS outbreak in Toronto, a survey of HCWs found that > 60  % of respondents reported SARS-related concern for their own or their family’s health [29]. Moreover, 29  % of respondents had probable emotional distress [29]. During our outbreak, many ICU staff expressed concerns about acquiring MERS. Staff safety should be a primary goal in a hospital infectious outbreak. Pregnant and immunocompromised staff should be redeployed to lower-risk areas [30], which we did. Proper exposure management should be pre-planned, which was determined in our IDEP. N 95 respirator <b>fit</b> <b>testing</b> should be performed at hiring of new staff and done for all other staff before any outbreak. Although <b>fit</b> <b>testing</b> was required for all staff, many did not have <b>fit</b> <b>testing</b> done. However, {{in response to the}} outbreak, <b>fit</b> <b>testing</b> was performed to all staff and powered air-purifying respirators were provided to those who failed <b>fit</b> <b>testing.</b> Strict infection prevention and control practices should be implemented and audited. This was performed in our units. Repetitive training is recommended [31]. Despite intensive infection prevention practices, 3 of our ICU staff had MERS-CoV infection during the outbreak likely due to suboptimal PPE use while intubating yet undiagnosed patients.|$|R

Since there is not necessarily random mating within populations, the appropriate hypothesis to construct exact tests is that of independent sampling of genotypes.
