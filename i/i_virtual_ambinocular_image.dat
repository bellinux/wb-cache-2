The most common strategy has been to adapt orthodox instruments and procedures to the virtual context.

We will then describe, analyse, and compare the main virtual network mapping algorithms for cloud infrastructure networks found in existing literature: i) VNE-Least, ii) VNE-Cluster, iii) VNE-Subdividing, iv) VNE-Greedy and v) VNE-AC.

40|$|The present chapter pursues the {{question}} if virtual violence is morally problematic behavior. Virtual violence {{is defined as}} any user behavior intended to do harm to perceived social agents who apparently try to avoid the harm-doing. The chapter reviews existing literature that suggests that users hurt themselves if they get en-gaged in virtual violence and that users may also do harm other users if they direct their violent acts against their avatars. Recent research is reviewed that further suggests that users may intuitively perceive virtual agents as social beings. They may thus intend to do harm to other social beings (instead of objects) when con-ducting virtual violence. The chapter also tackles (and denies) the idea that auto-nomous virtual agents are living entities that may suffer from virtual violence. In light of the reviewed evidence, virtual violence is considered morally problematic behavior. <b>Is</b> <b>Virtual</b> Violence Morally Problematic Behavior?

40|$|PSYCHOACOUSTIC FOUNDATION The general {{definition}} of multi-part music (polyphony) {{is based on}} what musicians or singers actually perform – “music {{in more than one}} part ” (N. Grove, 22001, vol. 19 : 74), “music in multiple parts ” (ibidem: 75), “music in more than one voice ” (Oesterr. Musiklexikon, 2004, Bd. 3 : 1406). Nevertheless in Western as well as in non-Western music phases of compositions exist in which what is performed as distinctive parts does not correspond to what a listener can hear as melodic or rhythmic lines. The played or sung image is different from the heard image. Even in strictly one-voice pieces or sequences, the impression of several different parts can occur. As they are not played or sung explicitly, these parts should be called “virtual”. Consequently, psychoacoustics is challenged to give appropriate explanations of such “virtual multi-part music”. <b>I</b> <b>Virtual</b> multi-part music can be found in Western music, particularly in compositions of the Baroque period.

In this work, we develop Suspend-aware Segment Cleaning for the log-structured file system.

The Suspend-aware Segment Cleaning consists of two key ingredients: (<b>i)</b> <b>Virtual</b> Segment Cleaning and (ii) Utilization-based Segment Cleaning. We implement Suspend-aware Segment Cleaning in commodity smartphone which uses the log-structured file system, F 2 FS, as its stock file system (Moto G).

40|$|Abstract: Those {{who live}} in {{isolated}} communities often lack reliable, skilled employment opportunities, which fundamentally undermines their human security. For individuals who wish to remain in their isolated communities for family, religious, philosophical or other reasons, their attachment to their communities creates a disincentive for higher education. This promotes low educational achievement, which in turn results in low socioeconomic status, lack of social mobility, and a generational cycle of poverty. The hu-man misery that results from such a feedback loop is observed in isolated communities throughout North America, including aboriginal communities in Canada. Fortunately, maturation of information and commu-nication technologies now offers individuals the potential to gain high-skilled employment while living in an isolated community, using both (<b>i)</b> <b>virtual</b> work/remote work and (ii) remote training and education. To examine that potential, this study: 1) categorizes high-skill careers that demand a higher education and are widely viable for remote work, 2) examines options for obtaining the required education remotely, and 3) performs an economic analysis of investing in remote education, quantifying the results in return on investment.
