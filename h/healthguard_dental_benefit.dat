40|$|Goal and Objectives: The goal of {{this study}} is to assess parental {{knowledge}} and experience regarding children 2 ̆ 7 s dental insurance, following enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The ACA emphasizes the importance of oral health, making pediatric dental services one of ten essential health benefits. With this major change in health care reform, parents should be equipped to make informed decisions regarding their children 2 ̆ 7 s dental care and insurance. Data from the first open enrollment period show lack of true mandate and subsequent lack of compliance to this pediatric dental objective. One of our aims was to assess uptake of pediatric <b>dental</b> <b>benefits,</b> type selected and effects on experience related to utilization, scheduling timeliness, and cost satisfaction. This study would allow dental professionals to better assist parents in navigating children 2 ̆ 7 s dental insurance and assist policymakers in improving access to care. Methods: The 28 -question survey was administered to a national sample of 421 parents, of children ages 18 and younger. The states included were those operating through the Federally-Facilitated Marketplace (37 states). Data was collected by SurveyMonkey® via online survey and analyzed by an NSU statistical consultant. The data identified pediatric dental insurance status, source and type, parental knowledge of the marketplaces and pediatric <b>dental</b> <b>benefits</b> being an essential health benefit, issues in utilization, access to care, changes in providers, cost, satisfaction, and quality of care. Results: The majority of the sample respondents had incomes above the federal poverty level and had a Bachelor 2 ̆ 7 s degree or higher level of education. The majority of the sample respondents had pediatric <b>dental</b> <b>benefits.</b> For those who didn 2 ̆ 7 t, a major reason was due to plans being too expensive. The majority of the sample respondents selected pediatric <b>dental</b> <b>benefits</b> through their employer and selected a qualified health plan that included dental coverage (embedded plan) or a stand-alone dental plan. Regarding knowledge of the ACA, many didn 2 ̆ 7 t know that dental care for children is one of ten essential services covered.

40|$|Abstract: Uninsured {{older adults}} {{are twice as}} likely to not receive needed dental care as their insured counterparts. Yet, nearly one-third of older adults have {{untreated}} dental caries, and older adults are more likely to have complete tooth loss, periodontal disease, and oral cancer. Moreover, persons sixty-five and older had the lowest percentage of individuals with dental insurance and the highest average out-of-pocket expenses of all persons with a dental visit in 2000. Given that retiree health benefits for large companies have declined from 66 percent in 1988 to 38 percent in 2003, it is unlikely that the private sector will increase funding for <b>dental</b> <b>benefits</b> for the elderly. However, some Medicare managed care plans already cover either preventive or comprehensive <b>dental</b> <b>benefits.</b> The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 created incentives for Medicare managed care plans to offer beneficiaries additional <b>benefits,</b> including <b>dental.</b> The First Seniority Dental Plan, described in this article, demonstrates that it is possible to create a dental plan that is affordable for the HMO, reimburses providers at reasonable rates, provides a reduction in costs to Medicare beneficiaries, and may present a method to expand <b>dental</b> <b>benefits</b> for elders of the future...|$|R
40|$|Audit {{objectives}} and criteria The audit {{objective was to}} assess the effectiveness of the Department of Health’s and the Department of Human Services’ management and administration of the Child <b>Dental</b> <b>Benefits</b> Schedule. To form a conclusion against the audit objective, the ANAO adopted the following high-level audit criteria: 	Health and Human Services have effective governance and administrative arrangements to support the delivery of the Child <b>Dental</b> <b>Benefits</b> Schedule; 	Human Services has implemented systems and processes to administer payments to eligible clients in an accurate and timely manner; and 	Health and Human Services effectively monitor, evaluate and report on compliance and performance to inform delivery of the Child <b>Dental</b> <b>Benefits</b> Schedule. Conclusion Health and Human Services’ day-to-day administration of the Child <b>Dental</b> <b>Benefits</b> Schedule has been largely effective. The ANAO identified scope for improvement in relation to Health’s risk management planning for the program and Human Services’ quality framework for the manual data matching process used to maintain the integrity of program data. The policy design of the program has addressed some of the shortcomings of the previous Medicare Teen Dental Plan. In common with the previous program, the CDBS continues to attract relatively low customer uptake—around 30  per cent in the 2014 and 2015 calendar years—as compared to Health’s projections, resulting in a significant underspend of allocated funding. In the context of low program uptake, there should be a focus on improved communication with the target population and review activity to inform advice to government on the progress and future directions of the CDBS. The program’s second year of operation ends in December 2015 and is an appropriate point for Health to take stock...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to explore a possible association between infant mortality rate (IMR) and Medicaid <b>dental</b> <b>benefit</b> payouts per state, as well as propose an expansion of the <b>dental</b> <b>benefits</b> provided through Medicaid. Data was obtained from the Vital Statistics report 2012 and the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Medicaid coverage database for fiscal year 2011. Population and demographic data was also collected for further comparison. The states observed were Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. The IMR data was ranked in ascending order and then the dental payments were compared between the seven southern states. There did not appear to be an association between the two variables. It was hypothesized that the state with the highest IMR would have the least amount of Medicaid dental payments; possibly indicating limited benefits and a need for expansion. The data did not support the hypothesis. Although Mississippi had the highest IMR at 9. 9 per 1, 000 live births, the amount <b>dental</b> <b>benefits</b> paid through Medicaid was not the lowest. Kentucky had the lowest IMR at 6. 9 per 1, 000 live births, and North Carolina had the highest amount of dental payments with $ 352, 602 being paid by the state. However, the comparing variable in each state did not reflect an association. Limitations of the study were addressed and suggested improvements were made for future studies that would possibly yield significant findings. In conclusion, the data collected and observed did not provide evidence that the expansion of Medicaid <b>dental</b> <b>benefits</b> would combat infant mortality rates across the country...|$|R

40|$|The United States {{per capita}} health care {{spending}} is {{the highest in the}} world. This dissertation addresses the impact of additional {{health care spending}}/medical service usage on health status. First two chapters investigate the role of insurance on medical service use in understudied dental market. The third chapter examines the effectiveness of additional health care spending on infant health outcomes. The first chapter estimates the causal relationship between adult Medicaid <b>dental</b> <b>benefits</b> and <b>dental</b> service usage for low-income adults by using difference-in-differences technique exploiting the state-level variation in adult Medicaid <b>dental</b> <b>benefit.</b> The results suggest that adult Medicaid <b>dental</b> <b>benefit</b> increases the possibility of dental visit by 16. 4 - 22 percent. The evidence that the increased dental service use improves dental health among low-income people is also presented. The second chapter investigates the relationship between dental insurance and dental service use among older populations. Between ages of 61 and 68, 24 percent of people with at least high school diploma lose dental insurance. The decrease in dental coverage is primarily driven by the loss of employer provided <b>dental</b> <b>benefit</b> with retirement. Utilizing this rapid drop {{in the number of people}} with dental insurance at around age 65, I find that there is no evidence of a decrease in dental service usage among older populations. The third chapter, which is co-authored with Marks, addresses the benefit of additional health care spending for newborns. We use the number of infants born on a given day in a given location as an identifying variable to generate exogenous variation in health care spending. Using detailed information on every hospital birth in California from 2002 to 2006, we find that hospital stays are less intensive when the hospitalization region is more crowded. The second stage analysis suggests that the additional health care spending on infants born on less crowded days does not improve infant health status measured by mortality rate and readmission rate...|$|R

40|$|Medicaid is {{the primary}} {{insurance}} program for low-income adult Pennsylvanians seeking both medical and dental coverage. Pennsylvania’s Medicaid program provides payment for dental services rendered to eligible recipients by dentists that are enrolled under the program. Under the Affordable Care Act, dental care for adults is not an essential <b>benefit.</b> In 2012, <b>dental</b> <b>benefits</b> were reduced for adult Pennsylvanians to basic dental care. This policy analysis examines how reduced <b>dental</b> <b>benefits</b> have impacted adult Medicaid recipients in Pennsylvania and the various policy options that could potentially improve their access to oral health care. The policies examined were: expand Medicaid coverage for beneficiaries and increase dental reimbursement rates, extend the dental workforce to include dental therapists (midlevel providers), and institute a dental surveillance program. A literature review was conducted to determine the effectiveness {{of each of these}} policy options. Evidence from other states’ Medicaid <b>dental</b> <b>benefits</b> was utilized to determine political, economic and administrative viability. There is compelling evidence, which suggests that expanding Medicaid coverage, increasing reimbursement rates, and utilizing dental therapists may provide a solution for improving oral health care access to Pennsylvania’s adult Medicaid population. There are, however, not enough state-based data on Medicaid recipients’ self-perception of oral health status or their actual oral health status, dentists’ beliefs regarding Medicaid, and oral health indicators in Pennsylvania. This information indicates that developing an ongoing oral health surveillance program should be the first step to improve oral health access for adult Medicaid recipients.
