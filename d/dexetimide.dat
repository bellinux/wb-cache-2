40|$|We report here a novel {{strategy}} for the selective labeling and localization of the M 4 (m 4) muscarinic receptor subtype, based on the distinct kinetics of the muscarinic antagonists <b>dexetimide</b> and N-methylscopolamine (NMS) and on the selectivity profile of guanylpirenzepine and AF-DX 116 for the m 1 -m 5 muscarinic receptor subtypes expressed in CHO-K 1 cells. Incubation with 10 nM <b>dexetimide,</b> a nonselective antagonist, resulted in > 90 % occupancy {{of each of the}} m 1 -m 5 receptor subtypes. The relatively rapid rates of <b>dexetimide</b> dissociation from the m 1, m 2, and m 4 receptor subtypes (t 1 / 2 values of < 12. 5 min) and the slower rates of <b>dexetimide</b> dissociation from the m 3 and m 5 receptor subtypes (t 1 / 2 values of 65 and 75 min, respectively) favored the labeling of the m 1, m 2, and m 4 receptor subtypes with short incubations with [3 H]NMS. Inclusion of 200 nM guanylpirenzepine and 250 nM AF-DX 116 prevented the binding of [3 H]NMS to the majority of the m 1 and m 2 receptor subtypes, respectively, resulting in primary labeling of the m 4 receptor subtype. Brief dissociation of the radioligand in the presence of 1 microM atropine improved the ratio of m 4 to m 2 labeling by selectively removing [3 H]NMS from the m 2 subtype. Under these conditions, the ratio of [3 H]NMS binding to the m 4 versus m 1, m 2, m 3, and m 5 receptor subtypes was 4 : 1. In vitro autoradiography combined with these m 4 -selective labeling conditions demonstrated that the M 4 (m 4) receptor subtype was localized to the primary visual area (V 1, area 17, occipital cortex) and the basal ganglia, a distribution distinct from that demonstrated for the M 1 (m 1), M 2 (m 2), and M 3 (m 3) receptor subtypes. These results demonstrate that a combination of the distinct kinetics of <b>dexetimide</b> and NMS and the receptor subtype selectivity of guanylpirenzepine and AF-DX 116 provides a valuable labeling strategy to examine the distribution and localization of the M 4 (m 4) muscarinic receptor subtype in brain, peripheral tissues, and cell lines.

40|$|Calf {{forebrain}} homogenates contain 2. 8 pM muscarinic acetylcholine receptors per mg of protein. [3 H]Antagonist saturation binding experiments under {{equilibrium conditions}} revealed a single class of sites with equilibrium dissociation constants of 0. 82 nM for [3 H]dexetimide and 0. 095 nM for [3 H]quinuclidinyl benzilate.

Here we describe the solubilization of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors with digitonin and their purification by affinity chromatography using an affinity gel which consisted of <b>dexetimide</b> coupled to Affi-Gel 10 (i. e., carboxy N-hydroxysuccinimide esters linked via a 1 nm spacer arm to agarose beads).

40|$|The {{receptor}} affinities of 18 anticholinergics, {{expressed as}} dissociation constants, were determined {{in order to}} select the most active compounds. Six drugs showed high affinities towards the muscarinic receptor (K-d < 30 nM), and these compounds were selected as possible candidates for transdermal drug delivery because they can theoretically provide therapeutic plasma concentrations by dermal application on a limited area. From the six selected anticholinergics (atropine sulphate monohydrate. benztropine mesylate, <b>dexetimide</b> hydrochloride, oxyphencyclimine hydrochloride, scopolamine hydrobromide trihydrate; tropicamide), the physicochemical characteristics are described, together with atropine base. These characteristics {{may be useful to}} explain possible differences in permeation experiments. The chemical structures, molecular weights, and pK(a) values were available from the literature. The partition coefficients, and the solubility, pH and stability in the dosing and receptor solutions were experimentally determined. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} pharmacological alteration of drug-induced aggression in naive, morphine-dependent and chronically haloperidol treated rats. Naive rats {{were treated with}} apomorphine (1. 25 - 20 mg/Kg) and aggregated in groups of four for aggression. It was determined that 20 mg/Kg of apomorphine produced maximal aggression, as measured by number of attacks, duration of aggressive posturing and number of vocalizations. Doses less than 5 mg/Kg were without any effect. The neuroleptics, haloperidol and oxyperomide, the narcotic, morphine, and the cholinergic agonist, pilocarpine all reduced apomorphine-induced aggression in a dose dependent manner. Centrally acting anti-cholinergic drugs partially reversed the blockade of aggression produced by all the drugs except morphine which was preferentially antagonized by naloxone, a narcotic antagonist. Aggression was elicited by sub-threshold doses of apomorphine when combined with clonidine; large doses of <b>dexetimide,</b> an anticholinergic; or when administered three days after an injection of p-chloroamphetamine (12 mg/Kg). None of these drugs were capable of eliciting aggression by themselves. Amphetamine potentiated the apomorphine-induced aggression, but failed to elicit aggression with sub-threshold doses of apomorphine unless combined with cyproheptadine. In morphine-dependent rats, aggression was observed during withdrawal produced by withholding of injections, but not in withdrawal induced by naloxone. The aggression - which was observed at 72 hours and at 30 days of withdrawal - was reduced by morphine, haloperidol or by lesions of the dopaminergic nigro-striatal bundle, and enhanced by small doses of apomorphine. Apomorphine was also capable of eliciting aggression when administered at four hours of withdrawal, with or without naloxone. The 72 hour withdrawal aggression was similar to apomorphine-induced aggression in naive rats since it was dose-dependently increased by <b>dexetimide</b> or clonidine and decreased by pilocarpine. However, {{in contrast to the}} effect in naive rats, anticholinergic drugs failed to reverse the blockade of aggression produced by haloperidol in morphine dependent rats. Following chronic treatment with haloperidol, rats demonstrated signs of dopaminergic supersensitivity as shown by enhanced apomorphine- or amphetamine-induced stereotypy, increased spontaneous hyperactivity and a shift {{to the left of the}} dose-response curve for amphetamine stimulation and for apomorphine-induced reduction in striatal dopamine turnover. In addition, the rats exhibited an increased sensitivity to the stimulation of activity produced by <b>dexetimide</b> and a decrease in the depression of activity produced by pilocarpine. Although there was no spontaneous aggression after discontinuation of chronic halperidol, the threshold dose of apomorphine required to elicit aggression was dramatically reduced. Amphetamine failed to produce aggression after chronic haloperidol, in contrast to the effect normally seen after chronic morphine. The results of this study demonstrated the requirement of central dopaminergic stimulation for drug-induced aggression, and suggested that the aggression was antagonized by the activity of acetylcholine and serotonin and possibly facilitated by norepinephrine. In addition, it suggested that morphine and haloperidol produce an anti-aggression action by different mechanisms, possibly involving a cholinergic component in the case of haloperidol. Finally, the research provided evidence that the dopaminergic supersensitivity following chronic treatment with morphine may be qualitatively or quantitatively different from the supersensitivity following chronic treatment with haloperidol, since spontaneous and amphetamine stimulated aggression are noted only in the former case. It was proposed that morphine interferes with cholinergic and/or serotonergic compensatory mechanisms and that these contribute to the aggression...|$|E
40|$|Solid-phase {{extraction}} (SPE) {{by means}} of disposable columns has become a widely accepted technique for sample pretreatment in toxicology, both for directed analyses and for screening analyses. However, the sample capacity in SPE is usually limited to a few millilitres. Therefore, we have investigated to what extent these problems can be overcome by using Empore extraction disks, consisting of chemically modified C- 8 reversed-phase silica, embedded in an inert polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) matrix. Human urine {{was selected as the}} matrix and <b>dexetimide</b> and mepyramine were initially used as test drugs because these drugs were available in tritiated form. Additional drugs investigated included codeine, hexobarbital, imipramine, methamphetamine, and nitrazepam. In these investigations, the sample capacity for untreated urine was at least 25 mL, and analyte quantities up to 250 mug could be retained by these filters. Washing with water/methanol mixtures was successful in removing substantial amounts of endogenous interferences, and methanol proved to be an acceptable eluent. Thus, these disks seem to have interesting potential for toxicological analysis in that sample concentration and cleanup can be achieved at the same time...|$|E
40|$|Twenty {{antagonist}} substances {{with varying}} potencies for central and peripheral postsynaptic muscarinic receptors {{have been examined}} for effects on the central presynaptic muscarinic autoreceptor. This has been monitored by measuring the stimulating effects of the substances on acetylcholine synthesis by rat neocortical tissue prisms. Dose-response curves for selected agents showed that maximal stimulation of synthesis was to 136 - 140 % of the value without an antagonist. At a concentration of 1 microM, 17 of the substances caused {{a significant increase in}} synthesis, whilst at 0. 01 microM significant stimulation occurred with only atropine, <b>dexetimide,</b> N-methyl-piperdin- 4 -yl (R) - 2 -cyclohexyl- 2 -hydroxyl- 2 -phenylacetate, quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) and scopolamine. Linear regression analysis between synthesis values obtained with the substances and published data for the effects on either cholinoceptor-agonist induced contraction of guinea-pig ileum or the binding of [3 H]-QNB to rat forebrain membranes gave correlation coefficients of r = 0. 84 (P less than 0. 01), and r = 0. 75 (P less than 0. 02) respectively. The results provide no indication of a pharmacological difference between the central presynaptic muscarinic autoreceptor and central and peripheral postsynaptic muscarinic receptors...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{temperature}} on the binding of four agonists and three antagonists to rat heart muscarinic receptors was {{studied in the}} absence and presence of GTP. The binding of agonists to two states (or classes) of receptors, {{in the absence of}} GTP, led to enthalpy and entropy changes that decreased sharply above 25 degrees C, suggesting that agonists induced 'isomerization' reactions (large conformational changes and/or receptor-effector association). Both temperature increase and ethanol decreased hydrophobic interactions, thereby hindering binding and/or agonist-induced 'isomerization' reactions. Addition of GTP to the incubation medium also appeared to reverse (or prevent) 'isomerization' reactions. For agonist binding to the low-affinity state, in the presence of GTP, and for antagonist binding, the thermodynamic parameters observed could be readily explained by simple receptor-ligand associations; large entropy increases and small enthalpy increases, provoked by hydrophobic and ionic interactions, were partly neutralized by entropy and enthalpy decreases, due to hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions. The muscarinic antagonists used (atropine, n-methylscopolamine and <b>dexetimide),</b> being more hydrophobic molecules than the agonists tested (carbamylcholine, oxotremorine and pilocarpine), induced larger entropy changes or more negative enthalpy changes.

40|$|The {{permeation}} {{of seven}} anticholinergics was studied in vitro on pig epidermal membranes, using static Franz diffusion cells. The donor solution consisted of isotonic phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7. 4 with ethanol, propylene glycol and Azone(R). Tritium-labelled <b>dexetimide</b> was added as an internal standard. Ratios were calculated {{by dividing the}} percentage of permeated anticholinergic by the percentage of permeated [H- 3]dexetimide. For all anticholinergics, the use of ratios decreased the variations which shows the usefulness of [H- 3]dexetimide as an internal standard to correct for variations in the skin. For all anticholinergics, the lag times were comparable; however, the fluxes differed by about a factor of 6 between the highest and lowest values. These differences in permeation data were found not to correlate with the molecular weight and octanol/water partition coefficient or octanol/buffer partition coefficient. The differences in permeation between atropine base and atropine sulphate might be explained by differences in solubility and pH of the donor solution. The use of pig skin which had been frozen and stored for 2 months at - 80 degrees C, resulted in a higher permeability without any lag time. Therefore only fresh skin should be used.

40|$|Intracellular {{recordings}} {{were made}} from the large monopolar cells (LMCs), which are the cells postsynaptic to photoreceptors, in the housefly Musca domestica. A multi-barrelled ionophoretic pipette glued to the recording electrode was used to apply a variety of cholinergic and histaminergic antagonists onto the recorded neurones. All substances which blocked the physiological response to light also antagonized the response to ionophoretically applied histamine, supporting the hypothesis that histamine is the neurotransmitter released by insect photoreceptors. In order of potency, the following drugs were found to block or reduce the LMCs responses to light: benzoquinonium 3 = gallamine> ranitidine 3 = atropine ~ cimetidine> metiamide~SK&F 93479 ^ mepyramine. Mecamyl-amine, scopolamine, <b>dexetimide,</b> nicotine, mequitazine, chlorpheniramine and clemastine were ineffective. Two other cholinergic ligands, hexamethonium and decamethonium, were much more potent than even benzoquinonium, but {{had the effect of}} facilitating and greatly slowing down the responses to light. Responses evoked by acetylchol-ine showed a different pharmacology, being blocked by mecamylamine but unaffected by hexamethonium. Despite testing a number of known cholinergic and histaminergic agents, no effective agonist for histamine was found. The results indicate the existence of a novel class of histamine-sensitive receptor with nicotinic features. In addition the unusual effects of a traditional HI agonist, 2 -thiazolylethylamine, suggested the presence of a second, distinct class of histamine receptor...|$|E
40|$|Pituitary {{cells were}} cultured as {{three-dimensional}} reaggregates in serum-free chemically defined medium supplemented with different concentrations of dexamethasone. Immunostaining {{of the cells}} using a polyclonal antiserum and three monoclonal antibodies raised against choline acetyl transferase (CAT), revealed the presence of CAT immunoreactivity in 4 - 10 % of anterior pituitary cells depending on the antibody used. CAT immunoreactivity was also found in freshly dispersed anterior pituitary cells. CAT-immunoreactive cells could be enriched on BSA and Percoll gradients and codistributed with ACTH-immunoreactive cells in these gradients. Perifusion of the aggregates with the potent muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine (Atr) resulted in a dose-dependent (0. 1 - 100 nM) increase in both basal PRL and GH secretion; the response was dependent on the dexamethasone concentration in the culture medium. A similar response to Atr was observed in organ-cultured pituitaries. The specificity of the Atr effect {{was supported by the}} findings that the potent and highly specific muscarinic receptor blocker <b>dexetimide</b> showed a similar action, whereas its inactive enantiomer levetimide and the nicotinic receptor blocker hexamethonium failed to do so. Two other muscarinic antagonists, benzatropine and pirenzepine, showed a dose-dependent hormone-releasing action similar to that of Atr, but were less potent than the latter. Pirenzepine was only effective at high molar concentrations, suggesting that an M 2 muscarinic receptor subtype was mediating the present phenomenon. Atr also potentiated GH release stimulated by the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol and PRL release stimulated by vasoactive intestinal peptide, but had no effect on GRF-stimulated GH release. The choline uptake blocker hemicholinium abolished the effect of Atr on GH and PRL release. These data suggest that certain pituitary cells can express CAT activity and that these cells exert a tonic inhibitory activity on GH and PRL release which is mediated by a cholinomimetic substance, possibly acetylcholine, through a muscarinic receptor. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Narcotic {{dependence}} {{was established}} by continuous intravenous infusion of gradually increasing doses of morphine. Several days at the terminal concentration of morphine (100 mg/kg/day) was allowed prior to withdrawal. Morphine withdrawal body shakes were reliably observed upon the termination of continuous morphine infusion. The administration of morphine, methadone or _fentanyl, potent narcotic drugs, reliably abolished the occurrence of withdrawal body shakes 8 hours after the termination of morphine infusion. The narcotic antagonist naloxone or pentazocine had no {{significant effect on the}} rate of occurrence of withdrawal body shakes; however, there was a slight trend towards an increase in the frequency of this withdrawal index. A wide variety of neuroleptics were investigated for their ability to reduce withdrawal. The order of potency for reduction of withdrawal body shakes on a mg/kg basis for those neuroleptics tested was spiperone, benperidol, butaclarriol, loxapine, oxiperomide, haloperidol, spiramide, chlorpromazine, trifluoperazine, pimozide and pipamperone. The dopaminergic agonists amphetamine, apomorphine and L-IX 3 ̆ePA were also found to dose dependently reduce withdrawal• body shakes. Azaperone, a butyrophenone possessing high alpha noradrenergic blocking potency, reduces withdrawal body shakes in a dose related manner, while the alpha adrenergic blocker phenoxybenzamine and the beta adrenergic blocker propronalol failed to reduce withdrawal shakes to any significant extent. Dose dependent decreases in morphine withdrawal body shakes were produced by clonidine and desmethylimipramine, adrenergic agonists. Reserpine and alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine also reduced withdrawal shakes, but the effect was dose dependent for only reserpine. The serotoninergic agents fluoxetine, 5 -HTP and methysergide were without effect on the occurrence of withdrawal body shakes at the doses tested. A slight but non-significant increase in the rate of withdrawal shakes was observed after the administration of the anticholinergic drugs atropine, benztropine, <b>dexetimide</b> and scopolamine. Conversely, the cholinergic agonists physostigmine and pilocarpine, reduced withdrawal body shakes in a dose related fashion. Modification of gabaminergic system by the administration of bicuculline, depakene and picrotoxin had no significant effect. Chlordiazepoxide, flurazepam and pentobarbital, sedativehypnotic agents, did not produce dose dependent effects on the occurrence of withdrawal shakes. However, the highest dose of each sedative hypnotic employed did reduce withdrawal body shakes. The exact mechanism by which neuroleptics reduce withdrawal is not known. Manipulation of each of the transmitters effect by neuroleptics indicates that dopamine and acetylcholine are involved in mediating the reduction in withdrawal body shakes. The fact that the antiwithdrawal activity of certain neuroleptics is reversed by the narcotic antagonist naloxone implicates opiate receptor mechanisms. However, not all neuroleptics were antagonized by naloxone, suggesting that neuroleptics may be working at more than one site to reduce withdrawal. Thus neuroleptics may be reducing withdrawal body shakes by several different mechanisms. The data gathered from these studies suggest a role for cholinergic, dopaminergic and narcotic mechanisms in the antiwithdrawal activity of neuroleptic drugs...|$|E
