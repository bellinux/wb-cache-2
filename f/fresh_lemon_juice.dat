500|$|St Vincent's {{skills as}} an {{administrator}} and logistician {{came into play}} and he issued orders regarding the health and well being of the fleet. St Vincent wrote to Earl Spencer, commenting [...] "I have ever considered {{the care of the}} sick and wounded {{as one of the first}} duties of a Commander-in-chief, by sea or land." [...] Based on Doctor Baird's advice on cleanliness and hygiene the admiral brought in as many fresh vegetables as he could, along with vast quantities of <b>fresh</b> <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> to minimise illness, particularly scurvy. The effect was dramatic. The hospital ship that accompanied the fleet was sent home unneeded and in November 1800 when the fleet came to anchor in Torbay there were as few as sixteen hospital cases among the estimated twenty three thousand men. In a letter to Sir Evan Nepean, first secretary to the Admiralty, St Vincent described Baird as [...] "the most valuable man in the Navy not excepting the Board itself," [...] The oncoming winter of 1800–1801 forced the admiral to live ashore at Torre Abbey overlooking Torbay. Vice-Admiral Sir Henry Harvey took over operational command of the fleet in St Vincent's absence.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, {{pickling}} was {{an affordable}} and practical method of preserving lemons for use long after their season {{and far away}} from where they are grown.

50|$|In Afghan cuisine, the mantu {{are filled}} with beef or lamb mixed with minced onions and spices, steamed and then topped with a very typical sauce (seer moss, lit. ‘garlic yoghurt’) of yoghurt, dried or <b>fresh</b> mint, <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> and minced or pressed garlic. The mantu are also {{typically}} topped with a very small amount of tomato-based sauce which can include split peas, red kidney beans and/or some sautéed ground meat. The amount of yoghurt sauce is typically {{much greater than the}} tomato sauce; the tomato sauce is meant to be dotted on top - not covering the dish. Chutney, a spicy green or red pepper condiment sauce, may be sprinkled on top. Many Afghans also like to serve mantu with a carrot qorma or stew, instead of a tomato-based sauce.|$|R

40|$|This paper reviews {{historical}} aspects regarding {{medical knowledge}} on scurvy vitamin C deficiency, and its etiological factors. This disease used to affect naval-crews on long lasting sea voyages, soldiers {{during times of}} war and the poor. Although efficient therapy of scurvy (<b>fresh</b> vegetables, <b>lemon</b> <b>juice)</b> was known in the mid- 18 th century, its etiology was not known. It was believed to be caused by the cold, moist winds, unhealthy evaporations malnutrition and it was called "alkaline disease". It was established that acid substances like <b>lemon</b> <b>juice,</b> had beneficial effects on the disease However, it was soon generally accepted that it was caused by deficient diet. In 1830, Dr. John Elliotson, Professor of Medicine at London University supported this opinion. In 1928, Albert Szent Gyordyi, professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Szeged and Budapest Universities, isolated vitamin C from green pepper, vegetable proved to be rich with vitamin C. Due to this discovery, and some discoveries regarding biological processes, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology in 1937 Back in 1864, a military doctor in Belgrade, Dr. Maksim Nikolić-Miškovićev from Sremski Karlovci, wrote to Ministry of Defence of the Serbian Principality. He informed the authorities about a successful, quick and cheap cure for scurvy - pepper juice. A medical board headed by Dr. Vladan Đorđević was formed to evaluate his discovery. Dr. Nikolić-Miškovićev was underestimated and laughed at, and his discovery was completely forgotten The aim of this paper was to correct injustice done to Dr. Maksim Nikolić-Miškovićev...|$|R

However, in the later work which {{led up to the}} isolation of vitamin C as the antiscorbutic factor in 1932-33, Holst and Frølich's guinea pig model of scurvy proved to be the key biological assay which allowed identification of the chemical substance (hexuronic acid, later called ascorbic acid) which was ascorbutic vitamin.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out {{to find out the}} {{antimicrobial}} activity and phytochemical study of citrus fruit <b>juices</b> viz. <b>Lemon</b> (Citrus limon) and Orange (Citrus ourantium) against medically important selected enteric pathogens. As microorganisms are becoming resistant to present day antibiotics, our study focuses on antimicrobial activity and phytochemical study of Citrus fruit juices against selected enteric pathogens. Biological active compounds present in the medicinal important fruit juices have always been of great interest to scientist. These compounds, not only play an important physiological and etiological role, but are also of commercial interest because of their multitude application in the food and pharmaceutical industries. In the present study, the Lemon and Orange fruit juices were subjected to screening against enteric pathogens, E. coli, Salmonella paratyphy B, and Shigella sonnei. Antimicrobial analysis was done by using agar well diffusion method against selected enteric bacteria. The MIC values were determined by using U. V. Spectrophotometer. The <b>fresh</b> crude <b>Lemon</b> fruit <b>juice</b> produced the highest antimicrobial activity against Salmonella para.

The Minimum inhibitory concentration observed at 25 % conc. of <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> against Salmonella paratyphy B, and Shigella sonnei and 25 % concentration of orange juice against Shigella sonnei.

40|$|Using an unclad {{multimode}} Ge-Te-Se based {{chalcogenide glass}} fibre, simple design robust fibre evanescent wave spectroscopic (FEWS) sensor is demonstrated. Methodologies adopted for material development and fibre drawing {{are discussed in}} the following steps: purification of raw materials for high spectral purity, fabrication of glass and fibre preform leading to fibre drawing. The fabricated fibre has a minimum loss of 1. 4 dB/m at 4. 2 mu m, and less than 3 dB/m between 1. 5 and 6. 3 mu m. The feasibility of using such a fibre for evanescent wave spectroscopic sensing has been verified by using the finite-element (FE) computation technique. Supported optical modes as well as corresponding penetration depths of evanescent fields from different modes are discussed. Based on the FE computation, a FEWS sensor consisting of a 40 cm Ge-Te-Se fibre, coupled with a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer and a liquid nitrogen cooled mercury-cadmium-tellurium (MCT) detector, is demonstrated. The active length along this fibre employed for sensing is 3 cm. Based on FEWS design, the fabricated fibre sensor was used for the analysis of chemicals, namely the acetone, ethanol, methanol, tocopherol (vitamin E), ascorbic acid (vitamin C), <b>fresh</b> orange and <b>lemon</b> <b>juice.</b> (C) 2014 Elsevier B.
