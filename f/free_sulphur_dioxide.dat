40|$|The wine {{spoilage}} yeast species Dekkera bruxellensis, after inoculation in red wines, displayed three survival patterns characterized by: i) initial {{lag phase}} followed by growth and sequential death; ii) initial death phase leading to reduced viable counts followed by growth and sequential death; and iii) death phase leading to complete loss of viability. These survival patterns were observed {{for the same}} strain in different dry red wine blends with 12 % (v/v) ethanol and pH 3. 50, {{in the absence of}} <b>free</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide.</b> For the same wine blend, these patterns also varied with the tested strain. Under laboratory conditions the addition of 150 mg/l of potassium metabisulphite (PMB) to dry red wine with 12 % (v/v) ethanol and pH 3. 50 reduced initial cell counts by more than 6 logarithmic cycles, inducing full death within less than 24 h. Winery trials showed that D. bruxellensis blooms were only prevented in the presence of about 40 mg/l of <b>free</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> in dry red wine, with 13. 8 % (v/v) ethanol and pH 3. 42, matured in oak barrels. These different amounts of PMB and sulphur dioxide corresponded to about 1 mg/l of molecular sulphur dioxide.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, a {{sequential}} injection system with spectrophotometric detection {{was developed for}} the determination of <b>free</b> and total <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> in wines. It {{was based on the}} formation of a coloured product from the reaction among SO 2, formaldehyde and pararosaniline. A gas diffusion unit (GDU) was incorporated into the manifold to prevent the wine matrix interference in the spectrophotometric measurement. An acid solution was added to the sample prior to its passage through the donor channel of the GDU to promote gaseous SO 2 formation. For the free SO 2 determination, the sample was directly aspirated into the holding coil; for the total SO 2 determination, the sample was processed after previous in-line hydrolysis of bound SO 2 with an alkali solution. Two second-order calibration curves were established, defining two concentration ranges: 2 – 40 mg l− 1 for the free SO 2 determination and 25 – 250 mg l− 1 for the total SO 2 determination. Relative standard deviations (n= 10) were lower than 1. 2 % for the determination of free SO 2 and lower than 2. 3 % for the determination of total SO 2. The sample frequency was about 16 h− 1. This methodology was applied to the determination of <b>free</b> and total <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> in 10 table wines and the results were statistically comparable with those furnished by the recommended procedure...|$|R

It is a fast and non-destructive analytical method that in association with chemometrics is becoming more frequently used technique. NIR spectra were measured and the relative density, alcohol content, dry extract, reducing sugars, pH, total acidity, volatile acidity, ash, <b>free</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> and total sulphur dioxide were determined. The range of NIRS used in this paper was 904 – 1699 nm (i. e. 11062 – 5886 cm− 1) because in this range vibrations of C–H, O–H, S–H and N–H bonds can mainly be observed. Using the basic principles of multivariate analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), was used to reduce the input matrix in order to look for significant relationships between the NIR spectra and the observed characteristics of wine Prošek. Chemometrics applied here resulted in further discrimination between samples. The main features of the spectra are absorption bands at 1580 and 1670 nm, which are related to the first overtone of the C–H stretch. Absorption bands around 908 nm, present the stretches related to the 3 rd C–H overtone and 2 nd overtone of the O–H stretch of H 2 O and ethanol. PC 1 and PC 2, the first two components, gave the highest level of classification (≈ 95 %) based on the grape used for wine production {{as well as on the}} added yeast. The potential of NIRS, as a non-destructive method, is screening of basic parameters that are usually determined during the winemaking and ageing of wine.

This suggests that this technique can be used {{as an alternative to the}} existing methods used in wine industry processing. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of HHP on aroma compounds and also sensory and quality properties of young white wine. HHP treatment did not influence physicochemical parameters, total phenols, and flavonoid contents of white wine; however, the results from analysis of wine indicate that there was a great variation in the concentration of <b>free</b> and total <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> (SO 2) values and antioxidant capacity of white wine after HHP application. The sensory attributes, such as taste, odour, and overall quality, were not affected by HHP processing at 300 [*]MPa. The chromatic characteristics changed slightly after applying HHP, but these changes could not be visually perceived because they were less than 5 %. The use of this technique has the potential to decrease the amount of SO 2 added to raw grapes thus maintaining the same properties found in untreated wine.

40|$|Sulphite {{is widely}} used in {{winemaking}} for its antimicrobial and antioxidant properties, although its toxic effect on human health is proven. For this reason strategies for reducing chemical preservatives in winemaking is strongly demanded. Wine yeasts can cope with SO 2 by different systems, such as acetaldehyde and S-amino acids production or SO 2 export. In this study a first screening of SO 2 resistance and on plate production of SO 2 and H 2 S have been performed for autochthonous strains, isolated in Veneto vineyards {{to be used as}} starter of fermentation in the production of Prosecco di Valdobbiadene DOCG and DOC Piave wines, compared to commercial strains. Then the oenological characteristics of 11 S. cerevisiae strains of have been evaluated. These strains are 4 autochthonous strains isolated during local selection projects in DOCG Conegliano - Valdobbiadene and DOC Piave areas, together with 6 commercial strains, which genome have been recently sequenced, and relative informations are available in the principal genomic databases, and the laboratory strain S 288 c, the first one that has been sequenced. Main technology and quality characters have been evaluated to determine the suitability of strains for winemaking process. In particular have been studied the production of ethanol and glycerol, the glucose consumption at 2 and 7 days, the production of hydrogen sulphide, acetaldehyde and sulphur dioxide and the resistance to various concentrations of <b>free</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> in synthetic must. Sulphite response in yeast has been investigated in order to elucidate factors that affect sulphite production during vinification. Moreover acetaldehyde, another compound produced by yeast, linked with sulphite metabolism or detoxification, has been analysed since it affects wine quality. Genetic characteristics identified after genome sequencing of 4 autochthonous strains (2 from Prosecco area and 2 from Raboso area), such as oenological SNPs, strain-specific genes and important translocations, have been analyzed in Real-time PCR for a large number of autochthonous strains. Then the behaviour towards sulphite of 4 wine yeasts has been investigated, and transcriptome analysis during fermentation has been performed by means of next generation sequencing. For all strains, fermentation rate was monitored together with sulphite production in synthetic must supplemented with different doses of SO 2 (0 mg/l and 25 mg/l). Finally, a selection of reference genes for Real-time PCR has been made, and a set of genes suitable for such conditions has been identified. Results point out the importance of verifying strain attitudes towards sulphite at different sulphite concentrations. This study tries to clarify the complex regulative mechanisms of sulphites during fermentation, thus giving new guidelines for critic control of these fermentation parameters in order to maximize effect of sulphite added thus limiting the dose employed during vinification...|$|E
40|$|Today?s {{wine market}} is {{becoming}} more and more saturated. At given conditions, the understanding of the consumer needs and preferences determines the success of a wine producer. The value of white and rosé wines appreciated by the consumers lies in their fruity and fresh character. Wine oxidation is one of the major wine failures. Recently, it has been reported that up to 48 % of the wines rated as faulty by judges in wine competitions exhibited off-flavours that can be linked to the erroneous management of oxygen. Wine exposure to oxygen is possible throughout the whole winemaking process and depends on process conditions and applied equipment. Oxygen can be dissolved in wine up to 8. 8 mg/L at normal conditions. After dissolution, oxygen concentration in liquid phase is normally decreasing to undetectable content due to chemical reactions of molecular oxygen with other wine constituents. Wine oxidation is a complex process. The effects may vary significantly influenced by numerous factors, including a type of wine, operation, oxygen amount chemical composition of wine, pH, storage temperature, light exposure, metal content and redox state of wine. Oxygen has a potential to support positively, and subsequently to ruin aroma and colour of wine. Most white wines are negatively affected by small amounts of dissolved oxygen provoking rapid aroma loss and oxidative browning, thus decreasing attractiveness for consumers, whereas in red wines microoxygenation may help to stabilise wine colour and remove reductive off-flavours. Up to now, most of the research on wine oxidation was focused on experiments in model solutions. Although these studies deliver valuable information about oxidation mechanisms, there was, however, limited data published on real wine experiments linking analytical data and sensory analysis. Consequently, the background of the present investigations was comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of the various factors influencing wine oxidation in real wine medium, and finally the development of innovative strategy for quality improvement and shelf-life extension of white wines. Comparison of different methods for O 2 and CO 2 measurement in wine The initial part of the present work was to determine a reliable quantification method for dissolved oxygen quantification in wine medium. Since dissolved carbon dioxide present in wine may influence the oxygen concentration, its amount should also be taken into account. Thus, development of dissolved carbon dioxide determination was of major importance for the further experiments described in this thesis. The main aim of the first study was to give a review of the oxygen and carbon dioxide measurement principles and to compare several instruments for carbon dioxide and oxygen measurement in wine available in the market. For carbon dioxide determination, CarboQC, Orbisphere 3658 and agitation cylinder were used. Oxygen measurements were conducted with PreSens, OxyQC and Orbisphere 3650. Sample bottles were prepared with concentrations in the range from 0 to 2200 mg/L for carbon dioxide and from 0 to 12 mg/L for oxygen, respectively, dissolved in white wine of Müller Thurgau variety. O 2 and CO 2 measurements with six instruments were sequentially conducted at 20 °C after 10 minutes shaking of trial bottles. Subsequently calculated concentrations of oxygen and carbon dioxide were used for correlation regression tests. From the data obtained for CO 2, three investigated instruments showed good repeatable measurement results (R 2 = 98 %) in the range from 0 to 1500 mg/L. However, in the wine samples oversaturated with CO 2 (> 1500 mg/L at 20 °C) CarboQC and Orbisphere 3658 showed significantly higher precision (R 2 = 99 %), compared to the agitation cylinder, due to carbon dioxide losses during filling of the cylinder. As for oxygen data, results obtained with each of the measurement devices (PreSens, OxyQC and Orbisphere 3650) demonstrated good correlation with the initial oxygen amount in wine samples (R 2 = 98 %) in the whole monitored range of dissolved oxygen concentrations. However, due to the flexibility of PreSens mini-sensor application inside the bottle and noninvasive measurement, this technique was found to be more advantageous, compared to the other two. Additionally, it allowed not only determination of dissolved oxygen, but also of the gaseous oxygen concentration in a bottle headspace. For these reasons, the PreSens device was chosen for further experiments. Effect of Headspace Volume and Iron and Copper Addition on Oxidation Processes in Model Solution and Riesling Wine: Chemical and Sensory Changes Since previous studies in model solutions published by other authors clearly showed the key role of iron and copper in oxidation reactions in wine, the main aim of this part of the thesis was to compare the effects of oxygen and iron and copper additions on oxygen consumption rate, sulphur dioxide and colour of bottled model solution and actual wine with similar properties. Model solution was prepared of deionised water, glycerol, (+) -tartaric acid, ethanol, gallic acid and potassium metabisulfite to reach a <b>free</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> concentration of 50 mg/L. 200 L Riesling wine (vintage 2010) was prepared using standard winemaking techniques and equipment, and was subsequently treated with potassium ferrocyanide to eliminate iron and copper. Model solution and Riesling wine were bottled in 500 mL bottles with and without small additions of iron (0. 1 mg/L) and copper (0. 05 mg/L). Oxygen concentration in bottles was adjusted using various headspace volumes (0, 50 and 100 mL for model solution, and 0, 20 and 40 mL for Riesling, respectively) full of ambient air. Iron and copper concentration, total consumed oxygen, sulphur dioxide, browning rate (E 420) were monitored. Additionally, sensory analysis of bottled Riesling wines (triangle tests and descriptive analysis) was conducted after 90 and 240 days of storage. The results revealed major differences between model solution and real wine. In model solution the headspace volume and the metal addition contributed to significant changes in total consumed oxygen, colour, and <b>free</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide.</b> The metal addition increased the rate of the molecular oxygen consumption and resulted in elevated consumption of free SO 2. Enhanced colour was observed in all wines, where iron was added. The experiment with Riesling wine with similar parameters showed strong influence of the headspace volume. The rate of oxidative browning and oxygen consumption rate strongly correlated with the headspace volume at the bottling. In contrast to model solution experiment, addition of small concentrations of iron and copper did not contribute to the colour and oxygen consumption rate of Riesling wine. Sensory analysis showed that the wines bottled with 0, 20 mL and 40 mL HS volume became significantly different already after three months of storage at 15 °C, which was proved by the triangle tests. Descriptive analysis after six and nine months of storage confirmed negative influence of headspace volume, thus proving the significance of oxygen ingress at bottling on wine quality. Moreover, traces of metals in Riesling wines even in the wines with no iron and copper addition were sufficient to initialise oxidation processes. However, since small iron and copper additions had significant impact on model solution, further studies with Riesling wine needed to be conducted. The Impact of Headspace Oxygen and Copper and Iron Addition on Oxygen Consumption Rate, Sulphur Dioxide Loss, Colour and Sensory Properties of Riesling Wine For further investigation of the impact of iron and copper on white wine oxidation, Riesling wine was bottled with the addition of 1 mg/L of iron and 0. 5 mg/L of copper, which correspond to average iron and copper concentrations in wines of Baden-Württemberg. Oxygen concentrations were determined, as previously reported, by the headspace volume in the bottle (0 mL, 10 mL and 20 mL) full with ambient air. In contrast to the previous experiment, addition of 1 mg/L of iron and 0. 5 mg/L of copper had significant influence on the oxygen consumption rate, on the loss of free SO 2 during storage, and on the sensory changes in wine. Addition of iron and copper significantly catalysed the oxygen consumption. <b>Free</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> loss was found to be proportional to the total consumed oxygen after bottling. Moreover, in all wines with iron and copper addition <b>free</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> decay was significantly elevated compared to wines with no iron and copper addition. Although colour changes were not observed in wines after 90 days of storage, significant sensory changes were detected. Both oxygen and iron and copper addition made an impact on sensory evaluation of wines. At low oxygen concentration (0 mL headspace) metal addition had positive effect resulting in elimination reduced aromas. In contrast, for 10 mL and 20 mL headspace, wines with iron and copper addition showed lower scores in fruity, citrus, tropical aromas, and elevated scores in untypical aging and had pronounced oxidised character. The results of the study indicate that, in the case of Riesling wine, excessive oxygen exposure due to oxygen present in the headspace of the bottle should be avoided. Moreover, iron and copper concentration also seems to make significant impact on oxygen and SO 2 consumption rates and on sensory perception of wines. These findings suggest that iron and copper concentrations should also be taken into account, when oxygen management strategy is defined. Effect of Headspace Volume, Ascorbic Acid and Sulphur Dioxide on Composition and Sensory Profile of Riesling Wine In the last part of the present work the effects of different oxygen and free SO 2 levels, and ascorbic acid addition on the development of white wine were investigated. Riesling wine was bottled in 500 mL bottles with four different headspace volumes (0 mL, 10 mL, 20 mL, 30 mL), two levels of free SO 2 (50 mg/L and 70 mg/L), and with and without ascorbic acid (250 mg/L) addition. Dissolved oxygen and the oxygen in headspace were measured in the resulting 17 wines. Free and total SO 2 concentrations, ascorbic acid concentration, colour, redox potential, and antioxidative capacity were measured regularly in wine samples. After six months of storage, the wines were evaluated using sensory descriptive analysis. It was again proved that wine exposure to oxygen at bottling plays a key role in white wine development during storage. High oxygen ingress may greatly influence the redox state of wine and affect the important quality parameters including colour, free and total SO 2, and the overall sensory quality of wine. Free and total sulphur dioxide loss and the decline in ascorbic acid could be linked to the total consumed oxygen content. It was observed that in the presence of ascorbic acid less sulphite was consumed. Ascorbic acid addition also contributed to the fruity and fresh character of the bottled wines, which indicates its strong antioxidant. However, when combined with high oxygen concentration, ascorbic acid addition promoted enhanced white wine browning. This was scavenged in the wines with higher free SO 2 concentrations. Based on the data shown, careful control of the oxygen ingress during bottling is crucial for white wine quality. Ascorbic acid addition seems to have positive sensory effects on the development of wines during the post-bottling period. However, the possible wine browning, associated with ascorbic acid, should be taken into account. On the contrary, sulphur dioxide, in case of the Riesling wine studied, seems to be less effective to prevent negative sensory effects in wines due to excessive exposure to oxygen, but may simultaneously decrease oxidative browning in wines with ascorbic acid addition. In summary, low oxygen ingress at bottling combined with low iron and copper concentrations, moderate additions of ascorbic acid and sulphur dioxide seem to be a good oxygen management strategy and offer a good potential to improve quality and extent the shelf-life of white wines. Der Weltweinmarkt und speziell der europäische Weinmarkt wird heute oft als übersättigt angesehen. Der Erfolg einzelner Weinproduzenten hängt daher vom Verständnis und der Adaption an die Bedürfnisse der Verbraucher ab. Bei Weiß- und Roséweinen schätzen Verbraucher derzeit besonders einen fruchtigen, frischen Charakter. Oxidative Noten sind unerwünscht. Dennoch gehören sie zu den häufigsten Weinfehlern. Aus Weinwettbewerben wurde berichtet, dass bis zu 48 % der fehlerhaften Weine von den Prüfern wegen Oxidationsnoten beanstandet wurden. Sauerstoff kann vom Wein während des ganzen Weinbereitungsprozesses aufgenommen werden. Die Sauerstoffaufnahme hängt im Wesentlichen von den Prozessen und der verwendeten technologischen Ausstattung ab. Unter normalen Bedingungen kann Sauerstoff bis zu 8. 8 mg/L im Wein gelöst werden. Gelöster Sauerstoff in Wein wird in der Regel durch chemische Reaktionen von molekularem Sauerstoff mit Weininhaltsstoffen bis unter die Nachweisgrenze verringert. Die vielfältigen Reaktionen der Weinoxidation sind sehr komplexe Prozesse. Ihre Auswirkungen variieren erheblich. Beeinflussende Faktoren sind Weintyp, Weinbehandlung, Sauerstoffmenge, chemische Zusammensetzung des Weines, pH-Wert, Lagertemperatur, Belichtung, Metallgehalt und Redox-Zustand des Weines. Die Wirkung von Sauerstoff ist äußerst komplex, die Weinfarbe und das Aroma kann verbessert oder gar ruiniert werden. Weißweine werden durch Sauerstoff häufig negativ verändert. Der Sauerstoff führt hier zu schnellem Aromaverlust bis hin zu oxidativer Bräunung. Gerade dies wird vom Verbraucher oft negativ bewertet. Bei Rotweinen hingegen kann Sauerstoff gezielt eingesetzt werden um die Farbe zu stabilisieren oder reduktive Aromen zu entfernen. Die Forschung über Weinoxidation konzentriert sich derzeit auf Experimente in Modell-Lösungen. Diese Studien geben wertvolle Informationen über Mechanismen und Hintergründe der Oxidation. Jedoch befassen sich derzeit nur wenige Experimente mit echtem Wein. Bei echten Weinen bietet sich die Möglichkeit analytische und sensorische Daten miteinander zu verknüpfen. Wichtiger Punkt der vorliegenden Arbeit ist die umfassende Bewertung verschiedener Einflußfaktoren auf die Weinalterung. Aus den Ergebnissen wurde eine Strategie für die Verbesserung der Qualität und einer Verlängerung der Haltbarkeit von Weißweinen entwickelt. Methodenvergleich zur O 2 -und CO 2 - Bestimmung im Wein Der erste Teil der vorliegenden Arbeit besteht in der Bestimmung von zuverlässigen Methoden zur Quantifizierung des gelösten Sauerstoffs im Wein. Da das gelöste Kohlendioxid im Wein die Sauerstoffkonzentration beeinflussen kann, wurde die CO 2 -Menge ebenfalls berücksichtigt. Folglich war die Entwicklung einer Methode zur Kohlendioxid-Bestimmung auch von großer Bedeutung für die weiteren Versuche, die in dieser Arbeit beschrieben sind. Das Hauptziel der ersten Studie war es, einen Überblick zu aktuellen Sauerstoff- und Kohlendioxid-Messmethoden zu geben sowie verschiedene auf dem Markt verfügbare Instrumente für Kohlendioxid- und Sauerstoff-Messung in Wein zu vergleichen. Sauerstoff-Messungen wurden mit PreSens, OxyQC und Orbisphere 3650 durchgeführt. Zur Kohlendioxid-Bestimmung wurden CarboQC, Orbisphere 3658 und Schüttelzylinder verwendet. Probenflaschen wurden mit Konzentrationen im Bereich von 0 bis 2200 mg/L für Kohlendioxid und von 0 bis 12 mg/L für Sauerstoff abgefüllt. O 2 - und CO 2 - Messungen erfolgten mit den sechs Instrumenten nacheinander bei 20 °C, nachdem die Flaschen für 10 Minuten geschüttelt wurden. Die anschließend berechneten Konzentrationen an Sauerstoff und Kohlendioxid wurden für die Erstellung von Korrelationen und Regression-Tests verwendet. Die drei untersuchten Instrumente für CO 2 -Bestimmung zeigten reproduzierbare Messergebnisse (R 2 = 98 %) im Bereich von 0 bis 1500 mg/L. Doch in den Weinproben bei dem 20 °C übersättigten Bereich (> 1500 mg/L) zeigten CarboQC und Orbisphere 3658 signifikant höhere Präzision (R 2 = 99 %) im Vergleich zum Schüttelzylinder. Dies ist logisch, da während der Befüllung des Zylinders das Kohlendioxid verloren geht. Die Ergebnisse der Sauerstoff-Messungen deuteten darauf hin, dass PreSens, sowie auch OxyQC und Orbisphere 3650 eine im gesamten überwachten Bereich der Sauerstoffkonzentrationen verlässliche und kongruente Werte liefern. Aufgrund der Flexibilität der Minisensoren, die direkt in die Flasche eingeklebt werden können, erwies sich die nicht-invasive O 2 -Messung mittels PreSens als vorteilhaft. Darüber hinaus erlaubt diese Technik nicht nur die Bestimmung vom gelöstem Sauerstoff, sondern auch die Messung vom gasförmigen Sauerstoff im Kopfraum. Aus diesen Gründen wurde das PreSens-Gerät für weitere Experimente ausgewählt. Einfluss vom Kopfraumvolumen und Eisen- und Kupfer-Zugabe auf Oxidation in Modell-Lösung und Riesling Wein: chemische und sensorische Veränderungen In früheren veröffentlichten Studien in Modell-Lösungen wurde die wichtige Rolle von Eisen und Kupfer in Oxidationsreaktionen in Wein deutlich gezeigt. Im zweiten Teil der vorliegenden Arbeit wurden die Wirkungen von unterschiedlichen Sauerstoff-Mengen bei der Abfüllung untersucht. Des Weiteren wurde der Einfluss von Eisen- und Kupfer-Zusätzen auf die Sauerstoffverbrauchsrate, Schwefeldioxid und Farbe in Modell-Lösung und Riesling Wein geprüft. Die Modell-Lösung wurde aus hochreinem Wasser, Glycerin, (+) -Weinsäure, Ethanol, Gallussäure und Kaliummetabisulfit zusammengestellt, außerdem wurde die SO 2 -Konzentration auf 50 mg/L eingestellt. 200 L Riesling (Jahrgang 2010) wurde unter Verwendung von Standard-Techniken der Weinbereitung produziert und anschließend mit Kaliumhexacyanoferrat behandelt, um die Metalle bzw. Eisen und Kupfer zu entfernen. Modell-Lösung und Riesling wurden in 500 -mL Flaschen mit und ohne Zusatz von Eisen (0. 1 mg/L) und Kupfer (0. 05 mg/L) abgefüllt. Die Sauerstoffkonzentration in Flaschen wurde mit Luft im Kopfraum (0, 50 und 100 mL für Modell-Lösung und 0, 20 und 40 mL für Riesling) eingestellt. Die Eisen- und Kupferkonzentrationen, Gesamtmenge an verbrauchtem Sauerstoff, Schwefeldioxid, Absorption (E 420) wurden während der Lagerzeit beobachtet. Zusätzlich wurde die sensorische Bewertung von Riesling Weinen mittels Dreieckstests und deskriptiver Analyse nach 90 und 240 Tagen Lagerung durchgeführt. Die Ergebnisse zeigten große Unterschiede zwischen der Modell-Lösung und dem Riesling Wein. In der Modell-Lösung hatte das Kopfraumvolumen und der Metall-Zusatz dazu beigetragen, dass wesentliche Änderungen in Sauerstoffverbrauchsrate, Farbe und freiem Schwefeldioxid entstanden. Der Eisen- und Kupfer-Zusatz erhöhte die Geschwindigkeit des Sauerstoff-Verbrauchs und führte zu erhöhtem Verbrauch der freien SO 2. Die intensive Farbentwicklung wurde in allen Weinen mit Eisen-Zusatz festgestellt. Das Experiment mit Riesling mit vergleichbaren Parametern zeigte einen starken Einfluss des Kopfraumvolumens. Die Sauerstoffverbrauchsrate und die oxidative Bräunung korrelierten stark mit dem Kopfraumvolumen. Im Gegensatz zum Modell-Lösung-Experiment hatte die Zugabe von geringen Mengen an Eisen und Kupfer keinen Einfluss auf die Farbe und den Sauerstoffverbrauch im Riesling Wein. Sensorische Unterschiede zwischen den Weinen mit 0, 20 und 40 mL Kopfraum wurden bereits nach drei Monaten Lagerung bei 15 °C durch die Dreieckstests nachgewiesen. Die deskriptive sensorische Analyse nach sechs und neun Monaten Lagerung bestätigte den negativen Einfluss von großem Kopfraumvolumen. Dies beweist die große Bedeutung der Sauerstoffaufnahme bei der Abfüllung auf die Weinqualität. Außerdem waren Metallmengen im Riesling Wein, auch in den Varianten ohne Eisen- und Kupferzusatz ausreichend, die Oxidationsprozesse zu initialisieren. Da die geringen Eisen- und Kupferzugaben eine erhebliche Wirkung in der Modell-Lösung und nicht im Wein hatten, waren weitere Studien mit größeren Mengen an Eisen und Kupfer in Riesling Wein erforderlich. Einfluss von Sauerstoff im Kopfraum, Eisen- und Kupferzusatz auf Sauerstoffverbrauchsrate, Schwefeldioxidverlust, Farbe und sensorische Eigenschaften von Riesling Wein Um die Wirkung von Eisen und Kupfer weiter auf Weißweinoxidation zu untersuchen, wurde Riesling Wein mit/ohne Zugabe von 1 mg/L Eisen und 0. 5 mg/L Kupfer abgefüllt. Dies entspricht den durchschnittlichen Eisen- und Kupfer-Konzentrationen in Weinen aus Baden-Württemberg. Die Sauerstoffmengen wurden mit verschiedenen Kopfraumvolumen in den Flaschen (0, 10 und 20 mL) bestimmt. Im Gegensatz zum vorangegangenen Versuch, hatte die Zugabe von 1 mg/L Eisen und 0. 5 mg/L Kupfer einen signifikanten Einfluss auf den Sauerstoffverbrauch, Verlust von freiem SO 2 während der Lagerung und auf die sensorischen Eigenschaften im Wein. Der Eisen- und Kupfer-Zusatz katalysierte deutlich den Sauerstoffverbrauch. Der Schwefeldioxid-Verlust war proportional zur Gesamtmenge an verbrauchtem Sauerstoff. Zusätzlich wurde der SO 2 -Abbau in allen Varianten mit Eisen und Kupfer im Vergleich zu den Varianten ohne Eisen- und Kupferzugabe signifikant erhöht. Obwohl die Farbänderungen nach 90 Tagen Lagerung nicht festgestellt werden konnten, waren die erheblichen sensorischen Veränderungen bereits erkennbar. Der Sauerstoff, wie auch der Eisen- und Kupferzusatz hatten Einfluss auf die sensorische Bewertung der Weine. Bei niedrigen Sauerstoffkonzentration (0 mL Kopfraum) hatten Metalle durch die Eliminierung von reduzierten Aromen eine positive Wirkung. Die Weine mit 10 und 20 mL Kopfraum und zugesetztem Eisen und Kupfer zeigten geringere Ausprägungen in Attributen wie Frucht, Citrus, tropischen Aromen und erhöhte Werte in UTA und hatten einen deutlichen oxidierten Charakter.

40|$|A {{sensitive}} and fast responding electrochemical sensor is described for {{the determination of}} <b>free</b> and total <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> in wines and grape juices which prevents interferences coming from ethanol and other natural components. It consists of a cell provided with a porous gold working electrode supported on one face of an ion-exchange membrane, acting as a solid polymer electrolyte (SPE), which allows gaseous electroactive analytes to be detected. This sensor {{was used as an}} amperometric detector for a flow injection system in which controlled volumes of headspace equilibrated with samples were injected. This approach was adopted to make also possible the determination of total SO(2), avoiding drawbacks caused by the high relative humidity generated by the sample heating resulting from the neutralization reaction of excess NaOH, whose addition was required to release <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> from its combined forms. Factors affecting the detection process were examined and optimised. Under the identified optimal conditions, SO(2) detection resulted in sharp peaks which allowed to infer detection limits for a signal-to-noise ratio of 3, referred to liquid samples. of 0. 04 and 0. 02 mg L(- 1) for free and total SO(2) which were determined at 20 and 35 degrees C. respectively. Moreover, the responses were found to be characterized by good repeatability (+/- 2 % and +/- 4 %, respectively) and linear dependence on the SO(2) concentration over a wide range (0. 2 - 500 mg L(- 1) for both free and total SO(2)). Finally, the long-term stability of the sensor turned out to be totally satisfactory in that responses changed of +/- 9 % alone even after long periods of continuous use.

40|$|Aims: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of free molecular and bound forms of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> and oxygen on the viability and culturability of a selected strain of Acetobacter pasteurianus and a selected strain of Brettanomyces bruxellensis in wine. Methods and Results: Acetic acid bacteria and Brettanomyces/Dekkera yeasts associated with wine spoilage were isolated from bottled commercial red wines. One bacterium, A. pasteurianus strain A 8, and one yeast, B. bruxellensis strain B 3 a, were selected for further study. The resistance to <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> and the effect of oxygen addition on these two selected strains were determined by using plating and epifluorescence techniques for monitoring cell viability in wine. Acetobacter pasteurianus A 8 was more resistant to <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> than B. bruxellensis B 3 a, with the latter being rapidly affected by a short exposure time to free molecular form of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide.</b> As expected, neither of these microbial strains was affected by the bound form of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide.</b> The addition of oxygen negated the difference observed between plate and epifluorescence counts for A. pasteurianus A 8 during storage, while it stimulated growth of B. bruxellensis B 3 a. Conclusions: Acetobacter pasteurianus A 8 can survive under anaerobic conditions in wine in the presence of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide.</b> Brettanomyces bruxellensis B 3 a is more sensitive to <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> than A. pasteurianus A 8, but can grow in the presence of oxygen. Care should be taken to exclude oxygen from contact with wine when it is being transferred or moved. Significance and Impact of the Study: Wine spoilage can be avoided by preventing growth of undesirable acetic acid bacteria and Brettanomyces/Dekkera yeasts through the effective use of <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> and the management of oxygen throughout the winemaking process. © 2005 The Society for Applied Microbiology.

40|$|Treixadura {{wines from}} the 1998 vintage were {{obtained}} from traditional vinification in a winery. After alcoholic fermentation, the wine was subjected to ageing in oak barrels for three months. One part of the wine is placed in barrels of American oak and the other part in French oak (Allier oak). Wine stored simultaneously in a stainless steel tank {{was used as a}} control. Chemical composition and volatile compounds of wines were analysed. There were no appreciable differences in alcohol and tartaric acid among the wines stored under different conditions, but differences were observed in pH, total and volatile acidity, reducing sugars, malic and lactic acids. Ageing in oak barrels resulted in an increase in volatile acidity and Folin–Ciocalteu index, and a decrease of <b>free</b> and total <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide.</b> Various monoterpenes, norisoprenoids, hexenols, sulphurs, volatile phenols, acetals and lactones increase their content notably when aged in barrels of both American and French oak. On the other hand, some acetates, ethyl esters and fatty acids were present in higher concentrations in the wine stored in stainless steel tank. Sensory results indicated that the wine aged in French (Allier) oak was better scored than when aged in American oak, as it provided subtle and delicate nuances of wood, which did not mask the fruity aroma of the Treixadura wine but contributed to its aromatic complexity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Intact chloroplasts {{isolated}} from <b>sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> fumigated Hardwickia binata leaves showed inhibition of PS II electron transport activity without any {{significant effect on}} photosystem I. <b>Sulphur</b> <b>dioxide</b> exposed leaves accumulated more hydrogen peroxide than those from non-fumigated plants and this was caused by increase in superoxide radical production.
