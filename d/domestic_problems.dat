Shortly before his death, MacArthur gave similar advice to President Lyndon B. Johnson.|$|E
5|$|The King and {{parliament}} {{met again}} in February 1310, {{and the proposed}} discussions of Scottish policy were replaced by debate of <b>domestic</b> <b>problems.</b> Edward was petitioned to abandon Gaveston as his counsellor and instead adopt the advice of 21 elected barons, termed Ordainers, who would carry out a widespread reform of both {{the government and the}} royal household. Under huge pressure, Edward agreed to the proposal and the Ordainers were elected, broadly evenly split between reformers and conservatives. While the Ordainers began their plans for reform, Edward and Gaveston took a new army of around 4,700 men to Scotland, where the military situation had continued to deteriorate. Robert the Bruce declined to give battle and the campaign progressed ineffectually over the winter until supplies and money ran out in 1311, forcing Edward to return south.|$|E

25|$|The {{second and}} more serious problem, {{unacknowledged}} by bank management, the financial regulator and the Irish government, is solvency. The question concerning solvency has arisen due to <b>domestic</b> <b>problems</b> in the crashing Irish property market. AIB, like most Irish financial institutions, has substantial exposure to property developers in their loan portfolio. These property developers are currently suffering from gross over-supply of property, much still unsold, while demand has evaporated. The massive immigration from Eastern Europe which had propped up demand has now reversed due to rapidly rising unemployment in Ireland. Irish property developers own speculated billions of euros of overvalued land parcels such as urban brownfield and greenfield sites, and also agricultural land {{at an average}} value of €23,600 per acre (US$32,000 per acre or €60,000 per hectare) which is several multiples above the value of equivalent land in other European countries.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, Italian naval strategists {{eyed the}} port of Vlorë (Valona in Italian) and the island of Sazan (Saseno) at the {{entrance}} to the Bay of Vlorë. The port would give Italy control of the entrance to the Adriatic Sea. Also, Albania could provide Italy with a beachhead in the Balkans. Before World War I Italy and Austria-Hungary had been instrumental in the creation of an independent Albanian state. At the outbreak of war in 1915, Italy seized the chance to occupy the southern half of Albania, to prevent the Austro-Hungarians from capturing. That success did not last long, as post-war <b>domestic</b> <b>problems,</b> defeat in the Vlora War, and pressure from US President Woodrow Wilson, forced Italy to pull out in 1920. But Italy retained the island of Saseno, in front of Valona, that was annexed to the Province of Zara in Italian Dalmatia.|$|E
25|$|Taft's {{greatest}} prominence {{during his}} first term came not from his fight against the New Deal but rather from his vigorous opposition to US involvement in the Second World War. A staunch non-interventionist, Taft believed that America should avoid any involvement in European or Asian wars and concentrate instead on solving its <b>domestic</b> <b>problems.</b> He believed that a strong military, combined with the natural geographic protection of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, would be adequate to protect America even if Germany overran all of Europe. Between the outbreak of war in September, 1939 and the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 Taft opposed nearly all attempts to aid countries fighting Germany. That brought him strong criticism from many liberal Republicans, such as Wendell Willkie, who felt that America could best protect itself by supporting the British and their allies. Although Taft fully supported the American war effort after Pearl Harbor, he continued to harbor a deep suspicion of American involvement in postwar military alliances, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Taft was the representative to speak in opposition to Japanese-American internment.|$|E

25|$|The Portuguese Economy {{has been}} steady, {{expanding}} continuously since {{the third quarter}} of 2014, with a yearly GDP growth of 1.5% registered {{in the second quarter of}} 2015. The economy growth has been accompanied by a continuous fall in the unemployment rate (11.9% in the second quarter of 2015, compared with 13.9% registered in the end of 2014). The Government budget deficit has also been reduced from the 11.2% of GDP in 2010 to 4.8% in 2014. These rates mark an inversion from the negative trends caused by the impact of the Financial Crisis of 2008 in the Portuguese Economy, that made it to shrink for three consecutives years (2011, 2012 and 2013), accompanied by a high increase of the unemployment rate (that achieved a record of 17.7% in the early 2013). The crisis has caused a wide range of <b>domestic</b> <b>problems</b> that are specifically related to the levels of public deficit, as well as the excessive debt levels, in the economy, culminating in the confirmation from Portugal to a €78 billion financial bailout from the EU in April 2011, following similar decisions from Greece and Ireland. The government that assumed office in June 2011 had to face tough choices in regard to its attempts to stimulate the economy while at the same time seeking to maintain its public deficit around the EU average.|$|E

500|$|In {{the postwar}} period, Hand shared {{the dismay of}} his compatriots about Stalinism and {{the onset of the}} Cold War. At the same time, he was {{sensitive}} to the <b>domestic</b> <b>problems</b> created by what he saw as a hysterical fear of international Communism. Already in 1947, he noted that [...] "the frantic witch hunters are given free rein to set up a sort of Inquisition, detecting heresy wherever non-conformity appears". Hand was distressed by the crusade against domestic subversion that became part of American public life after the war. He particularly despised the anti-Communist campaign of Senator Joseph McCarthy that began in 1950 and which became known as McCarthyism. Though Hand expressed his horror of McCarthyism privately, he hesitated to do so publicly because cases arising from it were likely to come before his court.|$|E
