2500|$|An {{experienced}} {{user can}} create realistic and accurate families ranging from furniture to lighting fixtures, {{as well as}} import existing models from other programs. Revit families can be created as parametric models with dimensions and properties. This lets users modify a given component by changing predefined parameters such as height, width or number {{in the case of}} an array. In this way a family defines a geometry which is controlled by parameters, each combination of parameters can be saved as a type, and each occurrence (instance in Revit) of a type can also contain further variations. [...] For example, a swing door may be a Family. It may have types describing different sizes, and the actual building model will have instances of those types placed in walls where instance-based parameters could specify the <b>door</b> <b>hardware</b> uniquely for each occurrence of the door.|$|E
