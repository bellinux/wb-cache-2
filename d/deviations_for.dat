25|$|In {{the sample}} {{standard}} deviation formula, for this example, the numerator {{is the sum}} of the squared deviation of each individual animal's metabolic rate from the mean metabolic rate. The table below shows the calculation of this sum of squared <b>deviations</b> <b>for</b> the female fulmars. For females, the sum of squared deviations is 886047.09, as shown in the table.|$|E
25|$|As {{shown in}} diagram at right, this {{phenomenon}} has relatively small effect if {{the standard deviation}} (as compared to the mean) is relatively small, as it makes the log-normal distribution appear similar to an arithmetical normal distribution. Thus, the arithmetical normal distribution may be more appropriate to use with small standard <b>deviations</b> <b>for</b> convenience, and the log-normal distribution with large standard deviations.|$|E
25|$|User {{equivalent}} range errors (UERE) {{are shown}} in the table. There is also a numerical error with an estimated value, , of about 1 meter. The standard <b>deviations,</b> , <b>for</b> the coarse/acquisition (C/A) and precise codes are also shown in the table. These standard deviations are computed by taking the square root of {{the sum of the}} squares of the individual components (i.e., RSS for root sum squares). To get the standard deviation of receiver position estimate, these range errors must be multiplied by the appropriate dilution of precision terms and then RSS'ed with the numerical error. Electronics errors are one of several accuracy-degrading effects outlined in the table above. When taken together, autonomous civilian GPS horizontal position fixes are typically accurate to about 15 meters (50ft). These effects also reduce the more precise P(Y) code's accuracy. However, the advancement of technology means that in the present, civilian GPS fixes under {{a clear view of the}} sky are on average accurate to about 5 meters (16ft) horizontally.|$|E

25|$|The {{technical}} {{possibilities of}} the western Greeks, which had progressed beyond those in the motherland, permitted many <b>deviations.</b> <b>For</b> example, innovations regarding {{the construction of the}} entablature developed in the west allowed the spanning of much wider spaces than before, leading to some very deep peristaseis and broad naoi. The peristasis often had a depth of two column distances, e.g. at Temple of Hera I, Paestum, and temples C, F and G at Selinus, classifying them as pseudodipteroi. The opisthodomos only played a subsidiary role, but did occur sometimes, e.g. at the temple of Poseidon in Paestum. Much more frequently, the temples included a separate room at the back end of the cella, entrance to which was usually forbidden, the adyton. In some cases, the adyton was a free-standing structure within the cella, e.g. temple G in Selinus. If possible, columns inside the cella were avoided, allowing for open roof constructions of up to 13 m width.|$|E

However, according to Drăghicescu, the FPSR was destined to slowly erode the Peasantist vote, with the consolidation of the proletarian class. Moscovici, Grigorovici, alongside Ghelerter and Dragu, were [...] "realistic" [...] leaders, who could potentially transform the FPSR from a sectarian [...] "class party" [...] into a [...] "party of ideas". At the time, the party's theorist was Voinea, who, as an Austromarxist, steered the FPSR away from social-liberal <b>deviations.</b> <b>For</b> his part, Moscovici represented the FPSR and spoke about its policies at Dimitrie Gusti's Social Institute—one {{of a set of}} conferences in which Romanian doctrinaires advertised their respective ideologies.|$|E
