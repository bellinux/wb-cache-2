25|$|Jim Wyatt, of the Tennesseean, {{reports that}} Ringer is the {{favorite}} for the 3rd string job, and almost a lock to make the roster. Fullback Ahmard Hall said “He’s a character guy, and you could tell that from the start, He’s the total package. You rarely get that combination of humility and natural athletic ability and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> that great combination. You combine those two and you get someone who could be unstoppable.’’ Of all the praise, Ringer responded, “I have to give credit to how I was brought up. I {{grew up in a}} religious family and I know without God none of this would be possible for me anyway, so that definitely keeps me humble. My personality is not to boast and brag about the accomplishments and things I am trying to do. Actions speak louder than words and that is what I try and strive for.’’ In a 17-23 loss to the Cleveland Browns, Ringer only had one run for two yards. Ringer finished off the pre-season with a 7 carry 18 yard performance, in a 27-13 win over the Green Bay Packers.|$|E
500|$|After {{the episode}} broadcast, Joshua Jackson commented in an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly that [...] "apparently I’m [...] gonna be a dad. And it is like the most extreme long-distance relationship, which I am pretty good at as it turns out in real life. My baby mama is in another universe. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> to find out, but I don’t know exactly how we’re gonna work that out yet. As with other Fringe episodes, Fox released a science lesson plan in collaboration with Science Olympiad for grade school children, focusing on the science seen in [...] "Immortality", with the intention of having [...] "students learn about the influenza virus and how it spreads and impacts its host." ...|$|E
500|$|The writers first {{detailed}} Cane as [...] "a smart, loyal, {{and moral}} survivalist with an edge". Goddard describes Cane as a [...] "typical Australian, working-class {{kind of guy}} who mined opals, raised goats, then went off for travel and adventure to sort of find himself". Global BC penned Cane as [...] "mysterious". SoapNet described Cane as a [...] "pretty stand-up guy", as well as [...] "loyal and dedicated to the people he cares about". The network said his time in Genoa City has [...] "made him a good man". In an interview with On-Air On-Soaps, Goddard said that Cane working at Jabot Cosmetics is [...] "very enthusiastic and cautious about falling into a family business which is an Abbott company", and that he is [...] "very sensitive about that". He also stated that Cane [...] "has no fears in doing business with anybody" [...] because if you can come from a [...] "family of gangsters than business people don’t really measure up". Looking back on Cane's [...] "power jobs", Goddard stated: [...] "I don’t think Cane has the book learning skills side of it, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> the life lessons side of it, based on who he is and where he has come from. The way he does business with people, he kind of understands who they are as people." ...|$|E

500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the season, Sickels {{augmented}} his scouting {{report on}} Kinsler by reporting that he was: a good athlete, not super-toolsy, but strong for his size with speed a notch above average. His swing looked short, quick, and sharp. Although I'm told that some people worry that his swing is too long, it looked fine to me. [...] "Long swings" [...] usually show up in the stat line as excessive strikeout totals, but Kinsler is not a whiff king. He works the count well, controlling the strike zone without trouble and not swinging at pitches outside the plate area. His bat has some pop in it, particularly to the gaps, where he rifles frequent extra-base shots. He already has above-average power for a player his size, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> enough bat speed to keep hitting home runs at higher levels. Defensively, he shows slightly above-average range and good hands. His arm strength is average, but he's accurate with his throws and seems fundamentally sound, although his error rate is higher than ideal (20 in 71 games at Frisco). He might end up at second base eventually. Kinsler's running speed is a bit better than average, but he's fairly aggressive on the bases and will steal if the opportunity is there. Overall, he is a solid all-around player who makes the most of his natural ability.|$|E
500|$|Recurring {{cast members}} who appear in [...] "Acafellas" [...] are Stephen Tobolowsky as former glee club {{director}} Sandy Ryerson, Patrick Gallagher as football coach Ken Tanaka, Iqbal Theba as Principal Figgins, Kent Avenido as Sheets and Things employee Howard Bamboo, and Naya Rivera and Heather Morris as glee club members Santana Lopez and Brittany Pierce. Whit Hertford guest-starred as choreographer Dakota Stanley. Cheyenne Jackson was originally {{supposed to play}} Dakota Stanley, but {{when he arrived in}} California he learned that he had the flu. John Lloyd Young played Henri, [...] "a retired wood shop teacher with an excellent singing voice", and Victor Garber and Debra Monk played Will's parents. Morrison was [...] "thrilled" [...] by Garber's casting, having been a longstanding fan of his. Josh Groban received special guest star billing, playing, in Colfer's words, [...] "himself as this ignorant asshole". Morrison's rapping in the episode was an already acquired skill, with Gilsig commenting: [...] "He can do it. It didn't look like a joke, it actually looked totally authentic, and he was fantastic. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> just an amazing musical range. People like that who have been singing their whole lives, they have such a command of that." [...] Riley deemed Kurt's coming out in the episode [...] "very emotional" [...] and [...] "one of [...] favorite scenes". Colfer described the scene as [...] "very respectful and very touching ... very, very real and serious." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{has been}} speculated that Del Naja is {{responsible}} for creating the artwork attributed to the noted graffiti artist Banksy. In a 2017 segment on the Distraction Pieces podcast, guest DJ Goldie commented on Bansky's work: 'Give me a bubble letter {{and put it on}} a T-shirt and write “Banksy” on it and we’re sorted. We can sell it now... No disrespect to Robert, I think he is a brilliant artist. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> flipped the world of art over.' The last name of the 'Robert' mentioned was never given, but because of Goldie's friendship with Del Naja, it is highly possible Del Naja was being referenced.|$|E
2500|$|John Shelby Spong once accused Williams {{of being}} a [...] "neo-medievalist", preaching orthodoxy {{to the people in}} the pew but knowing in private that it is not true. In an {{interview}} with Third Way Magazine Williams responded: [...] "I am genuinely a lot more conservative than he would like me to be. Take the Resurrection. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> said that of course I know what all the reputable scholars think on the subject and therefore when I talk about the risen body I must mean something other than the empty tomb.

2500|$|A {{shoulder}} injury {{of his right}} shoulder caused Wu trouble in Early 2000, {{three months before the}} Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games. Wu's coach, Craig McCord, {{played a key role in}} Wu's return to form. Wu said, [...] "In some ways <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> more confidence in me that I have... He was always under the impression I was going to do well at the Olympic trials and time-wise it was one of my best events ever." [...] After being selected to compete at the 2000 Paralympic Games, Wu won five medals in Sydney, including golds in the 100m backstroke and the 100m butterfly, silvers in the 400m freestyle and the 200m individual medley, and a bronze in the 100m freestyle.|$|E
2500|$|... 2017 July: Trump and Putin hold {{a meeting}} {{for more than}} a two-hour period at the G20 Summit in Hamburg. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that Trump brought up {{discussion}} about Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 US Presidential election. According to Tillerson: [...] "President Putin denied such involvement, as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> in the past." [...] According to Sergey Lavrov: [...] "President Trump said that in the U.S. there are still some circles who are talking about Russian alleged intrusion and Russian alleged attempts to influence the U.S. election." [...] However, it has been acknowledged that the meeting was in fact friendly and that Trump, whom Putin described as a [...] "person-ally," [...] even stated that he predicted [...] "very positive things" [...] regarding future US-Russia relations. United States and Russia reached Syria ceasefire deal after Trump-Putin talks in Hamburg. German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters at her closing press conference of the G20 summit on July 8: [...] "I was delighted that it was on the margins of G20 that the first meeting between Trump and Putin took place. It's always better to talk one to the other, not one about the other. ... There are issues that cannot be solved without these two countries, be it Syria, be it disarmament, or be it North Korea. … It can only be to the benefit of all if there is good and open dialogue between these two countries." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2009, Chakraverti {{collaborated with}} filmmaker Anjan Dutt and Sarika {{to make a}} film called The Loving Doll, with the story taken from Sacred Evil again. It will be filmed in Hindi with bits of English. Sarika plays the central {{character}} of a middle-aged woman obsessed about losing her looks. The story revolves around a married couple beset with personal problems, triggered by a doll owned by the wife. Charaverti said: [...] "After the film Sacred Evil, I have been approached by several directors for another film but the inspiration was not there. This time around there was a synchronicity— Sarika phoned me to ask if I was thinking of another film. She has long wanted to play the woman in The Loving Doll [...] Then I happened to see Madly Bangalee, and liked Anjan’s work very much. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> the touch {{to be able to handle}} the subject of The Loving Doll. So I contacted him and he was very interested in the project. Though he works in a very different genre from mine, I think there is empathy between his work and mine." [...] Chakraverti also said that she may play the part of a healer in the film, [...] "It’s the director’s prerogative. We will do what is best for the film." [...] In April 2010, ETV Bangla created a serial called Dibaratrir Galpo, which was based on Beloved Witch. The plot of Dibaratrir Galpo, directed by Tathagata Banerjee, centres around a dispute between two aristocratic Bengali families, but the lead character (played by Sudipta Chakraborty) was shown as a follower of Wicca who learns to develop her psychic power and uses it to counter the machinations of her enemies. Chakraverti appeared on the commercials for the serial because she felt that her deglamorised presence helped audiences in the suburbs see elderly women, who are often branded as witches, in a positive light. [...] "I felt that the story of Dibaratrir Galpo would take to esoteric ideas very well. It has a women-oriented theme and it will show how the negative aspects of the esoteric can be countered." ...|$|E
