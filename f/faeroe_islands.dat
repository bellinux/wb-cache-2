In the post-glacial epoch, circa 6100 BC, Scotland and the <b>Faeroe</b> <b>Islands</b> experienced a tsunami up to 20 metres high caused by the Storegga Slides, an immense underwater landslip off the coast of Norway. Earth tremors are infrequent and usually slight. The Great Glen is the most seismically active area of Britain, but the last event of any size was in 1901.|$|E
5|$|HMS Havant was an H-class {{destroyer}} originally {{ordered by}} the Brazilian Navy with the name Javary in the late 1930s, but was bought by the Royal Navy after the beginning of World War II in September 1939. The ship was initially assigned to escort duties in the Western Approaches, but {{was transferred to the}} Home Fleet when the Norwegian Campaign began in April 1940. She was only peripherally involved in the campaign as she escorted ships carrying troops that occupied Iceland and the <b>Faeroe</b> <b>Islands</b> as well as convoys to Narvik. Havant was evacuating troops from Dunkirk when she was badly damaged by Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers on 1 June and had to be scuttled.|$|E

40|$|The SRES A 1 B {{scenario}} {{for the period}} 2072 – 2097 with the Bergen Climate Model (BCM) has been downscaled for the marine climate in the North Sea using the Regional Ocean Model System (ROMS). The results are compared to the 20 C 3 M run for the period 1972 – 1997. The results show a warming of the North Sea, with a volume average of 1. 4 ◦C, and a mean SST change of 1. 7 ◦C. The warming is strongest in May–June. Geographically the strongest warming in the North Sea is found towards Skagerrak–Kattegat in the surface waters and in the central North Sea at 50 m depth. The downscaling show a weak increase in the Atlantic inflow to the North Sea. The BCM scenario has {{a change in the}} wind stress pattern in the <b>Faeroe</b> <b>Island</b> region. This strengthens the branch of Atlantic Water flowing west of the Faeroes and weakens the flux through the Faeroe–Shetland Channel. As a result both BCM and the downscaling show large changes in the temperature in this area, with weak warming and sometimes cooling south of the Faeroes and strong warming on the north side. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{background}} for {{the paper is the}} expected climate change and its effect on the Norwegian mackerel fishing industry. Global warming is expected to affect the ecosystem in the Northeast Atlantic. Considerable uncertainty surrounds the prediction of how the NEA mackerel stock will be affected by the climate change. However, qualitative predictions indicate that the NEA mackerel stock will move further north into the northern North Sea, the Norwegian Sea and into the southern Barents Sea. Norway has 31 % of the TAC, and shares the NEA mackerel with <b>Faeroe</b> <b>Island</b> and the EU. Climate induced changes in the ecosystem can change the migration pattern and spawning areas, and therefore change the TAC and how it is distributed between countries. Norway exports mackerel products for about 2. 5 billion Norwegian kroner per year. The paper shows that changes in gross revenue due to changes in TAC are about three times higher in the infinitely elastic demand case compared with an elastic demand. If the Norwegian TAC increases by 20 %, the gross revenue increases by 25 - 30 million Norwegian kroner per year in the elastic case and about 120 million Norwegian kroner if the demand is infinitely elastic...|$|R

25|$|The {{squadron}} became operative on 20 April 1943. Three {{days later}} a detachment {{was sent to}} RAF Scatsta on Shetland. The role continued as before, with submarine sweeping, patrol and reconnaissance, as well as meteorological surveys. They regularly patrolled the areas between Shetland past the <b>Faeroe</b> <b>Islands</b> to Iceland. Also active in the area was the Norwegian 333 Squadron and other RAF squadrons. The Sunderlands would on occasion partake in aerial combat with German fighters. Following the Allied Invasion of Normandy in June 1944, German submarines increasingly moved northwards and the 330 Sqn intensified its sweeping. From August the German tactics changed and the 330 Sqn's patrols moved steadily closer to Norway.|$|E

25|$|The {{squadron}} {{was assigned}} to the Grand Fleet in mid-1914 as the Navy mobilised for war. It spent much of its time with the Grand Fleet reinforcing the patrols near the Shetland and <b>Faeroe</b> <b>Islands</b> and the Norwegian coast where Devonshire captured a German merchantman on 6 August. She was refitted in September and again in February. Despite numerous sorties with {{the main body of the}} Grand Fleet, she did not see combat. She patrolled the Norwegian coast in April 1916 and was then assigned to the Nore. Devonshire {{was assigned to}} the 7th Cruiser Squadron of the Grand Fleet before she was transferred to the Atlantic to protect Allied shipping in December. She remained there into 1919 and was listed for sale in May 1920. Devonshire was sold for scrap on 9 May 1921 and broken up at Barrow-in-Furness in 1923.|$|E
25|$|Det Forenede Dampskibs-Selskab {{was formed}} on 11 December 1866 as a merger {{of the three}} biggest Danish {{steamship}} companies {{under the leadership of}} Danish financier Carl Frederik Tietgen. Operations began on 1 January 1867 with 19 ships with Copenhagen as the main starting point. The company's routes at the time were from Denmark to Norway, the Baltic, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Iceland and The <b>Faeroe</b> <b>Islands,</b> with ships carrying both freight and passengers. As the company grew, new connections were opened to Sweden, France, the Mediterranean and Black Sea, as well as North America and South America. In addition, DFDS operated various domestic services in Denmark. After continued expansion of the fleet in the 1880s, DFDS became one of the world's ten largest ship-owning companies. After the takeover of Dampskibsselskabet Thingvalla in 1898, the Scandinavian-American Line was established. The Scandinavian-American Line continued trading to the United States until 1935.|$|E
25|$|During {{the summer}} of 2002, Danish Air Transport offered flights to Aalborg in Denmark, using what would {{otherwise}} have been an empty return flight to its base, but it sold only less than half the seats. The airport's largest creditor was Stord Municipality, to whom it owed NOK5.5 million. In December 2002, the airport company transferred the ownership of the real estate in exchange for the debt being wiped. Coast Air moved its technical base from Florø Airport to Sørstokken in April 2003, and in April started flights to Oslo using ATR 42 aircraft up to three times per day. There was not sufficient traffic for both airlines, and Coast Air terminated the route from June. In August the airline started flights on Friday and Sunday, but these were again terminated in March 2004. In 2004, Aker Stord started leasing British Aerospace 146-200 aircraft operated by Atlantic Airways. The airline also offered monthly charter flights to Vágar Airport on the <b>Faeroe</b> <b>Islands.</b>|$|E
25|$|Periodically, {{velocities}} {{may increase}} dramatically or even reverse due to atmospheric storms raising the local surface eddy kinetic energy, which gets partially transmitted down to abyssal depths in episodes called benthic storms. These velocities may reach magnitudes well above 40cm/s and vary significantly {{depending on the}} specific location. At the lower continental rise, south of Halifax, Nova Scotia, and at the lower slope around the <b>Faeroe</b> <b>Islands</b> these velocities may reach up to 73cm/s and 75cm/s, respectively. Bottom-current flow velocities have been measured as high as 300cm/s in the Strait of Gibraltar. These benthic storms occur only 5 to 10 times per year and usually last between 3 and 5 days, but that is enough to heavily erode benthic sediment and keep the finer grains in suspension even after flow velocities return to normal and the bedload has been deposited. During benthic storms, the eroded sediment may be transported over thousands of kilometers and deposited rather quickly (i.e. ~1.5cm/month) once the storm wanes. However, the net sedimentation rate over thousands of years may be much smaller (i.e. ~5.5cm/year) due to the intense periods of erosion during benthic storms.|$|E
25|$|Cunningham's cruiser {{squadron}} {{was asked}} to reinforce the Home Fleet under Admiral Sir Charles Forbes and assigned to the Norwegian campaign. He {{took part in the}} evacuation of allied troops from Namsos in May 1940 and the following month embarked King Haakon VII and his government ministers in Devonshire under orders to convey them to the United Kingdom. Shortly after his departure from Tromsø on this voyage, the aircraft carrier HMS Glorious and her two screening destroyers HMS Acasta and HMS Ardent were attacked and sunk on June 8 by Scharnhorst and Gneisenau; the thirty nine sailors who survived after two days on rafts in the cold sea were rescued by Norwegian ships making for the <b>Faeroe</b> <b>Islands.</b> The analysis of the action, supported by eyewitnesses from Devonshire, concludes that Glorious sent a sighting signal that was received only by Devonshire. Cunningham took steps to suppress the signal and continued on his way. According to a Norwegian history there were 461 passengers on board and Cunningham showed the signal to King Haakon who asked what his orders were: Cunningham replied, 'to bring you safely to England'. The King later remarked, 'I realised this was not to Admiral Cunningham's liking'. Cunningham was mentioned in despatches on 11 July 1940.|$|E

500|$|The {{ancestors}} of the Icelandic horse were probably taken to Iceland by Viking Age Scandinavians between 860 and 935AD.

The ship served as the flagship of the III Scouting Group, under Konteradmiral Johannes Merten, who would go on to command the Ottoman fortifications at the Dardanelles during World War I. In March 1910 and March 1911, Prinz Adalbert conducted gunnery tests in the northern North Sea and visited Tórshavn and Vestmanna in the <b>Faeroe</b> <b>Islands.</b> She visited Ålesund in Norway in July and August that year. The ship's first period in service came to an end in September, following a large naval review in the Kiel roadstead for Wilhelm II and Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, which began on 5 September. Prinz Adalbert was then decommissioned in Kiel on the 29th, with the armored cruiser [...] taking her place as the fleet's gunnery training ship. After a lengthy , Prinz Adalbert returned to service on 1 November 1912, again with the artillery school. She was based in Sonderburg, where she replaced the armored cruiser Prinz Heinrich.|$|E
