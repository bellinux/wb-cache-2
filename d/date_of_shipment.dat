50|$|Historically, coal taxes (metage, payable on each chaldron of 35 bushels or the {{imperial}} ton) were {{charged by the}} City based on volume measurements. A coal duty of 4 pence was confirmed by James I, with a duty of 8 pence more added under William III and Mary II, and an additional 1 pence added to fund {{the construction of the}} new Coal Exchange. From 1831, the City of London charged a duty of 13 pence per imperial ton before coal could be unshipped, and a certificate was sent to the Coal Exchange stating the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>shipment,</b> name and owner of the ship, quantity of coal, where it was mined, and the price paid. The coal trade was dominated by sea transport until 1845, but railway transportation increased in importance in the 1850s and 1860s, with similar quantities carried on the rails, and the coal duty was extended to coal brought within 20 miles of London by any means in 1862. By 1875, five million tons of coal were being brought to London each year by rail and three million tons by sea.|$|E
5000|$|Cargo {{preference}} {{is administered by}} the United States Maritime Administration ("MARAD"). Originally, MARAD provided advice to shipper agencies, without being able to compel compliance. Finding the arrangement unsatisfactory, Congress passed the Merchant Marine Act of 1970, Pub. L. No. 91-469, which authorized MARAD to issue regulations governing cargo preference shipments by the other agencies. Section 27 of the 1970 Act added explicit cargo preference authority, which was amended in 2008 to provide MARAD with the authority to (a) [...] "direct agencies to require the transportation in United States-flagged vessels of cargo shipments not otherwise subject to Preference in equivalent amounts to cargo determined to have been shipped on foreign carriers in violation of Preference" [...] and (b) [...] "impose on any person that violates Cargo Preference Act or a MARAD implementing regulation, a civil penalty of not more than $25,000 for each violation willfully and knowingly committed, with each day of a continuing violation following the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>shipment</b> to be a separate violation." [...] Although cargo preference contains exceptions where U.S.-flag vessels are unavailable, as discussed infra, shipper agencies may determine non-availability only with MARAD concurrence.|$|E
