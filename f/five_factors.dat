50|$|The {{factors in}} the {{alternative}} Five model correspond to traits in Eysenck's three factor model, and to {{four of the five}} traits in the <b>Five</b> <b>factor</b> model. Neuroticism-anxiety is basically identical to neuroticism, while sociability is very similar to extraversion in the Eysenck and <b>five</b> <b>factor</b> models. Impulsive sensation-seeking is positively correlated with psychoticism from Eysenck's model, and negatively with conscientiousness in the <b>five</b> <b>factor</b> model, and {{it has been argued that}} psychopathy represents an extreme form of this trait. Aggression-hostility is inversely related to agreeableness in the <b>five</b> <b>factor</b> model. Zuckerman and colleagues noted that Activity is subsumed under extraversion in some models of personality but argued that it should be considered an independent dimension of temperament that is distinct from sociability. A later study comparing Zuckerman's model with the <b>Five</b> <b>Factor</b> model using factor analysis found that Activity, sociability, and extraversion all loaded onto a single factor, suggesting that Activity and extraversion are closely related.|$|R
25|$|In the NEO PI, {{each of the}} <b>five</b> <b>factors</b> {{identified}} by Costa and McCrae are identified with six lower-level traits. Known as facets, the lower-level traits subsumed by agreeableness were first introduced with the 1992 publication of the revised version of the NEO PI. Based on the modern NEO PI-R, the six facets of agreeableness are: Trust, straightforwardness, Altruism, Compliance, Modesty, and Tender-Mindedness.|$|E
25|$|The {{underpinnings}} for {{the contemporary}} moral panic {{were found in}} a rise of <b>five</b> <b>factors</b> in the {{years leading up to}} the 1980s: the establishment of fundamentalist Christianity and political organization of the Moral Majority; the rise of the Anti-cult movement which spread ideas of abusive cults kidnapping and brainwashing children and teens; the appearance of the Church of Satan and other explicitly Satanist groups that added a kernel of truth to the existence of Satanic cults; the development of the social work or child protection field, and its struggle to have child sexual abuse recognized as a social problem and a serious crime; and the popularization of posttraumatic stress disorder, repressed memory, and corresponding survivor movement.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the failure}} rate of startup {{companies}} is very high. A 2014 article in Fortune estimated that 90% of startups ultimately fail. In {{a sample of}} 101 unsuccessful start-ups, the top <b>five</b> <b>factors</b> in failure were lack of consumer interest in the product or service (42% of failures); funding or cash problems (29%); personnel or staffing problems (23%); competition from rival companies (19%); and problems with pricing of the product or service (18%). In cases of funding problems it can leave employees without paychecks. Sometimes these companies are purchased by other companies, if they are deemed to be viable, but oftentimes they leave employees with very little recourse to recoup lost income for worked time.|$|E
50|$|Thomas Widiger and his {{collaborators}} have contributed to this debate significantly. He discussed {{the constraints of the}} categorical approach and argued for the dimensional approach to the personality disorders. Specifically, he proposed the <b>Five</b> <b>Factor</b> Model of personality {{as an alternative to the}} classification of personality disorders. For example, this view specifies that Borderline Personality Disorder can be understood as a combination of emotional lability (i.e., high neuroticism), impulsivity (i.e., low conscientiousness), and hostility (i.e., low agreeableness). Many studies across cultures have explored the relationship between personality disorders and the <b>Five</b> <b>Factor</b> Model. This research has demonstrated that personality disorders largely correlate in expected ways with measures of the <b>Five</b> <b>Factor</b> Model and has set the stage for including the <b>Five</b> <b>Factor</b> Model within DSM-5.|$|R

25|$|Sternberg & Lubart’s Investment Theory. Using {{the metaphor}} of a stock market, they {{demonstrate}} that creative thinkers are like good investors – they buy low and sell high (in their ideas). Like under/low-valued stock, creative individuals generate unique ideas that are initially rejected by other people. The creative individual has to persevere, and convince the others of the ideas value. After convincing the others, and thus increasing the ideas value, the creative individual ‘sells high’ by leaving the idea with the other people, and moves onto generating another idea. According to this theory, six distinct, but related elements contribute to successful creativity: intelligence, knowledge, thinking styles, personality, motivation, and environment. Intelligence {{is just one of}} the six factors that can either solely, or in conjunction with the other <b>five</b> <b>factors,</b> generate creative thoughts.|$|E
25|$|To {{address the}} absence of {{measures}} of Dark triad traits (i.e., narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy), Michael Ashton and Kibeom Lee proposed {{the addition of a}} sixth factor to the Five Factor Model. Validated with psycholexical studies similar to those used {{in the development of the}} Five Factor Model, the HEXACO Model adds Honesty-Humility to <b>five</b> <b>factors</b> resembling those in the NEO PI. Although Honesty-Humility does not directly correspond to any Big Five trait, it is strongly correlated with the Straightforwardness and Modesty facets of Big Five Agreeableness. As both of these facets are only weakly correlated with Big Five Agreeableness, Ashton and Lee suggest dividing NEO PI Agreeableness into two factors similar to those in the HEXACO Model: Honesty-Humility (i.e., Straightforwardness and Modesty) and a redefined Agreeableness (Trust, Altruism, Compliance, and Tender-Mindedness). Reflecting this conception of Honesty-Humility and HEXACO Agreeableness as unique though similar concepts, Ashton and Lee propose that they represent different aspects of reciprocal altruism: fairness (Honesty-Humility) and tolerance (Agreeableness).|$|E
25|$|Terms such as 'hard-working,' 'reliable,' and 'persevering' {{describe}} desirable {{aspects of}} character. Because {{it was once}} {{believed to be a}} moral evaluation, conscientiousness was overlooked as a real psychological attribute. The reality of individual differences in conscientiousness has now been clearly established by studies of cross-observer agreement. Peer and expert ratings confirm the self-reports that people make about their degrees of conscientiousness. Furthermore, both self-reports and observer ratings of conscientiousness predict real-life outcomes such as academic success. During most of the 20th century, psychologists believed that personality traits could be divided into two categories: temperament and character. Temperament traits were thought to be biologically based, whereas character traits were thought to be learned either during childhood or throughout life. With the advent of the FFM (Five-Factor Model), behavior geneticists began systematic studies of the full range of personality traits, and {{it soon became clear that}} all <b>five</b> <b>factors</b> are substantially heritable. Identical twins showed very similar personality traits even when they had been separated at birth and raised apart, and this was equally true for both character traits and temperament traits. Parents and communities influence the ways in which conscientiousness is expressed, but they apparently do not influence its level.|$|E

2500|$|In {{personality}} psychology, {{researchers have}} generally {{agreed on a}} five-factor model of personality. The <b>five</b> <b>factors</b> are extraversion (i.e. social, outgoing), agreeableness (i.e. trusting, helpful), neuroticism (i.e. worried, anxious), openness to experience (i.e. imaginative, creative), and conscientiousness (i.e. organized, careful). [...] Nature relatedness (overall) is significantly related to extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience. In addition, a subscale of nature relatedness (nature relatedness-experience) is negatively related with neuroticism. These authors describe the nature relatedness person {{as someone who is}} more adventurous, easy going, and gregarious. It may also be that highly nature related people are more environmental friendly because of the positive (albeit weak) relationship with conscientiousness. Evidence suggests that people vary in their subjective sense of connectedness with nature much like any of the <b>five</b> <b>factors</b> listed above. Supportive of these results, a recent study has found that environmental engagement (protecting the environment, electricity conservation and environmental values) is related to agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness to experience. Another study found that nature connectedness accounted for (mediated) the relationship between openness and pro-environmental behaviours.|$|E
