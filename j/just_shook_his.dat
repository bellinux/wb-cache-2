2500|$|Buffalo Bill {{would not}} discuss the killing of Chief American Horse at Slim Buttes He <b>just</b> <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> head {{and said it was}} too bad to talk about. While Cody did not {{participate}} in the Battle of Slim Buttes, he took a scalp at the Battle of Warbonnet Creek on July 17, 1876, in a skirmish characterized as a duel between Buffalo Bill and a young Cheyenne warrior named Yellow Hair. The engagement, {{often referred to as the}} [...] "First Scalp for Custer", was dramatized with Captain Jack in their consolidated theater act. [...] Buffalo Bill displayed the fallen warrior's scalp, feather war bonnet, knife, saddle and other personal effects. [...] However, scalping Indians become loathsome to Buffalo Bill.|$|E

60|$|But {{the lobster}} {{would not let}} go. Tom saw the {{fisherman}} haul {{him up to the}} boat-side, and thought it was all up with him. But when Mr. Lobster saw the fisherman, he gave such a furious and tremendous snap, that he snapped out of his hand, and out of the pot, and safe into the sea. But he left his knobbed claw behind him; for it never came into his stupid head to let go after all, so he <b>just</b> <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> claw off as the easier method. It was something of a bull, that; but you must know the lobster was an Irish lobster, and was hatched off Island Magee at the mouth of Belfast Lough.|$|E
5000|$|The film {{ends with}} the Capellos assuring Jeremy that they love him and want to help him deal with his [...] "problem". Jeremy then {{introduces}} Darla to his delightfully surprised parents, while Ralph <b>just</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> head at the whole hubbub.|$|R
60|$|Uncle Leopold came in <b>just</b> then, <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> head dubiously. He was {{not going}} to spend Christmas with Edward and Geraldine, and perhaps the {{prospect}} of having to cook and eat his Christmas dinner all alone made him pessimistic.|$|R
50|$|The {{next person}} David meets is an elderly man, {{who came to}} the emporium by accident. He {{eventually}} admits he lost the respect of his children, and David grudgingly points him (with help of the orb) to a mirror, which he should look at for no less than five and a half minutes. The man begins this procedure, but is disgusted by what he sees—a distorted, monstrous image of him. Unable to control himself, he smashes the mirror, then realizes what he has done. And just like with the old woman, David <b>just</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> head and leaves.|$|R

5000|$|Due to the game's failure, Molyneux {{retreated from}} game design, and started Taurus Impex Limited—a company that {{exported}} baked beans to the Middle East —with {{his business partner}} Les Edgar. Commodore International mistook it for Torus, a more established company that produced networking software, and offered to provide Molyneux with ten free Amiga systems to help in porting [...] "his" [...] networking software. [...] "... it suddenly {{dawned on me that}} this guy didn't know who we were", Molyneux later said. [...] "I suddenly had this crisis of conscience. I thought, 'If this guy finds out, there go my free computers down the drain.' So I <b>just</b> <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> hand and ran out of that office". Taurus designed a database system for the Amiga, called Acquisition - The Ultimate Database for The Amiga and, after clearing up the misunderstanding with Commodore, the program was released and became a moderate success.|$|E
5000|$|Surrounded {{by family}} and friends, Deneen took his first turns on skis {{at the age of}} 11 months, two months after he began walking. His father had brought him to a ski shop asking for the {{smallest}} skis they had, and had to stuff newspaper in the boots {{in order for them to}} fit. [...] "The boot-fitter was <b>just</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> head," [...] said Deneen's father. After his father found the flattest slope near the lodge, Deneen skied down toward his mother who was at the bottom, turning along the way as people called his name.|$|R
5000|$|On 27 April 2011 it was {{confirmed}} by club officials that St. Helens joint captain James Graham will join NRL side Canterbury Bulldogs when his contract expires {{at the end of}} the 2011 season. [...] "We did everything practical to persuade James to stay," [...] said Saints chairman Eamonn McManus. [...] "But we respect his wishes and ambitions. There comes a point where you have to <b>just</b> <b>shake</b> <b>his</b> hand and wish him luck." [...] Graham left St Helens with a 4-5 record in finals (1-5 in Super League Grand Finals in 2006, and 2007-2011; and 3-0 in Challenge Cup Finals from 2008-2010).|$|R
5000|$|Pierrepoint is {{referenced}} indirectly in {{the song}} [...] "Let Him Dangle" [...] by Elvis Costello on his album Spike. The line [...] "As the hangman shook Bentley's hand to calculate his weight", implies that Pierrepoint could work out his victim's weight (and therefore the force needed to hang him) <b>just</b> by <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> hand.|$|R
5000|$|I cannot say {{specifically}} {{where your}} father and Mrs. Hubbard were when the torpedoes hit, but I can tell you just what happened after that. They emerged from their room, which was {{on the port side}} of the vessel, and came on to the boat-deck.Neither appeared perturbed in the least. Your father and Mrs. Hubbard linked arms—the fashion in which they always walked the deck—and stood apparently wondering what to do. I passed him with a baby which I was taking to a lifeboat when he said, 'Well, Jack, they have got us. They are a damn sight worse than I ever thought they were.'They did not move very far away from where they originally stood. As I moved {{to the other side of}} the ship, in preparation for a jump when the right moment came, I called to him, 'What are you going to do?' and he <b>just</b> <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> head, while Mrs. Hubbard smiled and said, 'There does not seem to be anything to do.' The expression seemed to produce action on the part of your father, for then he did one of the most dramatic things I ever saw done. He simply turned with Mrs. Hubbard and entered a room on the top deck, the door of which was open, and closed it behind him.It was apparent that his idea was that they should die together, and not risk being parted on going into the water.|$|E
5000|$|The next day, a bus {{arrives at}} Kadic. It drops off {{a student and}} his dog. They're named Odd and Kiwi, respectively. Odd is greeted by Jeremie, who also {{introduces}} him to his friend, Ulrich. Jeremie makes a comment about Kiwi, saying something about him looking [...] "really dumb." [...] Odd claims Kiwi is very sensitive and can get mean, and pushes the dog into Jeremie's face. Jeremie believes him at first, but Odd quickly reveals the act to be a joke (showing off his goofball smile). Ulrich <b>just</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> head in disbelief. Some time later, while showing Odd around the school, Jeremie points out Yumi, who is practicing Pencak Silat with Ulrich. Jeremie makes sure {{to point out that}} getting on her bad side is not a good idea. As the two practice, Yumi eventually throws Ulrich to the floor and pins him. After a short stint of heavy breathing, Yumi blushes.|$|R
5000|$|... 22. Picture of ParadiseWhen Zeke {{finds out}} Maxine {{is on her}} way to a summer camp for a week, he tries to impress her by saying he's really into camping too. Jay scoff's at Zeke's bravado and Zeke scoffs back at Jay - don't worry, I've got my Pad. In fact, Zeke draws himself, Jay and the family in the {{campground}} next to Maxine's 'girls camp' in order to use the opportunity to impress her more. After several bumbling attempts to show Max his camping know-how go awry, Zeke drags Jay along to follow Maxine in a wilderness walk, with a plan to help her out when she gets lost. Unfortunately, it is Zeke and Jay who get lost and even the Pad's GPS can't help them. But when Maxine witnesses Zeke unwittingly saving his family from a bear, she's more than impressed and joins the family back for some of Ida's risotto over the open fire. Jay <b>just</b> <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> head, not believing Zeke's luck.|$|R
5000|$|Unimpressed by Waterhouse's acting ability, Tom Baker {{suggested}} that, [...] "Because of his amazing appearance, Matthew {{should have}} played Adric like Sabu - a little wild boy who couldn't speak. I {{would talk to}} him rather like Basil Fawlty talks to Manuel, and he'd <b>just</b> nod or <b>shake</b> <b>his</b> head. But John Nathan-Turner didn't like that idea." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Bulstrode was {{conscious}} {{of being in a}} good spiritual frame and more than usually serene, under the influence of his innocent recreation. He was doctrinally convinced that there was a total absence of merit in himself; but that doctrinal conviction may be held without pain when the sense of demerit does not take a distinct shape in memory and revive the tingling of shame or the pang of remorse. Nay, it may be held with intense satisfaction when the depth of our sinning is but a measure for the depth of forgiveness, and a clenching proof that we are peculiar instruments of the divine intention. The memory has as many moods as the temper, and shifts its scenery like a diorama. At this moment Mr. Bulstrode felt as if the sunshine were all one with that of far-off evenings when he was a very young man and used to go out preaching beyond Highbury. And he would willingly have had that service of exhortation in prospect now. The texts were there still, and so was his own facility in expounding them. His brief reverie was interrupted by the return of Caleb Garth, who also was on horseback, and was <b>just</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> bridle before starting, when he exclaimed-- ...|$|R
5000|$|Sullivan {{hosted a}} second {{appearance}} by Presley on October 28, 1956. Elvis performed [...] "Don't Be Cruel", then [...] "Love Me Tender". Sullivan then addressed {{the audience as}} he stood beside Elvis, who began <b>shaking</b> <b>his</b> legs, eliciting screams from the audience. By the time Sullivan turned his head, Elvis was standing motionless. After Presley left the stage, Sullivan stated, [...] "I can’t figure this darn thing out. You know. He <b>just</b> does this <b>shakes</b> <b>his</b> legs and everybody yells." [...] Elvis appeared a second time in the show and sang [...] "Love Me". Later on, he sang a nearly four-minute-long version of [...] "Hound Dog" [...] and was shown in full the entire song.|$|R
5000|$|Pärt {{was born}} in Paide, Järva County, Estonia and was raised by his mother and {{stepfather}} in Rakvere in northern Estonia. He began to experiment with {{the top and bottom}} notes of the family's piano as the middle register was damaged. Pärt's musical education began at age seven. He began attending music school in Rakvere, where his family lived. By the time he reached his early teenage years, Pärt was writing his own compositions. His first serious study came in 1954 at the Tallinn Music Middle School, but {{less than a year later}} he temporarily abandoned it to fulfill military service, playing oboe and percussion in the army band. After his service he attended the Tallinn Conservatory, where he studied composition with Heino Eller and it was said of him, [...] "he <b>just</b> seemed to <b>shake</b> <b>his</b> sleeves and the notes would fall out". [...] As a student, he produced music for film and the stage. During the 1950s, he also completed his first vocal composition, the cantata Meie aed ('Our Garden') for children's choir and orchestra. He graduated in 1963. From 1957 to 1967, he worked as a sound producer for Estonian radio.|$|R

6000|$|... "How {{would the}} {{ordinary}} thief get his money without being detected? Who would dare {{to walk into}} Garnett's shop with the diamonds {{in his hands and}} ask for the four hundred pounds? Besides, they have been sold to some one,--and, as I believe, to my dear friend, Mr. Benjamin. 'I suppose you ain't a-going anywhere just at present, Lord George?' said that fellow Gager. 'What the devil's that to you?' I asked him. He <b>just</b> laughed and <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> head. I don't doubt but that there's a policeman about waiting till I leave this house;--or looking at me now with a magnifying glass from the windows at the other side. They've photographed me while I'm going about, and published a list of every hair on my face in the 'Hue and Cry.' I dined at the club yesterday, and found a strange waiter. I feel certain that he was a policeman done up in livery all for my sake. I turned sharp round in the street yesterday, and found a man at a corner. I am sure that man was watching me, and was looking at my pockets to see whether the jewel case was there. As for myself, I can think of nothing else. I wish I had got them. I should have something then to pay me for all this nuisance." ...|$|R
