40|$|Capital {{punishment}} is not practiced {{by a majority}} of the world 2 ̆ 7 s states. Anti-capital punishment domestic policies have led to an international law of human rights that emphatically prohibits cruel and inhuman punishment. International concern for the abolition of capital punishment has prompted <b>Islamic</b> <b>states</b> that still endorse and practice the death penalty to respond with equally compelling concerns based on the tenets of Islamic law. Professor William A. Schabas suggests that <b>Islamic</b> <b>states</b> view capital punishment according to the principles embodied in the Koran. Islamic law functions on the belief that all {{people have a right to}} life unless the administration of Islamic law determines otherwise. Professor Schabas emphasizes that capital punishment exists in the domestic law of all <b>Islamic</b> <b>states,</b> but the ways by which these states employ capital punishment are varied and inconsistent. Although Professor Schabas acknowledges that <b>Islamic</b> <b>states</b> correctly argue that capital {{punishment is}} an element of Islamic law, he maintains that <b>Islamic</b> <b>states</b> do not recognize the more limited role of the death penalty articulated by the Islamic religion...|$|R

The decision came {{three days after the}} United States began conducting air attacks against the <b>Islamic</b> <b>State.</b> Tornados were pre-positioned to use their surveillance capabilities to gather situational awareness to help with humanitarian efforts. On 29 September 2014, three days after Parliament approved of airstrikes against <b>Islamic</b> <b>State</b> forces inside Iraq, two Tornados conducted their first armed reconnaissance mission over the country, in conjunction with other coalition aircraft, and were cleared to conduct airstrikes if needed.

By 1 March 2015, eight RAF Tornados had been deployed to Akrotiri and conducted 159 airstrikes against IS targets in Iraq.|$|E

Key findings 	<b>Islamic</b> <b>State’s</b> media arm has a clearly defined strategy to manipulate the mainstream media to serve its propaganda objectives. 	A more critical view of <b>Islamic</b> <b>State’s</b> claims and propaganda is needed to limit the effectiveness of the group’s messages. 	The role of the media, as well as the stories of returnees and defectors, as a platform for counter-messaging has been underutilised...|$|R
