50|$|Before the {{emergence}} of the World Wide Web for information browsing, Microsoft recognized the importance of having an engine that supported a multimedia markup language, full text search, and extensibility using software objects. The hypertext display, hyperlinking and search software was created by a team of CD-ROM Division developers in the late 1980s who designed it as a generalized engine for uses as diverse as <b>interactive</b> <b>help,</b> document management systems and as ambitious as a multimedia encyclopedia.|$|E
50|$|Edbrowse is {{sometimes}} described as dense in its code {{and in its}} human interface. It contains many cryptic one and two letter commands, and few <b>interactive</b> <b>help</b> facilities. There is no menu, no dialog, and no screen of intuitive icons to click on. Like bash, edbrowse greets the user with a blinking cursor, waiting for input, and if that input is syntactically incorrect, edbrowse simply prints a question mark. Thus {{it is important to}} read the edbrowse user's guide before diving in.|$|E
50|$|In programming, a docstring is {{a string}} literal {{specified}} in source code that is used, like a comment, to document a specific segment of code. Unlike conventional source code comments, or even specifically formatted comments like Javadoc documentation, docstrings are not stripped {{from the source}} tree when it is parsed, but are retained throughout the runtime of the program. This allows the programmer to inspect these comments at run time, for instance as an <b>interactive</b> <b>help</b> system, or as metadata.|$|E

50|$|The PS {{program can}} be used for studies with dichotomous, continuous, or {{survival}} response measures. The user specifies the alternative hypothesis in terms of differing response rates, means, survival times, relative risks, or odds ratios. Matched or independent study designs may be used. Power, sample size, and the detectable alternative hypothesis are interrelated. The user specifies any two of these three quantities and the program derives the third. A description of each calculation, written in English, is generated and may be copied into the user's documents. <b>Interactive</b> <b>help</b> is available. The program provides methods that are appropriate for matched and independent t-tests, survival analysis, matched and unmatched studies of dichotomous events, the Mantel-Haenszel test, and linear regression.The program can generate graphs of the relationships between power, sample size and the detectable alternative hypothesis. It can plot graphs of any two of these variables while holding the third constant. Linear or logarithmic axes may be used and multiple curves can be plotted on each graph. Graphs may be copied and pasted into other documents or programs for further editing.|$|E
