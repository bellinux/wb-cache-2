5|$|We were {{supposed}} to be with her in the studio for a couple of days. She kindly <b>invited</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> stay a little longer. We don't know what's going to end up on the album but it was an absolute you know honor... For me being such a fan for so long it was so exciting to hear her vocal in the room right next to me, coming out of her head really sounding exactly like all those records we all love and she's a pleasure to work with because she's so in tune with who she is and what she wants to sing. I don't know. It's really great collaborating with her and Natalia is such a great writer.|$|E
5|$|Kailua, now {{the capital}} of Owhyhee, was {{the seat of the}} {{government}} of the group after the conquests of the renowned Kamehameha I., who, it will be remembered, died here. It is situated within a wide bay, with a safe roadstead and good anchorage. It has a very few more inhabitants than some of the larger villages in the island, though much frequented by the natives living in the vicinity, on account of its being the centre of their civil and religious affairs. It has, however, four stone buildings and a fort. The buildings are, the residence of the governor; that of the parent of the missionaries, Mr. Thurston, whom we have had already occasion to name; and two places of worship. Immediately upon our arrival, we called to pay our respects to the governor, Kapeau, a native chief, who received us with good-humoured frankness, and ordered a room in the government-house to be prepared for our reception and residence; in order, as he said, that we might be as near to him as possible during our stay in the place. We were not long installed, before the hospitable chief came to pay us a visit, and, as it happened to be a bright moonlight night, he <b>invited</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> go at once in his company, to inspect the fort, which was in front of his residence, and which in passable English he called the right arm of his strength. We found it consist of a single battery commanding the bay, with twelve pieces of cannon of not very large calibre.|$|E
500|$|In December 2010, Jason Lipshutz of Billboard {{magazine}} {{reported that}} Los Tigres del Norte {{was set to}} record a MTV Unplugged album for MTV Tr3s. The album was to be taped {{in the first quarter}} of 2011, and would feature special guests including Juanes, Calle 13, Andrés Calamaro and Zack de la Rocha. By February 2011, it was announced that Paulina Rubio and Diego Torres would join the band for the album recording session. For the band this presented a unique opportunity to re-invent their music and share the stage with talented performers. [...] "When MTV <b>invited</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> record the show, we were a little tense, this was something different for us because Unplugged albums on MTV are usually recorded by artists from different genres from us," [...] the band said about the recording. Jesús Lara of MTV Tr3s called the production [...] "historic", since the band has been culturally a part of the life of the Hispanic community in Mexico and the US.|$|E

500|$|... "Sweet Life" [...] was raved {{by music}} critics. John Calvert of The Quietus {{described}} the song as [...] "really big. Like R. Kelly's [...] "I Believe I Can Fly" [...] big. Like Superman eating a super hotdog while fighting King Kong while...ok {{you get the}} picture. If you were looking around for a high concept pitch-style descriptor, with its synth brass and Philly soul strings {{you might call it}} 'Stevie Wonder meets N.E.R.D in space'. But then that would be too simplistic a definition for the multifaceted, resolutely accomplished 'Sweet Thing'." [...] Pitchforks Larry Fitzmaurice labeled it a [...] "Best New Track" [...] and noted that [...] "this was a week where Frank Ocean bravely <b>invited</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> learn more about his personal story; 'Sweet Life' is another reminder of how well he can structure a narrative in the musical realm." [...] The Telegraphs Neil McCormick noted that Ocean took the R genre and pushed it out into strange new places, with tracks like the [...] "blissful, jazzy jigsaw of 'Sweet Life', which seems to assemble itself from disconnected elements as it goes along." [...] AllMusic's Andy Kellman mused that the track served as one of the album's lighter moments, and wrote that [...] "the bright 'Sweet Life' and the relatively exuberant 'Monks,' both of which would be standouts on any N.E.R.D. album, offer more than bright coating, dealing in surrealism and sharp observations that are equally penetrating." ...|$|E

2500|$|At the least, {{the work}} was {{laborious}} and the conditions often spartan. Block and Hope would sometimes work until {{four in the morning}} writing and discussing material, only to head for a car or airfield at six to travel to another camp or hospital. On one occasion in Algiers, Block and Hope were contemplating their accommodations, wondering how they could spend the night sharing a room so small. John Steinbeck, at the time a war correspondent, overheard them complaining. [...] "You'll think this is practically a bridal suite, when you compare it to my room," [...] he told the two. They then followed Steinbeck downstairs to his room, which was half the size of theirs, and were introduced to [...] journalists Quentin Reynolds and H.R. Knickerbocker. Hope noticed even a third man sleeping and asked his identity. [...] "He's the British vice-consul," [...] Steinbeck replied. [...] "This is his room.

2500|$|Seeger died at New York-Presbyterian Hospital on January 27, 2014, {{at the age}} of 94. Response and {{reaction}} to Seeger's death quickly poured in. President Barack Obama noted that Seeger had been called [...] "America's tuning fork" [...] and that he believed in [...] "the power of song" [...] to bring social change, [...] "Over the years, Pete used his voice and his hammer to strike blows for workers' rights and civil rights; world peace and environmental conservation, and he always <b>invited</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> sing along.

[...] Folksinger and fellow activist Billy Bragg wrote that: [...] "Pete believed that music could make a difference. Not change the world, he never claimed that – he once said that if music could change the world he'd only be making music – but he believed that while music didn't have agency, it did have the power to make a difference." [...] Bruce Springsteen said of Seeger's death, [...] "I lost a great friend and a great hero last night, Pete Seeger", before performing [...] "We Shall Overcome" [...] while on tour in South Africa.|$|E

The reflections of the new realists <b>invite</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> reconsider the importance of objects, reality, and truth.

The film <b>invites</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> compare the circulation of migrants across a globalized transnational world to organs removed from one body and implanted into another. It questions our usual definitions of home and belonging, host and guest, health and the power to circulate. It both refers to the hospitality paradigm and radically rephrases it by making us consider the relationship between migrants and nations according to a different grid (hospitality vs. /or organ trafficking). It does not simply propose an alternative grand narrative but rewrites a familiar script without trying to erase it...|$|R
