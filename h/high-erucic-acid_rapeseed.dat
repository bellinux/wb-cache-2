40|$|Lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase acylates the sn- 2 {{hydroxyl}} group of lysophosphatidic acid to form phosphatidic acid, {{a precursor to}} triacylglycerol. A cDNA encoding lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase was isolated from developing seeds of meadowfoam (Limnanthes alba alba). The cDNA encodes a 281 -amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 32 kD. The cDNA was expressed in developing seeds of transgenic <b>high-erucic-acid</b> <b>rapeseed</b> (Brassica napus) using a napin expression cassette. Erucic acid {{was present at the}} sn- 2 position of triacylglycerols from transgenic plants but was absent from that position of seed oil extracted from control plants. Trierucin was present in the transgenic oil. Alteration of the sn- 2 erucic acid composition did not affect the total erucic acid content. These experiments demonstrate the feasibility of using acyltransferases to alter the stereochemical composition of transgenic seed oils and also represent a necessary step toward increasing the erucic acid content of rapeseed oil...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{composition}} of fatty acids in triacylglycerides (TAGs) and {{their position on}} the glycerol backbone determine the nutritional value of vegetable oil. In this study, gas chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) were {{used to analyze the}} composition and distribution of fatty acids in TAGs of different rapeseed oils. Our results show the content of oleic acid in high-oleic-acid rapeseed oil to be about 80 %. In {{terms of the number of}} acyl carbon atoms (CN), TAGs with CN 52 â€“C 54 were most abundant, with a maximum concentration at CN 54 (80 %). The main type of TAG was oleic-oleic-oleic (OOO), accounting for 71. 75 %, while oleic-oleic-linoleic (OOL) accounted for 7. 56 %, oleic-oleic-linolenic (OOLn) accounted for 4. 81 %, and stearic-oleic-oleic (SOO) accounted for 4. 74 %. Oleic acid in high-oleic-acid rapeseed oil was distributed in the following order of preference: sn- 2 > sn- 1 / 3. In <b>high-erucic-acid</b> <b>rapeseed</b> oil, however, oleic acid was enriched at the sn- 1 / 3. These data show that the content of oleic acid can be as high as about 80 % in high-oleic-acid material. This finding suggests that high-oleic-acid rapeseed oil has high nutritional value...|$|E
