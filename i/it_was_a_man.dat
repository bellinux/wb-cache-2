25|$|Canvey {{has its own}} 'lady of the lake' in {{the form}} of a woman who was drowned there many years ago. Local stories are sketchy, some even say <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who drowned, but the {{majority}} speak of a female ghost who has wandered the area since her horse-drawn carriage plummeted into the lake. A recent clean-up of the lake found remains of two horses and fragments of a wooden carriage.|$|E
25|$|Bagri {{would later}} state before his later trial {{that he knew}} was {{probably}} a suspect by October 1985 but insisted he would have faced charges {{if there were any}} evidence he {{had anything to do with}} the bombing.

Parmar was not seen in Canada sometime after late 1986, as authorities believed him to be living in Pakistan where he continued operations against India.|$|E

25|$|Byrne {{had heard}} {{movement}} in the bedroom, and asked who was in there.

Ellen Barry went in to tell the police to come out but beckoned her to go outside while they found their firearms. Byrne called for the man to come out, threatening to burn the place down if they did not. Byrne sent in Sherritt's widow and when she entered the bedroom the police grabbed her and put her underneath the bed with them.|$|E
25|$|It once {{happened}} in that country (and this seems indeed strange) that a living creature {{was caught in the}} forest as to which no one could say definitely whether <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> or some other animal; for no one could get a word from it or be sure that it understood human speech. It had the human shape, however, in every detail, both as to hands and face and feet; but the entire body was covered with hair as the beasts are, and down the back it had a long coarse mane like that of a horse, which fell to both sides and trailed along the ground when the creature stooped in walking.|$|E

Perhaps it was the first film of a new type of hominid, quite unknown to science, in which case Roger Patterson deserves to rank with Dubois, the discoverer of Pithecanthropus erectus, or Raymond Dart of Johannesburg, the man who introduced the world to its immediate human ancestor, Australopithecus africanus." ...|$|E

2500|$|An early {{interpretation}} of verse 3:55 (specifically [...] "I will {{cause you to}} die and raise you to myself"), Al-Tabari (d. 923) records an interpretation attributed to Ibn 'Abbas, who used the literal [...] "I will cause you to die" [...] (mumayyitu-ka) {{in place of the}} metaphorical mutawaffi-ka [...] "Jesus died", while Wahb ibn Munabbih, an early Jewish convert, is reported to have said [...] "God caused Jesus, son of Mary, to die for three hours during the day, then took him up to himself." [...] Tabari further transmits from Ibn Ishaq: [...] "God caused Jesus to die for seven hours", while at another place reported that a person called Sergius was crucified in place of Jesus. Ibn-al-Athir forwarded the report that it was Judas, the betrayer, while also mentioning the possibility <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> named Natlianus.|$|E
2500|$|It {{seems that}} forms of sword dancing were {{performed}} by warriors {{in many parts}} of Europe in the prehistoric period. Forms of sword dancing are also attested in the late Medieval period. Ritualistic and combative dances that imitated epic deeds and martial skills were a familiar feature in Scottish tradition and folklore. The earliest reference to these dances in Scotland is mentioned in the Scotichronicon which was compiled in Scotland by Walter Bower in the 1440s. The passage regards Alexander III and his second marriage to the French noblewoman Yolande de Dreux at Jedburgh on 14 October 1285. [...] "At the head of this procession were the skilled musicians with many sorts of pipe music including the music of bagpipes, and behind them others splendidly performing a war-dance with intricate weaving in and out. Bringing up the rear was a figure regarding whom it was difficult to decide whether <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> or an apparition. It seemed to glide like a ghost rather than walk on feet. When it looked as if he was disappearing from everyone's sight, the whole frenzied procession halted, the song died away, the music faded, and the dancing contingent froze suddenly and unexpectantly." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chauncey Yellow Robe ("Kills in the Woods") (Canowicakte) {{was born}} {{in what is now}} {{southern}} Montana around 1867, in the Sičháŋǧu Oyáte in Lakota or [...] "Burnt Thighs Nation." [...] Chauncey's father Chief Yellow Robe (Tasinagi), first known as White Thunder, assumed the name Yellow Robe name for his heroic war deeds against a Yellow Robe family of Crow Indians. [...] Tasinagi was a descendant of two famous leaders of the Sioux nation, Sitting Bull and Iron Plume. Tasinagi signed the Treaty of 1868, [...] fought in the Battle of the Little Big Horn and died in 1904 at the age of eighty-seven, Chauncey's mother Tachcawin (Deer Woman), was a niece of Sitting Bull and had seven children with Chief Yellow Robe. As a boy, Chauncey lived on the Rosebud Indian Reservation. [...] "Kills in the Woods" [...] was trained in Lakota skills of making bows and arrows, riding ponies bareback, foot racing, wrestling and swimming. [...] "Sometimes during a morning of a winter blizzard my father used to wake me up out of my warm bed of buffalo robes and dare me to go out and lay down in the deep snow and roll in it 'as I had come into the world'. This was not as a punishment, but a [...] test of endurance." [...] Chauncey did not see a white man until he was ten or eleven years old. When he did, he could not decide if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> or an animal, and as the creature approached, he decided it was an evil spirit and ran to the tipi of his father. Canowicakte spent many hours in the tipi of his grandfather and grandmother. They were his tutors in legends and history of the tribe. He was expected to memorize all these stories so that he in turn would be able to relate them to his children. [...] He was taught respect and reverence for Wakan-tanka, the Great Mystery. [...] He learned of the great and inspiring deeds of the famous chiefs, warriors and medicine men. He was trained in the old customs of how to make bows and arrows for hunting and for wars. He learned how to hunt deer and buffalo. He enjoyed wrestling, swimming and foot racing with his companions. Later in his life, Chauncey would spend many hours telling his children the Lakota tales he was told by his grandparents.|$|E
