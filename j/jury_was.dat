50|$|Blue ribbon <b>juries</b> <b>are</b> <b>juries</b> {{selected}} from prominent, well-educated citizens, sometimes {{to investigate a}} particular problem such as civic corruption.

5|$|Starting in 1877, Trial by <b>Jury</b> <b>was</b> {{often given}} at benefit performances, usually for an actor or actress {{who had fallen}} on hard times, but {{occasionally}} for other causes.

Gilbert himself played the silent role of the Associate on at least four occasions.|$|E

5|$|Barton Fink premiered in May 1991 at the Cannes Film Festival. Beating {{competition}} {{which included}} Jacques Rivette's La Belle Noiseuse, Spike Lee's Jungle Fever, and David Mamet's Homicide, the Coen brothers' film won three awards: Best Director, Best Actor, {{and the top}} prize Palme d'Or. This sweep of awards in major categories at Cannes was extremely rare, and some critics felt the <b>jury</b> <b>was</b> too generous {{to the exclusion of}} other worthy entries. Worried that the triple victory could set a precedent which would undervalue other films, Cannes decided after the 1991 festival to limit each movie to a maximum of two awards.|$|E
50|$|<b>Juries</b> <b>are</b> {{selected}} from a <b>jury</b> panel, which <b>is</b> picked at random by the county registrar from the electoral register.

5|$|In 1874, Gilbert wrote a short {{libretto}} on commission from producer-conductor Carl Rosa, {{whose wife}} would {{have played the}} leading role, but her death in childbirth cancelled the project. Not long afterwards, Richard D'Oyly Carte was managing the Royalty Theatre and needed a short opera to be played as an afterpiece to Offenbach's La Périchole. Carte knew about Gilbert's libretto for Rosa and suggested that Sullivan write a score for it. Gilbert read the piece to Sullivan in February 1875, and the composer was delighted with it; Trial by <b>Jury</b> <b>was</b> composed and staged {{in a matter of}} weeks.|$|E

5|$|On May 11, a grand <b>jury</b> <b>was</b> {{assembled}} in McLennan County and quickly returned an indictment against Washington; {{the trial was}} scheduled for May 15. The Times-Herald of Waco published a notice on May 12 requesting that residents let the justice system determine Washington's fate.

40|$|Extract:Trial by <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> today {{provided}} for both in NSW legislation {{and in the}} Commonwealth Constitution. While the <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> colourfully described, among other things, as a bulwark of liberty, Lord Devlin in his 1956 book Trial by Jury makes {{perhaps one of the}} greatest claims of a <b>jury’s</b> importance:Each <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> a little parliament. The <b>jury</b> sense <b>is</b> the parliamentary sense. I cannot see the one dying and the other surviving. The first object of any tyrant in Whitehall would be to make Parliament utterly subservient to his will; and the next to overthrow or diminish trial by jury, for no tyrant could afford to leave a subject’s freedom in the hands of twelve of his countrymen. So that trial by <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> more than an instrument of justice and more than one wheel of the constitution: it is the lamp that shows that freedom lives...|$|R
50|$|There is no Seventh Amendment {{right to}} jury trials in state courts, {{but the state}} {{provides}} for jury trials {{to the same extent}} as in federal courts. This means that <b>juries</b> <b>are</b> available to try cases at law, but usually not in equity. However, a party may request a jury to decide facts regarding the facts of an equitable matter. If the contested matter is a special plea, then the decision of the <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> binding, but where there is a conflict of evidence as to other matters, the <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> merely advisory.|$|R
5|$|On September 19, 1861, Morehead, Louisville Courier editor Reuben T. Durrett, and a {{man named}} Martin W. Barr were arrested for disloyalty. The three were taken to Indianapolis, Indiana, and the next day, Louisville circuit court judge John Catron issued a writ of habeas corpus for Morehead. On September 24, the officer who had arrested Morehead told Catron that Secretary of War Simon Cameron had already ordered Morehead taken to Fort Lafayette in New York Harbor. Shortly after this, a grand <b>jury</b> <b>was</b> convened but failed to return any charges against Morehead.|$|E
5|$|The {{court also}} ruled that {{evidence}} against Andrew Wilson, regarding other matters {{for which the}} police wanted him, was incorrectly admitted at his trial on murder charges. His case was remanded to the lower court for retrial. Andrew Wilson was convicted at his second trial in June 1988. But, after five days of deliberation, the <b>jury</b> <b>was</b> unable to agree on Wilson's eligibility for the death penalty; ten women {{were in favor of}} imposing this sentence and two men opposed it. The following month Andrew Wilson was sentenced to life imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|During the September term, a <b>jury</b> <b>was</b> finally selected, and {{the trial}} {{consumed}} {{the rest of the}} term. Much of the same evidence was presented, and the second jury also voted for a guilty verdict. The date for Desha's execution was set for July 14, 1826. Harry O. Brown, the judge in the case, had been temporarily appointed by Governor Desha to fill a vacancy. He set aside the verdict, ruling that the prosecution had failed to prove that the murder occurred in Fleming County, as charged in the indictment. The prosecution unsuccessfully argued that because a change of venue had already been granted, the place of the murder was immaterial.|$|E
50|$|In {{countries}} where <b>jury</b> trials <b>are</b> common, <b>juries</b> <b>are</b> {{often seen as}} an important check against state power. Other common assertions {{about the benefits of}} trial by <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> that it provides a means of interjecting community norms and values into judicial proceedings and that it legitimizes the law by providing opportunities for citizens to validate criminal statutes in their application to specific trials. Alexis de Tocqueville also claimed that jury trials educate citizens about self-government. Many also believe that a <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> likely to provide a more sympathetic hearing, or a fairer one, to a party who {{is not part of the}} governmentor other establishment interestthan would representatives of the state.|$|R

5|$|During the company's 1975 centennial {{performances}} of all thirteen Gilbert and Sullivan Operas at the Savoy Theatre, Trial was given four times, as a curtain raiser to The Sorcerer, Pinafore and Pirates {{and as an}} afterpiece following The Grand Duke. Before {{the first of the}} four {{performances of}} Trial, a specially written curtain raiser by William Douglas-Home, called Dramatic Licence, was played by Peter Pratt as Carte, Kenneth Sandford as Gilbert and John Ayldon as Sullivan, in which Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte plan the birth of Trial in 1875. Trial by <b>Jury</b> <b>was</b> eliminated from the D'Oyly Carte repertory in 1976 as a cost-saving measure.|$|E
5|$|Each {{member of}} a {{respective}} nation's <b>jury</b> <b>was</b> required to rank every song, except that of their own country. The voting results from each {{member of a}} particular nation's jury were combined to produce an overall ranking from first to last place. Likewise, the televoting results were also interpreted as a full ranking, {{taking into account the}} full televoting result rather than just the top ten. The combination of the jury's full ranking and the televote's full ranking produced an overall ranking of all competing entries. The song which scored the highest overall rank received 12 points, while the tenth-best ranked song received 1-point. In the event of a televoting(insufficient amount of votes/technical issues) or jury failure(technical issue/breach of rules), only a jury/televoting was used by each country.|$|E
5|$|Given Huskisson's importance, and the {{potential}} impact {{on the future of}} Liverpool and Manchester's industries and on the embryonic railway industry of any findings of liability {{on the part of the}} railway, a swift determination of the causes of the accident was considered essential.

The coroner himself, MrMilne, arrived at 10.00am and was in a hurry to proceed as he had another inquest scheduled that afternoon, but proceedings were unable to begin as Lord Wilton, the only sworn witness scheduled to attend the inquest, could not be found. In the meantime, Milne sent the jury to the vicarage to view Huskisson's body.|$|E
