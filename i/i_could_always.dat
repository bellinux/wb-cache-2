500|$|Early on, {{the team}} decided {{that rather than}} rely on old Halo themes, ODST would feature all-new music. [...] "It was a bit intimidating at first," [...] Salvatori recalled, [...] "because in {{previous}} Halo games if new ideas weren't coming, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>always</b> dust off an old one {{and give it a}} new spin. I was afraid that we might hit some writer's block along the way, but that didn't happen at all. Instead, we had the freedom to explore some new musical territory, and the ideas flowed pretty quickly." [...] With the exception of the main player character, O'Donnell and Salvatori did not compose themes to represent characters. While the game's setting in Africa inspired some percussion pieces, the team was interested in a sparser atmosphere, which Salvatori described as [...] "a bit darker and less epic".|$|E
500|$|Despite Kemp's {{return from}} injury {{and the arrival}} of running back O. J. Simpson, the Bills only {{compiled}} a 4–10 record during the 1969 season under new coach John Rauch. Kemp was named an AFL All-Star in 1969 for the seventh time in the league's 10 years. He advocated recognition of the league, and in its last year, 1969, lobbied Pete Rozelle to have AFL teams wear an AFL patch to honor it. In 1969, the Erie County Republican Party approached him about running for the United States Congress. After the January 17, 1970, AFL All-Star game, Kemp returned home and talked to his wife before deciding to enter politics. Kemp said, [...] "I had a four-year no-cut contract with the Bills at the time. ...I figured that if I lost <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>always</b> come back and play. But the fans had their say and I was elected to Congress." ...|$|E

Gates remained in contact with Paul Allen, and he joined him at Honeywell during the summer of 1974. [...] The MITS Altair 8800 was released the following year. [...] The new computer was based on the Intel 8080 CPU, and Gates and Allen saw this as the opportunity to start their own computer software company. [...] Gates dropped out of Harvard at this time. He had talked over this decision with his parents, who were supportive of him after seeing how much their son wanted to start his own company.

500|$|Paul Allen {{was born}} on January 21, 1953, in Seattle, Washington, to Kenneth Sam Allen and Edna Faye (née Gardner) Allen. Allen {{attended}} Lakeside School, a private school in Seattle, where he befriended Bill Gates, three years younger, with whom he shared an enthusiasm for computers. They used Lakeside's Teletype terminal to develop their programming skills on several time-sharing computer systems. They also used the laboratory of the Computer Science Department of the University of Washington; {{on at least one}} occasion in 1971 they were banned from the laboratory for abuse of their privileges there. After obtaining a perfect SAT score of 1600 and graduation, Allen went to Washington State University, where he joined Phi Kappa Theta fraternity, but dropped out after two years in order to work as a programmer for Honeywell in Boston, near where Bill Gates had ended up as well. Allen later convinced Gates to drop out of Harvard University in order to create Microsoft. [...] Gates explained his official status with Harvard that, [...] "... if things [...] hadn't worked out, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>always</b> go back to school. [...] I was officially on [...] leave [...]" ...|$|E

I owe so much to him it's {{impossible}} to express"; and has (years after Taylor's book) published an autobiographical account Red and Me the subject of which is his lifelong friendship with Auerbach. Bill Bradley for the New York Times Book Review wrote of Red and Me [...] "Bill Russell is a private, complex man, but {{on the subject of}} his love of Red Auerbach and his Celtic teammates, he’s loud and clear." [...] In the book itself Russell wrote [...] "Whenever I leave the Celtics locker room, even Heaven wouldn't be good enough because anywhere else is a step down... With Red [...] and Walter Brown, I was the freest athlete on the planet. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>always</b> be myself with them and they were always there for me." [...] Describing the Celtics organization (as distinguished from Boston sports fans in the 1950s and 1960s) as very progressive racially, Russell in 2010 recalled a list of the organization’s accomplishments on racial progress both in terms of objective milestones and his own subjective experience {{as a member of the}} organization: ...|$|E

The House agreed a motion proposed by Premier Richard Seddon: [...] "to record its high sense of the faithful services rendered to the House of Representatives during thirty-five years by the late Mr George Friend, as Clerk-Assistant and Clerk of the House of Representatives". As a mark of respect the House then adjourned without dealing with any further business. Friend's widow and daughter received a compassionate grant from the government of 900 pounds (about a year's salary).|$|E

[...] "I'd go home and be a one girl circus, taking the parts of everyone I'd seen, living them before the glass."
