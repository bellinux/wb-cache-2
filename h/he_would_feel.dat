5|$|As The World Ends with You {{focuses on}} the {{character}} of Neku Sakuraba, {{in order to create a}} believable story the developers put a lot of focus on his development, such as how <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel,</b> what thoughts lie behind his actions, how he interacted with other characters, and how the people around him feel about him. The developers included aspects and daily concerns, hoping that they could be things that players would have to deal with their personal lives and therefore would let them relate with Neku.|$|E

25|$|In September 1848, Douglass {{published}} {{an open letter}} addressed to his former master, Thomas Auld, berating him for his conduct, and enquiring after {{members of his family}} still held by Auld. In a graphic passage, Douglass asked Auld how <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> if Douglass had come to take away his daughter Amanda as a slave, treating her the way he and members of his family had been treated by Auld.|$|E

25|$|Okada {{is known}} for being reserved. He does not meet with many people within the agency. In an {{interview}} on Shōnen Club Premium, Okada {{said that when he}} was little, whenever his name was called up to read something in class, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> like vomiting and purposely avoided school on those days. Within V6, he is also the most quiet person. He enjoys carpentry and has carved wooden bears for children.|$|E
25|$|Nimoy {{has said}} that the {{character}} of Spock, which he played twelve to fourteen hours a day, five days a week, influenced his personality in private life. Each weekend during the original run of the series, he would be in character throughout Saturday and into Sunday, behaving more like Spock than himself—more logical, more rational, more thoughtful, less emotional and finding a calm in every situation. It was only on Sunday in the early afternoon that Spock's influence on his behavior would fade off and <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> more himself again—only to start the cycle over again on Monday morning. Years after the show he observed Vulcan speech patterns, social attitudes, patterns of logic, and emotional suppression in his own behavior.|$|E
25|$|Shi Yi {{was known}} for leading a frugal and humble lifestyle. Unlike many other officials, he did not {{accumulate}} wealth for his family and never accepted financial aid from others. He was content with having only basic necessities. Sun Quan once went {{on a tour of}} Shi Yi's neighbourhood and saw a large mansion. When he asked who the owner of the mansion was, someone told him it was Shi Yi. However, Sun Quan said that it was definitely not Shi Yi, given his lifestyle. He was proven right. Shi Yi wore very simple clothing and had simple meals every day. He also enjoyed helping the needy so he often donated or gave away his personal savings to the poor. When Sun Quan heard about it, he visited Shi Yi's house and sampled the meals Shi Yi had every day. After the visit, he increased Shi Yi's salary, gave him more rewards and a larger plot of land. However, Shi Yi rejected these rewards and gifts and said that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> uneasy if he accepted them.|$|E

500|$|During the {{serialization}} of the manga, Tite Kubo said {{he received}} a letter from a reader who decided to name his son [...] "Ichigo". This brought joy as well as fear to the manga artist due to how his work influenced other people. While feeling that he also made a good manga during this comment, Kubo decided to work more on the character in hopes that once the real Ichigo grows up, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> proud with his name.|$|E
500|$|Politically, the {{new king}} {{took steps to}} {{conclude}} the protracted constitutional deliberations of the Assembly. On 19 October 1864, he sent the Assembly a demand, countersigned by Constantine Kanaris, explaining that he had accepted the crown on the understanding that a new constitution would be finalized, and {{that if it was}} not <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> himself at [...] "perfect liberty to adopt such measures as the disappointment of my hopes may suggest". It was unclear from the wording whether he meant to return to Denmark or impose a constitution, but as either event was undesirable the Assembly soon came to an agreement.|$|E
500|$|For {{most of the}} meeting, {{both sides}} were cordial. But when Lord Howe {{expressed}} that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> America's loss [...] "like {{the loss of a}} brother", Franklin informed him that [...] "we will do our utmost endeavors to save your lordship that mortification." [...] Lord Howe unhappily stated he could not view the American delegates as anything but British subjects, to which Adams replied, [...] "Your lordship may consider me in what light you please, [...] except that of a British subject." [...] Lord Howe then spoke past Adams to Franklin and Rutledge, stating, [...] "Mr. Adams appears to be a decided character." ...|$|E

50|$|López was {{claimed by}} the San Diego Padres, but he {{rejected}} the claim to become a free agent and signed with the Boston Red Sox, because <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>feel</b> {{a part of the}} team as <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be ineligible for the Padres post-season roster. On September 28 López made his debut with the Red Sox.|$|R

500|$|Beadle {{arranged}} [...] "talks about talks" [...] {{between the}} British and Rhodesian governments during 1966, {{which led to}} Smith and Wilson meeting personally aboard HMS Tiger off Gibraltar between 2 and 4 December. Beadle had to be hoisted aboard because of a back injury. Negotiations snagged primarily over {{the matter of the}} transition. Wilson insisted on the abandonment of the 1965 constitution, the dissolution of the post-UDI government and a period under a British Governor—conditions that Smith saw as tantamount to surrender, particularly as the British proposed to draft and introduce the new constitution only after a fresh test of opinion under UK control. Indeed, Smith had warned Beadle before the summit that unless he [...] "could assure his people that a reasonable constitution had been agreed", <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> unable to settle. Smith said he could not agree without first consulting his ministers in Salisbury, infuriating Wilson, who declared that a central condition of the talks had been that he and Smith would have plenipotentiary powers to make a deal.|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} episode, the Eleventh Doctor still wears his {{previous}} incarnation's costume, but costume designer Ray Holman {{stated that the}} costume was broken down and distressed. Over {{the course of the}} first episode, he would find his own identity and pick out his defining costume. Smith tried {{on a wide variety of}} things to find a look <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> comfortable and confident in and would identify his Doctor. Smith brought in braces and a tweed jacket; Holman believed that the tweed jacket was [...] "a bit old for him" [...] but showed that he was a [...] "professor and student at the same time" [...] and gave him [...] "that quality that the Doctor's still learning, but also has some authority". Smith suggested a bow tie, which Holman and others did not approve of, but once he had put it on they decided they had the costume. Smith stated he was inspired by the Second Doctor's costume after watching The Tomb of the Cybermen. Other influences included the [...] "element of a professor" [...] and [...] "big, dusty boots like Indiana Jones". The men's clothing store Topman reported that their bow tie sales had risen 94% for the month of April 2010, connected to when the series began airing.|$|E
500|$|Korn {{begins with}} [...] "Blind", {{starting}} with the dueling riffs of James Shaffer and Brian Welch. Lead vocalist Jonathan Davis' first line is [...] "Are you ready?!", which {{is now one of}} the band's trademarks. [...] "Blind" [...] is about Davis' drug problems (mostly amphetamines) and how <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> scattered when he was under the influence. Davis told Metal Hammer that on the album's second track, [...] "Ball Tongue", he [...] "didn't sing a goddamn word in that song. I couldn't describe what I wanted to do, so that's how it came out. It's a really heavy sound." [...] "Ball Tongue" [...] is about a man had to work with Korn on a T-shirt design. He either had a pierced tongue or had a wart on his tongue and he gave Korn a really hard time. [...] "Shoots and Ladders" [...] is about how many nursery rhymes have dark meanings. The song explores the concept of nursery rhymes. Davis relates: [...] "'Shoots and Ladders' uncovers the hidden messages in nursery rhymes, the first songs many of us ever hear. 'Shoots and Ladders', to set the record straight, calls out nursery rhymes for what they really are. I choose each rhyme for a different reason—'Baa Baa Black Sheep' has racist overtones. 'London Bridge' talks of all the people of London dying (from the Black Plague, as does 'Ring Around the Roses'). Then there's 'Little Red Riding Hood'—one story tells of the wolf raping Red Riding Hood and killing her." ...|$|E
25|$|Sidney's {{reputation}} {{suffered a}} blow when Sir John Dalrymple published his Memoirs of Great Britain and Ireland in 1771, which exposed {{him as a}} pensioner of Louis XIV.

50|$|Ellis {{was deeply}} {{influenced}} by his father, {{who died at}} the age of 48. In his recorded memoir, he described his impoverished childhood and the worn clothes that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> wear to school. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> often <b>feel</b> embarrassed about how he and his father looked in public. Although his father drank, Ellis describes the close relationship the two shared by going to ball games and fishing.|$|R

2500|$|Winnicott {{thought that}} the [...] "False Self" [...] {{developed}} {{through a process of}} introjection, (a concept developed early on by Freud) in or internalising one's experience of others. Instead of basing his personality on his own unforced feelings, thoughts, and initiatives, the person with a [...] "False Self" [...] disorder would essentially be imitating and internalising other people's behaviour a mode in which he could outwardly come to seem [...] "just like" [...] his mother, father, brother, nurse, or whoever had dominated his world, but inwardly <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> bored, empty, dead, or [...] "phoney." [...] Winnicott saw this as an unconscious process: not only others but also the person himself would mistake his False Self for his real personality. But even with the appearance of success, and of social gains, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> unreal and lack the sense of [...] really being alive or happy.|$|E
2500|$|Walter Bagehot of The Economist {{newspaper}} in London {{argued that the}} new nation should be called 'Northland' or 'Anglia' instead of Canada. On these names, the statesman Thomas D'Arcy McGee commented, [...] "Now I would ask any honourable member of the House how <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> if he woke up some fine morning and found himself, instead of a Canadian, a Tuponian or a Hochelegander?".|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked in}} March 2011, Cain stated that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>feel</b> {{comfortable}} appointing a Muslim to his administration, or {{as a judge}} [...] saying: [...] "No, I will not ... There's this creeping attempt, there's this attempt, to gradually ease Shariah Law, and the Muslim faith into our government. It does not belong in our government" ...|$|R
6000|$|It was Soapy's {{design to}} {{assume the role of}} the despicable and execrated [...] "masher."

60|$|On the {{way back}} to their hotel, March made some {{reflections}} upon the open neglect, throughout Germany, of the greatest German lyrist, by which the poet might have profited if he had been present. He contended that it was not altogether an effect of Hohenzollern pride, which could not suffer a joke or two from the arch-humorist; but that Heine had said things of Germany herself which Germans might well have found unpardonable. He concluded that it would not do to be perfectly frank with one's own country. Though, to be sure, there would always be the question whether the Jew-born Heine had even a step-fatherland in the Germany he loved so tenderly and mocked so pitilessly. He had to own that if he were a negro poet <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>feel</b> bound to measure terms in speaking of America, and <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>feel</b> that his fame was in her keeping.|$|R
2500|$|The Salty Peppers' second single, [...] "Uh Huh Yeah", did not fare as well, and Maurice {{moved from}} Chicago to Los Angeles. He then {{added to the}} band singer Sherry Scott and percussionist Yackov Ben Israel, both from Chicago, and then asked his younger brother Verdine how <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> about heading out to the West Coast. On June 6, 1970, Verdine left Chicago to join the band as their new bassist. Maurice began {{shopping}} demo tapes of the band, featuring Donny Hathaway, around to different record labels and the band was thus signed to Warner Bros. Records.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2014 {{interview}} on the LBC radio station, Farage said that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> [...] "concerned" [...] if {{a group of}} Romanian men moved next door to him. When interviewer James O'Brien inquired {{what would be the}} difference between Romanian men moving next door and a group of German children, in reference to Farage's German wife and children, Farage replied: [...] "You know the difference." [...] He later expanded on this on the UKIP website, explaining that [...] "if we were able to operate a proper work permit scheme for Romanian nationals, with suitable checks, as recommended by UKIP, then nobody would need to be concerned if a group of Romanian nationals moved in next door to them." ...|$|E

If that is {{entertainment}} to you, well, that's OK. If you think that it enlightened you, well, that's even better. If you wonder if he's gone to Heaven or Hell, rest assured he will check out them both, find out which one Richard Milhous Nixon went to— and go there. He could never stand being bored.

Ulam's sparkling manners were diametrically opposite to Birkhoff's hard-working, aggressive, touchy personality. Birkhoff tried to keep Ulam at Harvard, but his colleagues balked at the idea." ...|$|R
