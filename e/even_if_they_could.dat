It also provided instructions for performing the ritual dry ablution (tayammum) when ritually pure water was not available, to replace the ritual ablution (wudu) that is ordinarily required before performing the salat. When tayammum was not possible, even making slight pointing motions with hands or face toward clean earth, stone, or tree was acceptable.|$|E

500|$|Blow {{recognized}} that the puzzles in Braid had a range of difficulties, with some puzzles being more difficult for certain players than others, {{and did not have}} any set difficulty curve.

The procession of citizens shaking hands with their President was interrupted when 12-year-old Myrtle Ledger of Spring Brook, New York, who was accompanied by her mother, asked McKinley for the red carnation he always wore on his lapel.

[...] The usual rule that those who approached the President must do so with their hands open and empty was not being enforced, perhaps due to the heat of the day, as several people were using handkerchiefs to wipe their brows; the man who followed the swarthy individual had his right hand wrapped in one, as if injured. [...] Seeing this, McKinley reached for his left hand instead.

He also formulated a general defence for religious toleration in his Letters Concerning Toleration. Three arguments are central: (1) Earthly judges, the state in particular, and human beings generally, cannot dependably evaluate the truth-claims of competing religious standpoints; (2) <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could,</b> enforcing a single [...] "true religion" [...] would not have the desired effect, because belief cannot be compelled by violence; (3) Coercing religious uniformity would lead to more social disorder than allowing diversity.|$|E
50|$|Old Highfield was {{established}} in the 1930s, and it comprises 3 distinct areas, namely The 2 Pounds, 5 Pounds, 12 Pounds and The Stands. The most affluent parts of Highfield are the two areas of Old Highfield; The Stands and the 5 Pounds. The Stands are so named because when first sold, the area was a greenfield and residents had to build houses of their choices; this is in comparison to the other areas of Highfield where the government had built low-cost basic housing for the natives and sold it at reflective prices. Historically, the yards here are very large and the houses, flamboyant and indulgent to reflect the affluent status of the black Rhodesians who settled here. Black Rhodesians who, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> afforded, <b>could</b> not buy properties outside African designated areas, naturally settled there. Some of the famous Zimbabweans to own properties here include musician Innocent Utsiwegota's family, the Mwaera family, the Tawengwa family and Robert Mugabe. The 5 Pounds area is so named because the houses here were priced at 5 Rhodesian pounds when first sold, compared to the average of 2 pounds in other areas as reflected in the 2 Pounds name. The 2 Pounds area is relatively deprived in comparison to the other two.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{claims that}} Maxwell's {{fish-eye}} {{is a perfect}} lens, capable of providing images with deep subwavelength resolution, are examined. We show that the imaging properties of a dispersionless fish-eye {{are very similar to}} those of an ideal spherical cavity. Using this correspondence, we prove that the correct solution to Maxwell equations in the fish-eye gives image sizes that are consistent with the standard diffraction limit. Perfect focusing is an optical illusion that results from placing a time-reversed source at the position of the geometrical image which, when combined with the field due to the primary (object) source, mimics the behavior of a perfect drain. Issues of causality are briefly discussed. We also demonstrate that passive outlets are not a good alternative to time-reversed sources for broadband drain-like behavior and that, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not do a better job than conventional optical systems at providing high resolution...|$|R
40|$|The {{two most}} famous cryptosystems DES and AES had both been broken by both brute-force (EFF) and linear {{cryptanalysis}} (M. Matsui), {{and by a}} timing attack (D. J.

2500|$|Concepts of {{the body}} and of disease used in TCM have notions of a pre-scientific culture, similar to European humoral theory. TCM is {{characterized}} as full of pseudoscience. Some practitioners no longer consider yin and yang and the idea of an energy flow to apply. Scientific investigation has not found any histological or physiological evidence for traditional Chinese concepts such as qi, meridians, and acupuncture points. It is a generally held belief within the acupuncture community that acupuncture points and meridians structures are special conduits for electrical signals but no research has established any consistent anatomical structure or function for either acupuncture points or meridians. The scientific evidence for the anatomical existence of either meridians or acupuncture points is not compelling.

30|$|A {{strength}} {{of this study is}} the use of the CarerQoL- 7 D instrument to measure the CarerQoL of the informal caregivers. In contrast to the first limitation given above, a cross-sectional study is the primary source of evidence for measuring this construct. The great benefit of the CarerQoL- 7 D instrument over earlier studies that measured the burden on informal caregivers {{is the fact that it}} can measure positive dimensions as well as the burden, such as satisfaction and support received from others. In this study, informal caregivers experienced considerable support and satisfaction, in agreement with informal caregivers in other populations [31]. In total, 79.5 % of caregivers stated that their well-being would remain the same or <b>even</b> decrease <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> give the informal care tasks free of charge to another person chosen by them and the patient, despite the time investment and mental and physical burden of informal care. This is also reflected in the result from the ‘satisfaction’ and ‘support’ domains in the CarerQoL- 7 D. Another strength, in contrast with Van Dam et al., is that we included caregivers from a homogenous group of 123 hip fracture patients. As we mentioned before, an important aspect is to properly educate informal caregivers about the expected course of recovery. This aspect depends on the study population and is more difficult in a heterogeneous geriatric population that includes stroke, elective, trauma and other patients than in our study, which included caregivers of patients with a hip fracture.|$|R
