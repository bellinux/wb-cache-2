40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to identify factors influencing incomesmoothing. Income smoothing is an active manipulation of earnings toward apredetermined target. The target may be set by the management, requested bythe analysts, or expected by a particular group of stakeholders (Chong, 2006). The factors being examined were size of the company, company’s profitabilityratios, company’s financial leverage <b>ratios,</b> company’s <b>institutional</b> ownershipratio and auditor reputation. Index Eckel is used to determine the incomesmoothing practices. The sample of 41 manufacturers listed on Indonesian StockExchange, during a period between 2004 - 2008. The hypothesis were tested using binary logistic regression. The firsthypothesis was formulated to consisted examine the effect of size of thecompany on income smoothing. The second hypothesis was formulated toexamine the effect of company’s profitability ratios on income smoothing Thethird hypothesis was to examine the effect of company’s financial leverage onincome smoothing. The fourth hypothesis was formulated to examine the effect ofcompany’s <b>institutional</b> ownership <b>ratio</b> on income smoothing.

40|$|A unique {{mathematical}} formula {{was developed}} to use for journal deselection decisions. The formula factors in subscription cost, shelving and storage cost, interlibrary loan cost, staffing cost, and use level to determine the institutional cost ratio; this ratio serves {{as an indicator of}} the cost-effectiveness of each subscription title. Once the <b>institutional</b> cost <b>ratio</b> was calculated for each of 537 titles, a committee of library staff and senior library customers reviewed the ranked list to decide which subscriptions should be canceled. The committee also considered possible exceptions based on subjective criteria such as availability at local libraries, unrecorded use, and relative importance of the journal. The preliminary cancellation list was then reviewed by the library's research users. They were able to justify library subscriptions to a few additional titles. This method enabled the library to cut its subscription costs by 46 %, while cutting only 8 % of the total use. In addition, by mediating the mathematical approach with human intervention, the library made these severe cuts without unduly distressing its patrons...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} the study was to provide {{empirical}} support for the Miller model. The paper proposes the use of the ratio of individual to institutional holdings as a proxy for heterogeneous expectations of security returns. Design/methodology/approach – Both bivariate t-tests and regression analysis were used to test whether optimistic valuations existed for stocks with high levels of institutional ownership. Data on open short positions were collected and hypothesized to decrease with the level of <b>institutional</b> holdings. High <b>ratio</b> stocks were compared to glamor stocks and low ratio stocks to value stocks. Findings – For stocks with higher institutional ownership, optimistic valuations dominated resulting in significantly lower future security returns than for stocks with higher individual ownership thereby supporting the Miller model. The results were not sensitive to variations in size, momentum, and book-to-market ratios. Further support for the Miller model was provided by the finding that open short positions decreased with the level of <b>institutional</b> holdings. High <b>ratio</b> stocks resembled glamor stocks and low ratio stocks corresponded to value stocks. Research limitations/implications – This study is limited to the ultra-short term period of one month after portfolio creation. Future research should extend it to the three-to-five year time horizon. Practical implications – Ultra-short term investors should hold value stocks, intermediate three- 12 month investors should hold glamor stocks, and long-term investors should hold value stocks.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the performance and pricing efficiency of the Dow Jones DJIM Turkey Exchange Traded Fund (DJIMTR), the world's first exchange-traded fund launched to track an Islamic market index. Using the daily data set, it is found that relative to its traditional index fund counterpart, DJIMTR tracks the benchmark index with a lower tracking error; thus reflecting the performance of the benchmark index more effectively. Our performance proxies, mean returns and risk adjusted returns, also demonstrate that DJIMTR outperforms its traditional index fund counterpart. In addition, as a result of various tests performed through VAR models, it is found that pricing deviation in the DJIMTR is of a temporary nature, meaning that 'the DJIMTR is efficiently priced'. In the regression model, the significant factors that explain transient premiums' size are identified as transaction cost, trading volume, intraday volatility and <b>institutional</b> ownership <b>ratio.</b> The results of the study are expected to provide new insights for founders who are planning to create mutual funds to track Islamic market indexes and to guide individual investors targeting Islamic indexes in their investment decisions.

40|$|The {{diversity}} of US {{institutions of higher}} education is manifested in many ways. This study looks at that diversity from the economic perspective by studying the subsidy structure through the distribution of <b>institutional</b> price-cost <b>ratio</b> (PCR), defined as the sum of net tuition price divided by total supplier cost and equals to one minus subsidy-cost ratio (SCR). IPEDS Finance, Enrollment, and Institutional Characteristics survey data for academic year 2006 - 2007 are used. Significant between-sector differences are found in terms of both central locations and ranges of PCR. Public two-year institutions have the lowest average PCR (0. 12) and smallest within-group variation while for-profit four-year institutions have the highest average PCR (0. 93). The within-group variations are quite large for both private nonprofit and for-profit sectors. Nine types of subsidy structure are constructed and used to categorize institutions, which reveal considerable overlapping between public and private nonprofit sectors and between private nonprofit and for-profit sectors. Private nonprofit sector is consistently shown as the "hybrid" sector with more similarities to the public sector. This study highlights price-cost ratio as an important metric for economics of higher education because it integrates targeted price adjustments (list price - net price) and general subsidy (supplier cost - list price), allows for negative subsidy, and accounts for cost variations. It succinctly provides a holistic view of the subsidy-profit spectrum and serves the purpose to rectify the currently skewed perspective that predominantly focuses on "student aid" (redefined as "targeted price adjustments") {{and for the most part}} excludes the for-profit sector. A byproduct of this study is a detailed account of how to adjust new GASB/FASB-based IPEDS Finance data to derive meaningful price and cost measures to support cross-sector comparison...|$|R

The results of the multivariate meta-analysis indicate that hedging firms are larger companies with lower level of financial liquidity and higher dividend payouts than non-hedging firms.  In comparison to existing reviews by Aretz and Bartram (2010) and Arnold et al. (2014), we can conclude that univariate meta-analysis tends to overestimate results, since this approach neglects the dependencies among the proxy variables and does not allow to investigate the heterogeneity among the effect estimates. For this reason, {{the results of our}} multivariate meta-analysis do not confirm their results, for example, regarding the impact of leverage <b>ratio,</b> <b>institutional</b> investors, and profitability on corporate hedging decisions. In addition to the multivariate meta-analysis, we also conduct a meta-regression analysis to explore the heterogeneity between the estimates reported in primary studies. Here, we find that studies analyzing firms from North America report, on average, a lower impact of leverage on the corporate hedging decision. Moreover, studies examining more recent data samples tend to find a weaker relation between tangible assets and hedging, R&D and hedging respectively.|$|R

We analyzed the determinants of presidential turnover between 1990 and 2013 for a random sample of 500 firms listed on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Though our analysis found that presidential turnover sensitivity to corporate performance has not changed, we did show that ROE and the stock return are displacing ROA as corporate performance indices to which presidential turnover is most sensitive. Furthermore, while presidential turnover sensitivity to ROA is highest in firms that are believed to be most under the influence of main banks, firms with high foreign <b>institutional</b> investor shareholding <b>ratios</b> are more sensitive to ROE. These results are consistent with the curtailment in the scope of main bank activity and the increase in foreign institutional investors that have occurred since {{the latter half of the}} 1990 s.

Twelve districts were selected from the 52 districts in South Africa, {{based on the number}} of maternal deaths, the <b>institutional</b> maternal mortality <b>ratio</b> and the stillbirth rate for the district. METHODS. All community health centres (CHCs) and district, regional and tertiary hospitals were visited and detailed information was obtained on the ability of the facility to perform the basic (BEmONC) and comprehensive (CEmONC) emergency obstetric and neonatal care signal functions. RESULTS. Fifty-three CHCs, 63 district hospitals (DHs), 13 regional hospitals and 4 tertiary hospitals were assessed. None of the CHCs could perform all seven BEmONC signal functions; the majority could not give parenteral antibiotics (68 %), perform manual removal of the placenta (58 %), do an assisted delivery (98 %) or perform manual vacuum aspiration of the uterus in a woman with an uncomplicated incomplete miscarriage (96 %). Seventeen per cent of CHCs could not bag-and-mask ventilate a neonate. Less than half (48 %) of the DHs could perform all nine CEmONC signal functions (81 % could perform eight of the nine functions), 24 % could not perform caesarean sections, and 30 % could not perform assisted deliveries.

40|$|BACKGROUND. In {{order to}} reduce {{maternal}} mortality in South Africa (SA), {{it is important to}} understand the process of obstetric care, identify weaknesses within the system, and implement interventions for improving care. OBJECTIVE. To determine the spectrum of maternal morbidity and mortality in the Pretoria Academic Complex (PAC), SA. METHODS. A descriptive population-based study that included all women delivering in the PAC. The World Health Organization definition, criteria and indicators of near miss and maternal death were used to identify women with severe complications in pregnancy. RESULTS. Between 1 August 2013 and 31 July 2014, there were 26 614 deliveries in the PAC. The <b>institutional</b> maternal mortality <b>ratio</b> was 71. 4 / 100 000 live births. The HIV infection rate was 19. 9 %, and 2. 7 % of women had unknown HIV status. Of the women, 1 120 (4. 2 %) developed potentially life-threatening conditions and 136 (0. 5 %) life-threatening conditions. The mortality index was 14. 0 % overall, 30. 0 % for non-pregnancy-related infections, 2. 0 % for obstetric haemorrhage and 13. 6 % for hypertension. Of the women with life-threatening conditions, 39. 3 % were referred from the primary level of care. Vascular, uterine and coagulation dysfunctions were the most frequent organ dysfunctions in women with life-threatening conditions. The perinatal mortality rate was 26. 9 / 1 000 births overall, 23. 1 / 1 000 for women with non-life-threatening conditions, and 198. 0 / 1 000 for women with life-threatening conditions. CONCLUSION. About one in 20 pregnant women in the PAC had a potentially life-threatening condition; 39. 3 % of women presented to a primary level facility as an acute emergency and had to be transferred for tertiary care. All healthcare professionals involved in maternity care must have knowledge and skills that equip them to manage obstetric emergencies. Review of the basic antenatal care protocol may be necessary.

Methods: The matemal mortality ratio (MMR) by age and parity was calculated for matemal deaths divided by live newborns in the same period collected from the delivery room record book of HCM. Analysis of the circumstances of death, antenatal care, care in other health centres and in the HCM was carried out in order to detect any avoidable factor. Matemal deaths due to malaria were assessed by clinical audit and autopsy results and the proportion of these deaths to all maternal deaths were estimated. Maternal deaths among adolescents were compared with those of non-adolescents. The Department of Forensic Medicine at HCM, provided data on all autopsies performed during 1991 - 1995, in women of reproductive age. Data from maternal deaths occurring in HCM during the period 1989 - 1993 was used to compare the characteristics of women suffering a maternal death with those of women suffering a pregnancy-related death due to violence. To estimate the trends in matemal mortality in HCM, a retrospective study on matemal deaths occurring during the period of 1997 - 1999 was performed and MMR compared to the corresponding figure in the period 1989 to 1993. Results: During the period 1989 - 1993 a total of 239 matemal deaths identified at HCM gave a MMR of 320 per 100, 000 live births. The main cause of matemal death, all ages, was haemorrhage, (27 %). Malaria contributed with 37 cases to matemal mortality (16 %). Associated with anaemia the contribution grows to 21 % of all maternal deaths. Adolescent deaths comprised 52 / 239 matemal deaths (22 %). The main causes of adolescent death were malaria (27 %), pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) and eclampsia (21 %), puerperal sepsis (15 %), and septic abortion (10 %). A higher proportion of adolescents than non- adolescents died from abortion, spontaneous or provoked, (29 % versus 15 %, p< 0. 01) and in the second trimester of pregnancy (23 % versus 11 %, p< 0. 05). Only half the adolescent maternal deaths were booked for antenatal care (29152, 56 %). Fewer adolescent women (2 %), than non-adolescent women (12 %), p< 0. 01, were classified as "at risk" in antenatal cards. The audit classified as avoidable 78 % of all matemal deaths. Twenty-seven pregnancy-related deaths due to injuries were identified during the period 1991 - 95. Induced abortion was clearly an underlying contributing factor in almost one fifth of violence-related maternal deaths. <b>Institutional</b> matemal mortality <b>ratio</b> showed a significant numerical increase from 320 to 432 per 100, 000 livebirths, from the first (1989 - 93) to the second period (1997 - 99), respectively (p= 0. 002). Compared with non-adolescents, adolescents showed a 30 % increase in the risk of dying from complications of pregnancy in HCM. The institutional abortion- related MMR showed an increase from 24 to 53 per 100, 000 livebirths, between first and second period (p= 0. 013). Conclusions: Lack of transport and poor quality of antenatal and intrapartum care in peripheral maternity units implied that women with complications arrived late. Risk factors used in antenatal cards to classify women "at risk" show a low sensitivity to prevent maternal death. The study addresses the need of malaria prophylaxis for certain categories of pregnant women such as adolescent primigravidae and HIV-positive pregnant women. Unsafe abortion is an important cause of death in adolescents. Screening for domestic violence should be introduced in antenatal and post-abortion care. The study has demonstrated a trend of increasing maternal mortality ratios in HCM. Family planning, sex education, adequate antenatal services, improving the access to abortion services, and strengthen the emergency obstetric care are suggested for a successful Safe Motherhood programme in Maputo...|$|R

Esta tese, iniciada como estudo no Programa de PÃs-GraduaÃÃo em EducaÃÃo da Universidade Federal do CearÃ (UFC), procura abordar esse problema como categoria central, para propor, por meio das categorias de anÃlise AvaliaÃÃo, Planejamento e Sinaes, um modelo de desenvolvimento institucional que venha a indicar como pressuposto, para alÃm da qualidade das dimensÃes da universidade baseada no Sistema Nacional de AvaliaÃÃo da EducaÃÃo Superior (Sinaes), a sua pertinÃncia social. Com essa intenÃÃo, buscaram-se, nas missÃes enunciadas pelas universidades brasileiras, os principais referentes, enquanto elementos, funÃÃes ou estruturas, os quais foram organizados em vinte categorias de anÃlise, possibilitando, assim, caracterizar a universidade brasileira contemporÃnea com base em sua missÃo enquanto razÃo de ser institucional. Nessa anÃlise, constatou-se que, com maior frequÃncia a universidade brasileira se caracteriza por oferecer Ensino, Pesquisa e ExtensÃo, Saber & Conhecimento e FormaÃÃo HumanÃstica & Profissiona, com os propÃsitos de: Desenvolvimento & Progresso, Sociedade & Comunidade, InclusÃo Social & Cidadania. Com base nessa compreensÃo do campo temÃtico, pela multirreferencialidade e pela transdisciplinaridade, caracterizou-se o processo de desenvolvimento institucional da universidade e seus obstÃculos, chegando-se Ãs concepÃÃes de sociedade, sujeito e instituiÃÃo, para propor um modelo em que fosse superado o {{principal}} obstÃculo ao desenvolvimento institucional, identificado como a desarticulaÃÃo entre os macroprocessos de avaliaÃÃo e planejamento institucional. Para contextualizar a educaÃÃo no mundo e no Brasil, foram analisados os indicadores da OrganizaÃÃo para CooperaÃÃo e Desenvolvimento EconÃmico, consignados no relatÃrio Education at a Glance: lndicators Report OECD 2007, com base no modelo CIPP, proposto por Stufflebeam, com resultados apresentados na forma de tabelas, diagramas e grÃficos. Assim, o modelo proposto Ã uma primeira aproximaÃÃo para anÃlise do desenvolvimento institucional da universidade brasileira contemporÃnea, numa perspectiva sÃcio-histÃrica, organizada pelas anÃlises sistÃmica, crÃtica e institucional, que constatou ser a cultura o principal fator nesse fenÃmeno; nÃo haver apenas um Ãnico modelo para o desenvolvimento institucional da universidade; ser necessÃria uma missÃo, como razÃo para aÃÃo, capaz de orientar a universidade, seu corpo social e seu projeto polÃtico e pedagÃgico nas seguintes direÃÃes: do sistema econÃmico Ã sociedade; da organizaÃÃo Ã instituiÃÃo; do indivÃduo-agente ao sujeito-cidadÃo. Uma missÃo que reoriente seus objetivos e projetos institucionais para alÃm do ensino, da pesquisa e da extensÃo. Develop {{the concept}} of institutional development for the Brazilian contemporary university is a complex problem: {{to be a new}} issue, the conceptual underpinnings are not consolidated, there are no studies and surveys that indicate features, obstacles, and evidence of this phenomenon. This thesis, which started as a study in the Graduate Program in Education of the Federal University of CearÃ (UFC), aimed to address this issue as a central criterion for proposing, through the categories of analysis Evaluation, Planning and Sinaes a model of institutional development as a precondition to indicate, in addition to the quality dimensions of university based in the National Evaluation System of Higher Education of Brazil (Sinaes), its social relevance. With this intention, we sought the tasks laid down by the Brazilian universities, while regarding the main elements, functions or structures, which were organized into twenty categories of analysis, allowing to characterize the contemporary university in Brazil, based on their mission, while its <b>ratio</b> <b>institutional.</b> In this analysis it was found that most often the Brazilian university is characterized by offering Teaching and Research, Knowing and Knowledge, Humanistic Education & Professional with the purposes of: Development & Progress, Society & Community, Social Inclusion and Citizenship. Based on this understanding of the subject field, the multiple references and transdisciplinarity, characterized the process of institutional development of the university and its obstacles, coming to the conceptions of society, subject and institution to propose a model where the main obstacle to institutional development, identified as the disconnection between the macro assessment and institutional planning, was overcome. To put the education in the world and in Brazil included the analysis of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development - OECD, contained in the report Education at a Glance: OECD lndicators Report 2007 on the model CIPP proposed by Stufflebeam, with results presented in form of tables, charts and graphs. Thus, the proposed model is a first approach to examining the institutional development of the university in a Brazilian contemporary socio-historical perspective, organized by systemic analysis, and institutional critique, which found that culture is the main factor in this phenomenon, there is no single model for institutional development of the university, which is a necessary task, as a reason for action, capable of guiding the university, your body and its social political and pedagogical project in directions: the economic system of society, the establishment of the organization; the individual-agent to the subject-citizen. A mission to reorient their objectives and institutional projects in addition to teaching, research and extension...|$|R
