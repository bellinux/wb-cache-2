5|$|Although {{a member}} of the House of Lords, until the passage of the House of Lords Act in 1999, the 10th Earl of Shaftesbury rarely attended. His maiden speech was made on 10 November 1999. At this time, Shaftesbury made an eight-minute {{presentation}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>debate</b> regarding arts and sport, a portion of which is presented below.|$|E
5|$|In July 2014, Baker {{was criticized}} by Democrats {{for refusing to}} say whether he {{supported}} {{a provision in the}} new gun control law that gave police chiefs discretion to deny firearms identification cards, which are required to purchase shotguns and rifles. He later stated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>debate</b> that he would have signed the gun control bill as it was signed by Governor Patrick.|$|E
5|$|Social life in {{the urban}} setting did not {{initially}} {{live up to his}} expectations, but after a time his writing and lecturing upon a variety of subjects filled the void. He also joined The American Institute for the Advancement of Science and successfully urged its members to establish a section on Political Economics and Statistics. He as well engaged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>debate,</b> as antagonist of Malthusian population theory with proponent Alexander Everett.|$|E

2500|$|The House of Representatives usually sits Tuesday to Thursday when in session. The House meets <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>debating</b> chamber located inside Parliament House, Wellington. The {{arrangement}} {{is similar to}} the design of the chamber of the British House of Commons. The seats and desks are arranged <b>in</b> rows <b>in</b> <b>a</b> horseshoe pattern.|$|R
5|$|However, at two Cabinet {{meetings}} held on 1 April 1965, it {{was decided}} to cancel the TSR-2 on the grounds of projected cost, and instead to obtain an option agreement to acquire up to 110 F-111 aircraft with no immediate commitment to buy. This decision was announced in the budget speech of 6 April 1965. The maiden flight of the second development batch aircraft, XR220, was due {{on the day of the}} announcement, but following an accident in conveying the airframe to Boscombe Down, coupled with the announcement of the project cancellation, it never happened. Ultimately, only the first prototype, XR219, ever took to the air. A week later, the Chancellor defended the decision <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>debate</b> in the House of Commons, saying that the F-111 would prove cheaper.|$|E
5|$|In August 1999, the {{architect}} informed the project group that the Parliament {{would need to}} be further increased in size by 4,000squaremetres (43,000sqft). A subsequent costing revealed that taking into account the increased floorspace net construction costs had risen to £115m by September 1999. Early in 2000, the SPCB commissioned an independent report by {{the architect}} John Spencely. The report concluded that savings of 20% could be made on the current project and that scrapping the project completely at that stage or moving to another site would entail additional costs of £30m. Spencely also cited poor communication between the SPCB and construction officials as increasingly costly. Given the outcomes of the Spencely report, MSPs voted to continue with the construction project on the Holyrood site <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>debate</b> in the Scottish Parliament on 5 April 2000.|$|E
5|$|On 2 July 1942 Driberg {{cast his}} first {{vote in the}} House of Commons, in support of Churchill against a rebel motion of censure on the government's conduct of the war. The rebels' case was put incompetently, which ensured that the motion gained only 25 votes, as against 477 cast for the government. Driberg {{delivered}} his maiden speech on 7 July, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>debate</b> {{on the use of}} propaganda. He called for the lifting of the ban on the Communist Party's newspaper, the Daily Worker, which he saw as a potentially valuable weapon of home propaganda.|$|E

25|$|On October 19, 2005, a {{proposal}} {{was made to}} adjust the city name to: Foz do Iguassu. The proposal was approved <b>in</b> <b>a</b> first <b>debate</b> and then rejected <b>in</b> <b>a</b> second <b>debate,</b> at the Town Hall (Câmara Municipal), by four votes for and eight against. The bill was initiated by city councillor Djalma Pastorello, of the PSDB.|$|R

5|$|The {{relationship}} between Isabella and Martinuzzi was tense. Martinuzzi continued to control state administration and finance {{even after the}} Diet confirmed Isabella's superior position in February 1543. The first tribute from John Sigismund's realm {{was sent to the}} Ottoman Sultan in June. In the same month, Saxon clergymen from Kronstadt (now Brașov in Romania), who had adopted Lutheranism, participated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>debate</b> with Catholic priests {{in the presence of the}} queen and Martinuzzi in Gyulafehérvár. The Saxons were allowed to leave, although Martinuzzi, who was bishop of Várad, wanted to bring them before court on charges of heresy. In April 1544, the Diet of Torda prescribed that travellers should respect the religious customs of the settlements they visited, showing that the ideas of the Reformation had spread to the whole province.|$|E
5|$|The {{signature}} {{issue of}} the session, however, was Fields' request for the bond issue. He engaged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>debate</b> with opponents of the issue that was published in Bingham's Courier-Journal {{as well as the}} Louisville Herald and Louisville Post, two papers owned by James B. Brown. Ultimately, the issue was approved by the General Assembly, which was considered a major victory for Fields. Still, the bond issue had to be approved by the state's electorate. The Courier-Journal continued the fight against the issue, while Desha Breckinridge's Lexington Herald came out in favor of it. Fields spent ten weeks criss-crossing the state speaking in favor of the bond issue, but on election day, it was rejected by a margin of 90,000 votes.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the Minster fire, the Corporation of York (the body {{responsible}} for local government) was already engaged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>debate</b> {{about the future of the}} city's defensive walls. The walls no longer served any practical purpose and were expensive to maintain, and with the population of the city rising rapidly the city was becoming cramped and dangerous. The city gates ("Bars") had become a public health hazard given the number of locals using them as toilets, and theft of stone for other building works had left parts of the walls dangerously unstable. The Bars restricted stagecoaches, meaning York was unable to capitalise on its strategic position halfway along the lucrative London–Edinburgh route. Faced with the need to clear the city's slums, in 1800 the Corporation sought permission from Parliament to demolish the Bars and much of the walls. Owing to opposition from York Minster the scheme was abandoned, but by 1826 the barbicans of four of the gates had been demolished. In the face of this a public campaign to save the walls was launched in 1824, but attention on both sides of the debate was diverted by the Minster fire. In 1828 Etty had written to his mother expressing horror at the demolition proposals, but distracted by the need to complete Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs was unable to take any action himself. By 1831 the Corporation had decided to demolish the barbicans but to retain and restore the walls.|$|E

60|$|Edmund Burke was a fellow-student with Goldsmith at the college. Neither the statesman nor {{the poet}} gave promise {{of their future}} celebrity, though Burke {{certainly}} surpassed his contemporary in industry and application, and evinced more disposition for self-improvement, associating himself {{with a number of}} his fellow-students <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>debating</b> club, <b>in</b> which they discussed literary topics, and exercised themselves in composition.|$|R
5|$|His first {{television}} appearance was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>debate</b> {{about the existence}} of flying saucers following a spate of reported sightings in the 1950s; Moore argued against Lord Dowding and other UFO proponents. He was invited to present a live astronomy programme and said the greatest difficulty was finding an appropriate theme tune; the opening of Jean Sibelius's Pelléas et Mélisande was chosen and used throughout the programme's existence. The programme was originally named Star Map before The Sky at Night was chosen in the Radio Times. On 24 April 1957, at 10:30 pm, Moore presented the first episode about the Comet Arend–Roland. The programme was pitched to casual viewers up to professional astronomers, in a format which remained consistent from its inception. Moore presented every monthly episode except for one in July 2004 when he suffered a near-fatal bout of food poisoning caused by eating a contaminated goose egg and was replaced for that episode by Chris Lintott. Moore appears in the Guinness World Records book as the world's longest-serving TV presenter having presented the programme since 1957. From 2004 to 2012, the programme was broadcast from Moore's home, when arthritis prevented him from travelling to the studios. Over the years he received many lucrative offers to take his programme onto other networks, but rejected them because he held a 'gentlemen's agreement' with the BBC.|$|E
5|$|Supporters rallied and {{collected}} funds for Johnson to complete her {{education in the}} United States, and she enrolled at New York University, completing her Doctor of Education in 1962. When suffrage passed in 1961, Johnson immediately entered the fray, accepting a nomination as a PLP candidate for the Eleuthera District. She wrote a booklet entitled The Next Step: Votes for Women in which she explained useful information for voting, {{such as how to}} register to vote and cast a ballot. She lost the race, but three years later participated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>debate</b> in the push for majority rule on the parliamentary imbalance in the Bahamas with a delegation from the PLP at the United Nations. At that meeting, she met the president of her alma mater from Virginia Union, and agreed to accept a teaching post at Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. A little over a year later, Johnson left Louisiana and came back to the Bahamas to participate in the 1967 elections. The PLP won the majority of seats and she became the first woman appointee to serve in the Bahamian Senate. One of her first acts was to form a committee to help the Haitian diaspora who had fled to the Bahamas because of unrest in their own country. With an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 refugees and a government decree to stop issuing work permits to Haitians, the situation was critical. The following year, PLP had a landslide victory in the 1968 election and Johnson was reappointed to the Senate, and appointed as the first woman to lead government business.|$|E
