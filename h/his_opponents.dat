5|$|Colonel Francis, {{in a sign}} {{of respect}} from <b>his</b> <b>opponents,</b> was buried with the Brunswick dead.|$|E
5|$|Bradbury's {{strategy}} {{from the}} semifinal onwards was to cruise behind <b>his</b> <b>opponents</b> {{and hope that}} they crashed, as he realised {{that he could not}} match their raw pace. His reasoning was that risk-taking by the favourites could cause a racing incident, and if two (or more) riders collided and fell, the remaining three would all receive medals, and that as he was slower than <b>his</b> <b>opponents,</b> trying to challenge them directly would only increase his chance of being caught in a collision and falling.|$|E
5|$|Adams would {{sometimes}} accept challenge matches at his performances. For example, at an exhibition held in Omaha, Nebraska, on November 20, 1889, Adams played against twenty {{of the best}} players in the city. Adams manipulated the balls with his fingers, while <b>his</b> <b>opponents</b> used cues and were given a handicap equivalent to a 1,000 point lead.|$|E
50|$|As the {{opponent}} {{runs to the}} ropes {{on one side of}} the ring and rebounds against them, the attacker also runs to the same ropes and rebounds against them after <b>his</b> <b>opponent</b> has done so, ensuring that he is behind <b>his</b> <b>opponent.</b> As <b>his</b> <b>opponent</b> then turns around to face the attacker which is behind him, the attacker executes a regular clothesline to <b>his</b> <b>opponent.</b>|$|R
50|$|The wrestler {{can block}} a move by <b>his</b> <b>opponent,</b> and use <b>his</b> {{strength}} to un-balance <b>his</b> <b>opponent.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Dog-like antics, {{including}} biting the air, barking at <b>his</b> <b>opponent,</b> howling and {{crawling on}} all fours while repeatedly headbutting <b>his</b> <b>opponent</b> ...|$|R
5|$|Black also {{identifies}} {{a mechanism}} Fleming uses in Casino Royale—and in subsequent Bond novels—which {{is to use}} the evil of <b>his</b> <b>opponents</b> both as a justification of his actions, and as a device to foil their own plans. Black refers to the episode of the attempted assassination of Bond by Bulgarian assassins which results in their own deaths.|$|E
5|$|Both {{parties of}} the College of Cardinals were of almost an equal size. The party of Aymeric had 19 members, while that of <b>his</b> <b>opponents</b> 24, but {{the party of the}} Chancellor was {{certainly}} better organized.|$|E
5|$|Defensively he {{made use}} of poke checks to take the puck from <b>his</b> <b>opponents</b> and excelled at getting to loose pucks and {{clearing}} {{them out of the}} defensive zone. He was adept at keeping opposing forwards from creating offence from behind the net.|$|E
5000|$|If {{a wrestler}} tries to avoid <b>his</b> <b>opponent's</b> hold, {{he gets a}} warning for passiveness, and <b>his</b> <b>opponent</b> earns 1 point.|$|R
50|$|Facing <b>his</b> <b>opponent,</b> the wrestler reaches between <b>his</b> <b>opponent's</b> {{legs with}} one arm and reaches around their back from the same side with his other arm. The wrestler lifts <b>his</b> <b>opponent</b> up so they are {{horizontal}} across the wrestlers body. From here many throws, drops and slams can be performed.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: By {{using his}} Shadow Imitation Technique, Shikamaru can merge his shadow with <b>his</b> <b>opponent's</b> shadow, and force <b>his</b> <b>opponent</b> to mimic <b>his</b> movements.|$|R
5|$|Del Potro is an {{offensive}} baseliner {{with a very}} powerful serve and deep, flat, topspin groundstroke, where he pushes <b>his</b> <b>opponents</b> deeper with his heavy groundstroke and trying to blast past them with a winner. His forehand {{is one of his}} main strengths and possibly the most powerful in the game, capable of frequently generating speeds of 160km/h.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in New York he was thought to have {{demonstrated}} good administrative abilities, but his manner was considered imperious by <b>his</b> <b>opponents</b> among the colonists, and he made numerous enemies during his tenure as governor.|$|E
5|$|Hanson {{returned}} to the WWWF in 1979 as a vicious heel under the management of Fred Blassie. To build up his heat, many of <b>his</b> <b>opponents</b> were stretchered-out of the ring following their matches with Swede. He unsuccessfully challenged World champion Bob Backlund at Madison Square Garden in October of that year.|$|E
50|$|Next was Rey Mysterio {{defending}} the WWE Intercontinental Championship against Dolph Ziggler. Ziggler gained an early advantage by muscling <b>his</b> <b>opponent</b> into the turnbuckle with a powerbomb. In attempt to ground <b>his</b> <b>opponent,</b> Ziggler locked Mysterio in a headlock and rode {{him into the}} mat. Mysterio managed to escape <b>his</b> <b>opponent's</b> onslaught by connecting with a kick to <b>his</b> <b>opponent.</b> He ascended the top turnbuckle {{in an attempt to}} dive on <b>his</b> <b>opponent,</b> who countered with a dropkick. The challenger ascended the turnbuckle himself with Mysterio on his shoulder before jumping off dropping Mysterio on his stomach onto Ziggler's knee. After an attempt to pin him, Mysterio retaliated by kicking <b>his</b> <b>opponent</b> onto the middle rope before swinging through them to kick Ziggler in the face with a move called the 619. After connecting, he jumped off the top rope, connecting with a body press to pin the challenger and retain the title.|$|R
5000|$|Reversals or Sweeps: These {{occur when}} a {{grappler}} who was underneath <b>his</b> <b>opponent</b> {{on the ground}} is able to maneuver so that he gains a top position over <b>his</b> <b>opponent.</b>|$|R
50|$|A player wins when he {{has succeeded}} in {{capturing}} all of <b>his</b> <b>opponent's</b> pieces, or if <b>his</b> <b>opponent</b> resigns. A draw occurs when neither player can theoretically take an opposing piece.|$|R
5|$|In 1935, Johnson was one {{of three}} contenders for the Democratic {{nomination}} for lieutenant governor. In the primary, he received more votes than <b>his</b> <b>opponents,</b> J. E. Wise and B. F. Wright, but a newly enacted election law required a runoff if no candidate received a majority. On September 7, Johnson defeated Wise in the runoff.|$|E
5|$|Khánh {{presided over}} the trial, which took place on May 28 after prodding by the Americans for him to give <b>his</b> <b>opponents</b> a hearing. Minh was accused of misusing {{a small amount of}} money, before being allowed to serve as an advisor on the trial panel.|$|E
5|$|Leaving Prussia, Pulaski {{sought refuge}} in France, where he unsuccessfully {{attempted}} {{to join the}} French Army. In 1773, <b>his</b> <b>opponents</b> in Poland accused him of attempted regicide, and proceedings began at the Sejm Court on June 7.|$|E
25|$|Máscara o cabellera contra retiro ("mask or hair versus career"): if {{the masked}} or haired luchador loses, <b>his</b> <b>opponent</b> wins the mask or hair. But if he wins, <b>his</b> <b>opponent</b> must retire.|$|R
50|$|The game is won if {{a player}} moves any two of his pieces (Knights and/or Men) into <b>his</b> <b>opponent's</b> castle. Or, the game is won {{if a player}} captures all of <b>his</b> <b>opponent's</b> pieces, and has {{two or more of}} his own pieces left. Or, the game is won if a player has two or more pieces, and <b>his</b> <b>opponent</b> is unable to make a legal move.|$|R
5000|$|Reversal (1 point): A wrestler {{is awarded}} one {{point for a}} {{reversal}} when the wrestler gains control over <b>his</b> <b>opponent</b> from a defensive position (when the wrestler is being controlled by <b>his</b> <b>opponent).</b>|$|R
5|$|Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson was {{complimentary}} of <b>his</b> <b>opponents</b> afterwards and {{was pleased}} {{there were no}} new injuries to report. Opposing manager Arsène Wenger praised Fàbregas's performance and reiterated his desire to keep Vieira at Arsenal, after speculation regarding the player's impending transfer to Real Madrid.|$|E
5|$|Octavian had {{previously}} shown little mercy to surrendered enemies and acted {{in ways that}} had proven unpopular with the Roman people, yet he was given credit for pardoning many of <b>his</b> <b>opponents</b> after the Battle of Actium.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantines {{wasted no}} time {{exploiting}} the situation and signed a peace treaty with their Christian neighbours and with one of Bayezid's sons. By signing the treaty, {{they were able to}} recover Thessalonika and much of the Peloponnese. The Ottoman civil war ended in 1413 when Mehmed I, {{with the support of the}} Byzantine Empire, defeated <b>his</b> <b>opponents.</b>|$|E
50|$|One player {{will run}} out of ko threats. That player {{will be forced to}} make a play that <b>his</b> <b>opponent</b> does not have to respond to immediately, and <b>his</b> <b>opponent</b> wins the ko immediately.|$|R
5000|$|... bowl of odds: {{when one}} bowler is one full shot fewer than <b>his</b> <b>opponent,</b> i.e., when a bowler {{is equal to}} or farther in {{distance}} than <b>his</b> <b>opponent,</b> but has thrown one less shot.|$|R
50|$|A wrestler {{wins the}} match {{when he has}} outscored <b>his</b> <b>opponent</b> {{at the end of}} the two three-minute sessions. For example, if one {{competitor}} were to score four points in the first session and <b>his</b> <b>opponent</b> two, and then two in the second session, <b>his</b> <b>opponent</b> zero, the competitor would win. Only a fall, injury default, or disqualification terminates the match; all other modes of victory result only in session termination.|$|R
5|$|The {{next day}} (28 November), the French Emperor {{requested}} a personal interview with Alexander I {{and received a}} visit from the Tsar's most impetuous aide, Count Dolgorouki. The meeting was another part of the trap, as Napoleon intentionally expressed anxiety and hesitation to <b>his</b> <b>opponents.</b> Dolgorouki reported to the Tsar an additional indication of French weakness.|$|E
5|$|After then-front-runner Herman Cain {{was damaged}} by {{allegations}} of past sexual harassment, Gingrich gained support, and {{quickly became a}} contender in the race, especially after Cain suspended his campaign. By December 4, 2011, Gingrich was leading in the national polls. However, after an abundance of negative ads run by <b>his</b> <b>opponents</b> throughout December, Gingrich's national polling lead had fallen to a tie with Mitt Romney.|$|E
5|$|Although Lincoln {{won only}} a {{plurality}} of the popular vote, his victory {{in the electoral college}} was decisive: Lincoln had 180 and <b>his</b> <b>opponents</b> added together had only 123. There were fusion tickets in which all of Lincoln's opponents combined to support the same slate of Electors in New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island, but even if the anti-Lincoln vote had been combined in every state, Lincoln still would have won a majority in the Electoral College.|$|E
50|$|There are two win {{conditions}} in Luck & Logic. A player wins by destroying {{all six of}} <b>his</b> <b>opponent’s</b> gates or when <b>his</b> <b>opponent</b> refreshes twice. Refreshing is the act of shuffling one’s drop zone back into the deck.|$|R
50|$|A {{man gets}} beaten by <b>his</b> <b>opponent,</b> {{but after he}} finds out the fight was rigged, he decides to fight back. He kills <b>his</b> <b>opponent</b> and is {{announced}} as the winner. On {{his way back to}} his home, another man kills him.|$|R
