5|$|Argentina fell <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> {{recession}} {{in the second half}} of 1998, triggered and then compounded by a series of adverse external shocks, which included low prices for agricultural commodities, the appreciation of the US dollar, to which the peso was pegged at par, the 1998 Russian financial crisis, the LTCM crisis and the devaluation of the Brazilian real in January 1999. Argentina did not enjoy a rapid recovery, and the sluggishness of GDP growth fuelled concerns about the sustainability of public debt.|$|E

5|$|Bristol has a {{long history}} of trade, {{originally}} exporting wool cloth and importing fish, wine, grain and dairy products; later imports were tobacco, tropical fruits and plantation goods. Major imports are motor vehicles, grain, timber, produce and petroleum products. Since the 13th century, the rivers have been modified for docks; during the 1240s, the Frome was diverted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep,</b> man-made channel (known as Saint Augustine's Reach) which flowed into the River Avon.|$|E

5|$|For {{some time}} {{researchers}} have been aware that pods of sperm whales may sleep for short periods, assuming a vertical position with their heads just below or at the surface.

5|$|A low {{pressure}} area developed off the Karnataka-Goa coastline in the Arabian Sea on May 27 and developed into a depression the next day. The system developed further into a cyclonic storm on May 29 as it moved to the north. The storm reached its peak with 95km/h (60mph) soon after this as it turned to the west, but soon degenerated <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> depression over the northern Arabian Sea on May 31. The depression continued to move west, weakening to a remnant low shortly as it made landfall on the Arabian Peninsula on June 2. The remnant low dissipated over southern Saudi Arabia the next day.|$|E

5|$|After {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression {{turned to a}} northwest motion before resuming a track to the west-northwest. On May7 it intensified <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> depression, and though its winds had increased, the structure became disorganized as the center became exposed from the thunderstorm activity. The convection waned, due {{to the influence of}} dry air from the Arabian Peninsula, as well as from wind shear. As a result, the IMD downgraded it to depression status early on May8. However, later in the day, convection redeveloped over the western half of the circulation, and it again reached deep depression status, about 830km (515mi) southeast of Oman.|$|E
5|$|Around May6, {{the monsoon}} trough {{extended}} across the southern Bay of Bengal, producing a vast field of thunderstorm activity. A broad low-pressure area {{formed by the}} next day and remained nearly stationary. Over the next few days, the convection varied in intensity until becoming more organized around the nascent surface low on May10. At 03:00UTC on May10, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) reported the formation of a depression about 535km (330mi) west of Banda Aceh, Indonesia. Within nine hours, the depression further intensified <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> depression. Around the same time, the system was classified as Tropical Cyclone 01B by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.|$|E
5|$|As McKinley's {{professional}} career progressed, so too did his social life blossom as he wooed Ida Saxton, {{the daughter of}} a prominent Canton family. They were married on January 25, 1871, in the newly built First Presbyterian Church of Canton, although Ida soon joined her husband's Methodist church. Their first child, Katherine, was born on Christmas Day 1871. A second daughter, Ida, followed in 1873, but died the same year. McKinley's wife descended <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> depression at her baby's death and her health, never robust, grew worse. Two years later, in 1875, Katherine died of typhoid fever. Ida never recovered from her daughters' deaths; the McKinleys had no more children. Ida McKinley developed epilepsy around the same time and thereafter disliked her husband's leaving her side. He remained a devoted husband and tended to his wife's medical and emotional needs {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

5|$|Bolton {{struggled}} {{in the following}} two seasons, but survived in the Premiership. The 2001–02 season began with a shock as they destroyed Leicester 5–0 at Filbert Street to go top of the table. Despite a 2–1 win away at Manchester United, becoming the first team since {{the formation of the}} Premiership to come from behind and win a league game at Old Trafford, they went <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> slump {{during the middle of the}} season and needed a Fredi Bobic hat-trick against Ipswich Town to survive. Despite losing the final three games, 16th place was secured. The 2002–03 season began with a poor start and, despite another win away at Manchester United, they were bottom until a 4–2 win against Leeds United at Elland Road. Despite suffering from a lack of consistency, Bolton achieved the results needed and secured survival in a final day 2–1 victory over Middlesbrough.|$|E
5|$|Despite Bowser's demise in {{the first}} level, this does not stop Bowser Jr. from running through the {{remaining}} worlds with Peach in tow, forcing Mario to chase after him before reaching Bowser's castle in world 8. There, Bowser Jr. revives his father's skeleton, creating Dry Bowser, but Mario once again defeats Bowser by dropping him <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> pit. In the final battle, Bowser Jr. flees once more across a lava chasm to a larger castle, where he throws his father's bones into a cauldron and revives Bowser in his original form. They attack Mario in tandem, but Mario drops the pair into the pit below. In the game's final sequence, Mario rescues Peach, who kisses him on the cheek. Over the end credits, Bowser Jr. is seen dragging his unconscious father across the floor. He looks at the screen, and growls, breaking the fourth wall.|$|E
5|$|Docter {{recruited}} a story crew to {{help develop}} the film's plot line. Although animation as an industry had been dominated by men, half of the story crew were women, {{in an attempt to}} have more diverse input. The choice to focus the film on a girl came from research that claimed that females age 11 to 17 are more attuned to expressions and emotions than others. The idea to have Riley play hockey came from Del Carmen, who observed that the sport is very popular in Minnesota. They tried to stray away from stereotypically feminine interests, such as the color pink or dresses. Initial ideas for the film found the main character, Riley, falling <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> depression: Docter later felt they were inappropriate and scrapped them, although in the final film Riley does sink into a depression.|$|E

50|$|A trained {{entrance}} often {{consists of}} rock walls that force the water <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> more stable channel. Trained entrances can provide better navigation, {{water quality and}} flood mitigation services, but can also cause beach erosion due to their interruption of longshore drift. One solution is the installation of a sand bypass system across the trained entrance.|$|R
30|$|The {{long-term}} slow slip beneath southwest Shikoku {{increased in}} speed from approximately March 2010, {{the time at}} which the activity of low-frequency earthquakes became higher (Figs. 5 and 6). The reason for this {{may be that the}} long-term slip in this event originated in a shallow region away from the low-frequency earthquake area and, over time, expanded <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> region near the low-frequency earthquake area, making the stress state more favorable for low-frequency earthquakes to occur during the period of high-speed slip. At the time of the 2003 long-term Bungo Channel slow slip, low-frequency earthquakes also became more active when the slip area expanded <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> region as the slip accelerated (Ozawa et al., 2007). The rate of stress change appears to have a strong effect on the occurrence of low-frequency earthquakes, which become more active during the high-speed period of a long-term slow slip.|$|R
