5|$|All {{recipes are}} written in the second-person {{singular}} imperative, a grammatical <b>form</b> <b>that</b> {{would not have been}} used to address a person of high rank. The instructions were most likely meant to be read aloud by the chef or one of senior cooks to junior members of the kitchen staff, who would carry them out. This style contrasts with the less direct, impersonal way of addressing the reader, characterized by infinitive verb forms, used in 19th-century Polish cookbooks.|$|E
5|$|Antibodies are {{secreted}} by B {{cells of}} the adaptive immune system, mostly by differentiated B cells called plasma cells. Antibodies can occur in two physical forms, a soluble <b>form</b> <b>that</b> is secreted from the cell to be free in the blood plasma, and a membrane-bound <b>form</b> <b>that</b> {{is attached to the}} surface of a B cell and {{is referred to as the}} B-cell receptor (BCR). The BCR is found only on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called plasma cells or memory B cells that will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure. In most cases, interaction of the B cell with a T helper cell is necessary to produce full activation of the B cell and, therefore, antibody generation following antigen binding. Soluble antibodies are released into the blood and tissue fluids, as well as many secretions to continue to survey for invading microorganisms.|$|E
50|$|Both Nynorsk and Bokmål have a {{great variety}} of {{optional}} <b>forms.</b> The Bokmål <b>that</b> uses the <b>forms</b> <b>that</b> are close to Riksmål is called moderate or conservative, depending on one's viewpoint, while the Bokmål <b>that</b> uses the <b>forms</b> <b>that</b> are close to Nynorsk is called radical. Nynorsk has <b>forms</b> <b>that</b> are close to the original Landsmål and <b>forms</b> <b>that</b> are close to Bokmål.|$|R
50|$|It is a {{markedly}} variable species, {{occurring in}} ecomorphic <b>forms</b> <b>that</b> have been termed 'pelagic', 'shoreline', 'riverine' and 'dwarfish'. In other locations <b>forms</b> <b>that</b> grow at different speeds have been distinguished, or {{in another case}} 'lake' and 'reed' <b>forms</b> <b>that</b> differed in colour and body shape.

5|$|Hemorrhagic {{smallpox}} is {{a severe}} <b>form</b> <b>that</b> {{is accompanied by}} extensive bleeding into the skin, mucous membranes, and gastrointestinal tract. This form develops in approximately 2 percent of infections and occurred mostly in adults. In hemorrhagic smallpox the skin does not blister, but remains smooth. Instead, bleeding occurs under the skin, making it look charred and black, hence this form of the disease {{is also known as}} black pox.|$|E
5|$|Matejko {{depicted}} {{many important}} {{figures of the}} Polish Renaissance period including taking the liberty to include at least one who were not actually present at the event. In a similar vein, although the event portrayed took place in 1525, Matejko painted fragments of the Sukiennice in Renaissance style, a <b>form</b> <b>that</b> dates from the year 1555, after a fire which destroyed the building in its original Gothic style. St. Mary's Basilica is visible in the background.|$|E
5|$|Metagenomics {{can provide}} {{valuable}} {{insights into the}} functional ecology of environmental communities. Metagenomic analysis of the bacterial consortia found in the defecations of Australian sea lions suggests that nutrient-rich sea lion faeces {{may be an important}} nutrient source for coastal ecosystems. This is because the bacteria that are expelled simultaneously with the defecations are adept at breaking down the nutrients in the faeces into a bioavailable <b>form</b> <b>that</b> can be taken up into the food chain.|$|E

5|$|On {{the early}} Earth, {{reactive}} elements, such as iron and uranium, existed in a reduced <b>form</b> <b>that</b> would react with any free oxygen produced by photosynthesising organisms. Oxygen {{would not be}} able to build up in the atmosphere until all the iron had rusted (producing banded iron formations), and all the other reactive elements had been oxidised.|$|E
5|$|Ramprasad is {{credited}} with creating a new compositional <b>form</b> <b>that</b> combined the Bengali folk style of Baul music with classical melodies and kirtan. The new style took root in Bengali culture with many poet-composers combining folk and raga-based melodies, mixing every common style of music from classical to semi-classical and folk. His songs are sung today, with a popular collection—Ramprasadi Sangit ("Songs of Ramprasad")—sold at Shakta temples and pithas in Bengal.|$|E

5|$|The quadrille is a dance <b>form</b> <b>that</b> is an {{important}} symbol of French Antillean culture, not just in Dominica, but also Martinique, Guadeloupe and other Francophone islands. Dominican quadrilles are traditionally performed by four sets of couples in subscription picnics or dances, and in private parties.

Examples of the emphatic form include: emmë, elyë, entë (1st to 3rd person plural). Such emphatic disjunctive pronouns, were already present in early Quenya but differed from the later versions (e.g. plural: tûto, sîse, atta).|$|E
5|$|The work, {{despite its}} attempt to depict Napoleon realistically, was criticised by several {{authorities}} {{for a variety of}} reasons. A few disapproved of Delaroche's choice of painting, while others disapproved of Delaroche himself, saying, in some <b>form,</b> <b>that</b> he sought the genius of Napoleon, to no avail.|$|E

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{high-level}} talkers are generally conservers of old forms and innovators of new <b>forms</b> <b>that</b> imply high proficiency, while mid-level talkers are innovators of new <b>forms</b> <b>that</b> lack clear positive connotation. For new <b>forms</b> <b>that</b> are slightly positive, {{the effect of}} gender might {{also need to be}} factored in. However, not all old forms are uniformly conserved by high-level talkers, and different speaker groups might demonstrate idiosyncratic preferences for their choices. This shows that the effect of proficiency for Taiwan Min might be more complicated than what was found for Yami [cf. Lai and Hsu (2013)].|$|R

Such a sequence may resemble or map exactly to a file system path, but does not always imply a relation to one. The path must begin with a single slash (/) if an authority part was present, and may also if one was not, but must not begin with a double slash. The path is always defined, though the defined path may be empty (zero length), therefore no trailing slash.|$|E
5|$|A {{secondary}} {{enemy is}} the Flood, a parasitic alien life <b>form</b> <b>that</b> appears in three main variants. Infection Forms, the true {{form of the}} Flood, are fragile beings and do little damage individually, but often travel in swarms of several dozen in order to infect their prey. Combat Forms result from humans and Covenant Elites who have succumbed to the Infection Forms, and have hideously deformed bodies as a result. Bloated Carrier Forms {{are the result of}} an aged or unused Combat Form and serve as incubators for new Infection Forms; when wounded or near a potential victim, they explode to damage other nearby life-forms and to release their spores, thus perpetuating the Flood life cycle.|$|E
5|$|A {{transitional}} fossil is any fossilized {{remains of}} a life <b>form</b> <b>that</b> exhibits traits common to both an ancestral group and its derived descendant group. This is especially important where the descendant group is sharply differentiated by gross anatomy and mode of living from the ancestral group. These fossils serve {{as a reminder that}} taxonomic divisions are human constructs that have been imposed in hindsight on a continuum of variation. Because of the incompleteness of the fossil record, there is usually no way to know exactly how close a transitional fossil is to the point of divergence. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that transitional fossils are direct ancestors of more recent groups, though they are frequently used as models for such ancestors.|$|E
