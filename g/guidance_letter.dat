2500|$|Avian radar is an {{important}} tool for aiding in bird strike mitigation as part of overall safety management systems at civilian and military airfields. Properly designed and equipped avian radars can track thousands of birds simultaneously in real-time, night and day, through 360° of coverage, out to ranges of 10nbsp&km and beyond for flocks, updating every target's position (longitude, latitude, altitude), speed, heading, and size every 2–3 seconds. Data from these systems {{can be used to}} generate information products ranging from real-time threat alerts to historical analyses of bird activity patterns in both time and space. The United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the United States Department of Defense (DOD) have conducted extensive science-based field testing and validation of commercial avian radar systems for civil and military applications, respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In 1998 the Dutch College of General Practitioners (NHG) began {{developing}} {{patient information}} letters (PILs), {{based on the}} practice guidelines for family physicians (FPs) (NHG standards). Five nutritional <b>guidance</b> <b>letters</b> have since been developed with the Dutch Nutrition Center. METHODS: In August-September 2001 a survey was done among {{a random sample of}} 200 FPs who subscribe to the PILs. They received a questionnaire about the use and implementation of the PILs in general, and about the nutrition letters specifically. RESULTS: Responses were received from 133 FPs (67 %). Of these FPs, 89 % use the PILs in their practice. Only 5 % of FPs say that they use the PILs on nutrition sufficiently; 32 % think they should use them a bit more, whereas 63 % make much too little use of the nutrition letters. The most important barriers for using the letters are that FPs do not think about them at the right moment (66 %), do not know the content enough (32 %), find that using them is too time-consuming (29 %), have computer problems (17 %), and have too little knowledge about nutritional advice (11 %); only 6 % do not see dietary advice as an FP's task. The most important reason for not using the nutrition letters {{is the fact that the}} letters are not integrated into their FP information system (23 %). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of PILs takes time, and there are great advantages to integrating them into the existing Family Practice Information Systems...|$|R

40|$|Objectives The U. S. federal {{government}} requires original documentation {{of citizenship and}} identity for applicants to qualify for coverage under Medicaid. The purpose of this investigation is to identify what challenges one state Medicaid agency has faced when implementing this requirement; and to identify what strategies this agency and other interested parties (e. g., providers, community advocates) adopted to help overcome them. Methods The setting for this study is MassHealth, the Medicaid agency for the State of Massachusetts. Data derive from archival documents, direct observation, and in-depth interviews with key stakeholders, including state officials, provider agencies, community health centers, and beneficiary advocates. Results While MassHealth has met several of the implementation benchmarks put forth in federal regulations and <b>guidance</b> <b>letters,</b> the agency has fallen short in several respects. This includes assisting applicants seeking to enroll in MassHealth and maintaining a seamless documentation submission process. The result {{has been an increase}} in application processing time and misinterpretations in the MassHealth community; for example, that legal immigrants should not apply for coverage even though the new requirement does not affect them. Assuming a prominent role in informing and assisting MassHealth applicants has been providers and community-based organizations. Consumer advocacy groups have also worked to streamline the process for demonstrating citizenship and identity. Synergies have been formed between MassHealth and these other organizations as well. Conclusions Findings suggest a number of lessons for state Medicaid agencies wishing to address the challenges posed by federal requirements to demonstrate citizenship and identity. These include working to ensure the readability, comprehension and non-English translation of materials provided to program applicants. It also includes strengthening the document handling process and forming partnerships with providers, beneficiary advocates, and other community organizations.

However, {{it was determined that}} the bolts cannot be inspected by UT due to configuration issues and it has recently been concluded that an EVT- 1 exam does not provide meaningful results. Accordingly, a technical justification for deviation from the BWRVIP guidance was developed. The technical justification included an analysis that found that the bolting has a relatively low susceptibility to cracking and a very high flaw tolerance. Therefore, postulated flaws would not grow to a size that significantly reduces the bolt preload {{over the life of the}} plant. Even if significant cracking did occur in the bolting, redundant structural components will prevent adverse displacement of the core plate. Furthermore, even with the extremely conservative assumptions of failures of both the bolting and the redundant hardware, the Standby Liquid Control (SLC) system could be used to bring the reactor to a safe shutdown. The BWRVIP is currently working on developing revised guidance for the Core Plate bolts and expects to complete that work, including gaining NRC approval of the revised guidance, by the end of 2015.

The science questions are organized as VSWIR-only, TIR-only and Combined science questions, the latter requiring data from both instruments. In order to prepare for the mission NASA is undertaking pre-phase A studies to determine the optimum mission implementation, in particular, cost and risk reduction activities. Each year the HyspIRI project is provided with feedback from NASA Headquarters on the pre-phase A activities {{in the form of a}} <b>guidance</b> <b>letter</b> which outlines the work that should be undertaken the subsequent year. The 2013 <b>guidance</b> <b>letter</b> included a recommendation to undertake a study to determine the science impact of deploying the instruments from separate spacecraft in sun synchronous orbits with various time separations and deploying both instruments on the International Space Station (ISS). This report summarizes the results from that study. The approach taken was to evaluate the impact on the combined science questions of time separations between the VSWIR and TIR data of < 3 minutes, < 1 week and a few months as well as deploying both instruments on the ISS. Note the impact was only evaluated for the combined science questions which require data from both instruments (VSWIR and TIR). The study concluded the impact of a separation of < 3 minutes was minimal, e. g. if the instruments were on separate platforms that followed each other in a train. The impact of a separation of < 1 week was strongly dependent on the question that was being addressed with no impact for some questions and a severe impact for others. The impact of a time separation of several months was severe and in many cases it was no longer possible to answer the sub-question. The impact of deploying the instruments on the ISS which is in a precessive (non-sun synchronous) orbit was also very question dependent, in some cases it was possible to go beyond the original question, e. g. to examine the impact of the diurnal cycle, whereas in other cases the question could not be addressed for example if the question required observations from the polar regions. As part of the study, the participants were asked to estimate, as a percentage, how completely a given sub-question could be answered with 100 % indicating the question could be completely answered. These estimations should be treated with caution but nonetheless can be useful in assessing the impact. Averaging the estimates for each of the combined questions the results indicate that 97 % of the questions could be answered with a separation of < 3 minutes. With a separation of < 1 week, 67 % of the questions could be answered and with a separation of several months only 21 % of the questions could be answered...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{ascertain}} {{the frequency and}} types of patient-reported outcome (PRO) violations made in US pharmaceutical promotional materials between 2006 and 2012 and determine whether there were increases in violation warnings after issuance of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) draft and final PRO <b>Guidance.</b> MethodsAll warning <b>letters</b> (WLs) or notices of violation (NOVs) issued by the FDA’s Office of Prescription Drug Promotion were reviewed for PRO violations (n = 213). Each letter containing a PRO violation was reviewed to determine the type of violation: 1) PRO measure not fit for purpose, 2) study design/interpretation of results, 3) statistical analysis, and 4) no treatment benefit. ResultsForty-one (19 %) letters contained information about PRO infringements. Noticeable spikes in letters were shown in 2007 (37 %) and 2010 (31 %) after the issuance of the draft and final PRO Guidance, respectively. The most common violation was PRO measure not fit for purpose (54 %), specifically: use of individual items (45 %), insufficient evidence of content validity (36 %), and broadening of the claim beyond what the PRO measures (27 %). Issues with study design/interpretation of results were also high (49 %), particularly broadening of claim beyond what was measured in the trial (55 %) and no PRO measure used (50 %). ConclusionsA fifth of the letters issued to companies contained PRO violations, with most related to poor selection of the PRO measure used or trying to broaden the claim. More guidance from the Office of Prescription Drug Promotion about what is considered “substantial evidence” in this area could help {{reduce the number of}} letters issued...|$|R
40|$|All {{holders of}} {{operating}} licenses for nuclear power reactors, except {{those who have}} permanently ceased operations and have certified that fuel has been permanently removed from the reactor vessel. INTENT The U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing this regulatory issue summary (RIS) to endorse the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) guidance titled “Range of Protective Actions for Nuclear Power Plant Incidents, April 2005, ” as an acceptable range of early-phase protective actions that licensees may use {{in the event of}} a nuclear power plant incident. This RIS requires no action or written response on the part of addressees. BACKGROUND INFORMATION Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Section 50. 47 (b) (10), requires, in part, that licensees develop a range of protective actions for the public in the plume exposure pathway emergency planning zone (EPZ). Also, 10 CFR 50. 47 (b) (10) requires that guidelines for the choice of protective actions during an emergency, consistent with Federal guidance, be developed and in place. Section III, “The Final Safety Analysis Report, ” of Appendix E to 10 CFR Part 50 requires that plans for coping with emergencies contain information to provide assurance of coordination among the supporting groups and with the licensee. Therefore, changes to a licensee’s emergency plan related to protective actions should be coordinated with the offsite response organizations. In this context, “coordinated ” means that the licensee has contacted offsite response organizations and informed them of the proposed change. ML 050870432 RIS 2005 - 08 Page 2 of 3 Due to the varied options in existing Federal guidance related to protective actions that may be taken {{in the event of a}} nuclear power plant accident, NEI developed the attached guidance to summarize a range of early-phase protective actions that may be used for nuclear power plant incidents. NEI requested NRC endorsement of the <b>guidance</b> in a <b>letter</b> dated April 27, 2005...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{estimate}} the prevalence of elderly using potentially inappropriate medications (PIM) and with occurrence of potentially hazardous drug interactions (PHDI); to identify the risk factors for the prescription of PIM and to evaluate the impact of pharmaceutical intervention (PI) for the prescription of safer therapeutic alternatives. Therefore, a cross-sectional study was performed in a long-term care facility in São Paulo State, between December/ 2010 and January/ 2011. The medical records of the patients > 60 years old who took any drugs were consulted to assess the pharmacotherapeutic safety of the medical prescriptions, {{in order to identify}} PIM and PHDI, according to the Beers (2003) and World Health Organization criteria, respectively. PI consisted of a <b>guidance</b> <b>letter</b> to the physician responsible for the institution, with the suggestions of safer equivalent therapeutics. Approximately 88 % of the elderly took at least one drug, and for 30 % of them the PIM had been prescribed. Most of the PIM identified (53. 4 %) act on the central nervous system. Among the 13 different DI detected, 6 are considered PHDI. Polypharmacy was detected as a risk factor for PIM prescription. After the PI there was no change in medical prescriptions of patients who had been prescribed PIM or PHDI. The data suggests that PI performed by letter, as the only interventional, method was ineffective. To contribute it a wide dissemination of PIM and PHDI among prescriber professionals is necessary for the selection of safer treatment for elderly. Additionally, a pharmacist {{should be part of the}} health care team in order to help promote rational use of medicines...|$|E
