5|$|Located {{around the}} {{perimeter}} of the BWCAW are six ranger stations: in Cook, Aurora, Ely, Isabella, Tofte and Grand Marais. The two nearby communities with most visitor services are Ely and Grand Marais. Several historic roads such as the Gunflint Trail, Echo Trail (County Road116) and Fernberg Road (County Road18) allow access to many wilderness <b>entry</b> <b>points.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{interpreter}} has an object-oriented architecture. All of {{the elements}} of the Perl language—scalars, arrays, hashes, coderefs, file handles—are represented in the interpreter by C structs. Operations on these structs are defined by a large collection of macros, typedefs, and functions; these constitute the Perl C API. The Perl API can be bewildering to the uninitiated, but its <b>entry</b> <b>points</b> follow a consistent naming scheme, which provides guidance to those who use it.|$|E
5|$|Three air {{and three}} land <b>entry</b> <b>points</b> were established, {{as well as}} five {{reception}} centres. Four centres were designed by Namibia Consult Incorporated under the directorship of Klaus Dierks, and constructed by the Australian contingent. The centres were located at Dobra, Mariabronn (near Grootfontein) and at Ongwediva and Engela in Ovamboland. They were administered {{under the auspices of}} the Repatriation, Resettlement and Reconstruction Committee of the CCN.|$|E

40|$|Using {{computerized}} tomographic {{data and}} three dimensional model, we studied {{the influence of}} tibial intramedullary canal axis and other morphologic factors of the tibia on the <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> for tibial intramedullary alignment guides. Various anatomical parameters including tibial anteroposterior dimensions (AP), mediolateral dimensions (ML), aspect ratio (ML/AP), bowing and the intramedullary canal axis were studied. In addition, the <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> for the intramedullary alignment guide for primary and revision total knee arthroplasty were studied. The averaged <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> {{at the level of}} the tibial plateau was 5. 7 ± 2. 2 mm anterior and 4. 3 ± 2. 0 mm lateral to the classical <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> (P<. 001). Furthermore, this <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> was more anterolateral in females when compared to males (P<. 001). At a depth 10 mm below the tibial plateau, the <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> was on average 8. 8 ± 1. 9 mm anterior and 2. 9 ± 1. 9 mm lateral to the center of the cut surface. With increasing tibial varus the <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> tended to shift laterally at both levels (r= 0. 49) (P<. 001). In Korean, the <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> for tibial intramedullary alignment systems is anterolateral to the classically described <b>entry</b> <b>point.</b> Moreover, the increment of tibial varus necessitates more lateral placement of the <b>entry</b> <b>point.</b> Intraoperatively, the <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> can be localized during primary knee arthroplasty to a point 15. 9 ± 2. 8 mm anterior to and 1. 2 ± 2. 8 mm lateral to the lateral tibial spine. For revision knee arthroplasty the point is on average 8. 8 ± 1. 9 mm anterior and 2. 9 ± 1. 9 mm lateral to the center of the cut surface of the tibia at a depth of 10 mm from the articular surface...|$|R
5|$|The case baffles Colton, as {{the only}} common {{elements}} in the murders are the lack of <b>entry</b> <b>points</b> and the apparent removal of the victims' livers with bare hands. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) looks over the case and notes their similarity to earlier murder sprees that occurred in 1933 and 1963. At the crime scene, Mulder notices an elongated fingerprint on the air vent, which he also finds {{to be similar to}} some documented in the X-Files. He concludes that because five murders occurred during the earlier sprees, the investigators should expect two more.|$|E
5|$|To deter smuggling, Madison {{proposed}} {{a bill to}} make Norfolk the state's only legal port of entry. Five other ports, including Alexandria, were eventually added, but the Port Act proved unpopular despite the support of Washington. Mason, an opponent of the act, accepted election to the House of Delegates in 1786, and many believed that his influence would prove decisive for the repeal effort. Due to illness, Mason {{did not come to}} Richmond during the initial session, though he sent a petition, as a private citizen, to the legislature. The Port Act survived, though additional harbors were added as legal <b>entry</b> <b>points.</b>|$|E
5|$|In August 2006, several tribes {{located in}} Ramadi {{and led by}} Sheikh Abdul Sattar Abu Risha began to form what would {{eventually}} become the Anbar Awakening, which later led to the tribes revolting against AQI. The Anbar Awakening helped turn the tide against the insurgents through 2007. American and Iraqi tribal forces regained control of Ramadi in early 2007, {{as well as other}} cities such as Hīt, Haditha, and Rutbah. More hard fighting still followed throughout the Summer of 2007 however, particularly in the rural western River Valley, due largely to its proximity to the Syrian border and the vast network of natural <b>entry</b> <b>points</b> for foreign fighters to enter Iraq, via Syria. In June 2007 the U.S. turned a majority of its attention to eastern Anbar Province and secured the cities of Fallujah and Al-Karmah.|$|E

40|$|This year a Fujitsu Laboratory team {{participated in}} web tracks. Both for ad hoc task, and <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> search task, we {{combined}} the score of normal ranking search {{and that of}} page ranking techniques. For ad hoc style task, the e ect of page ranking was very limitted. We only got very little improvement for title eld search, and the page rank was not e ective for description, and narrative eld search. For <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> search task, we compared three heuristics. The rst heuristics supposed that <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> page contains key word and had high page rank score. The second heuristics supposed that <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> page contains key word in its head part and had high page ran score. The third heuristics supposes that <b>entry</b> <b>point</b> is pointed by the pages whose anchor string contains key word, and has high page rank score.

5|$|In Syracuse, NY5 is {{parallel}} to I-690 for much of its routing but never encounters the highway, thus making the north–south streets that intersect NY5 <b>entry</b> <b>points</b> to and from I-690. In downtown Syracuse, West Genesee Street becomes James Street. At {{the southern tip of}} the interchange between I-690 and I-81, NY5 transfers onto Erie Boulevard and intersects State Street (US11), but passes under I-81 without access. From the downtown area to DeWitt, NY5 is divided. At the Syracuse–DeWitt boundary, NY5 intersects NY635 and eastward, it curves to a southeast course. Near Shoppingtown Mall, NY5 turns east onto Genesee Street to begin an overlap with NY92. Less than a mile east of the mall, NY5 and NY92 intersect I-481 at a cloverleaf interchange.|$|E
5|$|Permits are {{required}} for all overnight visits to the BWCAW. Quota permits {{are required}} for groups taking an overnight paddle, motor, or hiking trip, or a motorized day-use trip into the BWCAW from May 1 through September 30. These permits must be reserved in advance. Day use paddle and hiking permits do not require advance reservation and can be filled out at BWCAW <b>entry</b> <b>points.</b> From October 1 through April 30, permit reservations are not necessary, but a permit must be filled out at the permit stations located at each entry point. Each permit must specify the trip leader, the specific entry point and the day of entry. The permits are for an indefinite length, although visitors are only allowed one entry into the wilderness and cannot stay in one campsite for more than 14 nights.|$|E
5|$|Major <b>entry</b> <b>points</b> to Skyline Drive {{located in}} Front Royal, Thornton Gap, Swift Run Gap, and Rockfish Gap. Fees are {{collected}} at the Skyline Drive's four access points. The fee is not a toll charged to drive on the road, but rather an entry fee for the park itself. Various passes allow for admission to the park. A $25.00 pass is valid for unlimited entrances within a seven-day period for a private non-commercial vehicle. A seven-day pass costs $15.00 for motorcycles and $10.00 for individuals 16 {{years of age or}} older entering by means other than a private non-commercial vehicle. Commercial tours pay between $25.00 and $200.00 for a seven-day pass, depending on the number of passengers. An annual park pass costs $50.00 for a private non-commercial vehicle. Entrance can also be gained through the America the Beautiful: National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass series. In this series, the Annual Pass costs $80.00, the lifetime Senior Pass costs $10.00, the lifetime Access Pass allows free admission for persons with disabilities, and the Volunteer Pass allows free admission for volunteers who work 250 service hours for the following year. A free Annual Pass is also available for members of the United States Armed Forces and fourth graders can get free admission for their whole family through the Every Kid in a Park Pass.|$|E
