5|$|In English a {{sentence}} may {{be composed of}} one or more clauses, that may in turn be composed {{of one or more}} phrases (e.g. Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases, and Prepositional Phrases). A clause is built around a verb, and includes its constituents, such as any NPs and PPs. Within {{a sentence}} one clause is always the main clause (or matrix clause) whereas other clauses are subordinate to it. Subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause. For example, in the phrase I think (that) you are lying, the main clause is headed by the verb think, the subject is I, but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause (that) you are lying. The subordinating conjunction that shows that the clause that <b>follows</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> subordinate clause, but it is often omitted. Relative clauses are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause: For example, in the sentence I saw the letter that you received today, the relative clause that you received today specifies {{the meaning of the word}} letter, the object of the main clause. Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns who, whose, whom and which as well as by that (which can also be omitted.) In contrast to many other Germanic languages there is no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses.|$|E

What <b>follows</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> description of Surinam itself and the South American Indians there. She regards the locals as simple {{and living in a}} golden age (the presence of gold in the land being indicative of the epoch of the people themselves).

500|$|Screen Rant {{wrote of}} the character: [...] "Rather than {{beginning}} the series {{in a state of}} potential heroism, Alex begins the series as a potential villain. And yet, Alex is still a hero. Everything that <b>follows</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> desperate attempt at survival and at remaining one step ahead of those who are trying to harm her. In fact, Alex's narrative is one in which she is nearly immediately immersed in adventure and thrown headfirst into chaos." [...] The character is also opinionated and outspoken. Chopra said [...] "Alex is someone with a point of a view and she's a woman with an opinion {{and at the same time}} she's not afraid of being who she is. The modern woman today is different and Alex is definitely bold and expressive and she identifies herself as a human being of today, not a man or a woman. She's empowered and she's confident." ...|$|E
500|$|Within the six {{disability}} categories {{the athletes}} {{still need to}} be divided according to their level of impairment. [...] The classification systems differ from sport to sport. [...] The systems are designed to open up Paralympic sports to as many athletes as possible, who can participate in fair competitions against athletes with similar levels of ability. [...] The closest equivalents in able-bodied competitions are age classifications in junior sports, and weight divisions in wrestling, boxing, and weightlifting. [...] Classifications vary in accordance with the different skills required to perform the sport. [...] The biggest challenge in the classification system is how to account for the wide variety and severity of disabilities. [...] As a result, {{there will always be a}} range of impairment within a classification. [...] What <b>follows</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> list of the Winter Paralympic sports and a general description of how they are classified.|$|E
