40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a fitossociologia de plantas daninhas em cafezais sob diferentes períodos de consórcio com leguminosas em dois anos de cultivo. Os tratamentos corresponderam à combinação fatorial entre as leguminosas feijão-de-porco (Canavalia ensiformis) e lablabe (Dolichos lab-lab) e períodos de consorciação com cafeeiros aos 30, 60, 90 e 120 dias após o plantio, mais uma testemunha sem leguminosa. O experimento foi composto por nove tratamentos em delineamento de blocos casualizados com quatro repetições. As leguminosas foram semeadas em dezembro de 2007 e outubro de 2008 e cortadas {{conforme}} os períodos de consorciação, sendo removidas da entrelinha, para ficarem sob a copa dos cafeeiros. As plantas daninhas foram amostradas nas entrelinhas e na projeção das copas dos cafeeiros, em outubro de 2008 e em outubro de 2009, refletindo o efeito dos tratamentos após um e dois anos de consorciação, respectivamente. As avaliações constaram da similaridade da comunidade, do índice do valor de importância e da importância relativa das plantas daninhas mais frequentes. Nos dois anos agrícolas foram identificadas 17 espécies de plantas daninhas, distribuídas em dez famílias botânicas, sendo mais frequentes as espécies Cyperus rotundus, Paspalum conjugatum, Amaranthus retroflexus e Oxalis latifolia. No primeiro ano, o feijão-de-porco (2, 65 t ha- 1) produziu mais massa que a lablabe (1, 89 t ha- 1), e no segundo ano a lablabe produziu mais massa (4, 21 t ha- 1) que o feijão-de-porco (2, 73 t ha&# 8209; 1). Nas entrelinhas, a diferença da flora de plantas daninhas em relação à testemunha foi maior do que na projeção da copa dos cafeeiros, no final dos dois anos. Em 2008, quando a lablabe ficou por 90 ou 120 dias nas entrelinhas, houve crescimento da importância da tiririca, enquanto em 2009 a importância relativa desta foi mais elevada na testemunha. As entrelinhas do cafeeiro apresentaram massa de matéria seca de plantas daninhas maior do que a projeção da copa, possivelmente devido ao sombreamento proporcionado pelos cafeeiros. A espécie Cyperus rotundus foi a de maior importância nos dois anos, seguida de Paspalum conjugatum, que teve sua importância aumentada de 2008 para 2009, devido à sua adaptação às condições de baixa luminosidade. The {{objective of}} this study was to evaluate the phytosociology of weeds in a coffee plantation under different periods of legume intercropping, along two years. The experiment consisted of nine treatments in a randomized block design with four replications. Treatments were the factorial combination of Jack beans (Canavalia ensiformis) or <b>Hyacinth</b> <b>beans</b> (Dolichos lab-lab) and four periods of intercropping with coffee (30, 60, 90, and 120 days after planting), plus a control treatment with no legume. The legumes were sown in December 2007 and October 2008, cut according to the periods of intercropping, and placed under the coffee plant canopies. Weeds were sampled on the coffee plant inter-rows and canopies, in October 2008, and October 2009, reflecting the effect of treatments after one and two years of cultivation, respectively. The evaluations consisted of the weed community indices, the species' importance value and the relative importance of the most frequent weed species. In both years, seventeen species of weeds, distributed in ten botanical families, were identified, with the most frequent species being Cyperus rotundus, Paspalum conjugatum, Amaranthus retroflexus and Oxalis latifolia. In the first-year, Jack beans (2. 65 t ha- 1) accumulated more mass than <b>Hyacinth</b> <b>beans</b> (1. 89 t ha- 1), but in the second year, the <b>Hyacinth</b> <b>beans</b> accumulated more mass (4. 21 t ha- 1) than the Jack beans (2. 73 t ha- 1). At the end of the two years, the weed flora in the control plot was more similar to the flora under the canopy than on the inter-row flora. In 2008, when <b>Hyacinth</b> <b>beans</b> were intercropped for 90 or 120 days, the relative importance of C. rotundus in the inter-row was higher than in the control. On the other hand, in the second year, the relative importance of this weed was higher in the control plots, and in 2009, the relative importance of this weed was higher in the control. The weed mass in the inter-row was higher than under the coffee plant canopy, possibly due to the shading provided by the trees. C. rotundus was the most important species in both years, followed by Paspalum conjugatum, whose importance increased from 2008 to 2009, possibly due to its adaptation to low light conditions...|$|R

Net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate were found maximum in the A 4 accession. Chlorophyll and carotenoid content were also reported higher in accession A 4. Accession A 4 showed higher nitrate reductase and carbonic anhydrase activities than the other accessions. Nodule-nitrogen and leghaemoglobin content ranged from 5. 267 - 5. 314 % and 0. 110 - 0. 130 mM, respectively. Mineral profiles, viz., nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and calcium content varied from 3. 610 - 3. 643, 0. 338 - 0. 356, 3. 020 - 3. 124 and 1. 764 - 1. 804 %, respectively. Seed protein of all accessions varied from 24. 70 - 25. 06 %. Carbohydrate content ranged from 50. 83 - 53. 16 % across all accessions tested. Accession A 4 produced the highest tyrosinase activity in the seeds...|$|E
40|$|Em área de Latossolo Roxo, localizada na Estação Experimental "Theodureto de Camargo", em Campinas, verificou-se incidência de doença provocando "murcha", com sintomas internos caracterizados pelo escurecimento dos vasos, sucessivamente em plantas de labelabe e em algodoeiro. Em ambas as espécies vegetais determinou-se a presença de fungos do gênero Fusarium, mediante isolamento feito em plantas doentes. Seleções, feitas na referida área, de plantas pertencentes a linhagem de algodoeiro suscetível à murcha de Fusariumderam origem a linhagens que revelaram apreciável resistência quando testadas em solo infestado por Fusarium oxysporum f. vasinfectum (Atk.) Snyder & Hansen. São discutidos aspectos relacionados com a possível descoberta de nova fonte genética de resistência à doença e com a existência desse fungo sob infestação natural na Estação Experimental mencionada. Também é apontada a possibilidade de serem o algodoeiro e a leguminosa em questão hospedeiras do mesmo agente patogênico. The {{occurrence}} of wilt disease, successively in plants of <b>hyacinth</b> <b>bean</b> (Dolichos lablab L.) and cotton, {{was observed in}} a plot of latosolic B (Terra Roxa) soil at the "Theodureto de Camargo" Experiment Station at Campinas, where no Fusarium wilt has been recorded before. Both species presented internal symptoms consisting in darkened vessels. Fungi of the genus Fusarium were isolated from these plants. Plant selection for wilt resistance {{was made in the}} above mentioned area where a Fusarium - susceptible variety (IAG 51 / 1104) of cotton had been planted. The progenies when tested in soils infested by Fusarium oxysporum f. vasinfectum Atk.) Snyder & Hansen revealed fair resistance to wilt. IAG 51 / 1104 comes from a cross between the varieties Delfos and Delta Pineland- 10, both wilt susceptible under field conditions of the State of São Paulo. It is likely that the wilt resistance of some of its progeny might have originated by recombination. It is also pointed out that the wilting agent (F. oxysporum f. vasinfectum) might occur in the "Theodureto de Camargo", Experiment Station and be responsible for the wilt in <b>hyacinth</b> <b>bean</b> and cotton plants...|$|E
40|$|Field {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} at Shambat, Sudan (Latitude 15 ° 40 ´ N and Longitude 32 ° 32 ´ E) in three consecutive seasons (2000 / 03) to investigate the effect of Bradyrhizobium inoculation and chicken manure or sulphur fertilization on minerals composition of <b>hyacinth</b> <b>bean.</b> The results obtained showed that inoculation, chicken manure, sulphur and their interactions significantly (P = 0. 05) improved both major and trace minerals composition of the seeds. The results also indicated that all measured parameters increased with increasing level of chicken manure or sulphur and the highest value of each mineral was observed with either 10 tone/fed chicken manure or 100 kg/fed sulfur with or without Bradyrhizobium inoculation. The study also showed that the residual effect of chicken manure or sulphur significantly (P = 0. 05) improved minerals content particularly at 10 tone/fed chicken manure or 100 kg/fed sulfur with or without Bradyrhizobium inoculation...|$|E
30|$|The GRRP {{illustrates}} a major {{gap between the}} government water management systems and local community needs and desires. According to the stated goals of the GRRP, the central government wants to develop flood control and facilitate drainage {{during the rainy season}} and secure enough water during the summer that freshwater can flow to more southern points in the GDA including Khulna city, Mongla port and the Sundarbans. On the other hand, the focus group participants at Chapra explained to Hossen (2014 : 85 – 86) that they want natural resources back, like siltation, algae, earth-worms and water hyacinth, to promote cropland fertility. They also want to get back water-borne wild vegetables like marsh herb, water lily, ferns and <b>hyacinth</b> <b>bean</b> and natural fisheries like carp, barb and minnow. They {{want to be able to}} make agricultural materials like ploughshares, frames, ladders and sticks from natural resources like bamboo, cane and wood, which are now in short supply.|$|E
