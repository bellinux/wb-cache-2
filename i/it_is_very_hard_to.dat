5|$|A total {{solar eclipse}} {{provides}} {{a rare opportunity}} to observe the corona (the outer layer of the Sun's atmosphere). Normally this is not visible because the photosphere is much brighter than the corona. According to the point reached in the solar cycle, the corona may appear small and symmetric, or large and fuzzy. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> predict this in advance.|$|E
5|$|Found in dry sclerophyll {{forest on}} sandstone-based nutrient-deficient soils, P.linearis {{is adapted to}} a fire-prone environment; the plants resprout epicormic buds from beneath their thick bark after bushfires. The fruit are {{consumed}} by vertebrates such as kangaroo, possums and currawongs. As {{with other members of}} the genus, P.linearis is rare in cultivation as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> propagate, either by seed or cuttings. It adapts readily to cultivation, preferring acidic soils with good drainage and at least a partly sunny aspect.|$|E

A good example is very popular Finnish underground rap artist ASA (formerly known as MC Avain), who has used folk-artists as the accompanying band.

25|$|The most {{important}} fragment is the First Partheneion or Louvre-Partheneion, found in 1855 in Saqqara in Egypt by the French scholar Auguste Mariette. This Partheneion consists of 101 lines, of {{which more than}} 30 are severely damaged. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> say anything about this fragment, and scholars have debated ever since the discovery and publication about its content and the occasion on which this partheneion could have been performed.|$|E

25|$|The phase {{structure}} of quark matter remains mostly conjectural {{because it is}} difficult to perform calculations predicting the properties of quark matter. The reason is that QCD, the theory describing the dominant interaction between quarks, is strongly coupled at the densities and temperatures of greatest physical interest, and hence <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> obtain any predictions from it. Here are brief descriptions of some of the standard approaches.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> come up {{with another}} process that would produce {{deuterium}} other than by nuclear fusion. Such a process would require that the temperature be hot enough to produce deuterium, but not hot enough to produce helium-4, and that this process should immediately cool to non-nuclear temperatures after {{no more than a few}} minutes. It would also be necessary for the deuterium to be swept away before it reoccurs.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> {{estimate}} {{the number of}} Pomaks along with the Turkified Pomaks who live in Turkey, as they have blended into the Turkish society and have been often linguistically and culturally dissimilated. According to Milliyet and Turkish Daily News reports, the number of Pomaks along with the Turkified Pomaks {{in the country is}} about 600,000. According to the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Bulgarian Orthodox Christian community in Turkey stands at 500 members.|$|E

There are also two types of special gymnasiums: The Gymnasium of Mathematics and The Gymnasium of Philology. There are plans for an integrated entrance exam for higher education, as well as unified scoring systems for entrance exams, even for special gymnasiums.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> uniquely {{identify}} neutrino {{interactions among}} the natural background of radioactivity. For this reason, in early experiments a special reaction channel {{was chosen to}} facilitate the identification: the interaction of an antineutrino {{with one of the}} hydrogen nuclei in the water molecules. A hydrogen nucleus is a single proton, so simultaneous nuclear interactions, which would occur within a heavier nucleus, don't need to be considered for the detection experiment. Within a cubic metre of water placed right outside a nuclear reactor, only relatively few such interactions can be recorded, but the setup is now used for measuring the reactor's plutonium production rate.|$|E
25|$|All plywoods bind resin {{and wood}} fibre sheets (cellulose cells are long, strong and thin) {{to form a}} {{composite}} material. This alternation of the grain is called cross-graining and has several important benefits: it reduces the tendency of wood to split when nailed in at the edges; it reduces expansion and shrinkage, providing improved dimensional stability; and it makes {{the strength of the}} panel consistent across all directions. There is usually an odd number of plies, so that the sheet is balancedâ€”this reduces warping. Because plywood is bonded with grains running against one another and with an odd number of composite parts, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> bend it perpendicular to the grain direction of the surface ply.|$|E

25|$|Other {{diseases}} {{are influenced by}} genetics, but the genes a person gets from their parents only change their risk of getting a disease. Most of these {{diseases are}} inherited in a complex way, with either multiple genes involved, or coming from both genes and the environment. As an example, {{the risk of breast}} cancer is 50 times higher in the families most at risk, compared to the families least at risk. This variation is probably due to a large number of alleles, each changing the risk a little bit. Several of the genes have been identified, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, but not all of them. However, although some of the risk is genetic, the risk of this cancer is also increased by being overweight, drinking a lot of alcohol and not exercising. A woman's risk of breast cancer therefore comes from a large number of alleles interacting with her environment, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> predict.|$|E
500|$|Found in dry sclerophyll {{forest on}} sandstone-based nutrient-deficient soils, P.levis {{is adapted to}} a fire-prone environment; the plants resprout epicormic buds from beneath their thick bark after bushfires, and can live for over 60years. Regeneration also takes place after fire by a ground-stored seed bank. [...] The longtongue bee Leioproctus carinatifrons is a {{pollinator}} of the flowers, and the fruit are consumed by vertebrates such as kangaroos, possums and currawongs.

500|$|A breach is {{the result}} of a high speed {{approach}} to the surface with the resulting momentum taking the shark partially or completely clear of the water. This is a hunting technique employed by great white sharks whilst hunting seals. This technique is often used on cape fur seals at Seal Island in False Bay, South Africa. Because the behavior is unpredictable, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> document. It was first photographed by Chris Fallows and Rob Lawrence who developed the technique of towing a slow-moving seal decoy to trick the sharks to breach. Between April and September, scientists may observe around 600 breaches. The seals swim on the surface and the great white sharks launch their predatory attack from the deeper water below. They can reach speeds of up to [...] and can at times launch themselves more than [...] into the air. Just under half of observed breach attacks are successful. In 2011, a [...] long shark jumped onto a seven-person research vessel off Seal Island in Mossel Bay. The crew were undertaking a population study using sardines as bait, and the incident was judged not to be an attack on the boat but an accident.|$|E
