The goal of all occupational {{safety and health}} programs is to foster a safe work environment. As a secondary effect, it may also protect co-workers, family members, employers, customers, suppliers, nearby communities, {{and other members of the}} public who are impacted by the workplace environment. It may involve interactions among many subject areas, including occupational medicine, occupational (or industrial) hygiene, public <b>health,</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> <b>engineering</b> industrial engineering, chemistry, and health physics.

Specific topics discussed included the scope of the national program, major federal government initiatives, the passage of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, definition of acute and chronic musculoskeletal injuries, anatomical structures of concern, multifactored risk model development, methods used for identifying job hazards, nonoccupational factors and the risk of an occupational musculoskeletal injury, fundamental research needed to understand the causes of occupational musculoskeletal injuries, and the research needed to provide the most effective prevention strategies. Evidence indicated that musculoskeletal injuries include the most costly types of occupational injuries and that they affect several million workers each year. Areas needing additional research include identifying hazardous job stressors, objectively measuring and quantifying job stress, identifying people at risk for musculoskeletal injuries, fundamental biomechanics, job hazard surveillance, and industrial planning and social/organizational issues.

40|$|Field {{experiments}} {{have demonstrated that}} piles driven into sand can respond to axial cyclic loading in Stable, Unstable or Meta-Stable ways, depending on the combinations of mean and cyclic loads {{and the number of}} cycles. An understanding of the three styles of responses is provided by experiments involving a highly instrumented model displacement pile and an array of soil stress sensors installed in fine sand in a pressurised calibration chamber. The different patterns of effective stress developing on and around the shaft are reported, along with the results of static load tests that track the effects on shaft capacity. The interpretation links these observations to the sand's stress strain behaviour. The interface-shear characteristics, the kinematic yielding, the local densification, the growth of a fractured interface-shear zone and the restrained dilatancy at the pile soil interface are all found to be important. The model tests are shown to be compatible with the full-scale behaviour and to provide key information for improving the modelling and the design rules. (C) 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

40|$|Far {{from being}} highly {{creative}} and innovative, {{most of us}} are glorified sheep. We follow one another and, in most aspects of our lives, use things other people have created. As Leonard Read articulated in his 1958 essay I Pencil, no one knows how to make a pencil: you would need to know about mining, refining, shaping graphite, sourcing wood, delivering materials, logistics, <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety,</b> <b>and</b> metal <b>engineering.</b> The list goes on. Yet we seem to be in the most innovative and creative periods of our lives. Everyday comes new apps, new inventions and new connections. So how can this be so? This session was created as a direct response to our individual shortfalls. For it is not alone that we can create and innovate, but rather when talents are pooled. Can we understand media innovation processes and unpick them if we work together? Can we open our minds and share our skills in a way to make innovation possible? And can all this be done in a collaborative rapid fire environment across 48 hours? The Medialab Session and Media Innovation Studio brought coders, business minds, entrepreneurs, students, journalism and media professionals from across Europe and America together for 48 hours. Using innovative brain storming and facilitation methods, and a series of workshops, we set out to build five media startups across one weekend. The teams pitched to a panel of expert Dragons to find a winning startup. The process was outputted live through multimedia and social media {{in order to make the}} ecosystem collaborative and open. The event built on Medialab Sessions to date, allowing for findings that can feed into larger discussions around media business models online, and open media innovation processes, as a way to facilitate SME growth across a range of sectors. The UK Medialab Session built on three previous events. This groundwork allowed for the development of an innovation ecosystem, which could be accelerated by the dynamic business culture of the UK. The previous Playgrounds were in Nantes (30 participants, 4 teams, 2 new media launched see), Paris (40 participants, 7 teams, 3 media launched see) and Brussels (20 participants, 5 teams, 4 media launched).

40|$|Abstract: Pneumoconiosis is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} hazardous chronic health diseases in the Hong Kong construction industry. Most frontline workers lack proper education <b>and</b> their <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> awareness is relatively low. Therefore, management of an organization plays a momentous role to implement the control of hazards within organizations <b>and</b> to incorporate <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> into their operations. Personal protective equipment is designed, only after all <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> measures, to remove <b>and</b> to control <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> hazards. In the case of respiratory hazards, the hazard at source is impossible to entirely eliminate. Thus, wearing the personal respiratory protective equipment against the <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> illnesses becomes critical. This paper examines awareness and attitude in using the personal respiratory protec-tive equipment in the Hong Kong construction industry. Questionnaire survey and structured interviews are conducted. From the survey results, it is found that awareness and understanding of the <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> hazards, is insufficient. Moreover, workers are not familiar with the risks of the equipment fitting, <b>and</b> <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety.</b> <b>Health</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> aware-ness can influence <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> attitude <b>and</b> behaviour.
