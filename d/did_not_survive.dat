5|$|Davies {{also notes}} two flaws in Rhys's achievement. One was the {{personal}} {{nature of his}} accord with Henry II, which meant that it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>survive</b> Henry's death.

5000|$|Corrosion {{engineers}} and consultants tend {{to specialize in}} Internal or External corrosion scenarios. In both, they may provide corrosion control recommendations, failure analysis investigations, sell corrosion control products, or provide installation or design of corrosion control and monitoring systems. Every material has its weakness. Aluminum, galvanized/zinc coatings, brass, and copper <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>survive</b> well in very alkaline or very acidic pH environments. Copper and brasses <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>survive</b> well in high nitrate or ammonia environments. Carbon steels and iron <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>survive</b> well in low soil resistivity and high chloride environments. High chloride environments can even overcome and attack steel encased in normally protective concrete. Concrete <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>survive</b> well in high sulfate environments. And nothing survives well in high sulfide and low redox potential environments with corrosive bacteria.|$|R

5|$|The {{extent of}} Rommel's {{involvement}} in the military's resistance against Hitler or the 20 July plot is difficult to ascertain, as people most directly involved <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>survive,</b> and limited documentation of the conspirators' plans and preparations exists. Thus, Rommel's participation remains ambiguous, {{and the perception of}} it largely has its source in subsequent events, (especially Rommel's forced suicide), and the post-war accounts by surviving participants.|$|E

5|$|After {{numerous}} proposals {{the sand}} hills rear {{and north of}} the fort were removed in 1882, improving the fort's land defence and allowing the 64-pounder guns to sweep the Semaphore jetty.
