5|$|Both {{the fights}} between Troilus and Diomedes from the {{traditional}} narrative of Beno√Æt and Guido take place {{the next day in}} Shakespeare's retelling.

But in a deviation from this narrative it is Hector, not Troilus, whom the Myrmidons surround in the climatic battle of the play and whose body is dragged behind Achilles' horse. Troilus himself is left alive vowing revenge for Hector's death and rejecting Pandarus. Troilus' story ends, as <b>it</b> <b>began,</b> <b>in</b> medias res with him and the remaining characters in his love-triangle remaining alive.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the quake}} {{a program of}} {{rebuilding}} was rapidly put into action, but before <b>it</b> <b>began</b> <b>in</b> earnest some important decisions would permanently differentiate many Sicilian cities and towns from other European urban developments. The Viceroy, the Duke of Camastra, aware of new trends in town planning, decreed that rather than rebuilding in the medieval plan of cramped narrow streets, the new rebuilding would offer piazze and wider main streets, often on a rational grid system. The whole plan was often to take a geometric shape such as a perfect square or a hexagon, typical of Renaissance and Baroque town planning. The city of Grammichele represents an example of these new cities rebuilted with a hexagonal plan.|$|E

Aries would then relinquish the X Division Championship and successfully defeated Bobby Roode for the World title.|$|E

5|$|The {{start of}} {{production}} is not clear. A commercial transport ship, the Victoria, took {{the cast and crew}} from Seattle, Washington, to Nome, Alaska.

The Nanuk acted as a mobile base of operations, and as a set for the shipboard scenes. MGM bought the schooner outright during the production.
