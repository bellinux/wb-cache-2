50|$|The World Geographic Reference System (<b>GEOREF)</b> is a grid-based {{method of}} specifying {{locations}} {{on the surface}} of the Earth. <b>GEOREF</b> is essentially based on the geographic system of latitude and longitude, but using a simpler and more flexible notation. <b>GEOREF</b> was used primarily for air navigation, particularly in military or inter-service applications, but it is rarely seen today. However, <b>GEOREF</b> can be used with any map or chart that has latitude and longitude printed on it.|$|E
50|$|<b>GEOREF</b> {{is based}} on the {{standard}} system of latitude and longitude, but uses a simpler and more concise notation. <b>GEOREF</b> divides the Earth's surface into successively smaller quadrangles, with a notation system used to identify each quadrangle within its parent. Unlike latitude/longitude, <b>GEOREF</b> runs in one direction horizontally, east from the 180° meridian; and one direction vertically, north from the South Pole. <b>GEOREF</b> can easily be adapted to give co-ordinates with varying degrees of precision, using a 2-12 character geocode.|$|E

50|$|Extensions to {{the above}} {{notation}} allow the <b>GEOREF</b> system {{to be used to}} designate an area around a reference point. This is achieved by adding an area designation to a base <b>GEOREF</b> co-ordinate. The area designation can be the letter S, to specify the sides of a rectangle (separated by the letter X); or the letter R, to specify the radius of a circle. In both cases the units are nautical miles. In addition, the letter H can be added, followed by an altitude in thousands of feet.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first level}} of <b>GEOREF</b> divides {{the world into}} quadrangles each {{measuring}} 15 degrees of longitude by 15 degrees of latitude; this results in 24 zones of longitude and 12 bands of latitude. A longitude zone is identified by a letter from A to Z (omitting I and O) starting at 180 degrees and progressing eastward through the full 360 degrees of longitude; a latitude band is identified by a letter from A through M (omitting I) northward from the south pole. Hence, any 15 degree quadrangle can be identified by two letters; the easting (longitude) is given first, followed by the northing (latitude). These two letters are the first two characters of a full <b>GEOREF</b> coordinate.|$|E
