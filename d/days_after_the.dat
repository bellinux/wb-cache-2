40|$|We have {{examined}} the changes in random breath variability and pattern indicators in highly skilled athletes before the competitive load and during recovery period. More than 25 % of athletes have significant decrease in the respiratory rate during recovery period. The relation Тi/Тe (p< 0, 05) probably increases <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> game, compared with <b>the</b> next <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> game. The indicators of respiratory volume are probably lower in the recovery period than in the initial state: (p< 0, 05) <b>the</b> next morning <b>after</b> <b>the</b> game and <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> game (р< 0, 01). Dynamics of total breath variability power proves to be informative.
