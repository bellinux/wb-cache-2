40|$|In {{recent years}} the UK has seen a raft of new {{legislation}} concerning <b>equalities</b> and human rights. This legislation, and the policy drivers issued by central government in relation to <b>equalities,</b> is interpreted in varied ways by the local authorities that are tasked with implementing them. Implementation is structured by the organisational cultures present in these institutions and their partner agencies, and in some cases, by the existence of overt or covert homophobia and biphobia. This paper presents findings from an ESRC funded study {{of the impact of}} recent policy changes. Whilst someauthorities {{have a long history of}} sexualities <b>equalities</b> work, heterosexism appears embedded in the cultures of others. This is apparent in the ways in which <b>equalities</b> is discursively framed (or erased), the location of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender <b>equalities</b> at the bottom of the hierarchy of <b>equalities</b> initiatives, resistance to the imposition of LGBT <b>equalities</b> initiatives by staff, and the organisational cultures in which they operate. In some instances, overt homo/biphobia is evident, often reflecting the wider environments in which local authorities operate. Local authority employees in powerful positions may give clear messages to staff on challenging such resistance, but LGBT <b>equalities</b> work can be sabotaged by other individuals, often elected councillors. The tensions that officers have to manage concerning sexualities <b>equalities</b> work, between the remits of elected councillors and the requirements of <b>equalities</b> policies driven by statute, are noticeable. It appears that local authorities remain a site in which heterosexism and homo/biphobia are contested...|$|R

5|$|New Labour {{tended to}} emphasise social justice, {{rather than the}} <b>equality</b> which {{was the focus of}} {{previous}} Labour governments, and challenged the view that social justice and economic efficiency are mutually exclusive. The party's traditional attachment to <b>equality</b> was reduced: Minimum standards and <b>equality</b> of opportunity were promoted over the <b>equality</b> of outcome. The Commission on Social Justice, set up by John Smith, reported in 1994 that the values of social justice were: equal worth of citizens, equal rights to be able to meet their basic needs, the requirement to spread opportunities as much as possible, and the need to remove unjustified inequalities. The party viewed social justice primarily as the requirement to give citizens equal political and economic liberty and also as the need for social citizenship. It encompasses the need for equal distribution of opportunity, with the caveat that things should not be taken from successful people to give to the unsuccessful.|$|E
