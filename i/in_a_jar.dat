5|$|The worm {{removed from}} Bear is kept <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>jar,</b> and another is {{recovered}} {{from one of}} the scientists' bodies. Mulder (believing that the worms are extraterrestrial) wants them kept alive, but Scully feels that they should be destroyed to prevent infection. The group check each other for black nodules and find none, although Mulder reminds Scully that the nodules disappeared from the dog over time. When Mulder finds Murphy in the freezer with his throat cut, the others (including Scully) believe that he has become infected and killed Murphy. Mulder is then locked in a storeroom.|$|E
5|$|After {{a tour of}} the home, {{the girls}} leave the {{watermelon}} in a well to keep it cold. Mac later goes to retrieve the watermelon and does not return. When Fantasy goes to retrieve the watermelon from the well, she finds Mac's head, which flies in the air and bites Fantasy's buttocks before she escapes. The other girls also begin to encounter other supernatural traps throughout the house. The aunt disappears after entering the broken refrigerator, and the girls are attacked or possessed by a series of items in the house, such as Gorgeous becoming possessed after using her aunt's mirror and Sweet disappearing after being attacked by mattresses. These attacks cause the girls to try to escape the house. As soon as Gorgeous walks out the door, the rest of the girls find themselves locked in. The girls try to find the aunt to unlock the door but only find Mac's severed hand <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>jar.</b> Melody begins to play the piano to keep the girl's spirits up as the girls hear Gorgeous singing upstairs. As Prof and Kung Fu go to investigate, Melody's fingers are bitten off by the piano, and it ultimately eats her whole.|$|E
25|$|Sun tea {{is made by}} {{steeping}} the {{tea leaves}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>jar</b> of unheated tap water left in the sun. It does not get hot enough to kill bacteria present on the tea leaves or in the water, such as Alcaligenes viscolactis.|$|E

50|$|If the syahi {{is allowed}} to harden without rubbing it continuously, pockets of {{solidity}} would {{be left in the}} layers and distort the tone and also result in breakage of the grains from the layers within a short span, resulting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>jarring</b> rattling sound during playing.|$|R

25|$|A single {{manuscript}} of the Gospel of Philip, in Coptic (CG II), {{was found in}} the Nag Hammadi library, a cache of documents that was secreted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>jar</b> and buried in the Egyptian desert {{at the end of the}} 4th century. The text was bound in the same codex that contained the better-known Gospel of Thomas.|$|E
40|$|The mixed metaphor {{has long}} been vilified by {{language}} lovers. After all, a metaphor per se is often a stretch. The attempt to combine two or more vastly dissimilar figures of speech usually result <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>jarring</b> incongruity and <b>an</b> absurd image. Such clashes are often amusing, although the humor is strictly unintentional...|$|R

25|$|The title, {{according}} to Fiquito, is a threat: the speaker threatens {{to move to}} a chaotic place (which the author hints is the city of San Juan, Puerto Rico, but {{according to}} Fiquito could better be suited to describe Puerto Ricans in Orlando, Florida. The column's logo pictures a brain preserved <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>jar,</b> with sunglasses in the outside as to resemble the brain as being ready for a sunny day.|$|E
25|$|In 1866, Georges Leclanché {{invented a}} battery that {{consisted}} of a zinc anode and a manganese dioxide cathode wrapped in a porous material, dipped <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>jar</b> of ammonium chloride solution. The manganese dioxide cathode had a little carbon mixed into it as well, which improved conductivity and absorption. It provided a voltage of 1.4 volts. This cell achieved very quick success in telegraphy, signalling and electric bell work.|$|E
25|$|Glass {{or plastic}} jars are an {{efficient}} method of storing and preserving jam. Though sugar can keep for exceedingly long times, containing it <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>jar</b> {{is far more}} useful than older methods. Other methods of packaging jam, especially for industrially produced products, include cans and plastic packets, especially used in the food service industry for individual servings. Fruit preserves typically are of low water activity and can be stored at room temperature after opening, if used within {{a short period of}} time.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the main cast, Frank Welker voiced Nibbler and Kath Soucie voiced Cubert and several supporting and minor characters. Like The Simpsons, many episodes of Futurama feature guest voices {{from a wide range}} of professions, including actors, entertainers, bands, musicians, and scientists. Many guest-stars voiced supporting characters, although many voiced themselves, usually as their own head preserved <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>jar.</b> Recurring guest stars included Dawnn Lewis (as Hermes' wife LaBarbara), Tom Kenny, Dan Castellaneta (as the Robot Devil), Al Gore, and George Takei, among others.|$|E
25|$|With tiny {{pieces of}} the hanging rope already being sold as souvenirs to a fascinated public, rumors {{immediately}} began to swirl that jail guards planned to dig up Guiteau's corpse to meet demands of this burgeoning new market. Fearing scandal, {{the decision was made}} to disinter the corpse. The body was sent to the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Maryland, which preserved Guiteau's brain as well as his enlarged spleen discovered at autopsy and bleached the skeleton. These were placed in storage by the museum. Parts of Guiteau's brain remain on display <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>jar</b> at the Mütter Museum in Philadelphia.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has {{published}} best practices for cleanup of broken CFLs, {{as well as}} ways to avoid breakage, on its web site. It recommends airing out the room and carefully disposing of broken pieces <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>jar.</b> A Maine Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) study of 2008 comparing clean-up methods warns that using plastic bags to store broken CFL bulbs is dangerous because vapors well above safe levels continue to leak from the bags. The EPA and the Maine DEP recommend a sealed glass jar as the best repository for a broken bulb.|$|E

25|$|Holy wells {{were often}} visited at Beltane, {{and at the}} other Gaelic festivals of Imbolc and Lughnasadh. Visitors to holy wells would pray for health while walking sunwise (moving from east to west) around the well. They would then leave offerings; {{typically}} coins or clooties (see clootie well). The first water drawn from a well on Beltane was seen as being especially potent, as was Beltane morning dew. At dawn on Beltane, maidens would roll in the dew or wash their faces with it. It would also be collected <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>jar,</b> left in the sunlight, and then filtered. The dew was thought to increase sexual attractiveness, maintain youthfulness, and help with skin ailments.|$|E
25|$|Finally {{going to}} Jack's backyard, Nick and Laurie find what Jack {{had meant to}} give them: a small pool filled with lime and muck with Taloa and two of her sisters, Ooki and Ibi, whom Jack had {{captured}} some days earlier. Meanwhile, Mallory goes into the sinkhole to investigate, but finds herself unable to breathe and surrounded by the small snake-like dragons. They manage {{to get her out}} and put three of the creatures <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>jar.</b> They figure that the creatures produce methane, which makes the air around them unbreathable, and realize that these were the creatures that the giants ate in order to breathe fire (which they originally believed to be salamanders).|$|E
25|$|The man {{is passed}} by two {{container}} ships, {{which do not}} see him, despite his use of signaling flares. He drifts out of the shipping lane with no food and water. On the eighth day, he writes a letter, puts it <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>jar,</b> and throws it in the water as a message in a bottle. Later that night, he sees a light in the distance. He tears pages from his journal along with charts to create a signal fire. The fire grows {{out of control and}} consumes his raft. He falls into the water and allows himself to sink. Underwater, he sees the hull of a boat with a search light approaching his burning raft. He swims up towards the surface to grasp an outstretched hand.|$|E

25|$|Jenkem is a {{supposed}} inhalant and hallucinogen created from fermented human waste. In the mid-1990s, {{it was reported}} to be a popular street drug among Zambian street children. They would put the feces and urine <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>jar</b> and cover it with a balloon then let it ferment out in the sun, then afterwards they would inhale the fumes created. In November 2007, there was a moral panic in the United States after widespread reports of jenkem becoming a popular recreational drug in middle and high schools, though the true extent of the practice has since been called into question. Several sources reported that the increase in American media coverage was based on a hoax and on faulty Internet research.|$|E
25|$|Indoors, an avocado tree {{is usually}} grown from {{the pit of}} an avocado fruit. This is often done by {{removing}} the pit from a ripe, unrefrigerated avocado fruit. The pit is then stabbed {{with three or four}} toothpicks, about one-third of the way up from the flat end. The pit is placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>jar</b> or vase containing tepid water. It should split in four to six weeks and yield roots and a sprout. If there is no change by this time, the avocado pit is discarded. Once the stem has grown a few inches, it is placed in a pot with soil. It should be watered every few days. Avocados have been known to grow large, so owners must be ready to re-pot the plant several times.|$|E
25|$|Point Lookout, {{unlike the}} other pieces of {{downloadable}} content, {{does not have a}} specific goal. Rather, it adds a large area for the player to explore, with new enemies, such as the swamp mirelurk, swamp ghoul, and swampfolk, and items to find, such as the lever-action rifle, axe, and double barrel shotgun. One major quest line focuses on the rivalry between Desmond Lockheart and Professor Calvert, two scientists who have been feuding since before the Great War. Desmond has survived as a ghoul, while Calvert became a living brain <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>jar.</b> The feud can be ended by the player in either Desmond's or Calvert's favor. Other quests include following the trail of a long-dead Chinese spy and discovering the mystery of the Lovecraftian tome known as the Krivbeknih.|$|E
