25|$|In 1902, Buber {{became the}} <b>editor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>weekly</b> Die Welt, the central {{organ of the}} Zionist movement. However, {{a year later he}} became {{involved}} with the Jewish Hasidim movement. Buber admired how the Hasidic communities actualized their religion in daily life and culture.

In 1904, he withdrew from much of his Zionist organizational work, and devoted himself to study and writing. In that year, he published his thesis, Beiträge zur Geschichte des Individuationsproblems, on Jakob Böhme and Nikolaus Cusanus.|$|E

I have always had such moments in my work, and if I cannot fitly boast of them, I can at least own to them in freedom from the pride that goes before a fall.

In this case, I had really such a very good grip of my characters that I need {{not have had the}} usual fear of their failure to work out their destiny. But even when the thing was done and I carried the completed manuscript to my dear old friend, the late Henry Loomis Nelson, then <b>editor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Weekly,</b> it was in more fear of his judgment than I cared to show. As often happened with my manuscript in such exigencies, it seemed to go all to a handful of shrivelled leaves. When we met again and he accepted it for the Weekly, with a handclasp of hearty welcome, I could scarcely gasp out my unfeigned relief. We had talked the scheme of it over together; he had liked the notion, and he easily made me believe, after my first dismay, that he liked the result even better.|$|E
