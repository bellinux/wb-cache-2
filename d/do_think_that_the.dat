2500|$|In February 2015, Ayako Sono, {{a former}} member of an {{education}} reform panel, wrote a controversial column in Sankei Shimbun suggesting that more foreign workers be imported to meet labor shortages, but that they be separated from native Japanese in a system of apartheid. She later explained [...] "I have never commended apartheid, but I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> existence of a ‘Chinatown’ or ‘Little Tokyo’ is a good thing." ...|$|E

"I {{certainly}} <b>did</b> <b>think,</b> Mr. Philip," [...] {{said the}} gentleman alluded to, a very young-looking, apple-faced little man, with a timid manner, {{who stood in}} the background nervously rubbing his dry hands together--"I certainly <b>did</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> squire looked aged when I saw him this morning." ...|$|R
5000|$|... 1946: In {{the novel}} Joy in the Morning by P. G. Wodehouse, Boko Fittleworth commiserates with Bertie Wooster on {{learning}} that Bertie, rather than Stilton Cheesewright, has become engaged to Florence Craye by saying, [...] "I <b>did</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> black spot had finally passed into Stilton's possession." ...|$|R

60|$|At {{the same}} time I <b>DO</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Government makes a mistake in taxing the profits of the poor book writers under the absurd name of INCOME. But let that go. The Kaiser would {{probably}} treat us worse.|$|E

50|$|Why Herodotus used Kyrnos and {{not some}} other name remains a mystery, and the phrases of the authors give no clue. The Roman historians, however, {{believed}} Corsa or Corsica (rightly or wrongly they interpreted -ica as an adjectival formative ending) was the native name of the island, {{but they could not}} give an explanation of its meaning. They <b>did</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> natives were originally Ligures.|$|R

5000|$|Another policy, EMA, also {{encourages}} more choice, as it enables {{students from a}} low income family ( [...] e.g., working class) to have education equal to those from any class or ethnicity by providing an educational maintenance allowance that helps students stay in school past 16. Witty <b>does</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> EMA policy helps keep working class students continue past 16, but he <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> higher education fees stops them going further.|$|R

"I am here, my worthy incognito," [...] {{cried the}} other, {{with the voice}} of perfect good nature; [...] "lying {{in the lap of}} mother earth, and all the better for opening a vein or two in my right leg;--though I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> same effect might have been {{produced}} without treating the bone so roughly!--But I opine that I saw you also reclining on the bosom of our common ancestor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Ned; I am {{sure they}} are not white; then they must be mutineers. Look! Look! Don't you see they have got three prisoners?

6000|$|There is (1) {{the mention}} of a Paduan adventure, {{the basis of the}} plot, a thing that Sprot is very {{unlikely}} to have invented. With all my admiration for Sprot, I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Paduan touch is beyond him. This occurs in Letter IV, ‘the good sport that M.A., your lordship’s brother, told me of a nobleman in Padua. It is a parasteur’ (? à propos) ‘to this purpose we have in hand.’ This appears in Letter I, ‘reckless toys of Padua,’ and in Letter V, ‘bid M. A. remember on the sport he told me of Padua.’ ...|$|E

Because he sacrifices his time and his money and all his {{holidays}} to go and look after her affairs, this is to be said of him! She hasn't another human being to look after her, and, therefore, he is obliged to do it. Of course he has told me all about it.

6000|$|... 'One thing I <b>do</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> being conversant {{only with}} {{thoughtful}} educated Christians {{may result in}} a person ignoring the simpler idea of the Eucharist which does not in the least divest it of its mysterious character, but rather, recognising the mystery, seeks for no solution of it. How can I teach my fifteen Melanesian Communicants the points which I suppose an advanced Ritualist would regard as most essential? But I can give them the actual words of some of the ancient, really ancient, Liturgies, and teach them what Christ said, and St. Paul said, and the Church of England says, and bid them acquiesce in the mystery.|$|E
60|$|In {{the case}} supposed, the teacher {{concluded}} {{to appeal to}} emulation. While I describe the measure he adopted, let it be remembered that I am now only approving of the resort to ingenuity and invention, and the employment of moral and intellectual means, for the accomplishment of his purposes, and not of the measures themselves. I {{do not think the}} plan I am going to describe a wise one; but I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> teacher, while trying it, must have been interested in his intellectual experiment. His business, while pursued in such a way, could not have been a mere dull and uninteresting routine.|$|E

"It {{might have}} been well," [...] {{continued}} Armstrong, slowly, while a sad expression clouded his face for a few moments, [...] "if I had waited, and many a time has my conscience smitten me for my haste.

Emmy most unaccountably fell in love wi' me--thank God! for I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> greatest earthly blessing that can be given to mortal man is {{the love of a}} gentle, true-hearted girl. The wealth of the Indies cannot purchase that, and nothing else in life can supply the want of it. Can you wonder that I grasped the treasure when within my reach?" ...|$|E

50|$|At {{this time}} in Bourgneuf-la-Forêt, there was a battle between the Chouans the revolutionaries. They were beaten with loss of 18 dead. <b>The</b> sources {{reported}} <b>that</b> an unknown royalist appeared suddenly during the battle, took command of Chouans and would be withdrawn once the victory gained. Although this story appears in part legendary, and magnified by the royalist authors, the presence near the head of <b>the</b> Breton Association <b>did</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> man in question could be La Rouërie.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly I do. I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> England {{which we}} know could not be the England that she is but for the {{maintenance}} of a high-minded, proud, and self-denying nobility. And though with us there is no line dividing our very broad aristocracy into two parts, a higher and a lower, or a greater and a smaller, or a richer and a poorer, nevertheless we all feel that the success of our order depends chiefly on the conduct of those whose rank is the highest and whose means are the greatest. To some few, among whom you are conspicuously one, wealth has been given so great and rank so high that much of the welfare of your country depends on the manner in which you bear yourself as the Duke of Omnium." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wonder too," [...] Godfrey said. [...] "I suppose if I {{had been}} {{a year or two}} older they would have done so; but I can assure you I had not the {{slightest}} idea that Petroff and Akim were Nihilists. I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> country is horribly misgoverned, but as a foreigner that was no business of mine; and however strongly I felt, I would have {{had nothing to do with}} men who tried to gain their end by assassination. I was just as innocent in the affair of Ossinsky. I behaved like a fool, I grant, but that was all. I had met the woman, who as I now know was Sophia Perovskaia, but she was only known to me then from having met her once in Petroff and Akim's room, and she was introduced to me as Akim's cousin Katia. I met her at the Opera-house, and she told me a cock-and-bull story about a young officer who had come to see a lady there, and had left his regiment at Moscow without leave to do so. His colonel, who was at the Opera-house, had heard of his being there and was looking for him, and I was persuaded to change dominoes with him to enable him to slip off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I should say, Pierre, {{keep your}} eyes open and escape if you {{possibly}} can before the assault takes place. I should think some might manage to get out as women, but, of course you would have to sacrifice your mustaches. But if you did that, and borrowed the papers of some young woman or other, you might manage it. No doubt it would be awkward if you were found out, but it might be worth trying. If I cannot leave before the assault takes place I mean to go to one of the English hotels here, Meurice's or the Dover, and establish myself there. During such fighting as there may be in the streets, there will be very few questions asked, and one might be shot before one could explain one was a foreigner, but the hotels {{are not likely to be}} disturbed. Seriously I should say that the best thing you can all do when the fighting begins in the streets, is to keep out of the way until your battalion is engaged, then burn anything in the way of uniform, get rid of your rifle somehow, and gather at Goudé's. He could vouch for you all as being his pupils, and as being wholly opposed to the Commune. His name should be sufficiently well known, if not to the first officer who may arrive, at least, to many officers, for his testimony to be accepted. Still, I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> best plan of all will be to get out of the place when you get a chance." ...|$|E
60|$|Suppose {{a philosopher}} {{had a great}} deal of money to spend--though this is not in {{accordance}} with experience, it is not inherently impossible--and suppose he thought, as any philosopher <b>does</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> British public ought to read much more and better books than they do, and that founding public libraries was the way to induce them to do so, what sort of public libraries would he found? That, I submit, is a suitable topic for a disinterested speculator.|$|R
