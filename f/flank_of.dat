The three-pronged attack forced the Byzantine left wing to abandon the Muslim positions they had gained on, and Amr regained his lost ground and started reorganizing his corps for another round.|$|E
5|$|Simultaneous {{with the}} battle at Thermopylae, an Allied naval force of 271 triremes defended the Straits of Artemisium against the Persians, thus {{protecting}} the <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> the forces at Thermopylae. Here the Allied fleet held off the Persians for three days; however, {{on the third}} evening the Allies received news of the fate of Leonidas and the Allied troops at Thermopylae. Since the Allied fleet was badly damaged, and since it no longer needed to defend the <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> Thermopylae, the Allies retreated from Artemisium to the island of Salamis.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd Panzer Division, {{advancing}} on {{the left}} <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> Großdeutschland, made good progress {{and by the end}} of the day had captured Gertsovka and reached Mikhailovka. The 167th Infantry Division, on the right <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> the 11th Panzer Division, also made sufficient progress, reaching Tirechnoe by the end of the day. By the end of 5 July, a wedge had been created in the first belt of the Soviet defences.|$|E

5|$|The {{unexpected}} French advance {{from the}} west and the fall of the Shevardino redoubt threw the Russian formation into disarray. Since the left <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> their defensive position had collapsed, Russian forces withdrew to the east, constructing a makeshift position centered around the village of Utitsa. The left <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> the Russian position was thus ripe for a flanking attack.|$|E
5000|$|Cinder cones are {{commonly}} {{found on the}} <b>flanks</b> <b>of</b> shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes, and calderas.

5|$|At {{least five}} hot springs exist in valleys near Mount Cayley, {{providing}} more evidence for magmatic activity. This includes springs found at Shovelnose Creek and Turbid Creek {{on the southern}} <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> Mount Cayley and Brandywine Creek on the eastern <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> the volcanic field. They are generally found in areas of volcanic activity that are geologically young. As the regional surface water percolates downward through rocks below the Mount Cayley field, it reaches areas of high temperatures surrounding an active or recently solidified magma reservoir. Here, the water is heated, becomes less dense and rises {{back to the surface}} along fissures or cracks. These features are sometimes referred to as dying volcanoes because they seem to represent the last stage of volcanic activity as the magma at depth cools and hardens.|$|E
5|$|Fin whales {{suffer from}} a number of {{pathological}} conditions. The parasitic copepod Pennella balaenopterae—usually found on the <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> fin whales—burrows into their blubber to feed on their blood, while the pseudo-stalked barnacle Xenobalanus globicipitis is generally found more often on the dorsal fin, pectoral fins, and flukes.|$|E
5|$|General General Bernard Montgomery (commanding {{the ground}} forces in Normandy), wanted {{an attack on}} the eastern <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> the front to capture Falaise, {{intending}} that such a move would precipitate a general German collapse. The First Canadian Army (Lieutenant General Harry Crerar), held this part of the Allied front. It consisted of the British I Corps, responsible for the extreme eastern <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> the Allied lines and II Canadian Corps (Lieutenant General Guy Simonds) south of Caen. The II Canadian Corps, which was to launch Operation Totalize consisted of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, 3rd Canadian Infantry Division, 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division, 51st (Highland) Infantry Division, 4th Canadian (Armoured) Division, 1st Polish Armoured Division, 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade and the British 33rd Armoured Brigade.|$|E

5|$|Guderian's {{plan for}} 13 May was straightforward. The 2nd Panzer Division {{in the north}} was to form the right <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> the assaulting force when it reached the Meuse near Donchery. The 1st Panzer Division, {{reinforced}} by the Infantry Regiment Großdeutschland, a battalion of assault engineers, and divisional artillery of the 2nd and 10th Panzer Divisions, {{was to make the}} main attack by crossing the Meuse just north of Sedan and seizing the Heights of la Marfee overlooking the city. The 10th Panzer Division was to cross the Meuse south of Sedan and protect the southern <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> the corps. Throughout the day, large masses of troops and equipment assembled north of the Meuse in preparation for the river crossing.|$|E
