25|$|This is characterised by a {{physical}} obstruction of the intestine, {{which can be}} due to impacted food material, stricture formation, or foreign bodies. The primary pathophysiological abnormality caused by this obstruction {{is related to the}} trapping of fluid within the intestine oral to the obstruction. This is due to the large amount of fluid produced in the upper gastrointestinal tract, and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> primarily re-absorbed in parts of the intestine downstream from the obstruction. The first problem with this degree of fluid loss from circulation is one of decreased plasma volume, leading to a reduced cardiac output, and acid-base disturbances.|$|E
25|$|This {{work has}} been avoided in some {{discourse}} on Beuys {{because he has been}} put in artistically sacrosanct position and this is not in conformance with Beuys' other work. In choosing to do a piece in the form of popular music, Beuys demonstrated a commitment to his views and the most expansive ways of having them reach people. While it is easy to resist and ridicule Beuys' efforts in the pop arena, it does not change the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> an important part of his collected works that needs to be acknowledged to better understand his scope, intention and own views of art.|$|E

25|$|Though {{golf and}} auto racing {{are in their}} off-seasons on Thanksgiving, there are events in those sports that take place on Thanksgiving weekend. The Turkey Night Grand Prix is an annual {{automobile}} race that takes place at various venues in southern California on Thanksgiving night; {{due in part to}} the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> after the Sprint Cup Series and IZOD IndyCar Series have finished their seasons, it allows some of the top racers in the United States to participate. In golf, Thanksgiving weekend was the traditional time of the Skins Game from 1983 to 2008; the event was canceled in 2009 due to a lack of sponsorship and a difficulty in drawing star talent. A return was, at the time of the cancellation, planned for the next year, but no skins game has been included on the PGA Tour schedule since that time.|$|E
25|$|Velator Quay and the {{surrounding}} area is used as a mooring for small boats. In 2006 Braunton council blocked vehicular access to the quay as it was found to be in danger of collapse. An engineering survey was conducted on the quay in 2010, by consultants Bolgar Sykes, as the council were hoping to make it more of an amenity. The survey revealed several possible options for repair, ranging in cost from £80,000 to £400,000. The limited budget available to the council for such work meant that only basic repairs were considered. A subsequent report by Peter Lord, one of the parish counsellors, recommended that demolition of the quay would be the best long-term option, with the provision of a slipway to assist boat owners. The quay is widely held to be a free port, this status having been awarded to Barnstaple seamen who fought against the Spanish Armada. However, the report highlighted the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> likely to be just a local legend, as the quay was not constructed until 300 years after the event.|$|E
500|$|Laws {{should be}} [...] "prospective, open and clear". The {{meaning of the}} law should not be [...] "ambiguous, vague, obscure or imprecise", and the law must be {{sufficiently}} publicized.

[...] "That was an incredible scene," [...] reflected Lincoln. [...] "We were so lucky to get such cracking actors.

Gaming website PlayStation LifeStyle's Heath Hindman {{was impressed by}} the darker presentation, calling it [...] "powerful and well done throughout", and was impressed with the characters despite some awkward introductory scenes. Erren Van Duine, writing for RPG Site, said that fans would appreciate the scale of the narrative, and praised the handling of the Fabula Nova Crystallis mythos. She did note that some plot points seemed only included for the sake of convenience, and that the ending forced a second playthrough to see the whole story.|$|E

Her position could be {{compared with that of}} her contemporary Amalia Assur, who was given special dispensation to practice dentistry despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> in <b>fact</b> prohibited for females. An additional reason for her acquittal was the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Åhrberg was foremost active as a surgeon, and that the medicals she offered her patients for inner illnesses were normally natural herbals.|$|R

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews. The A.V.

Murray thought the climax was [...] "so exciting" [...] that he was willing [...] "to forgive the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the third week in a row that Walter's big idea has involved some kind of communication with the unconscious". IGN's Travis Fickett rated it 7.5/10, writing that {{he thought it was}} a solid episode because the [...] "characters are coming together nicely, the story is better than last week's – but already it seems the show is hitting a formula". Fickett expressed worriment that Fringe would eventually become too formulaic, much like the first season of Smallville, and concluded his review by calling Fringe [...] "a solid show, but [...] exceptional yet".|$|E
500|$|Verdi and Strepponi {{moved into}} Sant'Agata on 1 May 1851. May also brought an offer {{for a new}} opera from La Fenice, which Verdi {{eventually}} realised as La traviata. That was followed by {{an agreement with the}} Rome Opera company to present Il trovatore for January 1853. Verdi now had sufficient earnings to retire, should he have wished to do so. He had reached a stage where he could develop his operas as he wished, rather than be dependent on commissions from third parties. [...] Il trovatore was in fact the first opera he wrote without a specific commission (apart from Oberto). At around the same time he began to consider creating an opera from Shakespeare's King Lear. After first (1850) seeking a libretto from Cammarano (which never appeared), Verdi later (1857) commissioned one from Antonio Somma, but this proved intractable, and no music was ever written. Verdi began work on Il trovatore {{after the death of his}} mother in June 1851. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> [...] "the one opera of Verdi's which focuses on a mother rather than a father" [...] is perhaps related to her death.|$|E
