5|$|During {{the preseason}} in 2002, Alford injured <b>his</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> {{required}} arthroscopic surgery. Prior to {{returning to the}} lineup, Alford {{was released from the}} team due to new head coach Gary Etcheverry's desire to focus on the running game. He briefly joined the practice squad of the Ottawa Renegades, but later re-signed with the Argonauts to their own practice squad.|$|E
5|$|Frustrated {{by what he}} {{felt was}} too much individualism in the game, Schriner {{contemplated}} retiring from professional hockey in favour of taking up a coaching position in Alberta's senior league. He {{had a change of}} heart and returned to the Leafs for the 1942–43 NHL season. Schriner again announced his intention to leave the game in June 1943, this time citing past injuries to <b>his</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> dissatisfaction with Leafs' owner Conn Smythe's contract offer for the following season.|$|E
5|$|Sweden {{managed to}} qualify to the European U21 Championship in Czech Republic {{for the first}} time since 2004 after a {{successful}} qualification. In an exhibition game against Portugal U21 in early 2013, Augustinsson injured <b>his</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> was later out for the rest of the year, which meant he missed most of the qualification games. He was however Håkan Ericson's first choice at the left-back position when he was available and was part of the squad in the games of 2014.|$|E

5|$|After {{more than}} a year since the band's last concert, Megadeth {{returned}} as a live act in June 1997, beginning a world tour with the Misfits and touring in the United States with Life of Agony and Coal Chamber. In July, the band participated in Ozzfest '98 but, halfway through the tour, Menza reportedly discovered a tumor on <b>his</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> left to undergo surgery. Jimmy DeGrasso, who had collaborated with Mustaine in MD.45, was hired to replace Menza {{for the remainder of the}} tour. Though initially meant to be a temporary replacement, DeGrasso joined the band permanently after the tour. Mustaine later said that he dismissed Menza from the band because he believed the drummer had lied about having cancer.|$|E
5|$|Duncan {{started the}} 2008–09 season with strong showings in points and rebounds per game. However, by mid-season, his {{performance}} declined {{and he was}} subsequently diagnosed with chronic knee tendinosis. Despite Duncan having problems with <b>his</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> the team losing the services of shooting guard Ginóbili {{for most of the}} season, San Antonio qualified for the playoffs as the third seed with a 54–28 record. Coupled with an aging supporting cast (Bowen, Michael Finley and Kurt Thomas were all in their late 30s), however, the Spurs were only considered fringe contenders for the championship. As it turned out, Duncan and Parker were not enough to help the Spurs avoid a 4–1 defeat by Dallas, and the Spurs were eliminated {{in the first round of}} the playoffs for the first time since 2000.|$|E
5|$|Dyer was {{a popular}} choice with boxing promoters, helped {{by the fact that}} after each bout he would sing Thora, a popular hit of the day to the audience. His careers as a pugilist and {{baritone}} earned him the nickname, 'The Singing Boxer'. His first few bouts were all held in south Wales, but by the autumn of 1910 he was travelling to England to fight, and on 10 October 1910 he was invited to fight at the National Sporting Club in Covent Garden, London. On 15 May 1911 Dyer was scheduled to fight Dick Emden at The Ring in Blackfriars, London. To date, Dyer had recorded over 15 bouts and was unbeaten but the fight with Emden ended in defeat and affected his future boxing career. Dyer was easily ahead in the bout, when in the fifth round he dislocated <b>his</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> fell to the canvas in agony. Emden, who taunted the fallen Dyer, was given the victory and Dyer would not fight for another six months. The injury to his right knee plagued Dyer throughout his entire boxing career, and also stopped him serving in the armed forces during the First World War. After the injury, Dyer always fought with a protector strapped around <b>his</b> <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> was forced to change his fighting style. He would always stand on the toes of his right foot, as a quick back step could possibly dislocate his knee again. His return bout in November 1911 was a win against Young Lilley at The Ring, but this was again followed by a long absence. Dyer did not fight again until 1 June 1912.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970–71 NBA season, the Lakers {{resigned}} Gail Goodrich, {{who came}} back from the Phoenix Suns after playing for L.A. until 1968. At age 32, West averaged 27.9points, 4.6rebounds and 9.5assists, and helped the Lakers win 46 games and make the 1971 NBA Playoffs. After losing Elgin Baylor to an Achilles tendon rupture that effectively ended his career, West himself injured <b>his</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> was out for the season; the short-handed Lakers lost the Western Conference Finals in five games to the championship-bound Milwaukee Bucks. The Milwaukee Bucks featured freshly crowned Most Valuable Player Lew Alcindor (later known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) and veteran Hall-of-Fame guard Oscar Robertson.|$|E
5|$|Injuries {{would again}} limit Sakic's playing {{time in the}} 1997–98 season. While playing in his first Olympics with Team Canada, Sakic hurt <b>his</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> was forced to miss 18 games with the Avalanche. In the 64 games he did play in, he still scored 63 points, enough to earn him his seventh All-Star appearance. He finally rebounded from his injury {{problems}} in the 1998–99 season, finishing fifth {{in the league in}} scoring with 41 goals and 96 points in only 73 games. He led the Avalanche all the way to within one game of the Stanley Cup Finals, where they lost to the eventual champion Dallas Stars. After the season ended, Sakic was ranked number 94 on The Hockey News list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players.|$|E
5|$|Michael takes Holly on a {{walk through}} the office, {{pointing}} out the locations of various events throughout their courtship. He {{opens the door to}} the kitchen, revealing all of the other employees holding candles. Various members of the office ask Holly if she will marry them (all of Michael's plan) and she politely says no. Michael then leads Holly out to her desk, which is surrounded by dozens of candles. Michael gets down on <b>his</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> begins to make a speech when the sprinklers go off from the candles. The water drenches everyone in the office and Michael proposes. Holly accepts. Everyone then begins to congratulate Michael. However, Michael announces he is moving to Colorado with Holly. The scene ends with his employees in shock.|$|E

5|$|Named at centre half-back for Victoria in {{the game}} against Western Australia, Nash arrived in Perth with such a severe cold {{he was unable to}} train in the lead up to match. Nash injured <b>his</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> ankle in Victoria's win over Western Australia in Perth in early July and was unable to train for a week. While Nash did not miss any matches due to the injuries, they bothered him {{throughout}} the season and he was forced to miss South Melbourne Footballers' weekly dance at the Lake Oval Social Hall. Although carrying injuries, Nash continued to show his versatility, playing around the ground and led South Melbourne to the Grand Final, their third in a row, only to be defeated by Collingwood.|$|E
5|$|Speedie, by then 33 years old, {{joined the}} Roughriders despite {{the threat of}} legal action. Speedie had a league-leading seven touchdowns in 1953, and 576 {{receiving}} yards the following season. He {{was sent to the}} WIFU's BC Lions in 1955, but played only one game for the club. Speedie hurt his left knee and was declared out for the season. He had suffered a hairline leg fracture and underwent surgery on torn ligaments in <b>his</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> ankle. He was expected to scout for the Lions as he recovered. After the injury, Speedie was cut from the Lions' roster and did not play professional football again.|$|E
5|$|The Washington Huskies had outscored {{their opponents}} 20337 {{during the regular}} season, {{excluding}} the games against New York and Mississippi. Washington's running backs, George Wilson and Elmer Tesreau, led their offense during the season, each gaining several hundred rushing yards. However, Tesreau was suffering from boils on <b>his</b> <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> his coaches urged him to not play in the Rose Bowl. The Washington defense was considered superior to that of Navy, being much larger on average. Washington's defense had been very effective during the regular season, holding five teams scoreless and allowing more than ten points to be scored against them only once. Washington's special teams {{were considered to be}} average.|$|E

5|$|After {{the opening}} kickoff, Michigan drove 80 {{yards for a}} {{touchdown}} on a 2-yard run by quarterback Denard Robinson. On its second possession, Michigan drove the ball 88 yards and took a 14–0 lead on a 47-yard run by Robinson. Michigan began its third possession at its own 9-yard line. Robinson ran 46 yards on the first play of the drive, but he injured <b>his</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> did not return to the game. Devin Gardner substituted for Robinson and concluded the drive with an 11-yard touchdown pass to Jeremy Gallon. Michigan led 21–0 {{at the end of the}} first quarter, but Bowling Green scored 14 unanswered points in the second quarter on a 1-yard run by Jordan Hopgood and a 71-yard reception by Tyrone Pronty. With Michigan's lead cut to 7 points, Tate Forcier entered the game late in the second quarter. Forcier completed all 6 of his passes in leading the team on 69-yard touchdown drive to give Michigan a 28–14 lead at halftime.|$|E
5|$|Due to a {{combination}} of the Browns drafting Clifford Charlton and Junkin's desire to move back inside, the Browns planned to move him back to inside linebacker for the 1988 season. He spent training camp competing with Eddie Johnson for the second inside linebacker position alongside Mike Johnson, {{and by the end of}} preseason play, Junkin had won the starting job. In his first career start against the Kansas City Chiefs, Junkin had six tackles, including the first one of the game in a 6–3 Browns win. A month later, Junkin injured <b>his</b> <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> was forced to miss several games. He returned to the team in early November, but Johnson had played so well in Junkin's absence that he spent the next few weeks as the backup inside linebacker. He was given the starting job again to end the season, but missed tackles and a lack of impact plays led to his second season being considered a disappointment.|$|E
5|$|Federer {{started his}} {{season in the}} Brisbane International as the {{defending}} champion, despite having a virus when the tournament started. However, in a rematch of the previous year's final, he lost in the final to Milos Raonic in straight sets. Federer then participated at the 2016 Australian Open and rebounded from his third round defeat by Andreas Seppi in 2015 by reaching the semifinals but lost to eventual champion Novak Djokovic in four sets. The day after his loss to Djokovic, Federer sustained a knee injury and in early February, he underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair a torn meniscus in <b>his</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> missed the tournaments in Rotterdam, Dubai and Indian Wells in February and March. He was scheduled to return to action in Miami. Due to a stomach virus he had to withdraw from Miami thus prolonging his time on the sidelines.|$|E

5|$|Hampered by terrible pain in {{his left}} knee during the 1960–61 NHL season, Plante was sent down to the minor league Montreal Royals. Torn {{cartilage}} was found in <b>his</b> <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> the knee was surgically repaired {{during the summer of}} 1961. The next season Plante became only the fourth goaltender to win the Hart Memorial Trophy – he also won the Vezina Trophy for the sixth time. The 1962–63 season was unsettling for Plante. His asthma had worsened, and he missed most of the early season. His relationship with his coach, Toe Blake, continued to deteriorate because of Plante's persistent health problems. Later, Plante {{was at the center of}} a major controversy when he claimed that net sizes in the NHL were not uniform, thus giving a statistical advantage to goaltenders playing for the Chicago Black Hawks, Boston Bruins, and New York Rangers. His claim was later confirmed as the result of a manufacturing error.|$|E
5|$|On November 12, 1976, as Fox {{was driving}} to the family home at Morrill Street in Port Coquitlam, he became distracted by nearby bridge construction, and crashed {{into the back of}} a pickup truck. While his car was left undriveable, Fox emerged with only a sore right knee. He again felt pain in December, but chose to ignore it until the end of {{basketball}} season. By March 1977, the pain had intensified and he finally went to a hospital, where he was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a form of cancer that often starts near the knees. Fox believed his car accident weakened <b>his</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> left it vulnerable to the disease, though his doctors argued there was no connection. He was told that his leg had to be amputated, he would require chemotherapy treatment, and that recent medical advances meant he had a 50-percent chance of survival. Fox learned that two years before, the figure would have been only 15 percent; the improvement in survival rates impressed on him the value of cancer research.|$|E
5|$|Promoted to {{temporary}} sergeant on 18 March, Ingram {{fell ill}} in April and was hospitalised in Britain until June {{when he was}} deemed fit {{to return to his}} battalion. He was hospitalised once again in September after dislocating <b>his</b> <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> upon returning to his unit on 10 October he was made company sergeant major. It was at this time that the Australian focus {{for the remainder of the}} year was to be the Ypres sector in Belgium, and as such the 24th Battalion participated in the Battle of Passchendaele. During this time, Ingram was recommended for a commission in the 24th Battalion as a second lieutenant, which was confirmed on 20 June 1918. Three days later, however, he was once again admitted to hospital suffering from an illness, and as such was unable to assume his duties as an officer until 12 July when he returned to the battalion.|$|E
