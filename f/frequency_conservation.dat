40|$|One of the {{objectives}} of evolutionary genomics is to reveal the genetic information contained in the primordial genome (called the primary genetic information in this paper, with the primordial genome defined here as the most primitive nucleic acid genome for earth&#x 2019;s life) by searching for primitive traits or relics remained in modern genomes. As the shorter a sequence is, the less probable it would be modified during genome evolution. For that reason, some characteristics of very short nucleotide sequences would have considerable chances to persist during billions of years of evolution. Consequently, conservation of certain genomic features of mononucleotides, dinucleotides, and higher-order oligonucleotides across various genomes may exist; some, if not all, of these features would be relics of the primary genetic information. Based on this assumption, we analyzed the pattern of frequencies of mononucleotides, dinucleotides, and higher-order oligonucleotides of the whole-genome sequences from 458 species (including archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes). Also, we studied the phenomenon of strand symmetry in these genomes. The {{results show that the}} conservation of frequencies of some dinucleotides and higher-order oligonucleotides across genomes does exist, and that strand symmetry is a ubiquitous and explicit phenomenon that may contribute to <b>frequency</b> <b>conservation.</b> We propose a new hypothesis for the origin of strand symmetry and <b>frequency</b> <b>conservation</b> {{as well as for the}} constitution of early genomes. We conclude that the phenomena of strand symmetry and the pattern of <b>frequency</b> <b>conservation</b> would be original features of the primary genetic information...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a {{neural network system}} that predicts the locations of transmembrane helices in integral membrane proteins. By using evolutionary information as input to the network system, the method significantly improved on a previously published neural network prediction method that had been based on single sequence information. The input data was derived from multiple alignments for each position in a window of 13 adjacent residues: amino acid <b>frequency,</b> <b>conservation</b> weights, number of insertions and deletions, and position of the window {{with respect to the}} ends of the protein chain. Additional input was the amino acid composition and length of the whole protein. A rigorous crossvalidation test on 69 proteins with experimentally determined locations of transmembrane segments yielded an overall two-state per-residue accuracy of 95 %. About 94 % of all segments were predicted correctly. When applied to known globular proteins as a negative control, the network system incorrectly predicted fewer than 5 % of globular proteins as having transmembrane helices. The method was applied to all 269 open reading frames from the complete yeast VIII chromosome. For 59 of these at least two transmembrane helices were predicted. Thus, the prediction is that about one fourth of all proteins from yeast VIII contain one transmembrane helix, and some 20 % more than one...|$|E

To determine the base <b>frequency</b> <b>conservation</b> required for Fis to locate its binding sites, we collected a set of 60 experimentally defined wild-type Fis DNA binding sequences.

A novel TaqI fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (fAFLP) approach to M. tuberculosis DNA fingerprinting that targeted the variable IS 6110 marker was developed in this study. The new method was tested for specificity and reproducibility, and compared with the standard reference IS 6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method for a panel of 78 isolates. Clustering conflicts between the two methods were resolved using mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit–variable number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) data. Comparison with an in-silico digestion of strain H 37 Rv showed that fAFLP-detected fragments were highly specific in vitro. The reproducibility of repeated digestions of strain H 37 Rv was 100 %. Clustering results obtained by fAFLP and RFLP were highly congruent, with fAFLP allocating 97 % of RFLP-clustered isolates to the same eight clusters as RFLP. Two single-copy isolates that had been clustered by RFLP were not clustered by fAFLP, but the MIRU-VNTR patterns of these isolates were different, indicating that the RFLP data had falsely clustered these isolates.

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to improve}} tone consistency {{and to reduce}} calibration frequency for color Electrophotography (EP). EP processes are sensitive to changes in operating conditions. Calibrations are performed to stabilize primary color reproduction. During a calibration, regression models are used to predict the primary color tone values on output media. A principal component regression (PCR) approach is employed for the model coefficient estimation. It is shown that the PCR models can effectively reduce the prediction error by 24. 7 % compared to existing models. With given the PCR models, a model-based calibration procedure is proposed to stabilize the EP processes. Experimental {{results show that the}} proposed model-based calibration procedure provides a 63. 3 % reduction in tone error over the existing approach. In addition, transient tone fluctuation is investigated. A first-order dynamic model is proposed to characterize the transient tone fluctuation that lasts for less than eleven pages in the beginning of print jobs. The proposed model can accurately predict transient tone fluctuation over pages based on cross-validation and can be used to identify the necessary adjustments to compensate the tone fluctuation. With all the above efforts aiming at improving color consistency, potential in calibration <b>frequency</b> <b>conservation</b> is also investigated. A decision-tree-based approach is proposed to determinate appropriate timing for performing calibration as a trade-off between color consistency and consumable economy. Simulation with historic data shows that the proposed method can effectively reduce calibration frequency by 48. 4 % while the color consistency is guaranteed. ...|$|E

A {{study was}} {{conducted}} in 2004 in Burkina Faso in order to analyze the determinants of households' fish demand in both rural (Vallée du Kou) and urban (Bobo-Dioulasso and Ouagadougou) areas. To achieve this objective, 535 households were surveyed, the data collected were analyzed and a double-log regression function was constructed. The results of this study showed that households' fish consumption varied considerably according to the area (rural or urban). Households' fish demand was influenced by the availability of the product in the market. In addition to that, when the fish supply frequency increased, the duration of the conservation of the product was reduced or was annulled. The study revealed that the determinants of fish demand in rural area in Vallée du Kou included the size of the household, the prize of the fish in the market, the level of education and the revenue of the head of the household. In urban areas, these determinants include mainly the revenue of the head of the household, fish supply <b>frequency,</b> and <b>conservation</b> methods of the product...|$|R

The {{simulation}} of three-wave interaction based plasma emission, {{thought to be}} the underlying mechanism for Type III solar radio bursts, is a challenging task requiring fully-kinetic, multi-dimensional models. This paper aims to resolve a contradiction in past attempts, whereby some studies indicate that no such processes occur. Methods. We self-consistently simulate three-waved based plasma emission through all stages by using 2 D, fully kinetic, electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulations of relaxing electron beams using the EPOCH 2 D code. Results. Here we present the results of two simulations; Run 1 (nb/n 0 = 0. 0057, vb/Δvb = vb/Ve = 16) and Run 2 (nb/n 0 = 0. 05, vb/Δvb = vb/Ve = 8), which we find to permit and prohibit plasma emission respectively. We show that the possibility of plasma emission is contingent upon the frequency of the initial electrostatic waves generated by the bump-in-tail instability, and that these waves may be prohibited from participating in the necessary three-wave interactions due to <b>frequency</b> <b>conservation</b> requirements. In resolving this apparent contradiction through a comprehensive analysis, in this paper we present the first self-consistent demonstration of fundamental and harmonic plasma emission from a single-beam system via fully kinetic numerical simulation. We caution against simulating astrophysical radio bursts using unrealistically dense beams (a common approach which reduces run time), as the resulting non-Langmiur characteristics of the initial wave modes significantly suppresses emission.

40|$|During {{the long}} history of {{biological}} evolution, genome structures have undergone enormous changes. Nevertheless, some traits or vestiges of the primordial genome (defined as the most primitive nucleic acid genome for life on earth in this paper) may remain in modern genetic systems. It is of great importance to find these traits or vestiges {{for the study of the}} origin and evolution of genomes. As the shorter is a sequence, the less probable it would be modified during genome evolution. And if mutated, it would be easier to reappear at the same site or another site. Consequently, the genomic frequencies of very short nucleotide sequences, such as dinucleotides, would have considerable chances to be conserved during billions of years of evolution. Prokaryotic genomes are very diverse and with a wide range of GC content. Therefore, in order to find traits or vestiges of the primordial genome remained in modern genetic systems, we have studied the characteristics of dinucleotide frequencies across bacterial and archaeal genomes. We analyzed the dinucleotide frequency patterns of the whole-genome sequences from more than 1300 prokaryotic species (bacterial and archaeal genomes available as of December 2012). The results show that the frequencies of the dinucleotides AC, AG, CA, CT, GA, GT, TC, and TG are well conserved across various genomes, while the frequencies of other dinucleotides vary considerably among species. The dinucleotide frequency conservation/variation pattern seems to correlate with the distributions of dinucleotides throughout a genome and across genomes. Further analysis indicates that the phenomenon would be determined by strand symmetry of genomic sequences (the second parity rule) and GC content variations among genomes. We discussed some possible origins of strand symmetry. And we propose that the phenomenon of <b>frequency</b> <b>conservation</b> of some dinucleotides may provide insights into the genomic composition of the primordial genetic system...|$|E
40|$|With {{increasing}} <b>frequency,</b> <b>conservation</b> biologists are documenting {{declines in}} native species over time. We found evidence for 18 % native species loss over 50 years in forest herb communities in northern Wisconsin, relying on baseline {{data collected by}} John Curtis and the Plant Ecology Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin during the 1940 s and 50 s. The relationship between these losses and patterns of community structure is unknown. We explore changes in community structure by examining co-occurrence patterns. We ask 3 questions: (1) is there evidence for non-random co-occurrence patterns of forest herbs? (2) do co-occurrence patterns shift through time? and (3) are shifts in co-occurrence patterns correlated with species loss? We assembled presence-absence matrices for each of 59 sites for both time periods (n = 118 matrices). Species were listed in rows, and quadrats in columns. The number of species in a matrix varied across sites, but included exactly 20 quadrats in all cases. For each matrix, we recorded the observed C-score {{and the number of}} checkerboard species pairs (NCSP), based on co-occurrence patterns in individual quadrats. To calculate a null distribution for C-scores and NCSPs, we created 5000 random matrices for each matrix, and calculated a standard effect size for observed C-scores and NCSPs. Species tend to co-occur more than would be expected due to chance alone, supporting our first hypothesis. Standard effect sizes for C-scores are significantly less than zero in both time periods (95 % CI = − 1. 89 to − 0. 93 in 1950; − 1. 73 to − 0. 87 in 2000). The same is true for the NCSPs (95 % CI = − 1. 68 to − 0. 66 in 1950; − 1. 51 to − 0. 69 in 2000). We find no evidence supporting our second and third hypotheses.

I begin with Fisher’s fundamental theorem of natural selection. That theorem partitions the total evolutionary change of a population into two components. The first component is the partial change caused by the direct force of natural selection, holding constant {{all aspects of the}} environment. The second component is the partial change caused by the changing environment. I demonstrate that Fisher’s partition of total change into the direct force of selection and the forces from the changing environmental frame of reference is identical to d’Alembert’s principle of mechanics, which separates the work done by the direct forces from the work done by the inertial forces associated with the changing frame of reference. In d’Alembert’s principle, there exist inertial forces from a change in the frame of reference that exactly balance the direct forces. I show that the conservation of total probability strongly shapes the form of the balance between the direct and inertial forces. I then use the strong results for conserved probability to obtain general results for the change in any system quantity, such as biological fitness or energy. Those general results derive from simple coordinate changes between frequencies and system quantities. Ultimately, d’Alembert’s separation of direct and inertial forces provides deep conceptual insight into the interpretation of forces and the unification of disparate fields of study...|$|R

Since then, at the national level, there has not been any work on this scale relating to flora distribution, despite the obvious need for a better understanding. In 2011, in response to this need, the Federation des Conservatoires Botaniques Nationaux 2 (FCBN, [URL] launched an ambitious collaborative project involving eleven national botanical conservatories of France. The project aims to establish a formal procedure and standardized system for data hosting, aggregation and publication for four areas: flora, fungi, vegetation and habitats. In 2014, {{the first phase of the}} project led to the development of the national flora dataset: SIFlore. As it includes about 21 million records of flora occurrences, this is currently the most comprehensive dataset on the distribution of vascular plants (Tracheophyta) in the French territory. SIFlore contains information for about 15 ' 454 plant taxa occurrences (indigenous and alien taxa) in metropolitan France and Reunion Island, from 1545 until 2014. The data records were originally collated from inventories, checklists, literature and herbarium records. SIFlore was developed by assembling flora datasets from the regional to the national level. At the regional level, source records are managed by the national botanical conservatories that are responsible for flora data collection and validation. In order to present our results, a geoportal was developed by the Fédération des conservatoires botaniques nationaux that allows the SIFlore dataset to be publically viewed. This portal is available at: [URL] As the FCBN belongs to the Information System for Nature and Landscapes' (SINP), a governmental program, the dataset is also accessible through the websites of the National Inventory of Natural Heritage ([URL] and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility ([URL] SIFlore is regularly updated with additional data records.

Purpose: SIFlore aims to make the data of the flora of France available at the national level for conservation, policy management and scientific research. Such a dataset will provide enough information to allow for macro-ecological reviews of species distribution patterns and, coupled with climatic or topographic datasets, the identification of determinants of these patterns.

Since frequent herbicide sampling can be rigorous and expensive, it is desirable to determine expected uncertainties associated with reduced sampling frequencies. Atrazine, simazine, alachlor, acetochlor, metolachlor, and glyphosate were monitored in tile-fed drainage ditches. Water samples were collected dur-ing the 2004 to 2007 cropping seasons at eight monitoring sites located at the outlets of sub basins {{ranging in size from}} 298 to 19, 341 ha (736 to 47, 793 ac). Herbicide data were analyzed based upon daily sampling, then for 7 possible weekly sampling scenarios, and 14 possible biweekly sampling scenarios. In addition, the value {{of sampling}} more intensively during runoff events was evaluated. Statistical analyses indicate the need for management practices to reduce atrazine and metolachlor loading to drainage water can best be assessed in these drainage networks using daily sampling in conjunction with a more intensive sampling regime during storm events, while sampling frequency had little impact on observed levels of other herbicides. This indicates that biweekly sampling may be sufficient for monitoring of some herbicides, allowing for reduced analytical costs...|$|R

Control Group (C) Ss were given neither of these experimental manipulations. The results were as follows : 1) Ss who observed the event after in congruity was aroused (as in DI) could recognize the event more accurately and could more readily generalize the principles of conservation. 2) If Ss were strongly committed to a certain belief (as in D), they often conceptualized ambiguous results in a biased manner, making them consistent with the belief. As to generality of learning, however, performance of D Ss {{did not differ significantly}} from that of C Ss. This result was an unexpected one. Its interpretation was that there was low incongruity in D, because proponents of conservation were highly predominant at the discussion. In order to verify the interpretation mentioned above, the 2 nd experiment was undertaken. Eighty-seven 4 th-graders observed and confirmed by a scale conservation of weight under dissolurion of sugar into water. One school class was assigned to C. Two groups of 22 pupils, of whom 2 / 3 were non-conservers, were selected from 2 other classes and served as D. They were expected to experience high incongruity during the discussion. The results showed that, compared with C, improvement of performance was greater among D. They could state adequate explanations of conservation of weight, generalize more readily the principles of conservation, and resist extinc tion (the observation of an apparently non-conserving event). Furthermore, Ss of D reported high epistemic curiosity...|$|R
40|$|Labeo spp. are large, herbivorous fishes {{that are}} {{important}} components of aquatic ecosystems and are a high conservation priority in South Africa. This thesis contributes to determination of conservation priorities for Labeo umbratus (Smith 1841) by resolving the taxonomic status of this species in the evolutionary context of southern African Labeo spp., assessing the presence of unique lineages in historically isolated river basins, and assessing the threat of intra- and interspecific hybridisation associated with introductions. Phylogenetic analyses of five DNA sequence data sets (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene [COI], cytochrome b gene [Cyt b], Recombination activating gene 1 [Rag 1], COI+Rag 1 and COI+Cyt b+Rag 1) showed that the Labeo umbratus group (sensu Reid, 1985), which comprises the species Labeo umbratus, Labeo capensis (Smith 1841), Labeo seeberi Gilchrist and Thompson 1911 and Labeo rubromaculatus Gilchrist and Thompson 1913, is monophyletic, morphologically distinct and geographically disjunct from other African Labeo spp. groups except in the Tugela River system were L. rubromaculatus co-occurs with Labeo molybdinus Du Plessis 1963. Phylogeographic analysis of mitochondrial DNA (Cyt b) sequence data demonstrated that the populations of the L. umbratus from the Orange and the southward-flowing river systems are reciprocally monophyletic and were identified as evolutionary significant units. The populations in the southward-flowing river systems were further divided into southwestern (Gourits and Gamtoos) and southeastern (Sundays, Bushmans, Great Fish, Keiskamma, Buffalo and Nahoon) polyp hyletic sublineages. Four management units (Gourits Basin; Gamtoos Basin; Sundays+Bushmans+Great Fish River Basins; and Keiskamma+Buffalo+Nahoon River Basin) were not reciprocally monophyletic but were proposed {{on the basis of}} containing unique haplotype <b>frequencies</b> for <b>conservation</b> purposes. To evaluate the threat of hybridisation to the genetic integrity of L. umbratus, the occurrence of Labeo umbratus x L. capensis hybrids was investigated using mtDNA Cyt b and nDNA S 7 intron sequence data and morphological data. Genetic evidence for interspecific hybridisation was detected for populations in two impoundments, Hardap Dam (Orange River Basin) and Darlington Dam (Sundays River Basin, Eastern Cape, South Africa). Some putative hybrids were identifiable morphologically on account of intermediacy between the parental species in meristic and morphometric characters. Translocation via direct stocking (Hardap Dam) or via an inter-basin water transfer scheme (Darlington Dam) was identified as a driver for hybridisation. Introductions associated with an inter-basin water transfer scheme has resulted in introgression between the previously isolated Orange River and southern lineages of L. umbratus. Further translocation of fish from these affected areas to non-contaminated river systems and impoundments such as Kat River (Great Fish River) and Slagboom (Sundays River) should be avoided...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{enormous}} throughput and {{low cost}} of second-generation sequencing platforms now allow research and clinical geneticists to routinely perform single experiments that identify {{tens of thousands}} to millions of variant sites. Existing methods to annotate variant sites using information from publicly available databases via web browsers are too slow to be useful for the large sequencing datasets being routinely generated by geneticists. Because sequence annotation of variant sites is required before functional characterization can proceed, {{the lack of a}} high-throughput pipeline to efficiently annotate variant sites can act as a significant bottleneck in genetics research. Results SeqAnt (Seq uence An notator) is an open source web service and software package that rapidly annotates DNA sequence variants and identifies recessive or compound heterozygous loci in human, mouse, fly, and worm genome sequencing experiments. Variants are characterized with respect to their functional type, <b>frequency,</b> and evolutionary <b>conservation.</b> Annotated variants can be viewed on a web browser, downloaded in a tab-delimited text file, or directly uploaded in a BED format to the UCSC genome browser. To demonstrate the speed of SeqAnt, we annotated a series of publicly available datasets that ranged in size from 37 to 3, 439, 107 variant sites. The total time to completely annotate these data completely ranged from 0. 17 seconds to 28 minutes 49. 8 seconds. Conclusion SeqAnt is an open source web service and software package that overcomes a critical bottleneck facing research and clinical geneticists using second-generation sequencing platforms. SeqAnt will prove especially useful for those investigators who lack dedicated bioinformatics personnel or infrastructure in their laboratories. </p...|$|R
40|$|Much of our {{understanding}} of the response of savanna systems to fire disturbance relies on observations derived from manipulative fire plot studies. Equivocal findings from both recent Australian and African savanna fire plot assessments have significant implications for informing conservation management and reliable estimation of biomass stocks and dynamics. Influential northern Australian replicated fire plot studies include the 24 -year plot-scale Munmarlary and the five-year catchment-scale Kapalga, mesic savanna (> 1000 mm/yr of rainfall) experiments in present-day Kakadu National Park. At Munmarlary, under low-to-moderate-intensity fire treatments, woody vegetation dominated by mature eucalypts was found to be structurally stable. At Kapalga, substantial declines in woody biomass were observed under more intense fire treatments, and modeling assessments implicate early-season fires as having adverse effects on longer-term tree recruitment. Given these contrasting perspectives, here we take advantage of a landscape-scale fire response monitoring program established on three major northern Australian conservation reserves (Kakadu, Litchfield, and Nitmiluk National Parks). Using statistical modeling we assess the decadal effects of ambient fire regime parameters (fire frequency, severity, seasonality, time since fire) on 32 vegetation structure components and abundance of 21 tree and 16 grass species from 122 monitoring plots. Over the study period the mean annual frequency of burning of plots was 0. 53, comprising mostly early-dry-season, low-severity fires. Structural and species responses were variable but often substantial, notably resulting in stem recruitment and declines in juveniles, but only weakly explained by fire regime and habitat variables. Modeling of these observations under three realistic scenarios (increased fire severity under projected worsening climate change; modest and significant reductions in fire <b>frequency</b> to meet <b>conservation</b> criteria) indicates that all scenarios have positive and negative structural implications. Effecting significant regional fire regime change (e. g., reduction in frequency and size of severe fires) is demonstrably feasible, but it incurs risks and potentially some undesirable structural consequences. Given recent Australian and African experience, the generality and application of landscape-scale implications derived from manipulative fire assessments (including variable grazing and browsing regimes) in savanna require more critical assessment...|$|R
40|$|Superinertial {{internal}} waves {{generated by}} a tropical cyclone can propagate vertically and laterally away from their local generation site and break, contributing to turbulent vertical mixing in the deep ocean and maintenance of the stratification of the main thermocline. In this paper, {{the results of a}} modeling study are reported to investigate the mechanism by which superinertial fluctuations are generated in the deep ocean. The general properties of the superinertial wave wake were also characterized as a function of storm speed and central latitude. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Ocean General Circulation Model (OGCM) was used to simulate the open ocean response to realistic westward-tracking hurricane-type surface wind stress and heat and net freshwater buoyancy forcing for regions representative of midlatitudes in the Atlantic, the Caribbean, and low latitudes in the eastern Pacific. The model had high horizontal [Δ(x, y) = 1 / 6 °] and vertical (Δz = 5 m in top 100 m) resolution and employed a parameterization for vertical mixing induced by shear instability. In the horizontal momentum equation, the relative size of the nonlinear advection terms, which had a dominant frequency near twice the inertial, was large only in the upper 200 m of water. Below 200 m, the linear momentum equations obeyed a linear balance to 2 %. Fluctuations at nearly twice the inertial frequency (2 f) were prevalent throughout the depth of the water column, indicating that these nonlinear advection terms in the upper 200 m forced a linear mode below at nearly twice the inertial <b>frequency</b> via vorticity <b>conservation.</b> Maximum variance at 2 f in horizontal velocity occurred {{on the south side of}} the track. This was in response to vertical advection of northward momentum, which in the north momentum equation is an oscillatory positive definite term that constituted a net force to the south at a frequency near 2 f. The ratio of this term to the Coriolis force was larger on the south side of the storm than the north side. The effect was to shift the center of near-inertial circles of particle paths to the south side of the track. Slow storms had more symmetrical wakes for horizontal velocity in the cross-track direction than fast storms, and they generated the strongest vertical velocities. Maximum depth-integrated kinetic energy and vertical velocities were larger for the low-latitude environments (in the Pacific and Caribbean) than at higher latitudes in the Atlantic, because the storm speed for forcing at resonance decreases with latitude. Slower storms exhibited stronger nonlinear superinertial vertical velocities than fast storms and a larger shift of the maximum in vertical velocity at depth to the south side of the storm track. The results suggest that slow storms at low latitudes produce the largest response for kinetic energy and vertical velocity, whereas slow storms at high latitudes produce the largest variance in the vertical velocity at superinertial frequencies. Overall, the findings present a new interpretation of the generation mechanism for fluctuations at 2 f and higher harmonics in the velocity field. © 2009 American Meteorological Society...|$|R
40|$|Statement of the Problem Rapid {{population}} {{and economic growth}} combined with depleting groundwater reserves are resulting in ever increasing demands on surface water resources in Texas, as well as elsewhere. The climate {{of the state is}} characterized by extremes of floods and droughts. Reservoirs are necessary to control and utilize the highly variable streamflow. Due to a number of economic, environmental, institutional, and political considerations, construction of new reservoir projects is much more difficult now than in the past. Consequently, optimizing the beneficial use of existing reservoirs is becoming increasingly more important. Reservoir operation is based on the conflicting objectives of maximizing the amount of water available for conservation purposes and maximizing the amount of empty space available for storing future flood waters to reduce downstream damages. Common practice is to operate a reservoir for either flood control only, conservation only, or a combination of flood control and conservation with separate pools designated for each. The conservation and flood control pools, or vertical zones, in a multipurpose project are fixed by a designated top of conservation (bottom of flood control) pool elevation. Conservation pools may be shared by various purposes, such as water supply, hydroelectric power, and recreation, which involve both complementary and conflicting interactions. Public needs and objectives and numerous factors affecting reservoir operation change over time. An increasing necessity to use limited storage capacity as effectively as possible warrants periodic re-evaluations of operating policies. Reallocation of storage capacity between purposes represents a general strategy for optimizing the beneficial use of limited storage capacity in response to changing needs and conditions. A storage reallocation between flood control and conservation purposes typically involves a permanent or seasonal change in the designated top of conservation pool elevation. Reallocations between conservation purposes can be achieved by various modifications of operating policies. Although given relatively little consideration in the past, storage reallocations will likely be proposed more frequently as demands on limited resources increase. Scope of Study This report documents an investigation of: (1) the potential of storage capacity reallocation and other related modifications in operating policies as management strategies for optimizing the beneficial use of existing reservoirs in Texas and (2) modeling capabilities for formulating and evaluating such changes to operating policies. In general, storage reallocations can involve a variety of types of reservoir use. The present study focused primarily on flood control and water supply. Multiple purpose reservoir operations involving hydroelectric power were also investigated. Both permanent conversion of storage capacity between purposes and seasonal rule curve operations were addressed. Buffer pool operations were also considered. Multiple reservoir system operation was a major emphasis of the study. The literature was reviewed and several reservoir management agencies contacted to (1) identify experiences in studying and/or implementing storage reallocations and (2) evaluate the state-of-the-art of associated modeling and analysis capabilities. The feasibility of seasonal rule curve operation depends upon the seasonal characteristics of the various factors affecting reservoir operation. Precipitation, streamflow, reservoir evaporation, water demands, and reservoir storage content data for Texas were analyzed to identify seasonal characteristics. A 12 -reservoir system operated by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers and Brazos River Authority provided a case study for evaluating the potential for storage reallocations and related operating strategies. This system, located in the Brazos River Basin, is considered representative of major reservoirs in Texas. The existing operating policies and possible modifications were investigated. The case study includes (1) flood control storage <b>frequency</b> and <b>conservation</b> drawdown <b>frequency</b> analyses {{based on the results of}} monthly hydrologic period-of-record simulations of reservoir system operations and (2) firm yield and reliability analyses. The generalized computer programs HEC- 3, HEC- 5, STATS, and MOSS-IV, and several utility software packages were used in the modeling study. Simulation of reservoir system operations was based on an 85 -year sequence of monthly hydrologic data. The case study provides a preliminary assessment of the viability of permanent storage conversions and/or adoption of seasonal rule curve operations as potential reservoir management strategies. The objective is to evaluate storage reallocation potentialities in general, not develop detailed reallocation plans. The case study is basically a reconnaissance-level hydrologic analysis of reservoir operations. The monthly period-of-record simulations provide a reasonably precise analysis of water supply considerations. However, the daily hydrologic data required for detailed analysis of flood control operations were not included in the study. Reallocation of reservoir storage capacity involves complex institutional, financial, economic, legal, political, and technical considerations not addressed in the case study. However, the hydrologic analyses provide a good starting point for determining what types of reallocation strategies and modeling approaches might be potentially effective and whether more detailed studies are worthwhile. Organization of the Report Chapter 2 is a general discussion of reservoir operation and institutional and technical aspects of storage reallocation and a review of reallocations which have been implemented or proposed throughout the nation. Chapter 3 addresses the seasonality of the hydrologic factors pertinent to seasonal rule curve operation in Texas. Chapter 4 reviews state-of-the-art modeling capabilities and describes the computer models adopted for use in the case study. The Brazos River Basin case study is presented in chapters 5 through 8. Study results are summarized, and conclusions are presented in chapter 9...|$|R
40|$|Auditory {{detection}} and localization {{is important for}} animals and humans and crucial for barn owls. In natural environments, the spatial separation of signal and interfering noise improves detectability of the signal. In psychoacoustics experiments this is achieved by changing the spatial attributes of the sound, for example by shifting the phase of the tone or the noise in one ear. The improvement resulting from this shift was called “Binaural Masking Level Difference“ (BMLD). I recorded the activity of neurons in the central and external nuclei of the inferior colliculus (ICC and ICX, respectively) of the barn owl. These neurons are sensitive to {{a variation of the}} interaural delay. I tested three masking configurations: 1) the noise N and the tone S were set at the best interaural delays (BD), resulting in the NBDSBD configuration; 2) the noise was set at the best interaural delay but the tone was set at the best interaural delay with 180 ° phase shift, or the worst interaural delay (WD), resulting in the NBDSWD configuration, 3) the noise was set at the best interaural delay with 180 ° phase shift and the tone was set at the best delay (NWDSBD configuration). The noise level was held constant while the tone level was varied. The detection threshold was determined using the index of discrimination according to signal detection theory. BMLD is restricted to <b>frequencies</b> that allows <b>conservation</b> of time by phase locking (< 3 kHz in mammals). In the owl phase locking is observed up to 9 kHz. Therefore, I expected BMLDs at higher frequencies than 3 kHz. In {{the first part of the}} study, I show exactly this. Due to distinct neural stations in the owl inferior colliculus, it was possible to address the hierarchy of {{detection and}} localization at the neuronal level. The ICC neurons are narrowly tuned to frequency and had lower detection thresholds than the ICX neurons. Since ICC neurons responded maximally to more than one ITD in their ITD function, they could not signal a specific position in the space. Integration of many frequency channels from ICC neurons enables the ICX neurons to represent a specific position in space. I propose that there is a division of labor between ICC and ICX: detection happens at the level of the ICC, while correlates of localization are available at the level of ICX. This is consistent with psychophysical studies. In psychophysics, the inversion of tone or noise results in unmasking. I studied both unmasking scenarios. I measured responses of IC neurons to masking scenarios with a phase shift in tone and analyzed the firing rate of neurons to the masking stimuli, while in another experiment I shifted the phase of the noise. Inversion of tone resulted in a mean improvement of about 12 dB in detection threshold in ICC neurons. Inversion of noise led to 10 dB BMLD in these neurons. The BMLDs in ICX neurons were larger than those in ICC neurons. The results from the ICC neurons are comparable to psychophysical observations in humans. I also tested the effects of the noise level on BMLDs produced by tone or noise inversion. An increase in the noise level resulted in an increase in the magnitude of the BMLD. This result is again comparable to psychophysical observations in humans. The contribution of tone and noise in driving the neurons differs at different signal to noise ratios and is different at different masking configurations. At low tone levels the neurons were driven only by the noise while at high tone levels neurons were driven mainly by the tone, indicating occlusion. The contribution of the noise in driving the neurons was larger at higher noise levels. In the NBDSBD configuration the masking is the result of an excitatory interaction between noise and tone, while in NBDSWD and NWDSBD the interaction is inhibitory. During the analysis I observed changes in spike pattern (especially spike latency) by changing the tone level in masking stimuli. According to the information theory, I found that response onset transmits more information than the spike count...|$|R
40|$|Se estudió una sucesión sedimentaria que aflora en el sudeste de la Cuenca Neuquina, en el departamento El Cuy (Río Negro). La misma incluye a las formaciones Huincul y Lisandro que integran el Subgrupo Río Limay (Grupo Neuquén), y han sido asignadas al Cenomaniano- Turoniano. Se identificaron once litofacies de origen fluvial, tres litofacies de naturaleza eólica y dos litofacies volcaniclásticas. A partir de los agrupamientos en unidades genéticamente relacionadas se definieron siete elementos fluviales de intracanal, cuatro de planicie de inundación y cuatro eólicos. La distribución espacial y relaciones entre los elementos arquitecturales ha permitido reconocer sistemas fluviales agradantes de alta sinuosidad (SF-I y II), un sistema de abanico {{terminal}} (SAT) y campos de médanos barjanoides (SE). El análisis estratigráfico-secuencial permitió definir cinco Secuencias a partir de las relaciones espaciales y temporales de los elementos arquitecturales mayores y de la determinación de superficies estratigráficamente significativas. La base de la Formación Huincul está representada por el SF-I, caracterizado por un sistema de alta sinuosidad, con baja relación canales/planicie de inundación y abundantes depósitos de desbordes. Este tramo de la secuencia se interpreta como el Cortejo de Alta Acomodación (AA) de la Secuencia I (S-I). El sector cuspidal de la unidad está integrado por un sistema similar pero con una alta relación canal/planicie de inundación y constituye el Cortejo de Baja Acomodación (BA) de la Secuencia II (S-II). Se propone que la depositación de la Formación Huincul tuvo lugar bajo condiciones climáticas cálidas con un régimen de estacionalidad marcado. La Formación Lisandro se inicia con depósitos de un sistema distributario proximal de abanico terminal (SAT) que representan el Cortejo AA de S-II. De aquí en adelante es notoria la recurrencia de SE, caracterizando los Cortejos BA y una sucesión desde cuenca de inundación a distributarios proximales de SAT, integrando los Cortejos AA de las secuencias S-II, III, IV y V. La unidad se depositó bajo condiciones climáticas semiáridas permanentes. Las unidades estratigráficas estudiadas se consideran de carácter sinorogénico, con un control tectónico significativo en la definición del espacio de acomodación y un volcanismo principalmente activo durante la sedimentación de la Formación Huincul. La Formación Lisandro corresponde a un período de abrupto incremento en la tasa de subsidencia en la Cuenca Neuquina. In the Cuy Department, Rio Negro Province (Fig. 1), {{there are}} outcrops of the Late Cretaceous continental deposits of the Subgroup Rio Limay (Fig. 2), in virtually continuous exposures that allow detail studies and {{exploration of the}} architecture of the sedimentary bodies. This contribution presents the results of the sedimentological study and sequential stratigraphic analysis for the depositional period of the Huincul and Lisandro formations (Subgroup Río Limay). The outcrops appear in the Planicie de Rentaría (Area A), with continuous sections longer than 3 km and Anfiteatro (Area B) with outcrops of more than 5 km (Fig. 1). In these areas we made detailed sedimentological profiles (Fig. 3), we described and interpreted lithofacies and architectural elements employing photograms and we defined stratigraphicaly significant discontinuities. We identified 11 fluvial lithofacies, 4 conglomerates (Gm, Gh, Gp and Gt), 5 sandstones (Sm, St., Sp, and Mr. Sh), and 2 pelitic (Fl and Fm), according to the nomenclature of Miall (1996). In addition, 2 volcaniclastic lithofacies, 1 primary pyroclastic lithofacies (Tlpm) and 1 volcaniclastic sineruptive lithofacies (TLpe) following criteria Mc Phie et al. (1993) were defined, and finally 3 eolic lithofacies (Spe, She and Sathya) (Fig. 4). These were grouped into 11 fluvial architectural elements and 4 eolic (Fig. 5). We have recognized channel elements (CHI) and CHII), intrachannel (LA, DAI, DAII, SBI and SBII) and floodplain (CRI, CRII, CS and OF). The eolic architectural elements include dunes (ED) and interdunes (DI, and WI FI). The paleoenvironments sedimentary include river systems, terminal fans and dune fields. The Sistema Fluvial I (SF-I) is integrated by LA, DAI, DAII, SBI, CHI, CRI, CRII and OF (Fig. 6). The meanders loops show, in most cases, complete filling sequences in which records of migration of large sand dunes are preserved which retain topsets deposits and the scrolls their undulating tops. The channel belts are separated by potent floodplain deposits, with frequent intercalation of levels of overflow both channelized or in mantle, and show a multilateral persistence in potent sections of the column. The crevasse splay exhibits paleosoils with low levels of development, frequent presence of gleyzed horizons and high degree of bioturbation. The general characteristics of the S-FI are proper of aggrading fluvial systems of high sinuosity. The Sistema Fluvial II (SF-II) is characterized by LA, DAI, DAII, SBI and to a lesser proportion, by CRI and OF (Fig. 6). The meanders loops often show preservation of the channel fill by lateral accretion with complete successions. Also the dunes preserve topsets deposits and the scrolls the original topography (Fig. 7). The <b>frequency</b> of <b>conservation</b> of filling phase of the abandoned channel with strong bioturbation and development gleyzed horizons suggests frequent avulsion by strangulation. The preservation of the floodplain is low, and it is characterized by intense bioturbation, and a high volcaniclastic participation in some reaches. We consider that the fluvial system model is of high sinuosity highly aggrading. The terminal fan system (Sistema Abanico Terminal) (TSS), characteristic of semiarid regions with strong seasonal climatology, is represented by CHII, CS or SBII and OF (Fig. 6). These constitute flooding basin deposits (CI), simple multiepisodic channel fillings corresponding to middle sections of the distributary plain and simple channels with development of small transversal cross bars and multilateral relations of distal distributary plain. The aeolian system (Sistema Eolico) (IS) consists of SD, DI, WD and FD. The spatial distribution of dunes and interdunes, the high dispersion of paleocurrents with a principal mode at the avalanche deposits and multiple stabilization surfaces suggest the development of a field of barchan dunes. In the element WI, we identified ferric and mottled halos and bioturbations that indicate the presence of paleosoils with gleyzed horizons (Retallack, 1976, 1990) which and characterize environments with good oxygenation. According to the temporal and spatial arrangement of the different paleoenvironments, their evolutionary trend and the analysis of significant discontinuity surfaces, we produced the stratigraphic sequence for the Subgroup Rio Limay (Fig. 8). The sequence starts with the Secuencia I, corresponding {{to the base of the}} Huincul Fm and is represented by SF-I, defined by belts of potent channels, isolated in floodplain deposits and with the development of overflow fans under conditions of rapid aggradation. The avulsion by overflow crevasse splay was the control mechanism of the system. The development of composite paleosoils in distal segments of the plain indicates the existence of long periods during which the channel band remained relatively stable poitions. The incorporation of volcaniclastic materials to fluvial deposits claims a volcanic activity close in time. The geometry and continuity of the sandy bodies and its proportion in relation to the floodplain deposits suggests periods of low frequency of avulsion/subsidence rate. The large-scale architecture observed is the equivalent to a High Accommodation System Track (Cortejo) (AA) with a ratio A/S close to 1 associated with a gradual decline in the base level under conditions of high sediment supply. A net surface (Discontinuidad D-IS-IS) is the basis of the sequence II, marked by an abrupt change in the fluvial architecture river (SF-II). The mechanism of lateral migration was by strangulation and abrupt cut of the bends. Only underdeveloped paleosoils in the abandoned channel fillings and the little preservation of the floodplain deposits are recognized. The stacking of channel belts signs out a reduction in the accommodation space. The top layer of Huincul Fm is interpreted as Lower Accommodation System Track (Cortejo) (BA). The Discontinuity IIC (D-IIC) marks the base of Lisandro Fm, which is an surface of fluvial flooding defining the expansion of a terminal fan system associated with an abrupt increase in the accommodation space and rapid progradation of the facies of an environment of intermediate distributary plain. This stretch of the Sequence is interpreted as the High Accommodation System Track (Cortejo) (AA) of the Sequence II (S-II) was associated with a period of high subsidence. The deposits of terminal fans are covered by a wet eolian system (IS). The change in the depositional environment marks the beginning of the Sequence III (SIII), limited at the base by D-IIIS. The development of a field of parabolic dunes associated with environments dry, wet and flooded interdune indicates a gradual rise in the water table that, eventually, was above the depositional surface generating shallow lagoons. The shortterm climatic changes related with an increase in precipitation and the relative position of the water table controlled the development stabilization surfaces and the growth and migration of aeolian forms. We identified two supersurfaces (D-IV and DV, Fig. 18) which may be assigned to periods with an increase in the supply or availability of sediment climatically conditioned. Periodically, the interdune corridors were overrun by ephemeral streams associated with the flood basin environments of SAT during flooding events. All deposits, characterized by a strong stacking of the eolian successions are interpreted as the Cortejo BA from the Sequence III. A new fluvial flood event marked by the Discontinuity VIC, is represented by facies flood basin, a distributary plain with the development of intertwined channels showing evidences of the SAT progradation. This sector is interpreted as the (Cortejo) AA System Track of S-III associated with a period of renewed subsidence. D-VIIS limits the base of the S-IV whose (Cortejo) BA System Track is similar to the previous Sequence and includes 3 supersurfaces (D-D-VIIIIX / X). The expansion of the flooding basin facies of a limited terminal fan at the base by D-XIC represents the base of the (Cortejo) AA System Track of the Sequence IV. Tabular units associated with a distal distributary plain that replaced towards the top by thick channels of low sinuosity close to the backbone of the system represent an progradation event of the SAT. The beginning of the Sequence V is marked D-XIIS associated with the development of a new SE. The architectural design of large scale is similar to that of the (Cortejos) BA System Tracks of the Sequences III and IV and includes supersurfaces D-D-XIII and XIV. Something similar occurs with the surface of fluvial flooding (D-XVC) on which we identified a prograding succession of SAT. The characteristics of the systems involved in the Lisandro Fm suggest a climate change to semi-arid conditions and low gradient in the depositional environment. The sequential stratigraphic analysis of the formations Huincul and Lisandro suggests that the deposits are sinorogénic and the different pulses of subsidence are registered in the (Cortejos) AA and BA System Tracks defined in this study...|$|R
