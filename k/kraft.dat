Two <b>Kraft</b> products were involved in direct tie-ins: the Bull's-Eye BBQ Burger in 2005 and the A-1 Steakhouse XT sandwich in 2010. In both cases, Burger King prominently used the names of the <b>Kraft</b> products, A1 Steak Sauce and Bull's-Eye Barbecue Sauce, in the names of the sandwiches. <b>Kraft</b> has supplied several of Burger King's children's products, including a Jell-O brand dessert during BK's Teletubbies promotion in 1999, and the <b>Kraft</b> macaroni and cheese used in its lower-fat kid's meals introduced in 2009.|$|E
5|$|After Gemini 7, <b>Kraft</b> {{stepped back}} from his work at Mission Control, {{allowing}} other flight directors {{to take charge of}} the remaining missions so that he could devote more time to planning for the Apollo program. He served on two review boards at North American Aviation, the contractor responsible for the Apollo capsule. Yet <b>Kraft</b> still felt pangs at not being {{at the center of the}} action, particularly after the emergency re-entry of Gemini 8. Both astronauts and mission controllers had made the right decisions, but, as <b>Kraft</b> confessed to Robert Gilruth, he found himself wishing that he had been the one on the spot.|$|E

5|$|On Christmas Eve, 1968, Apollo 8 {{went into}} {{orbit around the}} moon. Only ten years earlier, <b>Kraft</b> had joined Gilruth's newly founded Space Task Group. Now, the two men sat {{together}} in Mission Control, reflecting on how far they had come. Around them, the room was filled with cheers, but <b>Kraft</b> and Gilruth celebrated more quietly.|$|E

McDougal reported these allegations {{to the police}} and provided tape recordings of the interviews. Detectives interrogated Jackson and eventually persuaded him to enter a mental institution; no murder charges were filed against him due to an absence of direct incriminating evidence.|$|R

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Apollo program, <b>Kraft</b> retired as a flight director to concentrate on management and mission planning. In 1972, he became director of the Manned Spacecraft Center (later Johnson Space Center), {{following in the footsteps of}} his mentor Robert R. Gilruth. He held the position until his 1982 retirement from NASA. During his retirement, <b>Kraft</b> has consulted for numerous companies including IBM and Rockwell International, and he published an autobiography entitled Flight: My Life in Mission Control.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Kraft's</b> {{victims were}} {{typically}} lured into his vehicle {{with an offer}} of a lift or alcohol. Inside <b>Kraft's</b> vehicle, the victims would be plied with alcohol and/or other drugs. They were then bound, tortured, and sexually abused before they were usually killed by either strangulation, asphyxiation, or bludgeoning, although some victims had also ingested fatal doses of pharmaceuticals {{and at least one}} victim was stabbed to death. The victims would then be discarded, usually—though not exclusively—alongside or close to various freeways in southern California.

5|$|Gemini was a {{step forward}} for NASA's manned space program: the Gemini capsule was larger and more {{advanced}} than Mercury, capable of supporting two men {{for up to a}} two-week mission. Because of the longer mission durations, Mission Control began to be manned in shifts. In 1964, Glynn Lunney and Gene Kranz were selected by Chris <b>Kraft</b> to join <b>Kraft</b> and his deputy John Hodge as flight directors. Aged only twenty-eight, Lunney was the youngest of the four.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, <b>Kraft</b> {{began his}} studies at Virginia Tech {{and became a}} member of the Corps of Cadets. During his {{freshman}} year, he attempted to enlist in the military as a U.S. Navy cadet but was rejected because of a burned right hand that he had suffered at age three. Because of wartime demands, Virginia Tech was operating on a twelve-month schedule, and <b>Kraft</b> finished his degree in only two years. He graduated in December 1944 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering.|$|E

Eisenhower signed the National Aeronautics and Space Act, which established NASA and subsumed NACA within this newly created organization. Langley Research Center {{became a part}} of NASA, as did Langley employees such as <b>Kraft.</b> Even before NASA began its official existence in October, <b>Kraft</b> was invited by Gilruth {{to become a part of}} a new group that was working on the problems of putting a man into orbit. Without much hesitation, he accepted the offer. When the Space Task Group was officially formed on November 5, <b>Kraft</b> became one of the original thirty-five engineers to be assigned to Project Mercury, America's man-in-space program.|$|E
