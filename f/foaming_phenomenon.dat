On the other hand, although several studies have been carried out for better understanding the fouling phenomenon in MBR there are still some gaps in the up-to-date knowledge.

40|$|Hydrophobins {{belong to}} the most {{important}} proteins produced by filamentous fungi. They are surface active and their foaming potential {{is due to the}} presence of particular spatial arrangements of hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids. However, their presence eventually leads to overfoaming of beers. In beers and other liquids hydrophobin molecules aggregate around hydrophobic carbon dioxide molecules and form nano-structures, containing entrapped carbon dioxide. By pressure release at opening a bottle of beer, the nano-structures behave as nano-bombs. This explosion causes a sudden release of gaseous carbon dioxide, which is gushing. Several solutions to avoid or to reduce gushing, have been proposed, among which beer pasteurization and the effects of hop components have been studied.

40|$|Slag foaming {{is common}} in pyrometallurgical processes, such as various {{non-ferrous}} operations like sulphide smelting/converting, base metal slag cleaning, steelmaking in basic oxygen furnaces, {{as well as in}} electric arc furnaces. <b>Foaming</b> <b>phenomena</b> remains poorly-understood. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyse the foaming behaviour of SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 -CaO-Fe 2 O 3 -FeO slags upon argon gas injection at various temperatures and slag chemistries, where the slag basicity and FexO were varied. The results are interpreted in terms of physical properties, phase types and phase proportions that were predicted by models from literature. Foaming, as represented by a foam index, appeared to decrease with increasing basicity, until precipitation of solids had occurred. After this point, the foam index increased with increasing basicity. A few published empirical foaming models were statistically evaluated based on the measured foaming indices and physical property predictions, but no conclusive evidence could be found to justify the use of specific predictors of foaming such as bubble size or surface tension depression rather than surface tension. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The correct design, {{operation}} and scale-up of bubble columns {{rely on the}} knowledge of the fluid dynamics at the “bubble-scale” and at the “reactor-scale”. This paper contributes to the existing discussion on the multi-scale fluid dynamics of bubble columns, and provides a complete dataset concerning the influence of the liquid phase properties on bubble column fluid dynamics at “bubble-scale” and at the “reactor-scale”. The bubble column is large-diameter and large-scale (5. 3 m in height, inner diameter of 0. 24 m), it was operated with superficial gas velocities in the range of 0. 004 – 0. 20 m/s, and it was tested for different aspect ratios (in the range 5 – 12. 5). Air was used as the dispersed phase and various fluids (tap water, aqueous solutions of NaCl, a water-ethanol mixture and solutions of water-monoethylene glycol of different concentrations) were employed as liquid phases. The gas holdup measurements were used to investigate the global fluid dynamics, the flow regime transition and the <b>foaming</b> <b>phenomena.</b> Subsequently, the image analysis was used to characterize the bubble size distributions and shapes in the homogeneous flow regime. Finally, the gas holdup and image analysis data were used to estimate the interfacial areas. The experimental data were extensively compared with previous studies and correlations and were used to propose novel correlations to estimate the bubble shapes and the interfacial areas, for the different liquid phases tested. It was found that a change in the liquid phase properties affects the bubble interfacial properties at the “bubble-scale”, thus changing the prevailing bubble size distribution because of the reduced/promoted coalescence phenomena. The variation in the prevailing bubble size distribution affects the “reactor-scale” (gas holdup and flow regime transition) and a lift-force-based approach is used to analyze the relationship between the “bubble-scale” and the “reactor-scale”. When the prevailing bubble size distribution shifts towards larger bubbles, because of the promoted coalescence (i. e., high viscous liquid phases), the lift force pushes the larger bubbles towards the center of the bubble column, inducing “coalescence-induced bubbles” and, consequently, destabilizing the homogeneous flow regime and decreasing the gas holdup. Conversely, when the prevailing bubble size distribution shifts towards smaller bubbles, because of the reduced coalescence (i. e., organic and inorganic active compounds, and low viscous liquid phases), the lift force pushes the small bubbles towards the wall, inducing cluster of bubbles and, consequently, stabilizing the homogeneous flow regime and increasing the gas holdup. In addition, <b>foaming</b> <b>phenomena</b> were observed for organic active compounds, in the case of high aspect ratios only: this observation suggests that the validity of the scale-up criteria is not ensured for all binary systems and future studies will be devoted to provide insights in the scale-up criteria...|$|R

The computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model developed by Sattar et al (Sattar et al., 2013 a, Sattar et al., 2013 c, Sattar et al., 2013 b) was extended to incorporate the chemical reactions on removal of impurity elements. The model includes three phases: gas, liquid and foam. The major removal reactions of carbon (C), silicon (Si), manganese (Mn) and phosphorus (P) were included with the mass transfer within and between gas and liquid phases. The model incorporated the first order diffusion kinetics with static equilibrium values for carbon and silicon, while for manganese and phosphorus, the first order diffusion kinetics with dynamic equilibrium values were used. The real plant data reported in IMPHOS (Millman et al., 2011) report was used for the simulation validation, after simulating it for 20 minutes of real time. The results obtained were in reasonable agreement with the real plant data as reported in the IMPHOS (Millman et al., 2011) report.

40|$|Slag foaming is a {{fundamental}} aspect in both electric arc furnace and oxygen converter steelmaking. In the latter, the unstable foaming can cause the undesired phenomenon of slopping, which implies significant blow-up of the material contained in the converter. The foaming has been studied {{on the basis of}} different approaches; theoretical studies usually based on a dimensional physical analysis and experimental studies. In all the cases, strong non-linear relations among the involved factors of influence have been highlighted, but some lack of consistency among the different results has emerged, especially {{about the role of the}} surface gas velocities and the viscosities of the slag and foam. Therefore, in this study the discussion about the <b>foaming</b> <b>phenomenon</b> has been evaluated through experimental trials developed using oil at different temperatures in order to take into account the effect of the change of the viscosity. The study has permitted the clarification of the reason of the collapse of the foam at a high gas flowrate; this phenomenon being associated to the increase in the average bubble size provided to the already formed structure of the foam.

30|$|Flexible {{polyurethane}} foams {{are used}} in many applications because of their ease of handling, excellent cushioning, and tunable physical properties [1]. They {{are used in}} a variety of commercially established applications like mattresses, automotive and furniture cushions, and carpet backing, to name a few. The main reaction in polyurethane foam processing is the polycondensation of poly-hydroxy compounds (polyols) with diisocyanates. <b>Foaming</b> <b>phenomenon</b> occurs when a small amount of blowing agent and water is added during polymerization process. Water reacts with isocyanate groups giving carbamic acids, which spontaneously lose CO 2, thus generating the foam bubbles [2]. Nevertheless, flexible polyurethane foams like other plastic foams have low mechanical strength and low dimensional stability that could inhibit their use in some important applications such as shoe soles. The mechanical properties could be partly improved by modification of cellular morphology as microstructural studies on rigid polyurethane foams, which have indicated that the compressive strength and modulus of the foams increase by decreasing cell size and narrowing cell size distribution through changing blowing agent. On the other hand, in recent years, polymer nanocomposites have attracted much attention because of their high potential to achieve great improvement in properties including dimensional stability, gas permeability, flame retardancy, and mechanical properties by adding a small amount of nanoparticles in the polymer matrices [3, 4, 5]. Furthermore, {{it has been shown that}} incorporation of nanoparticles with their large surface area and fine dimensions as well as very close contact between particles and the polymer matrix could alter foam morphology and properties.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Foaming {{experiments}} {{in order to}} understand the evolution of the foam structure blown in different directions and levels of gravity have been carried out. The key elements of the experiment are the foam generator body (henceforth FG) and the controlled blowing apparatus. The FG was a polymer foam infiltrated with a suspension (distilled water, pure tenside (SDS, 0. 05 m%) and SiO 2 nanoparticles (2 m%)) Foams were blown out at 1. 5, 2, 4, 6, 10 and at 15 g levels in three different directions (0, 90 and 180 o, measured to the direction of the gravity vector). The elevated gravity condition was implemented in a hyper-g centrifuge (ZARM Bremen). Results show that foams can be created even at high gravity levels though the foamability and foam structure alters a lot by varying gravity level and foaming direction. At higher g-levels, under fixed gas flow rate and blowing time less foam could be produced. The average cell size varied with the blowing directions but proved constant on any gravity levels. On base of the gravity direction dependent pressure curves the foaming process was interpreted in detail. It was found that the sedimentation ruled capillary clogging is the main process by causing the gravity direction dependent <b>foaming</b> <b>phenomena.</b> The unexpected observation is that the foam stability does not depend on the gravity level...|$|R

The present work is dedicated to the impregnation of intraocular lenses (IOLs) with antibiotics using supercritical carbon dioxide as impregnation vector. Commercially available intraocular lenses have been impregnated with cefuroxime sodium in order to obtain ophthalmic drug delivery systems dedicated to the prevention of postoperative endophthalmitis in cataract surgery. The influence of the variation of some experimental operating conditions such as the pressure (8 – 20 MPa), the temperature (308 and 333 K), the impregnation duration (1 – 5 h), the addition of a cosolvent (ethanol) or the depressurisation rate (slow and rapid depressurisation) has been studied. In certain experimental conditions, foaming phenomena have been observed. In order to evaluate the impregnation efficiency, the impregnation yields were quantified gravimetrically and the drug release profiles were determined through in vitro drug release studies carried out at 310 K and in a solution simulating the aqueous humor. At rapid depressurisation rates, controlled drug release IOLs with impregnation yields varying between 0. 002 and 0. 063 mgdrug/mgIOL were obtained. Increasing the pressure or adding a cosolvent were favourable to enhance the impregnation yields. However, a non desired <b>foaming</b> <b>phenomenon</b> was observed for the most favourable conditions. By carrying out slow depressurisations, foaming phenomena were avoided. Nevertheless, in these conditions, the impregnation process was less efficient. The drug partition seems to be more favourable towards the supercritical phase than towards the polymer and the impregnation phenomena governed by a deposition mechanism rather than a molecular dispersion of the active ingredient.

40|$|AbstractMetal foams have {{potential}} for variety of {{applications such as}} ultra-light weight structural components, heat insulations and energy absorber. Commercially available metal foams are made mostly by aluminum alloys, which are manufactured using titanium hydride as a foaming agent. Iron based metal foam has several advantages over aluminum alloy foam such as high strength, high energy absorbability and low cost. However, {{it is hard to}} manufacture iron foam using conventional foaming agents because of a significant difference between their decomposition temperatures and melting point of iron. Further, even if good foaming agent can be utilized, it is also difficult to obtain iron foam with high porosity. In this study, therefore, new manufacturing method of porous iron by foaming of molten oxide and reduction of foamed oxide was studied. This <b>foaming</b> <b>phenomenon</b> is very famous in the field of steel making, while it should be suppressed. The tablet of Fe, Fe 2 O 3, Al 2 O 3, and CaCO 3 was heated rapidly in the crucible to foam the molten oxide by carbon dioxide generated from carbonate in the inert atmosphere. The target oxide system is FeO–Fe 2 O 3 –CaO–Al 2 O 3. The time, at which maximum porosity was obtained, became longer with decreasing the foaming temperature. This is because the decomposition rate of CO 2 from CaCO 3, which is foaming agent of this method, decreases with decreasing temperature. Maximum porosity of the oxide was approximately 57 % at 1350 °C, and the pore shape obtained in this study was spherical. After reduction of the iron oxide in the obtained foam to the reduction degree of 95 %, the composite material of metallic iron, oxide, and pore was obtained with higher porosity than this oxide...|$|E

The drying of o/w emulsions of different oil viscosities on hydrophobic and hydrophilic substrates was studied. The hydrophobic substrate was found to destabilise the oil droplets and {{to result in a}} different mechanism for forming continuous oil film. Studies of adsorption behaviour of a series of non-ionic diblock copolymers at relevant interfaces showed that the adsorption behaviour at hydrophobic and hydrophilic solid surfaces differed at high polymer concentration. Emulsion droplets were found to interact with the hydrophobic interface. Adsorption at silicone oil-water interface resembled adsorption at solid hydrophobic surfaces. Gas was generated through chemical reaction at the interface between two immiscible liquids and the bubbles formation from the generated was studied optically. The gas bubble size was seen to be uninfluenced by the reaction rate. However, bubble formation was seen to take place in one of the phases, held up at the interface before detaching from the interface with a surrounding aqueous film. It was argued that this may affect the final bubble sizes. Slag foaming at high temperatures was studied in laboratory scale with X-ray imaging under dynamic conditions. The foam displayed a fluctuating behaviour, which the presently available models are not able to take into account. The concept of foaming index was found to be unsatisfactory in describing the foaming behaviour under dynamic conditions, thus emphasizing the need for alternative theories. The rate of fluctuations was seen {{to be related to the}} difference between rate of gas generation and rate of gas escape from the system (Ug-Ue) as well as the bubble sizes.

Upon usage, the MEA solution is contaminated with hydrocarbon and suspended solids. Heavily contaminated MEA solution reduces its effectiveness in stripping the CO 2 gas and also causes <b>foaming</b> <b>phenomenon</b> in the CO 2 removal unit which further reduces the overall performance of the unit. There are many instances in which during operation, the solution overshoot and mix with condensed water in the knock-out drum. At this point, all the solution (the contaminated solution and the condensed water) is discharged as wastewater and replaced with fresh solution. It is common, in the range of 60 – 80 tons of MEA wastewater is generated per month. This study was conducted to examine the best method of treating the MEA wastewater for {{the best interest of the}} company. Characterization of the MEA wastewater suggested that the most rational way of treating the wastewater was to achieve quality suited for the purpose of recycling it back into the system. Adsorption method was used for the treatment with four different types of adsorbent, namely chitosan, activated carbon, alum and zeolite, were investigated. Five different variables, namely adsorbent dosage, pH, temperature, mixing time and mixing speed were varied to examine the effect on the parameters such as percentage of residue oil, suspended solids, MEA concentration and COD level. The results showed that chitosan was the best adsorbent in treating the MEA wastewater, followed by activated carbon, alum and zeolite. Adsorbent dosage was the main variable affecting the performance of the adsorbent in removing the residue oil, suspended solids and reducing the COD level.

40|$|The {{removal of}} acid gases from natural gas stream is an {{important}} process in many gas processing plants and for environmental protection. The most widely used acid gas removal technology nowadays is the absorption process using amine-based solvent. Foaming is the major cause that leads operational problems, resulting in excessive solvent losses, failure to meet treated gas specification {{and a reduction in}} gas treating capacity. Therefore, the main objectives of this research were to study the foam characteristics and the surface tension phenomenon of alkanolamines solution and to reduce their foaming promoters. The effect of natural gas impurities (foam promoters) in the blended methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) -piperazine solution such as hydrocarbon liquids, iron sulfide (dissolved solid), sodium chloride (salt), acetic acid (organic acid), methanol (hydrate inhibitor) and glycol (dehydrating agent) were investigated. The concentration of MDEA was found to significantly influence the foam activity in the solution. Iron sulfide, hydrocarbon and sodium chloride present in the solution had been identified as the impurities which apparently contributed to the high foaming tendency. At 5000 ppm concentration of impurities, the foam height achieved was 425 ml. Iron sulfide appeared to be the major foam promoter in the range of concentration solutions studied. Response surface methodology and central composite design had been applied to optimize the three factors that affected the <b>foaming</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> These factors were then correlated to the surface tension and foaming tendency. Asymmetric mixed matrix membrane (MMM) was applied to remove foam promoters in the amine solvent in order to reduce its foaming tendency. The MMM characteristics and performance were tested using scanning electron microscope, differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared and membrane filtration tests. The contents of iron sulfide, hydrocarbon and sodium chloride as the main foam promoters had been successfully reduced as indicated by reduction of surface tension values by 12 %, 6. 3 % and 16 % respectively.

40|$|Foaming {{incidents}} {{have been}} recorded in many biogas plants causing severe operational, economical and environmental problems (Kougias et al., 2014). However, the <b>foaming</b> <b>phenomenon</b> in biogas reactors fed with agro-industrial wastes has not been extensively investigated, especially {{with respect to the}} microbial composition of the digesters (Moeller et al., 2012). In the cited literature, {{it has been reported that}} specific microorganisms, which are mainly filamentous (e. g. Gordonia species, Microthrix parvicella), are attached to biogas bubbles and transferred to the air/liquid interface of sludge reactors or wastewater treatment works (Ganidi et al., 2009). Once these microorganisms accumulate on the liquid surface, they initiate biosurfactants production due to their metabolic activity, leading to the decrease of the surface tension and thus generate foaming. The aim of the present study was to investigate the microbial diversity in the liquid versus the foaming layer in manure-based biogas reactors suffering by foaming incidents in order to elucidate potential role and contribution of the microorganisms in foam promotion. The experimental work was carried out in three thermophilic continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTR) fed with manure and supplemental amounts of lipids, proteins and carbohydrates. Once foaming was formed in the reactors, samples from the liquid and foaming layer were obtained and screened using 16 S rDNA sequencing. The results of these analyses revealed that there are indeed some species that significantly vary their relative abundance in the foaming layer compared to the liquid one (e. g. Methanoculleus sp., Dialister sp.). However, based on the cited literature and to the best of our knowledge there was not a direct correlation of these species with foaming. Further investigation is needed in order to define the properties of these species on foam generation. Finally, it was observed that particles of barley plant (that was contained in the raw manure as ingredient of animal nutrition) were accumulated in the foaming layer. It has been previously documented that barley contributes in stabilization of beer foam due to the activity of one of its proteins (Brey et al., 2003). For that reason, it could be hypothesised that the existence of barley particles in our reactors could contribute in foaming although their presence was also prior to the foaming incidents; their effect on foam formation or stabilization might be enhanced in correlation with other parameters (i. e. presence of specific microorganisms).

40|$|Steady-state rising foam is {{an ideal}} medium for {{studying}} <b>foam</b> coalescence <b>phenomena.</b> The coalescence process {{in this type of}} foam is characterized analytically. The spatial distribution of bubble size depends on the effect of individual coalescence events on the bubble size distribution, the rate at which they occur, and the rise rate of the bubbles. The film rupture rate is assumed to depend on the film area and the film drainage time, and is calculated using several simple models. This analysis agrees well with measurements conducted in a laboratory foam cell. However, the time-scale of the experiments indicated that film drainage was occurring predominantly in the hydrodynamic regime, and that non-equilibrium rupture mechanisms were primarily responsible for the observed coalescence...|$|R
40|$|Silicomanganese(SiMn) and {{ferromanganese}} (FeMn) represent essential {{ingredients for}} the steel producing industries due to enhancing effects on steel quality. While extensive {{efforts have been}} made in investigating the kinetics of ferromanganese production, kinetic information on the silicomanganese process is rather scarce. The goal of this work was to investigate how different raw materials/charge compositions affect the reduction rate of MnO and SiO 2 in SiMn production. The experimental work was carried out in a thermogravimetric furnace in CO-gas at ambient pressure with coke as reducing agent. Investigated charge compositions contained ore (Comilog or Assmang) and HC FeMn slag in a 1 : 1 ratio, quartz and coke. Melting behaviour was investigated for the mentioned Comilog charge at temperatures 1200 - 1400 °C and compared to charge based on Comilog and quartz at corresponding temperatures. Both mixing and layering of raw materials in crucible were evaluated. The slag formation temperature was determined to be in the range of 1250 - 1300 °C for all investigated charges. All materials had formed a slag phase at 1250 °C when materials were prepared by mixing in the crucible, whereas the quartz particles remained undissolved until 1300 °C when prepared by layering. Assmang and Comilog in combination with HC FeMn slag and quartz show highly similar reduction behaviour, however the rapid reduction stage was initiated at a lower temperature for Assmang, i. e 1535 °C vs 1545 °C for Comilog. Charges based on Comilog ore, HC FeMn slag and quartz start to reduce at approximately 50 °C lower temperature compared to charges based on Comilog, quartz and coke (and limestone), in spite of lower sulphur content, lower basicity and lower driving force. There was no observed correlation between the total basicity/viscosity and the reduction rate. However, it was shown that the rate constant increases with the sulphur content. Foaming was observed at 1550 °C for Assmang charges, whereas the first occurrence was at approximately 1560 °C for Comilog. It was concluded that the <b>foaming</b> <b>phenomena</b> is a result of initiation of the rapid reduction stage...|$|R
40|$|Secondary {{biological}} treatment of wastewater {{is a complex}} process {{and one of the}} most important steps to ensure the quality of the final effluent in activated sludge plants. In activated sludge systems, the performance of the process largely depends on the balance between filamentous and floc-forming bacteria. When the normal balance of the community is disturbed, filamentous bacteria tend to proliferate, causing various problems. Bulking and <b>foaming</b> <b>phenomena</b> are the major problems referred usually resulting in poor sedimentation of sludge and low quality final effluents. The application of selector reactor technology has become one of the promoted methods for the control of filamentous proliferation, enhancing sludge settleability in activated sludge systems. The main objective of this research was the use of an aerobic selector to improve the performance of an urban wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), located in North of Portugal with two different parallel lines of treatment during four months. This WWTP receive domestic wastewater with irregular industrial discharges. This WWTP was followed with recurrent episodes of filamentous bulking caused by Sphaerotilus natans and eventual occurrences of Nocardioforms and Type 1863. An aerobic selector was introduced in both lines in the beginning of the studied period, suppressed in one of the lines during 6 weeks, and then put into operation again until the end of the study. A total of 14 filamentous bacteria morphotypes were identified. The results show that the aerobic biological selector in continuous operation prevented the overgrowth of the filamentous Type 1863, of Nocardioforms and, in particular, of Sphaerotilus natans. Simultaneously, it allowed to lowering the oxygen levels in the aeration tanks without negative consequences in the overall performance of the WWTP, namely bulking occurrence. In this way, a significant energy save was allowed, even considering the aeration of the selector. The results are more relevant if one considers the fact that the main cause of the bulking problems in this WWTP was the overgrowth of Sphaerotilus natans, a filamentous bacterium known to be stimulated by low dissolved oxygen (DO) levels...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} computational {{analysis of}} the complex dynamics observed in chemically blown polyurethane foams during reaction injection molding process. The mathematical formulation introduces an experimentally motivated non-divergence free setup for the continuity equations which reflects the self expanding behaviour observed in the physical system. The <b>foam</b> growth <b>phenomena</b> which is normally initiated by adequate pre-mixing of necessary reactant polymers, leading to an exothermic polymerization reaction, bubble nucleation, and gas formation, is captured numerically. We assume the dependence of material viscosity {{on the degree of}} cure/polymerization, gas volume fraction, and temperature as well as nondependence of mixture density on pressure. The set of unsteady nonlinear coupled partial differential equations describing the dynamics of the system are solved numerically for state variables using finite volume techniques such that the front of the flow is tracked w ith high resolution interface capturing schemes. Graphical representation of the foam volume fraction, evolution of foam heights, and temperature distributions is presented. Results from our simulations are validated with experimental data. These results show good quantitative agreement with observations from experiments...|$|R
50|$|The {{absence of}} oil (or the {{significantly}} lower oil content compared to traditionally brewed coffee) makes the system more stable and the bubbles do not collapse {{with the same}} ease as in crema. Soon after the foam is created, a process of thickening takes place where water molecules are constantly pushed out of the frothy mixture. The water is pushed out due to drainage occurring due to pressure differentials along the foam septum. Higher viscosity will retard the phenomenon, {{and that is the}} reason that the addition of sugar will create a better <b>foam.</b> The <b>phenomenon</b> continues until bubbles come very close together and the foam almost solidifies. This process can take between 2 minutes to 10 minutes and depends strongly on the agitation process during mixing. As the bubbles come closer together they will slowly start to coalesce and create bigger bubbles. According to the Laplace pressure equation, variation in bubble size will result in faster collapsing of the bubbles since the bigger bubbles will consume the smaller ones. Hand-mixers create smaller and more uniformly sized bubbles. The smaller bubble size reduces the bubble pressure gradient and forms a much longer lasting foam.|$|R

One of the influential factors affecting the mechanism of foam flow in porous media is the flow rate. The experimental work was performed at flow rate ranging from 0. 0001 to 2. 5000 ml/min. This thesis determined {{the effect of the}} flow rates on foam flow mechanism in porous media. Micromodel was used as the porous media in order to enable the observation of the <b>foam</b> movement.

A subcontract was given to investigate techniques {{for the production of}} gelled liquid hydrogen, develop a process design for scale-up to a 1. 89 cu m (500 gallon) gel production and storage facility, determine gel transfer characteristics, determine the solubility rate of gaseous helium in the gel, and investigate the gross gel/PPO <b>foam</b> interfacial <b>phenomena.</b> An inside-tank process for scaled-up production of gelled liquid hydrogen was selected. No detectable gel structure degradation occurred during repeated shearing. The viscosity of gelled liquid hydrogen at shear rates of 300 /sec and higher is 2 to 5 -fold greater than that of neat liquid hydrogen. No clogging problems were encountered during the transfer of gelled liquid hydrogen through warmed transfer lines. The solubility rate of helium in liquid hydrogen was significantly reduced by the presence of gel structure. The boil-off rates from gelled liquid hydrogen were reduced from 25 to 50 percent compared to those observed for the neat liquid hydrogen under compatible conditions. The polyphenylene oxide (PPO) foam insulation was found to be compatible with liquid ethane...|$|R
40|$|Bone is {{a natural}} {{cellular}} composite, with a gradient structure going from a loose interconnected core to an outer dense wall, thus minimising bone weight while maintaining a high mechanical performance. Bone can be repaired using either auto- or allo- grafts, which, however, have a limited availability, or present pathogen transmission risks, respectively. Synthetic tissue grafts are therefore investigated {{in order to provide}} porous scaffolds, seeded with the appropriate type of cells, as templates for tissue regeneration. This study focused on composite scaffolds based on polymer matrices. The objectives were to understand how different <b>foaming</b> <b>phenomena</b> are affected by the addition of fillers into the polymer, to investigate their effect on the structural and mechanical properties of foams, and then to propose and optimise a solvent free process in order to prepare bioresorbable composite scaffolds suitable for bone tissue engineering applications. The comparison of several processes resulting in porous matrices led to choose supercritical CO 2 foaming as a flexible technique to manufacture cellular structures, with the possibility of adding fibres or fillers. First, the integration of glass fibres into polyurethane (PUR) and polyethylene terephtalate (PET) foams, processed by reactive and gas foaming respectively, was investigated in order to study the potential improvement of mechanical properties of porous polymers. With the PUR system, modulus was shown to increase with fibre content, and an optimum fibre length existed. With PET, dense and heterogeneous structures were obtained. In both cases a homogeneous mixing of the two components was required before foaming. Gas foaming of bioresorbable neat polymers, poly(L-lactic acid) (PLA) and poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), was carried out in a high-pressure vessel. A wide variety of PLA cellular structures was obtained, with open and closed pores, of diameters between 0. 2 and 1. 0 mm, and a range of porosity (70 - 92 %) and modulus (10 - 180 MPa). On the contrary, using PLGA led to closed, larger pores, and a low modulus. Only PLA was therefore considered as a matrix for composite foaming. Hydroxyapatite (HA) and β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP), were then added to PLA in order to improve mechanical resistance, to regulate pH during scaffold resorption, and, owing to their intrinsic osteoconductivity, to favour mineralisation. Composite preforms were prepared by three different techniques: mixing powders in the dry state, dispersion in polymer solution, and melt-extrusion. Observation of the ceramic distribution, measurements of glass transition and melting temperatures, and tensile tests led to select and optimise melt-extrusion as a clean technique for preparing homogeneous ceramic-polymer preforms. Structural analysis of composite foams produced in the highpressure chamber enabled us to define processing windows as a function of pressure release and cooling rates. HA or β-TCP filled PLA foams were obtained, with porosity between 74 and 83 %, pore size between 0. 1 and 1 mm, and modulus between 30 and 250 MPa. Microcomputed tomography confirmed the anisotropy in cellular morphology. Compression tests were also performed and revealed the anisotropic and viscoelastic behaviour of the porous polymer and composite structures. Finally, in collaboration with the Laboratory of Orthopaedic Research (LRO-EPFL) and the Hôpital Orthopédique de Suisse Romande (HO-CHUV), the biocompatibility of the developed structures with human primary foetal bone cells was demonstrated, as they proliferated on the template surfaces and differentiated. Foaming parameters could thus be defined to create composite scaffolds suitable for bone tissue engineering applications. Structural and mechanical properties similar to those of cancellous bone were demonstrated and promising in vitro tests were conducted. Therefore the developed scaffolds can now be evaluated in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Pendant drop tensiometry {{offers a}} simple and elegant {{solution}} to determining surface and interfacial tension - a central parameter in many colloidal systems including emulsions, <b>foams</b> and wetting <b>phenomena.</b> The technique involves the acquisition of a silhouette of an axisymmetric fluid droplet, and iterative fitting of the Young-Laplace equation that balances gravitational deformation of the drop with the restorative interfacial tension. Since the advent of high-quality digital cameras and desktop computers, this process has been automated with high speed and precision. However, despite its beguiling simplicity, there are complications and limitations that accompany pendant drop tensiometry connected with both Bond number (the balance between interfacial tension and gravitational forces) and drop volume. Here, we discuss the process involved with going from a captured experimental image to a fitted interfacial tension value, highlighting pertinent features and limitations along the way. We introduce a new parameter, the Worthington number, Wo, to characterise the measurement precision.
