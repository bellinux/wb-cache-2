5|$|A {{magnetostrictive}} material is one which changes shape when {{a magnetic field}} is applied. In reverse, it produces a magnetic field when <b>distorted.</b> <b>The</b> magnetostrictive transducer requires a coil of conducting wire around the {{magnetostrictive material}}. The coil either induces a magnetic field in the transducer and sets it in motion or else picks up an induced current from {{the motion of the}} transducer at the filter output. It is also usually necessary to have a small magnet to bias the magnetostrictive material into its operating range. It is possible to dispense with the magnets if the biasing is taken care of on the electronic side by providing a d.c. current superimposed on the signal, but this approach would detract from the generality of the filter design.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the group}} wanted to release an album cover using an edited image from a Holy Communion card, showing {{children}} joining hands. The image had been photocopied several times, {{so it had}} become <b>distorted.</b> <b>The</b> art direction was by John Maybury, a college friend of Morris. Their manager, Stevenson, was unable to determine who owned the copyright and advised that the band would be bankrupted if they were sued as a result. Polydor also became nervous about copyright infringement, so the artwork was pulled at the last minute; the record company's executives also disliked its religious nature. A UK tour had already been scheduled {{to coincide with the}} release of the album, so there was no possibility of delaying the release.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of Saadanius provides new evidence for competing hypotheses about the facial {{appearance of the}} ancestral crown catarrhines, or common ancestor. One reconstruction is based on living catarrhine traits and predicts a short face and a rounded braincase, {{similar to that of}} a gibbon. Another reconstruction, based on the morphology of early Miocene apes and the basal cercopithecoid Victoriapithecus, predicts that the last common ancestor had a projecting snout and tall face, like that of living baboons and the oldest fossil apes and Old World monkeys. The conservative features of Saadanius, {{similar to those of the}} older stem catarrhines, support the latter hypothesis, according to Zalmout et al. However, one palaeontologist, Eric Delson, has cautioned that geological pressure may have <b>distorted</b> <b>the</b> shape of the skull.|$|E

5|$|A {{circulation}} {{began to}} form on June 18 {{in the eastern}} Gulf of Mexico, prompting gale warnings. It was declared Subtropical Depression One the same day. The depression made landfall {{on the morning of}} June 18 just north of Spring Hill, Florida and gained subtropical storm status over land. The storm was classified as Subtropical Storm One by the National Hurricane Center, as the rule was not to name subtropical storms. The subtropical storm moved to the northeast and crossed the Outer Banks of North Carolina on June 19. Even though the minimum central pressures remained low, the circulation expanded and became <b>distorted.</b> <b>The</b> subtropical storm peaked at 70mph winds (110km/h) on June 18, but did not reach its minimum pressure until June 20, when it dropped to 984mbar (29.07inHg). The subtropical storm was declared an extratropical storm near the Canadian Maritimes the same day.|$|E
5|$|After {{maintaining}} its peak intensity for about 24hours, Kyle began weakening on September27 as increased upper-level shear restricted outflow and <b>distorted</b> <b>the</b> convection envelope; drier air {{also contributed to}} the weakening. On September 28, after turning west-northwestward, the hurricane weakened to tropical storm status, and by the next day the center had become devoid of deep convection. A trough passing to its north and a developing ridge to its west left the storm nearly stationary for several days. The weakening rate of Kyle was temporarily halted when thunderstorms redeveloped on September29 and again early the next day, though late on September30 the storm weakened to tropical depression status. The circulation had become elongated from northeast to southwest. The northeastern portion became associated with the approaching frontal zone, and was briefly monitored for signs of development. However, the southwestern portion redeveloped convection and became the dominant circulation.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression was experiencing slight easterly wind shear, which <b>distorted</b> <b>the</b> convection {{to the west}} of the circulation. However, favorable conditions for strengthening were expected, and the depression was forecast to reach peak winds of 50mph (85km/h) before weakening. It tracked slowly northwestward along the southern periphery of a ridge, and quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Kristy after convection increased over its circulation center. By that time, wind shear had decreased to very low levels, and with very warm waters, the storm was expected to quickly intensify to reach hurricane status. By late on August30, the convection was wrapping into the center while an eye feature became intermittent. Organization continued, and Kristy attained hurricane status early on August31, about 30hours after forming. Six hours after attaining hurricane status, an eye-like featured was evident on satellite imagery, and it is estimated Kristy attained peak winds of 80mph (130km/h) about 550mi (880km) southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California. However, satellite-derived intensity estimates suggested the hurricane could have been as strong as 105mph (170km/h), or as weak as a tropical storm.|$|E

25|$|Qutb, {{dissatisfied}} with the condition of contemporary Islam, identified its benighted state as having two principal causes. The first was that many Muslims were forsaking {{their faith in the}} Qur'an, thereby disturbing the cosmic balance in the world. This had led to the virulent spread of a secular culture within Muslim societies, which, with the assistance of Western imperialism and colonialism that <b>distorted</b> <b>the</b> existing order, was a second important cause of the straying of many Muslims from the right path. Qutb asserted that the Islamic world had sunk into a state of Jahiliyyah (ignorance and foolishness).|$|E

Judaism included images and cultic statues in the First Temple period, the Second Temple period, Late Antiquity (2nd to 8th century CE), and thereafter.|$|E

25|$|In addition, war {{narratives}} {{were transformed}} into literature by (among others) the publishing houses, which <b>distorted</b> <b>the</b> perception {{and treatment of}} captivity. Nicolas Beaupré cites the letter of one of Éditions Berger-Levrault’s directors in which he insists on giving a direction to the publication of war stories, more for vainglory than a depiction of events: “Currently we, {{more than any other}} publishing house, are editing, as much at Nancy as in Paris, with very restrained means. If we can hold on and publish only good publications on the war, the House will emerge from the conflict in more of a starring role than before”.
