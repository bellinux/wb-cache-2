5|$|Andrew's sketch {{leads to}} the {{identification}} of the kidnapper as Joanne Ostler (Gillian Jacobs), a MIT neurologist who was previously believed deceased. Joanne tricks Ben into helping her complete an unfinished equation by using the <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mother, who died in the car accident. Meanwhile, Walter suddenly remembers that he heard about the lights from former mathematician Dashiell Kim (Randall Duk Kim), an old bunkmate at St. Claire's Hospital who disappeared under similar circumstances. To discover the child's whereabouts, Olivia encourages Walter to return to St. Claire's. The visit does not go well, and Walter is held by hospital administrator Dr. Bruce Sumner (William Sadler), who remains unconvinced of Walter's sanity.|$|E
5|$|Neuman and EUROSEC {{official}} Lise Hartman (Loni von Friedl) interrogate Ross, who {{denies that}} he aborted the mission. Shortly after, Kane dies from his injuries. Eventually, Ross concludes {{that he is}} not on Earth, but is on the unknown planet – a Counter-Earth that is a mirror <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>his.</b> Signs of this reversal include a clock whose hands move anticlockwise, a tape deck's reels that turn clockwise and an oscilloscope that scans from right to left.|$|E
5|$|Mateiu Caragiale had {{his first}} {{thoughts}} on Craii de Curtea-Veche in 1910. Two years later, {{during a trip to}} Iași, he published his first 13 poems in the literary magazine Viața Românească, winning the praise of poet Panait Cerna and the ridicule of writer Tudor Arghezi. Literary critic Șerban Cioculescu stressed that these had been printed following his father's interventions with the magazine's staff, and, according to the contemporary account of Luca's brother-in-law, philosopher Ionel Gherea, Ion Luca admired his son's contributions, his criticism being minimal, constructive, and welcomed by Mateiu. This led Gherea to conclude that, copying in real life a Symbolist cliché, Caragiale-son fabricated an unfair <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father. In later years, Mateiu continued to write poetry, published by literary promoter Constantin Banu in his magazine, Flacăra.|$|E

5|$|The {{tolerance}} of violence within mainstream American {{culture is the}} central theme of the record, which takes a critical look at the roles gun culture, conservative American Christianity, and traditional family values play in the glorification of violence. A substantive portion of the album analyzes the cultural role of Jesus Christ, specifically Manson's view that the <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> crucifixion became the origin of celebrity. Manson said that while his previous work argued against {{the credibility of the}} Bible's content, for the purpose of Holy Wood, he instead looked for things in the Bible to which he could relate. He developed an opinion that Christ was a revolutionary figure—a person who was killed for having dangerous opinions, and whose image was later exploited and merchandised for financial gain by entities such as the Vatican.|$|E
25|$|Obama {{formed an}} <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> absent father from stories told {{by his mother}} and her parents.

Eyre may have hoped to make the public <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> predecessors and in-laws seem more respectable to the growing Anglican community in Calcutta. Even so, the monument was built by Bengali craftsmen, and its incorporation of Indo-Islamic design reflects the intersection of two cultures which their union personified.|$|E

25|$|As Wali Khan {{withdrew from}} politics, his {{contact with the}} press and public became limited. This period in the 1990s would be marked by his party's {{assumption}} of power in alliance with former army-backed opponents, a focus only on provincial politics, the increasing influence of his wife in party affairs, corruption scandals hitting the once clean <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> supporters {{and in particular the}} focus on renaming the NWFP Pakhtunkhwa ('The Pashtun side/ territory').|$|E

25|$|In 1992, the convicted {{serial killer}} Kenneth Bianchi, {{one-half}} of the pair known as the Hillside Stranglers, sued Yronwode for 8.5 million dollars for having an <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> face depicted on a trading card; he claimed his face was his trademark. The judge dismissed the case after ruling that, if Bianchi had been using his face as a trademark when he was killing women, {{he would not have}} tried to hide it from the police.|$|E
25|$|There are no {{definite}} {{historical records}} concerning the particular shroud currently at Turin Cathedral {{prior to the}} 14th century. A burial cloth, which some historians maintain was the Shroud, was owned by the Byzantine emperors but disappeared during the Sack of Constantinople in 1204. Although there are numerous reports of Jesus' burial shroud, or an <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> head, of unknown origin, being venerated in various locations before the 14th century, there is no historical evidence that these refer to the shroud currently at Turin Cathedral.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the 10th century {{no attempt}} was made to use a human to symbolize God the Father in Western art. Yet, Western art {{eventually}} required some way to illustrate the presence of the Father, so through successive representations a set of artistic styles for symbolizing the Father using a man gradually emerged around the 10th century AD. A rationale for the use of a human is the belief that God created the soul of Man in the <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>His</b> own (thus allowing Human to transcend the other animals).|$|E

25|$|In 2004, Vassil Dobrev of the Institut Français d'Archéologie Orientale in Cairo {{announced}} he had uncovered new evidence the Great Sphinx {{may have been}} the work of the little-known Pharaoh Djedefre (2528–2520BC), Khafra's half brother and a son of Khufu. Dobrev suggests Djedefre built the Sphinx in the <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father Khufu, identifying him with the sun god Ra in order to restore respect for their dynasty. Dobrev also notes, like Stadelmann and others, the causeway connecting Khafre's pyramid to the temples was built around the Sphinx suggesting it was already in existence at the time.|$|E
25|$|On July 25, 2014, a new 5,000 won note dated 2013 was {{released}} into circulation. Instead of depicting {{the portrait of}} North Korea's founder Kim Il-sung, the note depicts an <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> birthplace in Mangyondae and on the back the International Friendship Exhibition in Myohyangsan that displays gifts he and his son Kim Jong-il received from foreign leaders. There has been ongoing speculation that this could indicate plans for higher denominations to be released later which would depict Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il, or possibly both. However the official reason behind the change was to combat counterfeiters.|$|E
25|$|Several {{different}} kinds of screens were proposed during the following decades, but the first half-tone photo-engraving process was invented by Canadians George-Édouard Desbarats and William Leggo Jr. On October 30, 1869, Desbarats published the Canadian Illustrated News which became the world's first periodical to successfully employ this photo-mechanical technique; featuring a full page half-tone <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>His</b> Royal Highness Prince Arthur, from a photograph by Notman. Ambitious to exploit a much larger circulation, Debarats and Leggo went to New York and launched the New York Daily Graphic in March 1873, which became the world's first illustrated daily.|$|E

25|$|Insurgent {{activity}} was in decline {{by the end}} of 1992, and Fujimori took credit for this abatment, claiming that his campaign had largely eliminated the insurgent threat. After the 1992 auto-coup, the intelligence work of the DINCOTE (National Counter-Terrorism Directorate) led to the capture of the leaders from MRTA and the Shining Path, including notorious Shining Path leader Abimael Guzmán. Guzmán's capture was a political coup for Fujimori, who used it to great effect in the press; in an interview with documentarian Ellen Perry, Fujimori even notes that he specially ordered Guzmán's prison jumpsuit to be white with black stripes, to enhance the <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> capture in the media.|$|E
25|$|On September 7, 1927, Philo Farnsworth's image {{dissector}} camera tube transmitted its first image, a simple straight line, at his laboratory at 202 Green Street in San Francisco. By September 3, 1928, Farnsworth had developed the system sufficiently to hold a demonstration for the press. This {{is widely regarded as}} the first electronic television demonstration. In 1929, the system was further improved by elimination of a motor generator, so that his television system now had no mechanical parts. That year, Farnsworth transmitted the first live human images with his system, including a three and a half-inch <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wife Elma ("Pem") with her eyes closed (possibly due to the bright lighting required).|$|E
25|$|Like {{traditional}} western maps, the Fairylogue and Radio-Play map {{showed the}} west on the left, {{and the east}} on the right. However, the first map of Oz to appear in an Oz book had those directions reversed, and the compass rose adjusted accordingly. It is believed {{that this is a}} result of Baum copying the map from {{the wrong side of the}} glass slide, effectively getting a mirror <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> intended map. When he realized he was copying the slide backward, he reversed the compass rose to make the directions correct. However, an editor at Reilly and Lee reversed the compass rose, thinking he was fixing an error, and resulting in further confusion. Most notably, this confused Ruth Plumly Thompson, who frequently reversed directions in her own Oz books as a result.|$|E
