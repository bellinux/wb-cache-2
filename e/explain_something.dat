5|$|After {{the second}} chorus, in a climatic sequence, the singer holds a gun up to Judas' mouth, and {{a stick of}} red {{lipstick}} bursts out and smears his lips. The scene portrays Gaga's choice to refuse to shoot Judas through the heart. As the breakdown ends, the music stops and Gaga is seen in a bathtub with Jesus and Judas, washing their feet and cleaning it with her hair. The sequence is interspersed with Gaga standing lonely on a rock as waves engulf her, the scene being reminiscent of artist Sandro Botticelli's The Birth of Venus and Jesus marching towards his fatal destiny. The music restarts and Judas is shown pouring beer in the bathtub. Next Jesus is shown standing on a stage, surrounded by his supporters, the setting being inspired by scaffoldings present around newly constructed buildings in New York. Gaga kneels in front of Jesus and tries to <b>explain</b> <b>something</b> to him, but he places his palm on her head as Judas looks on. After Judas delivers the fateful kiss upon Jesus' cheeks, marking him for his death, Gaga falls {{on the ground with}} a silent, anguished cry. The video ends with the death of neither Judas nor Jesus, but of Gaga as she's stoned to death by the crowd.|$|E
25|$|The pure {{dance is}} called a nritta, while the {{expressive}} dance {{is called a}} nritya. A Kathak performance can be solo, duo or team. In a technical performance, the speed and energy the dancers exchange with the audience increases in multiples, that is the tempo doubles or quadruples. During the performance, {{one or more of}} the Kathak artists may come to the microphone, interact with the audience, <b>explain</b> <b>something,</b> tell an anecdote in a particular language, or rhythmically recite a song.|$|E
25|$|Also {{strongly}} {{critical of}} reductionist accounts of mind (e.g., behaviorism), he maintained {{to the contrary}} that mind {{is the reality of}} which we are in fact most certain. Thought, he held, is that activity of mind which aims at truth, and the ultimate object of thought is full understanding of the Absolute. Such understanding comes about, in his view, through a grasp of necessity: to understand (or <b>explain)</b> <b>something</b> is to see it as necessitated within a system of which it is a part.|$|E

25|$|As the {{government}} enacts laws limiting operating areas of non-Mandarin-speaking taxi drivers, a Cantonese-speaking driver (Leung Kin-ping) finds himself marginalised as {{he fails to}} pass the national Mandarin proficiency test. The driver's wife instructs him to stop using Cantonese with their son, Kongson, so that the boy will do better at his Mandarin medium of instruction school. A series of vignettes further illustrate the increasing dominance of Mandarin and Leung's struggle adjusting. He is unable to make himself understood by his Mandarin GPS unit and is ridiculed by a passenger for it. Two Mandarin-speaking fares opt to take another cab when they realise he cannot speak the language. One of his passengers, an office lady (Catherine Chau), is fired from her job for failing to clearly <b>explain</b> <b>something</b> to a client in Mandarin.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to her linguistic abilities, Genie's nonverbal communication continued to excel. She invented her own system of gestures and pantomimed certain words {{as she said}} them, and also acted out events which she could not express in language. Initially she would only draw pictures if someone asked her to, but during her stay with the Riglers she began to use drawings to communicate if she could not <b>explain</b> <b>something</b> in words. In addition to her own drawings she often used pictures from magazines to relate to daily experiences, and for reasons the scientists never determined especially did so after encountering things that frightened her. Some time during mid-1972 Marilyn observed that a magazine picture of a wolf sent Genie into a terror, after which the Riglers asked Genie's mother if she knew a possible cause for this reaction; she then informed them {{that her husband had}} acted like a dog to intimidate Genie, making the underlying reason for her fear apparent to the scientists for the first time.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to singing {{in an effort}} to <b>explain</b> <b>something</b> to the children, Chef would also sing about things relevant to what had transpired in the plot. These songs were original compositions written by Parker, and performed by Hayes in the same sexually suggestive R style he had utilized during his own music career. The band DVDA, which consists of Parker and Stone, along with show staff members Bruce Howell and D.A. Young, would perform the music for these compositions, and, until the character's death on the show, were listed as [...] "Chef's Band" [...] in the closing credits.|$|E

500|$|William Paden {{argued that}} {{religious}} language uses myth to present truths through stories. He argued that {{to those who}} practice a religion, myths are not mere fiction, but provide religious truths. Paden believed that a myth must <b>explain</b> <b>something</b> {{in the world with}} reference to a sacred being or force, and dismissed any myths which did not as [...] "folktales". Using the example of creation myths, he differentiated myths from scientific hypotheses, the latter of which can be scientifically verified and do not reveal a greater truth; a myth cannot be analysed {{in the same way as}} a scientific theory.|$|E

Upon returning, he asked the manager to stay for a moment, as he wanted to <b>explain</b> <b>something.</b> Following the explosion, Moon turned the recorder back on and said, [...] "That, dear boy, was noise.

2500|$|Many of the {{principles}} of stage magic are old. There is an expression, [...] "it's all done with smoke and mirrors", used to <b>explain</b> <b>something</b> baffling, but effects seldom use mirrors today, due to the amount of installation work and transport difficulties. For example, the famous Pepper's Ghost, a stage illusion first used in 19th-century London, required a specially built theatre. Modern performers have vanished objects as large as the Taj Mahal, the Statue of Liberty, and a space shuttle, using other kinds of optical deceptions.|$|E
2500|$|Mansplaining is a {{blend of}} the word man and the {{informal}} form splaining of the verb explaining and means [...] "to <b>explain</b> <b>something</b> to someone, characteristically by a man to woman, in a manner regarded as condescending or patronizing". Lily Rothman of The Atlantic defines it as [...] "explaining without regard {{to the fact that the}} explainee knows more than the explainer, often done by a man to a woman", and feminist author and essayist Rebecca Solnit ascribes the phenomenon to a combination of [...] "overconfidence and cluelessness".|$|E
2500|$|In Darwin's view, {{anything}} that could be expected to have some adaptive feature could be explained easily with his theory of natural selection. In On the Origin of Species, Darwin wrote that to use natural selection to <b>explain</b> <b>something</b> as complicated as a human eye, [...] "with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration" [...] might at first appear [...] "absurd in the highest possible degree," [...] but nevertheless, if [...] "numerous gradations from a perfect and complex eye to one very imperfect and simple, each grade being useful to its possessor, can be shown to exist", then it seemed quite possible to account for within his theory.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to singing {{in an effort}} to <b>explain</b> <b>something</b> to the children, Chef also sings about things relevant to what has transpired in the plot. These songs were original compositions written by Parker, and performed by Hayes in the same sexually suggestive R style he had utilized during his own music career. Within the show, Chef is the original composer of these songs, including [...] "Stinky Britches", which was depicted as having been covered by Alanis Morissette without proper credit to Chef. When Chef is left with legal debt after losing a court case to have himself credited as the song's original writer, several bands and artists (guest starring as themselves) hold a concert dubbed [...] "Chef Aid", a parody of Live Aid, to raise the funds. The episode inspired a real-life album, , released in 1998, which featured guest stars from the episode such as Elton John and Ozzy Osbourne. The album includes many of the full-length versions of the songs Chef had performed in the show's first two seasons; [...] "Chocolate Salty Balls" [...] was released as a single, and reached #1 in both the record charts of Ireland and the United Kingdom. As the series progressed and Chef's role became more intermittent, his spontaneous outbursts into song became less of a show standard.|$|E
2500|$|Garfield's {{world has}} {{specific}} locations that appear normally on the comic strips, like the Vet's office, {{a place he}} loathes. Irma's Diner is another occasional setting. Irma is a chirpy but slow-witted and unattractive waitress/manager, and one of Jon's few friends. The terrible food {{is the center of}} most of the jokes, along with the poor management. Jon periodically visits his parents and brother on the farm. This results in week-long comical displays of stupidity by Jon and his family, and their interactions. There is a comic strip where Jon's brother Doc Boy is watching two socks in the dryer spinning and Doc Boy calls it entertainment. On the farm, Jon's mother will cook huge dinners; Garfield hugs her for this. Jon has a grandmother who, in a strip, kicked Odie; Garfield subsequently hugged her. Jon's parents have twice visited Jon, Garfield, and Odie in the city. Jon's father drove into town on his tractor (which he double-parked) and brought a rooster to wake him up. As Garfield has a love for food, they will often eat out at restaurants. Most trips end up embarrassing because Garfield will pig out, or Jon will do something stupid, including wearing an ugly shirt, which happened one night when he took Liz on a date. When Jon does take Liz on a date, Garfield occasionally tags along---once, he ate the bread and other food at an Italian restaurant they went to. Frequently, the characters break the fourth wall, mostly to <b>explain</b> <b>something</b> to the readers, talk about a subject that often sets up the strip's punchline (like Jon claiming that pets are good for exercise right before he finds Garfield in the kitchen and chases him out), or give a mere glare when a character is belittled or not impressed. Sometimes, this theme revolves around the conventions of the strip; for example, in one strip, Garfield catches a cold and complains about it, noting, [...] "I can hardy eben understad by own thoughts." ...|$|E
2500|$|Professor James Kugel of Bar-Ilan University {{wrote that}} Gunkel’s {{concept of the}} {{etiological}} tale led 20th century scholars to understand {{the stories of the}} rivalry of Jacob and Esau in [...] and [...] to <b>explain</b> <b>something</b> about the national character (or national stereotype) of Israel and Edom {{at the time of the}} stories’ composition, a kind of projection of later reality back to the [...] "time of the founders." [...] In this etiological reading, that Esau and Jacob were twins explained the close connection between Edom and Israel, their similar dialects, and cultural and kinship ties, while the competition between Esau and Jacob explained the off-and-on enmity between Edom and Israel in the Biblical period. Kugel reported that some biblical scholars saw an analogue in Israelite history: Esau’s descendants, the Edomites, had been a sovereign nation while the future Israel was still in formation (see [...] ), making Edom the [...] "older brother" [...] of Israel. But then, in the 10th century BCE, David unified Israel and conquered Edom (see [...] and [...] ), and that is why the oracle [...] gave Rebekah during her pregnancy said that [...] "the older will end up serving the younger." [...] Kugel reported that scholars thus view the stories of the young Jacob and Esau as created to reflect a political reality that came about in the time of David, indicating that these narratives were first composed in the early 10th century BCE, before the Edomites succeeded in throwing off their Israelite overlords, at that time when Israel might feel [...] "like a little kid who had ended up with a prize that was not legitimately his." [...] When Edom regained its independence, the stolen blessing story underwent a change (or perhaps was created out of whole cloth to reflect Edom’s resurgence). [...] For while Israel still dominated Edom, the story ought to have ended with Isaac’s blessing of Jacob in [...] But Isaac’s blessing of Esau in [...] "By your sword you will live, and you will indeed serve your brother; but then it will happen that you will break loose and throw his yoke from off your neck," [...] reflects a reformulation (or perhaps new creation) of the story in the light of the new reality that developed half a century later.|$|E
50|$|A ratio between object-level and meta-explanation can {{be defined}} as the {{relative}} accuracy of plausibility assessment based on the former and latter sources.
