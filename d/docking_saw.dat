500|$|Lucid's stay aboard Mir {{ended with}} the flight of Atlantis on STS-79, which {{launched}} on 16 September. This, the fourth <b>docking,</b> <b>saw</b> John Blaha transferring onto Mir {{to take his place}} as resident US astronaut. His stay on the station improved operations in several areas, including transfer procedures for a docked space shuttle, [...] "hand-over" [...] procedures for long-duration American crew members and [...] "ham" [...] amateur radio communications, and also saw two spacewalks to reconfigure the station's power grid. Blaha spent four months with the EO-22 crew before returning to Earth aboard Atlantis on STS-81 in January 1997, at which point he was replaced by physician Jerry Linenger. During his flight, Linenger became the first American to conduct a spacewalk from a foreign space station and the first to test the Russian-built Orlan-M spacesuit alongside Russian cosmonaut Vasili Tsibliyev, flying EO-23. All three crew members of EO-23 performed a [...] "fly-around" [...] in Soyuz TM-25 spacecraft. Linenger and his Russian crewmates Vasili Tsibliyev and Aleksandr Lazutkin faced several difficulties during the mission, including the most severe fire aboard an orbiting spacecraft (caused by a malfunctioning Vika), failures of various systems, a near collision with Progress M-33 during a long-distance TORU test and a total loss of station electrical power. The power failure also caused a loss of attitude control, which led to an uncontrolled [...] "tumble" [...] through space.|$|E
5000|$|Although not {{dissimilar}} in {{layout to}} {{other types of}} sawmills, case mills were typically smaller in scale owing to the smaller size of the logs that were milled and the smaller size of the end product. A three-person mill, comprising a single circular saw bench (number one bench) and a <b>docking</b> <b>saw,</b> could produce up to 500 cases per day. Logs were broken down at the number one bench into longitudinal lengths of timber (flitches). The flitches were cut to required length at the <b>docking</b> <b>saw.</b> Waste material from the initial breaking down process (including edging) was cut down for firewood at the <b>docking</b> <b>saw</b> or disposed of. The lengths of timber ready for assembly as cases were known as [...] "shooks".|$|E
50|$|When {{initially}} erected, the Kin Kin mill comprised {{only the}} number one saw bench and a <b>docking</b> <b>saw.</b> Both of these saws are still extant, but the <b>docking</b> <b>saw</b> has been relocated within the shed. The saws were powered by a tractor. Probably from the early 1950s after the mill was connected to electricity, a Canadian Saw, and number two bench were added and the <b>docking</b> <b>saw</b> was moved. The mill layout has remained largely unchanged since then. In its present form it resembles a typical sawmill layout of the 1950s. The original hand operated winch for moving logs through the breakdown saw remains extant and also the early electrical insulators tracing the original path of the cabling along {{the underside of the}} roof.|$|E
50|$|The Argentine submarines, {{also based}} at the naval <b>docks,</b> <b>saw</b> some action too; one of them, the old 'Guppy' class ARA Santa Fe {{was lost in the}} South Georgia Islands. Another one, the Type 209 ARA San Luis harassed the British Task Force for several days.|$|R
50|$|Though {{the steam}} engine and {{transmission}} system {{have now been}} removed, the plan and construction of the mill reveal their former location. Most of the original saws and ancillary equipment are also intact though modified to accommodate electric power. Extant saws include Canadian, frame, number one and pendulum <b>docking</b> <b>saws</b> arranged to allow efficient movement of the logs through the mill.|$|R
60|$|A {{little while}} later Sam and Tom {{set out to}} rejoin Luke Peterson. When they gained the <b>dock</b> they <b>saw</b> nobody.|$|R
50|$|Operating as {{a working}} mill, {{machinery}} and equipment accommodated on the platform includes a framing saw, breakdown saw, number one saw, <b>docking</b> <b>saw,</b> associated benches, trolleys and tracks. Saw sharpening equipment, benches and associated accessories are housed in the saw sharpening room.|$|E
50|$|The sawmill is {{a highly}} intact example of a small sawmill {{originally}} established to produce timber for packaging cases. The layout {{and all of the}} components typically found in a small mill of the 1950s remain including: the characteristic open-sided shed, early electrical insulators tracing the route of the original cabling, breakdown (Canadian) saw, number one and two saw benches, <b>docking</b> <b>saw,</b> original hand operated winch, rails and trolleys. The milling operation continues to follow the traditional packing case sequence of initial cut at the breakdown (Canadian) saw, sizing at the number one and two benches and cut to lengths at the docker.|$|E

5000|$|Most of {{the extant}} saws are {{original}} including the frame, circular break-down, number one and <b>docking</b> <b>saws.</b> The saw sharpening equipment is also original. All of this equipment {{was designed to}} be steam driven via flat belts and pulleys. The original transmission system continued to be used when the shed was first electrified: a large electric motor was simply connected to the main transmission shaft. Later, the transmission system was rendered redundant when the single large electric motor was replaced by smaller electric motors mounted directly onto each saw. As part of this upgrade, the original flat belts and pulley wheels on the saws were replaced by [...] "V" [...] belts and pulleys which transmitted drive directly from the saw mounted motors.|$|R
60|$|Next noon as the S.S. Panama {{pulled out}} of her ice-lined <b>dock</b> Carl <b>saw</b> an old man {{shivering}} on the wharf and frantically waving good-by--Petey McGuff.|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the last}} {{locomotives}} to have served within the dock complex were Birkenhead North TMD's allocation of Class 03 shunters, 03073, 03162, 03170 and 03189 {{all of which have}} been preserved. Indeed, the railways around the <b>docks</b> <b>saw</b> the last mainland use of the class by British Rail, before their withdrawal in March 1989. The last traffic along the line, from Birkenhead North to Rock Ferry, was a Class 08 shunter on 10 May 1993. Subsequently, the line was mothballed by Railtrack. However, the trackwork remains in place and various other railway artefacts are still in existence.|$|R
60|$|It {{was growing}} dusk when the harbor at Rockpoint was reached. At the <b>dock</b> they <b>saw</b> that {{something}} unusual had happened. A crowd of men were gathered about talking earnestly, and pointing up the lake.|$|R
50|$|Shipyards operate {{floating}} dry docks as {{one method}} for hauling or docking vessels. Floating drydocks {{are important in}} locations where porous ground prevents the use of conventional drydocks, such as at the Royal Naval Dockyard on the limestone archipelago of Bermuda. Another advantage of floating dry docks {{is that they can}} be moved to wherever they are needed and can also be sold second-hand. During World War II, the U.S. Navy used such (floating) dry docks extensively to provide maintenance in remote locations. One of these, the 850-foot AFDB-3, an Advance Base Sectional <b>Dock,</b> <b>saw</b> action in Guam, was mothballed near Norfolk, Virginia, and was eventually towed to Portland, Maine, to become part of Bath Iron Works' repair facilities.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{layout of}} the mill has been largely preserved and follows the basic design principles for steam powered sawmills of the era. The break-down saws, comprising a frame saw and large circular saw were designed to make the initial cuts along the logs to create long slices of timber ('flitches'). These saws are located close to where the logs entered the mill near a loading platform {{at the side of}} the shed. The number one and the pendulum <b>docking</b> <b>saws</b> which converted the flitches into boards of the required cross-section and length are located further inside the shed. A small room for sharpening saws is built into a corner of the main shed.|$|R
60|$|When {{at length}} he ceased, {{and the jury}} retired, the breathless stillness continued. With some, indeed, there was the {{relaxation}} of long-strained attention, eyes unbent, and heads turned, but Flora had to pass her arm round her little sister, to steady the child's nervous trembling; Aubrey sat rigid and upright, the throbs of his heart well-nigh audible; and Dr. May leant forward, and covered his eyes with his hand; Tom, who alone dared glance to the <b>dock,</b> <b>saw</b> that Leonard too had retired. Those were the most terrible minutes they had ever spent in their lives; but they were minutes of hope--of hope of relief from a burthen, becoming more intolerable with every second's delay ere the rebound.|$|R

60|$|This {{outrageous}} chase sped across Ludgate Circus, up Ludgate Hill, round St. Paul's Cathedral, along Cheapside, Syme remembering all {{the nightmares}} {{he had ever}} known. Then Syme broke away towards the river, and ended almost down by the <b>docks.</b> He <b>saw</b> the yellow panes of a low, lighted public-house, flung himself into it and ordered beer. It was a foul tavern, sprinkled with foreign sailors, a place where opium might be smoked or knives drawn.|$|R
6000|$|A {{succession}} of Stevenson's friends had visited and {{spent part of}} the [...] day or the evening with him at Armfield's hotel on Sunday, August [...] 20th, each bringing some farewell gift or another (as related by Mr. [...] Gosse in his volume Critical Kitcats, p. 297). Among these, Mr. [...] Henry James's gift had been a case of champagne for consumption [...] during the journey. On {{the morning of the}} 21st I accompanied him to [...] the <b>docks,</b> <b>saw</b> him and his party embarked on board the steamer [...] Ludgate Hill, a vessel sailing from the port of London and carrying [...] animals and freight as well as passengers. They had chosen to go by [...] this route for the sake alike of economy and amusement, rather than [...] by one of the sumptuous liners sailing from Liverpool or Southampton. [...] Leaving the ship's side as she weighed anchor, and waving farewell to [...] the party from the boat which landed me, I little knew what was the [...] truth, that I was looking on the face of my friend for the last time.

5000|$|From {{the opening}} of the ship canal there was a {{temporary}} improvement in trade for the Runcorn docks but a decline set in from the turn of the century. There was a short revival after the First World War but this was not maintained. Improvements were made to Bridgewater Docks in 1935 but this was unsuccessful. By 1950 the docks were [...] "virtually moribund". [...] At Runcorn docks trade declined from 124,428 tons in 1925 to 32,881 tons in 1951, and at Weston Point dock from 200,000 tons in 1938 to 40,000 tons in 1954. [...] The old line of locks from the Bridgewater Canal became disused in the late 1930s, they were closed under the Ship Canal Act of 1949 and filled in. The Ship Canal Act of 1966 allowed the closure of the new line of locks, the old dock area and the Francis and Arnold Docks. The Runcorn and Weston Canal has been filled in to provide additional quay space for modern docks and the old warehouses have been demolished. However, with the building of the Silver Jubilee Bridge in 1961 communications to the docks have been improved and trade has begun to recover again. The dock entrance has been widened and the docks deepened. Trade increased from 50,000 tons in 1957 to 773,000 tons in 1973. In the month of December 2014 the <b>Docks</b> <b>saw</b> 50,126 tons of cargo in trade, the highest monthly tonnage recorded {{in the last quarter of}} a century.|$|R

50|$|The {{substantially}} intact Elgin Vale sawmill is {{an exceptional}} {{example of a}} steam driven softwood sawmill, and is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of its type. Located adjacent to a creek for water and {{in close proximity to}} well timbered areas, the mill is positioned below sloping ground to assist the movement of logs. Internally, the layout and the sequence designed to maximise the efficient movement and cutting of logs within the sawmill remain: the long open-sided tin and timber shed, log ramp, breakdown saw, number one and two <b>saw,</b> frame <b>saw,</b> <b>docking</b> benches, waste chute, rails and trolleys. Below the main floor are the boiler, engine and attached drive equipment that provide the power for the operations on the main floor.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to the game, {{the captains}} from the {{previous}} seasons' team are honored at the annual [...] "Walk of Fame" [...] ceremony {{at the base of}} Denny Chimes. In addition to this ceremony, several other memorable events have occurred as part of the annual A-Day festivities. The 1967 edition of the game <b>saw</b> <b>Dock</b> Rone and Andrew Pernell participate and become the first African American players to play at Denny Stadium as members of the Crimson Tide football team. At halftime of the 1976 game, Denny Stadium was officially rededicated as Bryant-Denny Stadium in honor of then head coach Bear Bryant. The 1985 edition of the A-Day game featured a White team of current, varsity starters against a Crimson team of former Alabama players such as Ken Stabler and Ozzie Newsome.|$|R
500|$|The {{next two}} major attacks {{took place in}} Matawan Creek {{near the town of}} Keyport on Wednesday, July 12. Located 30miles (48km) north of Spring Lake and inland of Raritan Bay, Matawan resembled a Midwestern town rather than an Atlantic beach resort. Matawan's {{location}} made it an unlikely site for shark-human interaction. When Thomas Cottrell, a sea captain and Matawan resident, spotted an 8ft (2.40m) long shark in the creek, the town dismissed him. Around 2:00p.m. local boys, including epileptic Lester Stilwell, 11, were playing in the creek at an area called the Wyckoff <b>dock</b> when they <b>saw</b> what appeared to be an [...] "old black weather-beaten board or a weathered log." [...] A dorsal fin appeared in the water and the boys realized it was a shark. Before Stilwell could climb from the creek, the shark pulled him underwater.|$|R
5|$|In central Bristol, {{where the}} river is tidal, it is {{diverted}} from its original course into the New Cut, a channel dug between 1804 and 1809 {{at a cost of}} £600,000. The original course is held at a constant level by lock gates (designed by Jessop) and is known as the Floating Harbour. The Floating Harbour is protected by an 1870s replacement for Jessop's locks. This unusual dock has a tentacled plan resulting from its origins as the natural river course of the Avon and its tributaries, the River Frome and Siston Brook, and is intimately entwined with Bristol's city centre as few docks are. As a result of this, the Floating Harbour {{is one of the more}} successful pieces of dockland regeneration, with much of the dockside now occupied by residential, office and cultural premises, and the water area heavily used by leisure craft. The Floating Harbour gave the port an advantage by enabling shipping to stay afloat rather than grounding when the tide went down. Downstream of central Bristol the river passes through the deep Avon Gorge, spanned by Brunel's Clifton Suspension Bridge, the river is tidal and is navigable by seagoing vessels at high tide but drying to a steep sided muddy channel at low tide. It was largely the challenge of navigating this section that sealed the fate of the Floating Harbour as commercial <b>docks</b> and <b>saw</b> them replaced by docks at Avonmouth where the Avon joins the Severn Estuary.|$|R
6000|$|It was now near {{six of the}} clock, {{but instead}} of going direct to the Governor's I made my way down Church Street toward the water. Near the <b>dock</b> I <b>saw</b> many people {{gathered}} in {{the street in front}} of the [...] "Ship" [...] tavern, a time-honoured resort much patronized by sailors. My curiosity led me to halt there also. The [...] "Ship" [...] had stood in that place nigh on to three-score years, it was said. Its latticed windows were swung open, and from within came snatches of [...] "Tom Bowling," [...] "Rule Britannia," [...] and many songs scarce fit for a child to hear. Now and anon some one in the street would throw back a taunt to these British sentiments, which went unheeded. [...] "They be drunk as lords," [...] said Weld, the butcher's apprentice, [...] "and when they comes out we'll hev more than one broken head in this street." [...] The songs continuing, he cried again, [...] "Come out, d-n ye." [...] Weld had had more than his own portion of rum that day. Spying me seated on the gate-post opposite, he shouted: [...] "So ho, Master Carvel, the streets are not for his Majesty's supporters to-day." [...] Other artisans who were there bade him leave me in peace, saying that my grandfather was a good friend of the people. The matter might have ended there had I been older and wiser, but the excitement of the day had gone to my head like wine. [...] "I am as stout a patriot as you, Weld," [...] I shouted back, and flushed at the cheering that followed. And Weld ran up to me, and though I was a good piece of a lad, swung me lightly onto his shoulder. [...] "Harkee, Master Richard," [...] he said, [...] "I can get nothing out of the poltroons by shouting. Do you go in and say that Weld will fight any mother's son of them single-handed." ...|$|R

40|$|Tuan plant {{processes}} between six {{and seven}} hundred thousand {{cubic meters of}} plantation pine annually, on average this equates to around five thousand trees daily. Logs are cut to length through a Log Merchandising machine. The numerical data generated by the dimensional measuring system is proposed as feedstock for an ambitious computer program {{that is designed to}} imitate the computerised, electrical and mechanical processes of sawmill plant. Supposition being that a well fashioned predictive software can provide an element of competitive advantage through the potential to aid production planning. The program takes any user specified generic Tuan sawmill alpha-numeric cut pattern code and interrogates into dimensional pattern cross-sections. The software has been fashioned to select the sideboard width option that maximizes sawn volume yield recovery. The board trimming process synthesises laser vision sensing and computer processing to determine the mechanical <b>saw</b> <b>docking</b> requirements; it is the vital final quality control mechanism at the sawmill. Sensed wane dimensions of the timber are paired up against programmed wane rules in the solutions computer to decide which trim saws will actuate and dock to chip. The yield predictor program does a virtual trimmer processing of every sawn board to assess the length output of <b>sawn</b> boards, <b>dock</b> to chip and sawdust exhaust by saws. The program is predicting the sawmill yields for sawn timbers, chip and sawdust, all the yield indicators are reported as displayed outputs. ...|$|R
6000|$|The Colonel's berth {{has been}} duly secured ere now. This time {{he makes the}} {{overland}} journey; and his passage is to Alexandria, taken {{in one of the}} noble ships of the Peninsular and Oriental Company. His kit is as simple as a subaltern's; I believe, but for Clive's friendly compulsion, he would have carried back no other than the old uniform which has served him for so many years. Clive and his father travelled to Southampton together by themselves. F. B. and I took the Southampton coach: we had asked leave to see the last of him, and say a [...] "God bless you" [...] to our dear old friend. So the day came when the vessel was to sail. We saw his cabin, and witnessed all the bustle and stir on board the good ship on a day of departure. Our thoughts, however, were fixed but on one person--the case, no doubt, with hundreds more on such a day. There was many a group of friends closing wistfully together on the sunny deck, and saying the last words of blessing and farewell. The bustle of the ship passes dimly round about them; the hurrying noise of crew and officers running on their duty; the tramp and song of the men at the capstan-bars; the bells ringing, as the hour for departure comes nearer and nearer, as mother and son, father and daughter, husband and wife, hold hands yet for a little while. We saw Clive and his father talking together by the wheel. Then they went below; and a passenger, her husband, asked me to give my arm to an almost fainting lady, and to lead her off the ship. Bayham followed us, carrying their two children in his arms, as the husband turned away and walked aft. The last bell was ringing, and they were crying, [...] "Now for the shore." [...] The whole ship had begun to throb ere this, and its great wheels to beat the water, and the chimneys had flung out their black signals for sailing. We were as yet close on the <b>dock,</b> and we <b>saw</b> Clive coming up from below, looking very pale; the plank was drawn after him as he stepped on land.|$|R
