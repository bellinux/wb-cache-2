2500|$|Larger {{and more}} {{dangerous}} mammalian prey is not infrequently tackled by Eurasian eagle-owl. Nearly thirty species of mammalian carnivores {{have been reported}} in their diet. Many of these are mustelids, which are the smallest type of carnivore but can defend themselves viciously, even the tiny [...] least weasel (Mustela nivalis). Nonetheless, unlike some smaller birds of prey, the Eurasian eagle-owl seems to have no problem subduing various weasels and even martens, some of the latter can nearly equal to their own weight, and will kill the young of much larger species such as European otter (Lutra lutra) and Eurasian badger (Meles meles). However, the single most widely reported carnivore is the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), as they’ve been recorded in the diet from Denmark and Spain to the Russian Far East. Many fox specimens taken by eagle-owls are young individuals or subadults. Some studies posited that the average fox taken as weighing about , about equal to the eagle-owl’s own weight, but another noted fox specimens killed that were estimated to weigh , much larger than the eagle-owls. At least four other species of foxes have been verified as prey in the Middle East and Asia. Raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides), averaging , have been preyed on in Asia as well. Other relatively large carnivores have been hunted as well, including invasive <b>Egyptian</b> <b>mongoose</b> (Herpestes ichneumon) in Spain and masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) in China, both being roughly cat-sized at averages of , respectively. Domestic carnivores including cats (Felis silvestris catus) of all sizes and small dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) or puppies may on occasion become prey for Eurasian eagle-owls. Cats killed have been estimated to weigh from [...] The dogs killed by Bavarian eagle-owls were estimated to average [...] Non-native carnivores such as American mink (Neovison vison) and raccoon (Procyon lotor) have also been preyed on by eagle-owls, which is presumed to incidentally benefit the prey taken in considerably numbers by these rarely checked invasive fur-bearers.|$|E
2500|$|In the Iberian peninsula, the Eurasian eagle-owl {{is part of}} {{a complex}} guild of predators that have evolved to survive mostly on European rabbits. Among this guild, golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) were {{recorded}} per one study to rely on rabbits for 40% of the diet, the eagle-owl for 49% of the diet, the Spanish imperial eagle (Aquila adalberti) for 50% of the diet, the Bonelli's eagle (Aquila fasciata) [...] for 61% of the diet and the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) for 79% of the diet. Elsewhere, the Spanish imperial eagle and eagle-owl are considered to outflank the golden and even the Bonelli’s eagle as the most specialized avian predator of rabbits in the Iberian region. Other predators, such as common buzzard (Buteo buteo), [...] northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) black kite (Milvus migrans) Iberian wildcat (Felis silvestris tartessia), red fox, stone marten (Martes foina) and introduced <b>Egyptian</b> <b>mongoose</b> also prey heavily on rabbits in Spain, but are more generalized and less reliant than the above predators. All these powerful predators do not generally compete directly for food but conflicts may ensue over the rights to territories and nesting sites amongst the birds. Being nocturnal in activity, however, the Eurasian eagle-owl does not tend to compete as directly as do the three eagle species and even these are discreetly segregated by habitat preferences, the goldens preferring open, steep cliffs, the Bonelli's favoring densely vegetated areas mixed with rocky spots and the imperial favoring relatively flat open woodlands. Among these eagles, the golden eagle tends to have the most similar habitat preferences to the Eurasian eagle-owl and across a broad band of overlapping distribution, the two are considered nearly ecological equivalents by day and night. However, good-sized female golden eagles are up to twice as heavy as an average eagle-owl, so seem to have a considerable advantage in size and power. Conversely, to support their large size and large territory needs, the golden eagle cannot survive on small and diverse prey nearly as successfully as the eagle-owl. Among the Iberian peninsula rabbit-eating guild, the species with wider ranges, the eagle-owl and the golden and Bonelli's eagles, have had some degree of success living off of alternate prey following the devastation of the rabbit population due to rabbit haemorrhagic disease. The two rabbit predators endemic to Iberia, the Iberian lynx and Spanish imperial eagle, have been devastated by the reduction and other causes and both are threatened species today.|$|E

40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado al 11 th International Mammalogical Congress, celebrado en Belfast (Irlanda) del 11 al 16 de agosto de 2013. Camera {{trapping}} methods {{provide valuable}} tools for monitoring carnivore communities, but detection rates are usually low due to these species low density. We assessed the detectability of Mediterranean carnivores by camera traps for several attractants in two study areas in Central Spain, analyzing the data with occupancy models. The combination of lynx urine (LU) and valerian extract (VE) provided {{for all the}} carnivore species higher detectability than any of these scents in isolation, increasing detectability between x 2 and x 7, depending on the species. The combination LU+VE produced higher detection probability for red foxes, <b>Egyptian</b> <b>mongooses</b> and Eurasian wildcats than a bait lure (raw chicken). However, raw chicken yielded a higher detectability for stone martens, common genets and Eurasian badgers.

40|$|Nocturnal and siesta resting {{ecology and}} {{behaviour}} of 24 <b>Egyptian</b> <b>mongooses</b> were studied. Mongooses mainly used underground dens (rabbit warrens and badger setts) and thickets in both periods. Tree hollows were occasionally used. Twenty-one individuals used 338 different nocturnal resting sites on 672 occasions. Mean number of resting sites per individual was 16. 1, though resting sites used by each individual increased when sample size did. Mean re-use rate was 1. 99 nights/site. The majority of nocturnal resting sites were only used once, {{and very few}} more than five times. Nocturnal resting sites used two or more times were significantly more often inside than outside home range core areas, whereas resting sites used once were significantly more often outside than inside. Mean distance between consecutive nocturnal resting sites was different among classes of individuals, and annual variations were detected. Eighteen mongooses used 133 different resting sites on 171 occasions during siesta periods. Mean number of different sites used and re-use rate were 7. 4 and 1. 29, respectively. Types of resting sites used during siesta periods changed throughout the year with underground dens predominating in summer. Re-use rates remained constant for the whole year.

40|$|High nest {{predation}} {{is one of}} {{the factors}} potentially driving farmland bird declines, particularly in the case of ground-nesting species. Accordingly, recent calls have been made to address predation in agri-environment schemes, but this is hindered by limited understanding of how processes operating at different scales affect predation patterns and how additional factors such as livestock trampling contribute to reduced nest survival. Using an artificial nest experiment, we assessed how field management, landscape composition and configuration, and the abundance of potential avian predators and mammalian carnivores affected predation and trampling rates in grassland fields (pastures and fallows) embedded in intensive Mediterranean farmland. Mean predation and trampling rates per field were 0. 18 ± 0. 23 SD and 0. 12 ± 0. 17 SD, respectively. However, there was strong spatial variation, with high nest losses (> 50 %) occurring in about one quarter of the fields. Variation in failure rates was mainly related to livestock grazing and predator abundances, while the effects of landscape context were negligible. Predation and trampling rates were highest in fields with short swards. Predation rate was positively related to the abundance of <b>Egyptian</b> <b>mongooses</b> and dogs. To increase nest survival, agri-environment schemes designed for ground-nesting birds should contribute for maintaining low stocking density. Further evaluation is required on the need for controlling populations of fastexpanding generalist predators such as mongooses...|$|R

40|$|Top predators {{have often}} been persecuted because of their {{supposed}} negative effects on species of economic concern on which they feed. In some cases, however, they may actually benefit their prey through intraguild predation on other smaller predators that share the prey. In each of two representative situations, in one of which lynx were present {{and in the other}} absent, we (1) estimated gross number of rabbits taken by lynx and <b>Egyptian</b> <b>mongooses</b> (smaller predators that are themselves preyed upon by lynx; (2) simulated size-structured rabbit populations of different densities, taking into account the reproductive value of the individuals taken by predators; and (3) estimated actual rabbit densities. Numbers of rabbits taken by predators during a year were found to be between 4. 8 and 9. 5 times greater when lynx were not present. After a year, rabbit population growth for an initial rabbit density of 15 /ha was between 12 % and 22 % lower when lynx were not present. For lower initial rabbit densities, the positive effect of lynx presence on rabbits was greater. Actual rabbit densities in the areas used by lynx were 2 – 4 times higher than in areas not used by lynx, even though these areas were similar or identical in habitat composition.

40|$|A {{survey to}} {{determine}} the occurrence of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) in wild carnivores in Portugal was conducted by testing samples from road-killed animals between 2009 and 2012. Postmortem examinations were performed and tissues were collected from wild carnivores representing four families and six different species, {{with a total of}} 74 animals analyzed. Cultures were performed by using Löwenstein-Jensen and Middlebrook 7 H 11 solid media and acid-fast isolates were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and mycobactin dependency characteristics. Tissues were also screened for MAP by directly extracting DNA and testing for the MAP-specific sequences. The occurrence of infected animals (an animal had at least one tissue that was positive for culture or direct PCR) was 27. 0 % (n = 20). MAP was isolated from culture of 25 tissue samples (3. 8 %) and was detected by direct PCR in 40 (6. 0 %) samples.
