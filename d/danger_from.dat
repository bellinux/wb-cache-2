5|$|Saint-Saëns gave what he {{intended}} to be his farewell concert as a pianist in Paris in 1913, but his retirement was soon in abeyance {{as a result of}} the war, during which he gave many performances in France and elsewhere, raising money for war charities.

5|$|Because {{of their}} large numbers, many seamounts {{remain to be}} {{properly}} studied, and even mapped. Bathymetry and satellite altimetry are two technologies working to close the gap. There have been instances where naval vessels have collided with uncharted seamounts; for example, Muirfield Seamount is named after the ship that struck it in 1973. However, the greatest <b>danger</b> <b>from</b> seamounts are flank collapses; as they get older, extrusions seeping in the seamounts put pressure on their sides, causing landslides that {{have the potential to}} generate massive tsunamis.|$|E

5|$|In September 1985, as {{earthquakes}} and phreatic eruptions rocked the area, local officials began planning for an evacuation.

5|$|In {{the closing}} days of World War I, the Conference of Ambassadors drew the first {{demarcation}} line between Poland and Lithuania on June 18, 1919.

These attacks coincided with {{the signing of the}} Treaty of Versailles on June 28, which eliminated any <b>danger</b> <b>from</b> Germany.

He sells the carpet to antique dealer George Jones (Wheeler Oakman) to fund the robbery scheme. But the theft places both men and Fortune Chedsoye (Kathlyn Williams), the innocent daughter of another conspirator, in <b>danger</b> <b>from</b> the carpet's guardian.|$|E

5|$|The alpine pika can emit three {{different}} vocalizations. The long call is heard during the mating season from only the subspecies O. a. alpina, O. a. changaica, and O. a. nitida. The short call is a harsh, sharp whistle that is easily distinguishable from the short high-pitched whistle {{of the northern}} pika. The alarm call is given out immediately any <b>danger</b> <b>from</b> predators or humans is perceived, and can travel greater distances than the calls of most other pika species.|$|E

Emperor of India was in dock for a refit in late May 1916, so she was unavailable for the Battle of Jutland. The increased <b>danger</b> <b>from</b> submarines led both the Grand Fleet and the German High Seas Fleet to pursue more cautious strategies after Jutland, {{which led to a}} less eventful war.|$|E
5|$|Adult giant otters {{living in}} family groups have no known serious natural predators, however {{there are some}} {{accounts}} of black caimans in Peru and yacare caimans in the Pantanal preying on giant otters. In addition, solitary animals and young may be vulnerable to attacks by the jaguar, cougar, and anaconda, but {{this is based on}} historical reports, not direct observation. Pups are more vulnerable, and may be taken by caiman and other large predators, although adults are constantly mindful of stray young, and will harass and fight off possible predators. When in the water, the giant otter faces <b>danger</b> <b>from</b> animals not strictly preying upon it: the electric eel and stingray are potentially deadly if stumbled upon, and piranha may be capable of at least taking bites out of a giant otter, as evidenced by scarring on individuals.|$|E

5|$|Americans' mistrust and {{dislike of}} lawyers was a {{frequent}} topic of dissection in social problem films such Lawyer Man (1933), State's Attorney, and The Mouthpiece (1932). In films such as Paid (1930), the legal system turns innocent characters into criminals. The life of Joan Crawford's character is ruined and her romantic interest is executed so that she may live free, although she is innocent of the crime for which the district attorney wants to convict her. Religious hypocrisy was addressed in such films as The Miracle Woman (1931), starring Barbara Stanwyck and directed by Frank Capra. Stanwyck also portrayed a nurse and initially reluctant heroine who manages to save, via unorthodox means, two young children in <b>danger</b> <b>from</b> nefarious characters (including Clark Gable as a malevolent chauffeur) in Night Nurse (1931).|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} {{proved that}} the fault lay {{in the construction of}} the bomb's tail; breaking up on impact, a 'safed' bomb would have its arming wire removed, rendering it 'unsafe' and detonating the weapon. Modifications were made to solve the problem, but the damage had been done; the safety issues, increased maintenance costs compared to conventional bombs, the fact that the bomb's guidance system required clear-day use only, rendering the bombers vulnerable to enemy fighters, and required that the weapon be released at a prime altitude for the aircraft to be in <b>danger</b> <b>from</b> enemy flak. These combined with the weapon's poor reliability – only six of twenty-eight bombs dropped successfully destroyed their targets – to result in the production order being canceled by the USAF; following this, the Tarzon program as a whole was terminated in August 1951.|$|E
5|$|Fairley {{returned}} to the Australian Army during the Second World War as Director of Medicine. He {{played an important role}} in the planning for the Battle of Greece, convincing the British Commander-in-Chief, General Sir Archibald Wavell to alter his campaign plan to reduce the <b>danger</b> <b>from</b> malaria. In the South West Pacific Area, Fairley became responsible for co-ordinating the activities of all allied forces in the fight against malaria and other tropical diseases. Fairley again sounded the alarm on the dangers of malaria, persuading authorities in the United States and United Kingdom to greatly step up production of anti-malarial drugs. Through the activities of the LHQ Medical Research Unit, he fast-tracked research into new drugs. Fairley convinced the Army of the efficacy of the new drug atebrin, and persuaded commanders to adopt a tough approach to administering the drug to the troops.|$|E
