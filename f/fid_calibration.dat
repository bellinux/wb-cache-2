5000|$|This is {{different}} from a typical <b>FID</b> <b>calibration</b> where this calibration {{would need to be}} completed for every single different compound to account for the relative response differences. The calibration should be examined periodically to certify nothing has changed in the GC over time.|$|E
40|$|Analytical {{techniques}} {{applicable to}} the assay and remediation of cutting/mud matrices have been developed, utilising soxhlet extraction with dichloromethane and a drying agent followed by analysis using Gas Chromatography (<b>FID).</b> <b>Calibration</b> curves of oil content were produced for Novatec and Versaplus coated cuttings that were also sized by wet and dry sieving techniques, demonstrating their variable nature. The oil in each size fraction was assessed and showed that the finer fractions preferentially adsorbed the oil. Bacteria were isolated from the cuttings, muds and the pure oils {{to see if any}} indigenous species could, with optimum conditions, remediate the oil they contained. The resulting isolates were batch-tested in the laboratory in a minimal medium, with the drill cuttings providing the sole carbon source. Each isolate was scored for remediation performance, with reduction in oil varying from 50 % to 6 % within one week. Subsequently three bacteria (A,D & J) were identified using 16 SrRNA sequencing; they were Bacillus Thuringiensls (A&D) and a novel species related to Bacillus oleronius. These were then tested slurry-phase in a rotating drum bioreactor designed and fabricated for the research against a known remediator, Rhodococcus 9737, and a non-inoculated control for four weeks. All the reactors remediated, but Rhodococcus 9737 reduced the oil to 35 % of the original, A, D and other isolates as a consortium to 83 % and J, 90 %. Further tests in the bioreactors, after a modification to improve the air supply gave reductions of around 50 % after four weeks. The high clay content of the cuttings was detrimental to significant levels of bioremediation in a slurry-phase bioreactor. Manures were added to the drill cuttings and tested in the bioreactors as a solid-phase system. These degraded the cuttings oil to 2 % (v/v), a 96 % reduction. Composting was thus more applicable for a high clay content drilling waste bioremediation system...|$|E
50|$|A PEMS {{also has}} to be practical. Installation time and the {{expertise}} level required to perform installation and to operate the PEMS will {{have a significant impact}} on the cost of the test, and on the number of vehicles tested. Versatility (ability to test different vehicles) may be important if testing dissimilar engines or vehicles. Total size, weight and transportability of the PEMS needs to be considered when testing at different locations, including any consumables such as calibration gases. Any restrictions on transport of hazardous materials (i.e.Flame ionization detector (<b>FID)</b> fuel or <b>calibration</b> gases) need to be taken into the account. The ability of the test crew to repair PEMS in the field using locally available resources can also be essential when testing away from the base.Thus, PEMS evaluation protocol should be expanded. In addition to the laboratory comparison testing, which is a measure of how accurately PEMS measures when operated in a laboratory, the accuracy and repeatability of PEMS should also be examined on the road, possibly while driving along a well-defined, repeatable route, or while driving chassis dynamometer cycles on a test track.|$|R
