50|$|A <b>debris</b> <b>cone</b> is {{commonly}} made when rock from a high-up narrow slit or gorge {{falls into a}} ﬂat-ﬂoored valley. Here the soil and loose materials are deposited, leaving a mound of conical shape. While an alluvial fan is formed when ﬂowing water rushes rock and soil down a slope, <b>debris</b> <b>cones</b> come from one of several dry processes known as mass wasting. That is gravity pulling loose materials downslope. Such mounds can reach sizes large enough to obstruct river channels. Similar deposits {{can also be found}} lying on boulders moved by a landslide, or on a glacier, where a cone-shaped mound of ice or snow may be covered with a veneer of debris thick enough to prevent the underlying ice from melting. A <b>debris</b> <b>cone</b> is also called a dirt cone or cone of detritus.|$|R
40|$|Cluster {{analysis}} of 245 vegetation plots, along 17 transects on alpine composite <b>debris</b> <b>cones</b> in the Italian Alps, {{allowed us to}} classify complex mosaics of landforms and plant communities. A variety of active and past geomorphic processes (mass wasting, avalanche activity, and running water) {{were responsible for the}} construction of the <b>debris</b> <b>cones.</b> By assessing plant community distribution {{in the context of the}} different landform units and geomorphic processes, represented in detailed geomorphological maps, a sequence of landform–vegetation units was identified. This approach contributes to the assessment of environmental hazards on the cones, and may also be applied in other environmental contexts. Plant community distribution and development inValle dell'Avio reflects the frequency and intensity of the processes that built composite alpine <b>debris</b> <b>cones,</b> creating environmental gradients and/or generating new habitats. Therefore this patchy landscape allows the preservation of local biodiversity, with typical plant communities adapted to particular niches...|$|R

40|$|Alluvial fans, <b>debris</b> <b>cones</b> and {{rockfall}} talus cones are {{widespread in}} upland Britain, but remarkably {{little is known}} about their characteristics, development and significance. This research project has three main objectives: 1. to establish the morphological and surface sedimentary characteristics of alluvial fans, <b>debris</b> <b>cones</b> and talus cones in the Grampian Highlands of Scotland; 2. to identify the factors that have controlled their formation and distribution; and 3. to determine the timing, nature and rate of fan- and cone-forming processes. On the basis of previous literature, an Orioni model that describes a continuum of fan and cone morphological and surface sedimentary properties was devised. The applicability of this model was tested using data for six variables (long profile gradient, slope form, downslope changes in clast size, roundness and form, and a scale ratio of maximum clast size to total fan or cone length) obtained for fans and cones in the Grampian Highlands and the Lyngen Peninsula in Northern Norway. The results of these tests were then used to produce a modified model appropriate to fans and cones in upland Britain. Using a combination of map, field and aerial photograph data, several environmental and morphometric controls on the distribution and type of fan and cone development were investigated. The dimensions of different types of fan and cone are shown to be determined by basin morphometry, lithology and glacial history. Discriminant analysis identified basin gradient, basin width and basin height as the principal catchment properties that influence the dominant type of fan- or cone-forming process. Stratigraphic and radiocarbon evidence suggests that many <b>debris</b> <b>cones</b> are essentially paraglacial landforms that formed in the earlier part of the Flandrian. Many of these cones have subsequently been modified in the late Flandrian by fluvial processes, in some cases in response to anthropogenic interference. However, evidence from one site has also revealed that substantial <b>debris</b> <b>cone</b> aggradation has occurred since c 300 BP, implying high rates of denudation in the recent past at this site. The volumes of other <b>debris</b> <b>cones</b> imply that as much as 1 - 3 m of surface lowering has occurred in gullies upslope since deglaciation. Much lower values of surface lowering are associated with alluvial fan development, suggesting that, locally at least, denudation by fluvial processes has been less significant than denudation resulting from debris flow...|$|R

40|$|Mountain <b>debris</b> <b>cones</b> in the Alpine region {{often provide}} space for dense {{population}} and cultivation. Hence, {{a great number}} of buildings are exposed to torrential hazards. In order to protect the settlement areas against flooding and overbank sedimentation, torrent defence structures are implemented at various locations within catchments. Directly at the <b>debris</b> <b>cones,</b> these protection measures often include a deposition basin at the fan apex and/or a confined channel that passes through the settlement. The work presented within this paper deals with the effect of specific outlet structure layouts, situated {{at the lower end of}} a selected deposition basin, on bed-load transport processes and flood protection. A case study analysis was accomplished comprising a 3 -D numerical model (FLOW- 3 D) and a physical scale model test (1 : 30). The subject of investigation was the deposition basin of the Larsennbach torrent in the Austrian Northern Limestone Alps. The basin is situated on a large <b>debris</b> <b>cone</b> and opens out into a paved channel. Since the basin is undersized and the accumulation of sediment in the outlet section reduces the available cross section during floods, adjoining settlements are considerably endangered of lateral overtopping of both clear water and sediment. Aiming for an upgrade in flood protection, certain layouts for a "closing-off structure" at the outlet were tested within this project. For the most efficient design layout, its effect on flood protection, a continuous bed-load output from the basin and the best possible use of the retention volume are pointed out. The simple design of the structure and the key aspects that have to be taken into consideration for implementation are highlighted...|$|R

The internal honeycomb damage was determined {{as a function of}} the impactor parameters. The ballistic limit data showed a strong dependence with impact angle. The internal honeycomb damage was found to be independent of impact angle for constant impact energy for Theta< 50 degrees. An empirically-determined damage equation linking honeycomb damage to impact energy was developed. For the highest impact energy perforating impacts, the <b>debris</b> <b>cone</b> angles for the primary and secondary <b>debris</b> <b>cones</b> were determined. As the impact angle increased, the centre of the damage cones rotated away from the line of flight.

40|$|Rockfalls and rockslides {{during the}} past 12 000 years have {{deposited}} bouldery <b>debris</b> <b>cones</b> on the seafloor beneath massive rock slopes throughout the inner part of Knight Inlet. The 885 m high rock slope, located across from a former First Nations village destroyed in the late 1500 s by a slide-induced wave, exposes the contact between a Late Cretaceous dioritic pluton and metamorphic rocks of the Upper Triassic Karmutsen Formation. The pluton margin is strongly foliated parallel to primary and secondary fabrics in the metamorphic rocks, resulting in highly persistent brittle structures. Other important structures include a set of sheeting joints and highly persistent mafic dykes and faults. Stability analysis indicates that planar and wedge rock slope failures up to about 500 000 m 3 in volume could occur. We suspect that failures of this size in this setting would {{have the potential to}} generate locally hazardous waves. As several similar rock slopes fronted by large submarine <b>debris</b> <b>cones</b> exist in the inner part of Knight Inlet, it is clear that tsunami hazards should be considered in coastal infrastructure development and land-use planning in this area...|$|R

Both rod and <b>cone</b> <b>channels</b> were blocked by tetramethyl- through tetrapentylammonium from the intracellular side in a voltage-dependent fashion at millimolar to micromolar concentrations. The dissociation constant at 0 mV (KD(O)) decreased monotonically with increasing carbon chain length from approximately 80 mM (TMA) to approximately 80 microM (TPeA), where the dissociation constant in rod channels is approximately 50 % that of <b>cone</b> <b>channels.</b> N-Methyl-D-glucamine and the buffer Tris also blocked the <b>cone</b> <b>channel</b> in a voltage-dependent fashion at millimolar concentrations, but with lower affinity than similarly sized tetraalkylammonium blockers. Block by tetrahexylammonium (THxA) was voltage-independent, suggesting that the diameter of the intracellular mouth of these channels is less than the size of THxA but larger than TPeA. The location of the binding site for intracellular blockers was approximately 40 % across the voltage-drop from the intracellular side. The addition of one carbon to each of the alkyl side chains increased the binding energy by approximately 4 kJ mol- 1, consistent with hydrophobic interactions between the blocker and the pore. Cone, but not rod, channels were blocked by millimolar concentrations of extracellular TMA. The location of the extracellular binding site was approximately 13 % of the voltage drop from the extracellular side.

[Full text {{of this article is}} not available in the UHRA]This research assesses the morphological consequences of recent (post-???Little Ice Age???) paraglacial reworking of valley-side sediment mantles in the European Alps. It aims to identify the extent and conditioning factors of slope adjustment at sites in the Swiss Alps, model the temporal pattern, and assess the rates of sediment reworking involved. Gully systems have cut into steep, high-level lateral moraines, and <b>debris</b> <b>cones</b> have accumulated downslope. Debris flow is the dominant agent of sediment transfer. Factors controlling the extent of this activity include moraine slope gradient, relief and moisture availability. Gullies appear to have reached their maximum dimensions within ca. 50 ???yr of deglaciation, after which gully relief is reduced by removal of inter-gully slopes and gully infilling (within 80 ??? 140 ???yr). On the most recently deglaciated terrain, minimum erosion rates average ca. 95 ???mm???yr??? 1 since gully initiation, greatly exceeding ???normal??? erosion rates in other environments.

40|$|Periglacial landscapes are {{characteristic}} for high latitudes or high elevations. Ice caves are environments where permafrost and periglacial conditions exist in milder climates due to specific microclimatic setting. Surface air is entering the cave only when its temperature drops below the cave air temperature. This {{results in a}} formation of cold air pool, which sustains a periglacial environment, permafrost and ice. Ice caves in karst can also contain a variety of sediments that were transported in a cave during its formation. These sediments can be subject to freeze-thaw cycles due to temperature fluctuations and form periglacial features. Ledena jama pod Hrušico cave is situated on the Hrušica plateau on the elevation of about 800 m. It consists of spacious 20 m deep shaft, <b>debris</b> <b>cone</b> and two small passages. The ice is still present in the <b>debris</b> <b>cone</b> and is quickly disappearing. One of the passages contains silty sediments, which are mixed with limestone debris. Sorted stripes are present on an inclined slope of this passage. Cave environment is less influenced by different subaerial processes thus cave environments are very suitable for controlled observations. Seven air temperature loggers were installed in order to monitor cave climate and identify processes responsible for periglacial conditions. Furthermore, we installed 12 soil temperature sensors {{in different parts of}} pattern ground to analyse the processes that lead to ground sorting. Ground movements and sorting are monitored with repeated photogrammetry. Results will help us to better understand dynamic responsible for ground sorting and soil movement processes in periglacial environments...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: Investigations of a {{sedimentary}} sequence {{exposed in}} the distal margin {{of a small}} <b>debris</b> <b>cone</b> in the valley of Pasture Beck, eastern Lake District, have yielded detailed information concerning the time and nature of cone aggradation phases and the local vegetation and land-use history. Radiocarbon dates from two buried peat beds indicate that the cone surface was generally stable from the late 8 th to the early 13 th centuries AD (1165 - 736 cal. BP). An interlude of colluvial gravel deposition interrupted peat accumulation and was probably {{the result of a}} single short-lived event. Gravel-dominated beds represent deposition of reworked rockfall debris and glacial drift by cohesionless debris flows, whereas finer-grain beds are probably the result of sheet-flows derived by washout of fines from debris-flow deposits. The stratigraphic evidence indicates that the minerogenic sediments accumulated in quick succession. Pollen and charcoal data from peat samples reveal intensification of land-use before burial of the peats by minerogenic sediments. It is proposed that landscape instability was associated first with Norse-Irish settlement and woodland clearance, and later, probably, to the expansion of upland pastures and more intensive grazing in the 13 th century AD. When the Pasture Beck data is considered along with information from elsewhere in the British Isles, it is apparent that not all patterns of Late Holocene landscape change in upland areas can be ascribed to a single cause. <b>Debris</b> <b>cones</b> (colluvial fans) are conspicuous and significant landscape features in upland areas of the British Isles (Brazier et al. 1988; Brazier & Ballantyne 1989; Harvey 1996; Chiver...|$|R

40|$|This study aims at {{understanding}} the spatial distribution {{and characteristics of}} the frozen and unfrozen terrain in an alluvial fan on Deception Island, which is an active strato-volcano located in the Bransfield Strait (South Shetland Islands) with recent eruptions in 1967, 1969 and 1970. The alluvial fan is dominated by debris-flow, run-off and rock fall processes and permafrost occurs in several parts {{in the vicinity of}} anomalous geothermal heat flux. The aim is to assess the ways volcanic activity controls permafrost development and associated geomorphic dynamics using shallow subsurface, surface and air temperature measurements as well as thaw depth and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) surveys. Results show a temperature increase with depth in {{the lower part of the}} fan reaching 13 °C at 0. 80 m depth, without the presence of permafrost. The shallow borehole located at this site showed a stable thermal stratification all year-round, with only the upper 0. 20 m reacting to meteorological forcing. In the upper part of the alluvial fan and <b>debris</b> <b>cones,</b> c. 100 m from the coast, frozen ground is present at c. 0. 70 m depth. There, the shallow borehole shows a good coupling with air temperatures and the thermal regime favours the presence of permafrost. ERT shows the lowest resistivity values in the lower part of the alluvial fan and a highly resistivity zone in the upper sector of the fan and in the <b>debris</b> <b>cones.</b> These large variations in resistivity mark the presence of a saline water wedge from the sea into the fan, reaching frozen ground conditions about 100 m inland.

In contrast, mountain beech and high altitude silver beech forests supported lower proportions of highly preferred food species and were poor deer habitat.

The Wapiti/Doon catchments contained a greater abundance of more stable landforms than the Glaisnock and therefore provided poorer deer habitat in the predominant mountain beech forests...|$|R

Numerous instances of cloud bursts or concentrated rain fall is commonly reported in this valley, which often results landslides and consequent transportation of huge quantum of debris down the slope. These debris materials, deposited {{by the side of}} the river course forming <b>cones</b> of <b>debris.</b> It is a striking factor that successive <b>cones</b> of <b>debris</b> are seen throughout the valley by the side of Lachung river course. The width of the <b>debris</b> <b>cones</b> are more on the right bank as compared to the left bank. This has resulted in a continuous presence of debris materials on both sides of the river course with rocks exposed much away from the river in the entire length of the basin Lachung. Major settlements are situated on these <b>debris</b> <b>cones</b> which are very prone to mass movements during the rainfall. Lachung valley is drained by the river Lachung Chu which is a major tributary of the Teesta river. A number of hydroelectric power plants are in construction phase in the Lachung and Teesta basin (just downstream to Lachung basin). In view of the existing settlements, infrastructures and upcoming infrastructures in the region, landslide hazard zonation is a necessity. In this paper, fuzzy logic technique was used to integrate the causative factors of landslide. Fuzzy membership values were derived from landslide frequency ratio. The frequency ratio is a ratio between the occurrence and absence of landslides in each cell/class of causative factors (Lee and Sambath 2006). A fuzzy membership value has a range (0, 1), where 0 is for the minimum fuzzy relation and 1 is for maximum. A membership value between 0 and 1 indicate the degree of fuzzy relationship. Fuzzy gamma operator was selected for the integration of factors using five different gamma values. ROC curves were prepared to validate the resulting maps.|$|R
