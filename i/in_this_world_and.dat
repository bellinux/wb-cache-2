5|$|One {{common goal}} of early Daoism was to extend life by {{achieving}} immortality. The Celestial Masters believed {{that in order}} to achieve immortality, one was not supposed to extend life in the current world, but rather 'feign death' <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>world,</b> <b>and</b> be reborn on the other side. In order to feign death, an adept had to have perfectly harmonized internal spirits. When someone with refined internal spirits died in this world, their spirit would venture to the Palace of Grand Darkness where their form would be refined and then reborn in a perfected state on the other side. There are no surviving texts that describe what kind of place the 'other side' was. Those that failed to harmonize their internal spirits prior to death would be reborn in the underground earth-prisons, where they would be subject to eternal torment and toil.|$|E

25|$|Oceans {{contain the}} {{greatest}} quantity of actively cycled carbon <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> are {{second only to}} the lithosphere in the amount of carbon they store. The oceans' surface layer holds large amounts of dissolved inorganic carbon that is exchanged rapidly with the atmosphere. The deep layer's concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is about 15% higher than that of the surface layer. DIC is stored in the deep layer for much longer periods of time. Thermohaline circulation exchanges carbon between these two layers.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the concern}} of some Torah {{scholars}} that misunderstanding these passages as literal descriptions of God's image might lead to blasphemy or idolatry, there was great opposition to studying this topic without the proper initiation. Jewish biblical commentaries emphasize that the imagery of the merkabah {{is not meant to}} be taken literally; rather the chariot and its accompanying angels are analogies for the various ways that God reveals himself in this world. Hasidic philosophy and kabbalah discuss at length what each aspect of this vision represents <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>world,</b> <b>and</b> how the vision does not imply that God is made up of these forms.|$|E
25|$|The {{emphasis}} which Islam places {{upon the}} feminine/masculine polarity (and therefore complementarity) results, quite logically, in {{a separation of}} social functions. In general, a woman's sphere of operation is the home in which she is the dominant figureand a man's corresponding sphere is the outside world. However, this separation is not, in practice, as rigid as it appears. There are many examplesboth in {{the early history of}} Islam and in the contemporary worldof Muslim women who have played prominent roles in public life, including being sultanas, queens, elected heads of state and wealthy businesswomen Moreover, it is important to recognise that in Islam, home and family are firmly situated at the centre of life <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> of society: a man's work cannot take precedence over the private realm.|$|E

25|$|Muslims regard Fatimah as {{a loving}} and devoted daughter, mother, wife, a sincere Muslim, and an exemplar for women. It is {{believed}} {{that she was very}} close to her father and her distinction from other women is mentioned in many hadith. After Khadijah, Muslims regard Fatimah as the most significant historical figure, considered to be the leader (Arabic: Sayyidih) of all women <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> in Paradise. It is because of her moral purity that she occupies an analogous position in Islam to that Mary occupies in Catholic Christianity. She was the first wife of Ali, whom Sunnis consider the fourth Rashidun caliph and the first infallible Imam (Shi'a doctrine), the mother of the second and third Imams, and the ancestor of all the succeeding Imams; indeed, the Fatimid Caliphate is named after her.|$|E
25|$|According to Ibn Arabi, Islam is {{the best}} {{religion}} because of Muhammad. Ibn Arabi regards that the first entity that was brought into existence is the reality or essence of Muhammad (al-ḥaqīqa al-Muhammadiyya). Ibn Arabi regards Muhammad as the supreme human being and master of all creatures. Muhammad is therefore the primary role-model for human beings to aspire to emulate. Ibn Arabi believes that God's attributes and names are manifested <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> that the most complete and perfect display of these divine attributes and names are seen in Muhammad. Ibn Arabi believes that one may see God in the mirror of Muhammad, meaning that the divine attributes of God are manifested through Muhammad. Ibn Arabi maintains that Muhammad {{is the best}} proof of God and by knowing Muhammad one knows God. Ibn Arabi also maintains that Muhammad is the master of all of humanity in both this world and the afterlife. In this view, Islam is the best religion, because Muhammad is Islam.|$|E
25|$|I {{was saved}} {{from the gas}} chambers, saved from Hitler. I spent several years in Nazi death camps. Besides {{the fact that they}} murdered my wife and 11 children, my mother, my sisters and my brother – of my whole family, some 150 people, I {{was the only one who}} survived – I {{witnessed}} their cruelty. I remember as if it were today how they shot me in the arm. I was afraid to go to the Nazi infirmary, though there were doctors there. I knew that if I went in, I'd never come out alive. … Despite my fear of the Nazis, I plucked a leaf from a tree and stuck it to my wound to stanch the bleeding. Then I cut a branch and tied it around the wound to hold it in place. With God's help, it healed in three days. Then I promised myself that if, with God's help, I got well and got out of there, away from those resha'im (wicked people), I would build a hospital in Eretz Yisrael where every human being would be cared for with dignity. And the basis of that hospital would be that the doctors and nurses would believe that there is a God <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> that when they treat a patient, they are fulfilling the greatest mitzvah in the Torah.|$|E

500|$|The {{major themes}} of Spirited Away {{center on the}} protagonist Chihiro and her liminal journey through the realm of spirits. The archetypal {{entrance}} into another world demarcates Chihiro's status as one somewhere between child and adult. Chihiro also stands outside societal boundaries in the supernatural setting. The {{use of the word}} kamikakushi (literally [...] "hidden by gods") within the Japanese title, and its associated folklore, reinforces this liminal passage: [...] "Kamikakushi is a verdict of 'social death' <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>world,</b> <b>and</b> coming back to this world from Kamikakushi meant 'social resurrection.'" ...|$|E

He completely rejects the notion that loving his son means he must quietly and willingly accept it when the boy does not give his best effort in school, and famously threatened him with the often quoted line, [...] "I brought you <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>world,</b> <b>and</b> I'll take you out."

500|$|The Bahá'í {{writings}} {{state that}} human beings have a [...] "rational soul", and that this provides the species with a unique capacity to recognize God's status and humanity's relationship with its creator. Every human is seen to {{have a duty to}} recognize God through his messengers, and to conform to their teachings. Through recognition and obedience, service to humanity and regular prayer and spiritual practice, the Bahá'í writings state that the soul becomes closer to God, the spiritual ideal in Bahá'í belief. When a human dies, the soul passes into the next world, where its spiritual development in the physical world becomes a basis for judgment and advancement in the spiritual world. Heaven and Hell are taught to be spiritual states of nearness or distance from God that describe relationships <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> the next, and not physical places of reward and punishment achieved after death.|$|E
500|$|For the {{purposes}} of this category, [...] "religion" [...] was seen to mean a faith in a higher power, and does not include ethical principles or rationalism, as in Bowman v Secular Society. The 2006 Act expanded this, noting that religion [...] "includes.. a religion which does not involve belief in a god". This extends to the support of religious buildings and sick or old members of the clergy, as in Re Forster. This category also covers groups with small followings, as in Re Watson, and with doubtful theology, as in Thornton v Howe. Curiously, and individually to religious charities, the public benefit requirement is justified by the assumption that, according to Cross J in Neville Estates v Madden, [...] "some benefit accrues to the public from attendance at places of worship of persons who live <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> mix with their fellow citizens". Notably, this excludes gifts to groups which do not associate with the public, as in Gilmour v Coats.|$|E

Back on the farm, Maggie confronts Lori about being almost killed due to her request, and tells Glenn {{the rest of the}} group is using him as [...] "walker bait". Glenn later tells Lori that she should tell Rick about her pregnancy soon. Lori contemplates the act of raising a child <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>world,</b> <b>and</b> decides to take the pills, but after a moment, runs away from their camp to immediately regurgitate them.

500|$|In {{a review}} from Zap2it, Rick Porter gave the pilot praise for {{bringing}} together the central theme, saying [...] "No other new show this fall {{is attempting to}} tell a bigger story, and we're hoping the rough patches smooth out and it fulfills the potential that's there in its very strong cast and premise." [...] It also cited Jennifer Morrison and Jared Gilmore's performances when they appear in scenes together: [...] "As such it falls to Morrison to move the story along <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>world,</b> <b>and</b> fortunately for the audience she's able to pull it off. She gives a confident, grounded performance that helps keep the show from feeling too fantastical, and her rapport with Gilmore is a big plus too." [...] He also notes the writers and producers have put together a great premise and expects they'll have more as the series progresses: [...] "Given the cast and the people involved behind the scenes... we're more optimistic than not that Once Upon a Time will find its way. But if it doesn't, at least it will go down swinging." ...|$|E
500|$|Threatened with thirst, the Arab army left Baykand {{and headed}} for Bukhara, with Qatan in the vanguard. When the Turgesh and Soghdian forces attacked, the vanguard, some 6,000 men, was {{cut off from the}} main body under Ashras, and Ashras and Qatan gave each other up for lost until they met again two days later. The king of Samarkand, Ghurak, who had unto this moment {{remained}} ostensibly loyal to the Arabs—although, ever careful to hedge his bets, he had sent his son Mukhtar to the khagan—now switched sides. Exhausted by thirst, the Arab vanguard was almost cut down by their enemies, losing 700 men. At this point, according to the account preserved by al-Tabari, the Tamimi warrior al-Harith ibn Surayj, who was later to lead a widespread revolt in Khurasan, urged the Arabs forward, crying that [...] "being killed by the sword is nobler <b>in</b> (<b>this)</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> greater in reward with God than death by thirst". Encouraged by his example, the Tamimi and Qaysi cavalry under al-Harith and Qatan broke through the Turgesh lines and reached the water sources, narrowly staving off a second [...] "Day of Thirst" [...] and allowing Ashras to continue his advance towards Bukhara.|$|E
500|$|In {{regards to}} the White Walkers' origin, David Benioff stated [...] "No one's {{innocent}} really <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>world,</b> <b>and</b> there was just something really beautifully right {{about the idea that}} the great nemesis of mankind were created to protect the Children of the Forest from mankind." [...] D. B. Weiss noted, [...] "The Night King, who's sort of the embodiment of absolute evil, what you're watching is the creation of that absolute evil, so the absolute evil isn't absolute after all." [...] Benioff also alluded to the many references and foreshadowing throughout the series that preceded the reveal of the Children creating the White Walkers, saying, [...] "There are certain symbols and patterns that recur throughout the show. The first time we saw {{that was one of the}} very first scenes in the pilot, when Will the ranger sees the Wildling body parts in an odd pattern displayed by the White Walkers. We see it again north of the Wall with the dead horses displayed in a spiral pattern, and then you see it again here and see where these patterns come from, that they're ancient symbols of the Children of the Forest used in their rituals, and the Children of the Forest created the White Walkers." ...|$|E
