50|$|An early ISO {{standard}} {{defining a}} Telex-oriented communications protocol that used the non-printable ASCII transmission control characters SOH (Start of Heading), STX (Start of Text), ETX (<b>End</b> <b>of</b> <b>Text),</b> EOT (End of Transmission), ENQ (Enquiry), ACK (Acknowledge), DLE (Data Link Escape), NAK (Negative Acknowledge), SYN (Synchronous Idle), and ETB (End of Transmission Block).|$|E

5000|$|An {{optional}} heading containing control information can precede {{data in a}} frame. The content of the heading is not defined by the protocol but is defined for each specific device. The heading, if present, is preceded by an SOH (start of heading) character and followed by an STX (start of text). [...] Text data normally follows the heading, begun by the STX, and terminated by ETX (<b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>text)</b> or ETB (end transmission block).|$|E
50|$|A {{data block}} {{begins with the}} {{character}} 02 (STX, start of text), and ends with the character 03 (ETX, <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>text).</b> After ETX, a check byte {{made up of the}} previous bytes including STX and ETX by binary addition (XOR), is transmitted. A 0D character (decimal 13) marks the end of a line during transmission. Data files created by programs are able to use all characters as data and must contain no control characters. They are read and written in blocks of 1024 bytes.|$|E

50|$|At any instant in time, a file {{might have}} a size, {{normally}} expressed as number of bytes, that indicates how much storage {{is associated with the}} file. In most modern operating systems the size can be any non-negative whole number of bytes up to a system limit. Many older operating systems kept track only of the number of blocks or tracks occupied by a file on a physical storage device. In such systems, software employed other methods to track the exact byte count (e.g., CP/M used a special control character, Ctrl-Z, to signal the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>text</b> files).|$|E
50|$|The {{start of}} heading (SOH) {{character}} was to mark a non-data section of a data stream—the part of a stream containing addresses and other housekeeping data. The start of text character (STX) {{marked the end of}} the header, and the start of the textual part of a stream. The <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>text</b> character (ETX) marked the end of the data of a message. A widely used convention is to make the two characters preceding ETX a checksum or CRC for error-detection purposes. The end of transmission block character (ETB) was used to indicate the end of a block of data, where data was divided into such blocks for transmission purposes.|$|E

40|$|As a paratext, the colophon’s {{functions}} can be summarily {{and quickly}} described. It marks the <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> a <b>text.</b> In the era before printing {{this was a}} necessity, so that later copyists would know {{that they had a}} complete text before them to reproduce. This is the case with many Egyptian and Akkadkian colophons. As such, a colophon is an assertion of authority. In marking the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a <b>text</b> it pronounces that text to be in some way, “finished,” whole or complete. It also protects the text from any supplementation by its very visual presence, because any additional text would be clearly marked as literally and figuratively outside the bounds <b>of</b> the normative <b>text...</b>|$|R
