5|$|A British assault force {{landed on}} the island on 7 February, after which Nelson moved to intensify the {{blockade}} off Bastia. For {{the rest of the}} month he carried out raids along the coast and intercepted enemy shipping. By late February St Fiorenzo had fallen and British troops under Lieutenant-General David Dundas entered the outskirts of Bastia. However, Dundas merely assessed the enemy positions and then withdrew, arguing that the French were too well entrenched to risk an assault. Nelson convinced Hood otherwise, but a protracted debate between the army and naval commanders meant that Nelson did not receive permission to proceed until late March. Nelson began to land guns from his ships and <b>emplace</b> them in the hills surrounding the town. On 11 April the British squadron entered the harbour and opened fire, whilst Nelson took command of the land forces and commenced bombardment. After 45 days, the town surrendered. Nelson subsequently prepared for an assault on Calvi, working in company with Lieutenant-General Charles Stuart.|$|E
25|$|The nasal wound is cut {{and shaped}} into a {{teardrop}} form, by the cutting {{out of a}} Burrow's triangle of flesh {{on the side of}} pedicle base. Cutting out the Burrow's triangle (skin and subcutaneous fat) permits the moving the pedicle flap, to <b>emplace</b> it without buckling the tissues adjacent to the graft.|$|E
25|$|The {{clinical}} {{advantage of}} the free-flap breast reconstruction procedure is avoidance of the medical complications—infection, malposition of the breast implant(s), capsular contracture—which occasionally occur consequent to breast-reconstruction surgery procedures that <b>emplace</b> breast prostheses to the mastectomy wounds. In which cases, the correction of such medical complications might surgically require either the revision (rearrangement) or the explantation (removal) of the breast implants.|$|E
5000|$|The Barberton Mountain {{is a well}} {{preserved}} pre-3.0 Ga granite-greenstone terrane. The greenstone belt {{consists of}} a sequence of mafic to ultramafic lavas and metasedimentary rocks <b>emplaced</b> and deposited between 3.5 and 3.2 Ga. The granitoid rocks were <b>emplaced</b> over a 500 million year time span and {{can be divided into}} two suites. The TTG suite (<b>emplaced</b> approximately 3.5-3.2 Ga) contains tonalites, trondhjemites and granodiorites; and the GMS suite (<b>emplaced</b> approximately 3.2-3.1 Ga) includes granites, monzogranites and a small syenite-granite complex.|$|R
5000|$|Note: this mine {{can also}} be <b>emplaced</b> in other ways to hinder visual {{detection}} and/or the demining process. For example, sometimes PMA-2 mines are <b>emplaced</b> completely upside down with only a centimetre of the base showing above ground level. Alternatively, they may be buried diagonal to the ground surface, {{in such a way}} that the star-shaped plunger (now completely hidden underground) is facing a deminer's clearance probe. A minefield containing PMA-2 mines may have them <b>emplaced</b> in some or all of the three different ways described.|$|R

25|$|Transaxillary: an {{incision}} {{made to the}} axilla (armpit), {{from which}} the dissection tunnels medially, to <b>emplace</b> the implants, either bluntly or with an endoscope (illuminated video microcamera), without producing visible scars on the breast proper; yet, it is likelier to produce inferior asymmetry of the implant-device position. Therefore, surgical revision of transaxillary emplaced breast implants usually requires either an IMF incision or a periareolar incision.|$|E

25|$|Three {{lines of}} defence were {{established}} to defend Santa Cruz de Nuca and the harbour: the 300-ton frigate Concepción, the soldiers under Alberni {{on land and}} on the frigate, and the rebuilding of the battery on San Miguel Island. The construction of the battery was difficult. It was built {{on top of a}} rocky islandtall but small. Embrasures had to be built to support the guns. It then took four days to <b>emplace</b> eight large cannons. Later, six smaller cannons were also emplaced. The battery did not have enough space for the remaining eight large cannon Eliza had brought, so they were stored ashore.|$|E
25|$|Periareolar: a border-line {{incision}} {{along the}} periphery of the areola, which provides an optimal approach when adjustments to the IMF position are required, or when a mastopexy (breast lift) is included to the primary mammoplasty procedure. In periareolar emplacement, the incision is around the medial-half (inferior half) of the areola’s circumference. Silicone gel implants can be difficult to <b>emplace</b> via periareolar incision, because of the short, five-centimetre length (~ 5.0cm) of the required access-incision. Aesthetically, because the scars are at the areola’s border (periphery), they usually are less visible than the IMF-incision scars of women with light-pigment areolae; when compared to cutaneous-incision scars, the modified epithelia of the areolae are less prone to (raised) hypertrophic scars.|$|E
25|$|Casualties were {{light on}} both sides; Carleill's {{soldiers}} had lost only 28 men, although at least 50 more had been wounded. Spanish losses were even less - a mere nine men killed with another 35 wounded. Drake had captured nearly 250 Spanish including many important {{men of the}} city, {{one of which was}} Alonso Bravo a Spanish captain who had surrendered in the town marketplace. Drake had captured more than sixty guns, and he immediately ordered his carpenters and gunners to repair their carriages, and to <b>emplace</b> them where they could to cover the landward approaches to the city. The Spanish galleass had been captured and the remains of the charred galleys on the beach were stripped of anything valuable.|$|E

25|$|In {{the study}} Fat Grafting to the Breast Revisited: Safety and Efficacy (2007), the {{investigators}} {{reported that the}} autologous fat was harvested by liposuction, using a 10-ml syringe attached to a two-hole Coleman harvesting cannula; after centrifugation, the refined breast-filler fat was transferred to 3-ml syringes. Blunt infiltration cannulas were used to <b>emplace</b> the fat through 2-mm incisions; the blunt cannula injection method allowed greater dispersion of small aliquots (equal measures) of fat, and reduced the possibility of intravascular fat injection; no sharp needles are used for fat-graft injection to the breasts. The 2-mm incisions were positioned to allow the infiltration (emplacement) of fat grafts from at least two directions; a 0.2ml fat volume was emplaced with each withdrawal of the cannula.|$|E
25|$|Periareolar: an {{incision}} made {{along the}} areolar periphery (border), which provides an optimal approach when {{adjustments to the}} IMF position are required, or when a mastopexy (breast lift) is included to the primary mammoplasty procedure. In the periareolar emplacement method, the incision is around the medial-half (inferior half) of the areola's circumference. Silicone-gel implants {{can be difficult to}} <b>emplace</b> with this incision, because of the short, five-centimetre length (~ 5.0cm.) of the required access-incision. Aesthetically, because the scars are at the areola's border, they usually are less visible than the IMF-incision scars of women with light-pigment areolae. Furthermore, periareolar implantation produces a greater incidence of capsular contracture, severs the milk ducts and the nerves to the nipple, thus causes the most post-operative functional problems, e.g. impeded breast feeding.|$|E
25|$|To <b>emplace</b> the grafts of {{autologous}} fat-tissue, doctors J. Newman and J. Levin {{designed a}} lipo-injector gun with a gear-driven plunger, which allowed the even injection of autologous fat-tissue {{to the desired}} recipient sites. The control afforded by the lipo-injector gun assisted the plastic surgeon in controlling excessive pressure to the fat in {{the barrel of the}} syringe, thus avoiding over-filling the recipient site. The later-design lipo-injector gun featured a ratchet-gear operation that afforded the surgeon greater control in accurately emplacing grafts of autologous fat to the recipient site; a trigger action injected 0.1cm3 of filler. Since 1989, most non-surgical, fat-graft augmentation of the breast features the emplacement of adipocyte fat outside the breast parenchymaup to 300ml of fatin three equal measures (aliquots), is emplaced to the subpectoral space and to the intrapectoral space of the pectoralis major muscle, and the submammary space, to achieve a breast outcome of natural appearance and contour.|$|E

25|$|In December 2007, Transit New Zealand {{noted that}} the more than 160 options had been narrowed down to only two alignments. The first {{possible}} alignment (of approximately 4.5km length) would be a parallel link several hundred meters directly {{to the east of}} the existing bridge (either as a bridge or a tunnel), while the second alignment (of approximately 6.5km length) would start in the same general environs in North Shore City, but travel diagonally southeastwards to link up with the motorway at Grafton Gully, east of the Auckland CBD. The second option, due to the need to cross shipping lanes, would need to be a tunnel. It could also possibly be connected to the CBD via a side branch tunnel (for use by public transport only). North Shore City has noted that it would prefer a tunnel option for aesthetic reasons, and to potentially <b>emplace</b> light rail within the tunnel at a future stage.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Market Garden, 43 (Wessex) was stationed on 'the Island' (between the Rivers Waal and Nederrijn), lining the south bank of the Rhine. 43 Recce, with 12th Battalion King's Royal Rifle Corps from 8th Armoured Brigade under command, protected the division's open western flank. The concealed squadrons sent back reports, but were forbidden to engage the enemy in order to hide {{the extent of the}} position. However, on the night of 26/27 September a furious firefight broke out when the Germans crossed the river in strength and attempted to <b>emplace</b> anti-tank guns in 43 Recce's hidden positions. The divisional historian records that 'While the Division faced the monotony inseparable from static defence, the Reconnaissance Regiment fought a different type of war'. This involved guarding the western end of the Island, cooperating with the Dutch Resistance and facilitating the escape across the river of British paratroops who had evaded capture.|$|E

25|$|The {{operating}} room (OR) {{time required to}} harvest, refine, and <b>emplace</b> fat to the breasts {{is greater than the}} usual 2-hour OR time; the usual infiltration time was approximately 2-hours for the first 100cm3 volume, and approximately 45 minutes for injecting each additional 100cm3 volume of breast-filler fat. The technique for injecting fat grafts for breast augmentation allows the plastic surgeon great control in sculpting the breasts to the required contour, especially in the correction of tuberous breast deformity. In which case, no fat-graft is emplaced beneath the nipple-areola complex (NAC), and the skin envelope of the breast is selectively expanded (contoured) with subcutaneously emplaced body-fat, immediately beneath the skin. Such controlled contouring selectively increased the proportional volume of the breast in relation {{to the size of the}} nipple-areola complex, and thus created a breast of natural form and appearance; greater verisimilitude than is achieved solely with breast implants. The fat-corrected, breast-implant deformities, were inadequate soft-tissue coverage of the implant(s) and capsular contracture, achieved with subcutaneous fat-grafts that hid the implant-device edges and wrinkles, and decreased the palpability of the underlying breast implant. Furthermore, grafting autologous fat around the breast implant can result in softening the breast capsule.|$|E
