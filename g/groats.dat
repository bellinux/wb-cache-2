At a minimum, spoonfuls of borscht are alternated with bites of a slice of bread.

25|$|Buckwheat <b>groats</b> are {{commonly}} used in western Asia and eastern Europe. The porridge was common, and is often considered the definitive peasant dish. It is made from roasted <b>groats</b> that are cooked with broth to a texture similar to rice or bulgur. The dish was brought to America by Ukrainian, Russian, and Polish immigrants who called it kasha, and they mixed it with pasta or {{used it as a}} filling for cabbage rolls, knishes, and blintzes, hence buckwheat prepared in this fashion is most commonly called kasha in America. <b>Groats</b> were the most widely used form of buckwheat worldwide during the 20th century, eaten primarily in Estonia, Russia, Ukraine, and Poland, called grechka in Ukrainian or Russian. The <b>groats</b> can also be sprouted and then eaten raw or cooked.|$|E

25|$|The unsized oat <b>groats</b> {{pass through}} a heat and {{moisture}} treatment to balance moisture, but mainly to stabilize them. Oat <b>groats</b> are high in fat (lipids) and once removed from their protective hulls and exposed to air, enzymatic (lipase) activity begins {{to break down the}} fat into free fatty acids, ultimately causing an off-flavour or rancidity. Oats begin to show signs of enzymatic rancidity within four days of being dehulled if not stabilized. This process is primarily done in food-grade plants, not in feed-grade plants. <b>Groats</b> are not considered raw if they have gone through this process; the heat disrupts the germ and they cannot sprout.|$|E

25|$|Centrifugal {{acceleration}} is used {{to separate}} the outer hull from the inner oat groat. Oats are fed by gravity onto the centre of a horizontally spinning stone, which accelerates them towards the outer ring. <b>Groats</b> and hulls are separated on impact with this ring. The lighter oat hulls are then aspirated away, while the denser oat <b>groats</b> are taken {{to the next step}} of processing. Oat hulls can be used as feed, processed further into insoluble oat fibre, or used as a biomass fuel.|$|E

25|$|This process uses {{two large}} smooth or {{corrugated}} rolls spinning {{at the same}} speed in opposite directions at a controlled distance. After rolling, the oats are then toasted to make rolled oats. Oat flakes, also known as rolled oats, have many different sizes, thicknesses and other characteristics {{depending on the size of}} oat <b>groats</b> passed between the rolls. Typically, the three sizes of steel cut oats are used to make instant, baby and quick rolled oats, whereas whole oat <b>groats</b> are used to make regular, medium and thick rolled oats. Oat flakes range in thickness from 0.36mm to 1.00mm.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, little agronomic {{research}} has been conducted in Australia on oats. With grain markets becoming more aware of quality traits much can be gained by understanding the response of individual cultivars to growing conditions. The commercial release of new oat cultivars identified the need to determine under what conditions the best yields and quality could be obtained for each cultivar. Nine cultivars were grown in 12 delayed sowing experiments in the wheatbelt region of Western Australia from 1997 - 2000. Traits assessed included grain yield and quality. Delayed sowing, reduced grain yield, seed weight and <b>groat</b> oil content. The yield efficiency of converting post sowing rainfall (PSRF) into yield (yield/PSRF) increased with delayed sowing. Delayed sowing also increased <b>groat</b> beta-glucan content and screenings below a 2. 0 mm screen but decreased <b>groat</b> percent for most cultivars. Whilst grain density and <b>groat</b> protein were not affected by delayed sowing. As PSRF declined, yield, seed weight, <b>groat</b> percent and <b>groat</b> oil were reduced. Grain density increased as PSRF declined for all cultivars except one. Lower PSRF also resulted in higher screenings, and slightly higher <b>groat</b> protein and beta-glucan content. At lower PSRF levels there was more variation in yield, grain density and screenings because the timing of rain events became more critical at lower rainfall. The difference in <b>groat</b> oil content between the cultivars was much larger than the effect of PSRF. In the two trials that were waterlogged, yield was reduced by approximately 1. 5 - 1. 8 t/ha, grain density was 4 kg/hL lower and protein was reduced by 2 %. Under waterlogging oil content increased and yield efficiency decreased with delayed sowing. Where weed competition was observed, yields were reduced by 1. 5 t/ha, seed weight by 3 - 9 mg and <b>groat</b> percent by 2 - 3 %. These findings will provide growers and industry with a greater understanding of environmental effects on oat yield and quality for oats generally and for specific cultivars. vokMyynti MTT tietopalvelu...|$|R
40|$|Grain {{characteristics}} and <b>groat</b> composition {{have been evaluated}} in 35 genotypes from nine taxonomic species of Avena, including three species (A. agadiriana, A. atlantica, A. damascena) for which no previous data are available. There was substantial interspecific and intraspecific variation for all characteristics measured. The proportion of <b>groat</b> in the grain ranged from 32 ? 7 ? 62 ? 1 %, and mean <b>groat</b> weight from 2 ? 4 ? 37 ? 4 mg. <b>Groat</b> protein concentrations ranged from 13 ? 9 ? 41 ? 3 %, and exceeded 32 % in one A. atlantica, two A. damascena and one A. murphyi genotype. <b>Groat</b> ?-glucan concentration showed very wide variation (2 ? 2 ? 11 ? 3 %) are there were substantial interspecific and intraspecific differences. The highest ?-glucan concentrations were found in genotypes of A. atlantica. Although there were interspecific and intraspecific variations in <b>groat</b> oil concentration (4 ? 2 ? 10 ? 6 %), and in fatty acid composition, data were within previously reported ranges for A. sativa.
