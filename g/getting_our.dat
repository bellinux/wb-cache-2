According to the Louisiana Film and Video Commission, the film was originally titled What Friends are For. Spears described it as a teen movie that deals with real issues that normal teenagers live on a daily basis. She continued to explain the film's content, saying that it [...] "is about this journey that the three of us best friends take, finding ourselves and what we want out of life and <b>getting</b> <b>our</b> friendship back.

2500|$|Landing a {{recording}} deal in 1991, the group released their debut album Forever My Lady that same year.

It featured the number 1 R singles [...] "Forever My Lady," [...] "Stay," [...] and [...] "Come and Talk to Me." [...] Mr. Dalvin recalls how the album Forever My Lady was created, “The last version of the album that was released only took us a week to finish because we had already written the songs.

Rescuers felt a pulse and heard the unconscious Hammond breathing before the car was turned upright. Hammond was cut free with hydraulic shears, and placed on a backboard. [...] "He was regaining consciousness at that point and said he had some lower back pain". He was then transported by the Yorkshire Air Ambulance to the neurological unit of the Leeds General Infirmary.
