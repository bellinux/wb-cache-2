5|$|In June 2010, it was {{reported}} that plans were made to create a film titled Die Hard 24/7, which would serve as a crossover between 24 and the Die Hard franchise, with Sutherland to reprise his role as Jack Bauer alongside Bruce Willis' John McClane.

5|$|In 1886, 5million {{birds were}} {{estimated}} to be killed for their feathers. They were shot usually in the spring, when their feathers were colored for mating and nesting. The plumes, or aigrettes, as they were called in the millinery business, sold for $32 an ounce in 1915— the price of gold. Millinery was a $17million a year industry that motivated plume harvesters to lay in watch of nests of egrets and many colored birds during the nesting season, shoot the parents with small-bore rifles, and leave the chicks to starve. Plumes from Everglades wading birds {{could be found in}} Havana, New York City, London, and Paris. Hunters could collect plumes from a hundred birds on a <b>good</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the prior}} three {{films in the}} series, the U.S. rating was PG-13 rather than R. An unrated version {{contained}} more strong profanity and violence not shown in the theatrical version, and {{was included in the}} DVD release. For the DVD release, 20th Century Fox pioneered a new kind of DRM, Digital Copy protection that tries to weaken the incentives for consumers to learn how to rip discs by offering them a downloadable version with studio-imposed restrictions. The score for the film was released on July 2, 2007. The fifth film in the series, titled A <b>Good</b> <b>Day</b> to Die Hard, was released on February 14, 2013.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the union dispute, many club patrons no longer visited the night spot. Those who were {{performers}} were informed of the possibility of fines and suspensions by their respective unions for crossing the Stork Club picket line as the issue continued. Many of Billingsley's friendships, including those of Walter Winchell and J. Edgar Hoover, were over as {{a result of}} the union problems. He began firing staff without good cause. As the dispute dragged on, there was also no longer a live band in the dining room for music; members of the Musicians' Union had crossed the picket line to perform for some time. Previously, the club had no need for advertising; it was mentioned frequently in print and word of mouth without it. In 1963, the club offered a hamburger and French fries for $1.99 in a New York Times advertisement; when those in the know about the club saw it, they realized the Stork Club's days were coming to an end. In the last few months of its operation, at times there were only three customers for the entire evening. On a <b>good</b> <b>day</b> in the mid-1940s, some 2,500 people visited the club.|$|E

5|$|Buffalo's {{offensive}} {{performance was}} {{in some ways the}} opposite of Connecticut's: while UConn dominated on the ground and barely passed the ball, Buffalo struggled with the run but had a <b>good</b> <b>day</b> passing. The Bulls ran for a total of 24yards on the game; James Starks accounted for 25yards on thirteencarries and scored a touchdown, while RB Brandon Termilus ran threetimes for fiveyards. Their total was partially offset by Drew Willy, who lost sixyards on three rushing attempts. Willy had a much more successful day passing, completing 29 out of 43passes for 213yards and oneinterception. Namaan Roosevelt led the Buffalo receivers with 90yards on eightcatches; of the five other Bulls who received passes, WR Brett Hamlin caught fourpasses for 54yards, TE Jesse Rack caught three for 22yards, RB Starks caught 11 for 21yards, WR Ernest Jackson caught two for 17yards, and WR Gary Rice caught one for 9yards.|$|E
