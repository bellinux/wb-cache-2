25|$|Rosenzweig's major work is The Star of Redemption (first {{published}} in 1921). It is {{a description of}} the relationships between God, humanity, and the world, as they are connected by creation, revelation and redemption. If one makes a diagram with God at the top, and the World and the Self below, the inter-relationships generate a Star of David map. He is critical of any attempt to replace actual human existence with an ideal. In Rosenzweig's scheme, revelation arises not in metaphysics but <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> now. We are called to love God, and to do so is to return to the world, and that is redemption.|$|E

Henry's preceding speech to Suffolk, where he demands Suffolk not look at him, and then immediately demands that he wants to look into Suffolk's eyes was played by Alan Howard {{in such a way as}} to suggest that Henry was losing his grip on reality, and in response to this, Mirren played the speech in such a way as to engage Henry's mind <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> now, focus his thoughts and prevent them drifting away.|$|E

500|$|... "Here, There and Everywhere" [...] is a ballad that McCartney wrote {{towards the}} end of the Revolver sessions. His {{inspiration}} for the song was the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds track [...] "God Only Knows", which, in turn, Brian Wilson had been inspired to write after listening to Rubber Soul. McCartney's double-tracked vocal was treated with varispeeding, resulting in a higher pitch at playback. The song's opening lines are sung over shifts in time signature from 9/8 to 7/8 to 4/4; according to Everett, [...] "nowhere else does a Beatles introduction so well prepare a listener for the most striking and expressive tonal events that lie ahead." [...] Womack characterises the song as a romantic ballad [...] "about living <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> now" [...] and [...] "fully experiencing the conscious moment". He notes that, with the preceding track, [...] "Love You To", the album expresses [...] "corresponding examinations of the human experience of physical and romantic love".|$|E

Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded is all blue-light electronics and primal throb, 25th-century pop music <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> now." [...] Digital Spy's Nick Levine also gave Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded {{four out of five}} stars, but was skeptical about the choice to re-release the album, writing that [...] "it isn't worth forking out for Good Girl Gone Bad twice just to hear the new songs". Despite that, he praised the newly added songs especially [...] "If I Never See Your Face Again"; he called the song [...] "superior". Levine further wrote, [...] "if Reloaded encourages a few hesitant pop fans to invest in this album, {{the closest thing to a}} Thriller that 2007/8 is likely to produce, this rather cynical reissue should be let off the hook... just." [...] Among other achieved awards and nominations, [...] "Disturbia" [...] and [...] "If I Never See Your Face Again" [...] received nominations for Best Dance Recording and Pop Collaboration with Vocals respectively at the 2009 Grammy Awards.|$|E

Dylan's 38th studio album {{was recorded in}} Hollywood's Capitol Studios and features his touring band. Dylan posted a long interview on his website to promote the album, and was asked if this material was an exercise in nostalgia. [...] "Nostalgic? No I wouldn’t say that. It’s not taking a trip down memory lane or longing and yearning for {{the good old days}} or fond memories of what’s no more. A song like [...] "Sentimental Journey" [...] is not a way back when song, it doesn’t emulate the past, it’s attainable and down to earth, it’s <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> now." [...] The album was awarded a score of 84 on critical aggregator website Metacritic, signifying [...] "universal acclaim". Critics praised the thoroughness of Dylan's exploration of the great American songbook, though, in the opinion of Uncut: [...] "For all its easy charms, Triplicate labours its point to the brink of overkill.

500|$|Ursula Franklin {{explains}} in {{a prelude to}} her 2006 collection of papers, interviews and talks that her lifelong interest in structures, in what she terms [...] "the arrangement and interplay of the parts within a whole," [...] {{has been at the}} root of most of her activities. Looking back after almost 40 years, she adds, [...] "I can see how I have tried to wrestle with just one fundamental question: 'How can one live and work as a pacifist <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> now and help to structure a society in which oppression, violence, and wars would diminish and co-operation, equality, and justice would rise?'" [...] As part of the answer, Franklin turns to the metaphor of mapmaking to explain her intellectual journey. [...] "Increasingly I found the maps of conventional wisdom inadequate for my travels," [...] she writes. [...] "I became unwilling and unable to orient my life according to national maps depicting the realms of 'them' and 'us,' of good guys and bad guys, of winning, defeating, and being defeated; in short, all those maps drawn up for travel towards private gain and personal advancement." [...] Franklin concludes that she has been guided in understanding what she calls [...] "the real world" [...] by [...] "the maps of pacifism and feminism".|$|E

For example, although one might aspire to lose weight, one cannot do so through a single action <b>in</b> <b>the</b> specific moment at hand; weight loss instead requires action across diverse social contexts over time.

2500|$|Klee {{suffered}} from a wasting disease, scleroderma, {{toward the end of}} his life, enduring pain that seems to be reflected in his last works of art. One of his last paintings, Death and Fire, features a skull in the center with the German word for death, [...] "Tod", appearing in the face. He died in Muralto, Locarno, Switzerland, on 29 June 1940 without having obtained Swiss citizenship, despite his birth in that country. His art work was considered too revolutionary, even degenerate, by the Swiss authorities, but eventually they accepted his request six days after his death. His legacy comprises about 9,000 works of art. The words on his tombstone, Klee's credo, placed there by his son Felix, say, [...] "I cannot be grasped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> now, For my dwelling place is as much among the dead, As the yet unborn, Slightly closer to the heart of creation than usual, But still not close enough."

2500|$|Modern humanists, such as Corliss Lamont or Carl Sagan, {{hold that}} {{humanity}} must seek for truth through reason {{and the best}} observable evidence and endorse scientific skepticism and the scientific method. However, they stipulate that decisions about right and wrong {{must be based on}} the individual and common good, with no consideration given to metaphysical or supernatural beings. The idea is to engage with what is human. The ultimate goal is human flourishing; making life better for all humans, and as the most conscious species, also promoting concern for the welfare of other sentient beings and the planet as a whole. [...] The focus is on doing good and living well <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> now, and leaving {{the world a better place}} for those who come after. In 1925, the English mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead cautioned: [...] "The prophecy of Francis Bacon has now been fulfilled; and man, who at times dreamt of himself as a little lower than the angels, has submitted to become the servant and the minister of nature.

2500|$|After Maudgalyāyana's death, {{people asked}} why Maudgalyāyana had not {{protected}} himself, and why a great enlightened monk would suffer such a death. The Buddha {{said that because}} Maudgalyāyana had contracted such karma in a previous life (the murder of one's own parents {{is one of the}} five heinous acts that reap the worst karma), so he could not avoid reaping the consequences. He therefore accepted the results. Further, the Buddha stated that even psychic powers will be of no use in avoiding karma, especially when it is serious karma. Shortly after having left Maudgalyāyana for dead, the bandits were all executed. Professor of Religion James McDermott therefore concludes that there must have been [...] "a confluence" [...] of karma between Maudgalyāyana and the bandits, and cites the killing as evidence that in Buddhism the karma of different individuals can interact. Richard Gombrich raises the example of the murder to prove another point: he points out that Maudgalyāyana was able to attain enlightenment, despite his heavy karma from a past life. This, he says, shows that the Buddha taught everyone can attain enlightenment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> now, rather than enlightenment necessarily being a gradual process built up through many lifetimes.|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Brenda Cossman {{examined}} Big Love {{closely in}} her study of [...] "migrating marriages" [...] for Law and Contemporary Problems. In addition to asserting that [...] "Just as in Big Love, same-sex marriage is never more than one degree away of separation from polygamy," [...] she found that the series adds crucial insight {{to the understanding of}} marriages that exist between legal and cultural recognition. As she explains, [...] "These cases can be seen through the lens of ... Big Love, in which marriages are produced as the culturally real <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> the now, even when legal recognition remains elusive." [...] By exploring the movement seeking to culturally legitimize same-sex marriage, she concluded Big Love served as a most powerful, unique allegory: [...] "Big Love plays on an even more decisive gap: polygamous marriages are not legal in Utah {{or anywhere else in the}} country. Yet the point and the poignancy of the show is to depict a 'real-life' family. Bill Hendrickson and his three wives struggle with all of the daily trials of contemporary family life: parenting, finances, intimacy, and sex. The sympathetic portrayal of their family is as culturally real, although it suffers by virtue of its nonlegal recognition." ...|$|E
