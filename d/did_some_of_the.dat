In fact, their stories on the Cuban rebellion and Spain's atrocities on the island—many of which turned out to be untrue—were motivated primarily by outrage at Spain's brutal policies on the island, which led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocent Cubans. The most well-known story involved the imprisonment and release of Cuban prisoner Evangelina Cisneros.|$|E

25|$|Proteus, {{like the}} other inner {{satellites}} of Neptune, {{is unlikely to be}} an original body that formed with it, and is more likely to have accreted from the rubble that was produced after Triton's capture.

25|$|The {{scientific}} {{revolution is}} a convenient boundary between ancient thought and classical physics. Nicolaus Copernicus revived the heliocentric {{model of the}} solar system described by Aristarchus of Samos. This was followed by the first known model of planetary motion given by Johannes Kepler in the early 17th century, which proposed that the planets follow elliptical orbits, with the Sun at one focus of the ellipse. Galileo ("Father of Modern Physics") also made use of experiments to validate physical theories, a key element of the scientific method.

25|$|As Nahuatl, {{carried by}} the Toltec and later the Aztec culture, became a lingua franca {{throughout}} Mesoamerica even some Mayan states such as the K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj adopted Nahuatl as a prestige language. In Oaxaca Zapotec and Mixtec peoples expanded their territories displacing speakers of the Tequistlatecan languages slightly. During this time the Purépecha (Tarascans) consolidated their state based at Tzintzuntzan. They were resistant to other states of Mesoamerica and had little contact {{with the rest of}} Mesoamerica. Probably {{as a result of their}} isolationist policy the Purépecha language is the only language of Mesoamerica to not show any of the traits associated with the Mesoamerican Linguistic Area. In Guerrero the Tlapanecs of Yopitzinco speaking the Oto-Manguean Tlapanec language remained independent of the Aztec empire as <b>did</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Oaxacan cultures such as the Mixtecs of Tututepec and the Zapotec of Zaachila. In the late postclassic around 1400 CE Zapotecs of Zaachila moved into the Isthmus of Tehuantepec creating a wedge of Zapotec speaking settlements between the former neighbors the Mixe and the Huave who were pushed into their current territories on the edges of the Isthmus.|$|E

500|$|After The Gondoliers closed, Gilbert and Sullivan were estranged for a time, and Carte hired Bond to play Chinna-Loofa in Dance, Desprez, and Solomon's The Nautch Girl (1891). [...] Although {{her salary}} {{continued}} to rise, she was less happy at the Savoy after Gilbert's departure. [...] She took a three-month {{leave from the}} D'Oyly Carte organisation in August 1891, together with Rutland Barrington, performing a series of [...] "musical duologues" [...] and sketches, written mostly by Barrington and composed by Edward Solomon, on a provincial tour, where they received good notices and profits.

500|$|As {{the lines}} between comedy show and news show have blurred, Jon Stewart has come under {{pressure}} in some circles to engage in more serious journalism. Tucker Carlson and Daily Show co-creator Lizz Winstead have chastised Stewart for criticizing politicians and newspeople in his solo segments and then, in interviews with the same people, rarely taking them to task face-to-face. In 2004, Winstead expressed a desire for Stewart to ask harder satirical questions, saying, [...] "When you are interviewing a Richard Perle or a Kissinger, {{if you give them}} a pass, then you become what you are satirizing. You have a war criminal sitting on your couch—to just let him be a war criminal sitting on your couch means you are having to respect some kind of boundary." [...] She has argued that The Daily Show success and access to the youth vote should allow Stewart to press political guests harder without fearing that they will not return to the show. In 2010, Winstead had changed her views, commenting that since 2004, Stewart <b>did</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hardest-hitting interviews on TV. Stewart said in 2003 that he does not think of himself as a social or media critic and rejects the idea that he has any journalistic role as an interviewer.|$|E
500|$|... "Death in Bloom" [...] {{was written}} and storyboarded by Jesse Moynihan and Cole Sanchez, from {{a story by}} Mark Banker, Kent Osborne, Patrick McHale, and series creator Pendleton Ward. The episode was {{directed}} by Larry Leichliter. Both Ward and fellow series storyboard artist Tom Herpich helped Moynihan and Sanchez clean up their story. One scene, in which Finn and Jake hide from the skeletons only to have Jake's flatulence alert them to their presence, {{was supposed to be}} storyboarded by Ward. However, he was extremely tired and offered Herpich $100—the amount Ward would have earned had he done it—to storyboard the scene instead. The episode features an extremely long pan showing much of the Land of the Dead. Moynihan noted that he [...] "wanted to really go over the top and make it like 15 pages but 7 pages felt right"; he later said that he wanted to [...] "blow kids' minds" [...] with the shot. Moynihan's original pan was redesigned by background designer Dan [...] "Ghostshrimp" [...] James, who also <b>did</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other backgrounds for the episode. Other background were done by Chris Tsirgiotis, who, according to Moynihan, was doing his [...] "best Ghostshrimp impression"; Tsirgiotis himself later noted that, [...] "Matching Ghostshrimp’s drawing style is pretty tricky. It looks simple at first glance, but it’s actually very sophisticated and nuanced." ...|$|E

500|$|From 1784 to 1859 the Parisian [...] (concert pitch) rose {{steadily}} from 820 to 896 cycles per second, thus Gluck's French {{version for}} haute-contre became increasingly impractical. When Adolphe Nourrit sang the {{role at the}} Opéra in 1824 his music was altered. Giacomo Meyerbeer suggested to the French contralto Pauline Viardot that she should perform the role of Orfeo. The composer Hector Berlioz {{was a close friend}} of Viardot and the leading expert in France on the music of Gluck. He knew the score of [...] "the largely forgotten Italian original as thoroughly as he knew the French", and agreed to prepare a version of the opera – in four acts – with Viardot's voice in mind, adapting the role of Orphée for a female alto. In his adaptation, Berlioz used the key scheme of the 1762 Vienna score while incorporating much of the additional music of the 1774 Paris score. He returned to the Italian version only when he considered it to be superior either in terms of music or in terms of the drama. He also restored some of the more subtle orchestration from the Italian version and resisted proposals by Viardot and the theatre's director Léon Carvalho to modernize the orchestration. In the end Camille Saint-Saëns, who was acting as Berlioz's assistant on the project, <b>did</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> minor rewriting which Berlioz had declined to do.|$|E
