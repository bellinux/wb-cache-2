5|$|In {{many of the}} works, {{including}} the original series, Warhol drastically simplified the gold medallion that appears on Campbell's Soup cans by replacing the paired allegorical figures with a flat yellow disk. In most variations, the only hint of three-dimensionality came from the shading on the tin lid. Otherwise the image was flat. The works with torn labels are perceived as metaphors {{of life in the}} sense that even packaged food must meet its <b>end.</b> <b>They</b> are often described as expressionistic.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese {{units in}} the area also defended strongly, but they too were short on {{supplies}} and in the <b>end</b> <b>they</b> were forced to withdraw further north. Wareo subsequently fell to the Allies on 8 December, who then established a line east from Wareo to Gusika on the coast. From there they carried out further advances north later in the month and into early January 1944.|$|E
5|$|The Young {{brothers}} {{decided to}} abandon the glam rock image which had already been adopted by Melbourne band The Skyhooks and pursue a harder blues-rock sound.

5|$|By Sept. 2, 1871, Polaris {{had reached}} her furthest north of 82°29'N. Tension flared {{again as the}} three leading {{officers}} could not agree on whether to proceed further or not. Hall and Tyson wanted to press north, to cut down the distance {{they would have to}} travel to the Pole by dogsled. Budington did not want to further risk the ship, and walked out on the discussion. In the <b>end,</b> <b>they</b> sailed into Thank God Harbor (now called Hall Bay) on Sept. 10, 1871, and anchored for the winter on the shore of northern Greenland.|$|E

5|$|Magnapop {{have been}} defined genre-wise as power pop by {{multiple}} rock critics, and their performances have drawn comparisons with punk, new wave, and surf rock. Reviewers have {{commented on the}} band's pop-influenced songwriting, specifically their employment of guitar hooks and simple chord structure. To that <b>end,</b> <b>they</b> have been compared to Mould's previous work {{as a member of}} Sugar and Hüsker Dü, as well as fellow Georgia-based rock acts such as Guadalcanal Diary and Let's Active and alternative rock pioneers Pixies and The Replacements. The album Rubbing Doesn't Help represented a stylistic shift for the band away from their more pop-inspired material toward more guitar-oriented rock, but their comeback with Mouthfeel returned to the more pop-inspired sound of Hot Boxing.|$|E

5|$|On D-Day, the 1st Special Service Brigade was {{tasked with}} linking {{up with the}} 6th Airborne Division on the eastern flank of Sword and {{securing}} the high ground near La Plein.

5|$|Rocksteady {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} a sequel before development of Arkham Asylum had concluded, developing ideas for both the story and setting so the games' narratives could be effectively connected; a secret room was hidden in the asylum warden's office in Arkham Asylum containing hints of how the sequel would progress, including blueprints for the Arkham City prison; the blueprints are quite similar to its final layout in Arkham City. The original idea was to take the game out of the asylum setting and onto the streets of Gotham City while retaining the level of design detail put into the asylum. To that <b>end</b> <b>they</b> wanted to include locations from the Batman mythos that were notable and meaningful to the character, instead of a series of generic streets; Rocksteady was initially unsure how technical considerations would limit the scope of this idea.|$|E
