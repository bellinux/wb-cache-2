5|$|Connecting the {{cerebellum}} {{to different}} parts of the nervous system are three paired cerebellar peduncles. These are the superior cerebellar peduncle, the middle cerebellar peduncle and the inferior cerebellar peduncle, named by their position relative to the vermis. The superior cerebellar peduncle is mainly an output to the cerebral cortex, carrying efferent fibers via thalamic nuclei to upper motor neurons in the cerebral cortex. The fibers arise <b>from</b> <b>the</b> deep cerebellar nuclei. The middle cerebellar peduncle is connected to the pons and receives all of its input <b>from</b> <b>the</b> pons mainly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> pontine nuclei. The input to the pons is <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cerebral cortex and is relayed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> pontine nuclei via transverse pontine fibers to the cerebellum. The middle peduncle is the largest of the three and its afferent fibers are grouped into three separate fascicles taking their inputs to {{different parts of}} the cerebellum. The inferior cerebellar peduncle receives input from afferent fibers <b>from</b> <b>the</b> vestibular nuclei, spinal cord and the tegmentum. Output <b>from</b> <b>the</b> inferior peduncle is via efferent fibers to the vestibular nuclei and the reticular formation. The whole of the cerebellum receives modulatory input <b>from</b> <b>the</b> inferior olivary nucleus via the inferior cerebellar peduncle.|$|E
