5000|$|Carl {{was born}} in Rudolstadt, Germany, where he was apprenticed as a sewing machine mechanic, {{and when he was}} 14 years old he ran away to New York, where he found {{employment}} with the Singer Sewing Machine Company, travelled over a much of the United States on their behalf. He met Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone, and became deeply interested in the invention. The Franco-Prussian War had just began and Carl Albert Unbehaun, with every other young German man, was called to enlist, which as someone opposed to all war, held no attractions and he notified the German authorities of his refused to return to the Fatherland. For this, all his legal and civil rights were forfeit, and he worked his passage to Sydney, where his knowledge of the telephone system made him a useful employee. He entered the New South Wales Telegraph Department as <b>instrument</b> <b>fitter</b> to assist in the equipment of the operating room in the Sydney Post-Office, which was under construction.In 1876 he was head-hunted by Charles Todd for the position of electrical fitter in charge of the Postal Telegraph workshop in Adelaide, and Unbehaun left New South Wales for South Australia in 1877.He built and installed the instruments for the first telephonic communication in South Australia, conducted for the Post-office Department on Christmas Day, 1877.On 14 May 1883 Adelaide's first telephone exchange, with 48 subscribers, was officially established {{in a corner of the}} telegraph operating-room of the General Post Office, Adelaide.In 1884 he took charge of the Electrical Department. He became Inspector of Telephones, later styled [...] "Electrical Engineer and Inspector of Telephones" [...] in 1891. He was in charge of installation of electric lighting in Parliament House, North Terrace. With Federation and the unification of Telegraph departments in 1904, he was given the title of Electrical Engineer.|$|E

This was somewhat offset by a growing stigma that a seven-string guitar was a [...] "nu metal" [...] <b>instrument,</b> <b>fit</b> only for heavy riffing. This was ironic as Korn guitarists Munky and Head remember being told in their early days that the seven-string guitar could not be used for riffing, as it was a guitar for technical guitar players.|$|R

30|$|In the following, {{we first}} present the student sample {{that was used}} to {{investigate}} the test’s fit to the Rasch model, its validity as a change measure, and its reliability.

2500|$|Whereas older <b>instruments</b> <b>fitted</b> with valve {{attachments}} {{usually had}} the tubing coiled rather tightly in the bell section (closed wrap [...] or traditional wrap), modern instruments usually have the tubing kept as free as possible of tight bends in the tubing (open wrap), {{resulting in a}} freer response with the valve attachment tubing engaged. While open-wrap tubing does offer a more open sound, the tubing sticks {{out from behind the}} bell and is more vulnerable to damage. For that reason, closed-wrap tubing remains more popular in trombones used in marching bands or other ensembles where the trombone may be more prone to damage.|$|R

The {{success of the}} SZD-37x prototypes in the World Championships was not repeated, due partly to shrinkage of the epoxy resin causing irregularities in the wing surfaces, and partly to the improved performance of the competing aircraft. The SZD-38 broke seven Polish National records in 1973, but was soon out-classed in competitions.

50|$|The Appendix A Musical <b>Instrument</b> <b>Fit</b> For a Queen: The Metamorphosis of a Medieval Citole {{pointed out}} that the way the citole was held allowed very limited {{movement}} of the hands on the instrument and suggested that the citole primarily played drone chords. The article suggested they were used as rhythm instruments, playing a few notes repeatedly to keep time. This, the article suggests, was a reason to pair the instruments with fiddles. This would be especially true of the deep-neck citoles with a thumbhole, that would keep the hand on the neck from moving up and down the neck.|$|R

The use of multi-sample analyses within structural equation modelling substantiated invariant factor structures for three grouping variables: country, grade level and student gender. This study supported the wide international applicability of the WIHIC as a valid measure of classroom psychosocial environment...|$|R

50|$|The saxtuba {{was first}} {{conceived}} by Sax at his workshop in the Rue Saint-Georges in Paris around 1845. On 5 May 1849 Sax {{applied for a}} patent {{for a series of}} brasswind <b>instruments</b> <b>fitted</b> with cylinders. On 16 July 1849 he was granted French Patent 8351. The saxtubas were patented in 1852, in a certificate of addition to the main patent of 1849. Like Sax's saxhorns and saxotrombas, which were also covered by this patent, the saxtubas were equipped with pavillons tournants - that is to say, their bells could be pointed forward - which was considered ideal for instruments intended to be played by marching or mounted bands in the open air.|$|R
