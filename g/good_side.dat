5|$|Starting in {{a neutral}} position, Karma can reach up to Hero on the <b>Good</b> <b>side</b> or Infamous on the Evil side. Certain actions, such as {{stopping}} to help injured citizens or killing them to restore Cole's health, will affect the Karma level in either direction. Normal story missions may also alter the Karma level. During the game the player will encounter Karma moments, the Karma moments are delivered with 3D cutscenes and character-driven dialogue, the action pauses and the player has two actions that can be taken, always a Good and Evil option. There are also Good and Evil side missions in the game as well as random events which provide Karma decisions. Completion of Karma awarding missions helps gain access to unique powers based on the Karma level. The player is not locked into choosing either Karma path, and may opt to play towards one extreme and later switch to the other mid-game. Karma also influences the way that citizens view Cole in addition to altering Cole's appearance and {{certain aspects of the}} game's story. Citizens may throw rocks at and turn on Cole if he has Evil Karma or take pictures of and compliment Cole if he has Good Karma.|$|E

At the next session, Ted suggests waiting till his ten sessions are over before asking her out, but Stella tells him she will still say no. Ted still feels that over ten weeks, she will start to like him, so decides to keep trying. Even though the first five sessions go well, Stella confirms her answer is still no. Ted decides that being nice to the receptionist, Abby (Britney Spears), would {{be a good way to}} let Stella see his <b>good</b> <b>side,</b> but instead, Abby starts to show interest in him. Upset that this didn't work, Ted tries using a self-help book he saw in Stella's clinic. When he tries talking to her about this, she reveals it isn't her book, and she detests it, while Abby confirms that Ted was reading the book in the reception.|$|E

His willingness to get into the box was critical too, and his four goals made him joint top-goalscorer.|$|E

25|$|I {{might put}} it this way. The story is cast {{in terms of a}} <b>good</b> <b>side,</b> and a bad side, beauty against {{ruthless}} ugliness, tyranny against kingship, moderated freedom with consent against compulsion that has long lost any object save mere power, and so on; but both sides in some degree, conservative or destructive, want a measure of control. But if you have, as it were, taken 'a vow of poverty', renounced control, and take your delight in things for themselves without reference to yourself, watching, observing, and to some extent knowing, then the questions of the rights and wrongs of power and control might become utterly meaningless to you, and the means of power quite valueless...|$|E
25|$|As {{a member}} of the Edenian race in the fictional other {{dimension}} called Outworld, the character is over ten thousand years old, although she appears to be a young woman. Throughout the years, Kitana has risen to great importance, first as the loyal stepdaughter of Outworld's evil emperor Shao Kahn; then his enemy, tearing herself away from his grasp and freeing her home realm of Edenia; and then leading an army into Outworld to combat any chance of Kahn rising to power again. Kitana shared a subtle love interest with Earthrealm champion Liu Kang until his death, though they were briefly reunited prior to his resurrection. Despite her loyalty to Shao Kahn for most of her life, she has aligned herself on the <b>good</b> <b>side</b> after learning the truth about her past and her real family. A disfigured clone of Kitana, given the name Mileena, was introduced as Kitana's twin sister to become a prominent archrival in the original game series' timeline.|$|E

25|$|The {{start of}} the 20th century brought a decline in Surrey's fortunes, and they won the title only once during the next fifty years, in 1914. At the request of Surrey's captain Lord Dalmeny, the Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII) allowed {{the use of his}} {{feathers}} on the club badge. The club's most famous player was Jack Hobbs, who began playing for the county in 1905, and he had a notable opening partner till 1914 in Tom Hayward, who scored 3,518 runs in all first-class cricket in 1906, equalled C.B. Fry's record of 13 centuries in a season and, in one six-day period, scored two centuries at Trent Bridge and two more at Leicester. He scored his hundredth hundred at The Oval in 1913. Between the two world wars, Surrey often had a <b>good</b> <b>side,</b> but it tended to be stronger in batting than in bowling; Hobbs played until 1934 with another good opening partner in Andrew Sandham. Hobbs scored more runs (61,760) and compiled more centuries (199) in first-class cricket than any other player {{in the history of the}} game. In recognition of his contribution to the team, the eponymous Jack Hobbs Gates were inaugurated at The Oval.|$|E

Hagrid is attacked by giants during the mission, and saved by Maxime. Hagrid and Maxime eventually part on the journey home because of Maxime’s exasperation with Grawp, Hagrid’s half-brother whom he had found and was attempting to bring home with them. Grawp, who wanted to stay with the giants, seriously injured Hagrid. Hagrid introduces his half-brother to Harry and Hermione, and asks them to take care of him after he leaves Hogwarts. High Inquisitor of Hogwarts Dolores Umbridge supervises the classes of all the members of the Hogwarts staff, including Hagrid's, and she looks for an excuse to fire him, as Hagrid is close to Dumbledore. Towards the end of the book, Umbridge and other Ministry officials attempt to arrest Hagrid. The latter manages to escape, but Professor McGonagall is injured whilst trying to defend him. Finally, with Dumbledore’s post as Headmaster restored, Hagrid returns to Hogwarts.|$|E

Burns has said commented the episode [...] "ended up being incredibly short because when you do an episode where there's really just one <b>good</b> <b>side</b> of an argument , you don't fill out {{as much time as}} you need to."

500|$|In the off-season, the Islanders {{selected}} goaltender Rick DiPietro {{with the}} first overall pick in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft. DiPietro's selection supplanted Luongo as the highest-drafted goaltender in NHL history and the Islanders' goaltender of the future. Consequently, Milbury traded Luongo to the Florida Panthers along with centre Olli Jokinen for winger Mark Parrish and centre Oleg Kvasha that same day on June 24, 2000. The deal would later be seen to have disproportionately benefited the Panthers, as both Jokinen and Luongo would eventually develop into star players, in contrast to Parrish and Kvasha. Luongo expressed surprise at the trade, saying, [...] "I didn't expect it at all. One day they're telling me I'm the goalie of the future, {{and the next day}} I'm gone.

500|$|The {{characters}} Hepburn played were, {{with very}} few exceptions, wealthy and intelligent, and often strong and independent. These tough characters tended to be humbled in some form and revealed to have a hidden vulnerability. Garson Kanin described what he called [...] "the formula for a Hepburn success: A high-class, or stuck-up ... girl is brought down to earth by an earthy type, or a lowbrow ... or a cataclysmic situation. It seems to have worked time and time again." [...] Due to this repeated character arc, Britton sees Hepburn as embodying the [...] "contradictions" [...] of the [...] "nature and status of women", as the strong females she depicts are eventually [...] "restored to a safe position within the status quo". Film critic Molly Haskell has commented {{on the importance of}} this to Hepburn's career: with an intimidating presence, it was necessary that her characters [...] "do some kind of self-abasement, to stay on the <b>good</b> <b>side</b> of the audience." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his history}} of the club, Peter Wynne-Thomas {{describes}} MacLaren as the dominant figure in Lancashire cricket from his debut until the First World War. Gibson accepts that MacLaren was tactically a good captain, but observes that in his 12 seasons as leader of a strong Lancashire team, he only once won the County Championship. In addition, as the appointed captain in four series against Australia, he was beaten in each one, something no other England captain has repeated. Gibson suggests that [...] "the excuses begin to run thin, sieved through such a tale of failure." [...] Gibson summarises that [...] "England under MacLaren {{must have been a}} <b>good</b> <b>side</b> to watch, save for the passionate partisans, but an uncomfortable side in which to play... Bad captain or no, with no doubt... MacLaren {{was one of the most}} entrancing, one of the most glamorous—though that word had not come into fashion in his day—characters of his cricketing epoch." ...|$|E

Sarah Moolla of The People branded her [...] "superficial", the Daily Record Merle Brown referred to her as [...] "a true [...] female, and Emma Johnson of the Liverpool Echo assessed that she had a [...] "couldn't-care-less" [...] attitude. BBC America described Steph as a two-sided character.
