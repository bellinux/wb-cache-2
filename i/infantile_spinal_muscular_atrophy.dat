50|$|Among {{the various}} {{disorders}} {{associated with the}} ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is X-linked <b>infantile</b> <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> (XL-SMA). The fatal childhood disorder is associated with loss of anterior horn cells and infantile death. Clinical features include hypotonia, areflexia, and multiple congenital contractures. In a large-scale mutation analysis, screening of six XL-SMA families provided results indicating two novel missense mutations in two families and a novel synonymous C->T substitution in another three familiesfootnote. All of these detected mutations were located in exon 15 of the UBE1 gene (the gene encoding ubiquitin-activating enzyme) and were observed to segregate with disease in the families. In brevity, UBE1 missense {{may lead to a}} disturbed complex building with gigaxonin, a protein involved in axonal structure and neuronal maintenance. This can lead to impaired degradation of microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B), resulting in the build-up of MAP1B protein, which may enhance neuronal cell death. Thus, mutations in UBE1 are suspected to be the cause of genetic defects in XL-SMA individuals.|$|E

40|$|Background: In humans, {{mutations}} in the enzyme glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GARS) cause motor and sensory axon {{loss in the}} peripheral nervous system, and clinical phenotypes ranging from Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy to a severe <b>infantile</b> form of <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy.</b> GARS is ubiquitously expressed and may have functions {{in addition to its}} canonical role in protein synthesis through catalyzing the addition of glycine to cognate tRNAs. Methodology/Principal Findings: We have recently described a new mouse model with a point mutation in the Gars gene resulting in a cysteine to arginine change at residue 201. Heterozygous Gars C 201 R/+ mice have locomotor and sensory deficits. In an investigation of genetic mutations that lead to death of motor and sensory neurons, we have crossed the Gars C 201 R/+ mice to two other mutants: the TgSOD 1 G 93 A model of human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and the Legs at odd angles mouse (Dync 1 h 1 Loa) which has a defect in the heavy chain of the dynein complex. We found the Dync 1 h 1 Loa/+; Gars C 201 R/+ double heterozygous mice are more impaired than either parent, and this is may be an additive effect of both mutations. Surprisingly, the Gars C 201 R mutation significantly delayed disease onset in the SOD 1 G 93 A;Gars C 201 R/+ double heterozygous mutant mice and increased lifespan by 29 % on the genetic background investigated. Conclusions/Significance: These findings raise intriguing possibilities for the study of pathogenetic mechanisms in all thre...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundSpinal <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> {{is a rare}} {{genetic disease}} with devastating {{neurodegenerative}} consequences. Timing of diagnosis is crucial for <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> because early diagnosis may lead to early supportive care and reduction in patient and caregiver stress. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the published literature for diagnostic delay in <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy.</b> MethodsA systematic literature search was conducted in the PubMed and Web of Science databases for studies published between 2000 and 2014 that listed any type of <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> and without molecular, mouse, or pathology in the keywords. Mean and/or median age of onset and diagnosis and delay in diagnosis was extracted or calculated. All estimates were weighted by the number of patients and descriptive statistics are reported. ResultsA total of 21 studies were included in the final analysis. The weighted mean (standard deviation) ages of onset were 2. 5 (0. 6), 8. 3 (1. 6), and 39. 0 (32. 6) months for <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> types I, II, and III, respectively, and the weighted mean (standard deviation) ages of confirmed <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> genetic diagnosis were 6. 3 (2. 2), 20. 7 (2. 6), and 50. 3 (12. 9) months, respectively, for types I, II, and III. For studies reporting both age of onset and diagnosis, the weighted diagnostic delay was 3. 6, 14. 3, and 43. 6  months for types I, II, and III, respectively. ConclusionsDiagnostic delay is common in <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy.</b> The length of delay varied by severity (type) of <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy.</b> Further studies evaluating this delay and tools such as newborn screening are warranted to end the diagnostic delay in <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy...</b>|$|R

The segregation ratio (Weinberg Proband method) was 0. 29 for all index cases, and 0. 26 for all cases excluding those referred specifically to a genetic counselling clinic.

40|$|<b>Spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> is {{distinct}} among neurodegenerative {{conditions of the}} motor neuron, with onset in developing and maturing patients. Furthermore, the rate of degeneration appears to slow over time, {{at least in the}} milder forms. To investigate disease pathophysiology and potential adaptations, the present study utilized axonal excitability studies to provide insights into axonal biophysical properties and explored correlation with clinical severity. Multiple excitability indices (stimulus–response curve, strength–duration time constant, threshold electrotonus, current–threshold relationship and recovery cycle) were investigated in 25 genetically characterized adolescent and adult patients with <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy,</b> stimulating the median motor nerve at the wrist. Results were compared with 50 age-matched controls. The Medical Research Council sum score and <b>Spinal</b> <b>Muscular</b> <b>Atrophy</b> Functional Rating Scale were used to define the strength and motor functional status of patients with <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy.</b> In patients with <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy,</b> there were reductions in compound muscle action potential amplitude (P[*]<[*] 0. 0005) associated with reduction in stimulus response slope (P[*]<[*] 0. 0005), confirming significant axonal loss. In the patients with mild or ambulatory <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy,</b> there was reduction of peak amplitude without alteration in axonal excitability; in contrast, in the non-ambulatory or severe <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> cohort prominent changes in axonal function were apparent. Specifically, there were steep changes in the early phase of hyperpolarization in threshold electrotonus (P[*]<[*] 0. 0005) that correlated with clinical severity. Additionally, there were greater changes in depolarizing threshold electrotonus (P[*]<[*] 0. 0005) and prolongation of the strength-duration time constant (P[*]=[*] 0. 001). Mathematical modelling of the excitability changes obtained in patients with severe <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> supported a mixed pathology comprising features of axonal degeneration and regeneration.

40|$|Background: <b>Spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> is an {{autosomal}} recessive disorder characterized by degeneration of anterior horn {{cells in the}} spinal cord leading to progressive <b>muscular</b> weakness and <b>atrophy.</b> The <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> candidate interval genes including survival motor neuron, the responsible gene in <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> phenotype expression, neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein, and P 44, potential modifying genes, are located on chromosome 5 q 13 in two highly homologous copies (telomeric and centromeric) within the <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> region. Methods: In this study, the neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein gene deletion was analyzed in 34 <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> families, with the consanguinity rate of 65 % (22 / 34), in whom exon 7 of the survival motor neuron- 1 gene was already confirmed and was deleted in 79 % of the affected individuals. Deletion analysis of exons 5, 6, and 13 of the neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein-t gene {{was carried out in}} our samples. Results: We found 80 % neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein gene deletion in 5 q-spinal <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> patients (91 % <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> atrophy-I, 50 % <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> atrophy-II and-III), and in 5 % (two of fourty) of <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> parents. All the neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein-deleted samples also lacked the survival motor neuron- 1 gene. Conclusion: The neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein gene deletion in <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> atrophy-I was higher than the other <b>spinal</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>atrophy</b> types. The high frequency of neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein deletion most likely reflects a higher frequency of survival motor neuron- 1 deletions compared with survival motor neuron- 1 to survival motor neuron- 2 gene conversion in this population...|$|R

The diagnoses using clinical, muscle biopsy, and laboratory charac-teristics were: 25 central hypotonia, 20 {{spinal muscular atrophy}}, 20 myopathy, four myotonic dystrophy, four benign con-genital hypotonia, two congenital muscular dystrophy, two myasthenia gravis, one infantile inflammatory myopathy, and one arthrogryposis multiplex congenita. Using strict criteria, electromyography accurately predicted the final diagno-sis in 65 % of infants with spinal muscular atrophy and {{was consistent with the}} diagnosis in another 25 %.

To identify the XL-SMA disease gene, we performed large-scale mutation analysis in genes located between markers DXS 8080 and DXS 7132 (Xp 11. 3 –Xq 11. 1). This resulted in detection of three rare novel variants in exon 15 of UBE 1 that segregate with disease: two missense mutations (c. 1617 G→T, p. Met 539 Ile; c. 1639 A→G, p. Ser 547 Gly) present each in one XL-SMA family, and one synonymous C→T substitution (c. 1731 C→T, p. Asn 577 Asn) identified in another three unrelated families. Absence of the missense mutations was demonstrated for 3550 and {{absence of the}} synonymous mutation was shown in 7914 control X chromosomes; therefore, these results yielded statistical significant evidence for the association of the synonymous substitution and the two missense mutations with XL-SMA (p = 2. 416 × 10 − 10, p = 0. 001815). We also demonstrated that the synonymous C→T substitution leads to significant reduction of UBE 1 expression and alters the methylation pattern of exon 15, implying a plausible role of this DNA element in developmental UBE 1 expression in humans.

40|$|Neurodegenerative {{diseases}} cause tremendous {{suffering for}} those afflicted and their families. Many of these diseases involve accumulation of mis-folded or aggregated proteins thought {{to play a}} causal role in disease pathology. Ubiquitinated proteins are often found in these protein aggregates, and the aggregates themselves {{have been shown to}} inhibit the activity of the proteasome. These and other alterations in the Ubiquitin Pathway observed in neurodegenerative diseases have led {{to the question of whether}} impairment of the Ubiquitin Pathway on its own can increase mortality or if ongoing neurodegeneration alters Ubiquitin Pathway function as a side-effect. To address the role of the Ubiquitin Pathway in vivo, we studied loss-of-function mutations in the Drosophila Ubiquitin Activating Enzyme, Uba 1 or E 1, the most upstream enzyme in the Ubiquitin Pathway. Loss of only one functional copy of E 1 caused a significant reduction in adult lifespan. Rare homozygous hypomorphic E 1 mutants reached adulthood. These mutants exhibited further reduced lifespan and showed inappropriate Ras activation in the brain. Removing just one functional copy of Ras restored the lifespan of heterozygous E 1 mutants to that of wild-type flies and increased the survival of homozygous E 1 mutants. E 1 homozygous mutants also showed severe motor impairment. Our findings suggest that processes that impair the Ubiquitin Pathway are sufficient to cause early mortality. Reduced lifespan and motor impairment are seen in the human disease X-linked <b>Infantile</b> <b>Spinal</b> <b>Muscular</b> <b>Atrophy,</b> which is associated with mutation in human E 1 warranting further analysis of these mutants as a potential animal model for study of this disease...|$|E
