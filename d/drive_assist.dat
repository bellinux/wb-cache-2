50|$|The latest {{application}} of the VVT engine in the 2016 Proton Persona and Proton Saga features Proton's ECO <b>Drive</b> <b>Assist</b> program. The system assesses the driver's throttle input, and a green indicator on the instrument cluster will light up when the car is being driven in an economical manner.|$|E
5000|$|As {{part of the}} refresh, the new S5 has {{undergone}} some major front and rear end changes, including a drop in weight to 1,615 kilograms (Coupé) and a complete redesign of the headlights and bonnet, LED front and rear lighting, sharper body lines, and a new larger one piece grille. There are also a number of optional safety options available such as <b>drive</b> <b>assist</b> and head up display.|$|E
50|$|At launch, four {{variants}} {{of the new}} Persona were made available, namely the Standard MT, Standard CVT, Executive CVT and Premium CVT. All BH Persona variants come standard with Proton's Vehicle Dynamic Control (VDC) safety net, ECO <b>Drive</b> <b>Assist,</b> front and rear parking sensors and 15-inch alloy rims among others. The various trim levels differ mainly in terms of kit and cosmetic enhancements, and are otherwise mechanically identical {{with the exception of}} the airbag count.|$|E
50|$|Advanced <b>Driving</b> <b>Assist</b> System package (available for Tourer) {{includes}} {{blind spot}} warning, traffic sign recognition, {{lane departure warning}} and active city braking.|$|R
50|$|The Lancaster ADA (Active <b>Driving</b> <b>Assist)</b> was {{introduced}} in September 1999. The system featured two CCD cameras mounted {{either side of the}} rear-view mirror. The system was installed on 2.5L models with VDC and then later in 2000 on the newer Lancaster 6 VDC models.|$|R

50|$|The fuel {{efficiency}} of the station wagon and its hybrid variant was enhanced {{to be the same}} as that of Fit and Fit hybrid by reducing engine friction, front brake rolling resistance, improvement in aerodynamics and improvement of control {{efficiency of the}} hybrid system. All models feature ECON Mode for enhancing real-world fuel economy. Hybrid model has Eco Assist (Ecological <b>Drive</b> <b>Assist</b> System) to help the driver engage in fuel-efficient driving practices. It went on sale on June 16, 2011, in Japan.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of the various {{refinements}} made to the engine and transmission combination in the new Saga, Proton claims that fuel efficiency has improved by 10% to 5.4L/100 km with the manual, and by 11% to 5.6L/100 km with the CVT, both at a constant speed of 90 km/h. The new Saga is the second Proton model to utilise the company's new ECO <b>Drive</b> <b>Assist</b> feature. The system assesses the driver's throttle input, and a green indicator on the instrument cluster will light up when the car is being driven in an economical manner.|$|E
50|$|Proton {{has also}} fitted a new CVT gear lever with a side-mounted release switch and a {{headlight}} levelling dial {{which can be}} used to re-calibrate the front beam projection when the car is fully loaded. The driver's instrument cluster is largely unchanged over the Iriz, but it now features Proton's new ECO <b>Drive</b> <b>Assist</b> system, an indicator which lights up in green when the car is being driven in an economical manner. The speedometer and tachometer graphics are also new, and the central LCD screen is now lit in blue, compared to the Iriz's red. The instrument cluster housing is also finished in a glossy grey coat, as opposed to matte black in the Iriz.|$|E
50|$|On 30 August 1888, Lord Walsingham had a {{remarkable}} day shooting on Blubberhouses Moor, Yorkshire when he killed 1070 grouse. The day started at 05:12 {{with the first}} of twenty <b>drives,</b> <b>assisted</b> by two teams of forty beaters, two loaders and three guns. During the sixteenth drive he shot 94 grouse in 21 minutes; a killing rate of one every 13 seconds. The last drive finished at 18:45 and his Lordship managed to shoot fourteen on the walk home.|$|R
2500|$|Florida {{responded with}} a 67-yard scoring <b>drive,</b> <b>assisted</b> by a 15-yard pass {{interference}} penalty and 15-yard personal foul penalty called consecutively against Arkansas. The CBS broadcasting team said that the calls were both [...] "questionable". Top-ranked Florida tied the game at 20. The officiating crew was suspended by the Southeastern Conference the following week, and remained on suspension until November 14. Florida coach Urban Meyer later said that the SEC was right by suspending the crew, and Bobby Petrino was reprimanded by the SEC for publicly criticizing the crew after the contest.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{the approach of}} an applicable safety driving methodology for human drivers based on Dynamic Window Approach (DWA), as an implementation of Advanced <b>Driving</b> <b>Assist</b> Systems (ADASs). The human driving behaviors are modelled {{for the design of}} controller, refined by referential paths using evasive trajectory model, and the linear and angular velocities are limited and corrected by DWA which performed as an obstacle avoidance strategy. Results of trajectory following and obstacle avoidance are compared with the visual servoing (VS) controller as a corresponding approach of autonomous control pattern...|$|R
50|$|Several {{interior}} {{parts and}} {{components in the}} new Saga were borrowed from other Proton models {{in an effort to}} increase economies of scale and reduce costs and pricing. These include the steering wheel, CVT gear lever and driver's power window controls on all variants, as well as the Premium-exclusive double-DIN head unit and integrated rear view mirror display. The notable carryovers from the second generation Saga include the air-con controls, handbrake lever and manual gear knob. The driver's instrument cluster is largely unchanged, but the meter graphics have been updated, and the HUD now includes Proton's ECO <b>Drive</b> <b>Assist</b> system, an indicator which lights up in green when the car is being driven in an economical manner.|$|E
50|$|Like the Iriz, the new Persona is paired {{to either}} a Getrag 5-speed manual or a Punch Powertrain VT2+ CVT. However, Proton has refined the Punch CVT for a {{smoother}} drive, and in its latest iteration is claimed {{to be far more}} responsive and has narrowed the gap to its competitors. As a result of the various refinements made to the engine and transmission combination in the BH Persona, Proton claims that fuel efficiency has improved by 13% to 5.6L/100 km with the manual, and by 10% to 6.1L/100 km with the CVT, both at a constant speed of 90 km/h. The BH Persona is the first Proton model to utilise the company's new ECO <b>Drive</b> <b>Assist</b> feature. The system assesses the driver's throttle input, and a green indicator on the instrument cluster will light up when the car is being driven in an economical manner. The engine in the new BH is also VVT-enabled, while its old CM counterpart was not. The BH has a 40-litre fuel tank, 10-litres smaller than the CM.|$|E
40|$|Vehicle {{detectors}} {{have been}} installed at approximately every 300 meters on each lane on Tokyo metropolitan expressway. Various traffic data such as traffic volume, average speed and time occupancy are collected by vehicle detectors. We can understand traffic characteristics of every point by comparing traffic data collected at consecutive points. In this study, {{we focused on}} average speed, analyzed road potential by operating speed during free-flow conditions, and identified latent bottlenecks. Furthermore, we analyzed effects for road potential by the rainfall level and day of the week. It’s expected that this method of analysis will be utilized for installation of ITS such as <b>drive</b> <b>assist,</b> estimation of parameters for traffic simulation and feedback to road design as congestion measures...|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, many pedelec (and e-bike) users {{report that they}} can ride more defensively with the {{auxiliary}} electric <b>drive</b> <b>assisting</b> them; unlike traditional bicyclists that tend to be averse to braking since this incurs effort to accelerate again, a pedelec rider can brake and then accelerate back to a normal speed with much less effort. The Bavarian accident statistics {{for the first half}} of 2012 lists 6,186 accidents involving bicycles, of which 76 are e-bikes and notes that the accident risk of e-bikes is not higher than for other bicycles.|$|R

40|$|One {{aspect of}} tissue {{engineering}} of skeletal muscle involves the transposition and transplantation of whole muscles to treat muscles damaged by injury or disease. The transposition of whole muscles {{has been used}} for many decades, but since 1970, the development of techniques for microneurovascular repair has allowed the transplantation of muscles invariably result in structural and functional deficits. The deficits are of the greatest magnitude during the first month, and then a gradual recovery results in the stabilization of structural and functional variables between 90 and 120 days. In stabilized vascularized grafts ranging from 1 to 3 g in rats to 90 g in dogs, the major deficits are ∼ 25 % decrease in muscle mass and in most grafts ∼ 40 % decrease in maximum force. The decrease in power is more complex because it depends on both the average shortening force and the velocity of shortening. As a consequence, the deficit in maximum power may be either greater or less than the deficit in maximum force. Tenotomy and repair are the major factors responsible for the deficits. Although the data are limited, skeletal muscle grafts appear to respond to training stimuli in a manner no different from that of control muscles. The training stimuli include traditional methods of endurance and strength training, as well as chronic electrical stimulation. Transposed and transplanted muscles develop sufficient force and power to function effectively to: maintain posture; move limbs; sustain the patency of sphincters; partially restore symmetry in the face; or serve as, or <b>drive,</b> <b>assist</b> devices in parallel or in series with the heart...|$|E

25|$|EyeSight is Subaru's {{active safety}} system that uses twin CCD cameras, {{simulating}} stereoscopic vision. It {{was first introduced}} in Japan only as Active <b>Driving</b> <b>Assist</b> (ADA) in 1999. When activated, it actively monitors the road through the windshield-mounted cameras, and can react to driving conditions and possibly avert collisions. Models equipped with EyeSight earned the highest possible rating in the IIHS front crash safety test. Unlike other manufacturers offering stereoscopic cameras for drivers-asset purposes, the Eyesight system's cameras are not bonded to the windshield. Thus, if the windshield is dirty on the inside, it may affect the system's performance.|$|R
50|$|Margaret Gray’s time as Chairperson was {{distinguished}} {{with the}} production and delivery of Ailie’s Garden, the biodiversity and play area {{at the rear of}} the Smith in 2002. A membership <b>drive,</b> <b>assisted</b> with the first colour-printed Friends leaflet, took the membership to over 900, a significant achievement for a small museum. Moira Lawson who became Chair in 2004 was heavily involved in the fund raising and project management for Ailie’s Garden, as well as in the fundraising for the purchase of the Wallace painting. Her culinary skills are important in providing the special social events which punctuate the Smith’s year - the exhibition openings, celebrations and children’s events.|$|R

5000|$|On 2008-05-08, Subaru {{announced}} the EyeSight models for Japanese market. It consists of 2 CCD cameras with {{one on each}} side of the rear-view mirror, that use human-like stereoscopic vision to judge distances and generally keep tabs on the driver. The system included the ability to help the driver maintain distance on the highway, a lane departure warning system, a wake up call alerting the driver to a change in traffic signals, and pedestrian detection. SI-Cruise has been integrated into the EyeSight feature as a driver safety aid. EyeSight was a new brand name for a safety system Subaru had previously introduced in Japan only in the 1999 Subaru Lancaster (Outback) called Active <b>Driving</b> <b>Assist</b> (ADA) ...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, the {{eco-driving}} technique represent {{one possible}} mean {{to reduce the}} energy consumption and the pollutants emission of vehicles. Besides the very low investment needed for such an option, its suitability to be applied even to old vehicles makes its impact important and immediate. The work presented here aims to quantify in a first approach the potential gain allowable by an eco-driving behavior for a given vehicle using numerical optimization methods (only the case of conventional ICE based vehicle is detailed in this paper). Then, an Advanced <b>Driving</b> <b>Assist</b> System (ADAS) based on the proposed optimization has been designed and tested.

25|$|The Buccaneers' only score came on Cedric Brown's 80-yard {{return of}} a Steve DeBerg interception, which tied the score at 7–7 in the third quarter. Denver responded with an 80-yard <b>drive,</b> <b>assisted</b> by Norris Thomas' two {{personal}} fouls against Rick Upchurch. The Broncos {{then went on to}} score on their next two possessions. DeBerg played in relief of Craig Morton, who left the game with a sprained shoulder in the second quarter. The Broncos were able to efficiently control the ball through short-yardage gains. Their quarterbacks were a combined 20 of 29 for 143 yards passing, while their backs ran 41 times for 153 yards. Jimmie Giles passed Morris Owens to become the leading receiver in Buccaneer history, while the ground game was held under 50 yards for the fourth time in the season. Despite their 5–6 record, the Buccaneers held the tiebreaker advantage over the other six teams tied with them for the final wild-card playoff slot.|$|R
