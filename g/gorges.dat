5|$|In {{the early}} 1600s, England was {{at peace with}} France and Spain, and the country's coastal defences {{received}} little attention. The <b>Gorges</b> family continued as captains at Hurst, with Sir Edward <b>Gorges</b> taking up the post in 1610, but the castle was neglected. In 1628, the castle was unable to prevent Flemish ships from passing along the Solent, as only {{four or five of}} the castle's twenty-seven guns were functional, and the fort had no ammunition or powder for them. The government replaced all the brass ordnance in the castle, which were preferred, particularly on ships, as they could fire faster and more safely, with iron guns in 1635.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the Variscan mountain-building, the Mendip area now {{comprises}} at least four anticlinal fold structures, with an east-west trend, each with a core of older Devonian sandstone and Silurian volcanic rocks. The latter are quarried for use in road construction and as a concrete aggregate. The Mendips were considerably higher and steeper 200 to 300million years ago, and subsequent erosion has resulted in a range of surface features including <b>gorges,</b> dry valleys, screes, swallets and others typical of karst landscapes. These are complemented underground by a large number of caves both beneath the plateau and {{at the base of the}} southern escarpment. Wookey Hole is one example of the caves of the area. There are also areas of limestone pavement and other karst features. Dissolution of the limestone produced many of the <b>gorges</b> including Cheddar Gorge and Burrington Combe. Springs are a common feature of the eastern part of the hills, a number of which have associated tufa deposits.|$|E
