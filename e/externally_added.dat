40|$|Posttranslational {{modifications}} {{and structural}} alterations of protein synthesis elongation factor Tu in Actinomyces {{in relation to}} their life cycle Protein synthesis elongation factor Tu represents a multifunctional protein with potential role in signaling and regulation of cell metabolism. The complex life cycle of Streptomycetes requires monitoring of changes in their environment and signaling pathways to control it. Here we present the results of analysis of membrane phosphoproteomes from individual morphological stages of Streptomyces coelicolor with the aim to follow developmentally dependent heterogeneity and phosphorylation of intrinsic and <b>externally</b> <b>added</b> Strepomyces aureofaciens EF-Tu in membrane proteomes. We used Mycobacterium smegmatis, fast growing non-pathogenic Mycobacterium, as a non-differentiating actinomycete comparative model. Phosphorylation of intrinsic M. smegmatis and <b>externally</b> <b>added</b> Streptomyces EF-Tu was followed in membrane proteomes from exponential and stationary phase of M. smegmatis liquid culture. We have found that Streptomycetes membrane fraction contains protein kinase(s) catalyzing phosphorylation of both, its own, and an <b>externally</b> <b>added</b> EF-Tu, whereas Mycobacterium membrane fraction contains protein kinase phosphorylating only its own EF-Tu.

We use these estimates to judge the security of some proposed schemes, and we suggest more efficient schemes.

40|$|Abstract: Maxim's PFM boost {{controllers}} offer {{high efficiency}} and low quiescent current; however, by <b>externally</b> <b>adding</b> a current mode signal into the feedback, {{the stability and}} output ripple are improved. This circuit connection requires no additional ICs or components versus the standard connection. A control scheme used in certain boost-controller ICs from Maxim (current-limited pulse-frequency modulation, or PFM), achieves high efficiency {{over a wide range}} of output current by combining the low quiescent current of PFM with the load-driving capability of pulse-width modulation (PWM). To provide current-mode control as well, simply connect the load, output filter capacitor, and lower feedback resistor to the current-sense pin (CS) instead of ground (Figure 1). Figure 1. This circuit adds current-mode operation to Maxim's current-limited PFM boost controllers without increasing the quiescent current. When operating with medium to heavy loads, the Figure 1 circuit exhibits lower output ripple and a more stable inductor current (Figure 2 a) than do the standard application circuits represented by typical waveforms in Figure 2 b. The improvements gained by these connections have no effect on the quiescent current and require no additional circuitry, but they do require separate input and output grounds as shown, connected only by RSENSE...|$|R

The oxidation rate was increased by about 20 % in a hypotonic reaction mixture. The thylakoid fraction also oxidized the flavonol in the presence of H 2 O 2, and the rate was about 25 % of that by intact chloroplasts. The oxidation of quercetin was inhibited by KCN and NaN 3. Ascorbate, which permeates slowly across chloroplast envelope, only slightly suppressed the initial rate of quercetin oxidation by intact chloroplasts, while the oxidation by ruptured chloroplasts was suppressed by ascorbate by about 60 %. Quercetin glycosides, quercitrin and rutin, were also oxidized by chloroplasts in the presence of H 2 O 2.

40|$|The autolytic enzyme (an N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanine amidase) of a {{clinical}} isolate, strain 101 / 87, which {{is classified as}} an atypical pneumococcus, has been studied for the first time. The lytA 101 gene coding for this amidase (LYTA 101) has been cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli. The LYTA 101 amidase has been purified and shown {{to be similar to}} the main autolytic enzyme (LYTA) present in the wild-type strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae, although it exhibits a lower specific activity, a higher sensitivity to inhibition by free choline, and a modified thermosensitivity with respect to LYTA. Most important, in contrast with the LYTA amidase, the activity of the LYTA 101 amidase was inhibited by sodium deoxycholate. This property is most probably responsible of the deoxycholate-insensitive phenotype shown by strain 101 / 87. Phenotypic curing of strain 101 / 87 by <b>externally</b> <b>adding</b> purified LYTA or LYTA 101 amidase restored in this strain some typical characteristics of the wild-type strain of pneumococcus (e. g., formation of diplo cells and sensitization to lysis by sodium deoxycholate), although the amount of the LYTA 101 amidase required to restore these properties was much higher than {{in the case of the}} LYTA amidase.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Incremental {{threshold}} loading (ITL) {{is a test}} of inspiratory muscle performance {{which is}} usually performed by breathing through a weighted inspiratory plunger, the load on the inspiratory muscles being increased by <b>externally</b> <b>adding</b> weights to the intake valve. This is not a true threshold device and may be inaccurate. This method was compared with a true threshold device consisting of a solenoid valve which only opens to supply air at a predetermined negative mouth pressure. METHODS [...] Six naive, normal subjects (three men and three women) aged 22 - 24 years underwent three tests using each system. The inspiratory loads were increased every minute by equivalent amounts, - 10 cm H 2 O with the solenoid valve and by 50 g with the weighted plunger, until the subjects could not inspire or sustain inspiration for a full minute. Six experienced subjects (four men and two women) aged 23 - 41 years were subsequently randomised to perform ITL with the solenoid valve, twice with the breathing pattern fixed and twice free. RESULTS [...] The solenoid valve generated a more accurate mouth pressure response and was less variable at higher loads than the weighted plunger. The work performed (expressed as the pressure-time product) was less with the solenoid valve but was more reproducible. ITL with the solenoid valve was not influenced by controlling the breathing pattern of the subjects. CONCLUSIONS [...] The solenoid valve has several features that make it superior to the weighted plunger as a device for ITL. It generates a more accurate mouth pressure response which is less variable at higher loads. Increases in load are smoother and quicker to introduce. ITL with the solenoid valve is not influenced by varying breathing patterns and does not require any external regulation...|$|R

Although vancomycin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains {{have not been}} isolated, reports on the emergence of vancomycin-tolerant pneumococci are a cause of concern. To date, the molecular basis of vancomycin tolerance in S. pneumoniae is essentially unknown. We examined two vancomycin-tolerant clinical isolates, i. e. a purported autolysin negative (LytA-), serotype 23 F isolate (strain S 3) and the serotype 14 strain ‘Tupelo’, which is considered a paradigm of vancomycin tolerance. S 3 was characterized here as carrying a frameshift mutation in the lytA gene encoding the main pneumococcal autolysin. The vancomycin tolerance of strain S 3 was abolished by transformation to the autolysin-proficient phenotype. The original Tupelo strain was discovered to be a mixture: a strain showing a vancomycin-tolerant phenotype (Tupelo_VT) and a vancomycin-nontolerant strain (Tupelo_VNT). The two strains differed {{only in terms of}} a single mutation in the ciaH gene present in the VT strain. Most interestingly, although the vancomycin tolerance of Tupelo_VT could be overcome by increasing the LytA dosage upon transformation by a multicopy plasmid or by <b>externally</b> <b>adding</b> the autolysin, we show that vancomycin tolerance in S. pneumoniae requires the simultaneous presence of a mutated CiaH histidine kinase and capsular polysaccharide.
