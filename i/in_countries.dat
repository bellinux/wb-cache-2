5|$|Child {{marriage}} (including {{union or}} cohabitation) {{is defined as}} marriage {{under the age of}} eighteen and is an ancient custom. In 2010 it was estimated that 67 million women, then, in their twenties had been married before they turned eighteen, and that 150 million would be in the next decade, equivalent to 15 million per year. This number had increased to 70 million by 2012. In developing countries one third of girls are married under age, and 1:9 before 15. The practice is commonest in South Asia (48% of women), Africa (42%) and Latin America and the Caribbean (29%). The highest prevalence is in Western and Sub-Saharan Africa. The percentage of girls married before the age of eighteen is as high as 75% <b>in</b> <b>countries</b> such as Niger (Nour, Table I). Most child marriage involves girls. For instance in Mali the ratio of girls to boys is 72:1, while <b>in</b> <b>countries</b> such as the United States the ratio is 8:1. Marriage may occur as early as birth, with the girl being sent to her husbands home as early as age seven.|$|E

5|$|Falk, Heine, Takemura, Zhang and Hsu {{investigated}} {{the validity of}} implicit self-esteem measures to assess cultural differences. They subjected Canadian and Japanese participants {{to a series of}} tests, one of which was rating the numbers to 40 by how much participants liked them. Because the researchers saw little to no correlation between the various implicit self-esteem measures, they did not draw any conclusions about cultural differences. Stieger and Krizan explored cross-cultural differences in number preferences, specifically the day on which Christmas is celebrated as a contributor to number preference. They asked participants from six countries to rate numbers between 1 and 36. They found that <b>in</b> <b>countries</b> where gifts are exchanged on 24 December participants disproportionately preferred the number 24, whereas <b>in</b> <b>countries</b> that do this on 25 December participants preferred 25. They concluded that cultural influences need {{to be taken into account}} if these preferences are used to reflect individual differences.|$|E

40|$|The primary {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} the number of complications following locking plate fixation of proximal humeral fractures <b>in</b> <b>country</b> X and <b>in</b> <b>country</b> Y. The secondary aim was to identify risk factors for complications. Multicentre retrospective case series of 282 consecutive patients with proximal humeral fractures, treated with a locking plate between 2010 and 2014. Setting: two level 1 trauma centres <b>in</b> <b>country</b> X and one <b>in</b> <b>country</b> Y. Data pertaining to demographics, postoperative complications and re-operations were collected. Fractures were classified according to the AO and Hertel classifications and experienced surgeons assessed the quality of reduction and plate fixation on the postoperative X-rays. Outcomes of the two different countries were compared and logistic regression analysis was performed to analyse the relationship between risk factors and complications. During a median follow-up of 370 days, 196 complications were encountered in 127 patients (45 %). The most frequent complications were: screw perforation in the glenohumeral joint (23 %), persistent shoulder complaints (16 %), avascular necrosis of the humeral head (10 %) and secondary fracture displacement (5 %). In 80 patients (28 %), 132 re-operations were performed. The patients operated <b>in</b> <b>country</b> X had significantly more complications compared with the patients operated <b>in</b> <b>country</b> Y. For implant-related complications, advanced age, non-anatomic reduction of the greater tuberosity, and country of operation were risk factors.

40|$|This chapter {{identifies}} {{a number}} of recent trends in European cross-border banking. The authors first distinguish between two main modes of international banking: cross-border versus multinational banking. Cross-border banking occurs when a bank <b>in</b> <b>country</b> A lends directly to a borrower <b>in</b> <b>country</b> B. Multinational banking, on the other hand, takes place when a bank <b>in</b> <b>country</b> A lends to a borrower <b>in</b> <b>country</b> B via a local bank affiliate (a branch or a subsidiary) <b>in</b> <b>country</b> B. The chapter describes which countries rely more on cross-border banking and which ones on multinational banking and assess how both forms of banking integration fared during the recent crises. The remainder of the chapter then focuses on trends in European banks’ funding structures, the source countries of cross-border and multinational banking, and the recent growth of corporate bond markets in Europe as an alternative to bank credit...|$|R
