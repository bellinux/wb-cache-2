In addition to these texts, the earliest letters on papyrus preserved to the present day also date to Djedkare's reign, dealing with administrative or private matters.|$|E
5|$|C. c. coronoides, the {{nominate}} or eastern subspecies, {{is found}} across most of eastern Australia. Its range is also {{highly correlated with}} the presence of sheep. This is thought to be because of the frequency of dead animals, which can be an <b>important</b> <b>source</b> of food. Ornithologist Ian Rowley held that the eastern subspecies was expanding eastwards before European colonisation, and that this suggested it was of younger origin than the western subspecies, which appears static. The advent of agriculture facilitated further spread.|$|E

5|$|Cowpeas {{thrive in}} poor dry conditions, growing well in soils up to 85% sand.

As {{well as an}} <b>important</b> <b>source</b> of food for humans in poor arid regions the crop {{can also be used}} as feed for livestock. Its nitrogen fixing ability means that as well as functioning as a sole-crop, the cowpea can be effectively intercropped with sorghum, millet, maize, cassava or cotton.|$|E
