50|$|Literature on {{historical}} records of birdlife {{of the region}} is very scanty. Forsyth's (1889) casual remarks indicated that several species like black-headed yellow bulbul (Pycnonotus melanicterus), painted spurfowl (Galloperdix lunulata), lesser adjutant (Leptoptilos javanicus), and Indian golden-backed three-toed woodpecker (Dinopium javanense) which are now found only in small restricted areas were apparently quite common and widespread around late 19th century. The recent rediscovery of the forest spotted owlet (Heteroglaux blewitti), endemic to Central Indian Highlands after about 114 years (Rasmussen 1998), underscores the significance of more avifaunal studies in the region for conservation planning. The forests of central India are {{also one of the}} few known refuges for several globally threatened and restricted-range species like Malabar pied <b>hornbill</b> (<b>Anthracoceros</b> coronatus), spotted grey creeper (Salpornis spilonotus), white-bellied minivet (Pericrocotus erythropygius), Asian brown flycatcher (Muscicapa dauurica) and green munia (Amandava formosa) (Ali & Ripley, 1983). A recent survey on breeding birds of Central Indian Highlands by Wildlife Institute of India (Jayapal et al., 2005) has added several new breeding records and range-extensions like crested goshawk (Accipiter trivirgatus), Oriental scops owl (Otus sunia), spot-bellied eagle owl (Bubo nipalensis), drongo-cuckoo (Surniculus lugubris), ashy drongo (Dicrurus leucophaeus), and striated grassbird (Megalurus palustris).|$|R
40|$|The Malabar Pied <b>Hornbill,</b> <b>Anthracoceros</b> coronatus, is a near {{threatened}} species, {{endemic to}} the tropical deciduous forests {{of central and}} southern India and Sri Lanka. The Dandeli region in Karnataka (India) {{is believed to be}} the last stronghold of this species in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot. Being a rapidly developing area with a growing human population, the threats to this species and their habitat are mounting, especially due to a large number of hydroelectric projects and habitat fragmentation caused by paper and plywood industries. This study evaluated the change in population status of the Malabar Pied Hornbill over a 23 year period and defined priorities for the long term conservation and monitoring of hornbills in Dandeli. Encounter rates of hornbills were also analysed in relation to the density and species richness of trees and fruiting trees, basal area, canopy cover and distance from river. Hornbill encounters were not significantly different compared to the earlier study carried out by Reddy in 1988, but were significantly different across the five sites in the current study. Higher numbers of hornbills were encountered closer to the river, but these results were only marginally significant. The mean numbers of hornbills recorded at the two roost sites identified in Dandeli were 26 +/- 4. 47 (n= 16 counts) and 31. 78 +/- 3. 53 (n= 14 counts) respectively. The study also helped build local awareness about the species, train local Forest Department staff in monitoring hornbills and develop a management plan for its conservation...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyze the concentration of mercury in fish consumed in Marabá, Brazil which is located close to the Serra Pelada gold mines. Methods: Fish species which have great economic impact on the city of Marabá were selected for study in a pilot research programme. The species sampled were collected from fish sold at the Feira da 28, were from the species Cichla spp, Mylossoma spp and Pimelodus spp. The samples were processed through the Allegra method. Results: The measured mercury concentrations were Cichla spp. I (0. 750 kg) 600 μg/kg, Cichla <b>spp.</b> <b>II</b> (1. 254 kg) 1000 μg/kg, Cichla spp III (2. 750 kg) < 2000 μg/kg; Mylossoma spp I (1. 300 kg) 100 μg/kg, Mylossoma <b>spp</b> <b>II</b> (2. 100 kg) < 300 μg/kg; Pimelodus spp I (0. 850 kg) 100 μg/kg, Pimelodus <b>spp</b> <b>II</b> (1. 050 kg) < 300 μg/kg. Conclusions: The concentrations of mercury in the fish samples analysed exceed the limits for consumption established by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Brazilian government. The semi quantitative Allegra method for determination of mercury in environmental samples is confirmed as a suitable alternative for environmental monitoring programs which are relevant to public health. More study is needed on the use of mercury and its by-products which can contaminate fish in the Amazon...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of cell-bound microcystins on the survival time and feeding rates of six Daphnia clones belonging to five common species was studied. To do this, {{the effects of}} the microcystin-producing Microcystis strain PCC 7806 and its mutant, which has been genetically engineered to knock out microcystin synthesis, were compared. Additionally, the relationship between microcystin ingestion rate by the Daphnia clones and Daphnia survival time was analyzed. Microcystins ingested with Microcystis cells were poisonous to all Daphnia clones tested. The median survival time of the animals was closely correlated to their microcystin ingestion rate. It was therefore suggested that differences in survival among Daphnia clones were due to variations in microcystin intake rather than due to differences in susceptibility to the toxins. The correlation between median survival time and microcystin ingestion rate could be described by a reciprocal power function. Feeding experiments showed that, independent of the occurrence of microcystins, cells of wild-type PCC 7806 and its mutant are able to inhibit the feeding activity of Daphnia. Both variants of PCC 7806 were thus ingested at low rates. In summary, our findings strongly suggest that (i) sensitivity to the toxic effect of cell-bound microcystins is typical for Daphnia <b>spp.,</b> (<b>ii)</b> Daphnia <b>spp.</b> and clones may have a comparable sensitivity to microcystins ingested with food particles, (iii) Daphnia spp. may be unable to distinguish between microcystin-producing and -lacking cells, and (iv) the strength of the toxic effect can be predicted from the microcystin ingestion rate of the animals...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the application of}} an oligonucleotide microarray to (i) specifically detect Cryptosporidium <b>spp.,</b> (<b>ii)</b> differentiate between closely related C. parvum isolates and Cryptosporidium species, and (iii) differentiate between principle genotypes known to infect humans. A microarray of 68 capture probes targeting seven single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within a 190 -bp region of the hsp 70 gene of Cryptosporidium parvum was constructed. Labeled hsp 70 targets were generated by PCR with biotin- or Cy 3 -labeled primers. Hybridization conditions were optimized for hybridization time, temperature, and salt concentration. Two genotype I C. parvum isolates (TU 502 and UG 502), two C. parvum genotype II isolates (Iowa and GCH 1), and DNAs from 22 non-Cryptosporidium sp. organisms were used to test method specificity. Only DNAs from C. parvum isolates produced labeled amplicons that could be hybridized to and detected on the array. Hybridization patterns between genotypes were visually distinct, but identification of SNPs required statistical analysis of the signal intensity data. The results indicated that correct mismatch discrimination could be achieved for all seven SNPs for the UG 502 isolate, five of seven SNPs for the TU 502 isolate, and six of seven SNPs for both the Iowa and GCH 1 isolates. Even without perfect mismatch discrimination, the microarray method unambiguously distinguished between genotype I and genotype II isolates and demonstrated the potential to differentiate between other isolates and species on a single microarray. This method may provide a powerful new tool for water utilities and public health officials for assessing point and nonpoint source contamination of water supplies...|$|R
40|$|To advance our {{understanding}} of the processes that govern the assembly of palm communities and the local coexistence of numerous palm species, we here synthesize available information in the literature on species diversity and growth-form composition in palm communities across the Americas. American palm communities surveyed had 4 - 48 (median 16) species in study plots covering 0. 09 - 7. 2 ha. Climate, soils, hydrology, and topography are the main factors determining palm community species richness. Tropical lowland terra firme rain forests are the most species-rich whereas forests that are inundated or grow on sandy soils or in areas with seasonal climate have much fewer species. Palm communities in the central-western Amazon and in Central America are significantly richer than the average region and those in the Caribbean significantly poorer in species. As for branching, the 789 species of tropical American palms belong to Corner's model (solitary, 268 species, 33 %), Tomlinsons model (cespitose, 521 species, 66 %) and Schoute's model (dichotomous branching, three species, < 1 %). We assigned the species to eight different growth forms: (i) Large tall-stemmed Palms (102 <b>spp),</b> (<b>ii)</b> Large-leaved medium-short-stemmed Palms (31 spp), (iii) Medium-sized Palms (95 spp), (iv) Medium/Small Palms with Stout Stem (42 spp), (v) Small Palms (423 spp), (vi) Large acaulescent Palms (28 spp), (vii) Small acaulescent Palms (56 spp), and (viii) Climbing Palms (12 spp).

40|$|Abstract Background To date, only few {{compounds}} {{targeting the}} AI- 2 based quorum sensing (QS) system are known. In the present study, we screened cinnamaldehyde and substituted cinnamaldehydes {{for their ability}} to interfere with AI- 2 based QS. The mechanism of QS inhibition was elucidated by measuring the effect on bioluminescence in several Vibrio harveyi mutants. We also studied in vitro the ability of these compounds to interfere with biofilm formation, stress response and virulence of Vibrio spp. The compounds were also evaluated in an in vivo assay measuring the reduction of Vibrio harveyi virulence towards Artemia shrimp. Results Our results indicate that cinnamaldehyde and several substituted derivatives interfere with AI- 2 based QS without inhibiting bacterial growth. The active compounds neither interfered with the bioluminescence system as such, nor with the production of AI- 2. Study of the effect in various mutants suggested that the target protein is LuxR. Mobility shift assays revealed a decreased DNA-binding ability of LuxR. The compounds were further shown to (i) inhibit biofilm formation in several Vibrio <b>spp.,</b> (<b>ii)</b> result in a reduced ability to survive starvation and antibiotic treatment, (iii) reduce pigment and protease production in Vibrio anguillarum and (iv) protect gnotobiotic Artemia shrimp against virulent Vibrio harveyi BB 120. Conclusion Cinnamaldehyde and cinnamaldehyde derivatives interfere with AI- 2 based QS in various Vibrio spp. by decreasing the DNA-binding ability of LuxR. The use of these compounds resulted in several marked phenotypic changes, including reduced virulence and increased susceptibility to stress. Since inhibitors of AI- 2 based quorum sensing are rare, and considering the role of AI- 2 in several processes these compounds may be useful leads towards antipathogenic drugs. </p...|$|R
40|$|The endemic bovid Myotragus, {{from the}} Plio-Pleistocene {{deposits}} of Majorca, underwent {{a significant reduction}} in relative brain size, especially affecting the vision and locomotor centres. These important modifications allow the hypothesis that, under altered conditions in predator free insular environments, functional demands on neural performance are reduced, allowing a reduction in brain structures and associated sense organs. This is suggested, for example, by the small orbits and reduced visual brain structures of Myotragus balearicus Bate, 1909. These changes, which parallel those shown by domesticated animals, have been interpreted as an adaptive response to insular environmental conditions, in particular to a lack of interspecific competitors and predators. Results obtained from analysis of the smallest Cretan deer (Candiacervus ropalophorus de Vos, 1984, and Candiacervits <b>spp.</b> <b>II)</b> are not as outstanding as it is in Myotragus, and apparently run counter to the fact that dwarfed insular artiodactyls living in environments without any predation pressure would be characterised by a proportional decrease in brain volume as a rule. Brain/body mass proportion of the smallest Candiacervus species provides evidence that this endemic deer underwent only minor changes in the relative size of brain after its geographic isolation. On the other hand, orbit and foramen magnum size are proportionally reduced. Accordingly, different evolutionary process likely affected brain and sense organs changes of these endemic artiodactyls. Other factors, nature of available niches, interspecific competition, maybe island size and time from isolation, would {{have played a role in}} the possible differential evolution of insular ruminants in addition to the change in adaptive strategy for a more efficient energy use under the free-predators environmental conditions of the insular ecosystem.

This study, focused on Southwest Spain, in order to bring new insights into (i) the epidemiology of Dirofilaria <b>spp.,</b> (<b>ii)</b> the species of Culicid vectors possibly involved in their transmission and (iii) the genetic variability of those potential vectors. A total of 881 adult female mosquitoes from 11 different species, were captured during 2012 – 2013, and detection of filarioid DNA was attempted by PCR using specific primers (ITS- 2 and COI), followed by DNA sequencing. In a single Culex pipiens specimen D. immitis DNA was detected both in the head-thorax and abdomen sections. Filarioid nematode DNA was also detected in eight additional Cx. pipiens specimens also in both the thorax and the abdomen, but analysis of sequence data did not allow unambiguous assignment of any of the obtained sequences to a previously defined species. All Cx. pipiens with filarioid DNA were individually analysed by CQ 11 to discriminate between pipiens, molestus, and hybrid forms. Besides, rDNA ITS- 2 sequence analysis revealed the presence of haplotype H 1 and H 2 of Cx. pipiens. To our knowledge this study revealed, for the first time in Spain, the occurrence of likely mature infection of D. immitis in Cx. pipiens, as well as with other yet uncharacterized nematodes, supporting its role as a potential vector of these filarids.

The research was aimed {{to determine the effect}} of different concentrations of root exudates of sengon plant (Paraserianthes falcataria) that had been inoculated with fungal endophyte Nigrospora sp. to control root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne spp. The study was conducted using sand block test method. Block I was the area of application of the nematode Meloidogyne <b>spp.</b> Block <b>II</b> was the area between the application of the nematodes and zone of roots of plant, while Block III was the root zone of plants. All concentration treatments, except 6. 25 % of root exudates in Block III had lower population of root-knot nematode and statistically, significantly different from the untreated control. In Block III, 100 % root exudate treatment suppressed the nematode population to the level of 20 % of the population in control...|$|R
40|$|Cyanobacteria are {{a source}} of potent toxins among which the {{microcystin}} (a hepatotoxic peptide encoded by the mcy gene cluster of Microcystis spp.) is a frequent cause of poisoning in inland waters worldwide. Although the molecular basis of microcystin production is known, its role is still unknown. It was suggested that microcystin production have a metabolic cost that could be offset by some benefit (e. g. protection from grazing). We check that: i) microcystin-producing and non-producing strains occurs simultaneously in the Microcystis <b>spp.</b> blooms, <b>ii)</b> evolutionary forces (mutation, genetic drift) control frequencies of microcystin production and non-production strains, and iii) microcystin producing strains have diminished fitness compared with non-producing strains. We employ evolutionary game theory to explain the maintaining of microcystin-producing genotypes in natural populations of Microcystis spp. A two-strategy (to produce or not microcystin), two-players game of cooperators (microcystin-producing genotypes) and cheaters (non-producing genotypes) explains the coexistence of both genotypes in the same bloom. A bloom composed mostly by the microcystin-producing “cooperators ” genotype, the “temptation of defection ” (increase of non-producing genotypes) is counteracted by kin selection, which enable that natural selection can favour the cooperators. The closest related individuals occur within cyanobacteri...|$|R
