In this paper, the {{contribution of}} <b>ploughing</b> permanent <b>grassland</b> and leys, including grassland renovation, to CO 2 and N 2 O emissions and mitigation options are explored. Land use changes in the Netherlands during 1970 – 2020 are used as a case study. Three grassland management operations are defined: (i) conversion of permanent grassland to arable land and leys; (ii) rotations of leys with arable crops or bulbs; and (iii) grassland renovation. The Introductory Carbon Balance Model (ICBM) is modified to calculate C and N accumulation and release. Model calibration is based on ICBM parameters, soil organic N data and C to N ratios. IPCC emission factors are used to estimate N 2 O-emissions. The model is validated with data from the Rothamsted Park Grass experiments. Conversion of permanent grassland to arable land, a ley arable rotation of 3 years ley and 3 years arable crops, and a ley bulb rotation of 6 years ley and one year bulbs, result in calculated N 2 O and CO 2 emissions totalling 250, 150 and 30 ton CO 2 -equivalents ha– 1, respectively. Most of this comes from CO 2. Emissions are very high directly after ploughing and decrease slowly {{over a period of}} more than 50 years. N 2 O emissions in 3 / 3 ley arable rotation and 6 / 1 ley bulb rotation are 2. 1 and 11. 0 ton CO 2 -equivalents ha– 1 year– 1, respectively. From each grassland renovation, N 2 O emissions amount to 1. 8 to 5. 5 ton CO 2 -equivalents ha– 1. The calculated total annual emissions caused by ploughing in the Netherlands range from 0. 5 to 0. 65 Mton CO 2 -equivalents year– 1. Grassland renovation in spring offers realistic opportunities to lower the N 2 O emissions. Developing appropriate combinations of ley, arable crops and bulbs, will reduce the need for conversion of permanent pasture. It will also decrease the rotational losses, due to a decreased proportion of leys in rotations. Also spatial policies are effective in reducing emissions of CO 2 and N 2 O. <b>Grassland</b> <b>ploughing</b> contributes significantly to N 2 O and CO 2 emissions. The conclusion can be drawn that total N 2 O emissions are underestimated, because emissions from <b>grassland</b> <b>ploughing</b> are not taken into account. Specific emission factors and the development of mitigation options are required to account for the emissions and to realise a reduction of emissions due to the changes in <b>grassland</b> <b>ploughing...</b>|$|R

The model DAIRY WISE has been used to calculate the mitigation by the changed ration, the Introductory Carbon Balance Model to calculate the changes in soil organic carbon and nitrogen caused by <b>ploughing</b> <b>grassland</b> for maize crops.

BIRD STUDYVolume: 61 Issue: 1 Pages: 42 - 47 Published: JAN 2 2014 Full Text View Abstract Close Abstract Capsule Skylarks and Yellowhammers generally did not preferentially establish territories in flax relative to autumn-sown crops on lowland farmland. Aims To investigate the biodiversity value of flax using farmland birds as indicator species. Methods Field surveys took place annually between 2009 and 2011 in Northern France, during the breeding season. Fifteen 1 km grid squares were surveyed using a grid-transect method during the periods of greatest avian activity. Territories {{were identified by}} the presence of singing males, which were assigned to crop types. Pairwise habitat comparisons were performed. Results Our results suggest that flax is not universally beneficial for Yellowhammers and Skylarks in our study area. However there were inter-specific differences in its use: Skylarks established more territories in flax than in oilseed rape, ploughed fields or improved grassland, whereas Yellowhammers mostly avoided flax fields in preference for <b>grassland,</b> <b>ploughed</b> fields and barley. Conclusion Overall, Skylarks and Yellowhammers did not preferentially establish territories in flax relative to autumn-sown crops, although some selection for flax by Skylarks was evident.

40|$|Many {{ecosystems}} {{have historically}} been disturbed, either naturally {{or as part of}} a cultural management. Due to loss of species as a result of too little disturbance, disturbance must be considered as a potential tool for conservation and restoration in various ecosystems. In this thesis work, disturbance effects on a grassland system were studied. The studied grassland had traditionally been severely disturbed, both by grazing animals and wind erosion, and through agricultural practices. By experimentally disturbing the soil in the dry sandy grassland, disturbance-induced effects on plant and arbuscular mycorrhizal communities in sandy <b>grasslands</b> was studied. <b>Ploughing</b> and harrowing had no effects on soil pH and only small effects on available phosphorous was found. A positive effect on plant species richness and abundance of red-listed annuals in dry calcareous grasslands was found. The plant species richness shifted towards one comprised mainly of early successional species, but during the four years of this study, the succession went towards the pre-disturbance state rather than the restoration target defined for the area. It was found that a functional trait approach to evaluate disturbance effects was not sufficient to fully explain the reasons for the disturbed plots to diverge from the target areas. However, the functional approach showed that disturbance increased the incidence of nitrogen favoured species in the system. By using Sanger sequencing it was shown that ploughing had a negative effect on the abundance and species richness of arbuscular mycorrhiza two years after disturbance. However, in a second experiment, at a different site and using pyrosequencing, small-scale disturbances was not shown to affect either species richness or composition of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal communities 4. 5 months after disturbances. Carbon flows through arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi was negatively affected by disturbance, mainly due to a decreased abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and potential host plants. In summary, disturbance was shown to have both positive and negative effects on the studied organisms in dry sandy <b>grasslands.</b> <b>Ploughing</b> and harrowing were not good options for restoring this specific dry calcareous grassland type although some of the wanted annual targets increased in incidence. Mycorrhizal abundance could potentially be decreased following disturbance and with it the potential soil carbon sequestration.

The obtained results are based on the research of valley meadows (series A), mountainous meadows (series B) and semi-natural and additionally sown and ploughed mountainous meadows (series C). In series A, in the observed period, the production effectiveness reached 14. 93 – 23. 76 kg of hay and the economic effectiveness reached 1. 07 – 1. 43 €. The higher production effectiveness and economic effectiveness are produced by doses of nutrients in the ratio N : P : K – 1 : 0. 35 : 0. 5. The highest production effectiveness and economic effectiveness were determined in variants fertilized by lower doses of artificial fertilizers (variants 7 and 12). The influence of PK and NPK nutrients on the production effectiveness and economic effectiveness of fertilization of different grasslands in different altitudes was observed in series B: the higher the altitude (from 350 to 850 meters above the sea level), the lower the indicators of production and economic effectiveness of artificial fertilizers.

Agricultural management can impede the ability of grasslands to act as carbon sinks. In this project, CO 2, CH 4 and N 2 O fluxes from two adjacent grasslands in the SE of Scotland were measured with closed static chambers from March to June 2014, in order to estimate the effect of ploughing and associated management on the emission of the aforementioned greenhouse gases (GHGs) and on soil properties. Environmental conditions and soil properties were measured simultaneously. One field was ploughed with a mouldboard plough in May 2012 and the other field in May 2014. Also, the two fields were continuously grazed and regularly received inorganic fertiliser. CO 2 fluxes were mainly influenced by temperature and were neither strongly influenced by fertilisation nor ploughing, although CO 2 emissions were smaller after the ploughing event in 2014. CH 4 fluxes were high after the ploughing in 2014; highest fluxes reached 7355 μg CH 4 -C m- 2 h- 1 for individual chamber locations. N 2 O emissions were higher after the ploughing in 2014 (up to 2578 μg N 2 O-N m- 2 h- 1 individual chambers) compared to emissions after fertilisation (up to 710 μg N 2 O-N m- 2 h- 1 for individual chambers).

Until the middle of the 20th century, an agricultural system operated by downland farmers known as 'sheep-and-corn farming' underpinned this: the sheep (most famously the Southdown breed) of villagers would be systematically confined to certain corn fields to improve their fertility with their droppings and then they would be let out onto the downland to graze. However, starting in 1940 with government measures during World War II to increase domestic food production and continuing into the 1950s, much <b>grassland</b> was <b>ploughed</b> up for arable farming, fundamentally changing the landscape and ecology, with the loss of much biodiversity. As a result, while old chalk grassland accounted for 40-50% of the eastern Downs before the war, only 3-4% survives.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} for agriculture today is to manage soil properties and their spatial distribution to optimize productivity and minimize environmental impacts, such as diffuse pollution. To identify best management practices, the effects of different agricultural management practices on pollutant sources, mobilization, transfer and delivery to water bodies need to be understood. Grasslands managed for dairy and meat production, despite being widespread, have received less research attention than other agricultural land uses. Therefore, this thesis studies the effects of different grassland management practices on soil properties and their spatial distribution and the mobilization and delivery of multiple diffuse pollutants. As a grassland case study, monitoring for this thesis was conducted across three fields (6. 5 – 7. 5 ha) on the North Wyke Farm Platform, a grassland experimental farm in the UK. First, the effects of permanent grassland management (permanent for at least 6 years, but different grassland management > 6 years ago) were characterized as a baseline, followed by quantifying the short-term effects of ploughing and reseeding of permanent grassland fields. Throughout those management periods, i) a range of soil physical (bulk density [BD]) and chemical (soil organic matter [SOM], total N [TN], total phosphorus [TP], total carbon [TC]) soil properties and their spatial distribution were sampled and analysed by geostatistics, and ii) hydrological characteristics and multiple pollutant fluxes (suspended sediment [SS] and the macronutrients: total oxidized nitrogen-N [TONN], total phosphorus [TP], and total carbon [TC]) were monitored at high temporal resolution (monitoring up to every 15 minutes). The permanent grassland fields (or areas within fields) can {{be considered to be}} functioning differently. Past management legacy (more than 6 years ago) has affected soil properties and their distribution with subsequent effects on sediment and macronutrient delivery from the fields to surface waters. Overall, permanent grasslands were found to contribute significantly to agricultural diffuse pollution. The estimated erosion and macronutrient losses were similar to or exceeded the losses reported for other grasslands, mixed land use and even arable sites, and sediment and TP concentrations exceeded those recommended by EU / UK water quality guidelines. Ploughing and reseeding did not homogenize spatial variation and did not override past management effects. Long-term management differences affected soil properties and altered soil processes, so that the fields subsequently responded differently to ploughing and reseeding. All nutrient concentrations were significantly reduced in the older <b>grassland</b> field (no <b>ploughing</b> for 20 years), but not in the younger <b>grassland</b> field (no <b>ploughing</b> for 6 years). Ploughing and reseeding significantly accelerated the losses of sediment and macronutrients and sediment, TP and TONN exceedance frequencies of EU / UK water quality guidelines increased. Additionally, ploughing and reseeding caused a shift in the relative importance of nutrients, by increasing the relative importance of N. Such large sediment and nutrient losses from intensively managed grasslands should be acknowledged in land management guidelines and advice for future compliance with surface water quality standards. The between-field and within-field variation highlights the importance of baseline characterization and paired catchment studies. The long-term effects of management still acting on soil properties and subsequently water quality indicates how long it may take to see soil and water quality improvements after implementing mitigation measures. Therefore, long-term management history always has to be included when interpreting soil and water quality data. Case-funded PhD between NERC and Rothamsted Research (North Wyke...|$|R
40|$|Managed <b>grasslands</b> are {{occasionally}} <b>ploughed</b> up and reseeded {{in order}} to maintain or increase the sward productivity. It has been reported that this renovation of grassland is associated with a flush of soil organic nitrogen (N) mineralization and with a temporary increase in soil mineral N contents. Here, we report on the effects of method and time of grassland renovation on herbage yield, nitrate (NO 3 -) leaching and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emission. Field experiments were carried out at three sites (two sandy soils and a clay soil) in the Netherlands for three years. Renovation of grassland increased the percentage of Perennial ryegrass from 48 – 70 % up to more than 90 %. However, averaged over three years, dry matter yields were higher for the reference (not reseeded) swards (on average 13. 6 Mg ha- 1 for the highest N application rate) than for the renovated grasslands (12. 2 – 13. 1 Mg ha- 1 dry matter). Grassland renovation in April did not increase N leaching in comparison to the reference. However, renovation in September increased the risk of leaching, because mineral N contents in the 0 – 90 cm were in November on average 46 – 77 kg N ha- 1 higher than in the reference. Contents of dissolved organic N (DON) in the soil were not affected by renovation. Renovation increased N 2 O emissions by a factor of 1. 8 – 3. 0 relative to the reference grassland. Emissions of N 2 O were on average higher after renovation in April (8. 2 kg N 2 O-N ha- 1) than in September (5. 8 kg N 2 O-N ha- 1). Renovation without ploughing (i. e. only chemically destruction of the sward) resulted in a lower percentage of perennial ryegrass (60 – 84 %) than with ploughing (> 90 %). Moreover, N 2 O emissions were higher after renovation without ploughing than with ploughing. Clearly, farmers need better recommendations and tools for determining when grassland renovation has beneficial agronomic effects. Losses of N via leaching and N 2 O emission after renovation can probably not be avoided, but renovation in spring in stead of autumn in combination with ploughing and proper timing of fertilizer application can minimize N losses...|$|R
40|$|Streams {{draining}} coniferous plantations contain higher loadings {{of hydrogen}} ion, aluminium, sulphate and nitrate, {{in comparison with}} streams in adjacent grasslands. Almost all of this ion-load is transported to streams via subsurface water-pathways. An incontrovertible, physical characterization of these pathways within a natural, layered hillslope, {{has yet to be}} presented. This research has sought to provide such a characterization for two hillslopes - one afforested with conifers, the other an improved grassland. Much of the uncertainty associated with the identification of soil-water-pathways stems from an inadequate characterization of the errors imposed by the use of each measurement technique. This research has, therefore, compared the predictions of a number of quasi-independent field and analytical techniques, to attempt to lessen the impact of measurement error upon the observed response of the true hydrological system. The impact of conifers upon the detailed water-pathways and lumped catchment response was monitored to educe any changes in the hydrological response which could account for the increased loading of acidic solutes within forest streams. The results of the analysis, indicated that the pathways of water through hillslopes could be predicted from the response of hydrological properties averaged over control volumes of soil-pores. The accuracy of these solutions was proven by the concordance of the response of all of the properties contained within the Darcy-Richards equation. The marked horizon development within the ferric podzol soil of the instrumented forest hillslope, in particular the presence of an indurated B horizon, deflects most percolation laterally within the 0 /A and A/E horizons. This pathway was indicted by the results of techniques which included numerical and approximative calculations, discontinuities between the state-dependent hydraulic conductivity of each soil horizon, and the generation of steep, vertical potential gradients in layered porous media. The instrumented <b>grassland</b> hillslope was <b>ploughed</b> 11 years prior to instrumentation. This greatly increased the conductivity of the controlling B horizon, allowing almost all flow to percolate to depth. During winter-storms, the forest hillslope generated flows smaller than those within the grassland hillslope, concomitant with the 29 percent difference in the rainfall-runoff behaviour of the catchment areas. This increased loss of runoff within the afforested areas, may result from the high losses of wetted-canopy-evaporation (39 percent of gross-precipitation) from the Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis. Bong. Carr.) trees. Individual conifer trees growing on the steep, ferric podzol hillslope appeared to enhance the lateral deflection of flow within the O/A and A/E horizons, probably {{as a result of their}} platy root systems, and the high rates of precipitation input to soil at the stem-base. The enhancement of both lateral near-surface flow and below-canopy ion concentrations could, therefore, generate the chemical signatures characteristic of streams draining coniferous forests.

40|$|The {{dairy sector}} {{contributes}} {{to climate change}} through emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs), via mainly carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4), and nitrous oxide (N 2 O). Replacing grass silage with maize silage is a feeding strategy to reduce enteric CH 4 emission. The effect of this strategy on GHG emissions can be analyzed at three different levels: animal, farm, and chain level. The level of analysis might affect results and conclusions, because the strategy affects not only enteric CH 4 emissions at animal level, but also other GHG emissions at farm and chain levels. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine if the level of analysis influences conclusions about the GHG reduction potential of increasing maize silage at the expense of grass and grass silage in a dairy cow’s diet. First, we used a linear programming (LP, maximizing labor income) dairy farm model to define a typical Dutch dairy farm on sandy soils without a predefined feeding strategy (i. e. reference situation). Second, we combined mechanistic modeling of enteric fermentation and life cycle assessment to quantify GHG emissions at all three levels. Third, continuing from the diet derived in the reference situation, maize silage was increased by 1 kg DM per cow per day at the expense of grass (summer), or grass silage (winter). Next, the dairy farm model was used again to determine a new optimal farm plan including the feeding strategy, and GHGs were quantified again at the three levels. Finally, we compared GHG emissions at the different levels between the reference situation and the situation including the feeding strategy. We performed this analysis for a farm with an average intensity (13, 430 kg milk/ha) and for a more intensive farm (14, 788 kg milk/ha). Results show that the level of analysis strongly influences results and conclusions. At animal level, the strategy reduced annual emissions by 12. 8 kg CO 2 e per ton of fat-and-protein-corrected-milk (FPCM). Analysis at farm and chain level revealed first of all that the strategy is not feasible on the farm with an average intensity because this farm cannot reduce its grassland area because of compliance with the EU derogation regulation (a minimum of 70 % grassland). This is reality for many Dutch dairy farms with an intensity up to the average. For the more intensive farm, that can reduce its area of grassland, annual emissions reduced by 17. 8 kg CO 2 e per ton FPCM at farm level, and 20. 9 kg CO 2 e per ton FPCM at chain level. <b>Ploughing</b> <b>grassland</b> into maize land, however, resulted in non-recurrent emissions of 913 kg CO 2 e per ton FPCM. At farm and chain levels, therefore, the strategy does not immediately reduce GHG emissions as opposed to what results at animal level may suggest; at chain level it takes 44 years before annual emission reduction has paid off emissions from land use change...|$|R
