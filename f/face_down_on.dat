5|$|Williamson's {{body was}} {{discovered}} by Chambers at approximately 11.15am. Chambers noticed that the air conditioning had been left on, something that Williamson was unlikely to have done, and then realised that Williamson's bedroom door had been left ajar. Investigating further, {{he opened the door}} and discovered Williamson's corpse lying <b>face</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the floor, with multiple stab wounds to the neck and surrounded by a pool of blood. Williamson's dog, Tessa, was running about in the room and barking.|$|E
25|$|Beckham was {{the first}} England player ever to collect two red cards, and the first England captain to be sent off. Beckham's most notorious red card was during the 1998 World Cup after Argentina's Diego Simeone had fouled him: Beckham, lying <b>face</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the pitch, kicked out at the Argentine midfielder, who fell dramatically.|$|E

60|$|As for Tom Myers and {{his brother}} George, they just sat down and put their arms on the railing, and clapped their <b>faces</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> their arms. They cried all over their coat-sleeves, but kept as quiet as they could about it. Whenever these two boys had to cry before any {{of the rest of}} the school-fellows, they had learned to keep very quiet about it.|$|R
25|$|All tiles {{are placed}} <b>face</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> {{the table and}} are shuffled. By {{convention}} all players should participate in shuffling using both hands moving the pieces around the table rigorously and loudly for a lengthy period. Tiles may get flipped up during this process and players should flip them facing down {{as soon as possible}} to avoid identifying the location of the revealed tiles.|$|E
25|$|The shaft skin {{can also}} be slid {{back and forth with}} just the index finger and thumb wrapped around the penis. A {{variation}} on this is to place the fingers and thumb on the penis as if playing a flute, and then shuttle them back and forth. Lying <b>face</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a comfortable surface such as a mattress or pillow, the penis can be rubbed against it. This technique may include the use of a simulacrum, or artificial vagina.|$|E
25|$|After Scott {{was shot}} and had dropped to the ground, Slager {{approached}} him, repeatedly instructed him to place {{his hands behind his}} back, and handcuffed him, leaving him <b>face</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the ground. Although police reports stated that officers performed CPR on Scott, no such action is visible on the video. The video shows that Slager ran back toward where the initial scuffle occurred and picked something up off the ground. Moments later, he dropped the object, possibly the Taser, beside Scott's body.|$|E

Jones beat the count and carried on for 10–12 seconds more with his gloves to his face, eating several more uppercuts. Against the ropes, he then absorbed a huge right hook which {{caused him to}} stiffen and fall <b>face</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the canvas. Referee Ingo Barrabas waved off the fight in what was Jones' 9th career defeat, the 5th by KO.|$|E
25|$|Appellants Micah, Jason and Hein then {{verbally}} {{and physically}} assaulted McLoren. The intensity and {{violence of the}} battle escalated. McLoren held Micah <b>face</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a bed and elbowed him about the back and neck. Jason attempted to pull McLoren off of Micah. McLoren kicked Jason in the face. McLoren then heard appellant Jason say, “Let’s get this fucker.” While being held in a headlock, McLoren twice felt sharp, debilitating, pulsating sensations, which later proved to be multiple stab wounds. Jason admitted stabbing McLoren.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of May 9, 1989, Whitley awoke and spoke with his mother briefly on the phone. He was then visited by his {{brother-in-law}} Lane Palmer, and the two had coffee and they were planning a day of golf and having lunch, after which Whitley had planned to start writing songs for Lorrie Morgan and himself to record when she returned from her concert tour. Palmer departed at approximately 8:30a.m., informing Whitley {{to be ready to}} leave within an hour. Upon returning, Palmer found Whitley <b>face</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> his bed, fully clothed.|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of a year, special “season” event cards are {{randomly}} chosen from a deck. All players learn the modifiers these cards may have on the game. These four cards are then shuffled and placed <b>face</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the season track. The first three seasons, a card is revealed and its modifiers applied to the game. During the last season (Winter), the modifiers are ignored, but a number on the card reveals the extent of grain shortage for that year. This element allows players a certain level of planning, but an uncertainty of when (or even if) the season event will happen.|$|E
25|$|Once at the site, the Jews were {{housed in}} the barn and taken in groups of 20 of a time to a point 40 or 50 meters from the trench, where they were ordered to lie <b>face</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the ground. Groups of ten were then ordered to stand up, and, except for children, remove their outer clothing. As they were {{moved closer to the}} pit, they were ordered to strip completely. A Latvian guard, Bulvāns, later testified that he saw two Germans, SS-Scharführer ("squad leader") Karl-Emil Strott and Philip (or Filip) Krapp, using a whip on people who did not move on to the pit.|$|E
25|$|At first {{erected in}} the little village centre before the town hall, it was quickly dynamited off its {{pedestal}} by the priest, then successively kept in pieces behind a hair salon, repaired by welding, and at last moved several kilometres {{to the place where}} it still stands. There, it was once again torn off its pedestal by a tropical cyclone, then abandoned, <b>face</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the ground, for twenty years before finally being found by chance during construction work in 1968. It was then put back in place, rehabilitated as a memorial to World War I dead, celebrated in magnificent public ceremonies, registered in the general inventory of historic monuments, and finally classified as such in 2004.|$|E

25|$|After {{driving to}} midfield, the Chargers faced third and 10 with 2:08 remaining. Buffalo sent safety Steve Freeman on a blitz {{for the next}} play, leaving Smith, San Diego's No. 3 receiver, one on one with Simpson. Earlier in the game, Simpson had knocked {{the ball out of}} Smith's hands during a catch attempt and then picked it off in mid air. But this time, Smith managed to get one step ahead of Simpson, make the catch, and evade his desperate diving tackle attempt, leaving Simpson <b>face</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the turf as he raced 50 yards for a touchdown. Edwards sealed the victory for the Chargers after the ensuing kickoff by {{recording}} his second interception from Ferguson with 1:16 left in the game.|$|E
25|$|The {{manuscript}} is transcribed onto thin slightly waxed {{sheets of}} paper by a professional calligrapher. The paper is placed <b>face</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a block on which {{a thin layer of}} rice paste has been thinly spread and the back rubbed with a flat palm-fibre brush so that a clear impression of the inked area is left on the block. The engraving uses a set of sharp-edged tools to cut the characters with a double edged tool used to cut away any extra surfaces. The knife is held like a dagger in the right hand and guided by the middle finger of the left hand, drawing towards the cutter. The vertical lines are cut first, then the block is rotated 90 degrees and the horizontal lines cut.|$|E
500|$|The second team, officer Herb Frauenberger and his partner, Tony Palma, {{arrived a}} few minutes later.

500|$|Moscone {{planned to}} {{announce}} White's replacement on November 27, 1978. A half {{hour before the}} press conference, White avoided metal detectors by entering City Hall through a basement window, and went to Moscone's office, where witnesses heard shouting followed by gunshots. White shot Moscone in the shoulder and chest, then twice in the head. White then quickly walked to his former office, reloading his police-issue revolver with hollow-point bullets along the way, and intercepted Milk, asking him to step inside for a moment. Dianne Feinstein heard gunshots and called police, then found Milk <b>face</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the floor, shot five times, including twice in the head. Soon after, she announced to the press, [...] "Today San Francisco has experienced a double tragedy of immense proportions. As President of the Board of Supervisors, it is my duty {{to inform you that}} both Mayor Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk have been shot and killed, and the suspect is Supervisor Dan White." [...] Milk was 48years old. Moscone was 49.|$|E
500|$|San Lorenzo Colossal Head6 (also {{known as}} San Lorenzo Monument17) {{is one of}} the smaller {{examples}} of colossal heads, standing [...] It measures [...] wide by [...] deep and is estimated to weigh between 8 and 10 tons. The head was discovered by a local farmworker and was excavated in 1965 by Luis Aveleyra and Román Piña Chan. The head had collapsed into a ravine under its own weight and was found <b>face</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> its left hand side. In 1970 it was transported to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York for the museum's centenary exhibition. After its return to Mexico, it was placed in the Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico City. It is sculpted with a net-like head covering joined together with sculpted beads. A covering descends from under the headdress to cover the back half of the neck. The headband is divided into four strips and begins above the right ear, extending around the entire head. A short strap descends from either side of the head to the ear. The ear ornaments are complex and are larger {{at the front of the}} ear than at the back. The face is that of an ageing male with the forehead creased in a frown, wrinkles under the eyes, sagging cheeks and deep creases on either side of the nose. The face is somewhat asymmetric, possibly due to errors in the execution of the monument.|$|E

The player puts his/her pieces <b>face</b> <b>down</b> and <b>on</b> their turn will take a piece from the wall and must discard it if it doesn't complete a legal-hand. The player gains points if they win though they become completely unable to change their hand.|$|R

50|$|On May 4, 1932, a 32-year-old prostitute, Lilly Lindeström, {{was found}} murdered {{in her small}} {{apartment}} in the Atlas area of Stockholm near Sankt Eriksplan. She {{had been dead for}} 2-3 days before police broke into her apartment; she had suffered blunt force trauma to her head. Lilly was found completely naked and <b>faced</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> her bed. According to reports sexual activity had taken place, with a condom found to still be protruding from her anus. The detectives noted that a gravy ladle was found at the scene and on further inspection of the body, they realized her body had been drained of all of her blood. Police suspected the implement was used by the perpetrator to drink Lilly's blood. Various clients fell under suspicion but after a lengthy investigation, none were charged with her murder. The murder remains unsolved.|$|R
