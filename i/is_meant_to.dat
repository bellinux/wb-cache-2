5|$|Despite Mihardja's {{insistence that}} Atheis <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> be realistic, several {{symbolic}} interpretations {{have been put}} forward. According to Mihardja, {{one of the most}} common interpretations readers conveyed to him was that Hasan's death symbolised atheism defeating religion, with Hasan's death as the death of theism. According to Maier, Atheis serves as an allegory for the development of the Indonesian nation. Hasan, representing traditionalism, is killed by the Japanese, who changed the status quo when they invaded in 1942. Meanwhile, the anarchistic Anwar finds himself without a place in the modern world. Only the responsible modern character, Rusli, is able to bring the Indonesian nation, as represented by Kartini, to terms with the new world.|$|E

50|$|Graffiti is {{characteristically}} made up {{of written}} words that <b>are</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> represent a group or community in a covert way and in plain sight. The tell tale sign of street art is that it usually includes images, illustrations, or symbols that <b>are</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> convey a message. While both works <b>are</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> represent or tell a message to viewers, one {{difference between the two}} comes in the specific viewers that it <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> for. One trait of street art that has helped to bring it to positive light in the public eye is that the messages shown in these public spaces are usually made to be understandable to all.|$|R
