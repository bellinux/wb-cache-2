5|$|The {{original}} buses ran on diesel fuel, but {{the system}} allows <b>for</b> <b>buses</b> that run on alternative energy sources. Biodiesel fuel and natural gas have been trialled, and 20% of the Adelaide bus fleet uses compressed natural gas, 48% B20 and 32% B5 biodiesel blends. The design of the O-Bahn allows for the installation of overhead wires for trolleybuses.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} located one block {{east of the}} Washington State Ferries terminal, serving the Whidbey Island Ferry, which also {{functions}} as a transfer point <b>for</b> <b>buses</b> operated by Community Transit and Everett Transit: two all-day local buses connect Mukilteo to Lynnwood and Everett Station, while three peak-only commuter routes run to Downtown Seattle, the University of Washington, and the Boeing Everett Factory.|$|E
5|$|In June 2004, Mayor Daley and airline {{officials}} {{celebrated the}} completion of the Terminal Development Program. The project, designed by HNTB resulted in the addition of 14 gates (from 29 to 43), with the airport now having 43 gates on 3 concourses. A new 6,300-space economy parking garage, including a new bridge and roadway <b>for</b> <b>buses</b> shuttling passengers to and from the terminal, opened in December 2005.|$|E

5|$|In {{some areas}} of the world, {{including}} Berlin, Germany, dropping salt is prohibited altogether except on the highest-risk roads; plain sand without any melting agents is spread instead. While this may protect the environment, it is more labour-intensive, as more gritting runs are needed; because the sand is insoluble, it tends to accumulate at the sides of the road, making it more difficult <b>for</b> <b>buses</b> to pull in at bus stops.|$|E
5|$|Sound Transit and the King County Council {{signed a}} new joint-operations {{agreement}} in June 2002, leaving King County Metro as {{owners of the}} tunnel and Sound Transit responsible for paying part of the tunnel's debt service at an estimated cost of $65 million. The agreement would allow <b>for</b> <b>buses</b> and light rail trains to share the tunnel and its stations beginning in 2009, after a two-year closure for renovations. A separate agreement signed in May 2003 selected King County Metro as the operator of the light rail line.|$|E
5|$|In 1996 NSB Gardermoen {{stated that}} they {{expected}} to charge commuter and intercity trains 100 million Norwegian krone per year {{to use the new}} line. County politicians in Akershus stated that it was not reasonable for commuters to {{have to pay for the}} new railway. Early estimates showed that this would almost double to price from Oslo to Eidsvoll, and that passengers would have different prices, depending on which route they followed. Stor-Oslo Lokaltrafikk, which was responsible <b>for</b> <b>buses</b> in Akershus, {{stated that they}} had no way to influence NSB's prices, but that they would consider starting a coach service along the route, which would not charge the surcharge.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the bridge}} {{would be the}} only road from the {{mainland}} to the archipelago, tolls could be collected in only one direction. The tolls were set to NOK40 for semitrailers, NOK30 <b>for</b> <b>buses,</b> NOK20 for trucks, NOK12 for cars, NOK5 for motorcycles, NOK4 for bicycles, NOK2 for adults and 1 for children. Discounts were available at the same rates as for ferries. The four people who had worked the longest on the ferry were offered the job as toll plaza employees. From 1972, the bookkeeping of the company was transferred from the company's secretary to Bergens Privatbank's branch in Sotra, while the auditing was placed at Hordaland County Auditing.|$|E
5|$|The Long Island Transportation Plan 2000, a {{study of}} how to handle Long Island traffic issues in 2020, was started in 1997 by {{engineers}} from NYSDOT. The preferred alternative in the study would widen several parkways on the island, inserting high-occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV lanes) <b>for</b> <b>buses</b> and carpools. The Meadowbrook would receive a new HOV lane between the Southern and Northern state parkways, while everything south of the Southern State Parkway would remain the same. The Northern State Parkway would get lanes from the Long Island Expressway to the Meadowbrook, and the Southern State would get lanes from the Meadowbrook to the Sunrise Highway.|$|E
5|$|Only a {{very small}} {{proportion}} of the population in the USSR owned cars. Because of the widespread lack of any mode of private transport, most Soviet citizens travelled via public transport. Due to a relative shortage of cars and good-quality roads, the Soviet people travelled twice as much by bus, train and rapid transit as people in the First World. Soviet bus-transport, throughout most {{of the history of the}} Soviet Union, was controlled either by the regional or the republican branches of the Ministry of Transport. Since rail transit systems were more environmental and consumed little fuel, Soviet planners concentrated their efforts in constructing electricity-driven, rather than fuel-consuming transport. In the mid-1980s the government initiated a programme for compressed-gas energy <b>for</b> <b>buses.</b> By 1988 only 1.2 percent of buses used gas energy, while 30 percent used diesel. Soviet bus-enterprises ran a deficit for the first time in their history by the mid-to-late 1980s.|$|E
