While some praise her loyalty to <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> undaunted acceptance of the curse and gender norms, others condemn her adultery.|$|E
5|$|By 1952, {{the farm}} {{had become a}} burden to Olga and her husband. They were both elderly; their sons had moved away; labor was hard to come by; the Colonel {{suffered}} increasing ill-health, and some of Olga's remaining jewelry was stolen. The farm was sold, and Olga, <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> former maid, Mimka, moved to a smaller five-room house at 2130 Camilla Road, Cooksville, Ontario, a suburb of Toronto now amalgamated into the city of Mississauga. Mimka suffered a stroke that left her an invalid, and Olga nursed her until Mimka's death on 24 January 1954.|$|E

5|$|The Schiavo case {{involved}} 14 appeals and numerous motions, petitions, and hearings in the Florida courts; five suits in federal district court; extensive political intervention at {{the levels of}} the Florida state legislature, Governor Jeb Bush, the U.S. Congress, and President George W. Bush; and four denials of certiorari from the Supreme Court of the United States. The case also spurred highly visible activism from the pro-life movement, the right-to-die movement, and disability rights groups. Since Schiavo's death, both <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> family have written books on their sides of the case, and both have also been involved in activism over its larger issues.|$|E
5|$|The women {{performed}} up to {{six hours}} a day, either singing their own florid repertoire from memory, sight-reading from partbooks, or participating in the balletti as singers and dancers. Thomasin LaMay posits that {{the women of the}} concerti delle donne provided sexual favors for members of the court, but there is no evidence for this, and the circumstances of their marriages and dowries argues against this interpretation. The women were paid salaries and received other benefits, such as dowries and apartments in the ducal palace. Peverara received 300 scudi a year and lodging in the ducal palace for herself, <b>her</b> <b>husband,</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> mother - as well as a dowry of 10,000 scudi upon her marriage.|$|E
5|$|After {{breaking}} from Gardner's Bricket Wood coven, Valiente formed her own coven with Grove as High Priest, {{still following}} {{the tradition of}} Gardnerian Wicca, albeit without the Wiccan laws, which she believed to be entirely an invention of Gardner's. This coven however failed to last, breaking up amid arguments between its founders. In 1956, Valiente, along with <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> mother, moved into a basement flat in Lewes Crescent, Kemptown, in the southern coastal town of Brighton, although in 1968 they moved into a flat nearer to the town centre. She befriended another Kemptown resident, the journalist Leslie Roberts, who shared her interest in the supernatural. He attracted much attention to himself in the local press through his claims that practitioners of black magic were also operating in the area. Valiente remained a good friend to Roberts until his death from heart disease in 1966. She also got {{back in touch with}} Gardner, and mended their friendship, remaining on good terms until his death in 1964, when he left her £200 in his will. During the early 1960s she also developed a correspondence with two Gardnerian initiates in Sheffield, Patricia Crowther and her husband Arnold Crowther, finally meeting them when the latter couple visited Brighton in 1965.|$|E

25|$|Stories of Eurydice's plots against <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> {{sons are}} at odds with other {{historical}} evidence and may be fabricated.

Aeschines described Eurydice I as the loyal defender of her sons, whereas a Plutarch’s passage describes Eurydice as a good model in the education of children.|$|E

25|$|The {{combination}} of her anxieties about <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> son put her under {{a great deal}} of strain, which was increased by {{the fact that she was}} pregnant at the time with her youngest child, Abena, who was extremely ill for much of her infancy.

25|$|Helen's {{retreat from}} her husband is {{followed}} by a return to her natal family origins, symbolized by her return to the home in which she was born, and adoption of her mother’s maiden name as her alias. The relationship between Helen and Frederick, sister and brother, who spent all their childhood apart and reunited only as adults, is foregrounded to domestic reform – Frederick's virtue compensates for their father's neglect of Helen, and their comfortable relationship, defined by mutual respect and understanding, contrasts with Helen's problematic relationship with <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> suitor.|$|E

Charges against her were dropped, and she received counseling from Children's Hospital; Hansen was her therapist's direct supervisor.|$|E

Kingsolver, <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> elder daughter chronicled their experiences that year in the book Animal, Vegetable, Miracle. Although exceptions were made for staple ingredients which were not available locally, such as coffee and olive oil, the family grew vegetables, raised livestock, made cheese and preserved much of their harvest.|$|E
