40|$|This book {{potentially}} {{addresses a}} real need for schools {{to come to}} terms with on a general level – that of encouraging open dialogue both in school and with the community, and treating pupils with respect. Education generally have {{to come to terms}} with the religious values of pupils and parents, and have the confidence to know how to scaffold learning based on these values. This interest in ethos and school climate is of great interest to CPD. This book is however not the ideal text for this: its style is not accessible; in another book the author disrespectfully calls pupils “buggers”. It is too focused on the world of religious education, which will confine its readership.

So too does Hong Xue for co-hosting our Hong Kong workshop. In addition, I want to single out my doctoral student at the University of Ottawa and former research fellow with the EDGE Network, Lihong Li, not only for his organizational support but also for his substantive contributions. Turning a collection of papers into a published book was not a simple task. A debt of gratitude is owed to Andrea Kroetch and David Quayat, a current and a former student who helped me to prepare the manuscript for this book. Further thanks go to Brian Henderson, Clare Hitchens, Rob Kohlmeier, {{and the rest of}} the staff at Wilfrid Laurier University Press for their excellent editorial and promotional skills. Max Brem, Jessica Hanson, Daniel Schwanen, Stephanie Woodburn, and others at the Centre for International Governance Innovation deserve acknowledgment for important role they played in the publication of this book. As I explain in the introductory chapter, my hope is that this book project marks the beginning, not the end, of this group of authors ’ efforts to aid implementation of the WIPO Development Agenda. Each chapter in this book represents a potential spinoff for future ideas and strategic discussion. If we proceed as <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> further thanks will be forthcoming in the near future...|$|E
40|$|Evidence based {{library and}} {{information}} practice (EBLIP) {{is a strategy}} to bridge research and practice. Generally EBLIP {{is seen as a}} movement to encourage and give practitioners the means to incorporate research into their practice, where it previously may have been lacking. The widely accepted definition of EBLIP (Booth, 2000) stresses three aspects that contribute to a practice that is evidence based: 1) "the best available evidence;" 2) "moderated by user needs and preferences;" 3) "applied {{to improve the quality of}} professional judgements. " The area that the EBLIP movement has focused on is how to create and understand the best available research evidence. CE courses, critical appraisal checklists, and many articles have been written to address a need for librarian education in this area, and it seems that strides have been made. But very little in the EBLIP literature talks about how we make professional judgements, or moderate evidence based on our user needs and preferences. Likewise, how do we make good evidence based decisions when our evidence base is weak. These things seem to be elements we just take for granted or can’t translate into words. It is in keeping with tacit knowledge that librarians just seem to have or acquire skills with education and on the job experience. Tacit knowledge is "knowledge that is not easily articulated, and frequently involves knowledge of how to do things. We can infer its existence only by observing behaviour and determining that this sort of knowledge is a precondition for effective performance" (Patel, Arocha, & Kaufman, 1999, p. 78). It is something that is difficult to translate into an article or guideline for how we work. I think of this area as the "art" of evidence based practice. And the art is crucial to being an evidence based practitioner. Science = systematized knowledge, explicit research, methodological examination, investigation, data Art = professional knowledge of your craft, intuition, experience, tacit knowledge, reflection, creativity, values, people-skills Both science and art are important and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not measure their worth against one another. Rather, we need to recognize that both elements contribute to good decision making and practice improvement. Without taking research evidence into consideration, we would be lacking scientific knowledge that helps us gain a deeper understanding of our profession. This needs to be continually renewed and paid attention. However, without the art side of the equation, meaning and context may easily be lost. Someone can gather all the best evidence, but not know how to effectively implement it. Or if you are overly reliant on perfect evidence before you make a decision that is in the best interest of your community, you will likely lag behind and not serve people’s needs. No research study, no matter how perfectly conducted is going to provide all the answers for what we do in practice. We need to embrace both the science and the art of evidence based practice – otherwise, we will overlook important elements of the whole situation that practitioners work within. Doing so is not neat and tidy, but does that really matter? LIS is a social science, and the "social" implies "messy" because people and real-life situations are not easily controlled. The art of our craft allows us to embrace the messy situation, find ways to be creative, put our professional judgements to use and find the best solutions to meet the needs of individual users by applying the best of what we find in the research literature together with the best of what we know is likely to help this person. My purely unscientific judgement as a practitioner is that LIS practice is probably 30 % science and 70 % art (more or lessdepending upon the specific topic). As such, I think that we cannot ignore the art of evidence based practice, and in fact should begin thinking about ways to be better artists as well as better scientists. Within this journal, the Using Evidence in Practice section brings together the science and art of evidence based practice. In this section, practitioners recount how they used evidence to assist with their practice decisions. They also provide details of non-research evidence or situations that impact their judgements, and at the end of the piece they reflect on the overall process and how their practice may be improved in the future. I hope these experiences inspire readers, and make the connections between science and art more obvious...|$|E

60|$|When we traversed {{the dense}} {{body of the}} market and entered Roscoe Street from Whitecross, we were {{surprisingly}} soon out of its hubbub in a quiet befitting the silent sectaries, who once made so great a spiritual clamor in the world. We were {{going to look at the}} grave of George Fox, because of his relation to our colonial history in Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, and we thought it well to look into the Friends' Meeting-house on the way, for a more fitting frame of mind than we might have brought with us from Whitecross Street. A mute sexton welcomed us at the door, and held back for us the curtain of the homely quadrangular interior, where we found twoscore or more of such simple folk as Fox might have preached to in just such a place. The only difference was that they now wore artless versions of the world's present fashions in dress, and not the drabs of out-dated cut which we associate with Quakerism. But this was right, for that dress is only the antiquated simplicity of the time when Quakerism began; and the people we now saw were more fitly dressed than if they had worn it. We sat with them a quarter of an hour in the stillness which no one broke, the elders on the platform, with their brows bowed on their hands, apparently more deeply lost in it than the rest. Then we had freedom (to use their gentle Quaker parlance) to depart, and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> so without offence.|$|R

60|$|But I {{think that}} not only in {{relation}} to the socialists, but to the monarchies, is L.N. the choice of the French people. I think that they will not bear the monarchies, they will not have either of them, they put them away. It {{seems to me that the}} French people is essentially democratical, and that by the vote in question they never meant to give away either rights or liberties. The extraordinary part of the actual position is that the Government, with these ugly signs of despotism in its face, stands upon the democracy (is no 'military despotism,' therefore, in any sense, as the English choose to say), and may be thrown, and will be thrown, on that day when it disappoints the popular expectation. For my part, I am hopeful both for this reason and for others. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>we</b> shall <b>do</b> better, when there is greater calm; that presently there will be relaxation where there is stringency, and room to breathe and speak. At present it is a dictatorship, and we can't expect at such a time the ease and liberty of a regular government. The constitution itself may be modified, as the very terms of it imply, and the laws of the Press not carried out.
