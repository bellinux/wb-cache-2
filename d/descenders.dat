5|$|The Deseret {{alphabet}} was purposely {{designed so}} as to not have ascenders and <b>descenders.</b> This was envisioned as a practical benefit for the alphabet {{in an era of}} metal type: after many uses, the edges of type sorts become dull, and narrow ascenders and <b>descenders</b> are most prone to this effect.|$|E
5|$|From the 7th century, {{the forms}} of some letters began to change. The equal height of the letters was abandoned, with letters {{acquiring}} ascenders and <b>descenders.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nuskhuri letters vary in height, with ascenders and <b>descenders,</b> and are slanted to the right. Letters have an angular shape, with a {{noticeable}} tendency {{to simplify the}} shapes they had in Asomtavruli. This enabled faster writing of manuscripts.|$|E
50|$|The form of {{the letter}} Shcha is the letter Cyrillic Sha (Ш ш) with a <b>descender</b> (cf. the Cyrillic letters De (Д д), Tse (Ц ц), Ka with <b>descender</b> (Қ қ), and En with <b>descender</b> (Ң ң).|$|R
50|$|En with <b>descender</b> (Ң, ң; italics: Ң, ң) is {{a letter}} of the Cyrillic script. Its form {{is derived from the}} Cyrillic letter En (Н н) by adding a <b>descender</b> to the right leg.|$|R
50|$|Abkhazian Che with <b>descender</b> (Ҿ ҿ; italics: Ҿ ҿ) is {{a letter}} of the Cyrillic script. Its form {{is derived from the}} Cyrillic letter Abkhazian Che (Ҽ ҽ Ҽ ҽ) by the {{addition}} of a <b>descender.</b>|$|R
5|$|A 1920s {{adaptation}} {{created by}} the Stempel Type Foundry and released for hot metal typesetting by Linotype, that has remained popular. It is sharp, somewhat angular design with a crisp hook rather than a teardrop at top left of the 'a'. Stempel Garamond has relatively short <b>descenders,</b> allowing it to be particularly tightly linespaced. An unusual feature is the digit 0, which has reversed contrast, with the thickest points of {{the number on the}} top and bottom of the digit to make it more distinguishable from a 'o'. The Klingspor Museum credits it to Stempel's head of typeface development Dr. Rudolf Wolf.|$|E
5|$|Distinctive {{features}} of Ehrhardt include an 'A' with gently curving bar matching the centre-link of the 'B', a wide 'T' with spreadeagled serifs {{on either side}} and a 'b' with no foot on the left. In italic the 'J' has a crossbar, the 'w' has sharp reverse curves towards the top and left, and the 'v' has a flourish on the left. The face has high stroke contrast (difference between thick and thin strokes) {{by the standards of}} most old-style serif fonts. In order to allow compact line spacing, <b>descenders</b> were kept reasonably short.|$|E
25|$|<b>Descenders</b> {{indicate}} {{background sound}} description and off-screen dialogue.|$|E
50|$|Mormo — A <b>descender</b> {{from the}} world of Yaoon, who accompanies the <b>descender</b> of Terresia on a mission to destroy Gilgulim. He is voiced by Daisuke Sakaguchi in the Japanese version and by Steve Staley in the U.S. version.|$|R
5000|$|Ge with <b>descender</b> (Ӷ ӷ; italics: Ӷ ӷ) is {{a letter}} of the Cyrillic script formed from the Cyrillic letter Ge (Г г Г г) by adding a <b>descender.</b> In Unicode this letter is called [...] "Ghe with descender".|$|R
5000|$|Shha with <b>descender</b> (Ԧ ԧ; italics: Ԧ ԧ) is {{a letter}} of the Cyrillic script. [...] Its form {{is derived from the}} Cyrillic letter Shha (Һ һ Һ һ) by the {{addition}} of a <b>descender</b> to the right leg.|$|R
25|$|Legacy EIA-608 home caption decoder fonts had no <b>descenders</b> on {{lowercase}} letters.|$|E
25|$|LTC Caslon is a {{digitisation}} of the Lanston Type Company's 14 {{point size}} Caslon 337 of 1915 (itself {{a revival of}} the original Caslon types). This family include fonts in regular and bold weights, with fractions, ligatures, small caps (regular and regular italic only), swashes (regular italic weight only), and Central European characters. An notable feature is that like some hot metal releases of Caslon, two separate options for <b>descenders</b> are provided for all styles: long <b>descenders</b> (creating a more elegant designs) or short (allowing tighter linespacing).|$|E
25|$|Caslon 540 was {{a second}} American Type Founders version with {{shortened}} <b>descenders</b> to allow tighter linespacing. The italic was distributed by Letraset with a matching set of swashes. As a result, this often became sold or used without the regular or roman style of this revival.|$|E
50|$|Te with <b>descender</b> (Ҭ ҭ; italics: Ҭ ҭ) is {{a letter}} of the Cyrillic script. Its form {{is derived from the}} Cyrillic letter Te (Т т Т т) by the {{addition}} of a <b>descender</b> to the leg of the letter.|$|R
5000|$|While {{the shape}} of the 3 {{character}} has an ascender in most modern typefaces, in typefaces with text figures the character usually has a <b>descender,</b> as, for example, in [...]In some French text-figure typefaces, though, it has an ascender instead of a <b>descender.</b>|$|R
50|$|Che with <b>descender</b> (Ҷ ҷ; italics: Ҷ ҷ) is {{a letter}} of the Cyrillic script. Its form {{is derived from the}} Cyrillic letter Che (Ч ч Ч ч). In the ISO 9 system of romanization, Che with <b>descender</b> is transliterated using the Latin letter C-cedilla (Ç ç).|$|R
25|$|Released by Font Bureau, it {{includes}} bold and bold italic designs, {{and a complete}} feature set across all weights, including bold small caps and swash italic alternates as well as optional shorter <b>descenders</b> and a 'modernist' italic option to turn off swashes on lower-case letters and reduce the slant on the 'A' for a more spare appearance. It is currently used in Boston magazine and by Foreign Affairs.|$|E
25|$|The {{handwriting}} {{found in}} New Testament manuscripts varies. One way of classifying handwriting is by formality: book-hand vs. cursive. More formal, literary Greek works were often {{written in a}} distinctive style of even, capital letters called book-hand. Less formal writing consisted of cursive letters which could be written quickly. Another way of dividing handwriting is between uncial script (or majuscule) and minuscule. The uncial letters were a consistent height between the baseline and the cap height, while the minuscule letters had ascenders and <b>descenders</b> that moved past the baseline and cap height. Generally speaking, the majuscules are earlier than the minuscules, with a dividing line roughly in the 11th century.|$|E
25|$|The oldest {{forms of}} the letters in antiquity are {{majuscule}} forms. Besides the upright, straight inscriptional forms (capitals) found in stone carvings or incised pottery, more fluent writing styles adapted for handwriting on soft materials were also developed during antiquity. Such handwriting has been preserved especially from papyrus manuscripts in Egypt since the Hellenistic period. Ancient handwriting developed two distinct styles: uncial writing, with carefully drawn, rounded block letters of about equal size, used as a book hand for carefully produced literary and religious manuscripts, and cursive writing, used for everyday purposes. The cursive forms approached the style of lowercase letter forms, with ascenders and <b>descenders,</b> {{as well as many}} connecting lines and ligatures between letters.|$|E
50|$|On January 2015, Sony Pictures {{acquired}} the movie rights to <b>Descender</b> after a competitive bidding war. Josh Bratman is producing, with Lemire and Nguyen serving as executive producers. Jesse Wigutow, {{writer of the}} Tron: Legacy sequel, was announced as the screenwriter adapting <b>Descender</b> in February 2016.|$|R
5000|$|The {{lowercase}} letter q — In block letters, some Europeans like {{to cross}} the <b>descender</b> to prevent confusion with the numeral 9, which also can be written with a straight stem. In North America the <b>descender</b> often ends with a hook curving up to the right. (...) ...|$|R
5000|$|H with <b>descender</b> (Ⱨ ⱨ) is {{a letter}} of the Latin alphabet, derived from H with the {{addition}} of a small <b>descender.</b> It was used in Uyghur to represent [...] (~ English h), while a regular H was used to represent [...] (~ German ch in ach).|$|R
25|$|The letterforms of Caslon's roman, or {{upright type}} include an 'A' with a concave hollow at top left and a 'G' without a downwards-pointing spur at bottom right. The {{sides of the}} 'M' are straight. The 'W' has three {{terminals}} {{at the top and}} the 'b' has a small tapered stroke ending at bottom left. Ascenders and <b>descenders</b> are relatively short and the level of stroke contrast is modest in body text sizes. However, Caslon created subtly different designs of letter at different sizes, with increasing levels of fine detail and sharp contrast in stroke weight at larger sizes. Caslon's larger-size roman fonts have two serifs on the 'C', while his smaller-size versions have one half-arrow serif only at top right. In italic, Caslon's h folds inwards and the A is sharply slanted. The Q, T v, w, and z all have flourishes or swashes in the original design, something not all revivals follow. The italic 'J' has a crossbar and a rotated version was used by Caslon in many sizes on his specimens to form the pound sign.|$|E
25|$|The {{print of}} the Goražde Psalter is clean, clear, and easy to read. The text in red was printed first, {{followed}} by the text in black. The faces of the cast metal types used for its printing were designed {{in the manner of}} uncial Cyrillic of medieval Serbian manuscripts, with certain elements of cursive. Ordinary text is printed in black letters with the corpus size of 2.7millimetres. Their strokes have moderately varying widths; their ascenders and <b>descenders</b> are also of moderate sizes. In the first 136 leaves, a block of ten lines of text written in these letters is 74millimetres high, and there are usually 18 to 20, though occasionally 21, lines per page. In the other leaves, the ten-line block is 70millimetres high, with mostly 22 lines per page, and word spacing is tighter than {{in the first part of}} the book. Somewhat larger letters, 5 to 6millimetres high, appear at the beginning of some sentences; they can be black or red. Headings and lines at the beginning of textual units are printed in red. Among the punctuation marks used in the book are the indexes and symbols in the form of a fish, horn, and quadruple dot.|$|E

500|$|In May 2017, Unicode {{approved}} {{the addition of}} Mtavruli characters; that is, capital letters corresponding to the already present Mkhedruli characters. Mtavruli [...] letters have similar letterforms to Mkhedruli, but with <b>descenders</b> shifted above the baseline, with a wider central oval, and with {{the top and bottom}} slightly higher and lower than the tops and bottoms of the lowercase letters that have ascenders.|$|E
50|$|The {{lowercase}} letter p — The French way {{of writing}} this character has a half-way ascender as the vertical {{extension of the}} <b>descender,</b> which also does not complete the bowl at the bottom. In early Finnish writing, the curve to the bottom was omitted, thus the resulting letter resembled a 'n' with a <b>descender</b> ('ɲ').|$|R
