25|$|Flight 703 pancaked onto {{a hilltop}} and broke up as it slid along the ground, killing the flight {{attendant}} instantly. Passenger Reginald John Dixon tried to free two others trapped near the wing root as the wreckage caught fire. He failed to free them and a <b>flash</b> <b>fire</b> critically burned him. He died from his injuries two weeks later. Thus three passengers also died and many others sustained injuries.|$|E
25|$|Most organic {{solvents}} are flammable or highly flammable, {{depending on}} their volatility. Exceptions are some chlorinated solvents like dichloromethane and chloroform. Mixtures of solvent vapors and air can explode. Solvent vapors are heavier than air; they will sink {{to the bottom and}} can travel large distances nearly undiluted. Solvent vapors can also be found in supposedly empty drums and cans, posing a <b>flash</b> <b>fire</b> hazard; hence empty containers of volatile solvents should be stored open and upside down.|$|E
25|$|On {{her initial}} sea trials, the ship ran aground on the Elbe river due to {{insufficient}} dredging and a <b>flash</b> <b>fire</b> {{in the engine}} room which resulted in eight crewmen being taken to hospital. On her official trials, she suffered overheating of the turbines and some stability issues were discovered. The trials were therefore abandoned and the builders were called in to carry out emergency work. At the same time, the overnight cruise for the Kaiser was cancelled; it was eventually carried out in July that year.|$|E

25|$|There {{had been}} a <b>flash</b> <b>fire</b> that caused {{considerable}} smoldering and heavy smoke from the explosion. Some sailors were overcome and perished due to this dense smoke. Fire control parties were initially confused because they found no active fires. Crew members responding to the General Quarters alarm closed water-tight doors, hatches and vents. This, with outstanding damage control work, kept Helena afloat. Crew members in the engineering sections {{had to resort to}} gas masks due to the smoke. The dead were taken dockside after the first attack was concluded. The wounded initially were taken to sickbay and by 1000 hours many were en route to the Naval Hospital.|$|E
25|$|Investigators {{were able}} to gather little from the wreckage, most of which was {{severely}} damaged by the crash and the subsequent <b>flash</b> <b>fire.</b> The only instrument with readable settings which could be salvaged was the fluxgate compass, which was used to confirm the aircraft's heading. Propeller marks on the cliff face also confirmed the aircraft's heading and indicated that the aircraft was pitched nose upwards as it tried to climb. The propellers themselves were broken in such a fashion to indicate that they were functioning normally at impact. It was impossible to determine, however, the aircraft's speed {{at the time of}} the crash due to a lack of surviving instruments. Investigators were also able to determine that all of the damage to the plane was incurred during or after the crash; there was no indication of a midair mechanical failure.|$|E
25|$|On 9 June 1995, Mr Dixon, aged 47, and {{his wife}} were {{passengers}} on Ansett New Zealand Flight 703 when the aircraft crashed in the Tararua Ranges near Palmerston North. Mr Dixon escaped from the wreckage with fractures. However, despite his injuries, he returned to the aircraft to help other passengers trapped in the wreckage. As a result of this selfless action, he was critically burned when a <b>flash</b> <b>fire</b> broke out on the left wing of the aircraft near a hole in the fuselage from which he was helping passengers escape. He was hospitalised and underwent surgery and skin grafts. Mr Dixon remained in a coma, and although he made some initial improvement, his condition worsened and he died two weeks later, the fourth victim of the crash. The situation in which Mr Dixon found himself was extremely dangerous and he displayed great bravery in returning to the aircraft, although injured, to help other passengers which subsequently resulted in the loss of his own life. His bravery undoubtedly ensured that the loss of life was not greater.|$|E
50|$|Small <b>flash</b> <b>fires</b> {{can occur}} in the {{operating}} room during surgery where the presence of ignition sources such as electrical instruments or lasers, an oxygen-rich environment, and flammable vapors (e.g. alcohol-based disinfectants) may set the stage for such an accident. While apparently smaller fires go unreported, surgical <b>flash</b> <b>fires</b> have led to burn injuries and fatalities.|$|R

25|$|In {{the battle}} for first Fässler held off another {{challenge}} from Bernhard, while Jani rejoined in track in fourth place narrowly ahead of Nakajima in the No. 5 Toyota. The contest for second in LMGTE Pro continued with the top four cars running closely together without any action until Tincknell overtook Bruni around the inside for fourth position at the first corner. The stewards elected not to take any action over the collision between Jani and Mücke at turn one, and Filipe Albuquerque overtook Nicolas Minassian for fifth position in LMP2. The first round of lead car pit stops for car adjustments and driver changes commenced after 50 minutes when both Audi cars made pit stops. After the pit stops, Hartley took over the No. 1 Porsche and gained the lead because both Audi entries were delayed by slower cars. Fuel went onto the hot exhaust of the second-placed No. 66 Ford GT in LMGTE Pro which did not have its breather cap closed and it caused a <b>flash</b> <b>fire.</b> Andy Priaulx, who had taken over from Tincknell, exited the car and course officials and the team's crew members were required to extinguish the flames. The fire damaged the car's turbocharger, causing it to run at a reduced pace.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} {{investigation into}} the disaster discovered {{that a large number}} of potassium superoxide chemical cartridges, used to absorb carbon dioxide and chemically release oxygen to enable survival, were found in the ninth compartment. But the level of carbon monoxide in the compartment exceeded what people can produce in a closed space. Divers found ash and dust inside the compartment when they first opened that hatch, evidence of a fire. But this fire was separate from that caused by the exploding torpedo. This and other evidence found in the salvaged wreck suggested that the crew were killed when they accidentally dropped one of the chemical superoxide cartridges into the seawater slowly filling the compartment. When the cartridge came in contact with the oily sea water, it triggered a chemical reaction and <b>flash</b> <b>fire.</b> The investigation showed that some men temporarily survived this fire by plunging under water, as fire marks on the bulkheads indicated the water was at waist level at the time. Captain-Lieutenant Kolesnikov's body was badly burned from below the waist up, and his head and neck were severely disfigured by burns. The fire consumed all remaining oxygen, so that the remaining survivors all died, of burns, asphyxiation, or carbon monoxide poisoning.|$|E
500|$|At 10:40, one of Lions [...] shells struck Seydlitz causing nearly catastrophic {{damage that}} knocked out {{both of the}} rear turrets and killed 159 men. The {{executive}} officer ordered the flooding of both magazines to avoid a <b>flash</b> <b>fire</b> that would have destroyed the ship. By this time, the German battlecruisers had zeroed in on Lion, scoring repeated hits. At 11:01, an [...] shell from Seydlitz struck Lion and knocked out two of her dynamos. At 11:18, two of Derfflinger's [...] shells hit Lion, one of which struck the waterline and penetrated the belt, allowing seawater to enter the port feed tank. Lion had to turn off its engines due to seawater contamination {{and as a result}} fell out of the line.|$|E
50|$|When using front-curtain flash (when the <b>flash</b> <b>fires</b> {{immediately}} after the shutter opens), the preflashes and main flash appear as one to the human eye, since {{there is very little}} time between them. When using rear-curtain flash (when the <b>flash</b> <b>fires</b> {{at the end of the}} exposure) and a slow shutter speed, the distinction between the main flash and the preflashes is more obvious.|$|R

500|$|Frank McNamara (62), an apiarist, and Geoff Inkpen (25), a young farmer, {{heard the}} sound of a big {{aircraft}} in serious trouble, flying low nearby. McNamara described the noise from the engines as [...] "terrifying". They investigated and saw the bright light of a <b>flash</b> <b>fire.</b> McNamara sent his two teenage sons in his utility truck to York to alert the police. McNamara and Inkpen then set out on foot {{in the direction of the}} fire. As there was bright moonlight, they were able to hurry through the bush. After about half an hour, they came upon a scene of devastation. They were astonished to find an elderly man in a dazed state wandering around the burning wreckage. He gave his name and explained that he had been a passenger on a large aircraft. He had survived the crash despite being badly burned. No one else was found alive.|$|E
500|$|The initial {{explosion}} {{killed or}} wounded everyone stationed in the gun house itself. Harvey, despite severe wounds and burns, realised that the shell hoist leading to the ship's main forward magazine was jammed open. With the hatch open, the <b>flash</b> <b>fire</b> would rapidly travel down to the main magazine resulting in an explosion that would tear the ship in two and kill everyone on board. Staggering across {{the wreckage of the}} turret, Harvey gave orders down the voice pipe for the magazine doors to be closed and the magazine compartments to be flooded, an action which would prevent the cordite in the magazines detonating. [...] Turning to his sergeant, the one man still standing, Harvey instructed him to proceed to the bridge and give a full report to the ship's captain Ernle Chatfield (a standard drill in damage exercises). Seconds later, Harvey collapsed and died from [...] his wounds. The sergeant went immediately to the bridge and notified the captain of Harvey's actions before being taken below to have his wounds dressed.|$|E

2500|$|Then, on January 27, 1967, Grissom's {{crew was}} killed in a <b>flash</b> <b>fire</b> in their {{spacecraft}} cabin during a test on the launch pad, interrupting the program for 21 months to identify and fix the root causes of a major safety problem. This forced cancellation of plans to fly any Block I spacecraft with men, and effectively forced a [...] "reboot" [...] of all manned mission plans.|$|E
2500|$|Van Zyl {{discovered}} that the front-right pallet was the [...] "seat" [...] of the fire. The manifest said that pallet mostly comprised computers in polystyrene packaging. The investigators said that the localised fire likely {{came in contact with}} the packaging and produced gases that accumulated near the ceiling. They also said that gases ignited into a <b>flash</b> <b>fire</b> that affected the entire cargo hold. The cargo fire of Flight 295 did not burn lower than one metre above the cargo floor. The walls and ceiling of the cargo hold received severe fire damage. Van Zyl ended his investigation without discovering why the fire started.|$|E
2500|$|At 12:20 Evstafi, with a {{clear view}} of the Ottomans, opened fire on Yavuz, {{striking}} and disabling the third starboard [...] casemated gun with its first salvo. The Russian battleships were using a new form of fire control that had been devised in the aftermath of the Russo-Japanese War, with Ioann Zlatoust directing for all other ships except Rostislav, which had a different main armament. The 12-inch shell had passed through the casemate armour and barely penetrated a 150mm plate before detonating. Splinters badly damaged the ship's torpedo net. It also detonated three [...] high explosive shells and set 16 cartridges on fire. The resulting explosion tore a square meter-sized hole in the side of the ship and killed the gun's crew. The <b>flash</b> <b>fire</b> traveled down the munitions elevator and up into the fourth starboard casemate, which was temporarily abandoned.|$|E

2500|$|A South African {{government}} chemist {{examined a}} microscopic particle on the nylon netting {{next to the}} front-right pallet on Flight 295. The chemist found that the airflow patterns on the iron suggested that it travelled at a high velocity while in a molten state; therefore the fire on Flight 295 may have not been a <b>flash</b> <b>fire</b> triggered by packaging. Fred Bereswill, the investigator from Boeing, said that this {{would suggest that the}} source of the fire would have had properties like a sparkler, with the source including its own oxidising agent. [...] A British fire and explosion analyst examined the exterior skin of the aircraft which had been located above the pallet; the analyst found that the skin became as hot as 300 degrees Celsius. [...] Bereswill said that {{it would be difficult for}} a fire to burn through the skin of an aircraft in-flight because of the cool airflow outside the aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|The first near-kill of the Run to the South {{occurred}} at 16:00, when a [...] shell from Lützow wrecked the [...] "Q" [...] turret amidships on Beatty's flagship Lion. Dozens of crewmen were instantly killed, but far larger destruction was averted when the mortally wounded turret commander – Major Francis Harvey of the Royal Marines – promptly ordered the magazine doors shut and the magazine flooded. This prevented a magazine explosion at 16:28, when a <b>flash</b> <b>fire</b> ignited ready cordite charges beneath the turret and killed {{everyone in the}} chambers outside [...] "Q" [...] magazine. Lion was saved. [...] was not so lucky; at 16:02, just 14 minutes into the gunnery exchange, she was hit aft by three [...] shells from , causing damage sufficient to knock her out of line and detonating [...] "X" [...] magazine aft. Soon after, despite the near-maximum range, Von der Tann put another [...] shell on Indefatigables [...] "A" [...] turret forward. The plunging shells probably pierced the thin upper armour, and seconds later Indefatigable was ripped apart by another magazine explosion, sinking immediately with her crew of 1,019 officers and men, leaving only two survivors. (position 3).|$|E
2500|$|Following salvage operations, analysts {{concluded}} that 23 sailors {{in the sixth}} through ninth compartments had survived the two explosions. They took refuge in the ninth compartment and survived more than six hours before an oxygen cartridge contacted the oily sea water, triggering an explosion and <b>flash</b> <b>fire</b> that consumed the remaining oxygen. All 118 personnel—111 crew members, five officers from 7th SSGN Division Headquarters, and two design engineers—aboard Kursk died. The investigation concluded the Russian Navy was completely unprepared {{to respond to the}} disaster. The following year, a Dutch team was contracted by the Russians to raise the hull. Employing newly developed lifting technologies, they recovered all but the bow of the vessel, including the remains of 115 sailors, who were buried in Russia. More than two years after the sinking, the Russian government completed a 133-volume, top-secret investigation of the disaster. The government released a four-page summary to the public that was published in Rossiyskaya Gazeta. It revealed [...] "stunning breaches of discipline, shoddy, obsolete and poorly maintained equipment," [...] and [...] "negligence, incompetence, and mismanagement." [...] The report said the rescue operation was unjustifiably delayed.|$|E
