40|$|Until {{recently}} {{there has}} been no international register or international network linking national registers for the exchange of information on, and for, chemical hazard assessment and control. The International Register of Potentially Toxic Chemicals (IRPTC) was established by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in 1976 and is now in full operation. The objectives assigned to the Register concern the establishment of a global network of contributing partners through which it can develop its data-bank containing relevant information for an assessment of environmental hazards caused by chemicals, and disseminate this information to decision-making bodies, national authorities, international organizations and other institutions, and to the scientific community that is concerned with the evaluation and control of chemicals in the environment. The IRPTC operations involve preparation of data profiles for chemicals, the development of a computerized data storage and retrieval system, a query-response service, and the publication of a 4 -monthly Register <b>Index,</b> a periodical <b>Bulletin,</b> and other documents. These contain information on chemicals, international and national activities related to issues of chemical safety, and also legislative and regulatory measures for protection of the health of humans and of the environment from the noxious effects of chemical...|$|R
40|$|This {{bibliography}} contains {{references to}} the geologic literature on the State of Minnesota issued from 1981 through 1985, as well as omissions from the previous two bibliographies of Minnesota geology: Bulletin 34 (published in 1951), with coverage through 1950; and Bulletin 46 (published in 1981), with coverage for 1951 - 1980. The references in the bibliography section cover most geologic topics but exclude those confined to the last 10, 000 years, to surface hydrology, and to mining and metallurgy. Most unpublished maps and reports were excluded from this bibliography, {{because they are not}} readily available to users. Notable exceptions are theses and dissertations and open-file reports issued in established and accessible series, such as the U. S. Geological Survey's Open-File Report series. An effort was made in the bibliography section to preserve the spelling, capitalization, and punctuation of the original sources; usage in the index reflects current Minnesota Geological Survey style. The last bibliography, Bulletin 46, covered 30 years. Bulletin 47 covers only 5 years, but contains nearly 1, 100 references, more than half the number in its predecessor. Much of this inflation may reflect the increased number of abstracts published in recent years. The next bibliography (for 1986 - 1990) will differentiate between abstracts and more substantive work. The index section, with a few minor changes, closely follows the design of the <b>index</b> in <b>Bulletin</b> 46. It has in one alphabetical listing topical (Ground Water; Petrology; Sedimentation), geographic (Mesabi range; Lake County; Southwestern Minnesota), lithostratigraphic (Duluth Complex; Lake Vermilion Formation), and chronostratigraphic (Paleozoic; Quaternary) indexing. Care was taken to index {{references to the}} closest applicable index classifications. For this reason, users of the index are encouraged to search flexibly, to check both broader and narrower index classifications. For example, someone wanting references for Aitkin County may also wish to search a narrower index classification-Cuyuna range, as well as the broader East-central Minnesota. The increased number of cross references in this index should help users with this type of search. Several of the Survey staff were especially helpful in the preparation of the index, and also reviewed the entries in their respective fields: M. J. P. Kuhns and S. J. Mills (economic geology and Duluth Complex); P. L. McSwiggen (petrology and uranium); H. C. Hobbs (glacial geology); and D. J. Bergstrom (Paleozoic rocks and Sioux Quartzite). V. W. Chandler reviewed the geophysics entries; D. R. Setterholm, Cretaceous rocks; R. S. Lively, geochemistry and geochronology; and M. C. Hoyer, ATES.

40|$|These Notes {{are pretty}} {{haphazard}} {{and do not}} meet the minimum standards of a bibliography or even of a checklist. They are the by-product of my book, The Press in Australia (Lansdowne Press, Melbourne, 1964). They consist largely of a listing of material I read in doing research on this book, supplemented by some entries which are taken from the results of a questionnaire sent to all metropolitan newspapers. I {{would like to thank the}} editors and librarians who furnished entries. The bulk of the book deals with 20 th Century Australian metropolitan dailies. I began by making a survey of existing book and pamphlets on these, and in this field the Notes are most complete. For my historical chapter, which deals with some aspects of our 19 th Century press, I did three main things: First, I sampled a cross section of dailies in 25 year periods. Second, I checked all books which were subject-indexed in the Mitchell catalogue. The entries for these, in fuller and more precise form, are given in the Notes. Third, I was faced with the problem of how to get [at] primary sources without consulting either manuscripts or Government documents. After spending some weeks on both, I decided that a thorough search would take up too much time relative to my short chapter. I hence switched to making a systematic check of 100 journal and magazine titles. The Mitchell catalogue lists some of them by states, but its selection is very incomplete. As it would have been folly to go through the whole catalogue, I began by checking all promising periodicals mentioned in Frank S. Greenop 2 ̆ 7 s History of Magazine Publishing in Australia, and all titles mentioned in H. M. Green 2 ̆ 7 s A History of Australian Literature. These were supplemented by entries from Ferguson 2 ̆ 7 s bibliography and by a check under likely titles in the catalogue, e. g. "Australian [...] . ", "Sydney [...] . ", "Colonial [...] . " etc. The periodicals often had references to their contemporaries, which were also used. This gave me a rough-and-ready list, which met two essential requirements: It covered a long period, and it contained periodicals from all states. I recognize, of course, that this was not a systematic sampling ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ‚Ã¢Â‚Â¬ÃƒÂ‚Ã¢Â€Âœ but in order to draw a sample one would have needed a complete bibliography of titles. The period of checking depended on the length of the run, and the apparent promise of the periodical. The material was then supplemented by consulting The <b>Bulletin</b> <b>Index,</b> 1880 - 90. The entries given here are a selection from that index, and include only the longer and more informative pieces. As usual, the scope of the book as published is much narrower than its scope at first conceived. I have included entries on a number of subjects marginal to the daily metropolitan press, but of course these are very incomplete. So far as location is concerned, nearly all the books and most of the periodicals mentioned are in the Mitchell Library. But the Library does not contain some of the "House Organs" and "Cadet" papers mentioned. It is rather spotty so far as pamphlets are concerned, and perhaps 10 - 20...|$|R
