5|$|Renewable {{energy in}} Russia mainly {{consists}} of hydroelectric energy. The {{country is the}} sixth largest producer of renewable energy in the world, although it is 56th when hydroelectric energy is not taken into account. Some 179TWh of Russia's energy production comes from renewable energy sources, {{out of a total}} economically feasible potential of 1823TWh. 16% of Russia's electricity is <b>generated</b> <b>from</b> hydropower, and less than 1% is <b>generated</b> <b>from</b> all other renewable energy sources combined. Roughly 68% of Russia's electricity is <b>generated</b> <b>from</b> thermal power and 16% from nuclear power.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, the {{decision}} was taken to electrify the railway using power <b>generated</b> <b>from</b> the hospital's own power plant, which was also connected to the National Grid. The line was electrified at 500V DC using a single overhead line.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, 70% of {{oil shale}} mined in Estonia {{was used for}} power generation, and about 85% of Estonia's {{electricity}} was <b>generated</b> <b>from</b> oil shale. About 29% of produced electricity was exported to Finland, Latvia, and Lithuania.|$|E

5|$|Earth's {{internal}} heat is {{thermal energy}} <b>generated</b> <b>from</b> radioactive decay and continual heat loss from Earth's formation. Temperatures at the core–mantle boundary may reach over 4000°C (7,200°F). The high temperature and pressure in Earth's interior cause some rock to melt and solid mantle to behave plastically, resulting in {{portions of the}} mantle convecting upward since it is lighter than the surrounding rock. Rock and water is heated in the crust, sometimes up to 370°C (700°F).|$|E
5|$|Heat <b>generated</b> <b>from</b> the Farallon Plate subducting {{below the}} North American Plate {{led to the}} {{creation}} of an island arc of volcanoes on the west coast of proto-North America between the late Devonian and Permian periods. Later volcanism in the Jurassic intruded and covered these rocks in what may have been magmatic activity associated with the early stages of the creation of the Sierra Nevada Batholith. 95% of these rocks were eventually removed by uplifted-accelerated erosion.|$|E

5|$|Hydrogen is {{sometimes}} produced and {{consumed in the}} same industrial process, without being separated. In the Haber process {{for the production of}} ammonia, hydrogen is <b>generated</b> <b>from</b> natural gas. Electrolysis of brine to yield chlorine also produces hydrogen as a co-product.|$|E
5|$|In 2002–2003 Galileo {{spacecraft}} had two {{passes through}} the gossamer rings. During them its dust counter detected dust particles in the size range 0.2–5μm. In addition, the Galileo spacecraft's star scanner detected small, discrete bodies (< 1 km) near Amalthea. These may represent collisional debris <b>generated</b> <b>from</b> impacts with this satellite.|$|E
5|$|New genes can be <b>generated</b> <b>from</b> an {{ancestral gene}} when a {{duplicate}} copy mutates and acquires a new function. This process is easier once a gene has been duplicated because {{it increases the}} redundancy of the system; one gene in the pair can acquire a new function while the other copy continues to perform its original function. Other types of mutations can even generate entirely new genes from previously noncoding DNA.|$|E

5|$|Offshore {{volcanism}} also {{occurs in}} Chile. Intraplate volcanism <b>generated</b> <b>from</b> the Easter and Juan Fernández hotspots has formed many Chilean islands, including Isla Salas y Gómez, Easter Island, and the Juan Fernández Islands. Underwater volcanism occurs due to seafloor spreading along the Chile Ridge.|$|E
5|$|Other {{economists and}} analysts {{have argued that}} the {{underground}} economy would continue to bear the same tax burden as before. They state that replacing the current tax system with a consumption tax would not change the tax revenue <b>generated</b> <b>from</b> the underground economy—while illicit income is not taxed directly, spending of income from illicit activity results in business income and wages that are taxed.|$|E
5|$|Plasma is a {{state of}} matter in which an ionised gaseous {{substance}} becomes highly electrically conductive to the point that long-range electric and magnetic fields dominate the behavior of the matter. This state can be contrasted with the other states: solid, liquid, and gas. Unlike these other states of matter, plasma mostly does not naturally exist on the Earth's surface under normal conditions, and must be artificially <b>generated</b> <b>from</b> neutral gases.|$|E

5|$|Sulfur {{deposits}} <b>generated</b> <b>from</b> {{hydrothermal alteration}} are found on Cerro Tuzgle.

Arsenic {{is also found in}} the groundwater and presumably comes from Tuzgle.|$|E
5|$|Taste is <b>generated</b> <b>from</b> receptors on {{the tongue}} and passed along the facial and {{glossopharyngeal}} nerves into the solitary tract in the brainstem. Some taste information is also passed from the pharynx into this area via the vagus nerve. Information is then passed from here through the thalamus into the gustatory cortex.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of an}} organism is <b>generated</b> <b>from</b> its genus and species. For example, humans are listed as Homo sapiens. Homo is the genus, and sapiens the species. When writing the {{scientific name}} of an organism, it is proper to capitalize the first letter in the genus and put all of the species in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term may be italicized or underlined.|$|E
