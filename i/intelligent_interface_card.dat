40|$|Abstract. Bandwidth-intensive {{applications}} compete {{directly with}} the operating system’s network stack for CPU cycles. This is particularly true when the stack performs security protocols such as IPsec; the additional load of complex cryptographic transforms overwhelms modern CPUs when data rates exceed 100 Mbps. This paper describes a network-processing accelerator which overcomes these bottlenecks by offloading packet processing and cryptographic transforms to an <b>intelligent</b> <b>interface</b> <b>card.</b> The system achieves sustained 1 Gbps host-tohost bandwidth of encrypted IPsec traffic on commodity CPUs and networks. It appears to the application developer as a normal network interface, because the hardware acceleration is transparent to the user. The system is highly programmable and can support a variety of offload functions. A sample application is described, wherein production-quality HDTV is transported over IP at nearly 900 Mbps, fully secured using IPsec with AES encryption. ...|$|E

40|$|Since their invention, network {{interfaces}} {{have generally}} been treated as special by operating systems because of their complexity and unique control requirements. In this paper we present a generic host interface through which an <b>intelligent</b> network <b>interface</b> or network processor can be managed as a simple networking device. To accomplish this, we push the complex network connection management and protocol processing code down onto the network interface. This new network processing platform is treated as a simple device by the host operating system. This model of host operating system interconnection provides for various network processor architectures to be handled identically using a well-defined kernel interface. Selection of the exact location for the kernel interface to the network processor was based on our goals to maximize {{the utility of the}} network processing platform, require no changes to existing network applications, and provide interoperability with existing network protocols (e. g.

40|$|Web servers often {{experience}} overload situations due to {{the extremely}} bursty nature of Internet traffic, popular online events or malicious attacks. Such overload situations significantly affect performance and may result in lost revenue {{as reported by the}} recent denial of service attacks. Overload control schemes are well researched and understood in telecommunication systems. However, their use in web servers is currently very limited. Our focus in this paper is to propose effective overload control mechanisms for web servers. An important aspect in overload control is to minimize the work spent on a request which is eventually not serviced due to overload. This paper studies three simple schemes for controlling the load effectively. The first scheme selectively drops incoming requests as they arrive at the server using an <b>intelligent</b> network <b>interface</b> <b>card</b> (NIC). The second scheme provides feedback to a previous node (proxy server or ultimate client) to allow a gapping control tha [...] ...|$|R
40|$|TCP is an {{important}} protocol in high-performance computing. It is used extensively in graphics programs and file systems and it is often the protocol used for the cluster control mechanism. As the breadth of applications increases, {{the need for a}} scalable and efficient implementation of TCP becomes more important. In addition to other bottlenecks that must be alleviated, TCP connection management must be made scalable. This becomes critical as we consider offloading TCP processing onto TCP offload engines (TOEs) or <b>intelligent</b> network <b>interface</b> <b>cards</b> (iNICs). In this paper, we show how to take advantage of special characteristics of the high-performance computing environment and apply existing operating system mechanisms in a unique way to address some of the scalability concerns in offloaded TCP. Specifically, we implement methods for activating and deactivating TCP connections. These allow us to maintain a large store of open TCP connections without a large amount of storage overhead. 1...|$|R
40|$|Recent advancements in network {{technologies}} have allowed for such high bandwidths that the cabling {{is no longer}} a limiting factor. The restricting factor now becomes the router hops in between the source and destination. This paper will discuss network processors and how they can be used to increase router throughput. General processor architectures will be covered and testing results will be shared. Then some commercial products will be explained as well as benchmarking suits used to test these processors to view the increased performance. Next, current areas of research and development will be presented, such as: scheduling, load balancing, and QoS applications. The second part of the paper will cover network co-processors. These co-processors {{can be thought of as}} <b>intelligent</b> network <b>interface</b> <b>cards</b> (NICs). The goal of these NICs is to offload as much network related processing as possible from the host computer to the NIC. This allows for such things as multimedia compression, encryption/decryption, firewalling, and intrusion detection all to be performed on the NIC so that the host is free to perform other functionality. The paper will cover some specific examples of using a co-processor to do multimedia processing as well as security. Lastly, we will cover some implementations of co-processors found in academia today. 1...|$|R
40|$|With a {{focus on}} {{commodity}} PC systems, Beowulf clusters traditionally lack the cutting edge network architectures, memory subsystems, and processor technologies found in their more expensive supercomputer counterparts. Many users find that what Beowulf clusters lack in technology, they more than make up for with their significant cost advantage. In this paper, an architectural extension that adds reconfigurable computing to the network interface of Beowulf clusters is proposed. The proposed extension, called an <b>intelligent</b> network <b>interface</b> <b>card</b> (or INIC), enhances both the network and processor capabilities of the cluster, which has {{a significant impact on}} the performance of a crucial class of applications. Furthermore, for some applications, the proposed extension partially compensates for weaknesses in the PC memory subsystem. A prototype of the proposed architecture was constructed and analyzed. In addition, two applications, the 2 D Fast Fourier Transform (2 D-FFT) and integer sorting, which benefit from the resulting architecture, are discussed and analyzed on the proposed architecture. Specifically, results indicate that the 2 D-FFT is performed 15 – 50 % faster when using the prototype INIC rather than the comparable Gigabit Ethernet. Early simulation results also indicate that integer sorting will receive a 21 – 32 % performance boost from the prototype. The significant improvements seen with a relatively limited prototype lead to the conclusion that cluster network interfaces enhanced with reconfigurable computin...|$|R
40|$|One {{of the key}} {{concerns}} for practitioners and academicians {{is that there are}} almost no platforms based on analytical models for testing the impact of various architectural and design modifications for <b>intelligent</b> Network <b>Interface</b> <b>Cards</b> (NICs). Simulations are typically time-consuming, especially for experimenting different scenarios and what-if analysis. In this research, we study the performance of a NIC called Myrinet developed by Myricom. We develop an open queueing network model to predict its performance. We compare the analytical results with the simulations. The reason there are very few analytical models is because of the enormous complexity posed by the performance-analysis problem. In particular, the problem is a combination of: (a) multi-class queueing network with class switching, (b) polling system with limited service discipline, and (c) finite-capacity queues with blocking. The above three issues have been treated only in isolation in the literature. However the problem becomes much harder when all three issues are simultaneously present. One of the key contributions of this paper is an analytical approximation of this complex system. From an analytical modeling standpoint, we observe that making simplifying assumptions to analyze nodes that are not bottlenecks does not impact performance greatly. The main findings of this research are the bottlenecks of the queueing network, utilizations of the various nodes and performance measures such as the expected delay. The model as well as findings can be used to test the performance impact of various enhancements to the operation of NICs...|$|R
