This is known as 2 ̆ 7 Mode 22 ̆ 7 knowledge production. Yet, university research higher degree programs continue to be largely disciplinary-based. While there {{has been a}} rise in the number of research students working on industry-related, applied projects, very few research students gain exposure to interdisciplinary research processes. This paper explores several examples of interdisciplinary doctoral programs based in North America and Australia and seeks to draw upon examples of undergraduate interdisciplinary learning and epistemology. In reviewing this theoretical work and a number of strategies implemented at an Australian university, the paper begins to imagine an interdisciplinary doctoral pedagogy...|$|R

40|$|Transdisciplinarity {{integrates}} or relates different epistemics {{from science}} and practice (Mode 2 transdisciplinarity) or from branches of disciplines if interdisciplinary integration is impossible (Mode 1 transdisciplinarity). The paper explains, {{based on an}} analysis of the historical development of the Mode 2 transdisciplinarity concept, how transdisciplinary processes link <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>applied</b> <b>research</b> and multi-stakeholder discourses by facilitating methods. We elaborate on what type of problems may be managed using what knowledge, how this might be accomplished, what types of objectives are desired, and by what organizational means. Thus the paper presents ontology, epistemology, methodology, functionality, and organization of an ideal type of transdisciplinary process. Socially robust orientations are the expected outcomes of this process. These orientations provide science-based, state-of-the-art, socially accepted options of solutions which acknowledge uncertainties and the incompleteness of different forms of epistemics (i. e., of knowing or thought), in particular within the sustainable transitioning of complex real-world problems...|$|R
40|$|Between April 2003 and April 2004 a project, {{funded by}} Technology New Zealand, was {{undertaken}} {{to develop a}} computer model of a wood burning heater for use at <b>Applied</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Services</b> Ltd. <b>Applied</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Services</b> Ltd is a science and engineering research company that specialises in the testing of wood burning heaters. The computer model will be owned by <b>Applied</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Services</b> Ltd and {{will be used to}} improve the design of their customers' heaters so that they may pass the particulate emissions and efficiency standards of AS/NZS 4013 : 1999. The computer model used the software program, Engineering Equation Solver as a platform to solve the model equations. EES was particularly easy to use and more emphasis was able to he placed on the actual modelling. The final model included over eight hundred variables and equations. It included radiant, convective and conductive heat flows, over thirty heat balances, Arrhenious based rate expressions and many empirical equations derived from experiments and data acquired at <b>Applied</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Services</b> Ltd. At the beginning of this project the objective was for the model to match the test results to within 10 %. This has been met for the tests on the high airflow setting where the model error is 4 % for flue temperature, 8 % for heater output and 16 % for flue oxygen. Unfortunately on low airflow setting, the model does not reach this target with model errors of 18 % for flue temperature, 25 % for heat output and 13 % for flue temperature. The excellent results for the high flow setting are partially attributed to the use of calibration factors. The calibration factors model the processes in wood combustion that could not be modelled by this project, due to lack of time and resources. Some of these factors are the proportion of air that flows onto the charcoal ember bed or logs, radiation shape factor changes due to firebox geometry, convection heat transfer coefficients changing with turbulence. The calibration of the model only has to be completed once for each heater. The reason why the model does not work as well on low airflow setting is that with less airflow the proportion of air to the charcoal bed opposed to the logs would decrease, therefore decreasing the burn-rate. This model can he used to determine the changes to a heater's performance from changes to air inlet areas, insulation type and thickness, wetback size, baffle size, primary vs secondary air, air bypass ratio and door size. The model provides all the results that are obtained from an emissions test plus extra information such as the amount of excess air, smoke conversion in each combustion zone, flame temperatures and distribution of heat output. The smoke conversions for each combustion zone are particularly helpful in diagnosing where problems with the combustion occur. The reasons for incomplete combustion, lack of temperature or oxygen, can be found and fixed by increasing either insulation or air areas. The model can be used by <b>Applied</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Services</b> Ltd to improve heater designs. For the short term this will involve the author working as a part-time consultant. The project could be built on by another student by using CFD modelling for the sections of the wood burning process not modelled by this model and adding a graphical user interface to make the model easier to use...|$|R

System development involved iteration through community user assessment of need, development or refinement of the GIS, and assessment of the GIS by community users. Collaborative process assessment entailed analysis of archival material, interviews with investigators and participant observation. Over the course of the project, a system was successfully developed, and favorably assessed by users. System development problems fell into four main areas: maintaining user involvement in system development, understanding and integrating data, bringing disparate data sources together, and making use of assembled data. Major themes emerging from the community/university collaborative research process included separate community and university cultures, time as an important issue for all involved, and the impact of uncertainty and ambiguity on the collaborative process.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{educational}} {{research and policy}} scene in Australia {{over the past decade}} has featured a number of contradictory developments. National policy has sponsored more <b>interdisciplinary</b> and <b>applied</b> <b>research,</b> while moving down a Research Quality Framework pathway which prioritises measurable quality and impact measures. At the same time, recent international and national policies in literacy education have been dominated by a psychological (rather than socio-cultural) view of literacy, wrapped within a discourse that valorises “evidence-based ” practice. As literacy researchers coming from an ethnographic, collaborative and critical tradition, we have had to be strategic to secure funding to continue our research agenda in innovative, ethical and scholarly ways. This paper uses the case of a recent research project to explore some {{of the ways in which}} our approaches have been contradictorily positioned within this policy context...|$|R

40|$|For {{nearly all}} of its more than thirty year history, the Office of Arid Lands Studies (OALS), through its various divisions, has been {{involved}} in the research, collection, and dissemination of information about the drylands of the World. This has included <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>applied</b> <b>research</b> programs in economic botany and natural product development, the application of remote sensing and geographic information systems to natural resources development and management, water conservation and water reuse, desertification monitoring, economic development, and, more recently, health issues in arid environments. In addition, and integral to this work has been a complementary program for bringing the results of this and other drylands research to people around world in the most cost-effective manner. To this end, the Arid Lands Information Center, a division of OALS, has been active in the generation and publication of a variety of outreach materials using multiple formats and drawing on computer and communications technologies. Beginning its dissemination efforts with print bibliographies, directories, and information papers, the Center quickly saw the advantage of moving into the realm of computerized databases to increase information access and currency. In the 1970 s, this meant using punch cards and a mainframe computer and, later, with stand-alone desktop microcomputers. In recent years, the Center has turned to the Internet as the preferred dissemination tool, becoming a major producer of quality Web sites dealing with arid lands and agriculture-related themes. Building on the experience gained during the past ten years, and using as a guide the model developed over time for collaborative Web site projects, the Center's team of Web and Information Specialists are now proposing to create a portal to drylands information that will meet multiple user needs. This paper documents the need and the opportunity for developing such a portal through an international collaboration. It also presents...|$|R
