In Leipzig, a society of young theologians was formed under his influence for the learned study and devout application of the Bible. Three magistrates belonging to that society, {{one of whom was}} August Hermann Francke, subsequently the founder of the famous orphanage at Halle (1695), commenced courses of expository lectures on the Scriptures of a practical and devotional character, and in the German language, which were zealously frequented by both students and townsmen. The lectures, however, aroused the ill-will of the other theologians and pastors of Leipzig, and Francke and his friends left the city, and with the aid of Christian Thomasius and Spener founded the new University of Halle. The theological chairs in the new university were filled in complete conformity with Spener's proposals. The main difference between the new Pietistic Lutheran school and the orthodox Lutherans arose from the Pietists' conception of Christianity as chiefly consisting in a change of heart and consequent holiness of life. Orthodox Lutherans rejected this viewpoint as a <b>gross</b> <b>simplification,</b> stressing the need for the church and for sound theological underpinnings.|$|E

The numerical approximations do not {{deal with this problem}} but with an analytical model the solution is held in form of an equation.

Additionally, for the simulation of regenerative gas cycles it is possible to calculate directly the periodical-steady state of the system.

40|$|AbstractThin sheet {{materials}} of low bending stiffness but high membrane stiffness are often corrugated {{in order to}} achieve improvements of several orders of magnitude in bending stiffness with only minimal increases in weight and cost. If these corrugated sheets are initially curved along the corrugations, much of this stiffness gain is lost. In return, the sheets are then capable of significant elastic changes in shape overall, including large changes in overall Gaussian curvature. These shape changes are described here by non-linear and coupled kinematical relationships, which are verified against experiment and finite-element simulations. It is found that <b>gross</b> <b>simplifications</b> can be made about the large displacement behaviour of such shells without a loss of accuracy...|$|R

Economics cannot provide a convincing overarching theory of government action or of social action more generally.

Traditional mathematical economics is widely viewed to have been compromised through <b>gross</b> <b>simplifications</b> with many assumptions that are now seen to be unjustified. New ways of looking at economics that are more grounded in reality are required, and agent-based computational eco- nomics is now receiving a lot of attention. Although the ideas are not new, the previous attempts to use this approach have been largely lim- ited by the inability to model realistically large systems with millions of complex agents.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, a General Algorithm {{is applied to}} the {{analysis}} of high-rise structures. This algorithm is {{to be used as a}} calculation tool in preliminary design; it allows to define the interaction between closed and open, straight or curved shear-walls, and the forces exchanged in structures subject to mainly horizontal loads. The analysis can be performed in both static and dynamic regimes, the mode shapes and the natural frequencies being assessed. This general formulation allows analyses of high-rise structures by taking into account the torsional rigidity and the warping deformations of the elements composing the building without <b>gross</b> <b>simplifications.</b> In thisway it is possible to model the structure as a single equivalent cantilever, thus minimising the degrees of freedom of the system, and consequently the calculation time. Finally, potentials of the method proposed are demonstrated by a numerical example which emphasizes the link between global displacements and stresses in the elements composing the structure...|$|R

Such models are simpler to formulate and cheaper to operate than three dimensional general circulation models, while avoiding some of the <b>gross</b> <b>simplifications</b> of one dimensional models. Nevertheless, the parameterization of eddy fluxes required in a 2 -D model is not a trivial problem. This fact has apparently led some to interpret the shortcomings of existing 2 -D models as indicating that the parameterization procedure is wrong in principle. There are grounds to believe that these shortcomings result primarily from incorrect implementations of the predictions of eddy transport theory and that a properly based parameterization may provide a good basis for atmospheric modeling. The existence of these GCM-derived coefficients affords an unprecedented opportunity to test {{the validity of the}} flux-gradient parameterization. To this end, a zonally averaged (2 -D) model was developed, using these coefficients in the transport parameterization. Results from this model for a number of contrived tracer experiments were compared with the parent GCM. The generally good agreement substantially validates the flus-gradient parameterization, and thus the basic principle of 2 -D modeling...|$|R

5000|$|Beginning in France {{after the}} theatre {{monopolies}} were abolished in 1791 during the French Revolution, melodrama {{became the most}} popular theatrical form of the century. Although monopolies and subsidies were reinstated under Napoleon, theatrical melodrama continued to be more popular and brought in larger audiences than the state-sponsored drama and operas. Although melodrama {{can be traced back}} to classical Greece, the term mélodrame did not appear until 1766 and only became popular after 1800. August von Kotzebue's Misanthropy and Repentance (1798) is often considered the first melodramatic play. The plays of Kotzebue and René Charles Guilbert de Pixérécourt established melodrama as the dominant dramatic form of the early 19th century. David Grimsted, in his book Melodrama Unveiled (1968), argues that:Its conventions were false, its language stilted and commonplace, its characters stereotypes, and its morality and theology <b>gross</b> <b>simplifications.</b> Yet its appeal was great and understandable.

It is regrettable that it is inevitably necessary to discard data published specifically with the intention of helping engineers; it is hoped that no offence is caused. For laminar flow, data were found that had not appeared in any simplified guide. For turbulent flow, there is a case to be made for a re-investigation of the pressure loss factors that occur with standard manufactured components, since some of the best data are taken from generalised work on larger dimensions artificially roughened to simulate pipework. The only data considered as reliable for tees concern tees made of malleable iron.

40|$|Three-dimensional {{mathematical}} {{models of}} the tibio-femoral joint require input of the geometry of articulating surfaces and ligament insertions, and the mechanical properties of cartilage and ligaments. This paper describes a validation of a knee model through a direct specimen-related comparison between the knee model and the kinematics of four knee joint specimens from which the geometry data were used as input of the model. The knee model is quasi-static {{and is based on}} equilibrium of forces and moments. The stiffness properties of the ligaments and articular cartilage were estimated on the basis of data reported in the literature. The so-called reference strains in the ligament bundles for the joint in extension, were determined by using an optimization procedure, minimizing the difference between the kinematics of the model and the kinematics of experimentally obtained flexion motions with an internally or an externally rotated tibia (+/- 3 Nm load). A reasonable to good agreement between the model and the experimental kinematics could be obtained for internal-external rotation laxity and the coupled translations and varus-valgus rotation. The disparity between model and experiment varied from knee to knee, average deviations ranging from close to zero to 8 degrees internal rotation deviation and from 5 mm posterior to 3 mm anterior position deviation. The average anterior-posterior laxities at both 20 degrees and 90 degrees flexion were within the variations reported in the literature, although for each individual joint with some underestimation or overestimation. It was concluded that the optimization procedure compensated for the lack of menisci and capsular structures by higher prestrains, thereby overestimating the ligament forces.
