40|$|Abstract. Interference {{imposes a}} major {{challenge}} for efficient data communication in wireless networks. Increased level of interference may increase number of collisions, energy consumption and latency due to retransmissions of the interfered data. Interference of a link {{is the number of}} nodes interfered while a pair of nodes are communicating over a bi-directional link. Approaches have been proposed to reduce interference by <b>dropping</b> <b>links</b> that create high interference. However, <b>dropping</b> <b>links</b> make a network more susceptible to node failure/departure–a frequent phenomenon in ad hoc networks. Thus <b>dropping</b> high interference <b>links</b> while keeping the network significantly connected is an important goal to achieve. In this paper, we formulate the problem of constructing minimum interference path preserving and fault tolerant wireless ad hoc networks and then provide algorithms, both centralized and distributed with local information, to solve the problem. Moreover, {{for the first time in}} literature, we conceive the concept of fault tolerant interference spanner and provide a local algorithm to construct such spanner of a communication graph. ...|$|R

This paper present the new mechanism named as Distributed Alternative Binding Cache mechanism (DABC), to reduce the packet loss in MIPv 6 network environments and also reduce the signaling overheads resulted from deleted links. Network simulator NS- 2 has been used to evaluate this mechanism and compare it with the original NEMO...|$|E

As the slide continues rearward, a claw extractor pulls the spent casing from the firing chamber and an ejector strikes {{the rear of the}} case, pivoting it out and away from the pistol. The slide stops and is then propelled forward by a spring to strip a fresh cartridge from the magazine and feed it into the firing chamber.

At each discrete time instant, the sensor can decide whether to transmit, with each transmission incurring a fixed energy cost. Performance is quantified via an optimization problem that minimizes a convex combination of the expected error covariance at the remote estimator and expected energy usage. For transmission schedules dependent only on the error covariance at the remote estimator, this work establishes that a threshold policy (i. e. transmit if the error covariance exceeds a certain threshold and don't transmit otherwise) is optimal. This provides a rigorous justification {{for the use of}} such threshold policies in event triggered estimation. An extension of the result to Markovian packet drops is also outlined...|$|R

Using an expected error covariance performance measure, we consider optimal and suboptimal methods for finding the best relay configuration, and power control problems for optimizing the Kalman filter performance.

40|$|The most {{fundamental}} problem in wireless ad-hoc networks {{is to determine}} a connected communication subgraph that satisfies desirable topological properties by assigning appropriate transmission power to each node. Some of the properties considered by {{a vast majority of}} researchers include minimum-energy, fault tolerance, minimum interference, and bounded node degree. However preserving two or more combination of these properties at the same time is harder to achieve and often overlooked by the research community. In this paper, we propose a topology control algorithm that preserves connectivity and combines two other important properties, e. g, (a) minimum interference, and (b) fault tolerance. Interestingly, these two properties create a fundamental tradeoff by running against each other. In one end, interference can be reduced by <b>dropping</b> <b>links</b> that create high interference. On the other end, <b>dropping</b> too many <b>links</b> make a network more susceptible to node failure/departure. Thus <b>dropping</b> high interference <b>links</b> while keeping the network significantly connected is an important goal to achieve. We achieve such goal by formulating the problem of constructing minimum interference path preserving and fault tolerant wireless ad hoc networks under the same framework and then provide algorithms, both centralized and distributed with local information, to solve the problem. Moreover, {{for the first time in}} literature, we conceive the concept of fault tolerant interference spanner and provide a local algorithm to construct such spanner of a communication graph. Key words: graph theory, network topology, interference, fault tolerance, wireless ad hoc networks, interference-aware topology, stretch factor, sparse topology. ...|$|R

40|$|Tags {{have been}} shown to be a simple yet {{effective}} way of organising what are effectively selfish groups. In particular, Hales has shown that when individuals use the SLAC algorithm (and variant SLACER algorithm) for network structure, the system can maintain a high level of overall performance. Furthermore, the system is self-regulating, in that although groups of “parasites” may emerge, and for a short time prosper, they will eventually be expelled from their group and forced to change their ways – not by any explicit social process, just as an emergent property of the algorithm. This paper explores a further variant on the SLAC algorithm, in which agents attempted to be more “smart ” about their network structure, by preferentially <b>dropping</b> <b>links</b> to neighbours who had not aided them. The surprising result is that a system of these agents very quickly devolves to minimal performance, instead of seeing an increase in performance.

40|$|The paper {{introduces}} {{a class of}} zero-sum games between the adversary and controller as a scenario for a `denial of service' in a networked control system. The communication link is modeled {{as a set of}} transmission regimes controlled by a strategic jammer whose intention is to wage an attack on the plant by choosing a most damaging regime-switching strategy. We demonstrate that even in the one-step case, the introduced games admit a saddle-point equilibrium, at which the jammer's optimal policy is to randomize in a region of the plant's state space, thus requiring the controller to undertake a nontrivial response which is different from what one would expect in a standard stochastic control problem over a packet <b>dropping</b> <b>link.</b> The paper derives conditions for the introduced games to have such a saddle-point equilibrium. Furthermore, we show that in more general multi-stage games, these conditions provide `greedy' jamming strategies for the adversary. Comment: Accepted for publication in Automatic...|$|R
