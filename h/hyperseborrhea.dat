500|$|Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} {{affects the}} skin and {{increases the risk of}} tumors in the kidneys and lungs. The condition is characterized by multiple noncancerous dome-shaped tumors of the hair follicles (fibrofolliculomas), particularly on the face, neck, and—more rarely—the upper chest. The fibrofolliculomas are generally described as having an opaque white color or a yellowish tone and have a waxy, smooth texture. The tumors are always found on and around the nose and on and behind the outer ear. Typically, they first appear in a person's 20s or 30s, and are found in more than 80% of people with the syndrome above the age of 40. [...] The tumors become larger and more numerous over time. Tumors differ between individuals: they may appear merged in plaques, look similar to a comedo with a plug of keratin, or include epidermoid cysts. A large number of tumors on the face can be associated with <b>hyperseborrhea</b> (abnormally elevated sebum production). The presence of fibrofolliculomas on a person's face can cause significant psychological distress.|$|E

40|$|Acne vulgaris is {{a highly}} {{prevalent}} skin disorder characterized by <b>hyperseborrhea,</b> inflammation, and Propionibacterium acnes overgrowth. Only isotretinoin and hormonal therapy reduce sebum production. To identify a new drug candidate that modulates sebum, we {{examined the effects of}} EGCG, the major polyphenol in green tea, on human SEB- 1 sebocytes and in patients with acne. In SEB- 1 sebocytes, we found that EGCG reduced sebum by modulating the AMPK–SREBP- 1 signaling pathway. EGCG also reduces inflammation by suppressing the NF-κB and AP- 1 pathways. EGCG also induces cytotoxicity of SEB- 1 sebocytes via apoptosis and decreases the viability of P. acnes, thus targeting almost all the pathogenic features of acne. Finally, and most importantly, EGCG significantly improved acne in an 8 -week randomized, split-face, clinical trial, and was well tolerated. Our data provide a therapeutic rationale for the use of EGCG in acne...|$|E
40|$|Bodo C Melnik Department of Dermatology, Environmental Medicine and Health Theory, University of Osnabrück, Germany Abstract: Acne vulgaris, an {{epidemic}} inflammatory skin disease of adolescence, {{is closely related}} to Western diet. Three major food classes that promote acne are: 1) hyperglycemic carbohydrates, 2) milk and dairy products, 3) saturated fats including trans-fats and deficient ω- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Diet-induced insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF- 1) -signaling is superimposed on elevated IGF- 1 levels during puberty, thereby unmasking the impact of aberrant nutrigenomics on sebaceous gland homeostasis. Western diet provides abundant branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), glutamine, and palmitic acid. Insulin and IGF- 1 suppress the activity of the metabolic transcription factor forkhead box O 1 (FoxO 1). Insulin, IGF- 1, BCAAs, glutamine, and palmitate activate the nutrient-sensitive kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC 1), the key regulator of anabolism and lipogenesis. FoxO 1 is a negative coregulator of androgen receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), liver X receptor-α, and sterol response element binding protein- 1 c (SREBP- 1 c), crucial transcription factors of sebaceous lipogenesis. mTORC 1 stimulates the expression of PPARγ and SREBP- 1 c, promoting sebum production. SREBP- 1 c upregulates stearoyl-CoA- and Δ 6 -desaturase, enhancing the proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids in sebum triglycerides. Diet-mediated aberrations in sebum quantity (<b>hyperseborrhea)</b> and composition (dysseborrhea) promote Propionibacterium acnes overgrowth and biofilm formation with overexpression of the virulence factor triglyceride lipase increasing follicular levels of free palmitate and oleate. Free palmitate functions as a “danger signal,” stimulating toll-like receptor- 2 -mediated inflammasome activation with interleukin- 1 β release, Th 17 differentiation, and interleukin- 17 -mediated keratinocyte proliferation. Oleate stimulates P. acnes adhesion, keratinocyte proliferation, and comedogenesis via interleukin- 1 α release. Thus, diet-induced metabolomic alterations promote the visible sebofollicular inflammasomopathy acne vulgaris. Nutrition therapy of acne has to increase FoxO 1 and to attenuate mTORC 1 /SREBP- 1 c signaling. Patients should balance total calorie uptake and restrict refined carbohydrates, milk, dairy protein supplements, saturated fats, and trans-fats. A paleolithic-like diet enriched in vegetables and fish is recommended. Plant-derived mTORC 1 inhibitors and ω- 3 -PUFAs are promising dietary supplements supporting nutrition therapy of acne vulgaris.
