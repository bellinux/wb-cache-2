2500|$|Reflecting {{a further}} industry-wide {{adoption}} of smaller vehicle designs {{in the interest}} of improved fuel efficiency and <b>emissions</b> <b>compliance,</b> the Thunderbird was redesigned for 1980 on the compact Ford Fox platform, which first appeared only two years prior {{as the basis for the}} Ford Fairmont. Compared to the previous Torino-based Thunderbird and its large [...] wheelbase and [...] overall length, the new Thunderbird lost [...] of wheelbase and [...] in overall length. The squarish styling seen in the previous generation Thunderbird was favored for the new model, but the small car platform resulted in a poor translation with a distinctly upright appearance. Frameless door glass was no longer used; a chrome metal frame was used, making this car more like a two-door sedan. Combined with the poor performing [...] Windsor V8 as a base engine, and a C5 3 speed transmission with 2.26 rear gears, this Thunderbird generation was not well received by the public. The available 5.0L (302 cid) Windsor V8 with the AOD automatic overdrive transmission, coupled with a 3.45 rear end gear, was a welcome alternative to the 255, but with only [...] performance was moderately enhanced. Significantly, though failing to generate any new interest for the Thunderbird, a six-cylinder engine was made available for the first time in the Thunderbird's history in 1981, the [...] Thriftpower Six. For 1982 this was followed up with the replacement of the straight-six with a more modern V6, the 3.8L Essex, which was also now the Thunderbird's standard engine. It came equipped with a Motorcraft 2150 2V carburator. Hurting the Thunderbird's sales performance further, the 302 V8 did not return for 1982, leaving the 255 Cubic inch V8 as the only alternative engine. At 288,638 examples produced between 1980 and 1982, the eighth generation Thunderbird was barely more successful than the final model year of the previous Thunderbird generation. In order to revive the Thunderbird's success, a redesign was needed and Ford would deliver one for 1983.|$|E

A portion of this may condense on ash particles in time to be collected by cold-side particulate removal equipment. This research focuses on identifying the rate-limiting steps associated with inherent mercury capture. Key areas are enhancement of mercury oxidation and providing a sufficient amount of an appropriate surface (e. g., ash aerosol) under the correct conditions to promote inherent capture. 7 refs., 1 fig...|$|R

40|$|To better {{prepare for}} a {{changing}} world, both regarding expected events and unforeseen incidents, flexible design solutions should be considered when projects with a long lifetime and significant investment costs are planned. Accordingly, {{the main focus of}} this PhD project is the evaluation of reconfiguration flexibility for important ship design problems. As the potential value of flexible design features can only be seen if future uncertainty is explicitly considered in the evaluation process, stochastic decision support methods are suggested as the methodical approach. The increased focus on harmful emissions and emission regulations will constraint many ship design problems significantly, especially related to the design of machinery systems. An important question becomes that of minimum cost compliance, i. e. how to comply with current and future emission regulations at a minimum cost. Furthermore, <b>emission</b> regulation <b>compliance</b> typically involves considering both an initial investment and an operational cost. As the operational cost depends on factors that change with time, it should be acknowledged that this cost to some extent will be uncertain. Again, this suggests that models able to consider future uncertainty are used for such decision problems. In light of these observations, four research questions were formed for this PhD project: How can future uncertainty and reconfiguration flexibility be included in the ship design process using stochastic optimization methods? How can aspects related to <b>emission</b> regulation <b>compliance</b> for ships (which are strongly affected by future uncertainty) be included in the design process? What uncertainties are most important when making design decisions related to energy efficiency and <b>emission</b> regulation <b>compliance</b> for ships? What is the value of accounting for future uncertainty and reconfiguration flexibility in the design process? In this PhD project, stochastic decision support models have been proposed for various machinery design problems, where also <b>emission</b> regulation <b>compliance</b> has been included. For the considered problems where <b>emission</b> regulations <b>compliance</b> was included in the problem, future fuel prices were identified as the most critical in terms of future uncertainty. For offshore vessels with diesel electric machinery, development in engine efficiencies was identified as the most important uncertainty. Furthermore, results show that by using stochastic optimization models, one obtain valuable information about whether to facilitate for future reconfigurations, which in the end can result in a design better prepared for expected events and unforeseen incidents. It was also found that lifecycle costs can be significantly reduced by including aspects related to emission regulations when making decisions, in particular for machinery design problems and fleet renewal problems...|$|R

40|$|Virtually every {{analysis}} of cap-and-trade programs assumes that firms must sur-render permits as they pollute. However, no program, existing or proposed, requires such continual compliance.
