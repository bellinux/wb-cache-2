40|$|A {{dissertation}} {{submitted to}} the Faculty of Science, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, in fulfilment of requirements for the degree of Master of Science. Johannesburg, 30. 09. 2014. ABSTRACT In this dissertation we study {{the action of the}} one loop dilatation operator on operators with a classical dimension of order N. We consider the su(3) and su(2) sectors. The operators in the su(3) sector are constructed using three complex fields X, Y and Z, while operators in the su(2) sector are constructed from only the two complex fields Y and Z. For the operators in these sectors non-planar diagrams contribute already at the leading order in N and the planar and large N limits are distinct. Although the spectrum of anomalous dimensions in su(3) has been computed for this class of operators, previous studies have neglected certain terms which were argued to be small. After dropping these terms diagonalizing the dilatation operator reduces to diagonalizing a set of decoupled oscillators. In this dissertation we explicitly compute the terms which were neglected previously and show that diagonalizing the dilatation operator still reduces to diagonalizing a set of decoupled oscillators. In the su(2) sector the action of the one loop and the two loop dilatation operator reduces to a set of decoupled oscillators and factorizes into an action on the Z fields and an action on the Y fields. Direct computation has shown that the action on the Y fields is the same at one and two loops. In this dissertation, using the su(2) symmetry algebra as well as structural features of field theory, we give compelling evidence that the factor in the dilatation operator that acts on the Y s is given by the one loop expression, at any loop order.

40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} to determine how glycerol affects macromolecular syntheses and nucleoside triphosphate levels in a strain of Escherichia coli that lacks a functional sn-glycerol- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase. The addition of glycerol to cultures of this strain, Lin 8, growing on a gluconeogenic carbon source causes immediate growth stasis (N. R. Cozzarelli, J. P. <b>Koch,</b> <b>S.</b> Hayashi, and E. C. C. Lin, J. Bacteriol. 90 : 1325 - 1329, 1965). Immediately after the addition of glycerol to cultures of Lin 8, the syntheses of DNA, RNA, and protein are completely inhibited. Phospholipid synthesis is not inhibited as severely by glycerol. The addition of glycerol to strain Lin 8 also results in a rapid decrease in its nucleoside triphosphate levels. The total intracellular concentration of ATP in strain Lin 8 was reduced by 85 % within 30 s after the addition of glycerol. These {{results suggest that the}} glycerol-induced inhibition of growth and macromolecular syntheses may be a secondary consequence of the decreased energy supply in this strain.

Theoretical and Applied Genetics, 103, (5), 696 - 701. An F 1 hybrid (n= 4 x= 28) between the tetraploid species Festuca arundinacea var. glaucescens (GGG?G?) and a synthetic tetraploid Lolium multiflorum (LmLmLmLm) was backcrossed to diploid L. multiflorum to produce triploid (2 n= 3 x= 21) BC 1 hybrids (LmLmG). At metaphase I of meiosis the triploids had a preponderance of ring bivalents and univalents with some linear and frying-pan trivalents. Genomic in situ hybridisation (GISH) differentiated the Festuca chromosomes from Lolium and revealed that the bivalents were exclusively between Lolium homologues, while the univalents were Festuca. Despite the limited amount of homoeologous chiasmata pairing in the triploids, some recombinant chromosomes were recovered in the second backcross when the hybrids were further crossed to diploid L. multiflorum. The progeny from the second backcross was predominantly diploid. Genotypes with recombinant chromosomes and chromosome additions involving an extra Festuca chromosome were identified using GISH.

Bacteriol. 90 : 1325 – 1329. 1965. —Cells of Escherichia coli K- 12 {{can grow}} on either glycerol or l-α-glycerophosphate {{as the sole}} source of carbon and energy. The {{first step in the}} dissimilation of glycerol requires a kinase, and the initial process of utilization of l-α-glycerophosphate involves an active transport system. In either case, intracellular l-α-glycerophosphate is an intermediate whose further metabolism depends upon a dehydrogenase. When this enzyme is lost by mutation, the cells not only fail to grow on glycerol or l-α-glycerophosphate, but are subject to growth inhibition in the presence of either compound. Resistance to inhibition by glycerol can be achieved by the loss of glycerol kinase. Such cells are still susceptible to growth inhibition by l-α-glycerophosphate. Similarly, in dehydrogenase-deficient cells, immunity to exogenous l-α-glycerophosphate can be achieved by genetic blocking of the active transport system. Such cells are still sensitive to free glycerol in the growth medium. Reversal of inhibition by glycerol or l-α-glycerophosphate in cells lacking the dehydrogenase can also be brought about by the addition of glucose. Glucose achieves this effect without recourse to catabolite repression. Our results suggest that growth stasis associated with the over-accumulation of l-α-glycerophosphate is due to interference with other cellular processes by competition with physiological substrates rather than to depletion of cellular stores of adenosine triphosphate or inorganic phosphate...|$|R

In this context, carbon coated ZnFe 2 O 4 (C-ZFO) has attracted increasing interest as promising new anode material {{because it offers}} an exceptional specific capacity, higher than 1000 mAh g- 1, and it is environmentally friendly, non toxic and cheap. 1 This electrode material {{has been used in}} SIRBATT project in order to investigate the evolution of Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) in this anode because the performances and durability of batteries are strongly influenced by the passivation layer formed on electrode surface. 2 The electrodes have been prepared by casting the slurry containing active material, conductive carbon and carboxymethyl cellulose as binder. The electrochemical performances and the study of electrode/electrolyte interface have been investigated by galvanostatic cycles at different C-rate values, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) at 25 °C and 50 °C and soft X-ray adsorption spectroscopy (XAS) using synchrotron radiation. The electrochemical results have shown that C-ZFO has good cycling performance, with high capacity values also at highest rates, and high stability upon cycling. Furthermore, EIS measurements have reveal that the electrode interfacial stability is more compromised at high temperatures. The XAS results have allowed to obtain important information on SEI formation and evolution upon C-ZFO electrodes.
