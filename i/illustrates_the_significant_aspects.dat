40|$|Education and {{particularly}} the higher education have the task not only {{to react to the}} quasi-globalization trends, but rather {{to play a role in}} the development of desirable future society, leading to qualitative changes designed to preserve the identity of diverse communities and tolerance based on communication knowledge and understanding the interests of each participant in this process. Without claiming to discuss in a general register this topic (although very broad in its essence), I just tried to achieve a brief scan of the bidirectional impact of globalization-internationalization (whether as understood in the literature – Americanization, Europeanization, homogenization, diversification) it has in higher education. Of course, the approach was focused mainly on the effects of the opportunities of internationalization of global education they have or shoud have on higher education and research in Romania. This paper reviews the international realities of higher education for thtree important poles of the global space: U. S. A., Asia-Pacific and Europe until the beginning of the current financial crisis. Imagining a correspondance between the general profile of each region and the name of concepts of ludic space, I associated a certain notion (Monopoly, Dominoes and Puzzle) to each of the mentioned regions, arguing that associations by <b>illustrating</b> <b>the</b> most <b>significant</b> <b>aspects</b> of <b>the</b> transformations that flows globalization have forced regional systems analyzed. Considerations about the U. S. as a magnet for resources, China and the miracle of the structural reform of higher education, performance lessons that Japan offers to the world, the domino effect of novelty almost envied (Bologna process with all the innovation system) and traditional values (Humboldtian construction) in Europe, provides a summary of opinions and research of existing literature overflow. In this first part of the paper, analyzes are focused on the first two regions: USA and Asia-Pacific. ...|$|R
