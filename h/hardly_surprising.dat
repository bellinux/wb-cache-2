In the first innings at Old Trafford, he made only 19 runs but in the second he helped the Philadelphians to their nine wicket victory with a 103 not out. This score took 105 minutes to achieve and included 9 fours. His second highest first-class score came a month earlier against Nottinghamshire with a 62 not out.

Our starting point is the well-known fact that non-commutativity leads to deformed dispersion relations, relating energy and momentum, implying a frequency dependent speed of light. A Hot Big Bang Universe therefore experiences a higher speed of light as it gets hotter. We study the statistical physics of this "deformed radiation", recovering standard results at low temperatures, {{but a number of}} novelties at high temperatures: a deformed Planck's spectrum, a temperature dependent equation of state w=p/ρ (ranging from 1 / 3 to infinity), a new Stephan-Boltzmann law, and a new entropy relation.

The work's rejection and subsequent disappearance have been blamed on Striggio's disregard for Monteverdi's efforts. However, Tomlinson's reading of the correspondence suggests a different conclusion: Monteverdi, in his view, [...] "did not even come close to completing the score" [...] and may have written very little of the music.

While this may <b>hardly</b> be <b>surprising</b> {{from the point of view}} of spatial planning, it becomes controversial when viewed upon from the perspective of equality and tax fairness. We conclude that the selection of a land policy instrument can only be a direct consequence of a recognized spatial problem. We examine international practice, test the mapping method on four Slovenian municipalities (Ljubljana, Kranj, Divača, Kanal ob Soči) and conduct a survey among all Slovenian municipalities. Targeting a better activation of catalogued land and determining its true condition and potential, we use our results to conclude with a suggestion for establishing a public vacant land catalogue in form of an interactive web portal, offering users the information on spatial situation and trends while allowing them to add newly recognized vacant or degraded lands and submit assessments, comments, suggestions or initiatives. The inclusion of local inhabitants and land owners in such or similar manner can contribute significantly to general awareness of spatial planning issues and the importance of sustainable development as well as to the accuracy and completeness of the vacant land catalogue, which can ultimately improve legitimacy and feasibility of spatial planning decisions...|$|R

Only in recent decades have many rich countries caught up to, and even exceeded, the United States in years of education for young persons. At the same time that the United States led the world in mass education in the 20 th century, it rapidly expanded its economic lead. No single factor can account for the economic dominance of the United States in the 20 th century, and most of the favored explanations, be they rooted in technological, institutional, or natural re-source factors, are complementary ones.

This brief essay will introduce current definitions for religious capital and offer examples of how the concept has been used to explain religious commitment and organizational change. For now, I will not explore the effects of religious capital on secular behaviors or beliefs, such as the relationships between religious capital and civic involvement or religious capital and morality.

This empirical exercise is {{in the spirit of}} traditional econometrics.

Smith and Zin's paper is especially attractive because it seeks {{to bridge the gap between}} the calibration methodology and traditional econometrics. The central empirical question about any model is, how well does the model reproduce characteristic features of the world? If a model does repro-duce those features well [...] perchance, perfectly [...] one cannot logically deduce that the model is the true one that generated the data. What one can logi-cally deduce is that the model belongs to a class [...] much narrower than the class of all possible models [...] that can reproduce the data to a given degree of accuracy.

Calibrators have typically emphasized (e. g., Kyd-land and Prescott 1991 and 1996) that their models are highly stylized and are meant to capture certain dimensions of the data, while ignoring others. Kydland and Prescott, for example, argue that standard econometrics biases the investigator against he real-business-cycle model, because it makes the model responsible, as it were, for features of the data it was not designed to capture.
