40|$|African violets are low, <b>compact</b> <b>plants</b> with {{attractive}} dark green, thick, hairy leaves. This NebGuide covers {{various aspects}} of caring for them. The African violet (Saintpaulia ionantha) {{is one of the}} most satisfactory flowering houseplants. It is a low, <b>compact</b> <b>plant</b> with attractive dark green, thick, hairy leaves. The violet-like flowers are borne in small panicles just above the foliage. Besides various shades of blue-violet, there are also pink, fuschia, and white cultivars (varieties). Newer violets include not only cultivars with single flowers, but also those with semi-double or double rows of petals. Bi-colored flowers and those with a contrasting border are popular. Trailing cultivars and miniatures are also available. Plants kept in good condition flower almost continuously...|$|R
50|$|The {{airfield}} {{was constructed}} in record time using seconded civilian and New Zealand Armed Forces engineers. Three heavy <b>earth</b> <b>compacted</b> runways up to 2000 m long were laid in the prevailing wind directions of the region. The runway surfaces were laid with wattle tree seeds for strength while the base was designed to handle large numbers of US Boeing Flying Fortress and Consolidated Liberator bombers.|$|R
40|$|Response of {{soybeans}} {{grown in}} controlled environments to variations in temperature, photoperiod, irradiance level and spectral quality was examined. Over {{the range of}} temperatures examined day/night temperatures of 26 / 22 ℃ induced the most rapid development and a relatively <b>compact</b> <b>plant</b> habit. Simulated natural temperature programs and simulated natural progressions of daylengths did not significantly alter plant morphology when compared with growth under constant photoperiod conditions. The best selection for a suitable photoperiod duration {{was determined to be}} sunrise to sunset on May 1 at the latitude at which the variety is commonly grown. The use of incandescent lamps in the controlled-environment rooms for photoperiod control was the major cause for excessive internode elongation.

5|$|Compact Linear Fresnel Reflectors are CSP-plants {{which use}} many thin mirror strips instead of {{parabolic}} mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto two tubes with working fluid. This {{has the advantage}} that flat mirrors can be used which are much cheaper than parabolic mirrors, and that more reflectors can {{be placed in the}} same amount of space, allowing more of the available sunlight to be used. Concentrating linear fresnel reflectors can be used in either large or more <b>compact</b> <b>plants.</b>|$|R
50|$|Initial {{attempts}} to cultivate it by Cheel and Joseph Maiden in Sydney were unsuccessful. Telopea mongaensis is {{more tolerant of}} shade, heavier soils and cooler climates than its more showy relative. It grows as a more <b>compact</b> <b>plant</b> of around 2 m in height in full sun. It is frost tolerant and has been grown in southern England, and has been awarded an Award of Merit by the Royal Horticultural Society in 1980. It attracts birds to the garden.|$|R
40|$|To reduce energy {{consumption}} in greenhouses, temperature integration can be used. However, the temperature integration principle considers only average temperatures {{and does not}} comply with the DIF concept (difference between mean day temperature and mean night temperature). With DIF, stem elongation, {{one of the major}} quality aspects of many crops, can be controlled. Short <b>compact</b> <b>plants</b> can be achieved by a negative DIF (average night temperature > average day temperature). In spring, summer and autumn temperature integration usually results in positive DIF and therefore longer stems. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether temperature integration and DIF could be applied simultaneously. Greenhouse temperature fluctuates with temperature integration. During spring or autumn it is difficult to obtain short <b>compact</b> <b>plants</b> by a negative DIF with regular temperature integration. In this research, temperature integration was therefore modified by applying two independent integration regimes, one for daytime and one for nighttime while a zero DIF was set. Simulations and experiments with standard temperature control, regular and modified temperature integration showed that temperature integration and DIF could be applied simultaneously, while {{energy consumption}} and stem elongation were reduce...|$|R

50|$|Until the 1990s, the Ecke family, who {{had moved}} their {{operation}} to Encinitas, California, in 1923, had a virtual monopoly on poinsettias owing to a technique that made their plants much more attractive. They produced a fuller, more <b>compact</b> <b>plant</b> by grafting two varieties of poinsettia together. A poinsettia left to grow on its own will naturally take an open, somewhat weedy look.
