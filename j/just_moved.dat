5|$|Regarded {{as one of}} {{the best}} players in Northwestern Ontario, Phillips moved east to Montreal in September 1902 to study {{electrical}} engineering at McGill University. He joined the university's hockey team, which had <b>just</b> <b>moved</b> to a new Canadian university league, and was immediately named captain. Phillips only played one match for McGill, on January 23, 1903 against Queen's University; McGill lost 7–0. Days after the game the Montreal Hockey Club asked Phillips to join them for their Stanley Cup challenge series against the Winnipeg Victorias. This required the approval of the other university clubs, which agreed on the condition that Phillips end his McGill career, which he did. Montreal won the series, with Phillips finishing third on the team in scoring with six goals in four games. Phillips also earned praise for his defensive efforts, in particular his ability to stop Tony Gingras.|$|E
5|$|The {{film is a}} {{domestic}} thriller telling of a family's destruction {{by the introduction of}} a sexually predatory femme fatale into the household. A composer has <b>just</b> <b>moved</b> into a two-story house {{with his wife and two}} children. When his wife becomes exhausted from working at a sewing machine to support the family, the composer hires a housemaid to help with the work around the house. The new housemaid behaves strangely, catching rats with her hands, spying on the composer, seducing him and eventually becoming pregnant by him. The composer's wife convinces the housemaid to induce a miscarriage by falling down a flight of stairs. After this incident, the housemaid's behavior becomes increasingly more erratic. She kills the composer's son, and then persuades the composer to commit suicide with her by swallowing rat poison. The film ends with the composer reading the story from a newspaper with his wife. The narrative of the film has apparently been told by the composer, who then warns the film audience that this is just the sort of thing could happen to anyone.|$|E
5|$|Bozon {{grew up in}} Germany and Switzerland {{while his}} father played hockey in those countries, and began to play hockey in Mannheim, Germany while {{his father was a}} member of Adler Mannheim of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga. When Philippe moved to Switzerland, Bozon followed, and was a player for the junior clubs of Genève-Servette HC, the Kloten Flyers and HC Lugano. At age 15 Bozon decided he wanted to follow the path of Nino Niederreiter, a fellow Swiss junior player who had <b>just</b> <b>moved</b> to North America at age 17 and joined a team in the Canadian Hockey League (CHL) to further his career. Bozon wanted to {{eventually}} play in the National Hockey League and realized there were more scouts following teams in the CHL, which oversees three major junior hockey leagues in Canada and the United States. He had preferred to play for a team in the Ontario Hockey League, but was instead selected by the Kamloops Blazers of the Western Hockey League, twenty-seventh overall at the 2011 CHL Import Draft. He joined the Blazers for the 2011–12 season and played 71 games for them, recording 36 goals and 35 assists for 71 points. His goal total was the most among all WHL rookies, his points second among rookies and third overall on the Blazers. Bozon was recognised for his efforts by being named the WHL's Western Conference nominee for the Jim Piggott Memorial Trophy as WHL rookie-of-the-year. He also was a co-recipient of the Blazers rookie-of-the-year award, sharing it with goaltender Cole Cheveldave.|$|E

5|$|In 1975–76 Shero {{guided the}} Flyers to a 51–13–16 record {{highlighted}} by a 36–2–2 home ice record. Again {{they won the}} Patrick division and finished first overall in the Campbell Conference. The season saw the club set franchise records in points and winning percentage. The season also witnessed an exhibition game, that {{would become one of}} the most famous games in Flyers history. In 1976 the Soviet Red Army team toured North America and played four games against NHL clubs. On January 11, 1976, the Russians matched up against the Flyers at the Spectrum in Philadelphia. Entering the game the Red Army team was unbeaten, defeating both Boston and the Rangers and registering a tie against the Canadiens. Shero had studied the Soviet style of play, even traveling to the Soviet Union during different off-seasons. Shero even implemented some of the Russian style into his own system, altering it slightly. With his knowledge of the Russian system, Shero devised a game plan. The Russian system involved making several passes often to where a player had <b>just</b> <b>moved</b> from. Shero instructed the Flyers' players not to chase the puck, but rather hold their positions. While in the offensive zone the Flyer forwards were to hold the puck as much as possible to avoid counter-attacks. The Flyers won the game by a final of 4–1 and outshot the Red Army 49–13. The victory led some to see the Flyers as the best team in the world. Following the playoffs that distinction would not last. Bernie Parent had suffered a back injury that limited him to eleven regular season games; he was able to return for the first-round series win versus Toronto. But the pain became too much for Parent to continue to play in subsequent series, and Shero was forced to use his back-up goaltender, Wayne Stephenson. The Flyers were also without second-line centre MacLeish, resulting in a depletion of scoring depth. Despite these setbacks Shero led Philadelphia past Boston in the semi-finals and back to the Stanley Cup Finals. However, the Flyers fell short of winning three straight cups, losing to Montreal in four consecutive games.|$|E
