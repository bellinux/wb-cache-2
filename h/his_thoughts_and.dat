5|$|The {{first draft}} {{and part of}} the editing process was {{completed}} before Fleming's death and the manuscript had passed through the hands of his copy editor, William Plomer, but it was not as polished as other Bond stories. Much of the detail contained in the previous novels was missing, as this was often added by Fleming in the second draft. Publishers Jonathan Cape passed the manuscript to Kingsley Amis for <b>his</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> advice on the story, although his suggestions were not subsequently used.|$|E

5|$|In Dissidia Final Fantasy (an action {{game with}} several Final Fantasy heroes and villains), Tidus is the hero from Final Fantasy X: a warrior from the goddess, Cosmos, whose father {{works for the}} rival god Chaos. Tidus has two uniforms in this game, and <b>his</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> actions refer to Final Fantasy X. With the cast, he reappears in the prequel Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy and {{represents}} Chaos in the previous war. Tidus is confronted by Yuna and offers his life to save her from an attack by the villain Emperor, but is saved by Jecht to become a warrior of Cosmos. In addition to his previous outfits, Tidus has a design based on an illustration by Square artist Yoshitaka Amano. He appears in the 2015 Dissidia reboot of the two previous games, representing Final Fantasy X. Tidus is a playable character in the Theatrhythm Final Fantasy rhythm game. He also appears in World of Final Fantasy, and Fortune Street: Dragon Quest & Final Fantasy 30th Anniversary.|$|E
5|$|The son of Harry Church Whorf and Sarah Edna Lee Whorf, Benjamin Lee Whorf {{was born}} on April 24, 1897 in Winthrop, Massachusetts. Harry Church Whorf was an artist, {{intellectual}} and designer– first working as a commercial artist and later as a dramatist. Benjamin had two younger brothers, John and Richard, who both {{went on to become}} notable artists. John became an internationally renowned painter and illustrator; Richard was an actor in films such as Yankee Doodle Dandy and later an Emmy-nominated television director of such shows as The Beverly Hillbillies. Benjamin was the intellectual of the three and at a young age he conducted chemical experiments with his father's photographic equipment. He was also an avid reader, interested in botany, astrology, and Middle American prehistory. He read William H. Prescott's Conquest of Mexico several times. At the age of 17 he began to keep a copious diary in which he recorded <b>his</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> dreams.|$|E
5|$|Wagner {{had been}} greatly {{impressed}} with his reading of Arthur Schopenhauer in 1854, and this deeply affected <b>his</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> practice on music and art. Some writers (e.g. Bryan Magee) see Parsifal as Wagner's last great espousal of Schopenhauerian philosophy. Parsifal can heal Amfortas and redeem Kundry because he shows compassion, which Schopenhauer saw as the highest form of human morality. Moreover, he displays compassion {{in the face of}} sexual temptation (act 2, scene 3). Schopenhaurian philosophy also suggests that the only escape from the ever-present temptations of human life is through negation of the Will, and overcoming sexual temptation is in particular a strong form of negation of the Will. When viewed in this light, Parsifal, with its emphasis on Mitleid ("compassion") is a natural follow-on to Tristan und Isolde, where Schopenhauer's influence is perhaps more obvious, with its focus on Sehnen ("yearning"). Indeed, Wagner originally considered including Parsifal as a character in act 3 of Tristan, but later rejected the idea.|$|E

25|$|Later Greek historians {{consider}} Democritus to {{have established}} aesthetics {{as a subject}} of investigation and study, as he wrote theoretically on poetry and fine art long before authors such as Aristotle.

25|$|The supreme deity of Tolkien's {{universe}} is called Eru Ilúvatar.

Melkor, {{who was then}} the most powerful of the Ainur, broke the harmony of the music, until Ilúvatar began first a second theme, and then a third theme, which the Ainur could not comprehend since they were not the source of it. The essence of their song symbolized the history of the whole universe and the Children of Ilúvatar that were to dwell in it—the Men and the Elves.|$|E

25|$|Charles Whitman, for instance, was a {{young man}} who studied {{architectural}} engineering at the University of Texas. Whitman had no history of violence or crime. As a child, he scored 138 on the Stanford-Binet IQ test, placing in the 99th percentile. He was an Eagle Scout, volunteered as a scoutmaster, and served in Marine Corps. In 1966 Whitman unexpectedly killed his mother as well as wife, ascended the belltower of the University of Texas, Austin, and fired a rifle at students below. He killed 15 people and wounding 31 more before police officers shot him. Whitman in his final note complained of inability to control <b>his</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> requested an autopsy, which revealed a brain tumor in the hypothalamus region of his brain, a growth that, some hypothesized, put pressure on his amygdala.|$|E
