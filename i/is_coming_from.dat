5|$|In some species, some {{soldiers}} block tunnels {{to prevent their}} enemies from entering the nest, and they may deliberately rupture themselves {{as an act of}} defence. In cases where the intrusion <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> a breach that is larger than the soldier's head, defence requires a special formations where soldiers form a phalanx-like formation around the breach and bite at intruders. If an invasion carried out by Megaponera analis is successful, an entire colony may be destroyed, although this scenario is rare.|$|E

5|$|The god Bragi asks where a thundering sound <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from,</b> {{and says}} that the benches of Valhalla are creaking—as if the god Baldr had {{returned}} to Valhalla—and that {{it sounds like the}} movement of a thousand.

Odin tells the heroes Sigmund and Sinfjötli to rise to greet Eric and invite him into the hall, if it is indeed he.|$|E
5|$|The {{whole point}} is that we are the song. The self <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> a state of pure awareness, from the state of being. All the rest that comes about in the outward manifestation of the {{physical}} world (including all the fluctuations which end up as thoughts and actions) is just clutter. The true nature of each soul is pure consciousness. So the song is really about transcending and {{about the quality of the}} transcendent.|$|E

5|$|As with electricity, {{the natural}} gas {{distribution}} network is also now all-island, with a pipeline linking Gormanston, County Meath, and Ballyclare, County Antrim completed in 2007. Most of Ireland's gas comes through interconnectors between Twynholm in Scotland and Ballylumford, County Antrim and Loughshinny, County Dublin. A decreasing supply <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> the Kinsale gas field off the County Cork coast and the Corrib Gas Field {{off the coast of}} County Mayo has yet to come on-line. The County Mayo field is facing some localised opposition over a controversial decision to refine the gas onshore.|$|E

Upon hearing the voice after a pair of Jehovah's Witnesses stop by, Ed goes downstairs and murders his neighbor, throwing her body in the furnace. When her voice talks to him again, Jerse realizes it <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> his new tattoo. Scully heads to Philadelphia and watches Pudovkin enter a tattoo parlor.

25|$|In 1971 Konstantīns Raudive wrote Breakthrough, {{detailing}} what {{he believed}} was the discovery of electronic voice phenomena (EVP). EVP {{has been described as}} auditory pareidolia. Allegations of backmasking in popular music, in which a listener claims a message has been recorded backward onto a track meant to be played forward, have also been described as auditory pareidolia. In 1995, the psychologist Diana Deutsch invented an algorithm for producing phantom words and phrases with the sounds coming from two stereo loudspeakers, with one to the listener's left and the other to his right. Each loudspeaker produces a phrase consisting of two words or syllables. The same sequence is presented repeatedly through both loudspeakers; however, they are offset in time so that one when the first sound (word or syllable) <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> the speaker on the left, the second sound <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> the speaker on the right, and vice versa. After listening for a while, phantom words and phrases suddenly emerge, and these often appear to reflect what is on the listener's mind, and they transform perceptually into different words and phrases as the sequence continues.|$|E

In a 2004 study, the El Salvador Ministry of Environment {{found that the}} waste <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> 54 industrial plants, 55 coffee processing plants, seven sugar mills, and 29 sewer systems discharging directly into the reservoir. Cerrón Grande dam was built in 1974 to drive El Salvador's largest hydroelectric project, and the 135km2 reservoir collects some 3,800 tones of excrement each year from the sewage pipes, as well as factory effluents consisting of heavy metals such as chromium and lead.|$|E
25|$|It is very {{difficult}} to defend against these types of attacks because the response data <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> legitimate servers. These attack requests are also sent through UDP, which does not require a connection to the server. This means that the source IP is not verified when a request is received by the server. In order to bring awareness of these vulnerabilities, campaigns have been started that are dedicated to finding amplification vectors which has led to people fixing their resolvers or having the resolvers shut down completely.|$|E
25|$|The loss of S2 {{was a great}} {{shock to}} the nation and to the young navy. An intense debate about the {{underlying}} reasons followed. An investigation panel was appointed to find {{the reasons for the}} disaster. At the place of the sinking, the sea bed rises sharply, and creates sharp breakers, especially when the wind <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> west or northwest. This was later considered to be the main cause of the disaster. Further, the seagoing qualities had not fully been researched in the old Russian ships. There were, for example, no stabilization tables or ballast calculations for the type.|$|E

25|$|Alternatively, Ernst (2008) advocates that {{efficient}} integration initially relies upon establishing correspondence – which sensory signals belong together. Indeed, {{studies have}} shown that visuo-haptic integration fails in adults when there is a perceived spatial separation, suggesting sensory information <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> different targets. Furthermore, if the separation can be explained, for example viewing an object through a mirror, integration is re-established and can even be optimal. Ernst (2008) suggests that adults can obtain this knowledge from previous experiences to quickly determine which sensory sources depict the same target, but young children could be deficient in this area. Once there is a sufficient bank of experiences, confidence to correctly integrate sensory signals can then be introduced in their behaviour.|$|E
25|$|Paddle down: A type of stance by the goaltender {{when the}} play <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> {{the corner to}} the front of the net and the puck carrier is {{carrying}} the puck in front of the net looking to score. Here the goaltender puts the stick down on the ground, parallel to the ice, with the leg farthest from the post down and the other up and ready to push. This works well against angled rushes or wrap arounds where the skater would normally out–skate the goalie. The skater does have the top part of the net to shoot at, but it is difficult to lift the puck over the goalie from up close. The paddle down stance is also effective against low passes from behind the net to players looking to score from the slot.|$|E
25|$|The above formula {{assumes that}} the source is either {{directly}} approaching or receding from the observer. If the source approaches the observer at an angle (but still with a constant velocity), the observed frequency that is first heard {{is higher than the}} object's emitted frequency. Thereafter, there is a monotonic decrease in the observed frequency as it gets closer to the observer, through equality when it <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> a direction perpendicular to the relative motion (and was emitted at the point of closest approach; but when the wave is received, the source and observer will no longer be at their closest), and a continued monotonic decrease as it recedes from the observer. When the observer is very close to the path of the object, the transition from high to low frequency is very abrupt. When the observer is far from the path of the object, the transition from high to low frequency is gradual.|$|E
