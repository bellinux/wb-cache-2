5|$|However <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> dwarf {{merges with}} another white dwarf (a very rare event), it will {{momentarily}} exceed the limit {{and begin to}} collapse, again raising its temperature past the nuclear fusion ignition point. Within {{a few seconds of}} initiation of nuclear fusion, a substantial fraction of the matter in the white dwarf undergoes a runaway reaction, releasing enough energy (1–) to unbind the star in a supernova explosion.|$|E
5|$|A slow-rotating {{white dwarf}} star can not exceed the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.44 solar masses without {{collapsing}} to form a neutron star or exploding as a Type Ia supernova. Once the white dwarf reaches this mass, such as by accretion or collision, the gravitational force would exceed the pressure exerted by the electrons. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> dwarf is rotating rapidly, however, the effective gravity is diminished in the equatorial region, thus allowing the white dwarf to exceed the Chandrasekhar limit. Such rapid rotation can occur, for example, {{as a result of}} mass accretion that results in a transfer of angular momentum.|$|E
5|$|The other {{possibility}} for Black {{is to keep}} his Bb4 as long as possible, exchanging it against the white knight only in favourable circumstances. A couple of attempts have been done with this in mind, with subtle variations along the moves a7–a5, b7–b6 and d7–d6. Against the mundane 10...d6 White can continue with 11.Nb3 (see diagram at right) {{to play on the}} queenside against the exposed Bb4, or 11.Nb1 to recycle the knight on the ideal d5-square. Another idea is the immediate 10...a5, to have the d6-square for the bishop, inhibit the b2–b4 push and have the possible a5–a4 pawn advance <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> knight moves to b3. In the game Mikhalevski–Chabanon (Bad Endbach 1995) Black kept the bishop with 11.Nb3 a4 12.a3Bd6 13.Nd4 Bc5 14.Nb5 d6 15.Nc3 Ng6 16.Bg3 f5 and had dynamic play.|$|E

5000|$|The {{themes of}} racism and {{morality}} are compared and contrasted, dramatically. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>whites,</b> who [...] "don't allow no niggers" [...] in town, discover the presence of Simpson, they will likely expel him or lynch him. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> victims of <b>the</b> <b>white</b> child molester complain to their mothers, they fear getting [...] "a whipping".|$|R
5000|$|The Indians were {{prompted}} to their outbreak by the wrongs committed {{against them and}} chafed under unfair treatment.

In this respect the outbreak has taught them a lesson.|$|R
5|$|These {{computations}} all {{assume that}} the white dwarf is non-rotating. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> dwarf is rotating, the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium must be modified {{to take into account}} the centrifugal pseudo-force arising from working in a rotating frame. For a uniformly rotating white dwarf, the limiting mass increases only slightly. If the star is allowed to rotate nonuniformly, and viscosity is neglected, then, as was pointed out by Fred Hoyle in 1947, there is no limit to the mass for which it is possible for a model white dwarf to be in static equilibrium. Not all of these model stars will be dynamically stable.|$|E
5|$|When a pawn {{advances}} two squares {{from its}} original square and ends the turn adjacent to a pawn of the opponent's on the same rank, it may be captured by that pawn of the opponent's, {{as if it had}} moved only one square forward. This capture is only legal on the opponent's next move immediately following the first pawn's advance. The diagrams on the right demonstrate an instance of this: <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> pawn moves from a2 to a4, the black pawn on b4 can capture it en passant, moving from b4 to a3 while the white pawn on a4 is removed from the board.|$|E

60|$|In a {{few words}} Cujo {{explained}} the situation, stating that they now held in bondage eighteen women and children, including King Susko's favorite wife Afgona. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>whites</b> were allowed {{to pass through the}} country unharmed until they, reached the village of Kwa, where the Kassai River joins the Congo, they would release all of the women and children at that point and they could go back to rejoin their husbands and fathers. <b>If,</b> on <b>the</b> other hand, the expedition was attacked <b>the</b> <b>whites</b> would put all of those in bondage to instant death.|$|R
25|$|The {{position}} in diagram 4 {{is an example}} of a pawn drawing against a queen. Stalemates of this sort can often save a player from losing an apparently hopeless position (see Queen versus pawn endgame). In that position, even if it were White's move, there is no way to avoid this stalemate without allowing Black's pawn to promote. (White may be able to win the resulting queen versus queen ending, however, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> king is close enough).|$|E
25|$|Of {{the some}} 800 people {{admitted}} to local hospitals for injuries, {{the majority are}} believed to have been white, as both black hospitals had been burned in the rioting. Additionally, even <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> hospitals had admitted blacks because of the riot, against their usual segregation policy, injured blacks had little means to get to these hospitals, which were located across the city from Greenwood. More than 6,000 black Greenwood residents were arrested and detained at three local facilities: Convention Hall, now known as the Brady Theater, the Fairgrounds (then located about a mile northeast of Greenwood), and McNulty Park (a baseball stadium at Tenth Street and Elgin Avenue).|$|E
25|$|The {{day after}} the decision, Gould says, Truesdale came {{into his office and}} {{subjected}} him to loud verbal abuse (which devolved into a shouting match) because Truesdale was upset that Gould had spoken to the New York Times about the Board's decision. Gould lunched with Mikva after the incident, at which time Mikva allegedly counseled Gould to allow Truesdale and the other Board members to write opinions supporting their votes in this high-profile case. Gould was unwilling to do this, and told Mikva that Truesdale was too deferential to the General Counsel's requests to make that a valuable exercise. On March 28, Gould learned that Truesdale was about to publish comments critical of Gould's contacts with the press during the baseball strike. Gould asked Mikva <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House would be willing to privately discipline Truesdale, but Mikva indicated it would not.|$|E

25|$|President Grant's Reconstruction policy {{worked through}} the U.S. Attorney General and the Justice Department, in {{addition}} to the Secretary of War and the War Department. During later Reconstruction white supremacists known as white liners in both the North and the South put pressure on the Grant Administration to limit the use of deployed troops in the South that protected African American citizens under the Reconstruction Act of 1867. Previously President Grant had destroyed the Ku Klux Klan under the Enforcement Acts in 1871. Resistance continued and resurged as white liners violently attacked Mississippi blacks in 1875. Republican Governor Adelbert Ames requested troops to protect black voters. In order to avoid violence, Attorney General Pierrepont sent George K. Chase to Mississippi who met with white liner leaders to hold them to their previous pledge not to use violence during the election. President Grant and Att. Gen. Pierrepont told Governor Ames to use federal troops only <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> liners used violence on election day. No violence took place on election day, however, the intimidation tactics of the white liners prior to the election kept blacks and Republican voters from the polls.|$|E
500|$|The mass of an isolated, nonrotating {{white dwarf}} cannot exceed the Chandrasekhar limit of ~1.4 [...] (This limit may {{increase}} <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> dwarf is rotating rapidly and nonuniformly.) White dwarfs in binary systems can accrete material from a companion star, increasing both their mass and their density.

A Matabele inDuna stepped out from behind a tree and announced that the enclosure was surrounded by thousands of Matabele who wanted to [...] "see <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> men were afraid to die." [...] He then fired his rifle to signal the start of the attack to his men. A volley from the Matabele riflemen followed, but most of the shots went too high; no Company trooper was hit. The only casualties of this opening volley were two of the patrol's horses. Wilson immediately ordered his men to fall back, first to an antheap, then to a thick wood. Three of them were wounded during this retreat, but none fatally.|$|E

2500|$|One of the {{simplest}} and most important uses of corresponding squares is in this king and pawn versus king endgame. [...] Assume that the black king {{is in front of}} the pawn and the white king is behind or {{to the side of the}} pawn. [...] The black king is trying to block the white pawn and the white king is supporting its pawn. [...] <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> king gets to any of the key squares (marked with [...] "x"), he wins. [...] Suppose the black king moves to the square labeled [...] "1" [...] near him (square c8). [...] Then <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> king moves to the corresponding square (also labeled [...] "1", square c6), he wins. [...] Conversely, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> king moves to the [...] "1" [...] square then the black king must move to the corresponding square to draw. [...] Thus if both kings are on the [...] "1" [...] squares, the position is a reciprocal zugzwang. Note that the second player moving to one of the corresponding squares has the advantage. [...] Being on a square when the opponent is not on the corresponding square is a disadvantage.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1959 {{game between}} Svetozar Gligorić and Bobby Fischer, Black can draw {{by keeping the}} white king from getting {{to any of the}} key squares (marked by dots).

2500|$|Any move by Black to {{the seventh}} rank loses because White can take the {{opposition}} and reach a key square. [...] (The move 1... Kd8 allows the white king to reach the key square a6.)
