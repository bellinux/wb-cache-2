25|$|Fractional Fourier {{transform}} {{can be used}} in {{time frequency}} analysis and DSP. It is useful to filter noise, but with the condition that it does not overlap with the <b>desired</b> <b>signal</b> in the time–frequency domain. Consider the following example. We cannot apply a filter directly to eliminate the noise, but {{with the help of the}} fractional Fourier transform, we can rotate the signal (including the <b>desired</b> <b>signal</b> and noise) first. We then apply a specific filter, which will allow only the <b>desired</b> <b>signal</b> to pass. Thus the noise will be removed completely. Then we use the fractional Fourier transform again to rotate the signal back and we can get the <b>desired</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
25|$|Historically {{the term}} {{aliasing}} evolved from radio engineering {{because of the}} action of superheterodyne receivers. When the receiver shifts multiple signals down to lower frequencies, from RF to IF by heterodyning, an unwanted signal, from an RF frequency equally far from the local oscillator (LO) frequency as the <b>desired</b> <b>signal,</b> but {{on the wrong side}} of the LO, can end up at the same IF frequency as the wanted one. If it is strong enough it can interfere with reception of the <b>desired</b> <b>signal.</b> This unwanted signal is known as an image or alias of the <b>desired</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
25|$|In communications, multiple-access schemes are {{orthogonal}} when {{an ideal}} receiver can completely reject arbitrarily strong unwanted {{signals from the}} <b>desired</b> <b>signal</b> using different basis functions. One such scheme is TDMA, where the orthogonal basis functions are nonoverlapping rectangular pulses ("time slots").|$|E

The poles can, e.g., {{be placed on the}} frequency bands of the <b>desired</b> <b>signals</b> to elevate the STF response and thus give gain for the <b>desired</b> <b>signals.</b> However, the pole placement elevates also the NTF response, and thus this kind of design is always a tradeoff between the noise-shaping and STF selectivity efficiencies.|$|R

25|$|Noise {{typically}} appears as random variations superimposed on the desired echo signal {{received in the}} radar receiver. The lower {{the power of the}} <b>desired</b> <b>signal,</b> the more difficult it is to discern it from the noise.

25|$|Radio {{waves from}} ≈10kHz (very low frequency) to ≈300GHz (extremely high frequency) {{propagate}} differently in interstellar space {{than on the}} Earth's surface. There are many sources of interference and signal distortion that do not exist on Earth. A great deal of radio astronomy depends on compensating for the different propagation effects to uncover the <b>desired</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
25|$|The IF stage {{includes}} a filter and/or multiple tuned circuits {{in order to}} achieve the desired selectivity. This filtering must therefore have a band pass equal to or less than the frequency spacing between adjacent broadcast channels. Ideally a filter would have a high attenuation to adjacent channels, but maintain a flat response across the <b>desired</b> <b>signal</b> spectrum in order to retain the quality of the received signal. This may be obtained using one or more dual tuned IF transformers, a quartz crystal filter, or a multipole ceramic crystal filter.|$|E
50|$|These are {{important}} {{both in the}} simulation of particle experiments (often using event generators); and interpretation and analysis of data so as to filter out the <b>desired</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|R
40|$|For the inter-cell co-channel {{interference}} problems in cellular networks,the paper studies the decoupled filter aiming at {{the cancellation of}} {{co-channel interference}}. The filter is imposed on whitening the interference and the noise,with the remained <b>desire</b> <b>signal</b> giving off the original symbols based on a non-linear equalization. Based on the discussion on {{the improvement of the}} filter,mainly according to the modulation of <b>desire</b> <b>signal</b> and the coverage of interference signal,different receivers are designed. Performance simulation enables a conclusion that the designed filter can be quite good trade-off in complexity and best performance...|$|R

25|$|The {{signal is}} then fed into a circuit {{where it is}} mixed with a sine wave from a {{variable}} frequency oscillator known as the local oscillator (LO). The mixer uses a non-linear component to produce both sum and difference beat frequencies signals, each one containing the modulation contained in the <b>desired</b> <b>signal.</b> The output of the mixer may include the original RF signal at fRF, the local oscillator signal at fLO, and the two new heterodyne frequencies fRF+fLO and fRFfLO. The mixer may inadvertently produce additional frequencies such as third- and higher-order intermodulation products. Ideally, the IF bandpass filter removes all but the desired IF signal at fIF. The IF signal contains the original modulation (transmitted information) that the received radio signal had at fRF.|$|E
2500|$|The {{unwanted}} frequency {{is called}} {{the image of the}} wanted frequency, because it is the [...] "mirror image" [...] of the desired frequency reflected [...] A receiver with inadequate filtering at its input will pick up signals at two different frequencies simultaneously: the desired frequency and the image frequency. Any noise or random radio station at the image frequency can interfere with reception of the <b>desired</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
2500|$|For example, an AM {{broadcast}} {{station at}} 580nbsp&kHz is tuned on a receiver with a 455nbsp&kHz IF. The local oscillator is tuned to [...] 1035nbsp&kHz. But a signal at [...] 1490nbsp&kHz is also 455nbsp&kHz {{away from the}} local oscillator; so both the <b>desired</b> <b>signal</b> and the image, when mixed with the local oscillator, will also appear at the intermediate frequency. This image frequency is within the AM broadcast band. Practical receivers have a tuning stage before the converter, to greatly reduce the amplitude of image frequency signals; additionally, broadcasting stations {{in the same area}} have their frequencies assigned to avoid such images.|$|E
30|$|Antenna arrays at {{the base}} station (BS) can {{dramatically}} improve the capacity of a communication system [1 – 3]. Actually, they can be exploited in various ways. First, to form retrodirective beams that select the <b>desired</b> <b>signals</b> and attenuate the interfering ones. Secondly, antenna arrays {{make it possible to}} implement space-time selective transmission in the downlink. Finally, they can provide accurate localization of the user terminals [4], which is of interest in advanced handover schemes, public safety services, and intelligent transportation systems. In all these applications, accurate estimation of the directions of arrival (DOAs) of the <b>desired</b> <b>signals</b> is required.|$|R
40|$|Power {{minimization}} is {{a traditional}} method for interference suppres- sion in satellite navigation systems. It works when the interferences are much stronger than the <b>desired</b> <b>signals</b> and noise, and its main advantage is that the direction of arrival (DOA) information of the <b>desired</b> <b>signals</b> is not required. In this paper, a new method for sup- pressing strong interferences for satellite navigation based on an- tenna arrays is proposed. The idea is to replace the auxiliary antenna outputs in the traditional power minimization method by the prin- cipal components of received array signals, leading to an improved performance, as verified by our simulations...|$|R

2500|$|Earliest {{research}} towards {{what was}} later named the phase-locked loop {{goes back to}} 1932, when British researchers developed an alternative to Edwin Armstrong's superheterodyne receiver, the Homodyne or direct-conversion receiver. In the homodyne or synchrodyne system, a local oscillator was tuned to the desired input frequency and multiplied with the input signal. The resulting output signal included the original modulation information. [...] The intent was to develop an alternative receiver circuit that required fewer tuned circuits than the superheterodyne receiver. [...] Since the local oscillator would rapidly drift in frequency, an automatic correction signal {{was applied to the}} oscillator, maintaining it in the same phase and frequency of the <b>desired</b> <b>signal.</b> The technique was described in 1932, in a paper by Henri de Bellescize, in the French journal L'Onde Électrique.|$|E
2500|$|FROG and {{autocorrelation}} {{share the}} idea of combining a pulse with itself in a nonlinear medium. [...] Since a nonlinear medium will only produce the <b>desired</b> <b>signal</b> when both pulses are present {{at the same time}} (i.e. “optical gating”), varying the delay between the pulse copies and measuring the signal at each delay gives a vague estimate of the pulse length. [...] Autocorrelators measure a pulse by measuring the intensity of the nonlinear signal field. [...] Estimating the pulse length requires assuming a pulse shape, and the phase of the pulse electric field cannot be measured at all. [...] FROG extends this idea by measuring the spectrum of the signal at each delay (hence “frequency-resolved”), instead of just the intensity. [...] This measurement creates a spectrogram of the pulse, which can be used to determine the complex electric field as a function of time or frequency as long as the nonlinearity of the medium is known.|$|E
