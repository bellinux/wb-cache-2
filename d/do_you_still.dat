2500|$|Mr. Vice President, in June 2000 {{when you}} were still CEO of Halliburton, you said that U.S. {{businesses}} {{should be allowed to}} do business with Iran because, quote, [...] "Unilateral sanctions almost never work."

2500|$|The {{death of}} Tang Dynasty bass guitarist Zhang Ju (张炬), one of He Yong's best friends, on 11 May 1995 {{affected}} {{him in a}} terrible way. He Yong fell out over a record deal and sank into depression and alcoholism. In 1999, He Yong spent three months in France and the Netherlands, playing and recording music. Since his first album, He Yong has not produced any new material, which prompted one Chinese newspaper to question: [...] "He Yong, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> have energy to rock?".|$|E
2500|$|Sun Quan and his {{subjects}} were celebrating their conquest of Jing Province, with Lü Meng receiving the highest honour. During the banquet, Guan Yu's spirit suddenly possessed Lü Meng, grabbed Sun Quan and shouted, [...] "Green-eyed brat! Purple-bearded coward, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> recognise me?" [...] Sun Quan's subordinates were shocked and immediately rushed forth {{to save their}} lord. The possessed Lü Meng shoved Sun Quan away and sat on his seat. With a furious expression on his face, he boomed, [...] "Since defeating the Yellow Turban rebels, I've fought in wars for over 30 years. But I lost my life because you used an evil scheme against me. I can't feast on your flesh while I was still alive, but I can still seize Lü Meng's soul after death! I'm Guan Yunchang, the Marquis of Hanshou Village." [...] Sun Quan {{and the others were}} so terrified that they sank to their knees. Lü Meng collapsed and died, bleeding from seven body orifices. Everyone was traumatised by the scene they witnessed.|$|E

2500|$|Xiahou Dun's subordinate, Han Hao, led his men {{to outside}} Xiahou's camp, where he gave orders for the other {{officers}} to remain in their respective camps and not make any move. The situation in the other camps became stable. He then headed towards Xiahou Dun's tent and shouted at the hostage-takers, [...] "You murderous traitors, how dare you take the commander hostage! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> expect to live? I've received orders to attack the enemy, so I won't let you have your way {{just for the sake}} of one officer." [...] With tears in his eyes, he told Xiahou Dun, [...] "This is the law. I've to follow it." [...] Han Hao then ordered {{his men to}} attack the hostage-takers, who were shocked by his response and immediately gave up. The hostage-takers kowtowed and begged for their lives, [...] "We only want to obtain some money for our use and we'll leave after that." [...] Han Hao reprimanded them sternly and had them all executed. Xiahou Dun was saved.|$|E
2500|$|On 6 December 1820 Lord Grey {{wrote to}} Fitzwilliam, {{asking him to}} support {{parliamentary}} reform: [...] "Your known opinions bear no inconsiderable part in the difficulty which I feel on this subject. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> feel it quite impossible to admit any modification of them?" [...] Fitzwilliam replied on 10 December [...] "that hitherto the parliamentary reform has never been placed before me {{in a manner that}} has in the least degree weakened my objection, or lessened my apprehension of the extreme danger, that would in my opinion inevitably attend its admission". The reformers themselves could not agree on a specific reform programme, constitutional perfection would never be seen to have been reached so there would be endless reform, and that the present system was beneficial: [...] "Are we quite sure that the theoretic systems will be better for the purpose of good and free government, than the existing, undefined, indescribable mode of election, loose and various as it is?" [...] On 12 February 1821 Fitzwilliam wrote to Wood that reform was [...] "a dangerous experiment—certain destruction in the hands of vain and presumptuous fabricators of constitutions". On 17 February he again wrote to Wood: [...] "I feel the constitution is on the wane, its spirit being gone, it cannot last—whether despotism or anarchy will be the first upshot I know not, but if the constitution is not now maintained in its true spirit both will ensue".|$|E
2500|$|When Taishi Ci {{finally reached}} Luoyang after {{travelling}} day and night, {{he saw the}} provincial administration's courier near the city gate. He approached him and asked, [...] "Sir, are you delivering a document?" [...] The courier replied, [...] "Yes." [...] Taishi Ci asked again, [...] "Where is the document?" [...] The courier replied, [...] "In the carriage." [...] Taishi Ci said, [...] "Are you sure there is no mistake in the addressee's details on the document? Let me see it." [...] The courier {{did not know that}} Taishi Ci was from Donglai Commandery so he showed him the letter. Taishi Ci took out a knife and destroyed the letter. The courier started shouting, [...] "This man destroyed my document!" [...] Taishi Ci pulled him into the carriage and said, [...] "If you didn't show me the document, I wouldn't have been able to destroy it. Regardless of the consequences, neither of us can say he is not responsible for what happened. I suggest we remain silent and escape. By doing this, we can avoid punishment and keep our heads. Otherwise, both of us will be executed." [...] The courier asked, [...] "Your master sent you to destroy this document. Now that you have accomplished your mission, why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> need to go on the run?" [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "He ordered me to only check whether the document has been delivered. However, I went too far and ended up destroying the document. If I go back, I am afraid that my master will blame me, so I suggest we escape together." [...] The courier was persuaded by Taishi Ci so they fled from Luoyang together.|$|E
