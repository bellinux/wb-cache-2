50|$|This term is broadly {{similar to}} the above CPT term, with the {{exception}} that the seller is required to obtain insurance for the goods while in transit. CIP requires the seller to insure the goods for 110% of the contract value under at least the minimum cover of the <b>Institute</b> <b>Cargo</b> <b>Clauses</b> of the Institute of London Underwriters (which would be <b>Institute</b> <b>Cargo</b> <b>Clauses</b> (C)), or any similar set of clauses. The policy {{should be in the}} same currency as the contract, and should allow the buyer, the seller, and anyone else with an insurable interest in the goods {{to be able to make}} a claim.|$|E
50|$|This term is broadly {{similar to}} the above CFR term, with the {{exception}} that the seller is required to obtain insurance for the goods while in transit to the named port of destination. CIF requires the seller to insure the goods for 110% of their value under at least the minimum cover of the <b>Institute</b> <b>Cargo</b> <b>Clauses</b> of the Institute of London Underwriters (which would be <b>Institute</b> <b>Cargo</b> <b>Clauses</b> (C)), or any similar set of clauses. The policy {{should be in the}} same currency as the contract. The seller must also turn over documents necessary, to obtain the goods from the carrier or to assert claim against an insurer to the buyer. The documents include (as a minimum) the invoice, the insurance policy, and the bill of lading. These three documents represent the cost, insurance, and freight of CIF. The seller's obligation ends when the documents are handed over to the buyer. Then, the buyer has to pay at the agreed price. Another point to consider is that CIF should only be used for non-containerized seafreight; for all other modes of transport it should be replaced with CIP.|$|E
5000|$|Cargo {{insurance}}: [...] Cargo {{insurance is}} underwritten on the <b>Institute</b> <b>Cargo</b> <b>Clauses,</b> with coverage on an A, B, or C basis, A having the widest cover and C the most restricted. Valuable cargo {{is known as}} specie. Institute Clauses also exist for the insurance of specific types of cargo, such as frozen food, frozen meat, and particular commodities such as bulk oil, coal, and jute. Often these insurance conditions are developed for a specific group {{as is the case}} with the Institute Federation of Oils, Seeds and Fats Associations (FOFSA) Trades Clauses which have been agreed with the Federation of Oils, Seeds and Fats Associations and Institute Commodity Trades Clauses which are used for the insurance of shipments of cocoa, coffee, cotton, fats and oils, hides and skins, metals, oil seeds, refined sugar, and tea and have been agreed with the Federation of Commodity Associations.|$|E

40|$|Analysis and {{presentation}} of this thesis {{is supported by}} studies of many relevant cases where the major arguments are set around the exclusion clauses concerning the ‘all risks cover’ policy as found in <b>Institute</b> <b>Cargo</b> <b>Clauses.</b> Two cases are especially emphasized, namely Mayban General Assurance BHD v. Alstom Power Plants Ltd. and Global Process Systems Inc v. Syarikat Takaful Malaysia Berhad, {{mainly because of the}} special nature of the subject matter insured in these cases. The legal issues arising from claims of loss during sea transportation of large technical equipments turn out to be complicated and might lead to different application of the law due to the special nature of the subject-matter insured. All risks insurance policies have many exclusion clauses expressly listed, however, most arguments about liabilities for damage to large equipments arise from application of these two clauses, namely inherent vice and improper or insufficient packaging. Inherent vice as well as insufficiency or improper packing are both exclusion clauses for insurer's liability under an all risk insurance policy. Different interpretation of the terms themselves might lead to different judgements regarding liability. Thus identifying the sources of such terms in different legislative works becomes very important. More often than not, the causes of such types of loss are complicated and involve mutual interaction between causes, and so it is necessary to discuss how the exclusion clauses are applied as well as their interactions. In practice, damage from inherent vice can and often will develop with the assistance of a fortuitous external circumstance such as harsh weather conditions which, if qualified as a peril of the sea and considered the sole proximate cause of the loss, could guarantee the insurance cover, even if inherent vice is an excluded clause in the all risks cover policy. It is very important to discuss the causational link between perils and losses, to identify the proximate causes to the loss and to discuss the insurance cover under situations where concurrent proximate causes of similar efficiency contribute to a loss. The purpose of this thesis is to make a presentation of these two exclusion clauses for ‘all risks’ insurance cover under British marine cargo insurance policy and discuss their application in previous cases. Frequent reference to the Marine Insurance Act 1906 and the <b>Institute</b> <b>Cargo</b> <b>Clauses</b> will be found in this thesis. There will also be found a discussion from perspectives of British maritime legislation, Norwegian maritime legislation, as well as Chinese Maritime legislation. At the end of this thesis, I’d like to enclose a simple legislative comparison between British marine cargo insurance and Chinese PICC insurance policy, through which a better understanding of different approaches for solutions under different jurisdiction will be gained...|$|E
