40|$|Effects of the {{synthesis}} parameters on the structural properties of molybdenum nitride catalysts, {{prepared by the}} temperature-programmed reaction of MoO 3 with NH 3, have been examined. Molybdenum trioxide was heated in flowing NH 3 through two linear <b>heating</b> <b>segments</b> (623 to 723 K then 723 to 973 K) with different space velocities in a 23 factorial design. The temperature limits for these <b>heating</b> <b>segments</b> were defined {{based on the results}} of in situ X-ray diffraction analysis of the gas-solid reaction. The resulting catalysts were characterized using BET surface area analysis, environmental scanning electron microscopy, ex situ X-ray diffraction, and oxygen chemisorption. The primary bulk phase present was [gamma]-Mo 2 N. Some of the lower surface area catalysts also contained MoO 2 and Mo, but there was no evidence of nitrides other than [gamma]-Mo 2 N. The catalysts consisted of micrometersized, plate-like aggregates of nanometer-sized crystallites, and possessed surface areas ranging up to [approximate] 140 m 2 /g depending on {{the synthesis}} and reduction conditions employed. Statistical analysis of the results revealed that the space velocity individually and the heating rates combined had the most significant effects on the structural properties. The production of catalysts with surface areas in excess of 50 m 2 /g required the use of slow heating rates during the first segment and high space velocities. We concluded that the key to producing the highest surface area Mo nitrides was channeling the reaction through HxMoO 3 (x 2 OyN 1 -y intermediates. Passivation of the materials immediately following synthesis appeared to produce an oxynitride at the surface. Reduction of the passivated materials in H 2 at temperatures up to 673 K caused a significant increase in the surface area and O 2 uptake. The O 2 uptake for the low and medium surface area catalysts varied linearly with the BET surface area and corresponded to an O:Mo stoichiometry of approximately 1 : 5. The oxygen site density for the highest surface area nitride was lower than those for the lower surface area catalysts, presumably due to differing surface structures...|$|E

Minimization of the hot spots (peak temperatures) in the array of <b>heated</b> <b>segments</b> constitutes the primary goal that sets the platform to develop the methods.

Multi-scale design based on constructal theory is applied to estimate the optimal insulated spacing, heaters size and heat generation rates, such that the minimum hot spots temperature is achieved when subject to space constraint and fixed overall heat load. It is demonstrated that the two methods can considerably reduce the hot spot temperatures and consequently, both can be utilized with confidence in industry to achieve optimized heat transfer...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Crystallization is a key unit operation used for obtaining purified products by many process industries. The key properties of the crystalline products, such as size and shape distribution, purity and polymorphic form are controlled by the crystallization process. All these properties impact significantly the downstream operations such as drying or filtration. Therefore, monitoring and controlling this process is fundamental {{to ensure the quality}} of the final product. Process analytical technology (PAT) brings numerous new methods and opportunities in the process analytics and real time process monitoring systems, which can be integrated into the control algorithm and provide high level optimal control strategies as well as deeper understanding of the process. Process monitoring helps develop mathematical models which can, in one hand, help in better understanding the processes and consecvently the development and application of advanced control methods in order to achieve better product quality. In this work, image processing and image analysis based direct nucleation control (IA-DNC) is developed in order to investigate the evolution of the crystal properties, such as crystal size, and crystal shape distribution. The IA-DNC approach is also compared to alternative DNC techniques, in which particle number were measured by Focused Beam Reflectance Measurement (FBRM) in order to control crystal size. A control approach is introduced that control the nucleation and disappearance of crystals during cooling and <b>heating</b> <b>segments</b> related to the changes of the number of counts (measured by Particle Vision Measurment, so called PVM or combination of FBRM and PVM). The approach was applied to investigate crystallization of compounds with different behavior: potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP) water, contaminated KDP -water and Ascorbic acid water systems. The results demonstrate the application of imaging technique for model-free feedback control for tailoring crystal product properties. The second main aim of the thesis is to investigate and control crystallization processes in impure media in the presence of multiple impurities, with an impact on the crystal shape via growth kinetics. The broad impact of the crystal growth modifiers (impurities) on the growth kinetics is observed in real time by using in situ video imaging probe and real-time image analysis. A morphological population balance model is developed, which incorporates a multi-site, competitive adsorption mechanism of the impurities on the crystal faces. The kinetic parameters of primary nucleation, growth and impurity adsorption for a model system of potassium dihydrogen phosphate crystallization in water in the presence of two impurities, were estimated and validated with experimental results. It was demonstrated that the model can be used to describe the dynamic evolution of crystal properties, such as size and aspect ratio during crystallization for different impurity profiles in the system. Manual, feedback and hybrid feedback-feedforward control techniques are developed and investigated numerically for continuous processes, while model-based and model-free control approach for crystal shape are developed for batch processes. The developed morphological population balance model is implemented and applied in the model-based control approaches, which are suitable to describe multicomponent adsorption processes and their influence on the crystal shape. Case studies show the effectiveness of crystal growth modifiers based shape control techniques. Comparison of different control approaches shows the effectiveness of the techniques. The third part of the thesis deals with purification of crystals when adsorption of impurities on crystal surfaces and its incorporation into crystals are considered. A purification method, called competitive purity control (CPC) is proposed and investigated. A morphological population balance model, including nucleation, growth and competitive impurity adsorption kinetics is developed to describe the case when multiple impurities can adsorb competitively on the crystal surface. The model is also combined with liquid phase chemical reaction model, in order to investigate the purity control case when an additive is introduced in the system that reacts with the impurity forming a non-adsorbing reaction product. Both competitive purity control approaches proposed: the adsorption based competitive purity control (A-CPC) and the reaction based competitive purity control (R-CPC); are investigated using detailed numerical simulations then compared with the alternative widely used purification method, called recrystallization. In the last contribution chapter, an integrated process optimization of a continuous chemical reactor and crystallizer is performed and studied numerically. The {{purpose of this study is}} to show the way in which the byproduct produced in the chemical reactor may affect the crystallization process and how its negative effect can be reduced by applying integrated process optimization. Sensitivity analysis of the system was performed by considering the flow rate and the concentration of substances in the input stream of the chemical reactor as manipulated process variables.

40|$|A new {{approach}} to the design and control of shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators is presented. SMA wires are divided into many segments and their thermal states are controlled individually {{as a group of}} finite state machines. Instead of driving a current to the entire SMA wire and controlling the wire length based on the analogue strain-temperature characteristics, the new method controls the binary state (hot or cold) of individual segments and thereby the total displacement is proportional to the length of the <b>heated</b> <b>segments,</b> i. e. austenite phase. Although the thermo-mechanical properties of SMA are highly nonlinear and uncertain with a prominent hysteresis, Segmented Binary Control is robust and stable, providing characteristics similar to a stepping motor. However, the heating and cooling of each segment to its bi-stable states entail longer time and larger energy for transition. An efficient method for improving speed of response and power consumption is developed by exploiting the inherent hysteresis of SMA. Instead of keeping the extreme temperatures continuously, the temperatures return to intermediate "hold" temperatures closer to room temperature but sufficient to keep constant phase. Coordination of the multitude of segments having independent thermal states allows for faster response with little latency time even for thick SMA wires. Based on stress dependent thermo-mechanical characteristics, the hold temperature satisfying a given Stress Margin is obtained. The new control method is implemented using the Peltier effect thermoelectric devices for selective segment-by-segment heating and cooling. Experiments demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed method. by Brian A. Selden. Thesis (S. M.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, 2005.

40|$|The use of starch as a {{thickening}} {{agent in the}} food industry relies on its property to absorb large amounts of water when heated above its gelatinization temperature. To extend the functionality of starch to applications for instant and convenience foods, starches with enhanced cold-water swelling capacity have been developed. Granular cold-water swelling starch (GCWSS) can be produced by an aqueous alcohol treatment at elevated temperature. At balanced treatment temperatures and alcohol concentrations, granular starches with a V-type X-ray diffraction pattern are formed. The latter is characteristic for a single helical crystal structure, oppositely to the double helical nature of crystalline amylopectin in native starch. V-type crystals can be soluble in water at room temperature, conferring upon this starch its cold-water swelling capacity. The linear amylose fraction is primarily responsible for the V-type crystalline structure of GCWSS. This study aimed at unraveling the mechanism of the conversion from native A-, B- and C-type starches in their GCWSS counterparts. Native maize, rice, cassava, potato and pea starches were successfully transformed into GCWSS using an aqueous ethanol treatment, by varying ethanol concentration at 95 °C. Resulting products were characterized on a molecular, crystalline and granular scale, using high performance size-exclusion chromatography, X-ray diffraction and microscopy, respectively. Higher amylose chain lengths led to a decrease in degree of V-type crystallinity. Finally, in situ collected calorimetric measurements combined with in situ obtained time-temperature resolved synchrotron X-ray measurements, revealed the relative kinetics of native (A- or B-type) crystal melting and V-type crystal formation: it appears that V-type crystals are formed during the <b>heating</b> <b>segment</b> of the aqueous ethanol treatment, simultaneously with A-type crystal melting, whilst they only appear upon cooling for B-type starch after al native crystals were gone. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{relatively}} high global warming potential (GWP) value of R 410 A, much effort {{has been devoted to}} the exploration of potential refrigerants to replace R 410 A in the heat pump applications. Those studies involving natural refrigerants, which are of zero or single-digit GWP values, have not yet demonstrated the readiness for the substitution because of various reasons such as low cycle efficiency, toxicity and flammability. Henceforward, some synthetic refrigerants whose GWP values are significantly lower than R 410 A such as R 32 and some R 32 -based blends such as D 2 Y 60, are getting more attention. To evaluate the transient performance of those low-GWP refrigerants, a Modelica-based heat pump model is developed to simulate a heat pump cycle during both steady state operations and transient operations. The model includes an efficiency-based compressor model, two <b>segmented</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger models, a control volume-based valve model and segmented pipe models. The heat exchanger model is capable of simulating multi-bank multi-circuit tube-fin heat exchangers with an arbitrary number of segments. The pipe model is developed based on the <b>segmented</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger model, and its implementation provides for better charge prediction compared to single lump model. In order to speed up the simulations, accelerated refrigerant property routines were developed for R 32 based on REFPROP. System-level steady-state and transient simulations for several alternative low-GWP working fluids, R 32 and D 2 Y 60, are conducted. The simulation results are compared with the published experimental data obtained from the Alternative Refrigerant Evaluation Program (AREP). The data includes steady-state operation data based on ASHRAE A, B and C tests, and transient data from ASHRAE D cyclic operation test. The validation of R 32 and D 2 Y 60 steady-state data shows a maximum deviation of 7. 5 % and an average deviation of 4 %. The transient simulation well captures the dynamic performance of vapor compression cycle during start-up and shut-down...|$|R
40|$|SummaryWe {{report an}} {{unexpected}} role for Tel 2 in {{the expression of}} all mammalian phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase-related protein kinases (PIKKs). Although Tel 2 {{was identified as a}} budding yeast gene required for the telomere length maintenance, we found no obvious telomeric function for mammalian Tel 2. Targeted gene deletion showed that mouse Tel 2 is essential in embryonic development, embryonic stem (ES) cells, and embryonic fibroblasts. Conditional deletion of Tel 2 from embryonic fibroblasts compromised their response to IR and UV, diminishing the activation of checkpoint kinases and their downstream effectors. The effects of Tel 2 deletion correlated with significantly reduced protein levels for the PI 3 K-related kinases ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), ATM and Rad 3 related (ATR), DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit ataxia (DNA-PKcs). Tel 2 deletion also elicited specific depletion of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), suppressor with morphological effect on genitalia 1 (SMG 1), and transformation/transcription domain-associated protein (TRRAP), and curbed mTOR signaling, indicating that Tel 2 affects all six mammalian PIKKs. While Tel 2 deletion did not alter PIKK mRNA levels, in vivo pulse labeling experiments showed that Tel 2 controls the stability of ATM and mTOR. Each of the PIKK family members associated with Tel 2 in vivo and in vitro experiments indicated that Tel 2 binds to part of the <b>HEAT</b> repeat <b>segments</b> of ATM and mTOR. These data identify Tel 2 as a highly conserved regulator of PIKK stability...|$|R
40|$|An NACA 65 (sub 1) - 212 airfoil of 8 -foot chord was {{provided}} with a gas-heated leading edge for investigations of cyclical de-icing. De-icing was accomplished with intermittent <b>heating</b> of airfoil <b>segments</b> that supplied hot gas to chordwise passages in a double-skin construction. Ice removal was facilitated by a spanwise leading-edge parting strip which was continuously heated from the gas-supply duct. Preliminary results demonstrate that satisfactory cyclical ice removal occurs with ratios of cycle time to heat-on period (cycle ratio) from 10 to 26. For minimum runback, efficient ice removal, and minimum total heat input, short heat-on periods of about 15 seconds with heat-off periods of 260 seconds gave the best results. In the range of conditions investigated, the prime variables in {{the determination of the}} required heat input for cyclical ice removal were the air temperature and the cycle ratio; heat-off period, liquid water content, airspeed, and angle of attack had only secondary effects on heat input rate...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{effectiveness}} of grinding fluid supply has a crucial impact on grinding quality and efficiency in high speed grinding. In {{order to improve}} the cooling and lubrication, through in-depth research of self-inhaling internal cooling method and intermittent grinding mechanism, a new spray cooling method used in high speed grinding is proposed. By referring {{to the structure of}} bowl-shaped dispersion disk, the grinding wheel matrix with atomization ability is designed; through studying heat transfer of droplet collision and the influence of micro-groove on the boiling <b>heat</b> transfer, grinding <b>segment</b> with micro-groove is designed to enhance the heat flux of coolant and achieve maximum heat transfer between droplets and grinding contact zone. High-speed grinding experiments on GH 4169 with the developed grinding wheel are carried out. The results show that with the micro-groove grinding wheel just 5. 4 % of pump outlet flow rate and 0. 5 % of spindle energy is needed to reduce the grinding temperature to 200 °C, which means the developed grinding wheel makes cooling high efficient and low energy consuming...|$|R
40|$|During {{operation}} of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, heat will be generated inside the coils of its superconducting magnets {{as a consequence of}} ramping of magnetic field, and of the interaction of lost beam particles with the magnet mass. Heat has to be transferred from the conductor into the He II coolant and removed from the magnet environment. During the LHC R&D stage, this transfer has been extensively studied on simulated coil segments at CEA/Saclay, and by analyzing dynamic behavior of short model magnets at CERN. Owing to the importance of efficient cooling for the design of future superconducting accelerator magnets, study of heat transfer has been restored at CERN and in frame of the Next European Dipole Collaboration. The article features two recently performed works: 1. Attempt to analyze archived high ramp rate quench data of 1 -m-long LHC model dipole magnets of the 2 nd generation. 2. Development of a method for direct measurement of <b>heat</b> transfer on <b>segments</b> of production LHC dipole magnet coils...|$|R
