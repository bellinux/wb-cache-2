5|$|As well as {{causing the}} {{destruction}} of lands, foods and belongings, fire {{could also be used}} to divert manpower. 13th century Mongol armies regularly sent out small detachments from their main forces to start grass <b>fires</b> <b>and</b> fire settlements as diversions.|$|E
5|$|Before Gladstone was {{formally}} founded, several small settlements {{were established in}} its vicinity. However, due to various natural disasters, such as <b>fires</b> <b>and</b> floods, few survived to become incorporated cities of today.|$|E

5|$|Many {{organochlorine}} compounds {{have been}} isolated from natural sources ranging from bacteria to humans. Chlorinated organic compounds {{are found in}} nearly every class of biomolecules including alkaloids, terpenes, amino acids, flavonoids, steroids, and fatty acids. Organochlorides, including dioxins, are produced in the high temperature environment of forest <b>fires,</b> <b>and</b> dioxins {{have been found in}} the preserved ashes of lightning-ignited fires that predate synthetic dioxins. In addition, a variety of simple chlorinated hydrocarbons including dichloromethane, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride have been isolated from marine algae. A majority of the chloromethane in the environment is produced naturally by biological decomposition, forest <b>fires,</b> <b>and</b> volcanoes.|$|E
5|$|Quolls are {{suffering}} badly from urbanisation, housing development, mining development, {{and expansion of}} agricultural lands. Habitats are also being destroyed by large herbivores trampling the grass and overgrowth, making camouflage difficult. Forest <b>fires</b> <b>and</b> weeds also contribute to habitat destruction.|$|E
5|$|Flash floods {{resulting}} from glacial lake outburst flooding {{in the upper}} reaches of the valley, are a common occurrence in the Mo Chu and Pho Chu rivers, and in the past caused flooding and damage to the dzong, especially in 1957, 1960 and 1994. <b>Fires</b> <b>and</b> earthquakes have also further added to the problem. In 1996, flash floods in the Pho Chu river damaged the large stupa and caused several deaths.|$|E
50|$|If enemy {{contact is}} made, the overwatch team opens <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> the unit takes up {{a process called}} <b>Fire</b> <b>and</b> Maneuver which {{is very similar to}} {{bounding}} overwatch in that teams alternate <b>firing</b> <b>and</b> maneuvering. During <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> maneuver, the commander takes more direct control of team movements and positions.|$|R

5|$|However, {{safety issues}} {{continue}} to be a persistent problem in Indonesian aviation. Several accidents have given Indonesia's air transport system the reputation of the least safe in the world. Indonesian aviation faces numerous challenges, including poorly maintained, outdated, and often overwhelmed infrastructure, the factor of human error, bad weather, haze problems caused by plantation <b>fires,</b> <b>and</b> volcanic ash spewed by numerous area volcanoes that disrupts air transportation.|$|E
5|$|If magma were to rise {{towards the}} surface of Nazko, new {{earthquake}} swarms would occur, with {{a significant increase in}} the size and number of earthquakes. An eruption in the Nazko area would probably create a small cinder cone, similar to what formed Nazko Cone 7,200years ago. Immediate hazards related to cinder cone eruptions in the Nazko area would probably be forest <b>fires</b> <b>and,</b> if an eruption column were produced, redirection of nearby air traffic.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, an {{explosion}} {{on a ship}} at the Port of Texas City caused <b>fires</b> <b>and</b> destruction throughout the city's industrial complex and other ships creating one of nation's worst industrial accidents. The tragedy caused more than five hundred deaths, more than four thousand injuries, and more than $50 million in damage ($ million in today's dollars). Though the city's growth and prosperity were interrupted, {{the city and the}} business leaders were able to rebuild.|$|E

5|$|Several <b>fires</b> <b>and</b> {{industrial}} incidents {{occurred in}} the 1980s. In 1981, an oil slick affected the coastline of Skagen municipality, and in 1985 a pipe bomb exploded at Ankermedet School. Skagen ice factory was affected by a chemical incident in 1989. A new shrimp factory opened in the industrial area in 1991, while the local cinema was closed in 1993. There was a major fire on the Hulsig Heath dunes in 1996.|$|E
5|$|Sumatran {{orangutan}} populations {{declined by}} 80% in 75 years.

5|$|The {{building}} was damaged by several <b>fires</b> <b>and</b> earthquakes during the 19th and 20th centuries including the 1918 San Fermín earthquake, which caused extensive damage, including {{the destruction of}} both of the original towers.

5|$|The {{chemical}} apparatus {{was only}} suitable for small <b>fires,</b> <b>and</b> was supplemented in 1902 with a steam-operated pumper and a hose wagon, both horse-drawn. The {{two pieces of}} equipment were purchased by Walter Law's Briarcliff Realty Company and were loaned to the fire company without charge. At the time, the fire company housed its equipment and horses at the Briarcliff Farms' Barn A (present-day St. Theresa's School) and used the Wheelwright shop as a meeting room and for social events.|$|E
5|$|The {{mountain}} is now circled by the Loowit Trail at elevations of 4000–4900 feet.

5|$|The {{pipeline}} {{was built}} to withstand earthquakes, forest <b>fires,</b> <b>and</b> other natural disasters. The 2002 Denali earthquake damaged some of the pipeline sliders designed to absorb similar quakes, and it caused the pipeline to shut down for more than 66 hours as a precaution. In 2004, wildfires overran portions of the pipeline, {{but it was not}} damaged and did not shut down.|$|E

50|$|In England <b>and</b> Wales a <b>fire</b> {{authority}} or <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> rescue authority is a statutory body {{made up of}} a committee of local councillors which oversees the policy and service delivery of a <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> rescue service.

5|$|After the attack, several sailors {{received}} medals {{for their}} conduct and actions under fire. Lieutenant Commander Samuel G. Fuqua, the ship's damage control officer, earned the Medal of Honor for his cool-headedness while quelling <b>fires</b> <b>and</b> getting survivors off the wrecked battleship. Posthumous awards of the Medal of Honor {{also went to}} two high-ranking officers who were on board the battleship when it was destroyed, Rear Admiral Isaac C. Kidd, the first flag officer killed in the Pacific war, and Captain Franklin Van Valkenburgh, who reached the bridge and was attempting to defend his ship when the bomb that hit the onboard ammunition magazines destroyed it. Arizona was awarded one battle star for her service in World War II.|$|E
5|$|All 320 {{of the men}} on duty at {{the pier}} died instantly, and 390 civilians and {{military}} personnel were injured, many seriously. Among the dead were all five Coast Guard personnel posted aboard the fire barge. African Americans suffered 202 dead and 233 injured, which accounted for 15% of all African-American naval casualties during World War II. Naval personnel worked quickly to contain the <b>fires</b> <b>and</b> to prevent other explosions. Injuries were treated, those seriously injured were hospitalized, and uninjured servicemen were evacuated to nearby stations.|$|E
5|$|Backcountry hiking is {{available}} in the Craters of the Moon Wilderness and the much larger Backcountry Area beyond (added in 2000). Only two trails enter the wilderness area and even those stop after a few miles or kilometers. From there most hikers follow the Great Rift and explore its series of seldom-visited volcanic features. All overnight backcountry hikes require registration with a ranger. No drinking water {{is available}} in the backcountry and the dry climate quickly dehydrates hikers. Avoiding summer heat and winter cold are therefore recommended by rangers. Pets, camp <b>fires,</b> <b>and</b> all mechanized vehicles, including bicycles, are not allowed in the wilderness area.|$|E
