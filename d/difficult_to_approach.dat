5|$|While {{any large}} shark {{is capable of}} inflicting injury and thus merits respect, the common {{thresher}} poses little danger to humans. Most divers report that they are shy and <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> underwater. The International Shark Attack File lists a single provoked attack by the thresher shark and four attacks on boats, which were probably incidental from individuals fighting capture. There is an unsubstantiated report of a common thresher acting aggressively towards a spearfisherman off New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Shy and <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>approach,</b> {{the nervous}} shark is {{harmless}} to humans. It is occasionally marketed for food. This species {{is susceptible to}} being caught incidentally in coastal gillnets, such as the barramundi (Lates calcarifer) gillnet fishery operating off northern Australia. It may also be caught on line gear and in prawn trawls. The Australian nervous shark population {{does not appear to}} be threatened by fishing activities, and there the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern. No data on the impact of fishing are available elsewhere in its range, and thus the IUCN has listed it overall under Data Deficient.|$|E
5|$|Timid and skittish, the {{blacktip reef shark}} is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> {{and seldom}} poses a danger to humans unless roused by food. However, people wading through shallow water {{are at risk of}} having their legs mistakenly bitten. This shark is used for its meat, fins, and liver oil, but is not {{considered}} to be a commercially significant species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the blacktip reef shark as Near Threatened. Although the species as a whole remains widespread and relatively common, overfishing of this slow-reproducing shark has led to its decline at a number of locales.|$|E

50|$|The {{handling}} of non-monetary impacts also present problems. They are usually incorporated by estimating them in monetary terms, using {{measures such as}} WTP (willingness to pay), though these are often <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> assess.

25|$|Patrick White and Christina Stead {{continue}} to be widely recognised as the foremost Australian novelists of the 20th century. His writing tackles existential questions as well as myriad human flaws, weaknesses and hypocrisies, and {{it is full of}} fresh and original metaphor. Admittedly, White's style is also often very condensed and perhaps at first somewhat <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> – such noted writers as Robert Hughes and David Malouf have expressed their difficulties with some of White's writing. Nevertheless, Patrick White's greatness as a novelist remains undoubted.|$|E
500|$|Among {{the most}} common South African catsharks, the pyjama shark is {{harmless}} to humans and <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> underwater. Because of its small size, attractive appearance, and hardiness, it is popularly exhibited by public aquariums. The aquarium trade supports a small fishery targeting this species and the similar leopard catshark. Large numbers of pyjama sharks are caught incidentally by commercial fisheries using longlines, gillnets, beach-seines, and bottom trawls; they are also readily hooked by recreational anglers, especially during the summer when they aggregate. Although edible, most are discarded while some are used for lobster bait. The toll taken by fishery bycatch is likely greatly underestimated, as many fishers who use line gear regard pajama sharks as pests that [...] "steal" [...] bait, and kill them before discarding them.|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> the {{estimation}} of the Bayes error rate exist.

500|$|With a {{loan from}} Librescu, Goldfaden headed east {{with a group}} of 42 people, {{including}} performers, musicians, and their families. After the end of the Russo-Turkish War he and his troupe travelled extensively through Imperial Russia, notably to Kharkov (also in Ukraine), Moscow, and Saint Petersburg. Jacob Adler later described him at this time as [...] "a bon vivant," [...] "a cavalier," [...] "as <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> as an emperor." [...] He continued to turn out plays at a prolific pace, now mostly serious pieces such as Doctor Almasada, oder Die Yiden in Palermo (Doctor Almasada, or The Jews of Palermo), Shulamith, and Bar Kokhba, the last being a rather dark operetta about Bar Kokhba's revolt, written after the pogroms in Russia following the 1881 assassination of Czar Alexander II.|$|E
500|$|Chinese {{was taught}} to Murasaki's brother as {{preparation}} {{for a career in}} government, and during her childhood, living in her father's household, she learned and became proficient in classical Chinese. In her diary she wrote, [...] "When my brother... was a young boy learning the Chinese classics, I was in the habit of listening to him and I became unusually proficient at understanding those passages that he found too difficult to understand and memorize. Father, a most learned man, was always regretting the fact: 'Just my luck,' he would say, 'What a pity she was not born a man! With her brother she studied Chinese literature, and she probably also received instruction in more traditional subjects such as music, calligraphy and Japanese poetry. Murasaki's education was unorthodox. Louis Perez explains in The History of Japan that [...] "Women... were thought to be incapable of real intelligence and therefore were not educated in Chinese." [...] Murasaki was aware that others saw her as [...] "pretentious, awkward, <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>approach,</b> prickly, too fond of her tales, haughty, prone to versifying, disdainful, cantankerous and scornful". Asian literature scholar Thomas Inge believes she had [...] "a forceful personality that seldom won her friends".|$|E
2500|$|Those {{who lived}} within the [...] border-zone needed special {{permission}} {{to enter the}} area within [...] of the border. The area was very <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> and heavily fortified. In the 1950s and 1960s, a double barbed-wire fence was installed [...] from the border. The space between the two fences were laden with land mines. The minefield was later replaced with an electric signal fence (about [...] from the border) and a barbed wire fence, along with guard towers and a sand strip to track border violations.|$|E

50|$|High-dimensional data, meaning {{data that}} {{requires}} {{more than two or}} three dimensions to represent, can be <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> interpret. One <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> simplification is to assume that the data of interest lie on an embedded non-linear manifold within the higher-dimensional space. If the manifold is of low enough dimension, the data can be visualised in the low-dimensional space.|$|R
50|$|Another {{dangerous}} {{scenario is}} the partial failure of an attempted implosion. When a building fails to collapse completely the structure may be unstable, tilting at a dangerous angle, {{and filled with}} un-detonated but still primed explosives, making it <b>difficult</b> for workers <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> safely.|$|R
2500|$|Westerly winds blow {{throughout}} the year interspersed with periods of calm—indeed, in 1963, 25% of winds were in the calm category at King Edward point, and the mean wind speed of around [...] is around half that of the Falkland Islands. This gives {{the eastern side of}} South Georgia (leeward side) a more pleasant climate than the exposed western side. The prevailing weather conditions generally make the islands <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> by ship, though the north coast of South Georgia has several large bays which provide good anchorage.|$|E

Cornwall returned to Durban for repairs until 10 June; the tactics of the captain of Cornwall in shadowing, attempted to identify and closing with Pinguin was criticised by the Admiralty. The crew of Pinguin had been skilful in disguising the ship and it was <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> a suspicious, yet unidentified ship. A raider had the tactical advantage in deciding when to open fire, before it was unmasked and investigating ships courted danger, if the vessel approached from a direction favourable to a raider's guns and torpedoes. Allied ships were given secret call-signs and a system was devised for the investigating ship {{to refer to the}} Admiralty by wireless to verify ship identities. The new methods made ship identification much easier but took months to implement and similar events occurred, when ships were either allowed to sail on and turned out to be raiders or were [...] intercepted and sprang a surprise on the British warship.|$|E

40|$|The {{author of}} this paper reconsiders the realist and symbolist {{strategies}} in Dubliners, proposing that Joyce subverted them both, {{to the point of}} making them problematic. Joyce 2 ̆ 7 s subversiveness in this book is particularly <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> catch because it does not "show". In this respect, Dubliners could paradoxically be considered Joyce 2 ̆ 7 s most <b>difficult</b> text <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> critically.

40|$|The interpeduncular cistern is a <b>difficult</b> region <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> through {{conventional}} methods due to {{its deep}} location and important adjacent neurovascular structures. Therefore, it is usually <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> expose the region sufficiently. Technical problems associated with various surgical <b>approaches</b> have led <b>to</b> emergence of combined approaches and their modifications (i. e., {{the removal of the}} zygomatic arch). In addition, a frontotemporal craniotomy is reported to provide a wide exposure of the anterior temporal base, thus allowing oblique access to the interpeduncular cistern with minimal brain retraction.
