Consequently, that which is neither good nor bad is what in itself is neither to be striven after nor to be avoided, but derives value or the opposite according as it serves as means for what is good or bad, or rather, is used by us for that purpose.|$|E

[...] Stead explained her view of time travel in her novel, where going back in time is fulfilling the future, rather than changing it.

500|$|Songs in Peking opera are proscribed {{by a set}} {{of common}} {{aesthetic}} values. A majority of songs are within a pitch range of an octave and a fifth. High pitch is a positive aesthetic value, so a performer will pitch songs {{at the very top of}} his or her vocal range. [...] For this reason, the idea of a song's key <b>has</b> <b>value</b> in Peking opera only as a technical tool for the performer. Different performers in the same performance may sing in different keys, requiring the accompanying musicians to constantly retune their instruments or switch out with other players. Elizabeth Wichmann describes the ideal basic timbre for Peking opera songs as a [...] "controlled nasal tone". Performers make extensive use of vocal vibrato during songs, in a way that is [...] "slower" [...] and [...] "wider" [...] than vibrato used in Western performances. The Peking opera aesthetic for songs is summed up by the expression zi zheng qiang yuan, meaning that the written characters should be delivered accurately and precisely, and the melodic passages should be weaving, or [...] "round".|$|E
