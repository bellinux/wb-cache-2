30|$|Polyethylene {{terephthalate}} {{commonly known}} as PET and is formed from terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG). It is a long-chain polymer (C 10 H 8 O 4)n belongs to the polyesters family. It shows both amorphous (transparent) and semi-crystalline nature (Ozalp 2011). PET is intensively used by the packaging industries for bottles and containers of food and other consumer products. Later, PET has started to use in injection molded and extruded articles, primarily for reinforcement with glass fibre (Sinha et al. 2010) which do not degrade in the outdoor environment. Thus, increasing interest has recently {{been focused on the}} recycling of plastic wastes, especially PET for these various purposes which could prevent the environmental pollution. Saw dust, a waste from wood processing industries, also creates environmental hazard unless reprocessed for different applications like particleboard, pulp. The recycled PET and saw dust can be used to produce wood plastics by flat-press method which might a good value added products from waste and would help to minimize the waste. <b>Flat</b> <b>press</b> method is newly introduced method in the WPC sector and is similar to the industrial particleboard manufacturing process. Though extrusion and injection molding are the predominant technologies to produce WPCs, but <b>flat</b> <b>press</b> process is technically more advantageous (Jarusombuti and Ayrilmis 2011). This technology possesses some advantages like higher productivity with relatively lower pressure requirement and as a consequence naturally given wood structure lefts undestroyed. Thus, the density of WPCs reduces considerably (Ayrilmis and Jarusombuti 2011; Jarusombuti and Ayrilmis 2011) and increase the moisture resistance properties compared to the conventional wood based composites (Jarusombuti and Ayrilmis 2011). However, there is very limited/no work so far on the fabrication and properties of flat-pressed WPCs from sawdust and recycled PET at various mixing ratios. Thus, {{the purpose of this study}} was to investigate the feasibility of wood plastic composites fabrication from sawdust and PET. Determining the physical and mechanical properties of WPCs as a function of mixing ratio was also an objective of this study.|$|E
30|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{fabrication}} of composite matrix from saw dust (SD) and recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) at different ratio (w/w) by flat-pressed method. The wood plastic composites (WPCs) were made with a thickness of 6  mm after mixing the saw dust and PET in a rotary type blender followed by <b>flat</b> <b>press</b> process. Physical i.e., density, moisture content (MC), water absorption (WA) and thickness swelling (TS), and mechanical properties i.e., Modulus of Elasticity (MOE) and Modulus of Rupture (MOR) were assessed {{as a function of}} mixing ratios according to the ASTM D- 1037 standard. WA and TS were measured after 24  hours of immersion in water at 25, 50 and 75 °C temperature. It was found that density decreased 18.3 % when SD content increased from 40 % to 70 % into the matix. WA and TS increased when the PET content decreased in the matrix and the testing water temperature increased. MOE and MOR were reached to maximum for the fabricated composites (2008.34 and 27.08  N/mm 2, respectively) when the SD content were only 40 %. The results indicated that the fabrication of WPCs from sawdust and PET would technically feasible; however, the use of additives like coupling agents could further enhance the properties of WPCs.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. In sport {{technique}} studies, motion features can {{be useful}} as they have a certain defined measure [1]. In this work, we examined the following three features: {{the structure of the}} movement (all the characteristics of the movement), the fluency of the movement, and the rhythm of the movement.

The second one was a 25 -year-old bodybuilder (body mass = 77 kg; body height = 175 cm; 1 -RM in <b>flat</b> bench <b>press</b> = 100 kg). The subjects performed consecutive sets of a single repetition of flat bench pressing with an increasing load (70, 80, 90, and 100 % 1 -RM, with the anticipated maximum weight), until the completion of one repetition maximum. Multidimensional movement analysis was made with the measuring system Smart-E (BTS, Italy), which consisted of six infrared cameras (120 Hz) and a wireless module to measure muscle bioelectric activity (Pocket EMG).

40|$|The {{disabled}} population varies {{significantly in}} regard to physical fitness, what is conditioned by {{the damage to the}} locomotor system. Recently there has been an increased emphasis on the role of competitive sport in enhancing health and {{the quality of life of}} individuals with disability. One of the sport disciplines of Paralympics is the <b>flat</b> bench <b>press.</b> The bench press is one of the most popular resistance exercises used for the upper body in healthy individuals. It is used not only by powerlifters, but also by athletes in most strength-speed oriented sport disciplines. The objective of the study was to compare neuromuscular control for various external loads (from 60 to 100 % 1 RM) during the <b>flat</b> bench <b>press</b> performed by an elite able-bodied athlete and an athlete with lower limb disability. The research project is a case study of two elite bench press athletes with similar sport results: an able-bodied athlete (M. W., age 34 years, body mass 103 kg, body height 1. 72 m, 1 RM in the <b>flat</b> bench <b>press</b> 200 kg) and a disabled athlete (M. T., age 31 years, body mass 92 kg, body height 1. 70 m, 1 RM in the <b>flat</b> bench <b>press</b> 190 kg). The activity was recorded for four muscles: pectoralis major (PM), anterior deltoid (AD), as well as for the lateral and long heads of the triceps brachii (TBlat and TBlong). The T-test revealed statistically significant differences between peak activity of all the considered muscles (AD with p = 0. 001; PM with p = 0. 001; TBlat with p = 0. 0021 and TBlong with p = 0. 002) between the 2 athletes. The analysis of peak activity differences of M. W and M. T. in relation to the load revealed statistically significant differences for load changes between: 60 to 100 % 1 RM (p = 0. 007), 70 to 100 % 1 RM (p = 0. 016) and 80 to 100 % 1 RM (p = 0. 032). The <b>flat</b> bench <b>press</b> performed without legs resting firmly on the ground leads to the increased engagement of upper body muscles and to their greater activation.
