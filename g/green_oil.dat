25|$|Almost 60 years later, in 1937, the iconostasis was renovated again {{although}} but the re-painting {{work was}} considered to be of really low artistic quality.

40|$|AbstractThe oil {{extracted}} by {{cold pressing}} unroasted coffee beans, known as <b>green</b> coffee <b>oil,</b> {{has been widely}} used for cosmetic purposes. The objective of this work was to prepare and characterize microcapsules containing <b>green</b> coffee <b>oil</b> and to verify its antioxidant activity under the effect of light, heat and oxygen. The encapsulating material was arabic gum and the microcapsules were obtained by spray drying an oil-in-water emulsion containing <b>green</b> coffee <b>oil.</b> The characterization of the microcapsules was performed by laser diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and the antioxidant activity. The antioxidant activity was determined by a modified active oxygen method with light irradiation, heating and oxygen flux. The microparticles were effectively produced by the proposed spray drying method, which resulted in <b>green</b> coffee <b>oil</b> loads of 10 and 30 %. The morphological evaluation of microcapsules showed spherical shape with smooth and non-porous surfaces, demonstrating the adequacy of arabic gum as encapsulating material. Calorimetric analysis of individual components and microcapsules with 10 and 30 % <b>green</b> coffee <b>oil</b> showed diminished degradation temperatures and enthalpy, suggesting a possible interaction between arabic gum and <b>green</b> coffee <b>oil.</b> The antioxidant activities for pure <b>green</b> coffee <b>oil</b> and its microcapsules with loads of 10 and 30 % showed high activity {{when compared to the}} reference antioxidant alfa-tocopherol. Microcapsules containing 10 and 30 % of oil showed 7 -fold and 3 -fold increase in antioxidant activity when compared to pure <b>green</b> coffee <b>oil.</b> The new method for antioxidant activity determination proposed here, which applies heat, light and oxygen simultaneously, suggests a high improvement in encapsulated <b>green</b> coffee <b>oil</b> when compared to this active alone. The results showed herein indicate a promising industrial application of this microencapsulated <b>green</b> coffee <b>oil...</b>|$|R

60|$|No road, however, goes on interminably, and {{the white}} aldea of Arucas rose before them when the sun was low.

Harper sniffed hungrily—for the pungent odors of the dark <b>green</b> <b>oil</b> and garlic hung about the flat‐topped houses—and finally halted before an archway leading into a shadowy patio. There was a legend above it.|$|E

[...] Wildlife which drank the water died rapidly and terribly. Most reported incidents of poisoning by microalgal toxins have occurred in freshwater environments, and they are becoming more common and widespread.

50|$|The {{sole member}} of the TRPA sub-family, TRPA1, {{contains}} 14 N-terminal ankyrin repeats and is believed {{to function as a}} mechanical stress sensor. It is expressed in the dorsal root ganglion, trigeminal ganglion, and hair cells. The temperature sensitivity of TRPA1 is highly disputed, with some reports claiming that it is activated by noxiously cold stimuli and others disputing such a claim. TRPA1 is known to be activated by compounds capable of forming covalent chemical bonds with the protein's cysteins like isothiocyanates, which are the pungent chemicals in substances such as mustard oil and wasabi and Michael acceptors such as cinnamaldehyde in cinnamon, amongst numerous other substances. Non-covalent activators of TRPA1 also exists, such as methyl salicylate in winter <b>green</b> <b>oil</b> and the synthetic compound PF-4840154.|$|E
