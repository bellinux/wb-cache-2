The team {{got off to a}} 12–1 start that won Stevens the Hugh Durham mid-season {{coaching}} award. On February 5, Stevens notched his 50th win as Butler beat Detroit 66–61. In so doing, Stevens became the sixth head coach in NCAA history to reach 50 wins in 56 games or fewer. Butler finished first in the Horizon League with a 15–3 in conference record, defying preseason expectations. Butler lost the Horizon League tournament final 57–54 to Cleveland State, but made the NCAA tournament as an at-large selection. The team received the nine seed in the South Regional, and lost to eighth-seeded Louisiana State in the first round by a score of 75–71 to finish the year at 26–6 overall.|$|E

Their defensive line was anchored by Pro Bowl defensive tackle Corey Simon (5.5 sacks) and defensive ends Jevon Kearse (7.5 sacks, Pro Bowl) and Derrick Burgess. Pro Bowl middle linebacker Jeremiah Trotter, who only started 9 games, recorded 69 tackles and 1 sack.|$|E
25|$|In 1972–73, Knight's {{second year}} as coach, Indiana won the Big Ten {{championship}} {{and reached the}} Final Four, but lost to UCLA. The following season, 1973–74, Indiana once again captured a Big Ten title. In the two following seasons, 1974–75 and 1975–76, the Hoosiers were undefeated {{in the regular season}} and won 37-consecutive Big Ten games, including two more Big Ten championships. The 1974–75 Hoosiers swept the entire Big Ten by an average of 22.8 points per game. However, in an 83–82 win against Purdue they lost consensus All-American forward Scott May to a broken left arm. With May's injury keeping him to 7 minutes of play, the No. 1 Hoosiers lost to Kentucky 92–90 in the Mideast Regional. The Hoosiers were so dominant that <b>four</b> <b>starters</b> – Scott May, Steve Green, Kent Benson and Quinn Buckner – would make the five-man All-Big Ten team. The following season, 1975–76, the Hoosiers went the entire season and 1976 NCAA tournament without a single loss, beating Michigan 86–68 in the title game. Indiana remains the last school to accomplish this feat.|$|E
25|$|Seattle had the NFL's top defense, {{with the}} fewest yards allowed per game (273.6), fewest points allowed (231), and most takeaways (39). They {{were the first}} team since the 1985 Chicago Bears to lead the league in all three categories. The Seahawks were also the fourth team to lead the NFL in interceptions and fewest passing yards allowed; all four teams reached the Super Bowl. Seattle's {{defensive}} line featured defensive ends Cliff Avril and Michael Bennett, both of whom recorded eight sacks. Avril also forced five fumbles, while Bennett recovered three, returning them for 39 yards and a touchdown. Defensive tackle Clinton McDonald also made a big impact with 5.5 sacks, two fumble recoveries, and an interception. Linebacker Bobby Wagner led the team in combined tackles (120), while also racking up five sacks and two interceptions. But the best aspect of the defense was their secondary – collectively known as the Legion of Boom – which sent three of their <b>four</b> <b>starters</b> to the Pro Bowl: cornerback Richard Sherman, who led the NFL in interceptions (eight, with 125 return yards), along with free safety Earl Thomas (five interceptions, 105 tackles, two forced fumbles) and strong safety Kam Chancellor (99 tackles, three interceptions, 78 return yards).|$|E
40|$|The {{viability}} of yoghurt and probiotic bacteria was assessed during manufacture and 35 days storage of yoghurt supplemented with four levels of ascorbic acid using <b>four</b> commercial <b>starter</b> cultures. There were no marked differences in titratable acidity and pH of the yoghurt, whereas oxygen content and redox potential varied in yoghurts with {{various levels of}} ascorbic acid. Hydrogen peroxide content was initially higher in the products prepared with starter cultures that contained Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. During storage of yoghurt, increase in oxygen content and redox potential and percentage retention of ascorbic acid were identical for all <b>four</b> <b>starter</b> cultures, but different at various levels of ascorbic acid. The oxygen content and redox potential gradually increased during storage in plastic cups and remained lower {{with higher levels of}} ascorbic acid. Loss of ascorbic acid occurred during manufacture and storage, with an average retention of only 15 - 20 % after about 35 days storage of yoghurt at 4 °C. The viable counts of Streptococcus thermophilus were lower, whereas those of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus were higher, with increasing concentration of ascorbic acid. The counts of Lactobacillus acidophilus during storage decreased less rapidly with increasing concentration of ascorbic acid for all <b>four</b> <b>starter</b> cultures, whereas the counts of bifidobacteria remained unchanged. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

25|$|The Dodgers {{began the}} month of September by hosting the Washington Nationals for a three-game series in a matchup of the teams with the top two records in the National League. In the first game, the Nationals hit four home runs off of Roberto Hernández, {{including}} two by Denard Span and they beat the Dodgers 6–4. Clayton Kershaw struck out eight batters the next night in eight innings, while allowing only a solo home run by Bryce Harper as the Dodgers won 4–1. In the process, Kershaw moved past the 200 strikeout mark for the fifth straight season, joining Sandy Koufax as the only Dodger pitchers to accomplish that, and just the fourth pitcher since 1893 {{to have at least}} five 200-strikeout seasons through an age-26 season (Bert Blyleven, Walter Johnson and Sam McDowell are the others). Kenley Jansen allowed three runs in the ninth to blow his save opportunity and the Nationals came back to defeat the Dodgers 8–5 in a 14 inning marathon. This was the Dodgers longest game of the year. After a much needed day off, they returned to action on September 5 with a 2–1 victory over the Diamondbacks. Dan Haren allowed one run on four hits in six innings and Matt Kemp homered in the win. Three hits and a key RBI single by Dee Gordon and a 2 RBI double by Hanley Ramírez helped the Dodgers win the next game, 5–2. Adrian Gonzalez homered twice and drove in six runs as the Dodgers completed the sweep of the Diamondbacks with a 7–2 win on September 7. Kershaw picked up his 18th win when he allowed only one earned run in eight innings as the Dodgers beat the San Diego Padres 9–4. The Dodgers four-game winning streak was snapped as Hanley Ramírez committed a couple of errors in the second inning and Roberto Hernández only lasted three innings as they lost the game 6–3. The Dodgers finished off the home stand with a 4–0 shutout of the Padres. Carl Crawford had four hits in four at-bats in the game with three doubles. That tied the Dodgers record for most doubles in a game, a mark last accomplished by Matt Kemp in 2011. Dan Haren pitched seven scoreless innings to pick up his 13th win and {{this was the first time}} the Dodgers had <b>four</b> <b>starters</b> with 13 or more wins since 1985 when Orel Hershiser, Fernando Valenzuela, Jerry Reuss and Bob Welch reached that mark.|$|E
25|$|Unlike his entrance, Weltlich's {{departure}} did {{not result}} in an exodus of players from the program. Penders' first team returned <b>four</b> <b>starters</b> from the previous season, and two talented transfers—Lance Blanks and Joey Wright—gained eligibility, giving Texas a starting five with three future NBA Draft picks and a fourth starter who would play in the NBA. Penders led his first team to a 25–9 overall record, marking the first 20-win season in ten years at Texas and the then-second-highest win total in school history. He quickly validated his promise to bring high-scoring offense to Texas: in the first nine games of the 1988–89 season, the Longhorns scored more than 100 points five times. In Bob Weltlich's 175 games as head coach, Texas had never scored 100 or more points in a game—and had only scored 90 or more points on four occasions (twice requiring an overtime period to reach that mark). The Longhorns opened the season with an 8–1 record before traveling to Oklahoma City to compete in the four-team All-College Tournament. Texas players openly marveled at the wholesale change in coaching philosophy from prior seasons to one that now encouraged them to shoot in large volumes, and some expressed eagerness to see how they would fare against elite competition with their new style of play. Texas defeated the OSU Cowboys 85–84 in the first contest behind 32 points from sophomore guard Joey Wright and two late free throws from junior guard Lance Blanks, who had transferred from Virginia. The win matched Texas in the tournament final against a high-scoring, sixth-ranked Oklahoma Sooners team only nine months removed from a four-point loss as a prohibitive favorite in the 1988 national championship game. Billy Tubbs' Sooners revealed the distance that remained between Texas and college basketball's elite teams, building a 63–37 halftime lead en route to an easy 124–95 win. Texas won six games in conference play by five or fewer points to finish in second place in the SWC with a 12–4 record, with two losses to Arkansas and one loss apiece to Houston and Texas A Interspersed among the conference contests were games against NCAA Tournament-bound Vanderbilt, which Texas lost by a score of 94–79, and Miami (FL), which the Longhorns won easily, 123–104. Texas defeated both SMU and TCU in overtime in the SWC Tournament to advance to the final, in which Arkansas defeated the Longhorns {{for the third time in}} 10 weeks. Texas was subsequently selected as a No. 11 seed to play in the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 10 seasons, where the Longhorns would defeat the sixth-seeded Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, 76–70, for the program's first NCAA Tournament victory since 1972. Texas fell in the second round to the sixth-ranked and third-seeded Missouri Tigers, 108–89, to end the season at 25–9, a nine-win improvement over Weltlich's final season. The Longhorns' on-court success—in combination with Penders' appealing, fast-tempo brand of basketball and his tireless promotion of the Texas program—produced a rise in average home attendance from the prior season of almost 149 percent (from 4,028 to 10,011), the largest such increase in NCAA Division I basketball for the 1988–89 season.|$|E

500|$|The Phillies {{announced}} their opening-day roster on March 29, near the deadline.

As such, Andy Katz of ESPN named them the fifth {{best team in the}} nation in the preseason. Rolle's averages improved slightly to 4.0 points, 4.1 rebounds, and 16.7 minutes per contest, with nine starts and 31 blocks. He had a season-best nine rebounds against Tulane on December 22, and recorded his first double-digit scoring night against the Tennessee Volunteers on March 8, 2007, in the SEC Tournament, when he shot 5-for-7 from the field in 18 minutes for 10 points. However, two herniated discs in his back impeded further progress. The Tigers finished the year 17–15 and 5–11 in SEC play.|$|E
