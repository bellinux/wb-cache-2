These wires were for private service only, as yet, {{and must be}} kept private until a riper day should come. We had a gang of men on the road, working mainly by night. They were stringing ground wires; we were afraid to put up poles, for they would attract too much inquiry. Ground wires were good enough, in both instances, for my wires were protected by an insulation of my own invention which was perfect. My men had orders to strike across country, avoiding roads, and <b>establishing</b> <b>connection</b> with any considerable towns whose lights betrayed their presence, and leaving experts in charge. Nobody could {{tell you how to}} find any place in the kingdom, for nobody ever went intentionally to any place, but only struck it by accident in his wanderings, and then generally left it without thinking to inquire what its name was. At one time and another we had sent out topographical expeditions to survey and map the kingdom, but the priests had always interfered and raised trouble. So we had given the thing up, for the present; it would be poor wisdom to antagonize the Church.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{proprietary}} layers {{was called}} Adaptive Routing. The Adaptive Routing system implemented two powerful features. One {{is that the}} network operated entirely in a self-discovery mode. When a new switch {{was added to the}} network by connecting it to a neighbor via a leased telephone circuit, the new switch was discovered and absorbed into the network without explicit configuration. To change the network configuration, all that was needed was to add or remove connections, and the network would automatically reconfigure. The second feature implemented by Adaptive Routing was often talked about in network engineering circles, but was implemented only by CNS - <b>establishing</b> <b>connection</b> paths on the basis of real-time performance measurements. As one circuit became busy, traffic was diverted to alternative paths to prevent overloading and poor performance for users.|$|E

The congestion of a routing, however, does not reflect its wavelength requirements. Indeed, we observe that for certain instances such an approach can result in considerable waste of network resources. To overcome this, we propose a new routing objective, namely to minimize the maximum clique of the routing, i. e., {{the maximum number of}} connections that pairwise share a common fiber.

The significance and the convergence properties of 'forward' and 'backward' trajectories are studied.
