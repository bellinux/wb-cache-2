40|$|Despite undoubted {{advantages}} of a 5 -cylinder in-line engine, its basic drawback {{is the lack of}} partial balancing the torque variability generated by gas forces by means of the torque caused by inertia forces. Such a desired phenomenon occurs in 4 -cylinder engines. Accordingly, these engines- within a wide range of rotational speed â€“ demonstrate greater <b>engine</b> <b>smoothness</b> than potentially better 5 -cylinder engines. In the article, a concept of generating the moment of inertia forces by means of the proper rollers reducing the amplitude of the moment caused by gas forces is presented. Such a solution will allow for a significant mitigation of vibrations of 5 -cylinder engines, and they are in many respects better than 4 -cylinder ones, which has been justified more extensively in this article. The paper concerns the opportunity of constructing a 5 -cylinder engine of the external torque stability equivalent to the torque stability of a 4 -cylinder engine. It will allow obtaining a much better unit from the commonly used present 4 -cylinder engines for the drive of passenger cars. An engine of the same swept capacity in the 5 -cylinder rather than 4 -cylinder version will be characterized by numerous advantages, and first and foremost: the space between the front wheels of the vehicle will be optimally used. 4 -cylinder engine generates vary large summary forces of the 2 nd order, which is manifested by intensive vibrations in the plane axis of the cylinders...|$|E
40|$|Emissions from {{gasoline}} engines {{remain an}} important issue worldwide as they are both harmful to health and contribute to green house effects especially under cold start conditions. A major challenge of the automotive industry is to reduce harmful emissions {{as much as possible}} whilst continuing to reduce CO 2 emissions. Three-way-catalytic converters have been used very successfully to convert the harmful gases before release to the environment but these devices have to reach their light-off temperature in order to activate the chemical reactions. Therefore, the conversion time is delayed and during the pre light-off period, high levels of emissions are released. An investigation into methods capable of increasing catalyst temperature under cold start conditions has been carried out. The most beneficial technique used in this research was the secondary air method. The method introduced extra air into the exhaust manifold which allowed the engine to run rich and then the residual unburned fuel to be oxidised in the exhaust before approaching the converter. An experiment following a Box- Behnken design was used to study the effect of engine speed, spark angle, load, relative air/fuel ratio (lambda) and secondary air flow on pre-catalyst temperature. The study suggested the best result for the engine studied was to achieve fast catalytic light-off time was to run engine at 1225 rpm, spark angle of 0 degree BTDC, lambda of 0. 82 and load of 0. 5 bar BMEP. These settings allowed the remaining fuel to be burned with 5. 87 kg/hr of secondary air in the exhaust manifold to achieve a pre-catalytic temperature of 631. 1 QC and achieve light-off for all emissions within 17. 2 seconds. The results were also used to build a temperature prediction model using the Matlab MBC toolbox and the best available model gave an R 2 of 0. 9997 by using radial base functions (RBF). However, the optimum conditions still produced cyclic variation in the combustion, giving an average COVimep of 14. 8 % during the pre-catalytic heating period which caused problems concerning <b>engine</b> <b>smoothness.</b> To derive a greater insight into the mechanisms governing the cyclic variability observed a simulation study was undertaken. The study used a simulation using Ricardo WAVE and Matlab Simulink to allow a detailed representation of some of the principle mechanisms giving rise to cyclic variability under cold start conditions. The study included combustion under rich and lean mixtures and considered the effect of variations of air/fuel ratios and residual gas fraction. As a result, the simulation showed a similar characteristic variability of heat release to that observed experimentally. The validation of the model for heat release showed that the predictions were under estimated by 0. 49 % while under lean combustion, there was an under estimation of 2. 07 %. Both predictions had normally distributed residuals. The model suggested that the residual gas fractions were higher than the limit of 8. 8 % (under rich fuelling) or 8. 0 % (under lean fuelling) that was predicted to cause ignition delay to increase significantly and therefore contribute to high cyclic variability. ' An optimisation was carried out by varying camshaft angle in the simulation. The results suggest that retarding the exhaust camshaft position by 4 degrees (EVC 12 degrees BTDC) could reduce COVimep by 63. 2 % under rich combustion. In contrast, advancing the intake camshaft position suggested that the COVmep can be reduced but more experimental data is required to validate the results because variation of intake camshaft positions had a larger impact on pumping work than varying exhaust camshaft positions. These additional pumping losses result in higher air and fuel flow requirements. In summary, this thesis describes a detailed investigation into the effects of engine calibration on catalyst heating performance. One of the limiting factors in achieving rapid light-off is combustion variability. Extensions have been introduced to an industry standard ID engine simulation to allow realistic cyclic variability to represented and developed. These tools could allow cyclic variability to be considered more rigorously during a calibration exercise. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

An experimental evaluation of two 2670 -N reactor designs was conducted. The steady state and dynamic characteristics of the thruster/valve combinations were determined. The results of the testing, including the <b>engine</b> characteristic velocity, <b>smoothness</b> of combustion, insensitivity to heat sterilization, and response during various simulated duty cycles are presented and discussed.

40|$|This {{piece of}} worl< entails {{the study of}} the {{viability}} of 5 -speed automatic gearbox in a mid-size petrol engine, and includes the assessment of efficient and marketable management strategies for the gearbox. Market research and vehicle testing were conducted to enhance the concepts of the management strategies before building a dynamic vehicle model in Matlab Simulink, with the concentration on gearbox. The engine speed, throttle position, acceleration, velocity and distance travelled were studied with the graphs obtained from Matlab Simulink to analyse the performance, fuel consumption and ride smoothness of the 5 - speed gearbox compared to the 4 -speed. Results show that the proposed 5 -speed gearbox excelled in acceleration, ride <b>smoothness,</b> <b>engine</b> braking and engine silence. On the contrary, ah excessively small fifth gear ratio in a small petrol engine may be arguable in terms of fuel efficiency on the motorway, as the proportion of throttle opening may be significantly larger to compensate the lower engine rpm in maintaining 70 mph. Furthermore, merely adding a fifth overdrive gear onto the 4 -speed gearbox will not increase the performance of the vehicle. On the whole, the replacement of a 4 -speed gearbox with a 5 -speed is only viable with a proper set of gear ratios, and the apparent cost of implementation on an existing 4 - speed Toyota Avensis 2. 0 seemed moderate, as the proposed 5 -speed gearbox is from the same vehicle but a larger engine. Furthermore, it reduces parts differentiation, hence improves production efficiency...|$|R
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{some specific}} data-driven model structures suitable for prediction of NOx and soot emissions from a diesel engine. The model structures {{can be described}} as local linear regression models where the regression parameters are defined by two-dimensional lookup tables. It is highlighted that this structure can be interpreted as a B-spline function. Using the model structure, models are derived from measured <b>engine</b> data. The <b>smoothness</b> of the derived models is controlled by using an additional regularization term, and the globally optimal model parameters can be found by solving a linear least squares problem. Experimental data from a five-cylinder Volvo passenger car diesel engine is used to derive NOx and soot models, using a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy to determine the optimal degree of regularization. The model for NOx emissions predicts the NOx mass flow with an average relative error of 5. 1 % and the model for soot emissions predicts the soot mass flow with an average relative error of 29 % for the mea- surement data used in this study. The behavior of the models for different engine management system settings regarding boost pressure, amount of exhaust gas recirculation, and injection timing has been studied. The models react to the dif- ferent engine management system settings in an expected way, making them suitable for optimization of engine manage- ment system settings. Finally, the model performance dependence on the selected model complexity and on the number of measurement data points used to derive the models has been studied...|$|R
5000|$|After the 1967 Trans-Am {{campaign}} with the 4-Bbl induction system producing more horsepower than the competing auto makers' 8-Bbl systems, for 1968 Chevrolet developed a factory 'cross-ram' aluminum intake-manifold package using two Holley [...] mechanical secondary carburetors for Trans-Am racing. It was available only as off-road service parts purchased over the Chevrolet dealership parts counter. With the Chevrolet '140 1st-design off-road cam, the package increased a stock 302's horsepower from [...] to approximately [...] Chevrolet {{went so far}} as to carry the positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) system over to the cross-ram induction system to retain emissions compliance mandated for US-produced cars beginning in 1967, that also provided full-throttle crankcase pressure venting to the intake air to burn its vapors. Engines prepared for competition use were capable of producing [...] with little more than the 8-Bbl induction, ported heads with higher pressure valvesprings, roller rocker arms, and the '754 2nd-design road-race cam. 1967/1968 models' cowl-induction system had an enclosed air-cleaner assembly ducted from its passenger side into the firewall cowl above the heater core. In 1969, factory Z/28's could be ordered with the ZL-1 aluminum-block 427 adaption of the 1967 L-88 427 Corvette cowl-induction 'ZL-2' hood available for both single and dual four-barrel induction systems that were sealed to the air cleaner base ensuring dense cooler, high-pressure, oxygen-laiden air from the center of the base of the windshield was supplied to the <b>engine</b> for combustion <b>smoothness</b> and maximum power production. Another popular service-parts-only component used on the 302 was the magnetic-pulse Delco transistor-ignition ball-bearing distributor. Introduced in 1963 on Pontiac's 389 and 421 drag racing engines, General Motors fitted it to the 1966? Z/28 before they used it on the L88 [...] Corvette. It eliminated the production breaker-point ignition allowing greater spark energy and more stable ignition timing at all engine speeds including idle. This was one of the least talked about yet most transformative and comprehensive performance and durability upgrades of its time. Many of the 302s off-road service parts were the development work of racers like Roger Penske. Every part in a SCCA Trans-Am engine had to be available through local Chevrolet parts departments to encourage their use by anyone who wanted them.|$|R
