5|$|An 1891 Ordnance Survey {{map shows}} that the arm on the Rochdale Canal had been filled in and the complex's canal basin had been retitled as a reservoir, {{suggesting}} that the canal <b>had</b> <b>ceased</b> <b>to</b> {{be used as a}} way of transporting goods to and from the complex. By 1902, the canal basin had been filled in, however exactly when it was filled in is unknown.|$|E

5|$|After the First World War, another {{programme}} of {{improvements to}} the locks was carried out, extending the locks to , which enabled trains of 19 compartments to operate regularly. Experiments with trains as long as 38 tubs were carried out, but the difficulty of splitting the train {{to pass through the}} locks meant that 19 was the usual maximum. The compartments continued until the late 1960s to carry around half a million tons of coal, long after most British canals <b>had</b> <b>ceased</b> <b>to</b> be used for commercial traffic, but the gradual demise of the coal industry led to compartment traffic ceasing in 1986.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the losses it had suffered, the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) <b>had</b> <b>ceased</b> <b>to</b> be an {{effective}} fighting force. Following a series of raids on the Japanese shipyard at Kure, Japan, the only major warships in fighting order were six aircraft carriers, four cruisers, and one battleship, none of which could be fueled adequately. Although 19destroyers and 38submarines were still operational, their use was limited by the lack of fuel.|$|E

5|$|In middle age, Walton left Britain {{and set up}} {{home with}} his young wife Susana on the Italian island of Ischia. By this time, he <b>had</b> <b>ceased</b> <b>to</b> be {{regarded}} as a modernist, and some of his compositions of the 1950s were criticised as old-fashioned. His only full-length opera, Troilus and Cressida, was among the works to be so labelled and has made little impact in opera houses. In his last years, his works came back into critical fashion; his later compositions, dismissed by critics {{at the time of their}} premieres, were revalued and regarded alongside his earlier works.|$|E

5|$|The name of {{the cross}} is likely to derive {{from the village of}} Camuston. No trace of this village can be seen today, and it <b>had</b> <b>ceased</b> <b>to</b> exist {{by the time of the}} first Ordnance Survey map, {{published}} in 1888, but surveyed in 1857 to 1859. Its former location is indicated in the 1794 map by Ainslie, about half a mile to the east of the cross. Camuston can be found with earlier spelling variations, for example, 'Cambistown' as it is called in documents from 1425 and 1426, and has a Celtic rather than Scandinavian etymology.|$|E

5|$|This {{painting}} is considered among Matejko's most famous works {{and is also}} one of his largest canvases. It portrays an event of significant political triumph for Poland, the Prussian Homage, in which Poland was able to enforce its will over Prussia. Prussia latter gained independence and turned against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, becoming one of the nations that divided Poland among them. Matejko's painting was created during the partition period, when independent Poland <b>had</b> <b>ceased</b> <b>to</b> exist, and like many of Matejko's other works, it aimed to remind the Polish people of their most famous historical triumphs.|$|E
5|$|With the US Army {{forces in}} Europe seeing {{drawdowns}} and redeployments, {{it was announced}} that V Corps would be eliminated, and the 130th Engineer Brigade would be moved elsewhere. The brigade formally left Hanau with a Casing of the Colors ceremony at Pioneer Kaserne on 4 May 2007. Casing the unit's colors was a tradition formally signifying its inactivation and, for all official purposes, the brigade <b>had</b> <b>ceased</b> <b>to</b> be an active Army unit. The brigade headquarters became part of U.S. Army Pacific on 16 June 2007.|$|E
5|$|Among large North American carnivores, {{the coyote}} {{probably}} carries {{the largest number}} of diseases and parasites, likely due to its wide range and varied diet. Viral diseases known to infect coyotes include rabies, canine distemper, infectious canine hepatitis, four strains of equine encephalitis, and oral papillomatosis. By the late 1970s, serious rabies outbreaks in coyotes <b>had</b> <b>ceased</b> <b>to</b> be a problem for over 60 years, though sporadic cases every 1–5 years did occur. Distemper causes the deaths of many pups in the wild, though some specimens can survive infection. Tularemia, a bacterial disease, infects coyotes through their rodent and lagomorph prey, and can be deadly for pups.|$|E

5|$|Author Edward Macan views British symphonic pop as a {{splinter}} of {{the progressive}} rock genre that relied on straightforward songwriting, rich vocal arrangements and quasi-orchestral fullness, citing Supertramp, ELO, 10cc, the Alan Parsons Project, and Al Stewart as examples. By the late 1970s, the era of record labels investing in their artists, giving them freedom to experiment and limited control over their content and marketing had ended. Corporate artists and repertoire staff began exerting an increasing amount {{of control over the}} creative process that had previously belonged to the artists. Some of the major progressive bands transitioned to a more commercial sound and deemphasized the evocation of art music. By the early 1980s, the prevailing view was that the progressive rock style <b>had</b> <b>ceased</b> <b>to</b> exist.|$|E
5|$|Composite bows {{were soon}} adopted and adapted by civilizations {{who came into}} contact with nomads, such as the Chinese, Assyrian, and Egyptian. Several {{composite}} bows were found in the tomb of Tutankhamun, who died in 1324 BCE. Composite bows (and chariots) are known in China from at least the Shang Dynasty (1700–1100 BCE). We have strong indications to believe that Bronze Age Greek Cultures like the Minoans and the Mycenaeans were using composite bows in a large scale. By the 4th century BCE, chariotry <b>had</b> <b>ceased</b> <b>to</b> have military importance, replaced by cavalry everywhere (except in Britannia where charioteers are not recorded as using bows).|$|E
5|$|In 1879, Smetana {{had written}} to a friend, the Czech poet Jan Neruda, {{revealing}} fears of the onset of madness. By the winter of 1882–83 he was experiencing depression, insomnia, and hallucinations, together with giddiness, cramp and a temporary loss of speech. In 1883 he began writing a new symphonic suite, Prague Carnival, but could get no further than an Introduction and a Polonaise. He started a new opera, Viola, based on the character in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, but wrote only fragments as his mental state gradually deteriorated. In October 1883 his behaviour at a private reception in Prague disturbed his friends; {{by the middle of}} February 1884 he <b>had</b> <b>ceased</b> <b>to</b> be coherent, and was periodically violent. On 23April his family, unable to nurse him any longer, removed him to the Kateřinky Lunatic Asylum in Prague, where he died on 12May 1884.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s, the Merrie England bar and an {{amusement}} arcade were constructed {{at the end}} of the pier nearest to the shore. The 1939 theatre, which is still in use, narrowly escaped damage in 1985 when the early stages of a fire were noticed by performer Vince Hill. In the 1980s, a Victorian-styled entrance was built. In 1991 the pier gained the Carousel bar as an additional attraction, and a small tramway to ease access to the pier-head. By this point, the pier <b>had</b> <b>ceased</b> <b>to</b> have any nautical use, but the jetty section was adapted for use as a helicopter pad in the late 1980s. The Christmas Eve storm of 1997 destroyed the landing jetty, including the helipad.|$|E
5|$|In the Byzantine state, {{the emperor}} {{was the sole}} and {{absolute}} ruler, and his power was regarded as having divine origin. The Senate <b>had</b> <b>ceased</b> <b>to</b> have real political and legislative authority but remained as an honorary council with titular members. By {{the end of the}} 8th century, a civil administration focused on the court was formed as part of a large-scale consolidation of power in the capital (the rise to pre-eminence of the position of sakellarios is related to this change). The most important administrative reform, which probably started in the mid-7th century, was the creation of themes, where civil and military administration was exercised by one person, the strategos.|$|E
5|$|On 11 April, Petrović and {{the staff}} of 1st Army Group {{headquarters}} were captured by Ustaše at Petrinja, and the rear area staff of 4th Army headquarters were captured by Ustaše at Topusko.
