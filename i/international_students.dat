40|$|In 1985, the Australian {{government}} instituted {{major changes}} to its <b>international</b> <b>student</b> policy. These changes signalled {{a shift in}} <b>International</b> <b>Student</b> Program intent from an emphasis on international enrolments {{as a form of}} humanitarianism - the main focus of the Program since its inception in 1950 - to a tradeorientated approach in which <b>international</b> <b>student</b> fees represented an important source of revenue for tertiary institutions. Whilst this paradigmatic shift in the conceptualisation of <b>international</b> <b>student</b> enrolments is well documented, the manner in which this transition to a market-oriented Program is represented in the media of the time has attracted less scholarly attention. This paper reports on research that examines Australian newspaper coverage of the <b>International</b> <b>Student</b> Program and its transition to a trade-orientated model during the 1980 s and into the 1990 s and early 2000 s. Importantly, it identifies two discursive constructions of the <b>international</b> <b>student</b> population that co-exist within the textual corpus, expressing contrasting views about the nature and purpose of education...|$|R
