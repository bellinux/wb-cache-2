40|$|Abstract—This is {{the first}} paper to discuss the ON-state <b>drain–current</b> of a special {{thin-film}} transistor structure with a wide channel width and a narrow source/drain width in the linear region. The experimental results indicate that when the channel width is wider than the source/drain width, the side-channel current effect is generated. This effect increases the ON-state <b>drain–current</b> due to the additional current-flow paths exist-ing in the side-channel regions and low channel resistance. As the side-channel width increases, the ON-state <b>drain–current</b> ini-tially increases and then gradually becomes independent of the side-channel width when the side-channel width {{is larger than the}} effective side-channel width, which depends on the channel width and is largely independent of the source/drain width. This paper also demonstrates that the ON-state <b>drain–current</b> gain is directly proportional to the channel length and the ratio of the channel length to the source/drain width and dependent on the side-channel width.

Two device layer structures, InGaN channel design and InGaN back-barrier design, were employed to improve the confinement of Two-Dimensional Electron Gas (2 DEG) and mitigate the short-channel effects. The devices exhibited high <b>drain-currents</b> of 1. 3 A/mm and delivered RF powers of 3. 1 W/mm at 26 GHz with a 35 V drain bias. A cutoff frequency of about 65 GHz and a maximum oscillation frequency of 94 GHz have been achieved. The subthreshold swing and the Drain Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL) in those devices are less than 75 mV/decade and 80 mV/V, respectively. To further improve the confinement of 2 DEG, we combined and optimized the InGaN channel design with the InGaN back-barrier design.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} an alternative way of driving the complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) device into different <b>drain-current</b> levels for low-frequency-noise (LFN) characterization. A floating-gate (FG) test structure that constructs the characterized MOSFET {{with an extra}} control gate is proposed. A metal–insulator–metal (MIM) capacitor is used to construct this control gate. Instead of applying different input-dc-bias supplies for the gate terminals of the MOSFETs, the device is directly programmed to the <b>drain-current</b> levels of interest by CHARGE/DISCHARGE operations. In this case, no gate bias is required in the <b>drain-current</b> noise measurement, so that any potential disadvantages from gate-bias supply networks that would prevent accurate noise measurements are totally excluded.

It is shown that the contributions of charge trapping and defect creation to the <b>drain–current</b> degradation can be discriminated based on stress time, stress voltage, and temperature.

The source to drain current of the field effect transistor was monitored before, during, and after p lasma processing. At a fixed source to drain potential difference, devices displayed a drain-cur-rent decrease during p lasma exposure; this indicates an increase in the fixed negative charge in the oxide and/or a decreased transconductance due to an increase in the density of interface traps. A portion of the <b>drain-current</b> decrease was recovered after exposure to room air or in situ exposure to water vapor suggesting that the <b>drain-current</b> decrease was caused by electron-trapping at water-related traps in the oxide. The remainder of the <b>drain-current</b> decrease was recovered after annealing at 400 ~ in forming gas and was caused most likely by electron-trapping at neutral electron traps.

40|$|Traps effects (due to the {{presence}} of surface-state densities and deep-levels) in AlGaN/GaN HEMT devices cause slow current transients referred as gate-lag and drain-lag effects that become a cause of so called current collapse. Current collapse is a reversible reduction of <b>drain-current</b> when both the gate and drain voltages are changed abruptly. This effect cause important deviation between DC and dynamic I/V characteristics that limits the output power of the device at high frequencies. In addition, traps state depends on thermal and illumination conditions of the device.

40|$|A {{simulation}} {{study is}} made of floating-body effects (FBEs) in vertical MOSFETs due to depletion isolation as the pillar thickness is reduced from 200 to 10 nm. For pillar thicknesses between 200 – 60 nm, the output characteristics with and without impact ionization are identical at a low drain bias and then diverge at a high drain bias. The critical drain bias Vdc for which the increased <b>drain–current</b> is observed is found to decrease with a reduction in pillar thickness. This is explained by the onset of FBEs at progressively lower values of the drain bias due to the merging of the drain depletion regions {{at the bottom of}} the pillar (depletion isolation). For pillar thicknesses between 60 – 10 nm, the output characteristics show the opposite behavior, namely, the critical drain bias increases with a reduction in pillar thickness. This is explained by a reduction in the severity of the FBEs due to the drain debiasing effect caused by the elevated body potential.

So far, unsurpassed current levels and high output power at microwave frequencies have been achieved. However, the dominant factors limiting {{the reliability of}} these devices under high-power operation are still unsettled. Drain current collapse {{is one of the}} major encumbrances in the development of reliable high-power devices in this technology. In this thesis, an accurate and versatile analytical model based on the concept of virtual gate formation due to the existence of acceptor type surface states is developed to model the current-collapse phenomenon. The implementation of this simple and at the same time precise analytical model demonstrates superb agreement with the experimental observations of permanent/semi-permanent current collapse in AlGaN/GaN HFETs. An analytical model, with incorporation of transferred-electron effect, for <b>drain-current</b> characteristics of AlGaN/GaN HFETs is also presented. Oftentimes, the transferred electron effect is neglected in modeling the <b>drain-current</b> characteristics of III-V HFETs. The broader steady-state electron drift-velocity overshoot of GaN in comparison to other direct semiconductors such as GaAs and InP, in addition to the larger difference between the peak and saturation drift-velocity, and the wider bandgap of this semiconductor predict the importance of the incorporation of transferred-electron effect (i. e. steady-state drift-velocity overshoot) in modeling the <b>drain-current</b> of these devices. Simulation results are compared with the results of the adoption of Ridley’s mobility model which does not take into account the transferred-electron effect.
