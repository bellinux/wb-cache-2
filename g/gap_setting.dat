40|$|The Cygnus Dual Beam Radiographic Facility {{consists}} of two identical radiographic sources: Cygnus 1 and Cygnus 2. Each source has the following X-ray output: 1 -mm diameter spot size, 4 rads at 1 m, 50 -ns full-widthhalf-maximum. The diode pulse has the following electrical specifications: 2. 25 MV, 60 kA, 60 ns. This Radiographic Facility is located in an underground tunnel test area at the Nevada Test Site (NTS). The sources were developed to produce high-resolution images on subcritical tests performed at NTS. Subcritical tests are single-shot, high-value events. For this application, it is desirable to maintain {{a high level of}} reproducibility in source output. The major components of the Cygnus machines are Marx generator, water-filled pulse forming line (PFL), water-filled coaxial transmission line, threecell inductive voltage adder, and rod-pinch diode. A primary source of fluctuation in Cygnus shot-to-shot performance may be jitter in breakdown of the main PFL switch, which is a “self-break” switch. The PFL switch breakdown time determines the peak PFL charging voltage, which ultimately affects the source X-ray spectrum and dose. Therefore, PFL switch jitter may contribute to shot-to-shot variation in these parameters, which are crucial to radiographic quality. In this paper we will present PFL switch jitter analysis for both Cygnus machines and present the correlation with dose. For this analysis, the PFL switch on each machine was maintained at a single <b>gap</b> <b>setting,</b> which has been used for the majority of shots at NTS. In addition the PFL switch performance for one larger switch <b>gap</b> <b>setting</b> will be examined...|$|E

40|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{financial}} crisis, there has been much discussion about whether boards (particularly of banks) are sufficiently accountable. However, while a significant literature has grown up in relation to the study of accountability in various disciplines, particularly public administration and politics, in the field of corporate governance there has been little consideration of what accountability means or entails. This is problematic: without a clearer idea of the elusive concept of accountability, debates about board accountability may be at cross-purposes. It will be difficult to assess whether particular corporate governance mechanisms promote board accountability, and if not, why not. The lack of clarity can also mask accountability deficits.

40|$|Abstract: Micrometer sale nickel {{column was}} {{fabricated}} by a novel process called microanode guided electroplating (MAGE) process. A Pt wire (125 μm in diameter) was mounted with epoxy resin to expose a tip {{to act as}} a microanode. The microanode was controlled to move in an electroplating bath to guide the growth of columns on a polished copper surface. The effect of electric field strength (controlling by adjustment of dc-voltage bias and the gap between the electrodes) on the morphology of the columns was of interest. The morphology of the microcolumn was examined using scanning electron microscope (SEM). Electric bias and inter-electrode gap determines the fabrication rate and surface morphology of the columns. In the process conducted at a gap of 10 μm and 3. 2 V, the column is formed with smooth surface and uniformed diameter. In the process performed at the same gap but higher biases (e. g., at 4. 2 V), the fabricating rate accelerates and the surface morphology is rougher. It is worth noting in the case of MAGE conducted at 3. 2 V, the column leads to nodular morphology as the <b>gap</b> <b>set</b> less than 25 μm but it turns to bamboo-like as the <b>gap</b> <b>set</b> higher than 25 μm...|$|R

Eight process {{parameters}} namely pulse-on time, pulse-off time, peak current, spark <b>gap</b> <b>set</b> voltage, wire feed, wire tension, water pressure, pulse peak voltage and servo feed are varied to study {{their effect on}} surface roughness and wire breakage. The experiments are conducted using one-factor-at-a-time approach. Moreover, a few random experiments are also carried to study the phenomenon of wire breakage precisely. The study revealed that surface roughness is directly affected by the pulse-on time, pulse-off time, peak- current, spark <b>gap</b> <b>set</b> voltage and wire tension. Wire feed, Water pressure and pulse peak voltage have negligible effect on the surface roughness. Moreover, wire breakage is predominantly dictated by all the parameters except peak current and pulse peak voltage. An optimum range of input parameters has been bracketed as the final outcome for cutting in terms of surface roughness and to minimize the wire breakage frequency. Titanium and its alloys are considered excellent materials for their applications in aerospace and automobile industries because of their improved mechanical and physical properties like high strength, high strength to weight ratio, high toughness, corrosion resistance and oxidation resistance.

40|$|In a basic, {{ram-type}} EDM system (figure 1 - 1 O), the {{ram head}} is driven {{up and down}} with extreme accuracy by a servodriven system. The servo system is controlled by a microprocessor connected to the power supply. The power supply is solid-state and is also microprocessor controlled. One lead from the power supply is connected to the workpiece, which is immersed in a tank of dielectric oil. The dielectric tank is connected to a dielectric pump, an oil reservoir, and a filter system. The pump provides pressure for flushing the work area and moving the oil while the filter system removes and traps debris in the oil. The oil reservoir stores surplus oil and provides a container for draining the oil between operations. The other lead from the power supply is connected to the electrode. The power supply provides a pulsed DC output to the electrode/workpiece system. On-times and off-times are set manually, along with voltage and current values. When the EDM machine is turned on, the servo microprocessor, sensing that the gap is too wide for cutting to take place, signals the servo mechanism to lower the ram head.

This paper presents the outcome of the follow-up studies which had been decided at the time. In a first step, a number of dedicated investigations have been made to identify the potential contribution of different factors to the variation in measurement results. In particular, the impact of waiting time after test sample preparation, <b>gap</b> <b>setting</b> procedure, bonding temperature, conditioning times and temperature sweep procedure have been investigated. How to establish the limits of the linear domain of visco-elasticity is another issue which has been dealt with. This has allowed to define more stringent operating conditions which have then been followed by the participating laboratories for a final round robin limited to a pure bitumen (50 / 70) and the most difficult PmB (high level of plastomer modified product). In comparison to the first round robin, reproducibility was indeed improved, even for the modified product.

This Radiographic Facility is located in an underground tunnel test area at the Nevada Test Site (NTS). The sources were developed to produce high-resolution images on subcritical tests which are performed at NTS. Subcritical tests are single-shot, high-value events.

The major components of the Cygnus machines are: Marx generator, water-filled pulse–forming line (PFL), water-filled coaxial transmission line, three-cell inductive voltage adder, and rod-pinch diode. A primary source of fluctuation in Cygnus shot-to-shot performance is jitter in breakdown of the main PFL switch, which is a “self-break” switch. The PFL switch breakdown time determines the peak PFL charging voltage, which ultimately affects the diode pulse. Therefore, PFL switch jitter contributes to shot-to-shot variation in source endpoint energy and dose. In this paper we will present PFL switch jitter analysis for both Cygnus machines and give the correlation with diode performance.

40|$|Abstract. Nimonic- 80 A is {{a nickel}} based super alloy which is {{specifically}} used in aerospace industry for its high {{strength to weight}} ratio and corrosion resistance. This paper presents the influence of process parameters of wire cut Electrical Discharge Machining (WEDM) during the machining of Nimonic 80 A with brass wire as electrode and optimization of machining parameters on kerf width. Process parameters (pulse-on time, pulse-off time, peak current, spark <b>gap</b> <b>set</b> voltage, wire feed and wire tension) have been investigated using L 27 orthogonal array. With the assistance of Taguchi quality design, ANOVA and F-test, significant parameters affecting the kerf have been identified. The surface topography of machined samples has been studied in correlation with the rate of input energy into the spark. 1...|$|R
