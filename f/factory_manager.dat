5|$|Beginning {{with their}} third album, Master of Reality, Black Sabbath began to feature tuned-down guitars. In 1965, before forming Black Sabbath, guitarist Tony Iommi {{suffered}} an accident {{while working in}} a sheet metal factory, losing the tips of two fingers on his right hand. Iommi almost gave up music, but was urged by the <b>factory</b> <b>manager</b> to listen to Django Reinhardt, a jazz guitarist who lost the use of two fingers in a fire. Inspired by Reinhardt, Iommi created two thimbles made of plastic and leather to cap off his missing fingertips. The guitarist began using lighter strings, and detuning his guitar, to better grip the strings with his prosthesis. Early in the band's history Iommi experimented with different dropped tunings, including C tuning, or 3 semitones down, before settling on E/D tuning, or a half-step down from standard tuning.|$|E

30|$|The TCSI {{model has}} a {{predictive}} capability {{that can help}} tourism <b>factory</b> <b>managers</b> improve customer satisfaction based on different performance levels. Our model enables managers to determine the specific factors that significantly affect overall customer satisfaction and loyalty within a tourism factory. This study also helps managers to address different customer segments (e.g., satisfied vs. dissatisfied); because the purchase behaviors of customers differ, they must be treated differently. The contribution {{of this paper is}} to propose two satisfaction levels of CSI models for analyzing customer satisfaction and loyalty, thereby helping tourism <b>factory</b> <b>managers</b> improve customer satisfaction effectively.|$|R

25|$|Jacques de Kadt (30 July 1897, Oss – 16 April 1988, Santpoort) was a {{prominent}} and often controversial 20th Century Dutch political thinker, politician and man of letters. Born into a liberal Jewish family, he was the youngest son of a <b>factory</b> <b>manager,</b> Roelof de Kadt, and his wife Bertha Koppens. Author of numerous books and articles, his reputation was established by his book Het fascisme en de nieuwe vrijheid (Fascism and the New Freedom) {{which was published in}} 1939, shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|When in 1872 N.A. Otto and Cie reorganized as Gasmotoren-Fabrik Deutz, {{management}} picked Daimler as <b>factory</b> <b>manager,</b> bypassing even Otto, and Daimler {{joined the}} company in August, bringing in Maybach as chief designer. While Daimler managed to improve production, the weakness in the Otto's vertical piston design, coupled to Daimler's stubborn insistence on atmospheric engines, led the company to an impasse. Neither Otto nor Daimler would give way, and when Daimler was offered the choice of founding a Deutz branch in St. Petersburg or resigning, he resigned {{to set up shop}} in Cannstatt (financed by savings and shares in Deutz), where he was shortly joined by Maybach.|$|E

25|$|The musical dramatizes the 1913 {{trial of}} Jewish <b>factory</b> <b>manager</b> Leo Frank, {{who was accused}} and convicted of raping and murdering a thirteen-year-old employee, Mary Phagan. The trial, sensationalized by the media, aroused antisemitic {{tensions}} in Atlanta and the U.S. state of Georgia. When Frank's death sentence was commuted {{to life in prison}} by the departing Governor of Georgia, John M. Slaton due to his detailed review of over 10,000 pages of testimony and possible problems with the trial, Leo Frank was transferred to a prison in Milledgeville, Georgia, where a lynching party seized and kidnapped him. Frank was taken to Phagan's hometown of Marietta, Georgia, and he was hanged from an oak tree. The events surrounding the investigation and trial led to two groups emerging: the revival of the defunct KKK and the birth of the Jewish Civil Rights organization, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL).|$|E
500|$|Lola and {{the angels}} {{arrive at the}} factory, and she is {{immediately}} unsatisfied with Charlie's first design of the boot. Quickly getting {{the women of the}} factory on her side, she draws a quick design of a boot, explaining the most important factor is by far the sex appeal ("The Sex is in the Heel"). [...] George, the <b>factory</b> <b>manager,</b> realizes a way to make her design practical, and an impressed Charlie begs Lola to stay until a prestigious footwear show in Milan in three weeks' time, to design a new line of [...] "kinky boots" [...] that could save the factory. Lola is reluctant, since she is already receiving crass comments from some of the factory workers, but is flattered by Charlie's praise, and finally agrees.|$|E
500|$|Chris Browning of the Eugene, Oregon-based Atari Computer Enthusiasts {{wrote that}} Gumball {{was a good}} {{interlude}} between shoot-em-up games, but found that he lost interest when tasked with sorting four or more colors of gumballs. Compute!'s Gazette thought that Gumball was fun, and highlighted its [...] "comical" [...] elements, such as the <b>factory</b> <b>manager</b> emptying the player's bin when the player incorrectly sorts the wrong color into it. The magazine described Gumball as a [...] "strategy-action" [...] game and considered it a useful aid in developing faculties of logic and hand-eye coordination. David Hunter of Softalk asked whether the game was satirical commentary [...] "on the Great American Dream of climbing the corporate ladder" [...] {{depending on whether the}} factory work inculcated [...] "good work habits" [...] or [...] "Disney-esque automatons". He wrote that the game had what corporate trainers would want: an introduction to repetitive tasks and a sense of nervous energy. Three decades later, Jason Koebler of Motherboard summarized that the game never became popular and that copies of it became rare.|$|E
50|$|At a {{rendering}} plant located near Angoon in October 1882, a shaman and aristocrat named Til'tlein {{was killed in}} an accident that involved the factory's boats and harpoon bombs. Another man had been violently killed recently, and his relatives had not been compensated by the <b>factory</b> <b>managers</b> for his death, a customary Tlingit practice that they had honored previously. The Tlingits had let the previous matter rest, to maintain friendly relations. However, when Til'tlein was killed and the owners again refused to compensate his survivors, the Angoon residents followed traditional Tlingit practice: they seized the boats and weapons involved in the death and took a few whites hostage until the <b>factory</b> <b>managers</b> repaid them for the deaths. They claimed compensation of two hundred blankets from the factory.|$|R

On his father's side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from Marche and Catalonia, and on his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry. Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, [...] "Leo" [...] developed {{a passion for the}} sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Matías, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers. At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches. He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute of his grandmother.|$|E

[...] The Il-2 aircraft {{played a crucial role}} on the Eastern Front. Joseph Stalin paid the Il-2 a great tribute in his own inimitable manner: when a particular production factory fell behind on its deliveries, Stalin sent an angrily worded cable to the <b>factory</b> <b>manager,</b> stating [...] "They are as essential to the Red Army as air and bread," [...] and [...] "I demand more machines.

Three supervisors from the factory were arrested on 28 November on charges of criminal negligence. Police accused them of padlocking exits and preventing workers from leaving the building.

2500|$|Inspired by Most's {{theories}} of Attentat, Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman, enraged by {{the deaths of}} workers during the Homestead strike, put words into action with Berkman's attempted assassination of Homestead <b>factory</b> <b>manager</b> Henry Clay Frick in 1892. Berkman and Goldman were soon disillusioned as Most became one of Berkman's most outspoken critics. In Freiheit, Most attacked both Goldman and Berkman, implying Berkman's act was designed to arouse sympathy for Frick. Goldman's biographer Alice Wexler suggests that Most's criticisms may {{have been inspired by}} jealousy of Berkman. Goldman was enraged, and demanded that Most prove his insinuations. When he refused to respond, she confronted him at next lecture. After he refused to speak to her, she lashed him across the face with a horsewhip, broke the whip over her knee, then threw the pieces at him. She later regretted her assault, confiding to a friend, [...] "At the age of twenty-three, one does not reason." ...|$|E

50|$|Reform {{was largely}} focused on {{industry}} and on cooperatives, and a limited role {{was given to}} the development of foreign investment and international trade. <b>Factory</b> <b>managers</b> were expected to meet state demands for goods, but to find their own funding. Perestroika reforms went far enough to create new bottlenecks in the Soviet economy but arguably did not go far enough to effectively streamline it.|$|R
25|$|The {{difference}} in production costs between the Philippines and other manufacturing {{countries such as}} China are a huge factor in {{the decline of the}} textile industry in the Philippines. A Manila based company selling materials and clothing to the Gap brand costs up to fifty cents more in production costs compared to if the garment was manufactured in China. Many of the former Filipino workers in the textile industry left to work in other manufacturing or service industries. Some workers decided to focus on making clothes, garments, and textiles for domestic markets, although the instability of these markets has weakened their potential income. As for supervisors and <b>factory</b> <b>managers,</b> some have found employment in other countries such as Bangladesh and Sri Lanka where {{there is a need for}} supervisors and <b>factory</b> <b>managers.</b> Government initiatives such as the Save Our Industries Act offer potential solutions to the failing industry, such as sending American textiles to the Philippines and repurposing them as garments made from the Philippines, but also has many uncertainties as the bill lacks bipartisan support within the U.S. Congress.|$|R
