2500|$|Although {{official}} German air doctrine did target civilian morale, {{it did not}} espouse the attacking {{of civilians}} directly. It hoped to destroy morale by destroying the enemy's factories and public utilities {{as well as its}} food stocks (by attacking shipping). Nevertheless, its official opposition to attacks on civilians became an increasingly moot point when large-scale raids were conducted in November and December 1940. Although not encouraged by official policy, the use of mines and incendiaries, for tactical expediency, came close to indiscriminate bombing. Locating targets in skies obscured by industrial haze meant the target area needed to be illuminated and hit [...] "without regard for the civilian population". Special units, such as KGr 100, became the Beleuchtergruppe (<b>Firelighter</b> Group), which used incendiaries and high explosive to mark the target area.

40|$|<b>Firelighting</b> {{behaviour}} amongst {{children and}} adolescents poses a significant concern {{for the well-being of}} the young person and their wider communities. Often difficult to detect, young firelighters account for a fifth of the fires lit in Australia. The focus {{of this study was to}} explore the characteristics and profiles of young firelighters in an Australian sample and to determine the rate of recidivism and identify variables that may predict <b>firelighting</b> recidivism risk. The present research involved two separate parts. Study One involved the analysis of the Juvenile Fire Awareness and Intervention Program (JFAIP) database. A total of 661 cases were involved in this analysis with males accounting for 91. 5 %. The results suggest that there are significant associations between <b>firelighting</b> severity and age, gender, fire interest, receiving counselling, and level of planning prior to the <b>firelighting</b> incident. Fire interest decreased with age although fire curiosity was the most frequent motivation behind <b>firelighting.</b> Significant associations were also identified between age and motivation behind <b>firelighting,</b> actions following <b>firelighting,</b> and the ownership of <b>firelighting</b> episodes.

[...] was involved in the campaign from the first operation to the last. II./KG 55 was selected to operate as a pathfinder unit alongside the specialist Kampfgruppe 100, and III./Kampfgeschwader 26. They were referred to in the Luftwaffe as Beleuchtergruppe (<b>Firelighter</b> Group). It was not equipped with special aids for this task unlike the other Geschwader, and has rarely been credited with this role. The crews were highly experienced in night operations and selected to help lead the attacks under the command of Major Friedrich Kless. The three units operated in unison often: KGr 100 illuminated the target with incendiaries and the later formations dropped high explosive bombs to destroy water mains and impede fire-fighting efforts.|$|E

The younger children were dropped out of the windows by their nurses wrapped in blankets. Countess Magdalena of Regenstein was trapped by the flames. The countess asked her husband, Count Ulrich to leave her and save his life. The count escaped through the toilet window and hung from it on the outside before being rescued having been badly burnt. In memory of the fire and the dead, Count Ulrich had a plaque made with inscriptions in Latin and German. It portrays the count, the countess, their six sons and four daughters.|$|E

5000|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century there were also sidings to peat moss works on Thorne and Hatfield Moors. Creyke's Siding was originally a small trailing siding {{to the west of the}} line. Its construction was negotiated by Richard Boynton Creyke, and authorised by an agreement dated 7 May 1863. It was close to Moor Road, and there was a signal box to the east of the line at the crossing. The Peat Moss Litter Company built a works to the east of the line in 1886, and agreement was reached for a longer trailing siding to serve the works, on the opposite side of the main line to the original siding. The agreement was dated 11 February 1887. The siding agreement was assigned to William Smith & Co on 9 February 1894, who had taken over the works in 1889. The works was served by a network of [...] gauge horsedrawn tramways, extending onto the moors. Smiths also built a <b>firelighter</b> and disinfectant works near the northern end of the siding. Both products were peat based. The British Moss Litter Co Ltd took over the site in 1896, but failed to notify the North Eastern Railway, who noted the change in 1909. Lengthy correspondence followed, resulting in a new siding agreement being reached on 21 January 1910. The railway company also recorded that the siding was used by a farmer called Mr G Dougherty and by the Nego Firelighting Company in 1908. The peat works operated until 1950-51, and was largely demolished in 1970-71.|$|E

40|$|Here, we {{describe}} a targeted reverse genetic screen for thermal nociception genes in Drosophila larvae. Using laser capture microdissection and microarray analyses of nociceptive and non-nociceptive neurons, we identified 275 nociceptor-enriched genes. We then tested {{the function of}} the enriched genes with nociceptor-specific RNAi and thermal nociception assays. Tissue-specific RNAi targeted against 14 genes caused insensitive thermal nociception while targeting of 22 genes caused hypersensitive thermal nociception. Previously uncategorized genes were named for heat resistance (i. e., boilerman, fire dancer, oven mitt, trivet, thawb, and bunker gear) or heat sensitivity (<b>firelighter,</b> black match, eucalyptus, primacord, jet fuel, detonator, gasoline, smoke alarm, and jetboil). Insensitive nociception phenotypes were often associated with severely reduced branching of nociceptor neurites and hyperbranched dendrites were seen in two of the hypersensitive cases. Many genes that we identified are conserved in mammals...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a growing {{interest}} in the use of partnering in construction. Central to any successful partnering arrangement is the change in cultural and behavioural characteristics towards mutual trust and understanding. Leadership is originally the source of the beliefs and values which forms shared assumptions of organisational culture. This paper builds on the leadership literature which has so ably demonstrated the influence of powerful leaders. As Bueno and Bowditch states “the reality may be that managing will remain much more of an art than a science”. However true this statement may be, there is {{a number of things that}} management can do to further cultural integration and the success of construction partnering projects. This paper initially reviews the theory behind partnering, culture and leadership. It stages arguments and discussions over the importance of behavioural aspects of leadership and explores applicability of leadership styles to construction partnering projects. Further, this establishes the requirement of project leader to exhibit different leadership styles and modes of motivation to demonstrate a range of behaviours together with the combination of transformational and transactional, <b>firelighter</b> leadership style...|$|E
