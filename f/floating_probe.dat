Up to now, most research has focussed on balancing the load on several resources of the same type, i. e. balancing either CPU load or I/O load. In this paper, we present <b>floating</b> <b>probe,</b> a strategy for parallel evaluation of pipelining segments in a shared-everything environment that provides dynamic load balancing between CPU- and I/O-resources. The key idea of <b>floating</b> <b>probe</b> is to overlap [...] -as much as possible with respect to data dependencies [...] -I/O-bound build phase and CPU-bound probe phase of pipelining segments to improve resource utilization. Simulation results show, that <b>floating</b> <b>probe</b> achieves shorter execution times while consuming less memory than conventional pipelining strategies...|$|E

40|$|The initial {{density and}} {{electron}} temperature {{at the surface}} of a ferroelectric plasma source were deduced from <b>floating</b> <b>probe</b> measurements in an expanding plasma. The method exploits negative charging of the <b>floating</b> <b>probe</b> capacitance by fast flows before the expanding plasma reaches the probe. The temporal profiles of the plasma density can be obtained from the voltage traces of the discharge of the charged probe capacitance by the ion current from the expanding plasma. The temporal profiles of the plasma density, at two different distances {{from the surface of the}} ferroelectric plasma source, could be further fitted by using the density profiles for the expanding plasma. This gives the initial values of the plasma density and electron temperature at the surface.

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} use of hairpin probes in plasma where RF plasma {{potential}} is present. The microwave resonance of the hairpin is used to determine electron density. Two types of hairpin probe were used. One type was dc coupled: its dc potential could be varied while monitoring its resonance frequency and collected current. The other probe {{was designed to be}} fully floating, being (dc) isolated from ground and able to float with RF variations in the plasma potential. Additional measurements of the RF plasma potential and its effect on the dc floating potential of the former probe were made using a wire loop probe. The resonant frequency of the dc coupled probe at zero current (nominal floating potential) was less than that determined from the fully <b>floating</b> <b>probe.</b> This is attributed to the wider sheath around the former caused by RF plasma potential across it. The presence of the electron-free sheath around the wires of the hairpin is included in the analysis that links the resonant frequency to the electron density in the bulk plasma. When the dc coupled probe was biased at the true floating potential (determined from independent loop probe measurements) its resonant frequency was closer to, though still consistently higher than, that of the <b>floating</b> <b>probe.</b> This work shows that RF potential across the probe sheath affects the resonance of a hairpin probe and should be accounted for when using hairpin probes in discharges where RF plasma potential variations are even as low as a few times the electron temperature (in volts) ...|$|E

Random rectification of ac voltages leads to a magnetization flux, which can be detected by an asymmetry of Hall resistances in a multi-terminal setup. In the absence of applied magnetic field through a chaotic quantum dot the IFE scale, quadratic in voltage, is found as an analytic function of the ac frequency, screening, and coupling to the contacts and <b>floating</b> <b>probes,</b> and numerically it does not show any effect of spin-orbit interaction.

The large structure and high voltage arrays of the ISS represent a complex system interacting with LEO plasma.

Based on theoretical and physical understanding of the interaction phenomena, a model of ISS plasma interaction has been developed. The model includes magnetic induction effects, interaction of the high voltage solar arrays with ionospheric plasma, and accounts for other conductive areas on the ISS. Based on these phenomena, the Plasma Interaction Model has been developed.

40|$|Description {{of a model}} {{developed}} to predict the interactions between multiple electrostatic probes separated by distances that are shorter than or comparable to the characteristic plasma shielding length. The computation involves crude approximations accounting for space charge effects, currents due to the emission and exchange of photoelectrons, and currents from the ambient plasma. Floating potentials are calculated by requiring current balance for each probe and solving by iterating the resulting coupled nonlinear equations. Although only qualitative accuracy is claimed, predictions using the model {{are found to be}} in good agreement with observations from the Explorer 45 satellite. The Explorer 45 satellite measures the potential difference between a pair of symmetrical spherical <b>floating</b> <b>probes.</b> The Explorer 45 data show that with increasing altitude, first, the sunward sphere will typically assume a more negative potential than the antisunward sphere; second, the polarities of the probes in the region L = 2 to 4 may switch, sometimes several times; and, finally, near the plasmapause the detector output may saturate, the sunward sphere being more negative...|$|R
40|$|We predict by first-principles {{calculations}} that {{thin films}} of Cr-doped (Bi,Sb) _ 2 Te_ 3 magnetic topological insulator have gapless non-chiral edge states coexisting with the chiral edge state. Such gapless non-chiral {{states are not}} immune to backscattering, which would explain dissipative transport in the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) state observed in this system experimentally. Here we study the edge transport with both chiral and non-chiral states by Landaur-Büttiker formalism, and find that the longitudinal resistance is nonzero whereas Hall resistance is quantized to h/e^ 2. In particular, the longitudinal resistance can be greatly reduced by adding an extra <b>floating</b> <b>probe</b> {{even if it is}} not used, while the Hall resistance remains at the quantized value. We propose several transport experiments to detect the dissipative non-chiral edge channels.

The power density and frequency of the fundamental increased with the Shuttle charge-up potential. The emission level observed during the beam sequences increased with the charge-up potential of the Orbiter, which largely depended on the wake structure. It is most likely that the ELF oscillations are expressions of fluctuations in the return current and the Shuttle potential and that these fluctuations are caused by processes involving charge imbalances in the near environment of the Shuttle, possibly in a comoving plasma cloud...|$|E

The experimental results come from the Charge 2 sounding rocket experiment in which the payload was split into two separate sections (mother and daughter) connected with a conducting, insulated tether. In one of the experimental modes, the voltage between the payloads was increased linearly from 0 to 460 V in 2. 5 s. A <b>floating</b> <b>probe</b> array was mounted on the mother with probes located 25, 50, 75, and 100 cm from the rocket surface.

The PDP carried a quasi-static electric field instrument which made differential voltage measurements between two <b>floating</b> <b>probes.</b> At various times during the free flight, an electron beam was ejected from the shuttle. Large differential voltages between the double probes were recorded in association with the electron beam. However, analysis indicates that these large signals are probably not caused by ambient electric fields. Instead, they can be explained by considering three effects: shadowing of the probes from streaming electrons by the PDP chassis, crossing of the PDP wake by the probes, and spatial gradients in the fluxes of energetic electrons reaching the probes. Plasma measurements on the PDP show that energetic electrons exist in a region 20 m wide and up to at least 170 m downstream from the electron beam. At 80 or more meters downstream from the beam, the double probe measurements show that the energetic electron flux is opposite to the injection direction, as would be expected for a secondary returning electron beam produced by scattering of the primary electron beam...|$|R

Attention is given to isolated bubble structures in the upper ionospheric F regions; these observed bubble encounters are divided into two types - type I (live bubbles) and type II (dead bubbles). Type I bubbles show varying degrees of plasma depletion and large upward velocities range up to 1000 km/s. The geometry of these bubbles is such that the spacecraft orbit may cut them where they are tilting either eastward or (more often) westward. Type II bubbles exhibit plasma density depletion but no appreciable upward convection. Both types of events are usually surrounded by a halo of plasma turbulence, which can extend considerably beyond the region of plasma depletion...|$|E

To this end, we employ Luttinger's thermomechanical potential to simulate a sudden change of temperature {{at one end of}} the conductor. We find that the direction of the charge current through an impurity is initially opposite to the direction of the charge current in the steady-state limit. Furthermore, we investigate the transient propagation of energy and particle density driven by a temperature variation through a conducting nanowire. Interestingly, we find that the velocity of the wavefronts of, both, the particle and the energy wave have the same constant value, insensitive to changes in the average electronic density. In the steady-state regime, we find that, at low temperatures, the local temperature and potential, as measured by a <b>floating</b> <b>probe</b> lead, exhibit characteristic oscillations due to quantum interference, with a periodicity that corresponds to half the Fermi wavelength of the electrons.

As the dense neutral gas was released, the return current measured by the langmuir probe changed from positive to negative and a positive potential relative to the spacecraft {{was measured by the}} <b>floating</b> <b>probe.</b> The anomalous return current is believed to be attributable to secondary electron fluxes escaping from the spacecraft, and the unusual charging situation is attributed to the formation of a double-layer structure between a hot plasma cloud localized to the MPD and the spacecraft.

40|$|Direction {{measurements}} of electric fields {{were made in}} the outer magnetosphere during two sudden commencements in 1972. These measurements were observed with the double <b>floating</b> <b>probe</b> experiment carried aboard the IMP 6 satellite. The initial variations of the measured electric field consisted of an increase from a background of about 1 mv/meter to some 10 mv/meter at about 7 rE (earth radi) and to some 4 mv/meter at 3 rE. These initial electric field disturbances were longitudinal, oriented counter clockwise about an axis pointed north. A solution of Maxwell's third equation is derived for these measurements using a quasi-static version of Mead's model of the magnetosphere B (t). This solution seems to describe well the magnitude and direction of the initial perturbation of the electric field vectors observed during these two sudden commencements.

Measurements {{were obtained}} with argon and helium propellants {{for a variety}} of currents and mass flow rates. Anode heat flux was directly measured with thermocouples attached to the inner surface of a hollowed section. Anode falls were determined both from <b>floating</b> <b>probes</b> and through heat flux measurements. Comparison of data acquired through either method shows excellent agreement. Anode falls varied between 4 - 50 V with anode power fractions reaching 70 percent with helium at 150 kW, and 50 percent with argon at 1. 9 MW. The anode fall was found to correlate well with electron Hall parameters calculated from triple Langmuir and magnetic probe data collected near the anode. Two possible explanations for this result are proposed: (1) the establishment of large electric fields at the anode to maintain current conduction across the strong magnetic fields; and (2) anomalous resistivity resulting from the onset of microturbulence in the plasma. To investigate the latter hypothesis, electric field, magnetic field, and current density profiles measured {{in the vicinity of the}} anode were incorporated into Ohm's law to estimate the electrical conductivity. Results of this analysis show a substantial deviation of the measured conductivity from that calculated with classical formulas.
