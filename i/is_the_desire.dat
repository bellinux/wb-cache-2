Energy harvesting is also motivated by a desire {{to address the issue of}} climate change and global warming.|$|E
25|$|Jim Sinclair, {{a leader}} in the movement, argues that autism is {{essential}} to a person, not a disease secondary to the person. Sinclair says that wishing that an autistic person be cured is equivalent to wishing that they disappear and another completely different person exist in their place. Visions for a future where autism has been eradicated, Sinclair believes, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> to end the autistic culture.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that monasteries became secret bastions of icon-support, but this view is controversial. A possible reason for this interpretation <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> in some historiography on Byzantine Iconoclasm to see it as a preface to the later Protestant Reformation in western Europe, in which monastic establishments suffered damage and persecution. In opposition to this view, others have suggested that while some monks continued to support image veneration, many others followed church and imperial policy.|$|E
25|$|One {{possible}} rationale <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> {{to limit}} {{the size of the}} full Unicode character set, where CJK characters as represented by discrete ideograms may approach or exceed 100,000 (while those required for ordinary literacy in any language are probably under 3,000). Version 1 of Unicode was designed to fit into 16 bits and only 20,940 characters (32%) out of the possible 65,536 were reserved for these CJK Unified Ideographs. Later Unicode has been extended to 21 bits allowing many more CJK characters (87,882 are assigned, with room for more).|$|E
25|$|Meno {{proposes that}} virtue <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> for good {{things and the}} power to get them. Socrates points out that this raises a second problem—many people do not {{recognize}} evil. The discussion then turns to the question of accounting for {{the fact that so many}} people are mistaken about good and evil and take one for the other. Socrates asks Meno to consider whether good things must be acquired virtuously in order to be really good. Socrates leads onto the question of whether virtue is one thing or many.|$|E

25|$|For the {{historian}} of the anarchist movement Ronald Creagh, the hippie movement could be considered as the last spectacular resurgence of utopian socialism. For Creagh, a characteristic of this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> for the transformation of society not through political revolution, or through reformist action pushed forward by the state, but {{through the creation of}} a counter-society of a socialist character {{in the midst of the}} current system, which will be made up of ideal communities of a more or less libertarian social form.|$|E
25|$|Socrates asks {{questions}} of Agathon: has {{he referred to}} the object of love, or love itself? Socrates then relates a story he was told by a wise woman called Diotima. According to her, Eros is not a god, but is a spirit that mediates between humans and their objects of desire. Love itself is not wise or beautiful, but <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> for those things. Love is expressed through propagation and reproduction: either physical love or the exchanging and reproducing of ideas. The greatest knowledge, Diotima says, is knowledge of the “form of beauty”, which humans must try to achieve.|$|E
25|$|In early 2010, Brazil and Lamy {{focused on}} the role of the United States in {{overcoming}} the deadlock. President Lula urged Barack Obama to end a trade dispute between Brazil and the US over cotton subsidies after the WTO gave Brazil the formal go-ahead in 2009 to impose sanctions on imports of over 100 US goods. Lamy highlighted the difficulty of obtaining agreement from the US without the presidential fast-track authority and biennial elections. One of the consequences of the economic crisis of 2008–2009 <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> of political leaders to shelter their constituents from the increasingly competitive market experienced during market contractions. Lamy hoped that the drop in trade of 12% in 2009, quoted as the largest annual drop since the Second World War, could be countered by successful conclusion of the Doha round.|$|E

[...] Lust <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> for sexual pleasure alone, outside its intended purpose of procreation and the uniting of man and woman, body and soul, in mutual self-donation.|$|E

Todd graduates as his school's valedictorian and gives a speech about Icarus, saying, [...] "All great achievements arose from dissatisfaction.

500|$|... "Church of Christ" [...] is {{the most}} common name used by this group. In keeping with their non-denominational focus, {{recently}} some congregations have identified themselves primarily as community churches and secondarily as Churches of Christ. A much earlier tradition is to identify a congregation as [...] "the church" [...] at a particular location, with no other description or qualifiers. A primary motivation behind the name <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> to use a scriptural or Biblical name– to identify the church using a name that is found in the New Testament. [...] Adherents are also referred to as Campbellites by academics and other denominations [...] due to their following of the teachings of Alexander Campbell, similar to Lutherans or Calvinists, but the term is sometimes offensive.|$|E
500|$|The {{principal}} {{theme of}} the story <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> by Juno, who is feuding with Aeneas's mother Venus to prevent the marriage of the Trojan Aeneas to Lavinia, daughter of King Latino of Latium. She uses an evil spirit to provoke disharmony between [...] Trojans and Latins; when a Trojan hunting party first wounds a deer and then kills a Latin shepherd, Elminio, there are calls for war, which [...] Latino rejects. Aeneas, resting by the River Tiber, is unaware of these troubling incidents, though he is warned by {{the spirit of the}} river. Danger arrives in the person of Turnus, King of the Rutuli, an ally of the Latins whose love Lavinia has rejected. Spurred on by Turnus's clamour for war, Trojans and Latins fight, and Aeneas kills Turnus. Latino invites Aeneas to take the hand of Lavinia, who is delighted to accept him. In the light of Aeneas's bravery, Juno forgets her former enmity, and joins with Venus and Hymen to bless the marriage. The opera ends with predictions of the greatness of Rome and the distant future glories of Venice.|$|E
500|$|The tragedy Sardanapalus by George Gordon Byron {{published}} in 1821 and produced in 1834 {{is set in}} Assyria, 640 B.C., under King Sardanapalus. The play deals with the revolt against the extravagant king and his relationship to his favourite slave Myrrha. Myrrha made Sardanapalus appear {{at the head of}} his armies, but after winning three successive battles in this way he was eventually defeated. A beaten man, Myrrha persuaded Sardanapalus to place himself on a funeral pyre which she would ignite and subsequently leap onto - burning them both alive. The play has been interpreted as an autobiography, with Sardanapalus as Byron's alter ego, Zarina as Byron's wife Anne Isabella, and Myrrha as his mistress Teresa. At a more abstract level Myrrha <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> for freedom driving those who feel trapped or bound, as well as being the incarnation of Byron's dream of romantic love. Byron knew the story of the mythical Myrrha, if not directly through Ovid's Metamorphoses, then at least through Alfieri's Mirra, which he was familiar with. In her essay [...] "A Problem Few Dare Imitate", Susan J. Wolfson phrases and interprets the relation of the play Sardanapalus and the myth of Myrrha: ...|$|E
