Data collected using a questionnaire distributed among thirty engineers working in the road construction industry in Sri Lanka who represent the engineer and the contractor organizations. A list of 130 factors influencing performance of road construction industry have been identified & included in the questionnaire and all thirty engineers responded and returned the questionnaire. Participants were requested to allocate marks from 1 - 5 (1 -very poor influence; 2 -poor influence; 3 -average influence; 4 -high influence; 5 -very high influence) to each factor according to their knowledge. Factors influencing performance of the road construction contracts have been ranked based on average score initially. Significant factors influencing the performance have been identified using factor analysis and they were: conducting progress review meetings and site inspections at appropriate intervals; previous experience of the construction team working on similar project; effective monitoring and feedback by the construction manager; availability of skilled construction labour; engineer's ability to analyze contractor's claims fair and reasonable manner; making payment for <b>Interim</b> Payment <b>Certificates</b> within reasonable time (2 weeks); quick response by the contractor to employers and engineer's requests and instructions; certification of the <b>Interim</b> Payment <b>Certificates</b> by the engineer within a reasonable time (2 weeks) and timely submission of the <b>Interim</b> Payment <b>Certificates</b> by the contractor...|$|R

40|$|The central goal of {{construction}} stakeholders is to successfully deliver projects to stated objective (s). However, for decades, construction {{projects have been}} plagued by perennial constraints of cost and time overruns, poor quality, and lack of sustainability. The objective {{of this paper is}} to identify and assess the constraints to construction project delivery, and to recommend solutions to enhance project performance. This paper adopted both quantitative and qualitative methods to establish the constraints in the Nigerian construction industry. A pilot survey and literature reviewed revealed a total of fifty (50) construction constraints, which were further classified into eight (8) major groups. Well-structured questionnaires were administered to construction stakeholders (client, consultant and contractor) in Abuja, the federal capital city of Nigeria. Relative Importance Index (RII) was used to analyze the data using Likert scale.   The results suggest that cost/time overrun related factors (inability to reduce project cost), Stakeholders interactive-related factors (inability to establish client value system), Client-related factors (Delay in interim payment and finance problem), and Labor/material-related factors (escalation of material prices and materials quality variability) are the most prevalent constraints in the Nigerian construction environment.   To mitigate the effects of these challenges, it is suggested that a formal innovative approach should be used by stakeholders to address the problems of poor communication, high project cost, and delay. Clients should also take measures to provide adequate funding and should promptly honor <b>interim</b> <b>certificates...</b>|$|R
40|$|The control {{needed in}} the {{management}} of a project was analysed with particular reference to the unique needs of the construction industry within the context of site management. This was explored further by analysing the various problems facing managers within the overall system and determining to what extent the organisation would benefit from an integrated mangement information system. Integration and management of information within the organisational units and the cycles of events that make up the main sub-system was suggested as the means of achieving this objective. A conceptual model of the flow of information was constructed within the whole process of project management by examining the type of information and documents which are generated for the production cycle of a project. This model was analysed with respect to the site managers' needs and the minimum requirements for an overall integrated system. The most tedious and time-consuming task facing the site manager is the determination of weekly production costs, calculation and preparation of <b>interim</b> <b>certificates</b> and valuation of variations occurring during the production stage and finally the settlement and preparation of supplier and sub-contractors' accounts. These areas where microcomputers could be of most help were identified and a number of packages were designed and implemented for various contractors. The gradual integration of stand-alone packages within the whole of the construction industry is a logical sequence to achieve integration of management system. The methods of doing this were analysed together with the resulting advantages and disadvantages...|$|R
40|$|Valuation is {{a process}} of {{determining}} the estimated amount that a contractor is entitled to received for his performance at a particular stage or in a particular period of time under a construction contract. This process is normally carried out by certain professional specified in the contract. Statutorily, the Quantity Surveying Act 1967 authorises registered quantity surveyors to perform this task. At the same time the Act also allows other professionals to do the same if their regulating statutes express them to do the same. Contractually, the construction contracts specify other professionals to carry out this process. The question is, do the statutes that regulate those other professionals authorise them to do the same. The issue is therefore mainly relate to construing the statutory and contractual provisions. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine whether the architects and the engineers as contract administrators have the required statutory authority to do valuation work for interim payment. The scope of this research is confined to the Registration of Engineers Act 1967, Architects Act 1967 and the Quantity Surveyors Act 1967. The methodology used in this research consists of two parts. Part one is essentially reviews the literature on the theoretical and practical aspects of payments in conditions of contracts and statutes. Part two comprehensively analyses the relevant contractual and statutory provisions and the case law extracted from Lexis Nexis. The rules of interpretation are used to interpret the contractual as well as the statutory provisions. The research found that the Quantity Surveyors Act 1967 authorises registered quantity surveyors to perform the valuation work, but at the same time it does not prohibit other professionals to carry out the same task as long their respective statutes expressly provide them with that authority. Although there are express provisions in the Engineers and Architects acts that mention the term ‘valuation’ it cannot be construed as ‘valuation’ for the purpose of preparing interim payments. Therefore, it can be concluded that valuations of contractors work made by architects and engineers for the purpose of <b>interim</b> <b>certificates</b> are not valid...|$|R

40|$|Some {{developed}} countries have drawn lip construction-specific statutory security of payment acts/legislations typically known as Construction Contracts Act to eliminate poor payment practices and to assist continuous uninterrupted construction works. Malaysia too cannot {{pretend not to}} have these problems. This paper presents findings of a study conducted amongst Malaysian contractors with the aims to determine the seriousness of late and non- payment problems; to identify the main causes and effects of late and non-payment; and to identify ways to sustain the payment flows in the Malaysian construction industry. The study focused on contractual payments from the paymaster (government or private) to the contractors. The main factors for late and nonpayment {{in the construction industry}} identified from the study include: delay in certification, paymaster's poor financial management, local culture/attitude, pay master's failure to implement good governance in business, underpayment of certified amounts by the pay master and the use of 'pay when paid' clauses in contracts. The research findings show that late and non-payment can create cash flow problems, stress and financial hardship on the contractors. Amongst the most appropriate solutions to overcome the problem of late and non-payment faced by local contractors include: a right to regular periodic payment, a right to a defined time frame (or payment and a right to a speedy dispute resolution mechanism. Promptness of submitting, processing, issuing <b>interim</b> payment <b>certificates</b> and honouring the certificates are extremely important issues in relation to progress payment claims.

5000|$|On 9 July 1983, the High Peak Coroner, Mr. Clive Rushton, {{opened and}} adjourned the inquest into Susan's death, pending the further police investigation. No {{cause of death}} was officially {{confirmed}} at that stage, and none of Susan's relatives were present. An <b>interim</b> death <b>certificate</b> was granted, however, which allowed formal preparations for her funeral to begin. On July 10, 1983, Derbyshire police undertook a full-scale reconstruction of the day that Susan died, with Detective Constable Brenda Kirby playing the part of Susan. About 45 members of the public returned to the Dale, many of them potholers, hikers and day trippers. Amongst the witnesses was a young couple from North Wales who police thought were amongst the last to see Susan alive, and the running man detectives had originally thought might be a suspect. Detectives with stopwatches and maps monitored the events, so that an accurate timeframe for the events of that day could be created. Vast swathes of the moor were sealed off in an operation that took over four hours. [...] Shortly after the reconstruction, police revealed that a 14-year-old girl had been stalked the same afternoon as Susan died by {{a man who had been}} watching her through binoculars. Fortunately, he had been frightened away. [...] Press reports later described him as a man in his 30s or 40s, so it was decided that he could not have been Susan's killer. On July 12, a local businessman (who had children of his own) put up rewards totalling £2,000 for any information that might help the police investigation, saying that he had been sickened by the deaths of Susan and Diana.|$|R

This study as a first step in a knowledge-based expert system (KBES) modelling of construction cash flow to incorporate risk and uncertainties, identified and assessed the risk factors responsible for the variation in construction cash flow profiles. The study was conducted through a questionnaire survey administered on contracting organisations. Analyses were carried out using mean response and univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results showed that the major risk factors involved in cash flow forecasting relate to changes in the design or specifications, contract conditions pertaining to cash in flow, <b>interim</b> valuations and <b>certificates</b> and construction programming issues such as inclement weather.

Materials/MethodsIndications of MOSFET detectors were recorded from phantom measurements, including: dose values of electron beams, the environmental temperature of the detectors, the incidence direction of an electron beam on the detector, the size of the irradiated field. The change in sensitivity of the detectors when under the effects of accumulated doses was also tested. Because of the very small dimensions of the detectors, they were placed in specially designed aluminium capsules – to ensure electron equilibrium (δ electrons) during the dose measurement. The detector indications were compared to those seen in a Markus type ionization chamber with a calibration <b>certificate.</b> The <b>measurements</b> were made for electron beams with energies of 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21 MeV. ResultsThe following were established experimentally: There is a linear relationship between detector indications and the dose value. A drop in detector sensitivity is associated with increased environmental temperature (as much as 6 % as temperatures rise from 22 °C to 42 °C). There is a non-linear drop in detector sensitivity with accumulated dose. Detector indications are not affected by changes in incident beam angles within the range of – 70 ° to + 70 °. The dependency of detector indications {{on the size of the}} irradiated field conform with those recorded in the ionization chamber, with variations of up to 1. 5 %.

In South Africa and elsewhere, there is a perceived gap between the product the library schools deliver and the needs of the library and information profession. The technikons in South Africa are relative newcomers to the training and education of librarians and information workers. Their task is seen mainly as the training of paraprofessional library workers, since it is the aim of technikons to provide relevant, vocational education and training through co-operation with the relevant industries/professions. The qualification structure of technikons makes provision for different levels of undergraduate qualifications in the form of national certificates, national higher certificates, diplomas and since 1994, technikon degrees. The conventional qualification structure used for library and information science training, does not however make provision for certificate qualifications - technikons at this stage offer only the National Diploma: Library and Information Practice. There is presently no possibility for technikon diplomates to upgrade their paraprofessional qualification to professional level.
