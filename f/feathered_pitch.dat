50|$|The {{engine is}} {{designed}} to operate at a constant speed, no matter the thrust output—a characteristic permitted by the Astafan's use of precise fuel metering and fan blade pitch adjustment. To control the engine, the pilot first sets the speed lever, which adjusts fuel flow {{in proportion to the}} selected engine speed. Then the pilot moves the thrust lever (analogous to a throttle), actuating the fan pitch piston by way of a mechanical linkage and hydraulic valve, and varying the blade pitch. In response, the speed governor holds engine speed steady by adjusting fuel delivery to the combustor. The control system also monitors turbine temperature and adjusts blade pitch (and therefore engine load) to maintain it within the preferred range of 350 °C to 450 °C. Additionally, the system automatically protects against excessive fuel delivery or unusual changes in blade pitch. Using the thrust lever, pilots can start an Astafan in fine pitch (for minimal resistive torque), select takeoff (coarse) <b>pitch,</b> <b>feather</b> the fan, or even reverse the fan pitch in flight (with the fan providing reverse thrust in lieu of conventional reversers).|$|R

To take off, the pilot would start the engine with the flight propeller feathered and the normal carburettor air intake closed and use a clutch to engage the tail propeller and get the aircraft moving through the water. The two hydrofoils, mounted beneath the fuselage on struts just forward of the wings similar {{to the way in which}} floats were mounted on floatplanes, would cause the P.7 to rise out of the water almost immediately. After the aircraft had risen on its hydrofoils and the flight propeller had cleared the water, the pilot would open the carburettor air intake, again employing the clutch to disengage the marine propeller, and use another clutch to engage the flight propeller, which automatically would switch from <b>feathered</b> to flight <b>pitch.</b> Driven by its flight propeller, the aircraft then would engage in a conventional takeoff, riding on its submerged hydrofoils until it reached takeoff speed.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{multi-engined}} aircraft has introduced {{the problem of}} aircraft performance when one or more power units have either become unusable or voluntarily shut down during cruising flight. If {{the use of the}} engine is to be discontinued because of mechanical failure, the desirable procedure is obviously to stop it altogether, so as to prevent possible destruction to the engine. This can be accomplished by locking the propeller, by a free-wheeling arrangement, or by <b>feathering</b> a variable <b>pitch</b> propeller. If the use of the engine is to be discontinued merely to reduce fuel consumption, the propeller may be allowed to turn the engine, in which case the propeller is braked by a torque equal to the friction of the engine. Another recent development connected with braked propellers {{is the fact that the}} variable pitch propeller now offers the possibility of using the large increment in drag at low blade angles of braked and free-wheeling propellers for reduction in landing speed or landing run of clean, highly powered, {{multi-engined aircraft}}. It was the purpose of the present investigation to provide information not already made available by researches listed under the references at the end of this paper. Therefore the following thesis will be concerned chiefly with the three-bladed propeller and its effect on airplane characteristics, the two-bladed propeller being used principally for comparison purposes with other available data. The tests were performed at model scale, but their acceptance as applicable to full scale is supported by the favorable comparisons made in Reference 5. ...|$|R
40|$|THIS {{body of work}} {{details the}} {{development}} of the first at-scale (> 15 cm) robotic samara, or winged seed. The design of prototypes inspired by autorotating plant seed geometries is presented along with a detailed experimental process that elucidates similarities between mechanical and robotic samara flight dynamics. The iterative development process and the implementation of working prototypes are discussed for robotic samara Micro-Air-Vehicles (MAV) that range in size from 7. 5 cm to 27 cm. Vehicle design issues are explored as they relate to autorotation efficiency, stability, flight dynamics and control of single winged rotorcraft. In recent years a new paradigm of highly maneuverable aircraft has emerged that are ideally suited for operation in a confined environment. Different from conven- tional aircraft, viscous forces play a large role in the physics of flight at this scale. This results in relatively poor aerodynamic performance of conventional airfoil and rotorcraft configurations. This deficiency has led to the consideration of naturally occurring geometries and configurations, the simplest of which is the samara. To study the influence of geometric variation on autorotation efficiency, a high speed camera system was used to track the flight path and orientation of the mechan- ical samaras. The wing geometry is planar symmetric and resembles a scaled version of Acer diabolicum Blume. The airfoil resembles a scaled version of the maple seed with a blunt leading edge followed by a thin section without camber. Four mechan- ical samara geometries with equal wing loading were designed and fabricated using a high precision rapid prototyping machine that ensured similarity between models. It was found that {{in order to reduce the}} descent velocity of an autorotating samara the area centroid or maximum chords should be as far from the center of rotation as possible. Flight data revealed large oscillations in feathering and coning angles, and the resultant flight path was found to be dependent on the mean feathering angle. The different flight modalities provided the basis for the design of a control sys- tem for a powered robotic samara that does not require high frequency sensing and actuation typical of micro-scaled rotorcraft. A prototype mechanical samara with a variable wing <b>pitch</b> (<b>feathering)</b> angle was constructed and it was found that active control of the feathering angle allowed the variation of the radius of the helix carved by the samara upon descent. This knowledge was used to design a hovering robotic samara capable of lateral motion through a series of different size circles specified by precise actuation of the feathering angle. To mathematically characterize the flight dynamics of the aircraft, System identi- fication techniques were used. Using flight data, a linear model describing the heave dynamics of two robotic samara vehicles was verified. A visual positioning system was used to collect flight data while the vehicles were piloted in an indoor laboratory. Closed-loop implementation of the derived PID controller was demonstrated using the visual tracking system for position and velocity feedback. An approach to directional control that does not require the once-per-revolution actuation or high-frequency measurement of vehicle orientation has been demon- strated for the first time. Lateral flight is attained through the vehicles differing responses to impulsive and step inputs that are leveraged to create a control strategy that provides full controllability. Flight testing revealed several linear relationships, including turn rate, turn radius and forward speed. The steady turn discussed here has been observed in scaled versions of the robotic samara, therefore the open-loop control demonstrated and analyzed is considered to be appropriate for similar vehicles of reduced size with limited sensing and actuation capabilities...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of big-size wind turbine is constrained to land-base and shallow water nowadays. It is still challenging to build big-size offshore wind turbines in deep water. But challenge means opportunity. This thesis {{aims to examine}} a state-of-art TLP floater initial design for supporting the 10 MW DTU reference wind turbine. The TLP floater consists of one single column, three spokes and three pretension tendons. In the meantime of this project, parallel works (Semi and Spar floaters) are designed. The obtained properties of these three concepts are compared. Fundamentally different from other offshore structures, the TLPWT employs a tension mooring system instead of a catenary mooring system. The pretension per line is 28064 kN and the yield tendon axial force is 1. 8 * 10 ^ 5 kN. Due to the stiffed tendons, the TLPWT has small response motions. Therefore, the tendon tensions are almost constant even in 50 -year extreme conditions. Additionally, the maximum tension 1 and minimum tension 3 are examined by ULS, which {{results show that the}} TLPWT tendons have no possibility of slacking or exceeding yields tension. On the other hand, the response motions of the SemiWT and SparWT are relatively larger. The SparWT can experience maximum surge motion up to 25 m and SemiWT can experience maximum pitch motion 16 deg at wind speed 11. 4 m/s. The hydrodynamic behaviours of the TLPWT are assessed in details by performing a wave-only frequency-domain analysis in head sea. The added mass and damping coefficients present strong wave-frequency dependence. The viscous damping effect is of importance in the surge motion of the TLPWT in long waves. In order to compute correct second-order results within the element number limit, a mesh convergence study is performed regarding to the mesh size and radius of the second-order free surface model. Mesh case 3 is selected after a series of comparisons. As the second-order forces are small, their most important contribution is in the vicinity of resonance. For instance, the resonance of heave QTF coincides with the pitch/bending natural frequency. The natural periods of the TLPWT are 45. 23 s, 0. 55 s, 0. 60 s and 20. 87 s in surge/sway, heave, pitch/roll and yaw respectively. It is very soft in horizontal motions, but quite stiff in vertical motions due to stiffed tendon mooring system. On the contrary, the SemiWT and SparWT concept are soft in both horizontal and vertical planes. Furthermore, {{it should be noted that}} the flexibility of the tower has a significant contribution to the TLPWT pitch motion. The tower bending natural period is 3. 49 s. The rated wind speed for the three concepts is 11. 4 m/s. The wind turbine controller plays a vital role during operation process to maximize the energy capture, and minimize the external loads and thus response motions. In critical weather conditions, the controller can <b>pitch,</b> <b>feather</b> or even shutdown the turbine. Consequently, the platform motions become less, but the rotor speed, generated torque and produced power still keep constant. The TLPWT experiences wave frequency motions of the same order of magnitude as those of SemiWT and SparWT in horizontal plane. In the vertical plane, however, the TLPWT behaves like a fixed structure. In addition, the heave motion and pitch motion of the TLPWT are kinematically coupled with its surge motion. Usually the low-frequency TLPWT motions are primarily excited by wind, while its pitch motion, blade root bending moment, tower base bending moment and tensions are excited by incoming wave frequency. Nevertheless, in harsh weather, the turbine is shutdown and all the performances of the TLPWT are therefore dominated by wave frequency. In summary, the global performance behaviour of the TLPWT is desirable for a structure this size. The tension-leg mooring system suppresses nearly all vertical motions. The horizontal motion is quite small even in extreme weather conditions and thus there is rare change representing in tensions. Furthermore, the tower base and blade root bending moment are also much smaller than the Semi and Spar wind turbine. This TLPWT concept features with wide weather window, great load capacity and high stability. It is definitely reliable for the {{application of}} offshore wind turbines in deep water...|$|R
