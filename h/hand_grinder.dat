30|$|Before the {{application}} of the CFRP sheets, the surfaces of the beams were prepared. A <b>hand</b> <b>grinder</b> was used to round off the corners of all the beams, and the bottom and longitudinal sides of the beams were sand blasted to create an ideal bonding surface for the CFRP sheets. Three areas in each beam were strengthened. These consisted of a strengthened portion beginning at 228 mm (9 in.) from the left end of the beam and continuing for 1, 067 mm (3.5 ft), followed by a 1, 067 -mm (3.5 ft) unstrengthened portion, another 1, 067 -mm (3.5 ft) strengthened portion, followed by a 152 -mm (6 in.) unstrengthened portion, and finally a 1, 067 -mm (3.5 ft) strengthened portion with a 228 -mm (9 in.) unstrengthened portion at the right end of the beam.|$|E
40|$|Automation of {{grinding}} of metalcastings {{is desirable}} for many reasons. The major reasons are dangerous working conditions, low productivity, and inconsistency in human operations. As {{an approach to}} the automating grinding process, a gantry-driven grinding machine is proposed to manipulate an industrial <b>hand</b> <b>grinder</b> and control the grinding force applied to the work piece. To increase the material removal rate of the grinding machine, a grinding force control method is brought forward. This method suggests that the normal grinding force should be controlled to a desired constant value. A double closed-loop grinding force control system is designed to perform the grinding force control. This thesis develops the models of the servo system and the grinding process. Based on these models, a force controller is designed with the ability of tracking the desired force set point. The proposed closed-loop grinding force control system is verified by simulation...|$|E
40|$|One of {{approaches}} to protect devices from unpleasant vibrating disturbances is by employing a vibration absorber. This paper explores {{the viability of}} polysiloxane as raw material, added with rice husk silica fillers to produce a vibration absorbent sheet. The polysiloxane reinforced with rice husk sheets were made using hot compression moulding technique. The samples were tested for its density and tensile tests according to related standards. As for vibration test, a portable <b>hand</b> <b>grinder</b> was used to estimate the vibration exposure experienced by the users. The polysiloxane sheets were strapped on the tool’s handle and the vibration exposure was measured. The result shows that by applying the polysiloxane sheets on the tool grinder reduces the vibration magnitude by a maximum value of 38 percents. The longest vibration time exposure was recorded for 6. 42 hours, improved by 150 percents from the original vibration time exposure of 2. 52 hours. The results also demonstrated that polysiloxane with 4 wt. % rice husk silica was the optimum combination for vibration application since it produced highest vibration magnitude reduction and longest vibration exposure time of grinder applications...|$|E
40|$|The {{triangular}} force/position {{control scheme}} for robot manipulators {{is described in}} this paper, together with its application to a deburring task. The triangular control allows an easy design of a force control loop closed around the inner position loops. It is shown that, in case of stiff contact, no disturbance to the motion control system is generated by the force controller. However, no information on the dynamic model of the manipulator is required, while the prominent dynamic effect of the joint elasticity is accounted for through {{the knowledge of the}} joint stiffnesses. The performance of the triangular control is assessed in a particularly challenging application, i. e. the deburring of light alloy wheels. In the paper it is shown, through several experimental results, that the control system is able to succesfully follow the free formed 3 D geometry of the contour, while approximately keeping a prescribed contact force, but also that the large force disturbance generated by <b>hand</b> <b>grinders</b> lead to severe loss of performance...|$|R
40|$|My diploma work is {{focusing}} on the health problems of selected factors in the working enviroment of grinding the metal castings. There are high-risk factors, which are harmful to worker´s health, especially physical stress, noise, dust and vibrations, which are passed on hands. The employer is under the obligation to take precautions to carry on worker´s health, in consideration of exceed the health limits. The aim of this diploma work was setting the efficiency of precautions to health protection in work enviroment. The situation had been monitoring in a company in the South Bohemia over ten years. There were used results of factor´s precautions (noise, dust, vibrations) in work enviroment, where workers grind the metal castings by <b>hand</b> <b>grinders.</b> The monitoring ensemble was created by employess in a company, which makes the metal castings by <b>hand</b> <b>grinders</b> in its work enviroment. To data collecting were used the following methods: non-aligned observation, conversation with {{the chief of the}} company, studying of positive law and technical literature incl. test codes of the health institute (department Ceske Budejovice). The data of the test codes were processed by the secundary analysis and summarized to tables and graphs. Within qualitative analysis I determinated four research questions, which were answered gradually in my work: 1) Which precautions are carry out by employers to particular factors of employee´s health protection? 2) What is the factor´ s efficiency? 3) What impact do the precautions have on results of factor´s measuring? 4) Which precautions can I recommend {{on the grounds of the}} evalutation of the work enviroment? Both means of collective and individual protection belong to the precautions of worker´s health protection today. The technical, technologiacal and organisational precautions are included to collective protections. The individual precautions are focusing especially on employees and offer the substitute solutions. All precautions are specific to individual factors. I found out, that all precautions, which are used by the employers in work enviroment of metal casting, are effective. Especially we can talk about the precautions to protection of employee´s health against excessive dust (instalation of air ventilation with strong effect), which caused the exceed of dust concetration in work enviroment of grinding. Finally I can say, that this branch of metal casting has been connecting with certain high-risk factors all the time. Although all the protective precautions has been realized, the health limits given for noise, vibrations passed on hands and dust are still exceed. For this reason it´s very important to regularly inform the workers of high-risk factors, which they could meet in their work enviroment of cast grinding...|$|R

30|$|The entire {{repair process}} took {{approximately}} 30 man-hours over {{three days and}} involved the following seven steps: (1) straightening the column; (2) removing loose concrete; (3) placing repair mortar; (4) preparing the column surface; (5) installing longitudinal and transverse CFRP; (6) arranging instrumentation; and (7) retesting repaired columns. The axial load was not applied during the repair procedure considering that shoring systems {{can be used to}} support the self-weight of the superstructure in practice during the repair. Straightening of the column was challenging and time-consuming due to limited equipment available in the lab; therefore the time for straightening {{was not included in the}} three-day period here. On the first day, the damaged loose concrete was removed and formwork erected, then quickset mortar was placed. The mortar was allowed to set approximately 12  h before the formwork was removed on the second day. Then the column surface was prepared for installation of the CFRP system. The surface was smoothed and corners were rounded with a <b>hand</b> <b>grinder,</b> and then putty and primer were applied. The longitudinal CFRP was applied, followed by transverse CFRP. The transverse CFRP was applied after the longitudinal CFRP to help preventing the debonding of the longitudinal CFRP from the host concrete. For the longitudinal CFRP, fibers were aligned along the longitudinal axis of the column. For the transverse CFRP, fibers were oriented transverse to the longitudinal axis of the column. Detailing of the CFRP systems is discussed in a subsequent section. No special technique was used to cure the CFRP system except for Columns 1 and 2 in which a plastic sheet and a small heater were used to facilitate curing because the temperature in the laboratory was unusually low. Cracks on the concrete surface outside the region with CFRP were not repaired. An unexpected delay occurred during the repair of Column 1, which resulted in testing on the 5 th day.|$|E

His German Mills American Oatmeal Company was the nation's first commercial oatmeal manufacturer. He marketed the product locally as a substitute for breakfast pork. Improved production technology (steel cutters, porcelain rollers, improved hullers), combined with an influx of German and Irish immigrants, quickly boosted sales and profits. In 1877, Schumacher adopted the Quaker symbol, the first registered trademark for a breakfast cereal. The acceptance of [...] "horse food" [...] for human consumption encouraged other entrepreneurs to enter the industry. Henry Parsons Crowell started operations in 1882, and John Robert Stuart in 1885. [...] Crowell cut costs by consolidating every step of the processing—grading, cleaning, hulling, cutting, rolling, packaging, and shipping—in one factory operating at Ravenna, Ohio. Stuart operated mills in Chicago and Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Stuart and Crowell combined in 1885 and initiated a price war. After a fire at his mill in Akron, Schumacher joined Stuart and Crowell to form the Consolidated Oatmeal Company.|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Although {{meat grinder}} {{injury to the}} hand is not a common case, it causes a wide {{spectrum}} of injuries that result not only in tremendous physical and emotional pain but also substantial economic impact as well. Case presentation. Three cases of hand injury caused by meat grinders are presented. Two injuries involved non dominant hand and one involved dominant hand, result in varying degrees of deformity. All patients arrived in emergency room with injured hand still firmly wedged in a meat grinder. Conclusions. Although these injuries continue to prove very mutilating, maximum restoration of the injured hand can be accomplished by careful extrication, followed by preservation and reconstruction of all viable tissues. Perioperative antibiotics and wound irrigation with antibiotic solution are recommended. Microsurgical technique can be performed in treating these injuries.

40|$|Abstract. Many of {{the studies}} in the {{biomechanics}} {{of the human body}} made globally focused primarily on hand-arm. This segment of the human body is considered a "access gateway " of vibrations {{to other parts of the}} body or to internal organs. A long-term exposure to these mechanical vibration (caused by vibrating <b>hand</b> equipment: drill, <b>grinder,</b> etc.) affects the soft tissues and may lead to a dangerous syndrome, that is particularly vibration white finger (VWF), which is narrowing of blood vessels, a phenomenon that in time and left untreated can even cause gangrene. This article focuses on a dynamic model with three degrees of freedom of the human finger. Some dynamic characteristics, such as centre of gravity, stiffness and damping, using both a rigid body structure system and computer simulations, can be determined after measuring the vibrations...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES - To {{estimate}} {{the number of}} workers in Great Britain with significant occupational exposure to hand transmitted vibration (HTV). Also, to identify the occupations and industries where such exposures arise, and the main sources of exposure. METHODS - A questionnaire was posted to 22 194 men and women aged 16 - 64, comprising 21 201 subjects selected at random from the age-sex registers of 34 general practices in England, Scotland, and Wales, and a further 993 subjects selected at random from the central pay registers of the three armed services. Among other things, the questionnaire asked about exposure to sources of HTV in current and earlier employment. Responses were assessed by occupation and industry, and prevalence estimates for {{the country as a whole}} were derived from census information on occupational and industrial populations nationally. Estimates were also made in exposed workers of the average daily dose of vibration (A(8) root mean squared (rms) for the past week, based on their reported sources and durations of exposure. RESULTS - Usable questionnaires were returned by 12 907 subjects (overall response rate 58 %). From these it was estimated that some 4. 2 million men and 667 000 women in Great Britain are exposed to HTV at work in a 1 week period, and that personal daily exposures to vibration exceed a suggested action level equivalent to 2. 8 ms- 2 for 8 hours (A(8) > 2. 8 ms- 2 rms) in at least 1. 2 million men and 44 000 women. High estimated doses (A(8) > 5 ms- 2 rms) arose most often in bricklayers and masons, gardeners and groundsmen, carpenters and joiners, electricians and electrical maintenance fitters, and builders and building contractors. The industries where high A(8) values most often arose were construction, motor vehicle repair and maintenance, manufacture of basic metals, and agriculture. The most common sources of exposure were hammer drills, <b>hand</b> held portable <b>grinders,</b> and jigsaws. CONCLUSIONS - Exposure to HTV is surprisingly prevalent, and preventive measures and health surveillance may be warranted for many men in Britain. Control strategies should focus on prevention at source, with priority accorded to the common sources of exposure and the occupations in which significant exposures tend to arise. Many vibratory tools that are common in Britain have been overlooked in previous surveys, highlighting an important focus for future research...|$|R
6000|$|His {{father was}} one of the bravest, most upright, most patient, most {{sensible}} of men. Diderot never ceased to regret that the old man's portrait had not been taken with his apron on, his spectacles pushed up, and a <b>hand</b> on the <b>grinder's</b> wheel. After his death, none of his neighbours could speak of him to his son without tears in their eyes. Diderot, wild and irregular as were his earlier days, had always a true affection for his father. [...] "One of the sweetest moments of my life," [...] he once said, [...] "was more than thirty years ago, and I remember {{it as if it were}} yesterday, when my father saw me coming home from school, my arms laden with the prizes I had carried off, and my shoulders burdened with the wreaths they had given me, which were too big for my brow and had slipped over my head. As soon as he caught sight of me some way off, he threw down his work, hurried to the door to meet me, and fell a-weeping. It is a fine sight--a grave and sterling man melted to tears."[1] Of his mother we know less. He had a sister, who seems to have possessed the rough material of his own qualities. He describes her as [...] "lively, active, cheerful, decided, prompt to take offence, slow to come round again, without much care for present or future, never willing to be imposed on by people or circumstance; free in her ways, still more free in her talk; she is a sort of Diogenes in petticoats.... She is the most original and the most strongly-marked creature I know; she is goodness itself, but with a peculiar physiognomy."[2] His only brother showed some of the same native stuff, but of thinner and sourer quality. He became an abbé and a saint, peevish, umbrageous, and as excessively devout as his more famous brother was excessively the opposite. [...] "He would have been a good friend and a good brother," [...] wrote Diderot, [...] "if religion had not bidden him trample under foot such poor weaknesses as these. He is a good Christian, who proves to me every minute of the day how much better it would be to be a good man. He shows that what they call evangelical perfection is only the mischievous art of stifling nature, which would most likely have spoken as lustily in him as in me."[3] ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1966 There {{were two}} studies {{involved}} in the thesis research. In the first study, variation {{in the amount of}} adenohypophysis gonadotropins among 22 individual beef bulls were investigated. These bulls represented four inbred lines, and six linecrosses. The bulls were raised in the Oregon State University purebred herd. The bulls were slaughtered at approximately 1000 pounds live weight. The pituitaries were removed, weighed, individually identified, sealed in glass vials, and frozen at - 20 °C. until needed for bioassay. Assay material was prepared by dissecting the anterior lobe from the other pituitary material and then crushing the adenohypophysis in a <b>hand</b> operated tissue <b>grinder.</b> Immature male and female mice were used to assay for gonadotropic potency. T-test values showed all bull pituitaries to contain a significant amont of both follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone when the pituitary-treated mice were compared with control mice. When the Hereford inbred lines of cattle were compared with one another {{no significant differences were found}} for gonadotropic potency. However, when the inbred Angus line was compared with each of the inbred Hereford lines, one of the inbred Hereford lines had significantly greater luteinizing hormone activity than the inbred Angus, and another inbred Hereford line had a significantly greater amount of follicle stimulating hormone activity than the inbred Angus. One of the linecrosses had significantly greater luteinizing hormone potency than all four inbred lines, and a different linecross had a significantly greater amount of follicle stimulating hormone potency than three of the four inbred lines. However, one inbred Hereford line had a significantly greater amount of luteinizing hormone than two of the Hereford linecrosses. A comparison of linecrosses showed many significant variations in one or the other gonadotropic potency. It was noted that wherever a significant difference existed, the greater potency for one or the other gonadotropin favored the linecross that had either a sire or dam of inbred Lionheart parentage. In the second study, effects of x-irradiation delivered at rates of 0, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, and 5000 r. to excised beef cattle, sheep, and rabbit pituitaries and their subsequent in vitro gonadotropic potency were investigated by use of grass frog ovarian fragments. The pituitary material was added to test tubes at levels of 150, 125, 100, 75, 50, 25, 10, 5, and 1 mg. per test tube. A modified (calcium free) Holtfreter solution was added to each test tube bringing the total volume to 10 ml. in each test tube. A grass frog ovarian fragment was placed in the incubation medium for 48 hours. Following incubation the number of released eggs were recorded. Origin of the ovarian fragments were identified as to ovary and position. Ovulation percentage was affected by the mammalian species from which the pituitaries came, the level of irradiation, and the amount of pituitary added to each culturing test tube. One hundred twenty-five mg. of non-irradiated sheep pituitary was able to induce a very slight amount of frog ovulation. However, sheep pituitary which received 2000 r. induced a much better ovulation percentage with 75 and 100 mg. pituitary material. When the beef cattle pituitary was delivered 1000 r. the ovulation rate remained slight, but ovulation occurred at the 100, 125, and 150 mg. levels. Irradiation levels greater than 2000 r. compared with the 2000 r. level had a depressing effect on ovulation rate. When comparing all rates of irradiation and all levels of rabbit pituitary, 25 mg. of rabbit pituitary which had received 3000 r. appeared best. At this point 40. 3 percent ovulation occurred. An analysis of variance was run for all three mammalian species for the radiation rate, the pituitary level, ovary location of the frog, and position of the frog ovarian fragment. The analysis of variance showed that results are not influenced by either of the two ovaries nor by the position of the fragments. The results are significantly affected by the level of pituitary used and the amount of irradiation delivered to the mammalian pituitary...|$|R
