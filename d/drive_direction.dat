40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study directional stability during reversing of rear-wheel drive, electric powered wheelchairs (EPW) under different initial front caster orientations. Specifically, the weight distribution differences caused by certain initial caster orientations were examined as a possible mechanism for causing directional instability that could lead to accidents. Directional stability was quantified by measuring the <b>drive</b> <b>direction</b> error of the EPW by a motion analysis system. The ground reaction forces were collected to determine the load on the front casters, as well as back-emf data to attain the speed of the motors. The <b>drive</b> <b>direction</b> error was found to be different for various initial caster orientations. <b>Drive</b> <b>direction</b> error was greatest when both casters were oriented 90 degrees to the left or right, and least when both casters were oriented forward. The results show that <b>drive</b> <b>direction</b> error corresponds to the loading difference on the casters. The data indicates that loading differences may cause asymmetric drag on the casters, which in turn causes unbalanced torque load on the motors. This leads to a difference in motor speed and <b>drive</b> <b>direction</b> error...|$|E

The source of this difference lies in the natural up-down asymmetry of the antenna`s radiated power spectrum caused by Hall currents.

The rigid mass is coupled to two orthogonal electrodes in the drive and sense directions, which are attached to the rotating base. The microbeam is driven by an AC voltage in the <b>drive</b> <b>direction,</b> which induces vibrations in the orthogonal sense direction due to rotation about the microbeam axis. The electrode placed in the sense direction is used to measure the induced motions and extract the underlying angular speed.

We study the heat generated by driving a small system and change the drive parameters to analyse {{the transition from a}} drive leaving the system close to equilibrium to driving it far from equilibrium. Our system is a quantum dot in a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure hosting a two-dimensional electron gas. The dot is tunnel-coupled to one part of the two-dimensional electron gas acting as a heat and particle reservoir. We use standard rate equations to model the driven dot-reservoir system and find excellent agreement with the experiment. Additionally, we quantify the fluctuations by experimentally test the theoretical concept of the arrow of time, predicting our ability to distinguish whether a process goes in the forward or backward <b>drive</b> <b>direction...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} novel gimbal-type {{torsional}} z-axis micromachined gyroscope with a non-resonant actua-tion scheme. The design concept {{is based on}} employing a 2 degrees-of-freedom (2 -DOF) drive-mode oscillator to achieve dynamical amplification of oscillations, and a flat region in the frequency response. By utilizing dy-namic amplification of torsional oscillations in the drive-mode instead of resonance, large oscillation amplitudes of the sensing element is achieved with small actuation amplitudes, providing improved linearity and stability despite parallel-plate actuation. With the flat region in the frequency response, the <b>drive</b> <b>direction</b> amplitude and phase are inherently constant within the same fre-quency band, while the device operates at resonance in the sense direction for improved sensitivity. Thus, the design concept is expected to overcome the small ac-tuation and sensing capacitance limitation of surface-micromachined gyroscopes, while achieving improved excitation stability and robustness against fabrication imperfections and fluctuations in operation conditions...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} novel gimbal-type {{torsional}} micromachined gyroscope with a non-resonant actuation scheme. The design concept {{is based on}} employing a 2 degrees-of-freedom (2 -DOF) drive-mode oscillator comprising a sensing plate suspended inside two gimbals. By utilizing dynamic amplification of torsional oscillations in the drive mode instead of resonance, large oscillation amplitudes of the sensing element are achieved with small actuation amplitudes, providing improved linearity and stability despite parallel-plate actuation. The device operates at resonance in the sense direction for improved sensitivity, while the <b>drive</b> <b>direction</b> amplitude is inherently constant within the same frequency band. Thus, the necessity to match drive and sense resonance modes is eliminated, leading to improved robustness against structural and thermal parameter fluctuations.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} application of a lever coupling mechanism to improve the shock resistance of a dual-mass silicon micro-gyroscope with drive mode coupled along the driving direction without sacrificing the mechanical sensitivity. Firstly, the mechanical sensitivity and the shock response of the micro-gyroscope are theoretically analyzed. In the mechanical design, a novel lever coupling mechanism is proposed to change the modal order and to improve the frequency separation. The micro-gyroscope with the lever coupling mechanism optimizes the drive mode order, increasing the in-phase mode frequency to be {{much larger than the}} anti-phase one. Shock analysis results show that the micro-gyroscope structure with the designed lever coupling mechanism can notably reduce the magnitudes of the shock response and cut down the stress produced in the shock process compared with the traditional elastic coupled one. Simulations reveal that the shock resistance along the <b>drive</b> <b>direction</b> is greatly increased. Consequently, the lever coupling mechanism can change the gyroscope’s modal order and improve the frequency separation by structurally offering a higher stiffness difference ratio. The shock resistance along the driving direction is tremendously enhanced without loss of the mechanical sensitivity...|$|E
