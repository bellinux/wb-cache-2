50|$|<b>Etoxadrol</b> (along with ketamine, dexoxadrol, {{and other}} PCP-like drugs) is an anticonvulsant, {{preventing}} tonic seizures in mice that are administered pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), which normally induces seizures.|$|E
50|$|<b>Etoxadrol</b> is a non-competitive NMDA {{receptor}} antagonist. It binds irreversibly {{and with}} high affinity to the PCP binding {{site on the}} NMDA receptor (Ki = 107 nM, determined by the displacement of radiolabeled TCP). Normally, the inactivated NMDA receptor possesses a magnesium (Mg2+) block in the channel, blocking the passage of cations. When the neurotransmitter glutamate binds to the NMDA receptor, and the postsynaptic cell membrane is depolarized (from the postsynaptic cell being activated), the magnesium block in the NMDA receptor channel is displaced. Calcium (Ca2+) and sodium (Na+) can enter the cell via the open channel, while potassium (K+) can exit the cell. <b>Etoxadrol</b> antagonizes the NMDA receptor by binding to the PCP site, located just above the magnesium block in the ion channel. In {{the event that the}} magnesium block is displaced, <b>etoxadrol</b> blocks the NMDA receptor channel, preventing cations from entering or exiting the channel.

40|$|NMDA receptors are glutamate-gated cation {{channels}} {{with high}} calcium permeability that play {{important roles in}} {{many aspects of the}} biology of higher organisms. They are critical {{for the development of the}} central nervous system (CNS), generation of rhythms for breathing and locomotion, and the processes underlying learning, memory, and neuroplasticity. Therefore, NMDA receptors are important therapeutic targets for many CNS disorders [1]. To date, clinically drugs targeting the PCP binding site of NMDA receptors have had only limited success due to poor efficacy and unacceptable side effects, including hallucinations, catatonia, ataxia, nightmares, and memory deficits [2]. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the piperidine ring of the potent PCP antagonists dexoxadrol and <b>etoxadrol</b> are not necessary for high NMDA receptor affinity since its replacement with aminomethyl or methylaminomethyl chains led to potent NMDA receptor antagonists [3]. Ring and side chain homologues of aminomethyl analogues of dexoxadrol and <b>etoxadrol</b> resulted in compounds showing high NMDA receptor affinity. The derivative 1 behaved as the most potent NMDA antagonist with an affinity value similar to those of dexoxadrol and <b>etoxadrol,</b> [3]. In the present work a series of regioisomers of 1, bearing the 1, 4 -dioxane nucleus, were prepared. The biological profiles of the novel compounds were assessed using binding assays at PCP binding site of the NMDA receptor. The functional activity of the most affine compounds 2 - 4 was investigated on L(tk-) -cells stably expressing the NMDA receptor subunits GluN 1 a and GluN 2 A by inhibition of the citotoxicity induced by the activation of NMDA receptors with (S) -glutamate and glycine. Compound 3, showing binding affinity and functional activity not significantly different from those of (S) -(+) -ketamine, displayed a promising therapeutic potential.

40|$|Phencyclidine (PCP) {{belongs to}} a class of drugs with a unique and {{characteristic}} spectra of pharmacological activity. PCP has recently become a major drug of abuse. Structural analogues of PCP have also been reported in street use. The following experiments explore the behavioral pharmacology of PCP and several compounds with PCP-like activity. In Experiment I the effects of PCP were compared to three structural analogues in rhesus monkeys trained to lever press on a fixed-interval 5 min schedule of food presentation. Dose-response curves and potency estimates were determined for PCP, N-ethyl- 1 -phenylcyclohexylamine (PCE), 1 -(1 -(2 -thienyl) cyclohexyl) piperidine (TCP) and ketamine. The effects of all four drugs on response rates were dependent on the baseline rate of responding. High doses of all four drugs decreased overall response rates. Onset and duration of drug effects were also determined and compared. In Experiments II through VI the drug discrimination paradigm was used. Animals were trained to discriminate PCP (rats, 3. 0 mg/kg i. p.; monkeys, 0. 16 mg/kg i. m.) from saline in a two-lever drug discrimination task on a fixed-ratio 32 (FR 32) schedule of food presentation. After reliable discrimination control of lever choice was established, generalization tests were conducted every third day. Test periods consisted of a 2 -min period during which responding on either lever was reinforced (rats) or responding was recorded but not reinforced (monkeys). The PCP dose-response determination preceded generalization testing with other compounds. Dose-effect curves for each drug for percent drug-lever appropriate responding and for suppression of operant responding during sessions were analyzed by linear regression. In Experiment II the discriminative stimulus properties of PCP and five other arylcycloalkylamines were investigated in squirrel monkeys. Generalization testing was conducted with PCP, PCE, TCP, 1 -(1 -phenylcyclohexyl) morpholine (PCM), 1 -(1 -phenylcyclohexyl) pyrroldine (PHP), and ketamine. All drugs produced dose-dependent PCP-appropriate responding. The dose necessary to suppress operant responding to fifty percent of vehicle rates was 3 to 8 {{times larger than the}} ED 50 for drug-lever appropriate responding. Experiments III, IV and VI were designed to explore similarities between the discriminative stimulus properties of PCP and a series of structurally dissimilar compounds. In Experiment III the discriminative stimulus properties of dexoxadrol and <b>etoxadrol,</b> both 2 -(2, 2 -substituted 1, 3 dioxolan- 4 -yl) piperdines, were studied in squirrel monkeys. Both compounds generalized to PCP in a dose-dependent manner. The dose necessary to suppress operant responding to fifty percent of vehicle rates was 3 to 8 times larger than the ED 5 O dose · for drug-lever appropriate responding. In Experiment IV the discriminative stimulus properties of stereoisomers of N-allylnormetazocine, a benzomorphan opioid with psychotomimetic properties, were investigated in squirrel monkeys and rats. In both species, the (+) isomer and the racemic mixture produced dose dependent PCP-appropriate responding. The (-) isomer did not produce PCP-appropriate responding, however it was more potent than the (+) isomer in overall response rate suppression. High doses of naloxone (rats, 30 mg/kg;monkeys, 1. 0 and 3. 0 mg/kg) did not block the drug lever appropriate responding or response rate suppression produced by either isomer of N -allynormetazocine. In Experiment V the discriminative stimulus properties of ketamine stereoisomers were investigated in rats. Both isomers and the racemic form of ketamine produced drug-lever appropriate responding and decreased response rate in a dose-dependent manner. There was no significant potency difference between (±) -ketamine and either of the isomers for either of these measures. The stereoselectivity of the discriminative stimulus properties of cyclazocine, another opioid of the benzomorphan series, in squirrel monkeys was explored in Experiment VI. The (+) isomer produced dose dependent PCP-appropriate responding. The (-) isomer and the racemic mixture did not produce PCP-appropriate responding at any of the doses tested. The (-) isomer was 300 times more potent than the (+) isomer in overall response rate suppression. The work presented in this thesis suggests that PCP {{belongs to a}} unique class of drugs which can have a wide variety of chemical structures. The overalp in the behavioral pharmacology of PCP and the psychotomimetic opioids of the benzomorphan series is probably due to the activity of the (+) isomers of these compounds...|$|E
40|$|A {{strategy}} {{that can lead}} to the discovery of novel biologically active compounds, and over the last 20 years has emerged as a fruitful approach, is the identification and use of molecular scaffolds with versatile binding properties. For such structures, bearing appropriate molecular decoration and, therefore, able to recognize with high affinity more unrelated targets, the term “privileged structure” has been proposed. The 1, 4 -dioxane nucleus is a versatile scaffold to obtain drugs directed to mAChRs, α 1 -ARs, and 5 -HT 1 A receptors. The aim of this PhD thesis was to extend the previous structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies about ligands interacting with the above receptors and to investigate the possibility to address novel ligands toward other receptor systems. In particular, it has been confirmed that the properly substituted 1, 4 -dioxane nucleus is a suitable scaffold for: • potent muscarinic receptor (mAChRs) agonists and antagonists; • selective α 1 d-adrenoreceptor (α 1 d-ARs) antagonists; • potent 5 -HT 1 A serotoninergic receptor full agonists. Moreover, it {{has proven to be a}} versatile scaffold to obtain: • selective α 2 A-adrenoreceptor (α 2 A-ARs) antagonists/I 2 imidazoline binding site (I 2 -IBS) ligands; • blockers of the PCP binding site of NMDA receptor; • selective σ 1 or σ 2 ligands; • dopamine D 2 -like receptor ligands. A series of mAChRs agonists, obtained by moving the methyl substituent in position 6 of the 1, 4 -dioxane of the potent M 2 /M 3 agonist cis-N,N,N-trimethyl-(6 -methyl- 1, 4 -dioxan- 2 - yl) methanaminium iodide to position 2 or 3, was prepared to complete a previous SAR study. To verify whether the methyl group in position 6 of 1, 4 -dioxane was essential for its potent mAChR activity, its desmethyl analogue was also prepared and pharmacologically characterized. To rationalize the experimental observations and to get information about the mode of interaction of the already published and novel 1, 4 -dioxane agonists, a retrospective computational study was performed. Afterwards, docking studies, using the recently published crystal structures of human M 2 and rat M 3 receptors were conducted to investigate relationships between the biological behaviour of 1, 4 -dioxane compounds and 1, 3 -dioxolane analogues and their functional groups involved in the interaction with these protein receptors. Moreover, the modulation of the pharmacological profile from agonist to antagonist was successfully obtained by replacing the methyl group in position 6 of the 1, 4 -dioxane scaffold of the potent M 2 /M 3 mAChR agonist cis-N,N,N-trimethyl-(6 -methyl- 1, 4 -dioxan- 2 -yl) methanaminium iodide with bulkier groups. In particular, the 6, 6 -diphenyl substitution provided a selective M 3 antagonist, whose racemic form and its (S) eutomer proved to be effective in reducing the volume-induced contractions of rat urinary bladder and were devoid of cardiovascular effects in an in vivo study. It is well known that the benzodioxane nucleus bearing an appropriate substituent at position 2 can discriminate markedly among α-AR subtypes. Indeed, Idazoxan and WB 4101, both carrying a 1, 4 -benzodioxan- 2 -yl moiety as a basic feature but a different 2 -substituent [imidazoline or (2, 6 - dimethoxyphenoxy) ethylamine], are highly selective for α 2 - and α 1 -ARs, respectively. To investigate the possibility that the quite planar 1, 4 -benzodioxane privileged structure of Idazoxan and WB 4101 might be replaced by the less conformationally constrained 1, 4 -dioxane ring, two series of ligands were prepared and pharmacologically characterized. With the Idazoxan-related analogues, we demonstrated that α 2 A-AR antagonism might favourably contribute to I 2 -IBSmediated morphine analgesia enhancement. Therefore, the most interesting compound and its eutomer, which showed such a biological profile and lacked sedative and hypotensive side effects due to their selective α 2 A-AR antagonism, might be novel promising tools therapeutically useful in pain management in combination with opioids. WB 4101 -related analogues allowed us to demonstrate that 5 -HT 1 A receptor and α 1 -AR binding sites recognized by the 1, 4 -dioxane compounds display reversed stereochemical requirements: the (R) configuration favoured high affinity and selectivity for the α 1 d-AR subtype with respect to α 1 a and α 1 b-AR subtypes, while the (S) configuration was associated to higher affinity and potency for 5 -HT 1 A receptor with high selectivity ratios. Moreover, eutomers at the α 1 d-AR subtype also displayed the best antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects in human prostate cancer cells (PC- 3), indicating the involvement of the α 1 d-AR subtype in their anticancer properties, which was confirmed evaluating the most interesting compounds in α 1 d-AR silenced PC- 3 cells. We also demonstrated that 1, 4 -dioxane nucleus proved to be a suitable scaffold for the design of ligands directed to other receptor systems, such as sigma, NMDA and dopamine (DA) receptors. Recently, it was demonstrated that the properly substituted 4 -(2 -aminoethyl) - 1, 3 -dioxane and the Nbenzyl- 4 -(2 -aminoethyl) - 1, 3 -dioxane derivatives, ring and side chain homologues of dexoxadrol and <b>etoxadrol,</b> resulted in compounds showing high NMDA or σ 1 receptor affinity, respectively. Therefore, two series of regioisomers, bearing the 1, 4 -dioxane nucleus were prepared and evaluated in vitro for their affinities at σ 1, σ 2, and PCP binding site of NMDA receptor. Within the aminomethyl series, trans-(6 -cyclohexyl- 6 -phenyl- 1, 4 -dioxan- 2 -yl) methanamine, which showed binding affinity and functional activity not significantly different from those of (S) -(+) -ketamine, due to its promising therapeutic potential, deserves to be pharmacologically studied in depth. The N-benzyl-aminomethyl derivative N-Benzyl- 1 -(5, 5 -diphenyl- 1, 4 -dioxan- 2 -yl) methanamine showed the highest affinity and selectivity for σ 1 with respect to both σ 2 and the PCP binding site. Some compounds, already published or previously synthesized by the members of the research group, were selected to be evaluated for their binding affinity at human dopamine D 2, D 3 or D 4 receptor subtypes, expressed on HEK 293 cells, which I carried out during my experience at the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Encouraged by the preliminary results, during the six months I spent at NIDA in Baltimore (U. S. A.), I designed, synthesized and biologically evaluated a novel series of hybrid molecules, obtained by coupling 5, 5 -, 6, 6 -diphenyl-substituted 1, 4 -dioxane nucleus or the more conformationally constrained 1, 4 -benzodioxane nucleus with the N-(4 -(4 -(2, 3 -dichloro) -piperazine- 1 -yl) butyl) carboxamide or N-(3 -fluoro or 3 -hydroxy- 4 -(4 -(2, 3 -dichloro) -piperazine- 1 -yl) butyl) carboxamides fragments, which had previously been shown to play a crucial role in increasing selectivity toward the dopamine D 3 receptor subtype compared to the D 2 and D 4 subtypes. From the SAR study some interesting D 3 -selective compounds emerged, for which functional studies are in progress. Moreover, during my research experience in Germany, at Westfälische Wilhelm-Universität Münster, I optimized and validated a cell-based functional assay for GluN 2 A and GluN 2 B subunitcontaining NMDA receptors, which was performed to test the antagonist potency of 1, 4 -dioxane NMDA channel blockers and a novel series of selective GluN 2 B subunit antagonists...|$|E
