5|$|In Blue Heelers twelfth season, {{ratings were}} at an all time low of 1.2 million viewers per episode, which {{was less than}} <b>half</b> <b>what</b> the show had been {{attracting}} during its peak from 1997 to 2000, when it was drawing more than 2.5 million viewers. After these falling ratings during 2005, Seven decided to take action and considered cancelling the series altogether. However, before doing this, they commissioned a shortened season consisting of only 11 episodes, taking the show's episode tally to 510. This season was shortened from the normal season length of around 40 episodes.|$|E
5|$|Feynman's {{salary was}} $380 a month, about <b>half</b> <b>what</b> {{he needed to}} cover his modest living {{expenses}} and Arline's medical bills. The rest came from her $3,300 in savings. On weekends, Feynman drove to Albuquerque to see his ailing wife in a car borrowed from his good friend Klaus Fuchs. Asked who at Los Alamos was {{most likely to be}} a spy, Fuchs speculated that Feynman, with his safe cracking and frequent trips to Albuquerque, was the most likely candidate. When Fuchs confessed to being a spy for the Soviet Union in 1950, this would be seen in a different light. The FBI would compile a bulky file on Feynman.|$|E
5|$|Stone {{hoped to}} earn {{most of her}} college {{expenses}} through teaching {{in one of the}} institute’s lower departments. But because of its policy against employing first-year students as teachers, the only work Stone could get other than teaching at district schools during the winter break was house keeping chores through the school’s manual labor program. For this she was paid three cents an hour—less than <b>half</b> <b>what</b> male students received for their work in the program. Among measures taken to reduce her expenses, Stone prepared her own meals in her dormitory room. In 1844 Stone was given a position teaching arithmetic in the Ladies Department, but again received reduced pay because of her sex.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the 14th century, French kings {{sought to}} expand their {{influence}} {{at the expense of}} the territorial holdings of the nobility. They ran into difficulties when attempting to confiscate the holdings of the English kings in southern France, leading to the Hundred Years' War, waged from 1337 to 1453. Early in the war the English under Edward III (r. 1327–77) and his son Edward, the Black Prince (d. 1376), won the battles of Crécy and Poitiers, captured the city of Calais, and won control of much of France. The resulting stresses almost caused the disintegration of the French kingdom during the early years of the war. In the early 15th century, France again came close to dissolving, but in the late 1420s the military successes of Joan of Arc (d. 1431) led to the victory of the French and the capture of the last English possessions in southern France in 1453. The price was high, as the population of France at the end of the Wars was likely <b>half</b> <b>what</b> it had been at the start of the conflict. Conversely, the Wars had a positive effect on English national identity, doing much to fuse the various local identities into a national English ideal. The conflict with France also helped create a national culture in England separate from French culture, which had previously been the dominant influence. The dominance of the English longbow began during early stages of the Hundred Years' War, and cannon appeared on the battlefield at Crécy in 1346.|$|E

Tayloe refused to issue the mortgage and turn over the deed, claiming that the hotel was now worth much more than $22,500 and that Willard had not paid in gold (the only form of cash available in 1854) as specified in the lease. Worse, due to inflation, the Notes were worth only about <b>half</b> <b>what</b> gold specie was worth. Willard sued for relief.|$|E

However, when one of the smelter operators refused to accept the deal brokered by the Governor of Colorado, James Hamilton Peabody, the Governor called in federal troops.|$|E
25|$|The Berlin Conference of 1885 ceded {{control of}} the Congo Free State to King LeopoldII as his private possession. From around 1900 there was growing {{international}} concern for the extreme and savage treatment of the Congolese population under LeopoldII, for whom the Congo was primarily a source of revenue from ivory and rubber production. Many Congolese were killed by Leopold's agents for failing to meet production quotas for ivory and rubber. It is estimated that nearly 10million were killed during the Leopold period. In 1908, this outcry led the Belgian state to assume responsibility for {{the government of the}} colony, henceforth called the Belgian Congo. A Belgian commission in 1919 estimated that Congo's population was <b>half</b> <b>what</b> it was in 1879.|$|E

25|$|In 2001, a 50% {{share in}} long-distance {{passenger}} services {{was sold to}} directors of Australian company West Coast Railway, but neither it nor any other company elected to purchase the Southerner without {{the promise of a}} subsidy. The Ministry of Economic Development funded a feasibility study into the economic impact of subsidising the Southerner, but this failed to demonstrate a viable business case for the service - patronage had fallen to an average of between 40 and 50 people per day in each direction. This was roughly <b>half</b> <b>what</b> was necessary to make the train viable. As neither airline nor bus services along the route were subsidised, the government decided not to subsidise the train and its demise was inevitable.|$|E
25|$|In January 1872 Isaac Rich died, {{leaving the}} vast {{bulk of his}} estate to a trust that would go to Boston University after ten years of growth while the University was organized. Most of this bequest {{consisted}} of real estate throughout {{the core of the}} city of Boston which was appraised at more than $1.5 million. Kilgore describes this as the largest single donation to an American college or university to that time. By December, however, the Great Boston Fire of 1872 had destroyed {{all but one of the}} buildings Rich had left to the University, and the insurance companies with which they had been insured were bankrupt. The value of his estate, when turned over to the University in 1882, was <b>half</b> <b>what</b> it had been in 1872.|$|E
25|$|In 1830 {{the company}} {{considered}} building a locomotive line from Derby to Smithy Houses, {{and two years}} later looked at the possibility of a locomotive line from Derby to Little Eaton. The first was surveyed by an engineer called Stephenson, presumed to be George Stephenson, but no further action was taken. Toll reductions were made from 1834, in an attempt to stay competitive, but by 1840 there were three main line railways in Derby. By 1845, tolls on the Little Eaton line were less than <b>half</b> <b>what</b> they had been five years earlier. The Derby and Gainsborough Company wanted to buy the Little Eaton line in 1846, and were quoted £30,000, as were the Midland Railway in 1847. Instead, they built a parallel line to Ripley, which opened in 1855.|$|E

25|$|A lengthy {{antitrust}} investigation followed. The United States Senate {{asked the}} Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Justice Department {{to investigate the}} merger the day after it was announced, which the FTC did on May 14. As the merger {{was approved by the}} two companies in mid-May, the Senate and FTC each conducted separate investigations. On June 5, 1922, the FTC issued a report concluding that the merger was in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. However, United States Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty overruled the FTC on June 22. The merger finally took effect on October 10, 1922. Six decades later, financial analysts observed that Bethlehem Steel probably purchased Lackawanna Steel for less than <b>half</b> <b>what</b> the company was worth. Over the next decade, Bethlehem Steel spent more than $40 million modernizing the Lackawanna site.|$|E
25|$|The series began taping in colour in late 1974. This period {{also saw}} the series shift its {{emphasis}} from sexual situations and drama {{to focus more on}} comedy, however by mid-1975 ratings had gone into decline so a bold new storyline was concocted in the hope of revitalising the series. The Mad Bomber storyline, in August–September 1975, came in the wake of news from periodical TV Week that the ratings for Number 96 had dropped to just <b>half</b> <b>what</b> they had been at the beginning of 1974. In an unprecedented move, 40 complete scripts were discarded and rewritten, while the Number 96 set was sealed off to non-essential personnel. The new storyline involved a mysterious figure planting a time bomb in Number 96, following a series of warnings and false alarms. The dramatic storyline was intended to draw back viewers and to provide a mechanism to quickly write out several existing characters in a bid to fresh up the cast of characters and revamp the storylines.|$|E
25|$|Other {{profession}}s {{could give}} status {{based on the}} profession and the skill, but no professions besides poets could have a status {{as high as the}} bishop, king, or highest poet. For instance in one text the jurist or brithem had three ranks, and the highest was given an honour price only halfway up the other scales. The ranking of a brithem was based on his skill and whether he knew all three components of law (here: traditional law, poetry, and canon law), or fewer. A craftsman who worked with wood could have similar honour-prices but these were based on his craftsmanship. However, a physician and a blacksmith, among other ranks, had an even lower honour-price—less than <b>half</b> <b>what</b> the brithem could achieve, and the honour-price apparently did not vary based on skill. Other professionals, such as makers of chariots or engravers, had still lower honour-prices (less than that of a bóaire). Finally a few professions received only meagre ranks, as with the lowest poets, and the authors may be actively making fun of some of the professions, such as comb makers.|$|E

25|$|The English {{revenues}} themselves {{varied from}} year to year. When financial records begin in 1155 to 1156, the annual income of England was £10,500, or around <b>half</b> <b>what</b> the revenue had been under Henry I. This was {{due in part to}} The Anarchy and King Stephen's loose rule resulting in the reduction of royal authority. As time went on, royal authority improved and the revenue consequently went up to an average of £22,000 a year. Due to the preparation for the Third Crusade, revenue then increased to over £31,000 in 1190 under Richard. The number fell again to £11,000 a year whilst Richard was abroad. Between 1194–1198, revenue averaged £25,000. Under Richard's successor John, income fluctuated between £22,000 and £25,000 from 1199–1203. In order to fund for the reconquest of France, English income increased to £50,000 in 1210 but then rose to over £83,000 in 1211 before falling back down to £50,000 in 1212. Revenue then fell down to below £26,000 in 1214, and then further to £18,500 in 1215. The first three years of Henry III's reign brought in £8,000 on average due to the fragility the civil war had brought to England.|$|E
500|$|The game is {{generally}} known for fixing problems {{found in the}} first game, including improvements such as allowing parties of three characters, having a larger world, better graphics, {{and the ability to}} carry more items. Other noted improvements were keys that can be used multiple times and new strategic elements introduced because of larger parties and larger groups of enemies. The game's music is often praised, despite its limited 8-bit capabilities. Considered a classic for the RPG genre, the game is regarded as praiseworthy. Japanese reviews highlighted the Famicom version's difficulty, stemming from issues such as the many traps in the Cave of Rhone, and the final boss's ability to cast a [...] "Healall" [...] spell, and this has led to some critics calling the game [...] "the most difficult Dragon Quest".

The typographers had already started work from another copy. Maple Press of York, Pennsylvania, was lined up to do the printing. Because of wartime shortages, one of a publisher’s biggest worries was finding adequate supplies of paper. Smith approached Manny and Leonard Relles from Central Paper, told them about the Smyth Report and its significance, and asked them if they could deliver [...] of paper to Maple Press in twelve days.
