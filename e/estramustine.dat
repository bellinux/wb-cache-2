25|$|Estrogens {{have been}} used in the {{treatment}} of prostate cancer. The estrogens that {{have been used}} include diethylstilbestrol, fosfestrol (diethylstilbestrol diphosphate), ethinylestradiol, ethinylestradiol sulfonate, polyestradiol phosphate, and estradiol undecylate, as well as the combined estrogenic and nitrogen mustard alkylating antineoplastic agent <b>estramustine</b> phosphate. Newer estrogens with improved tolerability and safety like GTx-758 have also been studied. Estrogens are effective in the treatment of prostate cancer because they are functional antiandrogens. They both suppress testosterone concentrations to castrate levels via their antigonadotropic activity and they reduce the percentage of free and bioavailable testosterone by increasing sex hormone-binding globulin production and levels. Estrogens {{have been found to be}} equivalent in effectiveness to androgen deprivation therapy with castration and nonsteroidal antiandrogens. However, they significantly increase cardiovascular mortality, and for this reason, are now little used in prostate cancer. Although the most commonly employed estrogens like diethylstilbestrol and ethinylestradiol are associated with increased cardiovascular mortality, it is notable that certain estrogens, namely polyestradiol phosphate, have been found not to do so; this is attributed to different degrees of effect of the various estrogens on hepatic protein synthesis.|$|E

50|$|<b>Estramustine</b> {{phosphate}} acts by two mechanisms: 1) direct cytotoxic activity via {{inhibition of}} microtubules (caused by its alkylating nitrogen mustard moiety); and 2) antigonadotropic effects which suppress gonadal androgen production (caused by its estrogenic activity).

The drug is tissue-selectively taken up by prostate cells and hence produces minimal cytotoxic effects in healthy tissue.|$|E

It is selectively distributed into estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tissues such as ER-expressing tumors like those seen in breast and prostate cancers.

40|$|Background: The {{nitrogen}} mustard derivative of estradiol- 17 β-phosphate <b>estramustine</b> {{is used for}} the treatment of prostate cancer. <b>Estramustine</b> may trigger suicidal death of cancer cells. Side effects of <b>estramustine</b> include anemia. At least in theory, <b>estramustine</b> could cause anemia by stimulation of eryptosis, the suicidal death of erythrocytes. Hallmarks of eryptosis include cell shrinkage, increased cytosolic Ca 2 + activity ([Ca 2 +]), ceramide formation and phosphatidylserine translocation to the outer leaflet of the cell membrane with phosphatidylserine exposure at the erythrocyte surface. Eryptosis is stimulated by increase of cytosolic Ca 2 + activity ([Ca 2 +]i). The present study explored whether <b>estramustine</b> triggers eryptosis. Methods: [Ca 2 +]i was estimated from Fluo 3 fluorescence, cell volume from forward scatter, phosphatidylserine exposure from annexin V binding, and hemolysis from hemoglobin release. Results: A 24 h exposure to <b>estramustine</b> (≤ 100 µM) significantly increased [Ca 2 +]i, increased annexin V binding and increased hemoglobin release. The effect of <b>estramustine</b> on annexin V binding was significantly blunted by removal of extracellular Ca 2 +. Conclusions: <b>Estramustine</b> stimulates both, eryptosis and hemolysis. The <b>estramustine</b> induced translocation of phosphatidylserine to the cell surface is at least partially due to increase of cytosolic Ca 2 + activity...|$|E

40|$|Because microtubules are {{important}} components of cell motility and intracellular transport, {{it is reasonable}} to propose that the depolymerizing effect of an antimicrotubule agent, <b>estramustine,</b> on glioma microtubules would modulate cell invasiveness. To determine whether matrix metalloproteinases, key factors in cell invasion, are affected by exposure to <b>estramustine,</b> a cell proliferation assay, a zymogram, a collagenolysis assay and a haptoinvasion assay were used in this study. The zymogram revealed that an activated (62 kDa) form of matrix metalloproteinase- 2 diminished with increasing <b>estramustine</b> concentrations. The collagenolysis assay demonstrated approximately 2. 5 - to 21 -fold lower rates of enzymatic activity suppressed by <b>estramustine</b> in a dose-dependent manner at <b>estramustine</b> concentrations of 1, 5, and 10 microM, compared with the control group. On the haptoinvasion assay, no statistically significant difference was seen in the 0. 5 microM <b>estramustine</b> group, whereas 1 - 10 microM <b>estramustine</b> groups revealed significant suppression of invasion from 6 to 24 h in a dose-dependent manner. The results suggest that <b>estramustine</b> suppresses the invasion of U 87 MG cells in vitro using the decreasing available matrix metalloproteinase- 2, an effect caused by the disassembly of microtubules.

40|$|The {{cellular}} {{targets for}} <b>estramustine,</b> an antitumor drug {{used in the}} treatment of hormone-refractory prostate cancer, are believed to be the spindle microtubules responsible for chromosome separation at mitosis. <b>Estramustine</b> only weakly inhibits polymerization of purified tubulin into microtubules by binding to tubulin (Kd, ≈ 30 μM) at a site distinct from the colchicine or the vinblastine binding sites. However, by video microscopy, we find that <b>estramustine</b> strongly stabilizes growing and shortening dynamics at plus ends of bovine brain microtubules devoid of microtubule-associated proteins at concentrations substantially below those required to inhibit polymerization of the microtubules. <b>Estramustine</b> strongly reduced the rate and extent both of shortening and growing, increased the percentage of time the microtubules spent in an attenuated state, neither growing nor shortening detectably, and reduced the overall dynamicity of the microtubules. Significantly, the combined suppressive effects of vinblastine and <b>estramustine</b> on the rate and extent of shortening and dynamicity were additive.
