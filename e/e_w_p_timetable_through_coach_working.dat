40|$|International audienceEnzymatic {{collagen}} cross-linking {{has been}} shown {{to play an important role}} in the macroscopic elastic and plastic deformation of bone across ages. However, its direct contribution to collagen fibril deformation is unknown. The aim of this study is to determine how covalent intermolecular connections from enzymatic collagen cross-links contribute to collagen fibril elastic and plastic deformation of adults and children's bone matrix. We used ex vivo data previously obtained from biochemical analysis of children and adults bone samples (n = 14; n = 8, respectively) to create 22 sample-specific computational models of cross-linked collagen fibrils. By simulating a tensile test for each fibril, we computed the modulus of elasticity (E), ultimate tensile and yield stress (σ u and σ y), and elastic, plastic and total work (<b>W</b> <b>e,</b> <b>W</b> <b>p</b> and <b>W</b> tot) for each collagen fibril. We present a novel difference between children and adult bone in the deformation of the collagen phase and suggest a link between collagen fibril scale and macroscale for elastic behavior in children bone under the influence of immature enzymatic cross-links. We show a parametric linear correlation between <b>W</b> <b>e</b> and immature enzymatic collagen cross-links at the collagen fibril scale in the children population that is similar to the one we found at the macroscale in our previous study. Finally, we suggest the key role of covalent intermolecular connections to stiffness parameters (e. g. elastic modulus and <b>W</b> <b>e)</b> in children's collagen fibril and to toughness parameters in adult's collagen fi-bril, respectively...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the feasibility of}} establishing a new trauma transfer checklist and assessed its impact on trauma-related interhospital transfers. A standard envelope with a printed checklist (N. <b>E.</b> <b>W.</b> S.) incorporating four key concepts in the care and transfer of trauma patients was used. A prospective comparison of consecutive interhospital trauma transfers to the major trauma service between July 1999 –May 2000 (pre-N. <b>E.</b> <b>W.</b> S.) and August 2000 –November 2000 (post-N. <b>E.</b> <b>W.</b> S.) was made. Changes in management satisfaction were assessed by a Likert scale (1 = poor to 5 = excellent). Pre-N. <b>E.</b> <b>W.</b> S., 88 trauma patients were transferred and 20 trauma transfers were recorded post-N. <b>E.</b> <b>W.</b> S. The time to definitive care pre-N. <b>E.</b> <b>W.</b> S. was 443 ± 322 min, and 339 ± 108 min (P = 0. 014) post-N. <b>E.</b> <b>W.</b> S.
