5|$|After Victoria {{converted}} to alphanumeric route markers the Victorian section was signed as B23.

This violates the convention in New South Wales, where numbered routes below 50 are prefixed with an 'A' and 'B' routes are numbered above 50; the violation was allowed so the number and letter would be consistent across state lines.|$|E

5|$|As the Henry Hudson Parkway {{replaced}} Riverside <b>Drive</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid-1930s, NY9A {{was moved}} onto it, eventually {{using the new}} parkway to where it crossed US9 (Broadway) in the Bronx. Here, NY9A exited the parkway and ran concurrent with US9 to the split in Yonkers. The Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel connecting Manhattan's Battery Park to Brooklyn was completed in 1950. By 1960, {{an extension of the}} West Side Elevated Highway south to the Manhattan tunnel portal became part of NY27A, which had ended in Brooklyn prior to the construction of the tunnel. On January1, 1970, NY27A was truncated on its western end to eastern Nassau County while NY27 was extended northward over NY27A's former routing through the Battery Tunnel and the West Side Elevated Highway.|$|E

5|$|M-34 was {{designated}} and {{signed with the}} beginning of the state highway system around July1, 1919, along a route that extended to either end of its current routing. These western and eastern extensions were added to other highways during the 1920s, shortening M-34 to roughly its current length. A few more changes were made in the mid-1950s and 1960s resulting in the modern routing. M-34 has a short, unsigned sibling, Connector 34, which is better known as Industrial <b>Drive</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Adrian area.|$|E

5|$|The Browns {{ended their}} regular {{season with a}} win over the Dodgers and an undefeated record. The Browns began the game by scoring 31 {{unanswered}} points. The first score came on a short Dub Jones run that followed an 80-yard <b>drive</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first quarter. The next score came on a 76-yard <b>drive</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second quarter. After a pair of passes and a 14-yard run by Edgar Jones, Graham completed a long touchdown pass to Lavelli, who sped away from defender Monk Gafford on the right sideline. Graham engineered another long drive just {{before the end of}} the first half, completing 18- and 20-yard passes to Speedie. The 90-yard march ended with a short touchdown run by Graham, giving Cleveland a 21–0 advantage at the half. Groza kicked a field goal at the beginning of the third quarter, and a fumble by Gafford on the ensuing kickoff led to a touchdown pass from Graham to Gillom, putting the Browns up by 31 points. With a comfortable lead, Brown took out his starters and substituted third-string players. The Dodgers proceeded to score three touchdowns, two of which came on long passes from Bob Chappuis, but the Browns won the game 31–21. The win left the Browns on top of the standings in the AAFC's Western Division ahead of San Francisco, which had lost only two games, both to the Browns. The perfect regular season record was the first in professional football since 1942, when the National Football League's Chicago Bears won all of their games. Chicago, however, lost the NFL championship that year.|$|E
