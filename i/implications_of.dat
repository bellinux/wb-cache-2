Residual <b>implication</b> <b>of</b> interval-valued fuzzy triangle norm {{is first}} defined. Then {{the relation between}} residual <b>implication</b> <b>of</b> interval-valued fuzzy triangle norm and residual <b>implication</b> <b>of</b> triangle norm is established. Finally, some properties <b>of</b> residual <b>implication</b> <b>of</b> interval-valued fuzzy triangle norm are examined. 1...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} value-relevance of {{financial}} statement information in entities who applied good corporate governance principles. This riset is very crucial {{to deal with}} due to threre was no typical prior research examining {{whether or not the}} <b>implication</b> <b>of</b> good corporate governance (GCG) based on KEP 339 /BEJ/ 07 - 2001 could enhance the relevancy of financial statement information value. This research uses Ohlson valuation theory base (1995) and has two hypotheses. First, the value-relevance of financial statement information has increased each year. Second, the value-relevance of financial statement information has been higher after the <b>implication</b> <b>of</b> GCG compared with before the <b>implication</b> <b>of</b> GCG. The difference between before and after the <b>implication</b> <b>of</b> GCG has been significant. Using BEJ report No 1409 /BEJ-PEM/ 04 - 02 as a sampling base and restricted in 2000 - 2004 year period, thus the study provide new empirical evidence as follows: First, the value-relevance of financial statement information trend has decreased ech year. Second, the value-relevance of financial statement information before <b>implication</b> <b>of</b> GCG indeed higher than after the GCG carried out. Finally, the difference between the value-relevance of financial statement information before and after <b>implication</b> <b>of</b> GCG has been significantly differe...|$|R

5|$|Reports {{suggest that}} {{imbalance}} of brain metal homeostasis {{may be a}} cause of PrPSc-associated neurotoxicity, though the underlying mechanisms are difficult to explain based on existing information. Proposed hypotheses include a functional role for PrPC in metal metabolism, and loss of this function due to aggregation to the disease-associated PrPSc form {{as the cause of}} brain metal imbalance. Other views suggest gain of toxic function by PrPSc due to sequestration of PrPC-associated metals within the aggregates, resulting in the generation of redox-active PrPSc complexes. The physiological <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> some PrPC-metal interactions are known, while others are still unclear. The pathological <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> PrPC-metal interaction include metal-induced oxidative damage, and in some instances conversion of PrPC to a PrPSc-like form.|$|E
