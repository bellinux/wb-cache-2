2500|$|John Clement Fitzpatrick was {{commissioned}} by the George Washington Bicentennial Commission in 1931 to transcribe, edit and publish Washington's writings in what became a 39 volume work entitled The Writings of George Washington. The Commission was created to commemorate the coming 200th anniversary of Washington's birth in 1932, and to promote education in Revolutionary War era history overall. [...] This massive work, taken from Washington's letters, military records, diaries, etc., was edited and compiled {{under the direction of}} John Clement Fitzpatrick, and sponsored and prepared by the Commission, under the authority of U.S. Congress, 1931, taking several years to complete. The commission conducted a thorough investigation of all available books, pamphlets reports, and other material relating to {{the life and times of}} George Washington. Because the field was very broad, members of the commission found it necessary to study the requirements of selecting source material while making sure they didn't exclude any <b>essential</b> <b>data,</b> a process that Fitzpatrick over saw for eight years until his death in 1940 before all the volumes had been published.|$|E
