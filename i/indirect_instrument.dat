She is often said to be the daughter of Arthur's mother Lady Igraine and her first husband Gorlois, so that Arthur, the son of Igraine and Uther Pendragon, is her half-brother.

The characteristics of the financial system during the initial stage of the transition sometimes favor relatively direct instruments. At this stage market-based variants of direct instruments may combine the necessary effectiveness in reducing monetary expansion with the need to introduce and stimulate competition in the financial markets. During this stage <b>indirect</b> <b>instruments</b> can be developed and tested (“belt and braces” approach).

This thesis deals with the relationship between tax policy and new housing construction. Taking influence on the building industry through tax policies - that is to say, through <b>indirect</b> <b>instruments</b> - is particularly advantageous thanks to the low administrative overhead, as no further redistribution from public budgets is necessary. Hiding behind this advantage, though, are a number of difficult-to-estimate quantifications in the form of tax allowances or, conversely, of the amount of the tax burden. <b>Indirect</b> <b>instruments</b> can influence residential development activities in both positive and negative ways, and this thesis addresses both. Aside from tax instruments, the state may support new housing construction through direct instruments, a term which covers various forms of loans at preferential terms, grants and subsidies.

40|$|This paper {{sheds light}} {{on the role of}} the impact of taxes on energy {{production}} versus tariffs on imported goods for trade, energy demand, and welfare. For this, we develop a structural Eaton-Kortum type general equilibrium model of international trade which includes an energy sector. We estimate the key parameters of that model and calibrate it to domestic prices and production using data for 34 OECD countries and the rest of the world in the average year between 2000 and 2005. The model helps understanding the interplay between country-specific energy productivity, energy demand, and trade. The energy sector turns out to be an important determinant of the size of welfare gains from trade liberalization. We find that general import tariffs can be an effective instrument to reduce energy demand. For small open economies, taxing imports as an <b>indirect</b> <b>instrument</b> may be even preferable to taxing energy as a direct instrument from a welfare perspective, if countries pursue the goal of reducing energy demand to a specific extent. This is not the case for large countries such as the United States. Calibrated general equilibrium analysis; Energy demand; International trade; Structural model estimation...|$|E
40|$|This article {{investigates the}} dynamic {{linkages}} between the estimated parameters of a zero coupon yield curve and macroeconomic variables like inflation, {{gross domestic product}} growth {{in the presence of}} a monetary policy indicator in India for the period July 1997 to February 2004. The study finds that there exists strong causality from financial factors, defined by three parameters of the yield curves ('Level', 'Slope', 'Curvature') to macroeconomic factors; growth, inflation and monetary policy indicators (changes in the call money rate). However, the causality in the opposite direction is found to be weaker. It is found that theyield and macro factors do not cause each other before the launch of a liquidity adjustment facility, so the evidence of causality from financial to macroeconomic factors can be attributed to the introduction of a liquidity adjustment facility in June 2000. The causality from yield factors to macro factors is primarily driven by the fact that the 'changes in level' of yield curve brings an impact on inflation through the changes in monetary policy. This finding suggests that monetary policy plays a key role in driving the causality. This also implies that the <b>indirect</b> <b>instrument</b> of monetary policy mechanism is becoming increasingly important to influence the aggregate demand in the economy. term structure of interest rates, inflation, growth, monetary policy, financial reforms, LAF, VAR modelling, Granger causality, Impulse response,...|$|E

In addition, we looked at whether people with a health motivation focus on nutrition information on food products more than people with a taste motivation. Design Respondents were instructed to choose one of five cereals for either the kindergarten (health motivation) or the student cafeteria (taste motivation). The eye tracker measured their visual attention during this task. Then respondents completed a short questionnaire. Setting Laboratory of the ETH Zurich, Switzerland. Subjects Videos and questionnaires from thirty-two students (seventeen males; mean age 24 · 91 years) were analysed. Results Respondents with a health motivation viewed the nutrition information on the food products for longer {{and more often than}} respondents with a taste motivation. Health motivation also seemed to stimulate deeper processing of the nutrition information. The student cafeteria group focused primarily on the other information and did this for longer and more often than the health motivation group. Additionally, the package design affected participants' nutrition information search. Conclusions Two factors appear to influence whether people pay attention to nutrition information on food products: their motivation and the product's design. If the package design does not sufficiently facilitate the localization of nutrition information, health motivation can stimulate consumers to look for nutrition information so that they may make a more deliberate food choic...|$|E
40|$|Given {{that the}} {{motivation}} for aid is poverty reduction, I argue that Aid for Trade (AfT) measures need to demonstrate that they are effective and have a potential impact on poverty. The debate about aid for trade measures lacks {{a focus on the}} poverty dimension of trade. Trade is an <b>indirect</b> <b>instrument</b> for poverty reduction and in SADC, increasing trade has a low impact on poverty. From a donor perspective, support to sectors such as agriculture, where the poor are located, is therefore more effective than to sectors or activities in which the poor are hardly involved. While the overall motivation for providing aid for trade is poverty reduction, I argue that such aid should only be given if there are market failures, for example in coordination and public goods. Aid for trade is particularly important for countries that already have market access but face supply constraints that restrict their utilisation of this market access (as is mainly the case for SADC countries). In this case, aid and trade might serve as complementary activities. I present new data of AfT to SADC countries. The main finding is that so far AfT has played only a minor role for SADC countries, and its role has not changed significantly during recent years – at least not in terms of disbursement. The disbursement ratio of AfT is low (around 50 %). We do not find any robust relationship between disbursement of AfT among individual SADC countries and documented needs. There is accordingly scope for major improvement in the effectiveness of AfT...|$|E
40|$|In Britain, and Wales particularly, {{inclusion}} and equal opportunities for all became key principles guiding {{the work of}} the many partnerships that were established {{at the beginning of this}} century. A primary objective of this paper is to develop a greater understanding of the politics and processes within `partnership¿ as a widely used governance instrument. We argue that rather than dismissing partnerships for their exclusionary mechanisms, they might be considered as distinctive `arenas of power¿ where the emphasis on participation and consensus shapes power relations in particular ways. What we demonstrate, using a differentiated topology of power [Allen, J., 2003. Lost Geographies of Power. Blackwell Publishing], is the effect that different modes of power, at different times, can have on social interaction and the process of partnership working. Although inequality in terms of resources existed in our study, we show that effective partnership working was enhanced at times when more reciprocal modes of power were used. We conclude, therefore, that an analysis of power based on resources alone is limited because the use and effect of resources may be ¿modified, displaced or disrupted depending upon the relationships that come into play¿ [Allen, J., 2003. Lost Geographies of Power. Blackwell Publishing, p. 97]. Hence, there is a need for more research on power struggles and conflicts in partnerships over time. Only then it is possible to see how and when differences in resources affect social interaction and result in different levels of (in) equality.

40|$|After {{having all}} but {{forgotten}} free banking for decades, in the last 25 years economists have rediscovered its history, updated its theory, and explored its relevance {{to the spread of}} electronic money (for a summary, see Selgin and White 1994). Free banking has influenced recent debate about currency boards, dollarization, and other monetary systems that are rivals to central banking. Yet despite interest in free banking as a historical fact and a future possibility, free banking nowhere exists today as a living system. The heyday of free banking was before the First World War. During and after the war, a combination of governmental desire to manipulate money and economic theory favoring central banking led governments to replace competitive issue of notes (paper money) by commercial banks with monopoly issue by central banks or other monetary authorities. The last system of competitive note issue among the nearly 60 countries that once had it ended in 1962 (Schuler 1992 : 40 – 45). Hong Kong, Scotland, and Northern Ireland still have multiple banks issuing notes, but the issuing banks operate under rules that make them no more than agents of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority or the Bank of England, respectively. Notes are only a small share of broad measures of the supply of money and credit such as M 2 or M 3. However, monopoly note issue has an importance much greater than its share of such measures indicates because it gives the issuer an <b>indirect</b> <b>instrument</b> of control over {{the rest of the money}} supply.

40|$|Sound {{public policy}} {{addresses}} externalities directly, when possible. Air pollution is best alleviated by policy instruments that internalize the social cost of pollution, making it attractive to reduce emissions. One such instrument {{might be a}} tax levied on individual emissions, if they are measurable {{and if there is}} an accepted relationship between emissions and the damages to society. But such first-best solutions may not be feasible for many reasons, among them the cost of implementation. When first-best instruments are unavailable, indirect instruments, such as presumptive taxing of polluting inputs, may be a powerful alternative. Energy pricing is, for air pollution, one such <b>indirect</b> <b>instrument.</b> Energy pricing policies affect emissions through fuel substitution and energy conservation. The authors provide an empirical framework for measuring the magnitude of this impact and apply it to two cases: manufacturing in Chile and Indonesia. They find that: 1) the responsiveness of emissions makes energy prices a powerful indirect tool for reducing emissions; 2) there is room for substitution toward cleaner input combinations - both toward cleaner fuels and away from energy, toward labor, capital, and materials; 3) substitution toward cleaner fuels can also be induced without increasing energy prices generally, by increasing the price of the dirtier fuels, thereby reducing the relative price of the cleaner ones. But noncompensated price increases for the dirtier fuels, plus increases for all fuels, will be more powerful since they will also induce firms to reduce their overall energy use. In exploiting interfuel substitution, it is important to assess the relative damage caused by different pollutants. In Indonesia, increases in coal prices could deliver reductions in particulate emissions, but in Chile they would not, because of a small own-price elasticity, a heavily-used source of energy that also produces particulate emissions. Higher prices for pollution-laden fuels will generally reduce demand, as expected, but the net effect on emissions will depend on: a) whether other fuels laden with the same pollutants are spared such price increases; b) whether their cross-price elasticities are positive; and c) which fuel shares are high.
