50|$|In {{response}} to centuries of flooding on the Yellow River, engineers initially proposed the Sanmenxia Dam in early 1935. In 1954, the Yellow River Planning Board was established and oversaw {{a survey of}} the river with help from Soviet engineers. The Soviet engineers recommended a dam at the Sanmenxia site. Original plans for the dam called for a maximum reservoir level 360 m above sea level (ASL). This would have required the relocation of 870,000 people and the flooding of 3500 km2. The design was revised to a maximum level of 340 m ASL which required the relocation of 400,000 people and flooded much less area. In 1955 the Comprehensive River Basin Planning Report officially proposed the project. The report was submitted to the National People's Congress and swiftly approved that same year while preliminary construction began soon after. Under Soviet Union supervision, construction ceremoniously began on 13 April 1957. Construction on the left-bank cofferdam began in June 1957 and excavation was completed a year later along with the pouring of the left-bank foundation. In October 1958, construction on the right-bank cofferdam was initiated and the river was closed by November 1958. In June 1960, the reservoir was at full pool and the dam crest reached its <b>design</b> <b>elevation</b> of 353 m ASL in April 1961. The dam's generators were commissioned between 1973 and 1975. The dam was the first major water project on the Yellow River and constructed with manual labor. Upon completion, it was hailed as an engineering success for the new republic and its image was printed on Chinese banknotes.|$|E

30|$|In {{terms of}} {{foundation}} design and settlement analysis, shallow-buried immersed tube tunnels generally have a requirement of low-additional load and low-bearing capacity, and so their foundation treatment adopts common cushion methods, including scraping the ground layer, the sand flow method, grouting method, sand filling method, and sand blasting method [74, 75]. When the foundation {{condition of the}} immersed tube tunnel is poor, or the buried depth and the backfill load connecting the land is large, pile foundations and composite foundations {{should be used to}} meet the requirements of bearing capacity and to effectively control settlement. In actual construction, however, the pile elevation cannot completely control the <b>design</b> <b>elevation,</b> some auxiliary measures should be taken to ensure that the top of the pile group connects to the immersed structure. To effectively control the longitudinal uneven settlement of the tunnel, research is needed on the gravel bedding layer {{as well as on the}} settlement and control of foundation combination types, such as underwater pile foundations, and settlement-reducing pile foundations [76].|$|E
40|$|Following {{evidence}} of its positive contribution to innovation and company performance, many firms {{are seeking to}} elevate design to a strategic level. However, little is known as to how this can be achieved. This study draws on the literatures concerned with elevating organizational functions and with organizational legitimacy, and aims to unravel and detail critical practices and potential tensions influencing the elevation of design’s status in firms. To do so, 53 in-depth interviews were undertaken with key informants, representing a range of functional specialisms, in 12 companies, including large multinational companies as well as SMEs. Findings show how six practices – top management support, leadership of the design function, generating awareness of design’s role and contribution, inter-functional coordination, evaluation of design, and formalization of product and service development processes – affect the <b>design</b> <b>elevation</b> process. In contrast with previous studies on raising the status of organizational functions, this research reveals that the same practive can play {{both positive and negative}} roles, and that there are fundamental tensions, which should be reconciled if design’s status is to be elevated. Drawing on the concept of organizational legitimacy, we also examine how design moves beyond being seen as pragmatically useful, to being identified as a relevant, alternative way of operating, to being regarded as essential for success. The article concludes by articulating contributions to design and innovation management theory and practice, and to the body of scholarly work seeking to understand how to elevate the status of a function...|$|E
40|$|Tropospheric ozone {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} phytotoxic air pollutant. The exceedance of Critical Levels set to protect vegetation are quite common in Trentino so that large parts of forests result exposed to potentially harmful levels of ozone. While the potential impact of this pollutant on vegetation is high, its real impact can be assessed in terms of foliar symptoms at the meso- and large-scale and in remote areas by means of ozone-sensitive species. In a previous study, we demonstrated the potential of Viburnum lantana L. (wayfaring tree) for field studies (Gottardini et al., 2010, J. Env. Monit. 12, 2237 - 2243) : it is well known as ozone sensitive, it develops specific, unambiguous foliar symptoms (consisting of interveinal red-purple stippling on upper leaf surface) consistently with the trend of ozone exposure; it is widely distributed across the Alps. On this basis, a new, meso-scale study was launched to investigate whether – under field conditions - consistency exists between ozone exposure levels and response intensity of V. lantana in Trentino, northern Italy. To this purpose, a stratified random sampling <b>design</b> (<b>elevation</b> x ozone) was adopted to select 30 1 x 1 km quadrates on the entire surface of the Trento province (6, 200 km 2). The assessment of symptomatic plants was carried out in 2010 within each quadrate and repeated in 2012 on a subset of 10 quadrates. The frequency of symptomatic plants was higher where ozone levels were also higher. When comparing similar ranges of ozone exposures, symptomatic plants were always more frequent at higher altitude. However, the frequency of symptoms was not always proportionate to the level of ozone exposure. The lack of a statistically significant dose-effect relationship may reflect the complexity of ozone-plant interaction and the inherent large variability of biological response in field conditions. This is, however, the potential of the native bioindicator plants: the ability to identify potentially impacted (or protected) areas beyond the mere values of ozone exposure. In these terms, foliar symptoms on V. lantana are valid response indicators of ozone, suitable for large-scale surveys and on native vegetation in mountain forests...|$|E

30|$|Some {{improvement}} {{measures of the}} technology {{can be considered as}} follows. The first is reducing the drainage velocity to better retain the clay and silt, so the geotextiles can be used to retain the clay and silt and drain the water. The second is changing the technical process of filling reclamation with Yellow River sediment to reconstruct an improved soil profile. Firstly, Yellow River sediment is filled to the reclamation strip at the depth of about 1  m from the ground surface; then about 15 – 20  cm of stripped clay soil is backfilled; thirdly sediment is continuously filled at the <b>designed</b> <b>elevation</b> and then backfilled with surface soil in layers. The soil profile reconstructed in this method would better retain water than the traditional method that doesn’t retain a clayey soil layer between the overlying soil layer and substratum sediment layer. The third is increasing the organic matter content in the overlying soil layer to increase the capacity to hold water. It is suggested that green manure plants can be grown and incorporated for the first 3  years and the wheat straw also added to the soil after harvest.|$|R
