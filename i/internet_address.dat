2500|$|The most {{prominent}} {{component of the}} Internet model is the Internet Protocol (IP), which provides addressing systems, including IP addresses, for computers on the network. IP enables internetworking and, in essence, establishes the Internet itself. Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) is the initial version used on {{the first generation of}} the Internet and is still in dominant use. It was designed to address up to ~4.3billion (109) hosts. However, the explosive growth of the Internet has led to IPv4 address exhaustion, which entered its final stage in 2011, when the global address allocation pool was exhausted. [...] A new protocol version, IPv6, was developed in the mid-1990s, which provides vastly larger addressing capabilities and more efficient routing of Internet traffic. IPv6 is currently in growing deployment around the world, since <b>Internet</b> <b>address</b> registries (RIRs) began to urge all resource managers to plan rapid adoption and conversion.|$|E

5000|$|Conceptually, an Internet {{addresses}} {{consists of}} a netid and a hostid. The netid identifies a network and the hostid identifies a host. The term host is misleading in that an individual computer can have multiple network interfaces each having its own <b>Internet</b> <b>address.</b> An <b>Internet</b> <b>Address</b> identifies {{a connection to the}} network, not an individual computer.

40|$|For {{more than}} 20 years the Internet {{has been based}} on Version 4 of the Internet Protocol (IPv 4). IPv 4 was {{designed}} to accommodate approximately four billion potential <b>Internet</b> <b>addresses</b> using 32 -bits each, which seemed more than adequate back in the 1980 s. 1 As the Internet grew, blocks of <b>Internet</b> <b>addresses</b> were assigned to various organizations and countries. However, by 1995 and 2000 about one-quarter and one-half of all potential <b>Internet</b> <b>addresses</b> were taken, respectively. With the fast {{growth in the number of}} Internet devices, it looked as if IPv 4 addresses would be exhausted. However, researchers and technologists in the Internet standards organizations anticipated this problem in the early 1990 s and developed methods to extend the life of IPv 4. Meanwhile, they also initiated the development of the “next generation ” of IP, an effort that led to the development and standardization of IPv 6 (version 6 of the Internet Protocol) ...|$|R

50|$|In 1998 Thomas Reedy {{recognized}} systematic {{fraud in}} streams of different credit cards being signed up in batches {{from the same}} <b>internet</b> <b>address</b> to the same website.

To preserve his business, Reedy traced the source of the traffic and set up a new web service called Badcard.com to capture card numbers coming from the same <b>internet</b> <b>address,</b> and drew up lists of addresses and card numbers that appeared to be suspiciously used.
