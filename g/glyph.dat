5|$|The {{basic unit}} of Maya hieroglyphic text is the <b>glyph</b> block, which transcribes {{a word or}} phrase. The block is {{composed}} {{of one or more}} individual glyphs attached to each other to form the <b>glyph</b> block, with individual <b>glyph</b> blocks generally being separated by a space. <b>Glyph</b> blocks are usually arranged in a grid pattern. For ease of reference, epigraphers refer to <b>glyph</b> blocks from left to right alphabetically, and top to bottom numerically. Thus, any <b>glyph</b> block in a piece of text can be identified: C4 would be third block counting from the left, and the fourth block counting downwards. If a monument or artefact has more than one inscription, column labels are not repeated, rather they continue in the alphabetic series; if there are more than 26 columns, the labelling continues as A', B', etc. Numeric row labels restart from 1 for each discrete unit of text.|$|E
5|$|Marion J. Shelton, {{an early}} Mormon missionary, {{proposed}} {{the addition of}} a new <b>glyph</b> to represent the schwa, a simple vertical line of the same height as other Deseret characters with a similar appearance to the Turkish dotless i (ı). The addition of this <b>glyph</b> did not catch on among his contemporaries, however, and no document outside of ones penned by Shelton makes use of it. Shelton used the new <b>glyph</b> in an 1860 letter to Brigham Young reporting on a recently completed mission to the Paiute people.|$|E
5|$|To combine glyphs, rongorongo employs {{consistent}} rules. First, the ‘defining feature’ of a <b>glyph</b> is identified, and {{the rest}} is discarded. Then, this ‘defining feature’ is grafted onto a ‘main body’ <b>glyph</b> which retains most of its original shape (except for the addition of the ‘defining feature’). This is done {{in such a way that}} aesthetic unity is maintained. Typically, either one or two ‘defining features’ may be grafted onto a single ‘main body’.|$|E
25|$|There are {{thirteen}} {{full and}} one partial line, containing ~ 2,320 <b>glyphs</b> per Fischer. As of April 2008, the CEIPP counted 2208 legible <b>glyphs,</b> 261 indistinct or partially legible <b>glyphs,</b> and estimated that 35 <b>glyphs</b> had been effaced.|$|R

5|$|There are {{at least}} two {{different}} dependent glyphs used for the concept of a guiding star. The generic Polynesian term is Ihu-ku (Hawaiian) which translates to “standing above the bow”. This concept is associated with the ‘phallic’ dependent <b>glyph.</b> For a specific guiding star used to make landfall on an island, the Polynesian term is hoku ai’aina, which is translated to “stars which ate, ruled the land”. This concept is referred to with the ‘hand’ dependent <b>glyph.</b>|$|E
5|$|This example {{shows how}} the variant forms of the Antares <b>glyph</b> may refer to the rising, culmination, and setting of the star.|$|E
5|$|As Pozdniakov readily admits, his {{analysis}} is highly {{sensitive to the}} accuracy of the <b>glyph</b> inventory. Since he has not published the details of how he established this inventory, it is not possible for others to verify his work.|$|E

5|$|At Calakmul's {{peak in the}} 7th century, {{the polity}} was known as Kan. Interesting {{to know is that}} the title Kan was used at another place before Calakmul became a {{regional}} powerhouse. The Preclassic political state in the Mirador Basin also used the title Kan. There is the idea that, {{after the collapse of the}} Mirador state, its refugees migrated north towards Calakmul, where they founded a new Kan polity. However, epigraphical studies of the monuments at Calakmul show that prior to the 7th century AD the emblem <b>glyph</b> of Calakmul had nothing to do with a snake, but with a bat. It seems that a different polity ruled there. The Kan emblem <b>glyph,</b> before being associated with Calakmul, is found (once) at Dzibanché, a site more towards the east. Perhaps during the late 6th/early 7th century, the polity at Dzibanché moved to Calakmul in order to establish a more strategically placed capital. After Calakmul's power dwindled in the 8th century, after the rule of Yuknoom Took K'awiil, it appears that the bat emblem <b>glyph</b> made its resurgence. Still, many uncertainties remain and new epigraphical studies have to be done to fill the gaps.|$|E
5|$|He also gains {{the ability}} to constrict objects and enemies with a band of energy, {{although}} this feature {{was one of the}} few abilities not to feature in future games. Players can find an ancient relic that gives Raziel the power to fire bolts of telekinetic energy, which cause little damage by themselves but can knock enemies into hazards and push objects from a distance. Baptism in holy flame can transform the Soul Reaver into the Fire Reaver, which can set enemies aflame and adds fire to Raziel's telekinetic bolts. Players can also find magical glyphs that allow Raziel to expend magical energy to attack groups of enemies simultaneously. These glyphs typically involve vampire weaknesses such as sunlight, fire, water, or sound, as well as additions such as telekinetic force (available well before the normal telekinesis becomes available) and the causing of earthquakes to temporarily stun enemies. Glyphs are acquired through finding <b>glyph</b> altars, specific locations in Nosgoth where the skills can be learned, and solving a puzzle before being granted the magical ability. However, Raziel begins the game with access to the 'Shift' <b>glyph,</b> granting {{the ability to}} shift between the material and spectral planes, with no <b>glyph</b> altar necessary.|$|E
5|$|Over ten {{thousand}} stores across forty countries opened for the midnight launch of Halo 4. On {{the evening before}} {{the release of the}} game, a fifty-foot diameter illuminated Didact <b>glyph</b> was flown by a helicopter over the River Thames in London, from the Greenwich Peninsula to Tower Bridge. The <b>glyph</b> was created by a team of over fifty designers, engineers and fabricators and took approximately eight weeks to design and construct. Following the release of the game, New Zealand censors declared many copies of Halo 4 illegal, after deciding to label it with an R13 rating, restricting it to buyers aged 13 and over. Many copies of the game had already gone on sale with an unrestricted M certificate, but these copies are in breach of the Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act 1993.|$|E
2500|$|Nine {{lines of}} <b>glyphs</b> recto, eight verso, for ~ 880 <b>glyphs</b> in all. Pozdniakov found a {{sequence}} of <b>glyphs</b> known from several other tablets that is split between lines Er9 and Ev1, confirming Barthel's reading order.|$|R
500|$|According to Kenneth R. Beesley, who {{submitted}} {{the proposal to}} expand the encoding, [...] "Unicode fonts based on the current heterogeneous collection of <b>glyphs</b> will be useless for any practical typesetting of 40-letter Deseret Alphabet documents." [...] This is because the Unicode Consortium chose to use <b>glyphs</b> from 1855 as the reference <b>glyphs,</b> while by 1859 those <b>glyphs</b> were already outmoded and replaced with newer <b>glyphs.</b> Beesley thus recommends using LaTeX along with his Metafont [...] font to typeset Deseret text, but fonts which use the alternate <b>glyphs</b> for the two codepoints in question would also work for transcription of 40-letter Deseret texts written during and after 1859.|$|R
50|$|Arial Unicode MS also {{includes}} Hebrew <b>glyphs</b> {{different from the}} Hebrew <b>glyphs</b> found in Arial. They {{are based on the}} shapes of the Hebrew <b>glyphs</b> in Tahoma, but are adjusted to the weight, proportions and style of Arial.|$|R
5|$|The glyphs are stylized human, animal, {{vegetable}} and geometric shapes, and often form compounds. Nearly all those with heads are oriented {{head up and}} are either seen face on or in profile to the right, {{in the direction of}} writing. It is not known what significance turning a <b>glyph</b> head-down or to the left may have had. Heads often have characteristic projections on the sides which may be eyes (as on the sea turtle <b>glyph</b> below, and more clearly on sea-turtle petroglyphs) but which often resemble ears (as on the anthropomorphic petroglyph in the next section). Birds are common; many resemble the frigatebird (see image directly below) which was associated with the supreme god Makemake. Other glyphs look like fish or arthropods. A few are similar to petroglyphs found throughout the island.|$|E
5|$|While {{three of}} the four {{directions}} were readily identified, West proved to be more difficult. First, an association was made with the moon goddess Hina, and a Hawaiian story in which her leg was broken. From there, Dietrich postulated that the “broken leg” <b>glyph</b> must in fact be the “pillar of the sunset”.|$|E
5|$|A full long count date {{consisted}} of an introductory <b>glyph</b> followed by five glyphs counting off {{the number of}} bak'tuns, kat'uns, tuns, winals, and k'ins {{since the start of}} the current creation. This would be followed by the tz'olkin portion of the Calendar Round date, and after a number of intervening glyphs, the Long Count date would end with the Haab portion of the Calendar Round date.|$|E
50|$|The styling of Arabic <b>glyphs</b> {{comes from}} Times New Roman, which have more varied stroke widths than the Latin, Greek, Cyrillic <b>glyphs</b> {{found in the}} font. Arial Unicode MS uses {{monotone}} stroke widths on Arabic <b>glyphs,</b> similar to Tahoma.|$|R
2500|$|There are ten {{lines of}} <b>glyphs</b> recto, twelve verso, {{for a total}} of ~ 1,290 <b>glyphs.</b>|$|R

5|$|By the 9th century, {{the crisis}} of the Classic Maya {{collapse}} was sweeping across the region, with populations plummeting and city after city falling into silence. Increasingly endemic warfare in the Maya region caused Tikal's supporting population to heavily concentrate close to the city itself, accelerating the use of intensive agriculture and the corresponding environmental decline. Construction continued {{at the beginning of the}} century, with the erection of Temple 3, the last of the city's major pyramids, and the erection of monuments to mark the 19th K'atun in 810. The beginning of the 10th Bak'tun in 830 passed uncelebrated, and marks the beginning of a 60-year hiatus, probably resulting from the collapse of central control in the city. During this hiatus, satellite sites traditionally under Tikal's control began to erect their own monuments featuring local rulers and using the Mutal emblem <b>glyph,</b> with Tikal apparently lacking the authority or the power to crush these bids for independence. In 849, Jewel K'awiil is mentioned on a stela at Seibal as visiting that city as the Divine Lord of Tikal but he is not recorded elsewhere and Tikal's once-great power was little more than a memory. The sites of Ixlu and Jimbal had by now inherited the once exclusive Mutal emblem <b>glyph.</b>|$|E
5|$|He claimed similar phallic {{triplets}} {{for several}} other texts. However, {{in the majority}} of texts <b>glyph</b> 76 is not common, and Fischer proposed that these were a later, more developed stage of the script, where the creation chants had been abbreviated to X Y Z and omit the phallus. He concluded that 85% of the rongorongo corpus consisted of such creation chants, and that {{it was only a matter}} of time before rongorongo would be fully deciphered.|$|E
5|$|Stela 12 {{is located}} near Structure11. It is badly damaged, having been broken into {{fragment}}s, of which two remain. The largest fragment {{is from the}} lower portion of the stela and depicts the legs and feet of a figure, both facing in the same direction. They stand upon a panel divided into geometric sections, each containing a further design. In front of the legs are {{the remains of a}} <b>glyph</b> that appears to be a number in the bar-and-dot format. A smaller fragment lies nearby.|$|E

50|$|Clip fonts or split fonts are non-Unicode fonts that assign <b>glyphs</b> of Brahmic scripts, such as Devanagari, at code {{positions}} {{intended for}} <b>glyphs</b> of the Latin script or to produce <b>glyphs</b> {{not found in}} Unicode by using its Private Use Area (PUA).|$|R
5|$|Stela 3 {{is badly}} damaged, being broken into three pieces. It was found {{somewhere on the}} San Isidro Piedra Parada {{plantation}} although its exact original location is not known. It was moved to a museum in Guatemala City. The lower portion of the stela depicts two legs facing to the left standing upon a horizontal band divided into three sections, each section containing a symbol or <b>glyph.</b>|$|E
5|$|The cursive {{form of the}} Deseret {{alphabet}} {{was mainly}} used by two people: George D. Watt, and James Henry Martineau. Watt, a stenographer, recorded several bishops meetings and wrote other personal documents in this cursive style. A chart of the cursive form appears below. The blue glyphs represent how to write each character, while the top row of printed glyphs shows the corresponding Unicode reference <b>glyph.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{pictures}} and glyphs were painted by skilled craftsmen using thin brushes and vegetable dyes. Black and red {{were the main}} colors used {{for many of the}} pages. Some pages have detailed backgrounds in shades of yellow, green, and the Mayan blue. The codex was written by eight different scribes, who all had their own writing style, <b>glyph</b> designs, and subject matter.|$|E
5000|$|Vectors fields can be {{inspected}} by applying <b>glyphs</b> (arrows, cones, lines, spheres, and various 2D <b>glyphs)</b> to the {{points in a}} dataset. The <b>glyphs</b> can be scaled by scalars, vector component or vector magnitude and can be oriented using a vector field.|$|R
40|$|Parallel Coordinates are a {{powerful}} method for visualizing multidimensional data but, {{when applied to}} large data sets, they become cluttered and difficult to read. Star <b>Glyphs,</b> on the other hand, {{can be used to}} display either the attributes of a data item or the values across all items for a single attribute. Star <b>Glyphs</b> may readily provide a quick impression; however, since the full data set will require multiple <b>glyphs,</b> overall readings are more difficult. We present Parallel <b>Glyphs,</b> an interactive integration of the visual representations of Parallel Coordinates and Star <b>Glyphs</b> that utilizes the advantages of both representations to offset the disadvantages they have separately. We discuss the role of uniform and stepped colour scales in the visual comparison of non-adjacent items and Star <b>Glyphs.</b> Parallel <b>Glyphs</b> provide capabilities for focus-in-context exploration using two types of lenses and interactions specific to the 3 D space...|$|R
50|$|CJK, or Chinese, Japanese and Korean typefaces {{consist of}} wide-ranging sets of <b>glyphs.</b> They include {{all of the}} ASCII, European Roman <b>glyphs</b> and Cyrillic <b>glyphs</b> and often Persian, Hebrew and Arabic. Most uniquely, however, their native {{character}} set's <b>glyphs</b> are designed to fit within a square. This is somewhat similar to monospaced type faces, but allows for vertical, horizontal, right-to-left and left-to-right orientation. They also include a set of Extended Latin characters with <b>glyphs</b> and metrics redesigned for the square {{in addition to the}} standard variety. This commonly results in complex, often conflicting rules and conventions of mixing languages in type.|$|R
