5|$|Amphetamine is {{frequently}} measured in urine or blood {{as part of}} a <b>drug</b> test for sports, employment, poisoning diagnostics, and forensics. Techniques such as immunoassay, which is {{the most common form of}} amphetamine test, may cross-react with a number of sympathomimetic drugs. Chromatographic methods specific for amphetamine are employed to prevent false positive results. Chiral separation techniques may be employed to help distinguish the source of the <b>drug,</b> whether prescription amphetamine, prescription amphetamine prodrugs, (e.g., selegiline), over-the-counter <b>drug</b> products that contain levomethamphetamine, or illicitly obtained substituted amphetamines. Several prescription drugs produce amphetamine as a metabolite, including benzphetamine, clobenzorex, famprofazone, fenproporex, lisdexamfetamine, mesocarb, methamphetamine, prenylamine, and selegiline, among others. These compounds may produce positive results for amphetamine on <b>drug</b> tests. Amphetamine is generally only detectable by a standard <b>drug</b> test for approximately 24hours, although a high dose may be detectable for days.|$|E

During the investigation they find a high-class prostitute hiding in a nearby doghouse. After making unsuccessful advances on Bolander, she admits the <b>drug</b> dealer was killed by his own bodyguard, Newton Stuart (Richard Pelzman). After arresting him, Stuart says the other shooting victim used the <b>drug</b> dealer as a human shield. In a misguided attempt to follow his employer's orders to kill anyone who threatens him, Stuart said he shot through the <b>drug</b> dealer to ensure the man threatening him would also be shot.|$|E
5|$|<b>Drug</b> {{overdose}} and intoxication {{are significant}} causes of accidental death, {{and can also}} be used as a form of suicide. Death can occur from overdosing on a single or multiple drugs, or from combined <b>drug</b> intoxication (CDI) due to poly <b>drug</b> use. Poly <b>drug</b> use often carries more risk than use of a single <b>drug,</b> due to an increase in side effects, and <b>drug</b> synergy. For example, the chance of death from overdosing on opiates is greatly increased when they are consumed in conjunction with alcohol. While they are two distinct phenomena, deaths from CDI are often misreported as overdoses. <b>Drug</b> overdoses and intoxication can also cause indirect deaths. For example, while marijuana does not cause fatal overdoses, being intoxicated by it can increase the chance of fatal traffic collisions.|$|E

Having succeeded outside of Mexico, Treviño Morales was appointed by Lazcano Lazcano as the national commander of Los Zetas, a position traditionally reserved to Zetas members with military background.

50|$|To {{solve the}} {{problems}} associated with multidrug-resistance by MDR1, different types of <b>drugs</b> can be used or the ABC transporters themselves must be inhibited. For other types of <b>drugs</b> to work they must bypass the resistance mechanism, which is the ABC transporter. To do this other anticancer <b>drugs</b> can be utilized such as alkylating <b>drugs</b> (cyclophosphamide), antimetabolites (5-fluorouracil), and the anthracycline modified <b>drugs</b> (annamycin and doxorubicin-peptide). These <b>drugs</b> would not function as a substrate of ABC transporters, and would thus not be transported. The other option is to use a combination of ABC inhibitory <b>drugs</b> and the anticancer <b>drugs</b> at the same time. This would reverse the resistance to the anticancer <b>drugs</b> so that they could function as intended. The substrates that reverse the resistance to anticancer <b>drugs</b> are called chemosensitizers.|$|R
