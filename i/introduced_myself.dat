5|$|As {{teacher and}} player, Byard was renowned for his {{knowledge}} of the history of jazz piano. This meant that some aspiring young musicians sought him out as a teacher. One of these was pianist Jason Moran, who described their first meeting, at a performance by the Apollo Stompers: Jaki had all these toys and whistles and bells and things that he was playing from the piano, and also screaming and yelling from the piano in joy. I remember thinking, 'This guy's out of his mind.' After the set, I went up to him, <b>introduced</b> <b>myself,</b> and said that I would be studying with him. He said something to the effect of, 'get ready'. Moran studied with Byard for four years, and credits the older man with developing his skills, building his awareness of jazz history, and creating his willingness to experiment with different styles. Another student, Fred Hersch, reported that Byard was both organized and chaotic as a teacher: giving his students worksheets and having them study early stride piano, but also behaving eccentrically and missing lessons. Classical composer Bruce Wolosoff was taught by Byard at the New England Conservatory and counts him as an important influence.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{exception}} of her formative years when she was crowned a beauty queen, Peniston was struggling with her last name, constantly. [...] "When I first got in this business, People were actually erupting in fits of laughter when I <b>introduced</b> <b>myself,</b> but I was comfortable with who I was, but that was an issue for the record company," [...] she disclosed in 2006. [...] "But see {{in this day and}} age where I'm at, it wouldn't be a problem for the record company, I'm going to make sure that it's not. But for somebody who's getting into the business, realize that you're a commodity, and if the record company's investing in you, make sure you that you invest in yourself. Look is important because people see the physical first," [...] she was advising up-comers in the 5 Magazine interview.|$|E
2500|$|When Mrs. Rodenhurst {{told me of}} {{the advent}} to Shrewsbury of Wainwright, I asked her {{if he was in}} his room, or where. 'No,' she said, 'he went out about an hour ago. I think you'll find him in the King's Arms.' I went to the King's Arms and made my very first {{appearance}} in the bar-parlour of a public-house. The room was empty save for one man, dressed in blue serge, with a shrewd lean face. I recognised him. I had seen him playing for Yorkshire at Old Trafford. I <b>introduced</b> <b>myself.</b> 'I'm the assistant pro.,' I explained. 'Art thou?' he replied, 'well, then 'ave a drink wi' me.' I told him I didn't drink — only ginger ale. 'Christ,' he said, 'tha'rt a reight bloody cricketer.' He was a tall man, who walked as though he didn't care a damn for anybody. There was something sinister about him. Every night he got drunk as a matter of course, quietly and masterfully. One day he backed a winner at a glorious price, and towards eleven o'clock that night he and the drill-sergeant of the school arrived arm-in-arm (supporting one another) in the sitting-room of our lodgings. Very gravely Ted introduced me to the drill-sergeant, whom of course I knew very well. The drill-sergeant as gravely introduced Ted to me, then taking my arm, he whispered rather noisily in my ear, 'I'm 'fraid 'e's a l'il drunk, so I've jus' bror him h-home.' Whereupon Ted dissolved into helpless laughter and said, 'My dear sersergeant, don't be 'diculous[...] [...] [...] Bror me home? Why, you ole fool, it's me that's bror you 'ome.' Then (aside), 'E's jus' a l'il drunk, so I've bror him home.' The sergeant hooted with glee. 'Bless m' soul,' he said, 'Ted; jus' lis'en t'me. If you'd bror me home, this would be my lodgin's, see? I would be 'ome, not you. See? But this is your lodgin's—so I mus' 'ave bror you 'ome. See?' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, sir, on Martha's Vineyard--for that's {{the place}} I come from. Perhaps I {{ought to have}} <b>introduced</b> <b>myself</b> a little more particularly--I come from Martha's Vineyard, and my name is Daggett." ...|$|E
60|$|Such {{were the}} companions to whom I <b>introduced</b> <b>myself</b> shortly after; and, while they {{went off to}} the office, I amused myself in looking round the rooms in which I was to spend the {{approaching}} winter.|$|E

6000|$|He was, I think, {{surprised}} to see me. When I {{came into the room}} where he was, and <b>introduced</b> <b>myself,</b> he took me by the shoulder, and turned my face round to the light, and said, after a sharp scrutiny, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{ought to}} have <b>introduced</b> <b>myself.</b> I am Miss Lovel, and the rector of Yoxham is my brother. It does not signify about the maid in the least. We can do very well with her. I suppose she has been with you a long time." ...|$|E
6000|$|Returning to the street, I <b>introduced</b> <b>myself</b> to Uncle Billy Fraser and Osmund Button {{and other}} Sun Prairie neighbors {{and when it}} became known that [...] "Dick Garland's boy" [...] was in town, many friends {{gathered}} about to shake my hand and inquire concerning [...] "Belle" [...] and [...] "Dick." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Let me <b>introduce</b> <b>myself,</b> Mr. Bird. I am Dick Rover, {{and these}} are my brothers. Sam and Tom. These are my friends, Fred Garrison and John Powell." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I cannot {{think how}} it came into my head. The fact is, I lost my {{presence}} of mind. You know he was my tutor at Christchurch, when poor dear Herbert and I were such friends, and very kind he was to us both; and so, the moment I saw him, I walked across the House, <b>introduced</b> <b>myself,</b> {{and asked him to}} dinner.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{went to see}} Pickering {{the next}} day, at his inn, and on knocking, as directed, at his door, was {{surprised}} to {{hear the sound of}} a loud voice within. My knock remained unnoticed, so I presently <b>introduced</b> <b>myself.</b> I found no company, but I discovered my friend walking up and down the room and apparently declaiming to himself from a little volume bound in white vellum. He greeted me heartily, threw his book on the table, and said that he was taking a German lesson.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{only just}} pulled through! A very small slip nearly lost me everything. I {{believed}} {{you were going}} to Schloss Planta that day, not to Schloss Lebenstein. You changed your mind en route. That might have spoiled all. Happily I perceived it, rode up by the short cut, and arrived somewhat hurriedly and hotly at the gate before you. Then I <b>introduced</b> <b>myself.</b> I had one more bad moment when the rival claimant to my name and title intruded into the room. But fortune favours the brave: your utter ignorance of German saved me. The rest was pap. It went by itself almost.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then let him {{go through}} with it. It's no affair of mine. After all, your father's affairs don't concern me. It would be impertinent of me to <b>introduce</b> <b>myself</b> into them." ...|$|R
60|$|This {{could not}} be gainsaid; and to a man {{connected}} with the Carlist organization the shortest way was to <b>introduce</b> <b>myself</b> as that “Monsieur George” of whom he had probably heard.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me <b>introduce</b> <b>myself</b> first," [...] said Roger. He {{gave his}} name and also those of his chums. [...] "I am the nephew of the late Maurice Harrison, of this place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{could be}} little {{need for a}} spirit of prophecy," [...] Sir Thomas made answer, to [...] "foresee {{troubles}} which were the sure effect of the causes then in operation, and which were actually close at hand. When the rain is gathering from the south or west, and those flowers and herbs which serve as natural hygrometers close their leaves, men have no occasion to consult the stars for what the clouds and the earth are telling them. You were thinking of Prince Arthur when I <b>introduced</b> <b>myself</b> yesterday, as if musing upon the great events which seem to have received their bias from the apparent accident of his premature death." ...|$|E
60|$|The Travellers {{were all}} assembled, the cloth was laid, and Ben {{had brought a}} great billet of wood, and had laid it artfully {{on the top of}} the fire, so that a touch or two of the poker after supper should make a roaring blaze. Having {{deposited}} my brown beauty in a red nook of the hearth, inside the fender, where she soon began to sing like an ethereal cricket, diffusing at the same time odours as of ripe vineyards, spice forests, and orange groves,--I say, having stationed my beauty in a place of security and improvement, I <b>introduced</b> <b>myself</b> to my guests by shaking hands all round, and giving them a hearty welcome.|$|E
6000|$|She shrunk back in alarm. What {{would the}} landlady think if {{she saw her}} lodger enter the house at night in company with a {{stranger}}, and that stranger a gentleman? The landlady appeared as she made the objection. Reckless what I said or what I did, I <b>introduced</b> <b>myself</b> as her relative, and asked to be shown into a quiet room in which I could write a letter. After one sharp glance at me, the landlady appeared to be satisfied that she was dealing with a gentleman. She led the way {{into a sort of}} parlor behind the [...] "bar," [...] placed writing materials on the table, looked at my companion as only one woman can look at another under certain circumstances, and left us by ourselves.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must allow}} me to <b>introduce</b> <b>myself,</b> Miss Fregelius," [...] he said with an old-fashioned and courtly bow, [...] "and to explain that I have the honour to be my son's father." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Permit me, Mr. Courage," [...] he said, [...] "to <b>introduce</b> <b>myself.</b> My name is Stanley, James Stanley, and I {{come from}} Liverpool. Waiter, two best Scotch whiskies, {{and a large}} Schweppe's soda." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{not even}} an acquaintance," [...] said the man, smiling. [...] "But I am {{interested}} in him, through {{a friend of mine}} who met him abroad. Permit me to <b>introduce</b> <b>myself,</b> sir." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly, with {{a little}} help from the police, which they will gladly furnish. They know I'm Daddy's daughter, for I have already <b>introduced</b> <b>myself</b> to them, and while they may be slow to take the {{initiative}} they are always quite willing to aid in an affair of this sort. Now, it stands to reason, Mary Louise, that the nurse didn't use the streets to promenade with. Alora. That would have been dangerous to her plans. There are so few people abroad in Chicago at six o'clock in the morning that those who met the two would have noted and remembered them. For the same reason Mrs. Orme did not take a street car, or the elevated. Therefore, she took a cab, and the cabman who drove them will know Mrs. Orme's address." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{will not}} {{spend much time}} on {{this part of the}} story. By means of the ring I was accorded an {{interview}} with the regent. She was then an old woman over seventy years of age. When I <b>introduced</b> <b>myself</b> to her and told her my errand, she became very angry. 'I remember very well,' she said, 'the person you speak of, and he is long since dead. He was an old man when I took him into my service. You may be his son or some one else who has heard how he was employed by me. At any rate, you are an impostor. How did you come into possession of this ring? The man to whom I gave it had no right to keep it. He should have returned it to me when he had performed his duties.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are badly hurt, lad, {{and must}} lie {{perfectly}} quiet. Luckily the messenger who {{was sent to}} fetch a doctor, seeing Mr. Curtis and me walking up the street, ran up {{to us and said}} that a young officer of our ship was hurt, and that he was sent in to fetch a doctor. He had, in fact, already seen one, and was in the act of returning with him when he met us. Of course I <b>introduced</b> <b>myself</b> to the French doctor as we came along together, for we fortunately got hold of a trap directly, so that no time was lost. The black boy who brought the message told me that you and a young lady had been bitten by a great hound belonging to his master, and that you had killed it. Now, my lad, I am going to cut off your coat and look at your wounds. The Frenchman is attending to the young lady." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{thought it}} was my husband. It is only his wife. You must let me <b>introduce</b> <b>myself.</b> I know you quite well by your photographs. I think my husband has got {{seventeen}} of them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As we {{seem likely}} to see {{something}} of one another {{during the next few}} days, nolens volens," [...] he remarked, [...] "may I <b>introduce</b> <b>myself?</b> My name is Wrayson, Herbert Wrayson, and I come from London." ...|$|R
