2500|$|Small and {{harmless}} to humans, the Arabian carpetshark {{is one of}} the few shark species {{suitable for}} private aquaria. It is collected for the aquarium trade, which is not believed to pose a substantial threat to its population. The meat and possibly the fins of this shark can be used, but because of its size most individuals landed are discarded. It is captured incidentally in intertidal hadra (artisanal stake-net traps), as well as in demersal trammel and trawl nets. The Arabian carpetshark forms the predominant component of the [...] "cat shark" [...] catch of Kuwaiti prawn trawls, which represents the second-largest bycatch (14% of total) of the fishery. It is also caught off Bahrain and likely elsewhere. Another potentially major threat to this species is habitat degradation: coral reefs in the Persian Gulf face bottom trawling, coastal development (especially large-scale land reclamation projects such as in the United Arab Emirates), Turkish dams on the Tigris-Euphrates river system, <b>draining</b> <b>of</b> <b>marshes</b> in Iraq, and oil spills. Coastal habitats off India are also similarly pressured. As both fishing and habitat degradation are likely to intensify in the region, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the Arabian carpetshark as Near Threatened.|$|E

50|$|The <b>draining</b> <b>of</b> Mesopotamian <b>Marshes</b> {{began in}} the 1950s with the Central Marshes and {{gradually}} accelerated as it affected the two other main marshes until early {{in the 21st century}} with the 2003 invasion <b>of</b> Iraq. The <b>draining</b> <b>of</b> the <b>marshes</b> was intended at first to reclaim land for agriculture along with oil exploration but later served as a punishment for Shia Arabs in response to the 1991 uprisings in Iraq. The <b>draining</b> <b>of</b> the <b>marshes</b> was largely due to dams, dykes and other diversion structures constructed into Iraq but were exacerbated by upstream dam construction in Syria and Turkey.|$|R
50|$|On 2 May 1886, Alfredo d’Escragnolle Taunay, {{president}} of Paraná province opened this, Curitaba's first public park and zoo. It was created through the <b>draining</b> <b>of</b> <b>marsh</b> land. Within the green area, there are lakes, islands and bridges. The zoo shelters small animals.

50|$|Most of the {{newcomers}} were young halutzim (pioneers), who built roads and towns and commenced the <b>draining</b> <b>of</b> <b>marshes</b> in the Jezreel Valley and the Hefer Plain. Afterwards {{they became a}} smaller proportion of the immigrants. The importance of those pioneers was just as great {{as that of the}} pioneers of the Second Aliyah. Their ideology contributed a great deal to the construction of the Palestine, and so they imprinted their mark on Zionism and also {{on the development of the}} Jewish settlements in the country of Israel.|$|E
5000|$|The natural predators of {{the marsh}} deer [...] - [...] the jaguar (locally called onça or yaguaraté) (Panthera onca) and the puma (Puma concolor) - [...] have almost {{completely}} disappeared from its habitat. The former major threat was poaching for its antlers, but this is somewhat under control. Destruction of its habitat presents nowadays the major threat to marsh deer. The Yacyretá Dam altered {{an area in which}} several hundred individuals lived and the <b>draining</b> <b>of</b> <b>marshes</b> for farmland and cattle threaten hundreds of hectares every year in Argentina and Brazil. Contagious diseases from cattle are also a problem, though {{it has been shown that}} the deer is not affected by brucellosis.|$|E
50|$|The <b>draining</b> <b>of</b> the Qurna <b>Marshes</b> {{also called}} The <b>Draining</b> <b>of</b> the Mesopotamian <b>Marshes</b> {{occurred}} in Iraq {{and to a}} smaller degree in Iran between the 1950s and 1990s to clear large areas <b>of</b> the <b>marshes</b> in the Tigris-Euphrates river system. Formerly covering an area of around 20,000 km2 (7,700 sq mi), the large complex of wetlands was 90% drained prior to the 2003 Invasion <b>of</b> Iraq. The <b>marshes</b> are typically divided into three main sub-marshes, the Hawizeh, Central, and Hammar Marshes and all three were drained at different times for different reasons. Initial <b>draining</b> <b>of</b> the Central <b>Marshes</b> was intended to reclaim land for agriculture but later all three marshes would become a tool of war and revenge.|$|R

5000|$|From ancient times, people {{suspected}} that the climate of a region could change {{over the course of}} centuries. For example, Theophrastus, a pupil of Aristotle, told how the <b>draining</b> <b>of</b> <b>marshes</b> had made a particular locality more susceptible to freezing, and speculated that lands became warmer when the clearing of forests exposed them to sunlight. Renaissance and later scholars saw that deforestation, irrigation, and grazing had altered the lands around the Mediterranean since ancient times; they thought it plausible that these human interventions had affected the local weather. Vitruvius, in the first century BC, describes a series of ancient cities that lined the Anatolian peninsula from south to north along the Aegean sea, he then comments that they long ago were engulfed by the seas [...] - presently these ancient cities [...] are again out of water.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the middle}} of the 19th century the village {{underwent}} major changes. Under the leadership of the Mayor, Dr. Théodore Labbey, significant work was undertaken including: the <b>draining</b> <b>of</b> <b>marshes,</b> the construction of a Levee, and many large houses - some of which remain today. Asnelles becomes Asnelles-la-Belle-Plage, a name given by many swimmers at the beach which took the appearance of a [...] "small Trouville", according to the newspapers of the time, with its casino and its up-market hotels. The beach resort was served by the Chemins de Fer du Calvados (Railways of Calvados) from 1899 to 1932. The construction of a Preventorium for children with tuberculosis who had a parent working at the SNCF was imposed on the commune in 1926. Until the eve of the Second World War it accommodated more than 1,500 boys and girls.|$|E
50|$|By 1650, English {{agriculture}} {{had also}} become commercialized {{on a much}} wider scale. The last peace-time famine in England was in 1623-24. There were still periods of hunger, as in the Netherlands, but no more famines ever occurred. Common areas for pasture were enclosed for private use and large scale, efficient farms were consolidated. Other technical developments included the <b>draining</b> <b>of</b> <b>marshes,</b> more efficient field use patterns, and the wider introduction of industrial crops. These agricultural developments led to wider prosperity in England and increasing urbanization. By {{the end of the}} 17th century, English agriculture was the most productive in Europe. In both England and the Netherlands, the population stabilized between 1650 and 1750, the same time period in which the sweeping changes to agriculture occurred. Famine still occurred in other parts of Europe, however. In East Europe, famines occurred as late as the twentieth century.|$|E

30|$|The {{belief that}} humans can induce climate and {{meteorological}} changes by altering vegetation has appeared throughout history (Hulme 2017). In ancient Greece, Theophrastus (371 – 287  BCE) argued that Greece had experienced climatic change {{due to the}} <b>draining</b> <b>of</b> <b>marshes</b> and extension of agriculture (Glacken 1976). The link between vegetation and climate emerged elsewhere around the world at different times. It reached its greatest extent and popularity in the 1850 s to 1880 s when scientists, politicians {{and members of the}} public throughout the Western world advocated that forests influenced regional climate and rainfall (Grove 1995; Barton 2002; Davis 2007; 2016; Beattie 2011; Cushman 2011). During this age, the destruction of nature from globalization and colonialism created considerable anxieties, akin to our own fears of global warming and tropical deforestation (Beattie 2011). The belief that forests needed to be protected to stabilize climate influenced the rise of the first global environmental movement (Barton 2002) and led to the establishment of protected and productive forest areas worldwide (Bennett 2015).|$|E
40|$|The first {{segment of}} this {{broadcast}} discusses some {{environmental effects of}} the first Gulf War, in which intense fires and oil spilled on the desert sands combined to form a hard coating known as 'tarcrete'. It explains how removing the tarcrete and movement of vehicles removes the layer of natural small pebbles on the desert's surface, leaving it vulnerable to erosion. Other topics include the <b>draining</b> <b>of</b> <b>marshes</b> and coating of coral reefs in the Persian Gulf with oil. This broadcast is 18 minutes in length.
