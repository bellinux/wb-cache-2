6000|$|Thus challenged, the {{prominent}} author pulled himself together. [...] "Oh," [...] he said, sadly, [...] "which of us knows {{whether he has}} natural ability or not, and what is education, and what is life as one sees it, and what is technical training? Do these poor young fellows think that one is tall or short by taking thought? It {{is the same as}} that, it seems to me; or <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>a</b> mystical solution, I should say, if you have a longing, from your earliest consciousness, to write poetry or fiction, and cannot keep from doing it for any long time together, you are possibly born with a gift for it. But this may be altogether a mistake; it may be the effect of your early and incessant scribblings on the minds of spectators wholly incompetent to judge of your abilities, such as your fond parents. This must rather often happen if we can judge from what nine-tenths of what is called literature is composed of. If your longing to write is the real thing, or is not, still education will not help or hinder you in doing it. No man was ever yet taught any art. He may be taught a trade, and that is what most of the versing and prosing is, I suppose. If you have the gift, you will technically train yourself: that is, you will learn how to be simple and clear and honest. Charm you will have got from your great-grandfather or great-grandmother; and life, which is only another sort of school, will not qualify you to depict life; but if {{you do not want to}} depict life, you will perhaps be able to meet the demands of what our friend calls the current editors." ...|$|E

50|$|Beginning {{with his}} {{groundbreaking}} ‘Intransitivity and the Mere Addition Paradox,’ and culminating in his magnum opus, Rethinking the Good: Moral Ideals, and the Nature of Practical Reasoning, Temkin {{has given a}} series of powerful arguments that call into question deeply held assumptions about value and {{about the nature of}} practical reasoning that {{play a central role in}} philosophy and in decision theory. According to decision theory, rational preferences must satisfy four fundamental axioms: Completeness (requiring preferences over, or indifference between, any pair of outcomes), Independence (requiring that one’s preference between a given pair of options does not depend on what other options are available), Continuity (requiring that if one prefers A to B and B to C, then one is indifferent between B and some gamble in which A and C are the two possible outcomes), and Transitivity (requiring that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>A</b> to B and B to C, then you prefer A to C). Temkin's arguments have called into question each one of these fundamental axioms, and his recent manuscript can be seen as a systematic account of the ways in which these axioms fail in cases involving moral reasoning. Thus, in addition to shedding light on the complexities of the moral domain, it arguably constitutes the most thorough challenge to the standard formal theory of practical rationality.|$|E

30|$|Radiology, {{or medical}} imaging <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>prefer,</b> is <b>an</b> ‘over-published’ field. This implies {{that there are}} many {{journals}} dedicated to imaging and, in the view of some, maybe even too many journals. Thomson Reuters, the company behind the Web of Science and the journal impact factors, is very critical about allowing new journals to be included in their index. Specifically, it has become very difficult to be included as a new journal if the expected IF is less than 1. Given the short lifespan of ‘Insights into Imaging’, it is to be expected that currently our IF is not sufficiently high to warrant inclusion in the Thomson Reuters’ list and to receive an impact factor. Furthermore, after a negative decision, the journal would be forced into a 3 -year waiting period before re-application is possible.|$|R
