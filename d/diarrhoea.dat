5|$|In 1943, Jacob Light and Horace Hodes {{proved that}} a {{filterable}} {{agent in the}} faeces of children with infectious <b>diarrhoea</b> also caused scours (livestock <b>diarrhoea)</b> in cattle. Three decades later, preserved samples of the agent were shown to be rotavirus. In the intervening years, a virus in mice was shown {{to be related to}} the virus causing scours. In 1973, Ruth Bishop and colleagues described related viruses found in children with gastroenteritis.|$|E
5|$|NSP4 is a viral {{enterotoxin}} that induces <b>diarrhoea</b> and was {{the first}} viral enterotoxin discovered.|$|E
5|$|Rotaviral {{enteritis}} is a mild {{to severe}} disease characterised by nausea, vomiting, watery <b>diarrhoea</b> and low-grade fever. Once {{a child is}} infected by the virus, there is an incubation period of about two days before symptoms appear. The period of illness is acute. Symptoms often start with vomiting followed by four to eight days of profuse <b>diarrhoea.</b> Dehydration {{is more common in}} rotavirus infection than in most of those caused by bacterial pathogens, and is {{the most common cause of}} death related to rotavirus infection.|$|E
5|$|Rotavirus A, which {{accounts}} for more than 90% of rotavirus gastroenteritis in humans, is endemic worldwide. Each year rotavirus causes millions of cases of <b>diarrhoea</b> in developing countries, almost 2million of which result in hospitalisation. In 2013, an estimated 215,000 children younger than five died from rotavirus, 90 percent of whom were in developing countries. Almost every child has been infected with rotavirus by age five. Rotavirus is the leading single cause of severe <b>diarrhoea</b> among infants and children, is responsible for {{about a third of the}} cases requiring hospitalisation, and causes 37% of deaths attributable to <b>diarrhoea</b> and 5% of all deaths in children younger than five. Boys are twice as likely as girls to be admitted to hospital for rotavirus.|$|E
5|$|Rotavirus B, {{also called}} adult <b>diarrhoea</b> {{rotavirus}} or ADRV, has caused major epidemics of severe <b>diarrhoea</b> affecting {{thousands of people}} of all ages in China. These epidemics occurred as a result of sewage contamination of drinking water. Rotavirus B infections also occurred in India in 1998; the causative strain was named CAL. Unlike ADRV, the CAL strain is endemic. To date, epidemics caused by rotavirus B have been confined to mainland China, and surveys indicate a lack of immunity to this species in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Rotavirus C {{has been}} {{associated}} with rare and sporadic cases of <b>diarrhoea</b> in children, and small outbreaks have occurred in families.|$|E
5|$|During 2005, {{the largest}} {{recorded}} epidemic of <b>diarrhoea</b> occurred in Nicaragua. This unusually large and severe outbreak {{was associated with}} mutations in the rotavirus A genome, possibly helping the virus escape the prevalent immunity in the population. A similar large outbreak occurred in Brazil in 1977.|$|E
5|$|Outbreaks of {{rotavirus}} A <b>diarrhoea</b> {{are common}} among hospitalised infants, young children attending day care centres, and elderly people in nursing homes. An outbreak caused by contaminated municipal water occurred in Colorado in 1981.|$|E
5|$|Burston {{believed}} in personal reconnaissance and {{leading from the}} front. He was {{at the forefront of}} providing the medical arrangements for Operation Compass. He attempted, in the face of equipment shortages, to anticipate medical problems and so far as possible to prevent or avoid them. He dispatched Major Ian Murray Mackerras to investigate fly breeding in order to prevent an outbreak of <b>diarrhoea.</b> Burston gave Mackerras a free hand to tackle hygiene problems.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{medical care}} applies to other acute health {{problems}} as well. Many illnesses with time-sensitive elements {{are common in}} developing countries, including severe infections, hypoxia caused by respiratory infections, dehydration caused by <b>diarrhoea,</b> intentional and unintentional injuries, postpartum bleeding, and acute myocardial infarction. These are potentially life-threatening conditions, yet effective treatment is often unavailable {{for much of the}} world's population.|$|E
5|$|Geophagy, the {{practice}} of eating soil or rock, has been observed in orangutans. There are three main reasons for this dietary behaviour: for the addition of mineral nutrients to their diet; for the ingestion of clay minerals that can absorb toxic substances; or to treat a disorder such as <b>diarrhoea.</b> Orangutans also use plants of the genus Commelina as an anti-inflammatory balm.|$|E
5|$|Systemic {{symptoms}} {{resulting from}} anaphylaxis can be dramatic. These may appear within 5 minutes post bite, {{or can be}} delayed for many hours. Such symptoms include nausea, retching and vomiting, abdominal colic and <b>diarrhoea,</b> incontinence of urine and faeces, sweating, fever, vasoconstriction, tachycardia, lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, blindness, shock, angioedema of the face, lips, gums, tongue, throat and epiglottis, urticaria and bronchospasm. If left untreated, these symptoms may persist or fluctuate for up to 48 hours. In severe cases, cardiovascular failure may occur.|$|E
5|$|Transient {{increased}} bowel frequency, <b>diarrhoea,</b> constipation or minor rectal bleeding, {{may also}} occur. Acute and subacute side effects usually resolve over {{a matter of}} days or a few weeks. In the case of permanent (seed) brachytherapy for prostate cancer, there is a small chance that some seeds may migrate out of the treatment region into the bladder or urethra and be passed in the urine.|$|E
5|$|As he neared his {{eleventh}} birthday, Gloucester {{was assigned}} the rooms in Kensington Palace {{that had been}} used by his aunt, Queen Mary, who died in 1694. At his birthday party at Windsor, on 24 July 1700, he complained of a sudden fatigue, but was initially thought to have overheated himself while dancing. By nightfall, he was suffering from a sore throat and chills, followed by a severe headache and a high fever the next day. A physician, Hannes, did not arrive until 27 July. Gloucester was immediately bled, but his condition continued to deteriorate. Over the next day, he developed a rash and suffered a bout of <b>diarrhoea.</b> A second physician, Gibbons, arrived early on 28 July, followed by Radcliffe that evening.|$|E
5|$|By mid-February the {{symptoms}} of those involved were deteriorating; their symptoms included burn wounds, swollen hands, <b>diarrhoea,</b> fever, and hair loss. One of the scrap collectors went to Samut Prakan Hospital on 15 February and was admitted the next day, while the two scrapyard employees were also admitted, on 16 and 17 February. The scrapyard owner's husband was admitted to Bangkok General Hospital on 17 February due to epistaxis (nosebleeds), while the scrapyard owner, her mother, and her maid (all of whom {{lived across the street}} from the scrapyard and sometimes entered) also began to feel ill. A stray dog that was often seen in the scrapyard also died.|$|E
5|$|Chastened by this experience, {{he agreed}} to submit to any {{procedure}} that would cure his appetite, and was treated with laudanum, tobacco pills, wine vinegar and soft-boiled eggs. The procedures failed, and doctors could not keep him on a controlled diet; he would sneak {{out of the hospital}} to scavenge for offal in gutters, rubbish heaps and outside butchers' shops, and attempted to drink the blood of other patients in the hospital and to eat the corpses in the hospital morgue. After being suspected of eating a toddler he was ejected from the hospital. He reappeared four years later in Versailles suffering from severe tuberculosis, and died shortly afterwards, following a lengthy bout of exudative <b>diarrhoea.</b>|$|E
5|$|Culture {{techniques}} {{are designed to}} promote the growth and identify particular bacteria, while restricting {{the growth of the}} other bacteria in the sample. Often these {{techniques are}} designed for specific specimens; for example, a sputum sample will be treated to identify organisms that cause pneumonia, while stool specimens are cultured on selective media to identify organisms that cause <b>diarrhoea,</b> while preventing growth of non-pathogenic bacteria. Specimens that are normally sterile, such as blood, urine or spinal fluid, are cultured under conditions designed to grow all possible organisms. Once a pathogenic organism has been isolated, it can be further characterised by its morphology, growth patterns (such as aerobic or anaerobic growth), patterns of hemolysis, and staining.|$|E
5|$|Emus {{can suffer}} from both {{external}} and internal parasites, but under farmed conditions are more parasite-free than ostriches or rheas. External parasites include the louse Dahlemhornia asymmetrica and various other lice, ticks, mites and flies. Chicks sometimes suffer from intestinal tract infections caused by coccidian protozoa, and the nematode Trichostrongylus tenuis infects the emu {{as well as a}} wide range of other birds, causing haemorrhagic <b>diarrhoea.</b> Other nematodes are found in the trachea and bronchi; Syngamus trachea causing haemorrhagic tracheitis and Cyathostoma variegatum causing serious respiratory problems in juveniles.|$|E
5|$|Excessive {{production}} of the thyroid hormones is called hyperthyroidism, which is most commonly a result of Graves' disease, a toxic multinodular goitre, a solitary thyroid adenoma, or inflammation. Other causes include drug-induced excess of iodine, particularly from amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic medication; an excess caused by the preferential uptake of iodine by the thyroid following iodinated contrast imaging; or from pituitary adenomas which may cause an over{{production of}} thyroid stimulating hormone. Hyperthyroidism often causes a variety of non-specific symptoms including weight loss, increased appetite, insomnia, decreased tolerance of heat, tremor, palpitations, anxiety and nervousness. In some cases it can cause chest pain, <b>diarrhoea,</b> hair loss and muscle weakness. Such symptoms may be managed temporarily with drugs such as beta blockers.|$|E
5|$|Four years later, in 1798, a M.Tessier of Versailles {{hospital}} contacted Percy {{to notify}} {{him that a}} patient of theirs wished to see him. It was Tarrare, now bedridden and weak. Tarrare told Percy that he had swallowed a golden fork two years earlier, which he believed was lodged inside him and causing his current weakness. He hoped that Percy could {{find some way to}} remove it. Percy, however, recognised him as suffering from advanced tuberculosis. A month later, Tarrare began to suffer from continuous exudative <b>diarrhoea,</b> dying shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies have}} an odour {{described}} variously as resembling garlic, radish, lemon, onion, or skunk, and taste like radish. Although some older sources report P.squarrosa as edible, the mushroom has caused several cases of poisoning. The afflicted individuals had consumed alcohol with the mushroom, then experienced vomiting and <b>diarrhoea</b> about ten hours later. The toxic effect {{may be due}} to the combination of eating the mushrooms and taking alcohol, although the extended time delay between consumption and symptoms suggests the mechanism of toxicity is different than the antabuse-effect experienced from Coprinopsis atramentaria with alcohol.|$|E
5|$|In 1120, the English {{political}} landscape changed dramatically. Three hundred passengers embarked on the White Ship {{to travel from}} Barfleur in Normandy to England, including {{the heir to the}} throne, William Adelin, and many other senior nobles. Stephen had intended to sail on the same ship but changed his mind at the last moment and got off to await another vessel, either out of concern for overcrowding on board the ship, or because he was suffering from <b>diarrhoea.</b> The ship foundered en route, and all but two of the passengers died, including William Adelin.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, a {{rotavirus}} vaccine was licensed {{for use in}} the United States. Clinical {{trials in}} the United States, Finland, and Venezuela had found it to be 80 to 100% effective at preventing severe <b>diarrhoea</b> caused by rotavirus A, and researchers had detected no statistically significant serious adverse effects. The manufacturer, however, withdrew it from the market in 1999, after it was discovered that the vaccine may have contributed to an increased risk for intussusception, a type of bowel obstruction, in one of every 12,000 vaccinated infants. The experience provoked intense debate about the relative risks and benefits of a rotavirus vaccine.|$|E
5|$|In General Sir Thomas Blamey's {{reorganisation}} of the Australian Army in April 1942, Fairley {{was appointed}} director {{of medicine at}} Allied Land Forces Headquarters (LHQ) in Melbourne. Fairley was soon facing a series of medical emergencies caused by the Kokoda Track campaign. An epidemic of bacillary dysentery was headed off by Fairley's decision to rush all available supplies of sulphaguanadine to New Guinea. On Fairley's advice every man who complained of <b>diarrhoea</b> was given the drug and the epidemic was brought under control in ten days.|$|E
5|$|Paralytic {{shellfish}} poisoning (PSP) {{is primarily}} {{caused by the}} consumption of bivalves that have accumulated toxins by feeding on toxic dinoflagellates, single-celled protists found naturally in the sea and inland waters. Saxitoxin is the most virulent of these. In mild cases, PSP causes tingling, numbness, sickness and <b>diarrhoea.</b> In more severe cases, {{the muscles of the}} chest wall may be affected leading to paralysis and even death. In 1937, researchers in California established the connection between blooms of these phytoplankton and PSP. The biotoxin remains potent even when the shellfish are well-cooked. In the United States, there is a regulatory limit of 80µg/g of saxitoxin equivalent in shellfish meat.|$|E
5|$|Redback spider bites are {{difficult}} to diagnose in pets unless witnessed. Dogs appear to have some resistance. They are at serious risk only if bitten many times, and rarely need antivenom. Cats {{are likely to be}} more susceptible and require antivenom, which can reverse symptoms very quickly. Guinea pigs, horses and camels are very susceptible. As with humans, the symptoms are predominantly autonomic in nature alongside pain at the bite site. Dogs may also suffer vomiting and <b>diarrhoea,</b> muscle tremors or clonic contractions, and abdominal wall rigidity, while cats may salivate excessively, protrude their tongue or be overexcitable.|$|E
5|$|Rotaviruses infect {{the young}} of {{many species of}} animals {{and they are a}} major cause of <b>diarrhoea</b> in wild and reared animals worldwide. As a {{pathogen}} of livestock, notably in young calves and piglets, rotaviruses cause economic loss to farmers because of costs of treatment associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. These rotaviruses are a potential reservoir for genetic exchange with human rotaviruses. There is evidence that animal rotaviruses can infect humans, either by direct transmission of the virus or by contributing one or several RNA segments to reassortants with human strains.|$|E
5|$|Simpson {{fell ill}} with <b>diarrhoea</b> during the Tour's tenth stage. He was under {{pressure}} from his personal manager {{to continue in the}} race, though members of his team encouraged him to quit. Near the summit of Mont Ventoux, Simpson fell off of his bike but was able to get back on it. After riding a short distance further, he collapsed. He was pronounced dead after being airlifted to a hospital. The post-mortem examination found that he had taken amphetamine and alcohol, a diuretic combination which proved fatal when combined with the heat, the hard climb of the Ventoux and the stomach complaint.|$|E
5|$|The {{second half}} of the 20th century was the golden age of virus {{discovery}} and most of the over 2,000 recognised species of animal, plant, and bacterial viruses were discovered during these years. In 1957, equine arterivirus and the cause of Bovine virus <b>diarrhoea</b> (a pestivirus) were discovered. In 1963, the hepatitis B virus was discovered by Baruch Blumberg, and in 1965, Howard Temin described the first retrovirus. Reverse transcriptase, the enzyme that retroviruses use to make DNA copies of their RNA, was first described in 1970, independently by Howard Martin Temin and David Baltimore. In 1983 Luc Montagnier's team at the Pasteur Institute in France, first isolated the retrovirus now called HIV. In 1989 Michael Houghton's team at Chiron Corporation discovered Hepatitis C.|$|E
5|$|Circa 1930, Gabriel had an {{argument}} {{with one of the}} Jesuits, and as a result the Mugabe family were expelled from the mission village by its French leader, Father Jean-Baptiste Loubiere. They settled in a village about seven miles away, although the children were permitted to remain at the mission primary school, living with relatives in Kutama during term-time and returning to their parental home at weekends. Around the same time, Robert's older brother Raphael died, likely of <b>diarrhoea.</b> In early 1934, Robert's other older brother, Michael, also died, after consuming poisoned maize. Later that year, Gabriel left his family in search of employment at Bulawayo. He subsequently abandoned Bona and their six children and established a relationship with another woman, with whom he had three further offspring.|$|E
5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium {{seeds and}} stems are edible {{and are used}} in {{traditional}} Native American cuisine by Alaska Natives, Inuit and Inupiat people. The leaves and roots of E.angustifolium are also edible and, because of their astringent properties, used by the Yupik peoples for medicinal purposes, {{through a process of}} decoction, infusion or poultice, to treat aliments of the human gastrointestinal tract, and in the Old World for the treatment of <b>diarrhoea.</b> In abundance, E.angustifolium can grow with enough density to disguise wetland and bog. Consequently, it may be used as a natural indicator of areas which are hazardous and to avoid travelling through. Attempts to make a cotton-like thread from the hairs of the plant's seed-heads have been thwarted by its brittleness, but it has been used in the production of paper and candle wicks in Germany, and was used as a feather substitute in pillow stuffing in Sweden and Sussex, England. In Scotland, during World War I, it was used to dress wounds.|$|E
5|$|Like many boletes, Imperator torosus causes {{gastrointestinal}} {{symptoms such as}} abdominal pain, <b>diarrhoea</b> {{and vomiting}} when eaten raw. These reactions can also happen to some people when the mushroom is eaten cooked, though others have consumed it with no ill effects. In a 1994 study, researchers Ulrich Kiwitt and Hartmut Laatsch looked for the antabuse-like compound coprine in Suillellus luridus and similar species that had been suspected of inducing antabuse-like reactions with alcohol. Coprine ingestion results in heat and flushing in the face, tingling in arms and legs, nausea and vomiting, and increased heart rate within five to ten minutes of consuming alcohol. They found none in the suspect species, but did find indications for it in Imperator torosus. They concluded that the most likely explanation for historical poisoning incidents was a misidentification of I.torosus with Suillellus luridus, though they could {{not rule out the}} latter species containing a hitherto unidentified compound causing alcohol-related reactions. No clinical cases of alcohol-related sensitivity have been recorded for I.torosus.|$|E
5|$|Normal {{dietary fat}} {{contains}} mostly long-chain triglycerides (LCT). Medium-chain triglycerides are more ketogenic than LCTs because they generate more ketones {{per unit of}} energy when metabolised. Their use allows for a diet with a lower proportion of fat and {{a greater proportion of}} protein and carbohydrate, leading to more food choices and larger portion sizes. The original MCT diet developed by Peter Huttenlocher in the 1970s derived 60% of its calories from MCT oil. Consuming that quantity of MCT oil caused abdominal cramps, <b>diarrhoea</b> and vomiting in some children. A figure of 45% is regarded as a balance between achieving good ketosis and minimising gastrointestinal complaints. The classical and modified MCT ketogenic diets are equally effective and differences in tolerability are not statistically significant. The MCT diet is less popular in the United States; MCT oil is more expensive than other dietary fats and is not covered by insurance companies.|$|E
5|$|Silver {{compounds}} {{have low}} toxicity {{compared to those}} of most other heavy metals, as they are poorly absorbed by the human body when digested, and that which does get absorbed is rapidly converted to insoluble silver compounds or complexed by metallothionein. However, silver fluoride and silver nitrate are caustic and can cause tissue damage, resulting in gastroenteritis, <b>diarrhoea,</b> falling blood pressure, cramps, paralysis, and respiratory arrest. Animals repeatedly dosed with silver salts have been observed to experience anaemia, slowed growth, necrosis of the liver, and fatty degeneration of the liver and kidneys; rats implanted with silver foil or injected with colloidal silver have been observed to develop localised tumours. Parenterally admistered colloidal silver causes acute silver poisoning. Some waterborne species are particularly sensitive to silver salts {{and those of the}} other precious metals; in most situations, however, silver does not pose serious environmental hazards.|$|E
5|$|The Māori used {{various parts}} of Cordyline australis to treat {{injuries}} and illnesses, either boiled up into a drink or pounded into a paste. The kōata, the growing tip of the plant, was eaten raw as a blood tonic or cleanser. Juice from the leaves was used for cuts, cracks and sores. An infusion of the leaves was taken internally for <b>diarrhoea</b> and used externally for bathing cuts. The leaves were rubbed until soft and applied either directly or as an ointment to cuts, skin cracks and cracked or sore hands. The young shoot was eaten by nursing mothers and given to children for colic. The liquid from boiled shoots was taken for other stomach pains. The seeds of Cordyline australis are high in linoleic acid, one of the essential fatty acids.|$|E
5|$|Tripura {{has high}} {{incidence}} of open defecation, especially in the interior hilly and forest areas. The state has extensively implemented Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan and currently the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and convergence with MGNREGS to address this problem. Schools and Anganwadi Center are focussed to provide with urinals and latrines, separate {{for boys and girls}} aling with baby friendly toilets in Anganwadi Centers to inculcate the habit of using sanitary latrines in young age. However many toilets lie dysfuncational due to lack of maintenance and damage. Earlier schemes of providing plastic squatting plates, free of cost to people, has not produced results as most of them lie unused as many people cannot afford to construct a toilet. Open defecation has created problems of <b>diarrhoea</b> and vulnerability to malaria. The Chief Minister of Tripura has envisioned to make the state Open Defecation Free (ODF) by 2017.|$|E
