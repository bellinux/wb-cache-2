5|$|Most {{colleges are}} led by a Master, even when the Master is female. However, there are some exceptions, listed below. Girton College <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> a Mistress, even though male {{candidates}} {{have been able to}} run for the office since 1976.|$|E
5|$|The genre <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> its {{greatest}} appeal for white males. Most {{of the musicians}} involved were male, {{as was the case}} for most rock music of the time, Female singers were better represented in the progressive folk bands, who displayed a broader range of vocal styles than the progressive rock bands with whom they frequently toured and shared band members.|$|E
5|$|The square <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> a park in its centre, {{which was}} {{originally}} Lammas land. The park's fortunes have varied over the centuries, reaching near dilapidation in {{the mid-19th century}} after changing ownership several times. It was restored {{under the direction of}} Albert Grant, which included the construction of four new statues and a fountain of William Shakespeare. The square was extensively refurbished and remodelled for the 2012 London Olympics, costing more than £15m and taking over 17 months to complete.|$|E

5|$|The fishing market, {{historically}} <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> a porpoise bycatch. In 1981, it {{was legal}} to kill 22,500 porpoises {{per year to}} catch yellowfin tuna. This type of tuna {{has been known to}} follow porpoises, and when fishermen find these tuna, more often than not, a porpoise is also entangled in a net. Sometimes, a pod of porpoises are herded along with schools of tuna, and when fishermen cast a seine, the porpoises are trapped in the net, and drown because they can't surface. Today, the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 has enforced the use of safer fishing equipment to reduce bycatch.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} led by Kenta Kamei who {{previously}} worked on the animated cutscenes from the Tales games. He expressed pressure due to First Strike being his debut as a director and also elaborated on how difficult was creating the storyboard. Yoshida was given the role of screenwriter in order {{to appeal to the}} female fanbase the series <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>had.</b> It was released in Japan on October 3, 2009, as a result of delays in production. Kadokawa Pictures distributed the film. It was released in North America on June 26, 2012, by Funimation Entertainment and in the United Kingdom on December 3, 2012, on DVD and Blu-ray by U.K. Anime Industry.|$|E
5|$|The {{two main}} {{tertiary}} institutions are the Australian National University (ANU) in Acton and the University of Canberra (UC) in Bruce, with over 10,500 and 8,000 full-time-equivalent students respectively. Established in 1946, the ANU <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> a strong research focus and is {{ranked among the}} leading universities {{in the world and}} the best in Australia by The Times Higher Education Supplement and the Shanghai Jiao Tong World University Rankings. There are two religious university campuses in Canberra: Signadou in the northern suburb of Watson is a campus of the Australian Catholic University; St Mark's Theological College in Barton is part of the secular Charles Sturt University.|$|E

5|$|York's {{location}} on the River Ouse and in {{the centre of the}} Vale of York means that it <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> a significant position in the nation's transport system. The city grew up as a river port at the confluence of the River Ouse and the River Foss. The Ouse was originally a tidal river, accessible to seagoing ships of the time. Today both of these rivers remain navigable, although the Foss is only navigable for a short distance above the confluence. A lock at Naburn on the Ouse to the south of York means that the river in York is no longer tidal.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{the lion}} too <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> a close {{association}} with Iranian kingship. The garments and throne decorations of the Achaemenid kings were embroidered with lion motifs. The crown of the half-Persian Seleucid king Antiochus I was {{adorned with a}} lion. In the investiture inscription of Ardashir I at Naqsh-e Rustam, the breast armour of the king is decorated with lions. Further, in some Iranian dialects the word for king (shah) is pronounced as sher, homonymous with the word for lion. Islamic, Turkish, and Mongol influences also stressed the symbolic association of the lion and royalty. The earliest evidence {{for the use of}} a lion on a standard comes from the Shahnameh, which noted that the feudal house of Godarz (presumably a family of Parthian or Sassanid times) adopted a golden lion for its devices.|$|E
5|$|There is also {{an annual}} Fighter Weapons Instructor Course (FWIC) run by No.410 Squadron, and a Fighter Electronic Warfare and Advanced Radar (FEWAR) Course. The intense and highly {{challenging}} FWIC lasts for three months. Each operational CF-18 squadron and tactical radar squadron sends candidates (eight students per course) who graduate with the leadership qualities and expertise required {{to return to their}} squadrons and design tactical training programs themselves. The Advanced Radar Course is conducted in two phases: ground school at 4 Wing, Cold Lake, and a flying phase at an electronic warfare range. This three-week course is designed to allow ten pilots annually to graduate and return to their squadrons as electronic warfare experts and instructors. Since No.410 Squadron <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> some of the most experienced CF-18 pilots in the fighter community, it is often charged with carrying out special fighter projects. The squadron conducted the operational testing and evaluation of the CF's precision guided munitions, and in 2010 was anticipating testing the use of night vision devices in the Hornet.|$|E
