Ho was the father of Sir Samuel Meyrick the {{well-known}} antiquary. Ho purchased the house, in 1794, of R. <b>Heavyside,</b> Esq., and pulled down the old mansion that stood close {{to the site of the}} ancient maze, which became converted into a lawn at the rear of the modern house.

Horses under the charge of men in red jackets are pacing up and down St. James's Street. Cabmen on the stand are regaling with beer. Gentlemen with grooms behind them pass towards the Park. Great dowager barouches roll along emblazoned with coronets, and driven by coachmen in silvery wigs. Wistful provincials gaze in at the clubs.

Why do they let such fellows into clubs? Let's have a game at piquet till dinner, <b>Heavyside.</b> Hallo! That's my uncle, that tall man with the mustachios and the short trousers, walking with that boy of his. I dare say {{they are going to}} dine in Covent Garden, and going to the play.

6000|$|Nay I rather {{think both}} of these shortcomings, fatal deficits both, are {{chargeable}} upon us; {{and it is the}} joint harvest of both that we are now reaping with such havoc to our affairs. I rather guess, the intellect of the Nineteenth Century, so full of miracle to <b>Heavyside</b> and others, is itself a mechanical or beaver intellect rather than a high or eminently human one. A dim and mean though authentic kind of intellect, this; venerable only in defect of better. This kind will avail but little in the higher enterprises of human intellect, especially in that highest enterprise of guiding men Heavenward, which, after all, is the one real [...] "governing" [...] of them on this God's-Earth:--an enterprise not to be achieved by beaver intellect, but by other higher and highest kinds. This is deficit first. And then secondly, Governments have, really to a fatal and extraordinary extent, neglected in late ages to supply themselves with what intellect was going; having, as was too natural in the dim time, taken up a notion that human intellect, or even beaver intellect, was not necessary to them at all, but that a little of the vulpine sort (if attainable), supported by routine, red-tape traditions, and tolerable parliamentary eloquence on occasion, would very well suffice. A most false and impious notion; leading to fatal lethargy on the part of Governments, while Nature and Fact were preparing strange phenomena in contradiction to it.|$|E

O <b>Heavyside,</b> my solid friend, this is the sorrow of sorrows: what on earth can become of us till this accursed enchantment, the general summary and consecration of delusions, be cast forth from the heart and life of one and all! Cast forth it will be; it must, or we are tending, at all moments, whitherward I do not like to name. Alas, and the casting of it out, to what heights and what depths will it lead us, in the sad universe mostly of lies and shams and hollow phantasms (grown very ghastly now), in which, as in a safe home, we have lived this century or two! To heights and depths of social and individual divorce from delusions,--of [...] "reform" [...] in right sacred earnest, of indispensable amendment, and stern sorrowful abrogation and order to depart,--such as cannot well be spoken at present; as dare scarcely be thought at present; which nevertheless are very inevitable, and perhaps rather imminent several of them! Truly we have a heavy task of work before us; and there is a pressing call that we should seriously begin upon it, before it tumble into an inextricable mass, in which there will be no working, but only suffering and hopelessly perishing! ...|$|E

They played in many area bands before moving their act to Toronto in 1979 and forming Oliver <b>Heavyside</b> (ostensibly named after the British engineer, “Oliver Heaviside”), a Toronto bar staple for years. In 1982, they entered and won the “Q107 Homegrown” contest, which {{attracted the attention of}} Capitol Records. Their first album as the Partland Brothers, Electric Honey, was released in 1986, and the first single, [...] "Soul City," [...] a soaring anthem featuring the brothers' distinctive close-harmony vocals, went Top 10 in Canada and Top 30 in the US.

5000|$|At {{the start}} of the musical, she is seen doing a brief solo dance before dancing with Quaxo/Mistoffelees to kick off the Jellicle Ball. She engages heavily in the dancing {{throughout}} the beginning of the show, leading all the cats in the [...] "Song of the Jellicles". Victoria {{is one of the many}} female kittens (Jemima, Electra, and Etcetera) who swoon over Rum Tum Tugger during his song. During the ball, she participates in a ceremonial mating dance (Pas de Deux) with Plato. She appears to be rather close to Mr. Mistoffelees and Jemima. She and Jemima are the first cats who accept Grizabella, despite initially being held back by the older Jellicles. Victoria is the second cat to fully accept Grizabella at the end of the show which leads to her reacceptance by the Jellicles and ascension to the <b>Heavyside</b> Layer. Victoria is a very quiet cat, with no solo singing roles; however, she is frequently spotlighted as a dancer.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} {{a new way to}} approach the one-phase Stefan problem ∂_t(u +χ) = Δ u + fχ, u(0) = g, χ∈ H(u(t)), with both g and f non-negative and where H : R→ P([0; 1]) is the usual maximal monotone <b>Heavyside</b> graph. Our idea is to introduce a discrete in time approximation scheme involving, step by step, suitable one-phase Hele-Shaw problems. With natural regularity hypotheses on data we are able to solve them, by means of results similar to a joint work of the second author with P. Tilli. Using the qualitative behavior of these solutions we can then construct a discrete in time approximate solution for the Stefan problem endowed with suitable a-priory estimates. So we can ¯finally pass to the limit, getting existence of solutions, uniqueness, monotonicity and regularity results...|$|E

The {{expressions of}} these equations are investigated in momentum and configuration spaces, using Fourier transformation. The plane wave, which is generating function for the matrix elements of three dimensional Euclidean group in spherical basis, expanded {{in terms of}} Legendre polynomials and spherical Bessel functions. Also explicit calculation of Green. s function is done. The matrix elements of the unitary irreducible representations of Lorentz group are used to introduce Fourier expansion of plane waves. And the kernel of Gelfand-Graev transformation, which is the relativistic plane wave, is expanded in to these matrix elements. Then relativistic differential difference equation in configuration space is constructed. Lippman-Schwinger equations are studied in Lobachevsky space (hyperbolic space). An analogous to the non-relativistic case, using the finite difference Schrödinger equation, one dimensional Green. s function is analyzed for the relativistic case. Also the finite difference analogue of the <b>Heavyside</b> step function is investigated...|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{modeling}} of coupled heat and mass transport during frying and cooling of wood {{in contact with}} oil Abstract This paper proposes a model of coupled heat and mass (water, oil) transport in a porous medium (timber, 2 D geometries) soaked first in a hot oil bath (), then in a cold oil bath (). The timber is soaked at hot temperature to dry it (water vaporization, resulting in increased pressure and therefore vapor transport) and at cold temperature to treat it (vapor condensation, resulting in decreased pressure and oil transport). A model involving three equations, one for heat transfer (conduction, phase change), one for vapor transport (Darcy's law) and one for oil transport (Darcy's law) is developed (3 multiphysics equations). This gives a set of three equations {{that can be used}} to evaluate the changes in three independent intensive variables: T, p and (oil volume fraction). A <b>Heavyside</b> function is used for simulating vaporization and condensation. The change in density creates pressure, inducing vapor transport in the porous medium. Time-dependent solution allows the temperature boundary conditions to be changed to simulate the change of bath (T 180 T ∞ = °...|$|E
40|$|Estimates of hemodynamic amplitude, delay, {{and width}} were {{combined}} to investigate system dynamics involved in lexical decision making. Subjects performed a lexical decision task using word and nonword stimuli rotated 0 °, 60 °, or 120 °. Averaged hemodynamic responses to repeated stimulation were fit to a Gamma-variate function convolved with a <b>heavyside</b> function of varying onset and duration to estimate each voxel's activation delay and width. Consistent with prolonged reaction {{times for the}} rotated stimuli and nonwords, the motor cortex showed delayed hemodynamic onset for both conditions. Language {{areas such as the}} lingual gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and precuneus all showed delayed hemodynamic onsets to rotated stimuli but not to nonword stimuli. The inferior frontal gyrus showed both increased onset latency for rotated stimuli and a wider hemodynamic response to nonwords, consistent with prolonged processing in this area during the lexical decision task. Phonological processing areas such as superior temporal and angular gyrus showed no delay or width difference for rotated stimuli. These results suggest that phonological routes but not semantic routes to the lexicon can proceed regardless of stimulus orientation. This study demonstrates the utility of estimating hemodynamic delay and width in addition to amplitude allowing for more quantitative measures of brain function such as mental chronometry...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Frequency domain techniques in systems theory have their origins in Heavyside's operational calculus (<b>Heavyside,</b> 1889). Such work was later developed by Foster and Campbell (1931), Brune (1931), Nyquist (1932), Black (1934), Darlington (1939) and subsequently Bode (1948). This interest in the frequency domain was due to its appeal to the intuition of the engineer. The dominance of frequency domain techniques was subsequently eroded from the late 1950 s through the 1960 s by {{the influence of the}} space programmes. The space systems being analysed were based on strong theoretical foundations with well-defined sets of differential equations. The analysis {{led to the development of}} the state-space methods which were able to cope with the multivariable problems and were amenable to numerical solution. As a result of these developments, control engineering was largely dominated by the state-space approach and the associated areas of LQG optimal control, Kaiman-Bucy filters, observability and controllability. Two factors led to a resurgence of interest amongst academics in the development of frequency domain techniques in the 1970 s and 1980 s. The first was the development of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) (Cooley & Tookey, 1965). This provided an efficient method of analysing the Fourier transforms of signals and allowed the development of spectral methods of obtaining frequency response estimates. The collection of data was greatly speeded up and this enabled frequency domain methods to be increasingly applied to on-line control problems. The second factor was that the developments in the time domain were never fully embraced by practicing engineers in traditional control environments...|$|E
40|$|A ‘genes-to-ecosystems’ {{approach}} has been proposed as a novel avenue for integrating the consequences of intraspecific genetic variation with the underlying genetic architecture of a species {{to shed light on}} the relationships among hierarchies of ecological organization (genes → individuals → communities → ecosystems). However, attempts to identify genes with major effect on the structure of communities and/or ecosystem processes have been limited and a comprehensive test of this {{approach has}} yet to emerge. Here, we present an interdisciplinary field study that integrated a common garden containing different genotypes of a dominant, riparian tree, Populus trichocarpa, and aquatic mesocosms to determine how intraspecific variation in leaf litter alters both terrestrial and aquatic communities and ecosystem functioning. Moreover, we incorporate data from extensive trait screening and genome-wide association studies estimating the heritability and genes associated with litter characteristics. We found that tree genotypes varied considerably in the quality and production of leaf litter, which contributed to variation in phytoplankton abundances, as well as nutrient dynamics and light availability in aquatic mesocosms. These ‘after-life’ effects of litter from different genotypes were comparable to the responses of terrestrial communities associated with the living foliage. We found that multiple litter traits corresponding with aquatic community and ecosystem responses differed in their heritability. Moreover, the underlying genetic architecture of these traits was complex, and many genes contributed only a small proportion to phenotypic variation. Our results provide further evidence that genetic variation is a key component of aquatic–terrestrial linkages, but challenge the ability to predict community or ecosystem responses based on the actions of one or a few genes.
