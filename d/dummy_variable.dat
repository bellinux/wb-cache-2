2500|$|The {{danger of}} drought is ever present and still {{dramatically}} affects the Moroccan economy, even though Moroccan decisionmakers have recently {{stated that the}} economy becomes more diversified and deconnected from rain falls. Especially, cereal yields still depend on considerable variation in annual precipitation. Cereals constitute the essential of the agricultural value added and their production is very sensitive to rain falls. More important is that cereal yields determine not only the aggregate value added in the agricultural sector but also economic growth in general.

Based on a dataset of 1144 Lebombo-ironwood trees destructively measured for height and stem volume, H–D and stem volume models were fitted using mixed-effects and <b>dummy</b> <b>variables</b> models. Random-effects and <b>dummy</b> <b>variables</b> were the different growing sites, as they affect H–D relationships and therefore stem volume models.

50|$|In {{statistics}} and regression analysis, an independent variable {{that can take}} on only two possible values is called a <b>dummy</b> <b>variable.</b> For example, it may take on the value 0 if an observation is of a male subject or 1 if the observation is of a female subject. The two possible categories associated with the two possible values are mutually exclusive, so that no observation falls into more than one category, and the categories are exhaustive, so that every observation falls into some category. Sometimes there are three or more possible categories, which are pairwise mutually exclusive and are collectively exhaustive — for example, under 18 years of age, 18 to 64 years of age, and age 65 or above. In this case a set of dummy variables is constructed, each <b>dummy</b> <b>variable</b> having two mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive categories — in this example, one <b>dummy</b> <b>variable</b> (called D1) would equal 1 if age is less than 18, and would equal 0 otherwise; a second <b>dummy</b> <b>variable</b> (called D2) would equal 1 if age is in the range 18-64, and 0 otherwise. In this set-up, the <b>dummy</b> <b>variable</b> pairs (D1, D2) can have the values (1,0) (under 18), (0,1) (between 18 and 64), or (0,0) (65 or older) (but not (1,1), which would nonsensically imply that an observed subject is both under 18 and between 18 and 64). Then the dummy variables can be included as independent (explanatory) variables in a regression. Note {{that the number of}} dummy variables is always one less than the number of categories: with the two categories male and female there is a single <b>dummy</b> <b>variable</b> to distinguish them, while with the three age categories two dummy variables are needed to distinguish them.|$|E

50|$|Note that, for K categories, not all K <b>dummy</b> <b>variables</b> are {{independent}} of each other. For example, in the above blood type example, {{only three of the}} four <b>dummy</b> <b>variables</b> {{are independent}}, in the sense that once the values of three of the variables are known, the fourth is automatically determined. Thus, it's really only necessary to encode three of the four possibilities as <b>dummy</b> <b>variables,</b> and in fact if all four possibilities are encoded, the overall model becomes non-identifiable. This causes problems for a number of methods, such as the simple closed-form solution used in linear regression. The solution is either to avoid such cases by eliminating one of the <b>dummy</b> <b>variables,</b> and/or introduce a regularization constraint (which necessitates a more powerful, typically iterative, method for finding the optimal coefficients).|$|R
