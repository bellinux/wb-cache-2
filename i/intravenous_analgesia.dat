40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the neurological protective effect in elderly spinal surgery {{patients who received}} dexmedetomidine combined with sufentanil for patient-controlled <b>intravenous</b> <b>analgesia.</b> Methods: A total of 130 elderly patients who received spinal surgery in our hospital were selected as the research subjects and randomly divided into observation group and control group. Observation group received postoperative dexmedetomidine (1. 5 μg/kg) combined with sufentanil (1 μg/kg) for patient-controlled <b>intravenous</b> <b>analgesia,</b> and control group received sufentanil (3 μg/kg) alone for patient-controlled <b>intravenous</b> <b>analgesia.</b> Differences in postoperative neuroendocrine, autonomic nervous function, cellular immune function, etc. were compared between two groups at different analgesia points in time. Results: Neuroendocrine factors such as GIU, ACTH, Cor and Ins levels in circulation, and heart rate variability indexes such as LF, HF and LF/HF values of observation group after postoperative patient-controlled <b>intravenous</b> <b>analgesia</b> were {{lower than those of}} control group at corresponding points in time (P< 0. 05); cellular immunity indexes such as CD 3 +, CD 4 +, CD 4 +/ CD 8 + and NK cell values in circulation were higher than those of control group at corresponding points in time (P< 0. 05). Conclusions: Dexmedetomidine combined with sufentanil is a good way of postoperative patient-controlled <b>intravenous</b> <b>analgesia</b> for elderly spinal surgery patients, dexmedetomidine can stabilize autonomic nervous system and neuroendocrine function and reduce the effect of surgery on cellular immune function, and it has positive clinical significance...|$|E
40|$|Background and purpose: Postoperative pain is {{a common}} {{consequence}} of extensive surgery with activation {{of the nervous system}} for the implementation of pain (nociceptive system), tissue injury or inflammation. As a result of tissue injury, many different mediators are released from damaged tissues, immunocompetent cells, sympathetic and sensory fibers which directly or indirectly activate nociceptors. Postoperative pain leads to suppression of the immune system, including reduced activity of NK cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes and macrophages. Patients and Methods: We examined the effects of epidural and <b>intravenous</b> <b>analgesia</b> in patients after colorectal cancer surgery on the immune system. We analyzed the phenotype of isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients during first six postoperative days by flow cytometry and compared them with healthy volunteers. Results: Application of <b>intravenous</b> <b>analgesia</b> leads to statistically significant decreasing in the percentage of cells of innate immunity in comparison with them after epidural analgesia. <b>Intravenous</b> <b>analgesia</b> has led to a statistically significant reduction of subpopulation of T lymphocytes (CD 3 +) and B lymphocytes (CD 19 +) on the 6 th postoperative day compared to epidural analgesia.

Purpose: To evaluate the effect of epidural analgesia on postoperative morbidity of pedicle TRAM and compare it with <b>intravenous</b> narcotic <b>analgesia.</b> Methods: 80 patients underwent immediate or delayed pedicled TRAM reconstruction after mastectomy, by the same surgeon, at Jules Bordet Institute. Patients receiving an epidural analgesia were matched 1 : 3 with patients undergoing <b>intravenous</b> narcotic <b>analgesia</b> for pain control in the same years by the same surgeon. Differences in peri- and postoperative complications across {{the two groups were}} assessed using the chi squared test. Cox regression models were constructed to assess differences in flap healing between the two groups. All of the tests were two-sided and performed with a 5 % alpha risk. Results: Epidural analgesia was significantly associated with less frequent partial flap necrosis (p 25 kg/m 2 and Hb level < 9 were independently associated with flap necrosis.

This study presents subgroup analyses from a large, randomized, multicentre, European study comparing the efficacy and safety of the fentanyl HCl iontophoretic transdermal system and morphine <b>intravenous</b> patient-controlled <b>analgesia</b> for postoperative pain management. Methods The efficacy and safety of the fentanyl iontophoretic transdermal system and morphine <b>intravenous</b> patient-controlled <b>analgesia</b> were evaluated for patients divided by surgery type, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status and type of anaesthesia used during surgery. Efficacy measures included a patient global assessment of the method of pain control (a rating of 'good' or 'excellent' was considered as a success rating) and mean last pain intensity scores in the first 24 h. Discontinuation rates and the incidence of adverse events were also evaluated. Results Numerically similar percentages of patients in most subgroups reported success on the last patient global assessment in the first 24 h for both the fentanyl iontophoretic transdermal system and morphine <b>intravenous</b> patient-controlled <b>analgesia.</b> Similar percentages of investigators reported success ratings on the investigator global assessment at the last assessment for both treatment groups regardless of surgery type, except for the knee surgery subgroup (fentanyl iontophoretic transdermal system, 75 %; morphine <b>intravenous</b> patient-controlled <b>analgesia,</b> 95 %). Mean last pain intensity scores in the first 24 h after surgery were similar in all subgroups. Rates of patient withdrawals and the incidence of adverse events were generally similar between treatment groups in the patient subgroups.

40|$|Background: A {{controversy}} exists whether beneficial analgesic {{effects of}} epidural analgesia over <b>intravenous</b> <b>analgesia</b> influence {{the rate of}} post-operative complications {{and the length of}} hospital stay. There is some evidence that favours epidural analgesia following major surgery in high-risk patients. However, there is a controversy as to whether epidural analgesia reduces the intensive care resources following major surgery. In this study, we aimed at comparing the post-operative costs of intensive care in patients receiving epidural or <b>intravenous</b> <b>analgesia.</b> Methods: Clinical data and rates of post-operative complications were extracted from a previously reported trial following thoraco-abdominal oesophagectomy. Cost data for individual patients included in that trial were retrospectively obtained from administrative records. Two separate phases were defined: costs of pain treatment and the direct cost of intensive care. Results: Higher calculated costs of epidural vs. intravenous pain treatment, 1, 037 vs. 410 Euros/patient, were outweighed by lower post-operative costs of intensive care 5, 571 vs. 7, 921 Euros/patient (NS).

40|$|ObjectiveMinimally {{invasive}} {{pectus excavatum}} repair {{is a common}} and painful surgical procedure in children and adolescents. Adequate postoperative pain therapy is important far beyond the immediate postoperative period because sensitization to painful stimuli can cause chronic pain or higher pain levels during subsequent surgical procedures. Although data in adults favor thoracic epidural anesthesia for pain control in thoracotomy, data for adolescents and children are scarce. We tested the hypothesis that pain relief with thoracic epidural analgesia was superior to that with <b>intravenous</b> patient-controlled <b>analgesia</b> after minimally invasive pectus excavatum repair in children and adolescents. MethodsWe performed a prospective randomized trial with adolescents who had undergone minimally invasive pectus excavatum repair to compare postoperative pain using two different postoperative pain therapy settings: <b>intravenous</b> patient-controlled <b>analgesia</b> (n = 20) with morphine versus continuous thoracic epidural analgesia (n = 20) with 0. 2 % ropivacain containing 2 μg/mL fentanyl. ResultsForty patients (32 male and 8 female patients) aged 10 to 28 years were studied. The thoracic epidural analgesia group showed lower pain scores (P <. 0001) and required less additional pain medication in conjunction with greater well-being postoperatively (P <. 0001) compared with patients receiving patient-controlled intravenous morphine.

40|$|Acute {{shoulder}} dislocation is {{a common}} injury in the outdoor environment. The objective of this systematic {{review of the literature}} was to determine if intra-articular local anesthetic (IAL) is an effective treatment that could have prehospital application. A methodical search of MEDLINE, PubMed, and EMBASE databases targeted publications from January 1, 1990 until January 1, 2017. Eligible articles compared IAL with other analgesic techniques in patients 16 years or older experiencing acute glenohumeral dislocation. Reduction success, complications, and patient-reported outcome measures underwent comparison. All identified publications originated from the hospital setting. Procedural success rates ranged widely among randomized control trials comparing IAL with <b>intravenous</b> <b>analgesia</b> and sedation (IAL 48 – 100 %, <b>intravenous</b> <b>analgesia</b> and sedation 44 – 100 %). A pooled risk ratio [RR] favored <b>intravenous</b> <b>analgesia</b> and sedation (RR 0. 91, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 84 – 0. 98), but there was significant inconsistency within the analysis (I 2 = 75 %). IAL provided lower complication rates (4 / 170, 2 %) than <b>intravenous</b> <b>analgesia</b> and sedation (20 / 150, 13 %) (RR 1. 11, 95 % CI 1. 04 – 1. 19, I 2 = 63 %). One trial found a clinically relevant reduction in visual analogue pain scores when comparing IAL against no additional analgesia in the first minute (IAL 21 ± 13 mm; control 49 ± 15 mm; P< 0. 001) and fifth minute (IAL 10 ± 10 mm; control 40 ± 14 mm, P< 0. 001) after reduction. The results suggest that IAL is an effective intervention for acute anterior shoulder dislocation that would have a place in the repertoire of the remote physician.

40|$|Background: Effective labour {{analgesia}} {{is important}} for the mother and the newborn although it might have adverse effects on the labour outcome. Due to our limited data, the slovene obstetricians, when counselling prospective mothers, mainly rely on foreign data the findings of which are difficult to interpret because of differences in labour management between countries. The aim of this retrospective analysis is to evaluate the effects of labour analgesia on the obstetric outcome in slovene maternity units. Methods: A retrospective study using data from the National perinatal information system was done, and 168863 deliveries were analysed. All singletons (cefalic presentation and gestational age of 37 weeks 0 / 7 and more) from all 14 Slovenian maternity wards, born from 1 st Jan 2003 to 31 th Dec 2012 were included. Stillbirths, children with congenital abnormalities and elective caesarean sections were excluded. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were used to examine the impact of risk factors on birth outcomes. Results: Multivariate logistic regression showed that epidural and <b>intravenous</b> <b>analgesia</b> compared to the absence of analgesia present a higer risk factor for labour duration above 7 hours (OR 5. 1; 95 % CI 4. 8 – 5. 4 for epidural analgesia), (OR 1. 8; 95 % CI 1. 8 – 1. 9 for <b>intravenous</b> <b>analgesia)</b> and for vacuum extraction of the fetus (OR 4. 0; 95 % CI 3. 7 – 4. 4 for epidural analgesia), (OR 1. 7; 95 % CI 1. 6 – 1. 8 for <b>intravenous</b> <b>analgesia).</b> Only epidural analgesia increases the risk for occipitoposterior presentation (OR 1. 8; 95 % CI 1. 7 – 2. 0). The risk for caesarean section decreases with intravenous (OR 0. 4; 95 % CI 0. 4 – 0. 5) as well as with epidural analgesia (OR 0. 6; 95 % CI 0. 5 – 0. 6). Neither intravenous nor epidural analgesia incure any risk factor for low Apgar score (< 6) (OR 1. 0; 95 % CI 0. 8 – 1. 1 for <b>intravenous</b> <b>analgesia)</b> (OR 0. 9; 95 % CI 0. 7 – 1. 2 for epidural analgesia) or pathological cardiotocogram (OR 1. 0; 95 % CI 0. 9 – 1. 0 for <b>intravenous</b> <b>analgesia)</b> (OR 1. 0; 95 % CI 0. 9 – 1. 1 for epidural analgesia). Conclusions: Intravenous and epidural analgesia affected the course and outcome of labour.

40|$|Despite the laparoscopic {{approach}} {{becoming the}} standard in colorectal surgery, postoperative pain management for {{minimally invasive surgery}} is still mainly based on strategies that have been established for open surgical procedures. Patient-controlled epidural and <b>intravenous</b> <b>analgesia</b> are considered standard postoperative analgesia regimens in colorectal surgery. Epidural analgesia provides excellent analgesia, but is increasingly scrutinized in laparoscopic surgery since postoperative pain after the laparoscopic approach is significantly reduced. Moreover, epidural analgesia {{can be associated with}} numerous complications. Therefore, epidural analgesia is no longer recommended for the management of postoperative pain in laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Likewise, patient-controlled <b>intravenous</b> <b>analgesia</b> is subject to significant side effects.

40|$|Epidural {{analgesia}} and <b>intravenous</b> <b>analgesia</b> with opioids are {{two techniques}} for providing pain relief {{for women in}} labour. Labour pain is comparable to surgical pain in its severity, and epidural analgesia provides better relief from this pain than intravenous analgesia; a meta-analysis quantified this improvement to be 40 mm on a 100 mm pain scale during {{the first stage of}} labour. Epidural analgesia also has fewer adverse effects. However, providing epidural analgesia for labour pain costs more. The full cost of providing epidural analgesia can be divided into two components: 1. a baseline-cost component, which captures the costs of hospital care to parturients receiving <b>intravenous</b> <b>analgesia</b> for labour pain; and 2. an incremental-cost component, which estimates the costs arising from incremental care specific to epidural analgesia. The baseline component may be constructed using hospital cost-accounting data pertaining to actual obstetric patients. The incremental component is constructed from a set of recognised complications of epidural and <b>intravenous</b> <b>analgesia,</b> associated incidence rates and estimates of the costs involved, from society's perspective. The incremental expected cost per patient to society of providing epidural analgesia was calculated to be approximately $US 338 (1998 values). This cost difference results primarily from increased professional costs (and is particularly sensitive to the method used to estimate the cost of anaesthesia professional services) and increased complication costs associated with epidural analgesia. A rational social policy for providing labour analgesia must weigh the value of improved pain relief from epidural analgesia against the increased cost of epidural analgesia.

[...] As no antivenom is available, treatment is largely supportive, with analgesia being the mainstay of management. Glyceryl trinitrate, a common drug used for cardiac conditions, is utilised by medical personnel to minimise the risk of pulmonary edema and to reduce hypertension. Antihistamines may be of benefit for pain relief, but most cases require <b>intravenous</b> opioid <b>analgesia.</b> Fentanyl or morphine are usually chosen. Pethidine (meperidine, brand name Demerol in the US) should be avoided, as large doses are often required for pain relief and in this situation significant adverse effects from the pethidine metabolite norpethidine may occur.|$|R

The aim of this case series report is to evaluate the efficacy of proximal mandibular nerve block (PMNB) in perioperative pain management in dogs undergoing mandibulectomy. Ten dogs of various breeds, (six spayed females and four neutered males of 10. 35  3. 09 years and mean weight of 19. 56  15. 19 kg) presenting either neoplasia or mandibular fracture and scheduled for mandibulectomy were premedicated with intramuscular acepromazine maleate (0. 02 mg/kg); after induction of general anaesthesia, bilateral PMNB was performed with ropivacaine 0. 75 % (2 mg/kg) inserting the stimulated needle in temporomandibular joint direction. Whenever intraoperative nociception occurred, <b>intravenous</b> rescue <b>analgesia</b> was provided (fentanyl 3 g/kg). Carprofen was administered subcutaneously as a sole postoperative treatment (3 mg/kg) and postoperative analgesia was assessed for at least 24 hours by a blind operator, accordingly to the Glasgow composite pain scale (Reid et al 2007); when it overcame a threshold of 5 / 24, <b>intravenous</b> rescue <b>analgesia</b> was administered (methadone, 0. 2 mg/kg). In eight out of ten dogs no intraoperative nociception was shown, while in two dogs a single intravenous fentanyl administration was sufficient to provide additional analgesia. No acute and medium term complications were observed and postoperative analgesia lasted for 20. 5 ± 6. 1 hours. PMNB seems to provide effective perioperative long-lasting analgesia leading {{to a reduction in}} intra- and postoperative drug administration...|$|R
40|$|Background: Total knee {{arthroplasty}} (TKA) generates severe {{postoperative pain}} in 60 % {{of patients and}} moderate pain in 30 % of patients. Because inadequate postoperative pain control can hinder early physiotherapy and rehabilitation, {{it is the most}} influential factor dictating a good outcome. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the effectiveness of continuous psoas compartment block (PCB) in comparison to <b>intravenous</b> patient-controlled <b>analgesia</b> (IVPCA) in TKA patients. Methods: 40 TKA patients were randomly divided into 2 groups. Group IVPCA (n = 20) received <b>intravenous</b> patient controlled <b>analgesia</b> (IVPCA) for 48 hours. Group PCB (n = 20) received continuous PCB for 48 hours at the fourth intertransverse process of the lumbar using the C-arm. Pain scores, side effects, satisfaction, the length of hospital stay, rescue antiemetics, and analgesics were recorded. Results: Pain scores (VNRS 0 - 100) were higher in Group IVPCA than in Group PCB. Nausea and sedation occurred more frequently in Group IVPCA than in Group PCB. There were no differences between the groups in the length of the hospital stay, satisfaction scores, and the use of rescue antiemetics and analgesics. Conclusions: Continuous PCB seemed to be an appropriate and reliable technique for TKA patients, because it provided better analgesia and fewer side effects such as nausea and sedation when compared to IVPCA.
