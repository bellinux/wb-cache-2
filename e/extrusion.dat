5|$|Because postmortem fetal <b>extrusion</b> is so rare, and occurs under highly {{idiosyncratic}} conditions {{regarding the}} individual and the ambient environment, this phenomenon has not been studied for possible applications to forensic investigation. Even if the study of postmortem fetal <b>extrusion</b> could lead to improved investigative methods, experimental research would be highly problematic. At present, forensic scientists have at their disposal an array of established techniques and procedures for a death investigation at the stages of decomposition when postmortem fetal <b>extrusion</b> typically occurs.|$|E

5|$|The {{cause of}} postmortem fetal <b>extrusion</b> is not {{completely}} understood, as the event is neither predictable nor replicable under experimental conditions. Evidence has accumulated opportunistically and direct observation is serendipitous. While {{it is possible that}} more than one cause can produce the same result, there is an accepted hypothesis, based on established research in the fields of biochemistry and forensic taphonomy, and further supported by observational research, that accounts for the taphonomic mechanisms that would result in the most often encountered cases of postmortem <b>extrusion</b> of a non-viable fetus.|$|E
5|$|After {{an initial}} {{explosive}} eruption, <b>extrusion</b> of gas-depleted dacite magma commonly forms lava domes.

5|$|Around 1900, A. P. Strohmenger and Oscar Kjellberg {{released}} the first coated electrodes. Strohmenger used clay and lime coating {{to stabilize the}} arc, while Kjellberg dipped iron wire into mixtures of carbonates and silicates to coat the electrode. In 1912, Strohmenger released a heavily coated electrode, but high cost and complex production methods prevented these early electrodes from gaining popularity. In 1927, {{the development of an}} <b>extrusion</b> process reduced the cost of coating electrodes while allowing manufacturers to produce more complex coating mixtures designed for specific applications. In the 1950s, manufacturers introduced iron powder into the flux coating, making it possible to increase the welding speed.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{documented}} {{cases of}} postmortem fetal <b>extrusion</b> were {{described in the}} medical compendium Anomalies and Curiosities of Medicine, first published in 1896. The earliest presented case occurred in 1551 when a pregnant woman was tried and hanged by the courts of the Spanish Inquisition. Four hours after her death, and while the body still hung by the neck, two dead infants were seen to fall free of the body. This is unusual for the {{short amount of time}} elapsed between death and the postmortem delivery. As no information is given regarding other ambient circumstances, it is unclear whether the onset of putrefaction was accelerated, or if other causal factors were at work. In the city of Brussels, in 1633, a woman died in convulsions and three days later the fetus was spontaneously expelled. In Weissenfels, in 1861, postmortem fetal <b>extrusion</b> was observed sixty hours after the death of a pregnant woman. Other cases are described, though only a few describe the unexpected discovery of fetal remains following exhumation. Most cases occurred prior to burial; in some of these, the body was in the casket while in other cases the body was still on its deathbed or on a bier.|$|E

40|$|NSP 4, encoded by {{rotavirus}} genome segment 10 {{has been}} shown to be a transmembrane, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) specific N-linked glycoprotein. Consistent with its localization to the ER membrane, NSP 4 was first shown to have a role in the morphogenesis of the infectious virion. The protein has also been reported to have cytotoxic activity when applied extracellularly to cells. Consequently it has been earmarked as an enterotoxin being secreted from virus-infected cells to cause early cellular pathology in the gut. The effect of expressing the NSP 4 protein of group A rotaviruses in cells has been studied. It led to the rapid appearance of long cytoplasmic <b>extrusions.</b> Site-directed mutagenesis was used to block N-linked glycosylation at both of the known glycosylation sites near the amino terminus of NSP 4. This revealed that the NSP 4 induced formation of the cytoplasmic <b>extrusions</b> was dependent on the protein’s ability to become fully glycosylated. The cytoplasmic <b>extrusions</b> seen in cells expressing glycosylated NSP 4 were also evident in virus-infected cells. Using real-time confocal microscopy a dynamic elongation of the cytoplasmic <b>extrusions</b> with a growth speed of 2 μm/min was observed in virus-infected cells. The cytoplasmic <b>extrusions</b> were found to contain β-tubulin and F-actin. Inhibiting their polymerization prevented the formation of the <b>extrusions</b> from virus-infected cells. Functional studies using Cell Tracker dyes showed that the cytoplasmic <b>extrusions</b> could disseminate vesicles from virus-infected cells onto the plasma membrane surface of uninfected cells. The vesicles were then found in the interior of the uninfected cells. Mono-specific antibody to NSP 4 revealed the presence of the protein in the vesicles suggesting that the cytoplasmic <b>extrusions</b> facilitated the direct cell-cell spread of NSP 4. The effect of NSP 4 expression on the microtubular network of cells was analysed. It was found that NSP 4 de-polymerized the microtubular network from the centre of cells and promoted the assembly of microtubules at the periphery of the cells in a glycosylation independent manner. Similar de-polymerization and re-assembly of the microtubules was observed in the virus-infected cells. Interestingly in the presence of nocodazole, tubular structures containing tubulin and viral proteins excluding NSP 4 were found in virus-infected cells. A YFP-PCA assay was established to screen for cellular partners of NSP 4. The functionality and the sensitivity of the assay were examined, but only two false positive colonies were isolated in the first screening. In conclusion, the function of glycosylated and unglycosylated NSP 4 was examined with the former possessing the ability to promote the formation of the cytoplasmic <b>extrusions</b> from cells and both being capable of disrupting the microtubular network indicating that two forms of NSP 4 play different roles in NSP 4 function. The cytoplasmic <b>extrusions</b> seen in our studies may be relevant to rotavirus infection and pathogenesis. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

5|$|Activity at Incapillo {{commenced}} {{shortly after}} the end of the Maricunga Belt volcanism and occurred first at Monte Pissis between 6.5 and 3.5mya. Later volcanism occurred south of Incapillo 4.7±0.5mya, at Sierra de Veladero 5.6±1–3.6±0.5mya, and in the region of Cerro Bonete Chico 5.2±0.6–3.5±0.1mya. Some of the 32mya Pircas Negras mafic andesites appear to be associated with the Incapillo volcanic complex. These rocks form the last pulse of the Pircas Negras volcanism. Specific ages of the Pircas Negras flows in the Incapillo region include 4.7±0.5mya, 3.2±0.3mya and 1.9±0.2mya. Later, andesitic-rhyolitic volcanism formed ignimbrites and lava domes 2.9±0.4–1.1±0.4mya, with the youngest pre-caldera dome being 0.873±0.077mya old. The lava domes formed through non-explosive <b>extrusion.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aluminium {{cylinders}} {{are usually}} manufactured by cold <b>extrusion</b> of aluminium billets {{in a process}} which first presses the walls and base, then trims {{the top edge of}} the cylinder walls, followed by press forming the shoulder and neck. The final structural process is machining the neck outer surface, boring and cutting the neck threads and O-ring groove. The cylinder is then heat-treated, tested and stamped with the required permanent markings. Aluminium diving cylinders commonly have flat bases, which allows them to stand upright on horizontal surfaces, and which are relatively thick to allow for rough treatment and considerable wear. This makes them heavier than they need to be for strength, but the extra weight at the base also helps keep the centre of gravity low which gives better balance in the water and reduces excess buoyancy.|$|E
40|$|Cylindrical <b>extrusions</b> of {{magnesium}} AZ 31 B {{were subjected to}} quasi-static axial compression and cutting modes of deformation to study this alloy’s effectiveness as an energy absorber. For comparison, the tests were repeated using <b>extrusions</b> of AA 6061 -T 6 aluminum of the same geometry. For the axial compression tests, three different end geometries were considered, namely (1) a flat cutoff, (2) a 45 degree chamfer, and (3) a square circumferential notch. AZ 31 B <b>extrusions</b> with the 45 degree chamfer produced the most repeatable and stable deformation of a progressive fracturing nature, referred to as sharding, with an average SEA of 40 kJ/kg and an average CFE of 45 %, which are nearly equal {{to the performance of}} the AA 6061 -T 6. Both the AZ 31 B specimens with the flat cutoff and the circumferential notch conditions were more prone to tilt mid-test, and lead to an unstable helical fracture, which significantly reduced the SEA. Axial cutting of AA 6061 -T 6 <b>extrusions</b> {{has been shown to be}} an effective, ductile mode of energy dissipation, yielding a repeatable, nearly constant load/deflection response with a crush force efficiency (CFE) up to 96 %. In the present tests, the quasi-static cutting deformation of AZ 31 B <b>extrusions</b> achieved a respectable CFE of 80 %, but revealed a load/deflection response with sharp, minute, rapid fluctuations, indicating an undesirable fracturing failure. Additionally, the average specific energy absorption (SEA) of AZ 31 B was 11 kJ/kg, which is less than half that seen for AA 6061 -T 6 <b>extrusions</b> of the same geometry (24 kJ/kg). An analytical model of the cutting deformation of AA 6061 -T 6 <b>extrusions</b> can predict the steady state cutting force to within 10 %. However, the model did not agree well with the experimental results of AZ 31 B, yielding approximately 150 % error. This deviation is likely attributed to the brittle deformation nature of AZ 31 B that is not accounted for in the model...|$|R
