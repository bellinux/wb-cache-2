5|$|Prior to 1 April 1994, all air {{transport}} in Norway {{was restricted to}} airlines that had received concession from the ministry. On the primary domestic routes, the traffic was split between SAS and Braathens SAFE, although both had services to Trondheim and Stavanger.

Carolina indigo nevertheless succeeded in displacing French and Spanish indigo in the British and in some continental markets, reflecting the demand for cheap dyestuffs from manufacturers of low-cost textiles, the fastest-growing sectors of the European textile industries at the onset of industrialization.|$|E

25|$|Orphan colonies are colonies {{that are}} {{maintained}} by workers after the queen is {{gone from the}} nest. Orphaned workers {{have the ability to}} mate and produce female offspring, but they only begin to oviposit after the queen has disappeared. This is unique to P. snelleni. Orphaned workers can act essentially as replacement queens, because they can inhibit mating in other workers and founding queens. It has been said that P. snelleni goes by the mode of serial polygyny, however this was disproven because by the time new reproductive females are ready to reproduce, the season is ending. So, only a few queen replacements can occur. There are usually 1-2 laying workers that are elderly in these orphan colonies. The dominant laying workers in a nest <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>monopoly</b> over ovipositions by selectively egg-eating.|$|E

25|$|Bambaras {{are mostly}} farmers {{and are the}} most {{numerous}} ethnic group. Their language is Bambara or Djoula. The Bozos are the second most populous ethnic group. They typically live near {{the shore of the}} Niger river, in small towns of small houses. The Bozo economy is based on fishing. Bozo people <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>monopoly</b> on the transport system because of their knowledge of the Niger, its shallows and seasonal lakes, and are regarded as the masters of water. The Somono, also fishermen, are not a distinct ethnic group but a mixture of Bambara, Bozo and Soninke. The Malinké, Maninka, and Mandinka are closely related to Bambaras: They share costumes, religious beliefs, and practices with the Bambaras. The Marka, Saracollé or Soninke are merchants and warriors. The Soninke people are great travelers and Muslims, and have largely conserved their traditions.|$|E
25|$|The Cologne {{newspaper}} war {{and legal}} battles {{were not the}} only problems free papers encountered. In Paris, hawkers who distributed free papers were attacked, and papers were destroyed and burned. The most common newspaper war however is the clash between publishers or, to be more precise, between local publishers and entrepreneurs like in Cologne. In many cities publishers turned the market that has been quiet for decades into a battlefield. Local publishers are now responsible for almost half of the total circulation of free daily newspapers. They <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>monopoly</b> in Belgium, the UK, Singapore, Melbourne, Austria, Argentina and Iceland. However, in other markets (France, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Korea, Denmark, Finland, Italy, USA) local publishers have a substantial market share. In some French and Italian markets three titles are competing; in Seoul there were six titles in October 2004. There are 3 free daily papers in London.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea for}} the canal first arose in 1790. Prior to that time, {{supplies}} of coal for Nottingham travelled down the Erewash Canal and along the River Trent. When the Cromford Canal was authorised in July 1789, there was concern that collieries which were located near it would thrive, {{at the expense of}} those nearer to Nottingham. There were also worries that the Erewash company would effectively <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>monopoly</b> on coal supplies, and might use this to increase prices. Convinced that these issues were not just idle speculation, Thomas Oldknow, John Morris and Henry Green lobbied for a public meeting. The meeting, held at the Guildhall on 26 October 1790, debated the idea of a canal running directly from the Cromford Canal to the Trent, joining it below Trent Bridge. Those present approved a plan, and formed a committee, which included two men who were also connected to the company building the Cromford Canal.|$|E

25|$|Janowitz {{agreed with}} Huntington that, {{because of the}} {{fundamental}} differences between the civilian and military worlds, clashes would develop which would diminish the goal of civilian control of the military. His answer was to ensure that convergence occurred, thus ensuring that the military world would be imbued with the norms and expectations of the society that created it. He encouraged use of conscription, which would bring {{a wide variety of}} individuals into the military. He also encouraged the use of more Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) programs at colleges and universities to ensure that the military academies did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>monopoly</b> on the type of officer, particularly the senior general officer and flag officer leadership positions, in the military services. He specifically encouraged the development of ROTC programs in the more elite universities, so that the broader influences of society would be represented by the officer corps. The more such societal influences present within the military culture, the smaller the attitudinal differences between the two worlds and the greater the chance of civilians maintaining control over the military. Janowitz, like Huntington, believed that the civilian and military worlds were different from one another; while Huntington developed a theory to control the difference, Janowitz developed a theory to diminish the difference.|$|E
25|$|Archaeology has {{discovered}} that the famous circular military harbour at Carthage, the Cothon, received a significant buildup during or after this war. Though shielded from external sight, it could house and quickly deploy about 200 triremes. This appears a surprising development as, after the war, one {{of the terms of}} surrender restricted the Carthaginian fleet to only ten triremes. One possible explanation: as has been pointed out for other Phoenician cities, privateers with warships played a significant role besides trade, even when the Roman Empire was fully established and officially controlled all coasts. In this case {{it is not clear whether}} the treaty included private warships. The only reference to Carthaginian privateers comes from the First Punic War: one such privateer, Hanno the Rhodian, owned a quinquereme (faster than the serial production models that the Romans had copied), manned with about 500 men and then among the heaviest warships in use. Later pirates in Roman waters are all reported with much smaller vessels, which could outrun naval vessels, but operated with lower personnel costs. Thus piracy was probably highly developed in Carthage and the state did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>monopoly</b> of military forces. Pirates probably played an important role in capturing slaves, one of the most profitable trade-goods, but merchant ships with tradeable goods and a crew were also their targets. No surviving source reports the fate of Carthaginian privateers in the periods between and after the Punic Wars.|$|E
