5|$|While {{abdominal}} imaging can {{be useful}} in the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma, direct imaging of the bile ducts is often necessary. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), an <b>endoscopic</b> <b>procedure</b> performed by a gastroenterologist or specially trained surgeon, has been widely used for this purpose. Although ERCP is an invasive procedure with attendant risks, its advantages include the ability to obtain biopsies and to place stents or perform other interventions to relieve biliary obstruction. Endoscopic ultrasound can also be performed at the time of ERCP and may increase the accuracy of the biopsy and yield information on lymph node invasion and operability. As an alternative to ERCP, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) may be utilized. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a non-invasive alternative to ERCP. Some authors have suggested that MRCP should supplant ERCP in the diagnosis of biliary cancers, as it may more accurately define the tumor and avoids the risks of ERCP.|$|E

Case report Here we present two patients with mediastinal pancreatic pseudocysts which were initially managed endoscopically. However, in both cases, this led to complications secondary to the <b>endoscopic</b> <b>procedures,</b> recurrence or non-resolution of symptoms, requiring surgical cystogastrostomy and/or cystojejunostomy.

40|$|The risk of {{endoscopy}} {{in patients}} on antithrombotics {{depends on the}} risks of procedural haemorrhage vs. thrombosis due to discontinuation of therapy. P 2 Y 12 receptor antagonists (clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor) : For low-risk <b>endoscopic</b> <b>procedures</b> we recommend continuing P 2 Y 12 receptor antagonists as single or dual antiplatelet therapy (low quality evidence, strong recommendation);For high-risk <b>endoscopic</b> <b>procedures</b> in patients at low thrombotic risk, we recommend discontinuing P 2 Y 12 receptor antagonists five days before the procedure (moderate quality evidence, strong recommendation). In patients on dual antiplatelet therapy, we suggest continuing aspirin (low quality evidence, weak recommendation). For high-risk <b>endoscopic</b> <b>procedures</b> in patients at high thrombotic risk, we recommend continuing aspirin and liaising with a cardiologist about the risk/benefit of discontinuation of P 2 Y 12 receptor antagonists (high quality evidence, strong recommendation). Warfarin: The advice for warfarin is fundamentally unchanged from BSG 2008 guidance. Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOAC) : For low-risk <b>endoscopic</b> <b>procedures</b> we suggest omitting the morning dose of DOAC {{on the day of}} the procedure (very low quality evidence, weak recommendation).
