40|$|SummaryThe Middle East {{respiratory}} syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) {{is associated}} with life-threatening severe illnesses and a mortality rate of approximately 35 %, particularly in patients with underlying comorbidities. A systematic analysis of 637 MERS-CoV cases suggests that diabetes and hypertension are equally prevalent in approximately 50 % of the patients.

Bone marrow-liver-thymus (BLT) humanized mice also exhibit primary antibody deficiency or hypogammaglobulinemia. Comprehensive characterization of B cell development and differentiation in BLT mice revealed other key parallels with primary immunodeficiency patients.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{study the}} effects of sulphasalazine (SASP) on the {{systemic}} and mucosal <b>humoral</b> <b>immune</b> <b>systems</b> in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS [...] Serum concentrations of interleukin 6 (IL- 6), class and subclass specific IgG, IgA and IgM, IgA and IgG antigliadin antibodies and rheumatoid factors (RF) of IgG, IgA (including IgA 1 and IgA 2 subclasses) and IgM isotypes were measured before and 16 weeks after sulphasalazine (SASP) therapy in 15 female and three male patients with RA. Amounts of immunoglobulins in saliva and jejunal fluid were measured as estimates of mucosal humoral immunity. RESULTS [...] Serum concentrations of IgA and IgG decreased significantly during SASP therapy and correlated with reduced concentrations of IL- 6. In addition, levels of circulating IgA RF, IgA anti-gliadin antibodies and IgM RF decreased significantly after the treatment. In contrast, immunoglobulin levels in saliva and jejunal fluid were unaltered. CONCLUSION [...] SASP exerts powerful but selective inhibitory effects on systemic immunoglobulin production, whereas no effects on mucosal immunoglobulin production were observed.

Analysis of single fragments of the NY-ESO- 1 protein revealed that the humoral response was almost exclusively directed against the N-terminal fragments and the number of fragments and their length being recognized by the NY-ESO- 1 -specific antibodies increased during the course of vaccination.

Computer analysis of the deduced IpaB amino acid sequence indicates that an alpha-helical structure is likely through much of the molecule. Homology searches with protein data banks show that one alpha-helical domain between amino acid residues 95 and 181 has a moderate level of identity with myosin and streptococcal M protein. By using a monoclonal antibody (2 F 1) which recognizes an epitope in the amino-terminal third of the IpaB protein, it was possible to demonstrate a cross-reactive epitope(s) on skeletal muscle myosin. Epitope mapping localized the 2 F 1 epitope to three noncontiguous regions of the IpaB protein within the alpha-helical domain that contains homology with myosin. Antibodies produced in rabbits immunized with synthetic peptides from one of the 2 F 1 epitope regions (residues 99 to 110) of IpaB were capable of reacting with IpaB as well as myosin.

40|$|Abstract: Felty’s {{syndrome}} (FS) {{is characterized}} by the triad of seropositive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with destructive joint involvement, splenomegaly and neutropenia. Current data shows that 1 - 3 % of RA patients are complicated with FS with an estimated prevalence of 10 per 100, 000 populations. The complete triad is not an absolute requirement, but persistent neutropenia with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) generally less than 1500 /mm 3 is necessary for establishing the diagnosis. Felty’s syndrome may be asymptomatic but serious local or systemic infections may be the first clue to the diagnosis. FS is easily overlooked by parallel diagnoses of Sjӧgren syndrome or systemic lupus erythematosus or lymphohematopoietic malignancies. The role of genetic (HLA DR 4) is more prominent in FS in comparison to classic rheumatoid arthritis. There is large body of evidence that in FS patients, both cellular and <b>humoral</b> <b>immune</b> <b>systems</b> participate in neutrophil activation, and apoptosis and its adherence to endothelial cells in the spleen.

We therefore evaluated the Brown Norway rat as an alternative small animal model for pneumonic plague and characterized both the efficacy and potency of vaccine candidates. When infected by intranasal instillation, these rats rapidly developed fatal pneumonic plague within 2 to 4 days of infection. Plague disease was characterized by severe alveolar edema and vascular hemorrhage in the lung in addition to fulminant necrotizing pneumonia caused by massive bacterial replication and inflammation. Twenty-four hours before death, animals developed systemic disease with an apparent delayed inflammatory response.
