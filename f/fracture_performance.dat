40|$|AbstractHow to {{effectively}} develop tight-gas carbonate reservoir and achieve high recovery {{is always a}} problem for the oil and gas industry. To solve this problem, domestic petroleum engineers use the combination of the successful experiences of North American shale gas pools development by stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) fracturing with the research achievements of Chinese tight gas development by acid fracturing to propose volume acid fracturing technology for fractured tight-gas carbonate reservoir, which has achieved a good stimulation effect in the pilot tests. To determine what reservoir conditions are suitable to carry out volume acid fracturing, this paper firstly introduces volume acid fracturing technology by giving the stimulation mechanism and technical ideas, and initially analyzes the feasibility by the comparison of reservoir characteristics of shale gas with tight-gas carbonate. Then, this paper analyzes the validity and limitation of the volume acid fracturing technology via the analyses of control conditions for volume acid fracturing in reservoir <b>fracturing</b> <b>performance,</b> natural <b>fracture,</b> horizontal principal stress difference, orientation of in-situ stress and natural fracture, and gives the solution for the limitation. The study results show that the volume acid fracturing process can be used to greatly improve the flow environment of tight-gas carbonate reservoir and increase production; the incremental or stimulation response is closely related with reservoir <b>fracturing</b> <b>performance,</b> the degree of development of natural fracture, the small intersection angle between hydraulic fracture and natural fracture, the large horizontal principal stress difference is easy to form a narrow fracture zone, and it is disadvantageous to create fracture network, but the degradable fiber diversion technology may largely weaken the disadvantage. The practices indicate that the application of volume acid fracturing process to the tight-gas carbonate reservoir development is feasible in the Ordovician Majiagou Formation of lower Paleozoic, which is of great significance and practical value for domestic tight-gas carbonate reservoir development and studies in the future...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to study the combined effects of weld metal undermatching and crack location on the fracture behavior of transversely loaded butt-welded joints in high-strength steel. Surface-cracked tensile panels were instrumented with stain gages and tested with notch locations at the heat-affected zone (HAZ), base and 30 % undermatched weld metals. It can be expected that for a given applied strain, the level of the strain concentration developed in undermatched weld region will be significantly lower in the high strain-hardening welds compared to the low work-hardening weld joint in high-strength steels. Therefore, in higher strength steel undermatched welds, substantial increase of the strain accumulation should be expected. Detailed strain measurements and tensile panel tests of this study reveal that if there is a defect in the undermatched weld, a combination of the low weld metal toughness and resulting strain accumulation in the weld metal lead to poor <b>fracture</b> <b>performance.</b> The HAZ notched tensile panel results indicate that weld metal undermatching causes an unsymmetrical strain distribution at the crack vicinity. Despite the occurrence of the high applied strain concentration at the weld metal side of HAZ notched panel, the gross section yielding (GSY) occurred similar to the base metal notched one. On the other hand, weld metal notched panels showed net section yielding (NSY) with a considerably reduced ductility. An important difference in 30 % undermatched weld joint <b>fracture</b> <b>performance,</b> however, emerges when results are analyzed in terms of crack growth resistance curves. The J R-curves of the HAZ and weld metal notched panels have shown lower resistance behavior compared to the base metal panel. Therefore, it is concluded that the <b>fracture</b> <b>performance</b> of the undermatched welds cannot be fully understood if only strength or total strain capacity (applied side) of the entire panel is considered. The fracture toughness (material resistance side) of the undermatched weld joint should also be an integral part of the <b>fracture</b> <b>performance</b> assessment procedure. (orig.)

40|$|Hydraulic {{fracturing}} technologies play a {{major role}} in the global energy supply and affect oil pricing. The current oil price fluctuations within 40 to 55 USD per barrel have caused diminished economical margins for hydraulic fracturing projects. Hence, successful decision making the for execution of hydraulic fracturing projects requires a higher level of integration of technical, commercial, and uncertainty analyses. However, the complexity of hydraulic fracturing modeling, and the sensitivity and the effects of uncertainty of reservoir heterogeneity on well performance renders the integration of such studies rather impractical. The impact of reservoir heterogeneity on hydraulic <b>fracturing</b> <b>performance</b> has been quantified by the introduction of Heterogeneity Impact Factor (HIF) and formulas have been developed to forecast well performance using HIF.

40|$|In {{hydraulic}} fracturing stimulation treatments for organic-rich mudrocks, some issues that pose challenges in pre-completions design include selection of intervals for stimulation treatment, and selection of proppants for stimulation design. After the stimulation treatment, a key post-completions {{issue is the}} detection of the fracture and evaluation of the <b>fracture</b> <b>performance.</b> The application of petrophysical and geophysical analysis can offer potential solutions to these issues, thereby lead to improvements of both pre-completions and post-completions design of the {{hydraulic fracturing}} treatment. The objectives of this dissertation are (a) to introduce a rock classification workflow, which integrates geologic, petrophysical and geomechanical analysis, for the determination of zones for fracture stimulation treatments, (b) {{to develop a new}} technique for characterization of mechanical damage in proppant packs to improve the selection of proppants for stimulation treatment, and (c) to investigate the use of nanoparticles as contrast agents that enhances magnetic susceptibility measurements for the detection of hydraulic fractures after stimulation treatments. I first demonstrated that the integrated rock classification workflow, which includes geologic attributes of the formation, in-situ stress assessment capturing the effects of anisotropy in organic-rich mudrocks, and also takes into account anisotropic poroelastic coefficients, can improve the selection strategy for completion zones. Next, I introduced the application of the Hertz-Mindlin granular contact model to approximate the effective elastic properties of proppant packs. I used the calibration parameters of the Hertz-Mindlin model to develop correlations for the prediction of weight percentage of crushed proppants. Finally, from laboratory investigations, I demonstrated that superparamagnetic nanoparticles when mixed with proppants enhance the reliability of detecting fractures using magnetic susceptibility measurements. I also presented the sensitivity of the magnetic susceptibility measurements to the composition of proppants, concentration of nanoparticles, and the width of the induced fractures. The outcomes of this dissertation demonstrate significant contribution of petrophysical and geophysical analysis in achieving better <b>fracture</b> <b>performance</b> from completions design.

The volume of water which is used for hydraulic fracturing procedures varies regarding the type of drilled wells such as some vertical vs. horizontal wells, length of laterals, and fracture fluid types. Furthermore, the possibility of water occurrence is utterly depended on the local sources of water supply. Produced water has entailed all sources of water such as returning water to the surface, flow back of injected water during the hydraulic <b>fracturing</b> <b>performances</b> as well as natural formation water.

40|$|When {{horizontal}} well staged cluster fracturing is applied in shale gas reservoirs, the cluster spacing {{is essential to}} <b>fracturing</b> <b>performance.</b> If the cluster spacing is too small, the stimulated area between major fractures will be overlapped, and the efficiency of fracturing stimulation will be decreased. If the cluster spacing is too large, the area between major fractures cannot be stimulated completely and reservoir recovery extent will be adversely impacted. At present, cluster spacing design is mainly based on the static model with the potential reservoir stimulation area as the target, {{and there is no}} cluster spacing design method in accordance with the actual fracturing process and targets dynamic stimulated reservoir volume (SRV). In this paper, a dynamic SRV calculation model for cluster fracture propagation was established by analyzing the coupling mechanisms among fracture propagation, fracturing fluid loss and stress. Then, the cluster spacing was optimized to reach the target of the optimal SRVs. This model was applied for validation on site in the Jiaoshiba shale gasfield in the Fuling area of the Sichuan Basin. The key geological engineering parameters influencing the optimal cluster spacing intervals were analyzed. The reference charts for the optimal cluster spacing design were prepared based on the geological characteristics of south and north blocks in the Jiaoshiba shale gasfield.

A porcelain-fused-to-metal method (Academy, Bego Medical) {{was used in}} either conventional casting technique or laser sintering. Sixteen crowns of each material were fabricated and veneered with glass-ceramic as recommended by the manufacturers. Crown and root dimensions were measured, and 8 crowns of each system were adhesively bonded or conventionally cemented. After the crowns were artificially aged in a simulated oral environment (1, 200, 000 mechanical loads with 50 N; 3, 000 thermal cycles with distilled water between 5 °C and 55 °C; 2 minutes per cycle), fracture resistance and fracture patterns were determined and defect sizes investigated.

30|$|Huang and Kim (1993) {{conducted}} mine-back experiments, {{which show}} that a hydrofracture does not propagate linearly, but there are bi-wing fractures with several branches. The interaction between a hydraulic fracture (HF) and natural fracture (NF) {{can lead to the}} propagation of a fracture network (Jang et al. 2015; Cai et al. 2017), which is also influenced by heterogeneity of reservoir layers, irregular distribution of natural fractures and especially the in situ stress field (Olson 2008; Olson and Taleghani 2009). Weng et al. (2011) and Weng (2015) developed an unconventional fracture model (UFM) and considered stress field, the orientation of the NF and rock deformation, which is very powerful to describe the hydraulic fracture propagation using an unstructured grid. On the other hand, the wiremesh model (Xu et al. 2009, 2010; Meyer and Bazan 2011) utilizes two orthogonal sets of planar elements to represent the area of the fracture network and stimulated reservoir volume (SRV), which is simple but effective for network modeling (Weng et al. 2011). Fracture spacing, the complexity of the fracture network and the grid’s properties are considered during the hydraulic fracture propagation. The wiremesh model can incorporate many factors into the mathematical model because it uses planar network density to model the SRV rather than an individual fracture. Hence, both the UFM and the wiremesh model have advantages for representing the fracture network geometry and the influences on production. A performance-based simulation model has the following characteristics: (1) the main factors influencing the <b>fracturing</b> <b>performance</b> are connected to the fracture model. (2) The complexity of the fracture network geometry is recognized, and the intersection of HF and NF is modeled. (3) The area of the fracture model (or the SRV) is connected to the microseismic (MS) monitoring to better utilize the events of the MS.
