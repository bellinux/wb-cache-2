25|$|Jacob ben Asher {{thought that}} washing the mouth was not {{sufficient}} to remove all residue of cheese, and suggested that eating some additional solid food is required to clean the mouth. Hard and aged cheese has long been rabbinically considered to need extra precaution, {{on the basis that}} it might have a much stronger and longer lasting taste; the risk of it leaving a fattier residue has more recently been raised as a concern. According to these rabbinic opinions, the same precautions (including a pause of up to six hours) apply to eating <b>hard</b> <b>cheese</b> before meat as apply to eating meat in a meal when the meat is eaten first. Judah ben Simeon, a 17th-century doctor in Frankfurt, argued that <b>hard</b> <b>cheese</b> is not problematic if melted. Binyomin Forst argues that leniency is proper only for cooked cheese dishes and not dishes topped with cheese.|$|E
5000|$|In late 2012 the Centre Party caused {{controversy}} in Norway when it emerged {{that the party}} had demanded higher import tariffs on meat and <b>hard</b> <b>cheeses</b> to protect Norwegian farmers from foreign competition. [...] This included increased duties of 429% on lamb, 344% on beef, and 277% on all but 14 exempted <b>hard</b> <b>cheeses.</b>|$|R

25|$|Rashi {{stated that}} meat leaves a fatty residue {{in the throat}} and on the palate and Maimonides noted that meat stuck between the teeth might not degrade for several hours Jonathan Eybeschutz pointed out that meat and dairy produce mix during digestion, and Feivel Cohen {{maintained}} that <b>hard</b> <b>cheese</b> leaves a lingering taste in the mouth. Generally, rabbinic literature considers the collective impact {{of each of these}} issues.|$|E
25|$|FPC was {{the first}} artificially {{produced}} enzyme {{to be approved by}} the US Food and Drug Administration. FPC products have been on the market since 1990 and as of 2015 had yet to be surpassed in commercial markets. In 1999, about 60% of US <b>hard</b> <b>cheese</b> was made with FPC. Its global market share approached 80%. By 2008, approximately 80% to 90% of commercially made cheeses in the US and Britain were made using FPC.|$|E

50|$|The first citrus crop {{was planted}} in 1931. In 1936, Tnuva opened its first dairy at Tel Yosef, specializing in <b>hard</b> <b>cheeses.</b> In 1942, the kibbutz built the country's first {{commercial}} fishponds.|$|R
2500|$|... "Cheddaring" [...] {{refers to}} an {{additional}} step {{in the production of}} Cheddar cheese where, after heating, the curd is kneaded with salt, cut into cubes to drain the whey, and then stacked and turned. Strong, extra-mature Cheddar, sometimes called vintage, needs to be matured for up to 15 months. The cheese is kept at a constant temperature, often requiring special facilities. As with other <b>hard</b> <b>cheese</b> varieties produced worldwide, caves provide an ideal environment for maturing cheese; still, today, some Cheddar cheese is matured in the caves at Wookey Hole and Cheddar Gorge. Additionally, some versions of Cheddar cheese are smoked.|$|E
2500|$|Country dwellers drank milk ( [...] gala), but it {{was seldom}} used in cooking. Butter ( [...] bouturon) was known but seldom used either: Greeks {{saw it as a}} [...] culinary trait of the Thracians of the {{northern}} Aegean coast, whom the Middle Comic poet Anaxandrides dubbed [...] "butter eaters". Yet Greeks enjoyed other dairy products. [...] pyriatē and Oxygala (...) were curdled milk products, similar to cottage cheese or perhaps to yogurt. Most of all, goat's and ewe's cheese ( [...] tyros) was a staple food. Fresh and <b>hard</b> <b>cheese</b> were sold in different shops; the former cost about two thirds of the latter's price.|$|E
2500|$|As kitchen utensils, surform {{tools are}} a recent innovation. [...] The Microplane wood rasp, a sleek {{stainless}} steel surform rasp first marketed as a woodworking tool and known generically as a microplane, recently became popular as a kitchen utensil for, among other uses, grating cheese (see Zester). [...] An early mention {{of using a}} Microplane [...] "rasp-like grater" [...] in the kitchen was a cookbook published in 1999. [...] This was soon followed by mentions such {{as one of the}} finest kitchen tools to come along in decades and a miracle citrus zester and <b>hard</b> <b>cheese</b> grater. [...] Initially, it was available from kitchen supply stores and Lee Valley Tools.|$|E
50|$|Cheese {{crystals}} are whitish, semi-solid to solid, slightly crunchy to gritty crystalline spots, granules, and aggregates {{that can}} {{form on the}} surface and inside of cheese. Cheese crystals are characteristic of many long-aged <b>hard</b> <b>cheeses.</b>|$|R
50|$|Typical zakuski {{consist of}} cold cuts, cured fishes, mixed salads, kholodets (meat jelly), pirogs or pirozhki, various pickled {{vegetables}} such as tomatoes, beets, cucumbers, sauerkraut, pickled mushrooms, deviled eggs, <b>hard</b> <b>cheeses,</b> caviar, canapés, open sandwiches, and breads.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hard</b> <b>cheeses</b> where cheese {{crystals}} {{are common}} and valued include comte, aged cheddar, grana cheeses like parmesan, grana padano, and Pecorino Romano, {{as well as}} old gouda. However, in some cheeses, like industrial cheddar, they are considered a production defect.|$|R
2500|$|The {{situation}} of cheese is complicated as <b>hard</b> <b>cheese</b> usually involves rennet, an enzyme which splits milk into curds and whey. Most forms of rennet were formerly {{derived from the}} stomach linings of animals, but currently rennet is most often made recombinantly in microbes. [...] Because the rennet could be derived from animals, it could potentially be nonkosher. Only rennet made recombinantly, or from the stomachs of kosher animals, {{if they have been}} slaughtered according to the laws of kashrut, is kosher. If a kosher animal is not slaughtered according to the halakha, the rennet is not kosher. Rennet is not considered a meat product and does not violate the prohibition of mixing meat and dairy.|$|E
2500|$|Goat {{milk and}} sheep’s milk cheeses {{were the most}} {{prevalent}} types of cheese. Soft cheese was made using cloth bags filled with soured milk. The thin liquid was drained through the cloth and soft cheese remained in the bag. A <b>hard</b> <b>cheese</b> was made from fermented soured milk: Milk was poured into special moulds in which it curdled and was then hardened by drying in the sun or by heating and numerous small cheese molds with holes for the draining the whey have been discovered. Cheese is not mentioned often in the Bible, but in one case, David is sent to take a gift of cheese to {{the commander of the}} army (...) [...]|$|E
2500|$|In {{the wake}} of the wars of conquest of the 17th century, [...] {{completely}} deforested of timber for export (usually for the Royal Navy) and for a temporary iron industry {{in the course of the}} 17th century, Irish estates turned to the export of salt beef, pork, butter, and <b>hard</b> <b>cheese</b> through the slaughterhouse and port city of Cork, which supplied England, the British navy and the sugar islands of the West Indies. George Berkeley, Bishop of Cloyne wondered [...] "how a foreigner could possibly conceive that half the inhabitants are dying of hunger in a country so abundant in foodstuffs?" [...] In the 1740s, these economic inequalities, when combined with an exceptionally cold winter and poor harvest, led directly to the famine of 1740–1741, which killed about 400,000 people. In the 1780s, due to increased competition from salted-meat exporters in the Baltic and North America, the Anglo-Irish landowners rapidly switched to growing grain for export, while their impoverished tenants ate potatoes and groats.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cheese is}} similar to other Swedish <b>hard</b> <b>cheeses</b> whose {{manufacturing}} methods date back to perhaps the 13th century, but the name Svecia [...] - [...] from the Latin Suecia meaning [...] "Sweden" [...] - [...] is a 20th-century invention, dating to 1920.|$|R
50|$|A {{cheese slicer}} is used usually to cut semi-hard and <b>hard</b> <b>cheeses.</b> It {{produces}} thin, even slices. There are {{different styles of}} cheese slicers, designed for cheeses of varying hardness. A cheese slicer can be also used for slicing cold butter, zucchini, cucumber or cabbage.|$|R

40|$|Cheeses as ready-to-eat food {{should be}} {{considered}} as a potential source of foodborne pathogens, primarily Listeria monocytogenes. The aim of present {{study was to determine the}} microbiological quality of soft, semi-hard and <b>hard</b> <b>cheeses</b> during the shelf-life, with particular reference to L. monocytogenes. Five types of cheeses were sampled at different timepoints during the cold storage and analyzed for presence of Salmonella and L. monocytogenes, as well as lactic acid bacteria, Escherichia coli, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, molds, sulfite-reducing clostridia and L. monocytogenes counts. Water activity, pH and NaCl content were monitored in order to evaluate the possibility of L. monocytogenes growth. Challenge test for L. monocytogenes was performed in soft whey cheese, to determine the growth potential of pathogen during the shelf-life of product. All analyzed cheeses were compliant with microbiological criteria during the shelf-life. In soft cheeses, lactic acid bacteria increased in the course of the shelf-life period (1. 2 - 2. 6 log increase), while in semi-hard and <b>hard</b> <b>cheeses</b> it decreased (1. 6 and 5. 2 log decrease, respectively). Soft cheeses support the growth of L. monocytogenes according to determined pH values (5. 8 - 6. 5), water activity (0. 99 - 0. 94), and NaCl content (0. 3 - 1. 2 %). Challenge test showed that L. monocytogenes growth potential in selected soft cheese was 0. 43 log 10 cfu/g during 8 days at 4 °C. Water activity in semi-hard and <b>hard</b> <b>cheeses</b> was a limiting factor for Listeria growth during the shelf-life. Soft, semi-hard and <b>hard</b> <b>cheeses</b> were microbiologically stable during their defined shelf-life. Good manufacturing and hygienic practices must be strictly followed in the production of soft cheeses as Listeria-supporting food and be focused on preventing (re) contamination...|$|R
