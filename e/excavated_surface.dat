In combination with its small (for pseudotooth birds) size, some traits allow to identify the present genus. It resembles Dasornis in having a jugal arch that is mid-sized, tapering and stout behind the orbital process of the prefrontal bone, unlike in the large Neogene Osteodontornis. Also, its paroccipital process is much elongated back- and downwards, again like in Dasornis but unlike in Pseudodontornis longirostris. Meanwhile, the distal humerus specimen from Mexico (MHN-UABCS Te5/6-517) {{which may or may}} not belongs in the present genus differs from the corresponding bone of Osteodontornis in a more narrow and less <b>excavated</b> <b>surface</b> between the external condyle and the ectepicondylar prominence, with the pit between these closer to the bone's end. Its quadrate bone, meanwhile, differed from that of Osteodontornis in a very broadly grooved dorsal head, a wide main shaft with a strongly curved lateral ridge and a small and somewhat forward-pointing orbital process. The forward center of the quadrate's ventral articulation ridge extends downwards and to the middle, and the pterygoid process is only slightly expanded to the upper center in Odontopteryx. The socket for the quadratojugal is displaced downwards. The quadrate of P. longirostris is not very well preserved; it agees with Odontopteryx in a broad main shaft but is closer to Osteodontornis in the straight main shaft ridge and its upward-directed ventral articulation ridge's forward center. Its quadratojugal socket differs from both.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In the soil-rock mixed {{areas where}} the soils overlie on the rock layer, the rock-socketed {{retaining}} piles {{have been widely used}} for deep excavations. Up to date, little {{attention has been paid to}} performance of the rock-socketed piles used for deep excavation. Therefore, using the two-dimensional finite element program, Plaxis 2 D, a typical deep excavation engineering supported by rock-socketed piles with the whole embedded portion in rock is analyzed to investigate behavior of the rock-socketed retaining piles in detail. Computation results have shown that for rock-socketed retaining piles used in deep excavations, there exists an ultimate or a maximum rock-socketed depth which can be estimated by the pile diameter. For the ultimate rock-socketed depth, in the final excavation step, the first zero bending moment point of the rock-socketed part of the pile generally locates near the top surface of the rock layer. When the <b>excavated</b> <b>surface</b> is located at the top surface of the rock layer, the corresponding shear force distribution of the rock-socketed pile has an extremum at the same position...|$|E

We used UV resonance Raman spectroscopy to examine the photon dose dependence of the NO 2 - band intensities and measure a photochemical quantum yield of 0. 04 at pH 6. 5. We also {{examined the}} response of solid NaNO 3 samples to 229 nm excitation and also observe formation of NO 2 -. The quantum yield is much smaller at ∼ 10 - 8. The solid state NaNO 3 photochemistry phenomena appear complex by showing a significant dependence on the UV excitation flux and dose. At low flux/dose conditions NO 2 - resonance Raman bands appear, accompanied by perturbed NO 3 - bands, indicating stress in the NaNO 3 lattice. Higher flux/dose conditions show less lattice perturbation but SEM shows surface eruptions that alleviate the stress induced by the photochemistry. Higher flux/dose measurements cause cratering and destruction of the NaNO 3 surface as the surface layers are converted to NO 2 -. Modest laser excitation UV beams <b>excavate</b> <b>surface</b> layers in the solid NaNO 3 samples. At the lowest incident fluxes a pressure buildup competes with effusion to reach a steady state giving rise to perturbed NO 3 - bands.

40|$|Experience {{has shown}} that ground {{movement}} invariably occurs above tunnels constructed in soft soils. At present, this movement cannot be adequately predicted during the design stage. In this thesis, a sophisticated theoretical technique for predicting settlements above a tunnel in soft clay is presented. This theory consists of an elasto-plastic three-dimensional finite element approach which is able {{to take into account}} the construction procedure, soil-liner interaction and material non-linearity of soil. This technique is used in an extensive study of the general ground reaction and deformation behaviour of shallow tunnels. The technique and experience gained from this study are then utilized in the development of a simple method for calculating the maximum 2 ̆ 2 gap 2 ̆ 2 parameter. This parameter takes into account the ground loss as a function of strength and deformation behaviour in the elastic and plastic state, the physical clearance between the lining and the <b>excavated</b> <b>surface</b> and workmanship factor. This 2 ̆ 2 gap 2 ̆ 2 parameter can be used in conjunction with plane strain finite element method or other simplified techniques to predict the resulting surface settlement.;The validity of the proposed three-dimensional approach is then investigated by comparing the results of analysis with the detailed results of field measurements at the Thunder Bay Tunnel. It is found that the proposed procedure yields reasonable agreement with the observed overall displacement pattern including the magnitude and distribution of surface settlement.;The applicability and practicality of the proposed simplified technique in estimating the 2 ̆ 2 gap 2 ̆ 2 parameter are examined by four additional tunnelling case histories in various soil and construction conditions. Comparison of the calculated displacement with available field observations showed reasonable agreement. It is suggested that the 2 ̆ 2 simple method 2 ̆ 2 may be used effectively in preliminary design considerations.;Furthermore, the effects of elastic and strength anisotropy on surface subsidences induced by the construction of shallow tunnels are examined. Finally, the implications of stress path with respect to the selection of elastic and plastic parameter are discussed. An approximate scheme for determining soil parameters suitable for use in the preliminary analysis of deformations caused by tunnelling in soft clay is suggested...|$|E

Rezultati zaštitnih istraživanja nalazišta Slatina-Turbina 1 omogućili su znatno bolje poznavanje naseljenosti slatinskog područja u ranom srednjem vijeku te materijalne ostavštine za šire područje srednje Podravine. During archaeological supervision, at {{the mild}} {{elevation}} along the Javorica stream (Fig. 1) north-west of {{the centre of}} Slatina, at the Turbina 1 site (Map 1), remains of a smaller, until then unknown early mediaeval settlement were found, and consequently rescue excavations were conducted. In {{the first stage of}} the excavations, archaeological supervision was carried out in the entire construction area covering a surface of approximately 5 ha by making 1. 20 m wide trial trenches. In the rescue excavations, various structure types were classified: – remains of houses with preserved sunken pillars; – larger shallowly sunken oval pits – probably working areas; – so-called waste pits (Fig. 3, 4); – sunken pillars. The largest part of the <b>excavated</b> <b>surface</b> of the Turbina 1 site enabled the recognition of the settlement’s structure with rectangular houses, oriented N-S, along which there were also other types of structures, suggesting that the settlement was possibly family structured. The majority of moveable goods are made out of pottery fragments and house daub finds. Among functional forms, various shapes of pots with an S profile can be recognized, produced on a hand-turned tournette. Their shoulders are decorated with horizontal wavy lines or series of parallel lines. On the basis of their shapes, ornaments and technological characteristics, the described fragments can be dated in the Early Middle Ages period (10 th– 12 th centuries). Considering the number of discovered archaeological structures, the Slatina-Turbina 1 site represents the remains of a smaller and shortlasting settlement, stretching along the Javorica stream, and consisting of at least two family units. These included smaller houses with plots (working areas, waste pits etc.). The plots are situated on the south-eastern side of the mild elevation which was hardly evident, since the surface of the site was significantly damaged by intensive agriculture. Until now, similar sites have rarely been explored since they are hard to locate because they do not contain as many characteristic pottery fragments. Processing the rescue excavations results along with the unearthed structures will contribute to solving the conundrum of the settlement’s infrastructure representing the Early Middle Ages material heritage of the wider central Podravina Area...|$|E

Numerous prehistoric finds {{have been}} {{uncovered}} in the north-eastern {{part of the}} Požega Basin, suggesting dense habitation of {{an area in which}} no large-scale archaeological excavations have so far been conducted (Fig. 1). Relatively small-scale trial excavations in Vlatkovac (Čaglin Municipality, Požega-Slavonia County) were conducted in July 2010 with the aim of gathering more facts about incineration graves of the Late Bronze Age Barice-Gređani group, discovered in 1987. In the surveying of agricultural surfaces, pottery fragments of Sopot and Lasinja cultures were recorded. The site is situated on an oval hill on the southernmost slopes of Krndija, which fall away towards the River Londža, on whose southern bank the northern slopes of Dilj start rising (Fig. 2). On the central, levelled part of the hill, three probes were set in which fills of a relatively large semi-sunken pit dwelling and oval pits were uncovered. These contained significant quantities of pottery shards, house daub and stone artefacts (Fig. 3). According to their shape, technique and motifs, the pottery shards can be assigned to the Lasinja culture of which there were a large number of settlements in the Požega Basin. The find of a wholly preserved and richly decorated beaker in the fill of pit SU 9 is particularly noteworthy (Fig. 4). Also collected were Sopot culture pottery shards, such as the high foot of a bowl from the fill of a relatively small oval pit SU 18 (Fig. 5). Part of excavated smaller structures in Vlatkovac also belong to the Sopot culture, of which there were numerous settlements {{in the eastern part of}} the Požega Basin, where mostly stray and surface finds were collected. Late Bronze Age graves were not registered in the trial excavations, which is due to the relatively small <b>excavated</b> <b>surface,</b> as well as the fact that it was not possible to excavate a surface which covered incinerated remains and on which shards of ceramic vessels had previously been collected. Other Late Bronze Age grave finds from the Požega Basin have also been described in Požega and Grabarje, though the number of contemporary settlement finds is somewhat larger. It is assumed that the finds from Vlatkovac belong to the northern edge of the Barice-Gređani group distribution area, whose northern border passes along the southern slopes of Krndija and Papuk. The results of trial excavations in Vlatkovac suggest the existence of an outstanding prehistoric site with remains of Sopot and Lasinja culture settlements as well as a Late Bronze Age Barice-Gređani group cemetery from the early phase of the Urnfield culture (13 th- 12 th century BC).

Tim su iskopavanjima istraženi ostaci triju ranosrednjovjekovnih objekata. Prvi, manji objekt u očuvanom dijelu naglašeno je izduženoga ovaloidnog oblika, dok su druga dva kvadratičnoga oblika. Zapune objekata ispunjene su tamnosmeđesivom zemljom, ulomcima keramike, mnoštvom životinjskih zubiju i kostiju, lijepa te nešto metalnih predmeta. Osim ostataka triju objakata, evidentiran je i jedan kanal koji se protezao smjerom SZ-JI, zapunjen tamnosmeđesivom zemljom, garom i sporadičnim nalazima keramike, te jedan ovalni ukop zapunjen tamnosmeđesivom zemljom bez materijalnih ostataka. Prema pokretnim materijalnim ostacima, pronađenima u objektima, poglavito malih noževa kratkog sječiva, nekoliko tipova malih keramičkih pršljenova za ribarske mreže, koštanih alatki od kojih je zanimljiv harpun te metalnih većih i manjih udica, može se zaključiti da u gospodarstvu stanovnika naselja na Ledinama veliku ulogu igra ribolov. Uzrok napuštanju naselja koje je postojalo tijekom 10. i 11. stoljeća (prema C 14 analizi), vjerojatno je bilo plavljenje Drave. In {{the period}} from 10 July to 5 August 2004 the Institute for Archaeology from Zagreb in {{co-operation}} with the Koprivnica Town Museum, led by Tajana Sekelj Ivančan, Ph. D., continued systematic archaeological excavations at the Ledine site in Torčec (Appendix 1). In the excavations of 2004, three cultural fillings, or closed units, i. e. three early medieval structures were investigated (Appendix 2). One of the structures had a longitudinal oval shape, with rounded corners, and in the dark brown, 18 cm thick filling, dappled with soot, {{a small number of}} small ceramic fragments and some gravel were found. The second facility stood out as a dark rectangular stain. In the 0, 24 m thick filling, dappled with charcoal and soot, plenty of ceramic vessel and daub fragments, two smaller iron knives and sporadic animal bones were collected. The third structure is square in shape with apparently rounded corners and an extended part on the northern side. In the 63 cm thick filling a larger quantity of daub was found, as well as fragments of several ceramic vessels, a large number of animal bones and teeth, several iron artifacts, dross, six small ceramic whorls and a dressed bone artifact were found. The central part of the pit was the deepest, becoming “atter toward the margins, whereas three holes from wooden pillars were registered on the eastern and western margin of the pit (Fig. 1). In the subsequently conducted controls of a larger area a canal was registered, extending in NW-SE direction. In {{the upper part of the}} 65 cm thick canal filling sporadic finds of extraordinarily fragmentised ceramics and crushed gravel were unearthed, whereas a metal artifact - a harpoon - stands out. Somewhat more to the south of the canal an oval burial without any material remains was registered. According to movable material remains, particularly small short-bladed knives that were used to gut and scale fish, several types of small ceramic fishing net whorls, bone tools, of which the harpoon is particularly interesting, and larger and smaller metal hooks, we can conclude that the basic industry of the inhabitants of the settlement along the Drava River meander in Ledine was fishing. At a time when the meander was filled with water it was an inexhaustible source of food to the ancient population of Torčec. The river was probably also the direct cause for abandonment of the settlement. According to C 14 dating, the settlement existed in the tenth and eleventh centuries, and at that time or immediately thereafter there was probably a flood which, as the archaeological excavations show, destroyed the uppermost parts of the facilities and the presumed buildings between them.

Istraženi su zapadni i istočni dio kule do razine sterilnog sloja laporaste zdravice, a središnji je dio zbog statičke sigurnosti kule istražen samo površinski. Istraženi arheološki slojevi pripadali su nekadašnjem otpadnom materijalu koji je uz slojeve sterilne gline bio iskorišten za nasipavanje unutrašnjosti kule pri njezinu niveliranju. Pri dnu istočnog dijela kule pronađen je sloj zapečene zemlje koji je potjecao od strukture defnirane kao ognjište. Taj je sloj radiokarbonskom analizom datiran u vrijeme od druge polovice 13. st. do kraja 14. st. Južno uz ognjište pronađeni su i ostaci nekadašnje drvene palisadne ograde. Glavninu pokretnog arheološkog materijala čine ulomci grube kuhinjske keramike i životinjskih kostiju. Izdvojeno je i nekoliko ulomaka finije stolne keramike koji svjedoče o luksuznijem životu tadašnjeg plemstva. Pokretne nalaze okvirno je moguće datirati od kraja 14. do početka 16. stoljeća. Veliki Tabor castle {{is one of}} {{the best}} {{preserved}} fortresses in continental Croatia. In the course of many centuries it changed owners and underwent numerous alterations and upgrades. The castle is structured around the late Gothic tower and palace, surrounded by the early 16 th century Renaissance ring of defense in the form of a horse-shoe, comprising four towers. Historical sources mention Veliki Tabor for the first time in 1502, that is, we find it in the documents which accompanied Ivaniš Korvin’s donation of the castle to the noble family Rattkay. However, the original builders of the tower and the palace remain unknown. Fortresses appeared on the Croatian territory in the 13 th and 14 century. Land Archaeology Department of the Croatian Conservation Institute conducted archaeological research in the tower “C” ground foor in the summer of 2009, and the works were financed by the Ministry of Culture as a part of the project that envisaged several years of conservation and restoration work on it. Archaeological excavations in the interior of the tower “C” ground foor, in terms of the layout, the smallest of the four towers, were aimed at its western and eastern part all the way to the level of the sterile humus layer of marl, while its central part remained only superficially explored for static security reasons. Excavations in the eastern part led to the discovery of a layer of baked earth, originating from the structure defined as a fireplace. Radiocarbon analysis dated it to the period between the second half of the 13 th and the end of the 14 th century. South of the fireplace, remains of the former wooden palisade fence were found. Movable archaeological finds from tower “C” originate from the period between the late 14 th and early 16 th century. Although the <b>excavated</b> <b>surface</b> of the tower is small compared to the previously explored area of the Veliki Tabor castle, it seems that the research in the tower resulted in an array of new and interesting information. Most finds are fragments of coarse pottery intended for everyday use. Its forms, and the way they are decorated, belong to a common inventory of late medieval pottery. Also featured are more luxurious, imported specimens, such as the fragments of Spanish majolica and Celje style glasses. The finds include fragments of a ceramic pot with seals around the perimeter, belonging to Austrian ceramics. Other ceramic, metal and glass finds belong to the usual inventory of late medieval forts, old towns and also villages. Fragments of simple bowl-shaped tiles, ceramic tiles, glass window panes, a bronze thimble for sewing, tile fittings, iron crossbow arrowheads and rife ammunition provide interesting information about what a late medieval city looked like, but they also tell us about some activities that must have taken place there. A special find from tower “C” is the silver one-sided pfennig that was minted in Salzburg in 1508 for Leonhard von Keutschach (1495 – 1519). The treated material is closest to the analogies found in the Vrbovec burg. Numerous analogies come from the wider area of Slovenia, Serbia, Austria and Hungary. The luxurious life of the nobility of the time is signalled by the remains of delicacy sea shells and snail shells they feasted on. The layers these finds originate from probably entered the tower during its construction in the early 16 th century, when former waste material was used for levelling. Most of the movable items should be placed in the 15 th century which, as seen by numerous similarities between the archaeological finds, was marked by the great influence the Counts of Celje had on our region...|$|E
40|$|U arheološkim iskopavanjima ranosrednjovjekovnog naselja Prečno pole I. u 2008. godini istražene su tri sonde, ukupne površine 692 m 2. Dvije su sonde (S- 5 i S- 7) u kojima se očekivalo eventualno rasprostiranje ranosrednjovjekovnoga groblja, bile u potpunosti sterilne. U sondi S- 6 istražen je dio naselja prepoznat prijašnjih godina i evidentirano je 9 novih kulturnih tvorevina. Od toga mogu se izdvojiti tri naseobinska objekta od kojih je jedan, onaj smješten najbliže meandru, veoma dobro očuvan te je dao osnovne konstruktivne i oblikovne elemente ranosrednjovjekovnih kuća u ovom naselju otvorenog tipa. Od pokretnih nalaza iz istraženih objekata valja izdvojiti polovicu mlinskog kamena - žrvnja, brončanu karičicu, spiralni ulomak karičice, željeznu britvu, ulomke željeznih nožića te ulomak koštanog češlja. Od keramičkih nalaza pronađeni su ulomci pršljena te mnoštvo ulomaka običnih kuhinjskih lonaca i pekača. Na prikupljenim ulomcima ističu se ukrasi češljastom valovnicom na ramenima i trbusima posuda, ali i na vanjskim i unutarnjim stranama rubova jednostavnih profilacija. Sve su to odlike ranosrednjovjekovne keramike koja se uklapa u dosadašnje rezultate istraživanja. Ovo naselje prostiralo se uz sam južni rub isušenog meandra, a oblicima kuća i pokretnim nalazima, uklapa se u sliku naseljavanja poznatu u okolnim zemljama jugoistočne Europe tijekom ranoga srednjega vijeka. In {{the archaeological}} {{excavations}} conducted in 2008, three archaeological digs were opened. The overall <b>excavated</b> <b>surface</b> {{in all three}} trial trenches (S- 5, S- 6 and S- 7) was 692 m². Two trial trenches (S- 5 and S- 7), in which a possible early medieval cemetery was expected, were completely sterile. Therefore, based on the excavation results thus far, {{it can be concluded}} that the skeletal burial found in the archaeological excavations of 2005, dated {{with the help of the}} C 14 analysis to the latter half of the eight century, was individual; no other burials were discovered. The cemetery was probably at another nearby, yet undefined place. Trial trench S- 6 yielded very good results. The continuation of the settlement excavated in past years was registered in it. A total of nine cultural formations were excavated. Among them, three residential structures can be identified, of which the one situated closest to the meander was very well preserved, and it brought about the basic construction and form elements of early medieval houses in this open-type settlement. The form of residential houses was rectangular, with an east-west orientation, with a round fireplace at the western side of the structure. At the southern side of the fireplace, within the structure itself, in its western part, there was a thick wooden pillar that bore some type of roof structure. The roof structure may have leaned on the structure’s eastern periphery, since a slight, round broadening was registered, without digs along the line of the pillar bearing the roof construction. At the western side of the structure there was a deep fireplace, possibly with a domed construction, the remains of which collapsed into the structure further east. The form and construction elements of the other two, rather poorly preserved residential structures can only be assumed, since all excavated structures were very shallow, directly beneath ploughed soil, and in some parts only several centimetres were preserved. Besides residential houses, two round formations and one oval shallow formation were found; it is not possible to identify their primary function with certainty, but it is possible that they represent some auxiliary structures near the houses. Furthermore, two shallow pillars and a round, smaller formation were registered and excavated as well, also of unknown function. Among the moveable finds from the excavated structures, those worth mentioning are: half of a millstone/grindstone, a bronze ring, a spiral fragment of a ring, an iron razor, fragments of small iron knives, and a fragment of a bone comb. Out of the ceramics, fragments of whorls were found, and numerous fragments of simple kitchen pots and baking pans. On the collected fragments, decorations with a combed wavy line on the vessel’s shoulders and bellies, but also on the outer and inner sides of simple-profiled brims stand out. All of these are characteristics of early medieval pottery which fit well in the excavation results thus far. The excessively large surface of the archaeological digs in S- 5, S- 6 and S- 7 of approximately 700 m² was excavated this year, which – along with the approximately 208 m² of S- 4, opened in 2007, with no archaeological finds in the southern zones, leads to the conclusion that the medieval settlement extended along the southern periphery of the meander, and that in the follow-up of the excavations trial trenches should be dug directly along the old, dried-out branch of the Drava River. The selection of settlement positions along old meanders and river beds, and the square or rectangular shape of the structures comply with the picture of settlements known in other nearby South-east European countries in the Early Middle Ages...|$|E
40|$|In deep {{underground}} {{tunnels and}} facilities, high in-situ stress magnitude can cause brittle failure in hard rock. As mines and nuclear waste disposal facilities pursue deeper, the stress magnitude increases with depth, causing the failure probability to grow. The understanding and the reliable prediction {{of the failure}} process {{is the key to}} optimal layout design and adequate rock support measures that enable cost-effective and safe construction of deep facilities. The spalling phenomenon occurs as a strong compressive pressure induces crack growth behind <b>excavated</b> <b>surfaces</b> and as buckling of thin rock slabs occurs. The spalling is initiated in the region where maximum tangential stress occurs, and it results in a V-shaped notch. This paper describes how sophisticated spalling prediction methods can be applied in order to determine adequate tunnel support design in Posiva's ONKALO. The general methods and a case study are described. The results of different prediction methods are compared to achieve an understanding of the outcome range and to make a comparative analysis. The main analysis method is a state-of-the-art three-dimensional finite element method (3 -D FEM), and the area of interest is divided into several models to achieve the best accuracy possible. The model is enhanced with quadratic elements to gain the accuracy of elements half the size or even smaller. The validity of the result is studied with the 3 -D BEM and a displacement discontinuity method (DDM), which is used to describe the spalling process. In addition, a statistical reference analysis was done by using a Monte Carlo spalling simulation. The prediction results will also be compared later on with in-situ behaviour to conduct back-analysis. The support design of the area of interest is studied for the design proces...|$|R
40|$|Release of {{fuel oils}} during {{transportation}} or during roadside accidents is very common. According to the figures available, {{number of incidents}} involving hazmat accidents has increased from 7, 297 in 1990 to 14, 443 in 1999. In most cases the standard cleanup protocol is followed {{but in some cases}} {{it is not possible to}} follow the protocol because of the accident locations. It is particularly difficult to <b>excavate</b> <b>surface</b> soil where utility lines are very near to the surface and services of utility agencies are not immediately available. In such situations, it is considered safe to use effective bioremediation solution for on-site cleanup. In these situations, AgroRemed has been employed with successful results. Two case studies are presented in this paper. One case demonstrates revitalization of roadside vegetation through bioremediation after a spill of motor oil and another case describes application of AgroRemed to sites affected by diesel spill with underlying utility cables. The TPH of the soil after bioremediation was reduced by more than 95 % from 65, 000 ppm in the first case, while in the second case the TPH was found to be below the detectable values from the initial value of 47, 000 ppm. VaporRemed was employed for fumes originating from the spilled site and where the spill had affected the fertility of soil, AgroRemed was used. Both these products are available in a ready to use liquid form and are known to effectively bioremediate the contaminated soils and fumes in a very short period of time. The advantage of these products is that they de-toxify the contaminated soils and facilitate growth of vegetation. The Virginia Department of Transportation was actively involved in the cleanup operations, and although the Virginia DEQ was not directly involved, the department reviewed the data to confirm that the values of TPH were below the accepted levels...|$|R
