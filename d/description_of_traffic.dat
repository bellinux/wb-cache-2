These models incorporate (nonlocal and time-delayed) braking and acceleration terms which are consistent with realistic time scales. Correlation assumptions are made such that braking and acceleration terms depend only on macroscopic densities and the relative speeds {{with respect to the}} average speed; the braking term includes lane change probabilities, and reasonable assumptions on the dependencies of these probabilities on the traffic situation lead to multivalued fundamental diagrams, consistent with traffic observations...|$|R
40|$|A {{generalized}} {{version of}} the Nagel-Schreckenberg-Model <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> flow is presented that allows for continuous values of the velocities and spatial co-ordinates. It is shown that this generalization reveals structures of the dynamics that are masked by the discreteness of the original model and thus helps to clarify the physical interpretation of the dynamics considerably. It is shown numerically that the transition leading from the free flow regime to the congested flow regime bears strong similarities with a first order phase transition in equilibrium thermodynamics. A similar behaviour is observed in more complicated microscopic models and in hydrodynamical <b>descriptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> flow, putting the model within a broader context of other models <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> flow. An additional advantage of this continuous model {{is that it is}} much easier to calibrate with empirical data, only slightly decreasing numerical efficiency...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that Ethernet LAN traffic is statistically self-similar, {{that none of}} the commonly used traffic models is able to capture this fra([al-like behavior, that such behavior has serious implications for the design, control, and analysis of high-speed, cell-based networks, and that aggregating streams <b>of</b> such <b>traffic</b> typically intensifies the self-similarity (“burstiness”) instead of smoothing it. Our conclusions are supported by a rigorous statistical analysis of hundreds of millions of high quality Ethernet traffic measurements colleeted between 1999 and 1992, coupled with a discussion of tbe underlying mathematical and statistical properties of self-similarity and their relationship with actual network behavior. We also present traffic models based on self-similar stochastic processes that provide simple, accurate, and realistic <b>descriptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> scenarios expected during B-ISDN deployment...|$|R
