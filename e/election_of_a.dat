5|$|After the {{declaration}} of war, Barkley supported bills implementing conscription and raising revenue for the fight. Between August and October 1918, he joined an unofficial congressional delegation that toured Europe, surveying the tactical situation and meeting with leaders there. Like Wilson, he supported U.S. ratification of the Treaty of Versailles and participation in the League of Nations, but both measures failed after the <b>election</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> more conservative Congress in 1918.|$|E
5|$|An {{unprecedented}} {{event was}} {{the visit of}} Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, who arrived incognito in Rome on March 6 and was allowed to enter the conclave. He stayed there two weeks, freely debating with the electors. Fortunately, he did not press them but only expressed the wish for the <b>election</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pope who {{would be able to}} carry out his duties with the proper respect for the secular rulers.|$|E
5|$|Connecticut did {{not create}} a state {{constitution}} for itself until several decades after it became a state; until 1818, the state operated under the provisions of its colonial charter. The charter called for the <b>election</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> governor every year, {{but not more than}} once every two years, with the term commencing on the second Thursday in May.|$|E

5|$|Michigan was {{admitted}} to the Union on January 26, 1837. The original 1835 Constitution of Michigan provided for the <b>election</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> governor and a lieutenant governor every 2 years. The fourth and current constitution of 1963 increased this term to four years. There was no term limit on governors until a constitutional amendment effective in 1993 limited governors to two terms.|$|E

5|$|According to Tino's account, {{on the day}} of the election, Selvo was {{attending}} mass for the funeral of the late Doge at the new monastery church of San Nicolò built under Domenico Contarini on Lido, an island in the Venetian Lagoon. The location was ideal for the funeral of a Doge not only because St Mark's Basilica was under construction at the time, but the new church was also spacious enough to hold a fairly large number of people. The location also proved ideal for the <b>election</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new Doge for the very same reasons.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the conclave, Alessandro Farnese, the cardinal-nephew of Paul III, and his faction of four or five {{cardinals}} (including Ranuccio Farnese and Guido Ascanio Sforza), whom Guise had counted among the French faction, began supporting the second choice of the Holy Roman Emperor, Reginald Pole, apparently having received assurances that Ottavio Farnese's claim to the Duchy of Parma would be supported by Charles V. On December 5, Pole received twenty-six votes, only two short of the requisite two-thirds majority, prompting French ambassador Claude d'Urfé to rush {{to the door of the}} conclave, demanding that the conclave wait for the French cardinals, whom he claimed were in Corsica, and threatening that the <b>election</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pope in their absence would be likely to cause a schism.|$|E
5|$|Auckland's {{population}} growth, {{as evidenced}} in the 2001 census, {{led to the}} formation for the 2002 general <b>election</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new electorate called Helensville, which covered the north-western corner of the Auckland urban area. Key beat long-serving National MP Brian Neeson (whose own Waitakere seat had moved on paper to being a Labour seat through the boundary changes) for the National Party Helensville selection. At the 2002 election Key won the seat with a majority of 1,705, ahead of Labour's Gary Russell, with Neeson, now standing as an independent, coming third. Key won re-election with ease at the 2005 election garnering 63% of votes cast in Helensville, and increased his majority again in 2008, gaining 73% of the electorate vote.|$|E

5|$|Following the <b>election</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> former royal clerk as Pope Clement V in 1305, {{the king}} was able to secure the archbishop's exile that same year. Upon the {{succession}} of Edward's son, Edward II, Winchelsey was {{allowed to return to}} England after the new king petitioned the pope to allow his return. Winchelsey soon joined the king's enemies, however, and was the only bishop to object to the return of the king's favourite, Piers Gaveston. Winchelsey died in 1313. Although miracles were alleged to have happened at his tomb, an attempt to have him declared a saint was unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Frank E. Holman, {{president}} of the American Bar Association (ABA), called attention to Federal court decisions, notably Missouri v. Holland, which he claimed could give international treaties and agreements precedence over the United States Constitution and {{could be used by}} foreigners to threaten American liberties. Senator Bricker was influenced by the ABA's work and first introduced a constitutional amendment in 1951. With substantial popular support and the <b>election</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Republican president and Congress in the elections of 1952, together with support from many Southern Democrats, Bricker's plan seemed destined to be sent to the individual states for ratification.|$|E
5|$|In 1911 another Royal Commission {{investigation}} into Fremantle Prison recommended closing the facility. Its report was {{ignored by the}} state government, which was more concerned with building infrastructure such as roads and schools than the plight of its prisoners. However, there was a rapid change in prison policy, with {{the appointment of a}} superintendent, Hugh Hann, who had recent English and colonial experience, and the <b>election</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Labor government with members interested in penal reform. One immediate result was the dismantling of the separate system at Fremantle Prison and the demolition of the separate exercise yards in 1912.|$|E

5|$|In his {{campaign}} for a fourth term, Johnson concentrated on three issues: slavery, homesteads and judicial elections. He defeated his opponent, Nathaniel G. Taylor, in August 1849, with a greater margin of victory than in previous campaigns. When the House convened in December, the party division caused by the Free Soil Party precluded {{the formation of the}} majority needed to elect a Speaker. Johnson proposed adoption of a rule allowing <b>election</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Speaker by a plurality; some weeks later others took up a similar proposal, and Democrat Howell Cobb was elected.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{legislative}} session of Bradley's term, 75 bills were filed, including {{a ban on}} the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, a measure to make carrying a concealed weapon a felony, and a bill banning gambling at racetracks and church fairs. Competing measures affecting pool halls were introduced – one would have lifted most of the restrictions on their operation while another would have banned them altogether. Bradley added an anti-lynching law to the legislative agenda. However, none of these bills were acted on; {{the vast majority of the}} Assembly's attention during the session was focused on the <b>election</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> U.S. Senator.|$|E

5|$|Most {{references}} say {{the position}} {{was first used}} in this way on 20 March 1844 to allow Sir George Henry Rose, Member for Christchurch, to resign his seat in Parliament, but the official book containing appointments to the Stewardship (lodged in The National Archives under catalogue reference E 197/1) indicates that Patrick Chalmers, Member for Montrose Burghs, was appointed to this office on 6 April 1842 {{so that he could}} resign due to ill health. The writ ordering the <b>election</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> replacement MP was changed so that it appeared Chalmers had been appointed to the Chiltern Hundreds.|$|E
5|$|Now Vice President-elect, Johnson {{was anxious}} to {{complete}} the work of re-establishing civilian government in Tennessee, although the timetable for the <b>election</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new governor did not allow it to take place until after Inauguration Day, March 4. He hoped to remain in Nashville to complete his task, but was told by Lincoln's advisers {{that he could not}} stay, but would be sworn in with Lincoln. In these months, Union troops finished the retaking of eastern Tennessee, including Greeneville. Just before his departure, the voters of Tennessee ratified a new constitution, abolishing slavery, on February 22, 1865. One of Johnson's final acts as military governor was to certify the results.|$|E
