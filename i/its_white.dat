5|$|Phallus impudicus has {{the same}} overall {{appearance}} as P.hadriani, but is distinguished by <b>its</b> <b>white</b> volva. Another similar stinkhorn, P.ravenelii has a smooth, not reticulate head.|$|E
5|$|A {{distinctive}} bird, the blue-faced honeyeater differs in coloration {{from the}} duller-plumaged friarbirds, miners and wattlebirds, {{and it is}} {{much larger than the}} similarly coloured Melithreptus honeyeaters. Subspecies albipennis with <b>its</b> <b>white</b> wing patch has been likened to a khaki-backed butcherbird in flight.|$|E
5|$|One {{particular}} cultivar {{lacks the}} usual orange pigment due to carotene, owing <b>its</b> <b>white</b> colour to a recessive gene for tocopherol (vitamin E), but this cultivar and wild carrots {{do not provide}} nutritionally significant amounts of vitamin E.|$|E

50|$|The related western North American Veratrum californicum (white false hellebore, corn lily) can be {{distinguished}} from sympatric var. eschscholzianum by <b>its</b> <b>whiter</b> flowers and the erect side branches of the inflorescence.|$|R
5|$|Hygrophoropsis was {{originally}} circumscribed in 1888 by German mycologist Joseph Schröter as a subgenus of Cantharellus. It contained a single species, the widespread H.aurantiaca, {{commonly known as}} the false chanterelle. German naturalist Bernhard Studer-Steinhäuslin concluded in 1900 that the fungus was more appropriately placed in the genus Clitocybe, based on <b>its</b> <b>white</b> spores, decurrent gills, and lack of a ring on the stipe. This classification was adopted in the early writings of influential mycologist Rolf Singer, who in 1943 proposed that Hygrophoropsis should be a subgenus of Clitocybe.|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta was a {{divisive}} figure; prior to Kenyan independence, many of <b>its</b> <b>white</b> settlers regarded {{him as an}} agitator and malcontent, although across Africa he gained widespread respect as an anti-colonialist. During his presidency, {{he was given the}} honorary title of Mzee and lauded as the Father of the Nation. His rulership was criticised as dictatorial and authoritarian, of favouring Kikuyu over other ethnic groups, and of overseeing a growth in corruption and cronyism which have generated long-term problems for Kenya.|$|E
5|$|Known as baka or baka ni viti in Fiji, Ficus obliqua {{has many}} of its parts used in Fijian {{traditional}} medicine, and was previously held to be sacred there. <b>Its</b> <b>white</b> sap {{has been used for}} painful or swollen joints and limbs or boils, or diluted with water and drunk to improve breast milk. Liquid extracted from the root bark has been used for headaches or, when diluted, to improve health after childbirth, and the leaves are applied to venereal lesions. The species has been traditionally used for boils in Samoa and Tonga.|$|E
50|$|The barred tinamou is {{approximately}} 25 cm in length. It is yellowish-buff with heavy bars of black on its back, <b>its</b> throat is <b>white,</b> <b>its</b> front {{and sides of}} neck and breast are pale grey, <b>its</b> belly is <b>white,</b> <b>its</b> flanks are cream barred with black, and its head and neck are chestnut in color with legs that are olive-green. The female is paler on back.|$|R
50|$|The rusty tinamou is 27 to(-) 29 cm in length. Its {{upper parts}} are rufous boldly barred with black, <b>its</b> throat is <b>white,</b> <b>its</b> breast is bright rufous, <b>its</b> belly is <b>white,</b> and <b>its</b> flanks are barred black.

5|$|Mycena flavoalba bears {{resemblance}} to {{some members of}} the genus Hemimycena, such as H.lactea and H.delectabilis. It can be distinguished from these species by <b>its</b> <b>white</b> to yellowish cap, and differences in the shape of both its spores and caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem). H.conidiogena, a Spanish species newly described from in 2005, is also similar in appearance, but differs in the distribution of pigment in the cap, and the differential staining in response to the dye cresyl blue—M.flavoalba is positive, while H.conidiogena is negative.|$|E
5|$|The Calais Lighthouse (Le phare de Calais) {{was built}} in 1848, {{replacing}} the old watch tower as the lighthouse of the port. The 55 metre high tower was electrified in 1883 and automated in 1992. The staircase has 271 steps {{leading up to the}} lantern. By day it is easily distinguishable from other coastal lighthouses by <b>its</b> <b>white</b> color and black lantern. The lighthouse was classified as a historical monument on 22 November 2010.|$|E
5|$|The red-billed tropicbird can be {{differentiated}} {{from the}} other tropicbirds by its red bill in combination with <b>its</b> <b>white</b> tail streamers. The slightly smaller red-tailed tropicbird has red rather than white tail streamers, and the white-tailed tropicbird can be differentiated by its smaller size, black stripe along its upperwing coverts, and its yellow-orange bill. Juvenile red-billed tropicbirds have more heavily barred upperparts than juveniles of other species. In flight, the royal tern can {{be confused with the}} adult red-billed tropicbird but can be distinguished by the former's less direct flight pattern and its lack of tail streamers.|$|E

5|$|Three Himalayan {{subspecies}} of Eurasian treecreeper are now sometimes given full species {{status as}} Hodgson's treecreeper, for example by BirdLife International, {{but if they}} are retained as subspecies of Eurasian, they have to be distinguished from three other South Asian treecreepers. The plain tail of Eurasian treecreeper differentiates it from bar-tailed treecreeper, which has a distinctive barred tail pattern, and <b>its</b> <b>white</b> throat is an obvious difference from brown-throated treecreeper. Rusty-flanked treecreeper is more difficult to separate from Eurasian, but has more contrasting cinnamon, rather than buff, flanks.|$|E
5|$|Abiodun Alao of King's College London {{marks the}} Entumbane episode as {{the start of}} the Zimbabwe National Army's politicisation. The ex-Rhodesians' enthusiasm and success during the battle, coupled with Mugabe's {{readiness}} to deploy them, convinced many in ZAPU that ZANU–PF and the white community had united against them, and intensified ZAPU opposition to the government. ZIPRA guerrillas deserted from the assembly points and the National Army en masse following the rebellion's failure, fearing for their safety. Mugabe's sense of resolve regarding his political rivals was greatly strengthened, meanwhile; Entumbane satisfied him that white army officers and airmen could be counted on in future conflicts with ZAPU. The Entumbane engagement was the RAR's last—its companies were allocated to other 1Brigade units later in 1981 during the military reform process—but a number of <b>its</b> <b>white</b> officers subsequently led units of the Zimbabwean special forces during the 1980s. Dyck, for example, headed the 1st Parachute Battalion.|$|E
5|$|Exponents of the universalist, anti-racist {{approach}} {{believe that}} the deities of Northern Europe can call anyone to their worship, regardless of ethnic background. This group rejects the folkish emphasis on race, believing that even if unintended, {{it can lead to}} the adoption of racist attitudes toward those of non-Northern European ancestry. Anti-racist practitioners such as Stephan Grundy have emphasized the fact that ancient Northern Europeans were known to marry and have children with members of other ethnic groups, and that in Norse mythology the Æsir also did the same with Vanir, Jötun, and humans, thus using such points to critique the racialist view. Universalists welcome practitioners of Heathenry who are not of Northern European ancestry; for instance, there are Jewish and African American members of the U.S.-based Troth, while many of <b>its</b> <b>white</b> members are married to spouses from different racial groups. While sometimes retaining the idea of Heathenry as an indigenous religion, proponents of this view have sometimes argued that Heathenry is indigenous to the land of Northern Europe, rather than indigenous to any specific race.|$|E

5|$|In general, A.subrubescens can be {{distinguished}} from other Albatrellus species by <b>its</b> <b>white</b> cap that becomes orange when bruised, its simple-septate hyphae, small amyloid spores, and habitat under pines. In the field, Albatrellus ovinus is difficult to differentiate from A.subrubescens due to its similar appearance. A.ovinus usually lacks the violet color often seen in the cap and stem of A.subrubescens. Microscopic characteristics {{can be used to}} reliably distinguish the two species: the spores of A.subrubescens are amyloid, in contrast to those of A.ovinus, and A.ovinus spores are smaller, typically 3.8–4.6 by 3.3–3.5µm. Other similar species include A.tianschanicus, described from the Altai Mountains in East-Central Asia, and the Japanese species A.cantharellus. Unlike A.subrubescens, these species have hairy scales on the surface of their caps, and the scales are darker than the spaces between the scales. Also, the scales of A.subrubescens are not much darker than the area between the scales. Both of these Asian species have larger spores than A.subrubescens: those of A.cantharellus are 4.5–7 by 4–5.5µm, while those of A.tianschanicus are 5–7 by 4–5µm.|$|E
5|$|Leucopholiota decorosa is {{a species}} of fungus in the Tricholomataceae family of mushrooms. Commonly known as the {{decorated}} pholiota, it is distinguished by its fruit body which is covered with pointed brown, curved scales on the cap and stem, and by <b>its</b> <b>white</b> gills. Found in the eastern United States, France, and Pakistan, it is saprobic, growing on the decaying wood of hardwood trees. L.decorosa was first described by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck as Agaricus decorosus in 1873, and the species has been transferred to several genera in its history, including Tricholoma, Tricholomopsis, Armillaria, and Floccularia. Three American mycologists considered the species unique enough to warrant its own genus, and transferred it into the new genus Leucopholiota in a 1996 publication. Lookalike species with similar colors and scaly fruit bodies include Pholiota squarrosoides, Phaeomarasmius erinaceellus, and Leucopholiota lignicola. L.decorosa is considered an edible mushroom.|$|E
5|$|Mentmore Towers {{was chosen}} from twenty {{different}} locations for Wayne Manor, as Nolan and Crowley liked <b>its</b> <b>white</b> floors, {{which gave the}} impression of the manor as a memorial to Wayne's parents. The building chosen to represent Arkham Asylum was the National Institute for Medical Research building in Mill Hill, northwest London, England. The St Pancras railway station and the Abbey Mills Pumping Stations were used for Arkham's interiors. University College London was used for courtrooms. Some scenes, including the Tumbler pursuit, were filmed in Chicago at locations such as Lower Wacker Drive and 35 East Wacker. Authorities agreed to raise Franklin Street Bridge for a scene where access to the Narrows is closed.|$|E

5|$|The territory's {{contribution}} to the British cause during World War I had been very large in proportion to <b>its</b> <b>white</b> population, though troops had been mostly raised from scratch as {{there had been no}} professional standing army beforehand. Since the start of self-government in 1923, the colony had organised the all-white Rhodesia Regiment into a permanent defence force, complemented locally by the partly paramilitary British South Africa Police (BSAP). The Rhodesia Regiment comprised about 3,000 men, including reserves, in 1938. The country had fielded black troops during World War I, but since then had retained them only within the BSAP. A nucleus of airmen existed {{in the form of the}} Southern Rhodesian Air Force (SRAF), which in August 1939 comprised one squadron of 10 pilots and eight Hawker Hardy aircraft, based at Belvedere Airport near the capital Salisbury.|$|E
5|$|The top ten in {{the general}} {{classification}} finished together {{in the next five}} stages, which were mostly friendly to sprinters and breakaways. Stage 20 was another time trial, one with an uphill finish. This time trial was won convincingly by Leipheimer, as only Contador and Valverde were within a minute of his winning time. This ride put Leipheimer 46 seconds off Contador's time. With the Vuelta's final stage flat and largely ceremonial, akin to the Champs-Élysées stage in the Tour de France, this stood as the final result, with Contador winning the Vuelta to complete his career triple; he also won the combination classification and <b>its</b> <b>white</b> jersey. Minor controversy followed the Vuelta; Contador alleged that Leipheimer was not being a team player by seeming to ride the Stage 20 time trial with the aim of winning the Vuelta, after Contador had apparently been decided as the team's leader, though the team had not firmly chosen a leader as the race began.|$|E
5|$|The tufted tit-tyrant (Anairetes parulus) is {{a species}} of bird in the tyrant flycatcher family Tyrannidae. This species is found in western South America; its range {{stretches}} from southern Colombia south along the Andes mountains to Tierra del Fuego. It prefers to live in upper montane forests and shrublands; however, it is a habitat generalist {{and can be found}} across a wide range of ecosystems. The tufted tit-tyrant has three subspecies, including the nominate subspecies Anairetes parulus parulus, A. p. aequatorialis, and A. p. patagonicus, and is very closely related to the Juan Fernández tit-tyrant. It is very small with a distinctive and conspicuous crest. The bird's head is black overall with white supraloral and postocular stripes. Its dull grayish-brown back contrasts with <b>its</b> <b>white</b> throat and breast that are covered with black streaks and pale, unmarked yellow underbelly. There are few noticeable differences in plumage between the subspecies. It is a vocal flycatcher with a broad repertoire of songs.|$|E
