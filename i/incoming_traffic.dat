25|$|Firetrucks were {{positioned}} along De Waal Drive and the M3, {{as well as}} near UCT. The fire {{reached down}} to the M3's hospital bend, opposite Groote Schuur Hospital, thus causing traffic officials to close the road and re-route all <b>incoming</b> <b>traffic</b> onto Mowbray Main Road. Other roads which were closed include Tafelberg Road towards the Lower Cable Car Station and Signal Hill Road.|$|E

25|$|In January 2012, Travis County {{announced}} that Elroy Road—one {{of the two}} primary public access roads to the circuit—would receive an upgrade to handle the volume of <b>incoming</b> <b>traffic,</b> but not before {{the running of the}} 2012 race. At the time of the announcement, the unstable clay soils under the road surface had caused Elroy Road to gradually buckle and shift, necessitating the upgrade.|$|E
25|$|More complex attacks will however be hard {{to block}} with simple rules: for example, {{if there is an}} ongoing attack on port 80 (web service), it is not {{possible}} to drop all <b>incoming</b> <b>traffic</b> on this port because doing so will prevent the server from serving legitimate traffic. Additionally, firewalls may be too deep in the network hierarchy, with routers being adversely affected before the traffic gets to the firewall.|$|E
25|$|Passengers {{and crew}} of OG269 {{received}} little benefit from fire and rescue services. On {{the day of}} the crash, Phuket Airport did not meet the requirements of fire and rescue protection required by international standards. The foam and water in the trucks was used three days earlier in a training exercise and had not been restocked. When an airport has a reduction in fire or rescue capacity, ATC is required to notify <b>incoming</b> <b>traffic</b> of the reduction, but no notification was made.|$|E

30|$|The message {{loss rate}} in this {{experiment}} should be caused by network traffic overhead, interferences, shading, and message collisions. As previous mention, all nine nodes are actually receiving message from the whole network, so {{they have the same}} conditions of the <b>incoming</b> network <b>traffic.</b> Moreover, we can assume that the message rate in Table 9 indicates the intranode performance of single node. If a node cannot handle such <b>incoming</b> network <b>traffic</b> and cause output message loss, the loss rate should be increased with the message rate.|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} meet the case of {{application}} level DDoS attacks against cloud-based applications, approaches may be based on an application layer analysis, to indicate whether an <b>incoming</b> <b>traffic</b> bulk is legitimate or not and thus enable the triggering of elasticity decisions without the economical implications of a DDoS attack. These approaches mainly rely on an identified path of value inside the application and monitor the macroscopic progress of the requests in this path, towards the final generation of profit, through markers denoted as Key Completion Indicators.|$|E
25|$|Had the North Cross Route {{been built}} <b>incoming</b> <b>traffic</b> from the M11 {{would have been}} able to {{continue}} west from Hackney Wick junction on a motorway standard road past Dalston, Highbury, Camden Town, under West Hampstead to Kilburn (where a link to the M1 would have been built) and then west to Harlesden, where it would have connected with the West Cross Route, running south to connect with the A40, A4 and on to cross the Thames to connect with the South Cross Route.|$|E
25|$|A {{distributed}} denial-of-service (DDoS) is a cyber-attack {{where the}} perpetrator uses {{more than one}} unique IP address, often thousands of them. The <b>incoming</b> <b>traffic</b> flooding the victim originates from many different sources. This effectively {{makes it impossible to}} stop the attack simply by using ingress filtering. It also makes it very difficult to distinguish legitimate user traffic from attack traffic when spread across so many points of origin. As an alternative or augmentation of a DDoS, many attacks involve forging of IP sender addresses (IP address spoofing) also so that the location of the attacking machines cannot easily be identified and defeated.|$|E

40|$|Currently, we are {{witnessing}} a trend in network routers to include reconfigurable hardware structures to provide flexibility at improved performance levels when compared to software-only implementations. This permits the run-time reconfiguration of the hardware resources, i. e., to change their functionality (for example, from one scheduling algorithm to another), to adapt to changing network scenarios. In particular, different scheduling algorithms are more efficient in handling a specific mix of <b>incoming</b> packet <b>traffic</b> in terms of various criteria (e. g., delay, jitter, throughput, and packet loss). Therefore, reconfigurable hardware is able to provide improved performance levels and to allow more efficient algorithms to be utilized when different <b>incoming</b> packet <b>traffic</b> patterns are encountered. This project investigates the possibilities to improve upon end-to-end delays, jitter...|$|R
30|$|The studies [20 – 22] {{alleviate}} {{this problem}} by modifying the AQM design. In [20], the proposed algorithm rearranges the order of packets in the queue of the router and dynamically adjusts the packet dropping rate and the target queuing average size based on the packet arrival time, <b>incoming</b> <b>traffic's</b> requirements, and delay hint. The study in [21] uses three levels of RED to emulate the class-based design that each level sets parameters according to different traffic requirements and based on that determines if the incoming packet is accepted. The research in [22] provides different dropping rate adjusting algorithms for TCP and UDP with TCP-friendly property for the diversity traffic characteristics. However, the above surveyed algorithms cannot satisfy the delay and throughput requirements simultaneously since it only adopts one-queue design {{for all types of}} traffic.|$|R
25|$|The {{incoming}} {{section of}} the office, being fixed {{to the structure of}} the last four digits of the telephone number, had a limit of 10,000 phone numbers. In some of the urban areas where Panel was used, even a single square mile might have three or five times that many. Thus the incoming selectors of several separate switching entities shared floor space and staff, but required separate incoming trunk groups from distant offices. Sometimes an Office Select Tandem was used to distribute <b>incoming</b> <b>traffic</b> among the offices. This was a Panel office with no senders or other common control equipment; just one stage of selectors and accepting only the Office Brush and Office Group parameters. Panel Sender Tandems were also used when their greater capabilities were worth their additional cost.|$|E
500|$|Michael Vvyan, {{a member}} of the local gentry, was {{appointed}} as the first captain of St Mawes and the surrounding land in 1544, and was followed by Hannibal Vyvyan in 1561. On Vyvyan's death in 1603, his son, Sir Francis Vyvyan, became captain. The captains of St Mawes frequently argued with those of Pendennis Castle and in 1630 a legal dispute broke out about the rights to search and detain incoming shipping: both castles argued that they had a traditional right to do so. The Admiralty issued a compromise, proposing that the castles share the <b>incoming</b> <b>traffic.</b> Sir Francis was dismissed from office in 1632, accused of [...] "practising a variety of deceptions" [...] at St Mawes, including falsely claiming wages for non-existent members of the garrison, and was replaced by first Sir Robert Le Grys and then Thomas Howard, the Earl of Arundel and Surrey.|$|E

PAWP uses a collection of HTTP-level techniques to compensate any negative impact that traffic scheduling may have. PAWP does not require any client or web server modifications. In this paper, we describe our initial experiences with a PAWP implementation for 802. 11 b WLANs. Our experiments show savings of more than 50 % in the energy consumed by the WLAN interface. Finally, our experiences give us insights into possible browser improvements when power consumption is taken into account...|$|R
