25|$|A goalkeeper {{can also}} try to {{distract}} the taker by talking to them prior to the penalty being taken. Netherlands national team goalkeeper Tim Krul used this technique during the penalty shootout in the quarter-final match of the 2014 FIFA World Cup against Costa Rica. As the Costa Rican players were preparing to take the kick, Krul told them that he <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> going to put their penalty {{in order to get}} in their heads. This resulted in him saving two penalties and the Netherlands winning the shootout 4-3.|$|E
25|$|Seven people {{survived the}} impact, {{although}} they were all injured and in shock. One of the survivors assisted two others away from the wreck, which was burning, and they all rallied a distance away from the wreck. They stated to the press afterwards {{that they were all}} apathetic and in shock, and that none of them thought about the possibilities to search for help. Also, none of them <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>were.</b> They heard the search being carried out by helicopter and were therefore aware that they were being searched for. Two of the initial survivors later died, bringing the death toll to forty.|$|E
500|$|Other reviews {{disliked the}} lack of story or its {{presentation}} within Limbo. Justin Haywald of 1UP.com was critical of the lacking narrative, feeling that the game failed to explain {{the purpose of the}} constructed traps or rationale for how the game's world worked, and that the final act left him [...] "more confused than when [...] began". Haywald had contrasted Limbo to Braid, a similar platform game with minimalistic elements which communicates its metaphorical story to the player through in-game text. Roger Hargreaves of Metro stated that the game has [...] "very little evidence that [...] really <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> going with the game", citing the second half, when the player is traveling through a factory-type setting and where he felt the game became more like a typical two-dimensional platform game, and led to an anticlimactic ending; Hargreaves contrasted this to more gruesome elements of the first half, such as encountering corpses of children and having to use those as part of the puzzle-solving aspects.|$|E

6000|$|As he spoke, three solemn footmen {{came out}} of the lodge gate and {{assembled}} to assist the chauffeur to his room.
