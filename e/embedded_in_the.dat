A conjectured generalization of this result to all nonorientable surfaces says that a finite minimal forbidden subgraph for the nonorientable surface of genus ˜g can be written as the union of ˜g + 1 Kuratowski subgraphs such that the union of each pair of these fails to <b>embed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> projective plane, the union of each triple of these fails to <b>embed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Klein bottle if ˜g ≥ 2, and the union of each triple of these fails to <b>embed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> torus if ˜g ≥ 3.

40|$|This study {{presents}} a robust and semi-blind watermarking by embedding information into low frequency AC coefficients of Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Since the imperceptibility {{is the most}} significant issue <b>in</b> watermarking, <b>the</b> DC value is maintained unchanged. The proposed methods utilize the DC values of the neighboring blocks to predict the AC coefficients of the center block. The low frequency AC coefficients are modified to carry watermark information. The Least Mean Squares (LMS) is employed to yield the intermediate filters, cooperating with the neighboring DC coefficients to precisely predict the original AC coefficients. Two watermarking methods, namely Watermark <b>Embedding</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Predicted AC Coefficient (WEPAC) and Watermark <b>Embedding</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Original AC coefficient (WEOAC), are presented in this study. Moreover, many attacks are addressed to show the robustness of the proposed methods. Key words: Discrete cosine transform, digital watermarking, least mean squares, watermark <b>embedding</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> predicted ac coefficient, watermark <b>embedding</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original ac coefficient.
