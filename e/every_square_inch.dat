500|$|While {{the classic}} cottage garden {{is built around}} a cottage, many cottage-style gardens are created around houses and even estates such as Hidcote Manor, with its more {{intimate}} [...] "garden rooms". The cottage garden design is based more on principles than formulae: it has an informal look, with a seemingly casual mixture of flowers, herbs, and vegetables often packed into a small area. In spite of their appearances, cottage gardens have a design and formality that help give them their grace and charm. Due to space limitations, they are often in small rectangular plots, with practical functioning paths and hedges or fences. The plants, layout, and materials are chosen {{to give the impression}} of casualness and a country feel. Modern cottage gardens frequently use local flowers and materials, rather than those of the traditional cottage garden. What they share with the tradition is the unstudied look, the use of <b>every</b> <b>square</b> <b>inch,</b> and a rich variety of flowers, herbs, and vegetables.|$|E

2500|$|In response, activists {{organized}} the “Friends of West-Park” {{to protest the}} development while concurrently working toward a viable alternative plan as well as funds. The group principally feared the loss of air and light with the new tower. The co-chairman of Friends of West-Park stated that the group was not interested “in telling the church {{that it had to}} maintain itself for the community good without the community taking some role [...] formed a development company capable of doing what [...] say and working on a partnership with the church.” The [...] "Friends" [...] suggested selling Eidlitz's chapel for redevelopment to a non-profit, probably a school, to offset the cost of renovation, with neighboring buildings preparing to lease air rights. Most of the external walls would be preserved, restoring the sandstone and stained glass but not the original roof shape nor the forty-foot interior, which would be gutted. Its sanctuary would be raised to gallery level and fitted with movable seating; since divided windows already exist, the alteration would not be externally evident, leaving the commercially ideal ground floor for other uses, possibly social outreach or educational. One architect responsible for the sympathetic second plan explained that “successful rehabilitation allows the character and original intent of the first architect to come through. So the question is, If not <b>every</b> <b>square</b> <b>inch</b> is sacred turf, how much modification can the structure bear without losing what makes it special?” Rev. Brashear of West-Park was quoted as receptive to the community input but stated that the congregation, trustees, and various levels of the Presbytery are still deciding the unprotected church’s fate.|$|E

60|$|Tapestries, he said, {{were to the}} North of Europe what fresco was to the South--our climate, amongst other reasons, guiding us in {{our choice}} of {{material}} for wall-covering. England, France, and Flanders were the three great tapestry countries--Flanders with its great wool trade being the first in splendid colours and superb Gothic design. The keynote of tapestry, the secret of its loveliness, was, he told the audience, the complete filling up of <b>every</b> corner and <b>square</b> <b>inch</b> of surface with lovely and fanciful and suggestive design. Hence the wonder of those great Gothic tapestries where the forest trees rise in different places, one over the other, each leaf perfect in its shape and colour and decorative value, while in simple raiment of beautiful design knights and ladies wandered in rich flower gardens, and rode with hawk on wrist through long green arcades, and sat listening to lute and viol in blossom- starred bowers or by cool gracious water springs. Upon the other hand, when the Gothic feeling died away, and Boucher and others began to design, they gave us wide expanses of waste sky, elaborate perspective, posing nymphs and shallow artificial treatment.

50|$|Pounds per <b>square</b> <b>inch</b> {{absolute}} (psia) {{is used to}} make {{it clear}} that the pressure is relative to a vacuum rather than the ambient atmospheric pressure.

The converse is pounds per <b>square</b> <b>inch</b> gauge or pounds per <b>square</b> <b>inch</b> gauge (psig), indicating that the pressure is relative to atmospheric pressure. For example, a bicycle tire pumped up to 65 psi above local atmospheric pressure (say, 14.7 psia locally), will have a pressure of 65 + 14.7 = 79.7 psia or 65 psig.
