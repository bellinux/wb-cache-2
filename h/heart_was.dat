50|$|As far as {{the number}} of the abdal is concerned, there are 300 friends of Allah in the {{creation}} whose <b>hearts</b> <b>are</b> like that of Adam. There <b>are</b> 40 whose <b>hearts</b> <b>are</b> similar to the heart of Musa and 7 whose <b>hearts</b> <b>are</b> similar to the heart of Ibrahim. There <b>are</b> 5 whose <b>hearts</b> <b>are</b> like that of Jibra’il and 3 whose <b>hearts</b> <b>are</b> like that of Mika’il and one whose <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> like the <b>heart</b> of Israfil. When he (whose <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> like Israfil) dies, then one of the three whose <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> like Mika’il replaces him and one of the five (whose <b>hearts</b> <b>are</b> like Jibra’il) replaces him. One of the seven replaces one of the five, one of the forty replaces one of the seven and one of the three-hundred replaces one of the forty and a normal Muslim replaces one of the three-hundred. It is due to these 356 awliya that creation are given life and killed, due to them rain falls, vegetation grows and difficulties are removed. It is also believed that since the number of abdal is so near to the number of days in the lunar calendar, their role {{as a part of the}} cosmic order of the universe is justified.|$|R
5|$|Metro {{contended that}} though TumbleSeed was marketed as a roguelike, {{apart from its}} procedurally {{generated}} levels, it was closer in genre to traditional arcade games.

Walter (John Noble) and Peter recognize scars on the blood vessels leading to the heart, identifying the victim as one that received a heart transplant.

5|$|A {{temporary}} wooden effigy with {{a copper}} crown {{was made for}} the funeral; {{this is the first}} known use of a funeral effigy in England, and was probably necessary because of the condition of the King's body, which had been dead for three months. Edward's <b>heart</b> <b>was</b> removed, placed in a silver container, and later buried with Isabella at Newgate Church in London. His tomb includes a very early example of an English alabaster effigy, with a tomb-chest and a canopy made of oolite and Purbeck stone. Edward was buried in the shirt, coif and gloves from his coronation, and his effigy depicts him as king, holding a sceptre and orb, and wearing a strawberry-leaf crown. The effigy features a pronounced lower lip, and may be a close likeness of Edward.|$|E

Six days before the race began, RCS Sport (the {{organizers}} of the Giro) went back on the decision to exclude Astana and extended them a late invitation.

5|$|Eleanor {{probably}} {{hoped that}} Henry would be recognised as a saint, as his contemporary Louis IX of France had been; indeed, Henry's final tomb resembled {{the shrine of}} a saint, complete with niches possibly intended to hold relics. When the King's body was exhumed in 1290, contemporaries noted that the body was in perfect condition and that Henry's long beard remained well preserved, {{which at the time}} was considered to be an indication of saintly purity. Miracles began to be reported at the tomb, but Edward was sceptical about these stories. The reports ceased, and Henry was never canonised.
