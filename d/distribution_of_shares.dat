40|$|This paper investigates {{determinants}} <b>of</b> geographic <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>share</b> tenancy and analyzes its efficiency implications in pre-war Iwate prefecture, Japan. The <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>share</b> tenancy was {{attributable to}} risk represented by yield variability, {{which in turn}} was affected by seasonal winds called Yamase and topographic features. That risk raised transaction costs of adopting a fixed-rent tenancy associated with the common custom of rent reduction in Japan that mitigated the problem of risksharing. Estimation results suggest that risk, wealth, and strength of community ties were the main determinants of contract choice. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{statistically}} {{investigate the}} <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>share</b> {{price and the}} <b>distributions</b> <b>of</b> three common financial indicators using data from approximately 8, 000 companies publicly listed worldwide for the period 2004 - 2013. We find that the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>share</b> price follows Zipf's law; that is, it can be approximated by a power law distribution with exponent equal to 1. An examination <b>of</b> the <b>distributions</b> <b>of</b> dividends per <b>share,</b> cash flow per share, and {{book value per share}} - three financial indicators that can be assumed to influence corporate value (i. e. share price) - shows that these distributions can also be approximated by a power law distribution with power-law exponent equal to 1. We estimate a panel regression model in which share price is the dependent variable and the three financial indicators are explanatory variables. The two-way fixed effects model that was selected as the best model has quite high power for explaining the actual data. From these results, we can surmise that the reason why share price follows Zipf's law is that corporate value, i. e. company fundamentals, follows Zipf's law...|$|R

An imaging strategy to accurately define anatomic fusion, vascular anomalies, and other associated abnormalities {{is important for}} surgical planning and prognostic information. A conjoined female twin with a combined weight of 2. 8 [*]kg was born by emergency caeserean. Hence, a computed tomography scan of the thorax and entire abdomen at 1. 25 [*]mm slice thickness was performed to delineate the internal structures of the twins. CT-angiography defined specific vascular supply which determined the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>shared</b> structures between the twins. An echocardiogram showed four heart chambers with atrioventricular septal defect. To further evaluate the heart chambers, the twin was planned for gated cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Unfortunately, they succumbed 6 hours apart due to complication of septicemia. Magnetic resonance imaging and CT scan provide excellent anatomic detail, demonstrating organ position, shared viscera, and limited vascular anatomy, whilst angiography defined specific vascular supply, useful in determining the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>shared</b> structures between the twins in planning for surgery...|$|R
