5000|$|Franciscan <b>Fray</b> Pedro de Gante {{had already}} been evangelizing in Mexico since 1523. <b>Fray</b> Juan Galpión had offered himself as a missionary, but could not go himself; it was he {{organized}} the Twelve Franciscans with <b>Fray</b> Martín de Valencia as its head. The group consisted of <b>Fray</b> Martín de Valencia (their leader), <b>Fray</b> Francisco de Soto, <b>Fray</b> Martín de Coruña (also known as <b>Fray</b> Martín de Jesǘs), <b>Fray</b> Juan Juárez, <b>Fray</b> Antonio de Ciudad Rodrigo, <b>Fray</b> Toribio de Benavente Motolinia, García de Cisneros, <b>Fray</b> Luis de Fuensalida, Juan de Ribas, <b>Fray</b> Francisco Jiménez, <b>Fray</b> Andrés de Córdoba, and <b>Fray</b> Juan de Palos.

5|$|In DNA, fraying {{occurs when}} non-complementary regions exist {{at the end}} of an {{otherwise}} complementary double-strand of DNA. However, branched DNA can occur if a third strand of DNA is introduced and contains adjoining regions able to hybridize with the <b>frayed</b> regions of the pre-existing double-strand. Although the simplest example of branched DNA involves only three strands of DNA, complexes involving additional strands and multiple branches are also possible. Branched DNA can be used in nanotechnology to construct geometric shapes, see the section on uses in technology below.|$|E

The fictional guide also states that the guard provided the information on the way to escape, and deliberately chose not to warn Starkey of the <b>frayed</b> rope that would cause his fatal fall.|$|E
40|$|<b>Fray</b> is a serine/threonine kinase {{expressed}} by the peripheral glia of Drosophila, whose function is required for normal axonal ensheathment. Null <b>fray</b> mutants die early in larval development and have nerves with severe swelling and axonal defasciculation. The phenotype {{is associated with a}} failure of the ensheathing glia to correctly wrap peripheral axons. When the <b>fray</b> cDNA is expressed in the ensheathing glia of <b>fray</b> mutants, normal nerve morphology is restored. <b>Fray</b> belongs to a novel family of Ser/Thr kinases, the PF kinases, whose closest relatives are the PAK kinases. Rescue of the Drosophila mutant phenotype with PASK, the rat homolog of <b>Fray,</b> demonstrates a functional homology among these proteins and suggests that the <b>Fray</b> signaling pathway is widely conserved...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Fray</b> Pedro Baptista, {{superior}} of the Franciscan religious {{residing in}} Miako (Kyoto), attempted to mediate with the authorities, but without success. In fact he so angered Hideyoshi, {{that the latter}} ordered the suppression of Christianity. Twenty-six Christians were crucified on February 5, 1597 in Nagasaki. Besides <b>Fray</b> Pedro Baptista, they included <b>Fray</b> Martin de Aguirre, <b>Fray</b> Felipe de las Casas, <b>Fray</b> Gonçalo, <b>Fray</b> Francisco Blanco, <b>Fray</b> Francisco de San Miguel. In all there were 26 Franciscan and Jesuit priests and Japanese lay converts, including two boys.

5|$|Bristle {{toothbrush}}: According to a Library of Congress website, the Chinese {{have used}} the bristle toothbrush since 1498, {{during the reign of}} the Hongzhi Emperor (r. 1487–1505) of the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644); it also adds that the toothbrush was not mass-produced until 1780, when they were sold by a William Addis of Clerkenwell, London, England. In accordance with the Library of Congress website, scholar John Bowman also writes that the bristle toothbrush using pig bristles was invented in China during the 1490s. While Bonnie L. Kendall agrees with this, she noted that a predecessor existed in ancient Egypt {{in the form of a}} twig that was <b>frayed</b> at the end.|$|E
5|$|In 1382, the Mamluk emir Barquq usurped {{the throne}} in Cairo, {{establishing}} the Burji regime. The latter were ethnic Circassians unlike their Turkmen Bahri predecessors, {{which resulted in}} <b>frayed</b> relations between the Turkmens of Keserwan and the new rulers. The tensions between the Turkmens of Keserwan and the Burji authorities contrasted with the Turkmens' principal rivals in Mount Lebanon, the Druze Buhturids, who embraced Sultan Barquq. When the latter was briefly toppled in a Bahri revolt in 1389, the Buhturids fought against the Bahri rebels in Damascus, while the Turkmen tribesmen assaulted the Druze Tanukhi tribesmen in Beirut and the surrounding hills. In those engagements and the executions that followed, the Turkmens killed seven of the eight Tanukhi Abi al-Jaysh Arslan emirs, Druze allies of the Buhturids.|$|E
5|$|Li Shizhen (1518–93) – one of {{the most}} renowned pharmacologists and {{physicians}} in Chinese history – belonged to the late Ming period. His Bencao Gangmu is a medical text with 1,892 entries, each entry with its own name called a gang. The mu in the title refers to the synonyms of each name. Inoculation, although it can be traced to earlier Chinese folk medicine, was detailed in Chinese texts by the sixteenth century. Throughout the Ming dynasty, around fifty texts were published on the treatment of smallpox. In regards to oral hygiene, the ancient Egyptians had a primitive toothbrush of a twig <b>frayed</b> at the end, but the Chinese were the first to invent the modern bristle toothbrush in 1498, although it used stiff pig hair.|$|E

5|$|Throughout his rule, Aqil {{remained}} at least nominally {{in service to}} the Ottoman Empire, which paid him for protecting the roads of northern Palestine from Bedouin raids and for maintaining the security of this region. He also exacted his own tolls on the local population in return for ensuring their security. His friendly ties with the European governments were partially due to his protection of the local Christian and Jewish communities in Galilee, including his protection of Nazareth from the 1860 massacres that occurred in Ottoman Syria. Aqil's relationship with the authorities was generally tense and he rebelled directly or indirectly against their local representatives. As a consequence of this <b>frayed</b> relationship, Aqil's employment would frequently be terminated when his activities or influence perturbed the authorities and then reinstated when his services were needed. By {{the time of his}} death, his influence had declined significantly. He was buried in his Galilee stronghold of I'billin.|$|E
5|$|In a {{biological}} symbiosis one organism typically shores up some weakness or deficiency of the other(s). As {{in such a}} symbiosis, Odin the father of all humans and gods, though in human form was imperfect by himself. As a separate entity he lacked depth perception (being one-eyed) and he was apparently also uninformed and forgetful. But his weaknesses were compensated by his ravens, Hugin (mind) and Munin (memory) {{who were part of}} him. They perched on his shoulders and reconnoitered {{to the ends of the}} earth each day to return in the evening and tell him the news. He also had two wolves at his side, and the man/god-raven-wolf association was like one single organism in which the ravens were the eyes, mind, and memory, and the wolves the providers of meat and nourishment. As god, Odin was the ethereal part—he only drank wine and spoke only in poetry. I wondered if the Odin myth was a metaphor that playfully and poetically encapsulates ancient knowledge of our prehistoric past as hunters in association with two allies to produce a powerful hunting alliance. It would reflect a past that we have long forgotten and whose meaning has been obscured and badly <b>frayed</b> as we abandoned our hunting cultures to become herders and agriculturists, to whom ravens act as competitors.|$|E

25|$|In January 2012 the Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority {{issued an}} {{airworthiness}} directive grounding all Bonanzas, Twin Bonanzas and Debonairs {{equipped with a}} single pole-style yoke, having forward elevator control cables more than 15 years old, until they could be inspected. The AD was issued based on two aircraft found to have <b>frayed</b> cables, one of which suffered a cable failure just prior to takeoff and resulting concerns {{about the age of}} the cables in fleet aircraft of this age. At the time of the grounding some Bonanzas had reached 64 years in service. Aircraft with <b>frayed</b> cables were grounded until the cables were replaced and those that passed inspection were required to have their cables replaced within 60 days regardless. The AD affected only Australian aircraft and was not adopted by the airworthiness authority responsible for the type certificate, the US Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA instead opted to issue a Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB) requesting that the elevator control cables be inspected during the annual inspection.|$|E
