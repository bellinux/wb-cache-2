40|$|Located in {{the middle}} segment of the Trans-North China Orogen, the Fuping Complex is {{considered}} as a critical area in understanding the evolution history of the North China Craton (NCC). The complex is composed of various high-grade and multiply deformed rocks, including gray gneiss, basic granulite, amphibolite, <b>fine-grained</b> <b>gneiss</b> and marble, metamorphosed to upper amphibolite or granulite facies. It {{can be divided into}} four rock units: the Fuping TTG gneisses, Longquanguan augen gneisses, Wanzi supracrustals, and Nanying granitic gneisses. U-Pb age and Hf isotope compositions of about 200 detrital zircons from the Wanzi supracrustals of the Fuping Complex have been analyzed. The data on metamorphic zircon rims give ages of 1. 82 − 1. 84 Ga, corresponding to the final amalgamation event of the NCC, whereas the data for igneous zircon cores yield two age populations at ~ 2. 10 and ~ 2. 51 Ga, with some inherited ages scattering between 2. 5 and 2. 9 Ga. These results suggest that the Wanzi supracrustals were derived from the Fuping TTG gneisses (~ 2. 5 Ga) and the Nanying granitic gneisses (2. 0 − 2. 1 Ga) and deposited between 2. 10 and 1. 84 Ga. All zircons with ~ 2. 51 Ga age have positive initial εHf values from + 1. 4 to + 10. 9, suggesting an important crustal growth event at ~ 2. 5 Ga through the addition of juvenile materials from the mantle. The Hf isotope data for the detrital zircons further imply that the 2. 8 Ga rocks are important components in the lower crust, which is consistent with a suggestion from Nd isotope data for the Eastern Block. The zircons of 2. 10 Ga population have initial εHf values of − 4. 9 to + 6. 1, interpreted as mixing of crustal re-melt with minor juvenile material contribution at 2. 1 Ga. These results are distinct from that for the Western Block, supporting that the Fuping Complex was emplaced in a tectonic active environment at the western margin of the Eastern Block...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{structural}} architecture and metamorphic evolution of a mélange, developed originally in an ocean-continent transition (OCT) zone along {{the boundary between the}} continental crust of the Sesia-Lanzo (SLZ) and the oceanic Piemonte Zones (PZ) in the axial part of the Western Alps. All these units were deformed together under high-pressure conditions. The mélange consists of thin layers of calcschist, <b>fine-grained</b> <b>gneiss,</b> quartzite, minor metabasic rocks and serpentinite, and occurs all along the western margin of southern SLZ, extending from Santanel klippe to Lanzo Massif, over a distance of 50 km (Spalla et al., 1983; Battiston et al., 1984). Calcschist rocks range from phyllites to carbonatic schists and marbles; fine-grained gneisses of continental origin (very similar to those of SLZ) include phengitic white mica, chlorite, ± garnet ± albite and relict allanite. Thinly layered quartzites are white mica- and garnet-bearing. Metabasic rocks consist of metagabbros and metabasalts with minor mylonitic serpentinites. All these lithologies of the mélange unit and the rocks of SLZ and PZ together underwent four episodes of deformation, giving rise to a complex regional tectonostratigraphy. The earliest deformational structures are represented by up to ten meter-scale isoclinal rootless folds. The metamorphic mineral assemblages marking successive foliations indicate that all rock units in the mélange, SLZ and PZ (Spalla et al., 1983; Benciolini et al., 1984) experienced an early eclogite facies imprint, followed by re-equilibration under blueschist facies conditions, and that they were finally widely retrogressed under greenschist facies conditions during the last two deformational episodes (D 3 and D 4 structures). The strong synmetamorphic deformation of this mélange prevents an unequivocal interpretation of its origin; hence, we envisage two possible scenarios: i) the present day configuration of these thin, intermingled layers, including rootless refolded isoclinal folds, is entirely due to transposition that occurred in a mantle wedge at the early stages of deformation under eclogite facies conditions during active subduction; ii) a detrital origin of these alternating layers of terrigeneous and carbonaceous rocks corresponds to a primary sequence of an extensionally-thinned continental margin near an OCT that was reworked in the Alpine subduction system...|$|E

The objectives {{of this study are}} to update the geological map of the Kuala Balah, Jeli, Kelantan with scale of 1 : 25 000, to produce slope failure inventory of the study area with slope geometry, mode/ type of failure, failure geometry, origin of soil/ rock, cause of failure, type of slope stabilization protection and vegetation cover of failure and to construct slope stability analysis for soil cut-slope at study area by using Slope/ W software. Geological mapping and engineering mapping were carried out to identify the geological features and the soil-cut-slope. Geological map of Kuala Balah, Jeli, Kelantan has been updated. The lithology consists of fine-grained granite, granodiorite, fine-grained biotite granite, quartzite, <b>fine-grained</b> <b>gneiss,</b> coarse-grained quartz-plagioclase gneiss, shale, mudstone and metasandstone. There are a total eight cut-slope failure observed in the study area. The inventory of slope failure is constructed. Most of the weathering grade of soil cut-slope is five and originated from shale. The mode of failure of all slope is rotational slide and protected by vegetation or Gabion retaining wall. Major causes of the failure are weathering process and rainfall. Laboratory analysis for properties of soil had been done for the slope stability analysis. Based on the laboratory tests of soil, the classification of soil is done and the results are used in the determination of factor of safety of slope. The soil samples are categorized into three groups which area sandy silty clay, sandy lean clay and sandy high plasticity clay. The factor of safety of the selected slopes are range in 0. 339 to 2. 548 which indicated there has stable slope and unstable slopes...|$|E

60|$|Following, {{in company}} with Dr. A. Smith, {{the line of}} {{junction}} between the granite and the slate, as it stretched inland, in a S.E. direction, {{we came to a}} place, where the slate was converted into a <b>fine-grained,</b> perfectly characterised <b>gneiss,</b> composed of yellow-brown granular feldspar, of abundant black brilliant mica, and of few and thin laminae of quartz. From the abundance of the mica in this gneiss, compared with the small quantity and excessively minute scales, in which it exists in the glossy clay-slate, we must conclude, that it has been here formed by the metamorphic action--a circumstance doubted, under nearly similar circumstances, by some authors. The laminae of the clay-slate are straight; and it was interesting to observe, that as they assumed the character of gneiss, they became undulatory with some of the smaller flexures angular, like the laminae of many true metamorphic schists.|$|R
40|$|The Fuping Complex, {{located within}} the central zone of the North China Craton, is {{composed}} of amphibolite to granulite facies orthogneisses, interleaved with minor supracrustal rocks at similar metamorphic grade. The oldest components recognised are hornblende gneiss enclaves within the predominant biotite orthogneiss which have a SHRIMP U-Pb zircon age of 2708 ± 8 Ma. We consider these enclaves to represent fragments of ∼ 2. 7 Ga continental materials incorporated in the biotite gneiss. The biotite gneiss has a SHRIMP U-Pb zircon age of 2513 ± 12 Ma, interpreted to be time of magmatic crystallisation of the igneous precursor, based on the igneous characteristics of the zircons. This indicates a major magmatic episode at 2. 52 Ga in the Fuping Complex, identical {{to the age of}} felsic volcanism within the low-grade Wutai Complex which crops out immediately to the west. A gneissic granite that intrudes the biotite gneisses has a poorly-defined 207 Pb/ 206 Pb age of 2045 ± 64 Ma. This is within error of the age of 2097 ± 46 Ma obtained from a <b>fine-grained</b> <b>gneiss</b> interlayered with amphibolite of the Wanzi Supracrustal Suite (WSS), interpreted to be volcanic in origin. Zircons from both these samples have strong oscillatory zoning and provide the first indication of a Palaeoproterozoic magmatic event in the area, again similar in age to magmatic events recently recognised in the adjacent Wutai Complex. These data indicate a comparable history for the Fuping and Wutai Complexes and support geochemical evidence that they had a common origin and formed part of a Late Archaean arc, affected by later Palaeoproterozoic re-activation. Low-uranium zircons without oscillatory zoning, separated from a sample of biotite gneiss, yield data clustered at 1817 ± 26 Ma, which is interpreted to reflect a period of new zircon growth during a major metamorphic event. These data support the recently-proposed tectonic model that amalgamation of the North China Craton occurred due to collision of the Eastern and Western Blocks along the central zone at ∼ 1. 8 Ga ago. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|International audienceUnravelling the {{detailed}} pressure–temperature–time-deformation (P–T–t-D) evolution of magmatic and metamorphic rocks provides essential {{insights into the}} timing and duration of partial melting and related plutonism during crustal flow and migmatitic dome formation. The Montagne Noire Axial Zone (MNAZ) is a migmatitic dome located within the Variscan orogen in the southern French Massif Central. The timing of the main thermal event that was responsible for intense partial melting is still highly debated. In this study we present new laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) age data on micaschists, migmatites and granites that clarify the P–T–t-D evolution of the MNAZ. Structurally controlled samples were collected in order to constrain the timing of metamorphism, migmatization and plutonism regarding the main structural pattern D 1, D 2 and D 3. D 1 and D 2 correspond to nappe stacking and dextral transpression, respectively. D 3 is related to vertical shortening and coaxial thinning with a preferential NE–SW- to E–W-directed stretching. LA-ICP-MS analyses on the syntectonic Anglès, Soulié and Martys granites yielded U–Th/Pb monazite ages of 305 ± 1. 5, 306 ± 1. 9 and 314 ± 2 Ma, respectively. Five migmatitic rocks sampled in the eastern and central Espinouse area yielded in situ ages ranging between 312 ± 2 and 301 ± 2 Ma. Along the dome envelope, two garnet–staurolite-bearing micaschists near Saint-Pons-de-Thomières village gave in situ U–Th–Pb ages of 312. 1 ± 2. 1 and 309. 0 ± 3. 1 Ma. A <b>fine-grained</b> <b>gneiss</b> with a D 3 fabrics in the eastern dome envelope yield a 208 Pb/ 232 Th mean age at 305. 7 ± 3. 9 Ma. All ages obtained in this study for the micaschists, migmatites and granites range between 315 and 301 Ma. We interpret this time span as {{the record of the}} high thermal event responsible for intense crustal partial melting within the lower and middle crust. The onset of partial melting occurred at ca. 315 Ma that marked the beginning of transpressional deformation D 2. Based on structural and petrological studies, our new U–Th–Pb results suggest that (1) partial melting may have started at ca. 315 Ma and lasted 15 – 10 Myr and (2) D 2 et D 3 developed between 315 and 300 Ma and were synchronous. D 1 deformation ended at 315 Ma. The onset and duration of D 1 related to nappe stacking and crustal thickening is still uncertain...|$|E
40|$|The Khanka Massif {{forms the}} easternmost {{segment of the}} Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) in NE China and its tectonic setting is highly controversial. Metasedimentary rocks from the Hulin Complex and the Mt. Huoshi {{sequence}} were selected to address this issue. For the Hulin Complex, SHRIMP detrital zircon U-Pb dating of a two-mica schist (sample HL- 011) reveals a unimodal population with a weighted mean 206 Pb/ 238 U age of 257 ± 3 Ma, suggesting local derivation from nearby Permian granitoids. In contrast, a quartz schist (sample 04 H- 138) contains five zircon populations with ages of 233 - 270 Ma, 350 - 400 Ma, 473 - 570 Ma, 720 - 760 Ma and 930 - 970 Ma, and peaks at 252, 350, 520, 758 and 970 Ma, indicating a much more diverse provenance. Two samples of <b>fine-grained</b> <b>gneiss</b> were selected from Mt Houshi, with sample 06 H- 15 containing four zircon populations, with groupings at 260 - 340 Ma, 470 - 560 Ma, 710 - 940 Ma and a single grain at 2090 Ma, whereas zircons in sample 06 H- 16 define two populations with ages of 727 - 854 Ma, with a peak at 776 Ma, and a single grain with an age of 404 ± 13 Ma. The youngest detrital zircon was obtained from sample 04 H- 138 and has a 206 Pb/ 238 U age of 233 ± 9 Ma, limiting deposition of the Hulin Complex to after ∼ 233 Ma. The late Pan-African and Paleoproterozoic to Neoproterozoic ages, together with the ∼ 500 Ma age for granulite facies metamorphism previously determined for the Hutou Complex in the Khanka Massif, indicate that the Khanka and Jiamusi massifs (together with the Bureya Massif in Russia) formed a contiguous crustal unit. Detrital zircon data suggest that this combined block {{was not part of}} either the North China or the South China cratons. Instead, it was either derived from a peri-Gondwana position, a rifted portion of the Songliao Massif in the CAOB, an exotic block of unknown affinity, or from the Siberia Craton. We evaluate the possibility that the Khanka/Jiamusi/Bureya block may have originated in Siberia and once formed part of the Sayan-Baikal orogen at ∼ 500 Ma. Whatever its origin, the block drifted westward to collide with the Songliao Massif of NE China in the latest Triassic-Early Jurassic {{as a result of the}} onset of Pacific-plate subduction. It thus forms part of the evolving supercontinent of Eurasia. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} of this thesis {{is to make a}} tectonostratigraphic map of the North to North-east part of Hardangerjøkulen (Klippe), close to Finse. The area is defined by three main units: the Basement, Phyllite and the Middle Allochthon. The {{basement}} is characterized by granitic and gabbroic lithology, both with an age of 980 Ma. Pegmatitic dikes that intrudes the basement (both granite and gabbro) represents an event occurring at 940 Ma. Phyllite, the lithology above has weakly responded during thrusting/folding of the overlaying informal unit, Lower nappe, as Phyllite is often in-folded in Lower nappe fold structures. Lower nappe is comprised of several different rock types with more or less different lithologies, such as <b>fine-grained</b> banded <b>gneiss,</b> schist, carbonate, volcanic tuff and also lithologies very similar to Phyllite. The Lower nappe is highly folded with mylonitic fabric. The highest unit is the “Upper nappe”, another informal name, and this is the crystalline basement part of upper Middle Allochthon. The Upper nappe is also highly folded with mylonitic fabric, but with coarser grain sizes relative to the Lower nappe, it is characterized as banded gneiss. The dominated fold-axes orientations are trending NW-SE with vergence towards NE, while the second most dominant direction is trending NE-SW with vergence towards NW. These two fold-axes orientations are located at geographically different places, but still appearing in the same lithologies. Between the lithologies which has folds with fold-axes trending either NW-SE or NE-SW, a transitional zone is recognized as the fold axes are rotating/changing over a small area (approx. 100 meter). Apparently the study area represents four deformation sequences: Sveconorwegian orogeny (~ 1000 Ma), Dalane Phase (940 Ma), Caledonian orogeny (420 Ma), Devonian extensional phase (~ 410 Ma). The orientations of the fold axes (NW-SE or NE-SW) determine which phase the lithology was deformed by...|$|R

Minor amphibole present in some samples is ferrimagnesiohornblende with 0. 17 - 0. 22 Mn pfu. Accessory ilmenite contains 24 - 34 mol. % pyrophanite and 1. 7 - 5. 8 hematite. Some closely associated impure calcite marbles (or amphibolites) carry Ti-bearing andradite, epidote, diopside-hedenbergite, and accessory magnetite. Data from the Varied Group indicate that manganese enrichment took place both under oxidizing and reducing conditions, but the Mn-garnet-quartz rocks are oxidic. Normalization of major-element contents in the Mn-rich rocks by average abundances in Varied Group paragneisses shows ten- to hundred-fold enrichment in MnO and a slight to moderate increase in CaO and P 2 O 5 . Values for Na 2 O and K 2 O indicate severe depletion in some samples, but contents of other oxides are close to unity. Comparison of chondrite-normalized REE patterns in Mn-rich rocks with data for ordinary paragneisses (Varied Group) also indicates that detrital component in Mn-rich rocks was closely comparable to material supplied for protolith of paragneisses. This permits to ascribe the spike of Mn to likely short-lived exhalative processes. Manganese-rich garnet-quartz rocks and gneisses remained unnoticed till now mainly owing to a small thickness of their layers, typically less than 1 m. Structural relations in regions carrying Mn-rich rocks indicate their occurrence in relict domains of preserved D 1 structures with NW-SE trending foliation. It is suggested that in regionally prevalent areas dominated by superimposed refoliation (D 2 , D 3 ) the thin layers of Mn-rich rocks were likely reduced to boudins dispersed in paragneiss matrix. Comparison with published data for similar Mn-rich rocks abroad (including the so-called coticules) strongly indicates a lithostratigraphic correlation potential of Mn-rich garnet-quartz rocks...|$|R
