His biggest influences were Charlie Chaplin, [...] "because he expressed through movement the aspirations of the little man", and the dancer and choreographer Léonide Massine, [...] "because he expressed more than just balletic ability—he was always a character on stage, an exaggerated character, which I do all the time: an exaggeration of ordinary movement".|$|E
500|$|The {{directors}} cast Nielsen for {{his ability}} to play like [...] "a fish in water", saying [...] "You could have cast funny people and done it with everybody winking, goofing off, and silly... we wanted people to be oblivious to the comedy." [...] For Nielsen, Airplane! marked a shift from dramatic roles to deadpan comedy. When it was suggested his role in Airplane! was against type, Nielsen protested that he had [...] "always been cast against type before", and that comedy was what <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> to do. The same directors cast Nielsen in a similar style, in their TV series Police Squad!. The series introduced Nielsen as Frank Drebin, the stereotypical police officer modelled after serious characters in earlier police series.|$|E

500|$|Common became {{interested}} in the role due to both the script and the prospect of working with McAvoy, Jolie, and Morgan Freeman. Common learned a great deal about firearms as preparation for the role, but said he is not a strong supporter of guns in real life. Konstantin Khabensky, who starred in Bekmambetov's Night Watch, was cast so that the director would have a familiar face around. British television veteran Marc Warren agreed to work in the film because <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> to be in a Hollywood blockbuster. Thomas Kretschmann originally intended to pick up the comic series after being cast, but Bekmambetov convinced him not to. He said that he [...] "did excessive gun training" [...] to [...] "make sure I look good and I look like I know what I'm doing". Kristen Hager originally auditioned for Fox, but accepted the role of Cathy, considering it [...] "fun to play".|$|E

[...] She noted that in most interviews, he came across as [...] "a very shy and private person". Divine's Dutch friends gave him two bulldogs in the early 1980s, on which he doted, naming them Beatrix and Claus after Queen Beatrix and her husband Prince Claus of the Netherlands. On {{numerous}} occasions he would have his photograph taken with them and sometimes use these images for record covers and posters. Divine suffered from problems with obesity from childhood, caused by his love of food, and in later life his hunger was increased by his daily use of marijuana, an addiction that he publicly admitted to. According to Bernard Jay, in Divine's final years, when his disco career {{was coming to an end}} and he was struggling to find acting jobs, he felt suicidal and threatened to kill himself on several occasions.|$|E
500|$|On , Bloody Disgusting {{reported}} that Kevin Greutert, {{the editor of}} the first five films in the franchise, would make his directorial debut with Saw VI. Newcomer to the series, Andrew Coutts replaced him as editor for the film. Saw VI marked David Armstrong's last time to serve as cinematographer of the series. Mark Burg and Oren Koules again served as producers, with James Wan and Leigh Whannell, creators of the series, executive producing. Charlie Clouser was brought back to compose the score. Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan, writers of Saw IV and Saw V, returned to write the sixth installment. Melton said that the film had good pacing and a resolution for the series. Greutert commented that Saw VI would have some finality to it, something <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> to see in the series. During the early planning stage for the script it was suggested that Mandylor's character, Detective Hoffman, should take on the mafia, but the idea was quickly dismissed as not [...] "feeling Saw enough". [...] Greutert said in a Demon FM interview that Lionsgate told him a week before filming, that Saw VI would be post-converted into 3D. Greutert was upset by this, since the film he envisioned was a 2D film, aesthetically. The plans were later abandoned due to time restraints.|$|E

500|$|The second {{track is}} [...] "Holiday", which Benitez said that <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> to remix, commenting [...] "There are new sounds on the 1987 remix , {{but it had}} a groove that needed no improvement." [...] The sound of the guitar is brought to the front in the remix, with a piano break and a middle section {{consisting}} of drum beats. The mix for [...] "Everybody" [...] starts with four repetitions of the vocal hook and then moves into a rhythm centered arrangement. Like [...] "Holiday", the middle section of [...] "Everybody" [...] features a drum break, with a synth tune backing it up. The word [...] "dance" [...] is echoed and slowed-down continuously through the break, gradually changing into the intermedia verse. At the very end, the drums are pulled out, leaving Madonna repeating the [...] "get up and do your thing" [...] phrase, which hovers over to the intro of the next song [...] "Physical Attraction". It begins with the arrangement of the original song, until the middle eight, where the composition is varied. A disconcerting sound is present {{at the end of the}} track, which, after sometime increases in volume until then next track [...] "Over and Over" [...] begins. In the [...] "Into the Groove" [...] remix, overdubs are present with the continuous repetition of the phrase [...] "c'mon". The first verse does not start until about ninety seconds into the remix. After the first [...] "Now I know you're mine" [...] line is sung, there is a percussion break, and repetition of the phrases [...] "step to the beat" [...] and [...] "c'mon". The last verse incorporates echoing on the vocals, causing overlap of the phrases. The remix ends with instrumentation from congas, whistles and timbales, giving it a Mexican ending.|$|E
500|$|Parsons and Sara {{were in an}} open {{relationship}} {{encouraged by}} the O.T.O.'s polyandrous sexual ethics, and she became enamored with Hubbard; Parsons, despite attempting to repress his passions, became intensely jealous. Motivated {{to find a new}} partner through occult means, Parsons began to devote his energies to conducting black magic, causing concern among fellow O.T.O. members who believed that it was invoking troublesome spirits into the Parsonage; Jane Wolfe wrote to Crowley that [...] "our own Jack is enamored with Witchcraft, the houmfort, voodoo. From the start <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>wanted</b> to evoke something—no matter what, I am inclined to think, as long as he got a result." [...] He told the residents that he was imbuing statues in the house with a magical energy in order to sell them to fellow occultists. Parsons reported paranormal events in the house resulting from the rituals; including poltergeist activity, sightings of orbs and ghostly apparitions, alchemical (sylphic) effect on the weather, and disembodied voices. Pendle suggested that Parsons was particularly susceptible to these interpretations and attributed the voices to a prank by Hubbard and Sara. One ritual allegedly brought screaming banshees to the windows of the Parsonage, an incident that disturbed Forman {{for the rest of his}} life. In December 1945 Parsons began a series of rituals based on Enochian magic during which he masturbated onto magical tablets, accompanied by Sergei Prokofiev's Second Violin Concerto. Describing this magical operation as the Babalon Working, he hoped to bring about the incarnation of Thelemite goddess Babalon onto Earth. He allowed Hubbard to take part as his [...] "scribe", believing that he was particularly sensitive to detecting magical phenomena. As described by Richard Metzger, [...] "Parsons jerked off in the name of spiritual advancement" [...] while Hubbard [...] "scanned the astral plane for signs and visions." ...|$|E
