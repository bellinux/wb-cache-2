As Perry said of the Daddies' ideology, [...] "It was our way of saying 'screw you' [...] "..."we wanted to have fun, outrageously have a good blast without <b>even</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> it". By the end of 1989, the Daddies had built a strong following within Eugene's counterculture, frequently selling out shows and gathering critical acclaim, earning praise from Eugene Weekly as being the city's best band [...] "by far".|$|E
500|$|GameTrailers was {{particularly}} critical, {{saying that it}} had been [...] "released before it was finished", calling it [...] " [...] broken, incomplete mess". PC Gamer called the game [...] "a shallow, slow, grind-heavy MMO crippled by a horrible interface and nonsensical player limitations". GameSpy was again highly critical, saying that [...] "barring a complete overhaul of the user interface, the combat, the player interaction mechanics, the progress system, and of the layout of the world itself, [...] is unlikely to ever be fun." [...] Eurogamer said that while the game would appeal to some players, they advised them to [...] "wait another six months before <b>even</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> Final Fantasy XIV, because Square Enix hasn't yet got its head around its own players".|$|E

500|$|... "Animal" [...] {{was written}} by Miike Snow's three members, Christian Karlsson, Pontus Winnberg and Andrew Wyatt, in {{collaboration}} with Henrik Jonback. In an interview with Dustin Fitzharris of Out, Wyatt explained that the song has an ambiguous meaning, [...] "It can deal with addiction. It can deal with just the basic instincts – {{some of them are}} wonderful {{and some of them are}} very dangerous." [...] In a separate interview with Joe Zadeh for Clash, Wyatt deemed it a [...] "very simple song" [...] and elaborated on its subject matter, [...] "Directing your attention to man's underlying nature and how sometimes things in society just don't work out to meet your needs. And a lot of people end up feeling very dissatisfied. And the way people feel the need to fit into certain circumstances without <b>even</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> what they want." [...] "Animal" [...] was recorded at Robotberget, the band's own studio in Stockholm, Sweden. The band produced the track and then mixed it with Anders Hvenare.|$|E
500|$|After the film's release, {{rumors of}} {{possible}} sequels began circulating in different interviews and in film fansites. In 2000, Bruce Willis {{was quoted as}} hoping for an Unbreakable trilogy. In December 2000, Shyamalan denied rumors he wrote Unbreakable as the first installment of a trilogy, saying he was not <b>even</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> it. In August 2001, Shyamalan stated that, because of successful DVD sales, he had approached Touchstone Pictures about an Unbreakable sequel, an idea Shyamalan said the studio originally turned down because of the film's poor box office performance. In a September 2008 article, Shyamalan and Samuel L. Jackson said there was some discussion of a sequel when the film was being made, but that it mostly died with the poor box office. Jackson said he was still interested in a sequel but Shyamalan was non-committal. In February 2010, Willis said that Shyamalan was [...] "still thinking about doing the fight movie between me and Sam {{that we were going}} to do", and stated that as long as Jackson was able to participate he would be [...] "up for it".|$|E

Jones said [...] "There were a few moments at the time I was up for it (Hall of Fame reunion in 2003), Joe was up for it. Paul wasn't. And neither, probably, was Topper, who didn't wind up even coming in the end. It didn't look like a performance {{was going to happen}} anyway. I mean, you usually play at that ceremony when you get in. Joe had passed by that point, so we didn't. We were never in agreement. It was never at a point where all of us wanted to do it at the same time. Most importantly for us, we became friends again after the group broke up, and continued that way {{for the rest of the}} time. That was more important to us than the band". Jones also stated that the Sound System box set was the last time he will ever be involved in the band's releases. [...] "I'm not <b>even</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> any more Clash releases. This is it for me, and I say that with an exclamation mark." [...] Jones said.|$|E

500|$|The {{visit of}} West Ham United to Highbury {{produced}} a 1–0 defeat for Arsenal; the winning goal scored by Mike Small {{came in the}} 76th minute. Arsenal's conserved performance was attributed to their upcoming European Cup match, something Graham categorically denied: [...] "I'm not <b>even</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> next Wednesday." [...] Arsenal drew away to Oldham Athletic and then Sheffield Wednesday, extending a winless run of five games in all competitions. The team beat Tottenham on 1 December 1991 to go fourth in the league table, 10 points behind the leaders. Arsenal's aspiration to defend the league title suffered to Nottingham Forest; though the team scored twice {{in the second half}} they were unable to overturn the home side's three-goal lead and collected no points. David Hillier opined that his team [...] "should have done better in the first half – that's when we really lost it." [...] Wright scored all of Arsenal's four goals against Everton, but scored none in the team's Boxing Day defeat by Luton Town. Graham called it Arsenal's worst performance of the season and was critical of his players' attitude. Although the team's concentration and effort improved according to Peter Ball of The Times in their next game – away to Manchester City, Arsenal lost for the second consecutive league match. They ended the calendar year in seventh position, 16 points behind the leaders Manchester United.|$|E
500|$|With the Blades now in League One {{there was}} {{speculation}} that Evans would {{be sold to}} ease the club's wage bill but an injury {{picked up in the}} last days of the previous campaign meant he was unavailable until early September, preventing him from moving on to another club. Having returned from injury Evans hit a rich vein of form scoring regularly in both league and cup competitions as the Blades contested for promotion. On 28 March 2012 he scored a second-half hat trick within 15 minutes against Chesterfield giving him his thirtieth goal of the season in a 4–1 win for Sheffield United at Bramall Lane. During this impressive third season, Evans drew attention from Championship and Premier League clubs with his contract scheduled to expire in the summer. However, Blades manager Danny Wilson stated that Evans [...] " [...] <b>even</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> leaving Bramall Lane", adding [...] "Of course we don't want to lose Ched." [...] Evans was named League One Player of the Month for March 2012, having scored 10 goals in 8 games. He was nominated for 'League One Player of the Season', and in April 2012 Evans was named in the League One PFA Team of the Year. [...] He ended the season with 35 goals in all competitions, but following his rape conviction Evans was released by United at the end of the season.|$|E
500|$|In higher organisms (like people), {{these two}} modes of {{perception}} combine into what Whitehead terms [...] "symbolic reference", which links appearance with causation {{in a process}} that is so automatic that both people and animals have difficulty refraining from it. [...] By way of illustration, Whitehead uses the example of a person's encounter with a chair. [...] An ordinary person looks up, sees a colored shape, and immediately infers that it is a chair. [...] However, an artist, Whitehead supposes, [...] "might not have jumped to the notion of a chair", but instead [...] "might have stopped at the mere contemplation of a beautiful color and a beautiful shape." [...] This is not the normal human reaction; most people place objects in categories by habit and instinct, without <b>even</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> it. [...] Moreover, animals do the same thing. [...] Using the same example, Whitehead points out that a dog [...] "would have acted immediately on the hypothesis of a chair and would have jumped onto it by way of using it as such." [...] In this way symbolic reference is a fusion of pure sense perceptions {{on the one hand and}} causal relations on the other, and that it is in fact the causal relationships that dominate the more basic mentality (as the dog illustrates), while it is the sense perceptions which indicate a higher grade mentality (as the artist illustrates).|$|E

Pompeo was pregnant during the episode, so the filming crew had to work around it. In the episode, Lexie advocated for Meredith to donate her liver, because she was unable to. Bans commented on this: [...] "It was REALLY {{easy for me to}} understand Lexie in this episode – 'cause that's how I imagine she grew up with [...] and Thatcher.

Rumours circulated that the split was a result of Monk's desire to begin a solo career, though she denied this. In 2004, during an interview with FHM magazine, Polihronas revealed, [...] "I think when Sophie went solo, everyone assumed that it was she who broke up the band, which wasn't right. I don't know whether I should say this, but I wanted out for a long time.

I took a whole year off without <b>even</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> it."
