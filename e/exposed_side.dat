500|$|Both {{halves of}} the technique, that of uke and that of tori, are {{considered}} essential to aikido training. Both are studying aikido principles of blending and adaptation. Tori learns to blend with and control attacking energy, while uke learns to become calm and flexible in the disadvantageous, off-balance positions in which tori places them. This [...] "receiving" [...] of the technique is called ukemi. Uke continuously seeks to regain balance and cover vulnerabilities (e.g., an <b>exposed</b> <b>side),</b> while tori uses position and timing to keep uke off-balance and vulnerable. In more advanced training, uke will sometimes apply [...] to regain balance and pin or throw tori.|$|E
500|$|The {{church was}} {{constructed}} using rubble masonry with boulder quoins. The floor is laid with flagstones throughout, and the roof has modern slates. The nave measures , the chancel measures 16feet 6inches by 11feet (5.03 by 3.47m), and the chapel adjoining the chancel {{on the south}} side is [...] Between the nave and chancel is a pointed arch, with some 13th-century elements but probably reconstructed in the 16th century. The side chapel has rectangular windows in the east and west walls from the 17th century; a narrow stone bench runs along the west and south walls of the chapel. The roof trusses, which date from the 15th and 17th centuries, are visible inside the building and the undersides are chamfered. [...] There are two rectangular windows in the north wall of the nave (20th century additions), matching the window in the north wall of the chancel. [...] The east window, in the chancel, has three rounded lights set in a square frame; it dates from {{the latter part of the}} 16th century. [...] The windows still have their clear leaded glass but are now boarded up. There are no windows {{on the south side}}, which is the most <b>exposed</b> <b>side.</b> There is an empty bellcote on the roof at the west end of the nave. [...] The entrance is also at the west end, where there is a rounded arch doorway set deep into the thick wall, possibly dating from the 14th century.|$|E
2500|$|Although the 1996 {{model year}} is the {{beginning}} of the second generation, in the Viper community, the 96 RT/10 is sometimes referred to as generation 1.5 since it saw the carryover of many generation 1 parts during the model year while transitioning to generation 2 parts. [...] The roadster relocated the <b>exposed</b> <b>side</b> exhaust pipes to a single muffler at the rear exiting via two large central tail pipes during the middle of the model year. [...] Dodge said the reduced back pressure increased the horsepower to [...] for the 96 RT/10.

2500|$|Designed by Davis Brody Bond, {{the museum}} is about [...] below ground and {{accessible}} through a pavilion designed by Sn√∏hetta. The National September 11 Memorial Museum encloses [...] of publicly accessible space. The pavilion has a deconstructivist design, resembling a partially collapsed building (mirroring the attacks), and houses two tridents from the Twin Towers. One of the museum's walls is an <b>exposed</b> <b>side</b> of the slurry wall retaining the Hudson River, which remained intact during (and after) September 11. Other Ground Zero artifacts include wrecked emergency vehicles (including a fire engine deformed from the collapse), pieces of metal from all seven World Trade Center buildings, recordings of survivors and first responders (including 911 phone calls), pictures of all victims, photographs from the wreckage and other media detailing the destruction (including the crashes, collapse, fires, those who jumped and the cleanup). The museum is designed to evoke memories without additional distress, particularly to first responders and the families of victims.|$|E

60|$|I {{found no}} reason to remain very long on the plateau, and had just {{returned}} to the Brigadier when the Boer guns began to shell {{the tip of the}} hill. The first two or three projectiles skimmed over the surface, and roared harmlessly away. But the Boers were not long in striking their mark. Two percussion shells burst on the <b>exposed</b> <b>side</b> of the hill, and then a well-exploded shrapnel searched its summit, searched and found what it sought. Major Childe was instantly killed by a fragment that entered his brain, and half a dozen troopers were more or less seriously wounded. After that, as if satisfied, the enemy's gun turned its attention elsewhere.|$|E

60|$|Friedrich knows Pilzen, what {{an admirable}} post it really is; except only that Schweidnitz will be between {{the enemy and}} him, and liable to be besieged by them; which will never do! Friedrich, on the moment of that news from Kunzendorf, gets on march, not by the east side (as {{intended}} till the scouts came in), but by the west or <b>exposed</b> <b>side</b> of Schweidnitz:--he stood waiting, ready for either route, and lost not a moment on his scouts coming in. All upon the road by 3 A.M. August 20th; and encamps, still at an early hour, midway between Schweidnitz and Striegau: right wing of him at Zedlitz (if the reader look on his Map), left wing at Jauernik; headquarters, Bunzelwitz, a poor Village, celebrated ever since in War-annals. And begins (that same evening, the earlier or RESTED part of him begins) digging and trenching at a most extraordinary rate, according to plan formed; no enemy taking heed of him, or giving the least molestation. This is the world-famous Camp of Bunzelwitz, upon which it is worth while to dwell for a little.|$|E
60|$|In {{groups of}} atolls, {{exposed to a}} trade-wind, the ship-channels into the lagoons are almost {{invariably}} situated on the leeward or less <b>exposed</b> <b>side</b> of the reef, and the reef itself is sometimes either wanting there, or is submerged. A strictly analogous, but different fact, may be observed at the Maldiva atolls--namely, that where two atolls {{stand in front of}} each other, the breaches in the reef are the most numerous on their near, and therefore less exposed, sides. Thus on the near sides of Ari and the two Nillandoo atolls, which face S. Male, Phaleedoo, and Moloque atolls, there are seventy-three deep-water channels, and only twenty-five on their outer sides; on the near side of the three latter named atolls there are fifty- six openings, and only thirty-seven on their outsides. It is scarcely possible to attribute this difference to any other cause than the somewhat different action of the sea on the two sides, which would ensue from the protection afforded by the two rows of atolls to each other. I may here remark that in most cases, the conditions favourable to the greater accumulation of fragments on the reef and to its more perfect continuity {{on one side of the}} atoll than on the other, have concurred, but this has not been the case with the Maldivas; for we have seen that the islets are placed on the eastern or south-eastern sides, whilst the breaches in the reef occur indifferently on any side, where protected by an opposite atoll. The reef being more continuous on the outer and more exposed sides of those atolls which stand near each other, accords with the fact, that the reef of the southern atolls is more continuous than that of the northern ones; for the former, as I am informed by Captain Moresby, are more constantly exposed than the northern atolls to a heavy surf.|$|E

50|$|Ablative {{coatings}} {{contain a}} significant amount of hydrates. As the hydrates are spent, water vapour is released, which has a cooling effect.
