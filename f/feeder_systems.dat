40|$|Gilbert-type deltas are {{commonly}} characterised by steep foreset bedding. Changes in the foreset {{characteristics such as}} grain size, grading, alternating sand and gravel are often interpreted as records of changes of base level or sediment input due to diurnal, seasonal or climatic forcing. To aid such interpretations, an important question is to what extent cyclicity in the foreset characteristics {{can be explained by}} autogenic processes rather than exogenic forcing. Experimental deltas were generated with gravelly sand under constant boundary conditions and a varying width–depth ratio of the <b>feeder</b> <b>system.</b> The foresets of the narrow <b>feeder</b> <b>system</b> are regular and show gradual upward fining. The foresets of the wide <b>feeder</b> <b>system,</b> in contrast, show quasi-cyclic patterns of coarsening and fining during the delta progradation. The cyclicity is caused by the emergence of a channelised point <b>feeder</b> <b>system</b> with migrating gravel side bars, which distributes the sand and gravel laterally in a non-uniform manner. This spectacular change of foreset architecture is fully explained by the autogenic response of the <b>feeder</b> <b>system</b> to the width. These experiments are contrasted with experiments and data from literature in the framework of the delta classification of Postma [Postma, G., 1990. Depositional architecture and facies of river and fan deltas: a synthesis. In: Colella, A. and Prior, D. B. (eds), 1990. Coarse-grained Deltas. Spec. Publ. 10 of the Int.

Feeders move individual components to a fixed location and also assist the pickup head in removing components from their packaging.As the flexibility and placement rate of systems has increased, so have the demands made on the component <b>feeder</b> <b>systems.</b> A high product mix and correspondingly small batch sizes result in frequent feeder changing.

50|$|People mover or {{automated}} {{people mover}} (APM) {{is a type}} of driverless grade-separated, mass-transit system. The term is generally used only to describe systems that serve as loops or <b>feeder</b> <b>systems,</b> but is sometimes applied to considerably more complex automated systems. Similar to monorails, Bombardier Innovia APM technology uses only one rail to guide the vehicle along the guideway. APMs are common at airports and effective at helping passengers quickly reach their gates.

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} the 1809 eruption of Mt. Etna, Italy, which represents one historical and rare case {{in which it is}} possible to closely observe the internal structure of the <b>feeder</b> <b>system.</b> This is possible thanks to the presence of two large pit craters located {{in the middle of the}} eruptive fracture field that allow studying a section of the shallow <b>feeder</b> <b>system.</b> Along the walls of one of these craters, we analysed well-exposed cross sections of the uppermost 15 – 20 m of the <b>feeder</b> <b>system</b> and related volcanic products. Here, {{we describe}} the structure, morphology and lithology of this portion of the 1809 <b>feeder</b> <b>system,</b> including the host rock which conditioned the propagation of the dyke, and compare the results with other recent eruptions. Finally, we propose a dynamic model of the magma behaviour inside a laterally–propagating feeder dyke, demonstrating how this dynamic triggered important changes in the eruptive style (from effusive/Strombolian to phreatomagmatic) during the same eruption. This is therefore an exceptional case to understand how basaltic magmas move during the propagation of an eruptive fissure. Our results are also useful for hazard assessment related to the development of flank eruptions, potentially the most hazardous type of eruption from basaltic volcanoes in densely urbanized areas like those at Mt. Etna...|$|R

50|$|Although {{the mass}} transit world showed {{a lack of}} interest, AGT systems quickly found a number of niche roles that they have {{continued}} to fill to this day. Tampa International Airport was the world's first to incorporate an AGT system as an inter-terminal connector in 1971. Its landside/airside set up allows the airport to increase capacity without spreading out. The LTV Airtrans was another early AGT systems which was installed at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and went into operation in January 1975 (later replaced by the DFW Skylink system in 2005). Similar systems followed at airports around the world, and today they are relatively universal at larger airports, often connecting terminals with distant long-term parking lots. Similar systems were also a fixture {{of a number of}} amusement parks, notably the Walt Disney World Monorail System and the Toronto Zoo Domain Ride. The Getty Center in Los Angeles uses a unique vertically oriented AGT to bring visitors from a parking lot off Interstate 405 to the Center {{at the top of a}} hill in Brentwood; this system places the motor outside the vehicle at the top of the guideway to reduce the weight lifted up the hill and thus improve efficiency. Small AGT systems are also used as circulator or <b>feeder</b> <b>systems</b> within urban centers. The city of Miami installed its Metromover system in 1986 and later extended it by 4.4 miles and added 12 new stations it in 1994. Similar INNOVIA APM 100 systems operate in Singapore's Bukit Panjang district and in Guangzhou, China.|$|E

40|$|Horses {{housed in}} small {{enclosures}} perform minimal exercise. A novel <b>feeder</b> <b>system</b> may promote exercise but may have behavioral consequences. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the ability of horses to learn to use a novel feeding system and determine the behavioral effects of its use. A dynamic feed station was developed to force horses to exercise to continuously access feed. The behaviour of five groups of two horses was assessed while being housed for three days in either a control (contained a simple hay rack) and research (with the novel feeder) paddock. In the research paddock on day 1, horses were taught to use the feeder by the observer. On day 2 (feeder operational) and day 3 (feeder nonoperational) horses were observed for 4 hours per day to determine speed of learning and incidence of aggressive behaviours between horses. Horses quickly learnt to use the <b>feeder</b> <b>system.</b> Learning was affected by domination relationships between horses. Dominating horses learnt faster and aggressive behaviours appeared to be amplified when the feeder was operational. To reduce the stress impact of the <b>feeder</b> <b>system</b> on horses, horses housed together should be well matched to avoid strong domination relationships. The dynamic <b>feeder</b> <b>system</b> could then be utilized more successfully to increase exercise in horses housed in small paddocks...|$|R
