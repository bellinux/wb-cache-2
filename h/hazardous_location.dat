In addition the [...] "mother hen" [...] is provided with large and sundry rooms and refrigeration spaces from which the destroyers are provisioned, clothed, and provided with the necessary spare parts for their maintenance. In addition, and like all good mothers the [...] "mother hen" [...] takes care {{of many of the}} destroyers personnel in administering to their pains, ills, and injuries. With World War II over, and the task of [...] "tending" [...] the Navy's [...] "tin-cans" [...] being minimized, the USS Cascade, like many of the other [...] "mother-hens" [...] has every reason in the world to crow — shout, if you wish, about all the good deeds which have been accomplished by the vessel in helping destroyers and other craft on the road to victory.As a destroyer tender, the USS Cascades role in the war has been that of repairing, overhauling and supplying combatant destroyers of the Third, Fifth and Seventh fleets. Up until the time the Philippine Islands were secured, every fleet turn around found the USS Cascade busily engaged in preparing her assigned quota of ships for operations against the Japanese. Although designed primarily to handle destroyers and destroyer type vessels, the USS Cascade in nearly three years of duty in the Pacific has serviced more than a thousand ships. The majority of destroyers and destroyer escorts which numbered nearly half that number were serviced as many as four times each. In addition, the ship has tended 175 landing craft (LST, LCI, LCM, LSD, and LCS), almost 100 sub-chasers, 60 transports, 32 cargo ships, 56 tankers, 37 mine sweepers, 10 cruisers, 7 aircraft carriers, and a miscellaneous group of other types neighboring around one hundred in number. Due to the long supply line which commenced to make itself felt in November 1943, the USS Cascade was dovetailed into another assignment in addition to her original assignment. While machine shops hummed the new job added to the increasing tempo of the ship's activity. During the two years of this duty, ten thousand tons of fresh and dry provisions were received and issued. Five hundred and fifty one tons of clothing were issued and an equal number of tons of ship's store stock was sold by the ship. The combined value of these issues amounted to more than five million dollars.A 15,000-ton destroyer tender, the USS Cascade was built by the Western Pipe and Steel Company of South San Francisco, California. Originally designed as a passenger-freighter, the keel for the Cascade was laid 6 July 1942. The ship was sponsored by Mrs. Charles W. Crosse, wife of Rear Admiral Charles W. Crosse, USN. It was turned over to the Matson Navigation Company of San Francisco, California for outfitting in October 1942. Joslyn & Ryan, Naval Architects of that city, assisted in the completion of the ship. On 12 March 1943 the USS Cascade was placed in commission with Captain S. B. Ogden, as commanding officer. There were at that time thirty (30) officers, forty-five (45) Chief Petty Officers and six hundred twenty six (626) enlisted men in the crew. After thirty days at Mare Island Navy Yard where some necessary alterations were made the ship sailed for San Diego and engaged in training operations for a short period. At the conclusion of training; orders were received to report for duty to Commander Destroyers Pacific Fleet, in connection with tending and repairing destroyers, and in accordance with these orders the ship sailed from the United States on 12 June 1943, arriving at Pearl Harbor 18 June 1943. As the activities of the ship increased it became necessary the latter part of 1943 to increase personnel of the ship to forty nine officers, eight Chief Petty Officers and one thousand fifty enlisted men. During the two years and seven months that the USS Cascade has been in commission, the commanding officers have been Captain Samuel B. Ogden, US Navy, Paramount Apartments 565 Geary Street, San Francisco, California; Captain Herbert K. Gates, US Navy, 919 North McLellan Street, Bay City, Michigan; and the present Captain, Louis T. Young, US Navy, 1816 North Louise Street, Glendale 7, California. It has sailed a distance of over fifteen thousand (15,000) miles, which for a ship of the Navy, is not an impressive figure, but nearly all of it was steamed in the forward operating areas as the war in the Pacific moved westward. In order to remain {{as close as possible to}} the operating areas of the Pacific Fleet, the USS Cascade was stationed at the following islands and atolls during the periods as indicated:* Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, June — November 1943* Funafuti, Ellice Islands, November 1943 — February 1944* Kwajalein Atoll, Marshall Islands, March — May 1944* Eniwetok Atoll, Marshall Islands, July — October 1944* Ulithi Atoll, Caroline Islands, October 1944-May 1945* Kerama Retto, Okinawa, June 1945* Buckner Bay, Okinawa, July-September 1945* Wakayama, Japan, September 1945Of these the most interesting, yet most <b>hazardous</b> <b>location</b> that the ship operated was at Kerama Retto, Okinawa during the month of June 1945. The main island of Okinawa had not as yet been secured and Kamikaze raids took place almost nightly. A few such raids were conducted during the daylight hours also. Kerama Retto served as a refuge for destroyers and smaller ships damaged by the Japanese fliers. Here these ships which the USS Cascade and her sister tenders repaired were made ready once again for battle. Others which were more seriously damaged were made seaworthy for their long voyages to the Navy Yards of the United States. Among these ships who achieved nationwide publicity by their ability to sustain damage and still knock Japanese planes out of the air were the following vessels: USS Laffey, USS Evans, USS Cassin Young, USS Leutze, USS Braine, USS Stormes, USS Aaron Ward, and the USS Shannon.The ship is currently winding up a Pacific tour of duty while tending US Navy ships off Wakayama, Japan. The next assignment to the Reserve Fleet, Atlantic, will return the USS Cascade to water and land the vessel has not seen in three years.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{presents}} a methodology for ranking road safety <b>hazardous</b> <b>locations</b> using analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Road accident causes huge losses {{to the economy}} {{in terms of the}} cost incurred in hospitalization and treatment and damages to vehicles and property etc. There is an urgent need to reduce the number and severity of road accidents by implementing remedial measures at <b>hazardous</b> <b>locations</b> in the road network. Further, it is generally not possible to implement all remedial measures identified due to limited budget available for road safety improvement. Hence, it is needed to rank the <b>hazardous</b> <b>locations</b> so that depending on the available budget, the <b>hazardous</b> <b>locations</b> can be treated. However, literature review indicated that most of the methodologies require accident data for this purpose. Comprehensive road accident data is rarely available. Hence, this study {{presents a}} four stage methodology for ranking road safety <b>hazardous</b> <b>locations</b> which do not require accident data. The methodology presents a hierarchical structural for identification of safety factors. Road safety hazardous conditions are decomposed into safety hazardous condition at straight sections, safety hazardous condition at curve sections and safety hazardous condition at intersections. Analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is used to determine the weight of the different identified safety factors. The Safety Hazardous Index is developed using weight of safety factors and condition rating of safety factors. The Safety Hazardous Index is developed separately to evaluate safety at straight section, safety at curve section and safety at intersection. It is expected that this study will be useful in treating more <b>hazardous</b> <b>locations</b> depending on the available budget for road safety improvement. here and insert your abstract text...|$|R

In this study, the geometry of road is considered to identify the hazardous locations with the concern of design standards used in Sri Lanka. Availability of accident data is a significant requirement in identifying <b>hazardous</b> <b>location</b> of roads.

In this study, Geometric Design Standards of Roads published by Road Development Authority on 1998 was considered as the design standards of National Highway in Sri Lanka. According to the design standards; hazardous locations or road stretches were initially identified. Then major parameters of road geometry such as horizontal alignment, vertical profile and road side activities and combination of these were considered as main influence elements. Thereafter essential factors of the each element were identified. After that the relative contribution of the elements to the safety of critical location or road sections was determined by using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) with a system of scores which were suggested by an expert panel subject to a consistency test of the expert responses.

40|$|ABSTRACT An {{accident}} {{black spot}} {{is a term}} used in road safety management to denote a place where road traffic ac-cidents have historically been concentrated. It may have occurred {{for a variety of}} reasons, such as a sharp drop or corner in a straight road, so oncoming traffic is concealed, a hidden junction on a fast road, poor or concealed warning signs at cross-roads. Transportation contributes to the economic, industrial, social and cultural development of any country. Transportation by road is the only mode which could give maximum service to one and all. Due to the increase in population, number of vehicles is increasing day by day which leads to the increase in road network. It has been estimated that over 30, 000 persons die and over 10 to 15 million persons are injured every single year in road accidents throughout the world. The present work intended in identifying various black spots (accident prone location) in BANGALORE city. The causes of accidents are studied and suggested different reme-dial measures to reduce number of accidents. The four main strategies are: single site or black spot programs, mass action plans, route action plans, and area-wide schemes. The stages of the <b>hazardous</b> <b>location</b> improvement process are as follows: • A good accident database; • Agreeing a local <b>hazardous</b> <b>location</b> improvement program; • Accident analysis to identify accident black spots; • Design of remedial measures; • Implementing the measures; and • Monitoring the effectiveness of remedial measures.

40|$|Abstract. Identifying <b>hazardous</b> <b>locations</b> on {{highways}} is {{an essential}} step for safety improvement programs and projects since it provides decision makers with a logical and scientific basis for the allocation of resources in a cost-effective manner. There have been numerous studies conducted to develop suitable methodologies for identifying hazardous locations; however, {{most of them have}} not considered spatial interactions which are inherent in traffic accidents. In this paper, we use the GIS-based geographically weighted regression (GWR) that can model crash outcomes and identify <b>hazardous</b> <b>locations</b> on expressways while reflecting the effect of spatial dependency and heterogeneity on the outbreak of traffic accidents. This method has been applied to a case study at Gyeongbu Expressway in Korea with 3 -year crash data. Koenker's studentized Bruesch-Pagan and Moran’s I tests confirm the spatial relationship among crash data. The findings indicate that it is proper to model crash frequency with GWR for identifying <b>hazardous</b> <b>locations...</b>|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Nowadays, {{there are}} many efforts in {{different}} countries to identify <b>hazardous</b> road <b>locations</b> through different models in Geographic Information System (GIS) software. Our goal was to identify <b>hazardous</b> <b>locations</b> {{on a part of}} Yazd-Kerman highway located in Yazd province. It was by using hot zone method in GIS, and the relationship between these locations and environmental and demographic variables was assessed. Methods: By using hot zone method, each road (Yazd-Kerman & Kerman-Yazd path) was divided into segments named Basic Spatial Units (BSUs). A BSU was defined as 1 Kilometer. For each BSU, variables such as number, time and cause of crashes, vehicle type, weather, age, sex and status of drivers were collected. The <b>hazardous</b> <b>locations</b> were classified in two definition groups as Hot Zones and Yellow Zones. Results: According to results, 17 % of total 212 -kilometer road was identified as <b>hazardous</b> <b>locations.</b> The most drivers engaged in crashes in these locations (34 %) were in age group of 31 - 40. Motorcars, trailers and trucks had the most crashes, respectively. The most frequently cause of crashes was non-attendance to front and miss control of vehicle. The most number of crashes were taken place in the sunny climate. Conclusion: Considering that <b>hazardous</b> <b>locations</b> increase near entrances, exits and junctions, it seems that paying attention to road design principles may cause a great reduction in the crash rate. A safe design also can reduce the effect of environmental factors such as weather, time and even vehicle type. Furthermore a good training program, especially for age 21 - 40, may have a great role in minimize the human errors in crash occurrence...|$|R
