40|$|AbstractOne of {{the main}} {{challenges}} in <b>generating</b> <b>gear</b> grinding is the determination of cutting forces due to their significant influence on {{the dynamics of the}} grinding process. Thus, optimizing the cutting forces can lead to an increased quality of ground gears and a minimized wear behavior of the grinding worm. Currently, the knowledge of the generating grinding process is limited and research is based mostly on empirical studies. A theoretical model which help to predict the cutting forces is missing. This paper presents an initial approach for calculating the complex contact conditions in <b>generating</b> <b>gear</b> grinding as well as cutting forces and key values to characterize the process.

40|$|Abstract. Based on {{spiral bevel}} gear NC {{manufacture}} principle and generating motion of the <b>generating</b> <b>gear</b> and the work gear, the NC generation of {{spiral bevel gear}} cutting is realized {{by means of the}} vector transformation. As sophisticated calculation of the transformation is hard to implement in each interpolation cycle of NC machining, the coordinated motion of NC coordinate axes is expressed as quintic parametric spline functions, which use the rotation angle of the work gear as the parameter. The constrained optimization method of three design variables is established to obtain contacting points of gear tooth surfaces, which are acquired by solving nonlinear equations sets traditionally. The condition of normal coincidence is simplified and the object function of the equal position vectors of mating gears is established. The contacting points of gear tooth surfaces can be used for tooth contact analysis. The parametric curve interpolator is combined with spiral bevel gear NC machining, and is applied to the self-developed spiral bevel gear NC milling machine to control the gear cutting. Experimental results show that the proposed method is feasible and effective in the control of NC machining for the spiral bevel gear...|$|E

Its movement form is equivalent to a pair of gears transmission which the surface of the gear-honing-tool is adhered a layer of grinding grain. When it works in rolling processing, the contact-point between the workpiece and gear-honing-tool is moving. Then the moving point becomes a line in the space, and with the gear-honing-tool being in axial play, a standard flank of tooth is finished. Using the gear meshing principle, kinematics model of relative sliding velocity in the contact- point between the workpiece and tools is established, based on which the contact-line equation. and acceleration equation. at the contact-point are derived. The contact-line is solved in a given parameters of the workpiece and tool in MATLAB. The theoretical derivation and experimental results show that the speed in diverse along the direction of the tooth depth is the main reason for the roughness value and surface texture of workpiece. The acceleration of contact-line at the tooth flank is different, and it is leading reason that the processed workpiece gears appear profile distortion. Finally, the testing system is established for researching honing gear process. It is showed in the results that the acceleration difference can lead to the CBN abrasive falling away from gear honing tool, and even the "anti-cutting " phenomenon...|$|E

Although some of these mechanisms appear to be widely different they are {{of the family of}} 2 ̆ 2 gerotors 2 ̆ 2 and have the same basic mathematical shape generation relationships. Rotary volume displacing mechanisms classified as gerotors have lobes or teeth on the two working surfaces with all lobes in continuous contact. The number of lobes on the working surfaces differ by one, e. g. the Wankel rotary engine has three lobes on the rotor and two lobes on the housing. ^ The result of this study is the presentation of the analytical methods for determining the maximum theoretical flow rate and compression ratio for a given gerotor.

To efficiently ensure {{the quality of}} these systems, engineers require automated tools for the validation of the requirements throughout the development.

There {{is no question about}} the way of <b>generating</b> a <b>gear</b> with a rack cutter or a spur gear-shaper cutter. 　Now speaking of <b>generating</b> a conical <b>gear,</b> the way of using a hob is practically much commoner and easier than that of using a rack cutter or a gear-shaper cutter. Cutting the gear with a hob comes to the same result with cutting it with a rack cutter set obliquely to the pitch circle of the gear, as the hob is shaped into a screw-like form. Asymmetric teeth are obtained by feeding a rack cutter set obliquely to the pitch circle of the gear along any element of the cone. 　We show in detail the process of <b>generating</b> a conical <b>gear</b> with a hob and the difference between both the normal pitches of {{the right and the left}} profiles of a gear tooth.

40|$|The {{geometry}} of {{spiral bevel gears}} and to their rational design are studied. The nonconjugate tooth surfaces of spiral bevel gears are, in theory, replaced (or approximated) by conjugated tooth surfaces. These surfaces can be generated by two conical surfaces, and by a conical surface and a revolution. Although these conjugated tooth surfaces are simpler than the actual ones, the determination of their principal curvatures and directions is still a complicated problem. Therefore, a new approach, to the solution of these is proposed. Direct relationships between the principal curvatures and directions of the tool surface {{and those of the}} <b>generated</b> <b>gear</b> surface are obtained. With the aid of these analytical tools, the Hertzian contact problem for conjugate tooth surfaces can be solved. These results are useful in determining compressive load capacity and surface fatigue life of spiral bevel gears. A general theory of kinematical errors exerted by manufacturing and assembly errors is developed. This theory is used to determine the analytical relationship between gear misalignments and kinematical errors. This is important to the study of noise and vibration in geared systems...|$|R

40|$|Noise {{produced}} by components in a diesel affect {{the quality of}} the engine noise. One component source related to consumer complaints is gear rattle. Gear rattle is caused by gear tooth impacts resulting from fluctuations in differential torsional acceleration of the driving gears. Previous work in this area has focused on rating the overall sound quality of diesel engines without specifically focusing on models for predicting the perception of gear rattle. Here, a method to generate sounds having different levels of gear rattle is described. First, diesel engine noise recordings were analyzed to determine the engine speed time histories; they were then used to guide gear impact timing and to <b>generate</b> <b>gear</b> noise components.

The gear noise simulation tool is presently being used to generate sounds for subjective tests designed to quantify the detectability, perception of growth, and annoyance of gear rattle. The noise prediction coupled with the sound quality models based on the analysis of the subjective data will provide a way to predict how people perceive gear rattle so that component noise targets can be set directly related to human perception...|$|R
