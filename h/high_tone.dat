5|$|Past tense {{is marked}} by the preverbal {{particle}} ná (<b>high</b> <b>tone,</b> {{as opposed to the}} low tone continuative particle). Future tense {{is marked by}} the particle wè. Simple sentences without a preverbal tense particle are interpreted as recent past (sometimes called immediate). If aspect marking is absent, simple sentences are generally interpreted as completive.|$|E
5|$|The woman's {{hands are}} crossed tightly {{as if in}} prayer, and {{positioned}} so low in the painting as {{to appear to be}} resting on the frame. They are rendered as tightly compressed into a small area of the picture; it is likely van der Weyden did not want them to result in an area of <b>high</b> <b>tone</b> that might distract from the description of her head. Her slender fingers are minutely detailed; van der Weyden often indicated the social position of his models through his rendering of their face and hands. The sleeve of her dress extends beyond her wrists. Her fingers are folded in layers; their intricate portrayal is the most detailed element in the painting, and echoes the pyramidal form of the upper portion of the painting.|$|E
25|$|A {{three-way}} phonemic contrast exists after a <b>high</b> <b>tone,</b> {{which may}} be followed by another <b>high</b> <b>tone,</b> a low tone, or a downstep to another <b>high</b> <b>tone.</b>|$|E
50|$|Jemez <b>high</b> <b>tones</b> {{are similar}} to those of Mandarin Chinese, except there's a {{characteristic}} slight rise at the end. Voiced consonants tend to lower the onset of pitch in <b>high</b> <b>tones.</b> If there are several <b>high</b> <b>tones</b> in a row, the pitch also tends to rise throughout. Falling tones fall from the level of high to mid pitch.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} other {{exceptions}} to Meeussens rule. For example, in verbs in Shona, in certain circumstances two <b>high</b> <b>tones</b> may occur in adjacent syllables. In the subjunctive tí-téngésé we should sell, both tí and té- have underlying <b>high</b> <b>tones</b> (the <b>high</b> <b>tones</b> of -ngésé arise from tone spreading), yet the tone of té- is not deleted. Likewise in the Chewa verb a-ná-ká-fótokoza he went and explained, the tone of ká go and does not get lowered, despite following the high-toned tense-marker ná.|$|R

25|$|The {{prosodic}} {{system of}} Koshikijima, {{like that of}} mainland Kagoshima, is characterized as a two-pattern pitch accent. It differs, however, in {{the placement of the}} accent. In this system, the primary <b>high</b> <b>tone</b> falls on a mora and is always preceded by a low-pitched syllable. Any other syllables preceding the low one will automatically bear a <b>high</b> <b>tone.</b>|$|E
25|$|Similar to the Kagoshima Accent, the <b>high</b> <b>tone</b> is {{assigned}} to the very last mora in an unaccented unit. In an accented unit, the <b>high</b> <b>tone</b> falls on the penultimate mora and falls {{back down on the}} last mora. Tone placement will also shift accordingly when morphemes and the such are appended to the unit.|$|E

25|$|Note {{that the}} <b>high</b> <b>tone</b> {{falls on the}} {{syllable}} rather than the mora, so tone placement remains unaffected by moraic obstruents, moraic nasals, fricatives resulting from devoicing, long vowels and diphthongs.|$|E
25|$|These tenses {{occur only}} in {{dependent}} clauses. They generally have relative clause intonation, that is, with a <b>high</b> <b>tone</b> on the subject-marker.

50|$|When {{listening}} to the illusion over headphones, most right-handers hear a melody corresponding to the <b>higher</b> <b>tones</b> as {{on the right and}} a melody corresponding to the lower tones as on the left. When the earphone positions are reversed, the <b>higher</b> <b>tones</b> continue to appear to be coming from the right and the lower tones from the left. Other people experience different illusions, such as the <b>higher</b> <b>tones</b> on the left and the lower tones on the right, or a pattern in which the sounds appear to be localized in different and changing ways. Right-handers and left-handers differ statistically in how the scale illusion is perceived.|$|R

50|$|The three <b>high</b> <b>tones</b> ú, ú, and áń {{stand out}} {{prominently}} {{from the other}} syllables, and each one is a little lower than the last.

25|$|As the {{prosodic}} {{unit of the}} dialect consists not of a lexical word {{but rather}} a minimal syntactic phrase known as bunsetsu, the <b>high</b> <b>tone</b> will shift, realigning itself to the ultimate or penultimate syllable, when morphemes, auxiliaries or grammatical particles such as が ga are appended at the end.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} sets of possessive pronouns. One of them is transparently derived from the set of {{personal}} pronouns plus a connexive suffix –íín. Another set is less clearly related to the simple personal pronouns; all possessive pronouns of this set bear a <b>High</b> <b>tone.</b> The third set {{is derived from the}} second set by appending the nominalizing suffix -ní.|$|E
25|$|Nouns in Nobiin are {{predominantly}} disyllabic, although monosyllabic and three- or four-syllabic nouns are also found. Nouns {{can be derived}} from adjectives, verbs, or other nouns by appending various suffixes. In plural formation, the tone of a noun becomes Low and one of four plural markers is suffixed. Two of these are Low in tone, while the other two have a <b>High</b> <b>tone.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{representation}} of tone. Most non-linguistic transcriptions of Mixtec {{do not fully}} record the tones. When tone is represented, acute accent over the vowel is typically used to indicate <b>high</b> <b>tone.</b> Mid tone is sometimes indicated with a macron over the vowel, {{but it may be}} left unmarked. Low tone is sometimes indicated with a grave accent overt the vowel, but it might be left unmarked, or it might be indicated with an underscore to the vowel.|$|E
25|$|Tlingit {{has eight}} vowels, four vowels further {{distinguished}} formally by length. However, the length distinction is often {{in terms of}} tenseness rather than length, particularly in rapid speech. For the Northern dialect, the dominant spoken dialect of Tlingit and the standard for written Tlingit, every vowel may take either high or low tone; in the orthography <b>high</b> <b>tone</b> is indicated by an acute accent, e.g. áa, and low tone is unmarked, e.g. aa. The Southern and Transitional dialects have a mid tone which is unmarked and additional low tone which {{is marked by a}} grave accent, e.g. àa.|$|E
25|$|In Nobiin, every {{utterance}} {{ends in a}} low tone. This is one of {{the clearest}} signs of the occurrence of a boundary tone, realized as a low tone on the last syllable of any prepausal word. The examples below show how the surface tone of the <b>high</b> <b>tone</b> verb ókkír- ‘cook’ depends on the position of the verb. In the first sentence, the verb is not final (because the question marker –náà is appended) and thus it is realized as high. In the second sentence, the verb {{is at the end of}} the utterance, resulting in a low tone on the last syllable.|$|E
