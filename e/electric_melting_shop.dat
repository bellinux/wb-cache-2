40|$|The paper reviews {{original}} {{data obtained by}} the present authors, revealed in recent separate publications, describing specific procedures for high quality grey irons, and reflecting the forecast needs of the worldwide iron foundry industry. High power, medium frequency coreless induction furnaces are commonly used in <b>electric</b> <b>melting</b> grey iron foundries. This has resulted in low sulphur (1, 500 °C), contributing to unfavourable conditions for graphite nucleation. Thin wall castings are increasingly produced by these <b>electric</b> <b>melt</b> <b>shops</b> with a risk of greater eutectic undercooling during solidification. The paper focused on two groups of grey cast irons and their specific problems: carbides and graphite morphology control in lower carbon equivalent high strength irons (CE= 3. 4 %- 3. 8 %), and austenite dendrite promotion in eutectic and slightly hypereutectic irons (CE= 4. 1 %- 4. 5 %), {{in order to increase}} their strength characteristics. There are 3 stages and 3 steps involving graphite formation, iron chemistry and iron processing that appear to be important. The concept in the present paper sustains a threestage model for nucleating flake graphite [(Mn,X) S type nuclei]. There are three important groups of elements (deoxidizer, Mn/S, and inoculant) and three technological stages in <b>electric</b> <b>melting</b> of iron (superheat, pre-conditioning of base iron, final inoculation). Attention is drawn to a control factor (%Mn) x (%S) ensuring it equals to 0. 03 – 0. 06, accompanied by 0. 005 wt. %– 0. 010 wt. % Al and/or Zr content in inoculated irons. It was found that iron powder addition promotes austenite dendrite formation in eutectic and slightly eutectic, acting as reinforcement for the eutectic cells. But, there is an accompanying possible negative influence on the characteristics of the (Mn,X) S type graphite nuclei (change the morphology of nuclei from polygonal compact to irregular polygonal, and therefore promote chill tendency in treated irons). A double addition (iron powder + inoculant) appears to be an effective treatment to benefit both austenite and graphite nucleation, with positive effects on the final structure and chill tendency...|$|R

50|$|In 1992 {{the site}} {{was taken over by}} Avesta Sheffield Ltd, a company formed from the merger of British Steel Stainless Ltd and the Swedish company Avesta AB.

50|$|The {{steel making}} plant was changed in 1897 when the Bessemer {{converters}} {{were replaced by}} three open hearth furnaces and the processing plant increased {{with the addition of}} cogging mills, rail mills and specialist plant for the manufacture of steel springs and railway axles. In 1914, following the outbreak of the First World War many iron and steel companies began producing munitions. In this case the work was added to the normal production, which included many component orders for the military. The Ickles site was proving too small to handle the production, and with steel in such demand, the company extended their works towards the Sheffield boundary, to occupy a site between the main Sheffield to Rotherham road and the Great Central Railway line. The new <b>Melting</b> <b>Shop</b> and Rolling Mills were built over the site of the old Roman fort at Templeborough. The Templeborough <b>Melting</b> <b>Shop,</b> when opened, was the largest <b>melting</b> <b>shop</b> of its type in Europe and contained 14 open hearth furnaces where steel scrap was melted down.|$|R

40|$|Occupational {{exposure}} {{studies were}} undertaken at a UK {{electric arc furnace}} (EAF) steelmak-ing plant to investigate the exposure of workers via inhalation to dioxins, polychlorinated bi-phenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) including benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P). Surveys were undertaken in areas including the <b>melting</b> <b>shop,</b> the casting department and a furnace control cabin. The highest concentrations of dioxins and PCBs were found inside the <b>melting</b> <b>shop</b> nearby EAFs, whereas dioxin and PCB concentrations in the casting depart-ment and inside the control cabin were significantly lower. Risk characterization {{was carried out by}} comparing the daily intake of dioxins and PCBs through inhalation with the recommen-ded tolerable daily intake (TDI).

For the most exposed category of workers (<b>melting</b> <b>shop</b> workers), the estimated daily intake via inhalation was 0. 35 pgWHO-TEQ kg 21 body weight (bw) in the worst case scenario. Considering that the average UK adult exposure to dioxins from the diet is 1. 8 pg WHO-TEQ kg 21 bw day 21, the results indicated that the estimated daily intake of dioxins via inhalation at the EAF would not result in the recommended range of the TDI (1 – 4 pg WHO-TEQ kg 21 bw day 21) bein...|$|R

40|$|The {{recycling}} options of spent MgO-C refractories from an electrical arc furnace (EAF) have been evaluated. The economic, quality of spent refractories and products made from it, {{the ease of}} implementation of a recycling practice and the interest of steel <b>melt</b> <b>shops</b> were considered. It was decided that the best option of most EAF shops would be to recycle spent MgO-C refractory as a foaming slag conditioner because of their MgO content. Crushed MgO-C spent refractories can be reused directly back into an EAF without complex and costly beneficiation. Even though this practice is simple, {{it is critical to}} know the optimum amount of MgO in the slag to achieve the best foaming quality.
