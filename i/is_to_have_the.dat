5|$|Miyamoto {{wanted to}} make a game that was cinematic, yet {{distinguished}} from actual films. Takumi Kawagoe, who creates cutscenes for Nintendo, says that his top priority <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> player feel in control of the action. To promote this instantaneous continuity of cinematic gameplay, the cutscenes in Ocarina of Time are completely generated with real-time computing on the Nintendo 64 console and do not use prerendered full-motion video. Miyamoto's vision required this real-time architecture for the total of more than 90 minutes of cutscenes, regardless of whether the console had a vast medium like CD-ROM on which to store prerendered versions. Toru Osawa created the scenario for the game, based on a story idea by Miyamoto and Yoshiaki Koizumi. He was given support by A Link to the Past and Link's Awakening script writer Kensuke Tanabe. Miyamoto said the real-time rendering engine allowed his small team of 3 to 7 cinematic developers to rapidly adjust the storyline and to focus on developing additional gameplay elements even up to the final few months of development, instead of waiting on a repeated prerendering process. The dungeons were designed by Eiji Aonuma.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} {{association is}} an incorporated body of volunteers {{who use the}} fort under licence from the Minister. The association operate the fort and visitor centre, holding monthly public open days at which {{the history of the}} fort is recreated; this includes drill demonstrations and firing of the fort's weapons. The association maintain static displays of the fort's active period and sell souvenirs. The association's goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> site open as a fully operational fort for interpretation, tourism and education. The volunteers are involved with recreation, living history and ceremonial work outside the fort. They act as guards of honour at some Government House functions and attended the restoration opening of the Albany, Western Australia fort, and the annual re-enactment of the Battle of Waterloo in Keyneton, Victoria. The fort has living history displays, including the barracks laid out and furnished in period detail. The visitor centre has displays showing the development of South Australia's colonial defence from 1836 and artifacts found on site during restorations.|$|E
25|$|Stableford is a {{scoring system}} {{used in the}} sport of golf. Rather than {{counting}} {{the total number of}} strokes taken, as in stroke play, it involves scoring points {{based on the number of}} strokes taken at each hole. Unlike traditional scoring methods, where the aim <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> lowest score, under Stableford rules, the objective <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> highest score.|$|E
50|$|Another {{priority}} of <b>the</b> structure construction <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> least environmental {{impact on the}} ice as possible.|$|R
2500|$|In the 1930s {{it became}} clear that a new {{headquarters}} building was needed and very ambitious targets were set for the building: it <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the tallest building in South Africa (possibly in the whole continent of Africa, {{with the exception of the}} pyramids in Egypt), it <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> fastest lifts, it <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> largest windows. At the same time it <b>was</b> <b>to</b> epitomise the values of the business: [...] "Strength, Security and Confidence in the Future"; this demanded a combination of traditional and contemporary design.|$|R
50|$|Dismounted Land Warriors, when within {{communications}} {{range of}} their Stryker vehicle, <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same voice connectivity and Army Battle Command System interoperability as the mounted Land Warrior.|$|R
25|$|In general, {{the norm}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> clerk {{of the court}} issue the {{subpoena}} for an upcoming trial in that same court.|$|E
25|$|The {{most useful}} and {{standard}} method of amine alkylation <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> amine form an amide bond, and subsequently reduce it, often with LiAlH4.|$|E
25|$|On May 31, 2017 {{the first}} Stratolaunch Carrier Aircraft was towed {{out of the}} Stratolaunch Mojave {{building}} to start ground testing. The plan <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> first launch in 2019.|$|E
50|$|D. A. Heger (2004) {{presented}} {{a performance comparison}} of binary search trees. Treap <b>was</b> found <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> best average performance, while red-black tree <b>was</b> found <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> smallest amount of performance variations.|$|R
2500|$|One of {{the first}} acts of Dr. French <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> RNA join the American Numismatic Association as Branch 2. [...] The Chicago Numismatic Society had become ANA Branch 1 in 1904.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} find out what the chances are of a patient with a {{positive}} or negative test result having or not <b>having</b> <b>the</b> disease, the likelihood ratios (LRs) need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> calculated. The LR incorporates both the sensitivity and specificity of the test and provides an estimate of how much a positive or negative test result changes <b>the</b> chances of <b>having</b> or not <b>having</b> <b>the</b> disease. So a positive LR tells you how much more likely patients <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> disease when the test is positive. The negative LR tells you how much less likely patients <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> disease when the test is negative.|$|R
25|$|The {{future for}} acrobatic Rock ’n’ Roll seems bright, the hope and main goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> dance {{as a part}} of the Olympic games within the near future. WRRC is today {{recognised}} by the IOC.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} {{efforts by the}} city tourism agency to bring more tourism to the borough, {{especially}} to Tlalpan center. One proposal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> Turibus tour bus system include a stop in the area. However, studies and neighborhood groups have express concerns {{about the possibility of}} this leading to deterioration of the area.|$|E
25|$|Another {{alternative}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> candidates themselves {{create an}} ordered list of successors before leaving their seat. In the European Parliament, a departing Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland member is {{replaced with the}} top eligible name from a replacement list submitted by the candidate {{at the time of}} the original election.|$|E
2500|$|That the Nazis didn't want <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a great revolt—"Second Warsaw"—nor small revolts, {{and their}} passion <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> {{extermination}} machine working smoothly without resistance.

50|$|Ayre's funeral {{took place}} on 21 April at St. Cuthbert's Church in Halsall, near Ormskirk, and his final wish <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> Blackpool team with whom he won {{promotion}} in 1992 be present. His wish was granted.|$|R
2500|$|Thus {{the term}} [...] "screen saver" [...] is now {{something}} of a misnomer – {{the best way to}} save the screen (and also save electricity consumed by screen) would simply <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> computer turn off the monitor.|$|R
25|$|In a two wire {{system the}} {{standard}} arrangement for diver communications <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> diver's side normally on, {{so that the}} surface team can hear anything from the diver at all times except when the surface is sending a message. In a four-wire system the diver's side is always on, even when the surface operator is talking.|$|E
25|$|Various {{branches}} of the British military have operated Gazelles in other theatres, such as during the 1991 Gulf War against Iraq and in the 1999 intervention in Kosovo. While the type was originally intended to be retired in 2012, the Gazelle {{will continue to be}} operated in a policing capacity in Northern Ireland until 2018, at which point the Police Service of Northern Ireland <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> assets to fill this role itself.|$|E
25|$|A {{standard}} {{arrangement with}} wired diver communications <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> diver's side normally on, {{so that the}} surface team can hear anything from the diver at all times except when the surface is sending a message. This is considered an important safety feature, as the surface team can monitor the diver's breathing sounds, which can give early warning of problems developing, and confirms that the diver is alive.|$|E
50|$|According {{to local}} {{tradition}} Queen Christina of Sweden <b>was</b> <b>to</b> confer upon Åmmeberg city privileges, but her carriage {{broke down in}} Askersund, and the queen who preferred not travel any further decided that Askersund <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> city rights.|$|R
25|$|A {{suggested}} {{alternative that}} would not <b>have</b> required <b>the</b> demolition of homes would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> elevated structure between Eastern Parkway and Cypress Hills replaced, with a new structure that would run directly via Jamaica Avenue with new stops built.|$|R

25|$|Additionally, the Drugs for Neglected Disease Initiative {{has contributed}} to the African {{sleeping}} sickness research effort by developing a compound called fexinidazole. This project was originally started in April 2007 and is currently in a pivotal study in clinical phase II/III.36 The goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> drug succeed and be proven effective again stage one and stage two HAT caused by T. b. gambiense, as well HAT caused by T. b. rhodesiense.|$|E
25|$|The {{breadth of}} commonsense knowledge: The number of atomic facts {{that the average}} person knows is very large. Research {{projects}} that attempt to build a complete knowledge base of commonsense knowledge (e.g., Cyc) require enormous amounts of laborious ontological engineering—they must be built, by hand, one complicated concept at a time. A major goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> computer understand enough concepts {{to be able to}} learn by reading from sources like the Internet, and thus be able to add to its own ontology.|$|E
25|$|In partial {{suspension}} {{the person}} is bound {{in a way that}} part of their body weight is held by suspension ropes, cables or chains. The classic partial suspension position <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> person balancing on one foot with part of their weight supported through a chest harness and the other leg pulled up in some direction. A person lying on their upper back with legs tied upwards to a suspension point to pull their lower back off the ground would also qualify as partial suspension.|$|E
50|$|A {{line was}} {{proposed}} in 1864 from Croydon to Tunbridge Wells via Oxted {{by a group}} of former LB&SCR directors. Their proposal for the Surrey and Sussex Junction Railway (S&SJR) <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> scheme underwritten and then operated by the LB&SCR.|$|R
50|$|Formation of {{the first}} unit did not begin until early April 1863, with 100 men being sought at New Plymouth under Captain Atkinson. Hawke's Bay <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> next unit. By late April, papers were {{reporting}} few had enlisted in New Plymouth.|$|R
50|$|Alhallows-on-Sea {{was planned}} {{as the best}} holiday resort in Europe, and <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> largest {{swimming}} pool in the UK with the first artificial wave generator in Europe, and an amusement park four {{times the size of}} the Blackpool Pleasure Beach complex.|$|R
25|$|Unger's {{critique}} of and alternative to social programs {{goes to the}} heart of civil society. The problem we are faced with now, he claims, is that we have a bureaucratic system of distribution that provides lower quality service and prohibits the involvement of civil society in the provision of public services. The alternative he lays out <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> state act to equip civil society to partake in public services and care. This would entail empowering each individual to have two responsibilities, one in the productive economy and one in the caring economy.|$|E
25|$|The {{selection}} of which pitch to use {{can depend on}} a wide variety of situations such as; the type of hitter that is being faced, whether there are any base runners, how many outs have been made in the inning, or the current score, among others. The responsibility for selecting the type of pitch was traditionally made by the catcher. However, current form <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> manager or a coach relay the pitch selection to the catcher, via secret hand signals to prevent the opposing team from having the advantage of knowing what the next pitch will be.|$|E
25|$|On December 13, 2013, the Public Lighting Authority (PLA) {{completed}} the initial sale of $60 million in bonds, {{part of a}} $210 million, two-step bond issue, to finance the purchase of up to 50,000 LED street lights. The new 150 watt LED lights are longer-lasting, are {{more than twice as}} bright as the old 70 Watt sodium lights, and are more affordable to operate. The goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> installation completed in all neighborhoods by the end of 2015, and underground wiring of the thoroughfares done by the end of 2016.|$|E
25|$|Belgium was {{guaranteed}} by a Treaty in 1839, that no nation <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> right <b>to</b> claim the passage for its army through a neutral state. The treaty {{was in the}} case that Germany and France might enter a war between each other.|$|R
