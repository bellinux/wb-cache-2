25|$|Gibron {{stayed in}} Chicago in 1975, {{replacing}} Babe Parilli {{as head coach}} of the World Football League's Chicago Winds. The Winds got out to a 1–4 record before they were expelled from the league in September for falling below league <b>financial</b> <b>requirements,</b> a month before the entire league folded. Gibron was hired in 1976 as a defensive line coach with the expansion Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but was switched to defensive coordinator that March before returning to serve as line coach in later years. He had been a college teammate of Bucs head coach John McKay at Purdue. Gibron stayed in Tampa for seven seasons until McKay retired in early 1985 and was replaced by Leeman Bennett. He then served as a scout for the Seattle Seahawks by head coach Chuck Knox, and was accused later in the year of spying on the Cincinnati Bengals and attempting to steal their signals. Knox responded by saying Gibron's presence at a preseason game in Cincinnati could not have been a secret, given his large size. He stayed on as a scout until 1989, and later worked as an advisor to Bucs coach Sam Wyche.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, Nice, {{now back}} in the first division, stunned many when the club won the Coupe de France. The victory did not, however, shock most French {{football}} enthusiasts mainly due to the club's competition in the run up to the final, in which Nice faced only Division 2 clubs, excluding first division club Bastia. In the final, Nice defeated Guingamp 5–4 on penalties to earn cup success. On a sourer note, however, Nice were relegated from the first division only days after winning the Coupe de France in dead last in the league. The club spent five seasons in Ligue 2 and returned to Ligue 1 for the 2001–02 season. In the lead up to the season, Nice {{failed to meet the}} <b>financial</b> <b>requirements</b> set by the DNCG and were, subsequently, relegated to the Championnat National, the third level of French football. However, after achieving stability, mainly due to selling a few players, Nice were allowed in Ligue 1 after successfully appealing.

While Harrison biographer Dale Allison interprets a degree of animosity towards the other Beatles in the song's lyrics, Leng argues that they are directed solely at the legal profession. Inglis similarly dismisses the idea that Harrison was targeting his former bandmates; instead, the song expresses [...] "frustration rather than hostility" [...] and addresses the [...] "absurdity" [...] of the situation.

500|$|Unsurprisingly, {{given his}} own origins {{as a slave}} soldier, Ibn Tulun's regime {{was in many ways}} typical of the [...] "ghulām system" [...] that became one of the two main {{paradigms}} of Islamic polities in the 9th and 10th centuries, as the Abbasid Caliphate fragmented and new dynasties emerged. These regimes were based on the power of a regular army composed of ghilmān, but in turn, according to Hugh N. Kennedy, [...] "the paying of the troops was the major preoccupation of government". It is therefore {{in the context of the}} increased <b>financial</b> <b>requirements</b> that in 879, the supervision of the finances in Egypt and Syria passed to Abu Bakr Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Madhara'i, the founder of the al-Madhara'i bureaucratic dynasty that dominated the fiscal apparatus of Egypt for the next 70 years. Although, as Zaky M. Hassan notes, [...] "fragmentary evidence does not permit a thorough assessment of Tulunid economic and financial policies", it appears that the peace and security provided by the Tulunid regime, the establishment of an efficient administration, and repairs and expansions to the irrigation system, coupled with a consistently high level of Nile floods, resulted in a major increase in revenue. By the time of Ibn Tulun's death, income from the land tax alone had risen from 800,000 dinars under Ibn al-Mudabbir to the sum of 4.3 million dinars, and Ibn Tulun bequeathed his successor a fiscal reserve of ten million dinars. Crucial to this was the reform of the tax assessment and collection system, including the introduction of tax farming—which at the same time led to the rise of a new landholding class. Additional revenue was collected from commercial activities, most notably textiles and in particular linen.|$|E

Staff analysis of these comments concludes that the only recommended change from the proposed rule should be to use the existing definitions of waste processor and waste collector in 10 CFR Part 20, Appendix G, rather than introducing a new definition of waste broker in the regulations.

2500|$|In 1931, the French Admiralty {{explicitly}} {{confirmed the}} choice of a [...] battleship, since the [...] battleship would have been too lightly armored and the [...] battleship would have technical and <b>financial</b> <b>requirements</b> that outstripped France's capabilities. This [...] battleship would have had a length of [...] and a [...] beam, two quad /55 turrets forward, three quad [...] Dual Purpose (DP) turrets aft, a [...] top speed, [...] belt armor, and [...] deck armor. However, when in May 1931 this proposal was submitted to the Parliament, discussions continued for two months. Critics wondered why it was necessary to have twice the displacement of the warship to be countered and why it was not preferable to build a [...] battleship. Thus, in the July 1931 Estimates, funds were allocated only for further studies and the law required that the final characteristics be subject to a thorough review, to be reviewed by the Parliament before passing any building orders.|$|E

[...] After the early departures of Theo Robinson and Al Bangura, Tamás Priskin was sold to Ipswich Town {{in the first week of}} August, just before the start of the Championship season. Despite being able to transfer players at any stage between 1 July and 1 September, Watford conducted much of their business in the last week of the transfer window. Portsmouth submitted transfer bids for Smith and Williamson. Negotiations with Reading for Smith were ongoing, while their bid for McAnuff was accepted. Smith's transfer to Portsmouth and McAnuff's move to Reading were confirmed before Watford's match against Swansea City, with Williamson's transfer following a few days after. Mackay later expressed frustration at the latter transfer, revealing that after Watford rejected Williamson's transfer request, he declared himself unfit to train, play, or travel to Swansea.|$|E
2500|$|James T. Patterson has reiterated this argument, however {{he observes}} that this {{increased}} tension can {{be accounted for}} not just from a political perspective, but from an economic one, too. Patterson {{has argued that the}} tension between the federal and state governments also, at least partly, resulted from the economic strain under which the states had been put by the federal government's various policies and agencies. Some states were either simply unable to cope with the federal government's demand, and thus refused to work with them, or admonished the economic restraints and actively decided to sabotage federal policies. This was demonstrated, Patterson has noted, with the handling of federal relief money by Ohio governor, Martin L. Davey. The case in Ohio became so detrimental to the federal government that Harry Hopkins, supervisor of the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, had to federalize Ohio relief. Although this argument differs somewhat from Schlesinger's, the source of federal-state tension remained the growth of the federal government. As Patterson has asserted, [...] "though the record of the FERA was remarkably good—almost revolutionary—in these respects, it was inevitable, given the <b>financial</b> <b>requirements</b> imposed on deficit-ridden states, that friction would develop between governors and federal officials." ...|$|E
