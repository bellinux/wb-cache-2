5|$|The Department of Civil Aviation {{performed}} {{tests on}} {{parts of the}} DC-4 fuel system. Tests on the engine fuel system showed that when the engine boost pump was operating, a vortex formed in the engine fuel tank. If {{a small amount of}} water was present, this vortex held the water in suspension and prevented it from entering the engine. The tests also showed that when the boost pump was turned off, the vortex dissipated and any water would soon <b>find</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> into the engine. Investigators believed this might explain why all engines were operating normally during the takeoff but at least one engine began to run roughly around the time the engine boost pumps would be turned off.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the failure}} to remake the game for the WonderSwan Color, and Square's merger with former {{competitor}} Enix to form Square Enix in , the company posted assurance that the game's promised remake would not be completely forgotten, and there was speculation that it might <b>find</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> to Sony's PlayStation or Nintendo's Game Boy Advance as its predecessors had. Square Enix considered porting the game to the PlayStation 2, but was eventually convinced by Nintendo to develop the title for their new handheld system, the Nintendo DS, a decision that would later be positively reinforced by the commercial success of the Nintendo DS. The Final Fantasy III remake was first announced on October 24, 2004, but detailed information did not emerge for a year. Hiromichi Tanaka headed the project as both the executive producer and director. His guidance and supervision were needed because the remake was not a mere graphical update as Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy IIs remakes were, but a total overhaul using the Nintendo DS's 3D capabilities. Along with 3D graphics, a full motion video opening scene was produced for the game, {{similar to those found}} in the ports of the 2D Final Fantasy games for the PlayStation. Programming was handled by developer Matrix Software.|$|E

5|$|In April 1951 Justice Simpson {{advised the}} Minister for Civil Aviation that new {{evidence}} had become available. The Minister gave permission for the Inquiry to be re-opened. The Inquiry re-opened in Melbourne on 4 June 1951. The Department of Civil Aviation had recently completed {{tests on the}} DC-4 fuel system. The tests showed that when an engine boost pump was operating, a vortex in the engine fuel tank prevented water from entering the engine. The tests also showed that when the boost pump was turned off, any water would soon <b>find</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> into the engine. The Department of Civil Aviation believed this might explain why all engines were operating normally during the takeoff {{but at least one}} engine began to run roughly around the time the engine boost pumps would be turned off. However, Justice Simpson stated that the re-opened Inquiry served only to confirm his view that the Amana's loss of power was not due to water in the fuel.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, Ventus is the {{apprentice}} of Master Xehanort, who trains him to complete the legendary χ-blade. However, due to Ventus' reluctance to use darkness, Xehanort extracted it from his heart, resulting in the creation of Vanitas, but also leaving his heart incomplete and on the verge of collapse. Xehanort brings Ventus to Destiny Islands, where his heart merges with that of the newborn Sora to keep it safe. Having lost his memories, Ventus is placed in the care of Master Eraqus as his youngest Keyblade apprentice alongside Terra and Aqua. At the game's beginning, Vanitas taunts Ventus into following Terra who sets out to find Xehanort. Ventus travels through various worlds, fighting mysterious creatures called the Unversed and meeting various people. Vanitas attacks Ventus during his journey to test his strength, but he is defeated when Keyblade apprentice Mickey aids Ventus. Upon meeting Xehanort, Ventus is forced to remember his purpose as being used to create the χ-blade. Ventus refuses to battle Vanitas and create it, but is forced to after Vanitas threatens to kill Terra and Aqua if he does refuse. They battle within the Keyblade Graveyard, where Vanitas merges with Ventus and obtains the χ-blade. However, the fusion is incomplete, which allows Ventus to destroy Vanitas within his heart and Aqua to destroy the χ-blade. As a result, Ventus loses his heart and his body is placed within Castle Oblivion by Aqua until he awakens. Ventus' wandering heart is able to <b>find</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> back to the young Sora, who accepts Ventus' heart into his body. In the game's secret ending, he is seen in the Land of Departure with Terra, and the two utter Sora's name with newfound hope.|$|E

25|$|While pheromones {{explain the}} pharaoh ant's {{remarkable}} foraging ability, each forager’s uncanny capability to <b>find</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> {{back to the}} nest requires a different explanation. In fact, the pharaoh ant relies on geometry to show it the way home. Each fork in the trail system spreads at an angle between 50 and 60 degrees. When returning to the nest, a forager that encounters a fork will almost always take the path that deviates less from its current direction. In other words, it will never choose an acute angle that would drastically change its direction. Using this algorithm, each forager is able to <b>find</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> back to the nest. If the fork angle is experimentally increased to an angle between 60 and 120 degrees, M. pharaonis foragers were significantly less able to find their nest. This method of decision-making reduces the wasted energy that would result from traveling {{in the wrong direction}} and contributes to the pharaoh ant's efficiency in foraging.|$|E
