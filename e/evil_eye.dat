5|$|Many motifs {{are used}} in {{traditional}} kilims, handmade flat-woven rugs, each with many variations. In Turkish Anatolia in particular, village women wove themes significant for their lives into their rugs, whether before marriage or during married life. Some motifs represent desires, such as for happiness and children; others, for protection against threats such as wolves (to the flocks) and scorpions, or against the <b>evil</b> <b>eye.</b> These motifs were often combined when woven into patterns on kilims. With the fading of tribal and village cultures in the 20th century, the meaning of kilim patterns has faded also.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle finger}} gesture {{was used in}} Ancient times {{as a symbol of}} sexual intercourse, in a manner meant to degrade, intimidate and {{threaten}} the individual receiving the gesture. It also represented the phallus, with the fingers next to the middle finger representing testicles; from its close association, the gesture may have assumed apotropaic potency. In the 1st-century Mediterranean world, extending the finger was one of many methods used to divert the ever-present threat of the <b>evil</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gauze is {{reputed to}} have {{originated}} in Gaza. Cloth for the Gaza thob was often woven at nearby Majdal (Ascalon). Black or blue cottons or striped pink and green fabric {{that had been}} made in Majdal continued to be woven throughout the Gaza Strip by refugees from the coastal plain villages until the 1960s. Thobs here had narrow, tight, straight sleeves. Embroidery was much less dense than that applied in Hebron. The most popular motifs included: scissors (muqass), combs (mushut) and triangles (hijab) often arranged in clusters of fives, sevens and threes, as the use of odd numbers is considered in Arab folklore to be effective against the <b>evil</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E

5|$|M64 (NGC 4826) {{is known}} as the Black Eye Galaxy because of the {{prominent}} dark dust lane in front of the galaxy's bright nucleus. Also known as the Sleeping Beauty and <b>Evil</b> <b>Eye</b> galaxy, it is about 24 million light-years away. Recent studies indicate that the interstellar gas in the galaxy's outer regions rotates in the opposite direction from that in the inner regions, leading astronomers to believe that at least one satellite galaxy collided with it less than a billion years ago. All other evidence of the smaller galaxy has been assimilated. At the interface between the clockwise- and counterclockwise-rotating regions are many new nebulae and young stars.|$|E

The film opened in France on 17 November 1965 under the title Les trois visages de la peur.|$|E

25|$|Another {{similarity}} between the Silmarillion and the Lebor Gabála Érenn {{can be seen by}} comparing Nuada and Lugh (who possessed a famed magic spear, the Spear Luin) and the outcome of their respective confrontations against Balor of the <b>Evil</b> <b>Eye</b> with the events surrounding Celebrimbor and Gil-galad (whose weapon is the spear Aeglos) and their conflicts with Sauron of the Lidless Red Eye in the Second Age.|$|E
25|$|The {{authorities}} of the Talmud {{seem to be}} particularly influenced by popular conception {{in the direction of}} folk medicine. A belief in the <b>Evil</b> <b>eye</b> was also prevalent in Talmudic times, and occasionally omens were taken seriously, though in some cases recognized as being merely popular beliefs. Thus, while it is declared to be unlucky to do things twice, as eating, drinking, or washing, Rabbi Dunai recognized that this was an old tradition.|$|E

25|$|Since 1980 {{underwater}} {{surveys have}} also been {{taking place in the}} harbor. These have revealed shipwrecks, anchors and fishing devices, all suggestive of intense maritime activity from the Bronze Age to modern times. In 2008, a lifeguard diving at the site found an Ophthalmos, a 4th or 5th century BCE marble discus measuring 20cm in diameter. Resembling an eye, these adorned the bow of ancient ships and were supposed to protect the ships from the <b>evil</b> <b>eye,</b> envy and danger, while also assisting navigation.|$|E
