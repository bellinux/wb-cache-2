5|$|Then {{the autumn}} of 1646, Wiśniowiecki invaded and took over the starostwo kaniowskie vacated {{recently}} by banished Samuel Łaszcz. He did so without any legal justifications, which caused a court ruling against him; a ruling that was however never enforced. Later that year, he raised a large private army of about 25,000 <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>purpose</b> unknown, as noted by Widacki, who writes that the army, which Jeremi raised with an immense cost for a short time, {{did not participate in}} any engagement, nor did it have any clear purpose. He notes that such an army might have been useful in provoking the Ottomans, but as Jeremi was opposed to the war with them up to the point of refusing the hetman office, his actions are puzzling even for the modern historians.|$|E

5|$|There is {{a general}} rule that a {{landlord}} who leases a property is not liable for nuisances created after the occupier takes control of the land.

The landlord is also liable were the nuisance existed before the land was let, and he knew or ought to have known about it. Under the principle of vicarious liability, an occupier of land can also be liable {{for the actions of}} their employees; in Matania v National Provincial Bank, it was also established that they could be liable for the activities of independent contractors under certain circumstances.|$|E

25|$|A {{purpose trust}} in English {{law is a}} trust created for the {{fulfillment}} of a purpose, not {{for the benefit of}} a person. These are normally considered invalid by the courts because they have no legally recognized beneficiaries, therefore nobody to enforce the trust, with the exception of charitable trusts, which are enforceable by Attorney General as they represent public interest. As well as charitable trusts, there are several exceptions to the rules against purpose trusts. If the requirement to fulfill a purpose is a request, rather than an obligation, the trust is valid; a trust will also be found valid if, while being <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>purpose,</b> it involves beneficiaries in some respect. Purpose trusts can also be valid if they are for the erection or maintenance of tombs and memorials (assuming such memorials are not overly grandiose), the maintenance of animals, and arguably the saying of masses, although these must all obey the rule against perpetuities and not continue for more than 21 years after the testator's death.|$|E
25|$|In Singapore, a broad {{approach}} has been taken towards the determination of whether a decision-maker has exercised its power for an improper purpose. In Public Prosecutor v. Pillay M.M. (1977), the respondent was charged for having driven his car into a restricted zone established under the Singapore Area Licensing Scheme without having paid the requisite fee for doing so, contrary to the Motor Vehicles (Restricted Zone and Area Licences) Rules 1975 which had been issued by the Minister for Communications pursuant to the Road Traffic Act. The respondent argued that the Rules were invalid as the Act only empowered the Minister to make rules to regulate road traffic, and not to collect fees. The High Court held that the Minister had not exceeded the statutory power given {{to him as the}} main purpose of the rules he had imposed was consistent with the objective of the Act, that is, to regulate traffic on the roads. Collecting fees from drivers entering the restricted zone was merely incidental to this purpose. Hence, in Singapore it appears that a decision-maker does not act unlawfully if it exercises a statutory power <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>purpose</b> that is incidental to the legislative purpose.|$|E
25|$|Every {{municipality}} {{is required}} to maintain a publicly accessible zoning map indicating what parcels of property within the municipality {{may be used for}} what purpose. This map must be updated at least every five years. Every municipality is required by state law to have a zoning administrator who oversees the local government's regulatory scheme, and is generally the party responsible for bringing legal actions against zoning violators. Each municipality is also required to have a board of zoning appeals empowered to grant variances and settle boundary disputes. The standard for granting of variances is that the party requesting the variance faces an unnecessary hardship unique to that party, but that adjacent property will not suffer a substantial detriment, and the character of the district will not be changed. The board may also grant special use permits allowing a property owner to use a property <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>purpose</b> that is neither specifically permitted nor specifically prohibited within a particular zoning area, and such permits may be conditioned on the property owner making concessions such as improving roads leading into the property, providing street lighting in the area, or setting aside a certain amount of land for public use. The board of zoning appeals may be appealed to the local Circuit Court if such an appeal is filed within 30 days of the zoning board decision, and from there decisions may be appealed directly to the Virginia Supreme Court.|$|E

500|$|Several {{philosophers}} of {{the classical}} era, including Empedocles and his intellectual successor, the Roman poet Lucretius, expressed the idea that nature produces a huge variety of creatures, randomly, and that only those creatures that manage to provide for themselves and reproduce successfully persist. Empedocles' idea that organisms arose entirely by the incidental workings of causes such as heat and cold was criticised by Aristotle in Book II of Physics. He posited natural teleology in its place, and believed that form was achieved <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>purpose,</b> citing the regularity of heredity in species as proof. Nevertheless, he accepted in his biology that new types of animals, monstrosities (τερας), can occur in very rare instances (Generation of Animals, Book IV). As quoted in Darwin's 1872 edition of The Origin of Species, Aristotle considered whether different forms (e.g., of teeth) might have appeared accidentally, but only the useful forms survived: ...|$|E

[...] Trymon dispatches a group of mercenaries, led by Herrena, to capture Rincewind and retrieve the eighth spell, along with a force of wizards. Meanwhile, Rincewind and Twoflower encounter Cohen the Barbarian (87 years old and retired), and Twoflower rescues Bethan, a human sacrifice in a druid ritual. A battle between the wizards and Rincewind leaves Twoflower in a coma; Rincewind rescues him from Death's door, and Cohen in turn rescues Rincewind and Twoflower from Herrena and the mercenaries.|$|E
500|$|The third main {{theory is}} that Quistclose trusts could be {{constructive}} trusts, which are created when the future trustee uses the money in an [...] "unconscionable" [...] manner. In Quistclose situations, the requirement of [...] "unconscionableness" [...] could be met by the borrower using the money <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>purpose</b> {{other than the one}} for which it was lent, allowing the lender to claim an equitable interest in it. In Carreras Rothmans Ltd v Freeman Mathews Treasure Ltd, the Quistclose trust principle was said by Peter Gibson J. to be that [...] "equity fastens on the conscience of the person who receives from another property transferred for a specific purpose only and not therefore for the recipient's [...] own purposes, so that such person will not be permitted to treat the property as his own or to use it for other than the stated purpose"; this reference to [...] "conscience" [...] could make Quistclose trusts constructive in nature. However, no constructive trust could be created until the money is misused, which may be too late for an effective remedy.|$|E
