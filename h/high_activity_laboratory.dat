40|$|Previous {{work has}} shown that the type of clay mineral, the valency state of adsorbed cations and the salt {{concentration}} of pore-water influences the residual strength of clays. Residual strength can therefore be modified through weathering reactions, clay mineral alterations and fluctuations in groundwater chemistry. This has implications for studies of the seasonal and long-term behaviour of clay slopes. The paper presents results from an investigation of a shallow coastal mudslide on the south coast of England which attempts to isolate the influence of physico-chemical processes on mudslide behaviour. Fluctuations in groundwater chemistry coincided with temporal movement patterns. Low pore-water ion concentrations were apparent immediately before seasonal mudslide reactivation or periods of <b>high</b> <b>activity.</b> <b>Laboratory</b> tests showed that low pore-water ion concentrations resulted in low residual shear strength; higher concentrations observed after movement events led to increases in residual strength...|$|E

Although the photocatalytic material showed reasonably <b>high</b> <b>activity</b> in <b>laboratory</b> studies, no significant reduction of NOx, O 3, and VOCs and no impact on particle mass, size distribution, and chemical composition were observed in the field campaign. When comparing nighttime and daytime correlation plots of the two canyons, an average upper limit NOx remediation of ≤ 2 % was derived. This result is consistent only with three recent field studies on photocatalytic NOx remediation in the urban atmosphere, whereas much higher reductions were obtained in most other field investigations. Reasons for the controversial results are discussed, and a more consistent picture of the quantitative remediation is obtained after extrapolation of {{the results from the}} various field campaigns to realistic main urban street canyon conditions...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Commercial {{bioethanol}} {{is currently}} obtained from starchy substrates, {{with a relatively}} mature technology for corn in the USA. However, starch-to-ethanol processes are still expensive {{and the development of}} a Consolidated Bioprocessing (CBP) through amylolytic yeast could considerably reduce commercial costs (van Zyl et al. 2012). This research project aimed to construct efficient amylolytic CBP Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains for the industrial ethanol production from starchy feedstock. Materials and methods. In the last eight years, ten fungal glucoamylase and alpha-amylase genes, native and codon-optimized, were screened in different combinations for their <b>high</b> <b>activity</b> into the <b>laboratory</b> strain S. cerevisiae Y 294. The most proficient sequences were δ-integrated into industrial yeast strains (van Zyl et al. 2011; Favaro et al., 2012; Favaro et al. 2015). Results. This report gives an overview of the research outcomes we obtained towards the CBP of starchy materials into ethanol. So far, the most effective raw starch-hydrolyzing combination was found to be the codon-optimized glucoamylase of Thermomyces lanuginosus glucoamylase (TLG 1) and α-amylase of Saccharomycopsis fibuligera (SFA 1) and their gene were δ-integrated into the industrial S. cerevisiae strains M 2 n and MEL 2.

40|$|The {{glycerol}} hydrogenolysis {{reaction was}} performed in a continuous flow trickle bed reactor using a water glycerol feed and both copper chromite and Cu/Al 2 O 3 catalysts. The commercial copper chromite had a <b>higher</b> <b>activity</b> than the <b>laboratory</b> prepared Cu/Al 2 O 3 and was used {{for most of the}} tests. Propylene glycol was the main product with both catalysts, acetol being the main by-product. It was found that temperature is the main variable influencing the conversion of glycerol. When the state of the glycerol-water reactant mixture was completely liquid, at temperatures lower than 190 ºC, conversion was low and deactivation was observed. At reaction temperatures of 210 - 230 ºC the conversion of glycerol was complete and the selectivity to propylene glycol was stable at about 60 - 80 % all throughout the reaction time span of 10 h, regardless of the hydrogen pressure level (1 to 20 atm). These optimal values could not be improved significantly by using other different reaction conditions or increasing the catalyst acidity. At higher temperatures (245 - 250 ºC) the conversion was also 100 %. Under reaction conditions at which copper chromite suffered deactivation, light by-products and surface deposits were formed. The deposits could be completely burned at 250 ºC and the catalyst activity fully recovered...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a study undertaken to transform existing hands-on <b>laboratory</b> <b>activities</b> into superpracs suitable for marketing to Year 10 to Year 12 students. A survey of global practice in marketing activities identified the best practicals, which were developed into &# 039;superpracs&# 039; to appeal more to {{both boys and}} girls and present engineering careers as interesting and exciting. Engineering {{is one of the most}} male-dominated professions in the western world. Many factors contribute to low numbers of women in STEM, including perceptions of self-efficacy and cultural stereotypes. In a study of US Women in Engineering programs the best programs focused on cultural change in the faculty, while the worst focused on interventions directed at helping girls to cope. Each prac should contain the following elements to appeal to {{both boys and girls}}. &# 039;Boy appeal&# 039; is enhanced with &# 039;smash and crash&# 039;, reference to media shows, and mastery appeal. &# 039;Girl appeal&# 039; is enhanced by relating the activities to people and society, group interaction, and relating the concepts to the human body (where possible). Existing <b>high</b> quality <b>laboratory</b> <b>activities</b> were then redeveloped into &# 039;superpracs&# 039;.

40|$|The large pine weevil, Hylobius abietis L., {{is a major}} {{insect pest}} on conifer {{seedlings}} in northern Europe. Due to its feeding newly planted trees get girdled, resulting in high seedling mortality (up to 80 %). As a consequence great financial losses to the forest industry occur. Today the seedlings are protected with the pyrethroid insecticide cypermethrin. This insecticide is toxic to aquatic organisms and is, from 2010, prohibited for use in Sweden by the Swedish Chemicals Inspectorate. An alternative to insecticides {{is to protect the}} seedlings with antifeedants, compounds that, either through taste or smell or both, deter the weevils from feeding. This thesis describes the search for and the synthesis of such antifeedant compounds. Bark extracts of several woody species, known to be non-palatable to the weevil, were prepared and found to display antifeedant activity against H. abietis. The major chemical constituents of the extracts were tested for antifeedant activity. Antifeedants such as eugenol, 2 -phenylethanol and benzylalcohol, but also feeding stimulants such as β-sitosterol and linoleic acid, were identified. An extract of linden bark, Tilia cordata, was shown to contain nonanoic acid, a highly active antifeedant. Other aliphatic carboxylic acids were also found to display <b>high</b> antifeedant <b>activities</b> against the weevil, both in laboratory and in field tests. The enantiomers of dihydropinidine, a piperidine alkaloid present in several conifer species, were prepared by dimethylzinc mediated allylation of 2 - methyltetrahydropyridine-N-oxide. When tested in micro feeding assays, no difference in antifeedant activity was found for the enantiomers. In a field test <b>high</b> antifeedant <b>activity,</b> comparable with that of the presently used insecticide cypermethrin, was found for (±) -dihydropindine. Other naturally occurring piperidine alkaloids were synthesised and also found to display <b>high</b> antifeedant <b>activities</b> in <b>laboratory</b> tests. Structure-activity relationships were evaluated for methoxy substituted benzaldehydes, benzoic acids and cinnamic aldehydes, -acids, -esters and -alcohols.
