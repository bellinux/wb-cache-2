2500|$|The 80-bit {{floating}} point format was widely available by 1984, after {{the development of}} C, Fortran and similar computer languages, which initially offered only the common 32- and 64-bit {{floating point}} sizes. On the x86 design most C compilers now support 80-bit extended precision via the long double type, and this was specified in the C99 / C11 standards (IEC 60559 floating-point arithmetic (Annex F)). [...] Compilers on x86 for other languages often support extended precision as well, sometimes via nonstandard extensions: for example, Turbo Pascal offers an <b>extended</b> <b>type,</b> and several Fortran compilers have a REAL*10 type (analogous to REAL*4 and REAL*8). [...] Such compilers also typically include extended-precision mathematical subroutines, such as square root and trigonometric functions, in their standard libraries.|$|E

Further research by Chew and others have produced modifications of the spiral array model, and, applied it to various problems in music theory and practice, such as key finding (symbolic and audio), pitch spelling, tonal segmentation, similarity assessment, and musical humor. The extensions and applications are described in Mathematical and Computational Modeling of Tonality: Theory and Applications.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. For A|F {{a central}} simple algebra over a p-adic local field {{the group of}} units A × ∼ = GLm(Dd) is a general linear group over a central {{division}} algebra Dd|F of index d. The product n = dm being fixed, the Abstract Matching Theorem (AMT) implies the existence of bijective maps JL between the sets of discrete series representations of the groups A × such that a character relation is preserved. In this paper we construct maximal level zero <b>extended</b> <b>type</b> components for every level zero discrete series representation of A×. Its maximal level zero <b>extended</b> <b>type</b> determines the discrete series representation uniquely (without any twist ambiguities as for the usual types) and, conversely, every level zero discrete series representation Π contains a maximal level zero <b>extended</b> <b>type</b> component Σ̃(Π) which is unique up to conjugacy. In order to determine how JL matches the extended types we find certain regular elliptic elements where the characters of Σ̃(Π) and Π are the same and we compute the character values at these elements by using a version of Shintani descent which we develop in Appendix B. Surprisingly, we find that AMT also implies explicit Shintani descent for irreducible characters of finite general linear groups which have cuspida...|$|E
