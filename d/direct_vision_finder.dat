5000|$|The Robot II took square {{photographs}} in the 24×24mm format, which allowed 50 exposures to fit on a 36-exposure film. It featured an all-metal Rotor shutter (1/4 to 1/500), a <b>direct</b> <b>vision</b> <b>finder,</b> and a screw mount for interchangeable lenses by Schneider. The standard lens is a Schneider Xenon 40 mm f1.9.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{function}} of the collapsible finder hood is to shield the focusing screen from outside stray light, but by lowering the hinged magnifying glass into the finder for critical focusing, it also becomes a <b>direct</b> <b>vision</b> frame <b>finder.</b> By looking into the rectangular opening {{at the back of}} the hood, it provides the field of view of a 50mm lens, a useful feature since the focusing screen image is laterally reversed, which makes it less useful as an action finder. Pushing a small notch to the side at the lover right on the rear finder hood panel, flips the lowered magnifying glass up and away. The finder panels are stowed away one by one, sides first, and covered by the front lid, which is held down by a hook at the back. The hook is furnished with a release button to erect the hood. A small sector lever close to the shutter dial, with R and V engraved next to it in the top plate, controls the film transportation, R for rewind and V for advance, for Rückwärts and Vorwärts in German. A knob on the left-hand edge of the body slides downwards to release the back, which is not hinged, only hooked onto the right-hand edge just before closing by a firm pressure on the left-hand back.|$|R

Methodology The root ends of 52 root filled canine teeth were filled with MTA or Sealer 26 under <b>direct</b> <b>vision</b> or optical microscope (n = 13). In each group, eight specimens were analysed by profilometry for measurement of the area and depth of gaps. In the other five specimens, gap area was measured using SEM to verify marginal adaptation and surface characteristic. Data were analysed by parametric (anova and Tukey) and non-parametric (Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn) tests. Results The assessment of the adaptation of both materials to dentine was not influenced by the mode of visualization, which was confirmed by both profilometry and SEM observations. The voids measured with profilometry for Sealer 26 under <b>direct</b> <b>vision</b> were significantly wider and deeper than those for MTA under <b>direct</b> <b>vision</b> (P < 0. 05). In SEM, significantly larger gap areas were observed with Sealer 26 (P < 0. 05). Conclusion Root-end cavities filled with MTA had smaller gaps and better marginal adaptation than Sealer 26...|$|R

40|$|This {{briefing}} summarises a {{study by}} a research team from the Design School at Loughborough University for Transport for London (TfL) and Transport & Environment (T&E) on how lorry <b>direct</b> <b>vision</b> could be improved. Previous {{research has shown that}} existing Category N 3 vehicle designs exhibit considerable <b>direct</b> <b>vision</b> blind spots in front of and to the near (passenger) side of the vehicle. This research explores the potential to reduce these blind spots through changes to vehicle geometry made possible by the proposed increase to vehicle length. Using a concept vehicle designed in a project performed by FKA this research evaluates the <b>direct</b> <b>vision</b> afforded to the driver against a baseline DAF XF 105 and a range of iterations of the FKA concept to explore improvements to vision. The analyses are performed using a 3 D projection technique in the SAMMIE digital human modelling system. This allows the vehicle concepts to be populated with representative drivers and visual targets including vulnerable road users in the form of pedestrians and cyclists and a typical Category M 1 vehicle (a passenger car). The analysis has shown that these blind spots can be improved for the specific tests that have been performed in this research by the FKA concept and the iterations of the concept that have been produced by the LDS team. When compared to the baseline vehicle the original FKA concept improves <b>direct</b> <b>vision</b> to vulnerable road users located at the centre of the vehicle front as the extended front effectively pushes the visual targets further away {{from the front of the}} vehicle allowing them to be seen. The visibility to the two front corners of the FKA concept and the lateral visibility through the driver and passenger doors remain problematic. The first iteration of the FKA concept reduces obscuration through the design of a compact instrument panel similar to those used in bus and coach designs. This iteration also improves <b>direct</b> <b>vision</b> to the near side and front nearside corner of the vehicle through the use of additional glazed areas. The visibility of the offside front corner is still problematic. The second iteration of the FKA concept is a modified version of the first iteration with a reduction in the cab height of the vehicle by 230 mm. This results in the most successful concept analysed, with good <b>direct</b> <b>vision</b> of all of the visual targets that have been defined in the research project. This reduction in height is possible with current vehicles but would result in a vehicle with reduced off road capabilities due to a reduction in ground clearance. The third iteration of the FKA concept explored the potential of a central driving position. This provides advantages to <b>direct</b> <b>vision</b> through improved lateral visibility at the original height of the concept vehicle. However, this iteration also introduces new <b>direct</b> <b>vision</b> issues. The project has shown that the potential to extend the front of category N 3 vehicles to include aerodynamic features has some benefit in terms of improved <b>direct</b> <b>vision</b> for the design that has been analysed, but that more radical design solutions, such as lowering the vehicle cab, and adding glazed areas to the doors and below the windscreen bottom edge provide more effective solutions to the <b>direct</b> <b>vision</b> problem...|$|R

The current work investigated <b>direct</b> <b>vision</b> as a strategy for optical seam teaching and tracking. A robotic vision system has been implemented, consisting of an articulated robot, a hand mounted camera and a control computer.

30|$|Three ports {{were used}} for {{carrying}} out the procedure, of which one was 10  mm and two were 5  mm. The 10 -mm port was an umbilical camera port, and the two 5  mm were working ports. A Hasson entry was performed, and a 10 -mm umbilical port was introduced. Carbon dioxide was insufflated to a pressure of 20  mmHg and then lowered to 15  mmHg when all trocars were in the abdominal cavity. Two 5 -mm lateral pyramidal-tipped trocars were inserted on each lower abdominal quadrant outside the rectus sheath under <b>direct</b> <b>vision.</b> Insertion of all ports was obtained at first attempt, with one trocar pass for each port, and no stretching of port sites {{took place during the}} procedure. The cyst was dissected using a laparoscopic grasper and retrieved in an endobag via the 10 -mm umbilical port under <b>direct</b> <b>vision</b> from the right lateral port. The procedure was uncomplicated; hemostasis was achieved with bipolar diathermy. The lateral ports were removed under <b>direct</b> <b>vision,</b> and the CO 2 was expelled through the ports. The umbilical port was removed after complete evacuation of CO 2. The umbilical rectus sheath was closed with vicryl 1.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The {{aim of the}} study was to {{understand}} the nature of blindspots in the vision of drivers of trucks caused by vehicle design variables such as cab design. The paper is the second of two submitted to ICED 17. This paper focuses upon the results for the quantification of blindspots and the first paper presents the methodology (Marshall & Summerskill, 2017). In order to establish the cause and nature of blind spots 19 top selling trucks were scanned and imported into the SAMMIE DHM system. A CAD based vision projection technique allowed multiple mirror and window aperture projections to be created. By determining where simulated VRUs could be positioned without being visible in the <b>direct</b> <b>vision</b> of a driver, the vehicles were compared. By comparing the drivers eye height and the obscuration distance of VRUs a correlation was identified. By exploring the design features of outliers in this correlation, it was determined that <b>direct</b> <b>vision</b> blind spots are affected by various design variables. This led to the definition of a requirement for a <b>direct</b> <b>vision</b> standard for trucks, with a standard now being defined by the authors in a project funded by Transport for London...|$|R
