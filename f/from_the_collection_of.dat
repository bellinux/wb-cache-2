5|$|The book {{accompanied}} {{an exhibition}} of 60 lynching postcards from 1880 to 1960, Witness: Photographs of Lynchings <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Collection</b> <b>of</b> James Allen, which opened at the Roth Horowitz Gallery in New York in January 2000. Allen argued that lynching photographers were more than passive spectators.

5|$|Perhaps {{the best}} known nativity scene in America is the Neapolitan Baroque Crèche {{displayed}} annually in the Medieval Sculpture Hall of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Its backdrop is a 1763 choir screen from the Cathedral of Valladolid and a twenty-foot blue spruce decorated {{with a host of}} 18th-century angels. The nativity figures are placed at the tree's base. The crèche was the gift of Loretta Hines Howard in 1964, and the choir screen was the gift of The William Randolph Hearst Foundation in 1956. Both this presepio and the one displayed in Pittsburgh originated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> Eugenio Catello.|$|E
5|$|The Molyneux globes at the Hessisches Landesmuseum, Kassel, were {{inherited}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> William IV (William the Wise), the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel), {{a pioneer}} of astronomical research. William himself died in 1592, so it has been surmised that his son and successor, Maurice, purchased the globes for the collection. They were first mentioned in 1765 in the index of the Mathematische Kammer (Mathematics Chamber) of the Fürstliches Kunsthaus (Princely Art Gallery) in Kassel, {{during the reign of}} Landgrave Frederick III. Only a celestial globe survives today; it is believed that the terrestrial globe was destroyed during World War II.|$|E

5|$|The {{acceptance}} of the relics required the intercession of Pope Leo XIII, after an initial refusal by the church in France. Upon their arrival in England, they were housed in the Fitzalan Chapel at Arundel Castle, prior to their translation to Westminster. Although the relics had been verified and catalogued in 1644 for interment in the new shrine and in 1874 when two pieces were given to Cardinal Manning, concerns were raised about their validity by Dr. Montague James and Dr Charles Biggs in The Times. They remained at Arundel {{under the care of}} the Duke of Norfolk, whilst a historical commission was set up by Cardinal Vaughan and Archbishop Germain of Saint-Sernin. They remain to this day at Arundel. In 1966, three teeth <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> relics from France were donated to Douai Abbey.|$|E
