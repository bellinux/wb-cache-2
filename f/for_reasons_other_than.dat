25|$|The {{fields of}} {{medicine}} (particularly veterinary) and zoology often distinguish a poison from a toxin, {{and from a}} venom. Toxins are poisons produced by organisms in nature, and venoms are toxins injected by a bite or sting (this is exclusive to animals). The difference between venom and other poisons is the delivery method. Industry, agriculture, and other sectors use poisons <b>for</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> their toxicity. Pesticides are one group of substances whose toxicity to various insects and other animals deemed to be pests (e.g., rats and cockroaches) is their prime purpose.|$|E
25|$|Vocabulary, {{sentence}} structure, {{employment of}} idioms and common phrases, etc. are analyzed for consistency with the author’s other known works. A similar style implies common authorship, while a radically divergent vocabulary implies different authors. For example, E. J.

Percy argued that the speech and style of Colossians more strongly resembled Pauline authorship than not. Of course, style and language can vary <b>for</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> differing authorship, such as the subject of the letter, the recipient, the circumstances of the times, or simply maturation {{on the part of the}} author.|$|E

25|$|Women {{may also}} express {{a desire to}} undergo an {{elective}} hysterectomy <b>for</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> the resolution of reproductive system conditions or illnesses. Some of {{the conditions under which}} a person may request to have a hysterectomy (or have one requested for her if the woman is incapable of making the request) for non-illness reasons include may be as prophylaxis against certain reproductive system cancers, especially if there is a strong family history of reproductive system cancers (especially breast cancer in conjunction with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation), or as part of recovery from such cancers. Some with severe developmental disabilities have had hysterectomies though this treatment is controversial at best. In the United States, specific cases of sterilization due to developmental disabilities have been found by state-level Supreme Courts to violate the patient's constitutional and common law rights.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s {{there were}} no notable tenure battles, but three were {{outstanding}} in the 1990s. In 1995, the Florida Board of Regents tried to re-evaluate academic tenure, but managed only to institute a weak, post-tenure performance review. Likewise, in 1996 the Arizona Board of Regents attempted to re-evaluate tenure, fearing that few full-time professors actually taught university undergraduate students, mainly because the processes of achieving academic tenure underweighted teaching. However, faculty and administrators defended themselves {{and the board of}} trustees dropped its review. Finally, the University of Minnesota Regents tried from 1995 to 1996 to enact 13 proposals, including these policy changes: to allow the regents to cut faculty base- salaries <b>for</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> a university financial emergency including poor performance; to fire tenured professors when their programs were eliminated or restructured if the university were unable to retrain or reassign them. In the Minnesota system, 87 percent of university faculty were either tenured or on the tenure track, and the professors vehemently defended themselves. Eventually, the president of the system opposed these changes and weakened a compromise plan by the dean of the law school before it then failed. The board chairman resigned later that year.|$|E
25|$|In 1975, {{in one of}} {{the most}} memorable grand finals ever, the Arthur Beetson captained, Jack Gibson coached Eastern Suburbs Roosters, {{defeated}} St. George 38–0 to win the premiership. That Roosters team is considered one of the best sides ever assembled and the eight tries to nil scoreline remained a record winning margin in a grand final until the 2008 NRL Grand Final played between Manly Warringah and the Melbourne Storm, Manly winning by the tune of 40–0. However, the game was famous <b>for</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> the scoreline. St George's Captain-coach Graeme Langlands played with a misdirected pain killing injection that made his right leg go numb and prevented him from playing anywhere near his best. Easts were without two of their stars, rookie fullback Russell Fairfax and centre Mark Harris, and coach Jack Gibson gambled on an unknown player to help fill the void – John Rheinberger – who played in his first only first grade game in the Grand Final. Leading by only 5–0 at half-time, the Roosters scored an avalanche of tries after the interval to humiliate the Dragons. Earlier in the same season, the Roosters recorded the longest winning streak of any first grade rugby league football club – 19 matches. It was the Eastern Suburbs Roosters' eleventh premiership victory and their second in succession.|$|E
