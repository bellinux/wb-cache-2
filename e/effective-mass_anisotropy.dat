40|$|The quantum {{confinement}} for a conduction-band electron within a spherical quantum dot is investigated {{in the framework}} of the effective-mass approximation. The conduction-band <b>effective-mass</b> <b>anisotropy</b> is fully taken into account. The exact solution for the electronic spectrum is provided, showing how the 'isotropic' mass levels map into the new spectrum which accounts for the anisotropy. The removal of degeneracies typical of the spherical dot, as well as its effects on the infrared transition energies, are discussed...|$|E
40|$|DC-electric field, being {{screened}} in 3 D semiconductors, normally decays monotonically in space. Experimental {{studies of}} the DC electric field screening in Si-SiO$_ 2 $ multiple quantum wells by electric field induced optical second-harmonic generation show a non-monotonic, oscillatory-like decay. The model of electrons localized inside quantum wells, with the first subband occupied, allows {{a description of the}} phenomenon. Interwell Coulomb interaction, a finite value of the electron charge and strong <b>effective-mass</b> <b>anisotropy</b> result in a crucial difference from 3 D Fermi liquid.

40|$|The 10 -micron intersubband {{absorption}} {{in quantum}} wells {{made of the}} silicon-based system, Si/Si(1 -x) Ge(x), has been calculated. The necessary details of the <b>effective-mass</b> <b>anisotropy</b> {{are included in the}} present analysis. It is found that it is readily possible to achieve an absorption constant of order of 10, 000 /cm in Si quantum wells with current doping technology. For 110 -line and 111 -line growth directions, a further advantage of Si quantum wells is pointed out, namely, an allowed absorption at normal incidence due to the anisotropic effective mass in Si...|$|E
40|$|We report {{measurements}} of the upper critical field H_c 2 as functions of temperature T, polar angle θ (of the field direction {{with respect to the}} crystallographic c axis), and azimuthal angle ϕ (of the field direction relative to the a axis within the ab plane) for the Cr-based superconductor K_ 2 Cr_ 3 As_ 3 with a quasi-one-dimensional and non-centrosymmetric crystal structure. We confirm that the anisotropy in H_c 2 (T) becomes inverse with decreasing temperature. At low temperatures, H_c 2 (θ) data are featured by two maxima at θ = 0 (H∥ c) and π/ 2 (H c), which can be quantitatively understood only if uniaxial <b>effective-mass</b> <b>anisotropy</b> and absence of Pauli paramagnetic effect for H c are taken simultaneously into consideration. The in-plane H_c 2 (ϕ) profile shows a unique threefold modulation especially at low temperatures. Overall, the characteristic of the H_c 2 (θ, ϕ, T) data mostly resemble those of the heavy-fermion superconductor UPt_ 3, and we argue in favor of a dominant spin-triplet superconductivity with odd parity in K_ 2 Cr_ 3 As_ 3.

40|$|Here, {{we present}} an {{electrical}} transport study in single crystals of LaFe 0. 92 Co 0. 08 AsO (Tc≃ 9. 1 K) under high magnetic fields. In contrast {{to most of}} the previously reported Fe based superconductors, and despite its relatively low Tc, LaFe 0. 92 Co 0. 08 AsO shows a superconducting anisotropy which is comparable to those seen, for instance, in the cuprates or γH=Hc 2 ab/Hc 2 c=mc/mab≃ 9, where mc/mab is the <b>effective-mass</b> <b>anisotropy,</b> although, in the present case and as in all Fe based superconductors, γ→ 1 asT→ 0. Under the application of an external field, we also observe a remarkable broadening of the superconducting transition particularly for fields applied along the interplanar direction. Both observations indicate that the low dimensionality of LaFe 1 −xCoxAsO is likely to lead to a more complex vortex phase diagram when compared to the other Fe arsenides and consequently, to a pronounced dissipation associated with the movement of vortices in a possible vortex liquid phase. When compared to, for instance, F-doped compounds pertaining to the same family, we obtain rather small activation energies for the motion of vortices. This suggests that the disorder introduced by doping LaFeAsO with F is more effective in pinning the vortices than alloying it with Co...|$|E
40|$|Vortex pinning is {{dramatically}} increased in anisotropic High‐Tc superconductors with nanosize inclusions, with relevant {{consequences for the}} applications. Special attention {{has been devoted to}} the effect of BaZrO 3 (BZO) nanoparticles and nanorods on pinning in YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 ‐x (YBCO), due to the interesting interactions of intrinsic (<b>effective‐mass)</b> <b>anisotropy,</b> directionality of nanorods, and elasticity of vortex matter. The interrelation between various sources of anisotropy has stimulated large interest. In this work we compare transport measurements taken in very different dynamic regimes. In particular, we use measurements of the anisotropic transport properties (dc critical current density Jc and 48 ‐GHz microwave complex resistivity) of driven vortex matter in YBCO with elongated strong‐pinning sites (c‐axis aligned, self‐assembled BZO nanorods, as revealed by TEM investigation) to demonstrate that the effective‐mass angular scaling (anisotropic Ginzburg‐Landau scaling) takes place only in intrinsic physical quantities (flux‐flow resistivity), and not in pinning‐ related Labusch parameter and critical currents. For the intrinsic part (effective‐mass scaling), we get the conventional 3 D, function with anisotropy = 5. However, for pinning‐related quantities (Labusch parameter, Jc) a nontrivial angular dependence is isolated. The comparison of the dynamics at different time scales shows evidence for a transition of the vortex matter toward a Mott phase, driven by the presence of nanorods. The strong pinning in dc arises partially from a dynamic effect, and this effect decreases when the magnetic field is tilted away from the alignment with the nanorods.   Interestingly, the dynamic effect survives up to a misalignment of 60 o.

40|$|Artificial pinning centers {{obtained}} as nanoinclusions of dielectric {{materials in}} YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -x (YBCO) films are {{of great interest}} in view of their great potential in applications such as coated conductors [1]. In particular, {{it has been observed}} [2] that BaZrO 3 (BZO) inclusions in films grown by Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) assemble in the form of nanorods, 30 - 150 nm long, of typical cross section comparable to the vortex core size. Thus, they are optimal candidates for effective vortex core pinning. Previous studies [2] have already shown that the BZO nanorods, oriented approximately along the c-axis, determine a significant increase of the pinning strength both at dc, in terms of the critical current density Jc and of the maximum pinning force Fp=JcB, and at microwaves, in terms of the pinning constant kp and of overall consequent reduction of dissipation levels. Despite the promising experimental results, the physics underlying the enhanced artificial pinning in anisotropic superconductors is still unsettled. In particular, the interplay between the <b>effective-mass</b> <b>anisotropy</b> of YBCO and the preferential direction given by the BZO-induced nanocolumns is still an open question. In this framework, we performed a combined study of the pinning properties of YBCO thin films with BZO nanorods through the two complementary probes, dc measurements of Jc and microwave measurements of the vortex parameters, including the flux flow resistivity ρff and the pinning constant kp. The very different dynamic regimes explored through the mentioned techniques allow to fruitfully investigate the interplay among the various sources of pinning and their different anisotropic properties. Indeed, the overall anisotropy of pinning is expected to arise from the competition between the mass anisotropy of YBCO, the preferential direction introduced by the extended BZO structures and the intrinsic pinning occurring in the YBCO layers. The samples under study are grown by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) from targets with BZO powders at 5...|$|E
