5|$|At {{the outset}} of the war, Frederick had one of the finest armies in Europe: his troops—any company—could fire at least four volleys a minute, and some of them could fire five. By the end of 1757, {{the course of the war}} had <b>gone</b> <b>well</b> for Prussia, and poorly for Austria. Prussia had {{achieved}} spectacular victories at Rossbach and Leuthen and reconquered parts of Silesia that had fallen to Austria.|$|E

5|$|According to legend, Skanderbeg {{celebrated the}} event by dining off letnica (Ohrid trout), a fish found in Lake Ohrid {{that was sent}} to the Byzantine {{emperors}} every Friday for their supper meal. The twelve captured officers were ransomed for 40,000 ducats. Skanderbeg distributed this amount through his force, with every man receiving his fair share. He then besieged Ohrid for a short time before returning to Albania; the Venetian Senate hailed the campaign as a victory despite not being able to take Ohrid. The crusade seemed to have <b>gone</b> <b>well</b> for the Christian side but, after Pius' death, the remaining cardinals lost their hope and handed the money raised for the crusade to the Venetians. Mehmed saw Skanderbeg's vulnerability and sent Ballaban Badera, an Albanian janissary, to Albania where they met at Vaikal and he was defeated. Ballaban had replaced Şeremet as the commander in Ohrid after the latter fell out of favor with the sultan. Ballaban would meet Skanderbeg several more times in battle before being mortally wounded in action at the second siege of Krujë.|$|E

25|$|Apart {{from a few}} {{isolated}} victories, the war had not <b>gone</b> <b>well</b> for Britain since 1754. In all theatres except India and North America (where Pitt's strategy had led {{to important}} gains in 1758) {{they were on the}} retreat. British agents received information about a planned French invasion which would knock Britain out of the war completely. While France starved their colonial forces of troops and supplies to concentrate them on the goal of total strategic supremacy in Europe, the British government agreed to continue their policy of shipping their own troops to fight for total victory in the colonies—leaving Britain to be guarded by the large militia that had existed since 1757.|$|E

On the 25th of February Charles de Heraugiere was to lead the covert assault in charge of sixty eight hand picked Dutch and English soldiers. They waited next {{to the mouth of}} the Mark river for the arrival of the boat of Adriaen van Bergen and accompanied captains Logier, Fervet and Lieutenant Matthew Held. That same day Maurice of Nassau, Francis Vere and Count Hohenlohe with 800 Dutch and 600 English soldiers with 300 of cavalry arrived at Willemstad, thirty kilometers from Breda.

25|$|Only one {{previous}} winner {{started in}} the 1987 Tour: Laurent Fignon, winner in 1983 and 1984. Since then, Fignon had struggled with his form, but in {{the first months of}} 1987, Fignon had finally shown some good results. LeMond's place as leader of the Toshiba team was now taken by Jean-François Bernard. He had finished in twelfth place in the previous year as helper of LeMond and Hinault, so more was expected from him now. The Carrera team was led by Stephen Roche. For Roche, the months before the 1987 Tour had <b>gone</b> <b>well,</b> having won the 1987 Giro d'Italia. In the recent Tours, Pedro Delgado had shown improving results, and he had some talented helpers in his PDM team, so he was also considered a contender.|$|E

However, things start to go downhill when Derek has a private word with Justin. Derek suggests Justin should move up to Doncaster to take over his garden centre business, oblivious to Justin's hints {{that he is not}} interested. Furthermore, Justin learns from Derek that the reason Derek and Dee fell out with Julie-Ann's two sisters was because {{one of them is a}} lesbian and the other married a Chinese man.|$|E

25|$|Small Heath were {{involved}} in two incidents during First Division matches that had lasting ramifications. After one of Everton's goals in a 4–4 draw in November 1894 was awarded despite having <b>gone</b> <b>well</b> wide, the referee believing it had passed {{through a hole in}} the netWilliam McGregor, former president of the League, suggested that it was the worst decision he had seen since goal-nets were introduced, and the scorer agreed that it was no goalthe League issued an instruction to referees to examine the nets before each match in the future. A year later, after their visit to Everton was abandoned after 37 minutes because of bad weather and the state of the pitch, a spectator took the host club to court claiming the return of his admission money. The case was decided in favour of the club, the judge ruling that the paying spectator is not entitled to a full 90 minutes' football, but only to that portion which can reasonably be completed within the rules of the game.|$|E
25|$|Despite the Jamaican 4 × 100 m {{relay team}} being the highest calibre one yet, {{practice}} for that event had not <b>gone</b> <b>well,</b> with Ottey repeatedly starting too early and not facilitating the change over with her teammates. The {{rest of the}} team felt Ottey overly focused on her individual events, {{to the detriment of the}} team event. Pusey also felt affronted by Ottey's demand to run the anchor leg of the relay (a position Pusey felt was her speciality) and the friction between the two athletes led to a last minute change. Allwood switched the middle legs with Pusey so she would not handover to Ottey, with Hodges remaining as starter. In the Olympic final, the team remained in contention until the final changeover, at which point Ottey again began too quickly, leading to a poor baton changeover. The team still ran a Jamaican national record of 43.19 seconds in sixth place, but Pusey felt her best chance of winning an Olympic medal was lost due to Ottey's mistake. Shortly after the Olympics, Pusey ran a personal best for the 200m in London, recording a time of 22.82 seconds.|$|E
25|$|In the Battle of Tourcoing on 18 May 1794, 82,000 French troops {{temporarily}} led by Joseph Souham defeated 74,000 Coalition soldiers under Prince Josias of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. With {{the divisions}} of Souham and Jean Victor Marie Moreau forming a salient at Menen (Menin) and Kortrijk (Courtrai), Karl Mack von Leiberich {{drew up a}} plan by which six Coalition columns would encircle them. François Sébastien Charles Joseph de Croix, Count of Clerfayt commanded 19,600 troops of the northern pincer. The southern pincer was formed by columns led by Georg Wilhelm von dem Bussche (4,000), Otto (10,000), the Duke of York (10,750), Franz Joseph, Count Kinsky (11,000) and Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen (18,000), going from north to south. If the French defenders were passive all would have <b>gone</b> <b>well,</b> but execution of Mack's plan demanded rapid movement according to a strict timetable. In the event, only York's and Otto's columns reached their prescribed jumping off points {{on the evening of}} 17 May. Clerfayt only crossed the Scheldt River early the next morning while Bussche was beaten and driven off. Kinsky pushed back Bonnaud's troops in his front but fell far behind schedule while Charles suffered an epileptic seizure, halting his progress. Pichegru was absent from his army so the French generals agreed to mount a counterattack under Souham's orders. While Moreau held off Clerfayt, Souham and Bonneau threw their 40,000 troops on the columns of York and Otto. As Souham's division pressed York and Otto from the north, Bonnaud's soldiers struck from the west, capturing ground behind York's column. By the afternoon of the 18th, Otto's men were forced back while York's troops barely cut {{their way out of the}} trap with a loss of 32 artillery pieces. After the defeat of the Coalition center, the columns of Clerfayt, Kinsky and Charles were ordered to retreat.|$|E

500|$|Three goals {{behind in}} the first 20minutes, Small Heath had fought back to level terms when a {{powerful}} shot from Everton's Alex Latta was given as a goal, despite having <b>gone</b> <b>well</b> wide, the referee believing it had passed {{through a hole in}} the net. William McGregor, former president of the League, suggested that it [...] "was the worst decision he had seen since the establishment of the goal-nets", and Latta himself agreed that the ball had gone wide.

Ferdinand evicted the French from Hanover and Westphalia and re-captured the port of Emden in March 1758; he crossed the Rhine, causing general alarm in France. Despite Ferdinand's victory over the French at the Battle of Krefeld and the brief occupation of Düsseldorf, successful maneuvering of larger French forces required him to withdraw across the Rhine.|$|E
