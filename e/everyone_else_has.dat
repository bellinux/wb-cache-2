5|$|The {{town has}} {{gathered}} {{to watch a}} performance of Meyerbeer's opera Les Huguenots and this is Ox's chosen occasion for his experiment. Things start slowly and then speed up and become chaotic as the experiment proceeds. The audience join in the performance. Uproar occurs. Frantz challenges Fritz to a duel for flirting with Suzel. Hermance is left alone when <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> left the theatre.She wonders what has happened. She is sure someone must pay.|$|E
5|$|Finally {{reaching}} Gruntilda's fortress at Cauldron Keep, Banjo and Kazooie {{confront the}} witch {{and her sisters}} in a trivia quiz show named the Tower of Tragedy Quiz in which losing competitors will be flattened under one-tonne weights. Mingella and Blobbelda lose to Banjo and Kazooie, getting crushed, but Gruntilda escapes. Banjo and Kazooie then reverse the effects of B.O.B., resurrecting both King Jingaling and Bottles, who celebrate at Bottles' house along with Klungo. Banjo and Kazooie enter {{the top of the}} fortress and defeat Gruntilda, destroying most of her body and the Hag 1 along with her. The two return to Bottles' house with their remaining friends (Jamjars, Mumbo, and Wumba) to find that <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> celebrated without them, much to their disappointment. They instead head to Cauldron Keep and play a game of hacky-sack with Gruntilda's head, who vows to have her revenge.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{he invited}} Perrie {{to be his}} date after she fell off her bike while staring at him work out on a field and pouring water over his torso to cool down. He helps her up, and gives her a corsage. Toward {{the end of the}} video, they sit on a bench next to the entrance, and see their date walk in with another girl wearing the same corsage as the ones that he had given each of them. They realise that they have all been two-timed by the same guy, and are all dateless. It ends with the girls being each other's date and solemnly dancing whilst <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> a good time. Metro writer Rebecca Lewis noted that the man in the video {{strongly}} resembled Perrie's former fiancé Zayn Malik of One Direction. She also wrote that fans had noticed that she was still wearing her engagement ring in the video, meaning that the video was filmed before they split up in August 2015.|$|E

25|$|During the night, after <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> gone to bed, Clara {{returns to}} the parlor {{to check on her}} beloved {{nutcracker}}. As she reaches the little bed, the clock strikes midnight and she looks up to see Drosselmeyer perched atop it. Suddenly, mice begin to fill the room and the Christmas tree begins to grow to dizzying heights. The nutcracker also grows to life size. Clara finds herself {{in the midst of a}} battle between an army of gingerbread soldiers and the mice, led by their king. They begin to eat the soldiers.|$|E
500|$|Jamestown has {{now been}} built and Walter tells his wife Alice about Powhatan’s victory over Miami. They then discuss a banquet hosted by Powhatan that Smith, Rolfe and Percy will attend. Meanwhile, Pocahontas and Nima witness Grimosco and Miami {{plotting}} to kill the European settlers. [...] When Grimosco coerces Powhatan into believing he should kill all the White men, by casting doubt about their intentions, creating fear about how they will act in the future, and invoking religious imagery, Pocahontas runs to warn the settlers about the danger. Back in Jamestown, a comic bit ensues in which Larry’s wife Kate has arrived disguised as a male page, and teases him before revealing herself. [...] She says she has come with Percy’s lover, Geraldine, also disguised as a page, who has come to convince Percy he was wrong about her infidelity. Pocahontas arrives and convinces the settlers to go to Powhatan’s palace to rescue their colleagues from Grimosco’s plot. They arrive {{just in time to}} prevent the disaster. [...] Grimosco is taken away, and Miami stabs himself in shame. [...] <b>Everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> a happy ending: Pocahontas is with Rolfe, Walter is with Alice, Larry is with Kate, Percy is with Geraldine, and even Robin is with Nima. Smith forgives Powhatan, and gives the play's final speech, predicting a great future for the new country that will form in this land.|$|E
500|$|After Shao Kahn's {{invasion}} of Earthrealm is halted by Raiden's forces of light, Raiden blasts and sends Kahn through a portal. At {{exactly the same}} time on Earth, Superman stops Darkseid's Apokoliptian invasion by blasting Darkseid with his heat vision as he enters a boom tube. These acts do not destroy either of them, but merge them into Dark Kahn, and causes the DC and Mortal Kombat universes to merge. As this happens, the characters' abilities fluctuate, causing violent [...] "rage" [...] outbreaks that are actually the feelings of Dark Kahn being infused in the characters from afar. Because of this, certain characters gain either strength or vulnerability. This allows for such things [...] as the possibility of Superman being defeated due to his vulnerability to magic, and giving the Joker the ability to fight skilled martial artists such as his nemesis Batman and Deathstroke. With each world thinking that the other {{is responsible for the}} merger, they fight each other until only one fighter from each side remains: Raiden and Superman. In the final battle, the two fight while Dark Kahn feeds on their rage. Both realizing that the other is not working with Dark Kahn, they overcome their rage for each other and defeat their fused enemy, restoring the two worlds to their normal separation. While <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> been sent to their original universe, Darkseid and Shao Kahn have been switched and are both rendered powerless. In the end, they both face eternal imprisonment in the other's universe; Darkseid is restrained in the Netherealm, while Shao Kahn is trapped in the Phantom Zone.|$|E

50|$|The {{search for}} the truth leads him into the {{turbulent}} political history of Italy during the seventies and also into obscure corners of modern-day affluent society, exposing the sordid details of a crime that <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>had</b> forgotten.|$|R
5000|$|A {{backwards}} {{message was}} {{inserted in the}} middle of the track [...] "The Smartest Person I Know". Singer Patty Donahue's voice can be heard saying: [...] "Anyone who worries about subliminal messages on pop records is a fool. <b>Everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>have</b> a nice day".|$|R
500|$|Vedder called [...] "Gonna See My Friend" [...] a [...] "drug song," [...] but {{elaborated}} {{that the}} song is about {{going to see a}} friend to stay off drugs, and he stated that [...] "Got Some" [...] is about a [...] "drug dealer," [...] but added what the drug the dealer is selling is actually a great rock song. [...] "Johnny Guitar", described by Vedder as [...] "almost an Elvis Costello homage", had its lyrics inspired by a collage of album covers that is pasted on the bathroom wall of the band's rehearsal space. Vedder noticed the album cover for Johnny [...] "Guitar" [...] Watson's 1979 album, What the Hell Is This?, and imagined a man who becomes attracted to one of the various women on the cover and then wonders why this woman would rather be one of Watson's many girlfriends instead of his only one. Vedder described [...] "Just Breathe" [...] as [...] "as close to a love song as we've ever gotten," [...] and said that the subject of {{the song is}} the happiest times of people's lives when they should just take in the moment and [...] "breathe for a minute." [...] He also said that [...] "Unthought Known" [...] concerns the human psyche, and [...] "Supersonic" [...] is about the love for music. According to Vedder, [...] "Speed of Sound" [...] is a song taken {{from the perspective of a}} man who is still sitting in a bar after <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> left, but he added that even though the song is sad it became more [...] "confident" [...] when played with the whole band. He said [...] "Force of Nature" [...] is [...] "about the strength of one person in the relationship, when they can withstand some of the faults in another." [...] "The End" [...] has been described as an [...] "aching love song." ...|$|E
2500|$|Then {{begins the}} famous chariot allegory, called by R. Hackworth the [...] "centrepiece" [...] of Phaedrus, and [...] "the famous and moving {{account of the}} vision, fall and {{incarnation}} of the soul." [...] A soul, says Socrates, is like the [...] "natural union {{of a team of}} winged horses and their charioteer". While the gods have two good horses, <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> a mixture: one is beautiful and good, while the other is neither.|$|E
2500|$|That same year, bassist Alec John Such {{was fired}} from the band, the first lineup change since Bon Jovi began. Hugh McDonald who was the bassist on [...] "Runaway," [...] unofficially {{replaced}} Such as bassist. Jon Bon Jovi said, regarding the departure of Such: [...] "Of course it hurts. But I learned to accept and respect it. The fact that I'm a workaholic, studio in, studio out, stage on, stage off, want {{to be dealing with}} music day and night, doesn't mean <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> to adjust to that pace. Alec wanted to quit for a while now, so it didn't come as a complete surprise." ...|$|E
50|$|When the {{director}} watched the tests, one girl stood out - where <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>had</b> gazed into the lens with {{expressions of the}} deepest sincerity, this one hadn't been able to repress a laugh. She was funny, it shone through, and she got the job.|$|R
50|$|In the 1986 event, Billy Bland {{waited at}} the start until five minutes after <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>had</b> begun so that the other runners could not follow him and take {{advantage}} of his detailed route knowledge. Bland then ran though the field and was able to overtake everyone except Hugh Symonds.|$|R
50|$|The rejoicing and {{excitement}} surrounding freedom provoked {{the consciousness of}} how miserable his parents and <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>had</b> been on the plantation. Lewis was depressed at this point, {{he did not see}} himself being freed, but saw freedom as being forced from the life he knew; the plantation was his home.|$|R
2500|$|When Rupert goes to leave, Mrs. Wilson accidentally {{hands him}} David's monogrammed hat, further arousing his suspicion. Rupert {{returns to the}} {{apartment}} a short while after <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> departed, pretending that he has left his cigarette case behind. He hides the case behind some books on the chest, asks for a drink and then stays to theorize about David's disappearance. He is encouraged by Brandon, who hopes Rupert will understand and even applaud them. A drunk Phillip is unable to take it any more; he throws a glass and says, [...] "Cat and mouse, cat and mouse. But which is the cat and which is the mouse?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The team investigates {{a number}} of events related to the flashforward, {{including}} [...] "Suspect Zero", who did not lose consciousness during the event because of a quantum entanglement device (QED), the sinister [...] "D. Gibbons/Dyson Frost", and a similar mass loss of consciousness in Somalia many years earlier in 1991. Meanwhile, personal revelations contained within the flashforwards occupy the personal lives of the principal characters. Mark Benford sees himself relapsing into alcoholism; his wife sees herself with another man; Demetri Noh sees nothing, which could mean {{that he will not}} be alive to see the day <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> glimpsed or, perhaps, that his future wasn't set {{on the day of the}} flashforward. Other characters grapple with similarly unexpected or surprising revelations in their flashforwards.|$|E
2500|$|Experimentation with {{different}} effects pedals {{has led to}} Parker creating new and unique sounds. [...] "If you {{make an effort to}} not put the pedals in the order you're meant to, then you'll end up with something new sounding. We don't have any things that we got from another planet or anything, it's the same things <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> used." [...] "People have a distortion pedal and then a reverb pedal. A reverb is meant to make it sound like it's in a cathedral or something. If you put it the other way around, it won't sound like a guitar being played in a church, it'll sound like a church being stuffed inside a shoebox and then exploded. You can do different things just by treating things differently." ...|$|E
5000|$|Her {{father was}} William Wentworth Fitzwilliam, Viscount Milton, {{the eldest son}} of William Wentworth-FitzWilliam, 6th Earl FitzWilliam. Her father died before inheriting the Earldom and it passed to her brother, William Wentworth-FitzWilliam, 7th Earl FitzWilliam whose {{lifestyle}} she criticised; [...] "he had so much and <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>had</b> so little".|$|R
5000|$|On his {{succession}} to the Earldom, {{he became}} one of the richest men in Britain, inheriting an estate of significant land, industrial and mineral-right holdings worth £3.3 billion in 2007 terms.

25|$|Kitty and {{her mother}} tried to locate their family members soon after they were liberated but found that <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>had</b> been killed: {{her father had been}} {{discovered}} by the Gestapo and shot; her brother was killed in battle; and her grandmother was taken to Belzec concentration camp and died in the gas chambers.|$|R
2500|$|When Bree tells Andrew {{that if he}} {{gets his}} friend Lisa pregnant, he will marry her. Andrew merely laughs as he is {{actually}} developing a relationship with Justin, who confesses to Gabrielle Solis that he and Andrew have been [...] "fooling around" [...] for some time. Andrew later crashes Zach's pool party with Justin and some friends and creates mayhem. However, after <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> gone home, Susan Mayer catches them naked in the swimming pool kissing; Andrew anxiously shouts, [...] "I'm not, I'm not gay!" [...] Susan then walks away, shocked by what she had just seen. After getting expelled from school for drug abuse and vehicular assault on a school parking attendant, as well as continuing his rudeness towards Bree, Andrew is sent to a juvenile delinquent boot camp.|$|E
6000|$|... [Good-humouredly.] You know that's not true, Christina. I've {{refused to}} perpetrate {{a number of}} abominable jobs that you've urged me to.

5000|$|Waseem {{was arrested}} {{on the evening of}} 16 July.

6000|$|... 'You {{remember}} what you promised me?' he murmured, leaning over me and clasping me. 'If ever I were poor, friendless, hunted--you would marry me. Now the opportunity has come when we can both prove ourselves. To-day, except you and dear Georgey, I haven't {{a friend in the}} world. <b>Everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> turned against me. Southminster holds the field. I am a suspected forger; in a very few days I shall doubtless be a convicted felon. Unjustly, as you know; yet still--we must face it--a convicted felon. So I have come to claim you. I have come to ask you now, in this moment of despair, will you keep your promise?' ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{shook her}} head as with the easy habit of an interviewed heroine or a freak of nature at a show. [...] "Nobody whatever."

You see," [...] she added, [...] "how that's to be taken into account--that <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> gone. When I was ten years old there were, with my father and my mother, six of us. I'm all that's left. But they died," [...] she went on, to be fair all round, [...] "of different things. Still, there it is. And, as I told you before, I'm American. Not that I mean that makes me worse. However, you'll probably know what it makes me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Everything {{had to be}} done, you know. There {{were the}} guns, but no horses and no harness. The horses had to be got somehow, and the harness {{manufactured}} out of ropes; and {{you can imagine the}} confusion of nine battalions of infantry, all recruits, with no one to teach them except a score or two of old army and militia officers. Old Tom has done wonders, I can tell you. You see, he is so fearfully earnest himself <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>has</b> got to be earnest. There has been no playing about anything, but just fifteen hours' hard work a day. Fellows grumbled and growled and said it was absurd, and threatened to do all sorts of things.

50|$|I can {{remember}} perfectly getting to Limoges the start. I was anxious and scared {{at the same}} time, but full of pride.
