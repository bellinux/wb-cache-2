40|$|Aim of {{the work}} was the {{acquisition}} and analysis of loads recorded in the field by means of dynamometric bindings applied to snowboards. Binding loads were collected in slalom courses on two expert amateur testers: both a soft boot and a <b>hard</b> <b>boot</b> session were recorded. Load data related to the slalom dynamics are presented and analysed in the binding reference system. For the soft boot slalom course, the six load components resolved in the board reference frame are reported and can be useful {{for the study of}} the system dynamics and the effective design of boards...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Microprocessor {{memory is}} {{sensitive}} to cold boot attacks. In this kind of attacks, memory remanence is exploited to download its content after the microprocessor has been struck by a <b>hard</b> <b>boot.</b> If just in this moment, a crypto-algorithm was in execution, the memory data can be downloaded into a backup memory and specialized tools {{can be used to}} extract the secret keys. In the main memory data can be protected using efficient encryption techniques but in caches this is not possible unless the performance becomes seriously degraded. Recently, an interleaved scrambling technique (IST) was presented to improve the security of caches against cold boot attacks. While IST is effective for this particular kind of attacks, a weakness exists against side channel attacks, in particular using power analysis. Reliability of data in caches is warranted by means of error detecting and correcting codes. In this work it is shown how these kinds of codes can be used not only to improve reliability but also the security of data. In particular, a self-healing technique is selected to make the IST technique robust against side channel attacks using power analysis...|$|E
2500|$|Snowboard {{boots are}} mostly {{considered}} soft boots, though alpine snowboarding uses a <b>harder</b> <b>boot</b> {{similar to a}} ski boot. [...] A boot's primary function is to transfer the rider's energy into the board, protect the rider with support, and keep the rider's feet warm. A snowboarder shopping for boots is usually {{looking for a good}} fit, flex, and looks. Boots can have different features such as lacing styles, heat molding liners, and gel padding that the snowboarder also might be looking for. Tradeoffs include rigidity versus comfort, and built in forward lean, versus comfort.|$|R
50|$|For most skating a {{high boot}} is used, which {{provides}} more ankle support and {{is easier to}} skate in, particularly for beginners. Speed skaters often use a carbon fiber boot which provides greater support with a lower cut allowing more ankle flexion.For recreational skating a soft boot is used for greater comfort, but many other disciplines prefer a <b>harder</b> <b>boot,</b> either to protect the foot against impact or for better control of the skate. The boot may also contain shock absorbent padding for comfort. Downhill skaters often use boots that are heat-molded {{to the shape of}} the foot, with a foam liner.|$|R

40|$|To load SPU-specific {{firmware}} onto an SP card: 1. Find {{the full}} name of the SPU-specific firmware you want to load by examining the medium's label. 2. Execute the FV command and check the version number in the Alternate Firmware Versions section of the screen. If there is a version number, go to step 3. If {{there is not a}} version number, go to step 4. 3. Determine if the FUT firmware version number in the alternate bank is the latest version by matching it with the FUT version number that came in the kit. If the FUT firmware version number in the alternate bank is not the latest version, continue. If the FUT firmware version number in the alternate bank is the latest version, go to step 5. 4. Load the FUT firmware. After the FUT has finished loading, go to step 5 of this procedure. Always use the latest version of the FUT firmware to load SPU-specific hardware. This ensures that FUT firmware is not overwritten, and that FUT firmware is always available in the alternate bank to facilitate repairs and updates. 5. Use the normal shutdown procedure for HP-UX or MPE/iX. Ensure that: a. A system backup has been performed. b. The operating system has been shut down. 6. After the shutdown completes, execute the SW command at the SP> prompt. A <b>hard</b> <b>boot</b> is performed and the FUT firmware is loaded...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Astronaut spacewalk {{training}} {{can result in}} a variety of symptom complaints and possible injuries. This study quantified and characterized signs, symptoms, and injuries resulting from extravehicular activity spacesuit training at NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX, immersion facility. METHODS: We identified the frequency and incidence of symptoms by location, mechanisms of injury, and effective countermeasures. Recommendations were made to improve injury prevention, astronaut training, test preparation, and training hardware. At the end of each test, a questionnaire was completed documenting signs and symptoms, mechanisms of injury, and countermeasures. RESULTS: Of the 770 tests, there were 190 in which suit symptoms were reported (24. 6 %). There were a total of 352 reported suit symptom comments. Of those symptoms, 166 were in the hands (47. 16 %), 73 were in the shoulders (20. 7 %), and 40 were in the feet (11. 4 %). Others ranged from 6. 0 % to 0. 28 %, respectively, from the legs, arms, neck, trunk, groin, and head. Causal mechanisms for the hands included moisture and hard glove contacts resulting in fingernail injuries; in the shoulders, hard contact with suit components and strain mechanisms; and in the feet, <b>hard</b> <b>boot</b> contact. The severity of symptoms was highest in the shoulders, hands, and feet. CONCLUSIONS: Most signs and symptoms were mild, self-limited, of brief duration, and were well controlled by available countermeasures. Some represented the potential for significant injury with consequences affecting astronaut health and performance. Correction of extravehicular activity training-related injuries requires a multidisciplinary approach to improve prevention, medical intervention, astronaut training, test planning, and suit engineering...|$|E

50|$|Snowboard {{boots and}} {{bindings}} are normally far simpler than their downhill counterparts, rarely including release systems for instance, {{and need to}} provide mechanical support only in the fore and aft directions. These typically consist of an external frame, generally L shaped, which the snowboarder steps into and then fastens down using straps over the boot. The boot itself is not as responsible for transmitting forces, and can be much softer than a typical downhill boot. When the sport was first introduced, normal winter boots were used, but today {{it is much more}} common to use semi-stiff snowboarding boots. Some specialty disciplines use <b>harder</b> <b>boots</b> with step-in bindings more similar to downhill systems, but these are not widely used outside these fields, even though some downhill sports teachers use these so they can switch between snowboarding or skiing classes without having to change boots.|$|R

These boots also had metal studs or tacks put in the sole the bottom so the players would have more stability on the pitch.
