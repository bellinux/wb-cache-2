50|$|Aluminized steel can be {{made using}} a variety of processes, cladding, <b>hot</b> <b>dipping,</b> {{galvanic}} coating, metallizing, and calorizing, but the most effective process is <b>hot</b> <b>dipping.</b> The process of <b>hot</b> <b>dipping</b> starts by cleaning the steel, then placing the steel in a bath of Al-11%Si at a temperature of 988K and shaken, then pulled out and air dried. The aluminium diffuses into the steel, creating an intermetallic layer above the steel base layer, but below the outside aluminum coating. The aluminium coating is oxidized to help protect the inner steel from corrosion and further aluminium diffusion. The silicon is added to the aluminium bath to create a thinner layer of aluminium on the steel. The <b>hot</b> <b>dipping</b> process is cheaper and more effective to produce aluminized steel than any other process.|$|E

Browned onions, red chillies, and some garlic are browned, and then ground into a paste along with grated coconut. This is added to the water, and the mixture is finally seasoned with Chaunk. The steamed pulses themselves are often used to prepare a dry side salad known as 'palya' (ಪಲ್ಯ).|$|E
40|$|Zinc has {{traditionally}} been the metallic material most widely used to protect steel against atmospheric corrosion due to its ability to afford cathodic protection to steel in all types of natural atmospheres. In recent decades, aluminium and zinc/aluminium alloy coatings have been used instead of zinc in certain atmospheric applications.

The lack of knowledge of the ternary interdiffusion coefficients for the Al-Si-Fe system is overcome by reducing the coupled system of diffusion equations to a single partial differential equation (PDE), utilizing the diffusion path. Then by using a Levenberg-Marquardt inverse method, the apparent diffusion along this path can be determined.
