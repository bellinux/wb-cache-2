5|$|The {{first major}} break for The Kingston Trio came in late June 1957 when comedian Phyllis Diller {{canceled}} a week-long engagement at The Purple Onion club in San Francisco. When Werber persuaded the club's owner {{to give the}} untested Trio a chance, Guard sent out five hundred postcards to everyone that the three musicians <b>knew</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bay Area and Werber plastered the city with handbills announcing the engagement. When the crowds came, the Trio had been well prepared by months of work, and they achieved such local popularity that the initial week's engagement stretched to six months. Werber built upon this initial success, booking a national club tour in early 1958 for the Trio that included engagements at such prominent night spots as Mister Kelly's in Chicago, the Village Vanguard in New York, Storyville in Boston, and finally a return to San Francisco and its showcase nightclub, the Hungry i, in June of that year.|$|E
5|$|Traveling to {{the ruined}} city of Paddra in 10 AF, they find Hope, {{who has become}} {{the leader of the}} Academy, with Alyssa as his assistant. They also find a {{recording}} of prophecies made by one of the seeresses of Paddra, who are believed to have died out centuries prior: one fragmented prophecy shows Lightning in Valhalla. Paddra is shrouded by an eclipse, which Noel says is not supposed to happen for several centuries. While Serah and Noel resolve the paradox causing the eclipse, they encounter Caius Ballad, a man Noel knows from 700 AF who opposes their mission, and Yeul, who looks identical to a girl of the same name Noel <b>knew</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future. After resolving the paradox, an alternative timeline appears in which there was never an eclipse. The repaired prophecy shows Caius in Valhalla fighting Lightning and the pillar supporting Cocoon collapsing. Noel claims that this takes place around 400 AF, devastating the human population as well as the world, creating a future where he is the last human in existence. Serah and Noel move on, while Hope and Alyssa work on finding a way to prevent the pillar's collapse.|$|E

500|$|In 1942, Clark Shaughnessy {{was hired}} as head coach. Shaughnessy had {{achieved}} fame at Stanford, where he installed his quarterback-centric version of the T-formation as his primary offensive scheme.

Shaughnessy was named 1940 College Coach of the Year for the turnaround performance.

500|$|Production advisor Miriam Geiger quickly {{compiled}} a handmade film textbook for Welles, a practical reference book of film techniques that he studied carefully. He then taught himself filmmaking by matching its visual vocabulary to The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, which he ordered from the Museum of Modern Art, and films by Frank Capra, René Clair, Fritz Lang, King Vidor and Jean Renoir. The one film he genuinely studied was John Ford's Stagecoach, which he watched 40 times. [...] "As it turned out, {{the first day}} I ever walked onto a set was my first day as a director," [...] Welles said. [...] "I'd learned whatever I <b>knew</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> projection room—from Ford. After dinner every night for about a month, I'd run Stagecoach, often with some different technician or department head from the studio, and ask questions. 'How was this done?' 'Why was this done?' It was like going to school." ...|$|E

500|$|Falle's pimp {{regularly}} {{beat her}} {{and she began to}} suffer from battered person syndrome. The worst beating she received was in a brothel where she and four other teenagers engaged in prostitution. Over the years that she was married to her pimp, she hoped he would change. She later said that she [...] "wanted to love him, believe he'd never do it again." [...] She tried to make him enough money through prostitution to convince him not to find another girl. He threatened her family, and conditioned her not to call the police. Fear of being labelled a [...] "snitch" [...] or [...] "rat" [...] prevented her from going to the police. None of the other women she <b>knew</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sex industry were in healthy relationships. At her peak, Falle owned a Ford Mustang, bought her pimp a Mercedes-Benz, and lived in a four-bedroom penthouse apartment, but she continued to experience violence. She used her material possessions to elevate herself above the women around her who were dependent on cocaine; she dismissed them as [...] "crackheads" [...] and [...] "crackhoes".|$|E
500|$|Considerable {{arrangements}} {{had been}} made for the President's security. [...] Exposition police were stationed at the doors; detectives from the Buffalo police guarded the aisle. In addition to McKinley's usual Secret Service agent, George Foster, two other agents {{had been assigned to}} the Buffalo trip because of Cortelyou's security concerns. Babcock was made nervous by a joke at lunch in an Exposition restaurant that the President might be shot during the reception. He had arranged for a dozen artillerymen to attend the reception in full-dress uniform, intending to use them as decoration. Instead, he had them stand in the aisle with instructions to close on any suspicious-looking person who might approach the President. These men were not trained in police work, and served to crowd the area in front of the President and obstruct the views of the detectives and Secret Service. [...] At such events, Foster usually stood just to the left and behind McKinley. Milburn wished to stand to McKinley's left to be able to introduce anyone he <b>knew</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> line to the President, and Foster and another agent instead stood across the aisle from McKinley.|$|E

She was cast in the part after having worked with Fontana on the unaired pilot of Philly Heat, an ABC miniseries he worked on about members of the Philadelphia Fire Department. Fontana offered Margulies a recurring role on Homicide, but she turned it down in favor of ER. Michael S. Kennedy, an actor from Richmond, Texas, reprised his role of Lt. Jimmy Tyron from the previous episode, [...] "". A struggling actor, Kennedy received a call from a casting director he <b>knew,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of an all-night Virginia Beach shoot for a small role in , giving him one day's notice of the audition for Homicide. He so enjoyed working on the show that he wrote a Homicide script himself, with the Tyron character playing a major part, although it was ultimately never used.

As I write the story, the girls become what they are now.

[...] Kawahara also added that he wrote the series to demonstrate that he views online gaming not as a social ill or escape from real life, and thus decided to show games in a more positive light in his light novels. In another interview with Anime News Network, interviewer Lynzee Lamb noted that Asuna is a [...] "very strong, capable female character", likening her to Genji's mother in The Tale of Genji, to which Kawahara agreed.|$|E

Sometime in late April, Mitchell left Canada for the first time, going with Chuck to the US, where the two began playing music together.
