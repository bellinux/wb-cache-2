40|$|This study {{examined}} the hypothesis that cognitive resources {{may be involved in}} swallowing. The approach involved a dual-task, reaction time (RT) paradigm with 10 healthy, non-impaired (NI) control participants and 10 participants in early to middle stages of Parkinson's disease (PD). First, baseline measures were obtained for <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> anticipatory phase and oropharyngeal phase during swallowing and RTs to non-word, auditory stimuli. Next, a dual-task was introduced requiring participants to swallow 5 ml of water from a cup while listening for a target non-word presented auditorily during anticipatory or oropharyngeal phases. Target stimuli were randomized across 19 baseline/single-task and 19 dual-task trials. For the single-task data, repeated measures analyses of variance were used to assess differences in (a) <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anticipatory phase across trials within and between participant groups; (b) <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oropharyngeal phase across trials within and between participant groups; and (c) <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> reaction times across trials within and between groups. For the dual-task data, analyses of variance were used to assess differences in (a) <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anticipatory phase between baseline/single-task and dual-task conditions; (b) <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oropharyngeal phase between baseline/single-task and dual-task conditions; and (c) <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> reaction times between baseline/single-task and dual-task conditions for each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two swallowing phases. Results showed slowed swallowing and RTs in participants with PD compared to controls in both anticipatory and oropharyngeal phases of swallowing. This effect was largely carried by participants in more severe, mid-stage disease as compared to early disease. The anticipatory phase was more affected than the oropharyngeal phase, suggesting that cognitive demands may be greater for that phase. Swallowing durations were similar for NIs and participants in early stage PD, underscoring the strength and persistent nature of swallowing...|$|R
