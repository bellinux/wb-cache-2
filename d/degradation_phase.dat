40|$|A pilot-scale land {{treatment}} unit (LTU) was constructed {{at the former}} Guadalupe oil production field {{with the purpose of}} investigating the effect of co-substrate addition on the bacterial community and the resulting rate and extent of total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) degradation. The TPH was a weathered mid-cut distillate (C 10 -C 32) excavated from the subsurface and stockpiled before treatment. A control cell (Cell 1) in the LTU was amended with nitrogen and phosphorus while the experimental cell (Cell 2) was amended with additional complex co-substrate—corn steep liquor. During the pilot LTU operation, measurements were taken of TPH, nutrients, moisture, aerobic heterotrophic bacteria (AHB), and diesel oxidizing bacteria (DOB). The bacterial community was also assayed using community-level physiology profiles (CLPP) and 16 S rDNA terminal restriction fragment (TRF) analysis. TPH degradation in both cells was characterized by a rapid phase of degradation that lasted for the first three weeks, followed by a slower <b>degradation</b> <b>phase</b> that continued through the remainder of the project. The initial rate of TPH-degradation in Cell 1 (− 0. 021 day− 1) was slower than in Cell 2 (− 0. 035 day− 1). During the slower phase, degradation rates in both cells were similar (− 0. 0026 and − 0. 0024 respectively). AHB and DOB counts were similar in both cells during the fast <b>degradation</b> <b>phase.</b> A second addition of co-substrate to Cell 2 {{at the beginning of the}} slow <b>degradation</b> <b>phase</b> resulted in an increased AHB population that lasted for the remainder of the project but did not affect TPH degradation rates. CLPP data showed that co-substrate addition altered the functional capacity of the bacterial community during both phases of the project. However, TRF data indicated that the phylogenetic composition of the community was not different in the two cells during the fast <b>degradation</b> <b>phase.</b> The bacterial phylogenetic structure in Cell 2 differed from Cell 1 after the second application of co-substrate, during the slow <b>degradation</b> <b>phase.</b> Thus, co-substrate addition appeared to enhance the functional capacity of the bacterial community during the fast <b>degradation</b> <b>phase</b> when the majority of TPH was bioavailable, resulting in increased degradation rates, but did not affect rates during the slow <b>degradation</b> <b>phase</b> when the remaining TPH may not have been bioavailable. These data show that co-substrate addition might prove most useful for applications such as land farming where TPH is regularly applied to the same soil and initial degradation rates are more important to the project goals...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Programmed {{cell death}} (PCD) is {{involved}} in the removal of superfluous and damaged cells in most organ systems. The induction phase of PCD or apoptosis is characterized by an extreme heterogeneity of potential PCD-triggering signal transduction pathways. During the subsequent effector phase, the numerous PCD-inducing stimuli converge into a few stereotypical pathways and cells pass a point of no return, thus becoming irreversibly conunitted to death. It is only during the successive <b>degradation</b> <b>phase</b> that vital structures and functions are destroyed, giving rise to the full-blown phenotype of PCD. Evidence is accumulating that cytoplasinic structures, including mitochondria, participate in the critical effector stage and that alterations commonly considered to define PCD (apoptotic morphology of the nucleus and regular, oligonucleosomal chromatin fragmentation) have to be ascribed to the late <b>degradation</b> <b>phase.</b> The decision as to whether a cell will undergo PCD or not may be expected to be regulated by “switches ” that, once activated, trigger self-amplificatory metabolic pathways. One of these switches may reside in a perturbation of mitochondrial function. Thus, a decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential, followed by mitochondrial uncoupling and generation of reactive oxygen species, precedes nuclear alterations. It appears that molecules that participate in apoptotic decisionmaking also exert functions that are vital for normal cell proliferation and intermediate metabolism. -Kroemer...|$|E
40|$|Poly- 4 -hydroxybutyrate, P(4 HB), is a biosynthetic {{thermoplastic}} polymer {{that has}} been studied as a bio-absorbable medical material. In order to explore the in vivo biodegradation behaviour of porous P(4 HB) membranes with specified apertures (89 – 150 mm), membranes with different porosities were implanted subcutaneously into the backs of 27 eight-week-old Sprague Dawley rats. The implanted specimens were examined with Masson and hematoxylin and eosin staining. Masson staining indicated that the P(4 HB) membranes were encased in fibrous cysts and that more collagen fibers were present within the sections of the hyper-porosity group. Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed that the residual area of the P(4 HB) membranes in the hyper-porosity group decreased sharply compared to the hypo-porosity group, which implied that the P(4 HB) membranes with higher porosity degraded faster than those with lower porosity. A slow <b>degradation</b> <b>phase</b> persisted for approximately 14 weeks during the degradation process. After the 16 th week, the P(4 HB) scaffolds fell into a fast <b>degradation</b> <b>phase.</b> The residual areas of the hyper-porosity P(4 HB) membranes at the 32 nd week were reduced by 39. 76 % compared with the second week after implantation.

40|$|Direct {{methanol}} {{fuel cells}} (DMFC) are {{well suited for}} portable and local applications,since liquid methanol has a high volumetric energy density. Still, slow reactionkinetics of the methanol conversion result in low efficiencies compared to fuel cellsbased on hydrogen. Furthermore, the degradation mechanisms are not yet fullyunderstood. The {{aim of this study}} is the identification and description of degradation mechanismsin direct methanol fuel cells for different methanol supply conditions. The methanolsupply is a critical aspect for the successful operation of the DMFC system. Areduction of the methanol concentration increases the cell efficiency, but similarlyincreases the risk of local or complete methanol depletion, which is also analysedin this study. The cell performance was measured by single cell experiments with different flowrates of methanol and oxygen. In addition, the degradation of the cell wasdetermined in case of local and complete methanol depletion. A segmented circuitboard was used to measure the local current density in order to evaluate the currentdistribution and to identify local degradation. Different kinds of degradation mechanism could be identified in this study, whichwere analysed with electrochemical methods like cyclic voltammetry and impedancespectroscopy. These methods are sensitive to changes of the catalyst structure andcomposition. The catalyst composition was additionally evaluated by opticalemission spectrometry. Changes of the structure and the interface between theelectrolyte and the electrode were investigated with a scanning electron microscopeand energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The focus of the investigations was based on varying methanol supplies at theanode. Therefore, investigations of the complete and, for the first time, the partialmethanol depletion were done. Additional degradation experiments were related tothe supply of methanol and oxygen, in order to identify their influence on the localcurrent distribution and the cell power. The measurements were used to estimatethe risk of a local depletion of methanol and oxygen during operation. The investigations showed that the complete as well as the partial methanoldepletion cause an irreversible degradation of the DMFC. The complete methanoldepletion with constant water supply consists of three <b>degradation</b> <b>phases,</b> whichoccur consecutively and are characterized by ruthenium and carbon corrosion.

Thus, this study focused in estimating the bacterial consumption of the DOC and DON (dissolved organic carbon and dissolved organic nitrogen, respectively) produced by axenic P. agardhii cultures and identifying some of the bacterial OTUs (operational taxonomic units) involved in the process. Both P. agardhii and bacterial inocula were sampled from the eutrophic Barra Bonita Reservoir (SP, Brazil). Two distinct carbon degradation phases were observed: during the first three days, higher degradation coefficients were calculated, which were followed by a slower <b>degradation</b> <b>phase.</b> The maximum value observed for particulate bacterial carbon (POC) was 11. 9 mg L- 1, which consisted of 62. 5 % of the total available DOC, and its mineralization coefficient was 0. 477 day- 1 (t½ = 1. 45 days). A similar pattern of degradation was observed for DON, although the coefficients were slightly different. Changes in the OTUs patterns were observed during the different steps of the degradation. The main OTUs were related to the classes Alphaproteobacteria (8 OTUs), Betaproteobacteria (2 OTUs) and Gammaproteobacteria (3 OTUs). The genus Acinetobacter was the only identified organism that occurred during the whole process. Bacterial richness was higher at the slower <b>degradation</b> <b>phase,</b> which could be related to the small amounts of DOM (dissolved organic matter) available, particularly carbon.

At the molecular level, cell life is marked by rhythmic events resulting from the two major oscillatory systems: the circadian clock and the cell cycle, which share some striking similarities. Both consist of interlocked auto-regulatory feedback loops and both rely on chromatin remodeling events that produce sequential transcription, translation, post-translational modification, and <b>degradation</b> <b>phases.</b> In mammals, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are rejoined by two highly regulated pathways: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which is always operative, and homologous recombination (HR), which is active only in late S- and G 2 -phases when both sister chromatids are present. DNA adducts induced by exposure to UV light, such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and pyrimidine pirimidone photoproducts ([6 - 4]PPs), can be repaired only by the nucleotide excision repair (NER) system. DNA damage response (DDR), which includes DNA repair, checkpoint activation, chromatin remodeling, and apoptosis, seems to be strictly modulated by the rhythmicity induced by the cell cycle and the circadian clock, and this could affect its efficiency, making the cells more sensitive or resistant to genotoxic stress {{at different times of}} the day...|$|R

These macroalgal blooms {{have a negative effect on}} the functioning of the ecosystem, fisheries activities and tourism. This thesis focuses on the regulation of seasonal and spatial dynamics of blooms of Ulva cf. scandinavica Bliding in the Veerse Meer, a eutrophic, brackish lake in the SW Netherlands. Studies have been performed on biomass dynamics, winter survival, taxonomy, auto-ecology and dynamics and regulation of macroalgal mats. The annual dynamics of Ulva biomass development in the Veerse Meer is described in conceptual model. Four phases are distinguished in the bloom: a dormant phase, a build-up phase, a stationary phase and a <b>degradation</b> <b>phase.</b> Algal fragments survive through the winter in the sediment. Probably, wind-induced currents cause the release of the algae from the sediment, thereby triggering the transition from the dormant to the build-up phase, however, further research is required. Light is the main factor regulating growth during the build-up phase. Only after a prolonged period of clear weather, nitrogen becomes growth limiting. Self-shading in the mats increases during the build-up phase, eventually causing the shift of the build-up phase to a more or less stationary phase. A high biomass can be maintained during this phase due to nutrient (mainly nitrogen) recycling in the mat. Finally, the <b>degradation</b> <b>phase</b> starts, during which biomass again decreases to winter levels. Management measures, aiming to decrease the macroalgal biomass development in the Veerse Meer, should be primarily directed to a decrease in nitrogen load.

In vitro induction of permeability transition in isolated mitochondria provokes the release of a protein factor capable of inducing nuclear chromatin condensation and fragmentation. This permeability transition is regulated by multiple endogenous effectors, including members of the bcl- 2 gene family. Inhibition of these effects prevents apoptosis...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{gives the}} {{variance}} of the phase recovered by a conventional quadriphase Costas loop in 16 QAM modulation {{in the presence of}} selective fading, represented as a two rays simplified model. The phase error variance is evaluated for different values of the fade depth, the location of the maximum attenuation in the frequency band and the delay of the reflected ray. The influence of an IF amplitud equalizer is discussed. Finally the relation between the performance <b>degradation</b> and <b>phase</b> noise is given, assuming a gaussian p. d. f. of the phase error. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R

40|$|Air-borne {{volcanic}} ash beds {{are used to}} date fans and terraces in the Galatea Basin and to outline the depositional history {{of this part of}} the Rangitaiki Valley. The basin is interpreted as a fault-angle depression formed by a downwarped sheet of ignimbrite and an upthrusted block of greywacke which forms the Ikawhenua Range. It is from this range that much of the detritus has been derived to fill the basin, deposited mainly in the form of fans and terraces. The larger fans cover a wide area and their surfaces are older than the Rotoma eruption of c. 8000 years B. P. The widespread occurrence of these fans indicates a major erosion interval between c. 11, 000 and c. 8, 000 years ago. The younger fans are distributed in a particular order with fans of the Pre-Taupo surface north of the Horomanga Stream and those of the Pre- and Post-Kaharoa surfaces south of the same stream. This ordered distribution of the younger fans suggests a climatic control of fan building. Aggradation and <b>degradation</b> <b>phases</b> in the Rangitaiki and Whirinaki Rivers have formed a pronounced meander trough containing terraces of the Pre-Taupo, Pre-Kaharoa, and Post-Kaharoa surfaces. The terrace of the Pre-Kaharoa surface, largely of Taupo Pumice alluvium, is the most common. Degradation, however, is controlled by a local base level at the ignimbrite rapids on the Rangitaiki River just north of the Galatea Basin...|$|R
