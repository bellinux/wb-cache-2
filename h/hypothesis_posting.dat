40|$|This study {{examined}} the difference between students’ sense of community in the traditional classroom setting versus the virtual classroom setting with middle school–age students. McMillan and Chavis’s sense of community theory served as the theoretical foundation of the study. A quantitative, causal-comparative design was utilized {{to determine the effects}} of the variables. Students at a public middle school in Virginia and a virtual middle school in Tennessee participated in this study. Seventy-eight students participated from the public middle school that constituted the traditional setting, and 60 students participated from the virtual middle school that constituted the virtual setting. The students completed the Sense of Community Index 2 (SCI- 2) to generate the data for the study. Results of this survey were analyzed using a MANOVA, obtaining results for the students’ overall sense of community and the four subscales that made up this survey: reinforcement of needs, membership, influence, and shared emotional connection. Statistical significance was present, rejecting the null hypothesis or sub null <b>hypothesis</b> (<b>post</b> hoc) for the overall sense of community, reinforcement of needs, membership, and a shared emotional connection. The area of influence did not yield statistical significance; therefore, the sub null <b>hypothesis</b> (<b>post</b> hoc) failed to be rejected. Suggestions for future research were provided...|$|R
40|$|Plan Recognition {{algorithms}} require {{to recognize}} a complete hierarchy explaining the agent's actions and goals. While the output of such algorithms is informative to the recognizer, the cost of its calculation is high in run-time, space, and completeness. Moreover, performing plan recognition online requires the observing agent to reason about future actions {{that have not yet}} been seen and maintain a set of hypotheses to support all possible options. This paper presents a new and efficient algorithm for online plan recognition called SLIM (Semi-Lazy Inference Mechanism). It combines both a bottom-up and top-down parsing processes, which allow it to commit only to the minimum necessary actions in real-time, but still provide complete <b>hypotheses</b> <b>post</b> factum. We show both theoretically and empirically that although the computational cost of this process is still exponential, there is a significant improvement in run-time when compared to a state of the art of plan recognition algorithm...|$|R

Assessment {{of the subjects}} was guided by models of normal sentence production and comprehension, and involved several new tests which were developed to investigate particular aspects of processing.

Of the 4, 660 middle-school students in the ACT database, 1, 384 8 th grade students were included in the study. The Student Readiness Inventory-Middle School (SRI-MS) was used to assess three broad PSFs based on ten scales, which were named motivation (consisting of Academic Discipline, Commitment to School, and Optimism), social control (consisting of Family Attitude toward Education and Family Involvement, Relationships with School Personnel, and School Safety Climate), and self-regulation (consisting of Managing Feelings, Orderly Conduct, and Thinking before Acting).

If no significant interaction terms were found, the effects of PSFs on achievement gains were examined using a psychosocial mediation model. The results showed that 8 th grade females demonstrated greater motivation, social control, and self-regulation than 8 th grade males. Also, motivation and social control each interacted significantly with sex and 8 th grade achievement when predicting 10 th grade achievement. Specifically, among female students, effects were positive for females with higher prior achievement and negative for females with lower prior achievement for both motivation and social control. For male students, neither motivation nor social control added significantly to the prediction of later achievement. There were no interactions between self-regulation and either sex or prior achievement.

As predicted in some variations of the Edgeworth <b>hypothesis,</b> the <b>posted</b> price data exhibit a significant cycle. Relative to the unique stationary distribution, the empirical distribution has excess mass in a price interval that moves downward over time until it approaches the lower boundary of the stationary distribution. Then the excess mass jumps upward and the downward cycle resumes. The amplitude of the cycle seems fairly constant over the longer experimental sessions. Of the simulations we consider, the one closest to Edgeworth’s 1925 account, a hybrid of gradient dynamics and logit dynamics, seems to best reproduce the observed dynamics.

Contrary to depressive realism, and in partial support of the selective processing account, this underconfidence effect was not reduced but modestly exacerbated in the depressed patients. Further, whereas the PTPEs of the comparison group exceeded that expected on the basis of chance alone those of the depressed individuals did not. The results provide no support for the depressive realism account and suggest that negative biases contribute to metacognitive information processing in major depression...|$|R
40|$|Reaching out for {{an object}} is often {{considered}} to consist of the control of two components: transporting the hand to the object's position, and scaling the grip to the object's size. We recently proposed an alternative view. According to this view, grasping consists of controlling the digits, not the hypothetical transport and grip. This alternative view assumes that {{the opening of the}} hand emerges from the trajectories of the digits. We therefore studied the movements of the digits in grasping. We asked subjects to grasp disks (diameters ranging from 5 to 8 cm) at marked positions with two digits. The positions were at opposite sides of the disk, at the same distance from the starting position, so that the orientation of the surface was the same for both digits. The subjects grasped the disks either with the index finger and thumb of the dominant hand, with the same digits of the non-dominant hand, or bimanually with both index fingers. Our predictions are: that the well-known relation between object size and grip aperture holds for each digit; that the same relation holds if the object is grasped with two hands instead of with the thumb and finger of one hand; that maximum deviation, variability and duration of the digit movements are related; and that variations in the timing of the maximum deviation of one digit are independent of those in the other digit. In accordance with our predictions, we found that the maximum deviation of both digits increased with 0. 75 times the object radius, independent of the hand(s) used. The movements of the thumb were more variable than those of the index finger, which was reflected by a larger deviation earlier in the movement. The timing of the maximum deviation of the two digits was independent. These results on the digits' movements are consistent with our view that grasping can be understood as the largely independent movements of the digits. The results are not in conflict with the hypothesis that the grip is controlled during grasping, but can only be explained by extending that <b>hypothesis</b> <b>post</b> hoc...|$|R

Given the close relationship between farm structure and agricultural production, the impact of the recent CAP reform on production decisions should give a good indication of the form agricultural structural change will take. Two competing <b>hypotheses</b> of <b>post</b> decoupling structural change are proposed; a ‘production inducing effect’ and an ‘expectations effect’. Using Irish, Danish and Dutch micro-data, which are comparable due to their participation in FADN, a descriptive analysis of the key characteristics of production in the agri-food sectors in each country will be performed using key indicators of structural change. The results indicate that the ‘expectations effect’, which claims that producers may adopt a ‘safety first’ strategy and make only minimal changes to production plans in case future payments are reassessed and re-linked to production or an agricultural activity, seems to be prevalent.

In this study, we addressed the <b>hypothesis</b> that <b>post</b> septic immune defects were due, in part, to the presence and/or expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs). After recovery from severe sepsis, mice exhibited significantly higher numbers of Tregs, which exerted greater in vitro suppressive activity compared with controls. The expansion of Tregs {{was not limited to}} CD 25 + cells, because Foxp 3 expression was also detected in CD 25 − cells from post septic mice. This latter group exhibited a significant increase of chromatin remodeling at the Foxp 3 promoter, because a marked increase in acetylation at H 3 K 9 was associated with an increase in Foxp 3 transcription. Post septic splenic dendritic cells promoted Treg conversion in vitro. Using a solid tumor model to explore the function of Tregs in an in vivo setting, we found post septic mice showed an increase in tumor growth compared with sham-treated mice with a syngeneic tumor model. This observation could mechanistically be related to the ability of post septic Tregs to impair the antitumor response mediated by CD 8 + T cells. Together, these data show that the post septic immune system obstructs tumor immunosurveillance, in part, by augmented Treg expansion and function...|$|R

The attraction effect and delay discounting were measured to test the <b>hypothesis</b> that <b>post</b> exercise hyperglycaemia can reduce heuristic-based decision making and increase cognitively effortful decisions. Individual differences in decision making traits were also assessed using the General Decision Making Styles questionnaire. Results showed that high-intensity exercise can induce elevation in blood glucose; however this effect was observed only in half the sample. Participants in the high intensity exercise condition {{were significantly more likely}} than those in the low intensity exercise condition to elicit post exercise hyperglycaemia. Additionally, results from this study show that higher blood glucose is associated with a greater probability of choosing the non-heuristic option in the apartment task; thus signifying less reliance on heuristic based System 1 decision making. Furthermore, in the delay discounting task, exploratory analyses suggest that high-intensity exercise-induced hyperglycaemia may rescue optimal decision-making for individuals who tend to make more intuitive decisions (i. e., are more reliant on System 1). Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to further elucidate the effects of exercise on decision making, taking into account blood glucose changes and individual difference profiles.

During the past decade, several studies have investigated microcirculatory dysfunction in critically ill patients. Main findings are a negative prognostic significance of microcirculatory alterations and the absence of a clear association between microcirculatory dysfunction and macrohemodynamic parameters. However, these studies were mainly restricted to high mortality subgroups such as cardiogenic and septic shock. This thesis aims to elaborate on the prevalence and significance in a general ICU population. The main project described in this thesis is the ‘Microcirculatory Shock Occurrence in Acutely ill Patients’ study, a 36 -center international study on the prevalence of microcirculatory alterations in intensive care patients. Microcirculatory dysfunction was not only associated with (relative) hyperlactatemia, but also with an increased risk of in-hospital death in patients with tachycardia, challenging the present paradigm of the dichotomy between microcirculation and macrocirculation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare two methods of library skills instruction: the {{traditional}} lecture method and the hypertext program 2 ̆ 2 What A Problem! 2 ̆ 2 to determine which method was more effective. In 1991 an instructional design was developed for the basic library skills orientation program. From this design a hypermedia computer instructional program 2 ̆ 2 What A Problem! 2 ̆ 2 was written. Sixty subjects were randomly selected (using a table of random numbers) from a population of 430 students enrolled in ninth grade English classes at South Fork High School in Stuart, Florida. This study used a multiple time-series experimental design; there were two experimental groups. The first hypothesis that was addressed in this study was that there was a significant difference in test scores between subjects who had received the hypermedia treatment and students who had received the lecture treatment. The first null hypothesis that was tested was that no significant difference existed in the test scores between students who had received the hypermedia instruction and students who had received the traditional lecture method of instruction. Data from equivalent form posttests (A, B, C) were used to support or not support the null <b>hypothesis.</b> <b>Posttest</b> A was given one day following instructional treatment. Posttest B was given seven days after instructional treatment. Posttest C was given twenty-one days after instructional treatment. Using a t-Test, the mean scores of the two instructional treatments were compared to see if the mean scores differed significantly at the. 050 level. The mean scores did not differ significantly on the Posttests; therefore, the first null hypothesis was supported. The second hypothesis that was examined was that there was a significant correlation between subjects 2 ̆ 7 perceptual response learning styles and the hypermedia method of instruction. The second null hypothesis was that there was no significant correlation between the hypermedia method of instruction and perceptual learning style. Subjects were given the NASpSP Learning Styles Profile and scored on the three subscales of the perceptual learning style subscale: the visual subscale, auditory subscale, and the emotive subscale. The subjects 2 ̆ 7 perceptual response subscale scores were then compared to the posttest scores of the library skills tests to determine if a significant relationship existed. A Pearson r was used to determine the correlation coefficient between the subscales and the posttest scores. In the hypermedia treatment group, significant positive correlation was found between the mean scores on Posttest Band Posttest C and the visual learning style subscale responses; therefore, the second null hypothesis was not supported on these posttests. No significant correlation was found between Posttest A 2 ̆ 7 s mean scores and the visual learning subscale. Therefore, the second null hypothesis was supported on Posttest A. A significant negative correlation was found on all the Posttests (A, B, C) and the auditory subscale of the NAASP Learning Style Profile of the hypermedia group. Therefore, the null hypothesis was not supported on the auditory subscale. A significant negative correlation was also found between the scores of Posttest Band Posttest C and the emotive response subscales. Therefore, the null hypothesis was not supported on Posttest Band Posttest C with the emotive subscale responses...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the effectiveness of training for the acquisition of Cultural Competence in nursing students. Is a quasi-experimental pretest-postest design with a single group in two consecutive courses (2011 - 12 / 2012 - 13). Data were collected through an ad-hoc 16 items Likert questionnaire at the beginning (pre-test) and the end of the course (post-test). A total of 43 students participated in the study. Statistically significant differences were observed in two items of the pretest results and no difference in post-test results. To confirm pretest and <b>posttest</b> <b>hypothesis,</b> results were compared after the educational intervention, finding significant differences in all survey items. The design of the course, in which knowledge and skills were worked, appears to be effective in acquiring cultural competence...|$|R
40|$|A {{mechanism}} for low-temperature nuclear fusion reactions is described, in which first deuterium atoms donate their electrons to the conduction band of a metallic-crystal lattice, and second thermal motion allows bare deuterons {{to begin to}} approach each other, and third loose non-orbiting elec-trons from the conduction band shield the deuterons from their mutual electrostatic repulsion, until they become close enough together {{that they can be}} influenced by the strong nuclear force. This “electron catalysis ” is similar in some respects to the well-studied phenomenon known as “muon catalysis. ” Additionally, Quantum Mechanics (QM) allows for a large number of electrons to be involved, which in turn allows the energy of the fusion reaction to be distributed among many particles. The net result is that the overall reac-tion is the very simple D+D→He 4, with no significant nuclear radiation of any sort released. The author acknowledges that a hypothesis is just a guess, an attempt to create an explanation for certain observations. Additional observations are required before the guess can be considered to be anything more than that. The first version of the <b>hypothesis</b> was <b>posted</b> on the Internet in 2000, and now only exists at www. archive. org. This version of the hypothesis incorporates some additional material to explain a “typical ” lack of nuclear radiation. There is some irony in that, detailed in Part Seven. The first four parts of this paper contain a lot of back-ground information, presented partly so that the interested and less-informed reader might gain an understanding of the subject, and partly to allow a “check ” of how this hypothesis has been put together. Obviously if an error exists in the background information presented here, the conclusion that depends on it may be faulty...|$|R
40|$|For years reading {{improvement}} {{programs have}} been part of the college curriculum. However, with the current trend toward open admissions these programs become even more vital. It is important to discover what methods best serve these students. The purpose of this study was to determine whether providing students with more freedom of choice as to course content would affect their achievement and attitudes in a college reading improvement program. A further purpose was to determine whether there was an interaction between student personality orientation and degree of student control in relationship to reading achievement. A three-group posttest, and in some cases pretest and posttest experimental design was utilized. The treatment groups represented three levels of student control: minimum, moderate and maximum. In the minimum student-controlled situation the instructor assigned all course work. The moderate student-controlled students chose their assignments from the options presented to them by their instructor. Students in the maximum student-controlled group had complete freedom as to type and amount of assignments they would complete. All groups used a weekly contract system for planning their programs. These contracts were assigned and/or chosen during a weekly conference with the instructor. The students worked independently in a laboratory-type setting. There were four major hypotheses tested. Hypotheses I and all its sub-hypotheses proposed there would be no differences in aspects of reading achievement among the three treatment groups. To measure these aspects of reading achievement the Diagnostic Reading Tests: Survey Section edited by Triggs was administered as a pretest and <b>posttest.</b> <b>Hypothesis</b> II stated there would be no differences among the treatment groups in attitude toward reading. To measure attitude toward reading a revised version of Este's Scale to Measure Attitudes Toward Reading was used. This Likert scale was administered as a pretest and <b>posttest.</b> <b>Hypothesis</b> III stated that there would be no differences among the treatment groups in attitude toward the reading improvement course. To test H othesis III a semantic differential developed by Poppen and Thompson was used. This instrument was administered as a <b>posttest.</b> <b>Hypothesis</b> IV proposed there would be no relationship between student personality orientation and reading achievement in the three treatment conditions. Students were classified as having either internal or external loci of reinforcement control based upon their Rotter I-E Scale scores. To test these hypotheses variations of the analysis of variance test were used. When an analysis of covariance was used the pretest score served as the covariate and the posttest score was the criterion measure. For Hypothesis I, total reading achievement was tested using an analysis of covariance. For the components of the total test score and the types of comprehension, two multivariate analyses of covariance were computed. For Hypothesis II two analyses of variance were computed for the pretest and posttest attitude toward reading scores. The attitude toward the course scores used to test Hypothesis III were also examined with an analysis of variance. For Hypothesis IV a two-way analysis of covariance was computed, using treatment by personality orientation, to analyze total reading achievement scores. In all cases the null hypotheses were not rejected. There were no significant differences in reading achievement, attitude toward reading or attitude toward the course among the treatment groups. There was also no relationship between student personality orientation and reading achievement in any of the treatment groups. Although all groups did improve in reading and displayed relatively positive attitudes toward reading and toward the course, the degree of student control experienced throughout the course did not result in any significant differences. Suggestions for further research include more control for the teacher effect and greater differences in treatment groups. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R
40|$|About the book: This book {{addresses}} possible {{applications of}} computer simulation to theory building in management and organizational theory. The key {{hypothesis is that}} modelling and computer simulation provide an environment to develop, test and articulate theoretical propositions. In general, computer simulation provides an experimental environment where researchers are able to play with symbolic representations of phenomena by modifying the model’s structure and activating or deactivating model’s parameters. This environment allows to both generating <b>hypotheses</b> to ex <b>post</b> explain observed phenomena or to ex ante generate distributions of unrealized events thereby envisioning areas for further empirical investigations. Under a methodological perspective, the volume investigates logics and techniques to design a research strategy grounded on computer simulation. In particular, the articles in the book concentrate on two different techniques, and philosophies, {{to set up a}} simulation study: System Dynamics, which is grounded on differential equations and feedback theory, and agent-based modeling. The book describes how computer simulation helps to look into research issues typical to strategic management and organizational theory. In this respect, such themes as firms’ diversification strategies, competitive strategy, rivalry and the impact of role dynamics on organizational performances are explored through the lenses of computer simulation models...|$|R
