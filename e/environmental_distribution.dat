(1) The distributions and changes of thermal environment in summer and winter are remained more uniform and stable in the rebuilt classroom than those in the old classroom as the results of providing insulation materials inserted in walls and roofs, air tightness of windows and buildings, a balcony, and pair-glass windows. Most pupils vote better evaluations for thermal enviornment in the rebuilt classroom. (2) The distribution of lighting environment in the rebuilt classroom becomes smaller than that in the old classroom because of shading incident sunshine by a balcony and additional light from illumination set at the ceiling of open space.

40|$|Biological atlases are, {{for many}} species, {{the only source}} of {{information}} on their distribution over large geographical areas, and are widely used to inform models of the <b>environmental</b> <b>distribution</b> of species. Such data are not collected using standardized survey techniques, however, and spatial variations in coverage (the relative extent or completeness of records) may lead to variations in the probability that the species will be recorded at locations where it is present (the "recording probability"). If spatial patterns in recording probabilities are correlated with key environmental variables, then biased estimates of the relationships between environmental variables and species distributions may be obtained. We outline a general statistical framework for modelling the <b>environmental</b> <b>distribution</b> of species using, known as Bayesian Image Restoration (BIR). BIR can be used in combination with any species distribution model, but in addition allows us to account for spatial heterogeneity in recording probabilities by utilizing expert knowledge on spatial patterns in coverage. We illustrate the methodology by applying it to maps of the recorded distribution of two plant species in Germany, taken from the German atlas of vascular plants. We find that estimated spatial patterns in recording probabilities for both species are correlated with key environmental variables. Consequently, different relationships between the probability of presence of a species and environmental variables were obtained when the species distribution models were parameterised within a BIR framework. Care must be taken in the application of BIR, since the resulting inferences can depend strongly upon the modelling assumptions that are adopted. Nevertheless, we conclude that BIR has the potential to make better use of uncertain information on species distributions than conventional methods, and can be used to formally investigate the robustness of inferences on the <b>environmental</b> <b>distribution</b> of species to assumptions concerning spatial patterns in recording probabilitie...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{relationship}} between physico-chemical properties, <b>environmental</b> <b>distribution</b> {{and effects of}} organochlorine compounds as a major class of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are discussed. The environmental fate of a compound includes its transport and dispersion in the environment {{as well as its}} accumulation and transformation in defined environmental compart-ments. Accumulation and transformation as the result of <b>environmental</b> <b>distribution</b> may have long-term consequences; this is indicated by the ultimate accumulation and long-term bioactivity of several widely spread organochlorines, and is clearly evident in the decomposition of chlorofluorocarbons in the stratosphere. Depending on the order of trophic levels biomagnifiaction factors of 10 000 up to 100 000 are encountered for persistent semivolatile organochlorines like 4, 4 ’-DDE, PCB congeners or some Toxaphene constituents. Mammals show intra-species pollutant transfer during the lacta-tion period. While the mother animal is partly depleting its body burden the calve accumulates in a critical period of its life via the milk a concentrated input of persistent organochlorines. A similar depletion phenomenon is also found for fish and crustacean which enrich in the eggs a substantial part of the accumulated body burden of the female...|$|E

30|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the stochastic SIRS epidemic model with standard incidence rate and saturated treatment function. We first prove {{the existence and}} uniqueness of a global positive solution for the corresponding limiting system (7). Then {{we investigate}} the persistence in mean and extinction of the stochastic SIRS epidemic system by using the Lyapunov method and the techniques {{of a series of}} stochastic inequalities. The biological significance of our results shows that the ability of the epidemic model to adapt to the external environment disturbance is limited, and the external environment disturbances may have important effect on the stability of the SIRS epidemic system. When the perturbations in the environment are small enough, the stability of the stochastic SIRS epidemic system cannot be destroyed, while large disturbances occurring in the environment can lead to the extinction of epidemic diseases. Therefore, this shows that the <b>environmental</b> <b>distributions</b> are advantageous to controlling infectious diseases. Our results significantly improve and generalize the corresponding results in recent literature. The developed theoretical methods and stochastic inequalities techniques can be applied to explore the high-dimensional nonlinear stochastic differential systems.|$|R
