However, the molecular mechanism underlying this remains to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the influence of palmitate, a major saturated free fatty acid in plasma, on the apoptotic cell death of cultured microvascular endothelial cells (EC) and retinal pericytes. Materials and Methods: The intracellular formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected using the fluorescent probe CM-H 2 DCFDA. DNA synthesis was determined by measuring [3 H]-thymidine incorporation into cells. <b>DNA</b> <b>fragmentations</b> of EC were quantitatively analyzed in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and DNA laddering was evaluated on agarose gel electrophoresis. Results: Palmitate increased ROS generation in microvascular EC. Furthermore, palmitate significantly inhibited DNA synthesis and induced apoptotic cell death in EC, which were completely prevented by an antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine. Palmitate up-regulated pericyte mRNA levels of a receptor for advanced glycation end products (AGE), and thereby potentiated the apoptotic effects of AGE on pericytes. Conclusions: The results suggest that palmitate could induce apoptotic cell death in microvascular EC and pericytes through the overgeneration of intracellular ROS, and thus {{be involved in the}} development of diabetic retinopathy...|$|R

This study aimed at deciphering the molecular pathways {{responsible for its}} activity. Our results showed that treatment of BCa cells with gamma-tocotrienol resulted in induction of apoptosis as evidenced by activation of pro-caspases, accumulation of sub-G 1 cells and <b>DNA</b> <b>fragmentations.</b> Examination of the pro-survival genes revealed that the gamma-tocotrienol-induced cell death was associated with suppression of Id 1 and NF-κB through modulation of their upstream regulators (Src, Smad 1 / 5 / 8, Fak and LOX). Meanwhile, gamma-tocotrienol treatment also resulted in the induction of JNK signaling pathway and inhibition of JNK activity by specific inhibitor partially blocked the effect of gamma-tocotrienol. Furthermore, synergistic effect was observed when cells were co-treated with gamma-tocotrienol and Docetaxel. Interestingly, in cells that treated with gamma-tocotrienol, alpha-tocopherol or β-aminoproprionitrile were found to partially restore Id 1 expression. Meanwhile, this restoration of Id 1 was found to protect the cells from gamma-tocotrienol induced apoptosis. Consistent outcome was observed in cells ectopically transfected with the Id- 1 gene. Our results suggested that the anti-proliferative and chemosensitization effect of gamma-tocotrienol on BCa cells may be mediated through downregulation of Id 1 protein. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We reported here the robust neuroprotection by minocycline against glutamate-induced apoptosis through regulations of p 38 and Akt pathways. Pre-treatment of cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) with minocycline (10 - 100 muM) elicited a dose-dependent reduction of glutamate excitotoxicity and blocked glutamate-induced nuclear condensation and <b>DNA</b> <b>fragmentations.</b> Using patch-clamping and fluorescence Ca 2 + imaging techniques, it was found that minocycline neither blocked NMDA receptors, nor reduced glutamate-caused rises in intracellular Ca 2 +. Instead, confirmed by immunoblots, minocycline in vivo and in vitro was shown to directly inhibit the activation of p 38 caused by glutamate. A p 38 -specific inhibitor, SB 203580, also attenuated glutamate excitotoxicity. Furthermore, the neuroprotective effects of minocycline were blocked by phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 -K) inhibitors LY 294002 and wortmannin, while pharmacologic inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK 3 beta) attenuated glutamate-induced apoptosis. In addition, immunoblots revealed that minocycline reversed the suppression of phosphorylated Akt and GSK 3 beta caused by glutamate, as were abolished by PI 3 -K inhibitors. These results demonstrate that minocycline prevents glutamate-induced apoptosis in CGNs by directly inhibiting p 38 activity and maintaining the activation of PI 3 -K/Akt pathway, which offers a novel modality as to how the drug exerts protective effects...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Beraprost sodium, a {{prostaglandin}} I 2 analogue, {{has been}} recently reported to exhibit beneficial effects on atherosclerosis {{in patients with}} diabetes. However, effects of beraprost sodium on microvascular injury in diabetes remain to be elucidated. We have previously shown that advanced glycation end products (AGE), senescent macroproteins formed at an accelerated rate in diabetes, caused pericyte apoptosis, thus {{being involved in the}} pathogenesis of the early phase of diabetic retinopathy. In this study, we examined whether beraprost sodium can protect against AGE-induced cytotoxicity in cultured retinal pericytes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Intracellular formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected using a fluorescent probe. DNA synthesis was determined by measuring [3 H]thymidine incorporation into cells. Apoptosis was determined by <b>DNA</b> <b>fragmentations,</b> which were quantitatively measured in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Beraprost sodium or forskolin, a stimulator of adenylate cyclase, was found to significantly inhibit AGE-induced ROS generation and the subsequent decrease in DNA synthesis in pericytes. Both treatments significantly prevented AGE-induced apoptotic cell death in pericytes. Furthermore, beraprost sodium was found to down-regulate AGE receptor mRNA levels in pericytes. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that cyclic AMP-elevating agents such as beraprost sodium and forskolin protected retinal pericytes from AGE-induced cytotoxicity through its anti-oxidative properties.

In this investigation, the toxic effects of tamoxifen were evaluated through cell multiplication, and cytological, surface ultrastructural, and biochemical studies on human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa) and/or murine erythroleukemic (MEL) c ells (BB- 88). Tamoxifen treatment demonstrated an inhibitory effect on HeLa cell multiplication at lower concentrations and toxicity at higher concentrations and longer treatment durations. The drug also triggered morphological and biochemical changes as revealed by light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), fluorescence microscopy, Nucleosome ELISA, and the DNA smear pattern. Cytological observations showed nuclear condensation, cell shrinkage, multinucleation, and apoptotic bodies. Surface ultrastructure of tamoxifen treated cells examined under the SEM revealed abnormalities such as membrane blebbing, holes, and cytoplasmic extrusions, all of which are characteristics of programmed cell death (apoptosis). Redistribution of the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) from the protoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane to the cell surface was identified using annexin V-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in tamoxifen treated MEL BB- 88 cells, a general feature of cells undergoing apoptosis.

Single- and double-stranded breaks were {{evident in the}} genomic DNA after intake of NPs (Morsy et al., 2016 a). Similarly, several previous studies reported DNA damage following exposure to NiO-NPs (Horie et al., 2011; Morimoto et al., 2011 and Dumala et al., 2017) and Co 3 O 4 -NPs (Alarifi et al., 2013; Uboldi et al., 2015 and Mohamed & Hussien, 2018). Due to their high surface area and subsequent increased reactivity, NPs can induce the production of ROS (Liu, Xu, Zhang, Ren, & Yang, 2010). Therefore, disturbances in DNA strand {{can be linked to}} the excessive generation of ROS (Rowe, Degtyareva, & Doetsch, 2008 and Kang, So, Simons, Spitz, & Ouchi, 2012). This was confirmed by the fluorescence microscopic images of the brain, liver, and kidney of the rats treated with NiO-NPs or Co 3 O 4 -NPs which demonstrated an overproduction of the intracellular ROS, in the current results. Moreover, the single- and double-stranded breaks of DNA can eventually trigger apoptosis (Green, 2011). This can explain the observed apoptotic DNA damages demonstrated by the electrophoresed pattern of genomic DNA in all tested tissues of rats administered NiO-NPs or Co 3 O 4 -NPs, individually. In the present data, the kidney and liver exhibited substantial <b>DNA</b> <b>fragmentations</b> as compared to the brain.
