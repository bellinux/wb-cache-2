5|$|During a Twitter {{conversation}} with fellow comic writer Joe Hill in 2013, Moore mentioned sales of Rachel Rising had fallen and <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> cancel {{it if they}} fell any further. Concerned fans responded by using the #SaveRachelRising hashtag {{in an effort to}} show support and promote the book. Afterwards the sales stopped falling, but they did not increase. In January 2016, Moore announced the series would end at issue 42.|$|E
5|$|The {{smell of}} fire brings back bad {{memories}} for Ben, who confesses to Clara {{that his father}} was a real barn-burner. He tells her how, at age ten, he warned a farmer {{that his father was}} about to set another fire. Ben's father got away, never seen again. Ben tells her he is leaving town, but Clara makes it clear she has fallen in love with him. An elated Will confides to Minnie that life is so good, <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> live forever.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} the sad state of public transit is a very basic one - the transit systems just do not offer a service which will attract people away from their automobiles. Consequently, their {{patronage}} comes very largely from those who cannot drive, either because they are too young, too old, or because they are too poor to own and operate an automobile. Look {{at it from the}} standpoint of a commuter who lives in a suburb and is trying to get to work in the central business district (CBD). If he is going to go by transit, a typical scenario might be the following: he must first walk to the closest bus stop, let us say a five or ten minute walk, and then <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> wait up to another ten minutes, possibly in inclement weather, for the bus to arrive. When it arrives, <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> stand unless he is lucky enough to find a seat. The bus will be caught up in street congestion and move slowly, and it will make many stops completely unrelated to his trip objective. The bus may then let him off at a terminal to a suburban train. Again he must wait, and, after boarding the train, again experience a number of stops {{on the way to the}} CBD, and possibly again <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> stand in the aisle. He will get off at the station most convenient to his destination and possibly have to transfer again onto a distribution system. It is no wonder that in those cities where ample inexpensive parking is available, most of those who can drive do drive.|$|E
50|$|Odo of Metz {{was also}} likely {{inspired}} by the 8th-century Lombard palace of Pavia where the chapel was decorated with mosaics and paintings. Although <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> travelled <b>to</b> Italy, {{it is unlikely that}} <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been <b>to</b> Constantinople.|$|R

25|$|Catherine Ending: In this ending, Vincent has Mutton summon Catherine {{so he can}} ask her to be his wife. In the bad ending, Catherine refuses. In {{the good}} ending, Catherine accepts when Vincent says he is {{prepared}} for what <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> sacrifice. The two live together in Hell despite the objections of Nergal, the King of Hell and Catherine's father. In the true ending, Vincent overthrows Nergal, becoming the King of Hell and ruler of a harem of succubi with Catherine as his queen.|$|E
25|$|These {{cautions}} being duly observed, I {{do not see}} how {{any person}} can devote himself too entirely {{to the cause of}} the Apostolical Church in these realms. There may be, as far as he knows, but a very few to sympathise with him. <b>He</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> wait long, and very likely pass out of this world before he see any abatement in the triumph of disorder and irreligion. But, if he be consistent, he possesses, to the utmost, the personal consolations of a good Christian: and as a true Churchman, he has that encouragement, which no other cause in the world can impart in the same degree:—he is calmly, soberly, demonstrably, SURE, that, sooner or later, HIS WILL BE THE WINNING SIDE, and that the victory will be complete, universal, eternal.|$|E
500|$|Amir tells Sohrab of {{his plans}} {{to take him back}} to America and {{possibly}} adopt him. However, American authorities demand evidence of Sohrab's orphan status. Amir tells Sohrab that <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go back to the orphanage for a little while as they encounter a problem in the adoption process, and Sohrab, terrified about returning to the orphanage, attempts suicide. Amir eventually manages to take him back to the United States. After his adoption, Sohrab refuses to interact with Amir or Soraya until the former reminisces about Hassan and kites and shows off some of Hassan's tricks. In the end, Sohrab only gives a lopsided smile, but Amir takes it with all his heart as he runs the kite for Sohrab, saying, [...] "For you, a thousand times over." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{following}} day, he {{was denied}} entry and flown back to the United Kingdom.

Yusuf, who repeatedly has condemned terrorism and Islamic extremism, stated [...] "I have never knowingly supported or given money to Hamas". [...] "At the time I {{was reported to have}} done it, I didn't know such a group existed. Some people give a political interpretation to charity.
