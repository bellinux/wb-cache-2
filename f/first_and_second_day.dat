After batting {{for much of the}} <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>second</b> <b>day,</b> Miller was rested from his bowling duties during the first innings and was not asked to roll his arm over until the third day, once the other Australian bowlers had done most of the damage after asking the hosts to follow on. At this point, Miller had scored 421runs in the first seven days of May without being {{dismissed}} by a bowler, and the media began to speculate that he could score 1000runs in one month, something that had been done on a tour only by Bradman. This was hampered when he was rested from the match against Surrey at The Oval after playing in three consecutive first-class matches. Australia easily won the match by an innings.|$|E
