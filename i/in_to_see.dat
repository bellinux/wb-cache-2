5|$|Early in most plots Bond {{is called}} <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> M, {{the head of}} the UK's Secret Intelligence Service (also known as MI6) in his or her office to receive his assignment. In several films, Bond {{receives}} the assignment outside the MI6 offices, or at a local secret office. Bond often finds M in a subdued state of agitation over a new threat to world peace. M typically shows confidence in the service's best agent but feels a need to rein in Bond for his risky methods and often chides him for his indiscretions.|$|E

5|$|American {{policy in}} the region was {{ineffective}} at the time. Carney's first task was to streamline reporting to Washington about ground realities in Haiti, as well as bringing in U.S. policymakers <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> firsthand what U.S. taxpayer dollars were funding in the country. Carney touted humanitarian successes of U.S. policy in Haiti, including success in preventing the spread of AIDS and providing lunch money to upwards of 500,000 Haitian students each school day. Microcredit financing efforts were also on display, as was the U.S. Coast Guard to monitor Haiti's coastline for Cali go-fast boats laden with cocaine shipments bound for the U.S. mainland.|$|E
5|$|As {{predicted}} {{through the}} actions of the boys in the film, there were numerous news reports of underage South Park fans engaging in unsuccessful attempts to gain entrance to the film at theaters. There were reports of adolescents purchasing tickets for WB's own Wild Wild West and instead sitting <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> South Park. This came {{as a result of a}} movie-industry crackdown that would make it tougher for children to sneak into R-rated films, as proposed by President Bill Clinton at the time in response to the moral panic generated by the Columbine High School massacre, which occurred two months before the film's release. South Park was cited, along with American Pie, as an explicit film released in the summer of 1999 tempting teens to sneak into theaters. When the film was released in the United Kingdom in August 1999, there were similar reports of the film drawing an underage crowd.|$|E
5|$|During Season 5, it is {{revealed}} that Wilson's homeless brother Danny suffered from schizophrenia since adolescence, {{which is what}} caused him to run away. Wilson blames himself for his brother's homelessness, having hung up on Danny right before he disappeared.

When Wilson finds out that Danny is in the Psychiatric Ward of New York Mercy Hospital , House offers to come with him to keep him company, noting that it could end badly.

5|$|From the {{apartment}} {{he shares with}} his hypochondriac mother Winifred, Seymour fetches his odd-looking, potted plant, but Mushnick is unimpressed by its sickly, drooping look. However, when Fouch suggests that Audrey Jr.'s uniqueness might attract {{people from all over the}} world to see it, Mushnick gives Seymour one week to revive it. Seymour has already discovered that the usual kinds of plant food do not nourish his strange hybrid and that every night at sunset the plant's leaves open up. When Seymour accidentally pricks his finger on another thorny plant, Audrey Jr. opens wider, eventually causing Seymour to discover that the plant craves blood. After that, each night Seymour nurses his creation with blood from his fingers. Although he feels increasingly listless, Audrey Jr. begins to grow and the shop's revenues increase due to the curious customers who are lured <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the plant.|$|E

25|$|The {{programme}} {{rates as}} one of the most watched programmes on UK television for every day it is aired. Viewership peaked on Christmas Day 1987 when an average of 28.5million viewers tuned <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Hilda Ogden leave the street to start a new life as a housekeeper for long term friend Dr Lowther (although there is some confusion as to whether or not this was actually the highest rating episode due to a special omnibus repeat of that week's episodes being combined with the original airing). Since EastEnders began airing in 1985 on the BBC, the two programmes have constantly battled it out for first place in the ratings.|$|E

Sharon is devastated. 14.8 million viewers tuned <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Roly's last appearance on-screen.|$|E
