5|$|In the First Council of Dvin (506), the Armenian Church {{broke off}} from the rest of Christianity by rejecting the dual nature of Christ, which was agreed upon in the Council of Chalcedon of 451. Thus the Armenians found {{themselves}} in direct confrontation with the Byzantine Empire. Emperor Justinian I persecuted the Monophysite Armenians, <b>forcing</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> leave Jerusalem.|$|E

5|$|By 1717, French colonists had {{established}} the fort and a trading post at Natchez, Mississippi. They also granted numerous concessions for large plantations, {{as well as}} smaller farms, on land acquired from the Natchez. Relations between Natchez and colonists were generally friendly—some Frenchmen even married and had children with Natchez women—but there were tensions. There were reports of colonists abusing Natchez, <b>forcing</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> provide labor or goods, and as more colonists arrived, their concessions gradually encroached on Natchez lands.|$|E

In a series of fierce engagements, Commonwealth forces gradually overran the Russian field fortifications, and the siege reached its final stages by late September. On 28 September 1633, Commonwealth forces took the main Russian supply points, and by 4 October the siege had broken.|$|E
5|$|In addition, the family's {{status as}} {{religious}} dissenters—not {{followers of the}} Church of England—attracted discrimination. Dissenters were not allowed into universities or the army, and were excluded by law from several professions.

5|$|In {{the extreme}} south, the six border battalions in the {{province}} of Limburg only slightly delayed the advance of the German Sixth Army; before noon the area had been overrun and the strategic city of Maastricht had surrendered, opening the way for the German feint offensive into Central Belgium. The Germans however, failed to capture the main bridge intact, <b>forcing</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> delay the crossing by the 4th Panzer Division until the next day.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} centuries, Zoroastrians faced much religious discrimination and persecution, harassments, {{as well as}} being identified as najis (polluted) and impure to Muslims, making them unfit to live alongside Muslims, and therefore <b>forcing</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> evacuate from cities and face major sanctions in all spheres of life. Zoroastrians have been subject to public humiliation through dress regulations, to being labeled as najis and to exclusion in the fields of society, education and work.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the {{inhabitants}} of the new French territory did not recognize the authority of the treaties imposed upon them. For this reason, rice farmers in Carabane experienced lootings and abductions by the Karoninka people. Troops led by Émile Pinet-Laprade attacked the Karoninka villages in March 1860, <b>forcing</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> submission. A period of calm ensued. While the Mandinka Muslims continued, illegally, to practice slavery and trade, non-Muslim villages tended to come together, accepting the Resident of Carabane as the arbitrator of their disagreements.|$|E
5|$|Regarded {{as one of}} the series' strongest Pokémon, {{it changed}} the way players {{approached}} the games by <b>forcing</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> find ways to counteract those using Mewtwo. Studies found the character popular with older male children, which contrasted with its counterpart and genetic source material, Mew.

5|$|The Samanid emir, Isma'il ibn Ahmad, {{launched}} an expedition against the Oghuz Turks in 893, <b>forcing</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> invade the Pechenegs' lands between the Volga and Ural rivers. After being expelled from their homeland, the Pechenegs departed {{for the west}} in search of new pastures. The Magyars had in the meantime invaded Bulgaria in alliance with the Byzantine Emperor Leo the Wise. Simeon I of Bulgaria sent envoys to the Pechenegs and persuaded them to storm into Etelköz. The unexpected invasion destroyed the unguarded dwelling places of the Magyars, <b>forcing</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> leave the Pontic steppes and seek refuge over the Carpathian Mountains. The Magyars occupied their new homeland in several phases, initially settling the lands east of the Danube and only invading the March of Pannonia after Arnulf of East Francia died in 899. They destroyed Moravia before 906 and consolidated their control of the Carpathian Basin through their victory over a Bavarian army in the Battle of Brezalauspurc in 907.|$|E

5|$|The bitter {{rivalry between}} Georgia Tech and the University of Georgia flared up in 1919, when UGA mocked Tech's {{continuation}} of football during the United States' involvement in World War I. Because Tech {{was a military}} training ground, it had a complete assembly of male students. Many schools, such as UGA, lost all of their able-bodied male students to the war effort, <b>forcing</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> temporarily suspend football during the war. In fact, UGA did not play a game from 1917 to 1918.|$|E
