5|$|As {{the others}} plot {{to destroy the}} {{creature}} with improvised gas bombs and flares, Corcoran flees the station and finds the creature in a nearby cave. After consuming Wyman's brain, the creature is now able {{to speak with the}} scientist's voice and has absorbed his knowledge. Corcoran asks whether Wyman's death was needed, but the creature insists it was a necessary sacrifice. The others arrive to destroy the creature, but hesitate because Corcoran will not step aside and let them throw their bombs. The creature insists it is not an evil monster, but an intelligent alien who has come to Earth to save the <b>human</b> <b>race</b> from its own self-destructive tendencies. It explains that Corcoran's body has been implanted with its embryos, which will allow the alien species to multiply and take over the <b>human</b> <b>race,</b> which the creature claims {{is the only way to}} truly save humanity. Upon realizing the creature is forcing the will of its species on the <b>human</b> <b>race,</b> Corcoran concludes the creature is evil after all and commits suicide so its embryos cannot come to fruition. The others then throw their explosives and kill the creature, which in its dying breaths warns that others from his species are waiting in space and will return one day to conquer humanity.|$|E

5|$|Stone brought Terry Hayes {{to write}} the {{screenplay}} entitled Return of the Apes. Set in the near future, a plague is making humans extinct. Geneticist Will Robinson discovers the plague is a genetic time bomb embedded in the Stone Age. He time travels with a pregnant colleague named Billie Rae Diamond {{to a time when}} Palaeolithic humans were at war {{for the future of the}} planet with highly evolved apes. The apes' supreme commander is a gorilla named Drak. Robinson and Billie Rae discover a young human girl named Aiv (pronounced Eve) to be the next step in evolution. It is revealed that it was the apes that created the virus to destroy the <b>human</b> <b>race.</b> They protect her from the virus, thus ensuring the survival of the <b>human</b> <b>race</b> 102,000 years later. Billie Rae gives birth to a baby boy named Adam.|$|E

40|$|Biological {{research}} on race {{has often been}} seen as motivated by or lending credence to underlying racist attitudes; in part for this reason, recently philosophers and biologists have gone through great pains to essentially deny the existence of biological <b>human</b> <b>races.</b> We argue that <b>human</b> <b>races,</b> in the biological sense of local populations adapted to particular environments, do in fact exist; such races are best understood through the common ecological concept of ecotypes. However, <b>human</b> ecotypic <b>races</b> do not in general correspond with `folk` racial categories, largely because many similar ecotypes have multiple independent origins. Consequently, while <b>human</b> natural <b>races</b> exist, they have little or {{nothing in common with}} `folk` races...|$|R
5|$|A federal {{government}} is only sensible, for Russell, when it has limited but well-defined powers. Russell advocates {{the creation of a}} world government made up of sovereign nation-states (Russell 1938:197, 230–31). On his view, the function of a world government should only be to ensure the avoidance of war and the pursuit of peace (Russell 1938:230-31). On the world stage, democracy would be impossible, because of the negligible power any particular individual could have in comparison with the entire <b>human</b> <b>race.</b>|$|E

5|$|Janek (Idris Elba) is {{captain of}} the Prometheus. Following Holloway's suggestion, he lands the ship near the {{structure}} containing the Juggernaut. During the expedition Janek remains on the Prometheus, observing the schematics which Fifield's spectagraphs develop. He seduces Meredith Vickers while Sean Fifield and Rafe Milburn radio for direction. Vickers and Janek recognize the Juggernaut as an Engineer ship. While Shaw prepares to join Weyland on the expedition to awaken the Engineer, Janek says that the Engineers had nefarious intentions with the biological weapons and he will {{do whatever is necessary}} to protect Earth's interests. When Vickers orders Janek to bring the Prometheus home, Shaw tells him that the Engineer ship is headed to Earth to release the black liquid and annihilate the <b>human</b> <b>race.</b> Janek decides to steer the Prometheus into the Engineer ship, and orders everyone to leave. Assistant pilots Chance and Ravel refuse and help Janek run the Prometheus into the Engineer ship, crippling it, sacrificing themselves, and saving the <b>human</b> <b>race.</b>|$|E
