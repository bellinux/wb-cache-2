50|$|The zinc-cerium {{redox flow}} battery was first {{proposed}} by Clarke and co-workers in 2004, {{which has been}} the core technology of Plurion Inc. (UK). In 2008, Plurion Inc. suffered a liquidity crisis and was under liquidation in 2010. However, the information of the experimental conditions and charge-discharge performance described in the early patents of Plurion Inc. are limited. Since the 2010s, the electrochemical properties and the characterisation of a zinc-cerium redox flow battery have been identified by the researchers of Southampton and Strathclyde Universities. During charge/discharge cycles at 50 mA cm−2, the coulombic and voltage efficiencies of the zinc-cerium redox flow battery were reported to be 92 and 68%, respectively. In 2011, a membraneless (undivided) zinc-cerium system based on low acid concentration electrolyte using compressed pieces of carbon felt positive electrode was proposed. Discharge cell voltage and energy efficiency were reported to be approximately 2.1 V and 75%, respectively. With such undivided configuration (single <b>electrolyte</b> <b>compartment),</b> self-discharge was relatively slow at low concentrations of cerium and acid. Major installation of the zinc-cerium redox flow battery was the > 2 kW testing facility in Glenrothes, Scotland, installed by Plurion Inc. The use of mixed acid electrolytes for the positive half-cell has been investigated as a mean to increase the kinetics of the cerium redox reaction in State Key Laboratory of Rare Earth Resource Utilization and the Jiangxi University of Science and Technology, China. Platinum-iridium coatings have shown the best performance as positive electrodes for the battery, while being less expensive than platinum electrodes. Charge-discharge of the system has been preliminarily simulated. Research on mixed acids continues and {{it has been shown that}} low concentrations of hydrochloric acid can improve the electrochemical response of the cerium reaction, while nitric acid additions had negative results. Hierarchical porous carbon as the positive electrode has yielded better performance than carbon felt in laboratory scale experiments. The zinc electrodeposition on the negative electrode has been studied using a Hull cell. Carbon paper has also been studied as an alternative material for the positive electrode. Graphene oxide-graphite composites have shown some promise as a better catalytic electrode material for the reaction of cerium in the positive electrolyte. A similar cerium-lead RFB has been proposed. Indium-modified electrodes have been suggested as an alternative to conventional graphitised carbon as negative electrodes. The Zn-Ce system has introduced the use of this acid to other flow batteries as a better alternative to sulphuric acid. The relationship between cell potential and current density has been estimated for a Zn-Ce unit flow cell. This permitted to rationalise the contribution of the thermodynamic, kinetic and ohmic components of the battery voltage and to assess the effect of increasing inter-electrode gap.|$|E

50|$|Zinc-cerium {{batteries}} are {{a type of}} redox flow battery first developed by Plurion Inc. (UK) during the 2000s. In this rechargeable battery, both negative zinc and positive cerium electrolytes are circulated though an electrochemical flow reactor during the operation and stored in two separated reservoirs. Negative and positive <b>electrolyte</b> <b>compartments</b> in the electrochemical reactor are separated by a cation-exchange membrane, usually Nafion (DuPont). The Ce(III)/Ce(IV) and Zn(II)/Zn redox reactions {{take place at the}} positive and negative electrodes, respectively. Since zinc is electroplated during charge at the negative electrode this system is classified as a hybrid flow battery. Unlike in zinc-bromine and zinc-chlorine redox flow batteries, no condensation device is needed to dissolve halogen gases. The reagents used in the zinc-cerium system are considerably less expensive than those used in the vanadium flow battery.|$|R

This paper presents studies on the brain fluid and <b>electrolyte</b> <b>compartments</b> of the cuttlefish Sepia, as a preliminary to characterization of the permeability of the blood-brain interface in this group. Sepia is shown to be a satisfactory experimental animal, and techniques are described for anaesthesia, cannulation, and tissue and fluid analysis. Our ionic analyses of body fluids are in general agreement with those of earlier workers. Analysis of brain tissue suggests that the extracellular space is 17 - 20 ml 100 g tissue- 1 (i. e. 17 - 20 %). Two large molecular weight tracers, 125 I-human serum albumin (HSA) and Blue dextran, give consistent values for the brain vascular volume of 3. 5 - 5. 5 %, slightly higher than in vertebrates. The HSA results further confirm that the Sepia blood-brain interface is relatively tight to proteins.

A schematic illustration of the cell design is shown in Fig.  1. The dimensions were; <b>electrolyte</b> <b>compartment</b> length 3.5  cm; centre compartment 10  cm; all compartments had inner diameter of 8  cm. Ion exchange membranes from Ionics (anion 204 SZRAB 02249 C and cation CR 67 HUYN 12116 B) separated the electrolyte compartments from the centre compartment.

40|$|The present work {{focused on}} {{evaluating}} the electrokinetic (EK) treatment of real contaminated sediments with toxic metals and {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs), using a big laboratory EK cell, periodic voltage and recently tested non-ionic surfactants. The {{results indicated that the}} “day on-night off” application mode of voltage, in conjunction with the selected solubilising agents, favoured the overall EK process. Arsenic, nickel and chromium exhibited the highest removal percentages, obtaining 83 %, 67 % and 63 %, respectively, while zinc and lead attained 54 % and 41 % at the maximum. Furthermore, in the experiments where the non-ionic surfactants were introduced in the electrolyte chambers, there was a major uniformly removal of PAHs from the entire sediment across the EK cell, indicating the high solubilisation capacity of the enhancing agents. Essentially, transport and in some cases removal of PAHs (particularly from sections adjacent to the <b>electrolyte</b> <b>compartments)</b> also occurred in the unenhanced EK run, mainly due their negative charge, their potential weak bonds to the soil matrix and to the periodic application of voltage.

40|$|It {{has long}} been {{suspected}} that parasitic reaction products created at one electrode of a Li-ion battery can migrate to the other electrode and influence its operation. In order to demonstrate that these “electrode-electrode interactions ” do occur, four types of coin cells were investigated. Two of these were Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 -limited and LiNi 0. 5 Mn 1. 5 O 4 -limited LiNi 0. 5 Mn 1. 5 O 4 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 (LNMO/LTO) “full cells”. In order to prevent electrode-electrode interactions, LTO/Li and Li/LNMO coin cells were connected by a wire joining the negative (Li) sides of the two coin cells making a simulated LNMO/LTO Li-ion cell with separate <b>electrolyte</b> <b>compartments</b> for {{the positive and negative}} electrodes. Virtually no parasitic reactions were observed at the LTO electrode in Li/LTO cells as evidenced by a coulombic efficiency near 1. 0000. By contrast, severe electrolyte oxidation, leading to charge end point capacity slippage and poor coulombic efficiency was observed in Li/LNMO cells. The behavior of the simulated LNMO/LTO Li-ion cells could be well understood and predicted based on the behavior of the half cells. By contrast, true LNMO/LTO Li-ion cells showed severe parasitic reactions occurring at the LTO electrode due to electrolyte oxidation products from the LNMO electrode migrating to the LTO electrode. Understanding such electrode-electrode interactions is critical in making long-lived Li-ion batteries and also for understanding the mechanisms governing the function of electrolyte additives. Similar effects, albeit at much smaller effective currents, can be occurring in Li-ion cells with standard positive and negative electrodes. © 2013 The Electrochemical Society.

40|$|A {{multistage}} electrophoresis apparatus {{has been}} invented {{for use in}} the separation of cells, protein molecules, and other particles and solutes in concentrated aqueous solutions and suspensions. The design exploits free electrophoresis but overcomes the deficiencies of prior free-electrophoretic separators by incorporating a combination of published advances in mathematical modeling of convection, sedimentation, electro-osmotic flow, and the sedimentation and aggregation of droplets. In comparison with other electrophoretic separators, these apparatuses are easier to use and are better suited to separation in relatively large quantities characterized in the art as preparative (in contradistinction to smaller quantities characterized in the art as analytical). In a multistage electrophoretic separator according to the invention, an applied vertical steady electric field draws the electrically charged particles of interest from within a cuvette to within a collection cavity that has been moved into position of the cuvette. There are multiple collection cavities arranged in a circle; each is aligned with the cuvette for a prescribed short time. The multistage, short-migration-path character of the invention solves, possibly for the first time, the fluid-instability problems associated with free electrophoresis. The figure shows a prototype multistage electrophoretic separator that includes four sample stations and five collection stages per sample. At each sample station, an aqueous solution or suspension containing charged species to be separated is loaded into a cuvette, which is machined into a top plate. The apparatus includes a lower plate, into which 20 collection cavities have been milled. Each cavity is filled with an electrophoresis buffer solution. For the collection of an electrophoretic fraction, the lower plate is rotated to move a designated collection cavity into alignment {{with the opening of the}} cuvette.

Solid-state grain coarsening and flux growth methods {{have been used to}} produce YBa 2 Cu 3 OT- = single crystals (1 - 6). As grain coarsening produces very small single crys-tals, more research effort has been dedicated to flux growth methods. Most previous attempts at YBa 2 Cu 3 OT-. ~ single-crystal flux growths have yielded oxygen deficient, sometimes tetragonal single crystals with low super-conducting volume fractions (4). Attempts to raise the oxy-gen content of the single crystals by oxygen annealing are hampered by low oxygen diffusivity in the crystals and mi-crocracking from the strain induced by the orthorhombic to tetragonal transformation. The low oxygen content of these single crystals is not surprising, as they are usually grown from melts containing excess cupric oxide at tem-peratures above 850 ~ It is likely that crystals nucleated and grown beneath the melt surface experience an envi-ronment of very low oxygen partial pressure because the melt will probably not be at equilibrium with the atmos-phere. The elevation of the oxygen activity in the crystal growth medium is a promising method of directly produc-ing orthorhombic single crystals.

40|$|Direct ethanol {{fuel cells}} (DEFCs) {{have been paid}} more and more {{attention}} in recent years due to the following advantages of ethanol: low toxicity, renewability and easy production by the fermentation of agricultural products [1]. Based on the present status of the electrolyte development, Naifon® membrane series is the most commonly used. It {{is well known that}} its conductivity is dependent on the water content in the membrane in a more a less linear fashion [2]. This necessitates sufficient water in the polymer electrolyte. On the other hand, water content can not be so high that the electrode will be flooded. Proper management of water through the membrane is indispensable for the desirable cell performance. Furthermore, ethanol can also permeate across Nafion® membranes, leading to a mixed potential and catalyst poison at the cathode, consequently causing the decreased cell performance and fuel utilization [3]. These both issues make it necessary to investigate the ethanol/water permeation behavior through membrane electrode assembly in PEMFCs. In the present work, water and ethanol crossover rates through membrane electrode assembly (MEA) were determined in a polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEMFC). The investigated MEA consisted of two Pt/C electrodes (40 wt. %) and a Nafion®- 115 membrane as the <b>electrolyte.</b> The anode <b>compartment</b> was pumped by ethanol aqueous solutions with different concentrations, and the cathode was supplied with high-purity helium at different flow rates to sweep off the permeated ethanol and water. The effluent from the cathode was on-line determined by gas Chromatograph (GC- 14 B, Shimadzu). The effect of the operation parameters such as the cell temperature, the carrier gas (He) flowrate at the cathode and the concentration of ethanol aqueous solutions on the ethanol/water permeation behavior was investigated. Based on the experimental results, {{it was found that the}} crossover rates of both water and ethanol increase with the increment of the operation temperature and the carrier gas (He) flow rate at the cathode. It was also found that the ethanol concentration had a significant effect on the crossover rates of ethanol and water. In the case of ethanol, the permeation rates presented a volcano behavior as the ethanol concentration increased, reaching a peak value when the ethanol concentration was 6. 0 mol/L, which could be attributable to the different swelling behavior of Nafion® membrane in different ethanol aqueous solutions...|$|R
