Charles <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> representatives of Parliament at the Crown Inn in Uxbridge in 1645, but negotiations for the end of hostilities were unsuccessful {{due in part to the}} king's stubborn attitude. The town had been chosen as it was located between the Royal headquarters at Oxford and the Parliamentary stronghold of London.|$|E
25|$|The {{visions of}} the Virgin Mary {{appearing}} to three shepherd children at Cova da Iria, in Fátima, Portugal, in 1917 were declared worthy of belief by the Catholic Church in 1930. Seven popes — Pius XII, John XXIII, Paul VI, John Paul I, John Paul II, Benedict XVI and Francis — have supported the Fátima messages as supernatural. John Paul <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> Sister Lúcia on July 11, 1977, {{while he was still}} Cardinal Patriarch of Venice. He reported being deeply moved by the experience and vowed to perform the Consecration of Russia as Lucia said Mary had asked. John Paul II was particularly attached to Fátima and credited Our Lady of Fátima with saving his life after he was shot in Rome on the Feast Day of Our Lady of Fátima in May 1981. He donated the bullet that wounded him on that day to the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima. Pope Paul VI sent a Golden Rose to the shrine in 1964, and Benedict XVI, on May 13, 2010, prayed in the Chapel of the Apparitions at the shrine and gave a second Golden Rose to Our Lady of Fátima. Before a gathering of more than 500,000 pilgrims, he spoke of the Fátima prophecy about the triumph of the Immaculate Heart of Mary.|$|E

500|$|Frederick Treves {{first met}} Merrick that November {{at a private}} viewing, before Norman opened the shop for the day.

[...] The viewing lasted no more than 15 minutes after which Treves returned to work. Later that day, he sent Tuckett back to the shop to ask if Merrick might be willing to come to the hospital for an examination. Norman and Merrick agreed. To enable him to travel the short distance without drawing undue attention, Merrick wore a costume consisting of an oversized black cloak and a brown cap with a burlap sack that covered his face, and rode in a cab hired by Treves.|$|E

Reynolds said, [...] "I've known about 'Green Lantern' my whole life, but I've never really followed it before. I {{fell in love with the}} character when <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> Martin Campbell". Reynolds called the film [...] "an origin story to a certain degree, but it's not a labored origin story, where the movie begins in the third act. The movie starts when it starts. We find out Hal is the guy fairly early on, and the adventure begins". Alternatively Chris Pine and Sam Worthington had been in discussions for the role. Bradley Cooper, Jared Leto and Justin Timberlake were other top contenders, while Brian Austin Green, a Green Lantern fan, campaigned for the part, but ultimately did not audition.|$|E
500|$|Paramount's {{vice-president}} of music Joel Sill took a liking to a 28-year-old composer named James Horner, feeling that his demo tapes {{stood out from}} generic film music. Horner was introduced to Bennett, Meyer and Salin. [...] Horner said that [...] " [...] {{did not want the}} kind of score they had gotten before. They did not want a John Williams score, per se. They wanted something different, more modern." [...] When asked about how he landed the assignment, the composer replied that [...] "the producers loved my work for Wolfen, and had heard my music for several other projects, and I think, so far as I've been told, they liked my versatility very much. I wanted the assignment, and <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> them, we all got along well, they were impressed with my music, and that's how it happened." [...] Horner agreed with the producers' expectations and agreed to begin work in mid-January 1982.|$|E
500|$|Most of the game's soundtrack is non-lyrical ambient music {{composed}} by Kelly Bailey and Mike Morasky, somewhat dark and mysterious {{to match the}} mood of the environments. The closing credits song, [...] "Still Alive", was written by Jonathan Coulton and sung by Ellen McLain (a classically trained operatic soprano) as the GLaDOS character. A brief instrumental version of Still Alive is played in an uptempo Latin style over radios in-game. Wolpaw notes that Coulton was invited to Valve a year before the release of Portal, though it was not yet clear where Coulton would contribute. [...] "Once Kim [...] and <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> him, it quickly became apparent that he had the perfect sensibility to write a song for GLaDOS." [...] The use of the song over the closing credits was based on a similar concept from the game God Hand, one of Wolpaw's favorite titles. The song was released as a free downloadable song for the music video game Rock Band on April 1, 2008. The soundtrack for Portal was released as a part of The Orange Box Original Soundtrack and includes both GLaDOS's in-game rendition and Coulton's vocal mix of [...] "Still Alive".|$|E

500|$|Straczynski {{described}} specific {{visual cues}} in the screenplay, {{such as in}} Sanford Clark's confession scene. Clark's flashback to a falling axe is juxtaposed with the crumbling ash from Detective Ybarra's cigarette. The image served two purposes: it was an aesthetic correlation between the axe and the cigarette, and it suggested that Ybarra was so shocked by Clark's confession {{that he had not}} moved or even smoked in the 10 minutes Clark took to tell his story. As with most of the cues, Eastwood shot the scene as written. To ensure the veracity of the story, Straczynski incorporated quotes from the historical record, including court testimony, into the dialogue. He also included photocopies of news clippings every 15–20 pages in the script to remind people the story was a true one. So the credits could present the film as [...] "a true story" [...] rather than as [...] "based on" [...] one, Straczynski went through the script with Universal's legal department, providing attribution for every scene. Straczynski believed the only research error he made was in a scene that referenced Scrabble, pre-dating its appearance on the market by two years. He changed the reference to a crossword puzzle. He did not alter the shooting script any further from his first draft; though Straczynski had written two more drafts for Howard, Eastwood insisted the first draft be filmed as he felt it had the clearest voice of the three. Straczynski said, [...] "Clint's funny—if he likes it, he'll do it, that's the end of the discussion. When <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> him to ask, 'Do you want any changes, do you want any things cut, added to, subtracted from, whatever', he said, 'No. The draft is fine. Let's shoot the draft.|$|E

We talked for three hours, and the result was deletion of 'screw' and retention of 'hump the hostess', but I was uneasy over the meeting." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{announcing his}} {{resignation}} from the Bush Administration, Rove appeared on Fox News Sunday and Meet the Press, and discussed {{his role in}} the Plame affair. According to Rove, he didn't believe he was a confirming source for Robert Novak and Matt Cooper with regard to Plame. Rove also reiterated that he first learned of Plame from another reporter, though would not disclose which reporter. Rove told Gregory [...] "I acted in an appropriate manner, made all the appropriate individuals aware of my contact. <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> the FBI right at the beginning of this, told them everything.

Uganda had just had the United Nations try to pressure them into passing pro-homosexual legislation in order to obtain a large sum of money offered to them (a bribe). They responded with this legislation in order to stop the strong arm tactics of the pro-homosexual western influence. Would to God American leaders had enough integrity to not be bribed or badgered into compliance. Although I knew the situation was being misrepresented, I didn't feel qualified to deal with this personally. But Leland Shores who runs our office in Kampala, Uganda is well aware of the details and has written a response worthy of everyone who has an interest in this reading. He has included a letter from over 200 Ugandan Christian leaders explaining the situation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nick was not {{away from}} Walford for long. In 1991, he {{returned}} with a heroin addiction but Dot initially shunned him and ignored his pleas for help. It was only after discovering Charlie had died that Nick was her only family left and was determined to reform him. Discussing the storyline, Altman has said: [...] "I found the heroin addiction quite exhausting actually, because I grew a really thick beard and my hair was always really filthy. When I was shooting those scenes <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> {{a guy who was}} an addict, and he told me things that you go through, like you can’t relax when you’re trying to come off it. You can‘t sleep so you drink loads of alcohol to try and kill the pain. The clock barely seems to move. For me as an actor, they really let me go as far as I could on that. We had letters as well from people saying how it‘s put them off heroin for life, so I guess we did a good job." [...] As the plot unfolded, Dot tried to curtail Nick's addiction by locking him in his room and forcing him to go cold turkey with the help of Pete Beale. During this period, The Queen Victoria landlord Eddie Royle is murdered. The murder was the key storyline of the show during the autumn of 1991. The episode Eddie was murdered was written by Tony McHale, it finished with a cliffhanger featuring Clyde Tavernier in the gardens standing over Eddie's body and holding a knife, which Nick witnessed from his bedroom window. Nick tells the police what he saw, leading to Clyde going on the run with the help of Michelle Fowler. Joe Wallace eventually came forward, saying he saw Nick out on the square on the night of Eddie’s murder, having escaped his room and climbed down a drain pipe. Nick confesses to Dot that he was responsible but insists that it was an accident. Nick is subsequently arrested and charged with Eddie’s murder and he stands trial in January 1993. A week's worth of episodes were devoted to the trial, and were all written by Tony Jordan. To present the story of Nick's trial the programme-makers themselves had to review the evidence and watch the episodes leading up to the death of Eddie. In the end, although it was clear that Nick was responsible for stabbing Eddie, it was not clear that it was murder and the jury returned a verdict of not guilty. Altman summarised: [...] "Through having a really good defence and lying his head off once again, he got away with murder".|$|E
