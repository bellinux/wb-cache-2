5|$|The Serine-Histidine-Aspartate motif {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{thoroughly}} characterised catalytic motifs in biochemistry. The triad is exemplified by chymotrypsin, a model serine protease from the PA superfamily which uses its triad to hydrolyse protein backbones. The aspartate is hydrogen bonded to the <b>histidine,</b> increasing the pKa of its imidazole nitrogen from 7 to around 12. This allows the <b>histidine</b> to act as a powerful general base and to activate the serine nucleophile. It also has an oxyanion hole consisting of several backbone amides which stabilises charge build-up on intermediates. The <b>histidine</b> base aids the first leaving group by donating a proton, and also activates the hydrolytic water substrate by abstracting a proton as the remaining OH− attacks the acyl-enzyme intermediate.|$|E
5|$|The triad of {{cytomegalovirus}} protease uses <b>histidine</b> as {{both the}} acid and base triad members. Removing the acid <b>histidine</b> results in only a 10-fold activity loss (compared to >10,000-fold when aspartate is removed from chymotrypsin). This triad has been interpreted as a possible way of generating a less active enzyme to control cleavage rate.|$|E
5|$|In proteins, Zinc ions {{are often}} coordinated to the amino acid side chains of aspartic acid, glutamic acid, {{cysteine}} and <b>histidine.</b> The theoretical and computational description of this zinc binding in proteins (as {{well as that}} of other transition metals) is difficult.|$|E
50|$|The {{active site}} of each RPE65 active site {{contains}} an Fe(II) cofactor bound by four <b>histidines</b> (His180, His241, His313, and His527), each contributed by a separate blade on the beta-propeller structure. Three {{of the four}} <b>histidines</b> are coordinated to nearby glutamic acid residues (Glu148, Glu417, and Glu469), which are thought to help position the <b>histidines</b> to bind the iron cofactor in an octahedral geometry. Phe103, Thr147, and Glu148 surround the active site where they help stabilize the carbocation intermediate and increase the stereoselectivity of RPE65 for 11-cis-retinol over 13-cis-retinol.|$|R
40|$|The Photosystem I complex catalyses the {{transfer}} of an electron from lumenal plastocyanin to stromal ferredoxin, using the energy of an absorbed photon. The initial photochemical event is {{the transfer}} of an electron from the excited state of P 700, a pair of chlorophylls, to a monomer chlorophyll serving as the primary electron acceptor. We have performed a systematic survey of conserved <b>histidines</b> {{in the last six}} transmembrane segments of the related polytopic membrane proteins PsaA and PsaB in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. These <b>histidines,</b> which are present in analogous positions in both proteins, were changed to glutamine or leucine by site-directed mutagenesis. Double mutants in which both <b>histidines</b> had been changed to glutamine were screened for changes in the characteristics of P 700 using electron paramagnetic resonance, Fourier transform infrared and visible spectroscopy. Only mutations in the <b>histidines</b> of helix 10 (PsaA-His 676 and PsaB-His 656) resulted in changes in spectroscopic properties of P 700, leading us to conclude that these <b>histidines</b> are most likely the axial ligands to the P 700 chlorophylls...|$|R

5|$|The acidic triad member forms a {{hydrogen}} {{bond with the}} basic residue. This aligns the basic residue by restricting its side-chain rotation, and polarises it by stabilising its positive charge. Two amino acids have acidic side chains at physiological pH (aspartate or glutamate) {{and so are the}} most commonly used for this triad member. Cytomegalovirus protease uses a pair of histidines, one as the base, as usual, and one as the acid. The second <b>histidine</b> is not as effective an acid as the more common aspartate or glutamate, leading to a lower catalytic efficiency. In some enzymes, the acid member of the triad is less necessary and some act only as a dyad. For example, papain uses asparagine as its third triad member which orients the <b>histidine</b> base but does not act as an acid. Similarly, hepatitis A virus protease contains an ordered water in the position where an acid residue should be.|$|E
5|$|Threonine proteases use {{the amino}} acid {{threonine}} as their catalytic nucleophile. Unlike cysteine and serine, threonine is a secondary alcohol (i.e. has a methyl group). The methyl group of threonine greatly restricts the possible orientations of triad and substrate, as the methyl clashes {{with either the}} enzyme backbone or the <b>histidine</b> base. Consequently, most threonine proteases use an N-terminal threonine {{in order to avoid}} such steric clashes.|$|E
5|$|Threonine proteases use {{the amino}} acid {{threonine}} as their catalytic nucleophile. Unlike cysteine and serine, threonine is a secondary hydroxyl (i.e. has a methyl group). This methyl group greatly restricts the possible orientations of triad and substrate as the methyl clashes {{with either the}} enzyme backbone or <b>histidine</b> base. Consequently, the catalytic residue of a threonine protease is located at it N-terminus.|$|E
40|$|Low pH has {{a strong}} {{stabilising}} effect on the fibrillar assembly of amyloid β, which is associated with Alzheimer's disease. The stabilising effect is already pronounced at pH 6. 0, suggesting that protonation of <b>histidines</b> might mediate this effect. Through the systematic substitution of the three native <b>histidines</b> in Aβ for alanines, we have evaluated their role in fibril stability. Using surface plasmon resonance, we show that at neutral pH the fibrillar forms of all His-Ala variants are destabilised {{by a factor of}} 4 - 12 compared to wild-type Aβ. However, none of the His-Ala Aβ variants impair the stabilising effect of the fibril at low pH. Alternative title: The role of <b>histidines</b> in amyloid beta fibril assembly</p...|$|R

40|$|The flavivirus {{membrane}} fusion machinery, {{like that}} of many other enveloped viruses, is triggered by the acidic pH in endosomes after virus uptake by receptor-mediated endocytosis. It has been hypothesized that conserved <b>histidines</b> in the class II fusion protein E of these viruses function as molecular switches and, by their protonation, control the fusion process. Using the mutational analysis of recombinant subviral particles of tick-borne encephalitis virus, we provide direct experimental evidence that the initiation of fusion is crucially dependent on the protonation {{of one of the}} conserved <b>histidines</b> (His 323) at the interface between domains I and III of E, leading to the dissolution of domain interactions and to the exposure of the fusion peptide. Conserved <b>histidines</b> located outside this critical interface were found to be completely dispensable for triggering fusion...|$|R
5|$|Although 300 {{mutations}} of ATP7B {{have been}} described, in most populations {{the cases of}} Wilson's disease are due to {{a small number of}} mutations specific for that population. For instance, in Western populations the H1069Q mutation (replacement of a <b>histidine</b> by a glutamine at position 1069 in the protein) is present in 37–63% of cases, while in China this mutation is very uncommon and R778L (arginine to leucine at 778) is found more often. Relatively {{little is known about the}} relative impact of various mutations, although the H1069Q mutation seems to predict later onset and predominantly neurological problems, according to some studies.|$|E
5|$|Hemoglobin is {{an oxygen}} carrier {{that occurs in}} red blood cells and {{contributes}} their color, transporting oxygen in the arteries from the lungs to the muscles where it is transferred to myoglobin, which stores it until it is needed for the metabolic oxidation of glucose, which generates energy. Here the hemoglobin binds to carbon dioxide, produced when glucose is oxidized, which is transported through the veins by hemoglobin (predominantly as bicarbonate anions) back to the lungs where it is exhaled. In hemoglobin, the iron is in one of four heme groups and has six possible coordination sites; four are occupied by nitrogen atoms in a porphyrin ring, the fifth by an imidazole nitrogen in a <b>histidine</b> residue {{of one of the}} protein chains attached to the heme group, and the sixth is reserved for the oxygen molecule it can reversibly bind to. When hemoglobin is not attached to oxygen (and is then called deoxyhemoglobin), the Fe2+ ion {{at the center of the}} heme group (in the hydrophobic protein interior) is in a high-spin configuration. It is thus too large to fit inside the porphyrin ring, which bends instead into a dome with the Fe2+ ion about 55picometers above it. In this configuration, the sixth coordination site reserved for the oxygen is blocked by another <b>histidine</b> residue.|$|E
5|$|The base is most {{commonly}} <b>histidine</b> since its pKa allows for effective base catalysis, hydrogen bonding to the acid residue, and deprotonation of the nucleophile residue. β-lactamases such as TEM-1 use a lysine residue as the base. Because lysine's pKa {{is so high}} (pKa=11), a glutamate and several other residues act as the acid to stabilise its deprotonated state during the catalytic cycle. Threonine proteases use their N-terminal amide as the base, since steric crowding by the catalytic threonine's methyl prevents other residues from being close enough.|$|E

Four invariant <b>histidines</b> are found in two protein segments which span the membrane. In each, two <b>histidines</b> are separated by 13 residues. This would place them on the same sides of α-helices, and the protohaems could be sandwiched as bis-imidazole complexes between the two transmembrane segments. In this model the haems are located in different halves of the bilayer; the FeFe distance is about 20 Å...|$|R
50|$|The DAG/PMA-binding domain binds two zinc ions; the ligands {{of these}} metal ions are {{probably}} the six cysteines and two <b>histidines</b> that are conserved in this domain.|$|R
5|$|When {{deoxyhemoglobin}} {{picks up}} an oxygen molecule, this <b>histidine</b> residue moves away and returns once the oxygen is securely attached {{to form a}} hydrogen bond with it. This results in the Fe2+ ion switching to a low-spin configuration, resulting in a 20% decrease in ionic radius so that now it can fit into the porphyrin ring, which becomes planar. (Additionally, this hydrogen bonding results in the tilting of the oxygen molecule, resulting in a Fe–O–O bond angle of around 120° that avoids the formation of Fe–O–Fe or Fe–O2–Fe bridges {{that would lead to}} electron transfer, the oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+, and the destruction of hemoglobin.) This results in a movement of all the protein chains that leads to the other subunits of hemoglobin changing shape to a form with larger oxygen affinity. Thus, when deoxyhemoglobin takes up oxygen, its affinity for more oxygen increases, and vice versa. Myoglobin, on the other hand, contains only one heme group and hence this cooperative effect cannot occur. Thus, while hemoglobin is almost saturated with oxygen in the high partial pressures of oxygen found in the lungs, its affinity for oxygen is much lower than myoglobin in the low partial pressures of oxygen found in muscle tissue, resulting in oxygen transfer. This is further enhanced by the concomitant Bohr effect (named after Christian Bohr, the father of Niels Bohr), in which lowered pH (as occurs when carbon dioxide is released in the muscles) further lowers the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin.|$|E

The three resulting {open_quotes}snapshots{close_quotes} of possible structures show that their variable-domain interactions differ, reflecting their stabilities in specific solvent conditions. The critical residues involved in the observed solvent response are tryptophans and <b>histidines</b> located between the two variable domains in the dimeric structure. Tryptophan residues are commonly found in interfaces between proteins and their subunits, and <b>histidines</b> have been implicated in pH-dependent conformation changes...|$|R
40|$|The tetrameric M 2 protein from {{influenza}} A {{is one of}} {{the simplest}} pH-gated H+ channels known, offering the potential of structurally characterizing its gating mechanism. Since the only ionizable groups in the pore are four <b>histidines,</b> we investigated the stability and dynamics of all six possible protonation states of the protein by using molecular dynamics. We show that while all channel protonation states are surprisingly stable, only systems with two or more charged <b>histidines</b> are appreciably conductive. The structural switch, from a uniprotonated to a biprotonated channel, causes an electrostatic repulsion between the charged <b>histidines</b> that pushes the helices apart. This results in the formation of a continuous water file that conducts protons via a H+ wire. pKa calculations place this transition at a pH of 5. 6, in remarkable agreement with the experimental value. Since the conversion from uniprotonation to biprotonation occurs during endosome acidification, this explains how M 2 is activated in vivo...|$|R

25|$|When oxygen binds to {{the iron}} complex, it causes the iron atom {{to move back}} {{toward the center of}} the plane of the {{porphyrin}} ring (see moving diagram). At the same time, the imidazole side-chain of the <b>histidine</b> residue interacting at the other pole of the iron is pulled toward the porphyrin ring. This interaction forces the plane of the ring sideways toward the outside of the tetramer, and also induces a strain in the protein helix containing the <b>histidine</b> as it moves nearer to the iron atom. This strain is transmitted to the remaining three monomers in the tetramer, where it induces a similar conformational change in the other heme sites such that binding of oxygen to these sites becomes easier.|$|E

The near-infrared MCD spectrum exhibits a low energy maximum at 1600 nm which is also clearly indicative of bis(histidine) ligation of the heme iron.

40|$|Aquaporins {{facilitate}} {{the diffusion of}} water across cell membranes. We previously showed that acid pH or low Ca 2 + increase the water permeability of bovine AQP 0 expressed in Xenopus oocytes. We now show that external <b>histidines</b> in loops A and C mediate the pH dependence. Furthermore, the position of <b>histidines</b> in different members of the aquaporin family can “tune” the pH sensitivity toward alkaline or acid pH ranges. In bovine AQP 0, replacement of His 40 in loop A by Cys, while keeping His 122 in loop C, shifted the pH sensitivity from acid to alkaline. In the killifish AQP 0 homologue, MIPfun, with His at position 39 in loop A, alkaline rather than acid pH increased water permeability. Moving His 39 to His 40 in MIPfun, to mimic bovine AQP 0 loop A, shifted the pH sensitivity back to the acid range. pH regulation was also found in two {{other members of the}} aquaporin family. Alkaline pH increased the water permeability of AQP 4 that contains His at position 129 in loop C. Acid and alkaline pH sensitivity was induced in AQP 1 by adding <b>histidines</b> 48 (in loop A) and 130 (in loop C). We conclude that external <b>histidines</b> in loops A and C that span the outer vestibule contribute to pH sensitivity. In addition, we show that when AQP 0 (bovine or killifish) and a crippled calmodulin mutant were coexpressed, Ca 2 + sensitivity was lost but pH sensitivity was maintained. These results demonstrate that Ca 2 + and pH modulation are separable and arise from processes {{on opposite sides of the}} membrane...|$|R
