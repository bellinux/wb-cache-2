5|$|McGann {{invested}} {{in real estate}} and financial holdings near his Shelbyville home during his career. At {{the time of his}} death, <b>his</b> <b>property</b> was assessed to be worth approximately $40,000 ($ in current dollar terms).|$|E
5|$|After Bardanes's retirement, Nikephoros {{formally}} dismissed him and confiscated much of <b>his</b> <b>property.</b> The other thematic generals {{who took}} part in the revolt were also dismissed from their posts, the metropolitan bishops of Sardis, Amorion and Nicomedia were punished for their support of the uprising by exile to the small island of Pantelleria off Sicily, while the soldiers of the Anatolian armies were left unpaid for a year.|$|E
50|$|Harrah trusted his top executives, {{and while}} he spent time walking <b>his</b> <b>properties</b> and {{demanding}} that things were perfect, he delegated authority and his managers appreciated his trust {{in their ability to}} manage <b>his</b> <b>properties.</b>|$|R
50|$|Rabe also {{opened up}} <b>his</b> <b>properties</b> to help 650 more refugees.|$|R
5000|$|Christison sank dams on <b>his</b> <b>properties</b> and by 1900 had 40,000 {{cattle and}} 500 {{thoroughbred}} horses.|$|R
5|$|Although it is {{believed}} that relations between Umar and Khalid, cousins, were always something short of cordial, both of them apparently harboured no ill-will towards each other. Upon his death, he bequeathed <b>his</b> <b>property</b> to Umar and made him the executor of his will and estate.|$|E
5|$|Bessas reappears in the {{campaign}} of 554, when he was appointed joint commander in Lazica with Martin, Bouzes and Justin. Gubazes, though, soon protested to Justinian about the incompetence of the Byzantine generals. Bessas was dismissed, <b>his</b> <b>property</b> was confiscated, and he was sent in exile among the Abasgians. Nothing more is known about him thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Buckner {{returned}} to Kentucky {{when he was}} eligible in 1868 and became editor of the Louisville Courier. Like most former Confederate officers, he petitioned the United States Congress {{for the restoration of}} his civil rights as stipulated by the 14th Amendment. He recovered most of <b>his</b> <b>property</b> through lawsuits and regained much of his wealth through shrewd business deals.|$|E

50|$|Plantinga's third {{critique}} {{challenges the}} very heart of simplicity. Metaphysical simplicity claims that there is no divine composition, meaning that there is no complexity of properties in God and that he is identical with his nature and each of <b>his</b> <b>properties.</b> There are two difficulties with this view. First, if God is identical with each of <b>his</b> <b>properties,</b> then each of <b>his</b> <b>properties</b> is identical with each of <b>his</b> other <b>properties,</b> so God has only one property. This {{flies in the face of}} the idea that God has both power and mercifulness, neither of which is identical with the other. Secondly, if God is identical with <b>his</b> <b>properties,</b> then, since each of God's properties is a property, it follows that God is a property as well. In this case, God has just one property: himself. The problem is that properties do not in and of themselves cause anything. No property could have created the world, and no property could know anything at all. If God is a property, then he isn't a person but a mere abstract object, having no power, life, love, or even awareness.|$|R
50|$|He {{entered the}} witness {{protection}} programme and was {{provided with a}} new identity. <b>His</b> <b>properties</b> were seized.|$|R
5|$|For the husband, {{the sale}} {{released}} {{him from his}} marital duties, including any financial responsibility for his wife. For the purchaser, who was often the wife's lover, the transaction freed him {{from the threat of}} a legal action for criminal conversation, a claim by the husband for restitution or damage to <b>his</b> <b>property,</b> in this case his wife.|$|E
5|$|Fortunately for Villiers, {{his case}} {{was not to}} be prosecuted with the utmost rigour. He was to some degree {{protected}} by the joint efforts of Boringdon's friends and the Whig George Tierney, as well as his own quick action in surrendering <b>his</b> <b>property</b> through writs of extent; and the delinquency of Joseph Hunt, Treasurer of the Ordnance attracted attention and saved Villiers from the full wrath of the finance committee. Their report on the matter noted that the writ of extent had been to the amount of £264,000, but only £91,000 had been raised from the sale of <b>his</b> <b>property,</b> and about £30,000 from securities and the bond posted for him when he took office. The committee recommended the abolition of the office of Paymaster of Marines and the transfer of its duties to the Treasurer of the Navy, a recommendation which was not immediately acted upon. Villiers was left, in Boringdon's estimation, with a debt of £1,500–2,000, an annual income of £2,000–3,000, and the property in Cranbourne Lodge.|$|E
5|$|He died in Warsaw on 20 January 1826, {{most likely}} due to a stroke. His funeral {{gathered}} 20,000 people, including the viceroy of the Congress Poland, Józef Zajączek. He {{was buried in the}} cemetery of the Camaldolese Hermit Monastery in Kraków. His testament left <b>his</b> <b>property</b> at Hrubieszów to its tenants, and much of his wealth went to various philanthropic initiatives.|$|E
5|$|On the Isle of Bute, the marquess {{expanded}} <b>his</b> <b>properties,</b> purchasing land in Ascog, Kilmahalmag and Etterick Mill.|$|R
50|$|Among <b>his</b> <b>properties</b> was Bodiam Castle, {{purchased}} from the Levett family in 1639, which Thanet sold for £6,000 in 1644.|$|R

5|$|In 1024, because Maymandi {{had gained}} {{a great amount}} of wealth during his career as a vizier, Mahmud removed him from his office, confiscated <b>his</b> <b>property,</b> and had him imprisoned at Kalinjar in India. While the nobles who opposed Maymandi urged Mahmud to execute his former vizier, Mahmud chose instead to spare Maymandi.|$|E
5|$|In July 1919, he {{returned}} Australia and was discharged {{a month later}} in August. Bruxner then returned to Tenterfield, sold his stock and station agency {{and went back to}} <b>his</b> <b>property</b> as a grazier. They eventually raised a family, having a daughter, Helen Elizabeth Bruxner, and two sons, James Caird and John Michael Bruxner.|$|E
5|$|In October 1677, Wheelwright sold <b>his</b> <b>property</b> in Lincolnshire, (purchased of Francis Levett, gentleman) to his {{son-in-law}} Richard Crispe, {{the husband of}} his youngest daughter, Sarah. In June 1679, Wheelwright was given, following a much earlier recommendation, an assistant, the Reverend George Burroughs, who later became the only minister executed during the Salem witch trials.|$|E
50|$|After World War II, <b>his</b> <b>properties</b> and {{belongings}} {{would be}} confiscated {{and his family}} deported. He died in Shkodër in 11.02.1964.|$|R
25|$|Kerry Packer {{was also}} one of Australia's largest landholders. In 2003 a deposit of rubies was {{discovered}} on one of <b>his</b> <b>properties.</b>|$|R
50|$|As Teophylaktos went {{bankrupt}} in 1917, all <b>his</b> <b>properties</b> were confiscated, among them his mansion. The building {{was acquired by}} the Nemlioğlu family.|$|R
5|$|The plot {{revolves}} around Padayappa (Rajinikanth), {{a mechanical engineer}} whose father (Sivaji Ganesan) gives up <b>his</b> <b>property</b> to his foster brother (Manivannan), and then dies of shock soon after. Neelambari (Ramya Krishnan) initially loves Padayappa, but plans to humiliate him after his family humiliates her father (Radha Ravi). The rest of the plot deals with Padayappa overcoming all the obstacles placed by Neelambari.|$|E
5|$|This, in turn, {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of even greater excesses; to pay the Spartan garrison's wages, Critias and the leaders ordered each of the Thirty to arrest and execute a metic, or resident alien, and confiscate <b>his</b> <b>property.</b> Theramenes, protesting that this action was worse than the worst excesses of the democracy, refused to follow the order.|$|E
5|$|With {{regard to}} the law of inheritance, the Quran {{specifies}} that fixed portions of the deceased's estate must be left to the so-called Quranic heirs. Generally, female heirs receive half the portion of male heirs. A Sunni Muslim can bequeath a maximum of a third of <b>his</b> <b>property</b> to non-Quranic heirs. The residue is divided between agnatic heirs.|$|E

5|$|A series frontiersmen {{assemblies}} {{were held}} {{over several years}} across the Willamette Valley, with many on the French Prairie at Champoeg. The death of prominent settler Ewing Young on 9 February 1841, who left neither a will or had an heir in Oregon Country, left the future of <b>his</b> <b>property</b> uncertain. Jason Lee chaired the first meeting organised {{to discuss the matter}} on the 17th. He proposed the creation of an authority over the pioneers centered on a governor. French-Canadian settlers blocked the measure and instead a probate judge and a few other positions were appointed.|$|E
5|$|Alastair Hudson, Professor of Equity and Law at Queen Mary, University of London, {{suggests}} {{the potential for}} a third class of secret trust. This is where the dying person is encouraged not to make a will so that <b>his</b> <b>property</b> passes to the next-of-kin, on the agreement that the next-of-kin give effect to his wishes via a secret trust. If this is the case, the next-of-kin would be obliged to hold the property on trust and fulfil the dying person's wishes.|$|E
5|$|All the {{criminal}} proceedings against him were canceled and {{the charges of}} blasphemy were officially withdrawn. Alcibiades was able to assert his piety and to raise Athenian morale by leading the solemn procession to Eleusis (for {{the celebration of the}} Eleusinian Mysteries) by land {{for the first time since}} the Spartans had occupied Decelea. The procession had been replaced by a journey by sea, but this year Alcibiades used a detachment of soldiers to escort the traditional procession. <b>His</b> <b>property</b> was restored and the ecclesia elected him supreme commander of land and sea (strategos autokrator).|$|E
