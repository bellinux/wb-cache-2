40|$|Conference PaperTime-frequency {{representations}} (<b>TFRs)</b> provide <b>a</b> {{powerful and}} flexible structure for designing optimal detectors {{in a variety}} of nonstationary scenarios. In this paper, we describe a TFR-based framework for optimal detection of arbitrary second-order stochastic signals, with certain unknown or random nuisance parameters, in the presence of Gaussian noise. The framework provides a useful model for many important applications including machine fault diagnostics and radar/sonar. We emphasize a subspace-based formulation of <b>such</b> <b>TFR</b> detectors which can be exploited {{in a variety of}} ways to design new techniques. In particular, we explore an extension based on multi-channel/sensor measurements that are often available in practice to facilitate improved signal processing. In addition to potentially improved performance, the subspace-based interpretation of such multi-channel detectors provides useful information about the physical mechanisms underlying the signals of interest...|$|R

Since 9/11, TFRs have been routinely used to restrict airspace for 30 nautical miles around the President, with a 10 nmi km radius no-fly zone for non-scheduled flights.

40|$|Transferrin {{receptor}} (<b>TfR)</b> is <b>a</b> dimeric cell surface {{protein that}} binds both the serum iron transport protein transferrin (Fe-Tf) and HFE, the protein mutated {{in patients with}} the iron overload disorder hereditary hemochromatosis. HFE and Fe-Tf can bind simultaneously to <b>TfR</b> to form <b>a</b> ternary complex, but HFE binding to TfR lowers the apparent affinity of the Fe-Tf/TfR interaction. This apparent affinity reduction could result from direct competition between HFE and Fe-Tf for their overlapping binding sites on each TfR polypeptide chain, from negative cooperativity, or {{from a combination of}} both. To explore the mechanism of the affinity reduction, we constructed <b>a</b> heterodimeric <b>TfR</b> that contains mutations <b>such</b> that one <b>TfR</b> chain binds only HFE and the other binds only Fe-Tf. Binding studies using a heterodimeric form of soluble TfR demonstrate that TfR does not exhibit cooperativity in heterotropic ligand binding, suggesting that {{some or all of the}} effects of HFE on iron homeostasis result from competition with Fe-Tf for TfR binding. Experiments using transfected cell lines demonstrate a physiological role for this competition in altering HFE trafficking patterns...|$|R

40|$|HFE {{is related}} to major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) class I proteins and is mutated in the iron-overload disease hereditary haemochromatosis. HFE binds to the transferrin receptor (<b>TfR),</b> <b>a</b> receptor by which cells acquire iron-loaded transferrin. The 2. 8 Å crystal structure of a complex between the extracellular portions of HFE and TfR shows two HFE molecules which grasp each side of <b>a</b> twofold symmetric <b>TfR</b> dimer. On <b>a</b> cell membrane containing both proteins, HFE would 'lie down' parallel to the membrane, such that the HFE helices that delineate the counterpart of the MHC peptide-binding groove make extensive contacts with helices in the TfR dimerization domain. The structures of TfR alone and complexed with HFE differ in their domain arrangement and dimer interfaces, providing a mechanism for communicating binding events between TfR chains. The HFE–TfR complex suggests a binding site for transferrin on TfR and sheds light upon the function of HFE in regulating iron homeostasis...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{proposes that}} whether period {{indicators}} are biased by timing effects {{depends on the}} objective of measurement. Several kinds of bias in the TFR are identified. Five reasons for measuring period fertility are distinguished: to explain fertility time trends, to anticipate future prospects, to describe trends, to provide input parameters for formal models, and to communicate with non-specialist audiences. Genuine timing effects are not biasing where period fertility is the explanandum, but are distorting where {{the aim is to}} estimate cohort fertility. Synthetic measures <b>such</b> as the <b>TFR</b> have <b>a</b> number of known defects. Alternatives to the TFR are available, and seem a more defensible solution to current problems than tempo adjustment.

Down-regulation of TfR by RNA interference decreases sensitivity to GA-induced apoptosis, further supporting TfR as the primary GA receptor. In summary, GA binding to <b>TfR</b> induces <b>a</b> unique signal leading to rapid apoptosis of tumor cells.

40|$|Public {{discussions about}} {{fertility}} trends and policies {{in developed countries}} refer almost exclusively to the period Total Fertility Rate (TFR), which is commonly misinterpreted as the "mean number of children per woman" {{as if it were}} a cohort measure of fertility. We argue that the use of this indicator frequently leads to incorrect interpretations of period fertility levels and trends, resulting in distorted policy conclusions and, potentially, in misguided policies. We illustrate this point with four policy-relevant examples, drawn from contemporary Europe. These illustrations show that the <b>TFR</b> (<b>a)</b> inflates the presumed gap between fertility intentions and realised fertility, (b) erroneously suggests a significant fertility increase in many countries of Europe after the year 2000, (c) often exaggerates the level of immigrants' fertility and (d) frequently suggests that family-related policies which led to shorter birth spacing in fact brought an upward swing in fertility level. We argue that there seems to be no policy-relevant question for which the period TFR would be the indicator of choice to be preferred over other existing measures, which range from measures related to future cohort size (total number of births) to sophisticated fertility indexes controlling for age, parity, duration since previous birth and tempo effect. Hence, there is a strong case for stopping the use of the period <b>TFR</b> as <b>a</b> one-fits-all fertility indicator which is now common practice...|$|R
