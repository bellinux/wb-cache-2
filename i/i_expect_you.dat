500|$|... "Unusual You" [...] is a midtempo electropop song, {{that has}} been {{described}} by Nekesa Mumbi Moody of the Associated Press as [...] "synth-centric". The song has been noted by John Murphy of musicOMH to be reminiscent of [...] "Gwen Stefani's quieter moments." [...] Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times commented that [...] "Unusual You" [...] "goes for that shimmering waterfall mood first popularized by Janet Jackson rather than strict Madonna-style workouts." [...] According to Chris Richards of The Washington Post, Spears's vocals in the song are transformed into [...] "a spectral [...]" [...] Lyrically, [...] "Unusual You" [...] talks about an experienced woman finding unexpected love, with Spears voicing the lines, [...] "Didn't anyone tell you you're supposed to break my heart? / <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> to / So why haven't you?." ...|$|E
500|$|A formal United States Navy {{board of}} inquiry, {{known as the}} Hepburn Investigation, {{prepared}} {{a report of the}} battle. The board interviewed most of the major Allied officers involved over several months, beginning in December 1942. [...] The report recommended official censure for only one officer, Captain Howard D. Bode of the Chicago, for failing to broadcast a warning to the fleet of encroaching enemy ships. The report stopped short of recommending formal action against other Allied officers, including Admirals Fletcher, Turner, McCain, and Crutchley, and Captain Riefkohl. Vice Admiral Ghormley was relieved not long afterward. [...] Vice Admiral Fletcher and Rear Admiral Noyes were relieved of their commands. The careers of Turner, Crutchley, and McCain do not appear to have been affected by the defeat or the mistakes they made in contributing to it. Riefkohl, however, never commanded ships again. Captain Bode, upon learning that the report was going to be especially critical of his actions, shot himself in his quarters at Balboa, Panama Canal Zone, on April 19, 1943, and died the next day. Crutchley was gazetted with the Legion of Merit (Chief Commander) in September 1944. Admiral Yamamoto signaled a congratulatory note to Mikawa on his victory, stating, [...] "Appreciate the courageous and hard fighting of every man of your organization. <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> to expand your exploits and you will make every effort to support the land forces of the Imperial army which are now engaged in a desperate struggle." [...] Later on, though, when it became apparent that Mikawa had missed an opportunity to destroy the Allied transports, he was intensely criticised by his comrades. [...] Admiral Turner later assessed why his forces were so soundly defeated in the battle: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{day after}} Jackson left the foster home, his dad said, [...] "Look, {{every day with}} me can be a day of heaven on earth. Or every day, I will tear your behind all to pieces. It {{depends on what you}} want." [...] Jackson's dad also told him, [...] "'I expect you to study. <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> to do well in school. <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> to obey me. And don't come back to me with excuses, because I want you to make {{something}} of yourself.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] said Mrs. Easterfield. [...] "After {{what you}} told me about him, <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>you</b> would {{recognize}} him the moment you saw him. But you did not know him; you did not do anything <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>you</b> to do; and I was very much disappointed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Welcome back again, Monsieur Campbell! You have {{returned}} sooner than <b>I</b> <b>expected.</b> <b>You</b> found, of course, that the difficulties were insuperable?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} <b>I</b> <b>expect.</b> <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>you</b> to say {{something}} without my prompting you. You {{know that it was}} outrageous for me to talk about your apparition without your leave, and to be the means of its getting into the newspapers." ...|$|R
2500|$|Hawking has {{estimated}} that he studied about a thousand hours during his three years at Oxford. These unimpressive study habits made sitting his finals a challenge, {{and he decided to}} answer only theoretical physics questions rather than those requiring factual knowledge. A first-class honours degree was a condition of acceptance for his planned graduate study in cosmology at the University of Cambridge. Anxious, he slept poorly the night before the examinations, and the final result was on the borderline between first- and second-class honours, making a viva (oral examination) necessary. Hawking was concerned that he was viewed as a lazy and difficult student. So, when asked at the oral to describe his future plans, he said, [...] "If you award me a First, I will go to Cambridge. If I receive a Second, I shall stay in Oxford, so <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> will give me a First." [...] He was held in higher regard than he believed; as Berman commented, the examiners [...] "were intelligent enough to realise they were talking to someone far cleverer than most of themselves". After receiving a first-class BA (Hons.) degree in natural science and completing a trip to Iran with a friend, he began his graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in October 1962.|$|E

6000|$|It {{immediately}} touched in Colonel Voyt {{the spring}} of a genial derision. [...] "That's just where <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>YOU</b> would! One always sees it come." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes. I knew that," [...] {{the other}} replied, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>you</b> would both {{remember}} that at present this house might almost {{be considered a}} public place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} looking forward to seeing you for days, and now I feel that this is not quite what <b>I</b> <b>expected.</b> <b>You</b> have changed," [...] he said.|$|R

6000|$|... "Certainly! How can <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> {{to help me}} {{unless you}} know what a serious reason there is for keeping Lucilla in the dark." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, she's alive. Very much alive, I believe. And she's {{coming to}} visit me, while you are here. <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> to be friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay," [...] said Pemberton, as {{they moved}} up to the hall, [...] "that reminds me to ask you why you are so late. <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>you</b> before Christmas Day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You were {{extremely}} irritating," [...] said the Vicar's lady, smiling, [...] "but I forgive you. After all, you {{paid more attention}} to what I said than <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>you</b> would." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Jacinta is {{not often}} rash. <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> doubted my willingness, but after your extravagant talk in the alameda, you felt you ought to ask." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{glad the}} other things won't keep, mother, or <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> would be wanting to put them all away. Isn't this toffee good, Bill?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sorry! <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> don't approve, but I felt I must {{let myself}} go. When people {{make me think}} about that confounded lagoon I get savage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, you've come at last," [...] {{she said}} in a sharp, querulous tone, almost before her husband had entered the room. [...] "Full ten minutes late, and <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>you</b> sooner than usual to-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You are {{not half}} as glad as <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>you</b> to be--and please don't think that I am marrying without love. I only {{admit that it}} is not the sort of love one reads of in novels, but <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> it is just as real.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have <b>you</b> dined, Tertius? <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>you</b> much earlier," [...] said Rosamond, who {{had already}} seen {{that her husband was}} in a [...] "horrible humor." [...] She seated herself in her usual place as she spoke.|$|R

60|$|GIRL. [Turning her blue-grey eyes on him] <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> are not {{the last}} at that. You see in them what you haf in yourself, I think.|$|E
6000|$|... "No pains at all," [...] he {{corrected}} affably. [...] "I have known {{all the time}} that you were here. In fact, <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>you</b> some while before you arrived, and sent my man, Paul, with a message." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, did you {{not look}} quite enraptured at breakfast when it was proposed? <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>you</b> every moment to ask the honour of my hand for the first quadrille, but I suppose you leave it for Philip Carey!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is exactly}} the {{question}} which <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>you</b> to ask. A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy." ...|$|R
