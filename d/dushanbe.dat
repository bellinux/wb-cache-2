25|$|Bukhara was {{the last}} capital of the Emirate of Bukhara and was besieged by the Red Army during the Russian Civil War. During the Bukhara {{operation}} of 1920, an army of well-disciplined and well equipped Red Army troops {{under the command of}} Bolshevik general Mikhail Frunze attacked the city of Bukhara. On 31 August 1920, the Emir Alim Khan fled to <b>Dushanbe</b> in Eastern Bukhara (later he escaped from <b>Dushanbe</b> to Kabul in Afghanistan). On 2 September 1920, after four days of fighting, the emir’s citadel (the Ark) was destroyed, the red flag was raised from the top of Kalyan Minaret. On 14 September 1920, the All-Bukharan Revolutionary Committee was set up, headed by A. Mukhitdinov. The government – the Council of People's Nazirs (Commissars) – was presided over by Faizullah Khojaev.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{confusion}} regarding Bout's military career {{although it is}} clear {{he served in the}} Soviet Armed Forces. Having graduated from the Military Institute of Foreign Languages, he is said to be fluent in six languages. These include Persian and Esperanto, which he had mastered by age 12, and in the early 1980s he was member of the Esperanto club in <b>Dushanbe.</b>|$|E
25|$|The lower {{elevations}} of Tajikistan {{are divided}} into northern and southern regions by a complex of three mountain chains that constitute the westernmost extension of the massive Tian Shan system. Running essentially parallel from east to west, the chains are the Turkestan, Zeravshan (Zarafshan), and Hisor (Gissar) mountains. The last of these lies {{just north of the}} capital, <b>Dushanbe,</b> which is situated in west-central Tajikistan.|$|E
25|$|Industry also causes {{pollution}} problems. A major offender is {{the production}} of nonferrous metals. One of Tajikistan's leading industrial sites, the aluminum plant at Tursunzoda (formerly known as Regar), west of <b>Dushanbe</b> near the border with Uzbekistan, generates large amounts of toxic waste gases that have been blamed for {{a sharp increase in}} the number of birth defects among people who live within range of its emissions.|$|E
25|$|There {{is also a}} small Korean {{community}} in Tajikistan. Mass settlement of Koreans in the country began during the late 1950s and early 1960s, after the loosening of restrictions on their freedom of movement which had previously kept them confined to Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. Pull factors for migration included rich natural resources and a relatively mild climate. Their population grew to 2,400 in 1959, 11,000 in 1979, and 13,000 in 1989; most lived in the capital <b>Dushanbe,</b> with smaller concentrations in Qurghonteppa and Khujand. Like Koreans {{in other parts of}} Central Asia, they generally possessed higher incomes compared to members of other ethnic groups. However, with the May 1992 onset of civil war in Tajikistan, many fled the country entirely; by 1996, their population had fallen by over half to 6,300 people. Most are engaged in agriculture and retail business. Violence continued even {{after the end of the}} civil war; in 2000, suspected Hizb ut-Tahrir members exploded a bomb in a Korean Christian church in <b>Dushanbe,</b> killing 9 and wounding 30.|$|E

25|$|On 22 May 2016, a {{nationwide}} referendum approved {{a number of}} changes to the country's constitution. One of the main changes lifted the limit on presidential terms, effectively allowing Rahmon {{to stay in power}} for as many terms as he wishes. Other key changes outlawed faith-based political parties, thus finalizing the removal of the outlawed Islamic Revival Party from Tajikistan's politics, and reduced the minimum eligibility age for presidential candidates from 35 to 30, effectively enabling Rahmon's older son, Rustam Emomali, to run for president any time after 2017. In January 2017, Rustam Emomali was appointed Mayor of <b>Dushanbe,</b> a key position, which is seen by some analysts as the next step {{to the top of the}} government.|$|E

25|$|After the Soviets {{returned}} to Lithuania in mid-1944, Poška was appointed {{as the head}} of the Library Department of Soviet Lithuania's Education Commissariat. For refusing the orders from Juozas Žiugžda to destroy books published before the Soviet occupation, Poška was arrested in June 1945 and sentenced to imprisonment in a forced labor camp in Siberia. He was first sent to a prison near Velsk, Arkhangelsk Oblast, and later to a forced labor camp in the Komi Republic. In 1948, his forced-labor sentence was replaced with a forced relocation to Central Asia without the right to ever return to Lithuania. His academic nature won him positions at several ethnographic museums of Central Asia in 1949–59, but due to his status of a political prisoner he could not assume leading posts and had trouble publishing his works. He worked at a museum of Petropavl in Kazakhstan (1949–53), the Museum of Osh in Kyrgyzstan (1953–57), Andijan Museum in Uzbekistan, and the State Museum of <b>Dushanbe</b> in Tajikistan (1958–59). He also took part in various archaeological expeditions in Central Asia. While in Osh, Poška studied caves, particularly the Rusha-Unkur Cave or the Eagle Cave, of the Sulayman Mountain and their petroglyphs. During archaeological excavations in the cave, Poška found an inventory of microliths dated to the Neolithic.|$|E

2500|$|In Tajikistan's dense river network, {{the largest}} rivers are the Syr Darya and the Amu Darya; the largest tributaries are the Vakhsh and the Kofarnihon, which form valleys from {{northeast}} to southwest across western Tajikistan. The Amu Darya carries more water {{than any other}} river in Central Asia. The upper course of the Amu Darya, called the Panj River, is [...] long. The river's name changes at {{the confluence of the}} Panj, the Vakhsh, and the Kofarnihon rivers in far southwestern Tajikistan. The Vakhsh, called the Kyzyl-Suu ("red water" [...] in Turkic languages) upstream in Kyrgyzstan and the Surkhob in its middle course in north-central Tajikistan, is the second largest river in southern Tajikistan after the Amu-Panj system. In the Soviet era, the Vakhsh was dammed at several points for irrigation and electric power generation, most notably at Norak (Nurek), east of <b>Dushanbe,</b> where one of the world's highest dams forms the Nurek Reservoir. Numerous factories also were built along the Vakhsh to draw upon its waters and potential for electric power generation. Due to the uneven distribution of water throughout Central Asia, the Soviets created a system in which Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan provided water to Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan in summer, and these three countries provided oil and gas to Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan during winter. After the collapse of the USSR in 1991, this system fell apart and a new resource-sharing plan has yet to be put in place. According to research conducted by the International Crisis Group, this is due to corruption and lack of political will; failure to solve this issue could lead to irreversible regional destabilization.|$|E

The 11th session of {{the summit of the}} Organization of the Islamic Conference held on 13–14 March 2008 in Dakar adopted resolution No. 10/11-P (IS). In the resolution, OIC member states condemned the occupation of Azerbaijani lands by Armenian forces and Armenian aggression against Azerbaijan, alleged ethnic cleansing against the Azeri population, and charged Armenia with the [...] "destruction of cultural monuments in the occupied Azerbaijani territories".

2500|$|His {{fourth and}} final Soviet trip was once more to Central Asia, spurred {{by the desire to}} reach Bokhara (Bukhara, Uzbekistan), the capital of the emirate which had been closed to Europeans until recent times. Maclean recounts how Charles Stoddart and Arthur Conolly were {{executed}} there in the context of The Great Game, and how Joseph Wolff, known as the Eccentric Missionary, barely escaped their fate when he came looking for them in 1845. In early October 1938 Maclean set out again, first for Ashkhabad (Ashgabat, capital of the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic), then through the Kara Kum (Black Desert), not breaking his journey at either Tashkent or Samarkand, but pushing on to Kagan, the nearest point on the railway to Bokhara. [...] After trying to smuggle himself aboard a lorry transporting cotton, he ended up walking to the city, and spent several days sight-seeing [...] "in the steps of the Eccentric Missionary" [...] and sleeping in parks, much to the frustration of the NKVD spies who were shadowing him. He judged it an [...] "enchanted city", with buildings that rivalled [...] "the finest architecture of the Italian Renaissance". [...] Aware of his limited time, he cut short his wanderings and took the train towards Stalinabad (<b>Dushanbe,</b> the capital of Tajikistan), disembarking at Termez. This town sits on the Amu Darya (the Oxus), and {{the other side of the}} river lies in Afghanistan. Maclean claimed that [...] "very few Europeans except Soviet frontier guards have ever seen it at this or any other point of its course". After more negotiations, he managed to cross the river and thus leave the USSR, and from that point his only guide seems to have been the narrative of [...] "the Russian Burnaby", a colonel , who rode from Samarkand to Mazar-i-Sharif and Herat in 1878. The following day he and a guide set out on horseback, riding through jungle and desert, and detained on the way by dubious characters who may or may not have been brigands. (Maclean, a proficient linguist, was hamstrung on entering Afghanistan by the lack of any lingua franca.) [...] They rode past the ruins of Balkh, a civilization founded by Alexander the Great and destroyed by Genghis Khan. [...] After a night in Mazar, Maclean managed to get a car and driver, and progressed as rapidly as he could to Doaba, a village half-way to Kabul, where he had arranged to meet the British minister (i.e., ambassador), Colonel Frazer-Tytler. Together, they returned to the capital via Bamyan and its famous statues. Maclean circled back to Moscow via Peshawar, Delhi, Baghdad, Persia, and Armenia.|$|E
