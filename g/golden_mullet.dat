40|$|Aim. For {{the purpose}} of the {{assessment}} of <b>golden</b> <b>mullet</b> reproduction scientists have studied <b>golden</b> <b>mullet</b> fish distribution in the Western part of the Caspian Sea and determined biological indexes of spawners and the state of gonads before spawning. Methods. Collection and processing of ichtyological data was carried out according with the “Guide on materials collection and pre-processing of water biological bio-resources of the Caspian basin and their habitat”. Histological preparations of ovaries at the VI-th mature stage were fixed in Buena’s mixture; microscopic sections of gonads were colored by sour rosein with the Mallory’s method. Results. The researches have shown, that during the period 2009 - 2013 the <b>golden</b> <b>mullet</b> fish migration to the Russian part of the Caspian Sea was started in spring. In 2012 - 2013 spawners with higher biological indexes than in preceding year were the basis of sexually mature of the population.

40|$|Background. Salted fish {{products}} are popular {{in many countries}} around the world. Salting {{is one of the}} oldest techniques for fish preservation, and is essentially intended to increase the shelf-life of the product depressing water activity by means of dehydration and salt uptake by the fish muscle. However, the current demand for salted fish is driven more by the flavour of the product than for preservation purposes. Vacuum-packaging represents a static form of hypobaric storage. It is widely used in the food industry because of its effectiveness in reducing oxidative reactions in the product at relatively low cost. Low temperature storage is one of the primary methods to maintain fish quality, based on the reduction in the rates of microbiological, chemical and biochemical changes. Material&nbsp; and methods. Fresh Golden mullets were rapidly beheaded, scaled, gutted and immediately washed with tap water then, samples were taken to the laboratory in ice box for chemical and microbial analysis of fresh fish, other samples were put in the brine (6 liter water and 2160 g salt was used for brine solution). After 14 days of brining, fish were taken out of brine solution and drained, then they were Vacuum Packed and labelled (each pack contained two fish about 1500 g weight). All the packs were stored in a refrigerator 4 &deg;C. Some quality aspects including Total Volatile Nitrogen (TVN), Peroxide Value (PV), Thiobarbituric Acid (TBA), Total Viable Count (TVC), Halophilic Bacteria (HB) and presence of Clostridium Botulinum were determined in fresh mullets, fresh brined mullets after 14 days of brining, and in (Vacuum Packed) VP samples stored at 4 &deg;C at intervals of 30, 60 and 90 days. Results. &nbsp; TVN increased from ten mg/ 100 g in fresh brined after 14 days to 30. 80 mg/ 100 g in VP brined <b>Golden</b> <b>mullet</b> after 90 days of storage at 4 &deg;C, PV increased after brining from 1. 50 meq/kg in fresh brined to 28. 90 meq/kg in VP brined <b>Golden</b> <b>mullet</b> after 90 days of storage at 4 &deg;C, TBA increased from 0. 07 mg MDA/kg in fresh brined to 0. 10 after 60 days and then, decreased to 0. 09 mg MDA/kg in VP brined <b>Golden</b> <b>mullet</b> after 90 days of storage and&nbsp; TVC decreased from 4. 70 log CFU/gr in fresh brined to 4. 40 log CFU/ gr after 30 days and then, increased to 5. 70 log CFU/gr in VP brined <b>Golden</b> <b>mullet</b> after 90 days of storage at 4 &deg;C, HB increased from 4. 55 log CFU/gr in fresh brined to 6. 30 log CFU/gr after 90 days of storage period at 4 &deg;C and exceeded the permissible level. Clostridium botulinum toxin was not detected in any of the samples throughout the storage. Conclusions. The results from this study clearly suggested that a combination of brining, vacuum packaging and storage at refrigerated temperature prolongs the shelf-life of <b>Golden</b> <b>mullet</b> to a great extent. Our findings revealed that the longest shelf-life was for VP brined <b>Golden</b> <b>mullet</b> stored at 4 &deg;C is 30 days...|$|E

40|$|The {{seasonal}} {{input and}} distribution of organic contaminants in the Mar Menor lagoon have been recently characterized in seawater and sediments, showing the significant impact of flash flood events. Mar Menor is a hypersaline (42 - 47 psu) coastal lagoon located in the Cartagena Field area at the South East of Spain subjected mainly to intensive agriculture, seasonal tourism and recreational activities. The bioaccumulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorinated pesticides (OCPs) has been also determined in bivalves, but no information was available about their accumulation in fishes. In this study the concentrations of PAHs, PCBs and OCPs in <b>golden</b> grey <b>mullet</b> (Liza aurata) and red mullet (Mullus barbatus) muscle were determined. Their spatial distribution throughout the Mar Menor lagoon was characterized considering 9 sampling areas and two different sampling periods, spring and autumn in 2010 for <b>golden</b> grey <b>mullet</b> and only one (autumn) for red mullet. PAHs and organochlorinated pollutants were extracted using specific Soxhlet procedures. After cleanup and purification steps the final extracts were analyzed by HPLC for PAHs, and by GC-MS for PCBs and OCPs. The higher concentrations of all pollutants were found close to main urban and port areas of this lagoon and in the influence area of El Albujón watercourse. PAHs concentrations (sum of 14 congeners) in both species varied between 1 and 20. 7 g/kg w. w. being pyrene and phenanthrene the most abundant ones. p,p’DDE showed higher concentrations than PAHs in <b>golden</b> grey <b>mullet</b> (concentration range: 0. 2 - 32. 7 g/kg w. w.), specially close to the main navigation channel between this lagoon and the Mediterranean Sea.

40|$|The {{following}} three species of grey mullet (Mugilidae) are recorded by Wheeler (1978) for {{the waters of}} north-western Europe: thick-lipped mullet, Chelon labrosus (Risso, 1826); thin-lipped mullet, Liza ramada (Risso, 1826) and <b>golden</b> <b>mullet,</b> Liza aurata (Risso, 1810).

40|$|The main {{objectives}} {{of this investigation}} were to test the effects of (i) the presence of periphyton substrates, (ii) rearing density and (iii) supplemental feeding with dry feed on the growth and production of <b>golden</b> <b>mullet</b> (Liza aurata) juveniles. Twenty-six 1 m 2 -cages were installed in a French marine pond from April till June 2008. Mullets were stocked in cages with or without substrate at a density of 0, 20, 40 or 60 individuals per cage. Each treatment {{was carried out in}} triplicate. In addition, 20 fish were put in three tanks and fed ad libitum with dry feed. The results showed that (i) although mullets were seen to graze on periphyton substrates, their presence did not affect mullet growth and production. In future studies, meshed substrates could be attached on hard structures to improve the efficiency of mullet grazing; (ii) individual growth was higher at low density due to a lower competition for space and food. Production increased with rearing density reflecting that food availability was not limiting in control cages; (iii) growth and net yield of mullets were lower in fed tanks than in natural ponds where food seemed to be more appropriate for wild mullet juveniles and where stress factors were lower. Finally, in contrast to the individual growth rate, the net fish yield in this experiment was greater than that recorded in other extensive and semi-intensive systems. It was equivalent to yields observed in other periphyton-based systems. Periphyton developed on the meshed walls of cages probably increased the natural productivity of the pond. As part of sustainable aquaculture development, the effluents of intensive farms could be exploited to produce periphyton on inflexible substrates and to rear mullet adults, which are more herbivorous than juveniles. This type of integrated system could be developed with other mullet species, such as Chelon labrosus or Mugil cephalus, whose growth rates are higher than L. aurata. Mullet production could be exploited by the sale of fillets and dried ro...|$|E

The ATP content of mentioned fish sperm is an important index of fish fertility determination of the sample’s ATP concentration was done by ultra sensitive bioluminescence method. ATP content of sperms were determined at two different sampling temperature (10 - 12 and 18 - 20 °C) and two different keeping temperature (4 °C and room temperature) for 6 h and also ATP content assayed until 10 days storage in the three extender types (glycerol, 0. 7 and 0. 65 % salt solution). Results of the present study showed that, ATP content of sperms, collected at 10 - 12 °C was 74. 04 ± 7. 22 %, in comparison to 18 - 20 °C. The ATP content of sperms during 6 h keeping at 4 °C and room temperature were 90. 26 ± 0. 91 % and 17. 17 ± 1. 49 %, respectively. Determination of sperms’ ATP content after 5 days keeping in glycerol, 0. 7 and 0. 65 % salt solution revealed that glycerol or 0. 65 % salt solution is better extender than 0. 7 % salt solution.

On sandy–muddy beaches, samples were collected using seine net and on deeper sites with rocky bottoms, samples were collected by using small »dip net«. Total length of body and total weight were measured. Stomach contents were analysed using inverted microscope. Prey frequency (%F), abundance (%N) and coefficient of empty stomach (%V) were determined. Also possible food competition between different species of mullet juveniles was studied, based on space and time overlap of their recruitment. Recruitment of <b>golden</b> grey <b>mullet</b> (length category of 15 – 20 mm in samples) lasted from October to January. Analysis of lenght–weight relationship {{in the area of}} estuary of Mala Neretva showed that population has a negative alometric growth.

Nonetheless, when facing life-or-death situations, {{it is not known}} whether schooling fish react to a threat following a random or a hierarchically-based order. Using high-speed video analysis, here we show that schooling fish (<b>Golden</b> grey <b>mullet,</b> Liza aurata) evade a threat in a non-random order, therefore individuals that are first or last to react tend to do so repeatedly over sequential stimulations. Furthermore, startle order is strongly correlated with individual positional preferences. Because school members are known to follow individuals that initiate a manoeuvre, early responders are likely to exert the strongest influence on the escape strategy of the whole school. Our results present new evidence of the intrinsic heterogeneity among school members and provide new rules governing the collective motion of gregarious animals under predator attack...|$|R
40|$|<b>Golden</b> grey <b>mullet</b> (Liza aurata) is {{a commercially}} {{valuable}} fish with great demand {{due to its}} delicious taste in southern coastal parts of the Caspian Sea. Genetic diversity of marine resources is of vital importance in their management and protection, as {{this is the first}} prerequisite for maintaining the consistency of populations in an inconsistent environmental conditions. In this study, we have used six microsatellite locations to investigate the level of genetic variation of Liza aurata in Gomishan and Miyankale regions in Golestan province. The results showed no conspicuous genetic variations in these two regions using Fst, Rst and AMOVA and accordingly a relatively high level of gene flow was found among the populations. Genetic variations in Gomishan (mean number of alleles per locus, Na= 14. 667, mean effective number of alleles, Ne= 10. 355, observed heterozygosity, Ho= 0. 905 and expected heterozygosity, He= 0. 894) and Miyankale (Na= 15, Ne= 10. 223, Ho= 0. 863 and He= 0. 892) were not statistically different. There were evidences for genetic bottleneck in the populations. Protection and restoration of habitats can help to increase the population size and decrease risk of vulnerability of the species in the future...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAn investigative {{biomonitoring}} {{study was}} carried out in a eutrophic coastal system with a moderate contamination by metals (Óbidos lagoon, Portugal), combining the evaluation of exposure concentrations with metals accumulation and oxidative stress responses in gills of the <b>golden</b> grey <b>mullet</b> (). Two contrasting seasons (winter and summer) were considered at three sites: Barrosa (BB) and Bom-Sucesso (BS) branches; Middle lagoon (ML). Data on the water column pointed to a higher metals and nutrients availability at BB that was reflected in the higher metal concentrations in gills, particularly in winter. Similarly, oxidative stress responses demonstrated a pro-oxidant challenge at BB (winter and summer), which was corroborated by an integrated biomarker response index (IBR). Metal concentrations in gills were higher in summer than winter, reflecting the increased environmental concentrations in combination with elevated metabolic rates. Catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), total glutathione (GSH) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) increases observed in winter at BB were related with metal accumulation, while summer enhancement of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), GST and GSH was associated with other stressors. Inter-site differences on the basis of IBR were more accentuated in winter. Gills can be considered as an important route of entry for contaminants and were demonstrated to reflect water contamination and are therefore useful in the context of environmental assessment...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDispersant {{use is a}} {{controversial}} oil spill response technique in coastal areas. Using an experimental approach, this study evaluated the toxicity of dispersant use upon juveniles of <b>golden</b> grey <b>mullet</b> (Liza aurata). Fish were exposed for 48 h to either dispersant only, chemically dispersed oil, mechanically dispersed oil, the water soluble fraction of oil or to control conditions. Following exposure and a depuration period, biomarkers were assessed in fish hearts, namely the total glutathione content and the activity of four enzymes (glutathione S-transferase, superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxides). Comparing biomarker responses between the different treatments, this study revealed that 48 h exposure to dispersed oil (whether mechanically or chemically dispersed) resulted in a toxicity that was still detectable after a 14 days depuration period. Comparing biomarkers responses after an exposure to chemically and mechanically dispersed oil, {{this study suggests that}} chemical dispersion of the oil slick would not be more toxic than its natural dispersion under certain turbulent meteorological conditions (e. g. waves). Furthermore, the results indicated that the heart could be a target organ of interest in further studies investigating the toxicity of hydrocarbons. This study, which has been integrated into the DISCOBIOL project (Dispersant et techniques de lutte en milieu coder: effets biologiques et apport a la reglementation), presents information of interest when attempting to provide a framework for dispersant applications in coastal areas...|$|R
