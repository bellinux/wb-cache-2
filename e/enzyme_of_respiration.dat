40|$|Cytochrome c oxidase, the {{terminal}} <b>enzyme</b> <b>of</b> cellular <b>respiration</b> in mitochondria and many bacteria, reduces O- 2 to water. This four-electron reduction process is coupled to translocation (pumping) of four protons across the mitochondrial or bacterial membrane(1); however, proton pumping is poorly understood. Proton pumping {{was thought to}} be linked exclusively to the oxidative phase, that is, to the transfer of the third and fourth electron(2). Upon re-evaluation of these data, however, this proposal has been questioned(3, 4), and a transport mechanism including proton pumping in the reductive phase-that is, during the transfer of the first two electrons- was suggested. Subsequently, additional studies reported that proton pumping during the reductive phase can occur, but only when it is immediately preceded by an oxidative phase(5). To help clarify the issue we have measured the generation of the electric potential across the membrane, starting from a defined one-electron reduced state. Here we show that a second electron transfer into the enzyme leads to charge translocation corresponding to pumping of one proton without necessity for a preceding turnover...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCytochrome c oxidase (CcO) is the {{terminal}} <b>enzyme</b> <b>of</b> aerobic <b>respiration.</b> The energy {{released from the}} reduction of molecular oxygen to water is used to pump protons across the mitochondrial or bacterial membrane. The pump function introduces a mechanistic requirement of a valve that prevents protons from flowing backwards during the process. It was recently found that Glu- 242, a key amino acid in transferring protons to be pumped across the membrane and {{to the site of}} oxygen reduction, fulfils the function of such a valve by preventing simultaneous contact to the pump site and to the proton-conducting D-channel (Kaila V. R. I. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 105, 2008). Here we have incorporated the valve model into the framework of the reaction mechanism. The function of the Glu valve is studied by exploring how the redox state of the surrounding metal centers, dielectric effects, and membrane potential, affects the energetics and leaks of this valve. Parallels are drawn between the dynamics of Glu- 242 and the long-standing obscure difference between the metastable OH and stable O states of the binuclear center. Our model provides a suggestion for why reduction of the former state is coupled to proton translocation while reduction of the latter is not...|$|R

An expression analysis of genes in glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and oxidative pentose phosphate pathway revealed an induction <b>of</b> several <b>enzymes</b> within 3 d of Fe-deficient growth, indicating an increase in respiration in response to Fe deficiency.

Pear fruit was chosen as a model system. The approach consists of interconnected models that describe the transport phenomena at the macro and the microscale. First, macroscale model predictions of the most sensitive fruit regions (regions of the lowest and highest O 2 and CO 2 concentration of intact fruits) were performed. Next, the microscale model was applied to quantify intra-cellular metabolic gas concentration of the sensitive regions of the tissue. The in silico study revealed that O 2 concentration of optimal picked pear stored at typical controlled atmosphere condition (2. 5 kPa O 2, 0. 7 kPa CO 2 at - 1 °C) were higher than the Michaëlis-Menten constant for cytochrome c oxidase Km,c, the rate limiting <b>enzyme</b> <b>of</b> the <b>respiration</b> pathway. In contrast to small pears, large pears and extreme low O 2 storage conditions lead to O 2 concentrations well below the Km,c.

This situation was not improved by the discovery of hemoglobins in Protozoa (Sato and Tamiya, 1937; Keilin and Ryley, 1953); in the root nodules of leguminous plants (Keilin and Wang, 1945); and {{in a number of}} molds (Keilin, 1953; Keilin and Tissi~res, 1953).

Therefore, we have studied its allelic variation in different carrot materials, including commercial cultivars, inbred lines, carrot subspecies and carrot crop wild relatives. This work is thus a first step to develop molecular markers based on AOX 1 gene. Sequence comparison revealed the existence of high number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as well as several insertion/deletion events (InDels), especially in exon 1 and intron 1. Intron 1 showed to be the most polymorphic region and harbored an insertion event of 400 bp, which had highly divergent sequences depending on the carrot genotype. The insertion was located in a region of single tandem repeats (SSR) that was also polymorphic between genotypes. This intronic insertion, together with its associated SSRs, arises as a good source of candidate functional markers (FMs) that, once validated, could greatly contribute to marker assisted selection of new carrot genotypes...|$|R
