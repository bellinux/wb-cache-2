At first there came over only Phlegm, afterwards a black Oil, and then likewise a Spirit arose, which I could noways condense, but it forced my Lute, or broke my Glasses. Once, when it had forced the Lute, coming close thereto, {{in order to try to}} repair it, <b>I</b> <b>observed</b> that the Spirit which issued out caught Fire at the Flame of the Candle, and continued burning with Violence as it issued out, in a Stream, which 1 blew out, and lighted again, alternately, for several times.|$|E

The old tower of three stories, mentioned by Martin, was taken down soon after 1746, and a modern house supplies its place.

500|$|Dan White's {{arrest and}} trial caused a sensation, and {{illustrated}} severe {{tensions between the}} liberal population and the city police. The San Francisco Police were mostly working-class Irish descendants who intensely disliked the growing gay immigration, {{as well as the}} liberal direction of the city government. After White turned himself in and confessed, he sat in his cell while his former colleagues on the police force told Harvey Milk jokes; police openly wore [...] "Free Dan White" [...] T-shirts {{in the days after the}} murder. An undersheriff for San Francisco later stated: [...] "The more <b>I</b> <b>observed</b> what went on at the jail, the more I began to stop seeing what Dan White did as the act of an individual and began to see it as a political act in a political movement." [...] White showed no remorse for his actions, and only exhibited vulnerability during an eight-minute call to his mother from jail.|$|E
500|$|Charles II of England {{was very}} fond of the toy spaniel, {{which is why the}} dogs now carry his name, {{although}} {{there is no evidence that}} the modern breeds are descended from his particular dogs. He is credited with causing an increase in popularity of the breed during this period. Samuel Pepys' diary describes how the spaniels were allowed to roam anywhere in Whitehall Palace, including during state occasions. In an entry dated 1 September 1666, describing a council meeting, Pepys wrote, [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>observed</b> there was the silliness of the King, playing with his dog all the while and not minding the business." [...] Charles' sister Princess Henrietta was painted by Pierre Mignard holding a small red and white toy-sized spaniel. Judith Blunt-Lytton, 16th Baroness Wentworth, writing in her 1911 work Toy Dogs and Their Ancestors, theorised that after Henrietta's death at the age of 26 in 1670, Charles took her dogs for himself.|$|E
500|$|Still in {{a shallow}} dive, <b>I</b> <b>observed</b> another P-38 and an Me 109 going round and round. It seemed that the 38 needed help so I started down. At about , [...] the Jerry, still way out of my range, turned under me and {{slightly}} to the right. I rolled over on my back, following him and gave him an ineffective burst at long range. By this time I was traveling in excess of [...] My left window blew out, scaring {{the hell out of}} me. I thought I had been hit by some of the ground fire I had observed in the vicinity. I regained control of the aircraft and pulled out above a wheat field. I tried to contact the flight to get myself recognized, but observed an Me 109 making a pass at me from about seven o'clock high. I broke left as well as my plane could and the Jerry overshot. I straightened out and gave him a burst. He chandelled steeply to the left and I shot some more. He passed right over me and I slipped over in an Immelmann. As I straightened out at the top, I saw the pilot bail out.|$|E

2500|$|On February 15, 2006, Schaefer made suggestive {{comments}} to Elizabeth Krum, a 24-year-old assistant to then-Governor Robert Ehrlich. Responding to Schaefer's request for tea, Krum set a thermal mug {{in front of}} him. Schaefer watched her walk away, then beckoned for her to return. When she obliged, he told her, [...] "Walk again", staring after her {{as she left the}} conference room. Schaefer initially refused to apologize, saying, [...] "She's a pretty little girl. She ought to be damn happy that <b>I</b> <b>observed</b> her going out the door. The day I don't look at pretty women is the day I die."

2500|$|... “Upon {{arriving}} in a camp, a prisoner’s first care {{is to get}} to know his enclosure [...] <b>I</b> <b>observed</b> right away that there was little hope in this regard”. For prisoners, escape signified not only flight from the conditions of detention but also regaining their status as soldiers and being able once again to fight and lead their country to victory. Military honour and patriotism were powerful motivators. Most of the time, escapes occurred from work kommandos, from which it was easier to hide. Escape required great psychological and physical preparation. Going to the nearest town to take a train or walking to the border implied a considerable effort, especially considering that prisoners were underfed. Moreover, they could not use well-travelled roads lest they be found. A prisoner had to blend in, adopt local mannerisms so as not to appear suspicious, know how to speak German and have credible civilian clothing: “The state of an escapee’s soul? It’s not fear. It’s tension of the spirit, a perpetual 'who goes there?'” ...|$|E
