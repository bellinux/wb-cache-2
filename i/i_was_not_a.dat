25|$|Peru is {{investigating}} claims that a beauty pageant contestant was lured to Gabon {{to become the}} lover of its 67-year-old president, Omar Bongo, and was stranded for nearly two weeks after she refused. A spokesman for Mr. Bongo said {{he was unaware of}} the allegations. The Peruvian Foreign Ministry said that Ivette Santa Maria, a 22-year-old Miss Peru America contestant, was invited to Gabon to be a hostess for a pageant there. In an interview, Ms. Santa Maria said that she was taken to Mr. Bongo's presidential palace hours after her Jan. 19 arrival and that as he joined her, he pressed a button and some sliding doors opened, revealing a large bed. She said, I told him <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> prostitute, that I was a Miss Peru. She fled and guards offered to drive her to a hotel. Without money to pay the bill, however, she was stranded in Gabon for 12 days until international women's groups and others intervened.|$|E

500|$|The Emperor {{considered}} appointing Luís Alves {{to command}} the Emperor's Battalion and asked him which side he would choose. According to historian Francisco Doratioto, Luís Alves answered that [...] "between {{the love of his}} father and his duty to the crown, he would stay with the latter." [...] PedroI expressed gratitude for his loyalty, but instead ordered him to take the Emperor's Battalion to the Field of Santana and join the rebels, preferring abdication to bloodshedding. Decades later, Luís Alves said in the Brazilian Senate: [...] "I marched along with the Emperor's Battalion to the Field of Santana, out of devotion to competent orders [...] <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> revolutionary. I esteemed the Abdication. I judged that it would be of advantage to Brazil, but I did not concur directly or indirectly with it." ...|$|E
500|$|On March 30, 1995, in Silverman v. Major League Baseball Player Relations Committee, Inc., Sotomayor {{issued a}} {{preliminary}} injunction against Major League Baseball, preventing it from unilaterally implementing a new {{collective bargaining agreement}} and using replacement players. Her ruling ended the 1994 baseball strike after 232 days, {{the day before the}} new season was scheduled to begin. The Second Circuit upheld Sotomayor's decision and denied the owners' request to stay the ruling. [...] The decision raised her profile, won her the plaudits of baseball fans, and had a lasting effect on the game. In the preparatory phase of the case, Sotomayor informed the lawyers of both sides that, [...] "I hope none of you assumed ... that my lack of knowledge of any of the intimate details of your dispute meant <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> baseball fan.

500|$|Conflict, or Angelou's {{presentation}} of opposites, is another theme in Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas. As Lupton states, Angelou constructs a plot by mixing opposing incidences and attitudes - Angelou's [...] "dialectical method". The book {{is full of}} conflicts: in Angelou's marriage, her feelings between being a good mother and a successful performer, the stereotypes about other races, and her new experiences with whites. Lupton believes this {{presentation of}} conflict is what makes Angelou's writing [...] "brilliant"; she finds that the strength of Singin' and Swingin' [...] comes, in part, from Angelou's duplication of conflicts underlying the plot, characters, and thought patterns in the book. Lupton adds, [...] "Not many other contemporary autobiographers {{have been able to}} capture, either in a single volume or in a series, the opposition of desires that is found in Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas and, to a lesser extent, in Angelou's other volumes". Even the closing sentence of the book ("Although <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> great singer I was his mother, and he was my wonderful, dependently independent son") demonstrates Angelou's dialectical construction, sums up the contradictions of Angelou's character, and alludes to mother/son patterns in her later books.|$|E

Even on the occasions that he began an interview tight-lipped, he almost inevitably opened up and offered abundant material. He spoke with a twang in his high-pitched voice, often filled with loud, infectious, childlike laughter. Gwynn possessed a cheerful personality, being friendly towards others while being critical of himself. He considered himself [...] "a good player ... but I knew my place. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> game-changer. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> dominant player".

2500|$|Parks {{initially}} {{became aware}} of the Beach Boys during their early popularity in the early 1960s.

'Something really dumb about it.'" [...] He added that, [...] "I loved Pet Sounds, you see. I came back to love them, and thought they had done a great job. It seemed to me that they would be fine in fighting spirit to take on this challenge of wresting that trophy {{out of the hands of}} those interlopers."

2500|$|Callas herself {{appears to}} have been in {{agreement}} not only with Ardoin's assertions that she started as a natural mezzo-soprano, but also saw the similarities between herself and Pasta and Malibran. In 1957, she described her early voice as: [...] "The timbre was dark, almost black—when I think of it, I think of thick molasses", and in 1968 she added, [...] "They say <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> true soprano, I was rather toward a mezzo". Regarding her ability to sing the heaviest as well as the lightest roles, she told James Fleetwood, It's study; it's Nature. I'm doing nothing special, you know. Even Lucia, Anna Bolena, Puritani, all these operas were created for one type of soprano, the type that sang Norma, Fidelio, which was Malibran of course. And a funny coincidence last year, I was singing Anna Bolena and Sonnambula, same months and the same distance of time as Giuditta Pasta had sung in the nineteenth century... So I'm really not doing anything extraordinary. You wouldn't ask a pianist [...] {{to be able to play}} everything; he [...] to. This is Nature and also because I had a wonderful teacher, the old kind of teaching methods... I was a very heavy voice, that is my nature, a dark voice shall we call it, and I was always kept on the light side. She always trained me to keep my voice limber.|$|E

2500|$|In 1969, Schwarzenegger met Barbara Outland (later Barbara Outland Baker), an English teacher {{he lived}} with until 1974. Schwarzenegger talked about Barbara in his memoir in 1977: [...] "Basically {{it came down to}} this: she was a {{well-balanced}} woman who wanted an ordinary, solid life, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> well-balanced man, and hated the very idea of ordinary life." [...] Baker has described Schwarzenegger as [...] " [...] joyful personality, totally charismatic, adventurous, and athletic" [...] but claims {{towards the end of the}} relationship he became [...] "insufferable– classically conceited– the world revolved around him". Baker published her memoir in 2006, entitled Arnold and Me: In the Shadow of the Austrian Oak. Although Baker, at times, painted an unflattering portrait of her former lover, Schwarzenegger actually contributed to the tell-all book with a foreword, and also met with Baker for three hours. Baker claims, for example, that she only learned of his being unfaithful after they split, and talks of a turbulent and passionate love life. Schwarzenegger has made it clear that their respective recollection of events can differ. The couple first met six to eight months after his arrival in the U.S – their first date was watching the first Apollo Moon landing on television. They shared an apartment in Santa Monica for three and a half years, and having little money, would visit the beach all day, or have barbecues in the back yard. Although Baker claims that when she first met him, he had [...] "little understanding of polite society" [...] and she found him a turn-off, she says, [...] "He's as much a self-made man as it's possible to be – he never got encouragement from his parents, his family, his brother. He just had this huge determination to prove himself, and that was very attractive … I'll go to my grave knowing Arnold loved me." ...|$|E
