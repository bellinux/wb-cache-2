40|$|Propene oxide is an {{important}} chemical intermediate and titanium silicalite (TS- 1) has been widely investigated as a promising catalyst for the direct epoxidation of propene with ex-situ or in-situ produced hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant. In order to clarify {{the effects of the}} kind of precious metal and treatment process in the catalyst preparation on the propene epoxidation and the hydrogen peroxide decomposition, TS- 1 was impregnated with gold and palladium via drying, calcination and reduction and the experiments to check its catalytic performance were conducted in a <b>gas</b> <b>aspirating</b> autoclave reactor in the absence of mass transfer limitations. The presence of precious metals vigorously catalyzed the side reactions and hydrogen peroxide decomposition. Some of the precious metal containing TS- 1 catalysts showed high initial rates but there was no catalyst with a propene oxide yield after 5 h reaction time comparable to TS- 1 alone because of the enhancement of side reactions by precious metals. The significant decline in the selectivity to propene oxide over the dried precious metal containing TS- 1 catalysts was attributed to the leaching of precious metals into the reaction medium. Palladium containing TS- 1 showed exceptionally high decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. Reduction and calcination increased the decomposition by forming metallic gold and palladium. Homogeneous dispersion of gold nanoparticles was achieved by a sol immobilization method which led to a decrease of propene oxide selectivity and an increase of hydrogen peroxide decomposition...|$|R

An experimental investigation {{has been carried out}} on a single cylinder, direct injection (DI), and compression ignition (CI) engine tested with pure diesel and diesel- Acetylene dual fuel mode with diethyl ether (DEE) as oxygenated additive. Experiments were conducted to study the performance characteristics of DI diesel engine in dual fuel mode by <b>aspirating</b> Acetylene <b>gas</b> in the inlet manifold, with diesel- diethyl ether blends (DEE) as an ignition source. Fixed quantity of Acetylene <b>gas</b> was <b>aspirated</b> and Blend of diethyl ether with diesel (DEE 10, DEE 20 and DEE 30) was taken and then readings were taken at various loads. From the detailed study it has been concluded that the blending ratio of DEE 20 gives better performance. Dual fuel operation along with addition of diethyl ether resulted in higher thermal efficiency when compared to neat diesel operation.

Also, to find out if the technique can predict whether manual aspiration will be successful, hence avoiding the need for intercostal tube drainage. DESIGN [...] Prospective study of 25 episodes of pneumothorax during which patients breathed air from a Douglas bag that contained chlorofluorocarbon gases from a metered dose inhaler while the pneumothorax was aspirated. SETTING [...] Medical unit of a district general hospital. PATIENTS [...] 22 patients who presented over nine months with acute pneumothorax. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Presence or absence of chlorofluorocarbon marker <b>gases</b> in the <b>aspirate.</b> Presence or absence of sustained re-expansion of the affected lung in the chest radiograph. RESULTS [...] Marker gas was detected in the aspirate from 16 out of 25 pneumothoraces. Of these, 13 required intercostal tube drainage because of failure of the lung to re-expand. Marker gas was not detected in nine cases, and in all of these cases manual aspiration resulted in sustained re-expansion of the lung. CONCLUSIONS [...] The presence or absence of a pleural leak during manual aspiration of spontaneous pneumothorax can be shown by using this technique. The absence of marker <b>gas</b> in the <b>aspirate</b> implies that manual aspiration will be successful, whereas its presence predicts, in most cases, either failure of manual aspiration to expand the lung or early re-collapse of the lung...|$|R

Of the above patients 20 prepared either with mannitol (n = 10) or with castor oil (n = 10) had the instrument passed to the caecum without air insufflation or suction. After mannitol, mean intracolonic hydrogen concentration (4. 07 %) was significantly higher (p less than 0. 001) than after castor oil (0. 51 %). Mean oxygen and methane concentrations were approximately similar. Potentially explosive concentrations of hydrogen (greater than 4. 1 %) and or methane (greater than 5 %) were present in 6 / 10 patients given mannitol and 2 / 10 patients given castor oil. Nevertheless only one patient from each group had coexisting oxygen concentrations of more than 5 % producing thus a combustile mixture. Routine colonoscopy (using air insufflation and suction) was performed in 26 patients prepared with mannitol. Mean intracolonic hydrogen and methane was 0. 63 % and 0. 88 % respectively. The highest recorded concentration of hydrogen was 2. 6 %, and of methane 2. 1 %, while all patients had oxygen concentrations of more than 5 %. It is suggested, therefore, that routine insufflation and suction before colonoscopic electrosurgical polypectomy should result in safe levels of these gases. The remote possibility of pockets of undiluted gas in explosive concentration, however, indicates the use of an inert gas such as carbon dioxide if mannitol preparation is used before electrosurgery...|$|R

JHE RESULTS of blood glucose determinations and, {{to a lesser}} extent, of blood urea nitrogen determinations by an automatic analysis de-vice * have been observed to be significantly {{lower than those of}} the commonly used routine methods (1, 2). A cause of these discrepan-cies was the gradually increasing sedimentation of cells in blood samples during an hour of processing, with resultant pick-up of blood suspensions progressively richer in cells and with lower glucose and urea nitrogen concentrations.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Stringent emission regulations imposed by governments and depleting fossil fuel reserves have promoted {{the development of the}} automotive industry towards novel technologies. Various types of hybrid power plants for transport and stationary applications have emerged. The methodology of design and development of such power plants varies according to power producing components used in the systems. The practical feasibility of such power plants is a pre-requisite to any further development. This work presents thermodynamic analysis and modelling of such a novel power plant, assesses its feasibility and further discusses the development of a suitable control system. The proposed system consists of a hybrid configuration of a solid oxide fuel cell and IC engine as the main power producing components. A reformer supplies fuel gas to the fuel cell while the IC engine is supplied with a liquid fuel. The excess fuel from the fuel cell anode and the oxygen-depleted air from cathode of the fuel cell are also supplied to the engine. This <b>gas</b> mixture is <b>aspirated</b> into the engine with the balance of energy provided by the liquid fuel. The fuel cell exhaust streams are used to condition the fuel in the engine to ensure minimum pollutants and improved engine performance. Both, fuel cell and engine share the load on the system. The fuel cell operates on a base load while the engine handles majority of the transient load. This system is particularly suitable for a delivery truck or a bus cycle. Models of the system components reformer, solid oxide fuel cell, IC engine and turbocharger were developed to understand their steady state and dynamic behaviour. These models were validated against sources of literature and used to predict the effect of different operating conditions for each component. The main control parameters for each component were derived from these models. A first law analysis of the system at steady state was conducted to identify optimum operating region, verify feasibility and efficiency improvement of the system. The results suggested reduced engine fuel consumption and a 10...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND—There is no {{technique}} in general use that reliably predicts {{the outcome of}} manual aspiration of spontaneous pneumothorax. We have hypothesised {{that the absence of}} a pleural leak at the time of aspiration will identify a group of patients in whom immediate discharge is unlikely to be complicated by early lung re-collapse and have tested this hypothesis by using a simple bedside tracer gas technique.  METHODS—Eighty four episodes of primary spontaneous pneumothorax and 35 episodes of secondary spontaneous pneumothorax were studied prospectively. Patients breathed air containing a tracer (propellant gas from a pressurised metered dose inhaler) while the pneumothorax was <b>aspirated</b> percutaneously. Tracer <b>gas</b> in the <b>aspirate</b> was detected at the bedside using a portable flame ioniser and episodes were categorised as tracer gas positive (> 1 part per million of tracer gas) or negative. The presence of tracer gas was taken to imply a persistent pleural leak. Failure of manual aspiration and the need for a further intervention was based on chest radiographic appearances showing either failure of the lung to re-expand or re-collapse following initial re-expansion.  RESULTS—A negative tracer gas test alone implied that manual aspiration would be successful in the treatment of 93 % of episodes of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (p< 0. 001) and in 86 % of episodes of secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (p= 0. 01). A positive test implied that manual aspiration would either fail to re-expand the lung or that early re-collapse would occur despite initial re-expansion in 66 % of episodes of primary spontaneous pneumothorax and 71 % of episodes of secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. Lung re-inflation on the chest radiograph taken immediately after aspiration was a poor predictor of successful aspiration, with lung re-collapse occurring in 34 % of episodes by the following day such that a further intervention was required.  CONCLUSIONS—National guidelines currently recommend immediate discharge of patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax based primarily on the outcome of the post-aspiration chest radiograph which we have shown to be a poor predictor of early lung re-collapse. Using a simple bedside test in combination with the post-aspiration chest radiograph, we can predict with high accuracy the success of aspiration in achieving sustained lung re-inflation, thereby identifying patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax who can be safely and immediately discharged home and those who should be observed overnight because of a significant risk of re-collapse, with an estimated re-admission rate of 1 %. ...|$|R
5000|$|The town's {{water supply}} {{originally}} came through {{public and private}} wells. After the Great Fire of 1476, this was supplemented in 1502 by building the waterworks in Niedermühle whereby Eder water, driven by a waterwheel in the Eder, was fed into the Old Town and distributed to various cisterns. In 1899, a public waterworks was built. Instead of using the Eder's water, however, the new waterworks used springwater from the pond lands in Teichmühle driven by water power from the Nemphe, and also by motor power, into a tank high up the Burgberg, whence it was piped to individual houses. In 1913, the Gernshäuser Springs came along whose water still runs down the slopes even today into the lower town. In 1903, in the municipal building [...] "Niedermühle", a turbine was built that was driven by Eder water. With this turbine and a naturally <b>aspirated</b> <b>gas</b> engine (60 horsepower), direct current was generated for Frankenberg's first electric light. As part of the electrification of North Hesse, alternating current power supplies were ensured with PreussenElektra's overland cables in 1921. In 1871, a land survey of the Frankenberg municipal area was done. Land acquisitions were undertaken in the 1890s and were completed by 1904. The economic upswing before the First World War was expressed in population figures that were rising again. In 1908, 3,314 people lived in Frankenberg. The town now began to expand beyond its limits, which had been in place since its founding, marked by the town wall. In 1890, the railway station, the Thonet chair factory and soon afterwards the new post office were built behind the provincial council office. In 1900, the savings bank building went up before the Geismarer Tor ("Geismar Gate"). Following this were the Amt court in 1903 and the teachers' college with a drill school in 1905. The building nowadays houses the Gymnasium (Edertalschule). In 1913, the town school (Ortenberg-Schule) came into being. In 1905, before the Linnertor (gate), the Jewish school was built. An economic and cultural stagnation was brought upon Frankenberg by the First World War. During the Second World War, too, {{there were very few}} meaningful changes in town, other than a few new houses in Ederdorf and a few building renovations and expansions in the main town. Even a town expansion of 144 ha east of the cemetery, as recommended in 1914 in a report about the Gau of Frankenberg by the Research Body for German Housing Business (Forschungsstätte für die Deutsche Siedlungsgesellschaft) at the Reichsherrnstättenamt, was never undertaken.|$|R
40|$|The {{current work}} {{addresses}} {{the use of}} producer gas, a bio-derived gaseous alternative fuel, in engines designed for natural gas, derived from diesel engine frames. Impact {{of the use of}} producer gas on the general engine performance with specific focus on turbo-charging is addressed. The operation of a particular engine frame with diesel, natural gas and producer gas indicates that the peak load achieved is highest with diesel fuel (in compression ignition mode) followed by natural gas and producer gas (both in spark ignite mode). Detailed analysis of the engine power de-rating on fuelling with natural gas and producer gas indicates that the change in compression ratio (migration from compression to spark ignited mode), difference in mixture calorific value and turbocharger mismatch are the primary contributing factors. The largest de-rating occurs due to turbocharger mismatch. Turbocharger selection and optimization is identified as the strategy to recover the non-thermodynamic power loss, identified as the recovery potential (the loss due to mixture calorific value and turbocharger mismatch) on operating the engine with a fuel different from the base fuel. A turbocharged after-cooled six cylinder, 5. 9 l, 90 kWe (diesel rating) engine (12. 2 bar BMEP) is available commercially as a naturally <b>aspirated</b> natural <b>gas</b> engine delivering a peak load of 44. 0 kWe (6. 0 bar BMEP). The engine delivers a load of 27. 3 kWe with producer <b>gas</b> under naturally <b>aspirated</b> mode. On charge boosting the engine with a turbocharger similar in configuration to the diesel engine turbocharger, the peak load delivered with producer gas is 36 kWe (4. 8 bar BMEP) indicating a de-rating of about 60 % over the baseline diesel mode. Estimation of knock limited peak load for producer gas-fuelled operation on the engine frame using a Wiebe function-based zero-dimensional code indicates a knock limited peak load of 76 kWe, indicating the potential to recover about 40 kWe. As a part of the recovery strategy, optimizing the ignition timing for maximum brake torque based on both spark sweep tests and established combustion descriptors and engine-turbocharger matching for producer gas-fuelled operation resulted in a knock limited peak load of 72. 8 kWe (9. 9 bar BMEP) at a compressor pressure ratio of 2. 30. The de-rating of about 17. 0 kWe compared to diesel rating is attributed to the reduction in compression ratio. With load recovery, the specific biomass consumption reduces from 1. 2 kg/kWh to 1. 0 kg/kWh, an improvement of over 16 % while the engine thermal efficiency increases from 28 % to 32 %. The thermodynamic analysis of the compressor and the turbine indicates an isentropic efficiency of 74. 5 % and 73 %, respectively...|$|R
