40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) process is a widely established Rapid Manufacturing technology that offers various possibilities not available from other production techniques. The application of SLS {{in the creation of}} products such as shoe outsoles has led to a requirement for compression property data and an understanding of the factors that influence it. This research investigated the effect of sintering temperature on the compression modulus and strength of SLS nylon- 12 parts. Three parameters were used to vary the sintering temperature. These were laser power, <b>part</b> <b>heater</b> set point and powder bed location. An increase in laser power or <b>part</b> <b>heater</b> set point led to an increase sintering temperature. The higher temperature areas within the powder bed also led to higher sintering temperatures. Consequently, this caused an increase in compression properties.

40|$|A {{sintered}} part’s {{mechanical properties}} are often variable {{dependent on the}} temperature at which it was sintered. Prior research has investigated how predefined process conditions (such as scan speed and laser power) in the ‘Sinter’ software affect built parts, however, little work focuses on other process conditions that can directly affect the temperature distribution in the bed relative to these parts. These conditions are not always controllable in the ‘Sinter’ software. By replacing the scanner {{at the top of}} the Sinterstation 2000 with a thermal imaging camera, an insight into the temperature distribution on the part bed was obtained. A temperature variance of up to 7 °C was found across the bed, as well as a large temperature drop and recovery period on powder layer recoat. This paper explores the possible causes of this variation in the processing of DuraForm™ Polyamide- 12 powder by monitoring and assessing build operations, enabled by replacing the front viewing window with a retro-fitted thermal imaging camera. The part bed was observed and various process conditions analysed including powder recoat, <b>part</b> and feed <b>heaters,</b> and swing gate configuration. On powder recoat, the part bed exhibited a drop in temperature because the fresh layer of powder is at a lower temperature than the powder already present in the part bed. The part bed temperature drop lessens with raised feed bed temperatures however there are limitations. Thermal analysis of the <b>part</b> <b>heater</b> proved that the uneven part bed heat distribution was not linked to the temperature gradient of the <b>part</b> <b>heater.</b> Swing gates were found to minimise hot and cold spots but spend a substantial time oscillating on roller passing...|$|R

This research investigated the effect of sintering temperature on compression modulus and strength of Selective Laser Sintered nylon- 12 parts. Three parameters were used to vary temperature. These were laser power, <b>part</b> <b>heater</b> set point and powder bed location. The modulus and strength increased as temperature increased. A statistical analysis showed that laser power and <b>part</b> <b>heater</b> set point had a statistically significant effect on compression properties. They had over a 95 % probability of influencing compression properties. With less than a 95 % chance, the effect of bed location on compression properties was considered statistically insignificant. k The variations in temperature also led to changes in crystallinity and density. An increase in temperature caused a decrease in crystallinity. In contrast density was increased as temperature increased. Except for parts built at various bed locations, there was over a 95 % certainty that temperature caused differences in crystallinity and density. However, there was a less than 95 % probability that crystallinity and density influenced compression properties. Hence, they had no statistically significant effect on compression modulus and strength. This work has added to the knowledge base of Selective Laser Sintered nylon- 12 within the specified boundaries of this research. Users of this technology who consider compression modulus and strength to be of importance can focus their efforts on optimising temperature. This has been shown to have a greater statistical impact on compression properties compared to crystallinity and density. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of smart materials for embedding in aerospace composites provides enhanced functionality for future aircraft structures. Critical flight conditions like icing {{of the leading}} edges can affect the aircraft functionality and controllability. Hence, anti-icing and de-icing capabilities are used. In case of leading edges made of fibre metal laminates heater elements can be embedded between composite layers. However this local heating causes strains and stresses in the structure due to the different thermal expansion coefficients of the different laminated materials. In order to characterize the structural behaviour during thermal loading full-field strain and shape measurement can be used. In this research, a shearography instrument with three spatially-distributed shearing cameras is used to measure surface displacement gradients which give a quantitative estimation of the in- and out-of-plane surface strain components. For the experimental part, two GLARE (Glass Laminate Aluminum Reinforced Epoxy) specimens with six different embedded copper heater elements were manufactured: two copper mesh shapes (straight and S-shape), three connection techniques (soldered, spot welded and overlapped) and one straight heater element with delaminations. The surface strain behaviour of the specimens due to thermal loading was measured and analysed. The comparison of the connection techniques of <b>heater</b> element <b>parts</b> showed that the overlapped onnection has the smallest effect on the surface strain distribution. Furthermore, the possibility of defect detection and defect depth characterisation close to the heater elements was also investigated. Aerospace Structures & MaterialsAerospace Engineerin...|$|R

A total of nine tests {{were conducted}} at three levels of heat flux and three levels of subcooling {{in each of the}} two space experiments in a GAS canister on the STS- 77, - 72, respectively. Three (3) modes of propagation of boiling across the heater surface and subsequent vapor bubble growths were observed, in addition to the two (2) modes observed in the previous microgravity pool boiling space flights on STS- 47, - 57, and - 60. Of particular interest were the extremely dynamic or "explosive" growths, which were determined to be the consequence of the large increase in the liquid-vapor interface area associated with the appearance of a corrugated or rough interface. Predictions of circumstances for its onset have been carried out. Assumptions were necessary regarding the character of disturbances necessary for the instabilities to grow. Also, a new vapor bubble phenomena was observed in which small vapor bubbles migrated toward a larger bubble, eventually coalescing with this larger bubble. The heat transfer was enhanced approximately 30 % {{as a result of these}} migrating bubbles, which is believed to be a vapor bubble manifestation of Marangoni convection and/or molecular momentum effects, sometimes referred to as vapor recoil.

The vehicle for accomplishing this is an investigation, including tests to be conducted in microgravity and coupled with appropriate analyses, of the heat transfer and vapor bubble dynamics associated with nucleation, bubble growth/collapse and subsequent motion, considering the interrelations between buoyancy, momentum and surface tension which will govern the motion of the vapor and surrounding liquid, {{as a function of the}} heating rate at the heat transfer surface and the temperature level and distribution in the bulk liquid. The experiment is designed to be contained within the confines of a Get-Away-Special Canister (GAS Can) installed in the bay of the space shuttle. When the shuttle reaches orbit, the experiment will be turned on and testing will proceed automatically.

50|$|Filament winding is a {{fabrication}} technique mainly {{used for}} manufacturing open (cylinders) or closed end structures (pressure vessels or tanks). The process involves winding filaments under tension over a rotating mandrel. The mandrel rotates around the spindle (Axis 1 or X: Spindle) while a delivery {{eye on a}} carriage (Axis 2 or Y: Horizontal) traverses horizontally {{in line with the}} axis of the rotating mandrel, laying down fibers in the desired pattern or angle. The most common filaments are glass or carbon and are impregnated in a bath with resin as they are wound onto the mandrel. Once the mandrel is completely covered to the desired thickness, the resin is cured. Depending on the resin system and its cure characteristics, often the rotating mandrel is placed in an oven or placed under radiant <b>heaters</b> until the <b>part</b> is cured. Once the resin has cured, the mandrel is removed or extracted, leaving the hollow final product. For some products such as gas bottles the 'mandrel' is a permanent part of the finished product forming a liner to prevent gas leakage or as a barrier to protect the composite from the fluid to be stored.|$|R

40|$|The {{food and}} {{beverage}} industries are significant industrial producers of green-house gas (GHG) emissions. Reductions {{can be achieved by}} increased energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy to replace fossil fuel use. The main efficiency method within this industries is the use of low temperature heat (LTH), i. e. below 100 °C. Sources for LTH include heat recovery from process flows, heat rejection from utility operations (i. e. chillers, combined heat and power (CHP), condensing economisers), and renewable energy (i. e. solar thermal). A hybrid heating system (H 2 S) has been developed that can retrofit steam heater designs for the integration of LTH. Two different systems have been found, for adapting direct and indirect steam heaters, either installing an extra hot water heater or using the indirect hot water loop for the integration. In both systems the existing steam <b>heater</b> remains a <b>part</b> of the system for individual back-up.

40|$|An {{extensive}} measuring {{project has}} been carried out by Gothenburg Energy which operates the Gothenburg district heating system. Over a period of 18 months, heat loads, water flows, temperatures, etc., were measured at 15 minute intervals at 50 substations. The project was carried out in co-operation with the Department of Building Services Engineering at Chalmers University of Technology, and ended up with approximately 15. 10 6 measured data. The main part of the substations studied supply multifamily buildings of various sizes and age. However, a number of substations do supply office buildings, and two small hospitals are also included in the measuring project. The way in which the measured data are handled and treated, and the outcome of the analysis and generalisation of the measuring results, are presented in this thesis. One extensive part of the thesis deals with domestic hot water consumption in residential buildings. Here the annual heat consumption, the maximum flow, the maximum demand (kW), etc. are analysed in detail. The most significant result from this is a new and slightly modified design data curve, compared to the old Swedish standard, for flow through hot water <b>heaters.</b> Another <b>part</b> describes the total heat consumption of the build-ings supplied by district heating. Here also, the maximum heat demands have been studied. For example, one section deals with night shut-back of radiator tem-perature in buildings and the influence on the function of the district heating system. Due to the magnitude of the project and a systematic way to handle both the measuring process and the data obtained, the project contributes substantially to the knowledge about energy behaviour of different types of buildings in a large district heating system. The data gained have been analysed from different points of view. The study started out from the district heating point of view and is mainly focused on questions related to this.

40|$|Molecular assays {{targeted}} to nucleic acid (NA) markers {{are becoming increasingly}} important to medical diagnostics. However, these are typically confined to wealthy, developed countries; or, to the national reference laboratories of developing-world countries. There are many infectious diseases that are endemic in low-resource settings (LRS) where the lack of simple, instrument-free, NA diagnostic tests is a critical barrier to timely treatment. One of the primary barriers to the practicality and availability of NA assays in LRS has been the complexity and power requirements of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) instrumentation (another is sample preparation). In this article, we investigate the hypothesis that an electricity-free heater based on exothermic chemical reactions and engineered phase change materials can successfully incubate isothermal NA amplification assays. We assess the heater's equivalence to commercially available PCR instruments through the characterization of the temperature profiles produced, and a minimal method comparison. Versions of the prototype for several different isothermal techniques are presented. We demonstrate that an electricity-free heater based on exothermic chemical reactions and engineered phase change materials can successfully incubate isothermal NA amplification assays, and {{that the results of}} those assays are not significantly different from ones incubated in parallel in commercially available PCR instruments. These results clearly suggest the potential of the non-instrumented nucleic acid amplification (NINA) heater for molecular diagnostics in LRS.

40|$|The thesis explores {{options for}} {{optimising}} heating of sanitary {{water with the}} use of solar panels and the electric heater. Since electricity is cheaper at night, it would be reasonable to determine whether the electric heater should only be additionally heated at night alone. A smart controller was assembled, which starts the heater on the basis of weather forecasts and estimated consumption of hot water, thereby mostly only at night and if necessary. Hardware is responsible for reading data from temperature sensors and starting the electric <b>heater.</b> The software <b>part</b> of the system obtains a weather forecast from e-mail and starts the heater on the basis of forecast analysis and anticipated use of hot water. An analysis of algorithm functioning was performed, which compared the effectiveness of the algorithm in different scenarios of collectors’ sun exposure. The effectiveness of each algorithm was established {{on the basis of the}} cost of electricity necessary for the provision of domestic hot water. It has been concluded that in this case, heating water during night time alone is not worthwhile because the heat loss of the heater is too significant. Efficacy of the algorithm was compared assuming half smaller losses and better isolation of the heater. It has been found that the algorithm is more efficient. An improved algorithm which heats water only for morning use and heats it during the day only when needed, was put to test as well. This algorithm was used as a final solution in the test environment, as it delivers the greatest savings...|$|R
40|$|Micropropulsion for {{spacecraft}} is an {{enabling technology}} for many future missions, and {{may increase the}} performance and drastically reduce the mass required for advanced propulsion systems. The Swedish activities in micropropulsion at The Angstrom Space Technology Centre (ASTC) are outlined. The research targets two major issues: the development of system parts, and the research into integration techniques and strategies. This paper collects a multitude of devices relevant to the micropropulsion system design, together with representative functional demonstrations. The items are mainly intended for chemical micropropulsion systems or fuel-feed systems for electric propulsion. In particular, gas handling devices, sensors, and actuators are presented. These include silicon nozzles, thin film heaters, suspended microcoil heaters, proportional piezoelectric valves, proportional and isolation valves using phase-change material, thermal throttle flow-regulators, high-pressure regulators, 3 D-particle filters, and sensors for strain, pressure, flow, and thrust. Moreover, integration techniques and interface structures are presented, for example low-temperature plasma-assisted silicon wafer bonding, multiwafer bonding, thin film soldering, hermetic electric through-wafer via connections, and multiconnector through-wafer vias. Emphasis is on how these items are designed to allow for system integration in a multiwafer silicon stack, comprising a complete micropropulsion system. In this manner, all items form a parts collection available to the system design. This strategy is exemplified by three micropropulsion systems researched at the ASTC. First, the cold/hot gas micropropulsion system is suitable for small spacecraft or when the demands on stability and pointing precision are extreme. The system performance depends strongly {{on the use of}} gas flow control. The complete gas handling system of four independent thrusters is integrated in the assembly of four structured silicon wafers. Each independent thruster contains a proportional valve, sensors for pressure, temperature, and thrust feedback, a converging-diverging micronozzle, and a suspended microcoil heater. The mass of the system is below 60 g. In total, this will provide the spacecraft with a safe, clean, low-powered, redundant, and flexible system for three-axis stabilization and attitude control. Second, a Xenon feed system for ion propulsion is heavily miniaturized using microsystems technology. Basically, a micromachined high-pressure regulator receives the gas from the storage, and the flow is further modulated by a thermally controlled flow restrictor. The flow restrictor microsystem comprises narrow ducts, thin film <b>heaters,</b> suspended <b>parts</b> for heat management, and flow sensors. Hereby, the amount of xenon required by the electric propulsion systems can be promptly delivered. The complete system mass is estimated to 150 g. Third, within the EU IST program, the ASTC participates {{in the development of a}} micro-pyrotechnic actuator system (Micropyros), suitable for short-duration space propulsion. The Micropyros integrate a full matrix of minute solid combustion rocket engines into panels situated on the spacecraft hull. The thrusters can be individually ignited, and each deliver thrust in the millinewton range. The ASTC focuses on the integration of the propulsion part by low-temperature bonding, and the characterization of the complete system...|$|R
