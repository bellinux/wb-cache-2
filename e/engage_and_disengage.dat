5|$|In air combat, the Phantom's {{greatest}} advantage was its thrust, which {{permitted a}} skilled pilot to <b>engage</b> <b>and</b> <b>disengage</b> from the fight at will. As a massive fighter aircraft designed to fire radar-guided missiles from beyond visual range, it lacked the agility of its Soviet opponents and {{was subject to}} adverse yaw during hard maneuvering. Although thus subject to irrecoverable spins during aileron rolls, pilots reported the aircraft to be very communicative and easy to fly {{on the edge of}} its performance envelope. In 1972, the F-4E model was upgraded with leading edge slats on the wing, greatly improving high angle of attack maneuverability at the expense of top speed.|$|E
25|$|In {{conjunction}} with London Transport from 1937 Leyland developed the Tiger FEC, the initials stood for flat-engined coach. The Leyland 8.6-litre engine (with revised sump) was mounted horizontally in mid wheel-base driving through a Wilson fluid-flywheel and an air-actuated AEC mechanical pre-selector gearbox. The gearbox was {{basically the same}} as used in the STL but it was fitted with an externally mounted air cylinder which actuated the bus bar to <b>engage</b> <b>and</b> <b>disengage</b> the gears. It worked in the opposite way from that in the slightly later RT type double decker in that air pressure was used to disengage the gears instead of being used to keep them engaged. When the gear change pedal was released it allowed the selected gear to engage by means of spring pressure in that {{same way as the}} gearbox in the STL. The system caused problems in that if a vehicle was left with a gear engaged and the air pressure leaked off {{it was not possible to}} disengage that gear until air pressure had been built up again. Because of this, there were a number of garage incidents caused by vehicles being left overnight with a gear still engaged. 88 of this type were built and 12 were destroyed during World War Two, the rest serving until 1954-5 as Green Line coaches.|$|E
500|$|The {{sequential}} shifting three speed gearbox was manually shifted, but clutchless, {{without the}} need for a clutch lever control, using instead a centrifugal clutch along with a plate clutch slaved to the footchange lever to <b>engage</b> <b>and</b> <b>disengage</b> the gearbox from the engine. While not intuitive to learn, once the rider got used to it, the semi-automatic transmission, [...] "took the terror out of motorcycling" [...] for novice riders. Unlike many scooter CVTs, the centrifugal clutch made it possible to push start the Super Cub, a useful advantage if the need arose.|$|E

50|$|The Top Spin is {{a thrill}} ride {{developed}} by HUSS Park Attractions, {{and is the}} generic name {{for a series of}} rides from other manufacturers that follow the same principle. The ride consists of a passenger platform suspended between two counterweighted arms. The arms are turned by motors, while the platform generally only has brakes that are <b>engaged</b> <b>and</b> <b>disengaged</b> at various points of the ride cycle. A typical top spin program runs the main arm motors while <b>engaging</b> <b>and</b> <b>disengaging</b> the platform brakes so that it will rotate in exciting ways. The minimum rider height requirement is 54 inches; maximum is 80 inches due to the seat and restraint design. The ride was debuted in 1990 with it proving an instant success with European fairgoers.|$|R

50|$|Lockup torque {{converters}} that <b>engage</b> <b>and</b> <b>disengage</b> at certain speeds can make these speeds unstable — the transmission wastes less power above {{the speed at}} which the torque converter locks up, usually causing more power to the wheels for the same throttle input.|$|E
50|$|A two speed {{transfer}} case also engaged the front axle. M39s and M809s used one which engaged the front axle automatically if {{the rear wheels}} turned faster than the front, as when the rear wheels spun. The M939s had an improved type, which always engaged the front axle in the low range, in the high range the driver could <b>engage</b> <b>and</b> <b>disengage</b> it with an air control.|$|E

50|$|The layout {{consisted}} of a small, 18 ft lift hill, followed by a diving 180° turn and several small hills, ending with another 180° {{turn back to the}} station. High Speed Thrill Coaster lift was powered by a six-cylinder Ford engine. The operator could control the coaster's overall speed by adjusting the speed of the chain through a clutch lever to <b>engage</b> <b>and</b> <b>disengage</b> the engine from the lift chain.|$|E

5000|$|The Attachment Unit Interfaces {{that were}} used with 10BASE5 [...] "thick net" [...] in the 1980s and 1990s used DA15 {{connectors}} for connectivity between the Medium Attachment Units and (Ethernet) network interface cards, albeit with a sliding latch to lock the connectors together {{instead of the usual}} hex studs with threaded holes. The sliding latch was intended to be quicker to <b>engage</b> <b>and</b> <b>disengage</b> and to work in places where jackscrews could not be used for reasons of component shape.|$|E
50|$|Screw-lock (or screw gate): Have a {{threaded}} sleeve over the gate {{which must be}} <b>engaged</b> <b>and</b> <b>disengaged</b> manually. They have fewer moving parts than spring-loaded mechanisms, are less prone to malfunctioning due to contamination or component fatigue, easier to employ one-handed. They, however, require more total effort and are more time-consuming than pull-lock, twist-lock or lever-lock.|$|R
5000|$|For the Dauphine, a Ferlec {{semi-automatic}} {{was offered}} from 1957 until 1963, when the [...] "fully automatic" [...] Jaeger electromechanical transmission control became available.

50|$|The jacking {{gear motor}} is {{designed}} to rotate the shaft at approximately 1/10rpm. Most jacking gear motors are rated at 5hp. The jacking gear motor assembly applies power and torque to the reduction gear by a flexible coupling or clutch that can freely <b>engage</b> <b>and</b> <b>disengage</b> to the high-pressure pinion (driving gear). Engaging is accomplished {{by means of a}} simple lever. Some newer propulsion arrangements utilize an automatic control system located in the engine room. Jacking gears often feature a lock to prevent the shaft from turning during current or tide changes or when being towed.|$|E
5000|$|In 1991 for the 1992 model year, Isuzu {{completely}} redesigned the Trooper to {{keep pace}} with changes in the SUV marketplace, making it larger, more powerful, and more luxurious.

Most models still used a part-time four-wheel-drive system, which required stopping the vehicle to <b>engage</b> <b>and</b> <b>disengage</b> the front axle. Starting in model year 1996, some Troopers came with a [...] "shift-on-the-fly" [...] engagement system.|$|E
50|$|In the 1920s Pullin {{developed}} various helicopter engine {{patents and}} in the 1940s he developed the Powerwheel, a rotary engine in the hub of a motorcycle wheel, a rotating single-cylinder engine known as a one-lunger. This consisted of just the cylinder and a clutch which could be <b>engaged</b> <b>and</b> <b>disengaged,</b> with a simple drum brake. The invention never entered production but is credited as {{an important step in}} rotary engine development.|$|R
50|$|The {{two-stroke}} Sonett II transmissions had a freewheel {{that could}} be <b>engaged</b> <b>and</b> <b>disengaged</b> while in motion via a pull handle down near the throttle pedal. The freewheel was required in the normal (non oil pump engines) SAAB two stroke engines {{but not in the}} Sonett since it had an automatic oiling system fed from a supply tank that obviated the need to add oil to the fuel.|$|R
50|$|Some {{time after}} {{commercial}} television appeared around 1936, the Musa connector {{came to be}} used as a standard video connector; its distinctive feature being that unlike most other types of coaxial connector, it is <b>engaged</b> <b>and</b> <b>disengaged</b> by a straight push-pull action, making it ideal for patch bays. In such professional telecommunications and video applications, the connector performed well until the end of analogue (525 or 625 line) television.|$|R

50|$|The first {{recorded}} {{use of this}} mounted force was during the Siege of Damascus (634). The best use of this lightly armed fast moving cavalry was revealed during the Battle of Yarmuk (636 AD) in which Khalid ibn Walid, knowing the importance and ability of his cavalry, used them to turn {{the course of events}} at every critical instance of the battle. With their ability to <b>engage</b> <b>and</b> <b>disengage,</b> and turn back and attack again from the flank or rear, the Mobile Guard inflicted a shattering defeat of the Byzantine army. This strong mobile striking force was often used in later years as an advance guard. It could rout opposing armies with its greater mobility that gave it an upper hand against any Byzantine army. One of the victories of the mobile guard was at Battle of Hazir in 637 CE under the command of Khalid, in which not a single Byzantine soldier survived. With this mobile striking force the Muslims easily conquered Syria with few casualties, including the Muslim victory at Battle of Iron Bridge which followed the surrender of Antioch.|$|E
