40|$|AbstractReburning {{technology}} {{is one of}} the most promising and cost-effective NOx reduction strategies for combustion systems. In this study, NOx reduction in a CO boiler by reburning is investigated. This study adopts a CO boiler from the Formosa Petrochemical Corporation (FPC) in Taiwan as the model for numerical investigation. It is found that NOx reduction occurs mainly behind the DeNOx section where recirculation is strong. Without reburn air, the size of reburn fuel hole does not significantly influence the NOx reduction, although a larger size is a little better. Without reburn air, a larger reburn fuel hole yields a higher temperature near the reburn fuel hole and leads to a better NO reduction. Injection of reburn fuel without reburn air results in higher CO emission. For a “richer” primary fuel without reburn air, reburn fuel fraction and injection location do not significantly influence the NOx reduction. The reburn air closer to the reburn fuel yields a lower NO emission. Temperature decreases first and arises then near the reburn air injection location. Combustion is more complete when the <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rate is increased. Increase of <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rate yields a higher NO emission and a lower CO emission.

40|$|The {{cross flow}} from channel to channel through gas {{diffusion}} layer (GDL) under the land could {{play an important}} role for water removal in proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. In this study, characteristics of liquid water removal from GDL have been investigated experimentally, through measuring unsteady pressure drop in a cell which has the GDL initially wet with liquid water. The thickness of GDL is carefully controlled by inserting various thicknesses of metal shims between the plates. It has been found that severe compression of GDL could result in excessive pressure drop from channel inlet to channel outlet. Removing liquid water from GDL by cross flow is difficult for GDL with high compression levels and for low <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rates. However, effective water removal can still be achieved at high compression levels of GDL if the <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rate is high. Based on different compressed GDL thicknesses, different GDL porosities and permeabilities were calculated and their effects on the characteristics of liquid water removal from GDL were evaluated. Visualization of liquid water transport has been conducted by using transparent flow channel, and liquid water removal from GDL under the land was observed for all the tested <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rates, which confirms that cross flow is practically effective to remove the liquid water accumulated in GDL under the land area.

Statistical methodologies for diagnosis are considered as one of the most relevant. This paper is dedicated to the diagnosis of flooding, using statistical methodology.

In this paper, these flooding conditions were completed by increasing the hygrometry of the <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> at constant temperature of the fuel cell stack, or by decreasing the temperature of the fuel cell stack at constant hygrometry of <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow.</b> The obtained experimental results are here correlated with a fluidic model of flooding conditions.

The influence of the mass flow rate (180, 265, 350, 435, and 520 kg h- 1) of inlet air and flue gas recirculation (0 %, 16. 5 %, and 33 %) fed to the boiler furnace was continuously monitored.

Correlation between boiler thermal power and bale residence time has been observed and simple empirical equation has been derived. General conclusions are as follows: the increase of the flow rate of inlet air passing through the boiler furnace results in decrease of the bale residence time and increase of the boiler thermal power.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Even though {{considerable}} {{research has}} been devoted to the drying of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and other pharmaceutical proteins, the majority of this research has focused on lyophilisation or spray drying (SD) for inhalation. Powders for reconstitution and subcutaneous (SC) injection need to comply with a significantly different set of product characteristics than those for inhalation. Therefore, following a formulation screening, the impact of spray drying process parameters on both powder characteristics and short- and long-term stability was determined for a model mAb formulation, using a design of experiments (DoE) approach that combined statistical tools with a set of orthogonal analytical techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS The mAb formulation was spray dried using a ProCepT Micro-Spray with <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rate, inlet air temperature, nozzle air flow rate, feed rate, feed concentration and nozzle diameter as factors which were varied at three levels according to a D-optimal design. The following responses were measured and evaluated for this study: Yield, angle of repose, residual water content (Karl Fischer titration), reconstitution time, particle size distribution (laser diffraction), particle morphology (SEM), solid state characterisation (XRPD and DSC), aggregation (SEC, DLS, OD 600). RESULTS Descriptive statistical models were obtained for several responses, suggesting the <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rate {{to be one of the}} overall most influential process parameters. Large variations in particle morphology were observed with SEM, revealing that particle size distribution models, although statistically significant, were not representative for any relevant powder property. Additionally, the location of powder collection, i. e. collector/cyclone versus transport tube, had a noticeable influence on the particle size distribution of the spray dried powders. CONCLUSIONS Descriptive models were generated for a model mAb, which could prove to be useful tools in improving our understanding of process parameter influences on the mAb stability and particle characteristics of powders for reconstitution. The presented data also emphasises the importance of using orthogonal techniques and keeping the physicochemical meaning of responses in mind when designing a (bio) pharmaceutical drying process. status: publishe...|$|E
