500|$|Kate Flannery, {{who plays}} Meredith, called the episode {{one of her}} {{favorites}} to shoot because she [...] "was stuck in a van with Mindy Kaling, Jenna Fischer, Angela Kinsey, Rashida Jones, Phyllis Smith and Steve Carell for two days." [...] Fischer agreed, calling it a [...] "fun episode to shoot" [...] due to having three days of filming with Carell and The Office women. Believing Meredith's minivan was [...] "another character" [...] in the series, Flannery enjoyed being able to drive and act simultaneously. In {{a reflection of the}} character's personality, the production crew added props such as bottles of alcohol, chips, crushed soda cans, garbage, and 14 air fresheners to the vehicle. The cast however soon developed headaches, leading to the air fresheners' removal. Flannery was able to perform her own stunts for the episode, explaining that she [...] "was nervous at first, but I think <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>could</b> be a demolition-derby star." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for AOL TV, Laura Prudom {{noted that}} the episode [...] "proved to be an undeniably {{satisfying}} hour of television, deepening our understanding of Archie/Jiminy's character and giving us some welcome development in Mary Margaret and David's tragic romance. I don't know about you, but <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>could</b> watch a whole hour of those two playing hangman and innocently flirting and need nothing else from the show." [...] Entertainment Weekly columnist Shaunna Murphy wrote that while she [...] "ragged on Robert Carlyle initially, his campy Rumpel is quickly becoming {{one of my favorite}} parts of this show." [...] Tor.com's Teresa Jusino called Espenson's script [...] "so engaging" [...] because it deviated from the series' typical two-story format and [...] "incorporated a third, separate modern storyline" [...] that featured other characters in addition to Jiminy Cricket, in which [...] "each storyline got just enough attention." [...] She added that the episode's best parts were its [...] "intimate character moments, particularly the scenes between Archie/Jiminy and the boys in his life," [...] and attributed this to Espenson's strength as a writer. Jusino felt another highlight was Sbarge's performance, as he [...] "navigated both Archie and Jiminy’s journeys from being pawns to being their own men with precision and warmth." ...|$|E
500|$|Bond next {{created the}} role of Mad Margaret in Ruddigore (1887; {{originally}} spelt [...] "Ruddygore"), which she regarded as her favourite of all the Gilbert and Sullivan roles, [...] "for it gave me the chance to show what <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>could</b> do as an actress." [...] The part was her largest to date, and Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte made her audition it {{for them to be}} sure that she could handle the responsibility. [...] "It was an awful ordeal. [...] I saw the three white faces looming out of the darkness as they sat close together; criticizing me, talking me over, with cold managerial detachment. It nearly killed me. [...] Perhaps it gave an added realism and abandon to my simulated madness, for indeed I was nearly mad with fear – but at any rate I came through triumphantly, they were all three of them delighted." [...] Bond was particularly nervous on opening night. [...] "I shook and tottered so much that Mad Margaret's staff was no mere adjunct, but an absolute necessity. Without it I should have fallen as I stood in the wings waiting to go on. Then some one gave me a push; I was there, on the stage, in the glare of the footlights, hundreds of eyes fixed on me, tier upon tier of dim white faces rising from floor to ceiling in the gloom. It was enough; I forgot myself, I was Mad Margaret and no one else. I made an immense success." [...] Cellier and Bridgeman seconded this assessment: ...|$|E
