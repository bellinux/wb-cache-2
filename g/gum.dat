5|$|The Māori {{had many}} {{uses for the}} <b>gum,</b> which they called kapia. Fresh <b>gum</b> {{was used as a}} type of chewing <b>gum</b> (older <b>gum</b> was {{softened}} by soaking and mixing with juice of the puha thistle). Highly flammable, the <b>gum</b> was also used as a fire-starter, or bound in flax to act as a torch. Burnt and mixed with animal fat, it made a dark pigment for moko tattooing. Kauri <b>gum</b> was also crafted into jewellery, keepsakes, and small decorative items. Like amber, kauri <b>gum</b> sometimes includes insects and plant material.|$|E
5|$|Baconnaise {{contains}} no bacon, artificial flavors, or MSG, {{but the actual}} process and ingredients in the product are a trade secret. A complete list of the ingredients includes: soybean oil, water, egg yolk, gluconic acid, yeast extract, stabilizer (microcrystalline cellulose, modified food starch, xanthan <b>gum,</b> guar <b>gum,</b> <b>gum</b> arabic), cultured dextrose, salt, sugar, dehydrated garlic, paprika, dehydrated onion, spice, natural smoke flavor, natural flavors, tocopherols, calcium disodium EDTA, and autolyzed yeast extract.|$|E
5|$|By 1850, {{most of the}} surface-lying <b>gum</b> {{had been}} picked up, and people began digging for it. The hillsides yielded shallow-buried <b>gum</b> (about 1m), but in the swamps and beaches, it was buried much further down (4m or below).|$|E

50|$|Northbourne Avenue {{was planted}} with Eucalyptus elata (River Peppermint <b>Gums)</b> between 1983 and 1986, the third {{generation}} of Eucalyptus on the road. The previous generation was Corymbia maculata (spotted <b>gums).</b> The River Peppermint <b>Gums</b> have been cleared for Capital Metro and are to be replanted with Eucalyptus mannifera (Brittle <b>Gums).</b>|$|R
5|$|In 2010, one of {{the trains}} was re-themed to endorse Stride <b>Gum.</b> The train was wrapped in Stride <b>Gum</b> advertisements, showing a {{different}} flavor of Stride <b>gum</b> on each car. The advertisements remained on the train for the entire 2011 season, but were removed {{before the start of}} the 2012 season and replaced with Kia Soul advertising.|$|E
5|$|Kauri <b>gum</b> was Auckland's main export in {{the second}} half of the 19th century, {{sustaining}} much of the early growth of the city. Between 1850 and 1950, 450,000tons of <b>gum</b> were exported. The peak in the <b>gum</b> market was 1899, with 11,116tons exported that year, with a value of £600,000 ($989,700). The average annual export was over 5,000tons, with the average price gained £63 ($103.91) per ton.|$|E
5|$|Kauri <b>gum</b> {{was used}} commercially in varnish, {{and can be}} {{considered}} a type of copal (the name given to resin used in such a way). Kauri <b>gum</b> was found to be particularly good for this, and from the mid-1840s was exported to London and America. Tentative exports had begun a few years earlier, however, for use in marine glue and as fire-kindlers; <b>gum</b> had even made up part of an export cargo to Australia in 1814.|$|E
50|$|The {{eucalypt}} trees include yarra and manna <b>gums,</b> blue <b>gums</b> and Messmates, narrow-leaf peppermint <b>gums,</b> snow <b>gums</b> and Red Stringybarks as well {{as large}} tree ferns. More than 130 species of birds have been recorded in the Mount Cole State Forest which includes this park. Fauna includes echidnas, deer, eastern grey kangaroos, wallabies, possums, gliders and bats.|$|R
50|$|In some instances, bee <b>gums</b> {{are also}} still used, even with bee species that do produce large {{quantities}} of honey (i.e. Apis mellifera nigra). However, in these instances, {{part of the reason}} why bee <b>gums</b> are then used is that this allows the producers of the honey to distinguish themselves from other honey producers and to ask a higher price for the honey. An example where bee <b>gums</b> are still used is Mont-Lozère, France. The length of the bee <b>gums</b> used are rather on the short side; unlike regular bee <b>gums,</b> the bee <b>gums</b> are hollowed out artificially and cut to a specific size.|$|R
25|$|Overly {{vigorous}} or incorrectly performed brushing or flossing {{may cause}} {{injury to the}} gingiva (<b>gums).</b> Improper or over-vigorous brushing may cause sore <b>gums,</b> damage to tooth enamel, gingivitis, and bleeding <b>gums.</b> Dentists and dental hygienists can instruct and demonstrate proper brushing or flossing techniques.|$|R
5|$|Since the kauri <b>gum</b> {{was found}} to mix more easily with linseed oil, at lower temperatures, than other resins, by the 1890s, 70 percent of all oil {{varnishes}} made in England used kauri <b>gum.</b> It was used to a limited extent in paints during the late 19th century, and from 1910 was used extensively {{in the manufacture of}} linoleum. From the 1930s, the market for <b>gum</b> dropped as synthetic alternatives were found, but there remained niche uses for the <b>gum</b> in jewellery and specialist high-grade varnish for violins.|$|E
5|$|The Sale of Food (Prohibition of Chewing <b>Gum)</b> Regulations {{made under}} the Sale of Food Act prohibits the sale or {{advertisement}} for sale of any chewing <b>gum.</b> The prohibition {{does not apply}} to the sale or advertisement of any chewing <b>gum</b> in respect of which a product licence has been granted under the Medicines Act. Thus, it is now possible to purchase chewing <b>gum</b> for dental or medical purposes (for instance, for the purpose of nicotine replacement therapy) from pharmacies without a prescription.|$|E
5|$|While {{the suburb}} still {{contains}} a notable amount of native vegetation, {{and has not}} been exposed to invasive introduced species like other areas have, much of it was originally cleared for grazing and has yet to grow back to the same extent. Before European Settlement Grey Box, SA Blue <b>Gum,</b> Sheoak, Manna <b>Gum</b> and River Red <b>Gum</b> trees were native to and grew in the area, particularly on the slopes leading down to the Adelaide Plains.|$|E
50|$|Healthy <b>gums</b> have a {{firm texture}} that is {{resistant}} to movement, {{and the surface}} texture often exhibits surface stippling. Unhealthy <b>gums,</b> on the other hand, is often swollen and less firm. Healthy <b>gums</b> have an orange-peel like texture to it due to the stippling.|$|R

40|$|A journal {{review of}} <b>gums</b> of {{industrial}} value. There {{is an increasing}} trend towards the use of available plant resources for food and technological applications. One class of ingredients often exploited for their texturizing capabilities are the plant polysaccharides called the hydrocolloids or <b>gums.</b> These compounds are long chain polymers which dissolve in water to give a thickening or viscosity-building effect. Some of these plant polysaccharides have found applications in the food, pharmaceutical, textile, mining and other industries. The United States Food and Drug Administration regulates <b>gums,</b> classifying these compounds as food additives. Though required at usage levels of less than two percent to achieve the desired properties in food systems, <b>gums</b> have become a big business. In 1991 the market of <b>gums</b> reached 126 metric tons at a worth of $ 748. 7 million. There is an increased awareness of the nutritional importance of polysaccharides. The demand for water-soluble polysaccharide <b>gums</b> including the seaweed extracts, seed <b>gums,</b> plant exudates and cellulose derivatives, has slowly increased {{over the past few}} years along with population growth and the advent of easy to prepare foods. Effective use of <b>gums</b> requires that their chemical and physical properties be understood as much as possible. This article gives a review of some of the polysaccharide <b>gums</b> of industrial value...|$|R
5|$|As {{early as}} the 1830s and 1840s, merchants, {{including}} Gilbert Mair and Logan Campbell, were buying <b>gum</b> from local Māori for £5 ($8.25) a ton, or trading it for goods. The majority of the <b>gum</b> was exported to America and London (from whence it was distributed throughout Europe), although smaller amounts were sent to Australia, Hong Kong, Japan and Russia.|$|E
5|$|In the Gibraltar Range National Park, it is a {{dominant}} shrub of open heathland and a non-dominant shrub of closed heath, mostly found in swampy heath associated with sedges. Plants here have {{some degree of}} self-compatibility. In the Sydney region, it grows in association with heath banksia (Banksia ericifolia), old man banksia (B.serrata), mountain devil (Lambertia formosa), lance-leaved geebung (Persoonia lanceolata) and dwarf apple (Angophora hispida) in heathland, and with silvertop ash (Eucalyptus sieberi), Blue Mountains ash (E.oreades), Sydney peppermint (E.piperita), scribbly <b>gum</b> (E.haemastoma), Blue Mountains mallee ash (E.stricta), brittle <b>gum</b> (E.mannifera), snow <b>gum</b> (E.pauciflora) and red bloodwood (Corymbia gummifera) in forested areas.|$|E
5|$|Kauri <b>gum</b> is a fossilised resin detracted from kauri trees (Agathis australis), {{which is}} made into crafts such as jewellery. Kauri forests once covered much of the North Island of New Zealand, before Māori and European {{settlers}} caused deforestation, causing several areas to revert to sand dunes, scrubs, and swamps. Even afterward, ancient kauri fields continued to provide a source for the <b>gum</b> and the remaining forests.|$|E
5000|$|Fruit <b>Gums</b> are {{primarily}} composed of glucose syrup and fruit juices {{and are therefore}} similar to wine <b>gums</b> (another British confectionery item). Originally the purple fruit <b>gums</b> were referred to as [...] "blusterberry", but this changed to blackcurrant in the 1990s after a failed advertising campaign.|$|R
30|$|Of note, the {{relationship}} between absorbed doses per 131 I activity {{and the number of}} chewing <b>gums</b> yielded no correlations. Specifically, Spearman's rank correlation coefficients and P values (within parentheses) were − 0.40 (0.02) for the number of chewing <b>gums</b> within the 4 -h interval, − 0.20 (0.25) for the number of chewing <b>gums</b> after the first PET/CT scan, and − 0.24 (0.17) for the total number of <b>gums</b> chewed on the first day.|$|R

5|$|Between Sydney and Brisbane, B.integrifolia {{is found}} up to 200 {{kilometres}} (125mi) inland, with B.integrifolia subsp. monticola {{occurring in the}} Blue Mountains at altitudes up to 1500 metres (5000ft). There it grows on better quality volcanic or rocky soils derived from granites and basalts, and would experience up to 100 frosts per year. In this montane habitat, it occurs in association with Eucalyptus species such as E.viminalis (manna <b>gum)</b> and E.pauciflora (snow <b>gum),</b> and also rainforest species such as Nothofagus moorei (Antarctic beech) and Orites excelsa (prickly ash).|$|E

5000|$|<b>Gummed</b> (water activated) tape {{dispensers}} measure, dispense, moisten, and cut <b>gummed</b> or water-activated adhesive tape. This tape {{is often}} {{composed of a}} paper backing and adhesive glue that is unable to adhere until it is [...] "activated" [...] by contact with water. To perform this step, <b>gummed</b> dispensers often employ a water bottle and wetting brush to moisten each piece of tape as it is dispensed. Many <b>gummed</b> dispensers feature a heater, which is mounted over the feed area to maintain the dispenser’s water temperature. These heaters ensure maximum wetting, and are ideal in cold climates. <b>Gummed</b> tape dispensers are often used in packaging or shipping departments for closing corrugated boxes.|$|R

5|$|Carnaby's black {{cockatoo}} {{is found}} in Eucalyptus woodland, most commonly of wandoo (Eucalyptus wandoo) or salmon <b>gum</b> (E. salmonophloia). It is also found nearby pine plantations and sandplains or kwongan heath with abundant Hakea, Banksia, and Grevillea shrubs.|$|E
5|$|Donald is {{armed with}} a special gun that can shoot plungers, popcorn or bubble <b>gum.</b> Donald has {{unlimited}} plungers which can temporarily stun enemies (though bosses can still be damaged with plungers), and can collect popcorn and <b>gum</b> along the way or get the latter from Gyro Gearloose. Later in the game, the plunger is upgraded {{to act as a}} temporary platform to climb walls with and, when stuck to a passing bird, allows Donald to traverse longer distances. In Duckburg, India and Egypt, Donald can also pick up chili peppers which increase his temper, eventually temporarily allowing him to become invincible, increase his speed and knock out enemies in his path.|$|E

40|$|<b>Gums</b> {{are high}} {{molecular}} weight carbohydrates which are precipitated from sugar processing solutions with acidified alcohol. Previous research reported that <b>gums</b> found in sugar processing streams contribute to processing problems and reduced sugar recoveries. <b>Gums</b> arise from the metabolism within the sugarcane plant and from external microbial activity during both cane handling and cane processing, and concentrate in final molasses (FM) streams. An investigation of <b>gums</b> found in the FM from six South African sugarcane mills was conducted by the Sugar Milling Research Institute NPC on weekly samples received during the 2011 / 2012 milling season. The <b>gums</b> were isolated from the samples and their composition and structure were determined by gas chromatography mass spectroscopy. Other analyses reported on the FM samples include the measurement of pol, brix, dry solids, sugars, ash, target purity difference and viscosity. This study details how the composition {{and structure of the}} FM <b>gums</b> differs within and between the mills investigated over the 2011 / 2012 season. Also highlighted are differences in the <b>gums</b> between mills processing irrigated cane and those that process rainfed cane...|$|R
40|$|<b>Gums</b> {{refer to}} a type of polysaccharides which are used to {{increase}} viscosity and create some other functional properties such as thickening agent, emulsifying agent, stabilizer, crystal inhibitor and so forth. They are classifying based on their nature and originality including, microbial, plant, exudate and animal <b>Gums.</b> This article shortly reviews a group of plant <b>Gums</b> and recent findings in their application. <b>Gums</b> or Hydrocolloids are main compounds which create stability of emulsion via entering into water phase. The importance of these compounds is on viscosity and electrostatic reactions to stabilize nonalcoholic emulsion with below properties; 1) easily soluble in cold water, 2) the lowest amount of viscosity in water, 3) having maximum level of emulsifier amount, 4) no creation of gelling. Diversity and functionality of <b>Gums</b> and regarding their still novelty in food industries have made <b>Gums</b> {{one of the main}} additives in food formulations. Since sourced of <b>Gums</b> are different we must focus on using them together to improve their synergistic effect but interactions among them and combined matrixes produced by them also need to be studied in details...|$|R
