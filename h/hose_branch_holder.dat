50|$|The Limited access {{vehicle was}} adapted by service {{workshops}} {{to carry a}} portable pump, ladder, lengths of <b>hoses</b> and <b>branches</b> and 2 sets of BA. The LAV is designed to navigate around the very small streets of Polperro and is towed to the incident by an L4P.|$|R
50|$|The Green Goddess {{carried a}} range of {{equipment}} from standard <b>hose</b> and <b>branches,</b> through a selection of nozzles to provide different flows and jet patterns, to Light Portable Pumps and Ceiling Arresters. They all carried a 33.5 ft extension ladder, together {{with at least one}} scaling ladder. Some carried additional equipment, such as hook ladders, radios, large bolt cutters, etc.|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a process and a device for the mounting of hoses, in particular non-rigid hoses, permitted assembly suitable for mass production involving short assembly times for hoses with different dimensions (length, diameter, shape) and having two or more <b>hose</b> ends (<b>branched</b> <b>hose).</b> After fixing the first hose end, {{it is possible to}} assemble the second or further hose ends suspended in space to connectors. For this purpose, devices provide hose clips as well as devices for non-rigid hoses. Measuring devices attached to the gripper and monitoring the gripping and jointing processes determine the position of the hose ends by measuring the presence of the hose, the gripping force, the position of the gripper jaws, the jointing path and hose slip in the gripper and making corrections by means of control devices...|$|R

25|$|There are older, {{traditional}} plant holders {{that may}} be used or one of the following modern counterparts can be selected: Pinpoint Holder, or kenzan, which is a steel or lead block with sharp points for use with thick and soft stems; Turtle Holder, or kame-dome, which is glass, metal, or actual turtle shells with holes made for stems; Crab Holder, or kani-dome, which is comparable to Turtle Holder, but with crab instead; Whirlpool holder, or kazesui-domei, that has two oblong shapes that are attached to imitate swirling water; and Tripod, or gotoku-dome, which is used to keep a kettle over a hibachi stove. Other plant holders include bundled straw or water lily stems, or komi-wara, which are utilized for portable arrangements, and another holder similar to komi-wara, florist oasis, which is a light foam usually used commercially. A <b>Branch</b> <b>Holder,</b> or kubari; Horse-Bit Holder, or kutsuwa-dome; Circle Holder, or shippo; and Slatty Holder, or yaen-kubari, may all be used to keep the arrangement in place.|$|R
5000|$|The PRC is {{composed}} of five Commissioners—each of whom is appointed to a six-year term of office by the President and confirmed by the Senate, similar to many other high-level Executive <b>Branch</b> office <b>holders.</b> As with Postal Governors, PRC commissioners are permitted to serve for one additional [...] "holdover" [...] year beyond {{the end of their}} term if a replacement has not been nominated and confirmed. The President designates one Commissioner as Chairman of the Commission. The Commissioners together designate one of their number as a Vice-Chairman for a one-year term. No more than three of the Commissioners can be from any one political party.|$|R
5000|$|In June 2012, during {{proceedings}} that {{related to}} the appointment of an administrator to HSUeast, Federal Court Justice Geoffery Flick criticised attempts by Jackson, through her solicitors, to directly contact him while proceedings were under way. Jackson subsequently responded by sacking her legal representatives and asking the judge to disqualify himself from the proceedings. At the end of June 2012, Justice Flick ordered that former judge Michael Moore be appointed administrator of HSUeast, that all federal and state <b>branch</b> office <b>holders</b> lose their positions and the branch be demerged to become separate NSW and Victorian-based unions. Justice Flick found that Jackson should not keep her position in the HSUeast because [...] "she is very much at the epicentre of the dispute".|$|R
5000|$|During 1982, <b>Holder</b> <b>branched</b> into {{production}} {{and worked with}} his old school friend Phil Burnell and his band Three Phase on one single [...] "All I Want To Do Is (Fall in Love With You)", which was the band's only release. Holder and Burnell produced the single together, and it was published under Noddy Holder Music Ltd./Whild John Music Ltd., and released via Speed Records. The single did not enter the UK chart, as it received limited promotion.|$|R
40|$|Carbon nanofibers {{have been}} grown at room {{temperature}} {{using a combination of}} radio frequency and microwave assisted plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. The nanofibers were grown, using Ni powder catalyst, onto substrates kept {{at room temperature}} by using a purposely designed water-cooled sample <b>holder.</b> <b>Branched</b> carbon nanofiber growth was obtained without using a template resulting in interconnected carbon nanofiber network formation on substrates held at room temperature. This method would allow room-temperature direct synthesized nanofiber networks over relatively large areas, for a range of temperature sensitive substrates, such as organic materials, plastics, and other polymers of interest for nanoelectronic two-dimensional networks, nanoelectromechanical devices, nanoactuators, and composite materials...|$|R
5000|$|Maréchal d'Empire, or Marshal of the Empire, {{was not a}} [...] "rank" [...] {{within the}} French Army, but a {{personal}} title granted to distinguished Divisional generals, along with higher pay and privileges. The same applied to the Corps commanders (General de Corps d'armee) and army commanders (General en chef). The highest permanent [...] "rank" [...] in Napoleon's army was actually Général de division and those higher than it were positions of the same rank but with separate insignia for appointment holders. [...] The position of Colonel General of a branch (such as Dragoons or Grenadiers of the Guard) was akin to Chief Inspector-General of that <b>branch,</b> whose office <b>holder</b> used his current officer rank and its corresponding insignia.|$|R
60|$|The attack had {{now become}} general. The firemen swarmed {{in at the}} doors and windows the moment that it was {{possible}} for a human being to breathe the smoke and live. One of the engines attached two additional lengths of <b>hose,</b> dragged the <b>branch</b> through the first floor {{to the back of the}} house, got upon an outhouse, in at a back window, and attacked the foe in rear. On the roof, Frank and Dale were plying their hatchets, their tall figures sharply defined against the wintry sky, and looking more gigantic than usual. The enemy saved them the trouble of cutting through, however, for it suddenly burst upwards, and part of the roof fell in. It would certainly have taken Frank prisoner had not Dale caught him by the collar, and dragged him out of danger. Instantly a branch was pointed downwards, and the foe was beaten back; from above, below, before, and behind, it was now met with deluges of water, which fell on the shoulders of the men in the lower floor in a continuous hot shower, while they stood ankle-deep in hot water.|$|R
5000|$|Hosewater. Hosewater was a {{bottled water}} company {{started by the}} local McElroy family. Using the slogan [...] "One sip keeps it simple," [...] Hosewater offers water that has been run through a garden hose so as to bring back {{memories}} of youth and summertime, when children will often drink from the outdoor hose. After succeeding wildly with original Green <b>Hose</b> flavor, Hosewater <b>branched</b> out into Black Hose, Hosewater Light, and Energy Plus flavors. Once local beverage competitor Tee-Tee Slott began offering a new product, Slott Juice Hose, Hosewater retaliated by selling Hosejuice. After the patriarch of the McElroy family, Reo McElroy, was caught making online racist comments regarding the company his mistress was keeping, the Murfreesboro Bottled Water Association confiscated the McElroy family hose. However, shortly thereafter, Dom Podge returned from the Bundy Ranch standoff with the actual Bundy ranch hose, Reo McElroy began offering a new product, Freedom Water. He also founded his own bottled beverage association, the Murfreesboro Water Bottle Association. In the wake of Tee Tee Slot assuming mayoral power following the McKinley-Sullivan feud (see below), Reo McElroy has threatened to secede {{from the city and}} establish his own municipality of Hoseboro.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Holder</b> <b>branched</b> {{out into}} variety and cabaret performances, {{appearing}} in many countries, {{as well as}} at London venues including the London Palladium, Lyceum and Paramount. Holder often gave his time to charity fund raising events as well and maintained a busy roster of performances. Later bills were shared with Bill Haley and his Comets, Guy Mitchell and Johnnie Ray. In 1963, he appeared at the National Jazz and Blues Festival held at Richmond. In 1964, Holder compared the BBC One series Carnival, working with many artists including Ginger Johnson, Carmen Munroe and Geoff Love with his Orchestra. In that year he also performed for Peter Sellers and Britt Ekland for their wedding party at the luxury Tiberio Restaurant Mayfair. In 1966, Holder appeared with the BBC Radio Orchestra and in the following year Holder was involved in recording project with John Dankworth featuring the actress singer Nadia Cattouse. In 1972, Holder was one of the winners of the Castlebar Song Contest, for the folk ballad [...] "Song for Jenny", composed by Sheila Roberts. In 1974, Holder was invited to sing with the Scottish Symphony Orchestra at a Royal Albert Hall Promenade Concert with the soprano Margaret Gale and the BBC Chorus. In 1990 he appeared with the BBC Big Band at Fairfield Halls, Croydon. In 1991 he played congas and bongos on an album by Barbara Thompson's band Paraphernalia entitled Breathless, which also features drummer Jon Hiseman, bassist Phil Mulford and guitarist Malcolm MacFarlane.|$|R
