50|$|Despite the {{popularity}} of the Griffey card, it was not a scarce card. The card was situated in the top left hand corner of the uncut sheets and was more liable to be cut poorly or have its corners dinged. Company policy was that if a customer found a damaged card in its package, the company would replace it. Many Griffey cards were returned and the result was that Upper Deck printed many uncut sheets (sheets consisting of 100 cards) of just Ken Griffey, Jr. According to Professional Sports Authenticator, the Ken Griffey, Jr. would become the most graded card of all time with the company. PSA graded over 50,000 of the cards. The Beckett <b>Grading</b> <b>card</b> service has evaluated over 25,000 of the Ken Griffey, Jr. rookie cards.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} an increase in product quality information to consumers on firms' choices of product quality. In 1998 Los Angeles County introduced hygiene quality <b>grade</b> <b>cards</b> to be displayed in restaurant windows. We show that the <b>grade</b> <b>cards</b> cause (i) restaurant health inspection scores to increase, (ii) consumer demand to become sensitive to changes in restaurants' hygiene quality, and (iii) the number of foodborne illness hospitalizations to decrease. We also provide evidence that this improvement in health outcomes is not fully explained by consumers substituting from poor hygiene restaurants to good hygiene restaurants. These results imply that the <b>grade</b> <b>cards</b> cause restaurants to make hygiene quality improvements. © 2001 the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. The {{purpose of}} this paper is to conduct a {{literature}} review of research relating to foodborne illness, food inspection policy, and restaurants in the United States. Aim 1 : To convey the public health importance of studying restaurant food inspection policies and suggest that more research is needed in this field, Aim 2 : To conduct a systematic literature review of recent literature pertaining to this subject such that future researchers can understand the: (1) Public perception and expectations of restaurant food inspection policies; (2) Arguments in favor of a <b>grade</b> <b>card</b> policy; and, conversely; (3) Reasons why inspection policies may not work. ^ Data/methods. This paper utilizes a systematic review format to review articles relating to food inspections and restaurants in the U. S. Eight articles were reviewed. ^ Results. The resulting data from the literature provides no conclusive answer as to how, when, and in what method inspection policies should be carried out. The authors do, however, put forward varying solutions as to how to fix the problem of foodborne illness outbreaks in restaurants. These solutions include the implementation of <b>grade</b> <b>cards</b> in restaurants and, conversely, a complete overhaul of the inspection policy system. ^ Discussion. The literature on foodborne disease, food inspection policy, and restaurants in the U. S. is limited and varied. But, from the research that is available, we can see that two schools of thought exist. The first of these calls for the implementation of a <b>grade</b> <b>card</b> system, while the second proposes a reassessment and possible overhaul of the food inspection policy system. It is still unclear which of these methods would best slow the increase in foodborne disease transmission in the U. S. ^ Conclusion. In order to arrive at solutions to the problem of foodborne disease transmission as it relates to restaurants in this country, we may need to look at literature from other countries and, subsequently, begin incremental changes in the way inspection policies are developed and enforced. ...|$|R

40|$|How can {{consumers}} {{be assured}} that firms will endeavor to provide good quality when quality is unobservable prior to purchase? We test the hypothesis that reputational incentives are effective at causing restaurants to maintain good hygiene quality. We find that chain affiliation provides reputational incentives and franchised units tend to free-ride on chain reputation. We also show that regional variation {{in the degree of}} repeat customers affects the strength of reputational incentives for good hygiene at both chain and nonchain restaurants. Despite these incentives, a policy intervention in the form of posted hygiene <b>grade</b> <b>cards</b> causes significant improvements in restaurant hygiene. (JEL I 18, I 19, L 14, L 83). ...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{prominence of}} standardized testing to assess student learning motivated the current investigation. We propose that standardized achievement test scores assess competencies determined more by intelligence than by self-control, whereas report <b>card</b> <b>grades</b> assess competencies determined more by self-control than by intelligence. In particular, {{we suggest that}} intelligence helps students learn and solve problems independent of formal instruction, whereas self-control helps students study, complete homework, and behave positively in the classroom. Two longitudinal, prospective studies of middle school students support predictions from this model. In both samples, IQ predicted changes in standardized achievement test scores over time better than did self-control, whereas self-control predicted changes in report <b>card</b> <b>grades</b> over time better than did IQ. As expected, the effect of self-control on changes in report <b>card</b> <b>grades</b> was mediated in Study 2 by teacher ratings of homework completion and classroom conduct. In a third study, ratings of middle school teachers about the content and purpose of standardized achievement tests and report <b>card</b> <b>grades</b> {{were consistent with the}} proposed model.

50|$|Two Stanford University {{economics}} {{researchers found}} that higher lettered restaurants scored a rise in revenue, while lower lettered restaurants have seen their revenues decline. The quality of restaurants in the entire county became more acceptable, with the average score going up from about 75% to nearly 90% in the year after restaurant grading was implemented. The researchers concluded that the results were not explained solely by consumers switching to higher quality restaurants, {{and that some of}} the effect had to do with restaurants making changes due to <b>grade</b> <b>cards.</b> Another study estimated a 13.1% reduction in hospitalization for food borne illnesses in the year following implementation of the program, suggesting that implementing a restaurant grading program could improve public safety.|$|R
50|$|Some {{graphics}} cards can {{be linked}} together to allow scaling of the graphics processing across multiple cards. This is done using either the PCIe bus on the motherboard, or, more commonly, a data bridge. Generally, the cards must be of the same model to be linked, and most low power cards {{are not able to}} be linked in this way. AMD and Nvidia both have proprietary methods of scaling, CrossFireX for AMD, and SLI for Nvidia. Cards from different chipset manufacturers, architectures cannot be used together for multi card scaling. If a graphics card has different sizes of memory, the lowest value will be used, with the higher values being disregarded. Currently, scaling on consumer <b>grade</b> <b>cards</b> can be done using up to four cards.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two empirical studies of the industrial organization of food retailing. Chapter 1 investigates consumer behavior in response to changes in variety in grocery store offerings. Using a rich panel dataset of consumer purchases from one national retailer, we measure the effects of changes in product variety on sales of ice cream, where the assortment changes were gradually introduced to stores. We use a difference in differences approach to measure treatment effects against trends in stores prior to treatment. Our results show an adjustment to product variety causes consumers to alter their purchasing behavior, {{at least in the}} subsequent eight weeks of the change. When the rearrangement consisted of adding additional products, consumers purchased more on average in the immediate term, but sales increases mitigated over time, with smaller magnitude increases in variety experiencing sales reductions in later weeks. Product groups treated with reduced variety experienced decreased sales both in the immediate and longer term. We find that extending and reducing assortment have asymmetric effects, with a marginal change to increased variety boosting sales less than a marginal change in decreased variety. Larger magnitude reductions perform poorly in the short run, but actually perform better than both smaller variety reductions and small variety increases in later weeks. In Chapter 2, I investigate the following question: do firms respond to quality disclosure by nearby competitors? This paper utilizes exogenous variation provided by Los Angeles County's introduction of restaurant hygiene <b>grade</b> <b>cards</b> to explore inter-firm responses in markets for differentiated goods. Under this program, a subset of cities adopted mandatory <b>grade</b> <b>card</b> posting, requiring restaurants to disclose hygiene. This study demonstrates that restaurants under a voluntary hygiene disclosure policy improved hygiene more when located closer to restaurants in mandatory disclosure areas. The proximity effect implies that mandatory disclosure policies influenced restaurant hygiene in nearby voluntary disclosure areas, thus providing direct evidence that quality-disclosure regulations affect non-targeted firms...|$|R
