40|$|Background: The {{knowledge}} of underlying mechanisms {{for the maintenance}} and spread of musculoskeletal pain is limited. Pain is a complex subjective experience influenced {{by a variety of}} factors. The focus of the present thesis is on possible mechanisms associated with chronic generalized musculoskeletal pain, and factors of importance for the variation in reports of pain intensity and sensory symptoms in subjects with localized and generalized musculoskeletal pain. Aims: The specific aims were to investigate: 1) whether sympathoadrenal and cortisol responses were attenuated and associated with pain intensity and muscle fatigue during exercise in subjects with fibromyalgia (FM) compared with healthy controls; 2) {{the reliability and validity of}} two different pain assessment strategies of recalled pain intensity in subjects with localized (LP) and generalized (GP) musculoskeletal pain; 3) whether pain intensity, number of painful body areas and emotional distress were associated with neuropathic symptoms in subjects with musculoskeletal pain Materials and methods: Sympathoadrenal and cortisol responses, pain intensity and muscular responses were compared between subjects with fibromyalgia and their matched healthy controls during dynamic bicycling and static repetitive contractions (papers I and II). Pain intensity, neuropathic symptoms (LANSS), and number of painful body areas were reported over the first week in four subsequent months and compared in subjects with LP and GP (papers III and IV). Pain intensity was assessed as recalls of pain intensity during the last 24 hours (daily recalls) (papers I-III) and the last seven days (weekly recalls) (papers I-IV). Real-time pain intensity was assessed moment by moment during <b>exercise</b> (<b>papers</b> I and II) and during one week in every day life (paper III). Results: Compared with the healthy controls the FM patients exhibited lower peak oxygen uptake and lower MVC (papers I and II), similar physiological responses during dynamic exercise (paper I), but lower plasma adrenaline responses and higher relative EMG during static repetitive exercise (paper II). The catecholamine responses were not associated with real-time pain intensity and muscle fatigue during <b>exercise</b> (<b>papers</b> I and II). Real-time pain intensity increased during exercise, but no increase was reported in recalled pain comparing the week before and after exercise. Across four months the average of daily ratings of recalled pain intensity conducted over a week were lower and corresponded better with the average of multiple real-time ratings than single ratings of weekly recalls. The GP group obtained lower reliability of pain intensity than the LP group and overestimated weekly recalled pain compared to real-time pain. The overestimation increased with increasing pain intensity (paper III). The LANSS scores were stable over time and positively associated with number of painful body areas, pain intensity, and emotional distress. In multiple regression analysis emotional distress and the diagnosis of fibromyalgia remained the final predictors of neuropathic symptoms (paper IV). Conclusion: This study showed attenuated adrenaline responses in FM during static repetitive exercise, but no clear relationship between altered physiological responses and exercise related pain. Pain intensity varied considerably according to context and the assessment method applied. Generalized pain and emotional distress were the main factors influencing the reports of pain and sensory symptoms. In future studies, the causal relationship between emotional distress and development of generalized pain and associated symptoms need further exploration...|$|E
40|$|Regular {{physical}} activity prevents and improves {{a number of}} disease conditions and reduces the risk for premature death substantially. From a clinical {{as well as a}} basic science point of view it is important to create a more fundamental understanding of the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the improved functional capacity induced by regular {{physical activity}}. Skeletal muscle tissue exhibits a remarkable ability to adapt to altered demands. Training adaptations include increased capillarisation, altered glycolytic flux and increased mitochondrial density and occur in response to repeated bouts of exercise. Skeletal muscle hypoxia has been addressed as one possible primary stimulus for adaptation to training. Hypoxia Inducible Factor- 1 (HIF- 1) has been suggested to be a master regulator of hypoxic transcription. Out of the HIF- 1 regulated factors, several are known to be affected by exercise or associated with processes important for exercise adaptation e. g. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), involved in exercise induced angiogenesis. Therefore, the principal aim of the thesis was to investigate a possible activation of and role for HIF- 1 in skeletal muscle adaptation to exercise. Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained from m. vastus lateralis in three human experimental set-ups; a single bout of <b>exercise</b> (<b>Papers</b> I and III), four weeks of endurance training (V) and elite athletes (V). In addition, two different mouse models were used, skeletal muscle specific HIF- 1 α KO mice exposed to six weeks of endurance training (IV) and electrically induced contractions in isolated mouse EDL and Soleus muscle (II). A single bout of exercise activated HIF- 1, including protein stabilization, translocation to the nucleus, increased binding to target gene promoters and increased target gene expression (e. g. VEGF and VEGFR 1) in both human and mouse skeletal muscle (I-III). However, the HIF- 1 α KO mice showed several of the features typically associated with a trained muscle, especially in respect of mitochondrial characteristics. This was suggested to at least in part be due to reduced activity of the HIF- 1 inducible inhibitor of pyruvate dehydrogenase, pyruvate dehydrogense kinase 1 (PDK 1). Recent studies suggest that the acute activation of HIF- 1 target genes may be blunted after a period of exercise training. In Paper V it was hypothesized that a possible training induced moderation of HIF- 1 activity would be reflected in skeletal muscle PDK 1 levels. The results showed that PDK 1 levels were significantly lower in elite athletes compared to moderately active individuals. Furthermore, a possible mechanism for moderating HIF- 1 activity in response to endurance training was introduced. HIF- 1 stability is known to be regulated by hydroxylation of critical proline residues by prolyl hydroxylase 1 - 3 (PHD 1 - 3) with consequent proteasomal degradation. PHD 2 had the highest expression of the three prolyl hydroxylases in human skeletal muscle and PHD 2 levels were increased by training and higher in the elite trained athletes. Evidence of a regulatory link between PHD activity and PDK 1 levels in human skeletal muscle was provided by inhibiting PHD activity in human primary myoblasts, resulting in increased PDK 1 levels (V). From the results of Papers I-V it was proposed that an initial activation of HIF- 1 may drive angiogenesis adaptation in the early phase of training, but the seeming attenuation of the HIF- 1 response later in a training period may represent a switch toward a higher capacity to activate the oxidative system...|$|E
