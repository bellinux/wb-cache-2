40|$|Knowledge of the {{distribution}} of species life stages at multiple spatial scales is fundamental to both a proper assessment of species management and conservation programmes and the ability to predict the consequences of human disturbances for river systems. The habitat requirements of three native cyprinid species—the Iberian barbel Barbus bocagei Steindachner, the <b>Iberian</b> straight-mouth <b>nase</b> Pseudochondrostoma polylepis (Steindachner), and the Northern straight-mouth nase Pseudochondrostoma duriense (Coelho) —were examined at 174 undisturbed or minimally disturbed sites in 8 river catchments across western Iberia, by modelling occurrence and counts of species life stages at two spatial scales— large (regional) and instream (local) —using hurdle models. All the life stages of the barbel showed a negative association with upstream high-gradient river reaches, whereas juvenile P. duriense favoured such areas. Stream width and openness were negatively related with the occurrence of juvenile and small adult barbel, but not with large adults. Juvenile nase, on the other hand, were found to be mainly confined to fast-flowing habitats with high instream cover and coarser substrata. Advanced life stages of the barbel were mainly associated with the ‘‘pure’’ regional and shared components, whereas the purely local attributes accounted for much of the model variation among nases, in particular juveniles, and juvenile barbel. The results of this study are useful for setting or refining management goals, and highlight the need to separately consider life stages when performing conservation-related studies of species distribution...|$|R

50|$|The Lisbon’s arched-mouth nase {{is a small}} cyprinid. Adults {{range from}} 5 to 11 cm, though there are records of {{specimens}} reaching ca. 18 cm. It can be distinguished from the other <b>Iberian</b> <b>nase</b> species {{by the lack of}} horny blade on the lower jaw, the absence of intense reddish coloration {{at the base of the}} fins and by its pronouncedly arched mouth. It has elongated pelvic fins that reach the anus and often pass the anal-fin insertion in males, and dorsal, pelvic and anal fins usually have 8 branched rays. This species has 36 to 43 scales in the lateral line, 7.0 to 8.5 scales above the lateral line, 13 to 16 circumpeduncular scales, denticulated (vs. smooth) grinding teeth surfaces, 6-5/5 pharyngeal teeth and 15 to 19 gill rakers. It is further distinguished from Iberochondrostoma lusitanicum, a phylogenetically close species that lives in the same area, by having a higher body, a relatively longer head, and a larger eye. The origins of anal and pelvic fins are displaced anteriorly, while the origin of pectoral fins is displaced posteriorly. Pelvic and pectoral fins and last anal-fin ray are longer in the new species. Unlike the other phylogenetically related species, the Lisbon’s arched-mouth nase shows external sexual dimorphism, with males having longer pelvic fins whose extremities pass the anus and often overlap with the anal fin.|$|E
40|$|Concern about ecological, {{social and}} {{economic}} losses caused by stream degradation has recently stimulated major conservation and managements efforts worldwide. In Mediterranean rivers, the problem is exacerbated by the higher demand for freshwater. A rehabilitation program was undertaken in a Mediterranean river segment affected by intensive agriculture, unstable banks and degradation of the riparian gallery. Moreover, it will be further impacted by a water supply dam, which is presently under construction. To assess potential habitat enhancement for the different life stages of two critically endangered cyprinid species – the <b>Iberian</b> <b>nase</b> Iberochondrostoma almacai and the Iberian chub Squalius aradensis – five different restoration scenarios were considered, simulated and compared with the unmodified segment (control), in terms of Weighted Usable Area (WUA), {{by means of a}} two dimensional hydraulic model, the River 2 D. Results showed that habitat improvement was best achieved for both species life-stages, when considering the introduction of islands {{in the middle of the}} channel (mean % increase of WUA...|$|E

40|$|An {{application}} of a new automated fish counting device – the Riverwatcher System (RW) – was used to monitor upstream fish movements in a pool-and-weir fish pass in the River Zeˆ zere, Portugal, for 141 days from June 2002 to May 2003. Fish populations were also collected downstream using multimesh gillnets (5 different mesh sizes ranging from 30 mm to 85 mm knot to knot; ratio between mesh sizes of about 1. 30) and electrofishing for comparison with fish records produced by the RW. More than 3000 individual <b>Iberian</b> <b>nase</b> Chondrostoma polylepis ascended the fish pass and moved through the RW during the study period. However, only 18 % of the records produced by the RW contained silhouettes similar to fish; no individual smaller than 15 cm TL was recorded by the counter. Most seasonal movements (73. 9 %) occurred in spring and were associated with reproduction. Displacements seemed to occur independently of time of day. Water temperature (range: 12 – 22 C) was the only significant environmental variable (P < 0. 01) influencing upstream movements of this species. Further development of hardware and software {{will be necessary to}} improve performance of the counter, particularly in Mediterranean rivers, where more turbid waters and a greater proportion of small-size species are presen...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{understand}} the structure of fish assemblages in the modified Lima basin (Northern Portugal), two distinct datasets concerning the presence and abundance of fish species were subjected to multivariate analysis. On the River Lima two types of flow modification are present within kilometres of one another: (a) a reduced and constant flow due to hypolimnetic release; and (b) an intense and irregular flow. A comparison of their influence on fish assemblages revealed a gradient of assemblage types from tributaries to main river sites. The latter were characterised by a strong dominance of cyprinids, particularly Iberian barbel (Barbus bocagei). The former harboured two kinds of fish assemblages: those closer to the river mouth were dominated by the cyprinids Iberian chub (Squalius carolitertii) and <b>Iberian</b> <b>nase</b> (Chondrostoma polylepis), which were also frequently present in the main river; while in those further upstream the predominant species was the brown trout (Salmo trutta). Although explanatory variables such as distance from source, altitude, substrate coarseness and width were the primary correlates of fish assemblage composition, dam construction and flow regulation also had a significant effect upon assemblage structure, particularly by: i) reducing the importance of migratory species; ii) constraining the presence of trout in the regulated segments; and iii) simplifying the community, {{especially in the case of}} the constant and reduced flow regime...|$|E

40|$|The otter is {{widespread}} {{through all the}} Parque Natural Sierra Norte de Sevilla and surrounding areas. We found that the otter varied its intensity of use of habitat {{in the course of}} the portion of the longitudinal gradient defined as headwaters-middle reaches. The otter tended to use more intensively middle reaches instead of headwaters, related to food sources availability. The otter fed on 20 different preys: 11 different freshwater fish species (The Iberian barbell, calandino, the sun fish, the Iberian sandsmelt, the Iberian chub, the <b>Iberian</b> <b>nase,</b> pardilla and common trout), seven vertebrates (common frogs, common toads, urodels, water snakes, birds y micromamifers) and two invertebrates (the red swamp crayfish and insects). Within all these preys the Iberian barbell (Barbus sclateri), the red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) and common frog (Rana perezi) stood out in order of preference. 61 % of preys and 84 % of total biomass corresponded to freshwater fish individuals. This fact underlines the high importance that freshwater fish had for the otters´ diet within the study area. However, otter’s diet showed a faithfully pattern in relation to preys availability, since they mainly fed on the most available preys. This general pattern must be specified, as the otter tended to select or reject some fish species and/or fish sizes. Long sized fishes were specially consumed except for the sun fish (Lepomis gibbosus) with which this general pattern appeared inverted. In summary we can say that the Sierra Norte´s otter population is in good or very good health...|$|E
40|$|Research ArticleOver {{the last}} decade {{there has been a}} major {{rise in the number of}} {{attempts}} at fish conservation and management as a response to the widespread degradation of aquatic ecosystems. The assessments involved are rarely planned and executed with inputs from the species life history, particularly their microhabitat use over space and time. The seasonal and sizerelated microhabitat use of two critically endangered cyprinids – the <b>Iberian</b> <b>nase</b> Iberochondrostoma almacai and Iberian chub Squalius aradensis – was examined at seven sites across four small catchments in southwest Portugal. Both species displayed nonrandom microhabitat use. In autumn, nase preferred more sheltered (> 50 % cover) habitats with small substrata (organic cover and silt) than in summer, while chub were found to occupy significantly fasterflowing habitats areas (> 10 cm/s) with coarser substrata (> 50 mm particle size) in the spring than in the rest of the year. Size-related analyses indicated that young-of-year (yoy) nase used coarser substrata (> 5 mm particle size) and more exposed habitats ( 50 mm particle size) and faster-flowing areas (> 10 cm/s) than yoy and juveniles. Based on these findings, it was possible to assign the species to ecological guilds and to classify them as limnophilic (nase) and eurytopic and lithophilic (chub). Both species generally occupied distinct microhabitats, although resource- use overlap was significant in summer. During this season, overlap was found between yoy nase and chub, juvenile nase and juvenile/adult chub, and between adults of both species. The present study identified key factors in the species habitat requirements and helped develop management recommendations for river restoration that may have a wider application, particularly for other Mediterraneantype river...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The Segura River, {{located in}} southeastern Spain, {{is one of}} the most {{regulated}} rivers in Europe, creating severe environmental problems and breaking connectivity. The LIFE + SEGURA RIVERLINK project, cofinanced by the LIFE Program, aims to promote and support the environmental recovery of the Segura River Basin by improving and strengthening the connectivity between natural ecosystems, promoting the conservation of an area with an exceptional environmental value and improving its public use. The main actions include the removal of an unused weir and the construction of eight fish passages, being this a pilot experience in the Segura River Basin and a still uncommon practice in Mediterranean areas. To support these actions, ecological restorations will be implemented in each demonstration site. The target specie of the project is the Luciobarbus sclateri (Southern Iberian barbel), Iberian endemism and the only autochthonous specie in the project. The rest of sentinel species are Pseudochondrostoma polylepis (<b>Iberian</b> <b>nase),</b> Gobio lozanoi (Pyrenean gudgeon) and Alburnus alburnus (Bleak). Monitoring activities will assess the performance of these actions with the hope of validating the Green Infrastructure approach in river basin management and its possible extension to the official River Basin Management Plan of the Segura River Basin. The project also includes the creation of a Land Stewardship Network that seeks to involve different stakeholders in the river management as well as an Environmental Educational Program and a Volunteering Program to promote environmental awareness in society. This project will protect local aquatic and riverine habitats, allow fish migration along an important sector of the Segura River, improve ecosystem services, build a cadre of scientific and social knowledge to improve river management quality and help local and regional governments to comply with EU Water Framework Directive and facilitate the implementation and enforcement of EU policy and legislation on biodiversity conservation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Different {{types of}} fishways have been {{implemented}} worldwide to mitigate the impact of dams on diadromous and potamodromous fish species. Among these, fish lifts stand as the most cost-effective mitigation measures for high dams. The present study examines fish passage through the Touvedo fish lift (River Lima, northwest Portugal) along a 2. 5 year period with the goal of: i) evaluating the conditions in terms of seasonal/daily fish movements patterns and to preliminary assess the overall efficacy of the facility (pre-treatment period, 1 year); ii) implementing specific measures to improve the efficacy previously recorded (6 months) and iii) evaluating the present conditions of the facility after measure implementation (post-treatment period, 1 year). Monitoring was continuously performed by {{using a combination of}} monthly video-recording and downstream electrofishing. A total of 3389 fish were transferred by the lift during the pre-treatment period, of which 89. 7 % corresponded to <b>Iberian</b> <b>nase</b> (54. 1 %) and European eel (35. 6 %), which migrated mainly during summer and beginning of autumn, independently from time of day. Mean overall efficacy was higher for potamodromous cyprinid species (0. 42 - 0. 44) and lower for the eel (0. 10). Differences between fish size, downstream and in the fish lift, were also noted. After implementing a set of specific measures, the post-monitoring annual period revealed a significant increase of eel abundance, which increased more than threefold (1207 to 3852 individuals), though the timing of movements remained similar as of the pre-treatment period. An overall increase in fish lift efficacy was also noted for eel (0. 21) and potamodromous cyprinids (0. 44 - 1. 35). Differences in fish size also decreased. The current work revealed that the use of the Touvedo fish lift by eels and medium-sized cyprinid species can be improved by reducing the gap between retention bars in the fish lift and by improving the attraction flow at the fish entrances...|$|E
