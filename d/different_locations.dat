5|$|Attempts at {{crossing}} species, whether from different sections or {{within the same}} section, of Erythranthe are not always successful. E. peregrina {{is an example of}} a successful naturally occurring hybrid that not only arose independently in two <b>different</b> <b>locations,</b> but is also a rare example of evolutionary recent allopolyploidization, complete chromosomal inheritance.|$|E

5|$|Blood Money is a side-scrolling shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} by DMA Design. It {{was published by}} Psygnosis in 1989 for the Amiga, Atari ST and MS-DOS, and in 1990 for the Commodore 64. The game is set in four <b>different</b> <b>locations</b> on a planet, where players are tasked with attacking the enemies and defeating the bosses.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy IX {{offers a}} new {{approach}} to town exploration with the introduction of Active Time Events (ATE). These allow the player to view events unfolding at <b>different</b> <b>locations,</b> providing character development, special items and prompts for key story-altering decisions. ATE are occasionally used to simultaneously control two teams when the party is divided to solve puzzles and navigate mazes.|$|E
5|$|Following the incident, the {{government}} offered dialogue with opposition and ordered army {{to withdraw from}} Pearl Roundabout. On 19 February, army troops were replaced by riot police. Hundreds of protesters moved to the site from <b>different</b> <b>locations.</b> A standoff between protesters and riot police was created, until the latter suddenly moved away. Thousands of protesters re-occupied the site following police withdrawal.|$|E

5|$|In 1966, Vandersteen finally {{moved back}} from Brussels, {{where he had}} lived at <b>different</b> <b>locations</b> since World War II, towards Antwerp, and more {{precisely}} Kalmthout, a rural village {{to the north of}} Antwerp. There, next to his villa, he created the location for his main Studio.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the tracks}} in Wipeout 64 feature {{mirrored}} layouts of circuits from select tracks in Wipeout and Wipeout 2097, set in <b>different</b> <b>locations.</b> Some conversions are not perfectly accurate, as some corners were eased or cut entirely, elevations were changed, {{and there were no}} split track sections.|$|E
5|$|Tafforet was {{familiar}} with the fauna of Réunion, where the related hoopoe starling lived. He made several comparisons between the faunas of <b>different</b> <b>locations,</b> so {{the fact that he did}} not mention a crest on the Rodrigues starling indicates that it was absent. His description of their colouration is similar.|$|E

5|$|Then in 1968, despite {{academic}} protests worldwide, Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev {{ordered the}} destruction of Königsberg Castle, thus making any onsite research of the last known resting place of the Amber Room all but impossible.

5|$|To assess {{prospective}} {{wind power}} sites a {{probability distribution function}} is often fit to the observed wind speed data. <b>Different</b> <b>locations</b> will have different wind speed distributions. The Weibull model closely mirrors the actual distribution of hourly/ten-minute wind speeds at many locations. The Weibull factor is often close to 2 and therefore a Rayleigh distribution {{can be used as}} a less accurate, but simpler model.|$|E

5|$|A {{conservative}} {{force that}} acts on a closed system has an associated mechanical work that allows energy to convert only between kinetic or potential forms. This means {{that for a}} closed system, the net mechanical energy is conserved whenever a conservative force acts on the system. The force, therefore, is related directly to the difference in potential energy between two <b>different</b> <b>locations</b> in space, and can {{be considered to be}} an artifact of the potential field {{in the same way that}} the direction and amount of a flow of water can be considered to be an artifact of the contour map of the elevation of an area.|$|E
5|$|After {{the pilot}} docks with {{a space station}} or lands on a planet, the screen and its {{interface}} change to a rendition of the area he is visiting. The player moves the pilot to <b>different</b> <b>locations</b> and interacts with certain objects, such as reading a bulletin board and talking to other characters, by clicking on their graphical representations. Freelancers economy consists of buying and selling spacecraft, their armaments and components, and commodities. Certain goods are considered contraband in some systems, {{and they have to}} be smuggled past police patrols to their buyers. Computer-controlled characters (non-player characters or NPCs) in certain locations on the planets or stations offer quests and jobs.|$|E
5|$|CR106 {{proceeds}} {{east from}} here providing a border between Harriman State Park (to the west) and Bear Mountain State Park (to the east). It then intersects Lake Welch Parkway, a seasonal road {{which provides a}} route to Lake Welch Beach on the northern side of the lake. Then, CR106 splits Lake Welch in two <b>different</b> <b>locations</b> on the southern side of the lake. CR106 then begins its trek out of Harriman State Park and into the town of Stony Point.|$|E

5|$|Even though Vrbanac {{ordered a}} halt to the {{operation}} shortly after midnight on 18/19 September, the Bjelovar Corps failed to cancel new crossing attempts it had ordered for 6:00 the following morning. The attacks went ahead, albeit at 10:30, with the 52nd and the 125th Home Guard regiments' battlegroups trying to cross the Sava River at <b>different</b> <b>locations.</b> Despite strengthening river currents and continued VRS artillery fire, small reconnaissance elements managed to cross the river, only to be forced back an hour later.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{diagnosis}} in HHT is difficult, as mutations {{occur in}} numerous <b>different</b> <b>locations</b> in the linked genes, without particular mutations being highly frequent (as opposed to, for instance, the ΔF508 mutation in cystic fibrosis). Sequence {{analysis of the}} involved genes is therefore the most useful approach (sensitivity 75%), followed by additional testing to detect large deletions and duplications (additional 10%). Not all mutations in these genes have been linked with disease.|$|E
5|$|In December 2015, {{to commemorate}} the home media release of Ant-Man, Marvel UK {{launched}} a website that offers visitors a view of various London landmarks {{from the perspective of}} an ant in a Google Street View-type experience.
