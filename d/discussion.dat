Additionally, I track back <b>discussions</b> in the seventeenth century, as a germ of <b>discussions</b> in eighteenth- century England, in the area of animal experiments, such as vivisection. Lastly, I speculate why these <b>discussions</b> in the seventeenth century spread out explosively in the following centuries in England...|$|R

40|$|While {{there is}} {{agreement}} {{that participation in}} online asynchronous <b>discussions</b> can enhance student learning, {{it has also been}} identified {{that there is a need}} to study the impact of participation in online asynchronous <b>discussions</b> compared to traditional <b>discussions</b> on student course content knowledge. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of using asynchronous <b>discussions</b> in an online course compared to traditional classroom face-to-face <b>discussions.</b> There were 44 participants in the study who were enrolled in an undergraduate course for elementary and secondary education majors related to teaching children with disabilities in the regular classroom. Twenty-two participants were enrolled in the online section of the course that accessed the course through home computers. Twenty-two participants were enrolled in the traditional section of the course that met in a classroom at the university. The instructional program for both groups included the same required textbook, syllabus, and activities. Qualitative data were collected through transcribed course <b>discussions</b> and printed threaded <b>discussions</b> to measure the quality of <b>discussions</b> related to course content. Several similar themes emerged for both groups of students indicating that both groups had similar <b>discussions</b> related to the course content. The results of this study have direct implications for using asynchronous <b>discussions</b> in an online learning environment...|$|R

40|$|A {{teaching}} {{experiment in}} Finland {{was designed to}} clarify ways to teach argumentation in Finnish higher education and how to motivate {{students to participate in}} critical content-area <b>discussions.</b> Finnish students traditionally hesitate to criticize each other's opinions or those of the teacher.

The <b>discussions</b> in the e-mail groups were textual and were not real-time in nature. Free debate and role play were used in organizing both types of <b>discussions.</b> Comparing the two approaches showed that the e-mail <b>discussions</b> included more grounded disagreements, more elaborative agreements, and more elaborative neutrality than the face-to-face <b>discussions.</b> These findings illustrate the usefulness of e-mail whe...|$|R
