40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the motives, methods and successes {{of opposition to}} C. Julius Caesar in the period 60 - 50 leading to the outbreak of civil war in 49. An attempt {{has been made to}} distinguish between traditional and innovative methods of opposition. An evaluation of creativity levels and the social acceptability of actions has been conducted in an effort to understand adherence to moral standards in the pre-war period. In Chapter 2, opposition to Caesar in 60 and 59 is examined and found to be fierce, persistent and, despite Caesar ultimately achieving his aims, successful in a limited way. Chapter 3 {{examines the}} circumstances of 58 - 57. Caesar’s position was more firmly secured through the agency of Clodius’ tribunate, during which Cicero was exiled and Cato was removed from the political scene for both political and personal reasons. <b>Examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>opposition</b> to Caesar in Chapter 4 focuses on the period 56 - 54. It is demonstrated that prior to the conferences of Luca and Ravenna, opposition to Caesar was broadly undertaken by groups or individuals who fomented dissent between Crassus and Pompey in order to undermine the triumvirate as a whole. In 55 opposition to Caesar was nullified by a renewal of the triumvirate. In 54 opposition was resurgent and dominated the courts with limited success. In Chapter 5, opposition to Caesar in the period 53 - 50 is examined and is shown to be marked by anarchy, attempted reforms and the disintegration of the triumviral alliance. Given widespread impressions of pressure, corruption, violence and breakdown, especially in modern accounts of the period, it is suprising to discover that tactics used by Caesar’s opponents were traditional and socially acceptable for the most part, despite vehement political and personal disagreement. The will of the people was still respected by Caesar’s opponents; popular opinion in 59 was in fact the cause of opposition failure. While the Republic had suffered civil war in the opening decades of the first century BC, the state had resumed constitutional operation prior to 60. Traditional moral values and methods of gaining rank and prestige were still important and continued to be adhered to after 60. Methods of influence and social communication remained largely unchanged in the 50 s, and ensured the continuity of political exchange without substantial innovation. From 56 to 54 opposition methods were opportunistic, a result of the renewal of the triumvirate. Caesar’s opponents continued to adhere to traditional political practice, despite dominance of the political machinary by the triumvirate. In 54 Caesar’s opponents gained control of the law courts, which resulted in numerous trials but no break with traditional or socially acceptable behaviour. Opposition between 53 and 50 remained traditional in most cases within an environment marked by anarchy and political stalemate, fueled by the intransigence of Caesar and Pompey who refused to recognise each others’ dignitas. The Civil War, then, was not caused by an extended period of constitutional instability. The Civil War was the result of political deadlock {{at the end of the}} 50 s, motivated by the social and political inflexibility of a small group of Senators...|$|E

25|$|An {{opposition}} {{can only}} {{be based on a}} limited number of grounds, i.e. {{on the grounds that the}} subject-matter of the patent is not patentable, that the invention is insufficiently disclosed, or that the content of the patent extends beyond the content of the application as filed. The notice <b>of</b> <b>opposition</b> to a European patent must be filed in writing at the EPO (either at Munich, The Hague or Berlin), along with the payment <b>of</b> an <b>opposition</b> fee, within nine months from the publication of the mention of the grant of the patent in the European Patent Bulletin. <b>Opposition</b> Divisions <b>of</b> the EPO are responsible for the <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>oppositions.</b> The opposition procedure may involve multiple opponents.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} the first {{detailed study of}} the jury of the Paris Fine Art Salon under the July Monarchy and Second Republic. In 1831, Louis-Philippe delegated the role of jury {{to the members of}} the first four sections of the Académie des Beaux-Arts. This thesis analyses the diverse composition of the July Monarchy jury and offers the first account of its procedures and decisions based on a rigorous <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> archival sources. It also examines the nature and extent <b>of</b> the growing <b>opposition</b> to the jury, its eventual abolition in 1848 and the decisions taken in forming a new jury under the Second Republic. In so doing it reveals the failure of the king and his arts administration to respond to the aspirations and expectations of the artistic community under the post-revolution constitutional monarchy. It also shows how the jury’s diverse membership sparked conflict, notably between a conservative group of architects and certain more open-minded members of the painting section, as it sought to adjust its academic values and expectations in response to the artistic developments of the period. My <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>opposition</b> to the jury among artists and art journalists during this period brings to light the key issues surrounding admission to the Salon at the time. Finally, the analysis of the Second Republic reveals the ways in which this opposition was temporarily satisfied by reforms to the jury, examining the significance of changes not only to its composition, but also to its procedures. At each stage the thesis challenges the simplistic misrepresentations of the Salon jury’s procedures and decisions prevalent during the July Monarchy itself and subsequently in the history of the emergence of modern art in France during the nineteenth century...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{an account}} of human understanding {{on the basis of}} an analysis of German philosopher Martin Heidegger’s Being and Time, and in relation to the thought of the Kyoto School philosopher Watsuji Tetsuro. The aim is to describe shared human intelligibility as founded upon a historical tradition and maintained by concrete practices, and yet as expressed only by interpretive projections, and therefore always open to revision. An analysis of the significance of anxiety and authenticity in Being and Time, as aspects of the existential interpretive process of our lives, is accompanied by a philosophical description of everyday acts, which finds that the world is interpreted in relation to the others with whom the world is co-inhabited. This social relatedness between, on one hand, authentic, ‘individualized’ interpretation, and on the other hand, the everyday basis of intelligibility, is shown to support a potentially radical philosophy of social transformation. The first half of the text discusses the central significance of interpretation for Heidegger’s phenomenology, and argues for a reading of authenticity as a contextual, practical and individualized project. The second half develops {{an account of}} social existence in reference to Watsuji’s phenomenological ethics, and concludes with an <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> social <b>opposition</b> movements and the revision of the ground of intelligibility provided by a tradition and expressed in social practices...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the changing nature}} <b>of</b> <b>opposition</b> within the British political system through {{a study of the}} balance of power between the Conservative Party and its leader in their most recent period in opposition from 1997 to 2010. A literature on the place <b>of</b> the <b>opposition</b> within the British political system was developed as part of post- 1945 studies of the Westminster Model. However, despite dramatic changes in the political environment and the increasing rejection of the Westminster Model, more recent discussion has neglected systematic study <b>of</b> <b>opposition.</b> More recent writing on the Conservative Party has not been used to examine claims about the changing form and function <b>of</b> <b>opposition,</b> but has assumed the importance of the decisions of particular actors. In order to study the recent Conservative Party with a view to developing our understanding <b>of</b> <b>opposition</b> and the expectations upon its leader, the thesis identifies the change in the political environment as central. It suggests dealing with this by utilizing a conceptual framework derived from Presidentialisation theory. This offers a conceptualisation of the political system as a whole, identifying the increasing importance of leadership at its heart. Adapting this to the study <b>of</b> <b>opposition</b> suggests <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> three crucial components of leadership activity: the relationship between the party and the leader, the place of the leader within general elections and the place of the leader and opposition within the wider political environment including executive actions. <b>Examination</b> <b>of</b> these areas highlights the substantial ways in which power has moved from the leader to the party alongside the additional resources which the leader can command. It concludes that whilst the changing political environment may have served to make the leader <b>of</b> the <b>opposition</b> appear more powerful and prominent, there are significant structural constraints which prevent the exercise of this power.

40|$|PhDThis {{thesis is}} an <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>opposition</b> to the {{redevelopment}} of a {{fruit and vegetable}} wholesale market in Spitalfields, east London. I argue that such opposition has not received the attention it deserves {{in the literature on}} urban redevelopment. The thesis examines the origins and establishment of the Campaign to Save Spitalfields from the Developers, and examines its discourse in order to ascertain where the roots <b>of</b> the Campaign's <b>opposition</b> lay. After outlining the methodology used in the research, the history of the market is examined {{within the context of the}} Spitalfields area. Previous plans for redevelopment are discussed and attention then focusses on plans put forward in 1986. The role of the City of London Corporation, the government and the Spitalfields Development Group are explored and stress is laid on the ways in which these three institutions portrayed redevelopment as a mechanism for inner city renewal, for the benefit of all interested parties. The Campaign to Save Spitalfields from the Developers is then studied, looking at its make-up and its arguments over the impact of redevelopment on Spitalfields. Its origins within the local Labour Party and the local voluntary sector are traced and the influence of these bodies on the Campaign in terms of its arguments and ideas on redevelopment are illustrated. The ways in which the Campaign represented redevelopment in the area are then discussed. The portrayal of Spitalfields as a multicultural community area and immigrant area are discussed, and the images the Campaign constructed of the City of London and of the likely face of Spitalfields examined. I argue that these representations are important in elucidating a reason for the Campaign's opposition. I then examine these representations of Spitalfields in the light of the Campaign's claims to representativeness. I examine the ways in which the Campaign dealt with the emergence of another group in the area, and indicate what I understand to be the sources of the Campaign's discomfort with this group. I conclude by arguing for further study <b>of</b> <b>opposition</b> movements that emerge to protest against urban redevelopment, and by arguing for an intensive qualitative research methodology...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} explore {{textually}} instantiated oppositions and {{their contribution to}} the construction of ‘us’ and ‘them’ in specific news texts. The data consists of reports of two major protest marches taken from news articles in UK national daily newspapers. The aim of the thesis is to review and {{contribute to the development of}} existing theories <b>of</b> <b>oppositions</b> (often known as ‘antonyms’), in order to investigate the potential effects of their systematic usage in news texts and add an additional method of analysis to the linguistic toolkit utilised by critical discourse analysts. The thesis reviews a number of traditional theories <b>of</b> <b>opposition</b> and questions the assumption that oppositions are mainly lexical phenomena i. e. that only those codified in lexical authorities such as thesauruses can be classed as true opposites. The hypothesis draws on Murphy (2003) to argue that opposition is primarily conceptual, evidence being that new ones can be derived from principles on which opposition is based. The dialectic between ‘canonical’ and ‘noncanonical’ oppositions allows addressees to process and understand a potentially infinite number <b>of</b> new <b>oppositions</b> via cognitive reference to existing ones. Fundamental to the discovery <b>of</b> co-occurring textually-constructed <b>oppositions</b> are the syntactic frames commonly used to house canonical oppositions, which, this thesis argues, can trigger new instances <b>of</b> <b>oppositions</b> when used in these frames. I conduct a detailed qualitative analysis <b>of</b> textually constructed <b>oppositions</b> in three news articles, and show how they are used by journalists to positively and negatively represent groups and individuals as mutually exclusive binaries, in order to perpetuate a particular ideological point of view. The final section is an <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> how critical discourse analysis studies in{{to the construction of}} ‘us’ and ‘them’ in news texts can be enhanced by a consideration <b>of</b> constructed <b>oppositions</b> like those explored in the thesis...|$|R

To test the utility of this analysis, Fitzpatrick provides an extended application to traditional scholarship {{about the nature of}} law and its relation to society.

50|$|In the 19th century, George Boole {{argued for}} {{requiring}} existential import on both terms in particular claims (I and O), but allowing all terms of universal claims (A and E) to lack existential import. This decision made Venn diagrams particularly {{easy to use}} for term logic. The square <b>of</b> <b>opposition,</b> under this Boolean set of assumptions, is often called the modern Square <b>of</b> <b>opposition.</b> In the modern square <b>of</b> <b>opposition,</b> A and O claims are contradictories, as are E and I, but all other forms <b>of</b> <b>opposition</b> cease to hold; there are no contraries, subcontraries, or subalterns.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} way in which {{different}} verbal and nominal structures 'fit together' within a coherent system in Plateau Shimakonde, a sub-dialect of the Makonde language spoken in northern Mozambique. A central proposition of our study is that word formation in the verbal and nominal systems is hierarchical. In the verbal system, we propose that there are just four basic structures in a core tense-aspect matrix which distinguishes between perfective and imperfective aspect and between projected and non-projected time. These verbal structures then provide the basis from which negative, conjoint and relative verbs are derived, or 'built'. In the nominal system, we propose that simple nouns consist of a neutral noun prefix added to a simple stem. Different kinds of complex nouns are then built from these basic forms. These include locative nouns, agentive nouns, identifying nouns of various sorts, quality nouns, associative nouns, personified animal names and feature nouns. We also identify a range of other compound or 'marked' structures which employ 'non-neutral' affixes. These include Infinitives, deverbal abstracts, manner nouns and relational terms. The study also describes the phonological units and processes which determine {{the way in}} which underlying tones surface in Plateau Shimakonde. This description includes a survey of vowel and consonantal processes, an <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> the phonological <b>opposition</b> between High and Low tones, an analysis of the tone-bearing quality of nasals in different contexts and a description of various phenomena found at the boundaries of phonological phrases.

40|$|Abstract. It {{has been}} {{pointed out that there}} is no {{primitive}} name in natural and formal languages for one corner of the famous square <b>of</b> <b>oppositions.</b> We have all, some and no, but no primitive name for not all. It is true also in the modal version of the square, we have necessary, possible and impossible, but no primitive name for not necessary. I shed here a new light on this mysterious non-lexicalisation of the south-east corner of the square <b>of</b> <b>oppositions,</b> the so-called O-corner, by establishing some connections between negations and modalities. The E-corner, impossible, is a paracomplete negation (intuitionistic negation if the underlying modal logic is S 4) and the O-corner, not necessary, is a paraconsistent negation. I argue that the three notions <b>of</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>of</b> the square <b>of</b> <b>oppositions</b> (contradiction, contrariety, subcontrariety) correspond to three notions of negation (classical, paracomplete, paraconsistent). We get a better understanding of these relations <b>of</b> <b>opposition</b> in the perspective of Blanché’s hexagon and furthermore in the perspective of a three dimensional object, a stellar dodecahedron <b>of</b> <b>oppositions</b> that I present {{at the end of the}} paper. 1. The non lexicalization of the O-corner of the Square <b>of</b> <b>Oppositions</b> The famous Square <b>of</b> <b>Oppositions</b> 1 <b>of</b> Boethius and Apuleius with the four corners A E I O is built using the three Aristotelian notions of opposition: contradiction, contrariety and subcontrariety. Contradiction is expressed in red, contrariety in blue, subcontrariety in green and subalternation 2 in black. 1 Most of the time people use the singular, i. e. the expression “Square of Opposition”. But I think it is important to emphasize the plurality <b>of</b> <b>oppositions,</b> that is why I will use the plural, as in French: “Le Carré des Oppositions”. 2 I represent subalternation, but I don’t consider this relation as a relation of oppo-sition, this topic will be discussed in section 3...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{approaches}} to contemporary Euroscepticism have explained {{it in terms}} of the politics <b>of</b> <b>opposition</b> and peripherality characteristic of competitive party systems. Euroscepticism becomes a central strategy by which non-mainstream parties or factions within mainstream parties attempt to gain political advantage. In the British case, there has been a focus on the influence Eurosceptic factionalism can have within a first-past-the-post parliamentary system. This article challenges explanations of British Euroscepticism in terms of the politics <b>of</b> <b>opposition</b> and the workings of the party system. Instead, it is proposed that a structural crisis of British party politics has allowed Euroscepticism to enter the political mainstream. The author conceives of Euroscepticism as a distinct and powerful national movement asserting conceptions of Britain's exceptional national identity. This is viewed as part of a post-imperial crisis that shifts parties, and factions within parties, towards populist forms of legitimation that have weakened possibilities for stable and coherent political leadership over European integration. Consequently, mainstream parties have struggled to protect themselves against the ideological influence of this populist Euroscepticism. This is particularly evident during periods of Eurosceptic mobilization, and is demonstrated in this article through the <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> the extensive role played by right-wing Eurosceptic forces during the attempt by the Major Government to ratify the Maastricht Treaty...|$|R
