30|$|Inequalities {{provide a}} way to study topological indices {{relative}}ly. There are two major classes of topological indices: degree-based and distance-based indices.

3000|$|A {{chemical}} molecule can {{be viewed}} as a graph. In a molecular graph, the vertices represent the atoms of the molecule and the edges are chemical bonds. A topological index of a molecular graph is a mathematical parameter which is used for studying various properties of this molecule. The distance-based topological <b>indices,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the Wiener <b>index</b> [2, 3] and the Balaban index [4], have been extensively researched for many decades. Meanwhile the spectrum-based <b>indices</b> developed rapidly, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the Estrada <b>index</b> [5], the Kirchhoff index [6] and matching energy [7]. The eccentricity-based topological <b>indices,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the eccentric distance sum [8], the connective eccentricity index [9] and the adjacent eccentric distance sum [10], were proposed and studied recently. The degree-based topological <b>indices,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the Randić <b>index</b> [11 – 13], the general sum-connectivity index [14, 15], the Zagreb indices [16], the multiplicative Zagreb indices [17, 18] and the augmented Zagreb index [19], where the Zagreb indices include the first Zagreb index [...]...|$|R

Other carbohydrates, especially cooked starches, e.g. crisps/potato chips, may also damage teeth, although {{to a lesser degree}} (and indirectly) since starch has to be converted to glucose by salivary amylase (an enzyme in the saliva) first. Sugars that are higher in the stickiness <b>index,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> toffee, are likely to cause more damage to teeth than those that are lower in the stickiness <b>index,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> certain forms of chocolate or most fruits.|$|R

Other choices may be an international <b>index</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the MSCI EAFE. The benchmark is often chosen {{to be similar to}} the assets chosen by the investor. For example, for a person who owns S&P 500 index funds and gold bars, the index would combine the S&P 500 and the price of gold. In practice a standard index is used.|$|R
