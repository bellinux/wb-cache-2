50|$|In February 2014, the Fibrebond Corporation, which builds {{concrete}} shelters, {{announced a}} $2.5 million capital expansion project which will revive an <b>inactive</b> <b>container</b> mill {{adjacent to the}} company's existing manufacturing site in Minden. The expansion will create 225 jobs, which will pay $3,000 gross per month. Some twenty-five additional jobs will also become available temporarily for the pending construction work at the site.|$|E

Also, a direct analytical approach for calculating the full-energy peak efficiency has been derived. The examination of the present results as given in the figures reflects the importance of considering the self-attenuation factor in studying the efficiency of any detector using parallelepiped sources.|$|R
30|$|In a large extent, we {{introduced}} a new analytical approach for the calculation of full-energy peak efficiency of the coaxial detector with respect to point and volumetric sources (cylindrical and spherical) [19, 20, 21]. In the present work, we deal with parallelepiped source. The basic idea {{of this approach is}} the separate calculation of the intrinsic and the geometrical efficiencies, and the factors which related to the photon attenuation in the detector end cap, <b>inactive</b> layer, source <b>container,</b> and the self-attenuation of the source matrix. The calculations depend on two main factors. First is the accurate analytical calculation of the average path length covered by the photon in each of the following: the detector active volume, the source matrix, the source <b>container,</b> the <b>inactive</b> layer, and the end cap of the detector. Second is the geometrical solid angle Ω.|$|R
40|$|The {{intent is}} to confront waste on both a global and local level using {{architecture}} to engage and educate the public. Global waste, in this case, is defined as intermodal containers and local waste is defined as municipally collected solid waste. I intend to show through my designs that architecture need not {{be the source of}} yet more energy use and material waste. Instead, design can be the vehicle through which we begin to lessen our impact on Planet Earth by reusing the materials already at hand to create architecture and energy. A waste to energy approach [both architectural and functional] provides a closed loop system in which waste can be reused {{in a way that is}} both locally beneficial and ecologically responsible. By creating a Waste-to-Energy Power Plant using recycled building materials the public can begin to understand and manage waste in ways that enhance their own everyday life. The proposed facility located at the Bluffs Road Landfill in Lincoln, NE will actually invite the public to be a part of the disposal/generation process by allowing people to bring their waste, literally ‘throw it on the pile’ and then witness the step by step process of their waste being converted into electricity. The intermodal containers are an added layer of education; what was once industrial waste will be used to create the architectural experience. Architecturally, intermodal containers embody a potential “energy” that is easily transferable to a kinetic “energy” by taking the <b>containers</b> from their <b>inactive</b> positions in <b>container</b> yards and giving them purpose through human use and programmatic function. Likewise, solid waste can easily be changed from a potential to a kinetic energy through the process of burning its combustible elements to generate clean electricity. These layers of engaging and education will begin to teach people about waste and its effects on the landscape, environment, economy, etc. This idea of reuse is key to engaging and enlightening the public. It invites people to reformulate their preconceptions about unwanted materials and view those materials as purposeful instead of useless. Traditional recycling may be a part of the solution, but it cannot be the answer alone. In order to overcome the indoctrinated practice of disposal without consequence, reuse and repurposement need to be brought to the forefront of people’s minds, in this case through architecture and the function it provides...|$|R
