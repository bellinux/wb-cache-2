40|$|Abstract — Reflective {{cracking}} {{has been}} a major issue in pavement rehabilitation for many decades, due in part to shrinkage, constant expansion and contraction of pavement. These cracks result in uncomfortable rides and further deteriorate highways and local streets. Because of these problems, the application of paving fabrics systems to reduce reflective cracking is being investigated. If applied correctly, these paving fabrics should control moisture protruding to the base, provide tensile reinforcement, and prevent or reduce the propagation of cracks to the new overlay. The performance of paving fabrics is related to several factors including proper installation procedure. To assure the performance record for paving fabrics, the <b>installation</b> <b>specification,</b> and guidelines must be strictly enforced and proper installation and equipment is critical for optimum performance. This paper presents the results of the construction monitoring of the twelve paving fabric research sections. Lessons learned and suggestions for installation improvements are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Many modern {{applications}} are built by combining independently developed packages {{and services that}} are distributed over many machines with complex inter-dependencies. The assembly, installation, and management of such applications is hard, and usually performed either manually or by writing customized scripts. We present Engage, a system for configuring, installing, and managing complex application stacks. Engage consists of three components: a domain-specific model to describe component metadata and intercomponent dependencies; a constraint-based algorithm that takes a partial <b>installation</b> <b>specification</b> and computes a full installation plan; and a runtime system that co-ordinates the deployment of the application across multiple machines and manages the deployed system. By explicitly modeling configuration metadata and intercomponent dependencies, Engage enables static checking of application configurations and automated, constraint-driven, generation of installation plans across multiple machines. This reduces the tedious manual process of application configuration, installation, and management. We have implemented Engage and we have used it to successfully host a number of applications. We describe our experiences in using Engage to manage a generic platform that hosts Django applications in the cloud or on premises...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of liquid chromatography coupled with isotope ratio mass spectrometry (LC/IRMS) as an analytical {{tool for the}} measurement of isotope ratios in non-volatile analytes has somewhat simplified the analytical cycle from sample collection to analysis mainly due to the avoidance of the extensive sample processing and derivatisation that were necessary for gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC/C/IRMS). Here we test the performance of coupling strong anion exchange to IRMS using only the second commercially available interface; the Liquiface. The system was modified from <b>installation</b> <b>specification</b> to improve peak resolution in the interface and maintain peak separation from the column to the mass spectrometer. The system performance was assessed by the determination of sensitivity, accuracy and precision attained from carbohydrate separations. The system performed satisfactorily after modifications, resulting in maintenance of peak resolution from column to mass spectrometer. The sensitivity achieved suggested that &# 8764; 150 ng carbon could be analysed with acceptable precision (&# 60; 0. 3 &# 8240;). Accuracy was maintained in the interface as determined by correlation with offline techniques, resulting in regression coefficient of r 2 = 0. 98 and a slope of 0. 99. The average precision achieved for the separation of seven monosaccharides was 0. 36 &# 8240;. The integration of a carbonate removal device limited the effect of background carbon perturbations in the mass spectrometer associated with eluent gradients, and the coupling of strong anion-exchange chromatography with IRMS was successfully achieved using the Liquiface...|$|E

40|$|AbstractMost {{contributions}} on {{the issues}} of sustainability of rural electrification projects have focused on the technology and business models used to drive the projects. The issues of user education and environmental impact on the technology have received little attention. This has resulted in short lives of many rural electrification projects after commissioning. The usage pattern of solar home system (SHS) by most users that placed their solar panels close to obstructing objects, which results in shading of the panels, and location of households in the concession areas of South African SHS program is affecting the performances of SHS. The non-optimal use of SHS is as a result of lack of user education. Therefore this paper reports on the impact of location and shading of panels on the economics and technical performance of SHS. The study is achieved by investigating the performances of a 75 WP solar panel operated from two sites in South Africa (Upington in Northern Cape Province and Thlatlaganya in Limpopo Province), the performances of an optimized shaded SHS and a non-shaded one is also investigated. The results shows that both activities compromises the performance of the systems, the energy output of a solar panel located at Upington is increased by 10 % and the state of charge of the battery (SOC) increased by 7 %, compared to the panel situated at Thlatlaganya village. Also the life span of the battery is increased by about one year. The SOC of the partially shaded SHS is reduced by 22 % and loss of power to the load increased by 20 %. The geographical location of the SHS concession areas in South Africa and lack of adherence to the manufacturer's <b>installation</b> <b>specification</b> affects the economics of SHS and the energy output vis-à-vis the sustainability of the program due to reduction in life cycle of the batteries...|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} a literature review of instrumentation practices for {{the measurement of}} stresses, strains, and deflections in pavement structures. Various types of instruments that are commonly employed in pavement instrumentation projects are discussed, {{as well as the}} factors that influence their performance. In a series of laboratory experiments, the performance of three different types of embedment strain gages, two LVDTs, and one soil stress cell are investigated. These experiments are designed to evaluate the accuracy and durability of commercially available transducers. For strain gages, the selection of an appropriate transducer must balance compliance and measurement sensitivity. All of the strain gages tested in concrete gave reasonable results. It was found that hermetically sealed LVDTs should be sufficient enough for robust installations. Experiments with soil stress cells embedded in sand indicate the variability that may be expected in the field due to installation procedures, and emphasize the need for in-soil calibrations.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the role of}} the Blend Down Monitoring System Fissile Mass Flow Monitor (FMFM) systems implemented at the Ural Electrochemical Integrated Enterprise at Novouralsk (February 1999), the Electrochemical Plant at Zelenogorsk (March 2003), and the Siberian Chemical Enterprise at Seversk (October 2004) highly enriched uranium (HEU) down blending facilities in Russia for the U. S. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration HEU Transparency Program (TP). The 1993 HEU Purchase Agreement between the United States and the Russian Federation (RF) requires the down blending of HEU from dismantled RF nuclear weapons for use as nuclear fuel. The FMFM is designed to measure 235 U fissile mass flow in the UF 6 process pipes in these RF facilities. The FMFM also traces the HEU flow through the HEU blending tee into the resulting down blended product flow, thus confirming down-blending of the HEU. The paper covers details of the FMFM’s operational characteristics and technical <b>installation</b> <b>specifications,</b> which are optimized for the facility process characteristics so that the measurement performance required for the TP objectives and goals is achieved.

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} make {{improvements}} to conventional paving asphalt {{to make it more}} suitable for containment applications, Wilder Construction Co. of Everett, WA offers MatCon, a polymer modified asphalt system comprised of proprietary binder, when coupled with a selected aggregate type and gradation, a specialized job mix formula and <b>installation</b> <b>specifications</b> results in a potentially superior substitution for conventional paving asphalt in cover containment applications. Under US EPA’s Superfund Innovative Technology Evaluation (SITE) program, the system was installed and placed under study at two locations, with two more possible in 2001. MatCon is intended for use as a waste containment material, and can be configured to function as both a hydraulic barrier and as a drainage material, to comprise a single or multiple layer cover system. MatCon is noted for its superior engineering qualities and is designed for long-term performance, yet can be applied with conventional paving equipment. The hydraulic performance of the material was examined by both removing destructive samples for laboratory testing, as well as field evaluation. While the study focuses on hydraulic properties, accompanying engineering properties were evaluated in the laboratory. Finished MatCon can serve multiple purposes such as staging for trucks and construction equipment, pavement, and light industrial facilities.

40|$|Current {{regulations}} for {{fire suppression systems}} in underground coal mines to protect conveyor belt installations {{have been in place}} since the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 was enacted. Over time, the coal conveyer equipment being used and ventilation conditions underground have changed significantly, particularly the width of the conveyor belts and the use of belt air at the face. The effect of these new conditions on the effectiveness of suppression systems during a fire is not known. The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducted a study to evaluate the effect of air velocity, water sprinkler activation temperature, and a limited water application time on the effectiveness of water sprinkler fire suppression systems to extinguish large-scale conveyor belt fires. The fire tests were conducted using both new and used 1. 8 -m-wide, fire-resistant rubber belt that met the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) flame resistant requirement specified in Title 30, Code of Federal Regulations, part 18, section 18. 65 (also known as the 2 G test). Tests were conducted using standard response sprinklers with activation temperatures of 68 20 C and 141 20 C at air velocities of 0. 5 and 5. 1 m/s. Two tests were conducted at both air velocities for each sprinkler activation temperature, one using a new belt and one with a used belt. The results showed that the suppression system was able to suppress the fires in ten minutes to the point that a miner could extinguish it with a fire hose. However, in several of the tests, the fire reestablished itself a few minutes after the sprinkler water supply was cut off and quickly grew out of control.

40|$|In {{agricultural}} pumping plants flowmeters {{are frequently}} installed with insufficient straight sections of pipe both {{upstream and downstream}} from the meter, {{in order to meet}} the established <b>installation</b> <b>specifications.</b> It has been found that flowmeter manufacturers do not know the error rate in flow measurements under these no optimal conditions. In 1998, Hanson found that a propeller flowmeter had an error of 3, 5 % when it was installed in a position a distance of two pipe diameters downstream from an elbow. This project investigated the performance of a turbine flowmeter under no optimal upstream and downstream conditions (conditions not considered by Hanson). Experiments were carried out in the Hydraulic Laboratory of the University of Guanajuato. Measurements were made in different flowmeter positions considering different flow rates. Results from this project showed that the flowmeter does not have a large error, even if it is installed in an incorrect position. However, lowest error rate is obtained when it was installed in the position recommended by the manufacturer. En pozos agrícolas, frecuentemente se presenta el caso de trenes de descarga con insuficientes tramos rectos para cumplir las especificaciones de instalación de medidores de flujo. Los fabricantes no conocen la variación del error de medición en que se incurre si los medidores se colocan bajo condiciones de insuficientes tramos rectos. Hanson (1998) encontró que un medidor de propela presenta un error de 3, 5 % si se coloca con dos diámetros aguas abajo de un codo de 90 o. Para conocer el desempeño de un medidor de turbina con poco tramo recto, tanto aguas arriba como aguas abajo (condiciones no consideradas por Hanson) se realizaron pruebas en el Laboratorio de Hidráulica de la Universidad de Guanajuato.
