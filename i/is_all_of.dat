5|$|A termite nest can be {{considered}} as being composed of two parts, the inanimate and the animate. The animate <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the termites living inside the colony, and the inanimate part is the structure itself, which is constructed by the termites. Nests can be broadly separated into three main categories: subterranean (completely below ground), epigeal (protruding above the soil surface), and arboreal (built above ground, but always connected to the ground via shelter tubes). Epigeal nests (mounds) protrude from the earth with ground contact and are made out of earth and mud. A nest has many functions such as providing a protected living space and providing shelter against predators. Most termites construct underground colonies rather than multifunctional nests and mounds. Primitive termites of today nest in wooden structures such as logs, stumps and the dead parts of trees, as did termites millions of years ago.|$|E

The long strath of Grisedale runs north-eastward to Ullswater, cutting off a series of hanging valleys which fall from the Helvellyn range. To the south east of Nethermost Pike, below the summit of High Crag, is Ruthwaite Cove. Surrounded by crag on three sides, this corrie contains Hard Tarn, a small pool on a rock shelf. This {{is one of the}} most difficult mountain tarns to locate, and its black algal bed and clear water combine to give the false impression of great depth. Ruthwaite Cove is now the site of Ruthwaite Lodge, a climbing hut. It was formerly the setting for more industrial activity, with the remains of several underground mines and some shallow open workings visible near the Lodge.|$|E

25|$|Biochemistry, {{sometimes}} called biological chemistry, {{is the study}} of chemical processes within and relating to living organisms. By controlling information flow through biochemical signaling and the flow of chemical energy through metabolism, biochemical processes give rise to the complexity of life. Over the last decades of the 20th century, biochemistry has become so successful at explaining living processes that now almost all areas of the life sciences from botany to medicine to genetics are engaged in biochemical research. Today, the main focus of pure biochemistry is on understanding how biological molecules give rise to the processes that occur within living cells, which in turn relates greatly to the study and understanding of tissues, organs, and whole organisms—that <b>is,</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> biology.|$|E

It was formerly the setting for more industrious activity, with the remains of several levels and some shallow open mineworking being visible near the Lodge.

Further leases were taken out in 1784 and 1862, the last-known operation being in 1880.

500|$|Some critics {{claim that}} Balzac surpassed Scott in some respects. In his {{introduction}} to the 1901 edition, poet and critic George Saintsbury writes that the character of Montauran enjoys [...] "a freedom from the flatness which not infrequently characterizes Sir Walter's own good young men." [...] By foregrounding the affair between Montauran and Marie, Balzac indicates passion as the central theme of history. As he writes in the 1842 foreword to La Comédie Humaine: [...] "a passion est toute l'humanité. Sans elle religion, l'histoire, le roman, l'art seraient inutiles." [...] ("assion <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> humanity. Without it religion, history, literature, and art would be useless.") ...|$|E
500|$|Perhaps {{the author}} most {{affected}} by Balzac was American expatriate novelist Henry James. In 1878 James wrote with sadness {{about the lack of}} contemporary attention paid to Balzac, and lavished praise on him in four essays (in 1875, 1877, 1902, and 1913). In 1878 James wrote: [...] "Large as Balzac is, he <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> one piece and he hangs perfectly together". He wrote with admiration of Balzac's attempt to portray in writing [...] "a beast with a hundred claws". In his own novels James explored more of the psychological motives of the characters and less of the historical sweep exhibited by Balzac—a conscious style preference; he stated: [...] "the artist of the Comédie Humaine is half smothered by the historian". Still, both authors used the form of the realist novel to probe the machinations of society and the myriad motives of human behavior.|$|E
