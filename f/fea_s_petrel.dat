40|$|Pelagic seabirds {{are highly}} mobile, {{reducing}} {{the likelihood of}} allopatric speciation where disruption of gene flow between populations is caused by physically insurmountable, extrinsic barriers. Spatial segregation during the non-breeding season appears to provide an intrinsic barrier to gene flow among seabird populations that otherwise occupy nearby or overlapping regions during breeding, but how this is achieved remains unclear. Here we show that the two genetically distinct populations of Cook 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>petrel</b> (Pterodroma cookii) exhibit transequatorial separation of non-breeding ranges at contemporary (ca. 2 – 3 yrs) and historical (ca. 100 yrs) time scales. Segregation during the non-breeding season per se appears as an unlikely barrier to gene flow. Instead we provide evidence that habitat specialization during the non-breeding season is associated with breeding asynchrony which, in conjunction with philopatry, restricts gene flow. Habitat specialization during breeding and non-breeding likely promotes evolutionary divergence between these two populations via local adaptation...|$|R

40|$|Intriguing {{features}} of the North American mid-continent are the widespread and prominent subhorizontal seismic reflectors that {{are thought to be}} associated with thick sequences of layered rocks beneath the Phanerozoic cover of the Illinois Basin. The present investigation was an effort to identify and interpret new structural {{features of}} the pre-Paleozoic crust at the Ancona Gas Storage field in north-central Illinois. A grid of existing seismic data was reprocessed using the technique of extended correlation. The reprocessed data was then analyzed using Schlumberger 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Petrel</b> visualization software for seismic interpretation and reconstruction of the 2 D and 3 D crustal geometry. The reprocessing unveiled strong, intermittent, subhorizontal reflectors underlying the Paleozoic basinal sediments. Existence of analogous subhorizontal reflectors in Arizona, southern United States, and the Siljan ring impact area in Sweden indicate that these features might be mafic intrusions in the Proterozoic crust. Alternatively, as revealed by the Kola Superdeep Borehole study in Kola, Russia, presence of fluid-filled fractures in the deeper crustal rocks could produce such strong subhorizontal reflectivity. Basement faults possibly produced by pre-Paleozoic crustal reactivation appear to project beneath the steeper part of the Ancona anticline. These faults are interpreted from a combination of isolated dipping reflections, diffractions, and truncations of reflectors in the seismic data. Future research in this region would require longer seismic lines with longer range of offsets than the original 2 D channel data, along with velocity information from bore holes, to develop a better structural model. However, an important conclusion of this work is that extended correlation of existing vibroseis datasets allowed the detection of structures deeper than what would have been possible through conventional processing...|$|R

40|$|International audienceArsenopyrite from La Roche-Balue quarry (Loire-Atlantique department, France), {{with the}} {{stoichiometric}} composition FeAsS, {{has been studied}} by X-ray single-crystal diffraction and 57 Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy. Its unit cell is a 5. 7612 (8), b 5. 6841 (7), c 5. 7674 (8) Å, β 111. 721 (8) °, and V 175. 46 (4) Å 3 (Z = 4). Taking into account very fine ubiquitous twinning on { 101 }, its crystal structure has been refined in the space group P 21 /c {{on the basis of}} 758 unique reflections [Fo > 4 σ(Fo) ] to R 1 = 0. 0298. Within uncertainty limits, it indicates three unmixed Fe, As and S positions. The 57 Fe Mössbauer spectrum of this arsenopyrite shows two broad absorption peaks that were fitted using the superposition of three doublets denoted as A, B and C, with parameters relative to area S, isomer shift δ, and quadrupole splitting ΔEQ, as follows: SA 82. 2 %, δA 0. 24 (1) mm/s, ΔEQA 1. 12 (2) mm/s; SB 8. 5 %, δB 0. 25 (1) mm/s, ΔEQB 0. 69 (2) mm/s; SC 9. 3 %, δC 0. 26 (1) mm/s, ΔEQC 1. 49 (2) mm/s. This set of values agrees well with the most recently published results for arsenopyrite samples with a composition close to stoichiometry. The three distinct Fe positions indicated by Mössbauer spectroscopy are not visible in the X-ray study. Whereas the main doublet A would seem to correspond to the <b>FeAs</b> 3 <b>S</b> 3 octahedron of the ideal structure, the two minor doublets B and C, with a ΔEQ shift towards marcasite and löllingite, respectively, may be due to local disorder (e. g., twin contact walls) changing the octahedral coordination of Fe to unequal As:S ratios...|$|R
40|$|A {{new design}} is {{presented}} for a wideband orthogonal interconnect between two perpendicular printed wiring boards, employing novel geometries and materials to minimize stress under cyclic loading. This will ensure fatigue survivability in high vibration environments, {{opening the door}} to vertical interconnection in RF circuit design. This is, to the best of knowledge, the first complete design and prototype for an orthogonal interconnect at the board level for broadband RF circuits. An analytical approach is used to define the driving parameters in the stress distribution within a smooth curve joining two perpendicular surfaces using analytical geometries, and Finite Element Analysis is used to finalize the design and ensure all constituent materials in the interconnect are subjected to stresses below their fatigue strength at 10 million cycles at full deflection. A manufacturing process is then proposed using thermoforming to shape the Liquid Crystal Polymer base material into the desired geometry, as well as an assembly solution to mount the interconnect to an RF signal feed card. Finally, a test setup is designed allowing for high cycle fatigue testing within the order of hours, including the capability to monitor performance of the interconnect by tracking DC continuity through a simulated application using a single post design. The prototype interconnect is tested to failure and is shown to survive 18 million cycles of a typical loading application before failure of the LCP springs occurs in the mode predicted by the initial <b>FEA</b> model.

40|$|The Australasian and Oriental green {{lacewing}} subgenus Ankylopteryx (Sencera) Navás (Chrysopinae: Ankylopterygini) is examined and its diversity and placement among {{other members of}} the tribe Ankylopterygini is discussed. After study of specimens spanning the full distribution and anatomical range of variation for the subgenus, all prior putative species, resulting in the sole valid species are newly synonymized, Ankylopteryx (Sencera) anomala (Brauer). Accordingly, the following new synonymies are established: Sencera scioneura Navás, syn. n., <b>S.</b> <b>feae</b> Navás, syn. n., and S. exquisita Nakahara, syn. n. [all under the name A. (S.) anomala]. A lectotype is newly designated for A. (S.) anomala so as to stabilize the application of the name. To support our hypotheses, the wing and general body coloration as well as the male genitalia are reviewed. We elaborate on the possibility of A. (S.) anomala being nothing more than an autapomorphic species of Ankylopteryx Brauer, as it was originally described. The species is not sufficiently distinct to warrant recognition as a separate subgenus within the group, and most certainly not as its own genus as has been advocated by past authors. Nonetheless, we do not for now {{go so far as to}} synonymize the subgenus until a more extensive phylogenetic analysis is undertaken with multiple representative species from across Ankylopteryx and other ankylopterygine genera. Lastly, we comment on the biology of A. (S.) anomala in terms of the attraction of males to methyl eugenol and on the widespread practice of splitting within Chrysopidae...|$|R
