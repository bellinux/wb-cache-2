5|$|For the French, the Rhine Campaign of 1795 proved {{especially}} <b>disastrous,</b> {{although they}} had achieved some success in other theaters of war (see for example, War of the Pyrenees (1793–95)).|$|E

5|$|After a <b>disastrous</b> {{helicopter}} {{crash in}} 1999 {{resulting in the}} deaths of six Marines and one sailor, the US Navy performed an assessment of their equipment and decided among other things that they needed a new search and rescue knife. The KA-BAR knives issued to the SBUs (Special Boat Units) had catastrophically failed to cut the Marines free from their webbing.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>disastrous</b> {{losses of}} Operation Bodenplatte, {{and failing to}} {{maintain}} air superiority over the Ardennes area, a severely weakened II./JG 1 transferred to Insterburg in East Prussia (modern Chernyakhovsk in Russia). I./JG 1 faced British fighters over Hengelo-Twente on 14 January 1945. JG 1 lost 12 pilots with 7 being killed, 3 wounded and 2 missing. Spitfires shot down the entire 1. and 2. staffels of JG 1 at Twente airport as they took off (for the loss of two). Ihlefeld threatened to court martial Major G. Capito, the new leader of I./JG 1, for such a <b>disastrous</b> loss {{but was unable to}} during the transferring to the Eastern Front. In Poland JG 1 were briefly assigned to Luftflotte Reich (the Air Fleet assigned to defend what was left of Germany from the final Allied offensives).|$|E
5|$|All of {{the gains}} {{made by the}} Black Watch and Calgary Highlanders were lost to German counterattacks, which inflicted heavy losses on the Highlanders and the {{previously}} unscathed Black Watch support company. The Black Watch had to be reformed after Verrières Ridge, having sustained more casualties than any Canadian infantry battalion since the <b>disastrous</b> raid on Dieppe.|$|E
5|$|As the Union army retreated towards Washington, it {{paused to}} re-group at Centreville, Virginia. On August 31, 1862, Gen. Lee ordered Lt. Gen. Jackson to flank the Union right and {{to cut the}} Union army off from Washington. This {{flanking}} effort resulted in the Battle of Chantilly which {{would prove to be}} the most <b>disastrous</b> engagement of the entire war for the 21st Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Basiliscus was {{the brother}} of Empress Aelia Verina, who was the wife of Emperor Leo I (457–474). His {{relationship}} with the Emperor allowed him to pursue a military career that, after minor initial successes, ended in 468, when he led the <b>disastrous</b> Roman invasion of Vandal Africa, {{in one of the}} largest military operations of Late Antiquity.|$|E
5|$|During the 11th century, the navy, {{like the}} Empire itself, began to decline. Faced with new naval {{challenges}} from the West, the Byzantines were increasingly forced {{to rely on}} the navies of Italian city-states like Venice and Genoa, with <b>disastrous</b> effects on Byzantium's economy and sovereignty. A period of recovery under the Komnenians was followed by another period of decline, which culminated in the <b>disastrous</b> dissolution of the Empire by the Fourth Crusade in 1204. After the Empire was restored in 1261, several emperors of the Palaiologan dynasty tried to revive the navy, but their efforts had only a temporary effect. By the mid-14th century, the Byzantine fleet, which once could put hundreds of warships to sea, was limited to a few dozen at best, and control of the Aegean passed definitively to the Italian and Ottoman navies. The diminished navy, however, continued to be active until the fall of the Byzantine Empire to the Ottomans in 1453.|$|E
5|$|During the Anti-Rightist Movement and the Great Leap Forward, Pan Fusheng {{sympathized with}} Marshal Peng Dehuai, who criticized Mao's <b>disastrous</b> {{collectivization}} policies. As a result, {{he became a}} major target of persecution by the fervent Mao loyalist Wu Zhipu, the Second Secretary of Henan, {{with the approval of}} the CPC Central Committee.|$|E
5|$|During the First World War, Robertson {{served with}} the 10th Light Horse in the Gallipoli Campaign, {{including}} the <b>disastrous</b> Battle of the Nek, where much of his regiment was wiped out. He later participated in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign, where he captured a Turkish Army general, and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order.|$|E
5|$|Haphazard {{industrial}} planning, increased urbanisation, {{poverty and}} lack of competence of the municipal government are seen as the major reasons for high levels of waste pollution in major Nigerian cities. Some of the 'solutions' have been <b>disastrous</b> to the environment, resulting in untreated waste being dumped in places where it can pollute waterways and groundwater.|$|E
5|$|In {{special cases}} {{involving}} unusually overweight trucks (which require special permits), not observing a bridge weight limit {{can lead to}} <b>disastrous</b> consequences. Fifteen days {{after the collapse of}} the Minneapolis bridge, a heavy truck collapsed a small bridge in Oakville, Washington.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{was one of}} the few leading Republicans not {{blamed for}} the <b>disastrous</b> results, and he sought to build on that in the 1966 congressional elections. He campaigned for many Republicans seeking to regain seats lost in the Johnson {{landslide}} and received credit for helping the Republicans make major gains in the midterm election.|$|E
5|$|On 15 November 1950, the Hjuksebø train {{disaster}} occurred, when a Class 66 train {{en route}} from Kristiansand to Oslo collided with freight cars that were running uncontrolled along the track between Hjuksebø and Holtås. The accident {{is among the most}} <b>disastrous</b> in Norwegian history, killing twelve people.|$|E
5|$|Peter Halkett was a Lieutenant in the Royal Navy in the 1840s. The son of John Halkett, a {{director}} of the Hudson's Bay Company who for many years had lived in Canada before returning to England, Peter Halkett had long held an interest in the exploration of the Canadian Arctic. He had a particular interest in John Franklin's <b>disastrous</b> Coppermine Expedition of 1819–1822.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying for UEFA Euro 2012 {{ended in}} {{familiar}} fashion; they lost all ten matches, scoring only one goal and conceding 25; their best results were two one-goal losses to Slovakia and a 3–1 loss in Ireland. The 2014 World Cup qualifying tournament {{was even more}} <b>disastrous.</b> Andorra lost all their matches while conceding 30 goals and not scoring.|$|E
5|$|Stafford {{held the}} comital title for only three months. In July {{he was sent}} north to quell a {{rebellion}} instigated by the discontented Earl of Warwick. Even though he escaped the <b>disastrous</b> Battle of Edgecote, he was executed by a mob at Bridgwater on 17 August 1469. Considered an overambitious man by many, Stafford was nevertheless a capable administrator, who enjoyed the absolute confidence of the king.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Red Cliffs {{unfolded}} in three stages: an initial skirmish at Red Cliffs {{followed by a}} retreat to the Wulin (烏林) battlefields on the northwestern bank of the Yangtze, a decisive naval engagement, and Cao Cao's <b>disastrous</b> retreat along Huarong Road.|$|E
5|$|The Continental Army, {{which had}} invaded Quebec in September 1775, {{suffered}} a severe blow in the <b>disastrous</b> attack on Quebec City on New Year's Eve in 1775. Following that loss, Benedict Arnold and {{the remnants of}} the army besieged Quebec until May 1776.|$|E
5|$|The Hawaiian {{monk seal}} {{has the lowest}} level of genetic {{variability}} among the 18 pinniped species, allegedly due to a population bottleneck caused by intense hunting in the 19th century. This limited genetic variability reduces the species's ability to adapt to environmental pressures and limits natural selection thus increasing their risk of extinction. Given the monk seal's small population, the effects of disease could be <b>disastrous.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Montreal Summer Olympics proved <b>disastrous</b> to Canada {{not only}} in {{financial}} terms; it failed to win a single gold medal despite being the host nation. Overall, it was 27th in the medal table, which remains the worst result a host nation has ever scored {{in the history of}} the Games.|$|E
5|$|The botched arrest {{attempt was}} {{politically}} <b>disastrous</b> for Charles. No English sovereign had ever entered the House of Commons, and his unprecedented {{invasion of the}} chamber to arrest its members was considered a grave breach of parliamentary privilege. In one stroke Charles destroyed his supporters' efforts to portray him as a defence against innovation and disorder.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} of Grodno proved <b>disastrous</b> to the allies {{who did not}} manage to attain any of their goals, while the Swedish army reached almost all of theirs; Stanisław Leszczyński was crowned king of Poland, the Saxon and Russian armies in Poland were beaten, and peace was forced upon Augustus who renounced all his claims to the Polish throne. The two traitors and principal designers of the campaign, Johann Patkul and Otto Arnold von Paykull were also taken prisoner by the Swedes and executed in 1707. However, the Great Northern War was far from being won. Charles reorganized his forces to march against his last remaining opponent, Peter the Great and the Tsardom of Russia. The Swedish invasion of Russia began in 1707 and ended with the <b>disastrous</b> Swedish defeat at Poltava. This marked a decisive turn in the war with Saxony and Denmark rejoining the alliance.|$|E
5|$|The {{civil war}} spawned a <b>disastrous</b> {{humanitarian}} crisis in Angola, internally displacing 4.28million people – one-third of Angola's total population. The United Nations estimated in 2003 that 80% of Angolans lacked access to basic medical care, 60% lacked access to water, and 30% of Angolan children would die {{before the age}} of five, with an overall national life expectancy of less than 40years of age.|$|E
5|$|The core {{allegation}} of the Keating Five affair is that Keating had made contributions of about $1.3 million to various U.S. Senators, {{and he called}} on those Senators to help him resist regulators. The regulators backed off, to later <b>disastrous</b> consequences.|$|E
5|$|The later {{experiences}} of the Canadian Army during the <b>disastrous</b> Dieppe Raid of 1942, American forces on Omaha Beach on D-Day and taking on Japanese defenders on Pacific Islands showed that under the right conditions, a defender could exact a terrible price from assaulting forces, significantly depleting and delaying enemy forces until reinforcements could be deployed to appropriate places via the sea and inland.|$|E
5|$|Tourism was an {{important}} industry for the country, but has been failing in recent years. The Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force released a report in June 2007, estimating 60% of Zimbabwe's wildlife has died since 2000 due to poaching and deforestation. The report warns {{that the loss of}} life combined with widespread deforestation is potentially <b>disastrous</b> for the tourist industry.|$|E
5|$|When the Byzantine emperor Basil II {{ascended the}} throne in 976, {{he made the}} {{destruction}} of independent Bulgaria his first ambition. Opposing him were the Western Bulgarians, now led by Samuel of Bulgaria. Basil II's first campaign was <b>disastrous,</b> the emperor barely escaping with his life when the Bulgarians annihilated the Byzantine army in the Gates of Trajan Pass in 986.|$|E
5|$|A <b>disastrous</b> {{fire started}} {{on the seventh floor}} on the night of 16 March 1954 and spread downwards. The keepers had no time to raise the alarm and were driven out of the {{lighthouse}} onto the rocks but rescued the next day when the relief vessel arrived as part of its regular schedule. The heat of the fire caused damage to both the interior and the structure and a lightship and series of temporary lights were installed during reconstruction. Three new generators were placed in the lighthouse to provide an electric light source, the lantern being re-lit on 6 August 1959.|$|E
5|$|After {{traveling}} south through rural Virginia in October 1780, Kościuszko {{proceeded to}} North Carolina {{to report to}} his former commander General Gates. However, following Gates's <b>disastrous</b> defeat at Camden on August 16, 1780, the Continental Congress had selected Washington's choice, Major General Nathanael Greene, to replace the disgraced Gates as commander of the Southern Department. When Greene formally assumed command on December 3, 1780, he retained Kościuszko as his chief engineer. By then, he had been praised by both Gates and Greene.|$|E
5|$|Although San Francisco {{had sought}} Tuolumne River water {{as early as}} the 1890s, this project did not move forward until the <b>disastrous</b> {{earthquake}} and fire of 1906, which underscored the insufficiency of the existing water supply. The Hetch Hetchy Valley – then compared to Yosemite Valley for its scenic beauty – was chosen for its water quality and hydroelectric potential, but the location within the national park generated controversy. An act of Congress was required to circumvent federal protection of the Tuolumne River, with the reasoning that public land should be developed for the public benefit.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{left the}} {{direction}} of the battle to subordinates, General Gates received a great deal of credit as the commanding general for the greatest American victory of the war to date. He may have conspired with others to replace George Washington as the commander-in-chief. Instead, he received the command of the main American army in the South. He led it to a <b>disastrous</b> defeat at the 1780 Battle of Camden, where he was at the forefront of a panicked retreat. Gates never commanded troops in the field again.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it allowed}} the militia men to draw Native American blood in revenge, {{the result of}} the battle was {{inconclusive}} with respect to its original purpose of stopping the Native American raids in the area. The men of the militia returned triumphantly to Galena, Illinois bearing the scalps of two Sauk warriors they had slain. The battle helped raise public opinion towards the militia. After the <b>disastrous</b> defeat at Stillman's Run in May, the battle at Yellow Creek coupled with the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, helped to demonstrate that the militia could stand up to and defeat Black Hawk's warriors.|$|E
5|$|Although {{opinions}} differed, some reactor experts {{feared that}} over time the hydrogen bubble might become flammable or, less likely, explosive by combining with free oxygen in the vessel. If the bubble burned or exploded, it could rupture the pressure vessel and force the damaged reactor core into the containment building. The loss of the vessel would not make a breach of containment inevitable, but it would {{increase the risk of}} a <b>disastrous</b> release of radioactivity.|$|E
5|$|Although the Chinese {{were unable}} to exploit the {{breakthrough}} in the UN lines, {{the weakness of the}} ROK II Corps on the Eighth Army's right flank was exposed to the Chinese commanders. During the planning of the Chinese Second Phase Campaign, Peng would again focus his attention towards the ROK II Corps at the Eighth Army's right flank, resulting in a <b>disastrous</b> defeat for the UN forces at the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River. To commemorate this battle as China's official entry into the Korean War, October 25 is currently the War to Resist America and Aid Korea Memorial Day in China.|$|E
5|$|Ambrose Everett Burnside (May 23, 1824– September 13, 1881) was an American soldier, {{railroad}} executive, inventor, industrialist, and politician from Rhode Island, {{serving as}} governor and a United States Senator. As a Union Army {{general in the}} American Civil War, he conducted successful campaigns in North Carolina and East Tennessee, as well as countering the raids of Confederate General John Hunt Morgan, but suffered <b>disastrous</b> defeats at the Battle of Fredericksburg and Battle of the Crater. His distinctive style of facial hair became known as sideburns, derived from his last name. He {{was also the first}} president of the National Rifle Association.|$|E
