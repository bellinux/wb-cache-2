40|$|Optimization of {{machining}} process parameters {{to achieve a}} set of quality attributes is important in bridging up the quality and productivity requirements especially in a turning operation. The quality attributes considered are surface <b>finish,</b> <b>material</b> removal rate and tool flank wear. The Present work applies to optimize the process parameter for turning medium carbon steel bar using HSS tool bit via conventional machining. Optimizing one quality attribute may lead to loss of other quality attribute. Hence in order to simultaneously satisfy all the three quality requirements a multi objective optimization is required. To achieve this exploration of grey relational theory, utility concepts are attempted. To meet the basic assumption of taguchi method that quality attributes should be uncorrelated the study applies PCA based multivariate statistical method and eliminates correlation that exists in between the responses. Experiments have been conducted based on taguchi’s L 9 Orthogonal array design with different combinations of process control parameters: (Cutting speed, Feed, Depth of cut). Surface roughness, Material removal rate, Tool Flank wear are the response parameters that will be optimized. The obtained result will be verified through confirmatory test. This work highlights the effectiveness of proposed method for solving multi objective optimization of turning process.

Equations for computing flank surface area of gear tooth flank surfaces in terms geometric parameters of involute profile of straight bevel gears were also developed. The developed models were validated by conducting twelve experiments using one-factor-at-a-time approach and varying applied voltage, pulse-on time and pulse-off time each at four levels. Values and trends of variation of volumetric MRR and surface roughness depth predicted by the proposed models have shown very close agreement with corresponding experimental values and their trends. Minimum prediction errors for the proposed models were found to be − 3. 3 % and 1 % for volumetric MRR and surface roughness depth respectively.
