These reforms were supposed to provide an opportunity to <b>Greek</b> <b>banks</b> to improve their efficiency and to enhance their competitiveness in view of ongoing financial integration in Europe and the introduction of the euro. The results obtained indicate that important cost X-inefficiencies are in place. Some evidence is provided that bank characteristics such as bank size, type of ownership and risk behaviour do play a role in explaining differences in measured inefficiencies. Scale economies are also examined and the findings indicate that the <b>Greek</b> <b>banking</b> industry experiences economies of scale, though they have declined throughout the observed period. This suggests that competitive viability may be an important factor for further consolidation in the <b>Greek</b> <b>banking</b> industry. X-efficiency, scale economies, panel data...|$|R

During the last period of time the importance of M&A in the <b>Greek</b> <b>banking</b> sector have been reinvigorated {{as a result of}} a without precedent financial and economic crisis the <b>Greek</b> economy and <b>banking</b> sector faces, and the ongoing pressure both by Greek authorities and foreign institutions (IMF), for bigger and more efficient banks. In this paper the effect of the announcement of an M&A proposal that took place in the summer of 2010, on the share prices of three major <b>Greek</b> <b>banks</b> listed in the Athens Stock Exchange Market, is assessed. The bidder was a private bank (Piraeus Bank), while the targets banks were two state owned banks (Hellenic Postbank and Agricultural Bank of Greece).

40|$|The present paper uses three {{different}} New Empirical Industrial Organization (NEIO) approaches (Panzar-Rosse, Bresnahan-Lau and Hall-Roeger models) to investigate competitive {{conditions in the}} <b>Greek</b> <b>banking</b> sector over the period 1995 - 2004. One important event which {{has taken place in}} the <b>Greek</b> <b>banking</b> industry, especially after 1998, is a wave of mergers and acquisitions. This study also measures and compares the degree of banking competition in two sub-periods, 1995 - 1998 and 1999 - 2004, in order to investigate the effect of mergers and acquisitions on the competitive structure of <b>Greek</b> <b>banking.</b> The empirical results of the three models indicate a shift from competitive to non-competitive conditions when moving from the first to the second sub-period. This finding suggests that mergers and acquisitions have affected the level of completion of <b>Greek</b> <b>banking,</b> rendering the industry less competitive. Furthermore, taking into consideration the negative effects of mergers and acquisitions on technical efficiency and the total factor productivity of <b>Greek</b> <b>banking</b> (Rezitis, 2008), the empirical findings of the present study provide some indications that one of the outcomes of the Greek banks' merging activities, {{at least in the short}} run, might be to attain market power and thus higher profits, rather than higher efficiency and lower costs.

The study is motivated by the hypothesis that both macroeconomic and bank-specific variables have an effect on loan quality and that these effects vary between different categories of loans. The results show that NPLs in the <b>Greek</b> <b>banking</b> system can be explained mainly by macrofundamentals (GDP, unemployment, interest rates) and management quality. Differences in the quantitative impact of macroeconomic factors among types of loans are evident with non-performing mortgages being the least responsive towards changes in the macroeconomic conditions.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{tries to}} shed light on the {{existence}} of a bank lending channel (BLC) in South Eastern European countries (SEE). Based on a VAR framework we test the responsiveness of credit supply to monetary policy shocks. By compiling a new data set and using the reserve requirement ratio, among others, as the policy instrument we measure the effectiveness of the BLC and the buffering effect of the banks in the SEE countries. The results indicate that loan supply is significantly affected by shifts in monetary policy, when demand factors are controlled. Furthermore, by analyzing the effect of the <b>Greek</b> <b>banks</b> in the region we conclude that <b>Greek</b> <b>banks</b> do buffer the negative effects of monetary policy transmission. By having a significant market share of the SEE’s banking markets we argue that <b>Greek</b> <b>banks</b> influence positively the economic growth of SEE countries...|$|R

It also compares the 1982 - 92 and 1993 - 97 sub-periods, since after 1992 the <b>Greek</b> <b>banking</b> sector experienced substantial changes. The Malmquist productivity index and the DEA method are used to measure and decompose {{productivity growth}} and technical efficiency, respectively. Productivity growth is higher after 1992. Recent growth is mainly attributed to technical progress, while until 1992 growth is mainly attributed to improvements in efficiency. Furthermore, after 1992, pure efficiency is higher, and scale efficiency is lower, indicating that although banks achieved higher pure technical efficiency, they moved away from optimal scale. Finally, Tobit results show that size and specialization have positive effects on both pure and scale efficiency. <b>Greek</b> <b>banking,</b> efficiency, productivity growth, Malmquist index, DEA...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the {{productivity}} of the <b>Greek</b> <b>banking</b> sector for the time period 2004 - 2006. Design/methodology/approach – Standard ratio measures of bank financial performance have been used as output measures in a data envelopment analysis model in combination with efficiency ratios’ analysis. Findings – The <b>Greek</b> <b>banking</b> efficiency remains relatively constant throughout the period under observation, while, on average, big banks perform better than medium and small ones. Research limitations/implications – Profit and loss accounts as well as balance sheet accounts of each bank are used for examining bank efficiency. Practical implications – A positive relationship between bank size and performance is observed. More specifically, it is suggested that large total assets gives a bank the ability to achieve higher efficiency levels; thus, a merger of two small banks will probably increase their efficiency and competitiveness in the long term. Originality/value – <b>Greek</b> <b>banks</b> are at a crossroad and faced with the dilemma of expanding their operations internationally or staying at home. The current financial crisis has made this dilemma stronger. The paper's findings suggest that probably the best solution for the <b>Greek</b> <b>banks</b> to overcome their current problem is to merge. Banks, Financial performance, Greece...|$|R
40|$|During the 1990 s the Greek {{economy has}} flourished, {{with the help}} of the banking system, which, at the same period, has {{undergone}} considerable deregulation. The stock market “explosion” at the end of the decade has provided the necessary funds for the expansion of many <b>Greek</b> <b>Banks</b> in various countries and particularly those of the Balkan area. Some Greek companies had already expanded their business activities in these countries, which at the time were in the process of transition to the market economy, thus giving to the <b>Greek</b> <b>Banks</b> the incentive to follow their clientele. The expansion of <b>Greek</b> <b>banks</b> in the Balkans was such that they obtained significant market shares in some of the area’s countries. In the current paper we make an effort to examine the feasibility of the expansion of <b>Greek</b> <b>banks</b> in these countries, focusing especially on their financial efficiency. To that end the Balance Sheets of the parent banks, as well as those of their Balkan subsidiaries and associate companies where they held an equity share were studied and analyzed.

The basis for our econometric analysis is provided by an unbalanced panel dataset for 19 <b>Greek</b> <b>bank</b> subsidiaries operating in 11 nations, covering the period from 1995 to 2001. The results show that the profitability of the parent bank and the operating experience of its host nation subsidiaries have a robust and positive impact on the profits of <b>Greek</b> <b>banks</b> abroad, whereas subsidiary bank size has a negative effect. Domestic financial factors reflecting stock market developments, bank-specific factors such as liquidity, loan loss provisions or cost efficiency, and market specific factors like concentration or market share in the host nations, are all insignificant in explaining Greek subsidiary banks' profits. © 2006 Elsevier B.

Our results provide weak evidence of the phenomenon of persistence in profitability.
