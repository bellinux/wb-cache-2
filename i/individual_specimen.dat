500|$|Louis Etienne Thirioux, {{an amateur}} naturalist at Port Louis, also found many dodo remains around 1900 from several locations. They {{included}} the first articulated specimen, {{which is the}} first subfossil dodo skeleton found outside the Mare aux Songes, and the only remains of a juvenile specimen, a now lost tarsometatarsus. The former specimen was found in 1904 in a cave near Le Pouce mountain, and is the only known complete skeleton of an individual dodo. Thirioux donated the specimen to the Museum Desjardins (now Natural History Museum at Mauritius Institute). Thrioux's heirs sold a second mounted composite skeleton (composed of at least two skeletons, with a mainly reconstructed skull) to the Durban Museum of Natural Science in South Africa in 1918. Together, these two skeletons represent the most completely known dodo remains, including bone elements previously unrecorded (such as knee-caps and various wing bones). Though some contemporary writers noted the importance of Thrioux's specimens, they were not scientifically studied, and were largely forgotten until 2011, when sought out by a group of researchers. The mounted skeletons were laser scanned, from which 3-D models were reconstructed, which became the basis of a 2016 monograph about the osteology of the dodo. [...] In 2006, explorers discovered a complete skeleton of a dodo in a lava cave in Mauritius. This was only the second associated skeleton of an <b>individual</b> <b>specimen</b> everfound, and the only one in recent times.|$|E
2500|$|Octávio Mateus, Susannah Maidment and Nicolai Christiansen named {{and shortly}} {{described}} Miragaia in 2009. The type species is Miragaia longicollum.

The specific name means [...] "long neck" [...] from the Latin longus, [...] "long" [...] and collum, [...] "neck". A partial pelvis (ilium and pubic bone) and two partial dorsal vertebrae from a juvenile <b>individual</b> (<b>specimen</b> ML433-A) were found at the same location, intermingled with the bones of the holotype, and were also assigned, as a paratype, to M. longicollum.|$|E

2500|$|Almost {{all species}} kept in marine aquaria {{at this time}} {{are caught in the}} wild, {{although}} tank-raised specimens are becoming increasingly common as a viable alternative. Only a few species such as clownfish are captive-bred on a commercial scale. Much collecting is done in Indonesia and the Philippines, where use of cyanide and other destructive collection methods, while discouraged, is unfortunately common. The majority of live rock is also harvested in the wild, and recent restrictions on this harvest in Florida have caused a shift to Fijian and aquacultured rock. Natural rock, because it is created by coral polyps, takes many years if not centuries to form, and is a vital habitat for countless marine species; thus, commercial-scale harvesting of naturally occurring live rock has been criticized by conservationists. Additionally, many animal species sold to hobbyists have very specific dietary and habitat requirements that cannot be met by hobbyists (e.g. Labroides genus wrasses, the moorish idol); these animals almost inevitably die quickly and have markedly reduced lifespans compared to wild specimens. Often these specific environmental requirements cause improperly housed lifestock's color and appearance to be poor. These issues are often downplayed by individuals and organizations with a financial interest in the trade. Hobbyists who support conservation should buy only certified net-caught fish (although ensuring the legitimacy of such claims can be difficult) or captive-raised fish, as well as farmed corals and to support legitimate reef conservation efforts. The majority of corals can be [...] "fragged", whereby a portion of a larger captive coral is separated and can subsequently be raised into an <b>individual</b> <b>specimen,</b> allowing for coral propagation within the domestic aquarium; the trade in frags (i.e. fragments) offers a fantastic opportunity for marine aquarists to obtain new and unique corals while limiting the impact on the natural environment. Rare species and those without a history of being successfully kept in captivity should be avoided.|$|E

60|$|Peterchen {{spoke in}} the {{confident}} voice of one accustomed to utter his sentiments to inferiors, who either dared not, or did not deem it wise, to dispute his oracles; and he ended with another deep-mouthed laugh, that filled the vaulted apartment of the smiling prior to the ceiling. Father Michael took all in good part, answering, as was his wont in mildness and good-tempered charity; for he was a priest of much learning, deep reflection, and rebuked opinions. The community over which he presided was so far worldly in its object as to keep the canons in constant communion with men, {{and he would not}} now have {{met for the first time}} one of those self-satisfied, authoritative, boisterous, well-meaning beings, of whose class Peterchen formed so conspicuous a member, had this been the first of the bailiff's visits to the Col. As it was, however, the Prior not only understood the species, but he well knew the <b>individual</b> <b>specimen,</b> and he was well enough disposed to humor the noisy pleasantry of his companion. Disburthened of his superfluous clothing, delivered of his introductory jokes, and having achieved his salutations to the several canons, with suitable words of recognition to the three or four novices who were usually found on the mountain, Peterchen declared his readiness to enter on the duty of what the French call restoration. This want had been foreseen, and the Prior led the way to a private refectory, where preparations had been made for a sufficient supper, the bailiff being very generally known to be a huge feeder.|$|E
60|$|Basal Calcareous Cup or Discs.--I {{have seen}} this part in all the species, except L. Valentiana, and in this it {{probably}} occurs, considering its very close alliance with L. truncata. The size, form, and conditions of the cup or disc varies infinitely according to the age, size, and position of the <b>individual</b> <b>specimen.</b> We will commence with a full-sized animal, which has ceased to burrow downwards into the rock, {{in which case the}} discs usually grow into a cup, and become largely developed. In L. dorsalis alone, I have seen many specimens, so that the following description and remarks, though applicable I believe to all the species, are drawn up from that alone. The cup (Pl. VIII, fig. 1 a´, 1 c´) is hardly ever regular in outline, and is either slightly or very deeply concave; I have seen one, half an inch in diameter; it is formed of several thick layers of dirty white, translucent, calcareous matter, with sinuous margins; externally the surface is very irregular, and is coated by yellow membrane presently to be described. The innermost and last-formed layer sometimes covers the whole inside of the cup, and extends a little beyond its margin all round; but more generally it projects beyond only one side, leaving the other sides deserted. I have seen a single new layer extending beyond the underlying old layers, as much as one sixth of an inch; and again I have seen a part of the cup, as much as a quarter of an inch in width, deserted and covered with serpulæ. So irregular, however, is the growth, that after a period an old deserted portion will occasionally be again covered by a new layer, though of course without organic adhesion. Again it sometimes happens that the last-formed layer, remaining central, is very much less than the older layers; in one such instance the innermost and last-formed layer (fig. 1 a´) had a diameter of only a quarter of that of the whole cup, in the middle of which it was placed; the cup thus tends to become filled up in the middle. The cup, in its fully developed condition, is seated at the very bottom of the cavity in the rock. From the aggregate thickness of the several component layers forming the cup, the old and mature animal rises a little in its burrow; for instance, the bottom of the cup in one specimen which I measured, was 4/10ths of an inch in thickness.|$|E
