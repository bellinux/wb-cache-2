40|$|Double-stranded DNA immune {{complexes}} (DNA-ICs) were assayed by millipore filtration and deoxyribonuclease digestion in 40 {{patients with}} both active and inactive {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} (SLE). The assay is superior to the <b>double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>antibody</b> (ds ADA) {{as an indicator of}} active disease, and, when combined with the total haemolytic complement (CH 50) and ds ADA levels it increases the prediction of the relative risk of active disease.

40|$|Abstract: CC {{chemokine}} receptor (CCR) 4 is se-lectively expressed on Th 2 -type T {{cells and}} {{has been shown to}} be responsible for Th 2 -dominant immune responses. In this study, we analyzed the expression of CCR 4 in active systemic lupus ery-thematosus (SLE) patients by FACS analysis using anti-human CCR 4 monoclonal antibody and deter-mined the clinical relevance in this disease. Higher expression of CCR 4 was found on peripheral blood CD 41 T lymphocytes of active SLE patients than was found with healthy controls and inactive SLE patients. The CCR 4 expression significantly corre-lated with the SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) scores. The expression was dramatically decreased after the corticosteroid therapy in parallel with a serum level of <b>double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>antibody</b> and SLEDAI scores. Moreover, we found that serum levels of IL- 10 were increased in active SLE pa-tients and significantly correlated with the CCR 4 expression.

40|$|AbstractThe AL 1 protein {{of tomato}} golden mosaic virus (TGMV) is encoded by the viral DNA {{and has been}} shown to be {{essential}} for viral DNA replication. We have over-expressed the AL 1 open reading frame in E. coli and purified the protein from bacterial extracts to near homogeneity. Using various different techniques we have studied the interaction of the AL 1 protein with DNA. The AL 1 protein is able to bind to DNA containing the common region of the viral genome, which can be demonstrated by photochemical cross-linking. Binding is 4 -fold stronger to single-stranded than to <b>double-stranded</b> <b>DNA.</b> <b>Antibodies</b> against the AL 1 protein can be used to precipitate the protein-DNA complex.

Exertional dyspnea appeared within 2 months after her third delivery. On admission, a chest x-ray showed pulmonary congestion, bilateral pleural effusion, and enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Urinalysis revealed proteinuria (1. 2 g/day) and gross hematuria. Laboratory examinations disclosed leukocytopenia (2, 500 /Î¼l), hypoalbuminemia (2. 3 g/dl), renal dysfunction (serum creatinine, 1. 7 mg/dl), hypocomplementemia (CH 50, 3 U/ml), {{and the presence of}} anti- <b>double-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>antibodies.</b> Endomyocardial biopsy revealed swelling of myocardial cells, infiltration of small mononuclear cells to the interstitium, and severe interstitial edema.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the utility of anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) testing in the investigation of cutaneous and other lupus symptoms in female carriers of X-linked chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). We undertook a prospective study of 19 carrier mothers attending our institution, with direct questioning of carriers concerning symptoms and testing for anti-nuclear and anti-phospholipid antibodies. A total of 58 % reported significant photosensitive skin rashes, 42 % reported mouth ulcers and 37 % complained of joint pains that could not be attributed to other known causes. Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) testing was negative in 73 % of all carriers. The five positive ANAs were of low titre (maximum 1 : 320 on Hep 2 cells in two women) and only one weak positive <b>double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>antibody</b> and no extractable nuclear antibodies were found. Several of the mothers, despite negative serology, benefited from referral to a specialist, and in some cases to specific treatment. A history of skin rashes, joint pain, fatigue and mouth ulcers should be sought actively in the female relatives of X-CGD patients but negative lupus serology should not preclude referral to appropriate dermatology or rheumatology services. as symptoms may respond well to appropriate treatment...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{document}} {{a case of}} severe, progressive myopathy, myalgias, arthralgias, {{and weakness}} possibly caused by amlodipine in a patient with benign essential hypertension. CASE SUMMARY: A 52 -year-old white woman with asthma and newly diagnosed hypertension was initiated on zafirlukast therapy for asthma and amlodipine therapy for hypertension. Two months later, the patient reported severe, generalized muscle and joint pain, muscle stiffness, and weakness. The zafirlukast was discontinued without resolution of symptoms. Laboratory tests revealed an elevated C-reactive protein. The amlodipine dosage was increased. Her symptoms persisted and further laboratory tests revealed a positive anti-nuclear antibody screen, and negative single- and <b>double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>antibody</b> tests. After another amlodipine dosage increase, the patient experienced a sudden onset of left-sided facial numbness, facial weakness, and a severe headache. The patient was admitted to rule out a possible cerebrovascular event or a metabolic neurologic process. Magnetic resonance imaging showed no abnormalities. The patient discontinued the amlodipine and reported complete resolution of the neurologic symptoms after 4 days. One month later, zafirlukast was reinitiated without a return of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Amlodipine was not initially suspected {{as a cause of}} these symptoms because these effects are not commonly associated with amlodipine therapy. However, due to the temporal relationship and progression of symptoms with increasing amlodipine dosage, drug-related causes were eventually explored. Review of the medical literature suggests myalgias and arthralgias may be adverse effects common to dihydropyridine calcium-channel antagonists...|$|E
40|$|A 60 -year-old {{woman was}} {{admitted}} tohospital {{for evaluation of}} sudden onsetof visual loss in both eyes. The day before admission, sudden blurring of vision had developed, {{with the appearance of}} black floaters almost simultaneously in both eyes. This was followed by rapid deterioration of vision {{over the course of the}} next four to six hours, leading to perception of bright light only. There was no preceding history of trauma, pain or redness in the eyes, headache or fever. She had noticed a rash on her arms and legs for the past two weeks but had not sought medical attention. The patient had a 10 -year history of systemic lupus erythematosus, which would relapse occa-sionally. During relapses, her symptoms mostly consisted of fatigue, intermittent low-grade fever, polyarthralgia, myalgia, serositis (pleurisy and pleural effusion), and a waxing and waning mac-ulopapular rash on her extremities. She had no history of renal or neurologic involvement. Pre-vious laboratory evaluation showed positive results for antinuclear antibody, <b>double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>antibody,</b> lymphopenia and hypocomple-mentemia, but negative results for anticardiolipin antibodies. At the time of presentation, the patient was taking hydroxychloroquine 100 mg twice daily, prednisone 15 mg daily and azathio-prine 75 mg daily. On examination, the patient looked unwell and quite anxious. She was afebrile, her heart rate was 85 beats/min and her blood pressure was 150 / 83 mm Hg. Her pupils were equal, round and sluggishly responsive to light; there was no affer-ent pupillary defect. Extraocular movements were intact. Her visual acuity was reduced bilat-erally to perception of hand motion only. There were palpable purpuric rashes on her upper and lower extremities, with oozing and crusting asso-ciated with ulceration of some of these lesions around the ankles (Figure 1 A and B). The rest of her examination was unremarkable. The patient was admitted to hospital and underwent urgent ophthalmology consultation. On slit-lamp examination, the anterior segment was normal bilaterally with white conjunctiva, clear cornea, deep and quiet anterior chamber and flat iris. The findings on retinal examina-tion, which included macular edema, swelling of the optic discs, extensive hemorrhage, tortu-ous veins, and sheathing of the retinal vessels, are shown in Figure 1 C and D.

40|$|ABSTRACT Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE) is the prototypical systemic autoimmune disease in humans and {{is characterized by}} the presence of hyperactive immune cells and aberrant antibody responses to nuclear and cytoplasmic antigens, including characteristic anti â <b>double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>antibodies.</b> We performed a cross-sectional study in order to determine if an SLE-associated gut dysbiosis exists in patients without active disease. A group of 20 SLE patients in remission, for which there was strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, was recruited, and we used an optimized Ion Torrent 16 S rRNA gene-based analysis pro-tocol to decipher the fecal microbial profiles of these patients and compare them with those of 20 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. We found diversity to be comparable based on Shannonâs index. However, we saw a significantly lower Firmic-utes/Bacteroidetes ratio in SLE individuals (median ratio, 1. 97) than in healthy subjects (median ratio, 4. 86; P< 0. 002). A lower Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in SLE individuals was corroborated by quantitative PCR analysis. Notably, a decrease of some Firmicutes families was also detected. This dysbiosis is reflected, based on in silico functional inference, in an overrepresentation of oxidative phosphorylation and glycan utilization pathways in SLE patient microbiota.

40|$|Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE) is a genetically complex disease with heterogeneous clinical manifestations. Recent studies have greatly expanded {{the number of}} established SLE risk alleles, but the distribution of multiple risk alleles in cases versus controls {{and their relationship to}} subphenotypes have not been studied. We studied 22 SLE susceptibility polymorphisms with previous genome-wide evidence of association (p < 5 Ã 10 - 8) in 1919 SLE cases from 9 independent Caucasian SLE case series and 4813 independent controls. The mean number of risk alleles in cases was 15. 1 (SD 3. 1) while the mean in controls was 13. 1 (SD 2. 8), with trend p = 4 Ã 10 - 128. We defined a genetic risk score (GRS) for SLE as the number of risk alleles with each weighted by the SLE risk odds ratio (OR). The OR for high-low GRS tertiles, adjusted for intra-European ancestry, sex, and parent study, was 4. 4 (95 % CI 3. 8 - 5. 1). We studied associations of individual SNPs and the GRS with clinical manifestations for the cases: age at diagnosis, the 11 American College of Rheumatology classification criteria, and <b>double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>antibody</b> (anti-dsDNA) production. Six subphenotypes were significantly associated with the GRS, most notably anti-dsDNA (OR high-low = 2. 36, p = 9 e- 9), the immunologic criterion (OR high-low = 2. 23, p = 3 e- 7), and age at diagnosis (OR high-low = 1. 45, p = 0. 0060). Finally, we developed a subphenotype-specific GRS (sub-GRS) for each phenotype with more power to detect cumulative genetic associations. The sub-GRS was more strongly associated than any single SNP effect for 5 subphenotypes (the above plus hematologic disorder and oral ulcers), while single loci are more significantly associated with renal disease (HLA-DRB 1, OR = 1. 37, 95 % CI 1. 14 - 1. 64) and arthritis (ITGAM, OR = 0. 72, 95 % CI 0. 59 - 0. 88). We did not observe significant associations for other subphenotypes, for individual loci or the sub-GRS. Thus our analysis categorizes SLE subphenotypes into three groups: those having cumulative, single, and no known genetic association with respect to the currently established SLE risk loci...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction Antiphospholipid {{syndrome}} (APS) {{is characterized}} by recurrent arterial and venous thrombosis and detection of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs). This syndrome {{may be associated with}} connective tissue disorders, or with malignancies, but it may also appear in isolated form (primary APS). We report on a pediatric patient presenting with acute adrenal failure as the first manifestation of primary APS. Case report A previously healthy 11 -year-old boy developed fever, abdominal pain, and vomiting. An abdominal computed tomography scan showed nodular lesions in the adrenal glands. He was referred to our Department and a diagnosis of APS and acute adrenal failure was considered, based on positive aPLs (IgG and IgM), elevated ACTH levels and low cortisol levels. Other features were anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated inflammatory parameters, hypergammaglobulinemia, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, positive antinuclear, anticardiolipin, anti-platelet <b>antibodies,</b> with negative <b>double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>antibodies.</b> Lupus anticoagulant and Coombâs tests were positive.

40|$|Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE) is the prototype autoimmune disease where genes regulated by type I interferon (IFN) are over-expressed {{and contribute to}} the disease pathogenesis. Because signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT 4) {{plays a key role in}} the type I IFN receptor signaling, we performed a candidate gene study of a comprehensive set of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) in STAT 4 in Swedish patients with SLE. We found that 10 out of 53 analyzed SNPs in STAT 4 were associated with SLE, with the strongest signal of association (P = 7. 1 Ã 10 â 8) for two perfectly linked SNPs rs 10181656 and rs 7582694. The risk alleles of these 10 SNPs form a common risk haplotype for SLE (P = 1. 7 Ã 10 â 5). According to conditional logistic regression analysis the SNP rs 10181656 or rs 7582694 accounts for all of the observed association signal. By quantitative analysis of the allelic expression of STAT 4 we found that the risk allele of STAT 4 was over-expressed in primary human cells of mesenchymal origin, but not in B-cells, and that the risk allele of STAT 4 was over-expressed (P = 8. 4 Ã 10 â 5) in cells carrying the risk haplotype for SLE compared with cells with a non-risk haplotype. The risk allele of the SNP rs 7582694 in STAT 4 correlated to production of anti-dsDNA (<b>double-stranded</b> <b>DNA)</b> <b>antibodies</b> and displayed a multiplicatively increased, 1. 82 -fold risk of SLE with two independent risk alleles of the IRF 5 (interferon regulatory factor 5) gene...|$|R

A 1 : 80 dilution of patients' sera was added to respective wells followed by tritiated high affinity anti-IgG, -IgA, or IgM. Denatured DNA (single-stranded DNA) bound to methylated bovine serum albumin had less than 5 % reannealment to the double-stranded form and provided a better substrate for Ab binding than <b>double-stranded</b> <b>DNA,</b> producing a linear binding curve. Of 58 patients diagnosed as having systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), only 11 having active SLE had IgG antibody levels of> 5. 0 Î¼g/ml to single-strand DNA.

Patients with 1 gM <b>antibodies</b> to <b>DNA</b> alone had more benign types of SLE with little renal involvement. No abnormal levels of IgA Ab to either single-strand <b>DNA</b> or <b>double-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> were found in SLE patients' sera. Corticosteroid and/or immunosuppressant treatment caused a marked drop in the IgM Ab level to DNA within 10 days while IgG Ab to DNA remained high for up to 30 days.

Multiple sclerosis disability was quantified using Kurtzkeâs Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). The EDSS provides a total score {{on a scale that}} ranges from 0 to 10. The first levels 1.0 to 4.5 refer to people {{with a high degree of}} ambulatory ability, and the subsequent levels 5.0 to 9.5 refer to the loss of ambulatory ability (Kurtzke 1983). All MS cases underwent brain MRI after triple dose gadolinium diethylene-triaminepenta-acetic acid. For JO-SLE patients, the SLE activity index (SLEDAI) was used to assess disease activity (Galdman et al. 2000) and Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology damage index (SLICC/ACR) was used to assess accumulated damage (Gladman et al. 1997).

We present the initial long-term experience of the safety and efficacy of rituximab for treatment of SLE in children. Eighteen patients (mean age 14 [*]Â±[*] 3 Â years) with severe SLE were treated with rituximab after demonstrating resistance or toxicity to conventional regimens. There was a predominance of female (16 / 18) and ethnic African (13 / 18) patients. All had lupus nephritis [World Health Organization (WHO) classesÂ  3 â 5] and systemic manifestations of vasculitis. Clinical disease activity of the SLE was scored with the SLE-disease activity index 2 K (SLEDAI- 2 K). Patients were followed-up for an average of 3. 0 [*]Â±[*] 1. 3 Â years (range 0. 5 to 4. 8 Â years). B-cell depletion occurred within 2 Â weeks in all patients and persisted for up to 1 Â year in some.

Five patients required multiple courses of RTX for relapse, with B-cell repopulation. One died of infectious endocarditis related to severe immunosuppression. In conclusion, our data support the efficacy of rituximab as adjunctive treatment for SLE in children. Although rituximab was well tolerated by the majority of patients, randomized controlled trials are required to establish its long-term safety and efficacy...|$|R

Here, we review the different lines of research which are presently being conducted to understand how these autoantibodies are generated (e. g. through apoptotic body formation, molecular mimicry and other mechanisms) and how they encounter antigen in order to cause an autoimmune disease.

Involved kidneys and skin contained deposits of extranuclear single-stranded <b>DNA</b> (ssDNA), <b>double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> (dsDNA) and <b>antibodies</b> to <b>DNA</b> (1, 3 - 5). The presence of <b>antibodies</b> to <b>DNA</b> in circulation was not sufficient to induce disease (6 - 8), leading several investigators to propose that DNA antigen must be present in the circulation or deposited in tissues to form immune complexes (2, 6, 9). Sera of some SLE patients contained significantly higher levels of ssDNA and dsDNA than did normal controls (2, 9 - 11), and serial studies on some of these patients (2, 9) indicated that serum DNA antigen and anti-DNA antibody levels may alternate, suggesting possible intermittent formation of immune complexes in the circulation. Tan (12) and Gabrielsen (13) postulated that DNA is normally released into the circulation with cell breakdown in skin and bone marrow, or with tissue injury.

This novel bacterial polymerase, named PolX(Dr), was identified as the product of the Deinococcal DR 0467 gene. The purified PolX(Dr) protein possesses a DNA polymerase activity that is stimulated by MnCl 2, a property of the X family <b>DNA</b> polymerases. <b>Antibodies</b> raised against PolX(Dr) recognized human pol lambda, rat pol beta and yeast Pol 4 and, conversely, antibodies raised against these proteins recognized PolX(Dr). This immunological cross-reactivity suggests a high degree of structural conservation among the polymerases of the X family. Lack of PolX(Dr) reduced the rate of repair of <b>double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> breaks and increased cell sensitivity to gamma-rays. PolX(Dr) thus appears {{to play an important role}} in <b>double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> break repair in D. radiodurans...|$|R

40|$|Suppression of {{circulating}} <b>antibodies</b> to <b>double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> {{was achieved}} in NZB/NZW f 1 female mice by repeated administration of an IgG 2 a monoclonal <b>antibody</b> to <b>DNA.</b> Deaths from nephritis were delayed; glomerular deposition of IgG {{and of the}} cationic IgG <b>DNA</b> <b>antibodies</b> characteristic of murine lupus nephritis were diminished. Quantities of circulating <b>antibodies</b> to single-stranded <b>DNA</b> were not reduced compared with untreated or IgG myeloma-treated control mice. Antibodies directed against the monoclonal anti-DNA appeared in the circulation of treated mice after three inoculations of the idiotype. Those antibodies did not react with another monoclonal anti-DNA of the same allotype. One monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibody was obtained in hybridoma cultures derived from a spleen of a treated mouse. Cross-reactive or common idiotypes were found in 30 - 50 % of NZB/NZW f 1 sera and monoclonal <b>DNA</b> <b>antibodies.</b> Deletions of portions of the spectrotype of <b>antibodies</b> to <b>DNA</b> were found in sera containing anti-idiotypic antibodies, suggesting suppression of clones producing antibodies with isoelectric points {{similar to that of}} the immunizing idiotype. Deletions of some of the anti-idiotypic antibodies also occurred as the mice aged. Rheumatoid factors were not detectable in any sera. Therefore, administration of an <b>antibody</b> to <b>DNA</b> bearing an idiotype occurring with high frequency in NZB/NZW f 1 females resulted in relatively specific suppression of the <b>antibody</b> response to <b>double-stranded</b> <b>DNA,</b> as well as suppression of nephritis. Reduction of anti-DNA synthesis by anti-idiotypic antibodies may have been an important suppressive mechanism. Experiments are in progress to test this hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{freshwater}} budding eubacterium Gemmata obscuriglobus {{possesses a}} DNA-containing nuclear region that is bounded by two nuclear membranes. The membrane-bounded {{nature of the}} nucleoid in this bacterium was shown by thin sectioning of chemically fixed cells, thin sectioning of freeze-substituted cells, and freeze-fracture/freeze-etch. The fibrillar nucleoid was surrounded by electron-dense granules that were in turn enveloped by two nuclear membranes separated by an electron-transparent space. Immunogold labeling of thin sections of conventionally fixed cells with anti-double-stranded <b>DNA</b> <b>antibody</b> demonstrated <b>double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> associated with fibrillar material within the membrane boundary. The occurrence of a membrane-bounded nucleoid in a eubacterial prokaryote is a significant exception to the evidence supporting the prokaryote/eukaryote dichotomous classification of cell structure...|$|R

40|$|Ribosome-inactivating {{proteins}} (RIPs) are N-glycosylases that {{remove a}} specific adenine from the sarcin/ricin loop {{of the large}} rRNA in a manner analogous to N-glycosylases {{that are involved in}} DNA repair. Some RIPs have been reported to remove adenines from single-stranded <b>DNA</b> and cleave <b>double-stranded</b> supercoiled <b>DNA.</b> The molecular basis for the activity of RIPs on <b>double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> is not known. Pokeweed antiviral protein (PAP), a single-chain RIP from Phytolacca americana, cleaves supercoiled DNA into relaxed and linear forms. <b>Double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> treated with PAP contains apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites due to the removal of adenine. Using an active-site mutant of PAP (PAPx) which does not depurinate rRNA, we present evidence that <b>double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> treated with PAPx does not contain AP sites and is not cleaved. These results demonstrate {{for the first time that}} PAP cleaves supercoiled <b>double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> using the same active site that is required for depurination of rRNA...|$|R
