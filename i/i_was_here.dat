500|$|Fey was {{an extra}} in a 1998 episode, and after {{watching}} herself, decided to diet and lost 30pounds. She told The New York Times, [...] "I {{was a completely}} normal weight, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>here</b> in New York City, I had money and I couldn't buy any clothes. After I lost weight, there was interest in putting me on camera." [...] In 1999, McKay stepped down as head writer, which led Michaels to approach Fey for the position. She became SNLs first female head writer.|$|E
500|$|Gordimer remarked that, {{more than}} just a story about white communists in South Africa, Burger's Daughter is about [...] "commitment" [...] and what she as a writer does to [...] "make sense of life". After Mandela and Fischer were sentenced in the mid-1960s, Gordimer {{considered}} going into exile, but she changed her mind and later recalled [...] "I wouldn't be accepted as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>here,</b> even in the worst times and even though I'm white". Just as Rosa struggles to find her place as a white in the anti-apartheid liberation movement, so did Gordimer. In an interview in 1980, she said that [...] "when we have got beyond the apartheid situation—there's a tremendous problem for whites, unless whites are allowed in by blacks, and unless we can make out a case for our being accepted and we can forge a common culture together, whites are going to be marginal".|$|E
500|$|Oppong's {{performances}} {{helped him}} get an NCAA scholarship into Eastern Kentucky. Idaho, Utah State, Colorado State, and Murray State were some of his other potential Division I destinations. He {{was considered one of}} the top Canadians committing to an NCAA program that year, in a list headlined by Andrew Nicholson and Kris Joseph. As soon as he arrived at EKU, he became close with the school. Oppong said, [...] "From the first day, I was accepted, as soon as I stepped on campus. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>here</b> in the summertime and there were a few guys here who I knew and as soon as we came in August, I felt like I was part of the family." [...] Head coach Jeff Neubauer commented on him, [...] "We think Papa Oppong will be a tough match-up for our opponents because he is a shooter, rebounder and slasher." ...|$|E

500|$|... "I Was Here" [...] {{begins with}} quivering reverb and a plaintively plucked guitar setting a somber mood for about fifteen {{seconds before the}} beats begin {{alongside}} Beyoncé's voice. Her vocals set a hushed and morbid tone on the song as she bring doses of edge and grit, singing: [...] "I wanna leave my footprints on the sands of time / Know {{there was something that}} meant something that I left behind / When I leave this world, I'll leave no regrets / I'll leave something to remember, So they won't forget". She further sings throughout the song, [...] "The hearts I have touched will be the proof that I leaved that I made a difference". Watery synths shimmer in the background before Beyoncé adopts an authoritative tone to chant the chorus lines: [...] "I was here / I lived, I loved / <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>here</b> / I did, I've done / Everything that I wanted / And it was more than I thought it would be / I will leave my mark so everyone will know / I was here".|$|E
500|$|Strickland {{was born}} in Blackshear, Georgia to Susan Strickland, a nurse, and Dee Strickland, a high school {{football}} coach, principal and superintendent. KaDee's birthname is Katherine Dee; her parents combined the K in Katherine with her father's name to make KaDee. She was raised in Patterson, Georgia, which she said is a [...] "one-stoplight town", {{and she had a}} job picking tobacco on a local farm for eight years. When she was a child, Strickland watched the Woody Allen film Annie Hall (1975) and was, as she put it, [...] "wanting to be in that place, and being completely taken with the energy of those people. I wanted to be in it". During her childhood, she was well known locally {{as a member of the}} Strickland family and for her extracurricular activities and achievements (she was the Homecoming Queen in elementary, middle and high school, the student council president and a cheerleader). She never considered a career in the performing arts until her participation in a one-act play performed by students of her high school: [...] " [...] the minute I set foot on stage, that was it. Destiny took over. There were no other options. I felt like I fit my skin, I knew what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>here</b> to do", Strickland said.|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "New Wave" [...] did {{not meet}} with {{universal}} approval among those who were regarded as part of it. [...] Brian Aldiss, for example, wrote to Judith Merril in 1966 that he suspected the term was [...] "a journalistic invention of yours and Mike Moorcock's", and added [...] "I feel I am {{no part of the}} New Wave; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>here</b> before 'em, and by God I mean to be here after they've gone (still writing bloody science fiction)!" [...] Merril was a key advocate for the New Wave, and popularized it in her anthology England Swings SF, which appeared in 1968; she spent almost a year in London, living near Moorcock, when researching the anthology in 1966–1967. [...] Merril and writer Christopher Priest were among those who used the term [...] "New Wave" [...] to describe the work being done in New Worlds, but Aldiss was not the only writer to object to the term, and it never received a generally accepted definition. [...] Critic Brian Attebery characterizes it as a [...] "disruptive, existentially fraught and formally daring" [...] style; Peter Nicholls hesitates to define it but comments that [...] "perhaps the fundamental element was the belief that sf could and should be taken seriously as literature". [...] In a 1967 interview, Ballard, one of the writers most closely associated with the New Wave, described modern U.S. sf as extrovert and optimistic, and contrasted it with [...] "the new science fiction, that other people apart from myself are now beginning to write", which he saw as [...] "introverted, possibly pessimistic rather than optimistic, much less certain of its own territory." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1955 Larkin became University Librarian at the University of Hull, a post he held {{until his}} death. Professor R.L. Brett, who was {{chairman}} of the library committee that appointed him and a friend, wrote, [...] "At first I was impressed with the time he spent in his office, arriving early and leaving late. It was only later that I realised that his office was also his study where he spent hours on his private writing as well as the work of the library. Then he would return home and on a good many evenings start writing again." [...] For his first year he lodged in bedsits. In 1956, at the age of 34, he rented a self-contained flat on the top-floor of 32 Pearson Park, a three-storey red-brick house overlooking the park, previously the American Consulate. This, it seems, was the vantage point later commemorated in the poem High Windows. Of the city itself Larkin commented: [...] "I never thought about Hull until <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>here.</b> Having got here, it suits me in many ways. It is a little on the edge of things, I think even its natives would say that. I rather like being on the edge of things. One doesn't really go anywhere by design, you know, you put in for jobs and move about, you know, I've lived in other places." [...] In the post-war years, Hull University underwent significant expansion, as was typical of British universities during that period. When Larkin took up his appointment there, the plans for a new university library were already far advanced. He made a great effort in just a few months to familiarize himself with them before they were placed before the University Grants Committee; he suggested a number of emendations, some major and structural, all of which were adopted. It was built in two stages, and in 1967 it was named the Brynmor Jones Library after Sir Brynmor Jones, the university's vice-chancellor.|$|E
500|$|Steve Jones of USA Today showed {{appreciation}} for [...] "I Was Here": [...] "At 29, the still-in-her-prime Beyoncé {{seems a little}} young to be worrying about her legacy, as she does on the Warren power ballad <b>I</b> <b>Was</b> <b>Here.</b> But she puts so much feeling into it that it winds up being the album's most moving song." [...] Joanne Dorken of MTV UK was also positive, praising the song's [...] "simple backing music, and Beyoncé's flawless and beautiful voice." [...] She concluded that [...] "I Was Here" [...] ends up being a [...] "standout song on the album [...] we won't be forgetting Queen B in a hurry." [...] Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic was also positive, writing, [...] "Payoff comes on 11th song, the epically loping 'I Was Here.' Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun commented that [...] "I Was Here" [...] comes to [...] "a show-stopping moment in a Beyonce concert near you". James Reed of The Boston Globe wrote that the collaboration of Diane Warren and Ryan Tedder, introduces [...] "a new strain of her balladry: an ethereal marriage of R sensuality and stuttering indie-rock guitars." [...] Condar Tao of the website Sputnikmusic showed his {{appreciation for}} the song, writing, [...] " [...] perhaps even more notable is the record's penultimate track, the Ryan Tedder-produced 'I Was Here'. Tedder is arguably {{one of the most}} irritating people working in pop today, and considering his track record, it's not a surprise that 'I Was Here' is the most contemporary-sounding song off of 4. What is surprising is just how good it is. The production is predictably icky, making that increasingly common mistake of using distant footsteps and reverbed guitar to convey a clichéd sense of 'epicness'." [...] Gary Graff of Billboard said that the line [...] "I want to leave my footprints on the sands of time" [...] in the song defined the whole album. Simon Goddard of Q magazine chose [...] "I Was Here" [...] {{as one of the best}} songs on 4, describing it as a [...] "breast-clutching tour de fource".|$|E

2500|$|Shortly after {{arriving}} in Toronto, Coleman met with club president, Peter Bavasi. [...] Despite having rejected Finley's bid to reacquire Coleman, Bavasi informed Coleman {{that he did not}} fit into the Blue Jays' plans. [...] Coleman recalled, [...] "It was a shock to me. [...] I didn't know why <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>here.</b> [...] He didn't want to get into a contract situation with me that would take up a spot of one of the younger kids."

In fact, it's actually more dangerous now with the IED threat.". Kemp described how the Taliban had now apparently taken to engaging from a distance, and planting IEDs and mines in areas where troops are likely to take cover, such as in ditches, switching from conventional tactics to a greater use of booby traps and suicide bombers.|$|E
2500|$|When Figo {{returned}} to Barcelona {{for the first}} time in a Real Madrid shirt on 21 October 2000, the noise at Camp Nou was deafening. There were banners hung around the stadium with words like [...] "Traitor", [...] "Judas", [...] "Scum", and [...] "Mercenary". Figo was mercilessly taunted throughout, and when he came out of the tunnel and ran onto the field the jeers of almost 98,000 Barcelona fans escalated, with a visibly shocked Figo putting his fingers to his ears. When El Clásico started, each time Figo got the ball the noise rose with insults and missiles flying such as oranges, bottles, cigarette lighters and mobile phones. The regular corner taker for Madrid, Figo did not take any corners at the Camp Nou to avoid being in close proximity to the fans. Barcelona were victorious, winning 2–0, and Real Madrid President Florentino Pérez stated after the match, [...] "The atmosphere got to us all." [...] Madrid defender Iván Campo commented, [...] "That night when Figo first went back was incredible. I’ve never heard anything like it. Luís didn't deserve that. He'd given his all for Barcelona. It was built up before: 'a traitor’s coming,' the media said. No, Luís Figo is coming, one of the greats for you. That night hurt him, you could see.
