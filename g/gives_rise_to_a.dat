5|$|Earlier than Stifel, the 8th century Jain {{mathematician}} Virasena {{is credited}} with a precursor to the binary logarithm. Virasena's concept of ardhacheda {{has been defined as}} the number of times a given number can be divided evenly by two. This definition <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> function that coincides with the binary logarithm on the powers of two, but it is different for other integers, giving the 2-adic order rather than the logarithm.|$|E
5|$|The sperm whale's unique body is {{unlikely}} to be confused with any other species. The sperm whale's distinctive shape comes from its very large, block-shaped head, which can be one-quarter to one-third of the animal's length. The S-shaped blowhole is located very close {{to the front of the}} head and shifted to the whale's left. This <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> distinctive bushy, forward-angled spray.|$|E
5|$|Anatomically, {{the human}} {{cerebellum}} has {{the appearance of}} a separate structure attached {{to the bottom of the}} brain, tucked underneath the cerebral hemispheres. Its cortical surface is covered with finely spaced parallel grooves, in striking contrast to the broad irregular convolutions of the cerebral cortex. These parallel grooves conceal the fact that the cerebellar cortex is actually a continuous thin layer of tissue tightly folded in the style of an accordion. Within this thin layer are several types of neurons with a highly regular arrangement, the most important being Purkinje cells and granule cells. This complex neural organization <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> massive signal-processing capability, but almost all of the output from the cerebellar cortex passes through a set of small deep nuclei lying in the white matter interior of the cerebellum.|$|E

5|$|Logarithms {{have many}} {{applications}} {{inside and outside}} mathematics. Some of these occurrences {{are related to the}} notion of scale invariance. For example, each chamber of the shell of a nautilus is an approximate copy of the next one, scaled by a constant factor. This <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> logarithmic spiral. Benford's law on the distribution of leading digits can also be explained by scale invariance. Logarithms are also linked to self-similarity. For example, logarithms appear in the analysis of algorithms that solve a problem by dividing it into two similar smaller problems and patching their solutions. The dimensions of self-similar geometric shapes, that is, shapes whose parts resemble the overall picture are also based on logarithms.|$|E
