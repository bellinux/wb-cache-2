40|$|Background: Cost-efficient {{saccharification}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} bottlenecks for <b>industrial</b> lignocellulose <b>conversion.</b> Clostridium thermocellum naturally degrades lignocellulose efficiently using the cellulosome, a multiprotein supermolecular complex, and thus can be potentially used as a low-cost catalyst for lignocellulose saccharification. The industrial use of C. thermocellum is restrained due largely to the inhibition of the hydrolysate cellobiose to its cellulosome. Although the supplementation of beta-glucosidase may solve the problem, the production of the enzymes greatly complicates the process and may also increase the cost of saccharification...|$|R

40|$|The <b>conversion</b> {{of inner-city}} <b>industrial</b> land to new residential, commercial, and mixed-use {{developments}} {{has become a}} recommended planning strategy, to promote the compact urban from associated with inner-city intensification. Yet these conversion projects often fail to consider the byproducts of years of industrial production without environmental control, which remain as contaminated soil in these abandoned sites. This thesis research puts forth three major findings which deal with this environmental planning issue. First of all, {{it was discovered that}} environmental factors receive minimal consideration in the provincially-established inner-city <b>industrial</b> land <b>conversion</b> process. Secondly, it was discovered that the minimal treatment given to inner-city <b>industrial</b> land <b>conversion</b> issues by the provincial government has resulted in the need for municipal governments in Ontario to develop individual regulations to plan for this conversion process. Finally, it was discovered that there exist a number of 2 ̆ 2 typical 2 ̆ 2 municipal additions to the provincially-established conversion process, which encourage environmental planning at the municipal level. While this last finding refutes the conclusions of previous studies which have suggested that municipal environmental planning is a highly individualized process, this 2 ̆ 2 typical 2 ̆ 2 conversion process remains highly reactive in nature, therefore highlighting the need for increased proactive legislation to plan for the environmental issues surrounding this inner-city intensification strategy.
