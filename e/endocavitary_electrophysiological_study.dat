40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{investigate}} {{the feasibility of}} performing <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>studies</b> at a district general hospital and to evaluate the importance of such studies {{in the management of}} patients with suspected arrhythmias. DESIGN [...] Retrospective study of patients having had <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>studies</b> during a three year period. SETTING [...] District general hospital. SUBJECTS [...] 93 patients (50 men, 43 women, mean age 45. 9 years) with suspected arrhythmias. RESULTS [...] The patients were divided into two groups according to symptoms. Group 1 (34 patients) presented with syncope. Group 2 (59 patients) presented with palpitation. All had previously undergone non-invasive investigations. All had had multiple hospital admissions and outpatient attendances. In group 1 nine patients with no documented arrhythmias had inducible ventricular tachycardia and three of six with suspected bradyarrhythmias had ventricular tachycardia. Fourteen patients had suspected ventricular arrhythmias before <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>studies,</b> which were confirmed in all, four receiving automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillators. <b>Electrophysiological</b> <b>studies</b> were used to guide drug treatment in all patients. Group 2 consisted of 32 patients with reentrant supraventricular tachycardia and 15 with ventricular tachycardia; 12 had no documented arrhythmias. In those with supraventricular tachycardia, accessory pathways were identified in all. In 23 patients drug treatment (guided by <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>studies)</b> was successful. In nine, drug treatment guided by <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>studies</b> were ineffective and radiofrequency ablation was successful. In 15 patients with ventricular tachycardia and palpitations, 10 had their drugs changed after <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>studies</b> and their ventricular tachycardia was suppressed. In five patients <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>studies</b> showed that ventricular tachycardia was unsuppressed and they were referred for an operation or implantation of an automatic cardioverter defibrillator. In 12 patients with no documented arrhythmias <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>studies</b> identified significant arrhythmias in six. There were no complications. CONCLUSIONS [...] Diagnostic <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>studies</b> can safely and effectively be performed in a district general hospital. These studies are especially effective in investigating patients with syncope, and also provide a strategy for future arrhythmia management...|$|R

They are known to detect tachyarrhythmias but have not been shown to add to the diagnostic yield of electrophysiological testing in symptomatic patients. METHODS: We prospectively studied the first 41 patients (aged 48 +/- 19 years) in whom ILR were used at our institution after negative <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>studies</b> (EPS). All patients were symptomatic with palpitations (11), syncope (22) or both (8). Nine patients had known structural heart disease (two ischaemic, four cardiomyopathy, two valvular and one congenital). Patients were assessed according to demographic factors, symptoms and investigations. Loop recordings were analysed and assessed according to conventional criteria. RESULTS: Among 41 patients in whom <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>studies</b> had failed to demonstrate arrhythmias, six were found to have clinically significant tachyarrhythmias (four ventricular and two supraventricular).

DESIGN [...] An invasive <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>study</b> was performed in the basal state and after the infusion of disopyramide (2 mg/kg body weight). The progression to high degree atrioventricular block was assessed by bradycardia-detecting pacemakers or repeated 12 -lead electrocardiogram recordings, or both. PATIENTS [...] 73 patients with bifascicular block were included, of whom 25 had a history of unexplained syncope. The remaining 48 patients had no arrhythmia related symptoms and were included as controls. All patients had an ejection fraction of > 35 %. RESULTS [...] After a mean follow up of 23 months, seven patients in the syncope group and three in the non-syncope group had a documented high degree atrioventricular block or pacemaker-detected bradycardia of or = 6 s.

40|$|Background: Although <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>study</b> {{is often}} {{performed}} in Brugada syndrome (BrS) to assess inducibility of ventricular arrhythmias (VA), {{the utility of}} <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>study</b> in early repolarization syndrome (ERS) remains unknown. The aim of the present multi-center observational study was to compare inducibility of VA in ERS with BrS, and to investigate any association between inducibility and recurrence of arrhythmic events in these patients. Methods: The J-PREVENT registry consists of patients with early repolarization or Brugada type 1 ECGs, a history of prior cardiac events, and no structural heart disease. Patients in the registry with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) and who underwent <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>study</b> were enrolled. VA inducibility was assessed by programmed electrical stimulation performed at two different sites in the right ventricle with up to three extrastimuli. The occurrence of VA during follow-up was determined by interrogation of the patients׳ ICDs. Results: Of the 79 patients studied (72 males, mean age 44 ± 13 years), 21 patients (27 %) had ERS, and 58 had BrS, 20 of whom also had early repolarization in the inferolateral leads. VA was induced in 9 patients (43 %) and 45 (78 %) with ERS and BrS, respectively (p= 0. 006). During a median follow-up of 1453 days, occurrence rate of VA was similar between ERS and BrS (p= 0. 35).

Conclusions: In patients with ERS with prior history of cardiac events, VA was induced in 43 % of patients during <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>study,</b> approximately half that of BrS.

At echocardiography specific {{attention was paid to}} the right ventricular chamber size. Two groups were identified at echocardiographic study. In group 1, nine patients had normal left ventricular dimensions and relatively normal features at <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>study.</b> Mean right ventricular ejection fraction was 0. 45 by krypton- 81 measurement. Group 2 comprised eight patients who had dilatation of right ventricular inflow tract, outflow tract, and right ventricular body.

40|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} {{the most common cause of}} death in the high {{developed}} industrial states. About 44 % of all cases of death in Germany can be put down to cardiovascular disease. Crucial cause for the still high mortality is sudden death caused by cardiac arrhythmia. The <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>study</b> can be useful in evaluating many cardiac arrhythmias. Complex cardiac arrhythmias can be localised and their origin and the progression of excitation can be analysed specifically. The type, number and inducibility of arrhythmias due to the programmed electrical stimulation or due to medical provocation (e. g. because of catecholamine) forms an important basis in the research of cardiac arrhythmias, too. The <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>study</b> also serves the risk evaluation of malignant arrhythmias of patients with congenital heart disease. The principle of every <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>study</b> is based on two fundamental techniques: 1. excitation admission from and 2. electrical stimulation in localised areas of the heart. The respective stages of conduction of the heart (e. g. sinus node, atrioventricular node and the various areas in the ventricle) are tested. At manifestation of a particular cardiac arrhythmia type and mechanism of the arrhythmia are collected. Additionally it is examined, how the cardiac arrhythmia can be stopped. Aim of establishing the human <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>study</b> in the laboratory animal sector (part 1 of the experiment) has been the research of certain pathomechanisms by measuring physiological parameters of the conduction system of the heart to also apply the <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>study</b> in cardiac research with small laboratory animals where it can not only be used to investigate and discover pathomechanisms at the heart but can also be useful for choosing the adequate treatment after examining and detecting anti- or pro-arrhythmic effects. It has been shown that the human <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>study</b> in a mildly modified version can be applied to mouse and rat and a reliable application is possible. Therefore the conduction system of the heart can now also be examined under the influence or under the missing influence of certain cells, genes or substances, which can serve the clarification of pathophysiological mechanisms in the development of clinical cardiac arrhythmias as well as be useful in clarifying the mode of action of new anti-arrhythmia agents and in examining their effectiveness. The aim of the second part of the experiment was the application of the intracardial <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>study,</b> as established in part 1 of the experiment, to the hypertrophic, for renin and angiotensin double transgenic heart of the rat (dTGR) with the purpose to describe the proneness of a hypertrophic myocardium to arrhythmia for certain and to show possible positive effects of the renin inhibitor aliskiren or cardioprotective influences of the omega- 3 fatty acids (Ω 3 -polyunsaturated fatty acids; Ω 3 -PUFA) eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. With the help of the <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>study</b> it could be shown in vivo that Ω 3 -PUFA and aliskiren reduce the inducibility of cardiac arrhythmia significantly. In different groups of laboratory animals (wild type Sparague Dawley as controll group, untreated dTGR, dTGR with aliskiren and dTGR with Ω 3 -PUFA) the electrophysiological data was collected and the inducibility of arrhythmias was tested for every animal. Untreated dTGRs develop a cardiac hypertrophy during their first weeks of life because of an overexpression of renin and angiotensin. Surface ECG of those animals showed a prolonged QRS- and QTpeak-interval and a widened T wave. These electrocardiographic changes were neither seen in the dTGR group with Ω 3 -PUFA nor in the dTGR group with aliskiren. The <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>study</b> showed a greatly reduced inducibility of arrhythmias of 17 % in both treated dTGR groups compared to an inducibility of 75 % in the untreated dTGR group. In the control group the inducibility of arrhythmias was 0 %. The groups also showed differences is type and number of inducable arrhythmias. The untreated dTGR group showed an increased inducibility of malignant arrhythmias such as tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, whereas in the dTGR groups treated with Ω 3 -PUFA or aliskiren only benigne arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation and occasionally ventricular extrasystoles could be induced. Thus, with the help of the human <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>study</b> the cardioprotective effect of Ω 3 -PUFA regarding the inducibility of cardiac arrhythmias could be demonstrated. It could be shown that the human <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>study</b> can be applied to the laboratory animal sector and is applicable as method to evaluate electrophysiological characteristics of the heart as well as brady- and tachycardic arrhythmias...|$|R
