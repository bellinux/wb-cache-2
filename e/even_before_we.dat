He left {{his wife and}} child behind him in Khotan, Liu Darin making himself answerable for their maintenance. But I also paid Fong Shi three months' salary in advance, and that money he gave to his wife. Whenever I could find leisure he was to give me lessons in Chinese, and we began at once, <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> left Khotan...........|$|E
500|$|On August 5, 2011, Guillermo del Toro {{stated that}} the remake would reflect his {{original}} vision for the film, {{and that it had}} been planned even when the first version was in production. [...] "Even when we produced the Spanish movie, I had intended to remake it because we had a very different screenplay that, because of money and time, got turned into the movie you saw – which is great, but there was this other structure for the original script that I wanted to try. So <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> shot the first film it was an economic decision, a pre-existing creative decision, to change it." [...] Del Toro also praised the new film's director. [...] "We have Mark Pellington attached as director – I'm a big fan of his The Mothman Prophecies and his video work – and we are out to actors, so we're hoping to get things going soon." [...] On August 30, 2011, it was reported that American actress Amy Adams was in talks to star as Laura, the main character, who was played by Belén Rueda in the original film. It was also {{stated that the}} current incarnation of the remake screenplay had been written by Larry Fessenden and Sergio G. Sánchez, the sole writer of the original film.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1985, Slash {{was asked}} by Axl Rose and Izzy Stradlin to join the newly founded GunsN'Roses, along with Duff McKagan and Steven Adler; {{completing}} the line-up. They played nightclubssuch as the Whisky a Go Go, The Roxy, and The Troubadourand opened for larger acts throughout 1985 and 1986. It was during this period that the band wrote most of its classic material, including [...] "Welcome to the Jungle," [...] "Sweet Child o' Mine,", and [...] "Paradise City," [...] As {{a result of their}} rowdy and rebellious behavior, Guns N' Roses quickly received the moniker [...] "Most Dangerous Band in the World," [...] causing Slash to remark, [...] "For some strange reason, Guns N' Roses is like the catalyst for controversy, <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> had any kind of record deal." [...] After being scouted by several major record labels, the band signed with Geffen Records in March 1986. Later that year, they began recording their debut album, but initially nothing was accomplished as Slash had developed a drug problem.|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{have been}} here for days and days. There are {{hundreds}} of us about the rocks. How was it you did not see us, or hear us when we sing and romp every <b>evening</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> go home?" ...|$|R

2500|$|Upon GOD's announcement, Alex Seropian, {{co-founder of}} Bungie, {{expressed}} confidence in MumboJumbo's {{ability to create}} a worthy successor to the original games, stating [...] "MumboJumbo has a real appreciation for what made the first two Myth games great. We're confident that their knowledge and experience will make Myth III a title that satisfies existing Myth fans and brings legions of new gamers into the fold." [...] Also addressing the issue of remaining faithful to the two previous games whilst still introducing new elements to the franchise, MumboJumbo president Mark Dochtermann explained the idea with The Wolf Age was not to reinvent the series' basic gameplay, which the developers felt was still capable of supporting a unique title. However, at the same time, they were also keen to try out new things; [...] "There's a lot left to explore in the Myth franchise <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> go in a somewhat different route. Although, we are taking a [...] route in terms of adding 3D acceleration, 3D models, and doing stuff with the terrain engine and physics that are still way beyond what the other RTS games are doing right now." [...] Similarly, producer and lead designer Scott Campbell stated ...|$|E

[...] Similarly, producer and lead designer Scott Campbell stated [...] "We intend to pay respect to Myth and its fans. We don't care to change the whole appeal of the game just so we can call it ours." [...] With this in mind, MumboJumbo hired three members of Soulblighters modding community to work on the game. Although initially hired to work on technical aspects, they became invaluable to MumboJumbo in terms of writing the storyline. Executive producer Mike Donges explains, [...] "they're our Myth lore experts, so if we try to put in something new, they have the ability to [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{regards to}} the album's roster of artists, Sara Baumberger wrote that the {{selected}} songs were paired effectively well. Spin's Mikael Wood praised Andrew Bird's rendition of [...] "Bein' Green" [...] remarking, [...] "Andrew Bird sidesteps the precious self-pity you'd expect from [...] "Bein' Green": His Kermit gets the clever-to-cuddly ratio just right." [...] Web Behrens of Time Out Chicago spoke highly of OK Go's cover; [...] "Layering in everything from electronica to a perfectly quirky [...] "Flight of the Bumblebees" [...] sample, the homegrown band knows just how to push the envelope. We loved it <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> saw the video, which {{is sure to be}} another viral hit for Kulash and Company, taking their trippy cover to an even higher level." [...] Peter Chianca of Wicked Local, wrote in regards to Weezer and Hayley Williams' cover; [...] "complete with twittering swamp sounds, approximates the wistfulness that the late Jim Henson brought to the original." [...] Chianca also noted that, [...] "Alkaline Trio's punky take on [...] "Movin' Right Along" [...] is the album's standout, riffing playfully on the Kermit-and-Fozzie banter." [...] John Terauds of the Toronto Star commended the album as a whole, highlighting that, [...] "The finest treats come from two of the gentlest and most memorable melodies brought to us by Kermit the Frog: [...] "Rainbow Connection", where Hayley Williams of Paramore sweetly recaptures the original's innocent wonder and longing, boosted by Weezer's pastel-swampy backdrop; and Andrew Bird's clean, frank delivery of [...] "Bein' Green"." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Master Chambers," [...] Geoffrey said, [...] "we {{have got}} two boiled pullets in our basket. Had we not better have them for dinner? They were cooked the <b>evening</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> came away, and I should {{think they had}} better be eaten now." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{was five}} in the <b>evening</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> woke again. Frank {{stretched}} himself with a yawn. [...] "I don't know how you feel, Tom," [...] he cried as he jumped out of bed, [...] "but I feel as if that extinct instrument, the rack, had been invented over again for my special benefit. There's not a bone in my body that isn't aching." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Our present journey {{has been}} an {{exceptionally}} adventurous one," [...] Mr Harvey said, [...] "and you must not suppose that we are often {{in the habit of}} fighting our way. I have indeed on several occasions been in very perilous positions, and some other <b>evening,</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> separate, I shall be glad, if it will interest you, to relate one or two of them." ...|$|R
60|$|So it {{was known}} <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> went to hear the {{financial}} report {{that there would be}} no question of profits on the Kermesse going to the Armenians or the Russians.|$|E
6000|$|... "We went our several ways," [...] said Lady Dedlock, [...] "and {{had little}} in common <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> agreed to differ. It is to be regretted, I suppose, but {{it could not be}} helped." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was well}} I {{had not been}} looked upon {{as the leader of}} our little company, {{otherwise}} we might have come to grief <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> had well made a start toward arming ourselves against the possible treachery of Master Lord.|$|E
6000|$|Let me {{confess that}} {{through all this}} time <b>before</b> <b>we</b> started I was immensely self-conscious, and that Beatrice played the part of {{audience}} in my imagination throughout. I was, as I say, [...] "saving the situation," [...] and I was acutely aware of that. The <b>evening</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> sailed, instead of revising our medicine-chest as I had intended, I took the car and ran across country to Lady Grove to tell my aunt of the journey I was making, dress, and astonish Lady Osprey by an after dinner call.|$|R
6000|$|... "My lord," [...] {{then said}} the worthy citizen, [...] "we have had our {{permitted}} hour of honest and hospitable pastime, and now I would fain delay you for another and graver purpose, {{as it is}} our custom, {{when we have the}} benefit of good Mr. Windsor's company, that he reads the prayers of the church for the <b>evening</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> separate. Your excellent father, my lord, would not have departed before family worship--I hope the same from your lordship." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Even</b> then, <b>before</b> <b>we</b> {{so much as}} {{heard his}} step at the door, my master entered, and there stood we, my arm about her neck and hers about my body, {{embracing}} me.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{must pay}} our way <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> must be respectable," [...] replied her mother. [...] "Mr. Henchard {{is too high}} {{for us to make}} {{ourselves}} known to him, I much fear; so we've only our own pockets to depend on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are such spectres {{frequent}} in the woods, Heyward; {{or is this}} sight an especial entertainment on our behalf? If the latter, gratitude must close our mouths; but if the former, both Cora and I {{shall have}} need to draw largely on that stock of hereditary courage which we boast, <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> are made to encounter the redoubtable Montcalm." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, ay, if {{we could}} put it on them, it would do well enough; but my honest old father always maintained, that every man must stand in the gap left by his own sins; though he did assert, also, {{that we were all}} fore-ordained to shape our courses {{starboard}} or port, <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> were launched." ...|$|E
60|$|It was <b>evening</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> {{reached the}} little town of Tavistock, which lies, like the boss of a shield, {{in the middle of the}} huge circle of Dartmoor. Two gentlemen were {{awaiting}} us in the station--the one a tall, fair man with lion-like hair and beard and curiously penetrating light blue eyes; the other a small, alert person, very neat and dapper, in a frock-coat and gaiters, with trim little side-whiskers and an eye-glass. The latter was Colonel Ross, the well-known sportsman; the other, Inspector Gregory, a man who was rapidly making his name in the English detective service.|$|R
60|$|<b>Before</b> <b>evening,</b> <b>we</b> had a {{visit from}} Inspector Stanley Hopkins. Things were not going very well with him.|$|R
6000|$|But {{now that}} I {{was getting to}} be a young woman and had put up my hair, and the future frowned near, this {{domestic}} problem began seriously to concern him. My mother paled at the very mention of it. I remember I had climbed up on to his writing desk one morning, in search of a pair of high boots which I had taken off in his study the <b>evening</b> <b>before.</b> <b>We</b> had been fishing for sticklebacks. Concealed from view, while the wind whined at the window, I heard a quarrel between my father and mother about me which I will never repeat to mortal ear. It darkened my mind for days, and if ... but better not.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} {{concluded}} relating my plans, and your provoking wit annoys me! The vessel I have taken will unquestionably {{come into the}} land, as the gale dies; and I intend making my escape in her, after beating this Englishman, and securing the liberty of Miss Howard and yourself. I could see the frigate in the offing, <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> left the cliffs." ...|$|E
60|$|There was {{a slight}} bend in the coast, and I steered so as to put it between us; <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> landed we had thus {{lost sight of the}} gigs. I jumped out and came as near running as I durst, with a big silk {{handkerchief}} under my hat for coolness' sake and a brace of pistols ready primed for safety.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then you'll {{certainly}} be sorry," [...] some one else broke in. [...] "We've had about enough trouble {{right along with}} you and we've come to hand in the bill. You headed us off a good trade, you brought the revenue folks in, and we mean to get <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> leave. Just now we'll be satisfied with your homestead, but that won't be enough after the next shot's fired." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes!--that is, no--I do not know--but I {{believe he}} has read a good deal--but not what you would think any thing of. He reads the Agricultural Reports, and some other books that lay {{in one of the}} window seats--but he reads all them to himself. But {{sometimes}} of an <b>evening,</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> went to cards, he would read something aloud out of the Elegant Extracts, very entertaining. And I know he has read the Vicar of Wakefield. He never read the Romance of the Forest, nor The Children of the Abbey. He had never heard of such books before I mentioned them, but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{feel how}} deeply indebted we are, for our good fortune, to your kindness, your grace," [...] Charlie said. [...] "We know that, but for you, months might have elapsed, <b>even</b> years, <b>before</b> <b>we</b> could have {{obtained}} such a result, even {{after we had}} the confession of Nicholson in our hands." ...|$|R
60|$|To {{return to}} the ship. The wind dying away, <b>evening</b> came on <b>before</b> <b>we</b> drew near the island. But we had it in view during the whole afternoon.|$|R
6000|$|... "Somebody will {{smart for}} bein' so careless!" [...] he cried. [...] "Joshua Barney ain't {{the man to}} {{overlook}} anythin' of that kind. Do you allow there may be traitors in the fleet? It looks mightily like it when a coward like Macomber can give 'em the slip inside of twelve hours, for if he was seen in this town at sunset, {{he must have been}} at liberty by noon, ay, <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> got under way!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Minnie {{looked at}} him with disgust, and shivered as she {{snatched}} one of her hands from his grasp. [...] "It was very good of your sister, Ralph," [...] she said, [...] "and I knew you would forgive me for borrowing the horse; he is there in the stable, and Tetley will find Tom another. It was an awful journey, <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> reached Fairmead, where I hid him {{in the bottom of the}} sleigh; and they brought me in here almost frozen stiff." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{offer was}} hinted at {{to go with}} Valetta <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> knew it was {{declined}} at Clipstone, {{and that made me}} anxious to know whether it would be well for me to send Vera. I suppose she would pick up pronunciation of languages, which would be a great advantage, as she will have to earn her own living, and Mrs. White is so good as to promise lessons in arts and music. I hear, too, it is quite an English colony, with a church and schools." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Therefore, gentlemen, may I ask you {{to start}} homeward, at once. The horses have only done a few miles and, if we press forward, we may manage to get to our camp of the <b>evening</b> <b>before</b> last. <b>We</b> have no more to do here, except {{to see if there}} are any {{valuables}} hidden in the huts, and set fire to them.|$|R
6000|$|... "We shall meet at your cousin's in the <b>evening.</b> <b>Before</b> that time, <b>we</b> {{had better}} both think over whether {{we ought to}} tell anyone our suspicions, and we can hold a council in the gondola on the way back." ...|$|R
60|$|Not {{till the}} last <b>evening</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> reached Bombay did I really {{understand}} the nature of my neighbour's project. That evening, as it chanced, Elsie had a headache and went below early. I stopped with her till she dozed off; then I slipped up on deck once more for a breath of fresh air, before retiring for the night to the hot and stuffy cabin. It was an exquisite evening. The moon rode in the pale green sky of the tropics. A strange light still lingered on the western horizon. The stifling heat of the Red Sea had given way long since to the refreshing coolness of the Indian Ocean. I strolled a while on the quarter-deck, and sat down at last near the stern. Next moment, I was aware of somebody creeping up to me.|$|R
