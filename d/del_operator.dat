25|$|One of the {{features}} of Hamilton's quaternion system was the differential operator del which could be used to express the gradient of a vector field or to express the curl. These operations were applied by Clerk Maxwell to the electrical and magnetic studies of Michael Faraday in Maxwell's Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism (1873). Though the <b>del</b> <b>operator</b> continues to be used, the real quaternions fall short as a representation of spacetime. On the other hand, the biquaternion algebra, in the hands of Arthur W. Conway and Ludwik Silberstein, provided representational tools for Minkowski space and the Lorentz group early in the twentieth century.|$|E

In the final chapter concerned with textbooks, they used Klein's and Molk's encyclopedia projects to contrast the approaches in Germany (Weierstrass and Riemann) and France (Cauchy). In 1900 an element of an algebra over a field (usually ℝ or ℂ) {{was known as a}} hypercomplex number, exemplified by quaternions ℍ which contributed the dot product and cross product useful in analytic geometry, and the <b>del</b> <b>operator</b> in analysis. Explorative articles on hypercomplex numbers, mentioned by Bottazzini and Gray, written by Eduard Study (1898) and Elie Cartan (1908), served as advertisements to twentieth century algebrists, and they soon retired the term hypercomplex by displaying the structure of algebras.|$|E

We classify all braided Cherednik algebras using the theory of braided doubles developed in our previous paper.

Therefore in this paper I present {{for the first time}} a derivation of GravitoElectroMagnetic (GEM) Proca-type equations in fractional space. Considering that Proca equations may be used to explain some electromagnetic effect in superconductor, then fractional GEM Proca-type equations may be expected to explain some gravitomagnetic effects of superconductor for fractal media.

40|$|The annual {{variation}} of the hydrological cycle is illustrated in terms of hemispheric-mean hydrological variables for the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, while the intraseasonal variations of the global hydrological cycle are illustrated with mean values over two hemispheres that form an east-west partition of the globe. This partition {{is defined by the}} 60 deg E- 120 deg W great circle and was chosen so that the mean precipitation difference and the divergent water vapor transport between the two hemispheres was maximized. Two years (1979 - 80) of daily precipitation estimates from the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres an 14 years (1979 - 92) of upper-air data generated by the Global Data Assimilation System at the National Meteorological Center are used in making quantitative estimates of the annual and intraseasonal variations in the global hydrological cycle. The annual variations in hemispheric-mean precipitation (P-circumflex) and water vapor flux divergence (del(vector differential operator) dot Q-circumflex) for the Northern and Southern Hemispheres are comparable with amplitudes of about 0. 5 approximately 0. 7 mm/day. Both (P-circumflex) and (del(vector differential operator) dot Q-circumflex) vary annually in a coherent way in each hemisphere so that water vapor diverges from the winter hemisphere, where (P-circumflex) reaches its minimum, to the summer hemisphere, where (P-circumflex) attains its maximum. In fact, the hemispheric-mean divergence of water vapor flux changes sign during the annual cycle. Intraseasonal variations of hemispheric-mean precipitation mean P-tilde, evaporation mean E-tilde, and water vapor flux divergence mean <b>del</b> (vector differential <b>operator)</b> dot Q-tilde in the two hemisphres in the east-west direction are comparable with amplitudes of about 0. 1 approximately 0. 2 mm/day, although amplitudes in some cases exceed 0. 3 mm/day. Hemispheric-mean precipitation mean P-tilde varies coherently in opposite phase for the two hemispheres, while mean <b>del</b> (vector differential <b>operator)</b> dot Q-tilde varies so that water vapor diverges from the hemisphere of maximum mean P-tilde to the hemisphere to the hemisphere of minimum mean P-tilde. Intraseasonal variations of mean P-tilde, mean E-tilde, and mean del (vector differential oprator) dot Q-tilde are in accord with the eastward propagation of the intraseasonal global divergent circulation...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} linear {{stability}} of compressional waves {{in a medium}} through which cosmic rays stream at the Alfven speed due to strong coupling with Alfven waves. Acoustic waves can be driven unstable by the cosmic-ray drift, provided that the streaming speed is sufficiently large compared to the thermal sound speed. Two effects can cause instability: (1) the heating of the thermal gas due to the damping of Alfven waves driven unstable by cosmic-ray streaming; and (2) phase shifts in the cosmic-ray pressure perturbation caused by the combination of cosmic-ray streaming and diffusion. The instability {{does not depend on}} the magnitude of the background cosmic-ray pressure gradient, and occurs whether or not cosmic-ray diffusion is important relative to streaming. When the cosmic-ray pressure is small compared to the gas pressure, or cosmic-ray diffusion is strong, the instability manifests itself as a weak overstability of slow magnetosonic waves. Larger cosmic-ray pressure gives rise to new hybrid modes, which can be strongly unstable in the limits of both weak and strong cosmic-ray diffusion and in the presence of thermal conduction. Parts of our analysis parallel earlier work by McKenzie & Webb (which were brought to our attention after this paper was accepted for publication), but our treatment of diffusive effects, thermal conduction, and nonlinearities represent significant extensions. Although the linear growth rate of instability is independent of the background cosmic-ray pressure gradient, the onset of nonlinear eff ects does depend on absolute value of <b>DEL</b> (vector differential <b>operator)</b> P(sub c). At the onset of nonlinearity the fractional amplitude of cosmic-ray pressure perturbations is delta P(sub C) /P(sub C) approximately (kL) (exp - 1) much less than 1, where k is the wavenumber and L is the pressure scale height of the unperturbed cosmic rays. We speculate that the instability may lead to a mode of cosmic-ray transport in which plateaus of uniform cosmic-ray pressure are separated by either laminar or turbulent jumps in which the thermal gas is subject to intense heating...|$|R
