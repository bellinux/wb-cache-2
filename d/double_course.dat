2500|$|By this time, however, he {{had decided}} to further his {{education}} at a first-rate university. His first choice was Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. But he soon realized that he probably would not pass Vanderbilt's tough entrance examinations. So, in 1895, at the age of 28, Lomax matriculated at the University of Texas at Austin, majoring in English literature, and undertaking almost a <b>double</b> <b>course</b> load (including Greek, Latin, and Anglo Saxon) and was graduated in two years. With a touch of Texas hyperbole, he later wrote:Never was there such a hopeless hodge-podge, There was I, a Chautauqua-educated country boy who couldn't conjugate an English verb or decline a pronoun, attempting to master three other languages at the same time. ... But I plunged on through the year, for since I was older than the average freshman, I must hurry, hurry, hurry. I don't think I ever stopped to think how foolish it all was. In his memoir, Adventures of a Ballad Hunter, Lomax recounts how he had arrived at the University of Texas with a roll of cowboy songs he had written down in childhood. He showed them to an English professor, Morgan Callaway, only to have them discounted as [...] "cheap and unworthy," [...] prompting Lomax to take the bundle behind the men's dormitory and burn it. His interest in folksongs thus rebuffed, Lomax focused his attentions on more acceptable academic pursuits. He joined the fraternity Phi Delta Theta and the Rusk Literary Society, as well as becoming an editor and later the editor-in-chief of the University of Texas Magazine. During the summer of 1896, he attended a summer school program in Chicago studying languages. In 1897, he became an associate editor of the Alcalde, a student newspaper. After graduation in June 1897, he worked at the University of Texas as registrar for the next six years until the spring of 1903. He also had other duties such as being personal secretary to the President of the University, manager of Brackenridge Hall (the men's dormitory on campus), and serving on the Alumni Scholarship Committee. Lomax joined a campus fraternity known as The Great and Honorable Order of Gooroos receiving the title [...] "Sybillene Priest".|$|E

50|$|An eight-string bass guitar {{is a type}} of bass guitar with <b>double</b> <b>course</b> strings {{normally}} {{tuned in}} octaves, with both strings in a course usually played simultaneously. As on a 12-string guitar, this produces a natural chorus effect due to the subtle differences in string timbre. Such approach has been extended with the introduction of 10-, 12-, 15- or more-string bass guitars, which either double the strings of standard 5- or 6-string basses or even triple the strings of normal 4-, 5- or 6-string basses.|$|E

5000|$|Walls: In {{areas where}} brick was used, walls were built using a simple Flemish bond, meaning a single skin 9-in wall. They {{all had to}} have a damp course and foundations.

50|$|Polyphonic {{music is}} idiomatic for the lyra viol. It is most similar to lute music, {{as the number}} of voices can change within a piece, unlike {{harpsichord}} music where the number of voices tends to stay consistent. Since the lyra viol is bowed, all chords must be formed using adjacent strings. This leads to very close harmonic voice leading, which may also be the reason for the frequent unison double stops in lyra viol music, perhaps also intended to imitate the <b>double</b> <b>course</b> of strings on the lute. Since all the chords must be formed using adjacent strings, scordatura tunings are the rule rather than the exception. Almost 60 different tunings from the seventeenth century have been found. They tended to be formulated so as to put the most important notes on open strings, and were composed in sets of pieces, so that players would not have to retune too frequently.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The author {{faced with}} the impossibility of {{assessing}} {{the relative importance of}} the different contributions of physical quantities appearing in the equations of transport he appealed to the dimensional analysis. Thus by grouping the physical parameters the dependent and independent variables it generates dimensionless numbers. The latter having a physical significance make it possible to characterize the various contributions. To solve the dimensionless equations obtained strongly coupled reduced scale the author opts for a numerical method. The spatial discretization variable pitch and tight at the interfaces of different zones of the field because of the strong gradients in these regions is adopted. The equations are then integrated in the numerical domain using the finite volume method and the coefficients are approached by the schema of the power Patankar law. The resulting system of algebraic equations is solved by the method of <b>double</b> <b>course</b> combined with an iterative relaxation line by line type Gauss-Seidel. Furthermore with a volumetric coefficient of coupling which depends on the dissociation of the excitons and the average temperature field the author has studied the influence of some physical parameters on the total density of photocurrent such that the heating factor the conversion velocity and the volume coupling coefficient of charge carriers...|$|E
