5|$|Entertainment Weekly, the Los Angeles Times, and The New York Times Book Review {{considered}} Middlesex one of {{the best}} books of 2002, and some scholars believed the novel should be considered <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>title</b> <b>of</b> Great American Novel. Generally, reviewers felt that the novel succeeded in portraying its Greek immigrant drama and were also impressed with Eugenides' depiction of his hometown of Detroit—praising him for his social commentary. Reviewers from the medical, gay, and intersex communities mostly praised Middlesex, though some intersex commentators have been more critical. In 2007, the book was featured in Oprah's Book Club.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{independence}} of Slovenia, the Football Association of Slovenia separated from the Football Association of Yugoslavia and created their own football competitions. For {{the first time in}} history, top Slovenian clubs competed in the newly formed Slovenian football league <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>title</b> <b>of</b> Slovenian champion. Of the founding clubs in the PrvaLiga, only Maribor, Gorica and Celje have not been relegated. The format and the number of clubs in the league has changed over time, ranging from 21 clubs in the first season to 10 clubs in its present form. The top clubs {{at the end of the}} season are awarded a qualifying spot in the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League, with the bottom one being relegated to the Slovenian Second League, 2. SNL.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} nineteenth century the rhyme has been seen {{as one of the most}} popular and well known in the English-speaking world. It has also been {{referenced}} in both literature and popular culture. It was used by T. S. Eliot at the climax of his poem The Waste Land (1922). The final line of the verse was probably the inspiration <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>title</b> <b>of</b> Lerner and Loewe's 1956 musical My Fair Lady. The tune is often used by English football supporters as the basis for chants.|$|E

5|$|Hutson's first catch as a {{professional}} was on an 83-yard touchdown pass from Herber on the first play from scrimmage against the Chicago Bears, {{in the second game}} of the 1935 season. It was the only score of the game as the Packers won 7–0. He caught six touchdowns total in his rookie season, which led the league. It was the first in a string of four straight seasons and nine seasons total that Hutson led the league in touchdown receptions. The next season the Packers won their fourth league title, with a 21–6 win over the Boston Redskins in the 1936 NFL Championship Game. Hutson scored the first touchdown of the game, on a 48-yard pass from Herber in the first quarter. Hutson completed the season with 34 receptions for 536 yards and eight touchdowns, which were all league records, and helped Herber set the NFL season passing yards record. Hutson's yardage record was broken the next season by Chicago Cardinals receiver Gaynell Tinsley, who challenged Hutson {{over the next few years}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>title</b> <b>of</b> best receiver in the NFL.|$|E
5|$|The Slovenian {{football}} champions are {{the winners}} of the highest league of association football in Slovenia, PrvaLiga. Also known by the abbreviation 1. SNL, PrvaLiga is contested on a round robin basis and the championship awarded to the club that is top of the league {{at the end of the}} season. The league was established after the independence of Slovenia in 1991, originally containing 21 clubs. Before that, top Slovenian teams competed in Yugoslavia with only Ilirija, AŠK Primorje and after a forced merger of the two teams in 1936, Ljubljana ever reaching the country's highest division, Yugoslav First League. Olimpija, Maribor and Nafta Lendava were the only Slovenian teams who participated in the top division between the end of World War II in 1945 and the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991. While being a part of the Yugoslav football system, most of the Slovenian clubs competed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>title</b> <b>of</b> regional champions in the Slovenian Republic Football League. However, the republic league was officially the third tier of football most of the time and the competition was usually without the top Slovenian clubs, who played in the Yugoslav Second League or the country's top division.|$|E

5|$|The club {{spent their}} first {{ten years in}} local and {{regional}} divisions as there was no official national league competition, playing {{the majority of their}} matches in the city division called Malmömästerskapen. They also competed in regional competitions in Scania, and played matches against Danish clubs. In 1916 Malmö FF reached the final of the Scanian regional competition (Distriktsmästerskapen) for the first time, playing against rival Helsingborgs IF but losing 3–4. The club defeated local rival IFK Malmö three times during the season, and thus earned the unofficial but much desired title of Malmö's best football club. In 1917 Malmö FF competed in Svenska Mästerskapet for the first time, a cup tournament <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>title</b> <b>of</b> Swedish champions, but lost their first match in the second qualifying round 4–1 against IFK Malmö. The club continued to play in the cup until 1922, reaching the quarter-finals in 1920 when they were knocked out by Landskrona BoIS. The cup was eventually discontinued and the title of Swedish champions was given to the winners of Allsvenskan which was first created for the 1924–25 season.|$|E
5|$|The event also {{featured}} {{the return of}} two more fighters from injury, in Karo Parisyan and Stephan Bonnar. Parisyan, a judo standout, had to withdraw from a scheduled fight against Yoshiyuki Yoshida at UFC 88 with a back injury just one day before the fight. His opponent for UFC 94 was undefeated South Korean welterweight Dong Hyun Kim. Bonnar, a light heavyweight, was to take on Matt Hamill at UFC Fight Night 13, but a left knee injury during training forced him out of that bout. His opponent, the 21-year-old Jon Jones was a national amateur wrestling champion and coming off a unanimous decision victory over Andre Gusmão at UFC 87, where he took the fight on three weeks notice. Rounding out the main card was a lightweight contest between {{the winner of the}} fifth season of the UFC's reality television series and MMA competition The Ultimate Fighter, Nate Diaz, and contender Clay Guida. The Ultimate Fighter is a single-elimination reality series featuring fledging professional MMA fighters competing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>title</b> <b>of</b> The Ultimate Fighter, and a six-figure, multi-fight contract with the UFC. Diaz is a Brazilian jiu-jitsu brown belt under Cesar Gracie, and Guida is noted by MMA journalist Sam Caplan as one of the UFC's most highly regarded fighters. The two were expected to fight in December 2008, but the fight failed to materialize due to a foot injury to Guida.|$|E
5|$|The son of Tughj ibn Juff, {{a general}} of Turkic origin who served both the Abbasids and the {{autonomous}} Tulunid rulers of Egypt and Syria, Muhammad ibn Tughj {{was born in}} Baghdad but grew up in Syria and acquired his first military and administrative experiences at his father's side. He had a turbulent early career: he was imprisoned along with his father by the Abbasids in 905, was released in 906, participated {{in the murder of}} the vizier al-Abbas ibn al-Hasan al-Jarjara'i in 908, and fled Iraq to enter the service of the governor of Egypt, Takin al-Khazari. Eventually he acquired the patronage of several influential Abbasid magnates, chiefly the powerful commander-in-chief Mu'nis al-Muzaffar. These ties led him to being named governor first of Palestine and then of Damascus. In 933, he was briefly named governor of Egypt, but this order was revoked after the death of Mu'nis, and Ibn Tughj had to fight to preserve even his governorship of Damascus. In 935, he was re-appointed to Egypt, where he quickly defeated a Fatimid invasion and stabilized the turbulent country. His reign marks a rare period of domestic peace, stability and good government in the annals of early Islamic Egypt. In 938 Caliph al-Radi granted his request <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>title</b> <b>of</b> al-Ikhshid, which had been borne by the rulers of his ancestral Farghana Valley. It is by this title that he was known thereafter.|$|E

5|$|Thus, in {{the late}} 930s, Hasan, {{encouraged}} by his control over a large and rich domain, entered the intrigues of the Abbasid court, {{and became one of}} the main contenders <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>title</b> <b>of</b> amir al-umara. At first, Hasan tried to exploit the weakness of the Abbasid government to withhold his payment of tribute, but the Turk Bajkam, who had ousted Ibn Ra'iq in 938, quickly forced him to back down. Hasan then supported Ibn Ra'iq in the latter's quest to regain his lost position. Bajkam tried to forcefully evict Hasan from his Jaziran domains, but in vain, and was eventually killed in a skirmish with Kurdish brigands in early 941. Hasan's great chance came in early 942, when the Caliph al-Muttaqi (r. 940–944) and his closest aides fled Baghdad to escape the city's imminent fall to the Barids of Basra and sought refuge at Mosul. Hasan now made a direct bid for power: he had Ibn Ra'iq assassinated and succeeded him as amir al-umara, receiving the honorific laqab of Nasir al-Dawla ("Defender of the Dynasty"). He then escorted the Caliph back to Baghdad, which they entered on 4 June 942. To secure his position further, Nasir al-Dawla married his daughter to the Caliph's son. Along with their cousin, Husayn ibn Sa'id, Nasir al-Dawla's brother Ali was instrumental in the Hamdanid enterprise, taking the field against the Baridis, who still controlled the rich province of Basra and were determined to regain Baghdad. After scoring a victory over them, Ali was awarded the laqab of Sayf al-Dawla ("Sword of the Dynasty"), by which he became famous. This double award marked {{the first time that a}} laqab incorporating the prestigious element al-Dawla were granted to anyone other than the wazir, the Caliphate's chief minister, and was a symbolic affirmation of the military's predominance over the civil bureaucracy.|$|E
