40|$|Introduction: {{the first}} birth {{is an event}} {{in the life of}} people and {{therefore}} in their development process. The implications that stem from changes arising on many different levels require a variety of parental responses. This makes studying the problems of parents in the care of infants during the <b>first</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> life a relevant issue. Objective: to determine the socio-demographic characteristics of parents with a one month old child and to identify the difficulties parents face in caring for their infants during the <b>first</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> life. Materials and methods: cross-sectional study, experimental, descriptive, with a non probabilistic sample of 88 parents. A questionnaire was applied in two parts, the first consisting of a socio-demographic and obstetrical configuration. The second part was applied to determine the difficulties of parents in the care of infants during the <b>first</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> life. Results and discussion: the study identifies and describes the difficulties experienced by parents in the care of newborns. It is essential to know the problems of parents during the <b>first</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> life of their infants in order to promote better adaptation strategies for their new roles and to develop better parenting skills...|$|R
