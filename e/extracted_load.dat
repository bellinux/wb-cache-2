40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} regulating the output voltage of a DC-DC buck-boost converter feeding a constant power load,which {{is a problem of}} current practical interest. Designing a stabilising controller is theoretically challenging because its average model is a bilinear second order system that, due to the presence of the constant power load,is non- minimum phase with respect to both states. Moreover,to design a high performance controller, the knowledge of the <b>extracted</b> <b>load</b> power, which is difficult to measure in industrial applications, is required. In this paper, an adaptive interconnection and damping assignment passivity based control that incorporates the immersion and invariance parameter estimator for the load power is proposed to solve the problem. Some detailed simulations are provided to validate the transient behaviour of the proposed controller and compare it with the performance of a classical PD scheme...|$|E
40|$|Collection {{and storage}} of solar energy in salt {{gradient}} solar ponds {{under conditions of}} high ambient and ground temperatures and all year-round sunny weather are investigated theoretically. A transient model based on measured local environmental conditions (solar insolation, ambient temperature and ground temperature) is developed to predict solar transmission, temperature distribution and salt distribution inside the pond for {{any day of the}} year. In the model the effects of heat dissipation into the ground, bottom reflection, pond dimensions, load extraction and variation of the pond's physical properties with temperature and concentration are investigated. The generated non-linear coupled system of heat and salt concentration equations for the composite media, considered to have isothermal boundary conditions, is solved numerically using the implicit finite-difference scheme. The results show that the optimum thickness of the gradient zone, under hot climatic conditions, is 1 Â· 5 m. Following the first year of operation, the pond with a thicker storage zone gives much less temperature fluctuation between winter and summer seasons and hence a better thermal performance. An energy analysis performed on the pond shows that about 32 % of incident solar energy is lost to the air by evaporation, convection and thermal radiation, 6 % is lost to the ground; 12 % is the <b>extracted</b> <b>load</b> and the remainder (50 %) is due to absorption and reflection at the surface of the pond. For a similar pond, operating under cold climates, air and ground losses are much higher while the useful load is relatively lower in comparison with the corresponding figures for hot climates. ...|$|E

The optimum conditions for the extraction of S. spinosum leaves to obtain bioactive extract were investigated using response surface methodology (RSM). Total phenol contents, total antioxidant and antibacterial activities, phenolic composition of S. spinosum extract were studied. The prepared S. spinosum extract showed high antioxidant activity when compared with many other medicinal plants in the literature. It was determined as 3143. 5 mmole Trolox per gr dry weight. The phenolic content of S. spinosum extract was examined with High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Hyperoside and isoquercetin were detected in S. spinosum extract. Especially, isoquercetin was the major compound in the extract. In addition, the antimicrobial activity of S. spinosum extract was investigated. The extract showed fungicide activity against Candida albicans. S. spinosum extract were encapsulated within zein particle via electrospray method {{in order to enhance}} its stability. The effects of process parameters for electrospraying method on the particle morphology and size distribution were extensively investigated.
