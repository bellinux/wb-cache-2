40|$|Without {{assuming}} any pdf {{for some}} measured parameter, we derive a predictive pdf {{for the outcome}} of a second measurement, given the outcome of the first measurement and two common assumptions about the noise. These are that (1) it is additive, and (2) it is of some known pdf. The argument is based on a Bayesian analysis of the noise when no pdf is provided for the value of the parameter. In this way we avoid assuming an ad-hoc prior. We clarify how this method of direct predictive inference is distinct from fiducial prediction. We specify the distinct flaw in the fiducial argument, and outline the importance of this development in the foundations of probability and statistics.

50|$|Frequentist {{inference}} {{is a type}} {{of statistical}} inference that draws conclusions from sample data by emphasizing the frequency or proportion of the data. An alternative name is frequentist statistics. This is the inference framework in which the well-established methodologies of statistical hypothesis testing and confidence intervals are based.

5000|$|Unfortunately Fisher did {{not give}} a general {{definition}} of the fiducial method and he denied that the method could always be applied. His only examples were for a single parameter; different generalisations have been given when there are several parameters. A relatively complete presentation of the fiducial approach to inference is given by Quenouille (1958), while Williams (1959) describes the application of fiducial analysis to the calibration problem (also known as [...] "inverse regression") in regression analysis. [...] Further discussion of <b>fiducial</b> <b>inference</b> is given by Kendall & Stuart (1973).|$|E
5000|$|Fisher {{admitted}} that [...] "fiducial inference" [...] had problems. Fisher wrote to George A.

Later Fisher confessed that [...] "I don't understand yet what fiducial probability does. We shall {{have to live with}} it a long time before we know what it's doing for us.

50|$|In 1933, Bartlett was {{recruited}} by Egon Pearson {{to the new}} statistics department at University College, London. Pearson was already working with Jerzy Neyman.

Relations between the two men fluctuated; sometimes Bartlett was in Fisher's good books, but often not. In 1934, Bartlett became statistician at the ICI agricultural research station at Jealott's Hill. Not only did he deal with practical problems but he worked on statistical theory, as well as on problems in genetics but he became interested in the characterisation of intelligence. He remembered Jealott's Hill as the best working environment of his career. Bartlett left ICI for the University of Cambridge in 1938 but at the outset of World War II was mobilised into the Ministry of Supply, conducting rocket research alongside Frank Anscombe, David Kendall and Pat Moran.|$|E

However, it appears to have made a resurgence recently under the label of generalized inference. In this new guise <b>fiducial</b> <b>inference</b> has proved to be a useful tool for deriving statistical procedures for problems where frequentist methods with good properties were previously unavailable. Therefore we believe that the fiducial argument of R. A. Fisher deserves a fresh look from a new angle.

We demonstrate this fiducial recipe on many examples of varying complexity.

40|$|We {{propose a}} way to {{construct}} fiducial distributions for a multidimensional parameter using a step-by-step conditional procedure related to the inferential importance {{of the components of}} the parameter. For discrete models, in which the non-uniqueness of the fiducial distribution is well known, we propose to use the geometric mean of the "extreme cases" and show its good behavior with respect to the more traditional arithmetic mean. Connections with the generalized <b>fiducial</b> <b>inference</b> approach developed by Hannig and with confidence distributions are also analyzed. The suggested procedure strongly simplifies when the statistical model belongs to a subclass of the natural exponential family, called conditionally reducible, which includes the multinomial and the negative-multinomial models. Furthermore, because <b>fiducial</b> <b>inference</b> and objective Bayesian analysis are both attempts to derive distributions for an unknown parameter without any prior information, it is natural to discuss their relationships. In particular, the reference posteriors, which also depend on the importance ordering of the parameters are the natural terms of comparison. We show that fiducial and reference posterior distributions coincide in the location-scale models, and we characterize the conditionally reducible natural exponential families for which this happens. The discussion of some classical examples closes the paper. Comment: 37 pages, 3 figure...|$|E
40|$|<b>Fiducial</b> <b>Inference,</b> {{introduced}} by Fisher in the 1930 s, {{has a long}} history, which at times aroused passionate disagreements. However, its application has been largely confined to relatively simple parametric problems. In this paper, we present {{what might be the}} first time <b>fiducial</b> <b>inference,</b> as generalized by Hannig et al. (2016), is systematically applied to estimation of a nonparametric survival function under right censoring. We find that the resulting fiducial distribution gives rise to surprisingly good statistical procedures applicable to both one sample and two sample problems. In particular, we use the fiducial distribution of a survival function to construct pointwise and curvewise confidence intervals for the survival function, and propose tests based on the curvewise confidence interval. We establish a functional Bernstein-von Mises theorem, and perform thorough simulation studies in scenarios with different levels of censoring. The proposed fiducial based confidence intervals maintain coverage in situations where asymptotic methods often have substantial coverage problems. Furthermore, the average length of the proposed confidence intervals is often shorter than the length of competing methods that maintain coverage. Finally, the proposed fiducial test is more powerful than various types of log-rank tests and sup log-rank tests in some scenarios.
