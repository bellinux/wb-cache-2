50|$|The {{upper lip}} of the horse is grasped and the loop of chain or rope is placed around it, then {{the handle of the}} twitch is twisted until the loop is firmly around the lip.

He was put in irons in solitary {{confinement}} in an unheated and uncovered cell for fifteen weeks, in which the rain and snow could beat in upon him. None of his friends nor even his wife were permitted to see him during this time. According to four doctors, Leighton was so sick that {{he was unable to}} attend his supposed sentencing. Durant notes that Leighton also [...] "was tied to a stake and received thirty-six stripes with a <b>heavy</b> <b>cord</b> upon his naked back; he was placed in the pillory for two hours in November's frost and snow; he was branded in the face, had his nose split and his ears cut off, and was condemned to life imprisonment".

40|$|I. Introduction — The {{need for}} a simple method of {{collecting}} botanical material from rain-forest trees became evident during {{the construction of a}} field key to the rain-forest trees of North Queensland. Many collecting techniques have been developed, e. g. throwing sticks and stones, severing branches with rifles and shotguns, felling trees with axes and saws, breaking branches with hand thrown lines and using monkeys to climb and pick twig samples. However, the collection of botanical material from rain-forest trees is a difficult and time-consuming task. The problem is not as great in forests consisting of a small number of tree species. In such forests it is generally possible to visually group the trees into species assemblages without knowing the identity of each species. When a low branched individual of a particular species is sighted, botanical material can be collected. This approach does not work satisfactorily in rain forest because of the large number of tree species and the long slender trunks on most trees. Although these trees may reach 60 m in height they usually have at least part of their crown within 20 - 30 m of the ground. II. Technique — The basic aim is to loop a strong nylon cord over a branch in the crown of the tree and to break a branch by pulling on the cord. There are two steps: 1. A lead sinker weighing 50 - 70 g, attached to a monofilament nylon fishing line with a breaking strain of 7 to 9 kg is propelled over a branch {{with the aid of a}} catapult and allowed to fall to the ground after passing over the desired branch. 2. The sinker is removed and the end of the nylon cord is attached to the monofilament line and hauled up and over the branch and back down to the operator. One or more operators pull on both ends of the <b>heavy</b> <b>cord</b> until the branch breaks...|$|E
5000|$|Grosgrain , also gros-grain and, rarely, gros grain, {{is a type}} {{of fabric}} {{characterized}} by its ribbed appearance. In grosgrain, the weft is heavier than the warp, creating prominent transverse ribs. It is called a [...] "corded" [...] fabric since the weft resembles a fine cord. Grosgrain is a plain weave <b>corded</b> fabric, with <b>heavier</b> <b>cords</b> than in poplin but lighter than in faille. Grosgrain has a very dull appearance with little luster but is very strong. It is a firm, close-woven, fine-corded fabric. While grosgrain fabric is generally black, it can be many different colors, and grosgrain ribbon comes in a large variety of colors and patterns.|$|R

5000|$|... (Description by W.H. Dall as a {{subgenus}} of Carinodrillia) This genus {{consists of}} moderate-sized, rather heavy shelled mollusks which resemble {{the members of}} the genus Carinodrillia. They differ from Carinodrillia in having the whorls of the protoconch without a median carina. Here they are rounded, the early whorls smooth, succeeded by a finely axially, closely lirate portion that passes into an axially slender ribbed part, which in turn passes into the postnuclear sculpture. The sculpture of the postnuclear whorls consists of strong axial ribs which weaken on the posterior sinus. The axial ribs and intercostal spaces are crossed by rather <b>heavy</b> spiral <b>cords,</b> finer spiral lirations between the <b>heavier</b> <b>cords,</b> and hairlike incremental lines. The combination of these last two elements produces a fine clothlike pattern, while their junction sometimes almost appears granulose. The columella is stout, and there is a weak umbilical chink at its anterior termination. The aperture is rather short, deeply channeled anteriorly and posteriorly, the posterior sinus falling a little anterior to the summit. The outer lip is protracted into a clawlike element between the anterior limit of the posterior sinus and the stromboid notch.|$|R

5000|$|Detonating cord {{is rated}} in {{explosive}} mass per unit length. This {{is expressed in}} grains per foot in the United States, or in grams per metre elsewhere. A [...] "grams per metre" [...] rating will be roughly one fifth the [...] "grains per foot" [...] rating. For example, [...] "50 grain det. cord" [...] refers to detonating cord which has 50 grains of explosive per foot of length—or approximately 10 g/m. This is a typical [...] "default" [...] rating for connecting charges for blasting; lighter detonating cords {{may be used for}} [...] "low noise blasting" [...] and movie special effects, while <b>heavier</b> <b>cords,</b> used where the cord is employed to have some direct explosive effect—such as for precision rock carving work—may use 50 to 250 grain/foot (10 to 50 g/m) detonating cord.|$|R

5000|$|In {{order to}} fill the gap, the {{so-called}} leather cannon was developed. A relatively thin copper tube was reinforced by <b>heavy</b> <b>cords</b> and finally clad in leather (alternatively clad in leather straps first and then rope cords). While the weapon was light enough to be mobile (it required only a two-man crew to pull into position and operate [...] ), {{and at the same}} time was cheaper in construction, the basic design proved to be flawed. The reinforcing materials acted as an insulator, and did not allow heat to dissipate fast enough. After only a few shots the gun would be too hot to use. The heat would also deform the tube and drastically decrease accuracy; once damaged this way, even after being left to cool, the barrel was prone to burst, severely injuring the loader. As a field weapon it was too unreliable to be viable.|$|R

5000|$|The {{traditional}} western cinch {{was made}} of multiple strands of <b>heavy</b> <b>cords,</b> usually made of mohair, or, in cheaper designs, cotton. Modern designs are also made of synthetic fiber or a synthetic-mohair blend. The number of cords used varies with width and design, but the standard range is from 17 to 30 strands, creating an end product that is 4 to 7 inches wide at the widest point {{in the center of}} the cinch. This design is sometimes known as a [...] "string", [...] "strand," [...] "cord" [...] or [...] "rope" [...] cinch. Each cord is knotted around a large ring, called a cinch ring, placed at either end. In the center, additional <b>cording</b> or very <b>heavy</b> thread is used to gather all the cords into a set width and make the cinch lie flat. Wider cinches are narrowed to fit the cinch ring by allowing two layers of cord to form at the ring, sometimes aided by decorative weaving that stabilizes the cords.|$|R

And though he sat there, blushing and humble, again she felt drawn to him. She was surprised by a wanton thought that rushed into her mind. It seemed to her that if she could lay her two hands upon that neck that all its strength and vigor would flow out to her. She was shocked by this thought. It seemed to reveal to her an undreamed depravity in her nature. Besides, strength to her was a gross and brutish thing. Her ideal of masculine beauty had always been slender gracefulness. Yet the thought still persisted. It bewildered her that she should desire to place her hands on that sunburned neck. In truth, she was far from robust, and the need of her body and mind was for strength. But she did not know it. She knew only that no man had ever affected her before as this one had, who shocked her from moment to moment with his awful grammar.|$|R
