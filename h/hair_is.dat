5|$|Anthropologists {{speculate}} that the functional significance of long head hair may be adornment, a by-product of secondary natural selection once other androgenic/somatic hair (body hair) had largely been lost. Another possibility is that long head <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> a result of Fisherian runaway sexual selection, where long lustrous <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> a visible marker for a healthy individual. For some groups or individuals, however, short <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> the selected trait.|$|E
5|$|Historically, East Asian {{cultures}} viewed {{long hair}} {{as a sign}} of youth and aesthetic beauty. Long <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> associated with private life and sexuality. East Asian cultures see long, unkempt hair in a woman {{as a sign of}} sexual intent or a recent sexual encounter, as usually their <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> tied up. Lay Buddhists have long hair, while Buddhist monks have shaved heads.|$|E
5|$|Long lustrous female <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> {{generally}} rated attractive by {{both men}} and women across cultures. The prevalence of trichophilia (hair partialism or fetishism) is 7% in the population, and very long <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> a common subject of devotion in this group.|$|E
50|$|Both {{male and}} female wore their hair in a long braid until they were married, at which time the <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> knotted; man's <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> knotted in a topknot called sangtu (상투) {{on the top of}} the head, and the woman’s <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> rolled into a ball shaped form and was set just above the nape of the neck.|$|R
50|$|Tizzy, {{the title}} character, was a stereotypical teen-aged American girl. In Collier's, the Tizzy {{cartoons}} were {{in color and}} Tizzy's <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> red. The syndicated cartoons were {{in black and white}}, and Tizzy's <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> blonde. When the color cartoons were reprinted in black and white in the first Tizzy paperback book, Tizzy's red <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> rendered as black.|$|R
40|$|Two {{adolescent}} girls having premature greying of <b>hairs</b> <b>were</b> treated with 200 mg calcium pantothenate daily orally. In a follow up of 29 and 13 months respectively, 757 and 1069 grey <b>hairs</b> <b>were</b> counted to have got converted into black <b>hairs.</b> It <b>is</b> suggested that greying of <b>hairs</b> <b>is</b> reversible {{at least in}} some cases; further studies are, therefore, very much indicated.

5000|$|On 19 March 1954, the Daily Mail printed {{an article}} which {{described}} expedition teams obtaining hair specimens {{from what was}} alleged to be a Yeti scalp found in the Pangboche monastery. The <b>hairs</b> <b>were</b> black to dark brown in colour in dim light, and fox red in sunlight. The <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> analysed by Professor Frederic Wood Jones, an expert in human and comparative anatomy. During the study, the <b>hairs</b> <b>were</b> bleached, cut into sections and analysed microscopically. The research consisted of taking microphotographs of the hairs and comparing them with hairs from known animals such as bears and orangutans. Jones concluded that the <b>hairs</b> <b>were</b> not actually from a scalp. He contended that while some animals do have a ridge of hair extending from the pate to the back, no animals have a ridge (as in the Pangboche [...] "scalp") running {{from the base of}} the forehead across the pate and ending at the nape of the neck. Jones was unable to pinpoint exactly the animal from which the Pangboche <b>hairs</b> <b>were</b> taken. He was, however, convinced that the <b>hairs</b> <b>were</b> not of a bear or anthropoid ape. He suggested that the <b>hairs</b> <b>were</b> from the shoulder of a coarse-haired hoofed animal.|$|R
5|$|East Asian {{cultures}} have traditionally seen long, unkempt {{hair in a}} woman {{as a sign of}} sexual intent or a recent sexual encounter, as usually their <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> tied up in styles such as the ponytail, plait, or any bun.|$|E

5|$|Long <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> a hairstyle {{where the}} head <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> allowed {{to grow to}} {{considerable}} length. Exactly what constitutes long hair can change from culture to culture, or even within cultures.

2500|$|Early in the period, <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> worn {{in a bun}} at {{the back}} of the head with a cluster of curls framing the face.

25|$|Historically, many {{cultures}} in continental Africa developed hairstyles that defined status, or identity, {{in regards to}} age, ethnicity, wealth, social rank, marital status, religion, fertility, adulthood, and death. <b>Hair</b> <b>was</b> carefully groomed by those who understood the aesthetic standard, as the social implications of <b>hair</b> grooming <b>were</b> {{a significant part of}} community life. Dense, thick, clean, and neatly groomed <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> something highly admired and sought after. Hair groomers possessed unique styling skills, allowing them to create a variety of designs that met the local cultural standards. <b>Hair</b> <b>was</b> usually dressed according to local culture.|$|R
50|$|Feathered <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> a hairstyle {{popular in}} the 1970s and the early 1980s with men and women. It was {{designed}} for straight <b>hair.</b> The <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> layered, with either a side or a center parting. The <b>hair</b> would <b>be</b> brushed back at the sides, giving an appearance similar to the feathers of a bird.|$|R
5|$|Strict {{orthodox}} Judaism forbids {{men from}} cutting their sidelocks, but other hair may be kept as desired. <b>Hair</b> <b>is</b> not cut {{during a time}} of mourning. The Torah in Deuteronomy 14:1 prohibits removing hair in mourning for the dead.|$|E
5|$|Bikini waxing is the {{epilation}} of {{pubic hair}} beyond the bikini line {{by use of}} waxing. The bikini line delineates {{the part of a}} woman's pubic area to be covered by the bottom part of a bikini, which means any pubic hair visible beyond the boundaries of a swimsuit. Visible pubic <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> widely culturally disapproved, considered to be embarrassing, and often removed.|$|E
5|$|Chhinnamasta {{may have}} a lolling tongue. Her <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> loose and dishevelled and {{sometimes}} decorated with flowers. Alternately, in some images, her <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> tied. Additionally, she is described as having a third eye on her forehead and a jewel on her forehead, which is tied to a snake or a crown on the severed head. The crescent moon may also adorn her head. Chhinnamasta is depicted wearing a serpent as the sacred thread and a mundamala (garland of skulls or severed heads and bones), along with other various gold or pearl ornaments around her neck. Bangles and waist-belt ornaments may be also depicted. She may also wear a snake {{around her neck and}} serpentine earrings. Three streams of blood spring from her neck, one entering her own mouth, while the others are drunk by her female yogini companions, who flank her.|$|E
50|$|Historically, sub-Saharan Africans, as {{in every}} culture, {{developed}} hairstyles that defined status, or identity, {{in regards to}} age, ethnicity, wealth, social rank, marital status, religion, fertility, adulthood, and death. <b>Hair</b> <b>was</b> carefully groomed by those who understood the aesthetic standard, as the social implications of <b>hair</b> grooming <b>were</b> {{a significant part of}} community life.

This {{investigation}} leads to an instance in which Veronica is drugged {{and a part of}} her <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> removed by a mysterious figure. In addition, Keith (Enrico Colantoni) questions the morality of his relationship with Harmony (Laura San Giacomo), leading to their breakup.|$|E
5|$|The {{next step}} is to apply hair. The hair can either be done in one of two ways; wigging, rooting or microrooting. when rooting <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> added 1-4 hair strands per plug. When microrooting, <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> added strand by strand. This can take up to 30 or more hours per head. Once the <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> finished, the {{original}} vinyl body is weighted with a soft stuffed body filled with pellets/fine glass beads/fiberfill.The weight corresponds with its age to achieve a real effect. Various additions also can be added to give the doll an even more life like appearance. Reborns heads are often weighted, so that owners have to support the head like one would a real newborn. Purchasers can have magnets attached inside the mouth or head for attaching a pacifier or hair bows. Electronic devices that mimic a heart beat, or make the chest rise and fall to simulate breathing are common. Reborns can come with an umbilical cord, baby fat, heat packs to make the reborn warm to the touch, or voice boxes that mimic infant sounds. For preemie dolls, they may come in incubators with a breathing apparatus attached to their nose.|$|E
5|$|A normal dog has {{a muscular}} {{appearance}} {{with a deep}} chest and strong legs. The French Spaniel has eyes of a dark amber colour, and a thick tail that tapers towards the tip. The <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> medium, dense, with long feathers on the ears, backs of the legs and tail. It has some waviness on the chest and otherwise lies flat on the body. The normal colour of a French Spaniel's coat is white with brown markings rather in shade from a light cinnamon to dark liver. Historically, the coat was only white with black markings, but the breed was mixed with other colours of Spaniels during the 19th century.|$|E
40|$|Distribution of glandular and eglandular {{hairs on}} the aerial organs of Salvia recognita Fisch. & Mey. has <b>been</b> investigated. Glandular <b>hairs</b> of S. recognita have {{consisted}} of capitate and peltate <b>hairs.</b> Capitate <b>hairs</b> <b>were</b> present abundantly on all aerial parts of S. recognita while peltate <b>hairs</b> <b>were</b> only present on stem, leaf, bract and calyx. Eglandular <b>hairs</b> <b>were</b> also widespread on all aerial parts. A chief characteristic of the family Lamiaceae is the essential oil produced by glandular hairs (Ascensao et al. 1995). Volatile oil produced from glandular <b>hairs</b> <b>is</b> important for pesticide, pharmaceutical, flavouring, perfumery, fragrance and cosmetic industries (Zeybek and Zeybek 2002). The genus Salvia with over 900 species is probably the largest {{member of the family}} and there are 90 species in Turkey (Davis 1982, Güner et al. 2000). Salvia recognita are endemic and Irano-Turanien element. Glandular <b>hairs</b> <b>are</b> the primary secretory parts of these plants and their structures can vary widely among species (Serrato-Valenti et al. 1997). In Lamiaceae, the morphology, distribution and frequency of glandular <b>hairs</b> <b>are</b> used as determinative characters at sub-family level (Ascensao et al. 1995). In almost all species studied, two main types of glandular hair, peltate and capitate, occur which can be distinguished by their head size and stalk length...|$|R

5|$|In {{over one}} or more sittings, a highly skilled {{sculptor}} from Madame Tussauds Studios who is given {{direct access to the}} celebrity will record the colours of the hair and eyes, and over 500 precise body measurements are referenced. Most important is to capture the look of the celebrity to reflect the personality of each unique individual. The next task is to make a clay model of the head and body which is used to create a mould. Wax cast of the head and hands are made from the mould, and the eyes are inserted. Each eye is hand-painted to achieve a perfect match of the original. Real human <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> then inserted painstakingly strand by strand.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} Rurouni Kenshin kanzenban, {{published}} in Japan in July 2006, Watsuki included a draft page featuring a redesign of Kenshin's character. To make his X-shaped scar more notable, Watsuki made {{it long enough}} to cross his nose. Kenshin's <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> tied in two tails, which are flowing {{to make him look}} younger, and shorter, and less androgynous. Watsuki also added a Habaki to Kenshin's sword {{to make it easier to}} draw by simplifying its structure, while also emphasizing strength. Kenshin's hitokiri look was also redesigned slightly, by making his clothes more worn and giving him Yukishiro Tomoe's neck scarf.|$|E
