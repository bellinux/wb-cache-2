After its première in Prague on 2 March 1928, the Capriccio gained considerable acclaim in the musical world.|$|E

5|$|Jesus sits in {{judgement}} in {{the upper}} centre panel. He holds a lily in <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> and a sword in his left, and sits on a rainbow extending across two panels, while his feet rest on a sphere. <b>His</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> is raised {{in the act of}} blessing, his left hand lowered. These positions indicate the act of judgement; he is deciding if souls are to be sent to Heaven or Hell, his gestures echoing the direction and positioning of the scales held by the Archangel Michael beneath him. His palms are open, revealing the wounds sustained when they were nailed to the cross, while his cope gapes in places making visible the injury caused by the lance, which pours deep-red blood. Christ's face is identical to the representation in van der Weyden's Braque Triptych, completed just a few years later in 1452. Christ, placed so high in the pictorial space and spanning both registers, orchestrates the entirety of the inner panels. Whereas earlier Last Judgements might have seemed chaotic, here Christ brings a sense of order.|$|E
5|$|Roshan felt {{isolated}} as a child; he {{was born}} with an extra thumb on <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> which led some of his peers to avoid him.

While in hospital Britten became friendly with a senior nursing sister, Rita Thomson; she moved to Aldeburgh in 1974 and looked after him until his death.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} {{model for}} the iconography of Saint Jovan Vladimir is an engraving in the 1690 edition of the Greek akolouthia. It is a work by Venetian engraver Isabella Piccini.

A portable icon in Saint Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai Peninsula, dated around 1700, shows the saint mounted on horseback.|$|E

Jackson followed with three punches to Silva's head on the ground, two of which occurred after referee Yves Lavigne attempted to halt the contest. Wanderlei remained on the canvas for several moments, but appeared to be OK {{as he left the}} cage under his own power.|$|E

50|$|Many of {{the pieces}} Wittgenstein {{commissioned}} are still frequently performed today by two-armed pianists; in particular, the Austrian pianist Friedrich Wührer, claiming the composer's sanction but apparently over Wittgenstein's objections, created two-hand arrangements of Franz Schmidt's Wittgenstein-inspired left-hand works. Pianists born after Wittgenstein who {{for one reason or}} another have lost the use of their <b>right</b> <b>hands,</b> such as Leon Fleisher (although he eventually recovered <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand's</b> abilities) and João Carlos Martins, have also played works composed for him.|$|R

Twelve days later, the 2/48th Battalion left El Alamein and returned to Gaza in Palestine, where, later that month, Derrick attended a corps patrolling course.

5|$|Frank was autopsied twice, {{the second}} time to recover debris {{embedded}} in his body.

5|$|In 662, Maximus {{was placed}} on trial once more, and was once more convicted of heresy. Following the trial Maximus was tortured, having his tongue cut out, so {{he could no longer}} speak his rebellion, and <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> cut off, so that he could no longer write letters. Maximus was then exiled to the Lazica or Colchis region of modern-day Georgia and was cast in the {{fortress}} of Schemarum, perhaps Muris-Tsikhe near the modern town of Tsageri. He died soon thereafter, on 13 August 662. The events of the trials of Maximus were recorded by Anastasius Bibliothecarius.|$|E
5|$|In the Belmont, Paynter led {{for most}} of the race until the final furlong when Smith came off the rail, {{allowing}} winner Union Rags to slip through and win by a neck. Paynter had already fended off two challengers during the race, and Smith had switched his whip from <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> to his left in an attempt to fend off a late challenge from Atigun; Smith considered his decision to be an error that cost him the race.|$|E

The clan especially feared that the participants from Krajina might try to recover the sacred object. At the end of 19th century the number of Muslims in the procession dropped as their religious and political leaders disapproved of their participation in it. After World War II, Yugoslavia's socialist government discouraged public religious celebrations, and the procession was not held between 1959 and 1984.|$|E
