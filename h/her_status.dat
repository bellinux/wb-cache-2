40|$|ABSTRACT Background Adjuvant {{chemotherapy}} with anthracyclines improves disease-free {{and overall}} survival compared with non – anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy regimens {{in the treatment}} of early breast cancer. The role of <b>HER</b> 2 <b>status</b> as a marker of anthracycline responsiveness has been explored by subset analyses within randomized clinical trials, with inconsistent results. We performed a pooled analysis of the interaction between <b>HER</b> 2 <b>status</b> and the efficacy of adjuvant anthracyclines based on the published subset data. Methods We searched literature databases to identify randomized trials that compared anthracycline-based with non – anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy regimens {{in the treatment of}} early breast cancer and reported efficacy data according to <b>HER</b> 2 <b>status.</b> Log hazard ratios (HRs) for disease-free and overall survival were pooled across the studies according to <b>HER</b> 2 <b>status</b> by inverse variance weighting. A pooled test for treatment by <b>HER</b> 2 <b>status</b> interaction was performed by weighted linear meta-regression. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results Eight studies (with 6564 randomly assigned patients, of whom 5354 had <b>HER</b> 2 <b>status</b> information available) were eligible for this analysis. In HER 2 -positive disease (n = 1536 patients), anthracyclines were superior to non – anthracycline-based regimens in terms of disease-free (pooled HR of relapse = 0. 71; 95...|$|R

40|$|Precise {{assessment}} of <b>HER</b> 2 gene <b>status</b> {{as an important}} biomarker {{plays a significant role}} in identifying the eligible patients for Trastuzumab therapy and determining their clinical outcomes. In this study, the researchers assigned <b>HER</b> 2 amplification <b>status</b> in invasive breast cancer specimens by Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH) and determined its association with other clinical features. Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tumor tissue specimens of 46 patients with invasive breast cancer were collected from November 2011 till May 2012. <b>HER</b> 2 <b>status</b> was evaluated by FISH.

40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{explore the}} {{association}} between serum human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER 2) extracellular domain (ECD) levels and tissue <b>HER</b> 2 <b>status</b> in metastatic gastric cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: <b>HER</b> 2 <b>status</b> was retrospectively analyzed in 219 advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) patients. Serum HER 2 ECD was measured by chemiluminescent assay and tissue HER 2 was assessed by fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay. RESULTS: Significant associations were found between serum HER 2 ECD levels and tissue <b>HER</b> 2 <b>status.</b> Twenty-four patients had HER 2 ECD levels > 16. 35 ng/mL, which has a sensitivity of 51. 4 % and a specificity of 97. 3 % to predict tissue <b>HER</b> 2 <b>status.</b> When the cut-off value was increased to 22 ng/mL, then all 12 patients with serum HER 2 ECD levels> 22 ng/mL were tissue HER 2 positive, corresponding to a specificity of 100 % and a sensitivity of 32. 4 %. High serum HER 2 ECD levels were strongly associated with the intestinal histological type (Lauren's classification), liver metastasis, multiple metastasis (> 2) and increased LDH levels, but not with overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: The high specificity of the serum HER 2 ECD assay in predicting tissue <b>HER</b> 2 <b>status</b> suggests its potential as {{a surrogate marker of}} the <b>HER</b> 2 <b>status</b> in gastric cancer...|$|R

40|$|Trastuzumab has {{recently}} been introduced {{as a treatment for}} HER 2 -positive metastatic and/or unresectable gastric cancer (MUGC); however, compared with breast cancer, some issues concerning HER 2 and trastuzumab therapy for gastric cancer remain unclear. A 74 -year-old woman received trastuzumab-containing chemotherapy for HER 2 -positive MUGC. She had a marked response to 8 months of chemotherapy, and gastrectomy and hepatic metastasectomy with curative intent were performed. The resected specimen showed complete loss of HER 2 positivity in the residual tumor. For MUGC, a change in <b>HER</b> 2 <b>status</b> {{during the course of the}} disease with or without chemotherapy has rarely been reported. However, in breast cancer, a significant frequency of change in <b>HER</b> 2 <b>status</b> during the course of disease has been reported, and reevaluation of HER 2 positivity in metastatic/recurrent sites is recommended. The choice of trastuzumab for MUGC is currently based on the <b>HER</b> 2 <b>status</b> of the primary tumor at the time of initial diagnosis, without reassessment of <b>HER</b> 2 <b>status</b> during the course of disease and/or in metastatic/recurrent sites, on the assumption that <b>HER</b> 2 <b>status</b> is stable.

5|$|While {{continuing}} with a slower work-rate, Lombard {{decided to move}} away from comedies and return to dramatic roles. She appeared in a second David O. Selznick production, Made for Each Other (1939), which paired her with James Stewart to play a couple facing domestic difficulties. Reviews for the film were highly positive, and praised Lombard's dramatic effort; financially, it was a disappointment. Lombard's next appearance came opposite Cary Grant in the John Cromwell romance In Name Only (1939), a credit she personally negotiated with RKO Radio Pictures upon hearing of the script and Grant's involvement. The role mirrored her recent experiences, as she played a woman in love with a married man whose wife refuses to divorce.

5|$|According to William of Malmesbury, Æthelstan {{was thirty}} {{years old when he}} came to the throne in 924, which would mean that he was born in about 894.

Very little is known about Ecgwynn, and she is not named in any pre-Conquest source. Medieval chroniclers gave varying {{descriptions}} of her rank: one described her as an ignoble consort of inferior birth, while others described her birth as noble. Modern historians also disagree about <b>her</b> <b>status.</b> Simon Keynes and Richard Abels believe that leading figures in Wessex were unwilling to accept Æthelstan as king in 924 partly because his mother had been Edward the Elder's concubine. However, Barbara Yorke and Sarah Foot argue that allegations that Æthelstan was illegitimate were a product of the dispute over the succession, and that there is no reason to doubt that she was Edward's legitimate wife.
