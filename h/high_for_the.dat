On the stroke of half-time, Iniesta himself then attempted to flick the ball through to Henry, but it was just too <b>high</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> French striker, and referee Massimo Busacca took that cue to blow the whistle for the interval.|$|E

In the 2014 Orlando Classic semifinals against Tennessee on November 28, he posted 16 points. Then in the finals against #20 Michigan State on November 30, he contributed 4 blocks. On December 5 during the Big 12/SEC Challenge contest against Florida, Alexander posted a team-high 10 rebounds along with 12 points for his first collegiate double-double. On December 20, Alexander was {{expected}} to be in the starting lineup for the first time against Lafayette, but he was not. However, he started on December 22 against Temple. On January 19 against #19 Oklahoma, Alexander posted 13 points and 13 rebounds. The 13 rebounds in just 23 minutes played marked a career high for Alexander and an individual season <b>high</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Jayhawks. Alexander was named Big 12 newcomer of the week on January 26, 2015. Alexander made his second start of the season on February 10 against Texas Tech, replacing Jamari Traylor in the lineup and posting 10 points, 4 blocks and 5 rebounds. On February 28, Alexander was inactivated due to an undisclosed NCAA investigation as a precautionary measure. He did not play any games after February 23 because of the investigation of his mother's initiation of pre-NBA draft loan processing.|$|E
5|$|All {{isotopes}} between 242Cm and 248Cm, {{as well as}} 250Cm, {{undergo a}} self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction and thus in principle {{can act as a}} nuclear fuel in a reactor. As in most transuranic elements, the nuclear fission cross section is especially <b>high</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> odd-mass curium isotopes 243Cm, 245Cm and 247Cm. These can be used in thermal-neutron reactors, whereas a mixture of curium isotopes is only suitable for fast breeder reactors since the even-mass isotopes are not fissile in a thermal reactor and accumulate as burn-up increases. The mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel, which is to be used in power reactors, should contain little or no curium because the neutron activation of 248Cm will create californium. This is strong neutron emitter, and would pollute the back end of the fuel cycle and increase the dose to reactor personnel. Hence, if the minor actinides are to be used as fuel in a thermal neutron reactor, the curium should be excluded from the fuel or placed in special fuel rods where it is the only actinide present.|$|E
5|$|As {{the season}} concluded, the obvious {{standout}} draft choice for both leagues was Alabama quarterback Joe Namath. The Houston Oilers, {{in last place}} in the AFL East, had the number-one pick for the AFL. Both the Oilers and Jets realized that the Jets had a far better chance of signing Namath in competition with the NFL team which drafted him (as it turned out, the St. Louis Cardinals, formerly the Chicago Cardinals), and the Jets were able to acquire the number-one pick. Neither the Jets nor the Cardinals could sign Namath until Alabama played its {{final game of the}} season, the Orange Bowl, on January 1, 1965. Both the Jets and Cardinals negotiated with Namath's attorney, and when the price got too <b>high</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Cardinals, the Giants secretly acquired Namath's NFL rights. Longtime Jets coach Walt Michaels admitted many years later that the Jets had signed Namath days before the game. On January 2, 1965, the Jets held a press conference to announce Namath's signing.|$|E

5|$|During the 2014 off-season, Olshey signed center Chris Kaman and two-time former Blazer guard Steve Blake {{to bolster}} the bench. Expectations by sportswriters and analysts were <b>high</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Trail Blazers going into the 2015 NBA season given their {{surprise}} success in 2013–14. The Blazers beat the reigning Northwest Division Champion Oklahoma City Thunder, 106–89, in their season opener at home on October 29, 2014. Like the season before, the Trail Blazers dominated the month of November, at one point winning nine straight games from November 9 to November 26 before being defeated by the Memphis Grizzlies. Injuries, which had not been significant the previous season, started to inflict themselves on various players. Starting center Lopez fractured his right hand {{in a game against}} the Spurs on December 15, 2014, and missed the next 23 games. Initially, the Blazers were much unfazed, winning 129–119 in triple overtime against the Spurs on December 19, a game that saw Lillard and Aldridge combine for 75 points on 29 field goals; Lillard netted a career-high 43 points. Four days later, Lillard hit a three-pointer to tie the game and force overtime against the Thunder en route to 40 points and a 115–111 victory. Three Blazers went to New Orleans for the All Star Weekend: Matthews for the Foot Locker Three-Point Contest, Lillard as a reserve to the All-Star Game, and Aldridge as a starter to the All-Star game.|$|E
5|$|Expectations were <b>high</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 2008 season, but Cleveland {{finished}} {{last in the}} AFC North with a 4–12 record. Anderson shared {{starts with}} Ken Dorsey, who the Browns had acquired by trading away Trent Dilfer, and Brady Quinn, a young quarterback the team drafted in 2007. The Browns never contended during 2008 and failed to score a touchdown in the final six games. Near {{the end of the}} season, two scandals shook the team. It was revealed that several Browns players, including Winslow, were suffering from staph infections, which raised questions about sanitation in the Browns' Berea practice facilities. In November, Savage found himself {{in the center of a}} media storm after an angry e-mail exchange with a fan was published on Deadspin, a sports blog. Shortly after the final game, a 31–0 loss to the Steelers, Lerner fired Savage and, a day later, Crennel.|$|E
5|$|Forbes Field had an {{original}} capacity of 25,000, {{the largest in}} the league at the time. Seating at the stadium was remodeled numerous times, peaking at a capacity of 41,000 in 1925 and closing in 1970 at 35,000seats. On opening day, ticket prices ranged from $1.25 (equal to $ today) for box seats and $1 (equal to $ today) for reserved grand stand sections; temporary bleachers were set up for the occasion and cost $0.50. Ticket prices were considered <b>high</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> day and steel pillars supporting the roof occasionally blocked fans' views of the field. 2,000 bleachers were situated along the left field side, tickets were sold for a maximum of $1. When winning streaks would attract high attendance to games, fans were permitted to sit on the grass in right field, provided they would agree to allow a player to catch any ball hit in the area. The lowest season of attendance came in 1914 when 139,620people attended games; the highest at the stadium came in 1960, when 1,705,828people watched the Pirates play. On September 23, 1956, the stadium's largest crowd, 44,932, gathered to see the home team play the Brooklyn Dodgers. The game was cut short {{in the top of the}} ninth inning, after a rain delay forced it past the Pennsylvania Sunday curfew. The Dodgers won the game 8–2 the following day. At 200people, June 10, 1938 marked the smallest crowd to ever attend a Pirates game.
