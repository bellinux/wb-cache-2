5|$|An {{application}} that has almost <b>fallen</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{use with the}} introduction of affordable superconducting magnets is the use of europium complexes, such as Eu(fod)3, as shift reagents in NMR spectroscopy. Chiral shift reagents, such as Eu(hfc)3, are still used to determine enantiomeric purity.|$|E
5|$|Centuries later, {{the region}} around Salerno {{was the only}} {{exception}} to the rule that (except for skipping units that had regionally <b>fallen</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> use) the apothecaries' ounce was subdivided down to the scruple {{in exactly the same way}} as in the Roman system: It divided the ounce into 10drachms.|$|E

5|$|City were relegated {{back into}} the First Division for the 2001–02 season and Kevin Keegan {{replaced}} Joe Royle as manager. Dickov found his first team opportunities at the club limited especially as the team had other strikers such as Paulo Wanchope, Shaun Goater and Darren Huckerby. Having <b>fallen</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> favour, on 22 February 2002 he moved to Leicester City for £150,000.|$|E
5|$|Following Marsh, Ceratopsia has {{usually been}} {{classified}} as a suborder within the order Ornithischia. While ranked taxonomy has largely <b>fallen</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> favor among dinosaur paleontologists, some researchers have continued to employ such a classification, though sources have differed on what its rank should be. Most who still employ the use of ranks have retained its traditional ranking of suborder, though some have reduced {{to the level of}} infraorder.|$|E

In 1853, Pickett challenged a fellow junior officer, future Union general Winfield Scott Hancock, to a duel; (they had met only briefly when Hancock was passing through Texas). Hancock declined the duel, a response not unlikely as dueling had <b>fallen</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> favor at the time.|$|E
5|$|In organic chemistry, lead(II) nitrate {{has been}} used as an oxidant, for example as an {{alternative}} to the Sommelet reaction for oxidation of benzylic halides to aldehydes. It has also found use in the preparation of isothiocyanates from dithiocarbamates. Because of its toxicity it has largely <b>fallen</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> favour, but it still finds occasional use, for example as a bromide scavenger during SN1 substitution.|$|E
5|$|Lacaille gave six stars Bayer designations, {{labeling}} them Alpha (α) to Zeta (ζ) in 1756, but omitted Epsilon (ε) and designated two adjacent {{stars as}} Gamma (γ).

Caelum is too far south for any of its stars to bear Flamsteed designations.|$|E

He replaced Manstein, who had <b>fallen</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> favour with Hitler. Despite Manstein's previous victories, the Führer wanted someone whom he anticipated would be unyielding in defence.|$|E
5|$|Philosophical behaviorism has <b>fallen</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> favor {{since the}} latter half of the 20th century, coinciding with the rise of cognitivism. Cognitivists reject behaviorism due to several {{perceived}} problems. For example, behaviorism could be said to be counter-intuitive when it maintains that someone is talking about behavior in the event that a person is experiencing a painful headache.|$|E
5|$|The Custer Trail, {{named for}} General George Armstrong Custer, {{was created in}} 1917 along a series of roads between Grand Rapids and Ft. Wayne, Indiana that {{included}} the modern M-37. Custer commanded the Michigan Cavalry Bridge during the Civil War, and he was wildly popular in the state after the war. The road {{that bears his name}} never achieved that level of popularity. By 1930, the name had already <b>fallen</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> use.|$|E

5|$|The road {{had been}} {{proposed}} since the 1960s, {{as part of}} the London Ringways, and was an important link between central London and the Docklands to East Anglia. However, road protests elsewhere had become increasingly visible, and urban road building had <b>fallen</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> favour with the public. Local Member of Parliament Harry Cohen had been a vocal opponent of this scheme.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} {{view of a}} {{much larger}} 4th century army has <b>fallen</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> favour with some historians in more recent times, as existing evidence has been reappraised and new evidence uncovered. The revisionist view is that the 4th-century army was, at its peak, roughly {{the same size as the}} 2nd-century one and considerably smaller in the late 4th century.|$|E
5|$|This {{debate is}} still ongoing; at this time, Scelidosaurus is {{considered}} to be either more closely related to ankylosaurids than to stegosaurids and, by extension, a true ankylosaur, or basal to the ankylosaur-stegosaur split. The stegosaur classification has <b>fallen</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> favor, but is seen in older dinosaur books. Cladistic analyses have invariably recovered a basal position for Scelidosaurus, outside of the Eurypoda.|$|E

5|$|Although {{traditionally}} {{depicted as}} a biped, {{it has been suggested}} since the mid-1970s that Spinosaurus was at least an occasional quadruped. This has been bolstered by the discovery of Baryonyx, a relative with robust arms. Because of the mass of the hypothesized fatty dorsal humps of Spinosaurus, Bailey (1997) was open to the possibility of a quadrupedal posture, leading to new restorations of it as such. The hypothesis that Spinosaurus had a typical quadrupedal gait has <b>fallen</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> favor, though spinosaurids may have crouched in a quadrupedal posture.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1944, the M3 had <b>fallen</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> favor {{even with}} {{airborne}} troops, despite their strong preference for {{compact and lightweight}} weapon systems. The Airborne Command had rejected the 57mm M1 {{in the summer of}} 1943 claiming its unfitness for airlifting and the Table of Organisation and Equipment (TO) of February 1944 still had airborne divisions keeping their 37mm guns. Nevertheless, the 82nd and the 101st, were reequipped with British-manufactured 6-pounder gun (57mm) on carriage Mk III (designed to fit into the British Horsa glider) for the Normandy airdrops. This change was officially introduced in the TO of December 1944.|$|E
