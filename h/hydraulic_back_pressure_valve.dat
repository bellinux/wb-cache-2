40|$|Recent studies {{indicate}} carbon dioxide (R 744) as a valid alternative to classical substances such as HFCs used in vapour compression plants. However a transcritical refrigeration cycle is needed because the critical temperature {{of carbon dioxide}} is usually near the ambient temperature. Consequently the carbon dioxide refrigerator performances are significantly influenced by the heat rejection pressure. In this paper an experimental investigation on working optimization for a "split-system" to cool air in residential applications is presented: by varying the heat rejection pressure an optimum working condition has been found at different ambient temperatures. Furthermore a simplified model to predict the optimum heat rejection pressure is shown and a comparison with experimental results is carried out.

30|$|Almost all the {{previous}} studies (Adenutsi et al. 2018; Ali et al. 1987; Fatt 1953; Gawish and Al-Homadhi 2008; Jones et al. 2001; Thomas and Ward 1972; Wilson 1956) on stress sensitivity of relative permeability curves {{read in the}} literature were conducted by varying confining stress, which simulates overburden pressure. However, in a real oilfield situation, changes in net stress due to hydrocarbon production or fluid injection operations are induced by changes in pore pressure rather than overburden pressure. Meanwhile, Al-Quraishi and Khairy (2005) studied the effect of pore pressure variation at a constant overburden pressure of 17.3  MPa on relative permeability by the unsteady state method. A <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>valve</b> in the core flooding rig was used to vary pore pressures at 0.1, 3.5, 6.9, and 13.8  MPa, while injecting at a constant rate of 1.5  mL/min. This investigation was performed on Berea sandstones using crude oil and synthetic brine made of 3 % NaCl. The study revealed a decreasing trend in oil relative permeability and minimal changes in water relative permeability as pore pressure was increased. The initial water saturation mainly decreased as pore pressure increased except at 13.8  MPa, but residual oil saturation showed a complicated trend. In addition, as pore pressure increased, both end-point oil and water saturations initially increased and subsequently decreased.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, the {{pressure}} {{difference between the}} anode and cathode compartments of a polymer electrolyte mem-brane (PEM) fuel cell stack is regulated along with the anode and cathode humidities using an anode recirculation system. The pressure regulation requirement stems from membrane safety considerations. The regulation of average humidities in the two compartments is a necessary (although not a sufficient) require-ment for stack water management. Two actuators in the anode recirculation system are considered, namely the dry hydrogen flow and the anode <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>valve.</b> These actuators are adjusted using a static output feedback controller that relies on pressure and humidity measurements on the anode side of the fuel cell stack. As the water mass dynamics and the character-istics of the water transport through the PEM are significantly different between subsaturated conditions (water is present only in vapor phase) and saturated conditions (liquid water along with water vapor), we show that {{the performance of the}} static output feedback controller with a fixed set of gains for subsaturated condition deteriorates significantly under a saturated condition. A gain-scheduled controller is therefore developed to compensate for a water-vapor saturated cathode condition. Analysis and sim-ulation provide insights on some of the design and implementation issues for the gain-scheduled output feedback system.

In all of these systems the exhaust gas was tapped off before the turbine, cooled and mixed with the intake air after the compressor and aftercooler. The systems differed (mainly) in the method used {{to set up a}} positive pressure difference across the EGR circuit. This was done either by the use of an exhaust <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>valve</b> in the exhaust, or by using a turbocharger with variable nozzle turbine (VNT) geometry, or by combining such a VNT turbocharger with a venturi-mixer that was positioned in the intake manifold such as to provide extra suction power to the EGR gas. The emissions behaviour and efficiency with these different EGR systems were tested in a number of engine working points, including key points of the AVL 8 -mode US FTP cycle simulation. The results indicate that for achieving 1998 emission levels, a VNT only would be the most efficient solution. For achieving 2004 emission levels, combining the VNT with a venturi-mixer could give a further fuel consumption benefit. Particulate matter emisisons will however be unacceptable, making the use of additional particulate reducing technology necessary. A measure of venturi-mixer effienciency is proposed and a new, compact and efficient venturi-mixer design is presented.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study to}} enhance and improve a zero liquid discharge (ZLD) reverse osmosis process that uses seed crystals to promote crystallization of the dissolved salts in the residual brine while it is being treated by identifying those membrane materials that are most suitable for the process. In the study, a one plate SEPA Cell module by GE Osmonics {{was used to determine}} which membranes were most susceptible to fouling and/or membrane hydrolysis. A cellulose acetate (CA), polyamide (PA) low MWCO, and PA high MWCO membrane were tested under reverse osmosis conditions. The CA and thin film (TF) membranes were also tested for nanofiltration. The cell was operated under conditions that were determined to be optimum for each membrane by the manufacturer, GE Osmonics. A high pressure, low flow, positive displacement diaphragm pump circulated the saturated calcium sulfate solution with 2 % suspended solids through the cell while the reject and permeate were recycled back to the feed, thereby preserving a saturated solution to promote crystal growth and simulate the seeded reverse osmosis process. The temperature was maintained constant by adding an ice pack to the feed vessel when necessary. The transmembrane pressure differential was maintained constant by adjusting a <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>valve</b> on the concentrate outlet. The results illustrate that if potable drinking water is the intended use, then the nanofiltration cellulose acetate membrane should be used. If irrigation is the desired use, then the nanofiltration thin film membrane should be used. Overall, the reverse osmosis cellulose acetate membrane was observed to outperform all membranes when all performance parameters were normalized. However, this membrane was observed to be prone to degradation in a seeded slurry and therefore its lifetime should be analyzed further. The polyamide membrane initially had a high water transport coefficient, but fouling led to its rapid decline which was attributed to the membrane?s rough and protrusive surface. A lifetime test on the thin film and cellulose acetate revealed that when operated at their maximum pressure specified by GE Osmonics for a duration of 8 hours that no decrease in rejection occurred...|$|R
40|$|The use of turbochargers on both {{gasoline}} and diesel engines is started {{to become a}} common strategy to comply with stringent limits on CO 2. The main action towards lowering fuel consumption of powertrains is achieved by reduction of engine size and number of cylinders, annexed to the lower friction. However, this is directly linked to the worsening of deliverable output power under the natural aspirated configuration. Therefore, turbocharging is often adopted to overcome this problem where useful energy contained in the exhaust gasses is used to increase the air density at the intake. The increase in power from a natural aspirated configuration is {{a direct consequence of}} higher fuel quantity to be injected. In order to pursue a systematic evaluation of the powertrain system, engine, turbochargers and auxiliary components are included into 1 D models. Several conditions can be simulated without the need of an extensive test plan. In 1 D software like Ricardo Wave, turbochargers performance are imposed as input. These are previously measured in appropriate turbocharger gas-stand where hot or cold air is blown through the turbine while load on compressor is controlled by adjusting a <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>valve.</b> Compressor and turbine maps are generated for constant speed lines which are corrected for total temperature. Pressure ratio, mass flow and isentropic efficiency are also monitored as parameters to characterize performance maps of turbomachinery. In gas-stands, steady flow conditions are imposed at compressor and turbine. However, in turbocharged engines, pulsating flows induced by the engine valvetrain disturb continuously turbocharger conditions during the engine cycle. In fact, the effects that the conditions of the engine air-path could have on the turbocharger operations are excluded from the system modelling. In this study, an appropriate engine gas-stand has been developed in order to improve the accuracy on estimating the turbine extraction power in 1 D powertrain simulations. In addition, future analyses on turbocharger transient operations could be investigated. The compressor outlet has been disconnected from the 2. 2 L Diesel engine intake so that the load on turbocharger and engine can be independently controlled. In order to extend the engine capability in delivering mass flow and pressure at the turbine inlet, an external boost rig has been installed with the capability to control pressure, mass flow and temperature at the engine intake. In a first instance, a 1 D model of the system including turbomachinery, Diesel engine and boost rig has been developed using the commercial platform Ricardo Wave. In this way, a preliminary DoE study of the entire system has been performed in order to evaluate the effects of parameters and actuators on the turbocharger operations. Additionally, the control of the rig has been tested by confirming the previous DoE study. Approaches to create turbochargers maps are shown.

40|$|Steam {{is highly}} used {{in most of}} the industries. There are many {{occasions}} where low pressure steam is used. Most of the times, relatively higher pressure is generated, transported and finally the pressure is reduced before use. Throttling devices are used for reducing <b>pressure.</b> Throttling <b>valves</b> or <b>pressure</b> reducing <b>valves</b> have been used for this work {{in most of the}} instances. There is a huge potential of utilizing this energy by introducing <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> steam turbines. If the turbine exhaust pressure can be further dropped, power generation through the steam turbine can be increased. This research project was created to cover these areas. There is no literature which can be used to calculate the power output of a turbine with known flow rates and input and output conditions. This project is aimed to give the information how much power is generated under the given conditions. This can be used for selecting a suitable <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> turbine for the particular requirement. Giving the capital investment for such project also was an objective. It can be decided whether the selected project on retrofitting <b>pressure</b> reducing <b>valves</b> with the steam turbines is viable. There is no sufficient information on performance of thermo-compressors which can be used for increasing steam pressure. There is an objective of finding out the motive flow required for the known suction flow at known input and output conditions. As the title of the research shows, ultimate objective {{of this study was to}} see whether combining thermo-compressors to reduce <b>back</b> <b>pressures</b> is feasible or not. This research project was done for five input steam conditions and six output steam conditions of the turbines. For a selected turbine, performance at known pressures was calculated. This information was graphically represented to give a clear picture. Similarly performance of thermo-compressors was calculated for known input and conditions. This information also was graphically represented. Finally the performance of the <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> turbines were calculated when the <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> dropped further by introducing thermo-compressors. Calculated values were graphically represented to check whether this was a viable option. As per the outcome of this project, guide lines were made for <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> steam turbines with different input and output conditions. As the input, superheated steam varying from 10 barg at 350 deg. C up to 50 barg at 450 deg. C have been considered. Turbine exhaust pressures varying from 1 bara to 6 bara also have been considered. Guide lines were extended to show the cost of investment to retrofit <b>pressure</b> reducing <b>valves</b> with <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> turbines. Guide lines were made on the amount of motive pressure consumed to increase the pressure of steam at different input and output conditions. These guidelines also were extended to show the capital investment of the installing thermo-compressors. Process steam pressures varying from 2 bara to 6 bara have been discussed against turbine exhaust pressures varying from 1 bara to 6 bara under the study of the behavior of the <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> steam turbines combined with thermo-compressors. Further study was done to ensure whether there is any effect of the isentropic efficiency and the generator efficiency on this behavior. Finally, it was proved that there was no benefit of operating the <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> steam turbines at lower exhaust pressure by introducing thermocompressors and increasing the pressure before giving to the process for the pressure and temperature ranges covered in this study. Retrofitting of PRV with steam turbines seems to be an attractive option. This study discussed only the application of superheated steam. Further studies can be extended to saturated steam to use single stage steam turbines. Introducing of thermo-compressors for specific industries also can be done as a further study.

The aim of the present study is to analyze the clinical outcome of patients with shunt dependent posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus after aneurysmatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in order to identify patients who would benefit from a simple differential <b>pressure</b> <b>valve.</b> Methods: From 2000 to 2013, 547 patients with aneurysmatic SAH were treated at our institution, 114 underwent ventricular shunt placement (21. 1 %). 47 patients with available pre- and post-operative computed tomography scans, and an available follow-up of minimum 6 months were included. In order to measure the survival time which a nonprogrammable differential <b>pressure</b> <b>valve</b> would have had in an individual patient we defined the initial equalized shunt survival time (IESS). IESS is the time until surgical revisions of fixed differential <b>pressure</b> or flow-regulated <b>valves</b> for the treatment of over- or under-drainage as well as re-programming of adjustable valves due to over- or under-drainage. Results: Twenty patients were treated with fixed differential <b>pressure</b> <b>valves,</b> 15 patients were treated with flow-regulated valves, and 12 underwent ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement with differential <b>pressure</b> <b>valves</b> assisted by a gravitational unit. Patients who reacted with remarkable changes of the ventricular width after the insertion of external ventricular drainage (EVD), before shunt placement, showed a significantly longer IESS. Conclusions: Decline of the ventricular width after EVD placement was a predictor for successful VP shunt therapy in the later course of disease. Possibly, this could allow identifying patients who benefit from a simple differential <b>pressure</b> <b>valve</b> or a flow-regulated valve, and thus could possibly avoid valve-associated complications of a programmable valve in the later course of disease...|$|R
