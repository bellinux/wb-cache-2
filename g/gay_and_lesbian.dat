40|$|In this Article I comment upon Professor Terry Kogan 2 ̆ 7 s paper 2 ̆ 2 Legislative Violence Against <b>Lesbians</b> <b>and</b> <b>Gay</b> Men, 2 ̆ 2 {{in which}} he {{analyzes}} the legislative process surrounding the passage of hate crimes legislation in Utah. Through {{an analysis of the}} gay bashing that took place within the legislative debate, Professor Kogan argues that the Utah legislature 2 ̆ 7 s removal of all references to <b>gays</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> in the legislation was significant both because it reinforced sterotypical and negative perceptions of <b>gays</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbians,</b> <b>and</b> because it suggested that violence against <b>gays</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbians</b> was, at best, not of concern to, and at worst, actively encouraged by, the state. While Professor Kogan 2 ̆ 7 s paper raises a number of interesting issues, I would like to focus on some of the broader themes concerning law and violence raised by the many ways we might interpret hate crimes statutes in the context of violence against <b>gays</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbians...</b>|$|R

5|$|Australia allows gay men {{and lesbians}} to serve openly. Openly <b>gay</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> {{personnel}} were banned from the ADF until November 1992 when the Australian Government decided to remove this prohibition. The heads of the services and most military personnel opposed this change at the time, and it caused considerable public debate. Opponents of lifting the ban on <b>gay</b> <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> personnel argued that doing so would greatly harm the ADF's cohesiveness and cause large numbers of resignations. This did not eventuate, and the reform caused relatively few problems. A 2000 study found that lifting the ban on gay service did not have any negative effects on the ADF's morale, effectiveness or recruitment and retention, and may have led to increased productivity and improved working environments.|$|E
