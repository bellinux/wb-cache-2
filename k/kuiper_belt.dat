5|$|Makemake (45.79AU average), {{although}} {{smaller than}} Pluto, {{is the largest}} known object in the classical <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> (that is, a <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> object not in a confirmed resonance with Neptune). Makemake is the brightest object in the <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> after Pluto. It was named and designated a dwarf planet in 2008. Its orbit is far more inclined than Pluto's, at 29°.|$|E
5|$|Pluto (minor-planet designation: 134340 Pluto) is a dwarf {{planet in}} the <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt,</b> a ring of bodies beyond Neptune. It was the first <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> object to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|Neptune's orbit has a {{profound}} impact on the region directly beyond it, known as the <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt.</b> The <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> is a ring of small icy worlds, similar to the asteroid belt but far larger, extending from Neptune's orbit at 30AU out to about 55AU from the Sun. Much {{in the same way that}} Jupiter's gravity dominates the asteroid belt, shaping its structure, so Neptune's gravity dominates the <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt.</b> Over the age of the Solar System, certain regions of the <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> became destabilised by Neptune's gravity, creating gaps in the Kuiper belt's structure. The region between 40 and 42AU is an example.|$|E

5000|$|Transits of Mercury and Venus {{have been}} {{observed}} as analogues of extrasolar transits. As Mercury and Venus transits are far closer and thus appear [...] "deeper," [...] they can be studied in far finer detail. Similarly, analogues to our asteroid and <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belts</b> {{have been observed}} around other star systems, though in far less detail.|$|R
50|$|While the {{majority}} of plutinos have low orbital inclinations, {{a substantial number of}} them follow orbits similar to that of Pluto, with inclinations in the 10-25° range and eccentricities around 0.2-0.25, resulting in perihelia inside (or close to) the orbit of Neptune and aphelia close to the main <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt's</b> outer edge (where objects have 1:2 resonance with Neptune).|$|R
5|$|On January 19, 2006, {{the first}} {{spacecraft}} {{to explore the}} <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt,</b> New Horizons, was launched, which flew by Pluto on July 14, 2015. Beyond the Pluto flyby, the mission's goal was to locate and investigate other, farther objects in the <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> {{is a great}} ring {{of debris}} similar to the {{asteroid}} belt, but consisting mainly of objects composed primarily of ice. It extends between 30 and 50AU from the Sun. Though it is estimated to contain anything from dozens to thousands of dwarf planets, it is composed mainly of small Solar System bodies. Many of the larger <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> objects, such as Quaoar, Varuna, and Orcus, {{may prove to be}} dwarf planets with further data. There are estimated to be over 100,000 <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> objects with a diameter greater than 50km, but the total mass of the <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> is thought to be only a tenth or even a hundredth the mass of Earth. Many <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> objects have multiple satellites, and most have orbits that take them outside the plane of the ecliptic.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> was {{initially}} {{thought to be}} the source of the Solar System's ecliptic comets. However, studies of the region since 1992 have shown that the orbits within the <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> are relatively stable, and that ecliptic comets originate from the scattered disc, where orbits are generally less stable.|$|E
50|$|The {{star has}} a low {{effective}} temperature (roughly 2700 K) but a large and bloated radius of 370 solar radii and a high luminosity, 7,000 {{times higher than the}} Sun. If the Sun were replaced with U Orionis, its radius would extend beyond Mars's orbital zone (about 1.7 astronomical units), and, to be habitable with water at liquid state and a comfortable temperature, a planet would have to be located within 85 AU, within the <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt's</b> orbital zone.|$|R
40|$|The present {{status of}} our {{knowledge}} about the accretion process of Uranus and Neptune is discussed, emphasising in the possible origin of the orbital structure {{at the time of}} formation of the outer solar system. The most important influences of this process over the entire solar system are also discussed: in the inner planetary region, contributing to the formation of the planetary atmospheres and water reservoirs; in the asteroid and <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belts,</b> sculpting their primordial structures, and in {{the outer edge of the}} solar system, building up the Oort cloud of comets...|$|R
50|$|Studies of ring systems {{inform us}} of many-body dynamics. This is {{applicable}} to the asteroid and <b>Kuiper</b> <b>Belts,</b> and the early Solar System, which had more objects, dust, and gas. It is relevant to the magnetospherics of those bodies. It is also relevant to the dynamics of our galaxy and others. In turn, though the Saturnian system is readily studied (by Cassini, ground telescopes, and space telescopes), the simpler and lower mass ring systems of the other giants makes their explanations somewhat easier to fathom. The Jupiter ring system is perhaps more completely understood at present {{than any of the}} other three.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the closest}} scattered-disc objects {{approach}} the Sun at about 30–35AU, their orbits can extend well beyond 100AU. This makes scattered objects {{among the most}} distant and coldest objects in the Solar System. The innermost portion of the scattered disc overlaps with a torus-shaped region of orbiting objects traditionally called the <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt,</b> but its outer limits reach much further away from the Sun and further {{above and below the}} ecliptic than the <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> proper.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{conducted}} {{since the}} trans-Neptunian region was first charted {{have shown that}} the region now called the <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> is not the point of origin of short-period comets, but that they instead derive from a linked population called the scattered disc. The scattered disc was created when Neptune migrated outward into the proto-Kuiper belt, which at the time was much closer to the Sun, and left in its wake a population of dynamically stable objects that could never be affected by its orbit (the <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> proper), and a population whose perihelia are close enough that Neptune can still disturb them as it travels around the Sun (the scattered disc). Because the scattered disc is dynamically active and the <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> relatively dynamically stable, the scattered disc is now seen as the most likely point of origin for periodic comets.|$|E
5|$|At its fullest extent (but {{excluding}} the scattered disc), including its outlying regions, the <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> stretches from roughly 30 to 55 AU. The {{main body of}} the belt is generally accepted to extend from the 2:3 mean-motion resonance (see below) at 39.5 AU to the 1:2 resonance at roughly 48 AU. The <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> is quite thick, with the main concentration extending as much as ten degrees outside the ecliptic plane and a more diffuse distribution of objects extending several times farther. Overall it more resembles a torus or doughnut than a belt. Its mean position is inclined to the ecliptic by 1.86 degrees.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect that}} a close stellar encounter {{would have on the}} growing scattered disk and Oort cloud. Such an encounter has been suggested byMelita et al. as the cause of the <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt’s</b> outer edge. Thus, we restrict our study to encounters that could have caused such a structure. We find that we probably can rule out all such encounters that occurred either at or subsequent to 10 million years after the Oort cloud started to form. In our simulations, these encounters either produce an extended scattered disk that is too populous to be consistent with observations or produce an Oort cloud that is too anemic...|$|R
40|$|Many main-sequence stars possess tenuous circumstellar dust clouds {{believed}} to trace extrasolar analogs of the Sun's asteroid and <b>Kuiper</b> <b>Belts.</b> While {{most of these}} "debris disks" are known only from far-infrared photometry, {{a growing number of}} them are now spatially resolved. In this contribution, I review recent imaging results on debris disk structures from the Hubble, Spitzer, and Herschel Space Telescopes. Specific cases of disk interactions with imaged and radial velocity exoplanets will be discussed. I will show how combined modeling of the optical and infrared datasets can place strong constraints on dust particle properties in the disks. Future developments in debris disk imaging will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} Superparticle Model/Algorithm for Collisions in <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belts</b> and debris disks (SMACK), a new method for {{simultaneously}} modeling, in 3 -D, the collisional and dynamical evolution of planetesimals in a debris disk with planets. SMACK can simulate azimuthal asymmetries {{and how these}} asymmetries evolve over time. We show that SMACK is stable to numerical viscosity and numerical heating over 10 (exp 7) yr, and that it can reproduce analytic models of disk evolution. We use SMACK to model {{the evolution of a}} debris ring containing a planet on an eccentric orbit. Differential precession creates a spiral structure as the ring evolves, but collisions subsequently break up the spiral, leaving a narrower eccentric ring...|$|R
5|$|Classes {{of small}} Solar System bodies {{in other regions}} are the near-Earth objects, the centaurs, the <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> objects, the {{scattered}} disc objects, the sednoids, and the Oort cloud objects.|$|E
5|$|Makemake is {{currently}} visually the second-brightest <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> object after Pluto, having a March opposition apparent magnitude of 17.0 {{in the constellation}} Coma Berenices. This is bright enough to be visible using a high-end amateur telescope.|$|E
5|$|The dwarf planet Pluto (39AU average) is {{the largest}} known object in the <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt.</b> When {{discovered}} in 1930, it {{was considered to be}} the ninth planet; this changed in 2006 with the adoption of a formal definition of planet. Pluto has a relatively eccentric orbit inclined 17 degrees to the ecliptic plane and ranging from 29.7AU from the Sun at perihelion (within the orbit of Neptune) to 49.5AU at aphelion. Pluto has a 3:2 resonance with Neptune, meaning that Pluto orbits twice round the Sun for every three Neptunian orbits. <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> objects whose orbits share this resonance are called plutinos.|$|E

In this talk, I'll review what is currently known about the structure of debris disks. Using images from the Hubble, Spitzer, and Herschel Space Telescopes, I will show how modeling of these resolved systems can place strong constraints on dust particle properties in the disks. Some of the disks show disturbed structures suggestive of planetary perturbations: specific cases will be discussed where directly-imaged exoplanets are clearly affecting debris disk structure. I'll conclude with thoughts on the future of high contrast exoplanet imaging...|$|R

40|$|The Search for <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belts</b> Around Radial-velocity Planet Stars - SKARPS -is a Herschel {{survey of}} solar-type stars {{known to have}} {{orbiting}} planets. When complete, the 100 -star SKARPS sample will be large enough for a meaningful statistical comparison against stars not known to have planets. (This control sample has already been observed by Herschel's DUst around NEarby Stars - DUNES - key program). Initial results include previously known disks that are resolved {{for the first time}} and newly discovered disks that are fainter and colder than those typically detected by Spitzer. So far, with only half of the sample in hand, there is no measured correlation between inner RV planets and cold outer debris. While this is consistent with the results from Spitzer, it is in contrast with the relationship suggested by the prominent debris disks in imaged-planet systems...|$|R
5|$|The overall {{structure}} of the charted regions of the Solar System consists of the Sun, four relatively small inner planets surrounded by a belt of mostly rocky asteroids, and four giant planets surrounded by the <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> of mostly icy objects. Astronomers sometimes informally divide this structure into separate regions. The inner Solar System includes the four terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt. The outer Solar System is beyond the asteroids, including the four giant planets. Since {{the discovery of the}} <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt,</b> the outermost parts of the Solar System are considered a distinct region consisting of the objects beyond Neptune.|$|E
5|$|The {{scattered}} disc {{is still}} poorly understood: no {{model of the}} formation of the <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> and the scattered disc has yet been proposed that explains all their observed properties.|$|E
5|$|Although Pluto is {{currently}} the largest known KBO, {{there is at least}} one known larger object currently outside the <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> that probably originated in it: Neptune's moon Triton (which, as explained above, is probably a captured KBO).|$|E
40|$|The exocometary {{origin of}} CO gas has been {{confirmed}} in several extrasolar <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belts,</b> with CO ice abundances consistent with Solar System comets. We here present a molecular survey of the β Pictoris belt with the Submillimeter Array (SMA), reporting upper limits for CN, HCN, HCO^+, N_ 2 H^+ and H_ 2 CO, {{as well as for}} H_ 2 S, CH_ 3 OH, SiO and DCN from archival ALMA data. Non-detections can be attributed to rapid molecular photodissociation due to the A-star's strong UV flux. CN is the longest-lasting and most easily detectable molecule after CO in this environment. We update our NLTE excitation model to include UV fluorescence, finding it {{plays a key role in}} CO and CN excitation, and use it to turn the SMA CN/CO flux ratio constraint into an upper limit of < 2. 5...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{discovery}} of four new uranian irregular satellites in our deep, mR 2 ̆ 23 c 25. 4, optical search around that planet. The orbital properties of these satellites are diverse. There is some grouping of inclinations {{and one of the}} satellites appears to be inside the Kozai resonant zone of Uranus. Further, we find that the differential size distribution of satellites is rather shallow compared to objects in the asteroid and <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belts,</b> going as 2 ̆ 23 cr 2 ̆ 2122. 4. We also report a strong coupling between semi-major axis and orbital eccentricity. We comment on the apparent paradox between the inclination grouping, shallow size distribution, and orbital correlation as they relate to the likelihood of a collisional origin for the uranian irregulars. The currently observed irregulars appear to be consistent with a disruptive formation process and a collisional origin for Uranus' obliquity. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
50|$|Evidence for the LHB {{derives from}} lunar samples brought {{back by the}} Apollo astronauts. Isotopic dating of Moon's rocks implies that most impact melts {{occurred}} in a rather narrow interval of time. Several hypotheses attempt to explain the apparent spike in the flux of impactors (i.e. asteroids and comets) in the inner Solar System, but no consensus yet exists. The Nice model, popular among planetary scientists, postulates that the giant planets underwent orbital migration and in doing so, scattered objects in the asteroid and/or <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belts</b> into eccentric orbits, and {{into the path of}} the terrestrial planets. Other researchers argue that the lunar sample data do not require a cataclysmic cratering event near 3.9 Ga, and that the apparent clustering of impact-melt ages near this time is an artifact of sampling materials retrieved from a single large impact basin. They also note that the rate of impact cratering could differ significantly between the outer and inner zones of the Solar System.|$|R
5|$|As of December 2009, the {{smallest}} <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> object detected is 980 m across. It is too dim (magnitude 35) {{to be seen}} by Hubble directly, but it was detected by Hubbles star tracking system when it occulted a star.|$|E
5|$|Comets {{usually have}} highly {{eccentric}} elliptical orbits, {{and they have}} a wide range of orbital periods, ranging from several years to potentially several millions of years. Short-period comets originate in the <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> or its associated scattered disc, which lie beyond the orbit of Neptune. Long-period comets are thought to originate in the Oort cloud, a spherical cloud of icy bodies extending from outside the <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> to halfway to the nearest star. Long-period comets are set in motion towards the Sun from the Oort cloud by gravitational perturbations caused by passing stars and the galactic tide. Hyperbolic comets may pass once through the inner Solar System before being flung to interstellar space. The appearance of a comet is called an apparition.|$|E
5|$|Moons in {{retrograde}} orbits cannot form in {{the same}} region of the solar nebula as the planets they orbit, so Triton must have been captured from elsewhere. It might therefore have originated in the <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt,</b> a ring of small icy objects extending outwards from just inside the orbit of Neptune to about 50AU from the Sun. Thought to be the point of origin {{for the majority of}} short-period comets observed from Earth, the belt is also home to several large, planet-like bodies including Pluto, which is now recognized as the largest in a population of <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belt</b> objects (the plutinos) locked in orbital step with Neptune. Triton is only slightly larger than Pluto and nearly identical in composition, which has led to the hypothesis that the two share a common origin.|$|E
40|$|Ultraviolet {{radiation}} from the central star or from a nearby massive star heats the surfaces of protoplanetary disks and causes the outer, less gravitationally bound part of the disks, to photoevaporate into interstellar space. Photoevaporation is likely the most important dispersal mechanism for the outer regions of disks. We focus in this talk on disks around low-mass stars like the Sun rather than high-mass stars, which we have treated previously. Stars often form in clusters and the ultraviolet flux from the most luminous star in the cluster can have a dramatic effect on the disk orbiting a nearby low-mass star. We apply our theoretical models to the evaporating protoplanetary disks (or "proplyds") in the Trapezium cluster in Orion, {{to the formation of}} gas giant planets like Jupiter around Sun-like stars in the Galaxy, and to the formation of <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belts</b> around low mass stars. We discuss recent models {{of the effects of the}} {{radiation from}} the central low mass star including both the predicted infrared spectra from the heated disks as well as preliminary results on the photoevaporation rates...|$|R
40|$|Far-infrared Herschel {{images of}} the epsilon Eridani system, seen at {{a fifth of the}} Sun's present age, resolve two belts of debris emission. Fits to the 160 mum PACS image yield radial spans for these belts of 12 - 16 and 54 - 68 AU. The south end of the outer belt is ≈ 10 % {{brighter}} than the north end in the PACS+SPIRE images at 160, 250, and 350 mum, indicating a pericenter glow attributable to a planet "c. " From this asymmetry and an upper bound on the offset of the belt center, this second planet should be mildly eccentric (ec ≈ 0. 03 - 0. 3). Compared to the asteroid and <b>Kuiper</b> <b>Belts</b> of the young Sun, the epsilon Eri belts are intermediate in brightness and more similar to each other, with up to 20 km sized collisional fragments in the inner belt totaling ≈ 5 % of an Earth mass. This reservoir may feed the hot dust close to the star and could send many impactors through the Habitable Zone, especially if it is being perturbed by the suspected planet epsilon Eri b, at semi-major axis ≈ 3 AU. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|We first {{review the}} {{evidence}} {{pertaining to the}} lifetimes of planet-forming disks {{of gas and dust}} around young stars and discuss possible disk dispersal mechanisms: 1) viscous accretion of material onto the central source, 2) close stellar encounters, 3) stellar winds, and 4) photoevaporation caused by the heating of the disk surface by ultraviolet radiation. Photoevaporation is likely the most important dispersal mechanism for the outer regions of disks, and this talk focuses on the evaporation caused by the presence of a nearby, luminous star rather than the central star itself. We also focus on disks around low-mass stars like the Sun rather than high-mass stars, which we have treated previously. Stars often form in clusters and the ultraviolet flux from the most luminous star in the cluster can have a dramatic effect on the disk orbiting a nearby low-mass star. We apply our theoretical models to the evaporating protoplanetary disks (or "proplyds") in the Trapezium cluster in Orion, to the formation of gas giant planets like Jupiter around Sun-like stars in the Galaxy, and to the formation of <b>Kuiper</b> <b>belts</b> around low mass stars. We find a possible explanation for the differences between Neptune and Jupiter, and make a prediction concerning recent searches for giant planets in large clusters. We discuss recent models of the infrared spectra from gaseous disks around young stars...|$|R
