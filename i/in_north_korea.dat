5|$|The tobacco {{industry}} <b>in</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> is substantial, with 53,000 hectares (2.3 {{percent of its}} arable land) dedicated to tobacco cultivation.

This is despite 31% of North Koreans being malnourished. The best, strongest and most expensive tobacco comes from the north of the country near the border with China.|$|E

5|$|Along its path, Goni killed 74people {{and left}} $831.7million (USD) in damage. On Guam, {{one of the}} first landmasses affected, heavy {{rainfall}} caused flooding and power outages. Across northern Luzon in the Philippines, Goni also dropped intense precipitation. This resulted in deadly landslides, flooded fields, and the destruction of thousands of houses. The typhoon also brought heavy rainfall and rough seas to Taiwan and the east coast of China. In the southern Ryukyu Islands and Kyushu, high wind overturned vehicles, damaged buildings, and left over 490,000homes without power. Off the coast of Kyushu, a man drowned amid high waves. Flooding killed 40people <b>in</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea.</b> The extratropical remnants of Goni damaged crops and flooded a zoo in eastern Russia.|$|E

5|$|As {{the storm}} moved northward over the Yellow Sea, {{atmospheric}} conditions became increasingly hostile, with significantly lower sea surface temperatures and high wind shear. During the overnight of August2728, the typhoon brushed South Korea as a weakening cyclone. Convection {{on the west}} side of the storm diminished and its feeder bands began to collapse. Increasing shear started taking its toll early on August28 as convection became displaced from the center of circulation, leaving part of the southwestern quadrant exposed. This also indicated that Bolaven had begun to undergo an extratropical transition as it approached the Korean Peninsula. Following structural weakening, the JMA and JTWC downgraded Bolaven to a severe tropical storm and tropical storm, respectively. Hours before moving onshore <b>in</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea,</b> the majority of the convection had moved over land while the circulation and the center itself had only stratocumulus clouds covering it. Around 1500UTC on August28, Bolaven made landfall <b>in</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> with winds of 100km/h (65mph). Rapidly moving towards the northeast, the storm became fully embedded within a baroclinic zone near the ChinaNorth Korea border later that day. The JMA continued to monitor Bolaven as a tropical cyclone until early on August29, at which time the system was situated over the southern region of the Russian Far East. The extratropical remnants later turned eastward and were last noted on September1 crossing the International Dateline.|$|E
5|$|During his career, Han {{survived a}} number of purges that were caused by {{factional}} strife within the Workers' Party. Han, motivated by personal grievances against his rival writers, sometimes acted as the force behind the purges within the cultural establishment as well. Han himself was purged in 1962. In his works, Han offered {{some of the earliest}} known contributions to the cult of personality of Kim Il-sung. His influence is felt <b>in</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> even today, though his name has been forgotten from official histories. Han's best known work, the anti-American novella Jackals, however, has been invoked in the 2000s.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though most}} {{consumer}} items {{are in short}} supply <b>in</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea,</b> there is a considerable variety of cigarettes available. In general, strong tobacco is preferred, and filters are rare. Western brands, particularly American, but also Chinese, Russian and Japanese are popular with the elite and preferred over domestic cigarettes. Foreign cigarettes and the domestic 727 brand, whose name stands for 27 July, the date of the Korean Armistice Agreement, are veritable status symbols. Menthol cigarettes are virtually non-existent, but there is competition among tobacco companies to introduce other attractive products, such as fruit-flavoured balls inside the filter to give the cigarette flavour.|$|E
