25|$|The finals of the 2012 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles was {{the only}} best {{two out of three}} falls tag team match of the tournament and was the semi-main event of the 2012 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas.

Following the match Rush took a microphone and berated both El Terrible and the fans for their actions that night and then followed it up by challenging El Terrible to a Luchas de Apuestas, hair vs. hair match at a later date. El Terrible did not accept the challenge at that point in time.|$|E
25|$|But then {{a mysterious}} {{person in a}} Krabby Patty-costume defeats {{all four of the}} {{restaurant}} managers, saves SpongeBob and takes him back to the Krusty Krab. It turns out that the Krusty Krab has gone downhill ever since Mr. Krabs fired SpongeBob and took over as the fry cook. Squidward reveals himself as the person in the costume, and explains that as much as he hates SpongeBob (which SpongeBob himself acknowledges), he hates the smell of burning Krabby Patties even more, and both <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mr.</b> Krabs ask SpongeBob to be the fry cook again, with Mr. Krabs admitting that he made a huge mistake in firing SpongeBob in the first place. SpongeBob gladly accepts his old job as the fry cook, and puts the restaurant back on track, which brings back all the customers, even the four restaurant managers who fought over SpongeBob. At the end of the episode, Mr. Krabs reveals that he has installed a pay toilet that costs a nickel to use, thus making up the nickel that he previously lost by hiring SpongeBob.|$|E
25|$|At the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob {{goes into}} the freezer to get Krabby Patties, only to {{discover}} that none are left. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mr.</b> Krabs try to make more, but Plankton comes out of the vault with the formula. Mr. Krabs catches him and decides to send it to a bank since he got tired of stopping Plankton. He then realizes that he needed the formula so he gives SpongeBob the key to the vault in which the recipe is hidden, and he and Patrick board a train to the bank for the safe deposit box. Eventually, the key is stolen and SpongeBob and Patrick must find the culprit. Just then, Plankton walks up and Patrick searches him, but finds him clean. The duo stops the train to find the suspect responsible for stealing the key. A nanny and her baby are searched, only to find a stolen jewel that was stolen by triplets. The next suspect, a butler, is revealed to be a thief named Orin J. Ruffy who stole $75,000 worth of ham sandwiches.|$|E

500|$|Johnson's {{tall and}} robust figure {{combined}} with his odd gestures were confusing to some; when William Hogarth first saw Johnson standing near {{a window in}} Samuel Richardson's house, [...] "shaking his head and rolling himself about in a strange ridiculous manner", Hogarth thought Johnson an [...] "ideot, whom his relations had put {{under the care of}} Mr. Richardson". Hogarth was quite surprised when [...] "this figure stalked forwards to where <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mr.</b> Richardson were sitting and all at once took up the argument... such a power of eloquence, that Hogarth looked at him with astonishment, and actually imagined that this ideot had been at the moment inspired". Beyond appearance, Adam Smith claimed that [...] "Johnson knew more books than any man alive", while Edmund Burke thought that if Johnson were to join Parliament, he [...] "certainly would have been the greatest speaker that ever was there". Johnson relied on a unique form of rhetoric, and he is well known for his [...] "refutation" [...] of Bishop Berkeley's immaterialism, his claim that matter did not actually exist but only seemed to exist: during a conversation with Boswell, Johnson powerfully stomped a nearby stone and proclaimed of Berkeley's theory, [...] "I refute it thus!" ...|$|E
500|$|Following the broadcast, the IOC {{provisionally}} suspended Ivan Slavkov and forbade {{him from}} attending the 2004 Summer Olympics. Jacques Rogge {{claimed he was}} [...] "an angry man because some people are not playing by the rules," [...] underlining that [...] "Under my leadership, I can stress there is zero tolerance for unethical behaviour". An IOC Ethics Commission report released on 25 October 2004 condemned Slavkov and backed the veracity of the BBC's investigation: [...] "the complete recording of the meeting between Mr Slavkov and the two journalists reveals that: ...at no time and in no way did Mr Slavkov object to this discussion {{of the terms of}} a contract to secure a candidate city the votes of IOC members whom <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mr</b> Takac were {{likely to be able to}} influence". Knowing about the accusation, Slavkov argued that he attended the meeting with the purpose of trying to frame the supposed corrupters, however the Ethics Commission report further stated that [...] "at no point does it emerge from the meeting that Mr Slavkov's sole intention was to catch in the act these corrupters of IOC members." [...] It goes on to say that Slavkov received [...] "no mandate to 'find the real roots of corruption'" [...] and that he was to profit monetarily from Takac's services. The report concluded: ...|$|E

Mr Cook touched a pole to the electric wiring and suffered a horrific death which caused Mr Young great distress. Even though he never feared for the loss of his own life, the court held that Mr Young was in the area of potential damage, so he was entitled to claim compensation.|$|E

As in 2003, the horse {{prepared for the}} Gold Cup with a run in the Henry II Stakes and started 2/1 favourite under top weight of 131 pounds. He finished second to the four-year-old Papineau (carrying 124 pounds) but appeared somewhat unlucky as he was hampered when the winner hung to the right in the final furlong. Fallon claimed that <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mr</b> Dinos would have won the race had they not been [...] "stopped in our tracks".|$|E
2500|$|The cases seem to {{show that}} the divide between [...] "fact" [...] and [...] "opinion" [...] is partly {{affected}} by the balance of knowledge and expertise between the parties. In Bisset v Wilkinson Mr Bisset said his land in New Zealand could support 2000 sheep. Both <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mr</b> Wilkinson knew sheep had not been farmed before. Mr Wilkinson tried to pull out after the contract was signed, but the Privy Council advised that the statement was only one of opinion, not fact given that there was no dishonesty, and considering the [...] "knowledge of the parties respectively, and their relative positions". In the more recent case of Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Mardon Lord Denning MR emphasised again that knowledge of facts was crucial in being liable for a misrepresentation. Here Esso told Mr Mardon, a prospective franchisee, that its Southport petrol station would have 200,000 customers a year. In fact the projections were wrong, and so Mr Mardon was entitled to claim compensation for his losses. The distinction between Esso and Mr Bisset is that Esso was in a far better position to know what was true.|$|E
2500|$|This {{conflict}} between Moore and DC Comics {{was the subject}} of an article in The New York Times on 12 March 2006, five days before the US release. In the New York Times article, Silver stated that about 20years prior to the film's release, he met with Moore and Dave Gibbons when Silver acquired the film rights to V For Vendetta and Watchmen. Silver stated, [...] "Alan was odd, but he was enthusiastic and encouraging us to do this. I had foolishly thought that he would continue feeling that way today, not realising that he wouldn't." [...] Moore did not deny this meeting or Silver's characterisation of Moore at that meeting, nor did Moore state that he advised Silver of his change of opinion in those approximately 20years. The New York Times article also interviewed David Lloyd about Moore's reaction to the film's production, stating, [...] "Mr. Lloyd, the illustrator of V for Vendetta, also found it difficult to sympathise with Mr. Moore's protests. When <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mr.</b> Moore sold their film rights to the comic book, Mr. Lloyd said: [...] "We didn't do it innocently. Neither myself nor Alan thought we were signing it over to a board of trustees who would look after it like it was the Dead Sea Scrolls." ...|$|E
