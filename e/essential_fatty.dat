5|$|Avocado cake can be {{prepared}} as an uncooked cake using raw avocados and other raw ingredients, which are blended together into a smooth consistency and then chilled. A food processor {{can be used to}} blend the ingredients. Raw avocado cake prepared with a significant amount of avocado may contain substantial amounts of vitamin E and <b>essential</b> <b>fatty</b> acids, which are derived from avocado.|$|E
5|$|The {{synthesis}} of unsaturated fatty acids involves a desaturation reaction, whereby a double bond is {{introduced into the}} fatty acyl chain. For example, in humans, the desaturation of stearic acid by stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 produces oleic acid. The doubly unsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid {{as well as the}} triply unsaturated α-linolenic acid cannot be synthesized in mammalian tissues, and are therefore <b>essential</b> <b>fatty</b> acids and must be obtained from the diet.|$|E

50|$|Oleoresins are {{semi-solid}} extracts {{composed of}} a resin in solution in an <b>essential</b> and/or <b>fatty</b> oil, obtained by evaporation of the solvent(s) used for their production. Naturally occurring oleoresins are also known as balsams.|$|R
5|$|Avocado cake is a cake {{prepared}} using avocado as {{a primary}} ingredient, together with other typical cake ingredients. The avocados can be mashed, and {{may be used as}} an ingredient in cake batter, in cake toppings and alone atop a cake. Cake variations include raw avocado cake, avocado brownies and avocado cheesecake. Raw, uncooked versions of avocado cake can be high in vitamin E and <b>essential</b> <b>fatty</b> acids, which are derived from avocado. Avocado-based cake toppings include avocado fool and avocado crazy.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} {{inflammation}} in DPB persists {{with or without}} the presence of P.aeruginosa and H.influenzae provides a means to determine several mechanisms of DPB pathogenesis. Leukotrienes are eicosanoids, signaling molecules made from <b>essential</b> <b>fatty</b> acids, which play a role in many lung diseases by causing the proliferation of inflammatory cells and excess mucus production in the airways. In DPB and other lung diseases, the predominant mediator of neutrophil-related inflammation is leukotriene B4, which specializes in neutrophil proliferation via chemotaxis (the movement of some types of cells toward or away from certain molecules).|$|E
5|$|The {{fatty acid}} {{composition}} of S.brevipes fruit bodies has been analyzed. The cap contained a higher lipid content than the stipe—18.4% {{of the dry}} weight, compared to 12.4%. In the cap, linoleic acid made up 50.7% of the total lipids (65.7% in the stipe), oleic acid was 29.9% (12.4% in the stipe), followed by palmitic acid at 10.5% (12.6% in the stipe). Linoleic acid—a {{member of the group}} of <b>essential</b> <b>fatty</b> acids called omega-6 fatty acids—is an essential dietary requirement for humans.|$|E
50|$|Flavonoids (vitexin, casticin), iridoid {{glycoside}} (agnuside, aucubin), p-hydroxybenzoic acid, alkaloids, <b>essential</b> oils, <b>fatty</b> oils, diterpenoids and steroidal hormone precursors {{have been}} identified in the chemical analysis of Vitex agnus-castus. They occur in the fruits and in the leaves.|$|R
50|$|Both <b>essential</b> and <b>fatty</b> oils {{are present}} in the fruit. The fruit is pressed and water-extracted to obtain these products. The fruit {{contains}} up to 30% fatty oils and about 1% essential oils (terpenes, sesquiterpenes, alcohols, and ketones).|$|R
50|$|Oil: The {{extractable}} {{oil content}} in whole seeds reaches from 24.3% to 50%. Linoleic acid, an <b>essential</b> polyunsaturated <b>fatty</b> acid, comprises 38% to 65% of the oil.

5|$|The Māori used {{various parts}} of Cordyline australis to treat {{injuries}} and illnesses, either boiled up into a drink or pounded into a paste. The kōata, the growing tip of the plant, was eaten raw as a blood tonic or cleanser. Juice from the leaves was used for cuts, cracks and sores. An infusion of the leaves was taken internally for diarrhoea and used externally for bathing cuts. The leaves were rubbed until soft and applied either directly or as an ointment to cuts, skin cracks and cracked or sore hands. The young shoot was eaten by nursing mothers and given to children for colic. The liquid from boiled shoots was taken for other stomach pains. The seeds of Cordyline australis are high in linoleic acid, one of the <b>essential</b> <b>fatty</b> acids.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of the fat}} {{found in}} food {{is in the form}} of triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids. Some dietary fat is {{necessary}} to facilitate absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and carotenoids. Humans and other mammals have a dietary requirement for certain <b>essential</b> <b>fatty</b> acids, such as linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid) and alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) because they cannot be synthesized from simple precursors in the diet. Both of these fatty acids are 18-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids differing in the number and position of the double bonds. Most vegetable oils are rich in linoleic acid (safflower, sunflower, and corn oils). Alpha-linolenic acid is found in the green leaves of plants, and in selected seeds, nuts, and legumes (in particular flax, rapeseed, walnut, and soy). Fish oils are particularly rich in the longer-chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). A large number of studies have shown positive health benefits associated with consumption of omega-3 fatty acids on infant development, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and various mental illnesses, such as depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and dementia. In contrast, it is now well-established that consumption of trans fats, such as those present in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.|$|E
25|$|Metabolic {{syndrome}} {{is a risk}} factor for neurological disorders. Metabolomic studies suggest an excess of organic acids, impaired lipid oxidation byproducts, <b>essential</b> <b>fatty</b> acids and essential amino acids in the blood serum of affected patients. However, it is not entirely clear whether the accumulation of <b>essential</b> <b>fatty</b> acids and amino acids is the result of excessive ingestion or excess production by gut microbiota.|$|E
50|$|Soybean oil {{is one of}} the {{vegetable}} oils that contain a significant amount of the <b>essential</b> omega-3 <b>fatty</b> acid alpha-linolenic acid (18:3n−3, ALA). Other plant oils containing significant amount of ALA include chia, flax, hemp, canola and walnut. Soybean oil has an omega-6:omega-3 ratio of 7:1.|$|R
5000|$|Complete loss of MFSD2A {{in human}} {{leads to a}} {{recessive}} lethal microcephaly syndrome consisting of enlarged lateral ventricles and underdevelopment of the cerebellum and brainstem. This is presumably due to loss of uptake of <b>essential</b> polyunsaturated <b>fatty</b> acids by the brain endothelial cells, which utilize MFSD2A as a transporter for these fats. Serum from patients showed elevated levels of <b>essential</b> polyunsaturated <b>fatty</b> acids, presumably due to the inability of vascular cells to uptake these lipids {{in the absence of}} protein function. Without the ability to uptake these fats into endothelial cells, there is breakdown of the blood-brain-barrier and loss of brain volume. This was demonstrated in a zebrafish model by intracardiac injection of dye, which was found to extravasate into the brain parenchyma following inactivating one of the paralogues of MSFD2A known as mfsd2aa.|$|R
30|$|The {{synergistic}} {{activity of}} the <b>essential</b> oils, <b>fatty</b> acids and other secondary metabolites in the extracts used for the formulation of the toothpastes could also be an influential factor in their bioactivities.

25|$|Although {{the best}} source of ALA is seeds, most seeds and seed oils are much richer in an n−6 fatty acid, {{linoleic}} acid. Exceptions include flaxseed (must be ground for proper nutrient absorption) and chia seeds. Linoleic acid is the other <b>essential</b> <b>fatty</b> acid, but it, and the other n−6 fatty acids, compete with n−3s for positions in cell membranes and have very different effects on human health. There is {{a complex set of}} <b>essential</b> <b>fatty</b> acid interactions.|$|E
40|$|Numerous natural {{compounds}} found in fruits, grains and vegetables have antioxidant activity. This work aimed to characterize jabuticaba seeds (Myrciaria cauliflora Berg) by proximate composition, antioxidant activity and fatty acids profile of their extracted oil. To obtain the extract, the dehydrated and triturated seeds were extracted with ethyl alcohol for 30 min, at {{a proportion of}} 1 : 3 of seeds:ethyl alcohol, under continuous agitation, at room temperature. Afterwards, the mixture was filtered and the supernatant dehydrated at 40 °C aiming to determine, by direct weighing, the extract's dry matter yield. According to the results, the jabuticaba seeds are {{an important source of}} total carbohydrates, and also presented relevant antioxidant activity. In the jabuticaba seeds oil, a significant percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids stood out, with linoleic and α-linolenic being the main component, <b>essentials</b> <b>fatty</b> acids...|$|R
