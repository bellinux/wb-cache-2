The human body composition was assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), 5 brands of S-BIM, and 2 brands of M-BIM. Forty-five women, aged 26 - 58 years, served as subjects. The S-BIM and M-BIM fat-free mass (FFM) estimates were highly correlated with the FFM measured by DEXA (r= 0. 82 - 0. 93). The standard errors of estimate (SEE) for FFM were approximately 2 kg. With the exception of the MLT- 100 (which slightly underestimated FFM), all brands of BIM slightly overestimated FFM. The absolute mean differences between FFM_ and each of the 7 BIM estimates ranged from - 3. 02 kg to 3. 46 kg.
