Tampines coach Vorawan Chitavanich was reported as saying [...] "I spoke to their coach <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>ago</b> {{and he said that}} they acted on the instructions of their club chairman." ...|$|E
50|$|Afterwards, Thursday {{returns home}} and finds her father there. She is {{confused}} until she realizes that, being a time traveller, he will sacrifice himself much {{later in his}} future, {{even though it was}} <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>ago</b> in hers. Now that she is wanted by Goliath, the ChronoGuard, and Aornis, her father offers to place her in an alternate reality for a while (it is ironically implied that this is our reality) while she gives birth to Landen's baby. Refusing her father's offer, Thursday travels to a book in the Well of Lost Plots—a subdivision of the Great Library that contains unpublished and unfinished works—in order to take a year's maternity leave with her memory of Landen. She establishes a home in a moored flying boat (a Short Sunderland), after trading places with the plucky sidekick sergeant of a police procedural mystery; it is implied that this is Sergeant Mary Mary, from one of Fforde's other works, The Big Over Easy.|$|E

60|$|The boys {{went into}} the woods, and got pawpaw branches, and came back and fought the {{bumblebees}} till they drove them off.

50|$|While {{everyone}} {{was looking forward}} to a Mercedes/Jaguar duel, the Tourist Trophy would be marred by tragedy, within the first few laps of the lap. The Cooper-Climax T39 of Jim Mayers, who was sharing the car with Jack Brabham, would hit a concrete pillar and the car immediately burst into a ball of flame. Mayers would have been killed instantly. This explosion caught out the approaching William Smith, at the wheel of a Connaught AL/SR. Smith would plow straight into Mayers and would eventually perish <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> later. After the event horrible events at Le Mans, two more death would only add to the numbness for many.|$|R

60|$|So Hooty the Owl {{spread his}} broad wings {{and started for}} the Old Pasture <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> after Peter Rabbit had started for the same place. Of course he didn't know that Peter was on his way there, and of course Peter didn't know that Hooty even thought of the Old Pasture. If he had, perhaps he would have thought twice before starting. Anyway, he would have kept a sharper watch on the sky. But as it was his {{thoughts}} were all of Old Man Coyote and Granny Fox, and that is where Peter made a very grave mistake, a very grave mistake indeed, as he was soon to find out.|$|R
60|$|Pan stood {{gazing down}} the green aisle. He had acted true to himself. How {{impossible}} {{to meet this}} situation in any other way! It meant the spilling of blood. He knew it--accepted it--and {{made no attempt to}} change the cold passion deep within him. Lucy--his mother and father would suffer. But wouldn't they suffer more if he did not confront this conflict as his hard training dictated? He was almost afraid to turn and look at Lucy. <b>Just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> before he had promised her forbearance. So his amaze was great when she faced him, violet eyes ablaze, to clasp him, and creep close to him, with lingering traces of fear giving way to woman's admiration and love.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1990s, {{there was}} a {{decrease}} in demand for paramedical courses graduates abroad since their schools were producing their own healthcare workers and prioritized local job employment. To keep IMCC competitive, and possibly reduce {{the impact of this}} event, the institution diversified its course offering to include more non-paramedical courses. With the rapid increase in technology [...] - [...] notably, computers [...] - [...] IMCC responded with the opening of computer-related courses such as Computer Science, Information Technology, and Information Management. Furthermore, widening its horizon, it offered pre-school, primary and secondary levels. <b>Just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> later, the Hotel and Restaurant Management, Tourism, Education and other courses opened up to meet the demand in industries and other employment entities.|$|R
60|$|This morning I {{felt too}} tired to go out any where; but Mr. and Mrs. Binney persuaded me to go <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> in to {{the meeting of the}} Bible Society, for you must know that this is anniversary week, and so, besides the usual rush, and roar, and whirl of London, there is the {{confluence}} of all the religious forces in Exeter Hall. I told Mrs. B. that I was worn out, and did not think I could sit through a single speech; but she tempted me by a promise that I should withdraw at any moment. We had <b>a</b> nice <b>little</b> snug gallery near one of the doors, where I could see all over the house, and make a quick retreat in case of need.|$|R
60|$|Jimmy Skunk {{was smiling}} as he ambled towards {{the old house}} of Johnny Chuck near {{the foot of the}} hill. There was no one near to see him, and this made him smile still more. You see, the odor of that perfume which he had thrown at Reddy Fox <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> before was very, very strong there, and Jimmy knew that until that had {{disappeared}} no one would come near the place because it was so unpleasant for every one. To Jimmy himself it wasn't unpleasant at all, and he couldn't understand why other people disliked it so. He had puzzled over that a great deal. He was glad that it was so, because on account of it every one treated him with respect and took special pains not to quarrel with him.|$|R
6000|$|In his {{interview}} with Mr. Fynney, Cetywayo speaks out quite frankly as to what his intentions had been; he says, [...] "I know all about the soldiers being on their way up, but I would have asked Sompseu to allow the soldiers to stand on one side for <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while,</b> only <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> and see what my men could do. It would have been unnecessary for the Queen's people to trouble. My men were all ready, and how big must that stone have been, with my father Sompseu digging at one side and myself at the other, {{that would not have}} toppled over? Even though the size of that mountain (pointing to a mountain range), we could put it on its back. Again I say I am glad to know the Transvaal is English ground; perhaps now there may be rest." ...|$|R
50|$|Due to the fissioning {{of human}} society along roughly racial lines, {{much of the}} Coalition's {{population}} is somewhat dark-skinned and dark-haired, or very obviously of east-Asian stock. Trystin comes {{from one of the}} rare few old-Anglo families in the Coalition, however, and his pale skin and light hair make him look <b>just</b> like <b>a</b> rev, who are predominantly Caucasian and fair-haired. For this reason, Trystin is taken by the Service's intelligence division as a potential field agent. Many intelligence agents are drawn from the pilot ranks, since much of the work requires piloting in rev systems. He is pressed through an intensive conditioning process to learn to act like a rev, and adopts the name of Brother Hyriss to infiltrate the rev capital world of Orum. There, he is to assassinate a rev general, in hopes of throwing rev planning into disarray and stalling the war for <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while.</b>|$|R
6000|$|So Longlegs {{stood on}} the edge of <b>a</b> shallow <b>little</b> pool in the Laughing Brook, grumbling to himself. <b>Just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> before, he had seen Little Joe Otter {{carrying}} home a big fish, and this had made him hungrier and more out of sorts than ever. In the first place it made him envious, and envy, you know, always stirs up bad feelings. He knew perfectly well that Little Joe had got that fish by boldly chasing it until he caught it, for Little Joe can swim even faster than a fish. But Longlegs chose to try to make himself think that it was all luck. Moreover, he wanted to blame some one for his own lack of success, as most people who fail do. So when Little Joe had called out: [...] "Hi, Longlegs, what luck this fine morning?" [...] Longlegs just pretended not to hear. But when Little Joe was out of sight and hearing, he began to grumble to himself.|$|R
50|$|Croatia {{went on to}} face hosts France in the semi-finals, {{but lost}} the game 1 - 2 when an opener scored by Šuker in the 46th minute was {{immediately}} equalised by Lilian Thuram the following minute. Thuram also scored France's second goal in the 69th minute. Interestingly, these {{were the only two}} goals Thuram ever scored for France in an international career spanning from 1994 to 2008 which saw him earn a total of 147 caps. After Croatia's exit manager Blažević was heavily criticized by Croatian press for not sending in Robert Prosinečki soon enough after France took the lead (Prosinečki came on as a substitute for Mario Stanić just minutes before the final whistle). Croatia captain Zvonimir Boban tried to take the blame for the defeat saying that he felt he needed to be substituted but wanted to stay on the pitch <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> longer (it was his defending mistake which led to Thuram's equaliser).|$|R
