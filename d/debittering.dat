This happens in two steps- first, naringin is hydrolyzed by α-L-rhamnosidase activity of naringinase to rhamnose and prunin. The prunin formed is then hydrolyzed by β-d-glucosidase activity of naringinase into naringenin and glucose. Naringinase is an enzyme that has a wide occurrence in nature and can be found in plants, yeasts, and fungi. It is commercially attractive due to its <b>debittering</b> properties.|$|E

5000|$|A major {{constraint}} to {{the wider}} adoption of B. senegalensis is the recalcitrant nature of its seeds. Seeds of this type are not well suited for ex-situ conservation, as they rapidly lose viability, and embryos are killed when seeds are dried. [...] This creates a barrier to widespread growth, as {{it is difficult to}} propagate large numbers of plants for large-scale genetic selection and breeding. Other drawbacks to consumption include the issue of toxicity and the associated need to use scarce water resources and additional labour to leach out toxins during the <b>debittering</b> process.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two methods}} of {{preparing}} Kalamata olives, {{known as the}} long and short methods. The short method <b>debitters</b> the olive by packing them in water or weak brine for around a week.

Based on preliminary evaluation with different proportions of chick pea and rice, a blend of 70 : 30 chickpea and rice {{was chosen as the}} control for further studies. The control blend, replaced with fenugreek flour at 2 %, 5 % and 10 %, or fenugreek polysaccharide at 5 %, 10 %, 15 % and 20 %, was extruded at the optimum processing conditions as specified in the detailed study. The extruded products were evaluated for their physical (moisture retention, expansion, hardness, water solubility index (WSI) and water absorption index (WAI)), sensory (flavor, texture, color and overall acceptability) characteristics and in vitro GI to evaluate their suitability as extruded snack products. Due to the distinct bitter taste, inclusion of fenugreek flour was not acceptable at levels more than 2 % in extruded chickpea based products. Addition of fenugreek polysaccharide resulted in slight reduction in radial expansion (P 0. 05) between products containing 5 – 15 % fenugreek polysaccharide in their color, flavor, texture and overall quality. Fenugreek, in the form of <b>debittered</b> polysaccharide (FenuLife ®) could be incorporated up to a level of 15 % in a chickpea–rice blend to develop snack products of acceptable physical and sensory properties with low GI Index. <br /...|$|R
50|$|The {{seeds of}} B. senegalensis are also {{important}} sources of nutrition, especially during times of famine. To {{gain access to the}} seeds, fruits are dried in the sun, pounded to remove the outer seed coat and soaked in water for several days, changing the water every day. The seed soaking process, also known as <b>debittering,</b> is essential to remove bitter and potentially toxic components. Seeds are usually cooked prior to consumption. Cooked seeds are texturally similar to a chickpea and {{can be used as a}} cereal substitute in stews, soups and porridges. Additionally, seeds can be re-dried and stored for later use or ground into a flour that can be used to make porridge. Roasted seeds can also serve as a substitute for coffee.Modern uses of B. senegalensis seeds are being developed in Niger Republic. They include cakes, cookies, bread, canned and popped seeds. These products from natural, wild B. senegalensis were recognised with the innovation award at an international food fair in Niamey, Niger, 2012.|$|E
50|$|Fresh fruit {{are usually}} unpalatable, {{but they can}} be {{debittered}} and made into compote, jelly, jam, a tangy syrup, a tart chutney, or juice, as well as wine and liqueur, or used for tea or to make flour. Fruit are served as a side dish to lamb or game. <b>Debittering</b> can be accomplished by freezing, cooking, or drying, which degrades the parasorbic acid. The fruit are red colored in August but usually only harvested in October after the first frost by cutting the corymbs. The robust qualities of S. aucuparia make it a source for fruit in harsh mountain climate and Maria Theresa of the Habsburg Monarchy recommended the planting of the species in 1779.An edible variety, named Sorbus aucuparia var. dulcis Kraetzl, or var. edulis Dieck, or var. moravica Dippel, was first discovered in 1810 near Ostružná in the Hrubý Jeseník mountain range of Northern Moravia and became widespread in Germany and Austria the early 20th century. Its leaves are larger and pointed, only the front part of the leaflets is serrated, and they have darker bark, larger buds and larger fruit. Similar non-bitter varieties found in Southern Russia were first introduced in Central Europe in 1900 as 'Rossica' and 'Rossica Major', which has large fruit up to 1.5 cm in diameter.|$|E
30|$|Due to {{the unique}} {{contribution}} of proline residues to protein hydrolysate bitterness, much {{research has focused on}} the application of proline-specific exopeptidases in hydrolysate <b>debittering</b> strategies due to the general inability of most general aminopeptidases to hydrolyze the imino bond ([FitzGerald and O'Cuinn 2006]). PepP from lactococcoal strains may contribute to the abolition of bitterness during cheese ripening when peptide degradation is involved during fermentation ([McDonnell et al. 1997]). <b>Debittering</b> of a tryptic hydrolysate of β-casein has been described using purified general and proline-specific aminopeptidases from Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris AM 2 ([Bouchier et al. 2001]). Thus, PepP has industrial potential based on its application to the enzymatic <b>debittering</b> of proline-rich peptide mixtures in foods. In addition to native enzyme production and purification, recombinant DNA technology can be used to express large amounts of interesting enzymes ([Oliveira et al. 2011]). This possibility greatly expands the range of potential applications for enzymes (e.g., β-galactosidases) and their economically effective utilization in industrial processes ([Oliveira et al. 2011]).|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} an {{experimental}} trial, carried out using a specifically prepared microbial starter, in an automated pilot plant, are presented. The microbial starter was composed by Lb. pentosus strains. The automatized process was compared with natural fermentation in plastic vats, as control. Relevant process parameters, chemico-physical determinations, instrumental texture, and microbiological analyses were carried out to monitor the fermentation process. Driving the process in controlled conditions resulted in a more rapid acidification, pH reaching lower values than the control. In controlled conditions, inoculated lactobacilli carried out a fast colonization supplanting more rapidly spoilage microflora. In started samples, yeasts number increased until reaching 5 log at 60  days, keeping this value constant {{until the end of}} the trials, while, in control batches, their growth was more rapid, reaching 5 log from 15 to 30  days, but their number decreased to 3 log at 90  days. The two processes produced olives with comparable texture profile. However, olives coming from the controlled process resulted <b>debittered</b> in 3  months (descriptive sensory analyses and oleuropein quantification in HPLC), while naturally fermented olives resulted not yet <b>debittered</b> at the end of the trial (180  days). Slight differences were found in few other sensory descriptors.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Thasos is {{an olive}} variety {{cultivated}} mainly in Greece {{used to produce}} ‘naturally black dry-salted olives’. This process consists in placing the olives in disposed layers with coarse sodium chloride. The loss of water and other solutes gradually <b>debitters</b> and wrinkles the fruits. In this study, the effect of dry-salt processing on the texture and cell wall polysaccharide composition was investigated. RESULTS: This type of processing affected primarily the mechanical properties of the olive flesh. In processed olives, this tissue was approximately 4. 5 times stronger and also more deformable up to failure and stiffer than that from the raw olives. The dry-salt processing had its strongest effect on pectic polysaccharides. This included the increment of solubilization of arabinose-rich polymers in aqueous solutions, and thus their partial loss to the soak medium during dry-salting. Contrarily, galacturonic acid-rich polymers were further retained in the processed olives, probably by their stabilization within the cell walls by reduction of the electrostatic repulsion between the acidic groups of these polysaccharides due to sodium ions.

The fruit pieces were water blanched at 95 °C for 10 min and at 85 °C for 60 min and steam blanched at atmospheric pressure during 5 min. The kinetics of water inflow and bitter flavanone losses were established from the variation of moisture and bitter com- pound contents during the blanching process. The whiteness and the citrus color indexes were adopted to evaluate respectively {{the color of the}} flavedo and the albedo. Thin sections of fresh and treated peels were resin embedded for light micros- copy evaluation and optical porosity determination. Results revealed that water blanching could partially <b>debitter</b> the peels by removing about 38 and 48 % of bitter flavanones (naringin, neohesperidin, neoeriocitrin) respectively at 95 and 85 °C. The citrus color index and the whiteness index decreased during the process denoting a flavedo discoloring and an albedo darkening. By contrast, the steam blanching showed good retention of bitter compounds. The color of the flavedo was unaffected by steaming while the whiteness index decreased. At microscopic level, the water-blanched peels exhibited an extreme swelling of the cell walls and slight disintegration of the tissue.

In the olives and its derivatives it has been recognized antioxidant capacity and beneficial properties against degenerative diseases induced by oxidative stress, due to the particular fatty acid composition, the important concentration of phenolic compounds and the Vitamin E content. The phenolic content of olives and their transformation products may be influenced by several factors: variety (type of cultivar), processing methods, soil conditions, climatic and technological processes. In table olives functional characteristics and antioxidants are strongly influenced by the fermentation process mediated by microbial starters.

Fermentation profile has been traced monitoring microbial counts, pH, titratable acidity and volatile acidity development. Phenolic profile, antioxidant capacity, along with instrumental texture analyses and sensory evaluations have been carried out to define the impact of the technologies employed on the quality features during the processing and in the final products. In the second part of this thesis it were evaluated the antimicrobial and antibiofilm effects of some common foods typical of the Mediterranean diet (Allium sativum L.; Allium cepa L.; Ocimum basilicum, L.; Petroselinum crispum) and shiitake mushroom (Lentinula edodes) extracts. Actually this is an important topic of study within the renewed philosophy of “more natural life” and environmentally friendly. The Olive oils tested showed excellent quality characteristics. SIE resulted more efficient in supplanting the spoilage microbiota (Enterobacteriaceae) compared to SSL and NF. Both starters were able to lower the pH at security levels in a shorter time compared to NF driven fermentation that resulted in higher final pH levels and lower titratable acidity. Texture analyses showed that NF samples retained more cohesiveness and elasticity than inoculated samples. However, SIE samples texture resulted more firm and elastic, compared to SSL texture. Microbial starters efficiently <b>debittered</b> the olives in 5 months, while NF samples resulted not yet <b>debittered</b> {{at the end of the}} sampling period. The results obtained in the second part of the thesis shown an activity profile of the extract of garlic for most of the tested strains. The results obtained from the experiments on the biofilm showed the oppositive trend to expected, in contrast to the antimicrobial action of the extract. The foods we studied could produce increased activity in the commensal (greater biofilm physiological) reducing pathogenicity. The most important fact, concerning the extract of Lentinula edoses, is the increase of the biofilm of the probiotic compared to the pathogen (inhibited). This could allow the use of the shiitake mushroom in the treatment of periodontal disease...|$|R

Heat treatment produced {{a change in the}} intensity of the oil bitterness in all cases, increased the pigment content, decreased stability and reduced the sensory freshness of the oil. Although heat treatment reduced the phenolic content of the oil, this effect was not uniform among the different phenolic compounds and depended on the crop season and olive variety. Therefore, the determination of <b>debittering</b> conditions will require a series of preliminary laboratory-scale experiments. Peer reviewe...|$|E

Cheese made with transconjugant SK 110 ::Tn 5276 -NI as the starter was bitter. The muropeptide of the transconjugant contained a significantly greater amount of tetrapeptides than the muropeptide of strain SK 110, which could have decreased the susceptibility of the cells to lysis and thereby the release of intracellular <b>debittering</b> enzymes...|$|E
40|$|Olives can debitter {{naturally}} {{without the}} use of NaOH but it is a very slow process. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the influence of both temperature and chemical characteristics of brine on the oleuropein hydrolysis rate in natural table olives. Two different phases were established for natural <b>debittering.</b> During the first 1 – 2 months of brining, a low concentration of NaCl (60  g/L) and acetic acid (2  g/L) together with a low storage temperature (10  °C) were the processing conditions that promoted a rapid hydrolysis of the bitter phenol because these mild conditions facilitated the action of endogenous enzymes (β-glucosidase and esterase). Thereafter, higher concentrations and temperature of storage (140  g/L NaCl, 16  g/L acetic acid and 40  °C) favored the chemical hydrolysis of oleuropein during long term (a few months) storage. These results will contribute to the knowledge of the natural <b>debittering</b> of table olives and they will help processors to accelerate their elaboration methods. This work was supported by projects AGL 2009 - 07512 and AGL 2013 - 42739 -R from the Spanish Government and European Union (European Regional Development Funds).

Clean and <b>debittered</b> yeast cells biomass and its derivatives, total autolisate and extract, after {{dehydration}} (spray dryer), {{were used in}} a bioassay with wistar rats for determination of protein nutritive value and evaluation {{of the impact of}} the yeast products on the blood serum levels of uric acid, triacylglycerols, total cholesterol and High Density Lipoproteins-cholesterol. Integral cells, total autolisate and yeast extract did not differ statistically (p <= 0. 05) regarding Protein Efficiency Ratio and Net Protein Ratio, which were significantly lower than the casein value. The growth promoting capacity was higher for casein, followed by integral cells, yeast extract and total autolisate, in decreasing order of magnitude. Net protein utilization values confirmed the Protein Efficiency Ratio and Net Protein Ratio results. Yeast products protein nutritive value was statistically identical but inferior to casein value. On the whole, the nutritive value of the yeast products protein ranked between 80 - 85 % of the casein value. Uric acid serum concentration increased in the rats fed the diets containing yeast products, but the values remained in the range considered of normality for rats. The diet containing yeast autolisate produced a reduction of the triacylglycerols content, which was not observed in the other diets. For total cholesterol and High Density Lipoproteins-cholesterol all three yeast diets were similar and did not differ from the casein diet...|$|R
40|$|Psychotrophic {{bacteria}} produce heat-stable lipase, protease, and phospholipase. Pervious {{studies indicate}} {{the production of}} multiple enzymes in several strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens, but conclusive evidence is lacking. The influence of culture conditions on the production and thermostability of phospholipase, protease, and lipase was investigated in 17 raw milk and environmental isolates. Production and thermostability of the enzymes were influenced by strain, stage of growth, and the culture medium. Cross-reactivity of antibodies raised to a purified protease and a commercial lipase indicated the immunological diversity of the enzymes. Protease purification was undertaken to investigate the production of multiple proteases within a single strain. A single monomeric protease with a molecular weight of 52 kDa was purified from P. fluorescens RO 98. Biochemical characterization of the enzyme revealed {{that it was a}} zinc-metallo acidprotease with pH and temperature optima of 5. 0 35 °C, respectively. The enzyme was thermostable with a D 55 of 41 min and a D 62. 5 of 18 h. Although sensitive assays exist for proteases, they are not suitable for detection of protease activity in milk in the presence of milk proteins. Existing immunoassays approach the required sensitivity but take about 6 h and cannot distinguish between active and inactive enzyme. An immunoassay that can be completed within 2 h and that can detect and distinguish both total and active enzyme was explored. The ratio of these two forms gives insight into the history of the milk. The ability of the purified protease to hydrolyze hydrophobic peptides associated with bitterness in Cheddar cheese was also investigated. Results demonstrated that the protease had the potential to <b>debitter</b> Cheddar cheese because it was able to hydrolyze the bitter peptides commonly found during aging. Two lipolytic enzymes with molecular weights of 50 (Pf-lip 1) and 12 kDa (Pf-lip 2) were purified from P. fluorescens RO 98. Differences were observed in their biochemical properties. D 62. 5 -values of 12. 7 and 29. 9 h were determined for Pf-lip 1 and Pf-lip 2, respectively. Pf-lip 1 preferred longer chain length fatty acids, and Pf-lip 2 preferred shorter chain length substrates. Pf-lip 1 hydrolyzed milk fat and emulsified triolein, but Pf-lip 2 did not, indicating that the latter was an esterase. This information is of significance to the dairy industry because activity tests that assay both the lipolytic enzymes need to be used in order to direct raw milk to short shelf-life products during processing and ensure quality of long shelf-life product...|$|R
40|$|Leucine {{aminopeptidase}} (LAP) {{is used in}} the <b>debitterring</b> of peptides. Aspergillus sojae lap gene was cloned and {{the properties}} of gene product was compared with the purified A. oryzae LAP. Based on enzyme properties and sequence comparison, LAP was proved to be a zinc-dependent enzyme. A. oryzae lap gene was cloned into pQE 30 and its expression was under the control of phage T 5 promotor. The LAP formed inclusion bodies in transformed Escherichia coli NovaBlue. Northern blotting and activity assay indicated that the expression of lap gene was regulated by pH, carbon source, and nitrogen source. The lap gene was highly expressed in alkaline condition and repressed by carbon source (glucose and glycerol) and inorganic nitrogen source (urea and ammonium sulfate). A. oryzae protoplast could be successfully prepared by the enzyme mixture of Novozyme 234 and Yatalase. Pyrithiamine resistant mutants of A. oryzae were generated by UV mutation and their ptrB genes were cloned for the construction of the E. coli — A. oryzae shuttlt vector. Leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) 是用於去除胜肽苦味的酵素。本研究由Aspergillus sojae選殖 lap 基因，並比較A. sojae LAP的酵素性質與Aspergillus oryzae LAP之差異性。由酵素性質分析與序列比對的結果， LAP應該是屬於鋅離子依賴酵素家族的一員。將A. oryzae的 lap 基因選殖到表現載體pQE 30 上，並且利用噬菌體的T 5 啟動子表現lap基因。發現LAP在Escherichia coli NovaBlue菌體內幾乎全部都會形成內涵體。利用北方墨點雜交法及酵素活性分析法，發現lap基因的表現會受到pH值、碳源及氮源的調控。lap基因在鹼性環境下表現量最多，而碳源(glucose與glycerol) 與無機氮源(urea與ammonium sulfate) 卻會抑制其表現。本研究也成功的利用Novozyme 234 與Yatalase建立A. oryzae原生質體的製備方法。利用UV突變，篩選到A. oryzae抗pyrithiamine的突變株，由突變株中選殖ptrA基因，並將其構築在E. coli - A. oryzae穿梭載體上，作為基因轉形之篩選標誌。中文摘要 [...] - 1 英文摘要 [...] - 2 緒論 [...] 3 一. 蛋白質與胜肽類食品 [...] 3 1. 具有生物活性的胜肽 [...] 3 2. 生物活性胜肽在日本市場發展的情形 [...] 4 3. 生物活性胜肽的生產 [...] - 4 4. 蛋白質水解液的介紹 [...] - 5 5. 胜肽的呈味研究 [...] - 6 6. 苦味胜肽的研究 [...] - 7 7. 苦味胜肽的去除 [...] - 9 二.
