40|$|With {{the aging}} of the nuclear park, {{decommissioning}} and <b>dismantling</b> <b>of</b> nuclear <b>installations</b> after their service life is becoming an important issue for the nuclear industry. The radiological characterisation of the equipment and structures present in the reactor and its environment is an essential stage in a decommissioning project since it permits to define and optimize the decommissioning strategy and the disassembling operations. In addition, correct activation estimates are essential for determining the quantity {{and the nature of the}} radiological waste generated during decommissioning. The adoption <b>of</b> efficient <b>dismantling</b> procedures and the optimization of the mass flow going to different waste repositories might reduce substantially the total cost of decommissioning. The present work has been done in the framework of the decommissioning and <b>dismantling</b> <b>of</b> the experimental reactor of the University of Strasburg (RUS). A methodology that combines theoretical calculations and direct measurements has been developed for determining the long-term induced activity in the graphite, concrete and materials present in the reactor. After characterisation of the different elements present in the reactor, it is then possible to plan efficiently the disassembling and <b>dismantling</b> <b>of</b> the system and to optimise the mass flow going to different waste repositories. From a scientific perspective, the comparison of theoretical predictions with experimental values validates the approach and the methodology used in the present study and tests the consistency and the reliability of the nuclear data used for activation analysis...|$|R

5000|$|The various {{government}} actions undertaken since 1979, or 1975, had not {{succeeded in}} stabilising the sector. As {{soon as the}} Tripartite agreements were signed, the companies were once again making demands on the government. The government also undertook an in-depth examination of the real survival chances of Luxembourgish steel production. The task was given to Jean Gandois, a foreign expert who had also been consulted by the Belgian government on the restructuring of its steel industry. This double mandate {{opened the door to}} fruitful collaborations between Belgian and Luxembourgish companies. In his final report, Gandois advocated the concentration on the main sites of ARBED and the <b>dismantling</b> <b>of</b> less performing <b>installations.</b> The restructuring, scheduled to last until 1990, was to reduce average annual production to 3,5 million tonnes of steel, and the workforce to 10,500 workers. On 30 June 1983, the Chamber of Deputies passed a package of laws which came into force on 1 July and enabled the government to pursue the restructuring of the steel industry, in accordance with the Gandois report's recommendations. In parallel, the Luxembourgish government sought to cooperate with its Belgian counterpart in order to bring about collaborations and production exchanges. On 9 September 1983, a meeting took place in Luxembourg between Belgian and Luxembourgish ministers with the goal of defining a common strategy and organising the abandonment of certain sites.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the western}} zones, <b>dismantling</b> and/or {{destruction}} <b>of</b> German industry continued until 1951 {{in accordance to}} the (several times modified) [...] "German level of industry" [...] agreement connected with the Potsdam conference whereby Germany was {{to be treated as}} a single unit and converted into an [...] "agricultural and light industry economy". By the end of 1948 the US had dismantled or destroyed all war-related manufacturing capability in its occupation zone.http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/docpage.cfm?docpage_id=3406 In accordance with the agreements with the USSR, shipment <b>of</b> <b>dismantled</b> industrial <b>installations</b> from the west began on March 31, 1946. Under the terms of the agreement the Soviet Union would in return ship raw materials such as food and timber to the western zones. When the Soviets did not fulfil their side of the agreement, the US temporarily halted shipments east, and they were never resumed. It was later shown that although utilized for cold war propaganda reasons, the main reason for halting shipments east was not the behavior of the USSR but rather the recalcitrant behavior of France. Material received by the USSR included equipment from the Kugel-Fischer ballbearing plant at Schweinfurt, the Daimler-Benz underground aircraft-engine plant at Obrigheim, the Deschimag shipyards at Bremen-Weser, and the Gendorf powerplant.http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/docpage.cfm?docpage_id=3403,http://images.library.wisc.edu/History/EFacs/GerRecon/omg1946n039/reference/history.omg1946n039.i0007.pdf ...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{number of}} technological equipment and high-skilled workers {{over long periods}} of time have to be mobilized during nuclear decommissioning processes. The related operations generate complex flows of waste and high inventory levels, associated to information flows of heterogeneous types. Taking into account that more than 10 decommissioning operations are on-going in France and about 50 are expected toward 2025 : A big challenge is addressed today. The management <b>of</b> decommissioning and <b>dismantling</b> <b>of</b> nuclear <b>installations</b> represents an important part of the nuclear-based energy lifecycle, since it has an environmental impact as well as an important influence on the electricity cost and therefore the price for end-users. Bringing new technologies and new solutions into decommissioning methodologies is thus mandatory to improve the quality, cost and delay efficiency of these operations. The purpose of our project is to improve decommissioning management efficiency by developing a decision-support framework dedicated to plan nuclear facility decommissioning operations and to optimize waste evacuation by means of a logistic approach. The target is to create an easy-to-handle tool capable of i) predicting waste flows and proposing the best decommissioning logistics scenario and ii) managing information during all the steps of the process and following the progress: planning, resources, delays, authorizations, saturation zones, waste volume, etc. In this article we present our results from waste nuclear flows simulation during decommissioning process, including discrete-event simulation supported by FLEXSIM 3 -D software. This approach was successfully tested and our works confirms its ability to improve this type of industrial process by identifying the critical points of the chain and optimizing it by identifying improvement actions. This type of simulation, executed before the start of the process operations on the basis of a first conception, allow ‘what-if’ process evaluation and help to ensure quality of the process in an uncertain context. The simulation of nuclear waste flows before evacuation from the site will help reducing the cost and duration of the decommissioning process by optimizing the planning and the use of resources, transitional storage and expensive radioactive waste containers. Additional benefits are expected for the governance system of the waste evacuation since it will enable a shared responsibility of the waste flows...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the work that}} has been jointly carried out, based on a common and complementary programme by Taywood Engineering Ltd (TEL), Stangenberg Schnellenbach und Partner (SSP) and National Nuclear Corporation (NNC) on the long-term integrity of nuclear power plant structures. Currently deferral is considered as a preferred option for the <b>dismantling</b> <b>of</b> nuclear <b>installations.</b> There is, however, the need to determine the measures required for maintaining shutdown plants in a safe condition and to assess the radiological consequences and costs. TEL and SSP have worked on similar aspects of the examination and long-term assessment of nuclear power structures. This included substantiation of predictive models on the mode and pace of deterioration of nuclear plant structures and theoretical analyses of the destressing options available for both nonded and unbonded prestressing tendons. NNC has separately assessed the risk of rapid stress corrosion cracking of carbon/low ally steels and intergranular attack of stainless steel components. The study concludes that: after 150 years from construction, a majority of all areas could still be passive. Predicted times for the carbonation front to reach reinforcement positions range from 44 years to well in excess of 1000 years. Predictions based on measured levels to chloride within the concrete indicate that a substantial percentage of steel is unlikely to become depassivated within 150 years. During decommissioning, prestress levels can be safely reduced on both bonded and unbonded prestressed concrete pressure vessels in a controlled manner. The predictions have shown {{that it is only}} in the worst cases of complete destressing that comparatively small levels of tensile stresses are obtained in parts of the pressure vessels. Measurements made of the quantities of nitric acid concentration in the atmosphere within reactor R 1 at Berkeley show quantities much lower than the predictions had indicated. Limited video inspections of the insides of Berkeley and Latina show no evidence of serious corrosion. (orig.)
