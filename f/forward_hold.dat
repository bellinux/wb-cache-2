5|$|Previous {{practices}} had required {{ships to}} withstand the flooding of a single <b>forward</b> <b>hold,</b> but did not guard against situations where two holds would flood. The case where two after (rear) holds are flooded is no better, because the engine room is quickly flooded, leaving the ship without propulsion. If two holds {{in the middle of}} the ship are flooded, the stress on the hull can become so great that the ship snaps in two.|$|E
25|$|On 23 July 1958, a {{question}} was asked in Parliament by George Lawson, MP {{as to whether}} a date had been set for an inquiry into the loss of Narva. The Rt. Hon. Airey Neave, then Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation replied that the inquiry would open in Glasgow on 12 November 1958. The inquiry lasted two days, it determined {{that the cause of}} the loss of Narva was through water entering her <b>forward</b> <b>hold</b> through unknown causes, with no fault being found {{on the part of the}} crew.|$|E
500|$|The Royal Navy {{purchased}} Campania {{from the}} shipbreakers on 27 November 1914 for £32,500, initially for conversion to an {{armed merchant cruiser}} equipped with eight quick-firing [...] guns. The ship was converted by Cammell Laird to an aircraft carrier instead and the two forward 4.7-inch guns were deleted in favour of a [...] flying-off deck. Two derricks were fitted on each side to transfer seaplanes between {{the water and the}} two holds. The amidships hold had the capacity for seven large seaplanes. The <b>forward</b> <b>hold,</b> underneath the flight deck, could fit four small seaplanes, but the flight deck had to be lifted off the hold to access the airplanes. HMS Campania was commissioned on 17 April 1915.|$|E

2500|$|Overall {{the ship}} had a license to {{transport}} 191 passengers total in coastal trips. [...] The ship {{was designed to be}} operated with a crew of 38. [...] Cargo capacity was 150 tons, in a single <b>forward</b> <b>hold</b> that was served by two 34-foot derricks that could lift four tons of cargo. [...] There were four decks on the ship.|$|E
2500|$|Early on {{the morning}} of 22 February 1949 the Bombo left Sydney for Kiama, {{arriving}} there at 9:40am. She immediately commenced loading another cargo of blue metal, and by 11:40am was ready to put to sea with [...] of stone in the <b>forward</b> <b>hold</b> and [...] in the aft. At the time, harbour conditions were calm with a light southerly blowing, but a strong southerly change was shortly expected.|$|E
2500|$|On 31 March, {{she entered}} the patrol area in the Caroline Islands, and, on 1 April 1943, she {{conducted}} submerged patrols off North Pass Island, Truk, {{and later in the}} day on the Japanese naval base's western approaches. Failing to find any action in these areas, she surfaced late in the afternoon on 2 April and set her course for the channel between Puluwat Island and Pulap Island. Later that day, as she patrolled off Alet Island, Tunny made radar contact with a ship dead ahead. Heading in for a flank attack, she sighted a [...] astern of her chosen target. Tunny launched three torpedoes from [...] and noted a hit in the <b>forward</b> <b>hold</b> of the Japanese cargo ship before diving to [...] to avoid the attention of the destroyer. Minutes later, a series of nine depth charges tumbled down in search of the submarine, but exploded at too shallow a depth to achieve their purpose. Some 15minutes later, as Tunny started up to take a look, she was jolted by a deep-set depth charge which caught her at , but caused only minor damage—a {{small price to pay for}} the sinking of Toyo Maru Number2. Before midnight, the destroyer gave up the search, and the submarine surfaced and set her course for the Namonuito group to the north.|$|E

2500|$|On 6 April 1917, the day Congress {{declared}} war on Germany, Itasca was in the harbor at San Juan, Puerto Rico and prevented the interned German ship KD-III from being scuttled by her crew. Heroic efforts by the engineer division of Itasca managed to block the sabotaged sea valves in the engine room of KD-III even though the valves were under several feet of seawater. With the flooding finally under control, there was [...] {{of water in the}} after hold and [...] in the <b>forward</b> <b>hold.</b> Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels commended the Itasca salvage team and gave the leader of the team, First Lieutenant (Eng.) Carl M. Green a special letter of commendation. With the declaration of war, Itasca was reassigned to the Fourth Naval District headquartered at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and refit for anti-submarine service with the addition of three-inch rapid fire guns and a Y-gun for launching depth charges. She was assigned patrol duties from the southern New Jersey coast to the entrance of Delaware Bay based out of Cold Spring, New Jersey. After the armistice, Itasca returned to the academy as a training vessel, but a shortage of personnel prevented her from being manned. Her last training cruise was completed during the summer of 1920 arriving in New London on 3 October. A replacement training vessel, the former barkentine-rigged gunboat [...] was acquired from the Navy on 1 July 1921 and renamed Alexander Hamilton on 18 August 1922. Itasca was decommissioned and sold in Baltimore, Maryland for $8250.00 on 11 May 1922 to Mr. Charles A. Jarding.|$|E
6000|$|... "The corsair {{was lying}} {{alongside}} of us, her shrouds lashed to ours. There {{was a long}} jabbering among the Moors when they had taken off our hatches and seen that we were pretty well full up with cargo; then, after a bit, we were kicked, and they made signs {{for us to get}} on our feet and to cross over into their ship. The crew were sent down into the <b>forward</b> <b>hold,</b> and some men went down with them to tie them up securely. John Wilkes, Pettigrew, and myself were shoved down into a bit of a place below the stern cabin. Our legs were tied, as well as our arms. The trap was shut, and there we were in the dark. Of course I told Pettigrew that, though he had failed in his duty, and it had turned out badly, he wasn't to be blamed as if he had gone to sleep in sight of an enemy.|$|E

50|$|Claymore had {{the latest}} navigational aids of the day, radar, Decca, an {{echo-sounder}} and wireless-telegraphy. A <b>forward</b> <b>hold</b> and 7.5 ton derrick {{allowed her to}} carry 100 tons of cargo and 26 head of cattle. Up to eleven cars could be lifted on board.|$|E
50|$|Following the sinking, Eastcliffe Hall′s {{protruding}} masts {{and cargo}} were removed and the forward superstructure was dynamited {{back into the}} <b>forward</b> <b>hold</b> to clear the site as a navigational hazard.

50|$|Some salvage {{was done}} {{at the time of}} her loss before the <b>forward</b> <b>holds</b> flooded and much of the cargo in the stern section was {{salvaged}} by an Icelandic firm in 1953 with further salvage work completed in 1967.|$|R

Since it was not possible to extinguish the fire, Golden Fleece put in at Halifax, the nearest port, two days later.|$|E
