25|$|Whistles come <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>shapes</b> <b>and</b> sizes, {{but their}} {{operation}} can be unified through {{the concepts of}} dynamic and geometric similarity. Nature knows nothing of the specific measurement systems we use; it cares only about ratios between the various forces, time scales, and the several dimensions. To compare them {{we need to take}} into account the established ratios that are relevant to whistle operation.|$|E
25|$|Fringe venues come <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>shapes</b> <b>and</b> sizes, {{with use}} being made of nearly any viable space that is available, from regular theatres (e.g. the Traverse or Bedlam Theatre), {{function}} rooms (e.g. the Assembly Rooms), churches and church halls (e.g. the Quaker Meeting House, Paradise in Augustines), lecture theatres (including the notable George Square Theatre), conference centres, other university rooms and spaces, bars and pubs, temporary structures (The Famous Spiegeltent and the Udderbelly), schools, a public toilet, {{the back of}} a taxi, a double-decker bus and even in the audience's own homes.|$|E
25|$|The Sioux {{people of}} South Dakota {{believed}} {{that in the}} first creatures in creation were the insects and reptiles, who were ruled by the Water Monster Unktehi. Reptiles were very diverse and came <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>shapes</b> <b>and</b> sizes, but they became violent and bloodthirsty until they were petrified by lightning sent by the Thunder Birds. The physical bodies of the Thunder Beings killed by the lightning, including Unktehi, also ended up being buried. The Sioux believe that earth has a history of four distinct ages. These events occurred during the Age of Rock. This portrayal of the Thunder Birds may also have been influenced by associations of fossils of Pteranodon with marine reptiles of the same age in the western United States.|$|E

2500|$|Edmonds said in 2008 {{that he is}} {{constantly}} accompanied by two melon-sized [...] "spiritual energy" [...] balls, which appear over his shoulders and which he believes to be the spirits of his dead parents. [...] "Orbs are little bundles of positive energy {{and they think they}} can move between 500 and 1,000 miles per hour," [...] according to Edmonds. [...] "They look like little round planets but they come <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>shapes</b> <b>and</b> sizes." [...] He has asserted that the orbs appear only on digital photographs.|$|E

The pieces are generally made to order based on designs preapproved by the client. Orders range in size for a setting for four to the entire dish set for restaurants. Many of their clients buy wares in bulk {{although there is no}} minimum.|$|E
60|$|Whether such {{observations}} {{were intended to}} be flattering or sarcastic, I must respectfully decline to accept the compliment, or to apply the sarcasm to myself. I object to obliquity of procedure and ambiguity of speech <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>shapes.</b> <b>And</b> I confess that I {{find it difficult to}} understand the state of mind which leads any one to suppose, that deep respect for single-minded devotion to high aims is incompatible with the unhesitating conviction that those aims include the propagation of doctrines which are devoid of foundation--perhaps even mischievous.|$|E

60|$|He {{could now}} earn money faster, and, {{as his father}} insisted on having all his {{earnings}} expended for articles for Georgie's own use, and Jonas used to help him about expending it, he got, at last, quite a variety of implements and articles. He had some wire, and a little pair of pliers for bending it <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>shapes,</b> <b>and</b> a hammer and little nails. He had also a paint-box and brushes, and paper of various colors, for lining boxes, and making portfolios and pocket-books; and he had varnishes, red, green, blue, and black. All these he kept in his drawers and shelves, and made a great many ingenious things with them.|$|E
60|$|As {{my party}} {{were a little}} behind, I had time to stop and meditate. I fancied a dark, misty night, and the tramp of a party of {{horsemen}} coming up the rocky path to the gateway; the parley at the wicket; the unbarred doors, creaking on their rusty hinges,--one, two, three,--are opened; in clatters the cavalcade. In the midst of armed men with visors down, a monk in cowl and gown, and with that firm look about the lips which is so characteristic in Luther's portraits. But here our party came up, and the vision was dispelled. As none of us knew a word of German, we stood rather irresolutely looking at the buildings which, <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>shapes</b> <b>and</b> varieties, surround the court. I went into one room--it was a pantry; into another--it was a wash room; into a third--it was a sitting room, garnished with antlers, and hung round with hard old portraits of princes and electors, and occupied by Germans smoking and drinking beer. One is sure that in this respect one cannot fail of seeing the place {{as it was in}} Luther's time. If they were Germans, of course they drank beer out of tall, narrow beer glasses; that is as immutable a fact as the old stones of the battlement.|$|E
60|$|The {{scene that}} Aziel saw from his window was a busy one, for beneath him a market {{was being held}} in an open square in the city. Here, {{sheltered}} from the sun by grass-thatched booths, the Phoenician merchants who had been his companions in their long and perilous journey from the coast were already in treaty with numerous customers, hoping, not in vain, to recoup themselves amply for the toils and dangers which they had survived. Beneath these booths were spread their goods; silks from Cos, bronze weapons and copper rods, or ingots from the rich mines of Cyprus, linens and muslins from Egypt; beads, idols, carven bowls, knives, glass ware, pottery <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>shapes,</b> <b>and</b> charms made of glazed faience or Egyptian stone; bales of the famous purple cloth of Tyre; surgical instruments, jewellery, and objects of toilet; scents, pots of rouge, and other unguents {{for the use of}} ladies in little alabaster and earthenware vases; bags of refined salt, and a thousand other articles of commerce produced or stored in the workshops of Phoenicia. These the chapmen bartered for raw gold by weight, tusks of ivory, ostrich feathers, and girls of approved beauty, slaves taken in war, or in some instances maidens whom their unnatural parents or relatives did not scruple to sell into bondage.|$|E
50|$|Spinning, {{the use of}} an {{artificial}} lure, is also widely used for predators. These can come <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>shapes,</b> sizes <b>and</b> colours, to mimic injured fish and small fast fish. Used at all depths, these can be an exciting method to catch Pike and Perch.|$|R

6000|$|When the Bishop {{published}} his History, {{there was a}} popish plot on foot, the Duke of York a known papist was presumptive heir to the crown, the House of Commons would not hear of any expedient for securing their religion under a popish prince, nor would the King or Lords, consent to a bill of exclusion: The French King was in {{the height of his}} grandeur, and the vigour of his age. At this day the presumptive heir, with that whole illustrious family, are Protestants, the Popish Pretender excluded for ever by several acts of Parliament, and every person in the smallest employment, as well as the members in both Houses, obliged to abjure him. The French King is at the lowest ebb of life; his armies have been conquered and his towns won from him for ten years together, and his kingdom is in danger of being torn by divisions during a long minority. Are these cases parallel? Or are we now in more danger of France and popery than we were thirty years ago? What can be the motive for advancing such false, such detestable assertions? What conclusions would his Lordship draw from such premises as these? If injurious appellations were of any advantage to a cause, (as the style of our adversaries would make us believe) what appellations would those deserve who thus endeavour to sow the seeds of sedition, and are impatient to see the fruits? [...] "But," [...] saith he[20], [...] "the deaf adder stops her ear let the charmer charm never so wisely." [...] True, my Lord, there are indeed too many adders in this nation's bosom, adders <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>shapes,</b> <b>and</b> in all habits, whom neither the Queen nor parliament can charm to loyalty, truth, religion, or honour.|$|E

In addition to this extraordinary diversity in physical and behavioral characteristics, lizards have evolved many interesting ways to communicate.|$|R
