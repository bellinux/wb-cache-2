The company was permitted to offer customers the highest resolution imagery available from their constellation. Additionally, the updated approvals allowed the sale of imagery to customers at up to 25 cm panchromatic and 100 cm multispectral <b>ground</b> <b>sample</b> distance (GSD), beginning six months after WorldView-3 became operational.

5000|$|Geometric {{resolution}} {{refers to}} the satellite sensor's ability to effectively image {{a portion of the}} Earth's surface in a single pixel and is typically expressed in terms of <b>Ground</b> <b>sample</b> distance, or GSD. GSD is a term containing the overall optical and systemic noise sources and is useful for comparing how well one sensor can [...] "see" [...] an object on the ground within a single pixel. For example, the GSD of Landsat is ~30m, which means the smallest unit that maps to a single pixel within an image is ~30m x 30m. The latest commercial satellite (GeoEye 1) has a GSD of 0.41 m. This compares to a 0.3 m resolution obtained by some early military film based Reconnaissance satellite such as Corona.|$|E
5000|$|In the 19th century, work {{continued}} on finding the chemical formula for fulminating gold. Carl Wilhelm Scheele found and proved that ammonia was what drove {{the formation of}} the complex and that upon detonation the gas formed was primarily nitrogen gas. Jean Baptiste Dumas went further and found that in addition to gold and nitrogen, fulminating gold also had hydrogen and chlorine in it. He then decomposed a <b>ground</b> <b>sample</b> with copper (II) oxide to find that it was a salt with an ammonium cation and a cold nitrogen complex as the cation. Ernst Weitz continued studying the compound with state of the art techniques and concluded that fulminating gold was a mixture of “diamido-imido-aurichloride” and 2Au(OH)3.3NH3 [...] He managed to ignore the poor solubility of the complex in most solvents, but noted that it did dissolve readily in aqueous gold (III), ammonia, and chloride systems. His conclusion on the formula proved to be incorrect but offered a fair estimate for later scientists to jump from.|$|E

40|$|X-ray {{diffraction}} (XRD) scan {{profiles of}} {{medium carbon steel}} <b>ground</b> <b>samples</b> were analyzed to assess the grinding induced plastic deformation. Broadening of XRD scan profiles with higher downfeed indicated the possible plastic deformation. XRD scan profiles were studied to measure full width at half maximum (FWHM) of profiles for assessment of plastic deformation at various level of downfeed. FWHM analysis revealed that FWHM increases with downfeed owing to plastic deformation. Grain size of deformed layers was also estimated using Scherrer equation to verify the results obtained through FWHM analysis. Grain size was observed to decrease with downfeed due to associated plastic deformation. Assessment of grinding induced plastic deformation using XRD profiles demonstrated the applicability of this new approach for qualitative measurement of surface integrity characteristics like microhardness and surface roughness.

After screening, the Weibull plots of perpendicular <b>ground</b> <b>sample</b> bent to become a convex curve while plots in the high strength region remained almost the same, indicating that low strength samples were selectively eliminated by the high voltage screening.

Modified partial least squares regression for the overall samples showed satisfactory predictive ability for intact (coefficient of determination in cross-validation, R 2 CV= 0. 93) and <b>ground</b> <b>samples</b> (R 2 CV= 0. 95). Despite the low number of samples, good specific prediction models were developed for each commercial meat category.

Seedlings of soybean cultivar Williams 82 grown in spaceflight or at unit gravity were untreated or inoculated with the soybean root rot pathogen P. sojae. At 3, 6 and 7 d after launch {{while still in}} microgravity, seedlings were photographed and then fixed for subsequent microscopic analysis. Post-landing analysis of the seedlings revealed that at harvest day 7 the length of untreated roots did not differ between flight and <b>ground</b> <b>samples.</b> However, the flight-grown roots infected with P. sojae showed more disease symptoms (percentage of brown and macerated areas) and the root tissues were more extensively colonized relative to the ground controls exposed to the fungus.

40|$|Earth surface {{systems are}} {{controlled}} {{by a combination of}} global and local factors, which cannot be understood without accounting for both the local and global components. The system dynamics cannot be recovered from the global or local controls alone. Ground forest inventory is able to accurately estimate forest carbon stocks at sample plots, but these sample plots are too sparse to support the spatial simulation of carbon stocks with required accuracy. Satellite observation is an important source of global information for the simulation of carbon stocks. Satellite remote-sensing can supply spatially continuous information about the surface of forest carbon stocks, which is impossible from ground-based investigations, but their description has considerable uncertainty. In this paper, we validated the Lund-Potsdam-Jena dynamic global vegetation model (LPJ), the Kriging method for spatial interpolation of <b>ground</b> <b>sample</b> plots and a satellite-observation-based approach as well as an approach for fusing the <b>ground</b> <b>sample</b> plots with satellite observations and an assimilation method for incorporating the <b>ground</b> <b>sample</b> plots into LPJ. The validation results indicated that both the data fusion and data assimilation approaches reduced the uncertainty of estimating carbon stocks. The data fusion had the lowest uncertainty by using an existing method for high accuracy surface modeling to fuse the <b>ground</b> <b>sample</b> plots with the satellite observations (HASM-SOA). The estimates produced with HASM-SOA were 26. 1 and 28. 4 % more accurate than the satellite-based approach and spatial interpolation of the sample plots, respectively. Forest carbon stocks of 7. 08 Pg were estimated for China during the period from 2004 to 2008, an increase of 2. 24 Pg from 1984 to 2008, using the preferred HASM-SOA method...|$|E
