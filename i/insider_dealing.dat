2500|$|Building societies, like mutual life insurers, arose {{as people}} clubbed {{together}} {{to address a}} common need interest; {{in the case of}} the building societies, this was housing and members were originally both savers and borrowers. But it very quickly became clear that 'outsider' savers were needed whose motive was profit through interest on deposits. Thus permanent building societies quickly became mortgage banks and in such institutions there always existed a conflict of interest between borrowers and savers. It was the task of the movement to reconcile that conflict of interest so as to enable savers to conclude that their interests and those of borrowers were to some extent complementary rather than conflictive. Conflict of interest between savers and borrowers was never fully reconciled in the building societies but upon deregulation that reconciliation became something of a lost cause. The management of building societies apparently could expend considerable time and resources (which belonged the organisation) planning their effective capture—of as much of the assets as they could. If so, this is arguably <b>insider</b> <b>dealing</b> on a grand scale with the benefit of inside specialist knowledge of the business and resources of the firm not shared with outsiders like politicians and members (and, perhaps, regulators). Once the opportunity to claim was presented by management the savers in particular could be relied upon to seize it. There were sufficient hard up borrowers to take the inducement offered them by management (in spite of few simple sums sufficing to demonstrate that they were probably going to end up effectively paying back the inducement).

The <b>insider</b> <b>deal</b> called for the expensive project to be constructed entirely at city expense, {{despite the fact that the}} mansion was located a half mile outside the city limits at the time. The contract was cancelled, Pittock's public image tarnished, and he was reportedly enraged by the incident.|$|R
40|$|Before 1914, London had a stock {{exchange}} that was larger and qualitatively more developed than New York’s. Yet the London Stock Exchange {{has received a}} bad press from historians, while the New York Exchange has achieved star billing. This forensic reexamination of J. P Morgan—a player in both markets—suggests that such a historiography is egregiously biased. Morgan’s higher profits in New York derived partly from <b>insider</b> <b>deals</b> and partly from monopolistic exactions that U. S. protectionism facilitated but that proved more problematic in the U. K. ’s open, competitive markets. Morgan’s contributions to the impressive catch-up process by the New York Exchange are more plausibly viewed as successful emulation of European securities-market precedents on routine matters than of the allegedly path-breaking “information-signaling” innovations of more Panglossian accounts...|$|R

5000|$|The matter {{gained the}} {{attention}} of Mike Wallace who investigated the church in a report for 60 Minutes. Wallace alleged {{that there had been}} lavish secret expenditures, conflict of interest <b>insider</b> <b>deals,</b> posh homes and lifestyles in the higher ranks, and the heavy involvement of Stanley Rader in financial manipulation. No legal charges were leveled against Herbert W. Armstrong, Stanley Rader, or the Worldwide Church of God. Wallace invited Rader to appear on 60 Minutes on April 15, 1979. Wallace showed Rader a secret tape recording in which Herbert Armstrong clearly stated to C. Wayne Cole, who was made temporary acting head of the church by Herbert Armstrong, that Rader was attempting to take over the church after Armstrong's death, reasoning that the donated tithe money was the incentive and quite a [...] "magnet" [...] to Stan Rader. Rader abruptly ended the interview. This tape was made during a conversation about Stanley Rader by Herbert W. Armstrong, and C. Wayne Cole.

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to an ongoing {{debate about the}} drivers and mechanism of corporate law reforms which have put greater emphasis on shareholder rights and shifted the legal framework of corporate governance towards market control in many advanced capitalist countries. Supplementing existing research on corporate law reforms I highlight the impact of legal ideology on political decision making and the role German law professors have played in corporate law reforms. After a theoretical introduction {{about the role of}} law professors as institutional entrepreneurs, the paper examines how the underlying assumptions in academic writings about basic concepts and principles of German corporate law have evolved over the last 30 years. It is shown that “corporatist ” theories which had been prominent in the 1970 s were outcompeted by a contractarian style of legal reasoning in the 1990 s. After contractarianism had gained intellectual authority its scholars became involved in parliamentary hearings and Commissions on corporate law reform. Picking up the ideational templates provided by “law & economics ” the legislators created a securities exchange agency, extended disclosure requirements, banned <b>insider</b> <b>deals,</b> legalized shareholder oriented practices, introduced takeover regulation, and thereby shifted corporate law from state control to capital markets...|$|R

In 1985 he masterminded the hijacking of the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro. During the hijacking, 69-year-old wheelchair-bound American Jewish passenger Leon Klinghoffer, was shot dead and thrown overboard. The four hijackers, fearful of United States military intervention, surrendered to Egypt in return for safe passage out of Egypt, based on the pretext that they had done no harm to any of the passengers. Four F-14 aircraft from the U.S. 6th Fleet intercepted the plane carrying the hijackers to Tunisia and escorted it to Sigonella, a NATO base in Italy. There they discovered that Zaidan and PLO political officer Hassan were also on the plane. <b>Insider</b> <b>deals</b> within the Italian government made them both flown from Sigonella to Rome. From there, Zaidan and Hassan boarded a Yugoslav civilian airliner bound for Belgrade, Yugoslavia. Despite American requests for the extradition of Zaidan from Yugoslavia, he was not extradited because of Yugoslav relations with the PLO. He then flew to Aden, South Yemen and from there to Baghdad, where Saddam Hussein sheltered him from extradition to Italy. He remained in Iraq and commanded the PLF (reunited in 1989) until the American invasion of Iraq in 2003.|$|R
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of December 1652, Bern devalued its copper Batzen by 50% to adjust its face value to its intrinsic value to combat the inflation. The authorities set a term of only three days to exchange the copper coins at the old rate against more stable gold or silver money. Not many people could thus {{take advantage of this}} exchange offer, and for most—and in particular the rural population—half their fortunes just vanished. The other cantons soon followed suit and similarly devalued the Bernese copper money. The situation was most dire in the Lucerne Entlebuch valley, where the Bernese Batzen were in widespread usage. The financial situation of many a peasant became unsustainable. <b>Insider</b> <b>deals</b> of the ruling magistrates of Lucerne furthered the unrest among the population. The peasants of the Entlebuch valley, led by Hans Emmenegger from Schüpfheim and Christian Schybi from Escholzmatt, sent a delegation to Lucerne to demand remedies, but the city council refused to even hear them. The enraged peasants organized a general assembly (Landsgemeinde) {{of the population of the}} valley at Heiligkreuz, in spite of such assemblies being illegal as the authorities' laws of the time denied the freedom of assembly. The assembly, which took place after the mass on February 10, 1653, decided to suspend all tax payments until the authorities in Lucerne fulfilled their demands by reducing taxes and abolishing some of them altogether, such as the taxes on salt, cattle, and horse trades.|$|R

5000|$|In {{published}} {{comments about}} The Navigator, Pocalyko described his novel as [...] "an up-to-the-minute financial thriller" [...] {{that is also}} [...] "a big-idea book." [...] The overarching literary leitmotif is the interplay of big government and big business in the digital economy. The book's major themes are PTSD and its next-generation effects, financial regulation, clandestine intelligence operations, fathers and sons, competition between brothers, interracial romance, banks too big to fail, <b>insider</b> technology <b>deals,</b> political ambition, German guilt, Israeli justice, Arab honor, and [...] "how the past is never really the past, even if it's not your own past." [...] The Holocaust is an important underpinning of the novel. Pocalyko's father was a liberator at Bergen-Belsen, an experience that he fictionalizes in the novel's dark, intense prologue. The author is fluent in German, a language that figures very significantly in the The Navigator.|$|R
