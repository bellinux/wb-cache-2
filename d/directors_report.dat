40|$|The {{proposed}} federal Early Learning Challenge Fund (ELCF) aims {{to improve}} the quality of early care and education programs by promoting the integration of more stringent program and early learning standards than are typically found in child care centers. ELCF grantees also must outline their plans for professional development and technical assistance to support these efforts. With the aim of informing potential ELCF grantees, this article reports the results of a statewide survey of 391 child care center directors focusing on the source of their preschool learning expectations and program standards. The majority of surveyed <b>directors</b> <b>report</b> that the state’s child care licensing standards are used. Additional <b>directors</b> <b>report</b> that the state’s prekindergarten program standards or early learning standards serve as their current source. However, other responses indicate that the terms “program standards” and “learning standards” themselves may not even be part of the current child care vocabulary. These results suggest that potential ELCF grantees might be better positioned to help child care centers incorporate stricter program and learning standards if they design varying levels of training and technical assistance based on the variety of child care quality “starting points. ...|$|E

40|$|Standards-based reform {{activity}} dominated K- 12 education {{during the}} 1990 s, reflecting {{a consensus that}} improving learning requires state-level curricular standards and examinations. Opponents argue state-imposed standards and tests overly burden districts, degrade teaching and learning, suffer from numerous technical problems, and have failed to improve achievement. These concerns have been raised by opponents, particularly parents, of Wisconsin's Model Academic Standards and Student Assessment System (WSAS), and lobby groups succeeded derailing early plans for a high school graduation test. Despite opposition, efforts to implement standards-based initiatives are impressive, and interview data from 50 Wisconsin school districts indicate curriculum directors view them favorably.

40|$|This study {{examines}} how the informational quality of annual accounting earnings, {{varies according to}} the size and composition {{of the board of}} directors of publicly listed firms within the Greek capital market. Data analysis over a period of five years (2000 - 2004) revealed that the informativeness of annual accounting earnings is positively related to the fraction of outside directors serving on the board, but it is not related to board size. Additionally, firms with a higher proportion of outside board members proved to be more conservative when reporting bad news but on the contrary they do not display greater timeliness on the recognition of good news. Finally, firms with a higher proportion of outside <b>directors</b> <b>report</b> earnings of higher quality compared to firms with a low proportion of outside directors.
