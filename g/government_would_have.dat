Meanwhile, rise in unemployment would further impact budget income.|$|E
5|$|Haas {{suggests}} that the labour mobilization patterns revealed by the archaeological evidence point to a unique emergence of human government, one of two alongside Sumer (or three, if Mesoamerica is included as a separate case). While in other cases, the idea of <b>government</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been borrowed or copied, in this small group, government was invented. Other archaeologists have rejected such claims as hyperbolic.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{the value}} of foreign {{currency}} bonds which matured {{in the remainder of}} 2008 was only $600 million, and foreign currency debt service in 2009 was only $215 million, well within the government's ability to pay. However the agencies believed that the <b>government</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to issue more foreign currency bonds, both to cover losses as the banks' overseas operations are liquidated and also to stimulate demand in the domestic economy as Iceland goes into recession.|$|E

5000|$|Jackson's staffer Richard Perle {{said in an}} {{interview}} that the idea belonged to Jackson, who believed that the right to emigrate was the most powerful among the human rights in certain respects: [...] "if people could vote with their feet, <b>governments</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to acknowledge that and <b>governments</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to make for their citizens a life that would keep them there." [...] While there was some opposition, the American Jewish establishment on the whole and Soviet Jewry activists (particularly the Washington Committee for Soviet Jewry and the National Conference on Soviet Jewry) supported the amendment over Nixon's and Kissinger's objections.|$|R
5|$|Sang Penari {{touches on}} the history of {{communism}} in Indonesia, focusing on the nation's communist party spreading its ideology and the government's purge of the Communist Party's members from 1965â€“1966, which is thought to have killed several hundred thousand. It is only the third Indonesian film to cover the killings, following Arifin C. Noer's G30S/PKI (1984) and Riri Riza's Gie (2005). Tohari later said that if he had written about the killings as they were depicted in the film, the repressive New Order <b>government</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had him shot.|$|E
5|$|The Convention {{agreed on}} several principles. Most importantly, {{they agreed that}} the Convention should go beyond its mandate merely to amend the Articles of Confederation, and instead should produce a new {{constitution}} outright. While some delegates thought this illegal, the Articles of Confederation were closer to a treaty between sovereign states than they were to a national constitution, so the genuine legal problems were limited. Another principle they agreed on was that the new <b>government</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> all {{the powers of the}} Confederation Congress, plus additional powers over the states. Once agreeing on these principles, the Convention voted on the Virginia plan and signaled their approval for it. Once this was done, they began modifying it.|$|E
5|$|While Britain {{may have}} been militarily secure in 1940, both sides {{were aware of the}} {{possibility}} of a political collapse. If the Germans had won the Battle of Britain, the Luftwaffe {{would have been able to}} strike anywhere in southern England and with the prospect of an invasion, the British <b>government</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> come under pressure to come to terms: the extensive anti-invasion preparations demonstrated to Germany and to the people of Britain that whatever happened in the air, the United Kingdom was both able and willing to defend itself.|$|E
50|$|For a {{sporting}} event like the Super Bowl, Coleman said local <b>governments</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had to offer large tax breaks and other concessions to attract athletes and attendees for a one-day event.

5000|$|The Accord <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{substantially}} {{altered the}} status of Aboriginal groups in Canadian political society. Under the Accord, an Aboriginal right to self-government <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been enshrined in the Canadian Constitution. Moreover, the Accord <b>would</b> <b>have</b> recognized Aboriginal <b>governments</b> as a third order of government, analogous {{to the federal government}} and the provinces. In other words, Aboriginal <b>governments</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been granted their own order of <b>government,</b> which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been constitutionally autonomous from the federal and provincial levels of government. Aboriginal legislation, however, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been required to be consistent with the principles of [...] "peace, order, and good government in Canada", and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been subject to judicial review under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.|$|R
50|$|The {{policy was}} widely {{felt to be}} a {{hangover}} from the previous Labour government and one that few Conservative <b>governments</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> implemented. Many believed that the plan <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> been pursued except for both a desire to prove the government's nonpartisan credentials and Conservative leader Stanley Baldwin's determination to implement the policy.|$|R
5|$|Australia {{returned}} to Sydney in November 1921, and was paid off into reserve in December. By this time battlecruisers built before the Battle of Jutland were considered obsolete, {{and there is}} no record of the Admiralty suggesting that Australia purchase a replacement. Moreover, {{it is unlikely that the}} Australian <b>Government</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> agreed to such a suggestion given the prevailing political and financial conditions. As the Admiralty had decided to phase out 12-inch guns and had stopped the manufacture of shells for these weapons shortly after the war, it would have been necessary to replace Australias main armament once the Navy's stock of shells reached their expiry date given that it was not possible to produce replacement shells in Australia. This was also not financially feasible for the government, particularly given the RAN's lack of interest in retaining the ship.|$|E
5|$|In 1828, Ernest {{was staying}} with the King at Windsor Castle when severe {{disturbances}} broke out in Ireland among Catholics. The Duke was an ardent supporter of the Protestant cause in Ireland, and returned to Berlin in August, believing that the Government, led by the Duke of Wellington, would deal firmly with the Irish. In January 1829, the Wellington Government {{announced that it would}} introduce a Catholic emancipation bill to conciliate the Irish. Disregarding a request from Wellington that he remain abroad, Ernest returned to London, {{and was one of the}} leaders against the Catholic Relief Act 1829, influencing King George against the bill. Within days of his arrival, the King instructed the officers of his Household to vote against the Bill. Hearing of this, Wellington told the King that he must resign as Prime Minister unless the King could assure him of complete support. The King initially accepted Wellington's resignation, and Ernest attempted to put together a government united against Catholic emancipation. Though such a <b>government</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> considerable support in the House of Lords, it would have little support in the Commons, and Ernest abandoned his attempt. The King recalled Wellington. The bill passed the Lords and became law.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet {{leadership}} viewed {{events in}} Poland with alarm. De-Stalinisation was underway in the Soviet Union as well, but the Soviet leadership did not view the democratic reform that the Polish public desired as an acceptable solution. In Moscow, the belief was that any liberalisation in one bloc country {{could lead to}} the destruction of communism and the ruin of Soviet influence in the region as a whole. The Soviet Union was not worried solely about the political implications of reform but about the economic implications as well. Economically, the Soviet Union heavily invested in much of the Eastern Bloc and was striving for integration of its economies. The Soviet Union had financed Polish industry and was Poland's main trading partner. The Soviet Union directed what products Poland manufactured; the Soviets bought the products and exported goods to Poland no longer produced within the country itself. Due to this integration, any reform, whether political or economic, in one of the countries would inevitably have a great impact on the other. Because Poland was inextricably connected to the Soviet Union economically, the thought of an independent Polish economy was unrealistic. The country had been forced to rely on the Soviets {{for such a long time}} that breaking away completely would prove disastrous. Thus, both countries held crucial power in different facets. Poland could threaten Soviet strength and power in Eastern Europe politically, and the Soviet Union could essentially destroy the Polish economy. Therefore, any reform in the Polish <b>government</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to concede to some Soviet demands, while the Soviets concurrently would have to concede to a vital partner.|$|E
5|$|Linx was {{established}} following an informal {{agreement between the}} ministers of transport in Norway, Sweden and Denmark to establish high-speed rail connection between the countries' capitals. Linx was the train operating part of the agreement, while the <b>governments</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to invest in better rail infrastructure to allow higher speeds.|$|R
25|$|Though the Charter itself {{came into}} effect on April 17, 1982, section 15 was not brought into force until April 17, 1985, in {{accordance}} with section 32(2) of the Charter. The reason for this was so that provincial and federal <b>governments</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> enough time to review their legislation and make the appropriate changes to any discriminatory laws.|$|R
50|$|The <b>government</b> <b>would</b> {{normally}} borrow extra {{funds on}} the money market by offering a higher interest rate. However, because of the limit it was unable to do so. Additionally, a large, visible <b>government</b> deficit <b>would</b> <b>have</b> attracted attention.|$|R
