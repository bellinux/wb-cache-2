40|$|Riser sleeve thermophysical {{properties}} for simulation are developed using an inverse modeling technique. Casting experiments using riser sleeves are performed {{in order to}} measure temperatures in the liquid steel, the <b>riser</b> <b>sleeve,</b> <b>and</b> the sand mold. Simulations are created and designed to replicate the casting experiments. Riser sleeve material thermophysical properties are iteratively modified until agreement is achieved between the simulation and the measured data. Analyses of sleeve material performance are carried out using the developed thermophysical properties. The modulus extension factor (MEF) is used to quantify <b>sleeve</b> performance <b>and</b> is determined for all riser sleeve materials studied here. Values are found to range from 1. 07 to 1. 27. A sleeve material 2 ̆ 7 s effects on casting yield are shown to depend only on the MEF <b>and</b> therefore a <b>sleeve</b> 2 ̆ 7 s exothermic or insulating properties serve only to increase the overall quality of the sleeve, expressed by the MEF, and do not independently affect the casting yield at any casting size studied here. The use of riser sleeves is shown to increase the maximum yield up to 40...|$|R

40|$|A phenomenological {{model of}} the gas bubble hold-up in slurry bubble columns is presented. The slurry moves upward {{in the core of}} the column and {{downward}} in the annulus, resembling the <b>riser</b> <b>and</b> downer of an air-lift loop reactor, respectively. The model virtually divides the column in a <b>riser</b> <b>and</b> a downer. The cross-sectional areas of the <b>riser</b> <b>and</b> the downer are experimentally found to be approximately equal. A macroscopic momentum balance over the <b>riser</b> <b>and</b> downer gives the liquid circulation velocity. The gas bubble hold-up is modeled for two size classes: small and large. In the homogeneous regime only small gas bubbles are present. Above the regime transition velocity the churn-turbulent regime exists, characterized by the presence of small and large gas bubbles. High speed video imaging shows that the gas flow up to the regime transition velocity generates small gas bubbles and that the gas flow in excess of the regime transition velocity generates large gas bubbles. Small gas bubbles are present in the <b>riser</b> <b>and</b> in the downer and have a constant slip velocity. The Wallis drift-flux model describes the small gas bubble hold-up in the <b>riser</b> <b>and</b> in the downer. Large gas bubbles are only present in the riser. The rise velocity of the large gas bubbles is the sum of the liquid velocity and the slip velocity according to the Davies-Taylor equation. The large gas bubble hold-up is obtained from the volume of gas flowing in large gas bubbles and the rise velocity of the large gas bubbles. For a given column diameter, column height, regime transition velocity, and physical properties of a gas-liquid system, the model predicts the total gas hold-up, the hold-up of the small and the large gas bubbles, and the average superficial liquid velocity in the <b>riser</b> <b>and</b> in the downer. Two parameters in the model are determined from experiments in a 29 -cm ID bubble column: the ratio of the small gas bubble hold-up in the downer to that in the <b>riser,</b> <b>and</b> the energy dissipation at {{the top and bottom of}} the column. The model describes the gas hold-up and liquid velocity data from literature with these parameter values within an error of 6 %. The model shows that there is no effect of scale on the gas hold-up for columns larger than 15 cm in diameter...|$|R

5000|$|A {{commonly}} used configuration is the catenary anchor leg mooring (CALM), {{which can be}} capable of handling very large crude carriers. This configuration uses six or eight heavy anchor chains placed radially around the buoy, of a size to suit the designed load, each about 350 m long, and attached to an anchor or pile to provide the required holding power. The anchor chains are pre-tensioned {{to ensure that the}} buoy is held in position above the PLEM. As the load from the tanker is applied, the heavy chains on the far side straighten and lift off the seabed to apply the balancing load. Under full design load there is still some 27 m of chain lying on the bottom. The flexible <b>hose</b> <b>riser</b> may be in one of three basic configurations, all designed to accommodate tidal depth variation and lateral displacement due to mooring loads. In all cases the hose curvature changes to accommodate lateral and vertical movement of the buoy, and the hoses are supported at near neutral buoyancy by floats along the length. These are: ...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Current space suits {{have limited}} {{movement}} due to gas pressurization during {{exposure to the}} vacuum of space. Alternatively, if pressure is applied by an elastic garment vs. pneumatic garment to produce mechanical counter pressure (MCP), several advantages are possible. In this study, we investigate local microcirculatory and other effects produced with and without a prototype MCP glove <b>and</b> <b>sleeve</b> during exposure to varying levels of vacuum. METHODS: The entire arms of eight male volunteers were studied at normal ambient pressure and during 5 min exposures to - 50, - 100, and - 150 mm Hg with and without the MCP glove <b>and</b> <b>sleeve.</b> Pressure distribution, skin microvascular flow, and temperature were measured. RESULTS: The MCP glove <b>and</b> <b>sleeve</b> generated over 200 mm Hg on the middle finger, dorsum of the hand, and the wrist. However, pressure was significantly lower on the forearm and the upper arm. Without the glove <b>and</b> <b>sleeve,</b> only two of eight subjects tolerated - 100 mm Hg. Also, no subject tolerated - 150 mm Hg. However, subjects tolerated all vacuum pressures wearing the glove <b>and</b> <b>sleeve.</b> Skin microvascular flow and temperature remained within control values with the glove <b>and</b> <b>sleeve</b> at a chamber pressure of - 150 mm Hg. DISCUSSION: The MCP glove <b>and</b> <b>sleeve</b> counteracts adverse effects of vacuum exposures due to lower pressure differentials. Pressure levels over the hand and wrist {{are similar to those}} of the current U. S. space suit glove <b>and</b> <b>sleeve,</b> but additional development is required to increase MCP over the forearm and upper arm...|$|R
