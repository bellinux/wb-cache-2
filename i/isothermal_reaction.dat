50|$|Multiple {{displacement}} amplification (MDA) is {{a widely}} used technique, enabling amplifying femtograms of DNA from bacterium to micrograms {{for the use of}} sequencing. Reagents required for MDA reactions include: random primers and DNA polymerase from bacteriophage phi29. In 30 degree <b>isothermal</b> <b>reaction,</b> DNA is amplified with included reagents. As the polymerases manufacture new strands, a strand displacement reaction takes place, synthesizing multiple copies from each template DNA. At the same time, the strands that were extended antecedently will be displaced. MDA products result in a length of about 12 kb and ranges up to around 100 kb, enabling its use in DNA sequencing. Other method includes MALBAC.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we asked}} if it is {{possible}} to identify the best primers and reaction conditions based on improvements in reaction speed when optimizing <b>isothermal</b> <b>reactions.</b> We used digital single-molecule, real-time analyses of both speed and efficiency of <b>isothermal</b> amplification <b>reactions,</b> which revealed that improvements in the speed of <b>isothermal</b> amplification <b>reactions</b> did not always correlate with improvements in digital efficiency (the fraction of molecules that amplify) or with analytical sensitivity. However, we observed that the speeds of amplification for single-molecule (in a digital device) and multi-molecule (e. g. in a PCR well plate) formats always correlated for the same conditions. Also, digital efficiency correlated with the analytical sensitivity of the same reaction performed in a multi-molecule format. Our finding was supported experimentally with examples of primer design, the use or exclusion of loop primers in different combinations, and the use of different enzyme mixtures in one-step reverse-transcription loop-mediated amplification (RT-LAMP). Our results show that measuring the digital efficiency of amplification of single-template molecules allows quick, reliable comparisons of the analytical sensitivity of reactions under any two tested conditions, independent of the speeds of the <b>isothermal</b> amplification <b>reactions...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} acidic {{treatments}} on N 2 O reduction over Ni catalysts supported on activated carbon was systematically studied. The catalysts {{were characterized by}} N- 2 adsorption, mass titration, temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), and X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS). It is found that surface chemistry {{plays an important role}} in N 2 O-carbon reaction catalyzed by Ni catalyst. HNO 3 treatment produces more active acidic surface groups such as carboxyl and lactone, resulting in a more uniform catalyst dispersion and higher catalytic activity. However, HCl treatment decreases active acidic groups and increases the inactive groups, playing an opposite role in the catalyst dispersion and catalytic activity. A thorough discussion of the mechanism of the N 2 O catalytic reduction is made based upon results from <b>isothermal</b> <b>reactions,</b> temperature-programmed reactions (TPR) and characterization of catalysts.

Some concrete and definable examples of chaos can be seen in oscillating chemical reactions. One example is the Belousov-Zhabotinskii reaction in chemistry. By changing the rate at which reactants are fed into the system, the oscillations can change from periodic behavior to chaotic. The chemistry of the BZ reaction is rather complex, and involves the oxidation of easily brominated organic material by bromate ion in an acidic environment, which makes it rather difficult to model ([2],[3],[4]). Slightly simpler is a similar reaction involving a three-variable autocatalator [5].

40|$|Polymerase chain {{reaction}} {{is the most}} widely used method for in vitro DNA amplification. However, it requires thermocycling to separate two DNA strands. In vivo, DNA is replicated by DNA polymerases with various accessory proteins, including a DNA helicase that acts to separate duplex DNA. We have devised a new in vitro isothermal DNA amplification method by mimicking this in vivo mechanism. Helicase-dependent amplification (HDA) utilizes a DNA helicase to generate single-stranded templates for primer hybridization and subsequent primer extension by a DNA polymerase. HDA does not require thermocycling. In addition, it offers several advantages over other isothermal DNA amplification methods by having a simple reaction scheme and being a true <b>isothermal</b> <b>reaction</b> that can be performed at one temperature for the entire process.

40|$|In our {{previous}} paper, we described a {{method by which}} a state machine is implemented by a single-stranded DNA molecule whose 3 %-end sequence encodes {{the current state of}} the machine.

In this paper, we first show that combined with parallel overlap assembly, a single series of successive transitions can solve NP-complete problems. This means that the number of necessary laboratory steps is independent from the problem size. We then report the results of two experiments concerning the implementation of our method.

The exponential version of the reaction is a molecular chain reaction that uses the oligonucleotide products of each linear reaction to create producers of more of the same oligonucleotide. It is a highly sensitive chain reaction that can be specifically triggered by given DNA sequences and can achieve amplifications of > 106 -fold. Several similar reactions in this class are described here.

40|$|DNA polymerases play a {{fundamental}} {{role in the}} transmission and maintenance of genetic information and have become an important in vitro diagnostic and analytical tool. The Loop-mediated isothermal DNA amplification (LAMP) method has major applications for disease and pathogen detection and utilises the unique strand-displacement activity {{of a small group of}} thermostable DNA polymerases. The Large (Klenow-like) Fragment of Geobacillus stearothermophilus DNA polymerase I (B. st LF Pol I) currently serves as the enzyme of choice for the majority of these <b>isothermal</b> <b>reactions,</b> with few alternatives commercially available. An increasing need for point-of-care nucleic acid diagnostics is now shifting detection methods away from traditional laboratory based chemistries, such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in favour of faster, and often simpler, isothermal methods. It was recognised that in order to facilitate these rapid <b>isothermal</b> <b>reactions</b> there was a requirement for alternative thermostable, strand-displacing DNA polymerases and this was the basis of this thesis. This thesis reports the successful identification of polymerases from Family A, chosen for their inherent strand-displacement activity, which is essential for the removal of RNA primers of Okazaki fragments during lagging-strand DNA synthesis in vivo. Twelve thermophilic organisms, with growth temperature ranges between 50 oC and 80 oC, were identified and the genomic DNA extracted. Where DNA sequences were unavailable, a gene-walking technique revealed the polA sequences, enabling the Large Fragment Pol I to be cloned and the recombinant protein over-expressed in Escherichia coli. A three-stage column chromatography purification permitted the characterisation of ten newly identified Pol I enzymes suitable for use in LAMP. Thermodesulfatator indicus (T. in) Pol I proved to be the most interesting enzyme isolated. Demonstrating strong strand-displacement activity and thermostability to 98 oC, T. in Pol I is uniquely suitable to a newly termed heat-denaturing LAMP (HD-LAMP) reaction offering many potential advantages over the existing LAMP protocol. The current understanding of strand-displacement activity of Pol I is poorly understood. This thesis recognised the need to identify the exact regions and motifs responsible for this activity of the enzyme, enabling potential enhancements to be made. Enzyme engineering using site-directed mutagenesis and the formation of chimeras confirmed the importance of specific subdomains in strand-separation activity. With this knowledge, a unique Thermus aquaticus (T. aq) Pol I mutant demonstrated sufficient strand-displacement activity to permit its use in LAMP for the first time. The fusion of Cren 7, a double-stranded DNA binding protein, to Pol I for use in LAMP is also reported. Although the fusion construct was found to reduce amplification speed, enhancements were observed in the presence of increased salt concentrations and it is suggested here as a means for future enzyme development...|$|R
