5|$|Known {{initially}} as a <b>kindly</b> physician, Doc Ames led {{the city}} into corruption during four terms as mayor just before 1900. The gangster Kid Cann {{was famous for}} bribery and intimidation during the 1930s and 1940s. The city made dramatic changes to rectify discrimination as early as 1886 when Martha Ripley founded Maternity Hospital for both married and unmarried mothers.|$|E

5|$|My {{object in}} {{writing to you}} at present is merely to draw your {{attention}} to the subject, and to suggest a friendly conference {{to discuss the matter}} more fully. I would take it as a favour if you would <b>kindly</b> think the matter over, and make whatever suggestions you deem necessary.|$|E

She is her son's emotional support after Clark is devastated by Jonathan's death. Thaxter was producer Ilya Salkind's mother-in-law.|$|E

However, she had wasted away and died. Zampanò gets drunk and wanders to the beach, where he breaks down in tears.|$|E

5|$|The entire {{theme for}} the film celebrates the {{relationship}} between a small girl named Emily (voiced by Emily Osborne), and her <b>kindly</b> but ailing grandfather (voiced by Peter Ustinov). Emily's playful innocence is contrasted with Granpa's increasing frailty. Aware that he will not be around for much longer, he shares his memories of adventures and days gone by.|$|E
5|$|The twins, Tristan and Orlando – Mysterious twin {{children}} {{who live with}} the Moreaus, but are most likely the offspring of the incestuous relationship between Aue and his sister. The epic poem Orlando Furioso is marked by the themes of love and madness, while the legend of Tristan and Iseult {{tells the story of}} an impossible love, two themes that can be found in The <b>Kindly</b> Ones.|$|E
5|$|As of 2014, {{the well}} {{can still be}} seen locked inside a red-brick {{enclosure}} with a steel gate, and its geothermal heat can be felt outside the building. Some plastic chairs, pails and mini-tubs <b>kindly</b> donated by visitors are stored at {{the perimeter of the}} compound, which has a makeshift shed in one corner. A caretaker, paid by Mindef, takes care of the place to ensure its overall cleanliness, but there is no toilet on location. The hot spring is less frequented nowadays but remains rustic for rural and suburban families to discover and explore.|$|E

5|$|Blois died on 10 May 1206, and {{was buried}} in Lincoln Cathedral. In the early fourteenth century, he was still remembered well by the cathedral chapter and was {{described}} as learned and <b>kindly</b> by the 14th century writer John Schalby, who wrote a work {{on the lives of}} the bishops of Lincoln. Besides his kinsman William de Blois, another known relative was a nephew, William de Marum. Marum succeeded his uncle as rector in Durham. He was once identified with another William of Blois, who was a poet and the brother of Peter of Blois, but there is no evidence supports that identification.|$|E
5|$|Chaucer's Criseyde is {{swayed by}} Diomedes playing on her fear. Pandarus is now her uncle, more worldly-wise and {{more active in}} what happens and so Troilus is more passive. This {{passivity}} is given comic treatment when Troilus passes out in Criseyde's bedroom and is lifted into her bed by Pandarus. Troilus' repeated emotional paralysis is {{comparable to that of}} Hamlet who may have been based on him. It can be seen as driven by loyalty both to Criseyde and to his homeland, but has also been interpreted less <b>kindly.</b>|$|E
5|$|Children {{survived the}} Jastrebarsko and Donja Reka camps only because {{concerned}} individuals from Zagreb, Jastrebarsko, and surrounding villages offered humanitarian aid. Among {{those who worked}} to alleviate children's suffering were Marinić, Budisavljević, and Davila. One survivor, Milan Vujić, {{was taken from the}} camp when he was sick and cared for {{until the end of the}} war by a Croatian family in Koprivnica. They had never accepted the Ustaše regime or its policies. Many Croats, he stated, took in and even adopted children from Jastrebarsko and treated them <b>kindly.</b>|$|E

5|$|Her friendships {{were limited}} to her ladies-in-waiting, and in {{particular}} Dona Josefina da Fonseca Costa. She was well liked by her attendants, a good judge {{of the character of}} visitors and courtiers, unpretentious, generous, <b>kindly</b> and an affectionate mother and grandmother. She dressed and acted modestly, only wearing jewelry for occasions of state, and gave the impression of being somewhat sad. She had no interest in politics and occupied her time writing letters, reading, doing needlework, and attending to religious obligations and charitable projects. She possessed a beautiful voice, and often practiced her singing skills. Her appreciation for music also meant that she enjoyed opera and balls.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Littell {{thought that}} his book would sell around {{three to five}} {{thousand}} copies. Éditions Gallimard, his publishing house, was more optimistic and decided to print 12,000 copies. Word of mouth and the enthusiastic reviews soon catapulted sales {{to such an extent}} that Gallimard had to stop publishing the latest Harry Potter novel in order to meet the demand for The <b>Kindly</b> Ones, which ended up selling more than 700,000 copies in France by the end of 2007. Littell was finally given French citizenship.|$|E
5|$|It is {{wonderful}} {{that both of}} these things occurred under Valerian; {{and it is the}} more remarkable in this case when we consider his previous conduct, for he had been mild and friendly toward the men of God, for none of the emperors before him had treated them so <b>kindly</b> and favorably; and not even those who were said openly to be Christians received them with such manifest hospitality and friendliness as he did {{at the beginning of his}} reign. For his entire house was filled with pious persons and was a church of God.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{with the}} <b>kindliest</b> {{feelings}} towards us, I am afraid," [...] remarked the Prince, {{holding out his}} hand. [...] "I hope, however, {{that you will not}} judge us, as a nation, too severely." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "All right, I {{believe you}} are honest," [...] {{answered}} Dick, in a <b>kindlier</b> tone. [...] "But those men are rascals, {{and we want to}} catch them. They carried those two girls off against their will." ...|$|R
5|$|Mrs. Mary Patterson, of Swampscott, {{fell upon}} the ice near {{the corner of}} Market and Oxford streets, on Thursday evening, and was {{severely}} injured. She was taken up in an insensible condition and carried into the residence of S. M. Bubier, Esq., near by, where she was <b>kindly</b> cared for during the night. Dr. Cushing, who was called, found her injuries to be internal, and of a severe nature, inducing spasms and internal suffering. She was removed to her home in Swampscott yesterday afternoon, though in a very critical condition.|$|E
5|$|Scott Gorman (William Hope) is {{commanding}} officer of the mission to LV-426, and the Colonial Marines do not take <b>kindly</b> to the inexperienced lieutenant. Although he performs adequately when they initially secure the empty colony, he quickly loses {{control of the situation}} when the Aliens ambush his troops. Ripley takes over, driving the command vehicle, and Gorman is knocked unconscious. When he comes to, he transfers command of the colony's defense to Hicks. During the Aliens' assault on the operations room, Gorman tries to rescue Vasquez but his pistol runs out of ammunition. Realizing they are trapped, they embrace and detonate a grenade (taking a number of Aliens with them).|$|E
5|$|Soedrajat abuses {{his high}} social status {{in order to}} womanise and becomes his rich uncle's heir despite the latter having a son, the <b>kindly</b> and noble Soelarsa. The uncle is {{disappointed}} with Soelarsa and considers Soedrajat the better man. Being considered high class, he is unwilling to associate with people of the lower classes. Ultimately Soedrajat falls for a beautiful young woman, Koestijah. Meanwhile, Soelarsa saves Koestijah's life while driving a truck through her village; the two fall in love at first sight. By manipulating Koestijah's father, Soedrajat arranges for her to marry him.|$|E

6000|$|... "I can't do that," [...] replied Cavanagh; but {{his tone}} was <b>kindlier,</b> for he {{perceived}} that the old fellow was thin, hollow-chested, and poorly clad. [...] "You knew you were breaking the laws, didn't you?" ...|$|R
