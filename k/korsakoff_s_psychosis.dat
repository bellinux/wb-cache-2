The responses of thyroid stimulating hormone, prolactin, follicle stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone to a combined thyrotropin releasing hormone and gonadolibenn stimulation test did not differ significantly. For the dexamethasone suppression test, the Korsakoff patients had significantly higher basal serum cortisol and 08 : 00 hr post-dexamethasone cortisol levels than non-alcoholic controls. These findings raise the possibility that chronically elevated cortisol levels may contribute to cognitive impairment in alcoholic <b>Korsakoff</b> <b>s</b> syndrome. &apos...|$|R
40|$|Short-term {{memory was}} {{assessed}} in {{two groups of}} amnesic patients. Six patients had confirmed or suspected damage to the hippocampal formation, and six patients had diencephalic damage {{as a result of}} alcoholic Korsakoff's syndrome. Verbal short-term memory was evaluated with seven separate administrations of the standard digit span test in order to obtain a precise measure of short-term memory. Nonverbal short-term memory was evaluated with four tests that assessed apprehension, retention, and the ability to manipulate nonverbal material-all within the span of immediate memory. One of these four tests assessed short-term memory for spatial location. Patients with damage to the hippocampal formation had a digit span equivalent to that of control subjects and also performed normally on the four tests of nonverbal short-term memory. The patients with <b>Korsakoff</b> <b>s</b> syndrome had a marginally low digit span and performed poorly on three of the four nonverbal tasks, a finding consistent with the deficits in attention and visuospatial processing previously described for this patient group. These deficits are likely due to the frontal lobe atrophy typically associated with <b>Korsakoff</b> <b>s</b> syndrome, rather than to diencephalic damage. The results support the view that short-term (immediate) memory, including short-term spatial memory, is independent of the hippocampus. Key words: amnesia, short-term memory, diencephalon, hippocampus, spatial Bilateral damage to the hippocampus and related structures or damage to the medial diencephalon causes severe memor...|$|R
40|$|Outcome {{in terms}} of {{progression}} to Korsakoff 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>psychosis</b> {{is known to be}} unlikely when the preceding thiamin deficiency syndrome, Wernicke 2 ̆ 7 s encephalopathy, does not follow heavy alcohol use. There is evidence that alcohol potentiates thiamin-related brain damage. It is argued here that in heavy drinkers, if vomiting precedes the onset of the encephalopathy, then the latter might develop at a time when tissue alcohol levels are close to zero. Any progression to Korsakoff 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>psychosis</b> could then be associated with less or even no impairment. This outcome would not be expected if ingestion of alcohol continued during the vomiting stage. In a follow-up study of 61 cases of alcoholic Wernicke 2 ̆ 7 s encephalopathy, these concepts are given some support by the results obtained...|$|R
40|$|Whether {{frontal lobe}} {{pathology}} {{can account for}} some of the cognitive impairment observed in amnesic patients with KorsakofTs syndrome was investigated. Various cognitive and memory tests were given to patients with circumscribed frontal lobe lesions, patients with KorsakofTs syndrome, non-Korsakoff amnesic patients, and control Ss. Patients with frontal lobe lesions were not amnesic. Nevertheless, they exhibited 2 deficits that were also exhibited by patients with KorsakofTs syndrome but not by other amnesic patients: (a) impairment on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and (b) impairment on the Initiation and Perseveration subscale of the Dementia Rating Scale. Thus, frontal lobe pathology can explain some of the cognitive deficits observed in patients with <b>Korsakoff</b> <b>s</b> syndrome. Amnesia is characterized by a severe deficit in the ability to learn new facts and events (i. e., anterograde amnesia) in the context of relatively preserved intellectual functions (fo...|$|R
40|$|Rats {{were tested}} on an allocentric-spatial working-memory task—delayed matching-to-place (DMTP) {{in a water}} maze—before and after either pyri{{thiamine}}-induced thiamine deficiency (PTD) or electrolytic lesions of the lateral internal medullary laminae (IML), an area damaged by PTD. DMTP trials consisted of paired swims, with the escape platform in a new location on each trial. PTD rats were impaired at retention delays of 300 s, but not at delays of 4 or 60 s. Rats with IML lesions performed normally at all delays. Both groups displayed normal retention of object-discrimination problems that they had learned at different intervals before treatment (5 weeks, 3 weeks, and 1 week). The results suggest that PTD causes delay-dependent deficits of allocentric spatial working memory and that damage outside the IML is probably responsible. Neither PTD-induced diencephalic damage nor restricted IML lesions appear to produce a global retrograde amnesia. Thiamine deficiency is the primary etiological factor in <b>Korsakoff</b> <b>s</b> disease, an amnesic syndrome associated with damage to midline diencephalic structures (Victor, Adams, & Collins, 1971). In rats, daily administration of the thiamine antagonist pyrithiamine produces diencephalic lesions and learning and memory deficits. Accordingly, pyrithiamine-induced thiamine deficiency (PTD) in rats is used to model the etiology, diencephalic neuropathology, and memory deficits of Korsakoff's amnesia. Rats recovered from PTD are impaired on tests of spatial memory, including delayed alternation (Mair, Anderson, Langlais, & McEntee, 1985), spatial matching- and non...|$|R
40|$|Korsakoff {{patients}} are generally {{agreed to be}} impaired in conscious recollection, but whether their implicit memory performance is also affected is less certain. A deficit in novelty dependent encoding (i. e., elaboration learning) could account for both types of impairments and predicts a reduced implicit word frequency effect in the patients. This effect was examined with word stem completion in nineteen Korsakoff patients (mean age 52. 7 yrs) and nineteen healthy controls (mean age 56. 8 yrs). The word frequency effect was larger in controls than in patients in absolute terms, but not reliably so. It is concluded that elaboration learning may be spared to some degree in Korsakoff amnesia, but, {{in line with the}} original reasoning by <b>S.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Korsakoff</b> (1889 / 1996), it may only be engaged by the patients when they are continuously prompted to do so.

40|$|A {{model of}} {{psychosis}} and schizophrenia, {{based primarily on}} symbolic interaction theory, is developed. Dialogic consciousness is defined as internalized communicative process, and certain constructs such as mind, self, and identity are defined as derivations of this process. Reality is defined as an intersubjectively constituted product of internalized social process. The development of dialogic consciousness is then discussed, and certain problematic processes in the developmental sequence delineated. Prelinguistic and linguistic experience are discussed, allowing a view of unconscious interactive phenomena to be addressed. Psychosis is then defined as the disintegration of dialogic consciousness {{and the emergence of}} non-dialogically organized interactive phenomena into consciousness. Schizophrenia is defined as a particular way of constructing one 2 ̆ 7 s reality that both increases the person 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> vulnerability to <b>psychosis</b> and determines the content of what non-dialogically organized phenomena emerge in psychosis. The schizophrenic drama is viewed primarily as a struggle to remain related to social process in some way that protects the person from psychological destruction within that social process. The model is then grounded in five case histories. Some basic implications of the model for how psychosis and schizophrenia must be addressed by the scientist/therapist are then discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s {{disease is}} a {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disease involving the basal ganglia affecting dopamine-secreting nigrostriatal pathway. It is diagnosed clinically {{by the presence of}} any combination of: Bradykinesia, Resting Tremor, Rigidity, Gait instability. Psychosis occurs in 20 to 40 percent of drug-treated patients with PD, and visual hallucinations are the most common psychotic symptom. Parkinsonian Psychosis treatment (with neuroleptics/antipsychotics blocking Dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway) had been a clinical challenge because it risks exacerbation of motor symptomatology. On 4 / 29 / 16, FDA approved Pimavanserin, a 5 HT- 2 A inverse agonist, a novel antipsychotic, that addresses psychosis independently of the Dopamine pathways after successful completion of a phase 3 placebo-controlled trial. We report a case of Parkinsonian psychosis which responded well to Pimavanserin. Case Report 72 year old Caucasian female with a history of Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s; motor symptoms previously stable on Carbidopa-Levodopa (Sinemet) but developing visual hallucinations secondary to Sinemet and consequently being weaned off of it by outpatient neurologist in anticipation of being initiated on Pimavanserin. Admitted for acute agitation, mild paranoia and worsening visual hallucinations (VH) with dementia ongoing for the past year. During her inpatient stay, she was completely weaned off of Sinemet and was started on Pimavanserin 17 mg bid (well-tolerated). Target psychosis symptoms (paranoia and visual hallucinations) resolved secondary to 3 days of Pimavanserin at starting dose and motor symptoms did not deteriorate after 3 days of not being on any Sinemet and she was discharged. Discussion Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> Disease <b>psychosis</b> is the strongest predictor of nursing home placement as well as mortality. The psychosis is hypothesized to represent an imbalance between the dopamine and serotonin systems. Treatment in the past was more difficult secondary to limited pharmacological options. interestingly, Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease was treated primarily with dopaminergic agents to reduce motor symptoms but these agents often worsened the psychosis. Similarly, Psychosis was treated primarily with antipsychotic agents, which in turn, worsened the motor symptoms. Pimavanserin, a selective serotonin 5 HT 2 A inverse agonist, has potent actions on 5 HT 2 A without any dopaminergic activity/affinity. Conclusion: Due to these actions, Pimavanserin was able to significantly reduce psychotic symptoms in patients with moderate to severe Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease, achieve efficacy without worsening motor symptoms, achieve efficacy without significant safety concerns in our patient. Our patient tolerated this medication well, showed clinically meaningful improvement in psychotic symptoms, and reduced the caregiver burden on his family...|$|R
40|$|The {{study reveals}} the rhetorical goals and {{strategies}} of O 2 ̆ 7 Connor and Lacan to be startling similar, despite their disparate cultures (French and American-Southern) and seemingly incompatible critical classifications (2 ̆ 2 post-structuralist theorist 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 religious fiction writer 2 ̆ 2). Both writers, each with an unknowable but nevertheless sensible 2 ̆ 2 mystery 2 ̆ 2 (God or the unconscious, respectively), sought to undermine their contemporaries 2 ̆ 7 obsession with ego-mastery and logocentrism. By resisting their audiences 2 ̆ 7 meaning-making tendencies, the rhetorics of O 2 ̆ 7 Connor and Lacan decenter readers from their egos and objectify them to 2 ̆ 2 mystery. 2 ̆ 2 Through {{the art of}} detournement, both writers circulate key symbols and signifiers throughout their texts. As these elements are displaced from context to context, they accumulate significance, thus sabotaging readers 2 ̆ 7 cognitive control (i. e., containment in any one meaning). ^ The study is articulated in the manner proposed by Shoshana Felman in Literature and Psychoanalysis: The Question of Reading: Otherwise. Rather than applying psychoanalysis to literature (i. e., Lacanian theory to O 2 ̆ 7 Connor 2 ̆ 7 s fiction), literature and psychoanalysis are placed on the same discursive level, as texts with equal potential for reciprocal implication. From {{the point of view}} of a reader who is familiar with both authors, the dissertation explores not only what Lacanian theory has to say about O 2 ̆ 7 Connor 2 ̆ 7 s text, but also what a rhetorical analysis of O 2 ̆ 7 Connor 2 ̆ 7 s fiction implies about Lacanian theory. ^ Lacan 2 ̆ 7 s Seminar on the Psychoses illuminates the 2 ̆ 2 psychotic 2 ̆ 2 structures in O 2 ̆ 7 Connor 2 ̆ 7 s portrayal of characters 2 ̆ 7 mindsets or ways of seeing. These radically fragmented and hallucinatory perceptions, in addition to disorders at the level of characters 2 ̆ 7 language, symptomize the dismantling of characters 2 ̆ 7 egos (and, ideally, effect the ego-disassembly of O 2 ̆ 7 Connor 2 ̆ 7 s readers) and mark their humbling preparation for grace. Just as Lacanian theory points to the implications that O 2 ̆ 7 Connor 2 ̆ 7 s (2 ̆ 2 psychotic 2 ̆ 2) art of distortion might have for her religious intentions, so does O 2 ̆ 7 Connor 2 ̆ 7 s fiction (and its divergence from Lacan 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> paradigm of <b>psychosis)</b> prove to be a valuable resource [...] not only for revising Lacan 2 ̆ 7 s thinking, but also for uncovering the absolutist attitudes informing his theoretical motivations. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The 2 ̆ 2 Defective 2 ̆ 2 Generation: Disability in Modernist Literature aims {{to provide}} an {{analysis}} of how Anglo-American authors {{in the early twentieth}} century conceived of, utilized, and portrayed disability in their fiction. Building on the existing scholarship in the field of Disability Studies, I argue that modernists revise the tradition of representation to make disabilities a generational trait rather than a sign of individual deviance. In novel after novel, multiple characters exhibit some form of illness or impairment, which appears as both cause and effect of the instabilities and traumas of modernity. Like many of their predecessors, then, these authors portray diverse health conditions as 2 ̆ 2 defects 2 ̆ 2 rather than natural variations in the human body, and most draw little distinction between the types of 2 ̆ 2 disorders 2 ̆ 2 they represent. This perspective, however, becomes particularly destructive in the era leading up to the Holocaust, when eugenical attitudes would lead to the murder or sterilization of over a million people with disabilities. Modernists also continue to exploit disability 2 ̆ 7 s potential for metaphor and sometimes evoke traditional stereotypes. Unlike traditional representations, however, these works do not resolve what the authors perceive as the 2 ̆ 2 problem 2 ̆ 2 of disability by curing or eliminating it; instead, they portray characters struggling to lead fulfilling lives despite feeling limited by their health. Working against the public 2 ̆ 7 s conception of disability as solely a medical condition, many of these authors further depict the social forces that turn a perceived 2 ̆ 2 difference 2 ̆ 2 into a 2 ̆ 2 disability. 2 ̆ 2 The project is arranged into four chapters. In the first, 2 ̆ 2 Idiots and Other Degenerates: Disability at the Dawn of Modernism, 2 ̆ 2 I use Joseph Conrad 2 ̆ 7 s novel The Secret Agent to illustrate how disability becomes characteristic of a generation, primarily through the influence of degeneration theory. Mocking the popular conception of a society divided into the 2 ̆ 2 fit 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 unfit, 2 ̆ 2 Conrad creates a circle of characters who judge others to be degenerate while ignoring their own similar traits. From that beginning, I move in chapter 2, 2 ̆ 2 Modernist Style: The Inward Turn and Portrayals of Mental Illness, 2 ̆ 2 to an analysis of the effects of stylistic experimentation on depictions of disability in both Virginia Woolf 2 ̆ 7 s Mrs. Dalloway and F. Scott Fitzgerald 2 ̆ 7 s Tender is the Night. The authors 2 ̆ 7 use of multiple points of view in these works leads to a representation of both an individual 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> experience of <b>psychosis</b> and the stigma that can accompany such illness, and, like Conrad, both writers elide the differences between the seemingly able-bodied characters and those they deem disabled. These authors also offer a contrast in perceptions. Whereas Woolf treats shell shock and emotional instability largely as the unavoidable effects of World War I, Fitzgerald links both schizophrenia and alcoholism to decadent behavior, thus aligning himself with the public 2 ̆ 7 s perception of illness as a matter of intent. Moving from style to theme, in chapter 3, 2 ̆ 2 Impaired Relationships: Physical Injury and the Pursuit of Romance, 2 ̆ 2 I explore the ways in which authors depict physical impairments as obstacles to personal relationships. Through a comparison of Ernest Hemingway 2 ̆ 7 s The Sun Also Rises and the 2 ̆ 2 Nausicaa 2 ̆ 2 chapter of James Joyce 2 ̆ 7 s Ulysses, I discuss the intersection of gender identity, disability, and romance. I argue against the critical consensus that Jake Barnes feels emasculated by his injury and that Gerty MacDowell is 2 ̆ 2 doomed 2 ̆ 2 to spinsterhood because she limps, contending that both authors allow their characters to maintain a sense of masculinity or femininity consistent with the hegemonic ideals of their time. While Hemingway presents Jake 2 ̆ 7 s wound as a physical disability that prevents his having the relationship he desires, Joyce uses Gerty 2 ̆ 7 s limp to mark her as an imperfect beauty in preference to an array of idealized iconic images, and in her encounter with Leopold Bloom grants her the sexual attention that she desires. In my final chapter, 2 ̆ 2 African American Modernism and a Deadly Game of Blind Man 2 ̆ 7 s Buff, 2 ̆ 2 I shift focus from mainstream to African American modernism with an analysis of Richard Wright 2 ̆ 7 s Native Son,, addressing the author 2 ̆ 7 s use of folklore in relation to the metaphor of blindness. Posing the literally blind Mrs. Dalton as a revenant of the American colonists who ignored the humanity of those they enslaved and as a symbol of continuing oppression, Wright develops Bigger Thomas as both a trickster who exploits the 2 ̆ 2 blindness 2 ̆ 2 of others and a badman who rebels against it. My conclusion then addresses the use of disability metaphors, the attitudes those metaphors expose, and the authors 2 ̆ 7 apparent agreement with or challenges to contemporary perceptions of disability. Although critics have previously analyzed specific works or certain aspects of disability representations during this era, this project seeks a more comprehensive discussion of disability in modernist fiction than currently exists. My hope is that it will enhance our understanding of both the period 2 ̆ 7 s literature and the harmful attitudes that existed at the time, which the work of Disability Studies has endeavored to overturn...|$|R
