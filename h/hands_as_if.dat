25|$|Truck drivers {{also use}} {{flashing}} headlights to warn drivers in the oncoming lane(s) {{of a police}} patrol down the road. Though not official, two consecutive flashes indicate a police patrol, whereas a rapid series of flashing indicates DMV or other law-enforcement agency that only controls truck drivers. During the day time, the latter is sometimes accompanied by the signaling driver making a circle with both <b>hands</b> (<b>as</b> <b>if</b> holding a tachograph ring).|$|E
2500|$|Aseity—That [...] "God is so {{independent}} that he {{does not}} need us." [...] It is based on Acts 17:25, where it says that God [...] "is not served by human <b>hands,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he needed anything" [...] (NIV). This is often related to God's self-existence and his self-sufficiency.|$|E
2500|$|Part of {{the problem}} {{might have been the}} sheer size of Rubinstein's hands. They were huge, and many {{observers}} commented on them. Josef Hofmann observed that Rubinstein's fifth finger [...] "was as thick as my thumb—think of it! [...] Then his fingers were square at the ends, with cushions on them. [...] It was a wonderful hand." [...] Pianist Josef Lhevinne described them as [...] "fat, pudgy ... with fingers so broad at the finger-tips that he often had difficulty in not striking two notes at once." [...] The German piano teacher Ludwig Deppe advised American pianist Amy Fay to watch carefully how Rubinstein struck his chords: [...] "Nothing cramped about him! [...] He spreads his <b>hands</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he were going to take in the universe, and takes them up with the greatest freedom and abandon!" ...|$|E

2500|$|At the town's public house, Plog—jealous and wounded—is {{looking for}} Lisa. Both Jof and the {{manipulative}} Raval are also present: {{for the sake}} of mischief, Raval tells Plog that Jof knows what Lisa is doing. Raval manipulates Plog and the other customers into intimidating Jof, and forces Jof to dance on the tables like a bear. The bullying is broken up by the appearance of Jöns, who once again recognises Raval: true to his word, he slashes and permanently scars the theologian's face. Both knight and squire are reacquainted with Jof's family, with a repentant Plog also joining them. The knight enjoys a country picnic of milk and wild strawberries gathered by Mia. The knight says: [...] "I'll carry this memory between my <b>hands</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were a bowl filled to the brim with fresh milk...And it will be an adequate sign—it will be enough for me." ...|$|E

60|$|By-and-by {{they reached}} {{a man who was}} {{grinding}} stones to powder in his <b>hands,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they had been nuts.|$|E
60|$|He {{threw up}} his <b>hands</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> despairing of ability to express what he thought and felt, then essayed a further attempt.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, dad!" [...] gasped Phemie, frantically {{clasping}} {{her knees}} with both <b>hands</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> to perfectly assure herself of this good fortune.|$|E
60|$|Stillwell {{paused in}} the rapid {{delivery}} of his narrative; he still retained Madeline's <b>hand,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> by that he might comfort her.|$|R
6000|$|She {{patted his}} <b>hand</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{soothing}} a child, and, turning, mounted the stairway. How weak and old he seemed at the moment! ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was leaning}} forward over the ledge, {{rattling}} a programme in his <b>hand,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> trying to attract attention. Then he made signals.|$|R
