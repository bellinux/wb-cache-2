40|$|Quadrupole mass {{spectrometry}} with electron ionization (EI-QMS) {{is a very}} popular detection technique in combination with gas chromatography. It is deployed {{for the analysis of}} volatile and semivolatile analytes in many industry domains. Although a very important factor for quantitative analysis, {{little is known about the}} stability of ion source performance. Only a few papers and patents report possible signal instabilities due to sample adsorption, degradation, or insulating deposits on the hot stainless steel surface of the ion source. In this study, a conventional stainless steel ion source was used to investigate possible signal drifts. It was observed that the EI-QMS instrument indeed suffered from continuous signal instability. It was found that the key parts which are responsible for the signal instabilities are those that regulate the ion beam toward the mass analyzer: the repeller, <b>exit</b> <b>plate,</b> and focusing lenses. The voltage of the repeller was found to have a major influence on the signal stability. The surface of the repeller, <b>exit</b> <b>plate,</b> and focusing lenses was modified by applying a gold coating. It was demonstrated that the signal stability of the MS dramatically improved when using the gold-coated parts. The contribution of each part to the stability improvement was quantitatively determined and compared with the standard stainless steel source performance. It was assumed that the signal drift observed with the stainless steel EI source originated from charge buildup on the surfaces. This hypothesis was supported by software simulations. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A {{prediction}} method is presented for the gas-sided plate temperatures at the inlet {{and at the}} outlet of a compact, cross-flow condenser. The method employs measured (or predicted) heat flow rates and temperatures of both coolant and gas, at inlet and outlet. The method is validated using infrared recordings of temperature field histories. A comparison is made with a method to predict the mean gas-sided temperature using a coolant side 'established' relation and conduction in the wall. The latter method has also been validated utilising infrared thermography. <b>Exit</b> <b>plate</b> temperature predictions are important for the prediction of the maximum gas cleaning efficiency of the condenser, used as a scrubber to extract toxic soluble components...|$|E

An exterior cavity {{is defined by}} partially transmissible surfaces such as a laser <b>exit</b> <b>plate,</b> a detector input, etc. That cavity is spoiled by placing an oscillating plate in the laser beam. For tunable diode laser spectroscopy in the mid-infrared region, a Brewster-plate spoiler allows the harmonic detection of absorptances of less than 10 to the - 5 in a single laser scan. Improved operation is achieved without subtraction techniques, without complex laser frequency modulation, and without distortion of the molecular lineshape signal. The technique is applicable to tunable lasers operating from UV to IR wavelengths and in spectrometers which employ either short or long pathlengths, {{including the use of}} retroreflectors or multipass cells...|$|E

In this numerical study, three-dimensional (3 D) simulations {{are carried out}} in FLUENT 14. 0 to investigate the effect of Reynolds number, distance between nozzle <b>exit</b> and the <b>plate</b> on the heat transfer characteristics. V 2 F turbulence model {{has been used to}} model turbulence. Standard kappa-epsilon, Realizable kappa-epsilon, kappa-epsilon RNG, SST kappa-omega, Standard kappa-omega, V 2 F turbulence models have been studied for orthogonal jet impingement in this work. It is observed that for jet <b>exit</b> to <b>plate</b> distance (Z/d) of 0. 5 = 6, numerical results vary significantly from the experimental results.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop an {{efficient}} approach for vibro-acoustic analysis. Being simple and representative, an <b>exited</b> <b>plate</b> acoustic system is selected as a validation case for the vibro-acoustic analysis as the system presents one twodimensional statistical component (modal dense structure panel-plate) connected to the other component (deterministic acoustic volume-cavity) through the area junction over a surface domain, rather than at a line boundary. Potential industrial applications of the system vibro-acoustic analysis would be in acoustic modelling of vehicle body panels such as the cabin roof panel, and door panels for the boom noise analysis. A new deterministic-statistical analysis approach is proposed from a combination or hybrid of deterministic analysis and statistical energy analysis (SEA) approaches. General theory of the new deterministic-statistical analysis approach is introduced. The main advantage of the new deterministic-statistical analysis approach is its possibility in place of the time consuming Monte Carlo simulation. In order to illustrate and validate the new deterministic-statistical analysis approach, three approaches of the deterministic analysis, the statistical energy analysis and the new deterministicstatistical analysis are then applied to conduct the plate-acoustic system modelling, and their results will be compared. The vibro-acoustic energy coupling characteristic of the plate-acoustic system will be studied. The most suitable frequency range for the new approach will be identified in consideration of computational accuracy, information and speed...|$|R

Columnar dendrites are continuously formed {{on the plate}} wall. Because of the forced convection, these dendrites are sheared off into equiaxed/fragmented grains and then washed away continuously by producing semisolid slurry at plate <b>exit.</b> <b>Plate</b> cooling rate provides required extent/amount of solidification whereas plate length enables necessary shear for producing semisolid slurry of desired quality. Slurry obtained is solidified in metal mould to produce semisolid-cast billets of desired microstructure. Furthermore, semisolid-cast billets are also heat-treated to improve surface quality. Microstructures of both semisolid-cast and heat-treated billets are compared. The effects of plate length and plate cooling rate on solidification and microstructure of billets produced by using oblique plate are illustrated. Three different plate lengths (200 mm, 250 mm, 300 mm) associated with three different heat transfer coefficients (1000, 2000 and 2500 W/(m(2). K)) are involved. Plate length of 250 mm with heat transfer coefficient of 2000 W/(m(2).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} numerical {{and experimental}} {{studies on the}} onset and evolution of laminar cellular flames of CH 4 /O- 2 /CO 2 (oxy-fuel) and CH 4 /air mixtures under adiabatic conditions, stabilized in the proximity of a flat-flame burner at atmospheric pressure. In the numerical simulations, a two-dimensional domain with periodicity at the transverse far field boundaries is resolved using a high accuracy finite difference method and employing a detailed chemical kinetic mechanism and detailed transport properties. In the experiments a specially designed adiabatic flat-flame burner, a so-called heat flux burner, is employed. A key parameter, the standoff distance between the flame front and the burner <b>exit</b> <b>plate,</b> is identified. A critical standoff distance is found, above which cellular flame instability is observed. It is shown that the critical standoff distance {{is closely related to}} the density ratio and the laminar flame thickness for each flame studied. The observed onset of cellular flames is governed by the hydrodynamic instability mechanism, which is generally suppressed by the burner when the flame is very close to the burner plate. Diffusive-thermal effects {{play an important role in}} the flame instability when the flame is far from the burner. The critical standoff distance has no clear correlation with the Lewis number, indicating a less significant effect of diffusive-thermal instability on the flames near the burner.

40|$|Gas chromatography-mass {{spectrometry}} is a {{well established}} analytical technique. However, mass spectrometers with electron ionization sources may suffer from signal drifts, hereby negatively influencing quantitative performance. To demonstrate this phenomenon for a real application, a static headspace-gas chromatography method in combination with electron ionization-quadrupole mass spectrometry was optimized for the determination of residual dichloromethane in coronary stent coatings. Validating the method, the quantitative performance of an original stainless steel ion source was {{compared to that of}} a modified ion source. Ion source modification included the application of a gold coating on the repeller and <b>exit</b> <b>plate.</b> Several validation aspects such as limit of detection, limit of quantification, linearity and precision were evaluated using both ion sources. It was found that, as expected, the stainless steel ion source suffered from signal drift. As a consequence, non-linearity and high RSD values for repeated analyses were obtained. An additional experiment was performed to check whether an internal standard compound would lead to better results. It was found that the signal drift patterns of the analyte and internal standard were different, consequently leading to high RSD values for the response factor. With the modified ion source however, a more stable signal was observed resulting in acceptable linearity and precision. Moreover, it was also found that sensitivity improved compared to the stainless steel ion source. Finally, the optimized method with the modified ion source was applied to determine residual dichloromethane in the coating of coronary stents. The solvent was detected but found to be below the limit of quantification. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{behavior}} of a completely new ion trap is shown with SIMION 7. 0 simulations. The simulated trap, which was a mix of a linear and a 3 D trap, was made by axially setting two ion guides with a gap between them. Each guide consisted of three rods with three symmetrically delayed radio frequency (rf) voltages (tripole). The “injected” ions were linearly contained by pulsed potentials on the entrance and <b>exit</b> <b>plates.</b> Then the three-dimensional (3 D) rf field in the gap, which {{was created by the}} tripole special rod arrangement, could trap the ions when the translational energy was dampened by collisions with low-pressure nitrogen. Because the injected ions were trapped in the small gap, the trapping cycle could be repeated many times before ion ejection, so a high concentrated ion cloud could be obtained. This trapping and accumulation methodology is not possible in most conventional multipole linear traps with even number of poles. Compared with quadrupole linear trap at the same rf amplitude, tripole lost more ions due to strong charge repulsion in the ion cloud. However, tripole could catch up the ions at higher voltage. Radial and axial mass-independent ejection of the ions localized in the tripole gap was very simple, compared with conventional linear ion traps that need extra and complicated electrodes for effective axial ejection...|$|R

The {{objective is to}} identify a sensor {{that is capable of}} measuring small amounts of refrigerant liquid in the superheated vapor at evaporator exits.

Melt flow inertia shears columnar dendrites formed on plate wall into equiaxed/fragmented grains by resulting semisolid slurry at <b>plate</b> <b>exit.</b> Effects of <b>plate</b> length providing required shear and cooling rate enabling necessary solidification are investigated. A 3 -phase numerical model vis-a a-vis transport of mass, momentum, energy and species is developed for prediction of velocity, temperature, macrosegregation and solid fraction.

Darcy model is used for porous mushy zone. Slurry variable viscosity is represented by Oldenburg model. Stokes model incorporates solid phase movement and gravity effect along the flow.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{experiments}} and numerical simulations of adiabatic laminar premixed flames anchored to a heat-flux burner using different mixtures under various operating conditions. The {{aim is to}} obtain {{a better understanding of}} cellular instability in heat-flux burner anchored flames. Numerical and experimental studies were carried out to characterize the onset and the evolution of cellular flames in CH 4 /O 2 /CO 2 (oxy-fuel) and CH 4 /air mixtures under various standoff distances between the flame and the burner. The numerical simulations were based on a high-order numerical scheme for low Mach number reacting flows coupled with detailed chemical kinetic mechanisms and transport properties. A critical standoff distance was found, above which cellular flame instability was observed. It was shown that the critical standoff distance is closely correlated with the density ratio and with the laminar flame thickness in each flame studied. The observed onset of cellular flames is dictated by the hydrodynamic instability mechanism, which is generally suppressed by the burner when the flame is very close to the <b>exit</b> <b>plate</b> of the burner. Diffusive-thermal effects play a lesser role in these methane/oxidizer mixtures. Additional studies carried out on adiabatic H 2 /O 2 /N 2 premixed flames anchored to the heat-flux burner showed that H 2 flames with an effective Lewis number of less than unity are subjected not only to hydrodynamic instability but also to strong diffusive-thermal instability, these flames thus very easily becoming cellular. In general, when the flames were very close to the burner, the burner suppressed the flame instability. At a moderate standoff distance, the burner was able to suppress the instability often found with large wavenumbers but not with certain small wavenumbers. In the case of lean H 2 flames, when these became cellular, the mean burning velocity could be 2 - 3 times higher than that of a corresponding planar flame, local extinction occurring due to differential diffusion. Numerical studies showed that the nonlinear evolution of cellular flames can lead to rather chaotic flame shapes and that the evolution process itself can be very sensitive both to the initial conditions and to the numerical schemes and the grid resolutions involved. After a sufficiently long temporal evolution, whatever the initial conditions were, large cells were found to become the dominant mode in the cellular flame front. The onset of large cells was governed by the degree of hydrodynamic instability that was found...|$|E
40|$|The {{kinetic energy}} spread (defined {{here as the}} {{standard}} deviation of the beam particle energies) sets the ultimate theoretical limit on the longitudinal compression that can be attained on NDCX-I and NDCX-II. Experimental measurements will inevitably include the real influences on the longitudinal phase space of the beam due to injector and accelerator field imperfections 1. These induced energy variations may be the real limit to the longitudinal compression in an accelerator. We report on a numerical investigation of the energy spread evolution in NDCX-I; these studies do not include all the real imperfections, but rather are intended to confirm {{that there are no}} other intrinsic mechanisms (translaminar effects, transverse-longitudinal anisotropy instability, etc.) for significant broadening of the energy distribution. We have performed Warp simulations that use a realistic Marx voltage waveform which was derived from experimental measurements (averaged over several shots), a fully-featured model of the accelerating and focusing lattice, and new diagnostics for computing the local energy spread (and temperature) that properly account for linear correlations that arise from the discrete binning along each physical dimension (these capabilities reproduce and extend those of the earlier HIF code BPIC). The new diagnostics allow for the calculation of multi-dimensional maps of energy spread and temperature in 2 -D axisymmetric or 3 -D Cartesian space at selected times. The simulated beam-line was terminated at z = 3 m by a conducting plate, so as to approximately reproduce the experimental conditions at the entrance of the spectrometer that was used for mapping the longitudinal phase space. Snapshots of the beam projection and current, as well as the Marx waveform and history of beam kinetic energy collected at the end plate, are shown in Fig. 1. A two-dimensional axisymmetric map of energy spread from simulations of a typical NDCX-I configuration is shown in Fig. 2 (a). The energy spread starts at 0. 1 eV at the source and rapidly rises to a few eV, then fluctuates between a fraction of an eV and tens of eV, ending near the exit in a range of a few eV at {{the outer edge of the}} beam to a few tens of eV near the axis. The higher value on-axis is associated with greater numerical noise there, due to the axisymmetric geometry of the calculation, resulting in poorer simulation-particle statistics at small radius. A scatter plot of the macroparticles kinetic energy (KE) versus radius (R) and longitudinal position (0. 28 m < z < 3 m) colored by local energy spread is shown in Fig. 2 (b). As expected, there is a correlation of the kinetic energy with radius that is clearly visible at z = 2. 8 m and vanishes at the metal plate at z = 3 m. More snapshots from simulations varying the time step, grid resolution and number of macroparticles are given in Appendix II. The macro-particles were collected at the <b>exit</b> <b>plate</b> and their kinetic energy history is plotted in Fig. 3 (left) and contrasted to an experimental measurement using a streak camera shown in Fig. 3. For some types of measurements, averaging over several pulses to improve signal-to-noise will contribute an additional spread that may not be present on any single beam pulse. The upper bound for the energy spread is in the range of a few 100 eV for the experiment while in the range of a few eV for the reported Warp simulations. The Marx voltage exhibits variations in the range of up to several hundreds of volts, playing a significant role in the experimentally measured energy spread, which may account for the difference between the experimental and the simulated bounds...|$|E

The models and numerical code are validated by comparing the numerical results with the published experimental results. The effects of air-to-liquid ratio, nozzle diameter, liquid mass flow rate, and the position of impinging plate on the Weber number and K number as well as the droplet deposition onto the plate are discussed. The results show that the droplet velocity near the plate increases with increasing air-to-liquid ratio and liquid mass flow rate, and with decreasing nozzle diameter and axial distance from the nozzle <b>exit</b> to the <b>plate.</b> The droplet diameter near the plate increases with increasing axial distance from the nozzle <b>exit</b> to the <b>plate,</b> and with decreasing air-to-liquid ratio. As a function of the nozzle diameter and liquid mass flow rate, the variation of droplet diameter is not monotonous and the effect of liquid mass flow rate on the droplet diameter is insignificant. In the studied operating conditions, it is difficult for the droplet to rebound off the plate when impinging on the plate but it is easier for the droplet to splash. In order to create a condition which can benefit the droplet deposition when impinging on the plate, the suggested ways are to reduce the air-to-liquid ratio and liquid mass flow rate, increase the nozzle diameter, and select a suitable range of axial distance from the nozzle <b>exit</b> to the <b>plate.</b> Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|Preliminary {{analysis}} of the cross-shaped spiral (CSS) fuel assembly suggests great thermal-hydraulic upside. According to computational models, the increase in rod surface area, combined {{with an increase in}} coolant turbulence and inter-channel mixing will allow for a greater than 25 % uprate in total core power, without loss of safety margin. Proper design of the rod dimensions can limit circumferential heat-flux to a peak-to-average ratio of 1. 88. Non-uniformities in heat flux due to its unusual geometry seem to particularly ally CSS fuel to the BWR core, where limiting conditions {{are less likely to be}} locally influenced. Furthermore, the increase in cooling surface and reduction in central pin thickness is expected to drop fuel centerline temperature an estimated 2000 C under nominal operating conditions, a reduction which rises to 3000 C at 125 % of nominal power conditions. In addition to these advantages, the absence of grid spacers within the CSS fuel assembly is expected to lower pressure losses, aiding natural convection and core stability. Spacers typically account for 25 - 30 % of the total core pressure drop. Experimental measurements of hydraulic: losses for 1. 5 -meter-long model CSS rods in 4 x 4 arrays show a larger pressure drop at the same flow velocity than for bare cylindrical rods. However, this results in a CSS-bundle turbulent friction factor which is only 90 % of the expected value given its hydraulic diameter. The effect of twist pitch on this pressure drop and friction factor is negligible in the range of twists examined. (cont.) Combined with the elimination of grid spacers, this results in a 40 % reduction in core hydraulic loss from the reference case (neglecting entrance and <b>exit</b> <b>plates).</b> All told, the use of CSS rods should reduce total core pressure drop at nominal power by 9 %, in spite of a reduction in core flow area.

40|$|AbstractIn this study, {{we examine}} the effect of {{surrounding}} liquid on the motion of gravity-driven drops through a round-edged circular orifice using high-speed visualization and refractive index matched PIV. The overall motion of the drop is separated into three stages: pre-impact, penetration and release. We show that in liquid/liquid systems, the surrounding fluid influences the drop velocity during both pre-impact and release stages. During the pre-impact stage, the drop approaches the orifice by displacing the surrounding liquid radially across the plate as well as axially through the orifice. During the release stage on the other hand, surrounding fluid is drawn downward into the orifice as the drop <b>exits</b> below the <b>plate.</b> In both cases, the drop decelerates due to added mass and viscous effects, which are negligible in liquid/gas flows. Drop breakup is promotedby a higher viscosity surrounding such that the volume of the satellite drop increases when the drop-to-surrounding-fluid viscosity ratio is decreased...|$|R

The studied combinations are H/B= 2 for Re = 10000, H/B= 4 for Re= 20000 and H/B= 9. 2 for Re= 20000. The focus is on small distance of the nozzle <b>exit</b> to the <b>plate.</b> This means for impact of the jet onto the plate before complete mixing of the shear layers. The centre of the impact zone is then in laminar state and the developing boundary layer on the plate undergoes transition to turbulent state. The transitional flow cannot be correctly simulated with a RANS turbulence model, but we will demonstrate that a hybrid model is basically correct. The test case with the large nozzle-to-plat...|$|R
5000|$|Metal balls {{start as}} a wire. The wire is sheared to give a pellet with a length {{approximately}} {{the size of the}} desired ball [...] (OD). This pellet is then headed into a rough spherical shape. Next, the balls are then fed into a machine that de-flashes them. The machine does this by feeding the balls between two heavy cast iron or hardened steel plates, called rill plates. One of the plates is held stationary while the other rotates. The top plate has an opening to allow balls to enter and <b>exit</b> the rill <b>plates.</b> These plates have fine circumferential grooves that the balls track in. The balls are run through the machine long enough so that each ball passes through many of these grooves, which ensures each ball is the same size, even if a particular groove is out of specification. The controllable machine variables are the amount of pressure applied, the speed of the plates, and how long the balls are left in the machine.|$|R
40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{treatment of}} an ideal axisymmetric fluid jet flowing out of a tube and impinging normally against a flat plate was made in this study. The problem of an axisymmetric impinging jet was solved by Schach using the integral equation method of Trefftz. However Schach assumed implicitly that the velocity ratio was equal to I, where V infinity and Uoo are the velocities of the incident stream and deflected stream, respectively, at infinity from the origin. This assumption considerably simplifies the problem since it requires that {{the magnitude of the}} velocity along the tube wall and the magnitude of the velocity along the free streamline be equal to the magnitude of V infinity. The validity of this assumption has not been investigated prior to the present study for the axisymmetric geometry. In the two-dimensional problem, it has been shown by conformal mapping that a {{is a function of the}} ratio h/R, where h is the distance of the tube <b>exit</b> from the <b>plate</b> and R is the tube radius, a approaches 1 when the tube exit is infinitely far from the plate and becomes infinite as the tube <b>exit</b> approaches the <b>plate.</b> In this work, the effects of a on the velocity distribution were taken into consideration. The value of ok was determined according to the ratio h/R. A simple procedure was developed to check the assumed value of infinity and to justify the validity of the assumed shape of the free streamline. A reasonable form of the velocity distribution along the tube wall was also proposed to satisfy the boundary conditions of the velocity at the tube exit and at infinity. The flow field of an axisymmetric jet {{of an ideal}} fluid impinging normally against a flat plate with h/R = 0. 7072 was solved as an example to apply the method developed in this work. The results show that the value of c 4 is equal to 1 and that the free streamline can be suitably represented by the hyperbola rz = constant for r > 3, with R = 1 and h = 0. 7072, where r and z are radial and axial coordinates respectively...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{prediction}} {{of the rolling}} force is critical to assuring {{the quality of the}} final product in steel manufacturing. <b>Exit</b> thickness of <b>plate</b> for each pass is calculated from roll gap, mill spring, and predicted roll force. Ideal pass scheduling is dependent on a precise {{prediction of}} the roll force in each pass. This paper will introduce a concept that allows obtaining the material model parameters directly from the rolling process on an industrial scale by the uniform differential neural network. On the basis of the characteristics that the uniform distribution can fully characterize the solution space and enhance the diversity of the population, uniformity research on differential evolution operator is made to get improved crossover with uniform distribution. When its original function is transferred with a transfer function, the uniform differential evolution algorithms can quickly solve complex optimization problems. Neural network structure and weights threshold are optimized by uniform differential evolution algorithm, and a uniform differential neural network is formed to improve rolling force prediction accuracy in process control system...|$|R
40|$|Heat {{transfer}} {{characteristics and}} flow patterns were measured over the plate for various separation distances between the nozzle <b>exit</b> and target <b>plate</b> {{when the air}} issuing from a sharpedged cross-shaped nozzle impinges on the plate. The local heat transfer coefficients in the radial direction for different circumferential positions were calculated using the wall temperatures measured by means of thermocouples, and the flow patterns were observed using a oil-titanium IV oxide method. The isotherms of the infrared images were also measured using an infrared radiometer with a two-dimensional array of InSb sensors. The geometric axes were switched due to the self-induced velocity of a vortex filament; the convex corners became flat and the concave corners generated outward ejection. The distribution of the iso-heat-transfer-coefficient contours corresponds well to the flow pattern and the isotherm contours. These contours extended diagonally and demonstrated the Andrew's cross pattern for the short separations, subsequently becoming the octagonal patten, and then becoming circular at large separations. The correspondence of the heat transfer characteristic to the flow behaviors, and the heat transfer mechanism were also described...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFilm cooling {{is one of}} {{the cooling}} {{techniques}} used in gas turbines to protect the blades from high temperature. The efficiency of gas turbine can be increased by increasing the inlet gas temperature. The present study aims at numerical investigation of adiabatic film cooling effectiveness over the cylindrical hole <b>exit</b> flat <b>plate</b> test model. The hole inclination angle of 20 ° with stream wise direction is considered. The test model has 35 film cooling holes arranged in two rows in a staggered configuration with the coolant hole length to diameter ratio of 5. 4 and pitch to diameter ratio of 4. During the experimental analysis, the adiabatic film cooling effectiveness is found at five different blowing ratios in the range of 0. 5 to 2. 5 with the coolant to mainstream density ratio at 1. 6. The laterally averaged film cooling effectiveness is calculated along the stream wise direction at these blowing ratios. The realizable k-epsilon turbulence model with enhanced wall function is used to solve the flow field. The CFD obtained results are validated with the experimental results at a blowing ratio of 1. 0. Further, the CFD analysis is done for other blowing ratios in the range of 0. 5 to 4. 0 at density ratios of 1. 6, 1. 8 and 2. 0. From the CFD results, the laterally averaged film cooling effectiveness is found to be increasing with the increase in blowing ratio up to 1. 5 immediately downstream of the coolant holes. For the blowing ratios of 2. 0 to 4, the adiabatic film cooling effectiveness is less immediately downstream of coolant holes up to x/d= 15 and then increases with increase in the blowing ratios considered...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Thermoplastic {{composite}} manufacturing {{is often}} difficult due to high viscosity of the matrix materials. Coupling {{a high level of}} mechanical properties with simple, low-cost processing technique is a difficult subject, but an important task for any state-of-the-art impregnation processes. In this paper, Thermoplastic Prepreg Fabrication Technology is utilized to prepare thermoplastic tapes and the technology's effect on strain energy absorption was investigated. The tape was prepared under three categories: first, with induced vibration and no fiber preheat (NV), second, without vibration and fiber preheat (HN) and last, with both fiber preheat and vibration (HV). For the purpose of comparison, all other variables such as pulling speed, fiber tension, fiber preheat and processing temperature were kept constant. The HV category showed improvement in the strain energy absorption by 10 and 23 % when compared to HN and NV, respectively. In addition, HV had better wetting, fiber spread and dispersion. Fiber preheating is important as it worked well with vibration possibly due to good fiber spread on the HV category (widest tape). Also, HV had the least fiber volume fraction as it takes more matrix volume when <b>exiting</b> the die <b>plate...</b>|$|R
40|$|Flow {{and heat}} {{transfer}} through the boundary layers of a falling liquid film on a vertical permeable plate subject to nonuniform suction flow are analyzed in this work. The continuity, momentum, and energy equations are transformed to nonsimilar equations and solved using a validated implicit and iterative finite difference method. Increases in the Froude number, Galilei number, and the dimensionless average suction velocity {{are found to}} increase the skin friction coefficient, the Nusselt number, and the heat transfer enhancement ratios. These enhancement ratios are noticed to increase at the <b>plate</b> <b>exit</b> as the suction velocity power-law index increases. The Froude number for uniform suction case required to attain the same enhancement ratios due to nonuniform distribution of this suction flow is found to increase as the Galilei number, average suction velocity, and power-law index increase. It is found that the upper most values of the enhancement factors in heat transfer and Froude number are m + 1 folds when the suction power-law index is equal to m. This work demonstrated that significant heat transfer enhancement inside developing gravity-driven liquid films is attainable when properly distributing the suction velocity along the plate...|$|R
