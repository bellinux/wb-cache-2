40|$|Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} {{a change in}} focus from considerations of factors which could impede competition, for example over-regulation, {{to the need to}} strike a balance between over-regulation and insufficient regulation – in order to provide the right level of safety for consumers (such that they are protected from risky investments). A driving force behind the need for deregulation over the past two decades has been the objective and desire to foster competition. Re-regulation thereafter assumed centre stage in some jurisdictions in response to the need to manage cross sector services' risks more efficiently. Rescue cases involving guarantees (contrasted with restructuring cases) during the recent Financial Crisis, have illustrated the prominent position which the goal of promoting financial stability has assumed over that of the prevention or limitation of possible distortions of competition which may arise when granting State aid. The importance attached to maintaining and promoting financial stability - as well as the need to facilitate rescue and restructuring measures aimed at preventing systemically relevant financial institutions from failure, demonstrate how far authorities are willing to overlook certain competition policies. However increased government and central bank intervention also simultaneously trigger the usual concerns – which include moral hazard and the danger of serving as long term substitutes for market discipline. An interesting observation derives from the relationship between State aid grants, competition, and the potential to induce higher risk taking levels. Whilst the need to promote and maintain financial stability is paramount, safeguards need to be implemented and enforced to ensure that measures geared towards the aim of sustaining system stability (measures such as lender of last resort arrangements and State rescues) do not unduly distort competition as well as induce higher risk taking levels. This paper will draw attention to safeguards which have been provided by the Commission where approval is considered for the grant of State aid to financial institutions whose problems are attributable to inefficiencies, poor asset liability management or risky strategies. Whether the distinction drawn by the Commission – with regards to the preferential grant of recapitalisation packages to <b>fundamentally</b> <b>sound</b> <b>banks</b> (which require less restructuring measures) is justified, will also be considered. How far central banks and governments should intervene and how far distortions of competition should be permitted ultimately depends on how systemically relevant a financial institution is. ...|$|R

5000|$|Regarding {{his second}} point on audio quality, Seto {{outlined}} {{the process for}} the creation of the <b>sound</b> <b>bank.</b> Previous <b>sound</b> <b>banks</b> were created by first deciding on a person, and then recording his or her voice. However, this was no guarantee that the person’s voice would be suitable for VOCALOID. Keeping this in mind, YAMAHA started with a total of forty candidates in their teens and twenties, and recorded temporary <b>sound</b> <b>banks</b> for all of them to test the sound quality before deciding on who the final three people would be. For these three, YAMAHA made them undergo over a half-year’s worth of [...] "training" [...] in practicing to read the [...] "incantations" [...] from which the phonemes could be extracted. Seto noted that this was because these incantations were very different from what would normally be on a dialogue script, but after training, the vocalists would be able to recite it all. The final stage of the process was that the staff at the YAMAHA Research and Development Center worked to put the data together into a <b>sound</b> <b>bank.</b>|$|R

40|$|Banking and {{monetary}} policy {{play an important}} role in Indonesian economic development. Many people and organizations are using banking services to save their money or make loans. Therefore, the most important thing that must be done by bank is keeping people's trust to monetary system, through its close relationship with the coor-dinators and government institutions. To support the success of trustworthy and <b>sound</b> <b>banking</b> industrial develop-ment in Indonesia, it's needed a complete, accurate, and reliable information about many things of banking activities. Subsequent event disclosure is one of the most important information disclosure that should be disclosed in annual banking report, because it's very useful for an auditor to determine whether there're something material that will be able to influence valuation or appraising of financial statements are being audited. The aim of this paper is to analyze <b>sound</b> <b>banking</b> standard and disclosure level of subsequent event on annual banking reports which are listed in Jakarta Stock Exchange, in 31 December 2001. The research methodology that used is co-relational descriptive analyses by getting data from annual banking reports in Jakarta Stock Exchange library. The result is there are a positive correlation between <b>sound</b> <b>banking</b> standard and disclosure level of subsequent event. But its correlation is very weak because the score is only 0. 25. Meanwhile, 6. 37 % score of R square shows that subsequent event disclosure is more influenced by another factors besides <b>sound</b> <b>banking</b> standard.
