25|$|Nash Rambler – Mason’s {{vision for}} a small {{inexpensive}} compact car was changed in light of raw goods shortages, so Mason directed the car to emerge not as a stripped down <b>economy</b> <b>car,</b> but as an upmarket compact sedan-convertible.|$|E

The airport has parking for 1,050 cars, divided into four categories: short-term, business plus, business and <b>economy.</b> <b>Car</b> rental is available from Avis, Budget, Europcar, Hertz and National. Taxis are also available.|$|E
50|$|As Europe and Japan rebuilt {{from the}} war, their growing economies {{led to a}} steady {{increase}} in demand for cheap cars to 'motorise the masses'. Emerging technology allowed <b>economy</b> <b>cars</b> to become more sophisticated. Early post-war <b>economy</b> <b>cars</b> like the VW Beetle, Citroën 2CV, Renault 4CV, and Saab 92 looked extremely minimal; however, they were technologically more advanced than most conventional cars of the time.|$|R

50|$|During the 1950s, the BMW line-up {{consisted}} of luxury cars with displacements of two litres or greater, <b>economy</b> <b>cars</b> powered by motorcycle engines, and motorcycles. With their luxury cars becoming increasingly outdated and unprofitable and their motorcycles and <b>economy</b> <b>cars</b> becoming less attractive to an increasingly affluent society, BMW needed {{a car in}} the 1.5 to 2 litre class to become competitive. Prototypes powered by a 1.6 L engine based on one bank of the BMW OHV V8 engine were built and evaluated without a convincing result.|$|R
25|$|The four {{most popular}} cars in Russia in 2009 were all AvtoVAZ models. The <b>economy</b> <b>car</b> Lada Priora topped the list with 84,779 sold units. Lada Samara was second with 77,679 units sold in Russia, and the classic Lada 2105/2107 was third {{with sales of}} 57,499. Lada 2105 was {{expected}} to considerably increase sales following the car scrappage scheme launched in March 2010. The higher-end Lada Kalina was the fourth most sold car in Russia in 2009, selling 52,499 units that year.|$|E
25|$|As the {{automobile}} marketplace in the U.S. was {{moving away from}} economy towards performance and luxury vehicles, American Motors began removing the historic Rambler name from its larger models. However, the American and Classic models retained their <b>economy</b> <b>car</b> marketing image, {{as well as their}} traditional nameplate. To cement this image, a Rambler American was again the overall winner in the Mobil Economy Run. The mid-trim level 330 model was dropped, leaving the top 440 and base 220 models in the lineup for 1966. The top of the line model, available only as a two-door hardtop, saw its name changed from 440-H, to Rogue.|$|E
25|$|The {{beginning}} of the 1960s saw {{the release of the}} Moskvitch 408, intended to be an <b>economy</b> <b>car</b> that would spread the use of cars among the population. Other manufacturers such as MZMA, GAZ and ZAZ were offering a variety of cars intended for the mass market. The Soviet government opted to build an even larger car manufacturing plant that would produce a people's car and help to meet the demand for personal transport. For reasons of cost-efficiency, it was decided to produce the car on the basis of an existing, modern foreign model. After considering several options, the Fiat 124 was chosen because of its simple and sturdy design, being easy to manufacture and repair.|$|E

5000|$|As an {{alternative}} to manual synchromesh gearboxes, automatic continuously variable transmission (CVT) gearboxes are optional on some <b>economy</b> <b>cars,</b> such as Audi, Honda, and the MINI ONE and MINI Cooper. Tata Motors from India, recently announced that it too would use a variomatic transmission in its [...] Nano. CVT application to <b>economy</b> <b>cars</b> was pioneered by Fiat, Ford, and Van Doorne in the 1980s. Rather than the pulled rubber drive belts as {{used in the past}} by DAF, the modern transmission is made much more durable by the use of electronic control and steel link belts pushed by their pulleys.|$|R
50|$|Other {{well known}} <b>economy</b> <b>cars</b> like the Volkswagen Beetle and the Citroën 2CV 'peoples cars' are {{sometimes}} referred to as econoboxes, though {{they do not have the}} requisite square shape of a true econobox.|$|R
25|$|The {{purchase}} {{price of the}} 2CV was low relative to its competition. In West Germany during the 1960s, for example, it cost about {{half as much as}} a Volkswagen Beetle. From the mid-1950s <b>economy</b> <b>car</b> competition had increased— internationally {{in the form of the}} 1957 Fiat 500 and 1955 Fiat 600, and 1959 Austin Mini. By 1952, Germany produced a price competitive car - the Messerschmitt KR175, followed in 1955 by the Isetta - these were microcars, not complete four-door cars like the 2CV. On the French home market, from 1961, the small Simca 1000 using licensed Fiat technology, and the larger Renault 4 hatchback had become available. The R4 was the biggest threat to the 2CV, eventually outselling it.|$|E
25|$|Within a year, George W. Romney, future {{governor}} of Michigan, took over, reorganizing {{the company and}} focusing AMC's future on a new small car line. By the end of 1957 the legacy Nash and Hudson brands were completely phased out. The company struggled at first, but Rambler sales took off. A Rambler won the 1959 Mobil Economy Run and by 1960, was the third most popular brand of automobile in the United States, behind Ford and Chevrolet. After two model years (1963 and 1964) of only producing compact cars, AMC focused back to larger and more profitable cars like the Ambassador line from the perceived negative of the Rambler's <b>economy</b> <b>car</b> image. In the face of deteriorating financial and market positions, Roy D. Chapin, Jr., took charge to revitalize the company, and designer Richard A. Teague economized by developing several vehicles from common stampings. While prices and costs were cut, new and more sporty automobiles were introduced, and from 1968 AMC became known for the Javelin and AMX muscle cars.|$|E

2500|$|Featuring a {{shortened}} Hornet {{platform and}} bodywork with a pronounced, almost vertical, hatchback tail, the Gremlin was classified an <b>economy</b> <b>car</b> by 1970s U.S. standards and competed with the Chevrolet Vega and Ford Pinto, {{as well as}} imported cars that included the Volkswagen Beetle and Toyota Corolla. The small domestic automaker marketed the Gremlin as [...] "the first American-built import".|$|E
2500|$|Citroën had {{attempted}} to replace the ultra-utilitarian 2CV several times (with the Dyane, Visa, and the AX). Its comically antiquated appearance became an advantage to the car, {{and it became a}} niche product which sold because it was different from anything else on sale. Because of its down-to-earth <b>economy</b> <b>car</b> style, it became popular with people who wanted to distance themselves from mainstream consumerism— [...] "hippies"— and also with environmentalists.|$|E

25|$|Although AMC {{was best}} known for their {{reliable}} <b>economy</b> <b>cars,</b> this special model came with a bigger engine than anything found at Chevrolet, Ford, or Plymouth—the Rambler's most popular competitors at that time.

AMC executives saw the opportunity to change the consumers' perception of the automaker from Romney's <b>economy</b> <b>car</b> image, to the realities of the new marketplace interested in sporty, performance oriented vehicles. Robert B. Evans requested a car like the AMX to be put into production quickly.|$|E
2500|$|After World War II, Teague penned {{a design}} for a pre-Henry J <b>economy</b> <b>car</b> for Kaiser Motors. In 1947 he joined the General Motors design studios headed by Edmund Anderson.

The 1950s [...] "saw {{some of the most}} beautiful and some of the most outlandish vehicles" [...] and the head of the design department at General Motors liked chrome on cars. Teague described how two sets of overlay designs were made for Harley Earl to choose from. Both chrome trim sets had been put on one Oldsmobile prototype by mistake.

50|$|Some small <b>economy</b> <b>cars</b> have limiters, {{because of}} {{stability}} and other safety concerns (short crumple zones, etc.), and to safeguard their small engines from the prolonged overrevving required to produce the power to achieve higher speeds.
