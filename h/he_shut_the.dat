25|$|The Phillies were 47–58, 15 {{games behind}} the first-place Nationals, and 10 games behind the second wild card after their {{series against the}} Nationals on August 2. The Phillies started the month by taking 2 of 3 from the Arizona Diamondbacks. The game 3 victory was huge for Ryan Howard, who had {{struggled}} since coming off his injury. After getting booed by striking out when the game was tied in the 8th inning {{with the bases loaded}}, Ryan Howard came through by hitting an RBI single with the bases loaded in the ninth inning to win the game and the series. The victory also put them out of last place in the NL East {{for the first time since}} June 27. The Phillies then took 1 of 3 from the Braves, a team that they got swept by in the past 2 series. In game 1 of the series, the Phillies saw their sellout streak end when the Phillies did not have a sell-out crowd. This ended their streak at 257 games, the third-longest sellout streak in MLB history. The Phillies then took 2 of 3 from the St. Louis Cardinals and came back from 3 runs down to win game 3 in extra innings. The Phillies then also took 2 of 3 from the Miami Marlins. The Phillies then split the series at 2–2 against the Milwaukee Brewers and Cincinnati Reds. After their game 4 win against the Reds, the Phillies moved up to third place in the division for the first time since April 12. The Phillies then pulled off a three-game sweep of the Nationals, marking their second three-game sweep of the season. The Phillies would however take just 1 of 3 from the New York Mets. To finish the month, the Phillies would pull off a comeback win against the Braves in game 1 on August 31. The Phillies ended up taking 2 of 3 from that series. They could have swept the series, but the Phillies blew a 7–3 lead in the bottom of the 9th inning in game 3. The Phillies finished August by going 17-12, their best month of the season overall so far. However, Carlos Ruiz, who had been the star of the Phillies with his remarkable performance this season, had to sit out for 4–6 weeks because of a fractured knee that took a beating throughout the month. Ruiz was replaced by Erik Kratz due to catcher Brian Schneider also suffering an injury. This month also saw a huge improvement by Kyle Kendrick. After Charlie Manuel got really disappointed in an awful outing by Kyle in a 12-6 loss when he allowed 6 runs, he has been the hottest Phillies's pitcher since. Right away in his next outing, <b>he</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> Miami Marlins out, allowing no runs. He did the same in his next outing against a normally strong Milwaukee Brewers offense. Although in his next outing Kyle allowed a 2-run home run against the Washington Nationals, Kendrick received his 3rd win in a row when the Phillies won 4-2. Kendrick picked up his fourth win in a row when the Phillies won 3-2 against the New York Mets.|$|E
500|$|Bashō {{continued}} to be uneasy. He wrote to a friend that [...] "disturbed by others, I have no peace of mind". He made a living from teaching and appearances at haikai parties until late August 1693, when <b>he</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> gate to his bashō hut and refused to see anybody for a month. Finally, he relented after adopting the principle of karumi or [...] "lightness", a semi-Buddhist philosophy of greeting the mundane world rather than separating himself from it. Bashō left Edo {{for the last time}} in the summer of 1694, spending time in Ueno and Kyoto before his arrival in Osaka. He became sick with a stomach illness and died peacefully, surrounded by his disciples. Although he did not compose any formal death poem on his deathbed the following, being the last poem recorded during his final illness, is generally accepted as his poem of farewell: ...|$|E
500|$|The Flames {{hosted the}} Montreal Canadiens at McMahon Stadium in February for the 2011 Heritage Classic. The {{game was played}} before 41,022 fans who braved a {{windchill}} as cold as [...] Calgary won the game, 4–0, {{on the strength of}} Bourque's two goals, including the 100th of his career. Kiprusoff became the first goaltender in NHL history to record a shutout at an outdoor game, and his play remained strong following the Heritage Classic, as <b>he</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> Blues out in back-to-back games on February 27 and March 1. He then became the first goaltender in 25 years to stop two penalty shots in one game to lead the Flames to a 4–3 win over the Blue Jackets on March 4 as the Flames moved into fifth place in the West. Two nights later, Iginla scored his 30th goal of the season on a penalty shot against Pekka Rinne of the Nashville Predators. In doing so, he became the 10th player in NHL history to score at least 30 goals in ten consecutive seasons.|$|E

2500|$|The Valar then {{learned that}} Melkor was {{manipulating}} Fëanor, and sent Tulkas to capture Melkor, {{but he had}} already escaped. With Finwë and Fëanor's absence, Fingolfin had become king, and so it seemed that Melkor's lies were true. Melkor tried again to convince Fëanor of them, but Fëanor realised that Melkor's true goal was to obtain the Silmarils, [...] "and <b>he</b> <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> doors of his house {{in the face of}} the mightiest of all the dwellers in Eä." [...] In a rage, Melkor left. The Valar invited Fëanor and Fingolfin to Valinor to make peace. Fingolfin offered a hand to his half-brother, recognising Fëanor's place as the eldest.
