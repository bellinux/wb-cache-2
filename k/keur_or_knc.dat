40|$|Abstract Background Chest pain {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{complaints}} in the Emergency Department (ED), but the cost of ED chest pain patients is unclear. The aim of this study was to describe the direct hospital costs for unselected chest pain patients attending the emergency department (ED). Methods 1, 000 consecutive ED visits of patients with chest pain were retrospectively included. Costs directly following the ED visit were retrieved from the hospital economy system. Results The mean cost per patient visit was 26. 8 thousand Swedish kronar (kSEK) (median 7. 2 kSEK), with admission time accounting for 73 % of all costs. Mean cost for patients discharged from the ED was 1. 4 kSEK (median 1. 3 kSEK), and for patients without ACS admitted 1 day or less 7. 6 kSEK (median 6. 9 kSEK). The practice in the present study to admit 67 % of the patients, of whom only 31 % proved to have ACS, was estimated to give a cost per additional life-year saved by hospital admission, compared to theoretical strategy of discharging all patients home, of about 350 kSEK (39 <b>kEUR</b> <b>or</b> 42 kUSD). Conclusion Costs for chest pain patients are large and primarily due to admission time. The present admission practice seems to be cost-effective, but the substantial overadmission indicates that better ED diagnostics and triage could decrease costs considerably. </p...|$|R
40|$|A phenomenological {{model is}} {{proposed}} {{for the analysis of}} the properties of the Kaonic Nuclear Cluster (KNC) K − pp (or 2 ¯ K H) in its ground state. Inside the KNC 2 ¯K H we describe the relative motion in the pp pair and the motion of the K − – meson relative to the pp pair in terms of wave functions of 3 –dimensional harmonic oscillators in the momentum representation. The input parameter of our model is the frequency of the longitudinal oscillation of the K − –meson relative to the pp pair. We fix this parameter assuming that the strange baryon Λ(1405) is a bound state of the K−p pair <b>or</b> the <b>KNC</b> 1 K ¯ H. In terms of this parameter we calculate the binding energy ǫ 2 ¯K H = − 115 MeV, the partial widths and the total width of non –pionic decay channels, Γ (non−pion.) 2 ¯K...|$|R
25|$|The {{administration}} of the colony was promoting a transition from horizontal farming which largely ignored terrain to contour farming which fits with the frame and women, who {{did most of the}} agricultural work, resisted the transition. At the same time an unfounded rumor spread that the Kom traditional land would be sold to either the chairman of the <b>KNC</b> <b>or</b> to Igbo people in Nigeria (the KNC at this point had a platform of having the region join with Nigeria). The KNDP organized their efforts in the region emphasizing the women as key in the political situation.|$|R

It was the third and last royal house founded by the Joof family - (the Joof dynasty of Sine and Saloum) during the Guelowar period, since the reignes of Maad a Sinig Maysa Wali Jaxateh Manneh and Maad a Sinig Mahecor Joof (1350 and 1969 respectively). From the date of its foundation up to the dissolution of Sine in 1969, at least seven kings from this royal house had succeeded to the throne of Sine.|$|R
50|$|Proof. Consider a graph on t {{vertices}} and colour {{its edges}} with c colours. Now 'go colour-blind' and pretend that c − 1 and c {{are the same}} colour. Thus the graph is now (c − 1)-coloured. By the inductive hypothesis, it contains either a Kni mono-chromatically coloured with colour i for some 1 ≤ i ≤ c − 2 or a KR(nc − 1, nc)-coloured in the 'blurred colour'. In the former case we are finished. In the latter case, we recover our sight again and see from the definition of R(nc−1, nc) we must have either a (c − 1)-monochrome Knc−1 <b>or</b> a c-monochrome <b>Knc.</b> In either case the proof is complete.|$|R
40|$|We analyse the {{properties}} of the kaonic nuclear cluster (KNC) anti-KNN with the structure Nx(anti-KN) _(I = 0), having the quantum numbers I(J^P) = 1 / 2 (0 ^-), and treated as a quasi-bound hadronic molecule state. We describe {{the properties}} of the hadronic molecule, <b>or</b> the <b>KNC</b> Nx(anti-KN) _(I = 0), in terms of vibrational degrees of freedom with oscillator wave functions and chiral dynamics. These wave functions, having the meaning of trial wave functions of variational calculations, are parameterised by the frequency of oscillations of the (anti-KN) _(I = 0) pair, which is fixed in terms of the binding energy of the strange baryon resonance Lambda(1405), treated as a quasi-bound (anti-KN) _(I = 0) state. The binding energies B_X and widths Gamma_X of the states X = (anti-KN) _(I = 0) and X = anti-KNN, respectively, are calculated in the heavy-baryon approximation by using chiral Lagrangians with meson-baryon derivative couplings invariant under chiral SU(3) xSU(3) symmetry at the tree-level approximation. The results are B_(anti-KNN) = 40. 2 MeV and Gamma_(anti-KNN) = Gamma^(non-pionic) _(anti-KNN) + Gamma^(pionic) _(anti-KNN) ~ (85 - 106) MeV and, where Gamma^(non-pionic) _(anti-KNN) ~ 21 MeV and Gamma^(pionic) _(anti-KNN) ~ (64 - 86) MeV are the widths of non-pionic anti-KNN -> N Lambda^ 0, N Sigma and pionic anti-KNN -> N Sigma pi decay modes, calculated for B_(anti-KN) = 29 MeV and Gamma_(anti-KN) = (30 - 40) MeV, respectively.
