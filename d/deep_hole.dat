40|$|<b>Deep</b> <b>holes</b> play an {{important}} role in the decoding of generalized Reed-Solomon codes. Recently, Wu and Hong WH found a new class of <b>deep</b> <b>holes</b> for standard Reed-Solomon codes. In the present paper, we give a concise method to obtain a new class of <b>deep</b> <b>holes</b> for generalized Reed-Solomon codes. In particular, for standard Reed-Solomon codes, we get the new class of <b>deep</b> <b>holes</b> given in WH. Li and Wan L. W 1 studied <b>deep</b> <b>holes</b> of generalized Reed-Solomon codes GRS_k(,D) and characterized <b>deep</b> <b>holes</b> defined by polynomials of degree k+ 1. They showed that this problem is reduced to be a subset sum problem in finite fields. Using the method of Li and Wan, we obtain some new <b>deep</b> <b>holes</b> for special Reed-Solomon codes over finite fields with even characteristic. Furthermore, we study <b>deep</b> <b>holes</b> of the extended Reed-Solomon code, i. e., D= and show polynomials of degree k+ 2 can not define <b>deep</b> <b>holes...</b>|$|R
40|$|In this paper, <b>deep</b> <b>holes</b> of Reed-Solomon (RS) {{codes are}} studied. A {{new class of}} <b>deep</b> <b>holes</b> for {{generalized}} affine RS codes is given if the evaluation set satisfies certain combinatorial structure. Three classes of <b>deep</b> <b>holes</b> for projective Reed-Solomon (PRS) codes are constructed explicitly. In particular, <b>deep</b> <b>holes</b> of PRS codes with redundancy three are completely obtained when the characteristic of the finite field is odd.

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of {{classifying}} <b>deep</b> <b>holes</b> of Reed-Solomon codes.

This equivalence allows us to improve recent results on the former problem. In particular, we classify <b>deep</b> <b>holes</b> of Reed-Solomon codes of dimension greater than half the alphabet size. We also give a complete classification of <b>deep</b> <b>holes</b> of Reed Solomon codes with redundancy three in all dimensions...|$|R

25|$|A {{long time}} ago some young lads herded sheep on Hesselberg. At that {{time there was a}} deep cave on the mountain, which is buried today. Bursting with curiosity they wanted to know what was inside. One of them was lowered by rope down into the <b>deep</b> <b>hole.</b> Beforehand the boys had decided to pull him up {{immediately}} when he gave a tug on the rope. Soon after the boy went into the cave, a three-legged rabbit hobbled across the way, the other lads followed it spontaneously in order to catch it, but the farther they chased the faster the rabbit ran. Finally they gave up. When they returned to the cave they remembered their fellow in the hole and they immediately pulled the rope up. It was stained with blood and at its end there hung a goat's hoof, but the boy was gone forever.|$|E
25|$|Tiên Sơn cave {{is located}} in Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park. The cave was {{discovered}} by a local inhabitant by accident in 1935. It {{is located in}} Sơn Trach Commune in Bố Trạch. The entry mouth of Tiên Sơn is 1km from Phong Nha cave, {{at an altitude of}} 200 m. This cave is 980 m in length. A 10 m <b>deep</b> <b>hole</b> is situated 400 m from the entry mouth, then a 500 m long underground cave, dangerous for tourists and open to professional expeditionists only. Like Phong Nha cave, this cave features spectacular stalactites and stalagmites shaped like several fairy-tales. Stalactite and stalagmite columns and walls here create strange sounds like that of gong and drum if they are knocked with the hand. According to British cave scientists, Tiên Sơn cave was created tens of million years ago when a water current holed this limestone mount in Kẻ Bàng. Following a series of landforms and movement of rocks, this mass was levered or lowered, blocking the current and creating what is now Tiên Sơn cave while the underground river redirected its current to Phong Nha cave. Although Phong Nha and Tiên Sơn caves are located next to each other, there are no linking grottos between them.|$|E

30|$|Figure 1 a {{shows an}} atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM) image of the AlGaAs surface of a typical type I sample after Al LDE.

We have already observed this effect earlier for Ga LDE on AlGaAs at low temperatures [20]. On the other hand, type II samples have no such bimodal depth distribution and the resulting surfaces show only <b>deep</b> <b>holes</b> [24, 25]. Since the AlAs surfaces of type II samples oxidate very fast and, thus, are not accessible to AFM measurements under air, for illustration we provide a sample where Ga LDE has been performed on AlGaAs at T = 620 °C. The corresponding surface (Fig. 1 b) shows only <b>deep</b> <b>holes,</b> similar to the type II samples.|$|R

500|$|Drilling fluids {{are chosen}} {{to balance the}} {{pressure}} so that the hole remains stable. [...] The fluid must have a low kinematic viscosity to reduce tripping time (the time taken to pull the drilling equipment {{out of the hole}} and return it {{to the bottom of the}} hole). [...] Since retrieval of each segment of core requires tripping, a slower speed of travel through the drilling fluid could add significant time to a project—a year or more for a <b>deep</b> <b>hole.</b> [...] The fluid must contaminate the ice as little as possible; it must have low toxicity, for safety and to minimize the effect on the environment; it must be available at a reasonable cost; and it must be relatively easy to transport. [...] Historically, there have been three main types of ice drilling fluids: two-component fluids based on kerosene-like products mixed with fluorocarbons to increase density; alcohol compounds, including aqueous ethylene glycol and ethanol solutions; and esters, including n-butyl acetate. [...] Newer fluids have been proposed, including new ester-based fluids, low-molecular weight dimethyl siloxane oils, fatty-acid esters, and kerosene-based fluids mixed with foam-expansion agents.|$|E
