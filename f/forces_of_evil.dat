5|$|Waugh's {{health in}} the winter of 1953–54 was indifferent, and he was beset with various {{personal}} anxieties that were stifling his ability to work. He was also consuming alcohol, bromide and chloral in large amounts. In search of a peaceful environment in which he could resume writing, he embarked on a sea voyage to Ceylon, but was driven to the point of madness by imagined voices that assailed him throughout the voyage. These experiences are mirrored in the novel by those of Pinfold, a successful writer in the Waugh mould who, as an antidote to his lassitude and chronic insomnia, is dosing himself with a similar regimen of drugs. This cocktail brings about a series of hallucinatory episodes during a sea voyage taken by Pinfold {{for the sake of his}} health; he hears voices that insult, taunt and threaten him. He leaves the ship, but his unseen tormentors follow him. On his return to England, his wife convinces him that the voices were imaginary, and his doctor diagnoses poisoning from the bromide and chloral mixture. Pinfold, however, also views the episode as a private victory over the <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>evil.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{exploring}} Daybreak Town and defeating several Heartless, {{the player}} is approached by the Foreteller, who tells them that defeating weaker Heartless {{is possible to}} do alone, but they will need others help to defeat more powerful opponents. The Foreteller also describes how many others are collecting light as well, though some may secretly be doing so to gain power instead of fighting the darkness, and the player must decide who to trust. Chirithy then encourages the player to explore other worlds and help rid them of the Heartless {{before it is too}} late. The player then visits the illusion future visions of Disney worlds, where they interact with the locals and help defeat the hordes of Heartless. The player is brought to each world under Chirithy's direction, and together the two search for the origin of the darkness. As the player succeeds in defeating the <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>evil,</b> Chirithy begins to reveal the full extent of his knowledge regarding the war between light and darkness. Chirithy remembers being born in a place of light, with his creator smiling upon him in the beginning. The creator would later vanish, but before doing so he renamed six of his followers and gave five of them a prophecy of the future. The five, later known as the Foretellers, were shocked to discover that the future ended with a great battle in which the light would be defeated and the eternal reign of darkness would begin. To save the future, the Foretellers began to use the hidden powers within the written copy of the prophecy known as the Book of Prophecies (which creates the future worlds that the players travel to). Through this book, the Foretellers projected the future into their era to grow more powerful and save the light from final defeat. The power retrieved from the future is manifested as the Cards the player gathers to grow stronger.|$|E

50|$|Wiccan {{theology}} largely {{revolves around}} ontological dualism. Ontological dualism is traditionally a sacred gender polarity between the complementary polar opposites {{of male and}} female, who are regarded as divine lovers. This kind of dualism is common to various religions; for example, Taoism, where it is represented through yin and yang, and Hinduism, where the lingam and the yoni are symbols of the sacred sexual union of a supreme god and goddess (often Shiva and Shakti). Ontological dualism is distinct from moral dualism in that moral dualism posits a supreme <b>force</b> <b>of</b> good and a supreme <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>evil.</b> There is no supreme <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>evil</b> in Wicca.|$|R

25|$|The Bhagavata Purana {{has been}} the most popular and widely read Purana texts {{relating}} to Vishnu avatar Krishna, it has been translated and available in almost all Indian languages. Like other Puranas, it discusses a wide range of topics including cosmology, genealogy, geography, mythology, legend, music, dance, yoga and culture. As it begins, the <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>evil</b> have won a war between the benevolent devas (deities) and evil asuras (demons) and now rule the universe. Truth re-emerges as the Vishnu avatar first makes peace with the demons, understands them and then creatively defeats them, bringing back hope, justice, freedom and good – a cyclic theme that appears in many legends. The Bhagavata Purana is a revered text in Vaishnavism. The Puranic legends of Vishnu have inspired plays and dramatic arts that are acted out over festivals, particularly through performance arts such as the Sattriya, Manipuri dance, Odissi, Kuchipudi, Kathakali, Kathak, Bharatanatyam, Bhagavata Mela and Mohiniyattam.|$|E
25|$|The Bundahishn, a Zoroastrian {{account of}} {{creation}} {{completed in the}} 12th century has {{much to say about}} Ahriman and his role in the cosmogony. In chapter 1.23, following the recitation of the Ahuna Vairya, Ohrmuzd takes advantage of Ahriman's incapacity to create life without intervention. When Ahriman recovers, he creates Jeh, the primal whore who afflicts women with their menstrual cycles. In Bundahishn 4.12, Ahriman perceives that Ohrmuzd is superior to himself, and so flees to fashion his many demons with which to conquer the universe in battle. The entire universe is finally divided between the Ohrmuzd and the yazads on one side and Ahriman with his devs on the other. Ahriman slays the primal bull, but the moon rescues the seed of the dying creature, and from it springs all animal creation. But the battle goes on, with mankind caught in the middle, whose duty it remains to withstand the <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>evil</b> through good thoughts, words and deeds.|$|E

All of his friends have also become W employees, hoping to reform the organization from within under Angel's supervision. Angel's life this season is complicated by the increasingly blurred line between good and evil, the deaths of loved ones Cordelia and Fred (Amy Acker), and the possibility that the Shanshu prophecy may in fact be referring to Spike (who is now also a vampire with a soul) and not Angel. Allowing his friends to believe he is being corrupted, Angel secretly plots to bring down the Senior Partners of Wolfram & Hart by assassinating the Circle of the Black Thorn, the Partners' primary agents on Earth, even signing away his prophesied humanity in the process to convince them of his complex deception.

500|$|Featured as an {{antagonist}} {{in various}} Batman comics during the '90s, stories {{based on the}} character were highly thematic, political, and philosophical in tone. [...] The majority of the collected stories ("Anarky in Gotham City", [...] "Anarky: Tomorrow Belongs to Us", [...] "Anarky") {{are influenced by the}} philosophy of anarchism, while the final story ("Metamorphosis") is influenced by Frank R. Wallace. [...] Although anti-statism is the overarching theme of the collection, other concepts are explored. Anarky's characterization was expanded throughout the stories to present him first as a libertarian socialist and anarchist, and in the final story as a vehicle for explorations into atheism, rationalism, and bicameralism. Literary references are also utilized throughout the collected stories to stress the philosophical foundations of the character. The collection also tracks the character's evolution from a petty, street-crime fighting vigilante, to a competent freedom fighter in opposition to powerful <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>evil.</b>|$|E
