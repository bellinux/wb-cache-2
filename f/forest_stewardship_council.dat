5000|$|The {{basic premise}} of {{sustainability}} standards is twofold. Firstly, they emerged {{in areas where}} national and global legislation was weak but where the consumer and NGO movements around the globe demanded action. For example, campaigns by Global Exchange and other NGOs against the purchase of goods from “sweatshop” factories {{by the likes of}} Nike, Inc., Levi Strauss & Co. and other leading brands led to the emergence of social welfare standards like the SA8000 and others. Secondly, leading brands selling to both consumers and to the B2B supply chain may wish to demonstrate the environmental or organic merits of their products, which has led to the emergence of hundreds of ecolabels, organic and other standards. A leading example of a consumer standard is the Fairtrade movement, administered by FLO International and exhibiting huge sales growth around the world for ethically sourced produce. [...] An example of a B2B standard which has grown tremendously {{in the last few years}} is the <b>Forest</b> <b>Stewardship</b> <b>Council’s</b> standard (FSC) for forest products made from sustainable harvested trees.|$|R
40|$|The {{voluntary}} {{certification of}} forest products companies to ensure adherence to sustainable standards {{is a new}} development {{in the world of}} forestry. In North America {{there are a number of}} substantially different certification programs available to interested parties, each with its own costs and benefits. Among the many differences between certification programs, the structure and methods of verifying the supply chain – also called the chain of custody or simply COC – is an area where very different approaches have been applied and where the results are not completely understood. The scope of this study is limited to North American certification programs and includes a comparison between the origins, credibility and supply chain verification systems of the four leading certification programs widely implemented in North America: the Canadian Standards Association’s (CSA) Z 809 standard on Sustainable Forest Management; the American Forest and Pulp Association’s (AF&PA) Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI); the International Organization for Standardization’s (ISO) standard 14001 on Environmental Management Systems; as well as the <b>Forest</b> <b>Stewardship</b> <b>Council’s</b> (FSC) certification program.

25|$|Ink for {{the invitations}} was {{supplied}} by Chicago company BuzzInk, and the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies selected Precise Continental of Brooklyn, New York to print the invitations. Precise Continental {{was selected because}} it is a union company, uses recycled paper, and is <b>Forest</b> <b>Stewardship</b> <b>Council</b> certified. The printing technique for the invitations was engraving. The design was cut into the surface of a copper plate, which was then inked and inserted into a printing press with a sheet of paper. The result is a slightly raised impression {{on the front of the}} page and a slightly indented impression on the bottom. The first plate had to be scrapped because it was engraved without the President's middle initial. The golden seal was engraved in three printing runs. The first print laid down a rough-textured basic gold shape. The second run added smoothness and shine, and the final print run added the fine details to the seal. One million invitations were printed over 20 hours every day between December 11, 2008, and January 2, 2009, with employees working in two shifts and taking breaks only on Christmas Day and New Year's Day. The invitations were printed one at a time on 11×17 sheets of paper, which were then cut in half to 8½×11 sheets.|$|E

The trail is made of pebble-dash concrete walkways that swells and constricts, swings from side to side, and divides into concrete tines that meld the hardscape with the planting embedded in railroad gravel mulch. [...] "By opening the paving, we allow the plants to bleed through," [...] said landscape architect James Corner, [...] "almost as if the plants were colonizing the paved areas. There's a sort of blending or bleeding or suturing between the hard paving, the surface for people to stroll on, and the planting...." [...] Stretches of track and ties recall the High Line's former use. Portions of track are adaptively re-used for rolling lounges positioned for river views. The 120-species plant palette, curated by Dutch landscape architect Piet Oudolf, includes rugged meadow plants such as clump-forming grasses, liatris, and coneflowers, with scattered stands of sumac and smokebush, but not limited to American natives.

40|$|In Central Africa, finite contracts, weak local forest law, {{and poor}} {{monitoring}} erode incentives for firms to manage forests responsibly. In response, voluntary, independent certification of forest management practices {{has emerged as}} a policy tool. If firms choose to participate, in return for certified compliance with the standard they earn a price premium. Is voluntary forest certification effective at improving sustainable forest management? In this dissertation, I focus on <b>Forest</b> <b>Stewardship</b> <b>Council’s</b> <b>Forest</b> Management Certification (FSC) certification in Central Africa. I evaluate FSC effectiveness by investigating three questions. First, do FSC participants improve the environmental quality of their harvesting behavior? Second, does the net effect of FSC activities improve development outcomes for locals? And third, which forests participate in FSC and why? Do the highest priority forests participate? 	 To answer these questions, I use multiple data sets and identification strategies. The data range from primary data collected from Congolese households along a certified forest border to a national panel of timber outcomes in Cameroon to a regional biogeographical dataset spanning Gabon, Cameroon, and Congo. Across the three chapters, my dissertation finds FSC effectiveness to be compromised by three policy design features: a relative standard for harvesting practices, process indicators for a multidimensional standard, and voluntary selection into the policy...|$|R
40|$|This project {{evaluates the}} costs and {{benefits}} of the <b>Forest</b> <b>Stewardship</b> <b>Council’s</b> (FSC) <b>forest</b> certification for a large timber management organization (TIMO). FSC certification is a voluntary, market-based program that promotes sustainable forest management through third-party certification. The TIMO in this case study manages 3. 3 million acres of land certified under FSC, and this project evaluated both the direct and indirect costs and benefits of certification. This project was able to quantify the direct and indirect costs and benefits of forest certification through surveys, financial analyses and regression analyses. On average, forest certification is a net-positive program for the client, earning an estimated $ 771, 000 of additional annual revenue. Certification premiums paid for finished wood products are significantly higher than certification premiums for certified stumpage. Certified wood products receive an overall price premium of 10. 5 % while the premium for certified stumpage ranges from 1. 6 - 4. 3 %. Price premiums for finished wood products are considerably higher for domestic sales than for export sales. The domestic sale of finished wood products generates a statistically significant price premium of 30. 0 % as compared to the statistically significant but much lower premium for exported wood products of 3. 4 %. This project provides evidence that there are financial incentives for forestland owners to maintain forest certification. FSC has marketed both the ecological and financial benefits of maintaining forest certification. Previous studies of forest certification have generally concluded that the ecological benefits of forest certification are clear but that the desired financial benefits have not yet materialized. This project demonstrates that a large timberland owner can receive meaningful financial benefits from its forest certification program...|$|R
40|$|Biofuel {{policy has}} become highly {{contentious}} in Europe, originally {{driven by the}} Biofuels Directive (2003 / 30 /EC), which requires that “biofuels or other renewable fuels ” constitute 5. 75 % of the energy content of petrol and diesel sold for transport in member states by 2010, and now superseded by the Renewable Energy Directive. Here we discuss governance aspects of the environmental and social sustainability components of the expression of these directives in UK law via the 2008 UK Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO). We observe that commercial and energy security priorities have dominated the design of carbon and sustainability performance management under the RTFO. As an environmental management tool, the RTFO has been exceptionally weak, being a reporting standard rather than a performance or design standard. While it will be strengthened by the Renewable Energy Directive (RED), significant concerns remain {{in relation to the}} sourcing of biomass for energy.
