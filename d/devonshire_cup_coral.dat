2500|$|By {{the end of}} {{his tenure}} as {{governor}} general, Devonshire had overcome all of the initial suspicions that had surrounded his appointment; both men who served as his Canadian prime minister—Borden and Arthur Meighen—came to view him as a personal friend not only of theirs, but also of Canada's. The former said of Devonshire: [...] "No Governor General has come with a more comprehensive grasp of public questions as they touch not only this country and the United Kingdom, but the whole Empire." [...] The Duke left as a mark of his time in Canada the <b>Devonshire</b> <b>Cup,</b> for the annual golf competition of the Canadian Seniors Golf Association, and the Duke of Devonshire Trophy, for the Ottawa Horticultural Society. While in Canada, Devonshire's two aides-de-camp married his daughters.|$|R
50|$|Tank wrecks {{from the}} D-Day {{practice}} provide {{a venue for}} diving. Marine life includes the Devon <b>cup</b> <b>coral</b> (Caryophyllia smithii) and rare pink sea fan (Eunicella verrucosa). The reefs have been under threat from scallop dredging which, if unregulated, might destroy the coral's habitat. Devon Wildlife Trust has been campaigning to protect the reefs, calling {{for an end to}} the dredging and trawling within a 60 sq mi zone to help the reefs recover. About 20% of this area is now protected by a voluntary agreement made between the DEFRA and the fishermen of the South West Inshore Fishermen's Association.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- To help {{identify}} fishery management actions that minimize the adverse impacts of fishing activities on corals in Alaska, {{the distribution and}} abundance of corals were analyzed based on trawl survey data collected during 1975 - 1998. We also examined the species of commercially managed fish {{that are associated with}} coral. Soft corals, primarily Gersemia sp., were the most frequently encountered corals in the Bering Sea. In the Aleutian Islands gorgonian corals, primarily in the genera Callogorgia, Primnoa, Paragorgia, Fanellia (=Callogorgia), Thouarella, and Arthrogorgia were the most common corals. In the Gulf of Alaska, gorgonian corals, primarily in the genera Callogorgia and Primnoa, and <b>cup</b> <b>corals,</b> primarily AScleractini...|$|R
50|$|Leptopsammia pruvoti is {{a solitary}} stony coral and superficially resembles a sea anemone. The polyp {{sits in a}} {{calcareous}} cup, wider at the base than the top, which varies in shape from cylindrical and short to conical and long. It grows to a height of about 60 mm and a diameter of 20 mm. The polyp is yellow or orange with about ninety-six long, translucent yellow tentacles. It can retract back into the skeletal cup, so that the tentacles become barely visible. This species can be confused with another yellow or orange <b>cup</b> <b>coral,</b> Balanophyllia regia, but that species never grows so large and has fewer tentacles.|$|R
5000|$|Water {{movement}} {{is important in}} the reef aquarium with different types of coral requiring different flow rates. At present, many hobbyists advocate a water turnover rate of 10x: 10 x aquarium capacity in gallons = required flow in gallons per hour. This is a general rule with many exceptions. Some corals, such as mushroom corals and polyp corals, require very little flow to thrive. Conversely, large-polyp stony corals such as brain coral, bubble <b>coral,</b> elegance <b>coral,</b> <b>cup</b> <b>coral,</b> torch coral, and trumpet coral require moderate amounts of flow, and small polyp stony corals such as Acropora, Montipora, Porites, and Pocillopora require high, turbulent, conditions, which imitates breaking waves in shallow water near the tip of the reef. The directions which water pumps are pointed within an aquarium will have a large effect on flow speeds. Many corals will gradually move themselves to a different area of the tank if the water movement in its current area is not satisfactory. [...] "Since flow speed is the critical measure for determining the rate of gas exchange, turnover does little to convey how fast a coral will respire and photosynthesize." ...|$|R
