40|$|At the La Tapy Experimental Station {{in southeastern}} France, {{a plot of}} table grapes is managed {{according}} {{to the principles of}} organic farming in order to study potential technical impediments of this growing system compared to another plot that is managed according to the principles of sustainable agriculture. Muscat de Hambourg, the variety common to these two plots, is used as a reference for the different observations. Results are primarily related to the impact of pest management efficiency on vine quality. The qualitative requirement that powdery mildew be absent on table grapes is difficult to fulfil in the case of organic farming, even with several different treatments and frequent applications. Botrytis management is related to climatic conditions; disease prevention is therefore essential. Small populations of <b>grapeberry</b> moths (Lobesia botrana) and the absence of grape bud moths (Eupoecilia ambiguella) on those plots, as well as the efficacy of specific treatments, even in the context of biological control, using products containing Bacillus thuringiensis, led to either none or negligible damage on the two observed plots. Monitoring of grape leaf hopper populations (Empoasca vitis) revealed that there was no increase in the larva population. The stable level of auxiliaries on this plot partially explains the low incidence of Empoasca vitis...|$|E
40|$|Crimson Seedless' grapes (Vitis vinifera L.) do {{not develop}} {{adequate}} berry colour {{in different parts}} of theworld including Australia and USA leading to serious economic losses to the growers. In the present study, various anthocyanins and flavonols were identified in the skin of the 'Crimson Seedless' <b>grapeberries</b> using LC/PDA/ESI-MS and their changes in the berry skin during development and ripening of 'Crimson Seedless' grape berries were investigated during 2005 - 2006 and 2006 - 2007. Eleven anthocyanins and two flavonols were identified in the berry skin using LC/PDA/ESI-MS. Of the anthocyanins identified, four anthocyanins including cyanidin 3 -O-(600 -O-acetyl) -glucoside, peonidin 3 -O-(600 -O-acetyl) -glucoside, malvidin 3 -O-(600 -O-acetyl) -glucoside and malvidin 3 -O-(600 -O-coumaroyl) -glucoside were not reported earlier. During both the years, the concentration of the 3 -O-glucosides of delphinidin, petunidin, peonidin, and malvidin as well as the acetyl and coumaroyl esters of the 3 -Oglucosides of cyanidin, peonidin, and malvidin in the berry skin increased during berry development and ripening. During 2006 - 2007, the concentration of cyanidin 3 -O-glucoside in the berry skin increased during the early stages of berry ripening and subsequently declined till harvest while in 2005 - 2006, the concentration increased during the initial phase of berry ripening and remained relatively stable thereafter till harvest. The concentration of total anthocyanins in the berry skin was higher during 2006 - 2007 as compared to 2005 - 2006. During both years, the concentration of quercetin 3 -O-glucoside in the berry skin increased during berry development and ripening while the concentration of quercetin 3 -Oglucuronide in the berry skin decreased during the same period. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the evolution of different anthocyanins and flavonols in the 'Crimson Seedless' berry skin during berry development and ripening...|$|R
