What is less well-known is whether this gender difference persists into late life. This literature review examines whether the well-known gender <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> unipolar depression continues into old age, and, if it does, whether the variables that are known to contribute to the gender <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> unipolar depression from adolescence through adulthood continue to contribute to the gender <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the elderly, and/or whether there are new variables that arise in old age and contribute to the gender <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the elderly. In this review of 85 empirical studies from every continent except for Antarctica, we find substantial support for the gender <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> depression in individuals who are 60 and older. More research is necessary to determine which factors are the strongest predictors of the gender <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> depression in late life, and particularly whether the factors that seem to be responsible for the gender <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> depression in earlier life stages continue to predict the gender <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the elderly, and/or whether new factors come into play in late life. Longitudinal research, meta-analyses, and model-based investigations of predictors of the gender <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> depression are needed to provide insights into how and why the gender <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> depression persists in older age...|$|R

30|$|First {{branching}} of {{the conditional}} inference tree was achieved through confirmation {{of whether the}} <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> average value of photographic density exceeded 54.49. In cases exceeding this value, second branching was achieved through confirmation of whether the <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> minimum value of photographic density exceeded 31.

In cases with the <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> min value below 31, 85.7 % (n[*]=[*] 6) were proved to be normal and 14.3 % (n[*]=[*] 1) had osteomyelitis. At the first branching, when the <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> average value was below 54.49, second branching was achieved through confirmation whether the <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> min value exceeds 39. Among cases with <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> min value below 39, 98.7 % (n[*]=[*] 77) were normal and 1.3 % (n[*]=[*] 1) were osteomyelitis.

5|$|In 1910, Eaton {{became the}} first {{scientist}} to publish a more {{detailed description of the}} entire Pteranodon skeleton, as it was known at the time.

Eaton conducted experiments using clay models of bones to help determine the effects of crushing and flattening on the shapes of the arm bones Williston had used in his own classification. Eaton found that most of the <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> bone shapes could be easily explained by the pressures of fossilization, and concluded that no Pteranodon skeletons had any significant differences from each other besides their size. Therefore, Eaton was left to decide his classification scheme based on <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> the skulls alone, which he assigned to species just as Marsh did, by their size. In the end, Eaton recognized only three valid species: P. occidentalis, P. ingens, and P. longiceps.|$|E

Two control groups composed of random samples of the university student population reponded to the Self-Cathexis Scale Body-Cathexis Scale: one group responded to the pre-test one group responded to the post-test. Test administrations were separated by a six to seven wee!: interval, An ANOVA groups x trial and subjects x trials design indicated that: (a) no significant <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> pre-test mean scores of self-cathexls or body-catheix existed. among the groups; (b) no significant <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> post-test can scores of sefcatnexis or body-cathoxls existed among the experimental groups; (c) no significant <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> post-test mean self-cathexis scores existed among the experimental groups and the control group; (d) no significantt <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> post-test mean cores existed among the backpacking-orienteering, mountaineering, and control groups; (e) a significant difference post test mean body-cathexis scores existed between the scuba diving group and the control group; and (f) no significant difference Existed between the pre- and post-test measures of self-cathexis or body-cathexis {{of any of the}} groups.
