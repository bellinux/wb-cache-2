2500|$|In 1932, British {{announced}} {{the formation of}} a separate electorate for [...] "Depressed Classes" [...] in the Communal Award. Gandhi fiercely opposed a separate electorate for untouchables, saying he feared that such an arrangement would divide the Hindu community. Gandhi protested by fasting while imprisoned in the Yerwada Central Jail of Poona. Following the fast, Congress politicians and activists such as Madan Mohan Malaviya and Palwankar Baloo organised joint meetings with Ambedkar and his supporters at Yerwada. On 25 September 1932, the agreement known as Poona Pact was signed between Ambedkar (on behalf of the depressed classes among Hindus) and Madan Mohan Malaviya (on behalf of the other Hindus). The agreement gave reserved seats for the depressed classes in the Provisional legislatures, within the general electorate. Due to the pact, the <b>depressed</b> <b>class</b> received 148 seats in the legislature, instead of the 71 as allocated in the Communal Award earlier proposed by British [...] Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald. The text uses the term [...] "Depressed Classes" [...] to denote Untouchables among Hindus who were later called Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes under India Act 1935, and the later Indian Constitution of 1950. [...] In the Poona Pact, a unified electorate was in principle formed, but primary and secondary elections allowed Untouchables in practice to choose their own candidates.|$|E
60|$|Blinking old {{men who are}} let out of workhouses by the hour, have a {{tendency}} to sit on bits of coping stone in these churchyards, leaning with both hands on their sticks and asthmatically gasping. The more <b>depressed</b> <b>class</b> of beggars too, bring hither broken meats, and munch. I am on nodding terms with a meditative turncock who lingers in one of them, and whom I suspect of a turn for poetry; the rather, as he looks out of temper when he gives the fire-plug a disparaging wrench with that large tuning-fork of his which would wear out the shoulder of his coat, but for a precautionary piece of inlaid leather. Fire-ladders, which I am satisfied nobody knows anything about, and the keys of which were lost in ancient times, moulder away in the larger churchyards, under eaves like wooden eyebrows; and so removed are those corners from the haunts of men and boys, that once on a fifth of November I found a 'Guy' trusted to take care of himself there, while his proprietors had gone to dinner. Of the expression of his face I cannot report, because it was turned to the wall; but his shrugged shoulders and his ten extended fingers, appeared to denote that he had moralised in his little straw chair on the mystery of mortality until he gave it up as a bad job.|$|E

While initially, Gopalan and Mala {{were in love with}} each other, {{eventually}} Gopalan fell in love with Suman, the upper caste daughter of VV Kesavan Nair. By the end of the play, Nair is left in a helpless condition as his own blood {{fell in love with a}} class he was exploiting and sympathised with them. Furthermore, Paramupilla, Gopalan's father, who was initially against the CPI, joins Mala and the members of the same party. The drama ends with Paramupilla taking the red flag from Mala symbolizing his change of heart.The counter-drama also contains the same characters and 9 scenes as opposed to 14 in the original drama. The opening scene shows the red flag and deals with the failure of the war waged by Mala and the other members. This introductory scene ends with the entry to a character playing Thoppil Bhasi who says that he has come to see the real condition of Mala. The counter-drama then continues and contains many scenes that have been copied from the drama. However, all of these scenes were followed by commentary criticizing the play and had been authored by Defendant no. 1. Furthermore, the stage was divided into two parts- the upper platform and the lower platform. The scenes copied from the drama were enacted on the upper platform, whereas he criticism of it was enacted on the lower platform.The plaintiffs alleged that the counter-drama had infringed upon their copyright in the drama and filed a suit against the defendants. They also prayed for an interlocutory order restraining the staging of the counter-drama. The Additional District Judge who was hearing the suit granted the interlocutory injunction in favour of the plaintiff. The defendants then appealed to the Kerala High Court and beseeched it to set aside the order restraining them from staging the play. This appeal was disposed off by the Kerala High Court in the instant case.|$|E
