40|$|Abstract. The Sun has a {{tremendous}} influence on the Earth’s upper atmosphere. It {{is not only a}} source of ionizing radiation but also produces severe disturbances like geomagnetic storms. The 11 -year cycle in the variation of behavior and energy output of the Sun influences the generation of equatorial F-region irregularities, which produce scintillations of satellite signals. The phenomenon of scintillations particularly in the L-band has received considerable attention in recent years because of its detrimental effects on communication and navigational systems like GPS. Amplitude scintillations induce signal fading and when the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>fading</b> exceeds the fade margin of a receiving system, message errors in satellite communication systems are introduced. In GPS, amplitude scintillation may cause degradation of position fixing by standalone GPS receivers, data loss and cycle slips. Severe phase scintillations may stress phase-locked loops in GPS receivers and give rise to loss of phase lock. Scintillation is not a transient phenomenon like the geomagnetic storms but is prevalent mostly during magnetically quiet periods in the pre-midnight hours of equinoctial months of high sunspot number years for a station like Calcutta located near the northern crest of the equatorial anomaly. Amplitude scintillations at L-band (1. 5 GHz) and VHF (244 MHz) have been recorded at Calcutta (22. 58 oN, 88. 38 oE geographic; 32 oN magnetic dip) for more than a solar cycle from geostationary satellites INMARSAT and FLEETSATCOM respectively. The signal-to-noise ratios of GPS L 1 (1575. 42 MHz) have also been recorded at the same station since 1994. This paper presents a study of L-band scintillations for nearly half a solar cycle (1996 - 2000) from Calcutta, which is located under the northern anomaly crest in the Indian longitude sector.

40|$|At Ancon, Peru, {{simultaneous}} {{observations of}} 1550 -MHz and 136 -MHz {{signals from the}} ATS 5 and Intelsat- 1 spacecraft showed ionospheric fading as great as 27 db at 136 MHz and 6 db at 1550 MHZ.

Comparison of the two frequencies, in respect to rates and <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>fades,</b> is made. Statistical distributions of the received signal levels during ionospheric scintillation occurrences are presented which may be of use to communications system engineers with operational requirements in the equatorial regions. The distributions show that during expected periods of scintillation, the L band signal typically falls 1. 1 db below the median for 1. 0 percent of the time, and the VHF signal falls 11. 5 db below the median for 1. 0 percent of the time...|$|R
40|$|Received / {{accepted}} Abstract. We {{discovered that}} the WR 9 -type star WR 106 (HDE 313643) underwent a deep episodic fading in 2000. The <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fading</b> (∆V ∼ 2. 9 mag) surpassed those of all known similar “eclipse-like ” fadings in WR stars. This fading episode {{was likely to be}} produced by a line-of-sight episodic dust formation rather than a periodic enhancement of dust production in the WR-star wind during the passage of the companion star though an elliptical orbit. The overall 2000 episode was composed of at least two distinct fadings. These individual fadings seem to more support that the initial dust formation triggered a second dust formation, or that the two independent dust formations occurred by the same triggering mechanism rather than a stepwise dust formation. We also discuss on phenomenological similarity <b>of</b> the present <b>fading</b> with the double <b>fading</b> <b>of</b> R CrB observed in 1999 – 2000...|$|R

40|$|Within {{the frame}} of the FASOLT project the German Aerospace Center (DLR) {{performed}} channel measurements and optical data transmission tests on a 61 km near ground horizontal path. The transmitter was situated on a mountain top in the German Alps with the receiver placed on top of a building at the DLR site in Oberpfaffenhofen. Partners in the FASOLT project were Contraves Space, Switzerland and EADS Military Aircraft, Germany. During a period of several months various data sets of scintillation data were recorded in one and two laterally separated transmitter configurations and under different environmental conditions. A significant decrease <b>of</b> number and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>fades</b> was observed for the two transmitter setup. This paper presents an overview on the scintillation statistics of this particular optical channel. Also beam offsets due to refraction have been measured and results are presented here. As well as these measurements, data transmission tests at bit rates of 100 Mbps have been performed. A two transmitter configuration with a transmit power of 1 W per laser and a sensitive APD receiver front-end plugged in to a 75 mm Rx telescope have been used. Despite severe scintillations, bit error rates (BER) below 1 e- 4 could be observed, though synchronization losses of the data and clock recovery affected the results. Tests at 155 Mbps (OC- 3) and 270 Mbps (SMPTE 259 M) were not successful due to high atmospheric attenuation. This paper gives an overview of the entire experimental setup, sums up the results of this long-haul data transmission experiment, and gives an outlook to further DLR activities in the field of free-space optics...|$|R
50|$|The ore {{deposits}} in Montana were of very rich, but <b>of</b> very limited <b>depth.</b> Two factors {{contributed to this}} particular formation of the ores. The first of these factors were ascending hot waters traveling through fissures in the rocks and dropping their silver in chemically favorable zones. The second of these were descending cold waters trickling down the fissure veins, and moving and re-depositing the silver to further enrich the veins near the water table. These mines {{would prove to be}} extremely prosperous for a time, but due to the lack <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> would <b>fade</b> drastically as simply weren’t any high-grade silver zones below 1,000 feet.|$|R

40|$|For {{several years}} the flashlamp-pumped pulsed dye laser (FPDL) {{has been the}} favoured method for the {{treatment}} of port-wine stains (PWS). The therapeutic outcome of FPDL laser therapy depends on the anatomical location of the PWS and is mainly attributed to morphological parameters such as size and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the PWS blood vessels. The aim {{of this study was to}} show a correlation between the therapeutic outcome following FPDL therapy and the optical properties of the skin overlying the PWS vessels. For this purpose the therapeutic outcome following FPDL treatment (585 nm; 0. 45 ms) of 884 PWS situated on different body sites was evaluated by judging the grade <b>of</b> <b>fading</b> <b>of</b> PWS colour. On the other hand the light penetration into 123 skin samples (thickness 0. 10 – 1. 35 mm) was determined between 450 nm and 1030 nm and compared with the PWS laser therapy outcome for equal locations by statistical analysis. PWS on the neck, trunk, arms or legs yielded a higher mean grade <b>of</b> <b>fading</b> as compared to PWS on the head. Within the face, a wide range <b>of</b> <b>fading</b> was evident. The light penetration into skin increased linearly with increasing wavelength and locationdependent differences were found. The attenuation coefficient was 22. 8 - 5. 3 mm$^{- 1 }$ at 585 nm. No significant or strong correlation was observed between the therapeutic outcome of PWS laser therapy and the light penetration into skin. However, a correlation was obvious by plotting the respective profile plots. Therefore, among other effects, in particular morphological parameters of PWS vessels, the optical properties of the skin contribute to a small extent to the clinical outcome of PWS laser therapy...|$|R

The data were obtained with the Multicolor Simultaneous Camera for studying Atmospheres of Transiting exoplanets (MuSCAT) on the 188 cm telescope at Okayama Astrophysical Observatory in Japan. We observed the fading event in the g^'_ 2 -, r^'_ 2 -, and z_ s, 2 -bands simultaneously. As a result, we find a significant wavelength dependence <b>of</b> <b>fading</b> <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> about 3. 1 %, 1. 7 %, 1. 0 % for the g^'_ 2 -, r^'_ 2 -, and z_ s, 2 -bands, respectively.
