500|$|Henry scored {{his first}} hat-trick in Europe for Arsenal against Roma on 27 November 2002 with the player stating; [...] "It's {{wonderful}} {{to score a}} hat-trick but it's even more important that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> in a game we've won." [...] The result was followed with four consecutive draws – three at home against Roma, Valencia and Ajax. Arsenal only needed a draw to progress into the knockout stages, but lost 2–1 to Valencia at the Mestalla on 19 March 2003. Reflecting later on the Champions League campaign, Wenger commented that [...] "we lost our qualification at home".|$|E
500|$|As {{with the}} first two films in the series, many people were {{involved}} in writing the film. Richard Matheson, who had written the script for Steven Spielberg's celebrated 1971 television film Duel, says that he wrote a [...] "very interesting" [...] outline, although the story is credited to [...] "some other writer". Universal forced Matheson to include Brody's two sons, which the writer [...] "thought was dumb". They also {{wanted it to be}} the same shark that was electrocuted in Jaws 2. Matheson was also requested to write a custom-role for Mickey Rooney, [...] "which <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> successfully that when Mickey Rooney {{turned out not to be}} available, the whole part was pointless". The writer was unhappy with the finished film.|$|E
500|$|Breaking {{from the}} theme of the natural {{environment}} after humans, Weisman considers what could lead to the sudden, complete demise of humans without serious damage to the built and natural environment. That scenario, he concludes, is extremely unlikely. He also considers transhumanism, the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement, the Church of Euthanasia and John A. Leslie's The End of the World: the Science and Ethics of Human Extinction. Weisman concludes the book considering {{a new version of the}} one-child policy. While he admits it is a [...] "draconian measure", he states, [...] "The bottom line is that any species that overstretches its resource base suffers a population crash. Limiting our reproduction would be damn hard, but limiting our consumptive instincts may be even harder." [...] He responded to criticism of this saying [...] "I knew in advance that I would touch some people's sensitive spots by bringing up the population issue, but <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> because it's been missing too long from the discussion of how we must deal with the situation our economic and demographic growth have driven us too (sic)".|$|E

500|$|In the 2001–02 season, Arsenal {{played in}} the Champions League. The club {{qualified}} for the second group stage on goal difference but did not reach the quarter-finals, losing their final two matches against Deportivo La Coruña and Juventus. Having won the domestic league {{for the first time}} in four years, Wenger revealed the club's and his own intent to win the Champions League, telling French newspaper L'Equipe [...] "I can't imagine finishing my life without winning the European Cup". Arsenal began the following season impressively, winning 0–4 at PSV Eindhoven. The match set a new club record, as midfielder Gilberto Silva scored the fastest goal, in 20.07 seconds. Although Arsenal lost their last two matches against Borussia Dortmund and Auxerre, coinciding with a blip in form domestically, they qualified for the second group stage for the third consecutive season. Striker Thierry Henry scored his first hat-trick in Europe for Arsenal against Roma on 27 November 2002 with the player stating; [...] "It's wonderful to score a hat-trick but it's even more important that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> in a game we've won." [...] Arsenal failed to replicate their form at Roma, drawing their next four matches and losing to Valencia in the final match to finish third in their group and thus, out of the competition.|$|E
500|$|The {{severity}} of the destructive acts by Union troops was significantly greater in South Carolina than in Georgia or North Carolina. This {{appears to have been}} a consequence of the animosity among both Union soldiers and officers to the state that they regarded as the [...] "cockpit of secession". One of the most serious accusations against Sherman was that he allowed his troops to burn the city of Columbia. In 1867, Gen. O. O. Howard, commander of Sherman's 15th Corps, reportedly said, [...] "It is useless to deny that our troops burnt Columbia, for I saw them in the act." [...] However, Sherman himself stated that [...] "f I had made up my mind to burn Columbia I would have burnt it with no more feeling than I would a common prairie dog village; but I did not do it ..." [...] Sherman's official report on the burning placed the blame on Confederate Lt. Gen. Wade Hampton III, who Sherman said had ordered the burning of cotton in the streets. In his memoirs, Sherman said, [...] "In my official report of this conflagration I distinctly charged it to General Wade Hampton, and confess <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> pointedly to shake the faith of his people in him, for he was in my opinion a braggart and professed to be the special champion of South Carolina."

500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} in Vancouver, British Columbia in April 2009, and lasted for approximately 67 days. Many filming locations were established in Downtown Vancouver and its surroundings. Stage shooting for the film {{took place at the}} Canadian Motion Picture Park studio in Burnaby, an adjacent city that forms part of Metro Vancouver. Kosinski devised and constructed twelve to fifteen of the film's sets, including Kevin Flynn's safe house, a creation he illustrated on a napkin for a visual effects test. [...] "I wanted to build as much as possible. It was important to me that this world feel real, and anytime I could build something <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> <b>So</b> I hired guys that I went to architecture school with to work on the sets for this film, and hopefully people who watch the film feel like there’s a certain physicality to this world that hopefully they appreciate, knowing that real architects actually put this whole thing together." [...] The film was shot in dual camera 3D using Pace Fusion rigs like James Cameron's Avatar, but unlike the Sony F950 cameras on that film, Tron used the F35s. [...] "The benefit of ," [...] according to director Kosinski, [...] "is that it has a full 35mm sensor which gives you that beautiful cinematic shallow depth of field." [...] The film's beginning portions were shot in 2D, while forty minutes of the film were vertically enhanced for IMAX. Digital Domain was contracted to work on the visual effects, while companies such as Prime Focus Group, DD Vancouver, and Mr. X were brought on to collaborate with producer on the post-production junctures of Tron: Legacy. Post-production wrapped on November 25, 2010.|$|E

The judge asked Lindh to say, in his own words, what he was admitting to: [...] "I plead guilty. I provided my services as a soldier to the Taliban last year from about August to December. In the course of doing so, I carried a rifle and two grenades. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> knowingly and willingly knowing that it was illegal." [...] Lindh said that he [...] "went to Afghanistan {{with the intention of}} fighting against terrorism and oppression," [...] fighting for the suffering of ordinary people {{at the hands of the}} Northern Alliance.

I'm afraid I can neither spread Wu's fame as well as Zhang Zhao did, nor make decisions as well as Zichan.

2500|$|In January 2007, {{during the}} first week of Scooter Libby's trial, it was {{revealed}} in court proceedings that former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer was granted immunity from prosecution by Patrick Fitzgerald in February 2004. Fleischer reportedly acknowledged discussing Valerie Plame with reporters, but promised to cooperate with Fitzgerald's investigation only if granted immunity. When the deal was struck, Fleischer told Fitzgerald that he had discussed Plame with David Gregory of NBC News and John Dickerson of Time in July 2003, days before leaving his job at the White House. Fleischer testified that he first learned about Plame and her CIA affiliation during a July 7, 2003, lunch with Libby. Fleischer also testified that four days later, while aboard Air Force One and during a five-day trip to several African nations, he overheard Dan Bartlett reference Plame. According to Fleischer, Bartlett stated to no one in particular [...] "His wife sent him...She works at the CIA." [...] Shortly after overhearing Bartlett, Fleischer proceeded to discuss Plame with Gregory and Dickerson. According to Fleischer, neither Gregory nor Dickerson showed much interest in the information. Dickerson has denied Fleischer's account. Gregory has declined to comment on the matter. With regard to the immunity deal, Fitzgerald told the court [...] "I didn't want to give [...] immunity. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> reluctantly." [...] Libby's attorney, William Jeffress, sought to learn more about the deal, telling the court [...] "I'm not sure we're getting the full story here." [...] According to Matt Apuzzo of the Associated Press, [...] "Prosecutors normally insist on an informal account of what a witness will say before agreeing to such a deal. It's known in legal circles as a proffer, and Fitzgerald said [...] he never got one from Fleischer." ...|$|E
