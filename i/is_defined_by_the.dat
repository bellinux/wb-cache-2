The starting order for Training <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> results of the last year's Red Bull Air Race World Championship standings. The highest ranking pilot starts first. Starting order for new race pilots is determined by a draw. The starting order for Qualifying <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> results of the fourth training session. The order is reversed so that the slowest pilot from the fourth training session starts first. The starting order for all sessions on Race Day is determined by the results in Qualifying.

5|$|The {{period of}} Daylight Saving Time before the longest day is {{shorter than the}} period after, in several {{countries}} including the United States and Europe. This unequal split is an energy saving measure. For example, in the U.S. the period of Daylight Saving Time <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Energy Policy Act of 2005. The period for Daylight Saving Time was extended by changing the start date from the first Sunday of April to the second Sunday of March, and the end date from the last Sunday in October to the first Sunday in November.|$|E

5|$|Clarinets {{have the}} largest pitch range of common woodwinds. The {{intricate}} key organization that makes this possible can make the playability of some passages awkward. The bottom of the clarinet's written range <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> keywork on each instrument, standard keywork schemes allowing a low E on the common B clarinet. The lowest concert pitch depends on the transposition of the instrument in question. The nominal highest note of the B clarinet is a semitone higher than the highest note of the oboe. Since the clarinet has {{a wider range of}} notes, the lowest note of the B clarinet is significantly deeper (a minor or major sixth) than the lowest note of the oboe.|$|E
5|$|Croatia's county prefects, {{city and}} town mayors are elected to {{four-year}} terms {{by a majority}} of votes cast within applicable local government units, with a runoff election if no candidate achieves a majority {{in the first round of}} voting. Members of county, city and municipal councils are elected to four-year terms through proportional representation, with the entire local government unit as a single constituency. The number of council members <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> councils themselves, based on applicable legislation. Electoral committees are tasked with determining whether the national minorities are represented in the council (as required by the constitution), adding further members to the council (who belong to the appropriate minorities) by selecting them from unelected-candidate lists. Election silence, as in all other elections in Croatia, is enforced on the day of the elections and the previous day, ending at 7:00pm when the polling stations close and exit polls may be announced.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Ka, {{which is a}} measure of how much energy is needed to stretch the bilayer, Kb {{is a measure of}} how much energy is needed to bend or flex the bilayer. Formally, bending modulus is defined as the energy required to deform a membrane from its intrinsic curvature to some other curvature. Intrinsic curvature <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ratio of the diameter of the head group to that of the tail group. For two-tailed PC lipids, this ratio is nearly one so the intrinsic curvature is nearly zero. If a particular lipid has too large a deviation from zero intrinsic curvature it will not form a bilayer and will instead form other phases such as micelles or inverted micelles. Addition of small hydrophilic molecules like sucrose into mixed lipid lamellar liposomes made from galactolipid-rich thylakoid membranes destabilises bilayers into micellar phase. Typically, Kb is not measured experimentally but rather is calculated from measurements of Ka and bilayer thickness, since the three parameters are related.|$|E

5|$|One aetosaur, Typothorax coccinarum, {{has been}} used to define the Revueltian land {{vertebrate}} faunachron. A land vertebrate faunachron (LVF) is a time interval that <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> first appearance datum (FAD), or first occurrence, of a tetrapod index fossil and is commonly used to date Late Triassic and Early Jurassic terrestrial strata. Since the FAD of T. coccinarum is {{at the beginning of the}} Norian stage, the Revueltian LVF starts at the beginning of the Norian around 216 million years ago. The Revueltian ends with the next FAD, which happens to be that of the phytosaur Redondasaurus and the start of the Apachean LVF.|$|E
5|$|The Edmontonian land {{vertebrate}} age <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{first appearance}} of Edmontosaurus regalis in the fossil record. Although sometimes reported as of exclusively early Maastrichtian age, the Horseshoe Canyon Formation was of somewhat longer duration. Deposition began approximately 73million years ago, {{in the late}} Campanian, and ended between 68.0 and 67.6million years ago. Edmontosaurus regalis is known from the lowest of five units within the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, but is absent from at least the second to the top. As many as {{three quarters of the}} dinosaur specimens from badlands near Drumheller, Alberta may pertain to Edmontosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The General Theory {{argues that}} demand, not supply, {{is the key}} {{variable}} governing the overall level of economic activity. Aggregate demand, which equals total un-hoarded income in a society, <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sum of consumption and investment. In a state of unemployment and unused production capacity, one can only enhance employment and total income by first increasing expenditures for either consumption or investment. Without government intervention to increase expenditure, an economy can remain trapped in a low employment equilibrium – the demonstration of this possibility {{has been described as}} the revolutionary formal achievement of the work.|$|E

Although the President acts in her {{personal}} discretion in the exercise of certain functions as a check on the Cabinet and Parliament of Singapore, her role is largely ceremonial. It is the Cabinet, composed of the Prime Minister and other Ministers appointed on his advice by the President, that generally directs and controls the Government. The Cabinet is formed by the political party that gains a simple majority in each general election.|$|E

5|$|The law {{governing}} aviation in the UK <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Civil Aviation Act 1982, {{which is}} updated periodically with amendments, the latest being the Civil Aviation Act 2006. The government {{department responsible for}} legislating changes in national policy and long term strategy relating to aviation is the Department for Transport (DfT). At the operational level the independently run Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) regulates economic, safety, and consumer protection aspects, as well as airspace policy, although these responsibilities are being increasingly ceded to the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). International aspects of air transport are regulated by agreements made within the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) as established by the Chicago Convention, whilst most new legislation is now made at the European level through the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC). As a consequence, other than in airport development, there are few aspects of the air transport industry {{in which the government}} can act in isolation.|$|E

5|$|The Žirmūnai {{elderate}} occupies 5.7km² or 1.4% of {{the total}} area of the municipality of Vilnius according to data used for the 2001 census. Žirmūnai is located north of central Vilnius, along the western bank of the River Neris, on a flat plain which rises to the north. The elderate extends for about 4.4kilometres from north to south, and is about 1.5kilometres across at its widest point. The southernmost point of the Žirmūnai elderate is only some 450metres from Vilnius' Cathedral Square, in {{the centre of the}} city. Žirmūnai is bordered by the elderates of Verkiai in the north and Šnipiškės in the west, and is separated from Vilnius' Old Town and Antakalnis by the Neris. Žirmūnai's western boundary <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> following streets (from north to south): Verkių, Žvalgų, Kalvarijų, Žalgirio, and Rinktinės. The River Neris serves as Žirmūnai's northern, eastern and southern boundary. Žirmūnų Street is the district's main artery.|$|E
5|$|US195 <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Washington State Legislature as SR195, {{part of the}} Revised Code of Washington as §. Every year, WSDOT {{conducts a}} series of surveys on its {{highways}} {{in the state to}} measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of AADT, which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2012, WSDOT calculated that the busiest section of US195 within Washington was in Hangman Valley before the I-90 interchange in Spokane, serving 19,000 vehicles, while the least busiest section was between Pullman and Colfax, serving 3,100 vehicles. The entire route of US195 is designated as a Highway of Statewide Significance by WSDOT, which includes highways that connect major communities in the state of Washington.|$|E
5|$|A linear {{chain of}} amino acid {{residues}} {{is called a}} polypeptide. A protein contains at least one long polypeptide. Short polypeptides, containing less than 20–30 residues, are rarely considered to be proteins and are commonly called peptides, or sometimes oligopeptides. The individual amino acid residues are bonded together by peptide bonds and adjacent amino acid residues. The sequence of amino acid residues in a protein <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sequence of a gene, which is encoded in the genetic code. In general, the genetic code specifies 20 standard amino acids; however, in certain organisms the genetic code can include selenocysteine and—in certain archaea—pyrrolysine. Shortly after or even during synthesis, the residues in a protein are often chemically modified by post-translational modification, which alters the physical and chemical properties, folding, stability, activity, and ultimately, {{the function of the}} proteins. Sometimes proteins have non-peptide groups attached, which can be called prosthetic groups or cofactors. Proteins can also work together to achieve a particular function, and they often associate to form stable protein complexes.|$|E
