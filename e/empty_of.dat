40|$|Gastric <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> liquids and solids was {{evaluated}} in ten dogs with gastric fistula {{before and after}} either truncal vagotomy, antrectomy, or pyloroplasty. In subsequent operations, the vagotomy group underwent either antrectomy or pyloroplasty, and the antrectomy and pyloroplasty groups were vagotomized. Vagotomy significantly inhibited the <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> both liquids and solids (p less than 0. 001) when the pyloric antrum was intact.

5|$|Native Americans {{were present}} in lower Florida 10,000years ago, when ocean levels were low and Biscayne Bay was {{comparatively}} <b>empty</b> <b>of</b> water. Water levels rose from about 4000years ago and inundated the bay. Archeologists believe that any traces left by the peoples of that era are now submerged; none now exist on dry lands in the park. The Cutler Fossil Site, just {{to the west of}} the park, has yielded evidence of human occupation extending to at least 10000years before the present. The earliest evidence of human presence in Biscayne dates to about 2500years before the present, with piles of conch and whelk shells left by the Glades culture. The Glades culture was followed by the Tequesta people, who occupied the shores of Biscayne Bay. The Tequesta were a sedentary community living on fish and other sea life, with no significant agricultural activity. A site on Sands Key has yielded potsherds, worked shells and other artifacts indicating occupation from at latest 1000AD to about 1650, after contact was made with Europeans. A total of fifty significant archaeological sites have been identified in the park.|$|E
5|$|On 11 February 1943, Yamato was {{replaced}} by her sister ship Musashi as flagship of the Combined Fleet. The battleship spent only a single day away from Truk between her arrival in August 1942 and her departure on 8 May 1943. On that day, she set sail for Yokosuka and from there for Kure, arriving on 14 May. She spent nine days in dry dock for inspection and general repairs, and after sailing to Japan's western Inland Sea she was again dry-docked in late July for significant refitting and upgrades. On 16 August, Yamato began her return to Truk, where she joined a large task force formed in response to American raids on the Tarawa and Makin atolls. She sortied in late September with Nagato, three carriers, and smaller warships to intercept US Task Force 15, and again a month later with six battleships, three carriers, and eleven cruisers. Intelligence had reported that the United States Naval Base at Pearl Harbor was nearly <b>empty</b> <b>of</b> ships, which the Japanese interpreted to mean that an American naval force would strike at Wake Island. But there were no radar contacts for six days, and the fleet returned to Truk, arriving on 26 October.|$|E
40|$|The {{role of the}} {{proximal}} and distal stomach in the <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> solids and liquids from the stomach remains unclear. We have used a dual isotope technique to quantify proximal and distal stomach <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> a solid (100 g of 99 mTc labelled liver/ground beef) liquid (either 200 ml of normal saline (eight subjects) or 25 % dextrose (seven subjects) labelled with 113 mIn-diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid) mixed meal. A manometric catheter simultaneously measured antral, pyloric, and duodenal motor activity. The liquid component dispersed rapidly throughout the stomach and emptied after a minimal lag period. The <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> the 25 % dextrose was delayed compared with the saline. This delay was associated with increased retention of the liquid in the distal stomach, {{a significant increase in}} localised phasic pyloric contractions, and a suppression of antral contractions. The solid component initially resided wholly within a proximal stomach reservoir area. Solids then redistributed from proximal to distal stomach during the <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> liquid from the stomach. Dextrose delayed gastric <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> solids compared with saline by increasing the solid lag period and retention in {{the proximal}} stomach. There {{was no significant difference between}} saline and dextrose meals in the distal stomach retention of solid or in the linear rate <b>of</b> <b>emptying</b> after the lag period. We conclude that, contrary to general opinion, the proximal stomach plays an important role in the control <b>of</b> gastric <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> solids while the distal stomach is important in the <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> nutrient liquids...|$|R
40|$|Gastric <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> {{liquid and}} solid meals was studied {{before and after}} {{operation}} in 22 male patients who were admitted to a prospective randomized trial of truncal vagotomy and antrectomy and proximal gastric vagotomy {{in the treatment of}} duodenal ulceration. After operation the <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> both solid and liquid meals was biphasic, with a passive early phase and a later controlled active phase. A significant increase in early liquid emptying was produced by both operations, and after truncal vagotomy and antrectomy also with the solid meal. Active <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> the liquid meals was unaffected by either operation, but both operations significantly prolonged the active <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> the solid meals. The clinical symptoms of dumping were related to rapid early liquid emptying (cascading) and those of gastric retention were related to delayed active <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> the solid meal. These findings explain how the same operation can produce the opposing symptom complexes of dumping and gastric retention and how both sets of symptoms can occur in the same individual...|$|R
40|$|The gastric <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> maltose, sucrose, lactose and {{lactulose}} {{was compared}} in young adult rats with ontogenic lactase deficiency. Eight animals were employed for each sugar meal at each time of study (total {{number of animals}} = 192). Each animal received a test meal consisting of a solution of the sugar (100 mg/ml) and phenol red as marker and gastric retention was measured at 5, 10, 20, 30, 45 and 60 min after orogastric infusion of the test meal. Gastric retention was determined by measuring the concentration of the marker in the residual test meal recovered from the stomach after killing the animal. There {{was no difference between}} the gastric <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> lactose and lactulose. The gastric <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> maltose was significantly slower during the initial 30 min and the <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> sucrose was identical to that of maltose only at 5 min and could not be distinguished from that of lactose and lactulose at later times. These data support the observation, made in human subjects, that, under conditions of ontogenic lactase deficiency, the modulation <b>of</b> gastric <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> lactose is ineffective. It is possible that the rapid <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> sucrose is due to the saturation of sucrase because of substrate overload which impairs the intestinal inhibitory control <b>of</b> gastric <b>emptying...</b>|$|R
5|$|The reforms had {{ensured that}} a sizable force of regular troops {{was based in}} the United Kingdom for service as an expeditionary force, {{over and above the}} troops already {{stationed}} overseas. However, once the decision was taken to send a corps-size field force to fight in the South African War, the system began to show a strain. Three divisions were earmarked for deployment in October 1899, and 25,000 men were mobilised from the reserve to reinforce them; however, regulations of the time held that men under twenty should not be sent overseas, so the reservists had to replace underage or otherwise ineffective soldiers as well as filling the existing gaps. In some units, this meant reservists made up over 50% of the battalion strength; throughout the force, 36.5% of men were listed as unfit for foreign service. When the force sailed, 20,000 of the 47,000 men were reservists The field force, augmented by an additional brigade of infantry at the last minute, totalled three divisions; a fourth was organised in early November, and a fifth {{at the end of the}} month.

5|$|The {{relationship}} between the French and the Iroquois was strained long before the Lachine Massacre, as the French maintained relations with other tribes as well, for both trade and war alliances, such as the Abenaki. In 1679, {{following the end of}} the Iroquois war with the Susquehannock and the Mahican, the Iroquois raided native villages in the West. Pushing out Siouan tribes to the west, they claimed hunting grounds in the Ohio Valley by right of conquest. These were kept <b>empty</b> <b>of</b> inhabitants in order to encourage hunting. As a result, the Iroquois regularly raided trading parties in the western frontier which was under French protection, and took loot from them. Following military confrontation in 1684, though the Iroquois negotiated a peace treaty with New France governor Le Febvre de la Barre, the treaty stated the Iroquois were free to attack the western Indians. The French Crown objected to the treaty, and replaced LaBarre with the Marquis de Denonville. He was less sympathetic to native relations, and did not pay attention to the Iroquois-Algonquian tensions. In part, the Iroquois attacked the French because they were not willing to accept constraints against their warfare related to traditional Iroquois enemies.|$|E

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{evaluate}} the effects of posture on gastric emptying, intragastric distribution, and satiation after a meal containing oil and aqueous phases in patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Five patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) consumed 60 ml 99 mTc-labeled (V) -thiocyanate olive oil and 290 ml 113 mIn-labeled diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid soup while sitting and while lying in the left lateral decubitus position. Hunger and fullness before and after the meal were recorded. Results were compared with those obtained in 11 normal volunteers. In both postures <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> oil was faster (P < 0. 01) in CF patients. <b>Emptying</b> <b>of</b> the aqueous phase was faster (P < 0. 01) in CF patients in the decubitus position. In normal subjects there was no overall difference in <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> oil between the two postures, whereas <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> the aqueous phase was delayed (P < 0. 01) in the decubitus position. In CF patients <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> oil was faster (P < 0. 01) in the decubitus position, and <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> the aqueous phase was only slightly faster (P < 0. 05) in the sitting position. For both postures there was greater retention (P < 0. 05) of oil in the proximal stomach in normal subjects than CF patients. Hunger decreased (P < 0. 05) after the meal in the control subjects, but there was no change in CF patients. These results indicate that in CF patients with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency 1) gastric <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> nonhomogenized fat is faster than normal, 2) gravity affects gastric <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> oil, and 3) effects of a fatty meal on hunger are reduced.
