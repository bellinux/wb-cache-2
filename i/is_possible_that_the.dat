5|$|Because Xenopus {{are sold}} in pet shops and used in {{laboratories}} around the world, it <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> chytrid fungus may have been exported from Africa.|$|E
5|$|Almost all the {{surviving}} source material is of questionable reliability. The two witnesses who gave evidence, Robert Stubbs and James Kelsall, were strongly motivated to exonerate themselves from blame. It <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> figures concerning {{the number of}} slaves killed, {{the amount of water}} that remained on the ship, and the distance beyond Jamaica that Zong had mistakenly sailed are inaccurate.|$|E
5|$|Although {{its orbit}} is rather {{different}} from those of the main two groups, it <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> comet of 1680 is also related to the Kreutz sungrazers via a fragmentation many orbits ago.|$|E
50|$|It {{may also}} <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> light {{pressure}} from surrounding stars causes this phenomenon.|$|R
5000|$|It may <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> name 'Ancasta' <b>is</b> {{related to}} Proto-Celtic *kasto- meaning 'swift'.|$|R
50|$|According to Caspar René Gregory {{it would}} <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{manuscript}} Tischendorfianus III was written and corrected in Jerusalem.|$|R
5|$|An Anglo-Saxon {{spearhead}} {{was found}} in July 1962 by D. Tamkin in a cutting through a natural knoll of sand on Messrs Reed's playing fields at Cobdown, Ditton. It <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> spearhead came from a grave {{on the top of}} the knoll, destroyed during the making or widening of the cutting.|$|E
5|$|An {{anonymous}} chronicler at Bury St Edmunds, {{working in}} the second quarter of the 12th century, produced a compilation now known as The Annals of St Neots. He used material from a version of Asser's work which differs in some places from the Cotton manuscript and in some places appears to be more accurate, so it <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> copy used was not the Cotton manuscript.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} sibling of Nyuserre is known with near-certainty: Neferefre, {{who was a}} son of Neferirkare and Khentkaus II, was Nyuserre's elder brother. Since the {{relation}} between Shepseskare and Nyuserre remains uncertain, it <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two were brothers too, as suggested by Roth, although the dominant hypothesis is that Shepseskare was a son of Sahure and hence Nyuserre's uncle.|$|E
60|$|He {{was almost}} as badly stunned by the {{significance}} of Swenson's news as Swenson himself. Could it <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> man who had built up the field service of the bureau--the man whose clean-handed patriotism had held the boys together, making them every year more clearly a unit, a little army of enthusiasts--could it <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> originator, the organizer of this great plan, had been stricken down just when his influence was of most account? He refused to believe it of an administration pledged {{to the cause of}} conservation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a musket, sir. I noticed that, when Joel first {{detailed}} his detachments. Can it <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> savages have retired?" ...|$|R
50|$|It <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> accused's legal {{representatives and}} expert {{witnesses}} {{would not be}} available if the trial were to commence on a postponed date.|$|R
5|$|Eighteen {{of these}} pits {{were found to}} contain the remains of human skeletons, which are now stored in the Weston-super-Mare Museum in Weston-super-Mare. Eighteen full skeletons were found, of which ten show {{evidence}} of a violent death (including sword cuts in the skulls). It <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Romans or the Belgic raiders attacked the fort and killed the inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|Giselle {{was first}} staged in Italy at Teatro alla Scala in Milan on 17 January 1843. The music however was not Adam's {{but that of}} Niccolò Bajetti. The dances were not the {{original}} either but those of Antonio Cortesi. It <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ballet was first staged in the provincial theatres. This, however, is not known with certainty.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine flavour {{to these}} images was also {{connected}} with contemporary attempts through diplomacy to achieve reconciliation with the Greek Orthodox Church, in which van Eyck's patron Philip the Good took a keen interest. Van Eyck's Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati (c. 1431) depicts {{one of the}} papal diplomats most involved with these efforts.|$|E
6000|$|... "What?" [...] Darius screamed, and {{we looked}} at each other incredulously, for surely it could not <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> enemy had {{evacuated}} the city so soon.|$|R
50|$|Also {{it needs}} to be borne in mind the idea of {{transporter}} promiscuity. It may <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> NE levels <b>are</b> raised, at least in part, through DAT blockade.|$|R
5000|$|The {{habitat is}} {{characterized}} by a dominance of Nothofagus dombeyi, with a very dense understorey of Chusquea culeou. It appears to <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bamboo C. culeou could be the food plant.|$|R
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Iazyges did {{not move}} west in their entirety, {{and that some of}} them stayed along the Sea of Azov, which would explain the {{occasional}} surname of , however if this is true, the Iazyges that remained along the Sea of Azov are never mentioned again.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Tyne and Wear Metro may be {{extended}} from Northumberland Park and terminate at Blyth, {{but this will}} not be considered before 2019. An alternative, proposed (2009) by the Association of Train Operating Companies, is reopening the existing freight line between Newcastle and Ashington, including reopening Newsham station to serve Blyth.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} exactly who was {{responsible}} for the damage on the German ships. It <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mines were air-dropped by RAF Handley Page Hampden bombers. Should this be the case, the bombers achieved far more damage than the Royal Navy {{and the rest of the}} RAF combined.|$|E
50|$|The {{memorial}} {{was built}} in 1886 to commemorate 100th anniversary {{of the founding of}} Penang by Captain Francis Light. However, it may <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> memorial <b>was</b> built in the 1840's or 1850's.|$|R
50|$|It <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> FIFA {{regulations}} at {{that time}} could conflict with certain provisions of European Community law, or, at the very least, an arguable case could be made that such a conflict existed.|$|R
50|$|In the Soyombo alphabet, the two {{variations}} of the Soyombo symbol are used to mark the start and end of a text. It is thought to <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> symbol itself may predate the script.|$|R
5|$|Odo unsuccessfully {{rebelled against}} William II in 1088 {{and in the}} {{aftermath}} was stripped of his lands. His manors across Oxfordshire were taken back into royal control and broken up to be granted to sub-tenants, although it is unclear who was initially granted Deddington Castle; it <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> powerful Anglo-Norman baron Robert de Beaumont, the Earl of Leicester, controlled it in 1130.|$|E
5|$|Pieces of the {{original}} timbers were preserved enough to allow scientists to analyse them and determine some {{of the types of}} wood used. It <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ship was constructed in western Asia and bought by Arabian merchants to be used for the Oman to China route; the cargo contains many Arabian-inspired artefacts.|$|E
5|$|Produced {{later than}} Werferth's coins are those by Efe: these, {{by far the}} most numerous, have dies which change in time. Distribution {{analysis}} suggests that Efe's mint was possibly located in northern Suffolk or southern Norfolk. It <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> name of the village of Euston, Suffolk, a little southeast of Thetford, is derived from Efe.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good Heavens!" [...] the Major exclaimed; [...] "can this be true? Can it <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Rajah of Bithoor {{is going}} to join the mutineers? It is impossible; he could never be such a scoundrel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The man {{certainly}} exceeded reason, for he led {{the conference}} into personalities that no prudent man could relish. Still he said it <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Coquette might yet be ordered for service among the islands!" ...|$|R
50|$|It {{may have}} <b>been</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Barisan <b>was</b> merely {{inspired}} by successful Communist movements elsewhere to end colonialism and {{to mobilize the}} masses, and there is uncertainty about whether the Barisan was Communist controlled or not.|$|R
5|$|Some {{of these}} sources may {{originally}} have been oral works. A {{number of the}} stories in the narrative parts of the Liber resemble Scandinavian sagas, including the story about King Cnut visiting the monastery and singing an Anglo-Saxon song to the assembled monks. It <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> information on Hereward and Byrhtnoth originally came from orally transmitted tales that were written down.|$|E
5|$|The last {{significant}} extension {{was added}} in 1920, {{which was designed}} by the Luttrell Brothers. The south-east wing was much more {{in keeping with the}} original design. It <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> architects designed a second storey for the service wing that had been built in 1889. This extension connected the original house with the original washhouse.|$|E
5|$|The {{radiocarbon}} dating {{of the human}} remains {{does not provide a}} date for the construction of Coldrum Long Barrow itself; it <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> individuals died either some time before or after the monument's construction.|$|E
5000|$|During the renovations, {{the theatre}} {{was used as}} a test ground for IMAX's new laser {{projection}} system. Thus, it could <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> projection system has already been replaced after only a year upgrading to 3D.|$|R
