5|$|After {{the war and}} his {{recovery}} from the Chapultepec wound, Longstreet and Louise Garland were officially married on March 8, 1848, and the marriage produced 10 children. He and his new wife served on frontier duty in Texas, primarily at Fort Martin Scott near Fredericksburg and Fort Bliss in El Paso. He performed scouting missions and also served as major and paymaster for the 8th Infantry from July 1858. Author <b>Kevin</b> <b>Phillips</b> claims that during this period Longstreet {{was involved in a}} plot to draw the Mexican state of Chihuahua into the Union as a slave state.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{successful}} 2012–13 season which saw a league-best 85 goals scored, Watford ultimately {{finished third in}} the Championship, narrowly missing out on an automatic promotion place by two points, behind Hull. In the promotion play-off semi-final, Watford were defeated by Leicester City 1–0 in the away leg, but won 3–1 at home, with Troy Deeney scoring the winning goal on a last-second injury time attack following a Leicester penalty kick miss to advance to the final. Watford were defeated in the final by Crystal Palace, 1–0, on an extra-time penalty by <b>Kevin</b> <b>Phillips.</b>|$|E
5|$|In January 2002, {{chairman}} Doug Ellis {{once again}} appointed Graham Taylor as manager. Villa finished the 200102 season in eighth place, which {{was similar to}} most of their other Premiership finishes. Taylor quit as manager {{for the second time}} {{after the end of the}} 200203 season. Villa had just finished 16th in the Premiership, losing twice to arch rivals Birmingham City. David O'Leary, who had taken Leeds United to the semi-finals of the 200001 Champions League, was brought in as Taylor's replacement. O'Leary took the team to sixth in the table, with a 20 home defeat against Manchester United on the final day meaning that they narrowly missed out on a UEFA Cup place. In 200506, Villa slowly fell down the table and finished in 16th place. The poor placing came despite O'Leary having spent more than £13million the previous summer on players such as Milan Baroš, <b>Kevin</b> <b>Phillips</b> and Wilfred Bouma.|$|E

25|$|After Steve Perryman left to join Tottenham Hotspur, Roeder {{was hired}} as the new manager of his former club Watford {{at the start of}} the 1993–94 season. However, Watford were fined £10,000 for an illegal approach, and ordered to pay Gillingham a further £30,000 in compensation. In his second season with Watford he almost took the side to the play-offs, {{eventually}} finishing just two places outside them. However, he was sacked in February 1996 as the side were struggling at the bottom of the First Division. His replacement, Graham Taylor, was unable to prevent the side from being relegated. During his time at Vicarage Road he signed <b>Kevin</b> <b>Phillips</b> from local Hertfordshire team, Baldock Town for only £10,000.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, Jardel {{was linked}} to several teams, and after failing to {{transfer}} to Benfica and Rangers (due to the strict British rules involving non-EU players), he signed with Portuguese side Porto, where with help from players such as Zlatko Zahovič, Sérgio Conceição and Ljubinko Drulović, he was the top goalscorer in Europe for three years (1998–99, 1999–00, 2001–02), with a goal average of slightly over one goal per match (130 goals in 125 matches {{for an average of}} 1.04 per match). Although he was top scorer three times, due to the use of coefficients based on each European league's standards, he only won twice, the 1998–99 and 2001–02 European Golden Boots. He lost out to <b>Kevin</b> <b>Phillips</b> in 1999–2000 despite Phillips having scored six fewer goals than Jardel.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{initially}} being {{back-up to}} first choice strikers James Beattie and <b>Kevin</b> <b>Phillips,</b> Crouch became the main attacking {{focus of the}} Southampton team upon the arrival of Harry Redknapp and the sale of Beattie. He scored many key goals in Southampton's relegation battle, including memorable goals against Liverpool in a 2–0 home win, Arsenal in a 1–1 home draw and two away to Middlesbrough in a 3–1 victory. He also scored a late winning penalty to knock former club and Saints' arch-rival Portsmouth out of the FA Cup. His form for the Saints eventually resulted in him receiving his first England call-up. After scoring 16 goals in 33 appearances during the 2004–05 season, his future was cast into doubt when Southampton were relegated from the Premier League. On 19 July 2005, Southampton agreed to sell Crouch for £7million to Liverpool on a four-year contract.|$|E

On 30 March, he broke Robbie Fowler's club record of 28 goals in a Premier League season in a 4–0 home win against Tottenham which took Liverpool top of the league with six matches remaining. On 20 April, he scored in a 3–2 win at Norwich to become the first Liverpool player to score 30 league goals in a season since Ian Rush in 1986–87.

500|$|Harrison was {{defeated}} in the November 1892 election by former president Grover Cleveland, a Democrat, who returned to the White House in March 1893. President Harrison left office proclaiming the nation's prosperity, but in May, amid economic uncertainty that caused many people to convert assets into gold, the stock market crashed, and many firms went bankrupt. The depression that ensued {{became known as the}} Panic of 1893. Among those who became insolvent in 1893 was a McKinley friend, Robert Walker. McKinley had co-signed promissory notes for Walker, and thought the total to be $17,000. Walker had deceived McKinley, telling the governor that fresh loans were renewals of old ones, and the total indebtedness, for which McKinley had made himself liable, was over $130,000. That sum was beyond McKinley's means, and he planned to resign and earn the money as a lawyer. He was rescued by Hanna and other wealthy supporters, who raised the money to pay the loans. According to McKinley biographer <b>Kevin</b> <b>Phillips,</b> the governor's backers [...] "paid off the cosigned notes so that McKinley—by now, the probable next president—did not {{need to go back to}} practicing law".|$|E
500|$|Baroš {{moved to}} Premiership side Aston Villa {{for a fee}} of £6.5 million in August 2005, signing a {{four-year}} contract. He was given the number 10 shirt.

[...] He {{played a crucial role}} in Villa's League Cup second round victory against Wycombe Wanderers in September. With Villa trailing 3–1 at half time, Baroš scored shortly after the beginning of the second half and won a penalty, which Gareth Barry converted. He also provided the cross for Barry's second goal of the game as Villa scored seven goals in the second half, resulting in a final score of 8–3, their biggest win in over 40 years. He set up the first Aston Villa goal in a November match against Sunderland in dubious circumstances; back-heeling the ball, which [...] "looked to have gone out of play" [...] to Aaron Hughes. Hughes' pass found <b>Kevin</b> <b>Phillips,</b> who opened the scoring against his old club. He later scored a goal himself in the same game, which ended 3–1 to Villa.|$|E
500|$|After going {{nearly two}} months without scoring a goal, Nasri marked his goal-scoring return in {{emphatic}} fashion in the team's 5–0 second leg victory over Porto in the round of 16 of the Champions League knockout stage. The goal, described by English newspaper The Guardian columnist David Lacey as [...] "reminiscent of a lost art in British football", showcased Nasri's dribbling, {{as well as his}} individuality. Upon receiving the ball on the right wing from midfielder Abou Diaby, Nasri dribbled through and past three Porto players in a small area of space before bringing the ball past wing-back Álvaro Pereira and driving it across the goalkeeper, sending the ball in off the far post. Nasri goal was subsequently compared by the English media to similar goals that occurred in the country. Three weeks later, after appearing as a substitute in the second half, Nasri scored the opening goal against Birmingham City. Birmingham later equalized through a late goal from <b>Kevin</b> <b>Phillips.</b> The draw ended a string of seven consecutive league victories for Arsenal and Wenger admitted that the draw [...] "was a big blow for our chances [...] ". In the team's final seven league matches, Nasri assisted on goals in a 3–2 loss to Wigan Athletic and a 4–0 home win over Fulham. Arsenal ultimately finished the campaign in third place. Nasri concluded his second season at Arsenal appearing in 34 matches, scoring five goals and providing five assists.|$|E
