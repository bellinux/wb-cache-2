25|$|Phan {{met with}} his wife only once more {{following}} the divorce: when he was pardoned and released from Hỏa Lò Prison {{more than two decades}} later. He was then sent to a loose form of house arrest in Huế and the train stopped at Vinh, Nghệ An, Vietnam. On the way, <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>said,</b> “I am very happy. From now on, my only wish is that you will hold to your initial aspiration. Do whatever you like, and do not worry about your wife and children.” While Phan was living out his final years, his children and their families came to visit him, but never his wife. When she died, she instructed her children not to tell Phan so as to not distract him.|$|E

500|$|As a retailer, Marcus {{believed}} {{strongly in}} making his store {{into a place}} where everything a customer needed could be found and, if necessary, brought to the customer's front door. He {{was said to have}} helped one customer discover the shoe size of Queen Elizabeth II so as to give the gift of stockings and a pair of shoes, and he ordered that the store stock such items as a set of Steuben plates with the Mexican national crest, [...] "because sooner or later somebody will be going to call on the President of Mexico and need a proper gift." [...] He personally delivered a fur coat to a St. Louis, Missouri, customer who could not make the trip to Dallas. Another story often recounted is that of a shopper who, in searching for a present for <b>his</b> <b>wife,</b> <b>said</b> that he was not sure what to buy, but that he would know it when he saw it. In response, Marcus inquired about the woman's clothing sizes and asked the customer to wait briefly. Taking an oversized brandy snifter from a display, Marcus gathered cashmere sweaters of various colors, arranged them in imitation of a pousse-café, topped with a white angora sweater to simulate whipped cream, and in place of a cherry, garnished the concoction with a 10-karat ruby ring, at a total cost of $25,350, which the customer gladly paid. When one customer decided his Christmas purchases were not sufficiently impressive, Marcus helped to arrange a full duplication of the store's display window, complete with mannequins and lighting, inside the man's home.|$|E
500|$|The {{moving in}} 1783 of London's executions, from Tyburn to Newgate Prison, reduced the {{likelihood}} of public interference and strengthened the authorities' hold over felons. [...] However, society's view of dissection remained unequivocal; most preferred gibbeting to the laying open of a corpse. [...] Martin Gray, sentenced to death in 1721 for returning early from transportation, was [...] "greatly frighted, least his Body should be cut, and torn, and mangled after Death, and had sent his Wife to his Uncle to obtain some money to prevent it." [...] Vincent Davis, convicted in 1725 of murdering <b>his</b> <b>wife,</b> <b>said</b> he would rather be [...] "hang'd in Chains" [...] than [...] "anatomiz'd", and to that effect had [...] "sent many Letters to all his former Friends and Acquaintance to form a Company, and prevent the Surgeons in their Designs upon his Body". [...] There are cases of criminals who survived the short drop, but dissecting the body removed any hope of escape from death's embrace. [...] Anatomists were popularly thought {{to be interested in}} dissection only as enactors of the law, a relationship first established by kings James IV and Henry VIII. [...] Thomas Wakley, editor of The Lancet, wrote that this lowered [...] "the character of the profession in the public mind." [...] It was also thought that the anatomists' work made the body's owner unrecognisable in the afterlife. [...] Therefore, while less hated than the resurrectionists they employed, anatomists remained at risk of attack. [...] Relatives of a man executed in 1820 killed one anatomist and shot another in the face, while in 1831, following the discovery of buried human flesh and three dissected bodies, a mob burnt down an anatomy theatre in Aberdeen. [...] The theatre's proprietor, Andrew Moir, escaped through a window, while two of his students were chased through the streets.|$|E

2500|$|Douglas was {{nominated}} for an Academy Award for the role, with his costar Anthony Quinn winning the Best Supporting Actor Oscar as Paul Gauguin, van Gogh's friend. Douglas won a Golden Globe award, although Minnelli said Douglas should have won an Oscar: [...] "He achieved a moving and memorable portrait of the artist—a man of massive creative power, triggered by severe emotional stress, the fear and horror of madness." [...] Douglas himself called his acting role as Van Gogh a painful experience: [...] "Not only did I look like Van Gogh, I was the same age {{he was when he}} committed suicide." [...] <b>His</b> <b>wife</b> <b>said</b> he often remained in character in his personal life: [...] "When he was doing Lust for Life, he came home in that red beard of Van Gogh's, wearing those big boots, stomping around the house — it was frightening." ...|$|E

2500|$|Raja Petra Raja Kamaruddin, who did {{not deny}} that he linked Deputy Prime Minister Najib Razak to the slaying, pleaded {{innocent}} to the charge, and said he {{should have the right}} to hold the powerful accountable for wrongdoing. Raja Petra was taken to a detention center after he refused to post the bail of RM5,000. The court set the trial for 6 October 2008. If convicted, he faces up to 3 years in prison. [...] "I am not posting bail. See you guys in October, I will be out for Christmas. Don't worry." [...] <b>His</b> <b>wife</b> <b>said</b> she was [...] "quite stunned" [...] that Raja Petra refused to post bail, and said she thought he wanted to make a statement by not posting bail, which he reportedly felt he could not afford to. She launched a campaign to solicit donations of RM1 from the public for the RM5,000 bail, but called it off a few hours later after the campaign raised over RM35,000.|$|E
2500|$|The Gemara {{told that}} the wise men of the enemy of the Jews Haman read Jacob's blessing of Judah in [...] "Your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies," [...] to teach that Haman could not prevail against a {{descendant}} of Judah. Thus [...] reports, [...] "Then his (Haman's) wise men and Zeresh <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>said</b> to him: ‘If Mordecai [...] [...] [...] be of the seed of the Jews ( [...] , ha-Yehudim), you shall not prevail against him.'" [...] (The word , ha-Yehudim, can refer to both the Jews {{and the people of}} the tribe of Judah.) The Gemara reported that the wise men told Haman that if Mordecai came from another tribe, then Haman could prevail over him, but if he came from one of the tribes of Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, or Manasseh, then Haman would not prevail over him. They deduced the strength of descendants of Judah from [...] And they deduced the strength of descendants of Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh from [...] which says, [...] "Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up your might." ...|$|E

Pepirium added that Brad Swaile, Light's English-language voice actor, [...] "nails" [...] the [...] "difficult" [...] task of making Light [...] "both likable and hated". Jason Charpentier of The Anchor stated that Light's attributes and his role as a main character form [...] "part of what makes Death Note interesting". Light was also listed 18th in IGN's 2009 best anime character of all-time list with writer Chris Mackenzie praising how Light is [...] "mesmerizing". In 2014, he was placed seventh on IGN's list of greatest anime characters of all-time, with the cite stating that [...] "Light Yagami was the force that drove Death Note and made it a phenomenon". He is frequently cited as being an anti-hero and sometimes a villain protagonist.|$|E

2500|$|In 1935 Huxley was {{appointed}} secretary to the Zoological Society of London, and {{spent much of}} the next seven years running the society and its zoological gardens, the London Zoo and Whipsnade Park, alongside his writing and research. The previous Director, Peter Chalmers Mitchell, had been in post for many years, and had skillfully avoided conflict with the Fellows and Council. Things were rather different when Huxley arrived. Huxley was not a skilled administrator; <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>said</b> [...] "He was impatient… and lacked tact". He instituted a number of changes and innovations, more than some approved of. For example, Huxley introduced a whole range of ideas designed to make the Zoo child-friendly. Today, this would pass without comment; but then it was more controversial. He fenced off the Fellows' Lawn to establish Pets Corner; he appointed new assistant curators, encouraging them to talk to children; he initiated the Zoo Magazine. Fellows and their guests had the privilege of free entry on Sundays, a closed day to the general public. Today, that would be unthinkable, and Sundays are now open to the public. Huxley's mild suggestion (that the guests should pay) encroached on territory the Fellows thought was theirs by right.|$|E
