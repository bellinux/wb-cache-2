5|$|A wary species, {{the black}} stork avoids contact with people. It is {{generally}} found {{alone or in}} pairs, or in <b>flocks</b> <b>of</b> up to a hundred birds when migrating, or over winter.|$|E
5|$|An older {{technique}} to quantify migration involves observing {{the face of}} the moon towards full moon and counting the silhouettes of <b>flocks</b> <b>of</b> birds as they fly at night.|$|E
5|$|<b>Flocks</b> <b>of</b> {{anything}} {{from five to}} fifty thousand common starlings form {{in areas of the}} UK just before sundown during mid-winter. These flocks are commonly called murmurations.|$|E

5|$|<b>Flocks</b> <b>of</b> birds {{appear to}} engage in play; one routine {{involves}} a bird perching atop a tall tree, pole or spire, and others swooping, tumbling or diving and attempting to dislodge it. A successful challenger is then challenged in its turn by other birds in the flock.|$|E
5|$|Queensland is {{the state}} in which the {{greatest}} numbers of brolgas are found, and sometimes <b>flocks</b> <b>of</b> over 1,000 individuals are seen here. The bird is the official bird emblem for the state and also appears on its coat of arms.|$|E
5|$|Swans {{and geese}} usually start {{to arrive in}} late October. Passage waders in the autumn include red knot, godwit, dunlin, ringed and grey plovers, ruff, common greenshank, spotted redshank, curlew sandpiper and common, wood and green sandpipers. Besides Bewick's swan and <b>flocks</b> <b>of</b> white-fronted geese, large {{waterfowl}} regularly present in the reserve in winter include the Brant goose, pink-footed goose, barnacle goose and Taiga bean goose. The swans tend to fly off {{in the day and}} return to feed in the late afternoon, and another spectacular sight at the end of winter afternoons is the arrival of large <b>flocks</b> <b>of</b> starlings. Smaller wildfowl present in winter include wigeon, Eurasian teal, common pochard, northern pintail, water rail, dunlin, redshank, curlew, golden plover, snipe and ruff.|$|E

5|$|The game's setting, Bright Falls, draws {{inspiration}} from the early 1990s TV show Twin Peaks, which was set in the titular town; both fictional small towns {{in the state of}} Washington. Alfred Hitchcock is also cited as an inspiration, with the <b>flocks</b> <b>of</b> birds that often attack the protagonist being influenced by his classic horror film The Birds.|$|E
5|$|The main {{centre of}} the new woollen {{industry}} was initially in south east Wales drawing on sheep from the monasteries of Margam, Neath and Tintern and the <b>flocks</b> <b>of</b> the Bohun family, which produced 18,500 fleeces in 1372.|$|E
5|$|Aviary {{experiments}} {{conducted with}} captive <b>flocks</b> <b>of</b> scaly-breasted munia have tested whether producers and scroungers reach the predicted stable equilibrium frequency (see Evolutionarily stable strategy) when individuals {{are free to}} choose either behavior. The numbers choosing either producers and scrounger strategies {{have been shown to}} converge on stable frequencies while demonstrating that variation in tactics arise through frequency dependent pay-offs from the choice of different feeding strategies.|$|E
5000|$|In late March {{and early}} April, a <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> 68 {{garganey}} was offshore {{in the bay}} - the second largest flock ever to be recorded in Britain (the largest was a <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> 120 in Kent in the 1950s).|$|R
50|$|He was in {{the band}} A <b>Flock</b> <b>of</b> Seagulls until 1986, but {{when he decided to}} reform the band again in 1989, the other members {{declined}} to join him. He performed and toured with A <b>Flock</b> <b>of</b> Seagulls with different members.|$|R
40|$|The problem <b>of</b> herding a <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> birds is {{posed in}} a graph theoretic framework. A novel algorithm, called the n-wavefront algorithm, Is {{developed}} for enabling a single {{unmanned aerial vehicle}} to herd a <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> birds to a desired point. The technique {{is applied to the}} problem <b>of</b> diverting a <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> birds approaching an airport away from a protected zone around the airport. The n-wavefront algorithm is demonstrated in simulation and compared with existing strategies using graph-based metrics...|$|R
5|$|Huge <b>flocks</b> <b>of</b> {{more than}} a million common {{starlings}} may be observed just before sunset in spring in southwestern Jutland, Denmark over the seaward marshlands of Tønder and Esbjerg municipalities between Tønder and Ribe. They gather in March until northern Scandinavian birds leave for their breeding ranges by mid-April. Their swarm behaviour creates complex shapes silhouetted against the sky, a phenomenon known locally as sort sol ("black sun").|$|E
5|$|Mistle thrushes {{are found}} as {{individuals}} or pairs {{for much of}} the year, although families forage together in late summer, and groups may merge to form <b>flocks</b> <b>of</b> several tens of birds; {{it is not uncommon for}} up to 50 thrushes to feed together at that time of year. They roost at night in trees or bushes, again typically as individuals or pairs, but with families roosting together in autumn.|$|E
5|$|Pied currawongs are {{generally}} tree-dwelling, hunting and foraging some metres above the ground, and thus {{able to share}} territory with the ground-foraging Australian magpie. Birds roost in forested areas or large trees at night, disperse to forage {{in the early morning}} and return in the late afternoon. Although often solitary or encountered in small groups, the species may form larger <b>flocks</b> <b>of</b> fifty or more birds in autumn and winter. On the ground, a pied currawong hops or struts.|$|E

5|$|The crag martins mainly breed on dry, {{warm and}} {{sheltered}} cliffs in mountainous areas with crags and gorges, and the Eurasian crag martin reaches 5,000m (16,500ft) in Central Asia. The use of buildings as artificial cliffs has enabled breeding expansion into lowland areas, {{particularly for the}} two tropical species, and the rock martin breeds in desert towns. In South Asia, migrant Eurasian birds sometimes join with <b>flocks</b> <b>of</b> the dusky crag martin and roost communally on ledges of cliffs or buildings in winter.|$|E
5|$|As many as 50,000 pink-footed geese, 13,000 Eurasian wigeon and 7,000 brent geese winter at Holkham, {{making it}} of {{international}} importance for these species. Up to 400 white-fronted geese {{and a few}} tundra bean geese may join the wildfowl flocks, and the odd peregrine falcon, short-eared owl, merlin, marsh harrier or hen harrier may hunt over the fields. The shingle banks and foreshore hold wintering <b>flocks</b> <b>of</b> shore larks, snow buntings and twite, and waders like knots, curlews, dunlins and grey plover probe for invertebrates in the mud flats.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the river}} {{mouth and the}} River Witham, a large expanse of {{saltmarsh}} provides breeding grounds for common redshank, Eurasian oystercatcher and reed bunting in the summer, and Eurasian wigeon, mallard, common shelduck and common teal in the winter. Birds of prey such as hen harrier and merlin feed on the <b>flocks</b> <b>of</b> linnet and twite, while the mudflats support dunlin, whimbrel, and bar-tailed godwit. The Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust have a reserve there, which is next to RSPB Frampton Marsh, a reserve managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.|$|E
60|$|When the {{imperial}} trifler had exhausted his store of grain, and satisfied the cravings of his voracious favourites, {{he was relieved}} of his silver vase by two attendants. The <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> poultry was then ushered out at one door, while the <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> geniuses was ushered in at the other.|$|R

5|$|Birds are {{the animals}} most {{often seen in}} the monument. Included {{among the more than}} 50 species {{observed}} are red-tailed hawks, American kestrels, great horned owls, common nighthawks, and great blue herons. Geese nest in the park each summer, and <b>flocks</b> <b>of</b> sandhill cranes and swans pass overhead each year on their migratory flights. California quail, chukar partridges, and mourning doves are also common. Others seen near the Cant Ranch and the visitor's center include rufous hummingbirds, Say's phoebe, yellow warblers, western meadowlarks, and American goldfinches. Visitors on trails may encounter canyon wrens, mountain bluebirds, mountain chickadees, black-billed magpies, and other birds.|$|E
5|$|In these {{countries}} {{there is little}} need, and no option but for ewes to lamb outdoors as there are insufficient structures to handle the large <b>flocks</b> <b>of</b> ewes there. New Zealand ewes produce 36 million lambs each spring time, which is an average of 2,250 lambs per farm. Australian graziers, too, do not receive the financial support that governments in other countries provide to sheep breeders. Low-cost sheep breeding is based on large numbers of sheep per labour unit and having ewes {{that are capable of}} unsupervised lambing to produce hardy, active lambs.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{other birds}} can be seen, {{especially}} during the spring and autumn migration. Sand martins (Riparia riparia) arrive early and can usually be seen hawking over the water for insects in {{the second or third}} week of March. <b>Flocks</b> <b>of</b> tits (Paridae), swallows (Hirundinidae) and terns (Sternidae) can regularly be seen. Waders, such as lapwings (Vanellus vanellus), dunlin (Calidris alpina) and common snipe (Gallinago gallinago), are attracted to the muddy shores if the water level drops in autumn. By midwinter up to 55,000 gulls, mostly black-headed gull (Chroicocephalus ridibundus) and common gull (Larus canus), may be roosting. Good numbers of reed warblers (Acrocephalus scirpaceus) and sedge warblers (A. schoenobaenus) nest in the fringing reeds, along with grebes (Podicipedidae) and Eurasian coots (Fulica atra).|$|E
