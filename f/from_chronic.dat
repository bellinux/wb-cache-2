5|$|Chopin's {{disease and}} the cause of his death have since been a matter of discussion. His death {{certificate}} gave the cause as tuberculosis, and his physician, Jean Cruveilhier, was then the leading French authority on this disease. Other possibilities have been advanced including cystic fibrosis, cirrhosis and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. In 2017, an autopsy was performed on Chopin's preserved heart, which confirmed that a rare case of pericarditis, caused by complications <b>from</b> <b>chronic</b> tuberculosis, was the likely cause of his death.|$|E
5|$|In 1960 Waugh {{accepted}} {{a fee of}} £250 from the BBC for an adaptation of Pinfold, as a radio play, by Michael Bakewell. The broadcast, on 7 June 1960, was well received by the critics, although Waugh did not listen to it. In September 1977 a staged version of the book, written by Ronald Harwood and directed by Michael Elliott, opened at the Royal Exchange theatre, Manchester. The play was brought to London, and performed at the Roundhouse Theatre in February 1979, where Michael Hordern's depiction of Pinfold was highly praised—"a man suffering <b>from</b> <b>chronic</b> indigestion of the soul".|$|E
5|$|In {{the latter}} part of the 1960s, Cameron and her {{daughter}} moved to the pueblos of Santa Fe, New Mexico, where she developed a friendship with the sculptor John Chamberlain and appeared in his art movie, Thumb Suck, which was never released. It was also while in New Mexico that she suffered a collapsed lung and required hospitalization. Her wider health was poor, as she suffered <b>from</b> <b>chronic</b> bronchitis and emphysema—which were both exacerbated by her chain smoking—while hand tremors prevented her from being able to paint for four years.|$|E

He took early retirement in 1981 to care for his ailing wife, who was suffering <b>from</b> <b>chronic</b> bronchitis, but she died on 3 August 1981, two weeks before his retirement.|$|E
5|$|Millen's heavy {{workload}} {{had begun}} to affect his health and he considered retirement, but he ultimately decided to continue and was re-elected to the Senate at the 1922 election. He retired from the ministry in February 1923, and in March was granted leave of absence because of his deteriorating health. He died aged 63 <b>from</b> <b>chronic</b> nephritis on 14 September 1923 at Caulfield in Melbourne, {{survived by his wife}} and two daughters. Presbyterian services were held at Parliament House in Melbourne and St Stephen's Church in Sydney, and Millen was given a state funeral. He is buried at Rookwood Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|She {{had three}} younger brothers. The eldest, Alfred, {{was born in}} 1883, was awarded a {{doctorate}} in chemistry from Erlangen in 1909, but died nine years later. Fritz Noether, born in 1884, is remembered for his academic accomplishments: after studying in Munich he made a reputation for himself in applied mathematics. The youngest, Gustav Robert, was born in 1889. Very {{little is known about}} his life; he suffered <b>from</b> <b>chronic</b> illness and died in 1928. There is no record of Noether ever marrying or having children.|$|E

5|$|To {{regain his}} strength, Edwards {{and his wife}} took a {{carriage}} to a rustic cottage refuge in Arkville in the Catskill Mountains but isolation, plain food and rest yielded little improvement. A physician was called and he informed Mrs. Edwards {{that there would be}} no recovery for her husband from the advanced Bright's disease with complications <b>from</b> <b>chronic</b> pneumonia so she brought him back to New York City. Edwards died at home at 185 East 116th Street in East Harlem late on June 9, 1891, just hours after returning.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the great}} French naval superiority, the French had {{conducted}} insufficient pre-war planning for {{an assault on}} the Prussian naval installations, and concluded that it would only be possible with Danish assistance, which was not forthcoming. The four ships, under the command of Vice Admiral Jachmann, made an offensive sortie in early August 1870 out to the Dogger Bank, though they encountered no French warships. Friedrich Carl and the other two broadside ironclads thereafter suffered <b>from</b> <b>chronic</b> engine trouble, which left Arminius alone to conduct operations. Friedrich Carl, Kronprinz, and König Wilhelm stood off the island of Wangerooge {{for the majority of the}} conflict, while Arminius was stationed in the mouth of the Elbe river. On 11 September, the three broadside ironclads were again ready for action; they joined Arminius for another major operation into the North Sea. It too did not encounter French opposition, as the French Navy had by this time returned to France.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth David Ltd {{was never}} more than {{modestly}} profitable, but David would not lower her standards {{in search of a}} commercial return. A new manager was brought in to run the shop and David fought against many of his changes, but she was always in the minority against her fellow directors. The stress of disagreements over company policy—and the deaths of her sister Diana in March 1971 and her mother in June 1973—contributed to health problems and she suffered <b>from</b> <b>chronic</b> fatigue and swollen, ulcerous legs. Gradually her business partners found her commercial approach unsustainable, and in 1973 she left the company. To her annoyance, the shop continued to trade under her name, although she tried periodically to persuade her former colleagues to change it.|$|E

5|$|Following the deindustrialisation of Greater Manchester in the mid-20th century, {{there was}} a {{significant}} economic and population decline in the region, particularly in Manchester and Salford. Vast areas of low-quality squalid terraced housing that were built throughout the Victorian era were found to be in a poor state of repair and unsuited to modern needs; many inner-city districts suffered <b>from</b> <b>chronic</b> social deprivation and high levels of unemployment. Slum clearance and the increased building of social housing overspill estates by Salford and Manchester City Councils lead to a decrease in population in central Greater Manchester. During the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, the population of Greater Manchester declined by over 8,000inhabitants a year. While Manchester's population shrank by about 40% during this time (from 766,311 in 1931 to 452,000 in 2006), the total population of Greater Manchester decreased by only 8%.|$|E
5|$|Salford {{became a}} major factory town and inland port during the 18th and 19th centuries. Cotton and silk {{spinning}} and weaving in local mills attracted an influx of families and provided Salford with a strong economy. Salford Docks was a principal dockyard of the Manchester Ship Canal. By {{the end of the}} 19th century Salford had an enlarged working class community and suffered <b>from</b> <b>chronic</b> overpopulation. Industrial activities declined during the 20th century however, causing a local economic depression. Salford subsequently became one of contrasts, with regenerated inner-city areas like Salford Quays next {{to some of the most}} socially deprived and violent areas in England.|$|E
5|$|With an {{accumulation}} of injuries over the years, Salo spent the 2007 off-season recovering <b>from</b> <b>chronic</b> groin, back and shoulder problems. Salo was immediately sidelined once more {{before the start of}} the 2007–08 season, fracturing his wrist during an intra-squad game in training camp. Shortly after returning, he was hit in the face by a clearing attempt from teammate Alexander Edler during a game against the Nashville Predators on 2 November 2007. The impact from the puck broke his nose and he mised 19 games. In 63 games, Salo recorded 25 points, his lowest output since his 2001–02 season with the Senators. Despite this, he still led all Canucks defencemen in scoring, as all the team's blueliners also suffered injuries over the season.|$|E

5|$|According to a {{study from}} 2003–2004, there were 13 {{different}} species of fish in the Potlatch River watershed, including speckled dace, longnose dace, rainbow trout (both wild and farm-raised), brook trout, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, northern pikeminnow, redside shiner, sculpin, bridgelip sucker, largescale sucker, and yellow perch. Migration of steelhead, the anadromous phase of rainbow trout, has been impacted by the construction of dams downstream on the Snake and Columbia Rivers. The two species of dace were cumulatively the largest individual fish population in the watershed, while steelhead accounted for 58.4% of the biomass. Of all the streams sampled during the study, the West Fork Potlatch River had the highest diversity because of its relatively pristine condition. The lower section of the river suffers <b>from</b> <b>chronic</b> pollution caused by agricultural runoff. From 2005 to 2008, the population of steelhead (rainbow) trout in the watershed was recorded by the Potlatch River Steelhead Monitoring and Evaluation Program (PRSME). There was no data for steelhead populations in the main stem but 197 adult steelhead were recorded in the East Fork of the river, while an average of 226 was recorded annually {{in one of the}} river's larger tributaries, Big Bear Creek. Over 1,000 steelhead are estimated to return to the Potlatch drainage in strong run years. Outmigration of steelhead smolt from the East Fork was estimated at 6,976 fish while the average for Big Bear Creek was 9,491. The Idaho Department of Fish and Game began a series of seven projects in 2009 in order to conserve fish habitat in the Potlatch.|$|E

It too did not encounter French opposition, as the French Navy had by this time returned to France. After the war, the Prussian Navy became the Imperial Navy, and resumed its peacetime training routines. General Albrecht von Stosch became the chief of the Imperial Navy, and organized the fleet for coastal defense.|$|E
5|$|The {{resignation}} in May 1836 of Senator Isaac Hill, who {{had been}} elected governor of New Hampshire, left a brief interim opening to be filled by the state legislature. With Hill's term as senator due to expire in March 1837, the legislature also had to fill the six-year term to follow. Pierce's candidacy for the Senate was championed by state Representative John P. Hale, a fellow Athenian at Bowdoin. After much debate, the legislature chose John Page to fill the rest of Hill's term. In December 1836, Pierce {{was elected to the}} full term, to commence in March 1837, becoming at age 32 one of the youngest members in Senate history to that point. The election came at a difficult time for Pierce, as his father, sister, and brother were all seriously ill, while Jane continued to suffer <b>from</b> <b>chronic</b> poor health. As senator, he was able to help his old friend Nathaniel Hawthorne, who often struggled financially, procuring a sinecure as measurer of coal and salt at the Boston Customs House that allowed the author time to continue writing.|$|E
