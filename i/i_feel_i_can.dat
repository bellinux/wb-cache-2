It's {{a good thing for}} an actor to do many different kinds of theatre, because it keeps his imagination stimulated." ...|$|E
500|$|On 13 February 1969, Negus and {{two others}} (Sir Geoffrey Keynes and Sir Stanford Cade) were {{presented}} with the Honorary Gold Medal of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. This award, which had only been made thirty times since 1802 prior to the 1969 ceremony, is presented for [...] "liberal acts or distinguished labours, researches and discoveries, eminently conducive to the improvement of natural knowledge and of the healing art." [...] The medal was presented by Sir Hedley Atkins, the President of the Royal College of Surgeons, who paid tribute to Negus: [...] "Sir Victor Negus {{is perhaps the most}} distinguished of all those who have served the Council as a co-opted member. He has always been known to us as a great research worker and scientist, whose labours earned him the Lister Medal, a man of exceptional integrity and industry and a persistent advocate of the value of tradition in its best sense." [...] Atkins also paid tribute to Negus's wife, Lady Negus, who had crafted and presented to the college a tapestry of its coat-of-arms. Responding, Negus thanked the members of the Council for the award and for the privilege of having used college facilities since 1921, concluding: [...] "I take this honour as a mark of approval for any work I have done, and <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> now sit back and leave it to others to carry on. I {{would also like to thank}} you for inviting my wife to be here to-day; she has taken a great part in all I have done." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite his {{successful}} college achievements, whether Flutie {{was too small}} to play professional football was uncertain. When asked on television [...] "Can a guy who's five-foot-nine, 175 pounds make it in the pros?", he answered [...] "Yes, he can. But it's a matter of ability and not size. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> play; I don't know for sure, and those questions will be answered in the future." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{always better}} to have things in black and white. <b>I</b> don't <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> be bothered to think of {{marriage}} until Tommy is found. Let's leave it till then.|$|R

6000|$|... "Thank you so much. You do put one at ease. My {{breach of}} {{convention}} makes me glad rather than sorry. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> open {{my heart to}} you about anything." ...|$|R
2500|$|Manson has {{commented on}} the subject of children, saying that she [...] "just missed the whole baby calling. I feel a lot of women think you're a freak if you feel like that, and maybe I am strange but I never got that feeling. In some ways I wish I had that urge, because I adore children... <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> live quite happily with my decision." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 30 May 2010, Modrić {{was awarded}} with a new six-year {{contract}} that ran until 2016; he said, [...] "Tottenham Hotspur gave me my chance in the Premier League and I {{want to go on}} to achieve great success here with them. Yes, there have been enquiries from other big clubs, but I have no interest in going anywhere. Last season's top-four finish was an indication of where we are as a Club and <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> continue to improve and go on to achieve everything I want to at Spurs".|$|E
2500|$|After making {{just one}} {{substitute}} appearance for Stevenage, Madjo joined League Two side Port Vale on loan on 24 November 2011. He aimed to [...] "prove himself" [...] at the club, having previously had a trial at Vale Park {{before he turned}} professional at Bristol City in 2005. He made his debut for the club a day after signing, playing 80 minutes in a 0–0 home draw against Torquay United; he was praised for his performance despite being 'rusty' and short of match fitness. In his second appearance for the club, he scored only his fourth league goal in the Football League, as he [...] "displayed quick feet, an assured touch and deadly instincts in front of goal" [...] to net the winning goal of a 2–1 victory at Dagenham & Redbridge. He dedicated the goal to coach Geoff Horsfield, after the pair spent many hours on the training ground working on Madjo's finishing skills. For his performance, Madjo was named on the League Two Team of the Week. He scored a 60-minute hat-trick in his third appearance for the club, a 4–0 home win over Aldershot Town; despite this he stated that [...] "I didn't play that well in the first half. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> give a lot more." [...] For this achievement he was named on the League Two Team of the Week for a second time. He returned to Broadhall Way in January having scored four goals in six games for Port Vale, who were unable to extend the loan deal due to an acute lack of funds.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} have so good an escort, Master Ormskirk," [...] she said, smiling; [...] "for {{after what}} Sir Ralph told me <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> safely entrust myself to your care." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I {{consider}} {{you in a}} {{very hopeful}} condition, Miss Kilburn, and <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> safely leave you to Mrs. Munger. She is coming to see {{you as soon as}} she gets back." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Excuse me, sir, but I {{am going}} outside my duty in {{speaking}} to you {{at all on the}} subject. I know you, however, of old; and <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> trust you. Not your word, sir, that is all right; but your discretion!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll be going. Haven't {{had breakfast}} yet. Too worried to eat breakfast. Relieved now. This is where three eggs and a rasher of ham get cut off in their prime. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> rely on you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you smile}} on yours then, Marie; and I will smile {{to see you}} happy. But tell me, dearest, what shall I say to Adolphe? You would not have me give him hope, when <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> never love him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly not, Corny, {{and that}} will be a ground of hope to you. Remember, my child, you can bring me no {{daughter}} I shall love half as well as <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> love Anneke Mordaunt. We are related too, her father's great-great-grandmother----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope not, but <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do no good. I {{have such}} {{absolute}} trust in Rachel, {{that you may}} be quite sure that I shall back her up in whatever she says. Now, good-night," [...] and with that he took his leave.|$|R
6000|$|... "On the whole, I think not. Of course, I'm in your hands, but as I've {{promised not}} to give you away, I expect these gentlemen won't take an unfair {{advantage}} of me. Then, from what I know about Don Martin, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> trust his daughter." ...|$|R

"But I shall {{write to}} you every day, Milly, however long it may be; and if I conquer myself, why, then, Milly, <b>I</b> shall <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> come back fit to marry you.

6000|$|... "I {{should be}} glad to do my work with the rest," [...] Reuben said, [...] "as soon as <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> be useful aloft. I was up {{two or three times}} yesterday, and hope in a few days to be quite {{accustomed}} to it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{has been}} like falling out of a prison from which one never hoped to escape.

6000|$|She {{wrote to}} Walter then and there, from her grandfather's consulting-room. Numb with shame as she was, she nerved {{her hand to}} write to him. In what most {{delicate}} language she could find, she let him plainly know who Sir Anthony was, and all else that had happened. But she added at the end one significant clause: [...] "While my mother lives, dear Walter, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> never marry you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It wouldn't be together. Now we are together. Now we {{have been}} together. We are full of {{memories}} <b>I</b> do not <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> ever forget a single one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Will you? That {{will be so}} good of you. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{leave it}} all so safely in your hands.

You will come on the twelfth?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, as {{you write}} a capital hand, {{and know how to}} express {{yourself}} on paper," [...] continued Hardy, [...] "it strikes me that you will do the job better than any one else; and, being a friend, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> talk freely to you on my private affairs. So you'll help me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{you have}} always been a fact in my existence--that is what I want to say," [...] she went on. [...] "It must be {{possible}} to remember a person and not recognize him, that is what <b>I</b> <b>feel.</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> remember you coming to our house in Ransome Street, and how I looked forward to your visits. And you used to have little candy beans in your pockets," [...] she cried. [...] "Have you now?" ...|$|E
60|$|Joking aside, I {{think there}} is much need of wise {{examination}} into what sorts of lies are best and wholesomest to be indulged, seeing we must all lie and do all lie, and what sorts it may be best to avoid--and this is a thing which <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> confidently put {{into the hands of}} this experienced Club--a ripe body, who may be termed, in this regard, and without undue flattery, Old Masters.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Hall," [...] she said, {{with a faint}} {{attempt at}} a smile, [...] "we are old friends, and <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> ask you a favor. You once before acted as our escort--it was for a short but a happy time--will you accept a larger trust?

6000|$|... "Well, that {{it would}} be exactly--what do you call it?--'square.' Or even quite {{delicate}} or decent. To take from him, in the way of an assurance so handsomely offered, so much, and then to ask for more: <b>I</b> don't <b>feel</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do it. Besides, I've my little conviction. To the question itself he might easily reply that it's none of my business." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Cut {{off another}} piece of rope, and give it me. When {{we are in the}} water, I will fasten you to the oars. They will keep you afloat, easily enough. I will keep close to you. You know I am a good swimmer and, {{whenever}} <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> tired, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> rest my hands on the oars, too.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh no! Of course <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> my position. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{only say}} that it was not because your {{daughter}} might probably have money that I first sought her love." ...|$|R
