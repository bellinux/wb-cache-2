2500|$|The {{floor plan}} of aisled barns {{resembles that of}} an aisled church. However, the nave in farm {{buildings}} is called an aisle thus a [...] "three aisled barn". Aisled barns <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> barn doors on the gable end of the building giving access to the center aisle, often called the drive floor or threshing floor. The side aisles may be the same widths making the barn symmetrical or the aisle where animals were housed may be narrower which is apparent outside the barn because the barn doors are then off-center. The area between the posts, perpendicular to the aisles are called bays. In stables there is a stable aisle down the centre with individual stalls facing the aisle.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2017, Dave Meltzer {{wrote that}} WWE's push of Reigns [...] "will never end. Isn't that obvious by now". A month later, Meltzer {{reported}} that WWE's long term plans ("which obviously could change") for 2018's WrestleMania 34 was to [...] "once again build {{for a year}} and <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> coronation" [...] for Reigns, who would be a babyface (the heroic character) [...] "between now and then" [...] and beat Brock Lesnar for the WWE Universal title [...] "to fully replace John Cena as the lead babyface of the company". In a 2017 ESPN interview, Anoa'i said he did not view his boos [...] "as a negative", but as [...] "motivation". Anoa'i elaborated, [...] " [...] thousands of people are screaming, booing {{at the top of their}} lungs, and I'm the center of attention, so I must be doing something right". In September 2017 on Raw, both (storyline) general manager Kurt Angle and commentator Corey Graves described Reigns as a wrestling [...] "icon".|$|E

2500|$|On the field, for {{the first}} time, an ineligible-player {{situation}} contaminated {{two of the five}} BCS bowls in this season before they were played. [...] In December 2010, five Ohio State players were implicated in an illegal-benefits scandal preceding the 2011 Sugar Bowl. Though the five players were suspended for five 2011 season games apiece, not only was Ohio State still allowed to play in the 2011 Sugar Bowl (which also resulted in Wisconsin playing in a Rose Bowl they otherwise would not have been allowed in, as Michigan State would <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Ten's Rose Bowl berth had Ohio State been removed from the three-way tie which allowed Wisconsin to gain the berth), but so were the five players. [...] After defeating Arkansas, the scandal grew, including open deception by Ohio State coach Jim Tressel. [...] As a result, Tressel has been forced out and, on July 11, 2011, Ohio State vacated all of its wins in an effort to reduce their penalties.|$|E
2500|$|Mauer {{attended}} {{the same high}} school as Baseball Hall of Famer and former Milwaukee Brewer Paul Molitor who is his current manager. Molitor has said that Mauer [...] "has the best swing he had ever seen". Jim O'Neill, Mauer's baseball coach at Cretin-Derham Hall, said his former student [...] "has been groomed for this job {{since he was a}} little boy. Mauer's dad, Jake, created a contraption for Joe he later named the 'Quickswing'. The device dropped balls down a tube from eye level and released them at waist level." [...] Mauer had been asked to leave his T-ball league at the age of four, because he was hitting the ball too hard for the other players. [...] "Another guy that came from Cretin-Derham Hall, Paul Molitor, was very similar, [...] had a good short swing", O'Neill said. [...] "And they're both able to wait on the ball so long because they don't <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> swing. Like anything, you keep simple and keep it small or short, there's not a lot of holes in it and not {{a lot of room for}} errors." ...|$|E
2500|$|Small in stature, {{he lacked}} the overall power of his larger {{competitors}} such as Don Budge and Kramer but made up for it with brains, ball control, and speed. A master court strategist and tactician, he worked his opponent out of position and scored points with the game's best drop shot and lob as well as punishing ground strokes that let him come to the net for put-away shots. [...] Kramer, {{one of the very}} few players who was undeniably better than Riggs, writes that there is a major [...] "misconception" [...] about Riggs. [...] "He didn't play some rinky-dink Harold Solomon style, pitty-pattying the ball around on dirt. [...] He didn't <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> serve, but he made up for it with some sneaky first serves and as fine a second serve as I had seen at that time. [...] When you talk about depth and accuracy both, Riggs' second serve ranks with the other three best that I ever saw: von Cramm's, Gonzales's, and Newcombe's." [...] In his own autobiography, Riggs wrote, [...] "In the 1946 match with Budge , I charged the net at every opportunity. [...] Employing what I called my secret weapon, a hard first serve, I attacked constantly during my 6–3, 6–1, 6–1 victory." ...|$|E

Too frightened to get up I had to stop in bed, and, I suppose, fell to sleep again, after fresh vain attempts to awaken Bolter. Next morning I told him about it.
