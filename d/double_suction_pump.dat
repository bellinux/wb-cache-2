40|$|Abstract. <b>Double</b> <b>suction</b> {{centrifugal}} <b>pumps</b> {{are widely}} employed in large water supply projects. In the present study, a <b>double</b> <b>suction</b> centrifugal <b>pump</b> with the staggered arrangement impeller in a domestic water supply {{project has been}} mapping and modeling, and then the symmetrical arrangement impeller of a <b>double</b> <b>suction</b> centrifugal <b>pump</b> has been designed for comparison. The commercial code was used to investigate the pump efficiency and the time variation of pressure at the zone of volute tongue. This unsteady flow feature was investigated by the large eddy simulation (LES) method with the sliding mesh technology. The analysis indicated that the pump efficiency of the <b>double</b> <b>suction</b> centrifugal <b>pump</b> with staggered arrangement impeller is lower than that with the symmetrical one. The frequency of pressure pulsation at the volute tongue {{is consistent with the}} blade passing frequency. The staggered arrangement impeller can reduce the levels of pressure pulsation significantly...|$|R

The works on inlet and exit blade angle {{shows that the}} performance can be altered, when the angles are modified. A higher exit blade angle was suggested by the researchers. Kamimoto and Matsuoka (1956) experimentally investigated the effect of exit blade angles and reported that the impeller with 30 ° exit angle has the best performance. For a <b>double</b> <b>suction</b> centrifugal <b>pump,</b> the head increment {{can be achieved by}} increasing exit blade angle and an improvement in efficiency by varying exit blade angles can be obtained (Varley 1961). The inlet blade angle modification of a radial impeller has been reported by Sanda and Daniela (2012), and Luo et al. (2008). They reported that performance enhancement is possible by this modification.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an investigation of}} rotor/stator interaction in centrifugal pumps with radial diffusers. Steady and unsteady diffuser vane pressure measurements were made for two impellers, {{one half of the}} <b>double</b> <b>suction</b> <b>pump</b> of the High Pressure Oxygen Turbopump (HPOTP) of the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) and a two-dimensional impeller. Unsteady impeller blade pressure measurements were made for a second two-dimensional impeller with blade number and geometry identical to the two-dimensional impeller used for the diffuser vane pressure measurements. The experiments were conducted with different flow coefficients and different radial gaps between the blade trailing edge and the diffuser vane leading edge (5 % and 8 % of the impeller discharge radius for the two-dimensional impellers, and 1. 5 % and 4. 5 % for the impeller of the HPOTP). The largest pressure fluctuations on the diffuser vanes and the impeller blades were found to be of the same order of magnitude as the total pressure rise across the pump. On the diffuser vanes, the largest pressure fluctuations were observed on the suction side of the vane near the leading edge, whereas on the impeller blades the largest fluctuations occurred at the blade trailing edge. The resulting lift on the diffuser vane was computed from the pressure measurements; the magnitude of the fluctuating lift was found to be larger than the steady lift...|$|E

The vane pressure fluctuations were larger on the vane suction than on the vane pressure side attaining their maximum value, of the same order of magnitude as the total pressure rise across the pump, near the leading edge. The resulting lift on the vane, both steady and unsteady, was computed from the pressure measurements at mid vane height. The magnitude of the fluctuating lift was found to be larger than the steady lift. For the impeller of the HPOTP, pressure measurements on the front shroud of a vaned and a vaneless diffuser showed that the front shroud pressure fluctuations increased with the presence of the diffuser vanes. For the two-dimensional impeller, also unsteady impeller blade pressure measurements were made. The largest blade pressure fluctuations, of the same magnitude as the large pressure fluctuations on the vane suction side, occurred at the blade trailing edge. However, the dependence of those pressure fluctuations on the flow coefficient was found to be different; on the vane suction side, the fluctuations were largest for maximum flow and decreased with decreasing flow coefficient, whereas at the blade trailing edge, the fluctuations were smallest for maximum flow and increased with decreasing flow coefficient. Increasing the vane number resulted in a significant decrease of the blade pressure fluctuations. Lift, vane and blade pressure, and front shroud pressure fluctuations decreased strongly with increasing radial gap...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{influence}} of splitter blades on <b>double</b> <b>suction</b> centrifugal <b>pumps</b> two impellers with and without splitter blades were investigated numerically and experimentally. Three-dimensional turbulence simulations with and without full cavitation model were applied to simulate the flow in the two pumps with different impellers. The simulation results agreed with the experiment results and the internal flows were analyzed. Both the numerical and experimental results show that by adding splitter blades the hydraulic performance and the cavitation performance of the pump are improved. The pump efficiency is increased especially at high flow rate condition. The pump high efficiency area is extended dramatically. At the same time since the splitter blades share {{some part of the}} blade loading, the pump critical NPSH value is decreased. Obvious pressure increase and velocity decrease at blade suction surface near leading edge were observed in the pump impeller with splitter blades.

40|$|The {{water flow}} and {{movement}} of silt in a prototype <b>double</b> <b>suction</b> centrifugal <b>pump</b> was simulated using an Euler– Lagrange multiphase flow model. Back-blade and J-groove configurations were adopted {{to protect the}} impeller ring from silt abrasion. Four back-blades and four J-grooves were considered. The {{results show that the}} relative velocity of water around the impeller ring is too low to move silt out of the spacing between the impeller and the casing, which results in a high silt concentration around the impeller ring. The high silt concentration around the impeller ring is the major contributor to silt abrasion of the ring. Back-blade and J-groove configurations are effective in reducing the silt concen-tration around the ring but extra friction loss is also introduced and the pump efficiency is decreased. Optimization of the length, position and number of back-blades, and the shape and number of J-grooves, decreases losses in pump efficiency and effectively protects the impeller ring. Case 4 for the back-blade and Case 8 for the J-groove were the most effective configurations in this study...|$|R

In order to investigate the influence of inlet geometry parameters on the cavitation performance of the miniature pump, two more impellers are designed for comparison. Based on the results, the following conclusions are drawn: 1) Cavitation performance of the <b>double</b> <b>suction</b> shaft-less miniature <b>pump</b> having different impeller {{is equivalent to the}} centrifugal pump having ordinary size, though the flow passage at impeller inlet is small; 2) The miniature pump having radial impeller can produce much higher pump head, but lower cavitation performance than that having the impeller based on the conventional design method; 3) It is believed that by applying the <b>double</b> <b>suction</b> design, the miniature pump achieved relatively uniform flow pattern upstream the impeller inlet, which is favorable for improving cavitation performance...|$|R

40|$|Lecturepg. 11 In 1991, {{four large}} <b>double</b> <b>suction</b> cooling <b>pumps</b> were {{installed}} at a chemical plant in Texas. Although these pumps met performance specifications {{on the test}} stand, they proved to be noisy when installed. Sound power levels greater than 93 dbA were observed. Pumping applications involving cooling water have been especially difficult to solve over the tears, due {{to the presence of}} dissolved air inherent in a cooling tower sump. Water that contains large amounts of dissolved air changes the apparent required net positive suction head (NPSH). In such applications, traditional correction techniques failed because the entire system was not analyzed, and the source of the noise generation could not be pinpointed. This paper deals with the steps involved with obtaining a solution to this problem. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis was performed on the pump and impeller. Initial investigation revealed that the impeller was not the source of the problem. The casing inlet was then analyzed. The model indicated the presence of separation in the suction nozzle, causing a flow distortion at the impeller eye. A unique guide ring was developed to minimize the flow separation. The CFD analysis was revised to reflect the new geometry, and a significant improvement in the flow was predicted. A prototype guide ring was manufactured and installed in one of the four pumps. Pressure profiles were obtained by experiment to validate the analyses. The results are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Lecturepg. 85 A {{systematic}} {{investigation was}} started within the Texas Utilities Generating Company Power station feedwater pump systems due to unsatisfactory unit availability, frequent equipment breakdown, high maintenance costs, and high replacement parts costs. This action was greatly encouraged by successful corrective {{actions taken by}} other utilities [1, 2, 3], results of failure surveys across the U. S. A [4, 5), and systematic long range research and development, field testing and troubleshooting by the authors, and close cooperation and exchange of ideas and results with at least on oil company [6]. A total of 36 pumps was modified in the Texas Utilities system as described in this paper. This included 16 boiler feed pumps (BFP), 7 high pressure (HP) booster pumps, 6 low pressure (LP) booster pumps, and 7 other pump applications. The operating behavior of all pumps improved exactly as expected, {{with the exception of}} one high pressure booster pump, which is described as a special case, with the emphasis on the importance or re-assembly and maintenance procedures.

40|$|Lecturepg. 41 The authors present two {{case studies}} where {{improperly}} applied hydraulics resulted in poor mechanical reliability, due to chronic flow instability problems. A successful hydraulic rerate of these pumps, which required minimal modifications {{to their original}} pump casings and no modifications to the piping, drivers, or baseplates, dramatically improve their reliability and reduced annual repair costs. The first case study describes the rerate of a 4 X 6 X 13, 3560 rpm, 300 hp, single <b>suction</b> overhung <b>pump</b> and its spare, which were averaging between seven and 12 failures per year from 1990 to 1995.

Both rerates involved selecting an impeller pattern with a best efficiency point closer to actual operating conditions and an acceptable suction specific speed (Nss < 11, 000), and then modifying the pump casing to obtain the proper volute throat areas for the desired performance. The pumps in both case studies realized marked improvements in reliability {{as a result of}} the hydraulic rerates. The authors will take the readers through the rerate process, illustrating the key steps involved, and explain which types of problematic pumps qualify for this conversion. They will also clearly explain the hydraulic principles employed to give the readers insight into the design process.

40|$|Abstract Awell-developed <b>suction</b> <b>pump</b> in {{the head}} repre-sents an {{important}} adaptation for nectar-feeding insects, such as Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera and Diptera. This pumping organ creates a pressure gradient along the proboscis, {{which is responsible for}} nectar uptake. The extremely elongated proboscis of the genus Prosoeca (Nemestrinidae) evolved as an adaptation to feeding from long, tubular flowers. According to the functional constraint hypothesis, nectar up-take through a disproportionately elongated, straw-like pro-boscis increases flower handling time and consequently lowers the energy intake rate. Due to the conspicuous length variation of the proboscis of Prosoeca, individuals with lon-ger proboscides are hypothesised to have longer handling times. To test this hypothesis, we used field video analyses of flower-visiting behaviour, detailed examinations of the <b>suction</b> <b>pump</b> morphology and correlations of proboscis length with body length and <b>suction</b> <b>pump</b> dimensions. Using a biomechanical framework described for nectar-feeding Lepidoptera in relation to proboscis length and suc-tion pumpmusculature, we describe and contrast the system in long-proboscid flies. Flies with longer proboscides spent sig-nificantly more time drinking from flowers. In addition, pro-boscis length and body length showed a positive allometric relationship. Furthermore, adaptations of the <b>suction</b> <b>pump</b> included an allometric relationship between proboscis length and <b>suction</b> <b>pump</b> muscle volume and a combination of two pumping organs. Overall, the study gives detailed insight into the adaptations required for long-proboscid nectar feeding, and comparisons with other nectar-sucking insects allow fur-ther considerations of the evolution of the <b>suction</b> <b>pump</b> in insects with sucking mouthparts...|$|R
