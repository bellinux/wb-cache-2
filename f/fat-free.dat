5|$|Initially, Sanders and KFC used {{hydrogenated}} {{vegetable oil}} for frying, {{but in the}} 1980s the company began to switch to cheaper oils such as palm or soybean. In the 2000s {{it became apparent that}} these oils contain relatively high levels of trans fat, which increases the risk of heart disease. By April 2007, the chain had switched to trans <b>fat-free</b> soybean oil in all of its US outlets.|$|E

25|$|In 2005, Tiburon, California, {{became the}} first American city where all {{restaurants}} voluntarily cook with trans <b>fat-free</b> oils. In 2007, Montgomery County, Maryland, approved a ban on partially hydrogenated oils, becoming the first county {{in the nation to}} restrict trans fats.|$|E
25|$|Some {{companies}} have also marketed baked potato chips {{as an alternative}} with lower fat content. Additionally, some varieties of <b>fat-free</b> chips have been made using artificial, and indigestible, fat substitutes. These became {{well known in the}} media when an ingredient many contained, Olestra, was linked in some individuals to abdominal discomfort and loose stools.|$|E
25|$|However, when {{partially}} hydrogenated, {{part of the}} unsaturated {{fatty acids}} become unhealthy trans fats. Consumers are increasingly avoiding products that contain trans fats, and governments have begun to ban trans fats in food products. These regulations and market pressures have spurred the development of low-α-linolenic acid soybeans. These new soybean varieties yield a more stable oil that doesn't require hydrogenation for many applications, thus providing trans <b>fat-free</b> products, such as frying oil.|$|E
25|$|Some potato chip {{companies}} {{have responded to}} the criticism by investing in research and development to modify existing recipes and create health-conscious products. Kettle Foods was founded in 1978 and currently sells only trans <b>fat–free</b> products, including potato chips. PepsiCo research shows that about 80% of salt on chips is not sensed by the tongue before being swallowed. Frito-Lay spent $414 million in 2009 on product development, including development of salt crystals that would reduce the salt content of Lay's potato chips without adversely affecting flavor.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. federal {{government}} document Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010 recommends consumption of three glasses of <b>fat-free</b> or low-fat milk {{for adults and}} children 9 and older (less for younger children) per day. This recommendation is disputed by some health researchers who call for more study of the issue, given {{that there are other}} sources for calcium and vitamin D. The researchers also claim that the recommendations have been unduly influenced by the American dairy industry, and that whole milk may be better for health due to its increased ability to satiate hunger.|$|E
25|$|Elevated {{cholesterol}} levels {{are treated with}} a strict diet consisting of low saturated fat, trans <b>fat-free,</b> low cholesterol foods, often followed by one of various hypolipidemic agents, such as statins, fibrates, cholesterol absorption inhibitors, nicotinic acid derivatives or bile acid sequestrants. Extreme cases have previously been treated with partial ileal bypass surgery, which has now been superseded by medication. Apheresis-based treatments are still used for very severe hyperlipidemias that are either unresponsive to treatment or require rapid lowering of blood lipids. There are several international guidelines on the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fat-free</b> (defatted) {{soybean meal}} is a {{significant}} and cheap source of protein for animal feeds and many packaged meals. For example, soybean products, such as textured vegetable protein (TVP), are ingredients in many meat and dairy substitutes. The beans contain significant amounts of phytic acid, dietary minerals and B vitamins. Soy vegetable oil, used in food and industrial applications, is another product of processing the soybean crop. Traditional non-fermented food uses of soybeans include soy milk from which tofu and tofu skin are made. Fermented soy foods include soy sauce, fermented bean paste, natto and tempeh.|$|E

2500|$|In 1990, Dairy Queen began {{offering}} frozen yogurt as a lower-calorie alternative to its soft serve ice cream. [...] According {{to a company}} representative, Dairy Queen's regular soft serve has 35 calories per ounce and is 95% <b>fat-free,</b> whereas the frozen yogurt was 25 calories per ounce. [...] However, in 2001, the company phased out the frozen yogurt option in all its stores, citing a lack of demand.|$|E
2500|$|Both the fat {{globules}} and {{the smaller}} casein micelles, which are just large enough to deflect light, contribute to the opaque white color of milk. The fat globules contain some yellow-orange carotene, enough in some breeds (such as Guernsey and Jersey cattle) to impart a golden or [...] "creamy" [...] hue to a glass of milk. The riboflavin in the whey portion of milk has a greenish color, which sometimes can be discerned in skimmed milk or whey products. <b>Fat-free</b> skimmed milk has only the casein micelles to scatter light, {{and they tend to}} scatter shorter-wavelength blue light more than they do red, giving skimmed milk a bluish tint.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{research}} suggests that soft drinks could play a special role in weight gain. One four-week experiment compared a 450 calorie/day supplement of sugar-sweetened soft drinks to a 450 calorie/day supplement of jelly beans. The jelly bean supplement {{did not lead to}} weight gain, but the soft drink supplement did. The likely reason for the difference in weight gain is that people who consumed the jelly beans lowered their caloric intake at subsequent meals, while people who consumed soft drinks did not. Thus, the low levels of satiety provided by sugar-sweetened soft drinks may explain their association with obesity. That is, people who consume calories in sugar-sweetened beverages may fail to adequately reduce their intake of calories from other sources. Indeed, people consume more total calories in meals and on days when they are given sugar-sweetened beverages than when they are given artificially sweetened beverages or water. However, these results are contradicted by a study by Adam Drewnowski published in 2004, in which [...] "32 subjects consumed a 300-calorie snack of <b>fat-free</b> raspberry cookies or regular cola on two occasions each – either two hours ("early") or 20 minutes ("late") before lunch." [...] It found that [...] "...the calories eaten at lunch were not affected by whether the snack was cookies or cola." ...|$|E

50|$|Moderate {{exercise}} before BIA measurements {{lead to an}} overestimation of <b>fat-free</b> {{mass and}} an underestimation of body fat percentage due to reduced impedance.

Therefore, it is recommended not to perform BIA for several hours after moderate or high intensity exercise.|$|E
