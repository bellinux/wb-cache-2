25|$|The {{spontaneous}} {{emergence of}} the Gacaca activities and the gradual support for Gacaca by the authorities was clearly motivated {{by the fact that}} the ordinary justice system was virtually non-existent after the genocide. The Gacaca <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> it did before—relieve the pressure on the ordinary courts. These were now not working slowly, as they did before, but not working at all. Once they started to work, they were quickly overloaded with the cases of genocide suspects who were filling the prisons. This new form of justice was bold, but not unprecedented: This becomes evident when one considers the emerging numbers of Truth and Reconciliation Commissions (TRC) as, for example, that in South Africa. The slogan of the South African TRC “Revealing is Healing” and its argument that truth-telling serves as a “therapeutic function” underline this assumption. The TRC format was suggested to the Rwandan government, but ultimately they chose to pursue mass justice through Gacaca; a system where their country had roots and familiarity.|$|E

[...] While she {{appreciated}} the [...] "realism and authenticity that Grey's is known for", she found the episode was [...] "almost too much" [...] as it was [...] "extremely gory and difficult to watch, initially because of the grisly wounds" [...] but later because of the [...] "heavy and emotional things that transpired". She thought Pompeo gave one of her best performances when her character learned that her sister was dead. Digital Spy Ben Lee found Leigh's and Dane's performances [...] "phenomenal" [...] and added that he had probably never seen a better performance from Dane. He described the moment the two actors shared as [...] "truly poignant". To him, Lexie's death felt like a finale, which was thus too early. As for {{what was happening in}} Seattle Grace, he thought it was [...] "a bit pointless" [...] and [...] "uninteresting" [...] except Altman's departure, which he deemed [...] "the most significant moment at the hospital". Entertainment Weekly Tanner Stransky commented of Lexie's death: [...] "It was an intense death. I mean, how awful was it to watch one of Grey’s longest-running characters pass away so quickly -- and rather unceremoniously? I get that Ms. Rhimes <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> she had to do -- and every show needs to be shaken up once in a while -- but I don't love that Lexie was the one to die. Could it have been someone less important somehow? I guess it would have been too obvious to do Kepner. And you probably just don't kill off a hottie like Mark Sloan, right?" [...] Stransky also complained about Robbins' screams {{at the beginning of the}} episode, but enjoyed Bailey's story.|$|E

2500|$|After Jackson {{retired in}} 2011, Buss {{explicitly}} told coaching candidates Brian Shaw and Mike Brown that Bynum needed {{to receive the}} ball inside. Shaw was passed over as Jackson's replacement although the Lakers assistant was openly supported by players. Buss instead hired Brown without consulting their star player, Kobe Bryant. He later {{said it was a}} mistake to not involve Bryant. Shaw was not bitter that the Lakers went with Brown, but he was disappointed that after 12 years of service, they did not contact him until three weeks after their decision. The well-respected Shaw atypically criticized Buss in a radio interview over his treatment during the hiring cycle. The offseason also included the NBA player lockout, during which the Lakers let go of nearly two dozen employees with a combined 100 years of experience from the basketball operations staff. Assistant General Manager Ronnie Lester, whose contract was not renewed after 24 years with the team, said [...] "great organizations don't treat their personnel like they've done." [...] CBSSports.com wrote that NBA executives are typically discreet, and Lester's public criticism [...] "shows how strongly he feels the Lakers were in the wrong here". Buss feared the season would be cancelled, and said that [...] "we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> we had to do. It’s not fun; there’s no question about that." [...] The lockout ended in the winter of 2011.|$|E

It was so hard for me to look at myself and find something that I liked. Not just physically, but something that was good in me". She also inflicted self-harm, banging her head against the wall when feeling unattractive. She traced her fragility to her abusive marriage to recording artist James DeBarge when she was 16 years old. Jackson recalled, [...] "It all has to do with very low self esteem. Especially going into a relationship like that very young... someone telling you things like, 'no one is ever going to want you again, you should be happy here with me.'" [...] Attempting to alter his behavior and drug addiction, she explained, [...] "I learned the hard way that you can't change a person." [...] Recalling her divorce, she revealed, [...] "There came a point when I finally said, 'You know what? I just don't care what happens.' I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> I wanted to but had been too afraid to. And at that point I didn't care if I got my brains beat out. I just went ahead and did it.

2500|$|In May 2007, Cashis {{released}} the eight-track The County Hound EP {{in an attempt}} to have people [...] "fiend" [...] for his music, or garner interest in it. The album was released as a limited edition EP. September saw the release of 50 Cent's third album with the label, Curtis, which was involved in a well publicized competition with rapper Kanye West, who had his third album, Graduation set for release on the same day. In June 2008, Obie Trice departed from the label. A misunderstanding was made where it was believed he was attacking the label and Eminem on a single titled [...] "The Giant" [...] but they were quickly dismissed. In a statement, Paul Rosenberg stated [...] "Shady Records has agreed to allow Obie Trice to pursue his craft in a different forum free from the constraints of the current major label model [...] Eminem will continue to support and work with Obie on many levels of his career [...] He remains a close friend and member of the Shady family." [...] In a 2012 interview, Obie opened up on the topic, admitting having issues with Interscope Records chairman Jimmy Iovine, which was Trice's fault, clarifying [...] "I was kind of reckless, not on time, certain things and [...] didn't want to further the project with me so we tried to work it out but it just didn’t come to a head so I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> I had to do," [...] before going on to note that his relationship with the label is great, and he continues to work with Eminem, notably on Bottoms Up, which was to be released originally on Shady Records.|$|E

2500|$|Three days {{following}} his rescue in the Gran Sasso raid, Mussolini {{was taken to}} Germany {{for a meeting with}} Hitler in Rastenburg at his East Prussian headquarters. Despite public professions of support, Hitler was clearly shocked by Mussolini's disheveled and haggard appearance as well as his unwillingness to go after the men in Rome who overthrew him. Feeling that he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> he could to blunt the edges of Nazi repression, Mussolini agreed to set up a new regime, the Italian Social Republic ( [...] , RSI), informally known as the Salò Republic because of its administration from the town of Salò where he settled in just 11 days after his rescue by the Germans. Mussolini's new regime faced numerous territorial losses: in addition to losing the Italian lands held by the Allies and Badoglio's government, the provinces of Bolzano, Belluno and Trento were placed under German administration in the Operational Zone of the Alpine Foothills, while the provinces of Udine, Gorizia, Trieste, Pola (now Pula), Fiume (now Rijeka) and Ljubljana (Lubiana in Italian) were incorporated into the German Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral."In addition to my... order of the commander of the Greater German Reich in Italy and the organisation of the occupied Italian area from 10 September 1943 I determine:The supreme commanders in the Operational Zone Adriatic Coast consisting of the provinces of Friaul, Görz, Triest, Istrien, Fiume, Quarnero, Laibach, and in the Prealpine Operations Zone consisting of the provinces of Bozen, Trient and Belluno receive the fundamental instructions for their activity from me.

Italy's gains in Greece and Albania were also lost to Germany, {{with the exception of the}} Italian Aegean Islands, which remained nominally under RSI rule. Mussolini opposed any territorial reductions of the Italian state and told his associates:I am not here to renounce even a square meter of state territory. We will go back to war for this. And we will rebel against anyone for this. Where the Italian flag flew, the Italian flag will return. And where it has not been lowered, now that I am here, no one will have it lowered. I have said these things to the Führer.|$|E
