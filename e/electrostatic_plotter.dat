5000|$|An <b>{{electrostatic}}</b> <b>plotter</b> {{is a type}} of plotter {{that draws}} images on paper with an electrostatic process. They are most frequently used for Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE), producing raster images via either a Liquid Toner or a Dry Toner model.|$|E
5000|$|Electrostatic {{plotters}} {{can print}} {{in black and}} white or in color. Some models handle paper sizes up to six feet wide. Newer versions are large-format laser printers and focus light onto a charged drum using lasers or LEDs. The image quality produced by some electrostatic plotters was lower than that of contemporary pen plotters, but the increased speed and economy made them useful. Unlike a pen plotter, the plot time of a rasterized <b>electrostatic</b> <b>plotter</b> was independent of the level of detail of the image. [...] Modern electrostatic color plotters are found in the short run graphics industry, printing on a variety of paper or plastic film surfaces.|$|E
40|$|IMAPS (Interactive Minicomputer Array Processing System) is {{a system}} of {{minicomputer}} software for processing large, two-dimensional arrays of gridded data such as those employed in the earth sciences, particularly remote sensing of the environment. IMAPS was designed to have wide applicability based on {{the flexibility of the}} software and its modest hardware requirements. Written in Fortran and operating in an interactive, single-user mode, the system provides a variety of array processing functions. These functions presently include routines for reading and calibrating LANDSAT and NOAA satellite data tapes, statistically summarizing array regions and transects, generating contrast-enhanced images via line printer or <b>electrostatic</b> <b>plotter,</b> and converting data from contoured to gridded format. Users having specialized needs can add their own functions to the system; this can be done without increasing core requirements inasmuch as each function is organized as a separate overlay. The design of new functions is facilitated by the availability of a library of utility subroutines, which perform tasks commonly required in array processing, such as buffering array data to and from disc. The data buffering subroutines are quite flexible, allowing variable array size, processing of from 2 to 10 arrays in parallel, and sequential or random access to individual array elements. IMAPS is currently implemented on Coastal Studies Institute 2 Ì† 7 s Nova 1220 minicomputer in support of programs in deltaic sedimentation and remote sensing of coastal waters. The basic system requires a 16 -bit minicomputer with 32 K words of core memory, console, and disc; optional devices include magnetic tape, line printer, digitizer, and <b>electrostatic</b> <b>plotter...</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Electrostatic</b> <b>plotters</b> {{were known}} {{in the early days}} of {{computer}} graphics; by 1967, several manufacturers commercially supplied <b>electrostatic</b> <b>plotters.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Electrostatic</b> <b>plotters</b> used a dry toner {{transfer}} process {{similar to}} that in many photocopiers. They were faster than pen plotters and were available in large formats, suitable for reproducing engineering drawings. The quality of image was often not as good as contemporary pen <b>plotters.</b> <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>plotters</b> were made in both flat-bed and drum types.|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} is quoted from UT78:Calma's computer-aided design and drafting systems (also {{referred to as}} interactive graphics systems) are [...] component hardware modules, electronic interfaces, and software programs. Most of the systems sold are constructed by combining available components {{to meet the requirements}} of the customers' specific design or drafting application. Calma's systems enable customers to automate a wide variety of design and manufacturing processes which have previously been performed manually.The primary hardware components of a system are a central processing unit, operator stations and plotter outputs.Their GDS I and II software operated on Data General Corporation's Nova and Eclipse line of 16 bit mini Computers. Sketches or layouts of electronic system were first manually drawn on mylar or paper to scale and were placed on large backlit 48 by 60 inch table digitizers. Using a moving stylus, these layouts were organized in layers, first placing the smaller common and custom circuits, created in a library, then manually traced their interconnecting circuitry on further layers, the completed layout then stored in computer files. Printed Circuit Boards (PCB's) and Small Scale Integrated Circuits (SSIC) were manually traced buy an operator, usually a draftsman or electronic engineer then plotted on a large pen plotter (In later years to faster <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>Plotters)</b> to be visually inspected to confirm that the physical layout properly matched the schematic. Once the layout and schematics final edits were manually checked to confirm their accuracy, the multiple layers of the physical circuitry were sent to a film plotter to create masks for fabrication.The central processing unit consists of a minicomputer, a computer console and page printer, a magnetic tape transport and a magnetic disk memory unit.Other optional peripheral devices such as card readers and paper tape punches are also available. These components are interfaced with Calma-designed and manufactured controllers, and integrated into a single unit with system software designed and programmed by Calma.An operator station consists of a digitizing device, an interactive cathode ray tube (CRT) display unit, coordinate readouts and a keyboard. The main difference between stations is in the type of digitizing input station used. The Calma digitizer is a backlit 48 by 60 inch table. To digitize analog graphical data directly on computer-compatible medium, the operator of the digitizer manually traces graphical data with a moveable stylus. The graphic tablet has a smaller surface and is operated with an electromechanical graphic pen and were used primary to edit an electronic layout once it was digitized.The digitizing input station is linked by system software to the CRT display, which allows an almost instantaneous display of any segment of the source drawing or a graphic element from the library. The CRT display also has windowing and magnification capability.An alphanumeric keyboard is used for entering text, scaling information, dimensions and commands, and an optional functional keyboard is available for entering frequently used functions, symbols and macro commands.The output most commonly used in Calma's systems is a graphic plotter. Calma software supports both on and off-line pen and photo plotting devices.Calma's computer-aided design systems are used {{in a wide variety of}} applications. To date systems have been sold principally to electronics firms for use in the design of integrated circuits, printed circuit boards and electrical schematics; to governmental agencies and public utilities for use in cartographic applications; and to manufacturing companies for use in the design of mechanical parts and systems.|$|R
