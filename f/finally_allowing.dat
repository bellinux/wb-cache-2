25|$|The HS1 {{line was}} {{finished}} {{on time and}} under budget. The reduction in journey times and increase in reliability achieved through the opening of Section 1 enabled Eurostar to capture 71% of the total London–Paris market and over 80% of the leisure market and Section 2 has increased these figures further. Additionally, the connections provided to the WCML, MML and ECML by Section 2 may see growth of hitherto marginal markets, by <b>finally</b> <b>allowing</b> Regional Eurostars to operate, {{at least on the}} electrified ECML and WCML. Eurostar's chief executive stated that the company believes it can take 50% market share even on 4½-hour journeys, a journey time that would put Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds within reach of mainland Europe.|$|E

2500|$|One element {{which is}} crucial {{to the success of the}} GRR model is the notion related to 'instructional scaffolding', which is {{grounded}} in Vygotsky's concept of the [...] "zone of proximal development" [...] (ZPD). [...] This is described as the distance between the actual developmental level of a learner as determined by their independent problem solving abilities and the level of potential development through problem-solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers. That is, the distance between what the children can do without assistance and what they can accomplish with the assistance of more capable peers. The zone of proximal development can be applied as an umbrella over the entire GRR model. Students are given support in the form of scaffolding and differentiate instruction throughout all four phases of the process. Teachers may offer more challenging material to high-achieving students, and assist lower-achieving students in needs-based groups. Teachers will support students as needed throughout all four steps <b>finally</b> <b>allowing</b> for the eventual independence of each student. The GRR model [...] "...assumes that [...] will need some guidance in reaching that stage of independence and that it is precisely the teacher's role to provide such guidance".|$|E
2500|$|The {{spinning}} frame or water frame {{was developed by}} Richard Arkwright who, along with two partners, patented it in 1769. The design was partly based on a spinning machine built for Thomas High by clockmaker John Kay, who was hired by Arkwright. [...] For each spindle, the water frame used a series of four pairs of rollers, each operating at a successively higher rotating speed, to draw out the fibre, which was then twisted by the spindle. [...] The roller spacing was slightly longer than the fibre length. [...] Too close a spacing caused the fibres to break while too distant a spacing caused uneven thread. [...] The top rollers were leather-covered and loading on the rollers was applied by a weight. [...] The weights kept the twist from backing up before the rollers. The bottom rollers were wood and metal, with fluting along the length. [...] The water frame was able to produce a hard, medium count thread suitable for warp, <b>finally</b> <b>allowing</b> 100% cotton cloth {{to be made in}} Britain. [...] A horse powered the first factory to use the {{spinning frame}}. Arkwright and his partners used water power at a factory in Cromford, Derbyshire in 1771, giving the invention its name.|$|E
