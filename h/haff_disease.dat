40|$|Background:Toxic {{contamination}} of fish may compromise food safety. <b>Haff</b> <b>disease</b> {{is a rare}} syndrome characterized by rhabdomyolysis following consumption of cooked, freshwater fish. Case Report: A healthy 42 year old female presented three hours after eating fried buffalo fish (Ictiobus cyprinellis). Her symptoms began while eating the fish, described as diffuse muscle aches followed by generalized muscle fatigue, most pronounced in her proximal lower extremities. Vital signs were normal. Her physical exam was notable for diffuse muscle tenderness and difficulty standing. Baseline complete blood count and chemistries were normal, but serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) was 12, 777 U/L. Alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were 268 U/L and 1431 U/L respectively. She was treated with aggressive hydration, sodium bicarbonate, and oral N-acetylcysteine. The serum CPK peaked at 76, 364 U/L, twenty hours post-exposure. Her creatinine remained normal. Over the next 5 days the CPK slowly resolved. Discussion: <b>Haff</b> <b>disease</b> is a rare syndrome characterized by rhabdomyolysis following consumption of certain cooked, freshwater fish. Although the exact toxin {{has yet to be}} identified, this disorder is felt to be caused by a heat-stable toxin contaminating certain fish. Our case was unique due to the immediate onset of symptoms and the extremely high serum CPK levels. Conclusion: <b>Haff</b> <b>disease</b> may result in the rapid onset of severe rhabdomyolysis. Aggressive treatment with fluids and bicarbonate prevented renal damage in this case. Because cases may occur outside of endemic areas, fish consumption {{should be included in the}} history for any case of rhabomyolysis of unknown etiology. Suspected cases of <b>Haff</b> <b>disease</b> should be reported to local public health authorities and samples collected for analysis...|$|E
40|$|<b>Haff</b> <b>disease</b> {{is a rare}} {{syndrome}} of unexplained myalgia and rhabdomyolysis occurring within 24 h {{of consumption}} of certain types of cooked freshwater fish or crustacean. It {{is caused by a}} yet unidentified heat-stable toxin. In the present review of published case studies and official press releases, the main objective is to report the emergence and epidemiology of <b>Haff</b> <b>disease</b> in China. <b>Haff</b> <b>disease</b> first occurred in Beijing in 2000 and in Lianzhou and Liannan, Guangdong Province in 2009. Subsequent outbreaks mostly occurred in the Jiangsu Province—Nanjing, Yangzhou, Huai’an, and Yancheng. Isolated outbreaks occurred in other cities since 2010 —Shijiazhuang, Yueyang, Shanghai, Wuhu, Baoding, Shenzhen, and Hong Kong (imported cases from Shenzhen). Outbreaks occurred predominately in the summer. Crayfish accounted for almost all the outbreaks. Two large outbreaks occurred in Lianzhou and Liannan in 2009 (n = 54) after eating pomfrets and in Nanjing in 2010 (n = 42) after eating crayfish. Other reports or outbreaks involved only 1 – 9 subjects (median 2 subjects). Variability in individual susceptibility and attack rates were noted, with many subjects remaining asymptomatic despite sharing the same seafood meal as the index cases. Adults were predominately involved. Symptoms occurred within 3 – 20 h of seafood ingestion, including myalgia, weakness, and, less frequently, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Myalgia and muscle weakness should normally subside within 2 – 3 days. Serum creatine phosphokinase became normal within 5 – 6 days. Abnormal renal function was uncommon. Serious complications (renal failure, multi-organ failure, and prolonged myopathy) and death were rare. In any subjects with unexplained myalgia and rhabdomyolysis, seafood consumption {{should be included in the}} history. All suspected cases of <b>Haff</b> <b>disease,</b> including milder presentations, should be reported to public health authorities...|$|E
