5|$|Terrified, the {{engineer}} {{jumps into the}} chemical plant's waste pound lock to escape Batman and is swept through a pipe leading to the outside. Once outside, he discovers to his horror that the chemicals have permanently bleached his skin chalk-white, stained his lips ruby-red and dyed his hair bright green. The engineer's disfigurement, compounded {{with the loss of}} his family, drives <b>him</b> <b>completely</b> insane and marks the birth of the Joker.|$|E

5|$|In 1325, EdwardII {{was faced}} with a demand from his brother-in-law, Charles IV of France, to perform homage for the English Duchy of Aquitaine. Edward was {{reluctant}} to leave the country, as discontent was once again brewing domestically, particularly over his relationship with the favourite Hugh Despenser the Younger. Instead, he had his son Edward created Duke of Aquitaine in his place and sent him to France to perform the homage. The young Edward was accompanied by his mother Isabella, who was the sister of King Charles, and was meant to negotiate a peace treaty with the French. While in France, Isabella conspired with the exiled Roger Mortimer to have Edward deposed. To build up diplomatic and military support for the venture, Isabella had Prince Edward engaged to the twelve-year-old Philippa of Hainault. An invasion of England was launched and EdwardII's forces deserted <b>him</b> <b>completely.</b> The king was forced to relinquish the throne to his son on 25 January 1327. The new king was crowned as EdwardIII on 1 February 1327.|$|E

5|$|Neglected in her {{relationship}} with the once-human Manhattan, whose now-godlike powers and transformation have removed <b>him</b> <b>completely</b> from the everyday concerns of living beings and no longer kept on retainer by the government, Juspeczyk stays with Dreiberg; they begin a romance, don their costumes, and resume vigilante work as they grow closer together. With Dreiberg starting to believe some aspects of Rorschach's conspiracy theory, the pair take {{it upon themselves to}} break him out of prison. Manhattan, after looking back on his own personal history, places the fate of his involvement with human affairs in Juspeczyk's hands. He teleports her to Mars {{to make the case for}} emotional investment. During the course of the argument, Juspeczyk is forced to come to terms with the fact that Blake, who once attempted to rape her mother, was in fact her biological father following a second, consensual relationship. This discovery, reflecting the complexity of human emotions and relationships, re-sparks Manhattan's interest in humanity.|$|E
5|$|In 1924 Walpole {{moved into}} a house near Keswick in the Lake District. His large income enabled him to {{maintain}} his London flat in Piccadilly, but Brackenburn, {{on the slopes of}} Catbells overlooking Derwentwater, was his main home {{for the rest of his}} life. He was quickly made welcome by local residents, and the scenery and atmosphere of the Lake District often found their way into his fiction. The critic James Agate commented that one might think from some of Walpole's stories that their author had created the English Lakes, but that he was probably only consulted about them. At the end of 1924 Walpole met Harold Cheevers, who soon became his friend and companion and remained so for the rest of Walpole's life. In Hart-Davis's words, he came nearer than any other human being to Walpole's long-sought conception of a perfect friend. Cheevers, a policeman, with a wife and two children, left the police force and entered Walpole's service as his chauffeur. Walpole trusted <b>him</b> <b>completely,</b> and gave him extensive control over his affairs. Whether Walpole was at Brackenburn or Piccadilly, Cheevers was almost always with him, and often accompanied him on overseas trips. Walpole provided a house in Hampstead for Cheevers and his family.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} side, Frederick {{commanded}} 27 battalions of infantry (17,000 men) and 43 squadrons of cavalry (5,000 horse), plus 72 companies of artillery, {{for a total}} of 22,000 men. He also had several of the siege guns from Leipzig, which arrived late in the morning. He spent the morning watching the French from the Goldacker manor rooftop in Rossbach. The initial stages of Allied movement convinced him that the Allies had started retreating southward towards their magazines; he sent out patrols to learn from the peasants what could be gleaned. They reported back that Soubise had taken the Weissenfels road; it led not only to that village, but also toward Freiburg, where Soubise could find supplies, or to Merseburg, where they would cut the Prussians off from the Saale. At about noon Frederick went to dinner, leaving the young captain Friedrich Wilhelm von Gaudi to observe French movements. Two hours later, his watch captain reported the French approaching. Although Gaudi's excited report at first appeared to confirm a French-Austrian retreat, Frederick observed that Allied columns, which from time to time became visible in the undulations of the ground, appeared to turn eastwards from Zeuchfeld. When Frederick saw for himself that hostile cavalry and infantry were already approaching Pettstädt, he realized his enemy's intentions: to attack him in the flank and rear, and break his communications line, if not crush <b>him</b> <b>completely.</b> They now offered him the battle for which he had maneuvered in vain, and he accepted it without hesitation.|$|E

25|$|In 1965, Buñuel {{manage to}} work again with Sylvia Pinal in what {{would turn out to}} be his last Mexican feature, co-starring Claudio Brook, Simón del desierto.

25|$|When Gladstone came to {{know him}} in later years, he was {{astonished}} to find that Parnell was ignorant even of the basic facts of Irish history.

25|$|That Arthur {{had gone}} unmentioned in the source closest {{to his own}} time, Gildas, was noticed at least {{as early as the}} 12th century hagiography that claims that Gildas had praised Arthur {{extensively}} but then excised <b>him</b> <b>completely</b> after Arthur killed the saint's brother, Hueil mab Caw. Modern writers have suggested the details of the battle were so well known that Gildas could have expected his audience to be familiar with them.|$|E
25|$|He {{was tried}} at St Albans {{by the council}} of war in December, was {{pronounced}} guilty of having surrendered the place improperly, and sentenced to death. He was, however, pardoned, and the facility with which Bristol subsequently capitulated to the parliamentary army induced Cromwell and the generals to exonerate <b>him</b> <b>completely.</b> His military career nevertheless now came to an end. He went abroad, and it was some time before he reappeared on the political scene.|$|E
25|$|He had {{abandoned}} public life {{because of a}} quarrel with Wenceslav IV, which was mainly over {{the matter of the}} Popes of Avignon. Jan was still loyal to Pope Urban VI, to whom the king was not. In 1384 he left his chancellor post. The quarrel with the king removed <b>him</b> <b>completely</b> from political life, and he retired to his castle and abandoned the post of archbishop on 2 July 1396. He was succeeded as archbishop by Olbram ze Škvorce.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Howe {{launched}} his campaign against Washington, though his initial {{efforts to bring}} him to battle in June 1777 failed. Howe declined to attack Philadelphia overland via New Jersey, or by sea via the Delaware Bay, even though both options would have enabled him to assist Burgoyne if necessary. Instead, he took his army on a time-consuming route through the Chesapeake Bay, leaving <b>him</b> <b>completely</b> unable to assist Burgoyne. This decision was so difficult to understand, Howe's critics accused him of treason.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the third}} repulse on March 16, Lieutenant Commander Smith's health failed <b>him</b> <b>completely,</b> {{and he turned}} command over to Lieutenant Commander James P. Foster.

They were temporarily persuaded to try again when they met reinforcements for the Army, but they resumed their retreat when the new army commander, Brigadier General Isaac F. Quinby, saw the futility of further attacks. The entire force had returned by April 12, and the expedition was over.|$|E

25|$|Afterwards, Thompson {{returned}} to a life as a land owner, but soon financial misfortune would ruin him. By 1831 he was so deeply in debt {{he was forced to}} take up a position as a surveyor for the British American Land Company to provide for his family. His luck continued to worsen and he was forced to move in with his daughter and son-in-law in 1845. He began work on a manuscript chronicling his life exploring the continent, but this project was left unfinished when his sight failed <b>him</b> <b>completely</b> in 1851.|$|E
25|$|Elements of the {{suspicious}} Clan {{did not trust}} <b>him</b> <b>completely,</b> as {{he was not a}} member of the IRB and held views they considered too moderate, although others such as John Quinn regarded him as extreme. Devoy, initially hostile to Casement for his part in conceding control of the Irish Volunteers to John Redmond, was won over in June, and another Clan leader, Joseph McGarrity, became devoted to Casement and remained so from then on. The Howth gun-running in late July 1914, which Casement had helped to organise and finance, further enhanced his reputation.|$|E
