25|$|<b>Histogram</b> <b>equalization</b> {{is useful}} in {{enhancing}} contrast within an image. This technique is used to increase local contrast. At {{the end of the}} processing, areas that were dark in the input image would be brightened, greatly enhancing the contrast among the features present in the area. On the other hand, brighter areas in the input image would remain bright or be reduced in brightness to equalize with the other areas in the image. Besides vessel segmentation, other features related to diabetic retinopathy can be further separated by using this pre-processing technique. Microaneurysm and hemorrhages are red lesions, whereas exudates are yellow spots. Increasing contrast between these two groups allow better visualization of lesions on images.

50|$|Modifications of {{this method}} use {{multiple}} histograms, called subhistograms, to emphasize local contrast, rather than overall contrast. Examples of such methods include adaptive <b>histogram</b> <b>equalization,</b> contrast limiting adaptive <b>histogram</b> <b>equalization</b> or CLAHE, multipeak <b>histogram</b> <b>equalization</b> (MPHE), and multipurpose beta optimized bihistogram equalization (MBOBHE).

50|$|There are {{two ways}} to think about and {{implement}} <b>histogram</b> <b>equalization,</b> either as image change or as palette change.

This work exploresthe possibility of using visual cryptography without pixel expansion for imparting privacy to biometric data such as fingerprint images, iris codes, and face images.

In this research we aim to overcome this shortcoming using a new method of pre-processing of true-color imagery taken under water based on the Contrast Limited Adaptive <b>Histogram</b> image <b>Equalization</b> (CLAHE) algorithm. CLAHE assumes that the distribution function of the pixel intensity values of an underwater-recorded image is dominated by Rayleigh scattering, and that the noise can be removed as a function hereof. Results showed that after applying the CLAHE image enhancement method registration success of SIFT increased by 41 % compared to reference method (a straightforward contrast stretching enhancement). From the ANOVA results follows that the null hypothesis can be rejected and concluded that there is a significant difference among SIFT without enhancement, SIFT with contrast stretching and SIFT with CLAHE-Rayleigh at 5 % level of significance (ANOVA, F= 23. 41, df= 2, p-value= 7. 34 e- 09). The finding concludes that CLAHE-Rayleigh is better compared to contrast stretching. As a follow-up study, CLAHE-Rayleigh should be compared with other image enhancement techniques (or a combination of techniques ‘hybrids’) to assess their relative impact on the success of SIFT-based image matching of underwater photography...|$|R
5000|$|This is {{the method}} used for remote sensing the {{disasters}}. Detection of disasters such as floods, earthquakes, and explosions are quite complex in previous days and range of detection is inappropriate. But, it came to possibilities by using Multi temporal visualization of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. But to obtain the good SAR images perfect spatial registration and very precise calibration are necessary to specify changes that have occurred. Calibration of SAR is very complex and also a sensitive problem. Possibly errors may occur after calibration that involves data fusion and visualization process. Traditional image pre-processing cannot be used here due to the on-Gaussian of radar back scattering, but a processing method called [...] "cross calibration/normalization" [...] is used to solve this problem. The application generates a single disaster image called [...] "fast-ready disaster map" [...] from multitemporal SAR images. These maps are generated without user interaction and helps in providing immediate first aid to the people. This process also provides image enhancement and comparison between numerous images using data fusion and visualization process.

40|$|Whenever multitemporal {{synthetic}} aperture radar (SAR) images are available, precise calibration and perfect spatial registration are required to obtain a useful image for displaying changes that have occurred. SAR calibration {{is a very complex}} and sensitive problem; some errors may persist after calibration that interfere with subsequent steps in the data fusion and visualization process. Because of the strong histogram asymmetry of SAR images, due to the well-known non-Gaussian model of radar backscattering, traditional image preprocessing procedures cannot be used here. A novel specific preprocessing phase, the so-called “cross-calibration/normalization,” is proposed to solve this problem. This, in turn, facilitates image enhancement and the numerical comparison of different image takes together with data fusion and visualization processes. The proposed processing chain includes filtering, <b>histogram</b> truncation, and <b>equalization</b> steps applied in an adaptive way to the images in question. The design of the method and the experimental procedure is based on images from the Italian Cosmo/Skymed mission. Both Stripmap and Spotlight images are taken into account to test the algorithms at different spatial resolutions. This paper also presents an example application: the generation of a single flood picture, the so-called “fast-ready flood map,” from multitemporal SAR images. The maps are very quickly and automatically generated without user interaction to support the authorities in providing first aid to a population. Toward this end, RGB composition is used: pre-flood and post-flood images are combined into a color image to better identify the flooded areas in comparison with permanent water and other classes...|$|R

The {{solution to this problem}} is in finding an appropriate method of using products of all types of remote sensing, high quality satellite images in particular. Having shown the best possibilities of remote sensing while using satellite images in mapping through the quality software solutions, the author presents an addition to topographic maps based on missing topographic data. Introduction Numerous natural and social phenomena are constantly observed, surveyed, registered and analyzed. Permanent or periodical satellite surveillance and recording for different purposes are growing in importance. The purposes can range from meteorological issues, through study of large water surfaces to military intelligence, etc. These recording can be used in making topographic, thematic and working maps as well as other geo-topographic material. Processing and analyzing of ikonos 2 satellite images for complementing the content of topographic maps Images taken from aircraft and satellite platforms are very important sources of data for studying and presenting natural and artificial phenomena on the Earth. Understanding the links and relations between digital values of pixels recorded on sensors and the phenomena on a terrain enables a proper interpretation and analysis of an image. The subject of the experiment presented in this article is a satellite image of the Belgrade city area, made by the IKONOS 2 satellite of the European Space Imaging Company. It belongs to the GEO Ortho Kit products category, which means that it is approximately georeferenced and completely orthorectified. Georeferencing of an ikonos 2 satellite image A procedure in which an image is taken into a desired coordinate system through orientation points (rectification), where the image is conveyed into a projection close to the orthogonal one, is called georeferencing (process of conveying an image into a reference coordinate system), while the level of geometric transformation is external geometrical transformation [5]. By georeferencing we establish certain mathematical dependence between the points on the image and the known points of the surveyed terrain. These points are called orientation points, control or GCP points (Ground Control Points). Procedures of digital image processing image pre-processing The biggest deficiency of satellite images {{that could be used in}} a digital form for making and maintaining working maps is a series of mistakes (deformations) of geometric mapping. These deformations that should be removed before further processing are viewed as: - A change of intensity of pixel grey tone caused by the characteristics of the surveyed terrain, object or phenomenon, and - A wrong relative position of a pixel in the image raster matrix. Image quality enhancement After removing deformations and taking image into a desired coordinate system, in further image processing, it is necessary to improve its quality and emphasize the date to be collected. The enhancement of image quality can be: - radiometric (radiometric enhancement) - contrast enhancement - <b>histogram</b> stretching and <b>equalization</b> - brightness optimization (brightness enhancement), - spatial enhancement - sharpening - averagening - pointing out line elements and edges (edge enhancement) - spectral enhancement - principal components analysis Image conveying By various image transformations (conveying), we get a 'new' image from a raw one, which results in emphasizing certain phenomena and attributes. Image transformation is an important step in digital processing, but for the geodesy purposes, i. e. mapping, this phase is not of essential importance. Geometric image correction Previous image processing of remote sensing is based on the analysis of radiometric and geometric characteristics. By understanding these image attributes, it is possible to correct image deformations, prove the quality and readability. Within this experiment, geometric deformations and a way of eliminating them were processed. Digital image analysis and interpretation A very important phase of satellite images processing is image analysis and interpretation. The analysis and interpretation can be visual and instrumental (by computer). The image resolution and possibility of recognizing image content are important for both of them. The analysis is a procedure of determining differences in characteristics and extraction of objects or terrain area based on their individual attributes. Visual image analysis and interpretation A visual image analysis and interpretation include registration and recognition of various useful data by eyesight. Computer added analysis and photo-interpretation-data conversion, geometric and radiometric image correction. -were done on a digital image. Elements of visual image analysis and interpretation A visual or logical analysis was done by observing images, notifying the differences and extracting military objects, which, due to their characteristics, differ very much from the surroundings. The recognition of objects was essential during data interpretation and application while processing the image. Finding differences between the object and the background was accomplished by a comparison based on the following visual elements: tone, shape, size, style, texture, shadow and associations. Digital image analysis Digital images can be stored in computer memory as data files, on the one of media (disc or magnetic tape), and can also be shown as black-white or colour images on a monitor, or as a data output as a film or a hard copy. A digital (formal) analysis is taken instrumentally. In that case images in a digital form are most often used, so the total procedure is known as digital analysis. The digital analysis contains numerous procedures, including forming and removing deformations and digital image enhancement, in order to enhance its interpretation. Information A datum is a real-time representation of an object, phenomenon or process, while only a processed datum, ready to be used, is called information. The final result and aim of the image analysis and interpretation or of the whole remote sensing process is useful information about an object on the terrain. The information gained by remote sensing of the terrain qualitatively and quantitatively differs from other types of research results...|$|R
