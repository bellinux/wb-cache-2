2500|$|A bronze Roman piece c. 200 BC to 200 AD {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} in the museum – it was {{discovered}} in 1960 and is a rare item that was unearthed after over 1,800 years. Wagner bought the item from Rik Gijsen, a Netherlands-based antiquities dealer. The piece was acquired by the museum in April 2006. Approximately 1,000 of the nutcrackers from the museum are highlighted in a book by Wagner, The Art and Character of Nutcrackers. The museum is open to visitors in the afternoon, from May to October; it is open to the public on weekends during the period from November to April. Arlene and George Wagner traveled the globe in search of nutcrackers for the museum: [...] "That's all we do! My <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> never been on a cruise. We just got back from Europe yesterday, hunting for nutcrackers. We went to the Netherlands. We attended a couple of very big European antique shows. We also had nutcrackers waiting for us to pick up – very valuable 16th and 17th century ones." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, Garner {{became an}} artist {{ambassador}} for Save the Children, promoting national literacy, nutrition and early education efforts. Since 2014, Garner {{has served on}} the board of trustees for Save the Children, the United States branch of the British children's charity, advocating for early education. She had been an ambassador for six years, and frequently visits with families involved in the organization's Early Steps to School Success program, which coaches families to help children learn in the early years. In 2011 she partnered with Frigidaire as part of her work with Save The Children. In 2013, Garner took her eldest daughter Violet to a Save The Children gala in New York: [...] "My <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> never taken our kids to a public event before, but I brought my daughter Violet, because ... I want her to see the passionate commitment Mark Shriver and Hillary Clinton have {{to make the world a}} better place for everyone." [...] In 2014, she joined the Invest in Us campaign., and in January 2015, she appeared in A Path Appears, a PBS documentary which focuses on rural poverty among children in West Virginia.|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't understand," [...] Mr. Waddington interrupted, gently. [...] "Your <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{both come}} under the {{influence}} of these--these beans. It is not possible for us to live as we have been accustomed to live." ...|$|E
5000|$|A single {{episode of}} My <b>Husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>has</b> been {{released}} by Network DVD on a DVD called [...] "Classic ITV Christmas Comedy".|$|R
5000|$|About the poem, she writes: “I wrote ‘Conjecture Number One Thousand’ while I was {{a fellow}} at the MacDowell Colony. It’s a rueful comment on my second {{marriage}} and an attempt at checking the longing that lives in my memories. The irony and occasional flippancy replicate much of the marriage’s shape. Being at MacDowell, where my former <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> once attended, only heightened the senses of loss and comedy within that loss.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Katrin Himmler {{said that}} she {{researched}} and wrote the book so that her son would have {{a full understanding of}} his family's history. She told an interviewer: [...] "When my <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> our son, it became clear <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to break with the family tradition of not speaking about the past. I wanted to give my son as much information as possible, so that when he starts asking questions about my family, at least I can answer him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Hilditch," [...] he said, [...] "will {{you allow}} me to make my apologies? Your <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> arrived at an understanding--or perhaps I should say a misunderstanding--which renders the {{acceptance}} of any further hospitality on my part impossible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It may be; but I {{did not say}} so. What I wish to {{approach}} is something very different. My <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> exchanged some remarks upon the subject, when we have observed with pain that {{you have not been}} easy with us.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never met}} him," [...] said she, [...] "but {{he was a}} classmate of my <b>husband,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> often heard him speak of him. And now for my errand, Captain Asher. Isn't it about time you should be wanting to see your niece?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah! no,' I said; 'I {{never thought}} of that.' But surely {{the place of a}} wife was with her <b>husband,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{expected}} to go with him to his garrison at Nancy, and there wait when he took the field. He threw himself at my feet, and pressed my hands with transport at what he called this unheard-of proof of affection; <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> vexed him by laughing, for I could not help thinking what my brothers would have said, could they have seen us thus.|$|R
5000|$|The winning prizes were {{presented}} by the Queen Mother, who told Griffiths [...] "I think it's marvellous to think that you've only got two horses and you can win a race like this. To think that my <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> racehorses almost all our lives and we haven't won a race like this". Shortly after the race the horse went [...] "hopping" [...] lame: Griffiths believed {{that this was the}} result of either being kicked by another horse {{at the start of the}} race or making a jumping error at the third fence.|$|R
60|$|I need say no more. This {{is enough}} to {{convince}} anybody that I did not think him my <b>husband,</b> <b>and</b> that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> cast off all principle and all modesty, and had effectually stifled conscience.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is the English custom, Emilie," [...] {{her sister}} said; [...] "and I {{can assure you}} that my <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> got very English, in some things. We do not love our country less, but we see that, in many respects, the English ways are better than ours; and we admire the {{independence}} of the people, every man respecting himself, though giving honour, but not lavishly, to those higher placed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] she {{retorted}} {{with one}} of her provoking smiles, [...] "you must not call me Estelle, you know, or Adrien will smack your face. We are indeed grateful to you, my good M. Ratichon," [...] she continued more seriously, [...] "and though I only promised you another hundred francs when your work for me was completed, my <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> decided to give you a thousand francs in view of the risks which you ran on our behalf." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can give}} you a rather large dinner, if you care to come," [...] said Mr. Wilton, [...] "but I fear you will not like it. I have got some House of Commons men dining with me to-day, and {{one or two of the}} other House to meet them. My sister Georgina has very good-naturedly promised to come, with her <b>husband,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> just written a note to the Duchess Dowager of Keswick, who often helps me--but I fear this sort of thing would hardly suit you." ...|$|E
60|$|As to {{the present}} {{relations}} between the <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> wife, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> only to tell you next what passed, when I visited Romayne {{a day or two}} later. I did well to keep Penrose at our disposal. We shall want him again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Besides, Harry, as {{you must}} {{remember}} well enough, Ciceley <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> in boy <b>and</b> girl fashion, used to say we should be some day <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> wife, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> never since seen anyone whom I would so soon marry as my bonny little cousin; and if Ciceley is of the same mind, maybe some day or other she may come to Lynnwood as its mistress; but that could hardly be, if her father were hung for attempting to swear away the life of mine." ...|$|R
6000|$|My {{heart beat}} violently. There was a studied coldness in his tone, <b>I</b> thought, <b>and</b> no wonder; but if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{been in love}} with Ernest Carvalho before, I felt a {{thousand}} more times in love with him now as he stood there in his evening dress, a perfect English gentleman. He looked so kinglike with his handsome, slightly Jewish features, his piercing black eyes, his long moustaches, and his beautiful delicate thin-lipped mouth. There was such an air of power in his forehead, such a speaking evidence of high culture in his general expression. And then, he had written [...] "Peter Martindale!" [...] Why, who else could possibly <b>have</b> written it? <b>I</b> wondered at my own stupidity in not having guessed the authorship at once. But, most terrible of all, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> probably lost his love for ever. <b>I</b> might once <b>have</b> called Ernest Carvalho my <b>husband,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> utterly alienated him by a single culpable act of foolish weakness.|$|R
6000|$|... "No need at all," [...] the Warden gently assented. [...] "Your <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{gone through}} it together. It {{provides}} that he shall exercise the full authority of Warden, and shall have {{the disposal of}} the annual revenue attached to the office, until my return, or, failing that, until Bruno comes of age: and that he shall then hand over, to myself or to Bruno {{as the case may}} be, the Wardenship, the unspent revenue, and the contents of the Treasury, which are to be preserved, intact, under his guardianship." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{husband and}} I," [...] {{went on the}} woman, [...] "live yonder at the village of Kurna, which is {{situated}} near {{to the mouth of}} the valley that is called Biban-el-Meluk, or Gate of the Kings, for there the monarchs of old days, who were the forefathers or rulers of us Copts, lie buried. It is but a very small village, for the Moslems have killed most of us in a war that was raised a while ago between them and our hereditary prince, Magas. Yet my <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a good house there, and, being poor, shall be glad to give you food and shelter if you can pay us something." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is no {{need for}} lives just now, my friend," [...] she said drily; [...] "my wits and four swift horses will serve the {{necessary}} purpose. But I must know where to find him. See," [...] she added, while her eyes filled with tears, [...] "I have humbled myself before you, I have owned my fault to you; shall I also confess my weakness?--My <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been estranged, because he did not trust me, and because I was too blind to understand. You must confess that the bandage which he put over my eyes was a very thick one. Is it small wonder that I did not see through it? But last night, after I led him unwittingly into such deadly peril, it suddenly fell from my eyes. If you will not help me, Sir Andrew, I would still strive to save my husband. I would still exert every faculty I possess for his sake; but I might be powerless, for I might arrive too late, and nothing would be left for you but lifelong remorse, and [...] . and [...] . for me, a broken heart." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My lord,' Otomie answered, {{speaking}} humbly {{and with}} bowed head, 'may this distemper leave you, and may {{you live to}} reign over us for many years! My lord, my <b>husband</b> Teule <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> won back the most part {{of the people of}} the Otomie to our cause and standard. An army of twenty thousand mountain men waits upon your word, and when those are spent there are more to follow.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{the first}} calumny I reply, that the debts {{are due to}} {{expensive}} chemical experiments in which my late <b>husband</b> engaged, <b>and</b> that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> satisfied the creditors to the last farthing. Grant me an audience, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will refer you to the creditors themselves.|$|R
60|$|As to Patmore's new {{volume of}} poems, my <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the {{pleasure}} of reading in MS. the poem which gives its title to the book. He {{has a great deal}} of thought and poetry in him. Alexander Smith I know by copious extracts in reviews, and by some MSS. once sent to us by friends and readers. Judging from those he must be set down as a true poet in opulence of imagery, but defective, so far (he is said to be very young) in the intellectual part of poetry. His images are flowers thrown to him by the gods, beautiful and fragrant, but having no root either in Enna or Olympus. There's no unity and holding together, no reality properly so called, no thinking of any kind. I hear that Alfred Tennyson says of him: 'He has fancy without imagination.' Still, it is difficult to say at the dawn what may be written at noon. Certainly he is very rich and full of colour; nothing is more surprising to me than his favourable reception with the critics. <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> thought that his very merits would be against him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stephen, I'm intolerably wretched. No {{creature}} {{has ever}} been gladder {{to have been born}} than I was for the first five and twenty years of my life. I was full of hope and I was full, I suppose, of vanity and rash confidence. I thought I was walking on solid earth with my head reaching up to the clouds, and that sea and sky and all mankind were mine for the smiling. And I am nothing and worse than nothing, I am the ineffectual mother of two children, a daughter whom I adore--but of her I may not tell you--and a son,--a son who is too like his father for any fury of worship, a stolid little creature.... That is all I have done in the world, a mere blink of maternity, and my blue Persian who is scarcely two years old, has already had nine kittens. My <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> never forgiven each other the indefinable wrong of not pleasing each other; that embitters more and more; to take it out of each other is our rôle; I have done my duty to the great new line of Justin by giving it the heir it needed, and now a polite and silent separation has fallen between us. We hardly speak except in company. I have not been so much married, Stephen, I find, as collected, and since our tragic misadventure--but there were beautiful moments, Stephen, unforgettable glimpses of beauty in that--thank God, I say impenitently for that--the door of the expensively splendid cabinet that contains me, when it is not locked, is very discreetly--watched. I have no men friends, no social force, no freedom to take my line. My husband is my official obstacle. We barb the limitations of life for one another. A little while ago he sought to chasten me--to rouse me rather--through jealousy, and made me aware indirectly but a little defiantly of a young person of artistic gifts in whose dramatic career he was pretending a conspicuous interest. I was jealous and roused, but scarcely in the way he desired. 'This,' I said quite cheerfully, 'means freedom for me, Justin,'--and the young woman vanished from the visible universe with an incredible celerity. I hope she was properly paid off and not simply made away with by a minion, but I become more and more aware of my ignorance of a great financier's methods as I become more and more aware of them....|$|E

It’s a positive thing for both of us. And I just see so many things in the future.|$|E

We <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been married 39 years, and are still just as thrilled with each other as ever we were. Our film is no love story with misunderstandings and scandals.

40|$|ABSTRACT In {{this article}} I discuss the {{characteristics}} of ritual practices, according to Roy Rappaport’s general theory of ritual. I start by discussing technology {{as a kind of}} ritual product of science and then briefly present Rappaport’s ritual theory as an aid in understanding how the Mi’kmaq Indians of Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, employed rituals in their efforts to protect a sacred mountain from being turned into a superquarry. In Ritual and Religion in the Making of Humanity, Rappaport discusses the concept of the ecosystem as a product of modern Western society, emanating from scientific epistemology rather than religious dogma. Rappaport also identifies “ecological thinking ” in what he calls The Book. Although not expressed in terms of modern ecology, he suggests, such pre-modern thought is an adequate medium for protecting environmental values. His vision is to bring these two separate cosmologies closer, in order to emphasize the moral responsibility of humans everywhere on this planet. It is impossible, Rappaport would say, to do something without simultaneously affecting social relations and the environment. Humanity has the power and the technology to destroy places and ecosystems, if morality is left without consideration. Rappaport’s vision was to combine the moral efficacy of ritual with the analytical validity of ecological thinking. But how can modern, de-traditionalized humans create such a synthesis, that reckons with both practical effects and moral implications of human agency?
