50|$|On March 2, 2011, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service {{declared}} the <b>Eastern</b> <b>cougar</b> (Puma concolor couguar) officially extinct.|$|E
50|$|Prior to European settlement, {{the area}} also {{supported}} woodland caribou (a {{relative of the}} Arctic caribou which inhabited northeastern North America), {{as well as the}} <b>eastern</b> <b>cougar</b> and wolves. A remnant population of the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Cougar</b> is thought to inhabit parts of New Brunswick and Quebec's Gaspé Peninsula, possibly including the Miramichi River watershed. A Grey Wolf pack is thought to have recently returned to the Miramichi Highlands from the Gaspé Peninsula.|$|E

50|$|Intensive hunting {{following}} European {{colonization of}} the Americas {{and the ongoing}} human development of cougar habitat has caused populations to drop {{in most parts of}} its historical range. In particular, the cougar was extirpated in eastern North America {{in the beginning of the}} 20th century, except for an isolated Florida panther subpopulation. Transient males have been verified in Minnesota, Missouri, Wisconsin, Iowa, Michigan, and Illinois, where a cougar was shot in the city limits of Chicago and, in at least one instance, observed as far east as coastal Connecticut. Reports of <b>eastern</b> <b>cougars</b> (P. c. cougar) still surface, although it was declared extirpated in 2011.|$|R
5000|$|The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service {{reviewed}} {{all available}} research and other information, and concluded in 2011 that the <b>eastern</b> <b>cougar</b> subspecies has been extinct since the 1930s, and recommended {{that it be}} removed from its list of endangered species. The agency used the 1946 taxonomy of S.P. Young and E.A. Goldman in defining the <b>eastern</b> <b>cougar</b> subspecies. While noting that some taxonomists {{in recent years have}} classified all North American cougars within a single subspecies, the agency's 2011 report said [...] "a full taxonomic analysis is necessary to conclude that a revision to the Young and Goldman (1946) taxonomy is warranted." ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{consensus}} exists among wildlife {{officials in}} 21 eastern {{states that the}} <b>eastern</b> <b>cougar</b> subspecies has been extirpated from the eastern United States. The federal government of Canada has taken no position on the subspecies' existence, continued or otherwise, and terms the evidence [...] "inconclusive." ...|$|E
50|$|In the United States {{east of the}} Mississippi River, {{the only}} {{unequivocally}} known cougar population is the Florida panther. Until 2011, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) recognized both an <b>Eastern</b> <b>cougar</b> (claimed to be a subspecies by some, denied by others) and the Florida panther, affording protection under the Endangered Species Act. Certain taxonomic authorities have collapsed both designations into the North American cougar, with Eastern or Florida subspecies not recognized, while a subspecies designation remains recognized by some conservation scientists. In 2003 the documented count for the Florida sub-population was 87 individuals. In March 2011, the USFWS declared the <b>Eastern</b> <b>cougar</b> extinct. With the taxonomic uncertainty about its existence as a subspecies {{as well as the}} possibility of eastward migration of cougars from the western range, the subject remains open.|$|E
5000|$|This {{uncertainty}} {{has been}} recognized by Canadian authorities. The Canadian federal agency called Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada rates its current data as [...] "insufficient" [...] to draw conclusions regarding the <b>eastern</b> <b>cougar's</b> survival, and says on its Web site [...] "Despite many sightings {{in the past two}} decades from eastern Canada, there are insufficient data to evaluate the taxonomy or assign a status to this cougar." [...] Notwithstanding numerous reported sightings in Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, it has been said that the evidence is inconclusive: [...] "[...] [...] there may not be a distinct 'eastern' subspecies, and some sightings may be of escaped pets." ...|$|R

50|$|<b>Eastern</b> <b>cougar</b> or {{eastern puma}} (Puma concolor couguar) {{refers to the}} extinct {{subspecies}} or extirpated population of cougars that once lived in northeastern North America. The eastern cougars were deemed extinct by a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) evaluation in 2011, while a parallel Canadian organization has taken no position on the question.|$|E
5000|$|After the {{attention}} {{gained from the}} death of Cecil the African Lion, activists turned to the North American Wildlife, the mountain lion in particular. The North American Mountain Lion, also called puma, cougar, and panther, is hunted for sport across its expansive habitat. According to the Washington, the only federally protected populations {{in the country are}} the Florida Panther and the <b>Eastern</b> <b>cougar,</b> believed to be extinct.|$|E
50|$|Beulaville {{is home to}} one elementary/middle school (Beulaville Elementary) and one {{secondary}} school (East Duplin High School). The mascot for both schools, as well as nearby B. F. Grady, is the panther, referring to the <b>eastern</b> <b>cougar</b> which once roamed the swamps and forests of eastern North Carolina. East Duplin High School was built in 1963 and consolidates the elementary schools of Beulaville, B. F. Grady, and Chinquapin.|$|E

50|$|After {{defeating}} Tennessee Tech and <b>Eastern</b> Illinois, the <b>Cougars</b> awaited {{an opponent}} for the finals. Continued thunderstorms eventually forced the conference {{to shorten the}} semifinals and finals to a single-elimination format. Murray State emerged from the loser's bracket, and the SIUE women dispatched them 12-1 in five innings, earning the OVC's entry in the NCAA national tournament.|$|R

50|$|As well {{as several}} {{previous}} subspecies of cougar of the western United States and western Canada, Puma concolor couguar encompasses the remaining populations of the <b>eastern</b> <b>cougar,</b> where the cat was {{also known as the}} panther, the only unequivocally known of which is the critically endangered Florida panther population. Many extinct populations, such as the Wisconsin cougar, which was extirpated in 1925, are also included in the subspecies.|$|E
5000|$|Until around 1990, {{reports of}} {{mountain}} lions in the Midwest and East were highly {{influenced by the}} [...] "Bigfoot factor," [...] according to Mark Dowling, co-founder of the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Cougar</b> Network. [...] "None of it was really real," [...] {{he said in an}} interview. But the situation has changed dramatically since that time according to Dowling, whose group collects and disseminates data on the shifting mountain lion population.|$|E
50|$|In 1792, Robert Kerr of the Royal Physical Society and Royal Society of Surgeons {{assigned}} the name Felis couguar to eastern North America cougars north of Florida. John Audubon in 1851 believed that cougars in both North and South America were indistinguishable. The <b>eastern</b> <b>cougar</b> was first {{assigned to the}} subspecies Felis concolor couguar and the Florida panther (F. c. coryi). Young and Goldman based their description of the eastern subspecies on their examination of eight of the existing 26 historic specimens.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{significant}} {{controversy over the}} presence of <b>Eastern</b> <b>Cougars</b> in the U.P. Historically, {{the last of the}} species, or subspecies, was extirpated near Newberry in 1906, although there have been sightings of the creatures over the years since. These reports increased in number over {{the first decade of the}} 21st century. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources and Environment (DNRE) formed a four-person team to investigate sightings in the state. The biologists with the DNRE currently do not believe that there is a breeding population anywhere in the state, rather that the sighted animals are visitors to the state. As late as January 2007, the DNRE's official position was that no cougars lived in Michigan. Several residents in the state disagree with both current and previous positions on the part of the DNRE. Researchers at Central Michigan University and the Michigan Wildlife Conservancy in 2006 published the findings of a study using DNA analysis of fecal samples taken in the Upper and Lower peninsulas that showed the presence of cougars at the time. These results were disputed in a second journal article in 2007 by other researchers from Eastern Michigan University and the U.S. Forest Service. A citizen's group, the Michigan Citizens for Cougar Recognition (MCCR), independently tracked sightings and in 2009 listed Delta County as the location with the greatest number of reports in the state. The DNRE verified five sets of tracks and two trail camera photos in Delta, Chippewa, Marquette, and Menominee counties since 2008. DNRE officials acknowledge that there are cougars in the UP, but not elsewhere in the state. Critics of the DNRE's position on the species, including the founder of the MCCR, say that the department is attempting to [...] "avoid paying for a cougar management program".|$|R

5000|$|Cytauxzoon felis is a protozoal {{organism}} {{transmitted to}} domestic cats by tick bites, and whose natural reservoir host is the bobcat. [...] C. felis {{has been found}} in other wild felid species such as Florida bobcat, <b>eastern</b> bobcat, Texas <b>cougar,</b> and a white tiger in captivity. [...] C. felis infection is limited to the family felidae which means that C. felis poses no zoonotic (transmission to humans) risk or agricultural (transmission to farm animals) risk. Until recently it was believed that after infection with C. felis, pet cats almost always died. As awareness of C. felis has increased it has been found that treatment is not always futile. More cats have been shown to survive the infection than was previously thought. [...] New treatments offer as much as 60% survival rate.|$|R
5000|$|On June 17, 2015, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service {{removed the}} eastern puma from their {{endangered}} species list, {{declaring that the}} species is now extinct. According to the Center for Biological Diversity, [...] "The <b>eastern</b> <b>cougar</b> was extinct well before it was protected under the Endangered Species Act, {{as was the case}} with eight of the other 10 species that have been delisted for extinction." [...] The Florida Panther, a subspecies, still exists in small groups in southern Florida.|$|E
50|$|As with West Virginia's remote {{mountain}} forests, {{the farms}} and lands with meadows and woodlots near urban areas also hold whitetail deer, chipmunks, raccoons, skunks, groundhogs, opossums, weasels, field mice, flying squirrels, cotton-tail rabbits, gray foxes, red foxes, gray squirrels, red squirrels and a cave bat {{to name a}} few. Bobcats, snowshoe hares, wild boars and black bears are not strictly found in deepest forests and parks of West Virginia. But, the mink, beaver and at one time the <b>eastern</b> <b>cougar</b> (Puma concolor couguar) are very rarely seen near farms, even the farthest from towns.|$|E
5000|$|Mammals in {{the region}} today include whitetail deer, chipmunk, raccoon, skunk, groundhog, opossum, weasel, field mouse, flying squirrel, cottontail rabbit, gray foxes, red foxes, gray {{squirrels}}, red squirrels and several types of bat. Bobcat, snowshoe hare, wild boar and black bear are {{also found in the}} more remote forests and parks. Mink and beaver are much less often seen. Four species (or subspecies) - the Virginia big-eared bat, the Indiana bat, the West Virginia northern flying squirrel and the (potentially extirpated) <b>eastern</b> <b>cougar</b> - are federally listed as endangered. Several additional species are rare in the state and warrant close monitoring.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the traditional, dorm-style residence halls, Cougar Village is a student apartment development that opened in 1970. The complex is located along the <b>eastern</b> shore of <b>Cougar</b> Lake and is composed of around 500 two and three bedroom apartments in 62 buildings that house approximately 1,500 undergraduate students, graduate students, and family residents. The village was originally called Tower Lake Apartments, after the man-made lake {{on the north side}} of campus located behind the water tower and the heating and refrigeration plant. Tower Lake is now called Cougar Lake. Apartments provide multiple floor plans and are a short walk or shuttle ride from the core campus. Cougar Village also includes the Cougar Village Commons Building, located in the middle complex. The Commons contains an information desk, laundry facilities, a lounge, a computer lab, and the Common's Grill and Convenience Store. In 2010, a project was developed and approved to remodel eight of the buildings in Cougar Village into a Greek Village, providing on-campus fraternity and sorority houses, but the project was later dropped.|$|R
5000|$|The 2016 squad {{finished}} {{the regular season}} in 4th place {{with a record of}} only 8-7-4 (6-3-1 OVC). They got through {{the first round of the}} OVC tournament by besting Austin Peay on penalty kicks 5-4, sending them to the semifinals at top-seeded Murray State. The Racers had not lost on their home field since October 2014, but the Cougars took the victory 2-1 with 11 seconds left in the first overtime period. In the tourney final, they faced co-champions <b>Eastern</b> Kentucky. The <b>Cougars</b> scored early, then successfully argued that the referee had not let the goalkeeper get set on a penalty kick. Goalkeeper Juli Rossi blocked the re-try, and SIUE then held on to win 1-0 for their second title in three years. [...] Playing in the NCAA tournament at heavily favored and 11th ranked Notre Dame, the Cougars did as they had done to the Kentucky Wildcats two years before, and held the Fighting Irish to a scoreless tie through regulation time and two extra periods, with Rossi making several spectacular saves. In the penalty kicks, Rossi made two saves, while the SIUE women nailed 5 of six to win 5-4 and became only the second OVC team to advance to the NCAA second round [...] where they lost to Northwestern 1-0 at Duke.|$|R
50|$|The {{gray wolf}} once roamed the Eastern U.S., {{but is now}} extinct from this region. The <b>eastern</b> <b>cougar</b> as well was once as {{widespread}} as the cougar in the western parts of the country, but was deemed extinct by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2011. Eastern elk once lived throughout the east, but was extirpated in the 19th century and declared as extinct by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1880. Moose as well once roamed throughout the east, but is currently only found in northern New England. Due to its highly prized fur, the sea mink was hunted to extinction in 1903.|$|E
50|$|Here {{is a list}} of mammal {{species that}} are present in or around Mer Bleue. Aquatic furbearers such as beaver (Castor canadensis), muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), and mink (Neovison vison) live in the {{surrounding}} marshes. It is also home to: woodchuck (marmot), raccoon, skunk, porcupine, vole, mole, squirrel (red, grey/black), chipmunk, weasel, cottontail hare, snowshoe hare, moose, white-tailed deer, red fox, coyote (coywolf), black bear, and possible range of the lynx, <b>eastern</b> <b>cougar,</b> and eastern wolf in the less accessible parts of the bog (their presence is yet to be determined). The spotfin shiner (Cyprinella spiloptera), regionally rare, is found in Bear Brook Creek. Two rare beetles, Stenolophus magnacephalus and Agonum darlingtoni occur here. The spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata), a rare species in Canada, is found {{in the center of the}} bog.|$|E
5000|$|... "Wildlife officials, who {{at first}} assumed {{the cat was}} a captive animal that had escaped its owners, {{examined}} its DNA and concluded {{that it was a}} wild cougar from the Black Hills of South Dakota. It had wandered at least 1,500 miles before meeting its end at the front of an S.U.V. in Connecticut. That is one impressive walkabout."You have to appreciate this cat’s sense of irony, too. The cougar showed up in the East just three months after the Fish and Wildlife Service declared the <b>eastern</b> <b>cougar</b> extinct, a move that would exempt the officially nonexistent subspecies of the big cat from federal protection. Perhaps this red-state cougar traveled east {{to send a message to}} Washington: the federal government can make pronouncements about where cougars are not supposed to be found, but a cat’s going to go where a cat wants to go." ...|$|E
50|$|This {{region is}} home to a variety of wildlife, {{including}} black bear (Ursus americanus), moose (Alces laces), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), coyote (Canis latrans), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), bobcat (Lynx rufus), porcupine (Erithyzon dorsatum), river otter (Lontra canadensis), fisher (Martes pennant), beaver (Castor canadensis), marten (Martes americana), muskrat (Ondatra zibethica), and raccoon (Procyon lot or). The forests are habitat for wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos), wood duck (Aix sponsa), great horned owl (Bubo virginianus), and a great number of passerine birds. The area is particularly important as a feeding ground for birds migrating on the Atlantic Flyway. The peatland of western Massachusetts are home to bog turtles (Glyptemys muhlenbergii). Former species of fauna that roamed this region were the gray wolf, the <b>eastern</b> <b>cougar,</b> and the eastern elk, all three of which were wiped out from the region after the arrival of European settlers.|$|E
