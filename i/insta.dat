40|$|My {{point of}} {{departure}} in this piece is the putative “under-urbanization” of East and Central European cities, still very much entrenched in the global urban studies literature. I explain this by harking back to the classic of Polish urban studies (such as Paweł Rybicki and Marcin Czerwiński) and their concept of umiastowienie, as opposed to urbanization. They employed {{it in order to}} explain the “urbanization without cities” that unfolded in the socialist Poland. I then turn towards an analysis of the idiosyncracies of the “territorial logic of power” (Giovanni Arrighi and David Harvey’s term) in Poland. I agrue that its stems from the way “scale” and “property” work in Polish cities. Drawing my examples form the city of Poznań, I describe what Katherine Verdery dubbed as “fuzzy” property regime and explain how this results {{in the absence of the}} “gentrification frontier” – a concept coined by Neil Smith. <b>Instaed,</b> I argue that gentrification is more scattered and we can speak of a shifting “gentrificaiton front”, wherein the speculative and largelly local capital initiates the gentrification cycle from the “weakest link” in the chain of property structure...|$|R

40|$|Embryonic {{indifferent}} gonads {{of mammals}} have the inherent tendency to develop toward the ovary. The precise {{meaning of this}} general statement {{is likely to be}} the bisexual expression of the ovary-organizing plasma membrane component and its specific membrane-bound receptor. Testicular organogenesis that normally, but not always, depends upon the presence of the Y-chromosome is the responsibility of the two plasma membrane components; the male-specific but ubiquitously expressed H-Y antigen and its specific receptors expressed only by gonadal cells, but of both sexes. Of these four components for mammalian gonadal organogenesis, only the expression of H-Y antigen is confined to the heterogametic male sex. Accordingly, this plasma membrane component, which has been conserved in evolution to the extreme, emerges as the master regulator of the primary (gonadal) sex-determining mechanism of mammals. Its ubiquitous as well as constitutive expression in the male reflects its master regulatory role, since a master by definition is not under genetic subjugation. Testis-organizing H-Y antigen is not an integral component of the plasma membrane. <b>Instaed,</b> it utilizes β 2 -microglobulin-MHC (H- 2 of the mouse and HLA of man) antigen dimers as its plasma membrane anchorage sites. This enables H-Y antigen to play a hormonelike role during testicular organogenesis. By so doing, H-Y antigen drives out the bisexually expressed, rival ovary-organizing antigen from the plasma membrane and virtually monopolizes the β 2 m-MHC antigen dimer anchorage sites of male gonadal cells. In the mouse, this monopolization by H-Y renders much of H- 2 antigenic determinants inaccessible to anti-H- 2 antibody. Hence, fetal and newborn testicular cells are totally resistant to the cytotoxic effect of anti-H- 2 antibody...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{explains}} a didactical method for training students {{that has been}} run three times to date. The premise of the course is to combine students from different faculties into interdisciplinary teams. These teams then have a complex problem to resolve within an extremely short time span. In light of recent works from Joy and Kurzweil, the theme Robotics was chosen as an exercise that is timely, interesting and related, but not central to the studies of the various faculties. In groups of 3 to 5, students from faculties of architecture, computer science and mechanical engineering are entrusted to design, build and program a robot which must successfully execute a prescribed set of actions in a competitive atmosphere. The entire course lasts ten days and culminates with the competitive evaluation. The robots must navigate a labyrinth, communicate with on another {{and be able to}} cover longer distances with some speed. In order to simplify the resources available to the students, the Lego Mindstorms Robotic syshed backgrounds <b>instaed</b> of synthetic ones. The combination of digitally produced (scanned) sperical images together with the use of HDR open a wide range of new implementation in the field of architecture, especially in combining synthetic elements in existing buildings, e. g. new interior elements in an existing historical museum). ural presentations in the medium of computer animation. These new forms of expression of design thoughts and ideas go beyond mere model making, and move more towards scenemaking and storytelling. The latter represents new methods of expression within computational environments for architects and designers. its boundaries. The project was conducted using the pedagogical framework of the netzentwurf. de; a relatively well established Internet based communication platform. This means that the studio was organised in the „traditional“ structure consisting of an initial 3 day workshop, a face to face midterm review, and a collective final review, held 3, 5 months later in the Museum of Communication in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. In teams of 3 (with each student from a different university and a tutor located at a fourth) the students worked over the Internet to produce collaborative design solutions. The groups ended up with designs that spanned a range of solutions between real and virtual architecture. Examples of the student’s work (which is all available online) as well as their working methods are described. It must be said that the energy invested in the studio by the organisers of the virtual campus (as well as the students who took part) was considerably higher than in normal design studios and the paper seeks to look critically at the effort in relation to the outcomes achieved. The range and depth of the student’s work was surprising to many in the project, especially considering the initial hurdles (both social and technological) that had to overcome. The self-referential nature of the theme, the method and the working environment encouraged the students to take a more philosg and programming a winning robot. These differences became apparent early in the sessions and each group had to find ways to communicate their ideas and to collectively develop them by building on the strengths of each team member...|$|R
