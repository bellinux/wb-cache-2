5|$|NBC ran three BOCs, in Burbank, California, Chicago, and New York City, {{with the}} last the largest. Cline was {{stationed}} at the New York BOC for the game. In the era before satellite transmission, programming was transmitted by coaxial cable line, {{with the cooperation of}} the telephone company. For this game, the Burbank BOC was to receive the feed from Oakland, insert commercials and network announcements, and send the modified feed via telephone wire to a switching station west of Chicago near the Mississippi River. An engineer was stationed there to activate the Oakland feed into the entire network when the game began, to cut it on instruction and then to return to his base. He had been told to <b>expect</b> <b>at</b> 6:58:20 Eastern Time a network announcement for Heidi, after which he was to cut the feed from Burbank, and the Heidi feed from New York would begin. This placed Burbank in effective control of whether the engineer would cut the feed, since he would act upon hearing the announcement.|$|E

25|$|Brine is {{a problem}} in {{proportion}} to the humidity created, since water's vapor pressure decreases with salinity, it is reasonable to <b>expect</b> <b>at</b> least as much brine as water in humidity. This means that a river of brine flows way from the powerplant at 41 tons (m3s-1) per second, along with a river of saline water flowing in with 82 tons of water per second (m3s-1).|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{public schools}} have a sex {{education}} program that teaches girls about menstruation and what to <b>expect</b> <b>at</b> the onset of menarche (often this takes place during the 4th grade). Historically menstruation has been a social taboo and girls were taught about menarche and menstruation by their mothers or a female role model. Then, and to an extent now, menstruation was a private matter and a girl's menarche was not a community phenomenon.|$|E

A cut from the video premiered on NBC's The Voice on September 17. A video teaser was released on Aguilera's YouTube channel on September 17, 2012. The official music video premiered on Vevo on September 28, 2012. Aguilera commented about the collaboration with Matsoukas, [...] "Once we started talking {{with each other and}} she heard 'Your Body,' she spun {{it in a way that}} you wouldn't <b>expect</b> <b>at</b> all. And I get to play this character that, yeah, she may be a little bit of a badass, she's very confident, self-assured, but she's super playful and super tongue-in-cheek. She laughs the whole way through the video. She's watching cartoons, and you know she doesn't take herself too seriously." ...|$|E

Tom Willmott of The Independent gave the album three out of five stars, considering Lightning Bolt to [...] "offer {{a broad range of}} styles" [...] and praising the rock-focused tracks. Will Hermes of Rolling Stone gave the album three and a half stars out of five, saying that Eddie Vedder's earnest lyrics and vocals made for compelling tracks, and that the musicians [...] "overthink, overemote and overreach — fruitfully". Josh Modell of The A.V. Club gave the album a B+, complaining about the excessive length and [...] "a couple too many songs that revisit the past without any fresh insight" [...] while feeling that [...] "the album still feels fresher and more relevant than the world at large might <b>expect</b> <b>at</b> this point." [...] Marc Hirsh of The Boston Globe considered the album to showcase that Pearl Jam [...] "has plenty of spark left", comparing it to both the [...] "dense eclecticism" [...] of the band's own Vitalogy (1994), and [...] "The Who’s solidity of purpose".|$|E

The marketing uses the tagline [...] "quality you'd <b>expect</b> <b>at</b> prices you wouldn't". 1,600 new and existing products were rebranded with this name using simple white-based packaging. Some people poked fun at the range for selling products that aren't an essential such as diamond polish and Champagne flute sets. Nevertheless, the range was highly successful. By 2016 it had over 2,000 items and £1.1 billion annual sales, {{making it one of}} only five food and drink brands in Britain worth over £1 billion.|$|E

While Longoria seemingly wasn't bothered, stating for the press that [...] "I'm new. I just arrived.

In the end, the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series went to Felicity Huffman, while Teri Hatcher won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Musical or Comedy, as well as the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Actress – Comedy Series.|$|E
