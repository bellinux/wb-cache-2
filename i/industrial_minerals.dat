25|$|In 2006, {{the value}} of Peruvian {{minerals}} (metals, <b>industrial</b> <b>minerals,</b> and fuels) production amounted to $6.5 billion, compared with $5.1 billion in 2005. Mining and fuel production increased by 8.1% {{as a result of}} larger values of metals (7%) and fuel output (23%). The increase of mineral outputs (content) was mainly led by natural gas (77%), molybdenum (22%), gold (20%), crude oil (18%), and iron (8%), {{and to a lesser extent}} by silver and lead (4% each) compared with 2005 outputs. In 2006, metal prices were also driven upwards because of the higher consumption associated with increased world economic activity, such as in China, the United States, and other countries.|$|E

25|$|Tin and {{petroleum}} are the {{two main}} mineral resources that are of major significance in the Malaysian economy. Malaysia was once the world's largest producer of tin until {{the collapse of the}} tin market in the early 1980s. In the 19th and 20th century, tin played a predominant role in the Malaysian economy, with Malaysia accounting for over 31% of global output. It was only in 1972 that petroleum and natural gas took over from tin as the mainstay of the mineral extraction sector. Other minerals of some importance or significance include copper, bauxite, iron-ore and coal together with <b>industrial</b> <b>minerals</b> like clay, kaolin, silica, limestone, barite, phosphates and dimension stones such as granite as well as marble blocks and slabs. Small quantities of gold are produced.|$|E
25|$|Commercially {{valuable}} {{minerals and}} rocks {{are referred to}} as <b>industrial</b> <b>minerals.</b> For example, muscovite, a white mica, can be used for windows (sometimes referred to as isinglass), as a filler, or as an insulator. Ores are minerals that have a high concentration of a certain element, typically a metal. Examples are cinnabar (HgS), an ore of mercury, sphalerite (ZnS), an ore of zinc, or cassiterite (SnO2), an ore of tin. Gems are minerals with an ornamental value, and are distinguished from non-gems by their beauty, durability, and usually, rarity. There are about 20 mineral species that qualify as gem minerals, which constitute about 35 of the most common gemstones. Gem minerals are often present in several varieties, and so one mineral can account for several different gemstones; for example, ruby and sapphire are both corundum, Al2O3.|$|E

25|$|China is well {{endowed with}} mineral resources, the most {{important}} of which is coal. China's mineral resources include large reserves of coal and iron ore, plus adequate to abundant supplies of nearly all other <b>industrial</b> <b>minerals.</b> Although coal deposits are widely scattered (some coal is found in every province), most of the total is located {{in the northern part of}} the country. The province of Shanxi, in fact, is thought to contain about half of the total; other important coal-bearing provinces include Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Jilin, Hebei, and Shandong. Apart from these northern provinces, significant quantities of coal are present in Sichuan, and there are some deposits of importance in Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou. A large part of the country's reserves consists of good bituminous coal, but there are also large deposits of lignite. Anthracite is present in several places (especially Liaoning, Guizhou, and Henan), but overall it is not very significant.|$|E
25|$|The Peruvian Constitution {{establishes}} {{equal protection}} for {{domestic and foreign}} investors who may enter into agreements with the Government and guarantees free access, possession, and disposal of foreign currency. Hydrocarbon Law No. 26844 of May 1997 eliminated the exclusive rights of the state-owned Petróleos del Perú S.A. to control the secondary recovery of crude oil, refining, and imports and subsequent resale of petroleum and byproducts. The Peruvian laws have attempted to ensure more-favorable minerals and crude {{oil and gas exploration}} and production contract terms for investors. Legal procedures to obtain mining rights were made easier by the enactment of complementary legislation Supreme Decree No. 018 of July 9, 1992. The Government relinquished exclusive control over exploration, mining, smelting, and refining of metals and fuel minerals. Individuals and private companies are allowed to hold mining permits in Peru. In the legal framework for investment and taxation, no distinction is made among domestic and foreign investors, corporations, joint ventures, and consortia formed in Peru or abroad. Municipalities and Regional governments in areas where mineral resources (metals and <b>industrial</b> <b>minerals)</b> are exploited will receive 50% of the taxes collected to be invested in education and social programs (health, housing, and others) in conformance with the Canon Minero (Ministry Resolution No. 266-2002-EF/15 of May 1, 2002). The remittance of dividends, depreciation, and royalties abroad has no restrictions. Contracts can be signed by investors, and the Government guarantees the stability of legal commitments and taxes. To increase protection of investors’ interests, Peru signed agreements with the World Bank’s Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency in April 1991, which was authorized by Legislative Decree No. 25312 and with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation in December 2002, which was authorized by Legislative Decree No. 25809.|$|E

2500|$|The mining {{industry}} makes up 1% of the GDP. Mined commodities include oil shale, peat, and <b>industrial</b> <b>minerals,</b> such as clays, limestone, sand and gravel. Soviets created badly polluting {{industry in the}} early 1950s, concentrated in the north-east of the country. Socialist economy and military areas left the country highly polluted, and mainly because of oil shale industry in East-Virumaa, sulfur dioxide emissions per person is almost as high as in Czech Republic.

[...] In August 2014, the NYSDoH qualified two, more exact, test methods, better designed to identify materials with this potential problem, and assist in safely dealing with any issues associated with its removal. [...] Modern spray applied fireproofing today is made with vermiculite that does not contain asbestos and is carefully monitored at all stages of mining and production to ensure this is the case.|$|E
2500|$|Dimension {{stone is}} one of the most {{sustainable}} of the <b>industrial</b> <b>minerals</b> since it is created by separating it from the natural bedrock underlying all land on every continent. [...] Dimension stone rates very well in terms of the criteria on the ASTM checklist for sustainability of building products: there are no toxic materials used in its processing, there are no direct greenhouse gas emissions during processing, the dust created is controlled, the water used is almost completely recycled (per OSHA/MSHA regulation), and it is a perpetual resource (virtually inexhaustible in a human time scale). [...] Dimension stone in use can last many generations, even centuries, so the dimension stone manufacturers have not needed a product recycling program. [...] However, there are practical qualifications to and constraints on that sustainability. [...] The dimension stone color and pattern can be changed by weathering when it is very near the surface. [...] The color and pattern can also be changed by proximity to an igneous rock body or by the presence of circulating groundwater charged with carbon dioxide (i.e., limestone, travertine, marble). [...] On the other hand, changes in color and/or pattern can be positive. [...] For example, there are at least 14 separately trade-named varieties of Carrara Marble with many patterns (or no patterns) ranging in shade from white to gray. [...] The presence of faults or closely spaced joints can render the stone unusable. [...] These faults and joints do not have to be at odd angles in the stone mass. [...] Closely spaced, wrongly spaced, or nonparallel bedding planes can make the stone unusable, particularly if the bedding planes are planes of weakness. [...] If part of the stone in one area is unusable, there will be another usable part of the stone elsewhere in the formation. [...] A quarry is not a short-term project unless it encounters one of these constraints. [...] Examples of big, old quarries operating for more than a century include the Barre (VT) granite quarry, the Georgia Marble quarry at Tate, several of the Carrara (Italy) marble quarries, and the Penrhyn (Wales) slate quarry. [...] A quarry will produce dust, noise, and some water pollution, but these can be remedied without too much trouble. [...] The landscape may also have to be restored if quarry waste is temporarily or permanently placed on adjacent land.|$|E
