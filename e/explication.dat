5|$|Aristotle's {{work was}} {{influential}} throughout the Middle East during the Islamic Golden Age, {{as well as}} in Europe during the Renaissance. Later poets and aestheticians often distinguished poetry from, and defined it in opposition to prose, which was generally understood as writing with a proclivity to logical <b>explication</b> and a linear narrative structure.|$|E
5|$|In Byzantium, the {{elementary}} school teacher occupied a low social position and taught mainly from simple fairy tale books (Aesop's Fables were often used). However, the grammarian and rhetorician, teachers responsible for the following two phases of education, were more respected. These used classical Greek texts like Homer's Iliad or Odyssey and {{much of their time}} was taken with detailed word-for-word <b>explication.</b> Books were rare and very expensive and likely only possessed by teachers who dictated passages to students.|$|E
5|$|It was {{difficult}} for the few priests who had accompanied the Christian emigrants to South Canara to look after them properly. Thus, the Gurkar system came into existence. Gurkars were Mangalorean Catholic men of good moral character who were selected as headmen in Christian settlements. They were entrusted with the social and religious supervision of the community. After migration, the only possible occupation of a Mangalorean Catholic was agriculture, since they were skilled farmers. Every farmer practised carpentry, but it was quite primitive and unskilled, and other crafts and industries were non-existent. The mass was celebrated in Latin; but the sermon, the catechism, and the <b>explication</b> of the mysteries were delivered to the congregation in Konkani.|$|E
40|$|Partial Reductive Paraphrase (PRP) is {{a method}} for {{constructing}} <b>explications,</b> a specific kind of definition, for use in requirements documents. <b>Explications</b> avoid common weaknesses of definitions produced by other methods and encourage effective representation of the information most critical to the application domain at hand, allowing better understanding {{on the part of}} requirements users. This paper introduces PRP and demonstrates how it is used to construct <b>explications</b> of concepts and present them for accessibility to users. PRP <b>explications</b> are provided for concepts drawn from industrial requirements documents and are then evaluated relative to analogous definitions produced by other methods. The PRP <b>explications</b> are shown to be free of specific faults that otherwise result. Finally, means by which PRP can be integrated into the requirements process are addressed. 1...|$|R

25|$|The messianism of the Safed mystics {{culminated in}} Kabbalah {{receiving}} its biggest {{transformation in the}} Jewish world with the <b>explication</b> of its new interpretation from Rabbi Isaac Luria (1534–1572), by his disciples Hayim Vital and Israel Sarug. Both transcribed Luria's teachings (in variant forms) gaining them widespread popularity, Sarug taking Lurianic Kabbalah to Europe, Vital authoring the latterly canonical version. Luria's teachings came to rival {{the influence of the}} Zohar and Luria stands, alongside Moses de Leon, as the most influential mystic in Jewish history.|$|E
25|$|The work of Nikolai Roslavets, {{unlike that}} of Prokofiev and Stravinsky, is often seen as a direct {{extension}} of Scriabin's. Unlike Scriabin's, however, Roslavets' music was not explained with mysticism and eventually was given theoretical <b>explication</b> by the composer. Roslavets {{was not alone in}} his innovative extension of Scriabin's musical language, however, as quite a few Soviet composers and pianists such as Samuil Feinberg, Sergei Protopopov, Nikolai Myaskovsky, and Alexander Mosolov followed this legacy until Stalinist politics quelled it in favor of Socialist Realism.|$|E
25|$|The φ4 theory example above {{demonstrates}} that the coupling parameters of a quantum field theory can be scale-dependent even if the corresponding classical field theory is scale-invariant (or conformally invariant).

A classically scale invariant field theory, where scale invariance is broken by quantum effects, provides an <b>explication</b> of the nearly exponential expansion of the early universe called cosmic inflation, as long as the theory can be studied through perturbation theory.|$|E
