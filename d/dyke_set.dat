40|$|The east-coast {{section of}} the Lizard {{ophiolite}} complex, Cornwall, U. K., preserves a series of interrelated extensional faults and <b>dyke</b> <b>sets</b> which indicate that the formation of this section of obducted oceanic lithosphere resulted {{from a combination of}} contemporaneous structural and magmatic events. Three dolerite <b>dyke</b> <b>sets</b> are evident; the first two (sets 1 and 2) are cut by and rotated on a series of ridge-parallel, extensional faults and shear zones. Later <b>dykes</b> (<b>set</b> 3) cross-cut the extensional faults. These data indicate that both rotation and significant thinning, in the region of 40 %, of this part of the oceanic lithosphere occurred prior to the final period of dyke injection. The thinning of the lithosphere was the result of extension along the normal faults. All of the dolerite dykes show MORB characteristics, although the late <b>dykes</b> (<b>set</b> 3) are more primitive, tending to be aphyric to sparse olivine-phyric and show higher Cr, Ni and lower Zr values than the typically plagioclase phyric dolerite <b>dykes</b> (<b>sets</b> 1 and 2) intruded prior to the ductile shearing event. The more primitive dolerites post-date the tectonism and indicate the lack of a significant magma chamber following a period of amagmatic extension. The data are consistent with observations at present day slow-spreading ridge-axes and some mafic-ultramafic ophiolite sequences, and provide insight into the nature of ridge-related structures and the interrelationships between tectonism and geochemical evolution of the dykes, and record a mechanism (listric faulting) to account for the presence of peridotites and gabbros commonly dredged at slow-spreading centres. <br/...|$|R

40|$|The Aillik Bay {{alkaline}} intrusive suite comprises dykes of alkaline lamprophyre (sannaite and olivine sannaite), kimberlite and carbonatite. Structural and mineralogical criteria {{indicate that}} the dykes are related to an intrusive centre of nephelinite-carbonatite type situated beneath the Labrador Sea to the northeast of the study area. [...] Dykes were emplaced in three structural episodes; two concentric sets are separated in time by a dominant radial set. Sannaites make up the first set and {{the bulk of the}} second whereas kimberlites and carbonatites exclusively occupy the third <b>dyke</b> <b>set.</b> Formation of segmented dykes is attributed to flow instabilities enhanced by a volatile-rich fluid moving ahead of the magma. This fluid was presumably exsolved from the magma as a result of pressure reduction during emplacement, and also assisted in the formation of parallel fracture zones adjacent to kimberlites and carbonatites. [...] Sannaites are characterised by leucocratic ocelli which are frequently zoned: a central zone dominated by carbonate and analcite gives way to an outer zone of Fe-mica, pyroxene, nepheline, K-feldspar and analcite. The outer zones were formed by segregation of late-stage melt. One sample bears globules which are clearly the result of liquid immiscibility. Immiscibilty and segregation are accompanied by concentration of incompatible elements. Groundmass mineralogy shows chemical evolution similar to nepheline syenites. [...] Minerals in kimberlite delineate a more complex history, beginning at depth in a low oxygen fugacity environment. Kimberlites lack high pressure equilibrated diamond 'marker' minerals, and thus diamond potential is low. Carbonatites typically exhibit relict kimberlitic textures. Sannaite and olivine sannaite were derived by flow differentiation from a parental magma, the composition of which is defined. All rock types were derived by partial melting of an incompatible element enriched mantle source. Structural inheritance permitted successive emplacement of rocks representing progressively smaller and deeper derived melt fractions via the intrusive centre...|$|E
40|$|The {{island of}} Iona is {{composed}} predominantly of Lewisian gneisses with Torridonian sediments outcropping {{on the east}} side. The Lewisian gneisses include {{a wide range of}} lithological types. The prevalent quartzfeldspathic gneisses are biotite-hornblende-bearing, potash-rich and potash-poor varieties and hypersthene-biotite-garnet gneisses. Metasediments outcrop in two associations (i) within a sequence of basic and ultrabasic rocks (the ‘Amphibolite Group’) and (ii) in the NW of Iona (the NW Paragneisses). The Amphibolite Group contains concordant marble and iron-rich horizons which delineate the major fold structures in south and west Iona. Chemical analyses of the metasediments and basic rocks in the Amphibolite Group indicate that the sequence was probably originally a supracrustal group composed of tuffs, lavas, impure limestone and iron-rich chemical deposits. The NW paragneiss group may be a younger group of metasediments comprising graphite-quartz marbles, calc-silicate layers, graphitic schists, and garnet schists. The tectonic history of the gneisses divides into six main deformations. The first (D₁) is represented by isoclinal intrafolial hinges with a penetrative S₁ foliation. The second deformation produced isoclinal folds with rounded hinges deforming the S₁ foliation. D₃ generated tight asymmetrical folds accompanied by a hornblende granulite facies metamorphism with syntectonic mineral growths defining S₃ and L₃, and axial planar pegmatite veins. The axial planes are generally at low angles to the foliation, which typically trends NE or E. D₄ folds are mostly large close folds with shallow short limbs and axial planes trending NE with NW dips, whilst D₆ formed open folds with N-trending axial planes, and accompanied by a high amphibolite facies metamorphism. Basic dykes were intruded at various stages of the tectonic sequence: before D₁, between D₁ and D₂, D₂ and D₃, and D₅ and D₆. The dykes can be divided into distinct types on petrographical, chemical, and structural grounds. One set, the Banded Dykes, is composed of two intimately associated assemblages, hornblende-two-pyroxene-plagioclase and garnet-quartz-clinopyroxene-plagioclase. The latter is thought to have developed from the former during waning temperatures at constant pressure during D₃. The Banded Dykes also have distinct selvedges of an unusual mineral assemblage, garnet-orthopyroxene-plagioclase, probably due in part to chilling of the dyke on intrusion but mostly formed by metasomatic interchange with the enclosing gneisses during D₂ and D₃. Another <b>dyke</b> <b>set,</b> the Well-Lineated Dykes, also has these distinctive selvedges. These dykes also display a very well defined lineation formed by elongated clots of mafic minerals, and have a more basic chemistry {{than any of the other}} dyke sets. They appear to be comparable to the two-pyroxene norites of the Assynt district. The Torridonian(?) sediments were deposited on the Lewisian after uplift and erosion. After consolidation they were probably metamorphosed at low greenschist facies. Activity on the Moine Thrust thrust the Moinian on to the Torridonian. Thrusting was accompanied by dynamic metamorphism, mylonitization of the Lewisian/Torridonian boundary, rotation of the Torridonian bedding planes to a steep SE dip and the formation of isoclinal folds, in association with a steep SE-dipping cleavage and an ESE elongation lineation. This deformation (D[subscript(t 1) ]) was followed by a generation of tight asymmetrical folds (D[subscript(t 2) ]) which deformed the mylonite foliation and was accompanied by a weak N-trending axial planar cleavage. D[subscript(t 3) ] produced kink bands and monoclonal folds with sub-horizontal fold axes, whilst D[subscript(t 4) ] caused conjugate or knee folds with NE- and SE-, and N- and E- trending axial planes. A pluton of adamellite, the Ross of Mull Granite, was intruded along the Moine Thrust plane after [subscript(t 2) ], and caused the thermal metamorphism of the Torridonian sediments, the mylonites and nearby Lewisian gneisses. The D[subscript(t 1) ] - D[subscript(t 4) ] events correlate closely with those occurring in the Moine Thrust zone between Durness and Skye...|$|E

40|$|The Vestfold Hills, Antarctica, an {{ice-free}} {{region of}} ea. 400 km 2, {{is a well}} exposed terrane of deep Archaean and Proterozoic crust which has been strongly interfolded and transposed. Between 2350 and 1100 Ma a dense network of mafic dykes intruded at mid- to upper crustal depths. Crosscutting relationships distinguish 9 different <b>dyke</b> <b>sets</b> intruded in three magmatic episodes. These three episodes exhibit distinct directional trends suggesting rotation of the regional crustal stress field over the period 2350 to 1150 Ma. During the first magmatic episode high-Mg tholeiites were emplaced at about 2350 Ma together with Fe-rich tholeiites. A second magmatic period has been inferred at 1800 Ma in which a further set of Fe-rich tholeiites was emplaced. Radiogenic dating of the 1800 Ma dykes is not well constrained and field observations from {{this study did not}} clarify the relationship of these dykes to the older (2350 Ma) Fe-rich tholeiites. A third magmatic episode, which occurred between 1350 and 1150 Ma, emplaced two <b>sets</b> of lamprophyric <b>dykes</b> and Fe-rich tholeiites, in at least four separate events. Previous studies have concluded that the 2350 Ma old high-Mg tholeiites were emplaced at deep crustal levels (7 - 8 kbar). New pressure estimates based on aluminium exchange between clinopyroxene and plagioclase and on pressure dependent trends of magmatic evolution reveal that these dykes were more likely emplaced at considerably lower levels (< 5 kb), possibly as low as 1 - 2 kbar. This requires much faster uplift of the Vestfold Hills block, during the late Archaean and early Proterozoic, than previously thought The 2350 Ma high-Mg tholeiites can be divided into 3 geochemically distinct groups which are not related by simple crystal fractionation processes. The high Si 02 and MgO, and low Ti 02 magmas and are enriched in platinum group elements and gold: all characteristic of siliceous high magnesian basalts (SHMB). A fundamental question arises as to whether these geochemical characteristics are primary features inherited from the mantle or whether the magmas have been modified through assimilation of continental crust. This has been assessed by evaluating the extent to which differentiation processes are able to account for geochemical variations within one of the largest dykes in the Vestfold Hills has been studied in detail. This dyke is found to be of virtual homogeneous composition, apart from some minor variations in major- and trace elements which are consistent with limited in situ differentiation. Major and minor element geochemistry shows no evidence exists for crustal contamination in this dyke. A large noritic ring complex (ea. 7 - 8 km in diameter) is associated with the intrusion of the 2350 Ma high-Mg tholeiite suite. It consists of several partly isolated bodies which vary in width from 70 to 400 m. This complex comprises three lithological units: (1) Homogeneous Norite, the most uniform and voluminous unit, containing cumulus orthopyroxene with clinopyroxene and plagioclase as intercumulus phases, (2) the Mottled Norite, a unit characterized by large 1 - 2 cm plagioclase - alkali-feldspar aggregates, and (3) the Rubbly Norite, a less common variant, distinguished by patches of bronzitic orthopyroxene, cognate and inherited xenoliths, and globules of sulphide. The xenoliths are mostly orthopyroxenites but also include websterites, sapphirine-bearing fine-grained quartzite, and feldspathic gneiss. The sulphide-rich zones range in size from 4 to 30 m in width, with extensions up to 400 m in length {{in the southern part of}} the complex. Evidence for multiple intrusion suggests the Rubbly Norite was subsequently emptaced into the the Homogeneous and Mottled Norite units...|$|R
40|$|The Ság-hegy {{volcanic}} {{complex is}} located in the little Hungarian Plain Volcanic Field (LHPVF). An 39 Ar/ 40 Ar geochronolgy gave an isochron age of 5, 42 ± 0, 06 My for the Ság- hegy (Wijbrans et al. 2004). Evolution of the volcano included two clearly distinct events. At first ascending magma entered meteoric water in a fluvio-lacustrine environment. Fuel-coolant interaction (FCI) of water (water saturated sediment) and magma {{led to the formation of}} a phreatomagmatic tuff ring. After water supply was used up the interior of the tephra ring was filled by a lava lake. Locally the tuff ring wall collapsed and subsequently lava was able to flow out of the tuff ring. Due to intensive quarrying most of the effusive rocks have been removed, giving excellent insight to emplacement processes of feeder dykes, sills and lava lake remnant (Martin and Németh, 2004). Pyroclastic rocks include massive and bedded units of lapilli stone, lapilli tuff/ tuff as well as pyroclastic breccias. Varying proportions of accidental lithic clasts indicate excavation of basement rocks during the erruption. Juvenile clasts comprise mainly of angular, blocky sideromelane glass shards with nearly equent shapes and a minor proportion of tachylite. A high amount of water within the systeme is evidenced by soft sediment deformation and accretionary lapilli in the pyroclastic bedsets. Dune and antidune bedding, chute and pool structures grading and sorting features suggest that the tuff ring was gradually built up by base surge and intercalated fallout deposits. Subsequent to the phreatomagmatic stage the inner crater has been filled with a lava lake which morphology was determined by the tephra deposits. At contacts to the pyroclastics a chilled margin of several cm thickness is developed which shows platty (onion shaped) jointing. A high number of dykes and sills were injected into adjacent bedsets. These shallow intrusive bodys can be found throughout the whole complex truncating and dissecting the pyroclastic units. In cases where pyroclastic units comprised a high amount of water this included even mingling with the wet tephra, leading to the formation of peperites. The uppermost units were represented by thick lava flows, which covered all underlaying units. These rocks were quarryed out already a century ago except a large strombolian spatter cone which is now exposed at the uppermost level of the quarry as a big sliced remnant including its large multiple feeder <b>dyke.</b> This <b>setting</b> offers a perfect opportunity to study the relationship between dyke and sill enplacement with transitions from vertical to bedding-parallel geometries. Dimensions of the volcanic bodies range from cm thickness of small apophyses from the lava lake into the pyroclastic rocks up to dykes and sills of several m. We performed a detailed study on a section of pyroclastic rocks truncated by dykes and sills and have evaluated the magnetic characteristics. Preliminary results show that magnetic susceptibility of all the pyroclastic units is in the range of ferrimagnetic susceptibility and varies between 2 to 20 x 10 - 3 SI. (Fig. 1). Magnetic fabric anisotropy is generally low (< 5 %) and in the field of oblate fabric geometries, in bedded tuffs a significantly higher (5 to 10 %) but also oblate anisotropy is realized. Magnetic lineations indicate a consistent NE (020) directed material transport for the whole succession. Remanence intensities are quite high with values of 1 to 15 A/m In the pyroclastic units a stable magnetic remanence characterized by a single vector component has been measured, MDF values are in the range of 30 to 160 mT. The field vector has exclusively reversed polarity and steep inclination, which is in agreement with the paleofield direction and therefore is regarded as natural remanent magnetization aquired during deposition of the pyroclastic successions. In the dykes and sills, however, remanence direction scatter significantly and display geometries ranging from steep to flat orientations and show also strong variations in the declination. Coercitivity of magnetic carriers is significanty lower as indicated by the lower MDF values which are in the range of 8 to 30 mT in the dykes and 15 to 30 mT in sills. Beside a minor contribution of a viscose component the remanence vector in the dykes and sills is characterized by a stable single component. However, further investigations are needed to fully understand and interpret the result...|$|R
40|$|The NE Atlantic margin plays host to {{numerous}} basins, developed in phases from the Devono-Carboniferous {{through to the}} Cenozoic, which record the build up to plate separation and formation of the North Atlantic Ocean. Existing models for this invoke broadly NW-SE extension within the basins, which are segmented by regional-scale NW-SE trending strike-slip lineaments, which are commonly termed ‘transfer zones’. However, {{there is a general}} paucity of information concerning the true kinematics of the so-called transfer zones. In this study, the Palaeogene and later structural evolution of the NE Atlantic margin is investigated using abundant field data collected on the Faroe Islands, and systematic observations that characterise the related deformation structures developed in the Faroe Islands Basalt Group (FIBG). Structures in the Faroe Islands provide evidence for a 6 -stage tectonic evolution, here split into 3 broad phases: (1 a) E-W to NE-SW extension, accommodated by dip-slip N-S and NW-SE trending faults. Continued NE-SW extension (1 b) was then accommodated by the emplacement of a regionally significant NW-SE- and NNE-SSW-oriented dyke swarm. Event 1 affects the majority of the FIBG stratigraphy, resulting in thickness variations, most notably across the Judd, Brynhild and Westray (‘transfer’) fault-zones. Continued magmatism and anticlockwise rotation of the extension vector led to (2 a) the emplacement of ENE-WSW and ESE-WNW conjugate dykes, followed by intrusion of the large, saucer-shaped sills on the islands. Their intrusion heralded the onset of N-S crustal extension and was followed by (2 b) crustal extrusion involving both E-W shortening and further N-S extension facilitated primarily by slip on ENE-WSW (dextral) and ESE-WNW (sinistral) conjugate strike-slip faults, interlinked with minor NE and SW dipping thrust faults. During the final stages of this event (2 c), the regional extension vector rotated into a NW-SE orientation that was accommodated predominantly by slip along NE-SW oriented dextral-oblique-slip faults. Event 2 began towards the end of magmatism associated with the FIBG, and most likely continued through to the onset of oceanic-spreading on the Aegir ridge (ca. 55 Ma). Finally, (3) Event 1 and 2 structures were reactivated as extension and extensional-hybrid features, characterised best by the entrainment of clastic material along fault planes. Relative timings of Event 3 structures suggest they formed during a period of compression and uplift following the formation of a through-going mid-ocean ridge system (i. e. on the Reykjanes, Kolbeinsey and Mohns ridges). The progressive anticlockwise rotation of the extension vector identified here is broadly consistent with the most recent NE Atlantic continental break-up reconstructions. Importantly, this model does not require basin-scale transfer zones during the Palaeogene, suggesting instead that these NW-SE faults formed as normal faults during a pre-cursor margin-parallel extension episode (Event 1) prior to the onset of oceanic spreading in the Faroe-Iceland sector. This study emphasises the importance of carrying out detailed field studies in addition to the more usual regional-scale modelling studies, in order to validate and add further detail to basin kinematic histories. Mineralised syn- to post-magmatic fault sets display a recurring zeolite-calcite-zeolite trend in mineralisation products, which precipitate during successive phases of fault development during each individual event. Fault style and damage zone width appear {{to be related to the}} stage of fault development, with early fault/vein meshes linking to form through-going structures with associated damage zones. Dykes and sills are found to form their own fractures, rather than exploiting pre-existing <b>sets.</b> <b>Dyke</b> propagation appears to be buoyancy-driven, with magmatic pressure overcoming the minimum compressive stress. Sills, however, most likely seeded at an interface in the stratigraphy between a weak, more ductile material (i. e. a sedimentary horizon), and a rigid material (i. e. basalt lavas) above. Following this initial development, sill growth and propagation would likely be controlled by viscous dissipation, leading to the complex ramp and flat architecture, with rapid intrusion resulting in upward ramping of the sill. The alternation from fault events, to dyke events and back again corresponds to a switch from faulting with mineralisation along extensional hybrid veins, to magmatic intrusions into extension fractures followed by extensional hybrids (conjugates), and back to extensional and shear hybrid faults (again as conjugates). This alternation reflects variations in the differential regional stress, as well as the magmatic evolution of the margin, and most likely relates to the migration of lithospheric thinning northwestwards across the area, towards the eventual axis of break-up. We find that, in particular, faults in basalts are in many ways comparable to faults formed at shallow crustal depths in carbonate rocks and crystalline basement, most likely reflecting the similarities in their mechanical properties under near-surface pressures and temperatures. The nature and style of the post-magmatic fault infills provides compelling evidence to suggest that subterranean cavities associated with faults were persistent open features within the FIBG. Structures equivalent to these late, clastic-filled faults of the Faroes may occur in other parts of the NE Atlantic margin, particularly along the axes of gentle regional-scale folds that are widely developed in the region. The late fault displacements observed are all well below seismic resolution, and such structures may be more widespread across the region than previously anticipated. Importantly, the probable unsealed nature of the clastic infills makes them potential fluid-migration pathways, both up- and across-faults within the Cenozoic volcanic sequences of the NE Atlantic region. ...|$|R
