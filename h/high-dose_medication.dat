40|$|BACKGROUND. Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, {{angiotensin}} II antagonists, and the ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) {{gene polymorphism}} all influence serum angiotensin II action. Because angiotensin II levels {{have been associated}} with cancer, the objective of the current epidemiologic study was to investigate whether renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and/or ACE genotypes were associated with an altered risk of colorectal, lung, breast, and prostate cancer. METHODS. Data were obtained from the Rotterdam Study, a population-based, prospective cohort study with 7983 participants. Participants who had a history of 1 of the cancers of interest (n = 216) or who had a medication history < 6 months (n = 88) were excluded, leaving 7679 participants, of whom the ACE genotypes could be assessed in 6670 individuals. The mean follow-up was 9. 6 years, during which 730 incident cancers occurred. The effect of medication, ACE I/D genotypes, and their interaction on cancer risk and progression was studied by using Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS. Carriers of the high-activity genotype DD had an increased risk of breast cancer compared with low-activity II/ID genotype carriers (hazard ratio [HR], 1. 47; 95 % confidence interval [95 % CI], 1. 05 - 2. 04), but no association was demonstrated for other cancers. DD carriers who were exposed to long-term and <b>high-dose</b> <b>medication</b> were at lower risk for cancer (HR, 0. 28; 95 % CI, 0. 10 - 0. 79). Short-term, high-dose users were at risk for colorectal cancer progression in the II/ID stratum (HR, 3. 83; 95 % CI, 1. 67 - 8. 79). CONCLUSIONS. Renin-angiotensin system-inhibiting drugs seemed to protect against cancer in individuals with the DD genotype, which was associated with high levels of ACE...|$|E
40|$|Objective　Depending on the {{stratification}} of risk factors, {{to observe}} the efficacy and safety of different doses of atorvastatin in patients of northern Han population with acute ischemic cerebrovascular disease. Methods　One hundred and sixty patients with acute ischemic cerebrovascular disease, admitted from Oct. 2013 to Jan. 2014, were involved in present study, and they were divided into three groups according to the etiology and pathogenesis. In addition to routine treatment, three groups of patients were given 20 mg (n= 50), 40 mg (n= 50) and 60 mg (n= 60) atorvastatin, respectively. Lipids contents, liver function, renal function, muscle enzymes, high sensitivity C reactive protein (hCRP) levels, and NIH Stroke scale (NIHSS) score were determined respectively before treatment and before discharge from the hospital. Results　Blood lipid levels were reduced in all the 3 groups, total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein cholesterol-C (HDL-C) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol-C (LDL-C) lowered obviously with significant difference among the 3 groups (P 0. 05). The highest compliance rate of LDL-C was observed in 60 mg group. Compared with those before treatment, the mean levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were elevated, and that of total bilirubin (TBil) and direct bilirubin (DBil) declined after treatment (P 0. 05). The average level of creatine kinase (CK) was lowered (P 0. 05). NIHSS scores were decreased in a dose-dependent manner after treatment with no significant difference among the 3 groups (P= 0. 157). Conclusions　Atorvastatin can safely and effectively reduce the blood lipid levels, improve the neurological deficits, and reduce the hCRP level to certain extent. Administration of 60 mg of atorvastatin may result in highest compliance rate of LDL-C and the greatest degree of improvement of NIHSS. However, further study should be untaken to demonstrate if the long-term and <b>high-dose</b> <b>medication</b> of atorvastatin is safe and effective for ischemic stroke.

50|$|Long-term opioid (e.g. heroin, morphine) {{users and}} those on <b>high-dose</b> opioid <b>medications</b> for the {{treatment}} of chronic pain, may experience hyperalgesia and experience pain out of proportion to physical findings, which is a common cause for loss of efficacy of these medications over time. As {{it can be difficult to}} distinguish from tolerance, opioid-induced hyperalgesia is often compensated for by escalating the dose of opioid, potentially worsening the problem by further increasing sensitivity to pain. Chronic hyperstimulation of opioid receptors results in altered homeostasis of pain signalling pathways in the body with several mechanisms of action involved. One major pathway being through stimulation of the nociceptin receptor, and blocking this receptor may therefore be a means of preventing the development of hyperalgesia.|$|R
40|$|High-dose {{corticosteroids}} {{in combination}} with cytotoxic drugs are universally accepted as the initial approach in vasculitides {{that are associated with}} anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Cyclophosphamide is the most effective cytotoxic drug and is used in more severe cases. Because cyclophosphamide has more severe short- and long-term side-effects than methotrexate, methotrexate is used in less severe cases. New prospects for the treatment of vasculitis include novel immunosuppressive agents (e,g. mycophenolate, 15 -deoxyspergualin, and leflunomide), sequential chemotherapy (e. g. cyclophosphamide followed by azathioprine or cyclophosphamide followed by methotrexate), intravenous immunoglobulin, tumour necrosis factor-a directed therapy, antilymphocyte directed therapy (e. g, antithymocyte globulin or anti CD 52 /anti CD 4 antibodies), anti-adhesion molecule directed therapy (e. g. anti-CD 18 or intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 antisense) or immunoablation using <b>high-dose</b> cytotoxic <b>medication</b> with or without stem cell rescue.

30|$|Historically, {{in adult}} {{patients}} with sepsis and cardiogenic shock, vasoactive medication scoring systems have predominantly {{been used to}} classify the extent of hemodynamic support [21 – 23]. Vasoactive medications are used in an empiric fashion and often there are limited bedside data on cumulative vasopressor requirements [24]. Vasoactive medications are a severity of illness indicator; however, they are incompletely accounted for in scoring systems. More recent data have shown vasoactive medication requirements to be an independent predictor of adverse outcomes [11, 25 – 27]. The need for high-dose vasopressors reflects a potentially fatal underlying condition with {{a high risk of}} complications, but the direct association remains to be proven. Though the VIS has been used to prognosticate in a smaller cohort of 138 pediatric patients with sepsis [28], this is the first large study using existing vasoactive scoring systems in the prognostication of adult septic shock patients. Prior studies have used either norepinephrine or cumulative vasopressor requirements to demonstrate higher mortality in patients with septic shock [27, 29]. In about 20 – 40 % of septic patients, persistent vasoplegia results in refractory shock necessitating <b>high-dose</b> vasoactive <b>medications,</b> with a very high attributable mortality [29]. Refractory vasoplegia in sepsis is multi-factorial and usually fatal, leading investigators to evaluate alternate mechanisms of restoring vascular tone in these patients [6, 30]. High doses of vasopressors are associated with significant adverse events such as arrhythmias, myocardial infarctions, digital injury/ischemia and acute kidney injury [26, 27].|$|R
40|$|Objective: We {{conducted}} a single-centre, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase II clinical study to test {{safety and efficacy}} of a 12 -week therapy with low-dose (700 mg/daily) or high-dose (2800 mg/daily) of NAC. Methods: Twenty-one patients (∆F 508 homo/hetero-zygous, FEV 1 > 40 % pred.) {{were included in the}} study. After a 3 -weeks placebo run-in phase, 11 pa-tients received low-dose NAC, and 10 patients re-ceived high-dose NAC. Outcomes included safety and clinical parameters, inflammatory (total leukocyte numbers, cell differentials, TNF-α, IL- 8) measures in induced sputum, and concentrations of extracellular glutathione in induced sputum and blood. Results: High-dose NAC was a well-tolerated and safe <b>medication.</b> <b>High-dose</b> NAC did not alter clinical or inflammatory parameters.

40|$|Although the {{incidence}} of new cases of asthma has decreased in recent years, the prevalence of asthma morbidity {{continues to be a}} significant clinical and public health issue. The measures of morbidity include the need for urgent medical care and <b>high-dose</b> asthma <b>medications</b> due to uncontrolled asthma symptoms. However, the risk factors for uncontrolled asthma symptoms are poorly defined, especially for the adult asthmatic. Much interest in the host-environment interaction has evolved in response to the greater morbidity observed in adult asthmatics. Thus, the need to identify risk factors is greater than ever. An underlying problem is that surveillance for asthma does not exist at the local or state level. Here we address the concept of environmental health surveillance by demonstrating the utility of local asthma hospitalization data to estimate the burden of asthma morbidity in hopes of identifying environmental risk factors. We examine this burden within 2 geographic settings: 1. a selected urban-rural setting in Pennsylvania and 2. within the 89 zip codes in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. We also demonstrate that such hospitalization records are a rich source for data needed to generate hypotheses with respect to the prevalence of environmental risk factors and chronic disease morbidity. Lastly, we demonstrate the use of a non-invasive biomarker (i. e. antibodies specific for atypical respiratory pathogens) to assess the risk of exposure to a biological environmental agent to adult asthma morbidity. Given the poor understanding of risk factors for adult asthma prevalence and morbidity, this research is both relevant and important in addressing environmental public health disparities...|$|R

We aimed at comparing the effectiveness of different doses of steroid using the ultrasound-guided hydrodissection method in elderly patients with CTS. Methods: We conducted a prospective, triple-blind, randomized, controlled trial in elderly patients with CTS. Patients were allocated to one of three groups by simplified randomization. Groups I–III received 80 mg triamcinolone (2 mL) and 1 mL of 2 % lidocaine; 40 mg triamcinolone (1 mL), 1  mL of 2 % lidocaine, and 1 mL normal saline; and 1 mL of 2 % lidocaine and 2 mL normal saline, respectively to make up to 3 mL volume. A wrist splint was then applied for support. Outcome measures included the visual analog scale (VAS) and the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire, and median motor and sensory nerve conduction and its sonographic inlet cross-sectional area were used as objective measures. All data were recorded at baseline and 2, 12, and 24 weeks after injection. The investigators, patients, and statistician were blinded to the treatment assignment. Results: In total, 161 patients were recruited without statistically significant demographic differences between the three groups. There were no statistically significant differences between groups in any outcome, {{with the exception of the}} median distal motor latency, which was greater in Group II at all three follow-up visits, and significant baseline VAS difference between Groups I and III. Conclusion: Hydrodissection with lidocaine and normal saline is as effective as hydrodissection with low- and <b>high-dose</b> steroid <b>medication</b> in elderly patients with CTS in this study, but further studies with matched baseline measures and also a sham group are suggested for definitive recommendation.
