5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} {{have been}} known to hybridize with other dolphin species. Hybrids with Risso's dolphin occur both in the wild and in captivity. The best <b>known</b> <b>is</b> the wolphin, a false killer whale-bottlenose dolphin hybrid. The wolphin is fertile, and two currently live at the Sea Life Park in Hawaii. The first was born in 1985 to a female bottlenose. Wolphins also exist in the wild. In captivity, a bottlenose dolphin and a rough-toothed dolphin hybridized. A common dolphin-bottlenose dolphin hybrid born in captivity lives at SeaWorld California. Other hybrids live in captivity around the world and in the wild, such as a bottlenose dolphin-Atlantic spotted dolphin hybrid.|$|E
5|$|Despite its toxicity, T.floccosus {{is one of}} the ten wild {{mushrooms}} most widely consumed by ethnic tribes in Meghalaya, northeast India, and is highly regarded by the Sherpa people in the vicinity of Sagarmatha National Park in Nepal. What is not <b>known</b> <b>is</b> whether the Indian populations of T.floccosus are nontoxic, or whether the local people have developed an immunity to it. It is also enjoyed in Mexico. American mycologist David Arora reported that some enjoyed it while he felt it had a strong sour taste.|$|E
5|$|Firm {{evidence}} for specific early {{performances of the}} play is scant. What is <b>known</b> <b>is</b> that {{the crew of the}} ship Red Dragon, anchored off Sierra Leone, performed Hamlet in September 1607; that the play toured in Germany within five years of Shakespeare's death; and that it was performed before James I in 1619 and Charles I in 1637. Oxford editor George Hibbard argues that, since the contemporary literature contains many allusions and references to Hamlet (only Falstaff is mentioned more, from Shakespeare), the play was surely performed with a frequency that the historical record misses.|$|E

5|$|From 1947 to 1960 {{the country}} {{seems to have}} been divided into three major {{military}} regions: Cluj, Bacău, and Bucharest in the west, east, and south, respectively. In wartime the land forces in each military region would become an army corps with their headquarters in Cluj-Napoca, Iaşi, and Bucharest. Armies seem to have succeeded military regions in 1960, and three armies seem to have become four in 1980. What is <b>known</b> <b>is</b> that on 01.07.1947 Fourth Army became 3rd Military Region, based in Cluj. The 3rd Military Region became the 3rd Army on 30 April 1960, and the 4th Army on 5 April 1980.|$|E

It was discovered on 13 October 1935 by Egyptologist George A. Reisner during a joint Harvard University-Boston Museum of Fine Arts expedition, and removed from the site four days later.|$|E
5|$|The {{preceding}} pair of transits {{occurred in}} December 1874 and December 1882; the following pair {{will occur in}} December 2117 and December 2125. The oldest film <b>known</b> <b>is</b> the 1874 Passage de Venus, showing the 1874 Venus transit of the sun. Historically, transits of Venus were important, because they allowed astronomers to determine {{the size of the}} astronomical unit, and hence the size of the Solar System as shown by Horrocks in 1639. Captain Cook's exploration of the east coast of Australia came after he had sailed to Tahiti in 1768 to observe a transit of Venus.|$|E

Domesticated rock pigeons are also bred as carrier pigeons, used {{for thousands of years}} to carry brief written messages, and release doves used in ceremonies.

What is <b>known</b> <b>is</b> that the composition of the copper-oxide materials must be precisely controlled for superconductivity to occur.|$|E
5|$|There {{are nine}} species of insect only found on C.australis, {{of which the}} best <b>known</b> <b>is</b> Epiphryne verriculata, the cabbage tree moth, which is {{perfectly}} adapted to hide on a dead leaf.

The caterpillars eat holes in the surface of the leaves and leave characteristic notches in the leaf margins. They can infest young trees but seldom damage older trees, which lack the skirt of dead leaves where the parent moths like to hide.|$|E
