40|$|Single {{crystals}} of L-Valinium picrate {{were grown}} from aqueous solution by slow evaporation technique. Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis {{reveals that the}} crystal belongs to monoclinic system. The optical transmission study reveals the transparency of the crystal in the entire visible region and the cut off wave length {{has been found to}} be 470 nm. The optical band gap is found to be 2. 55 eV. The transmittance of L-Valinium picrate crystal has been used to calculate the refractive index (n), the extinction coefficient (K) and both the real (εr) and imaginary (εi) components of the dielectric constant as functions of wavelength. Low dielectric loss at high frequency region is indicative of enhanced optical quality with lesser <b>defects.</b> <b>Photoconductivity</b> measurements carried out on the grown crystal reveal the negative photoconducting nature...|$|R

This result cannot be {{interpreted by the}} classical mechanism of electron-hole pair generation followed by recombination through gap states. We assume that the incident photons create photoinduced defects whose structure is IVAP-like.

40|$|Hydrogenated {{amorphous}} silicon germanium (a-SiGe:H) has important applications in solar cell technology. In order to maximize efficiency of solar cells, the semiconductor {{materials used in}} them must have a low <b>defect</b> density. <b>Photoconductivity</b> is sensitive to defect density, so measurements and modeling of photoconductivity are important diagnostics for a-SiGe:H. In this work, the photoconductivity of thin film samples of a-SiGe:H were measured at carrier generation rates for 10 (14) to 10 (17) cm(- 3) s(- 1) and temperatures from 80 K to 310 K. The experimental data was compared to two numerical models published in the literature. One model, by Shen and Wagner(1), used a simple model for recombination and transport and was reproduced here in (see Appendix) in order to fit the acquired data. The total density of states and distribution in the band gap was varied. However, the model predicted a greater decrease in photoconductivity at low temperatures than was observed in the experimental data for all cases. The second model by Merazga et al (2), which included recombination of electrons and holes and transport in the band tail states, {{appears to be in}} better agreement with the data...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of radiation <b>defects</b> on <b>photoconductivity</b> transients and photoluminescence (PL) spectra {{have been examined}} in semi-insulating GaN epitaxial layers grown on bulk n-GaN/sapphire substrates. Defects induced by 10 -keV X-ray irradiation with a dose of 600 Mrad and 100 -keV neutrons with fluences of 5 × 1014 and 1016 cm− 2 have been revealed through contact photoconductivity and microwave absorption transients. The amplitude of the initial photoconductivity decay is significantly reduced by the radiation defect density. A simultaneous decrease with radiation-induced defect density is also observed in the steady-state PL intensity of yellow, blue and ultraviolet bands peaked at 2. 18, 2. 85, and 3. 42 eV, respectively. The decrease of the PL intensity is accompanied by an increase of asymptotic decay lifetime, {{which is due to}} excess carrier multi-trapping. The decay can be described by the stretched exponential approximation exp[-(t/τ) α] with different values of α in as-grown material (α≈ 0. 7) and irradiated samples (α≈ 0. 3). The value of the fracton dimension ds of the disordered structure, evaluated as ds= 2 α/(1 -α), changes from 4. 7 to 0. 86 for as-grown and irradiated material, respectively, implying percolative carrier motion on an infinite cluster of dislocations net in the as-grown material and cluster fragmentation into finite fractons after irradiation...|$|R
30|$|Interband {{transitions}} in the wetting layer {{contribute to the}} PC spectra from 1.39  eV. At photon energies less than the band gap of nanostructures (~ 1.06  eV at 290  K), observational PC component is not associated with interband transitions. This photoconductivity component is associated with {{transitions in}}volving deep levels in the InGaAs or GaAs bandgap. Since 0.74  eV, PC increase causes electronic transitions involving EL 2 center in GaAs [15, 16]. This deep defect EL 2 is well-known donor, who may have several different ionized charge states: EL 20, EL 2 +, and EL 2 ++. Transitions from deep levels, Ec– 0, 74  eV, close {{to the middle of}} the GaAs band gap [15], GaAs to conduction band generate free electrons and change the state of centers charge, for example changing such as EL 20 [*]→[*]EL 2 +. At the same time, electron transitions from the GaAs valence band to Ev[*]+[*] 0.67  eV and Ev[*]+[*] 0.47  eV (at 82  K) EL 2 + and EL 2 ++ centers, lead to the appearance of free holes due to changes EL 2 +[*]→[*]EL 20 and EL 2 ++[*]→[*]EL 2 +, respectively [16]. The scheme of electronic transitions in InGaAs/GaAs heterostructures, obtained by PL and PC spectroscopy, is shown in Fig.  3 b. It is shown that the contribution in photoconductivity from 0.74 to ~ 1.1  eV due to transitions across EL 2 level is observed for both samples with QD and QWR. We can conclude the role of EL 2 <b>defects</b> for <b>photoconductivity</b> typical for samples with varying morphology (QD and QWR).|$|R
40|$|Recently ternary {{compounds}} of CsPbX 3 (X=Cl, Br, I) {{produced by}} co-evaporating CsX and PbX 2 purified powders are attracting much interest for their interesting optical characteristics and potential applications in luminescence based detector and devices. Indeed, nano-crystallites are {{produced in the}} thin film material as evidenced by optical spectroscopy and X-Ray diffraction. These ternary nano-aggregates are wide-gap semiconductors with direct band-to-band transition. Identification of the nano-crystallites in the film {{is based on a}} similarity of the observed spectroscopic properties with those of the bulk CsPbX 3 purified by the Bridgman technique. The materials object of this study have been deposited by Physical Vapour Deposition inside an UHV apparatus on DC 7059 optical glass starting from CsBr and PbBr 2 purified powders or by crushing Bridgman crystals. In this paper, we report on an impedance spectroscopy study in a wide frequency range (10 - 5 107 Hz) and temperature (100 - 650 K) aimed to identify the distribution of surface related electronic <b>defects.</b> Moreover, transient <b>photoconductivity</b> measurements in the sub-nanosecond range have then been performed to infer the role of these defects on the charge carriers recombination mechanism and mobility-lifetime product...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the effects of intense light soaking at room {{temperature}} (RT) and at 77 K on the defect density in hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H). It is found that at short light-soaking times, light soaking at RT is more efficient in creating metastable defects than at 77 K. With increasing light-soaking time, however, 77 -K light soaking causes the defect density to increase at a higher rate than does RT light soaking. There are signs that the saturated value of the defect density for 77 -K light soaking is larger than that for RT light soaking. Qualitatively, a correlation exists between the increase in the defect density and the decrease in the photoconductivity; however, an inverse proportionality is not observed between the <b>photoconductivity</b> and <b>defect</b> density. For a given <b>defect</b> density, the <b>photoconductivity</b> is smaller for 77 -K light soaking than for RT light soaking. The defects generated by 77 -K light soaking are found to be stable at 77 K. However, significant annealing of defects occurs after raising the sample temperature to RT. Light-induced annealing of defects is also observed. We explain our results by adopting the views that there is a broad distribution of defect-annealing activation energies and that the defects with small annealing activation energies are more effective recombination centers than those with large annealing activation energies. We show that many other related experimental results can also be accounted for by the above views. © 1994 The American Physical Society...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{hydrogen}} dilution on the optical, transport, and structural properties of amorphous and microcrystalline silicon thin films deposited by hot-wire (HW) {{chemical vapor deposition}} and radio-frequency (rf) plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition using substrate temperatures (T-sub) of 100 and 25 degrees C is reported. Microcrystalline silicon (mu c-Si:H) is obtained using HW with a large crystalline fraction and a crystallite size of similar to 30 nm for hydrogen dilutions above 85 % independently of T-sub. The deposition of mu c-Si:H by rf, with a crystallite size of similar to 8 nm, requires increasing the hydrogen dilution and shows decreasing crystalline fraction as T-sub is decreased. The <b>photoconductivity,</b> <b>defect</b> density, and structure factor of the amorphous silicon films (a-Si:H) are strongly improved {{by the use of}} hydrogen dilution in the T-sub range studied. a-Si:H films with a photoconductivity-to-dark conductivity ratio above 10 (5), a deep defect density below 10 (17) cm(- 3), an Urbach energy below 60 meV and a structure factor below 0. 1 were obtained for rf films down to 25 degrees C (at growth rates similar to 0. 1 - 0. 4 Angstrom/s) and for HW films down to 100 degrees C (at growth rates similar to 10 A/s), using the appropriate hydrogen dilution. In the low T-sub range studied, the growth mechanism, film properties, and the amorphous to microcrystalline silicon transition depend on the flux of atomic hydrogen available. The properties of the films are compared to those of samples produced at 175 and 250 degrees C in the same reactors. Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia (FCT...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} native and {{radiation}} induced <b>defects</b> on the <b>photoconductivity</b> transients and photoluminescence spectra {{have been examined}} in GaN epitaxial layers of 2. 5 and 12 μm thickness grown on bulk n-GaN/sapphire substrates by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). For comparison, free-standing GaN as-grown samples of 500 μm thickness, fabricated by hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE), were investigated. Manifestation of defects induced by 10 -keV X-ray irradiation with the dose of 600 Mrad and 100 -keV neutrons with the fluences of 5 × 1014 and 1016 cm− 2 {{as well as of}} 24 GeV/c protons with fluence 1016 cm− 2 have been revealed through contact photoconductivity and microwave absorption transients. The amplitude of the initial photoconductivity decay is significantly reduced by the native and radiation defects density. Synchronous decrease of the steady-state PL intensity of yellow, blue and ultraviolet bands peaked at 2. 18, 2. 85, and 3. 42 eV, respectively, with density of radiation-induced defects is observed. The decrease of the PL intensity is accompanied by an increase of asymptotic decay lifetime in the photoconductivity transients, which is due to excess-carrier multi-trapping. The decay fits the stretched exponent approximation exp[-(t/τ) α] with the different factors α in as-grown material (α≈ 0. 7) and irradiated samples (α≈ 0. 3).

40|$|The {{influence}} of dangling-bond defects {{and the position}} of the Fermi level on the charge carrier transport properties in undoped and phosphorous doped thin-film silicon with structure compositions all the way from highly crystalline to amorphous is investigated. The dangling-bond density is varied reproducibly over several orders of magnitude by electron bombardment and subsequent annealing. The defects are investigated by electron-spin-resonance and photoconductivity spectroscopies. Comparing intrinsic amorphous and microcrystalline silicon, it is found that the relationship between <b>defect</b> density and <b>photoconductivity</b> is different in both undoped materials, while a similar strong {{influence of}} {{the position of the}} Fermi level on photoconductivity via the charge carrier lifetime is found in the doped materials. The latter allows a quantitative determination {{of the value of the}} transport gap energy in microcrystalline silicon. The photoconductivity in intrinsic microcrystalline silicon is, on one hand, considerably less affected by the bombardment but, on the other hand, does not generally recover with annealing of the defects and is independent from the spin density which itself can be annealed back to the as-deposited level. For amorphous silicon and material prepared close to the crystalline growth regime, the results for nonequilibrium transport fit perfectly to a recombination model based on direct capture into neutral dangling bonds over a wide range of defect densities. For the heterogeneous microcrystalline silicon, this model fails completely. The application of photoconductivity spectroscopy in the constant photocurrent mode (CPM) is explored for the entire structure composition range over a wide variation in defect densities. For amorphous silicon previously reported linear correlation between the spin density and the subgap absorption is confirmed for defect densities below 10 (18) cm(- 3). Beyond this defect level, a sublinear relation is found i. e., not all spin-detected defects are also visible in the CPM spectra. Finally, the evaluation of CPM spectra in defect-rich microcrystalline silicon shows complete absence of any correlation between spin-detected defects and subband gap absorption determined from CPM: a result which casts considerable doubt on the usefulness of this technique for the determination of defect densities in microcrystalline silicon. The result can be related to the inhomogeneous structure of microcrystalline silicon with its consequences on transport and recombination processes...|$|R
