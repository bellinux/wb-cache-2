25|$|On {{the inside}} back cover of the book, detectives {{identified}} indentations from handwriting. These included a telephone number, an unidentified number, and a text that resembled an encrypted message. According to statements by police, the book {{was found in the}} rear <b>footwell</b> of a car, {{at about the same time}} that the body of the unidentified man had been found.|$|E
25|$|The 2007 Acura TL {{features}} a slightly revised exterior {{as well as}} a revised interior with a new steering wheel, redesigned gauges, and <b>footwell</b> lighting, in addition to new interior and exterior colors. The 2007 TL (non Type-S) received suspension changes to improve ride comfort. Also new for the 2007 model year were LED turn signal repeaters on the side mirrors and fog lamps in the bumper. Prior to 2007, the fog lamps were integrated into the headlight housing; Daytime Running Lights now occupy that space (Canadian models have had DRLs there rather than fog lamps since 2004).|$|E
25|$|One issue {{treated as}} {{secondary}} at the inquiry was the {{presence in the}} flight deck observer's seat of Captain Collins. The Lane report recommended greater caution in allowing off-duty flight crew members to occupy flight deck seats, and aired speculation that Collins might have been distracting his colleagues. The report noted that Collins' body {{was found to be}} holding a can of aerosol air freshener in its right hand. Sources close to the events of the time suggest that Collins played an altogether more positive role by attempting to lower the leading-edge devices in the final seconds of the flight; Eric Pritchard, a Trident captain who happened to be the first airman at the accident site, recalled that a fireman had stated that Collins was lying across the centre pedestal and noted himself that his earphones had fallen into the right-hand-side <b>footwell</b> of the flight deck, diagonally across from the observer's seat, as might be expected if he had attempted to intervene as a last resort.|$|E

2500|$|Originally the Land Rover was {{a single}} model offering, which from 1948 until 1951 used an [...] {{wheelbase}} and a 1.6-litre petrol engine producing around [...] The four-speed gearbox from the Rover P3 was used, with a new two-speed transfer box. This incorporated an unusual four-wheel-drive system, with a freewheel unit (as used on several Rover cars of the time). This disengaged the front axle from the manual transmission on the overrun, allowing a form of permanent 4WD. A ring-pull mechanism in the driver's <b>footwell</b> allowed the freewheel to be locked to provide more traditional 4WD. This was a basic vehicle: tops for the doors and a roof (canvas or metal) were optional extras. In 1950, the lights moved from a position behind the grille to protruding through the grille.|$|E
50|$|In {{the field}} of {{automotive}} engineering, <b>footwell</b> intrusion describes {{a situation in which}} an automobile engine or other vehicle component moves into the space normally allocated for the feet of the front seat occupants. Automotive crash testing agencies such as Euro NCAP and IIHS consider levels of <b>footwell</b> intrusion when conducting assessments. Vehicles that display excessive deformation of the <b>footwell</b> are noted.|$|E

50|$|Optional ambient {{lighting}} in the Focus uses LEDs {{placed in the}} front and rear <b>footwells</b> and the cup holders. Standard equipment includes a tire pressure monitoring system as mandated by the TREAD Act.|$|R
50|$|With {{its larger}} {{exterior}} dimensions, the all-new Mini provides more space for its four occupants and luggage, with enhanced shoulder space and larger <b>footwells.</b> Boot volume has been increased {{by more than}} 30% to 211 litres.|$|R
50|$|In addition, the {{ambience}} lighting creates emotionally appealing contrasts and structures the interior into levels. 64 colours, ten colour worlds and three different lighting zones (<b>footwells,</b> trim element level and wide-screen cockpit) enable an avant-garde lighting scene with spectacular colour changes.|$|R
50|$|Midway through 2010, {{features}} including side mirrors with integrated turn signals, <b>footwell</b> lighting, {{and power}} seat memory functions were removed.|$|E
50|$|The sports saloon and the {{drophead}} coupé had {{slightly less}} length between {{the front and}} rear seats, but a longer bonnet, with the front <b>footwell</b> extending further beneath the bonnet.|$|E
50|$|The 182 Cup {{lacked the}} {{automatic}} Xenon headlights and headlight washer jets, climate control (rear <b>footwell</b> heater vents were also removed), illuminated sun visors, Solar Reflective Windscreen and Automatic Wipers.|$|E
5000|$|In 1982, {{shortly after}} the {{introduction}} of the 1500 model, complete production was assumed by Bertone with models subsequently badged as the [...] "Bertone" [...] X1/9. Bertone models featured revised <b>footwells</b> redesigned to enhance legroom and sitting comfort for persons taller than the original design's target.|$|R
5000|$|The car is {{now more}} {{powerful}} and roomier and its anatomically correct squabs and pneumatic cushions hold four comfortably. At the back the floor has no <b>footwells,</b> the wheels arches are wide, [...] [...] [...] [...] "the car tested might well have had ventilators in the scuttle".|$|R
25|$|Midyear 2015, Toyota {{released}} a Persona Series in 2 colors, Blizzard White (extra $220) and Absolutely Red. This {{model is a}} Model 3 with upgrades: black faux leather-like seats, black floor mats and side panels, heated side mirrors with turn indicators, lighted <b>footwells,</b> dark metal finish 5 stock 17-inch wheels with 215/45/17 tires.|$|R
5000|$|Because the shifter {{and parking}} brake cannot be mounted between the seats, the {{transmission}} selector or shifter is {{moved to the}} steering column, and the emergency brake is activated by a pedal in the driver's <b>footwell.</b>|$|E
50|$|The SE model {{featured}} {{cut pile}} carpets, a tachometer, overhead reading lamps, door step lamps, rear <b>footwell</b> lamps, four-speaker AM/FM/MPX stereo radio/cassette system, remote boot and fuel cap releases, adjustable lumbar support and tilt {{for the driver}} seat, and tinted side windows.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{generation}} Isuzu Rodeo and its twin, the Honda Passport received {{a rating of}} [...] "Poor" [...] in the IIHS frontal offset test conducted at 40 mph due to a poor safety cage and dummy movement, and excessive <b>footwell</b> intrusion that contributed to injuries to both legs.|$|E
50|$|The car was {{initially}} supplied as a four-seater fixed head coupé. In 1933 a tourer was launched. For 1934 the chassis was modified {{to give a}} wider track and better front <b>footwells.</b> The gearbox also gained synchromesh. In 1934 a saloon version and in 1935 an Airline coupé and drophead coupé {{were added to the}} range.|$|R
50|$|As before, the {{interior}} lighting uses only long-lasting, energy-saving LED technology. With 64 colours, the optionally extended ambience lighting offers {{a wealth of}} individual settings. It adds lighting highlights, for example, on the trim elements, the central display, the stowage facility {{at the front of}} the centre console, the handle recesses, the door pockets, in the front and rear <b>footwells,</b> on the overhead control panel, and on the tweeters when the vehicle is equipped with the Burmester® High-End 3D Surround Sound System.|$|R
25|$|In New Zealand, {{knock-down}} kits of the Series II were assembled locally by the New Zealand Motor Corporation (NZMC) {{at their}} Nelson plant. In {{the last year}} of production in New Zealand (1978), a special 'SuperJag' (XJ6-SLE) model was produced which featured half leather, half dralon wide pleat seats, vinyl roof, chrome steel wheels and air conditioning as standard. New Zealand produced models featured speedometers in km/h, and the black vinyl mats sewn onto the carpets in the front <b>footwells</b> featured the British Leyland 'L' logo.|$|R
50|$|Cars sold from 1952 also {{featured}} a fuel-based passenger cabin heater. In order to ignite the heater {{it was necessary}} first to open a small tap in the engine bay, after which the flow of hot air could be regulated using a control in the <b>footwell</b> on the passenger's side.|$|E
50|$|Cars were {{supplied}} with the Caterham (Arch Motors) race chassis in 2001 and 2002. This is recognisable by a shorter passenger <b>footwell</b> (to accommodate the battery {{in the engine}} bay) and the handbrake under the dash on the passenger side. Cars from 2003 to 2006 were {{supplied with}} a centre (tunnel) handbrake.|$|E
50|$|For the 2001 Academy, {{cars were}} {{supplied}} {{with the more}} modern Dedion chassis, and a Rover K series engine. An increasing number of cars were supplied with full rollover cages by this point, {{although it was not}} until 2003 that all Academy cars came with a full cage rather than a FIA-spec rollover bar and supporting strut in the passenger <b>footwell.</b>|$|E
50|$|EDITION.PUR is a long-wheelbase {{station wagon}} {{based on the}} G 280 CDI from the 461 model series. It {{includes}} all-terrain tyres in size 265/75 R 16 on aluminium rims, flexible wheel arch flaring, protective grilles for the headlamps and lights, optional a walk-on bonnet, a towing lug at the front, a two-section rear door, four individual seats upholstered in hard-wearing fabric or man-made leather, rubber floor coverings in the passenger compartment, spray-protected controls and drainage apertures in the <b>footwells.</b> Optional features include load compartment with a wood floor, load-securing rings and rails.|$|R
50|$|The cockpit {{includes}} a double bottom (or false floor) which extends through {{almost to the}} bow, with deep, self-bailer equipped <b>footwells</b> {{each side of the}} centreline; a detachable foredeck was developed but has not been a feature of production boats. While the production deck, which extends well forward of the forestay fitting, would lend itself very well to incorporation of a spinnaker chute, none was ever fitted by the manufacturers, spinnaker stowage relying instead on an elasticated pocket or 'turtle' before the mast, under which the spinnaker could readily be stuffed.|$|R
50|$|The {{claims made}} were {{by no means}} excessive. The {{buoyancy}} arrangements are exemplary, allowing the boat to float low on its side when capsized making it easy for the crew to climb onto the centreboard and, in combination with a foam-filled mast, making it rare for the boat to fully invert. Yet the double floor provides for very rapid expulsion of any water in the cockpit after the boat is righted; a combination of virtues that few other designs can match. The deep <b>footwells</b> improve the boat's stability by positioning the crew low during manoeuvres, such as gybing, greatly adding to confidence.|$|R
50|$|The GLK-Class is {{not sold}} in RHD markets, {{such as the}} United Kingdom and Australia, due to a {{driveshaft}} used to operate the front wheels on 4WD versions of the GLK. It is positioned such that it encroaches slightly on the right-hand-side <b>footwell.</b> In August 2014, however, it was announced the GLK-Class will be sold in the United Kingdom from Q4 2015.|$|E
50|$|On {{the inside}} back cover of the book, detectives {{identified}} indentations from handwriting. These included a telephone number, an unidentified number, and a text that resembled an encrypted message. According to statements by police, the book {{was found in the}} rear <b>footwell</b> of a car, {{at about the same time}} that the body of the unidentified man had been found.|$|E
50|$|A 1/5 scale, 10.25 in gauge {{model of}} number 181 {{has been made}} by Andrew Simkins. This model is {{externally}} faithful to Robinson's design but cleverly uses a <b>footwell</b> to conceal most of the driver in the tender. It was showcased and won an award at the Model engineering exhibition in 2003. It has since been seen on several of the 10.25 in gauge railways around Britain.|$|E
25|$|Several new {{options and}} {{standard}} features {{were introduced in}} the following years, including the Pony Package (2005), a DVD-based GPS navigation system made by Pioneer (2006, late availability), a power passenger seat (2006), heated seats (2006), Sirius Satellite Radio (2006), new flat bottom spoiler for V6 only (2006), standard side airbags (2007), HID headlamps (2007), and ambient interior lighting (2007). The ambient interior lighting package consisted of the installation of electroluminescence that gave the driver the ability to choose various color combinations for the instrument cluster, sound system and climate control displays, as well as light emitting {{from the top of}} the front <b>footwells</b> and from beneath the rear seats.|$|R
50|$|In July 2004, the R&ER Preservation Society {{placed an}} order with TMA Engineering of Birmingham {{for a new}} B-B diesel {{hydraulic}} locomotive, {{that was to be}} funded by the Society. It was delivered the following year and named after the recently deceased former General Manager, Douglas Ferreira. It is a diesel-hydraulic locomotive, with a Perkins 4-cylinder turbocharged engine, which is more compact yet even more powerful than that on Lady Wakefield, and is essentially a development of the quarter-century elder loco. The running gear with shaft coupled wheels is similar to the Romney diesels but inset with <b>footwells</b> {{at each end of the}} steel slab frame.|$|R
50|$|Level One (RPO: AJA): Red {{interior}} stitching on gray leather-appointed interior seats, center console, steering wheel, {{shifter boot}} and knob, and armrests on the doors. Switchblade Silver interior trim kit on dash and door panels with accented red light piping in door trim, <b>footwells,</b> and cup holders. Body colored ground effects, Heritage grille, Blade spoiler, and antenna. Red engine cover and red colored Brembo brake calipers. Premium floor mats with red edging and Silver stripe Yenko enspired decals on hood, mailslot, rear deck, and side gills. The MSRP for this option package level wasUS$4,995 additional with purchase of either 2LT or 2SS model both with {{order of a}} RS package.|$|R
