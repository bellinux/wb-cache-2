60|$|Old Miss Newton's attainments {{could not}} have been great, for her answers to my {{inquiries}} were decidedly funny, and prefaced sotto voce with, 'What a child it is!' But she was a good kindly lady, who had the faculty of teaching, and of forestalling rebellion; and her little thin corkscrew curls, touched with gray, her pale eyes, prim black silk apron, and sandalled shoes, rise before me full of happy associations of tender kindness and patience. She was wise, too, in her own simple way. When nurse would have forewarned her of Clarence's failings in his own hearing, she cut the words short by declaring that she should like never to find out which was the naughty one. And when habit was too strong, and he had denied the <b>ink</b> <b>spot</b> on the atlas, she persuasively wiled out a confession not only to her but to mamma, who hailed the avowal as the beginning of better things, and kissed instead of punishing.|$|E

50|$|She {{settled in}} New York City where {{she spent the}} rest of life. Catherine Radziwiłł {{played a major role in}} exposing the antisemitic hoax The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. In 1921, she gave a private lecture in New York in which she claimed that the Protocols were {{compiled}} in 1904-1905 by Russian journalists Matvei Golovinski and Manasevich-Manuilov at the direction of Pyotr Rachkovsky, chief of the Okhrana, the Russian secret service in Paris. Golovinski worked together with Charles Joly (son of Maurice Joly) at Le Figaro in Paris. This account, however, contradicts the basic chronology of the Protocols publication, as they had already been published in 1903 in the Znamya newspaper. Moreover, in 1902, Rachkovsky was dismissed from the Paris Okhrana and returned to Saint Petersburg. Catherine Radziwills statements were cited during the Berne Trial by Russian witnesses in 1934 and by experts in 1935; they gave evidence that her date of 1905, when Matvei Golovinski would have shown her a manuscript of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion ("with a big blue <b>ink</b> <b>spot</b> on the first page") in Paris, is obviously an error of chronology, possibly caused by a typo in her article published in The American Hebrew and reprinted by The New York Times.|$|E

40|$|Peach skin {{discoloration}} (PSD) is {{a disorder}} that {{has also been}} called inking, <b>ink</b> <b>spot,</b> black spot, grease spot, purple streak, purple spot, browning, blackening, or streaking. For simplicity, any type of skin discoloration discussed here will {{be referred to as}} PSD. No microorganism, pathogenic or otherwise, has been isolated from affected fruit or identified as a cause of PSD. The disorder appears to result from a combination of physical, chemical, and physiological factors. PSD symptoms may vary from a barely detectable discoloration that, depending on the cause, can be reversible, to severe blackening that covers most of the fruit. Usually PSD is associated with red areas of the fruit, but there have been reports of browning, sometimes called grease spot, that is restricted to the yellow and orange areas. Most significant peach-producing areas worldwide have at some time reported PSD problems. Early work by Van Blaricom and Webb in South Carolina focused on identification of the cause of PSD. They induced PSD by exposing fruit to abrasion on sponge rubber rollers. Treatment with solutions of sodium carbonate, chlorinated water, hot water, zinc, copper, and iron all induced the development of PSD. However, in almost all cases, abrasion from contact with a variety of roller or brush types was necessary in order for the symptoms to appear. These results were later confirmed by Hopfinger in New Jersey who added ammonia exposure to the list of PSD causes. More recently, Crisosto and co-workers have conducted intensive studies in California to define the physical, chemical, an...|$|E

Each of the 4 males and 1 females in our study (age range: 16 to 57 years; mean age: 34 years) had a single, 4 - 6 mm large, black macule with irregular, fingerlike extensions at the periphery. All lesions were situated on the upper back and surrounded by numerous sun-induced freckles.

Reticulated lentigo presented mostly in individuals with skin type 1, red to blond hair, and blue eyes. The clinical diagnosis in 4 out of 5 cases was melanoma in situ. Histopathologically, reticulated lentigo was mainly characterized by a sharply circumscribed hyperpigmentation of the lower epidermis with accentuation at the tips of elongated and clubbed rete ridges. In addition, a normal or slightly increased melanocyte number in the basal layer and an infiltrate of melanophages in the upper dermis was noted.

This call lasted until December 2009, and raised the goal of 130 contributions from international poets, artists and printers, each producing editions of 15 broadsides for the exhibition tour 2010 - 2011 which raises funds for Médecins Sans Frontières. A complete set of all 130 broadsides is also being donated to the Iraq National Library in Baghdad (www. bookarts. uwe. ac. uk/mut_tour 10. htm). A complete gallery of all 130 broadsides is hosted by the Florida Atlantic University/Jaffe Center for Book Arts site: www. library. fau. edu. /depts/spc/JaffeCenter/jaffemutanabbistreetstartshere. htm Bodman is coordinating the European tour, and Beausoleil, the USA tour. Alongside the tour of printed broadsides, a new call has been launched for An Inventory of Al-Mutanabbi Street, which is inviting 130 international book artists to join the colation and produce an edition of 3 books each for the new exhibition tour. Again a complete set will be donated to the Iraq National Library in Baghdad. Bodman is the co-curator for this new project and will be responsible for artists from Europe, The Middle East, and Asia, with Beausoleil responsible for North and South America, Canada, and The Middle East. The call for An Inventory of Al-Mutanabbi Street runs from 1 st September 2010 - 1 st September 2011, after which a new international tour will star with the artists' books. The broadsides have been exhibited to date at: Marymount Institute for Faith, Culture, and the Arts, Loyola Marymount University, Los Angeles; The San Francisco Zen Center; <b>Ink</b> <b>Spot</b> Press, Brighton; Northern Print, Newcastle upon Tyne; Yavapai College Art Gallery in Prescott, Arizona and is touring to venues in Europe and the USA until December 2011.
