The average elimination half-lives were 13. 5 +/- 0. 8 (n = 17) and 11. 6 +/- 1. 9 min (n = 21) (means +/- S. E. M.), respectively, whereas the systemic whole blood clearance values were 75. 4 +/- 3. 4 (n = 17) and 85. 8 +/- 3. 5 ml/min/kg (n = 21) (means +/- S. E. M.). The values of the latter parameter approach hepatic blood flow in the rat (i. e., 100 ml/min/kg) and therefore the oral availability of <b>hexobarbital</b> was established by comparing areas under plasma concentration time curves, after i. v. and oral administration to the same rat.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which hypoxia or social isolation interact with drug action were investigated {{by the use of}} several parameters including drug-induced narcosis, convulsions, change in body temperature and various biochemical parameters. Acute Hypoxia Hypobaric hypoxia (364 mm Hg, 10 % O 2) enhanced. the depressant effects of barbital, pentobarbital and chloral hydrate in mice and rats. Mice were far more sensitive than rats, barbital narcosis being affected to the greatest extent. Reduced oxygen (10 %) at normal pressure also potentiated pentobarbital narcosis. Hypothermia during hypoxia was greater in mice than in rats. Mice exposed to hypoxia at 30 °C instead of 22 °C ambient temperature did not exhibit hypothermia. Hypoxia at 22 °C enhanced and prolonged the hypothermia induced by barbiturates and chloral hydrate. At 30 °C hypoxia showed considerably less potentiation of barbital narcosis and hypothermia than at 22 °C. These parameters were moderately reduced with chloral hydrate and unaffected with respect to pentobarbital. Convulsions produced by intraperitoneal semicarbasize, m-fluorotyrosine or methionine sulphomimine were significantly reduced in mice exposed to hypoxia. Seizures due to intracerebral semicarbazide were also antagonized by hypoxia. Hypoxic mice showed lower body concentration of pentobarbital on awakening and reduced rate of pentobarbital disappearance from the body than animals breathing room atmosphere. Administration of sodium nitrate to mice markedly potentiated barbiturate narcosis. The hypothermia and methemoglobinemia produced by nitrite showed a temporal relationship to the potentiation of <b>hexobarbital</b> narcosis. Both reduction in body temperature and enhancement of barbital narcosis after sodium nitrite were prevented at 30 °C ambient temperature, but potentiation of <b>hexobarbital</b> narcosis was unaffected. Disappearance of <b>hexobarbital</b> from the whole-body of nitrite-treated mice was slower and barbiturate concentration at awakening was lower in these animals as compared to control mice. Sodium nitrite did not inhibit <b>hexobarbital</b> metabolism in vitro or affect <b>hexobarbital</b> narcosis when injected intracerebrally. Methylene blue effectively reduced nitrite-induced methemoglobinemia, but markedly potentiated barbiturate narcosis in the absence of nitrite. Seizures produced by intracerebral semicarbazide were antagonized by sodium nitrite injection. Brain and plasma levels of intraperitoneal barbital C 14 were reduced after exposure to hypobaric hypoxia or injection of sodium nitrite when the labelled compound was given with a depressant dose (300 mg/kg) of unlabeled barbital. Excretion of barbital C 14, as measured by brain and plasma levels 6 h after intraperitoneal injection, was lower in mice subjected to barbiturate narcosis during hypobaric hypoxia. Exposure to hypoxia or injection of sodium nitrite did not affect penetration of intravenously administered barbital C 14 into brain. These data suggest that hypoxia due to low ambient oxygen or injection of sodium nitrite decreases absorption, metabolism and excretion of barbiturates and lowers the threshold of brain neurons to drug-induced depression. Social Isolation Narcosis due to <b>hexobarbital,</b> pentobarbital, chloral hydrate or barbital was markedly reduced in male mice after 5 weeks of social deprivation. Socially deprived female mice also showed a decreased response to <b>hexobarbital</b> narcosis. However, only isolated males developed aggressiveness. The metabolism of <b>hexobarbital</b> both in vivo and in vitro was enhanced in isolated animals. Mice deprived of social interactions gained righting reflect at a higher body level of <b>hexobarbital</b> as compared to the underpriced animals. Development of aggressiveness in isolated male mice did not correlate temporally with the reduced response to <b>hexobarbital.</b> Gonadectomy, but not adrenalectomy effectively prevented reduction of barbiturate potency and development of aggressiveness in socially deprived male mice. Latency to avoidance of paw shock was significantly lower in socially deprived male mice. In addition, the decrement in avoidance produced by chlorpromazine in grouped mice was less pronounced in the deprived animals. These data show that chronic deprivation of social stimuli in mice increased the drug metabolizing activity of hepatic microsomes and raised arousal levels such that CNS susceptibility to drugs and physical stimuli was altered. In addition, the anabolic steroids appear to be involved in this response. These observations further suggest that alterations in barbituated sensitivity and development of aggressiveness after social deprivation may have a different biological basis...|$|E

Cl*int,HB and Cl*int,AM were both increased by phenobarbital and polychlorinated biphenyl pretreatment. Pretreatment with 3 -methylcholanthrene had hardly any effect, and carbon tetrachloride caused a strong diminution of Cl*int. HB and Cl*int. AM.

Experiments with 9000 x G supernatants indicated that the metabolism of <b>hexobarbital</b> was significantly increased following exposure to methylchloroform. Significantly increased N-demethylation of aminopyrine, accompanied by increased amounts of microsomal CO-binding pigment (cytochrome P- 450) and microsomal NADPII-cytochrome c reductate were observed in vitro experiments using hepatic microsomal fractions from rats exposed to methylchloroform. The spectral properties of the CO-binding pigment in animals exposed to methylchloroform did not differ from controls Pretreatment with actinomycin D or cycloheximide prevented the decrease in the <b>hexobarbital</b> sleeping time in rats exposed to methylchloroform. Further studies demonstrated that pretreatment with cycloheximide prevented the increase in metabolism of aminopyrine by rats exposed to methylchloroform. These observations suggest that the increased drug-metabolizing activity in the exposed rats is due to an accelerated synthesis of the hepatic drug-metabolizing system. The inducing effects of methylchloroform appear to be related to those produced by phenobarbital...|$|E
40|$|Summary: A solubilized hepatic microsomal enzyme system {{previously}} {{shown to}} catalyze the w-hydroxylation of fatty acids also catalyzes the hydroxylation of drugs. Benzphetamine, aminopyrine, ethylmorphine, <b>hexobarbital,</b> norcodeine, and p-nitroanisole undergo aerobic demethylation {{in the presence}} of NADPH and the resolved enzyme system. The required submicrosomal components for benzphetamine demethylation, as determined either by formaldehyde liberation or by NADPH oxidation, are cytochrome P- 450, NADPH-cytochrome P- 450 reductase, and a heat-stable lipid fraction. Similar re-quirements were shown for the oxidation of aminopyrine, ethylmorphine, and <b>hexobarbital.</b> Laurate and benzphetamine were found to be mutually inhibitory, as would be expected if a common "methyl hydroxylase " were involved. The solubilized cytochrome P- 450 preparation exhibits a difference spectrum {{in the presence of}} benzphetamine with a peak at 392 ml and a trough at 427 rnp and difference spectra with aniline and <b>hexobarbital</b> typical of those obtained with the microsomal bound. form of this hemoprotein. Cytochrome P- 450, the carbon monoxide-binding pigment of microsomes (l), serves as a mixed function oxidase effect-ing the hydroxylation of steroids and the oxidative demethyla-tion and hydroxylation of drugs in animal tissues (2 - 4). Attempts to solubilize this pigment by a variety of tech-niques resulted in the extensive formation of P- 420 (l), an altered form possessing no catalytic activity. Recent studies in our laboratory on the w-hydroxylation of fatty acids in liver microsomes led to "solubilization " of the enzyme system by the criterion that enzymatic activity remained i...|$|E
40|$|Rom, ROBERT A., JR. AND ROBERT J. RUBIN: Comparison of {{the effect}} of carbon {{monoxide}} and of hypoxic hypoxia. I. In vivo metabolism, distribution and action of <b>hexobarbital.</b> J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 199 : 53 - 60, 1976. Previous experiments had shown that carbon monoxide inhalation prolonged the in vivo response zoxazolamine. However, CO was clearly less potent than an equivalent level of hypoxia induced by inhalation of lowered 02 content (hypoxic hypoxia). The present study revealed that both CO and hypoxic hypoxia also prolonged the pharmacologic response to a drug of vastly different structure and site of action, i. e., <b>hexobarbital.</b> In this case, CO was approximately equipotent to hypoxic hypoxia in prolonging sleeping time. In spite of a number of significant effects of the two types of hypoxia on factors such as rate of peritoneal absorption, distribution into the brain and brain sensitivity to the drug, their relative potencies in prolonging sleeping time appeared to reflect adequately their relative effects on in vivo rate of metabolism. This conclusion was based on their equipotencies in decreasing the rate of disappearance o...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of aging on the metabolism of antipyrine (AP) and <b>hexobarbital</b> enantiomers (R-HB and S-HB) {{with and without}} phenobarbital (PB) induction was investigated in a longitudinal study in rats aged 6, 12, 24 and 30 months. The metabolic clearances of AP (Cl(m AP)), R-HB (Cl(m R-HB)) and S-HB (Cl(m S-HB)) were used as indicators for P 450 enzyme activities in vivo. This also included {{the assessment of the}} clearances of formation of three AP metabolites, 3 -hydroxymethylantipyrine (Cl(→HMA)), 4 -hydroxyantipyrine (Cl(→OHA)) and norantipyrine (Cl(→NORA)). Aging appeared to have little influence on the pharmacokinetics of the model compounds. By contrast, the {{influence of}} PB pretreatment on Cl(m AP) changed dramatically with aging. The extent of induction decreased from 4. 5 -fold at 6 months to 1. 7 -fold at 30 months. Aging influenced the clearances of formation of the three metabolites differentially. Cl(m S-HB) was about six times higher than Cl(m R-HB) without induction. After PB induction, S-HB did not reach detectable levels in plasma at 6, 12 and 24 months. At 30 months, PB pretreatment resulted in a significantly decreased Cl(m S-HB) when compared with the uninduced state. The extent of induction of R-HB metabolism had decreased strongly at 24 and 30 months. The present results clearly indicate that in the aged rat, the P 450 enzyme system is much less sensitive to PB induction.

40|$|A single oral dose (430 mg/kg) of atrazine, {{a widely}} {{employed}} s-triazine herbicide, {{was administered to}} young male rats. There was a significant increase of the in vivo elimination of <b>hexobarbital</b> and a significant induction of the activity of 7 -pentoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase, while cytochrome P- 450 content and other mixed function oxidase activities remained unaltered. The administration of carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) to atrazine pretreated rats did not substantially augment the impairment of drug metabolizing enzymes brought about by CCl 4 alone.
