40|$|Abstract. <b>Stencil</b> <b>based</b> {{computation}} on structured grids is {{a common}} kernel to broad scientific applications. The order of stencils increases with the required precision, {{and it is a}} challenge to optimize such high-order stencils on multicore architectures. Here, we propose a multilevel parallelization framework that combines: (1) inter-node parallelism by spatial decomposition; (2) intra-chip parallelism through multithreading; and (3) data-level parallelism via singleinstruction multiple-data (SIMD) techniques. The framework is applied to a 6 th order <b>stencil</b> <b>based</b> seismic wave propagation code on a suite of multicore architectures. Strong-scaling scalability tests exhibit superlinear speedup due to increasing cache capacity on Intel Harpertown and AMD Barcelona based clusters, whereas weak-scaling parallel efficiency is 0. 92 on 65, 536 BlueGene/P processors. Multithreading+SIMD optimizations achieve 7. 85 -fold speedup on a dual quad-core Intel Clovertown, and the data-level parallel efficiency is found to depend on the stencil order...|$|R

40|$|Visual sensor {{networks}} (VSNs) perform complex {{scene analysis}} algorithms that require significant computations and communications. Under this respect, {{the use of}} skeletons contributes to reduce the complexity of VSN programming and may ensure an easier and better optimization of the code. In this context, we propose INS, a <b>stencil</b> <b>based</b> skeleton targeted for wireless/visual sensor networks (W/VSNs) and give a preliminary analysis of its benefits using tracking as a case study. INS abstracts a distributed approximation schema in which the estimation of a givenmetric is organized in a sequence of steps. Each step includes collecting estimates from some neighbor nodes and local computation of a newapproximation. In particular, INS takes inspiration from some <b>stencil</b> <b>based</b> skeletons proposed for parallel computation and merges it with the classical event driven model typical of sensor programming. As a result, the execution of each step is triggered by the detection of a relevant event in the environment. Tracking consists in periodically predicting position and velocity {{of one or more}} mobile targets. We discuss howINS can be instantiated to a distributed version of Kalman filtering. As energy efficiency is central in W/VSNs, we derive analytic models for energy dissipation of the INS skeleton depending on different concepts of neighborhood for the data exchanged at each step. Then, these models are used to guide the deployment of our tracking application on a real scenari...|$|R

Coating color liquid phase seemed to penetrate mainly into the voids between the fibers, because of the short contact time in the film transfer nip. SEM-BSE and LIPS coverage measuring methods were found to give similar results for the precoated surfaces. The LIPS coverage results were lower than the SEM-BSE results at low coatweights. This indicated that the SEM-BSE method found thinner coating layers to be covered. Low <b>base</b> <b>paper</b> surface openness and high filler content {{on the surface of the}} sheet reduced coating color penetration into the <b>base</b> <b>paper</b> structure and the coating color stayed on the surface better. Dense <b>base</b> <b>papers</b> with high filler contents gave better small-scale uniformity than porous <b>base</b> <b>papers.</b> The coating coverage was sensitive to <b>base</b> <b>paper</b> shadow marking, which was clearly seen as large-scale coverage non-uniformity. With <b>base</b> <b>papers</b> with less filler on the surface, coverage could still be increased by increasing coating color viscosity. Using higher levels of kaolin in the coating formula improved coverage, especially at low coatweights. The machine speed and nip load did not affect coating coverage. The color solids content had only a minor impact on coating coverage. Smaller differences in coverage two-sidedness were observed when both paper sides were coated simultaneously compared to the situation where only one side was coated. When the paper was coated using hard rolls, coating coverage depended largely on the pore size of the <b>base</b> <b>paper.</b> Coatweight was formed mainly through penetration, the result being a dense coating layer. With soft rolls coating layer formation occurred more by dewatering, in which case better coverage was obtained, albeit accompanied by a porous coating layer. The porous coating layer with good coverage was the result of filter cake formation in the film transfer nip. The main mechanism by which coating layer formation took place was pressure-induced penetration of bulk coating color or liquid phase into the voids between fibers in the transfer nip. Water sorption into the fibers was slower than capillary penetration, and the movement of coating color liquid phase by diffusion and possibly by capillary absorption took place mainly after the nip. reviewe...|$|R
