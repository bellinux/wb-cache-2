Blacky is a sly old rascal. Usually he is as noisy as any one I know, but he came and went without making a sound. Now I think of it, I haven't once heard his voice near here this spring. I guess if Farmer Brown's boy could find this nest he would get even with Blacky for pulling up his corn. I know a lot of clever people, but no one quite so clever as Blacky the Crow.

5000|$|The bagel head {{procedure}} {{was brought to}} Japan in 2007 by Keroppy Maeda, who revived it in 2014 after he first saw it done in Canada by pioneer Jerome Abramovitch.

The procedure involves the subject taking a 300-400 cc medical-grade saline injection to the mid-forehead {{over a period of}} two hours, which is then often given a depression in the center, leading to the [...] "bagel head" [...] name.

5000|$|Critics like James Gill, {{who writes}} for the New Orleans Times Picayune dismiss this clause.

5000|$|Allen M.

6000|$|... "You mean am I talking quite straight?" [...] and a suggestive dryness {{crept into}} Jimmy's tone. [...] "I {{can only say}} that the man, who did not know I was coming here, assured me of <b>it</b> <b>just</b> before I <b>went</b> <b>to</b> sea. It would, of course, be easy for you to wait and find out whether you could believe me.

2500|$|Throughout his career, Mahal has {{performed}} his brand of blues (an African American artform) for {{a predominantly white}} audience. This has been a disappointment at times for Mahal, who recognizes {{there is a general}} lack of interest in blues music among many African Americans today. He has drawn a parallel comparison between the blues and rap music in that they both were initially black forms of music that have come to be assimilated into the mainstream of society. He is quoted as saying, [...] "Eighty-one percent of the kids listening to rap were not black kids. Once there was a tremendous amount of money involved in it... they totally moved it over to a material side. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> off <b>to</b> a terrible direction." [...] Mahal also believes that some people may think the blues are about wallowing in negativity and despair, a position he disagrees with. According to him, [...] "You can listen to my music from front to back, and you don't ever hear me moaning and crying about how bad you done treated me. I think that style of blues and that type of tone was something that happened as a result of many white people feeling very, very guilty about what went down." ...|$|R
