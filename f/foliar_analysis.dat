40|$|Published online: 06 Oct. 2010 The potato {{genotype}} ND 4382 - 19 has Solanum chacoense Bitt. in its genetic background. <b>Foliar</b> alkaloid <b>analysis</b> {{of it and}} its progeny ND 5873 (ND 4382 - 19 × Chipeta) by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) showed that, {{in addition}} to the expected alkaloids (solanidine, leptinidine, and acetyl-leptinidine), there was an aglycone of another rare alkaloid. Its molecular mass and some of the m/z fragment ions were similar to leptinidine, but the major fragment ion was the m/z 150 peak of solanidine. This fragmentation pattern suggested that this alkaloid is a solanidine-based compound with mass equal to leptinidine. Leptinidine differs from solanidine by an extra –OH group, but the GC–MS fragmentation pattern of the rare compound indicated hydroxylation at a different position than the C- 23 of leptinidine. The exact chemical structure is still unknown, and further analysis, such as NMR will be necessary to determine the structure. Segregation analysis of ND 5873 (ND 4382 - 19 × Chipeta) showed that presence of this rare compound segregated in a 1 : 1 ratio, indicating that a single gene controlled its synthesis and/or accumulation in <b>foliar</b> tissue. <b>Analysis</b> with AFLP and microsatellite markers indicated that the locus-controlling presence of this alkaloid resided on potato chromosome I, with the nearest flanking AFLP markers 0. 6 and 9. 4 cM apart.

The objective was to evaluate methods of digital image processing to develop the AVS to diagnose induced nitrogen deficiency in maize leaves. The experiment was done in greenhouse and the treatments were N doses (0. 0; 3. 0; 6. 0 e 15. 0 mMol L- 1) combined with three growing stages (V 4, V 7 and R 1). The images of maize leaves were digitized in 1200 dpi. After scanning, leaves were chemically analyzed for N content and was determined the dry mass of plants. The studied methods in AVS were: Volumetric Fractal Dimension (VFD), Gabor Wavelet (GW) and VFD with canonical analysis. The omission and reduction of nitrogen in maize plants resulted in typical symptoms of N deficiency.

40|$|SUMMARY Raspberries {{are highly}} {{adaptable}} to different growing conditions and soils, but ideal conditions are well fertilized soils with a pH of 5. 5 - 6. Since raspberries are perennials with the fruit developing on last year´s laterals, {{this has to}} be considered when managing and fertilizing the plants. The size of the raspberry crop is mainly decided {{during the first year of}} growing when the fruit buds are developed, but can be effected by the environment and pruning during year two. Primocanes and floricanes are competing for light, which can be controlled by different methods of pruning. The plants need for the nutrients vary during the growing season as does the uptake ability, but most of the uptake takes places during spring with a peak in June/July. The vegetative primocanes and the generative floricanes have different nutrition needs. For the vegetative growth primarily nitrogen is needed, but for the fruit development potassium is most important. The plants distribute the nutrients to different parts based on the current need. When applied at budbreak, most of the nitrogen is distributed to fruit, fruitbuds and primocanes. When applied two months after budbreak, most of the nitrogen is used for primocane growth. The vegetative growth continues throughout the whole growing season until October. A general, long term fertilizing schedule could be designed as follows: Nitrogen 60 - 100 kg/ha, from spring to harvest; Phosphorus 20 - 40 kg/ha, spring; Potassium 80 - 120 kg/ha, spring, June, September; Magnesium 12 - 15 kg/ha, before, during and after flowering, after harvest Micronutrients should be applied as a foliar spray to avoid binding of the nutrients to the soil, and should be based on <b>foliar</b> nutrient <b>analysis...</b>|$|R

The most sensitive morpho-anatomical traits in P. maritimum, which express leaf phenotypic plasticity, are leaf outline and venation, leaf thickness, stomata distribution and size.

The highest seed yield, oil yield, oil percentage, 1000 seed weight, seed weight to capitulum weight ratio and protein percentage were obtained from the soil and foliar application of iron + zinc treatments (F 8). Also, the highest amounts of nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium concentration in leaves were achieved from control treatment which was an indication of non-efficiency of iron and zinc on the absorption rate of these substances in the leaves.

40|$|Understanding the {{processes}} underlying {{the transition from}} introduction to naturalization and spread is an important goal of invasion ecology. Release from pests and pathogens in association with capacity for rapid growth is thought to confer an advantage for species in novel regions. We assessed leaf herbivory and leaf-level traits associated with growth strategy in the native and exotic ranges of 13 invasive plant species from 256 populations. Species were native to either the Western Cape region of South Africa, south-western Australia or south-eastern Australia and had been introduced {{to at least one}} of the other regions or to New Zealand. We tested for evidence of herbivore release and shifts in leaf traits between native and exotic ranges of the 13 species. Across all species, leaf herbivory, specific leaf area and leaf area were significantly different between native and exotic ranges while there were no significant differences across the 13 species found for leaf mass, assimilation rate, dark respiration or <b>foliar</b> nitrogen. <b>Analysis</b> at the species- and region-level showed that eight out of 13 species had reduced leaf herbivory in at least one exotic region compared to its native range. Six out of 13 species had significantly larger specific leaf area (SLA) in at least one exotic range region and five of those six species experienced reduced leaf herbivory. Increases in SLA were underpinned by increases in leaf area rather than reductions in leaf mass. No species showed differences in the direction of trait shifts from the native range between different exotic regions. This suggests that the driver of selection on these traits in the exotic range is consistent across regions and hence is most likely to be associated with factors linked with introduction to a novel environment, such as release from leaf herbivory, rather than with particular environmental conditions. Synthesis. These results provide evidence that introduction of a plant species into a novel environment commonly results in a reduction in the top-down constraint imposed by herbivores on growth, allowing plants to shift towards a faster growth strategy which may result in an increase in population size and spread and consequently to invasive success. 11 page(s...|$|R

The <b>foliar</b> chemical <b>analysis</b> was utilized to determine the plant response to the fertilizer application. Data showed a significant effect of local conditions on the yield and composition of plant material. Ammonium sulphate and superphosphate increased yield in both locations whereas potassium chloride was a factor only in Mococa. Phosphate application was the main factor to explain yield in any condition. In Mococa the nitrogen dosage, the contents of N, S, P, Mn, Cu, Zn in the leaf + 4 and yield were positively correlated with protein and negatively associated with starch percentage of the seed. All the above cited nutrients increased with ammonium sulphate application. Both phosphate fertilizer and P in leaves correlated positively with seed oil content. Potassium fertilizer and K in leaves were positively correlated with percent oil and negatively associated with linoleic acid. Total oil content and linoleic acid showed negative correlation. There was a tendency for potassium fertilizer decrease starch in the grain. This was evidenced by negative correlation between K and CI in the leaves and kernel starch. Both locations showed significant correlation between same leaf and grain elements. Sulphur and N, Mo-Fe were positive whereas Pe-P and Al-P showed negative values. The amino acids glycine, lysine, and tryptophan in the protein fraction of the seed were negatively associated with crude protein content in Mococa, while {{there was an increase}} of proline followed by reduction of phenylalanine and arginine in Campinas. Yield and P in the leaf correlated positively with oil content in both places. Both oil content and fatty acid composition were affected by location. High oil content seeds revealed higher levels of oleic, palmitic, stearic, and lower linoleic acid content...|$|R
