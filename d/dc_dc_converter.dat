40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a standalone wind {{energy conversion system}} with battery and ultra capacitor for continuous power supply. Due to intermittent nature of wind energy and load fluctuations, the power flow will be unstable. Battery is the commonly used energy storage device to stabilize the power flow. Since the power density of battery is low, charging and discharging rate is much less. Due to quick charging and discharging, stress on battery increases thereby reducing battery life. Ultra capacitors have high power density and hence it can react to quick load fluctuations. The hybrid battery- ultra capacitor energy storage system will have high energy and power density. This will increase battery life. Bidirectional <b>DC</b> <b>DC</b> <b>converter</b> is used to interface battery and ultra capacitor to dc link.

40|$|The work aims at {{designing}} {{and implementation of}} a bidirectional <b>DC</b> <b>DC</b> <b>converter</b> fed PMDC motor {{which can be used}} as the traction system for hybrid electric vehicle(HEV) system. As in designing the HEV the main problem is of battery storage system and by using the bidirectional converter we can improve the overall efficiency of the HEV. In bidirectional converter as energy flow can take place in either direction, it can work in both the motoring and regenerative mode. In motoring mode, the converter acts as a boost converter and the voltage will be boosted and hence the current will be less so the I 2 R loss will be less and system will be more efficient but when we talk about regenerative mode the system will act as a buck converter and the battery will be charged in the regenerative mode. So the overall efficiency of the system will increase. ZVRT technique is used to reduce the switching losses...|$|E

40|$|A Buck Boost {{converter}} circuit {{has been designed}} and simulated to drive a dc motor for an electric vehicle. The design consists of an IGBT Buck-Boost converter, the battery pack in the Buck side and a capacitor in the Boost side. The main battery has the motor load connected to it. The design helps in improving {{the efficiency of the}} DC motor by using the bidirectional buck boost converter along with the battery pack and capacitor. It provides energy to the motor during acceleration and also facilitates the energy regeneration during braking or deceleration. The incorporation of the regenerative braking can improve the efficiency as much as 25 % and therefore improve the driving range. During boost operation the converter transfers the energy from the capacitor to the battery(battery gets charged) while during regeneration converter works in buck mode and transfers energy from battery to capacitor(capacitor is charged). There are a number of options for <b>DC</b> <b>DC</b> <b>converter</b> such as Boost,Buck converter, Isolated/Non isolated Half bridge Buck Boost converter,Full Bridge converter and,Cuk Converter. The isolated converters are preferred as they don’t include transformers and hence increase the overall efficiency of the system along with reduction of size and weight of the system. A controller was designed to generate a controlled PWM signal input to the igbt switches. The battery voltage is measured and an error signal is generated with respect to a reference voltage. This error is given as input to a PI controller and the controller generates a PWM switching pattern by using a comparator. The controller thus controls the amount of energy transferred to the capacitor. In present work the controller is designed and simulated for both the operating modes-Buck mode and Boost mode...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to determine if it is possible {{to reduce the number of}} organic solar cells required to power a load using a <b>DC</b> to <b>DC</b> <b>converter</b> thereby reducing the cost of the organic solar array system. An organic solar power system designer may choose an organic implementation of a <b>DC</b> to <b>DC</b> <b>converter</b> to go along with the organic solar cell array. Common <b>DC</b> to <b>DC</b> <b>converters</b> include the buck converter, boost converter, buck/boost converter, and Cuk converter, all of which are not good candidates for organic implementation due to their use of inductors. Organic inductors are relatively more lossy than organic capacitors. So, an inductor-less <b>DC</b> to <b>DC</b> <b>converter,</b> such as the Dickson charge pump, would be a better candidate for organic implementation. Solar cells connected in an array configuration usually do not perform up to their full potential due to current and voltage mismatches between solar cells. These mismatches can be related to each solar cell's circuit model parameters such as the photon current density, diode ideality factor, diode reverse saturation current density, parallel resistance, and series resistance. This research varies these circuit model parameters as dependent variables, and observes the loads and power levels that make the Dickson charge pump a feasible option. The results show that current mismatch does produce an opportunity to use a <b>DC</b> to <b>DC</b> <b>converter</b> to save the use of a few solar cells. However, the Dickson charge pump was found to be infeasible due to an input voltage requirement that could not be met using the tested organic solar cells. M. S.
