40|$|Abstract. The {{technology}} of Laminated Object Manufacturing (LOM) {{is not very}} new. For hundreds of years wooden parts are built by stacking layers together. Nowadays also paper, plastic, ceramic composite and metal sheets are treated in layers. For the manufacture of prototypes and especially technical tools, e. g. moulds for <b>gravity</b> casting, <b>die</b> casting or injection molding, out of metallic foil however the low self stiffness of this material is a great challenge. In this case {{it is useful to}} produce the parts in a two step process. The first sub-process is the stacking of the layers, which can be realised by laser beam spot welding to determine the position of the layer in combination with generating the defined contour by a laser beam cutting process. This procedure is done in a fully automated machine where the CAD-file of the desired part and the building parameters like the laser parameters and the cutting velocity are needed as input. However the stability of the produced green part is insufficient for most kind of application. Hence, a second sub-process to enhance the mechanical properties of the part is necessary. This can for example be realised by high temperature soldering or by diffusion welding in a furnace with inert gas or vacuum. During these kinds of joining processes the green part is homogeneously pressed {{with the help of a}} powder bed and at the same time it is tempered for a defined term...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The name “high {{strength}} brass ” {{is given}} to the wrought and cast alloys indicating their particular virtue of high strength, which can be achieved by additions of Al, Fe, Mn and Sn. Forgings made from copper base alloys offer a number of advantages over products made by other processes. However, because for forging more heat must be applied to the ingot which was solidified once, there are some disadvantages in the economy of energy and time. In this study, we investigated the microstructures and mechanical properties of high strength brass made by semi solid forging and compared them with those of conventionally forged product and <b>gravity</b> <b>die</b> casting. No shrinkage or gas hole was found in semi solid forgings. Fine equiaxed crystals developed at the center of semi solid forgings, while grains in the corner of semi solid forgings were elongated perpendicular to the pressure direction. The grains of semi solid forgings were smaller than those of conventional forgings and <b>gravity</b> <b>die</b> castings. It is suggested that a rapid heat transfer condition due to applied pressure is responsible for grain refinement.

40|$|Aluminum alloys with silicon {{as a major}} {{alloying}} element, consist a {{class of}} alloys, which provides the most significant part of all shaped castings manufactured. This is mainly due to the outstanding effect of silicon in the improvement of casting characteristics, combined with other physical properties such as mechanical properties and corrosion resistance. In general, an optimum range of silicon content can be assigned to casting processes. For slow cooling rate processes (sand, plaster, investment) the range is 5 to 7 wt%, for permanent molds 7 to 9 % and for die castings 8 to 12 %. Since most castings parts are produced considering no dominant heat flow direction during solidification, {{it seems to be}} adequate to examine both upward and downward growth directions in order to better understand foundry systems. The way the heat flows across the metal/mold interface strongly affects the evaluation of solidification, and plays a remarkable role in the structural integrity of castings. <b>Gravity</b> or pressure <b>die</b> casting, continuous casting and squeeze casting are some of the processes where product quality is more directly affected by the interfacial heat transfer conditions.

40|$|Defects such as pores, hot tears, entrained oxides or {{macrosegregation}} {{can occur}} in aluminium die castings and will impair the mechanical properties. The nature, extent and distribution of such defects will, however, differ between die casting processes. To investigate these differences, a comparative study between gravity castings of an A 356 alloy and high pressure die castings of an A 380 alloy has been carried out. The defect distributions of the castings were investigated by metallography, radiography and fractography, and the tensile properties were measured. The <b>gravity</b> <b>die</b> castings were produced in a step mould with and without filter and at different controlled hydrogen concentrations in the melt. The U-shaped pressure die castings were produced with systematic variations of process parameters such as plunger speed, commutation point between first and second phase and pouring temperature. It {{has been found that}} both castings contain defects, primarily pores and oxides, and that the presence and distribution of these defects are highly sensitive to the process conditions. Significant variations of the defect distribution have, however, also been found in castings produced under the same conditions, particularly in the pressure die castings indicating the stochastic nature of defects in die castings. The dominating defect type in the <b>gravity</b> <b>die</b> casting is hydrogen porosity mainly at high hydrogen melt concentrations, whereas in the high pressure die castings, oxides and entrapped air porosity dominate. The tensile properties in both types of castings are affected by the amount and distribution of defects. This effect is particularly prominent for the pressure die castings where the defect area fraction has been found to determine the tensile strength. In the gravity castings, hydrogen porosity decreases the tensile strength, but this effect becomes significant only at quite high hydrogen melt concentrations. The tensile properties as well as the porosity also depended on the cross section of the castings...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Casting is {{a process}} where {{components}} are produced by pouring molten metal into moulds or dies which is then allowed to solidify. A variety of casting techniques are used in industry, but this thesis focuses on aluminium casting using a type of permanent mould casting called <b>Gravity</b> <b>Die</b> Casting (GDC). Casting {{is a process}} which is largely dictated by thermal conditions. Thermal conditions dictate solidification rate, which partly determines the microstructure and affects the mechanical properties of a component. Casting parameters such as melt temperature, initial die temperature, and die coating can also affect how heat is removed from a casting. The rate of heat removal is expressed as heat flux (q) (MWm- 2). The rate of heat removal from a casting and through a die is known as interfacial heat flux, and is calculated at the metal/mould boundary. Heat transfer at the metal/mould boundary can also be described by the interfacial Heat Transfer Coefficient (HTC) (Wm- 2 K- 1). In general if the HTC is large then solidification will be rapid. The HTC {{is a very important}} parameter in casting simulation programs, which are often used to optimise casting processes and die design. For most simulation programs the HTC is required, however, the HTC generally has to be estimated for the particular casting condition being simulated. Current state-of-the-art modelling packages, such as Magmasoft, have the ability to use variable HTCs in computations, but this information is rarely available. The variable HTC plots presented in this thesis provide a valuable database for more accurate modelling the solidification of <b>gravity</b> <b>die</b> cast aluminium-silicon alloys. Aluminum <b>gravity</b> <b>die</b> castings were produced using an experimental <b>gravity</b> <b>die</b> casting rig installed with a Heat Transfer Coefficient gauge. Al- 7 Si- 0. 3 Mg aluminium alloy was used for all castings and two different die coatings were used. A ceramic die coating primarily consisting of titanium dioxide particles in a water suspension, and a graphite die coating were applied to the die using a spray gun with adjustable spray pressure. Two sets of castings were produced with the die set at variable thicknesses of 15 mm, 20 mm and 25 mm, one with the die coated in the ceramic coating and the other with the graphite coating. Castings were produced with the ceramic coating applied at different spray pressures of 2 bar, 4 bar and 6 bar. Heat flux and HTCs were calculated and plotted against time for all castings. The castings of various thicknesses had maximum HTCs in the range of 1. 4 to 1. 5 kWm- 2 K- 1 for castings from the graphite coated die, and 1. 3 to 1. 4 kWm- 2 K- 1 for castings from the ceramic coated die. Heat transfer data for castings from the die coated with ceramic coating applied at spray pressures of 2 bar, 4 bar and 6 bar were also plotted and analysed. It was found that the castings from the die coated at 4 bar had the highest HTC of 1. 3 kWm- 2 K- 1, with the 2 bar and 6 bar castings only reaching maximum HTCs of approximately 1. 0 kWm- 2 K- 1 and 1. 1 kWm- 2 K- 1, respectively. Microstructures from castings were also analysed with dendrite cell sizes and eutectic volume fraction measurements taken. This information was then compared to the HTC data and solidification times in order to establish links between heat transfer, maximum HTC and the resultant microstructures. Significant variations in the HTC are likely to occur as results of normal processes in commercial foundries. This thesis provides an idea of how much the absolute value of the HTC varies with changes in some typical parameters. From this knowledge a robust casting process can be designed to tolerate these typical changes in the HTC...|$|E
