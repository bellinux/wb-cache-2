25|$|By contrast, {{according}} to one of Cronin's biographers, Alan Davies, the book's reception was mixed. A few of the more vociferous medical practitioners of the day took exception to one of its many messages: that a few well-heeled doctors in fashionable practices were ripping off their equally well-off patients. Some pointed to the lack of balance between criticism and praise for hard-working doctors. The majority accepted <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> it was, a topical novel. The press attempted to incite passions within the profession in an attempt to sell copy, while Victor Gollancz followed suit in an attempt to promote the book, all overlooking {{the fact that it was}} a work of fiction, not a scientific piece of research, and not autobiographical.|$|E

500|$|The {{reaction}} was not uniformly positive. On seeing the film, François Truffaut {{is reported to}} have said, [...] "I don't want to see a movie of peasants eating with their hands." [...] Bosley Crowther, the most influential critic of The New York Times, wrote in 1958, [...] "Any picture as loose in structure or as listless in tempo as this one is would barely pass as a 'rough cut' with the editors in Hollywood", even though he praised its gradually emerging poignancy and poetic quality. The Harvard Crimson argued in 1959 that its fragmentary nature [...] "contributes to the film's great weakness: its general diffuseness, its inability to command sustained attention. For Pather Panchali, remarkable as it may be, is something of a chore to sit through." [...] Early in the 1980s, Ray was criticised by Nargis Dutt, parliamentarian and former actress, for [...] "exporting poverty". Darius Cooper writes that while many critics celebrated the Apu trilogy [...] "as a eulogy of third-world culture, others criticized <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> they took to be its romanticization of such a culture".|$|E

500|$|However, {{there were}} some criticisms. Jha's only {{objection}} to the film was Nikumbh's [...] "sanctimonious lecture" [...] to Ishaan's [...] "rather theatrically-played" [...] father. Jha found this a jarring [...] "deviation from the delectable delicacy" [...] of the film's tone. Although she applauded the film overall and recommended [...] "a mandatory viewing for all schools and all parents", Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India believed the second half was [...] "a bit repetitive," [...] the script needed [...] "taut editing," [...] and Ishaan's trauma [...] " [...] a shade too prolonged and the treatment simplistic." [...] Despite commending the [...] "great performances" [...] and excellent directing, Gautaman Bhaskaran of The Hollywood Reporter, too, suggested that the movie [...] "suffers from a weak script." [...] Likewise, Derek Kelly of Variety criticised <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> he described as its [...] "touchy-feely-ness" [...] attention to [...] "a special needs kid's plight." [...] Kelly also disliked the film for being [...] "so resolutely caring... and devoid of real drama and interesting characters" [...] that [...] "it should have 'approved by the Dyslexia Assn.' stamped on the posters." ...|$|E
500|$|About the {{re-recording}} {{of the old}} songs, Westfall said [...] "We've made a lot {{of changes}} to these songs that we play live [...] and now we're getting a chance to record it, so the people that don't get to see us live can hear it and appreciate <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> it is." [...] On the new tracks, producer Andrew Wade said [...] "I think this new stuff that we're recording is really gonna blow a lot of kids away. [...] just sound amazing, they all sound like completely different songs, and the new song is serious." [...] About the new song, [...] "Why Walk on Water When We've Got Boats", the band wanted to do a fast-paced song. McKinnon admitted the band [...] "kinda just winged it. But we had some little ideas from being on tour and messing around." [...] Woodard said about inspiration for the tempo of the song: [...] "We've all been listening to a lot of faster stuff like Comeback Kid and stuff like that and I don't know and just sitting here one day 'let's write a fast song'." [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] had appeared on the band's Myspace account, on September 21, 2007, as free for download.

500|$|... "Valley Girls" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{comments from}} reviewers. TV Guides Jennifer Sankowski enjoyed the episode and believed the producers had captured {{all aspects of}} popular 1980s teen culture well, but that [...] "at times it {{felt like they were}} trying too hard, throwing everything and anything '80s at us" [...] such as a montage of 1980s outfits worn by Lily and mentions of MTV videos, fanny packs, Rubik's Cube, and Jane Fonda workout videos. [...] "At this rate," [...] said Sankowski, [...] "they won't have anything left to showcase." [...] Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly [...] "loved" [...] the episode and complimented the casting choices, but agrees with Sankowski in that [...] "if this ends up being an actual series, they need to dial down the '80s references a tad." [...] Kona Gallagher of Cinema Blend said the premise was interesting and that [...] " [...] {{has the potential to be}} a strong spinoff, and [...] hope that CW decides to pick it up this fall." [...] Dave Itzkoff of The New York Times writes that he [...] "especially liked the moxie of Brittany Snow as young Lily and Krysten Ritter [...] as her sister, Carol. And of course the retro soundtrack was a total trip." [...] A few review sites took issue with the episode's script, such as BuddyTV, which claimed it was cliché, and Television Without Pity, which found it repetitive. While writing for The Frisky, Sara Benincasa praised the clothing styles and called the overall episode [...] "awesome fun! [...] weirdly sentimental, and sweet". She also believed that the confrontation between the Valley dwellers and the rich attendees of Keith's party was [...] "clearly a giant, dance-friendly metaphor for Reaganomics and the woes of a trickle-down world." [...] Michelle Graham for Film School Rejects liked both the 1980s and present day scenes separately, but when put together, [...] "the overall effect was disjointed and showed <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> it was: an attempt to shove two shows together in order to save money on a proper pilot." ...|$|E

It has no doubt helped make this album what it is, but it's a prison of the mind." [...] Adding, “Sometimes all I see is darkness; it's overpowering.

[...] "The way I looked at acting, it was interesting and it was certainly better than going hungry. But I didn't have a serious approach to it until … I bumped into Orson Welles. He was putting on a Federal Theatre production of Macbeth with Negro players and, somehow, I won the part of Banquo. He rehearsed us for six solid months, but when the play finally went on before an audience, it was right—and {{it was a wonderful}} sensation, knowing it was right.

2500|$|Nevertheless, Sibelius also eyed Madetoja's {{maturation}} somewhat wearily. For example, {{when some}} {{reviews of the}} First Symphony discerned within Madetoja's music the influence of Sibelius, he worried his former pupil might take offence at the comparison and mistook Madetoja's characteristic [...] "melancholia" [...] for [...] "sulkiness". Suddenly, Sibelius found Madetoja arrogant and watched with concern as he drew closer to Kajanus, with whom Sibelius had an on-again-off-again friendship/rivalry. [...] "Met Madetoja, who—I'm sorry to say—has become pretty bumptious after his latest success," [...] Sibelius fretted to his diary. [...] "Kajanus smothers him with flattery and he hasn't the breeding to see <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> it is." [...] A second complication for the Madetoja-Sibelius relationship was the master's fear that his former pupil eventually might [...] "supplant him in public esteem".

2500|$|Billy Corgan {{has said}} that he was {{inspired}} to write a story based 'the Fool's Journey' from the Tarot. [...] Corgan has explained his interpretation of this view: [...] "There's childlike innocence when you just don't really know anything in the world and it all seems sort of big and magical...the teen, aware but not really liking what's going on...the third person that's cynical, where you get kind of bitter because you feel so small and there's all these things that are sort of happening and there's not much you can do about it...the fourth stage out of that would be finding a sort of spiritual place within yourself where you can live in reality, you can see <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> it is, but maybe you can find a deeper source of inspiration and peace." [...] In other words, the album finds Corgan [...] "looking past, present and future {{all at the same time}} and trying to have that perspective".|$|E
2500|$|Webb {{also stated}} that Deschanel's {{character}}, Summer, {{is based on a}} stock character type; [...] "Yes, Summer is an immature view of a woman. She's Tom's view of a woman. He doesn't see her complexity and the consequence for him is heartbreak. In Tom's eyes, Summer is perfection, but perfection has no depth. Summer's not a girl, she's a phase." [...] Gordon-Levitt explained that he was drawn to the role of Tom because of his relatability to the character. [...] "I've had my heart broken before. Truly, truly broken. But when I look back at me in my heartbroken phase, it's pretty hilarious, because it felt so much more extreme than it really was. One of the things I love about 500 Days of Summer is that it doesn't make light of what we go through in romances, but it is honest about it and shows <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> it is, which is often profoundly funny".|$|E
2500|$|In 1933, California defined lynching, {{punishable}} by 2–4 years in prison, as [...] "the taking {{by means of}} a riot of any person from the lawful custody of any peace officer", with the crime of [...] "riot" [...] defined as two or more people using violence or the threat of violence. It does not actually refer to actual lynching and has been used to charge individuals who have tried to free someone in police custody. There have been several notable cases in the twenty-first century, some controversial, when a black person has attempted to free another black person from custody. [...] In 2015, Governor Jerry Brown signed legislation by Senator Holly Mitchell removing the word [...] "lynching" [...] from the state's criminal code without comment after it received unanimous approval in a vote by state lawmakers. Mitchell stated, [...] "It's been said that strong words should be reserved for strong concepts, and 'lynching' has such a painful history for African Americans that the law should only use <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> it is - murder by mob."

2500|$|Krishna-samhita {{published}} in 1879 was Bhaktivinoda's first major work. [...] Composed in Sanskrit and Bengali, {{the book was}} intended as a response to severe criticism of Krishna by Christian missionaries, Brahmo Samaj, and Westernised bhadralok for what they saw as his immoral, licentious behavior incompatible with his divine status in Hinduism. The critics drew upon the perceived moral lapses in Krishna's character to further their propaganda against Hinduism and Vaishnavism, challenging their very ethical foundation. [...] In defense of the tenets of Vaishnavism, Bhaktivinoda's Krishna-samhita employed the same rational tools of its opponents, complete with contemporary archeological and historical data and theological thought, to establish Krishna's pastimes as transcendent (aprakrita) manifestations of morality. In particular, he applied what he termed adhunika-vada ("contemporary thinking") – his methodology of correlating the phenomenal discourse of the scripture with the observable reality. The book evoked an intense and polarised response, with some praising its intellectual novelty and traditionalism while others condemned <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> they saw as deviations from the orthodox Vaishnava hermeneutics.

McAuliffe told reporters on September 10, [...] "I {{can tell you that}} nobody at the Democratic National Committee or groups associated with us were involved in any way with these documents," [...] he said. [...] "I'm just saying that I would ask Karl Rove the same question." [...] McAuliffe later pointed out that Rove and another Republican operative, Ralph E. Reed, Jr., had [...] "a known history of dirty tricks," [...] and he asked whether Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie would rule out any involvement by GOP consultant Roger Stone. At a community forum in Utica, New York in 2005, U.S. Representative Maurice Hinchey (D-NY) pointed out that the controversy served Rove's objectives: [...] "Once they did that, then it undermined everything else about Bush's draft dodging. ... That had the effect of taking the whole issue away." [...] After being criticized, Hinchey responded, [...] "I didn't allege I had any facts. I said this is what I believe and take <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> it's worth." ...|$|E
