40|$|Sliding {{lip seals}} {{are used in}} {{pneumatic}} cylinders to prevent leakage past the piston and rod. Though they guarantee excellent sealing, the friction forces at contact between lip and counterpart can be relatively high. This results in energy losses and problems with wear on components in relative motion, as well as difficulties in controlling actuator positioning. Standards for compressed air cleanliness restrict the use of <b>greases</b> <b>and</b> <b>lubricants,</b> especially in applications such as the food processing and pharmaceutical industries. A number of studies are thus under way {{in order to find}} effective alternatives to the use of common lubricants. These studies address both seal configuration [1 - 4], and the use of innovative materials [5 - 7]. Other approaches employ systems permitting small amounts of air leakage that operate as lubricated supports, variable-profile pistons [8], or rings with special micromachined surfaces [9 - 10]. Such solutions are not always economical, both because they require precision tolerances and geometries, and because they use special seals, often produced ad hoc. This paper discusses the possibility of using commercial lip seals with a non-conventional mounting on the piston in order to obtain a simple controlled-leakage system that reduces friction forces in pneumatic cylinders economically and effectively. The non-conventional mounting consists of positioning the lip seal in the direction opposite to that used in a conventional installation, so that the contact pressure reduces as air pressure in the chamber rises. In this way, an air gap is created at the sliding interface which allows air in the pressurized chamber to escape past the seal lip, thus reducing the contact force on the barrel. The piston is provided with a hole which exhausts the leakage flow to the atmosphere. To evaluate the validity of this approach, a number of preliminary tests were carried out in [11] to measure flow rate on a type of spring-loaded lip seal consisting of graphite-filled PTFE for barrel diameters of 50 mm. In particular, the tests determined air leakage behavior for different mounting tolerances. This paper presents further tests conducted on the same samples examined in [11] and on another PTFE and graphite-filled PTFE configuration, measuring leakage flow rates and friction forces. Leakage flow rate measurements were carried out with single and double seal installations. The results obtained are discussed together with the advantages of the proposed solution compared to the conventional mountings in ordinary us...|$|E

40|$|The {{requirements}} for {{bearings and seals}} {{to operate in the}} environment of space dictate a new area for lubrication research. The low ambient pressures encountered in space can be expected to influence the behavior of oil, <b>grease,</b> <b>and</b> solid-film <b>lubricants.</b> The property of these materials most significantly affected by low ambient pressures is the evaporation rate. Various investigators have therefore measured the evaporation rates of oils <b>and</b> <b>greases</b> in vacuum as one method of establishing their relative merit for space applications (1 - 3). The results of this work have given some indication as to the oils <b>and</b> <b>greases</b> with the greatest stability at reduced ambient pressures. Only limited experimental work, however, has been reported in the literature for inorganic solids and soft metals which have potential use as solid lubricant films or coatings for hard alloy substrates [e. g. Reference (4) ]. In general, the evaporation rates of these materials would be lower than those of oils <b>and</b> <b>greases.</b> These films might therefore be very attractive as lubricants for high vacuum service...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} spatial {{environmental}} {{factors such as}} the very low ambient pressure and the absencc of oxygen on lubrication are discussed. The low pressure causes liquids, and even solids, to boil away, so that their vapour pressure and evaporation rates become important. Evaporation experiments with mctals, liquids, <b>greases</b> <b>and</b> solid <b>lubricants</b> are discussed. Silicone oils <b>and</b> silicone-based <b>greases</b> appear to have the lowest evaporative loss among the fluids investigated. Bearing experiments indicate that liquids <b>and</b> <b>greases,</b> when properly shielded, can provide longer bearing lives than bonded solid lubricants or metal platings. Silicone fluids yield the best bearing life, confirming the results of evaporation tests. Life results with bonded solid films are generally poor. Kesults are considerably better when the solid lubricant is used as a constituent in a solid-composite material. Bearing reliability in space applications may be a problem because considerable life scatter is observed where a particular lubricant or lubrication techniqueis evaluated in multiple tests.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{highlights}} the future perspectives of sustainable tribology {{by examining the}} economic, environmental and social impact of three tribological case studies. One case study examines the sustainability and durability of micro-CHP systems looking the tribological phenomena generated within a scroll expander system. The scroll is {{the main part of}} a specific micro-CHP system and experiences wear and cavitation damage. The tribological optimization of the scroll expander improves the sustainability of the micro-CHP unit while it has a serious economic and environmental impact to the consumers and to the society in general. Another case study is focused on friction and wear performance of lifeboat launch slipways. The causes of high friction and wear during the RNLI's lifeboat launches along an inclined slipway are investigated with a view to reducing the environmental impact due to slipway panel wear <b>and</b> <b>lubricant</b> release into the marine environment. The project encompasses the sustainable design of slipway panels using design modifications based on tribological investigations to double their lifespan, while environmental and economic impact was significantly reduced by the use of biodegradable <b>greases</b> <b>and</b> water as <b>lubricants.</b> The final case study involves an investigation of recycled plastic materials to replace polyurethane used on skateboard wheels, scooters and similar applications. Polyurethane (PU) is difficult to recycle. With the dwindling resources and environmental problems facing the world today, recycling for both waste reduction and resource preservation has become an increasingly important aspect of sustainability. The tribological results showed that recycled polycarbonate plastic can effectively act as a substitute to polyurethane wheels. Moreover, sustainability considerations showing the environmental benefits of the use of recycled plastics over PU include reducing the CO 2 footprint by 50 % and the energy consumed by 60 %, among other benefits. These case studies emphasise the importance of sustainable tribology in our epoch showing that increased sustainability performance can be achieved through tribology to a significant extent in many cases, providing stability to our world and more viable long term growth to our societies...|$|R
40|$|A new {{facility}} {{has been developed}} to test the tribological behavior (friction and wear) of PS 300 solid lubricant bushings at high temperatures. PS 300 is a commercially available solid lubricant invented at the NASA Glenn Research Center. It can be prepared as a plasma spray coating or as a free-standing powder metallurgy component, designated PM 300. PS 300 and PM 300 composites are designed to lubricate sliding components at temperatures above the capability of today's best oils, <b>greases,</b> <b>and</b> solid <b>lubricants.</b> One of the primary applications being pursued for PM 300 {{is the development of}} bushings for use in high-temperature machinery. Examples include inlet guide vane bushings for gas turbines and conveyors, and bearings for industrial furnaces and ovens. Encouraging preliminary field trials indicate that PS 300 <b>and</b> PM 300 <b>lubricant</b> materials have been commercialized successfully in several industrial applications. However, the lack of laboratory performance data has hindered further commercialization especially for new applications that differ significantly from the established experience base. The purpose of the newly developed bushing test rig will be to determine the performance characteristics of PM 300, and other materials, under conditions closely matching intended applications. The data will be used to determine engineering friction and wear rates and to estimate the life expectancy of bushings for new applications. In the new rig, the bushing is loaded against a rotating shaft inside a furnace enclosure (see the preceding photograph). Loads can vary from 5 to 200 N, speeds from 1 to 400 rpm, and temperatures from 25 to 800 C. Furnace temperature, bushing temperature, shaft speed, and torque are monitored during the test, and wear of both the bushing and the shaft is measured after testing is completed. Initially, PM 300 bushings will be evaluated and compared with lower temperature, traditional bushing materials like graphite and porous bronze. The baseline PM 304 composition is 60 wt% NiCr (a binder), 20 wt% Cr 2 O 3 (a hardener), 10 wt% BaF 2 /CaF 2 (a high-temperature <b>lubricant),</b> <b>and</b> 10 wt% Ag (a low-temperature lubricant). Future research efforts will include determining the effects of load, sliding speed, and temperature on tribological performance and, possibly, tailoring composition for specific applications. We expect that the availability of measured performance data will enhance the market penetration of PM 300 technology...|$|R

5000|$|Nitrile rubber (NBR, HNBR, HSN): {{a common}} {{material}} for o-rings {{because of its}} good mechanical properties, its resistance to <b>lubricants</b> <b>and</b> <b>greases,</b> <b>and</b> its relatively low cost. The physical and chemical resistance properties of NBR materials {{are determined by the}} acrylonitrile (ACN) content of the base polymer: low content ensures good flexibility at low temperatures, but offers limited resistance to oils and fuels. As the ACN content increases, the low temperature flexibility reduces and the resistance to oils and fuels improves. Physical and chemical resistance properties of NBR materials are also affected by the cure system of the polymer. Peroxide-cured materials have improved physical properties, chemical resistance and thermal properties, as compared to sulfur-donor-cured materials. Standard grades of NBR are typically resistant to mineral oil-based <b>lubricants</b> <b>and</b> <b>greases,</b> many grades of hydraulic fluids, aliphatic hydrocarbons, silicone oils <b>and</b> <b>greases</b> <b>and</b> water to about 80 °C. NBR is generally not resistant to aromatic and chlorinated hydrocarbons, fuels with a high aromatic content, polar solvents, glycol-based brake fluids and non-flammable hydraulic fluids (HFD). NBR also has low resistance to ozone, weathering and aging. HNBR has considerable improvement of the resistance to heat, ozone and aging, and gives it good mechanical properties.|$|R
