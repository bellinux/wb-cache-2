5|$|Batesian mimicry, where a <b>harmless</b> mimic poses as harmful.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} infect devices, Fusob masquerades as a pornographic video player. Thus, victims, {{thinking}} it is <b>harmless,</b> unwittingly download Fusob.|$|E
5|$|Batesian mimicry {{is a form}} of mimicry where a <b>harmless</b> {{species has}} evolved to imitate the warning signals of a harmful species {{directed}} at a predator of them both. It is named after the English naturalist Henry Walter Bates, after his work on butterflies in the rainforests of Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Batesian mimicry, {{where an}} edible species resembles a distasteful or {{dangerous}} species. This is {{most common in}} insects such as butterflies. A familiar example is the resemblance of <b>harmless</b> hoverflies (which have no sting) to bees.|$|E
5|$|<b>Harmless</b> to humans, {{the tiger}} {{catshark}} is caught incidentally by bottom trawlers, recreational anglers, and rarely squid fishers. Though edible, {{it is not}} a valued catch and is usually discarded. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks sufficient data to assess its conservation status.|$|E
5|$|If a {{defendant}} is convicted, the usual remedy for {{a violation of}} one of these provisions is reversal of the conviction or modification of the defendant's sentence. With the exception of structural errors (such as the total denial of counsel), constitutional errors are subject to <b>harmless</b> error analysis, although they must be <b>harmless</b> beyond a reasonable doubt. With the exception of a Double Jeopardy or Speedy Trial violation, the government will usually be permitted to retry the defendant. Pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), these provisions are the source of nearly all reviewable errors in federal habeas review of state convictions.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} insects are toxic or distasteful {{when they have}} fed on certain plants that contain {{chemicals}} of particular classes, but not when they have fed on plants that lack those chemicals. For instance, some species of the subfamily Danainae feed on various species of the Asclepiadoideae in the family Apocynaceae, which render them poisonous and emetic to most predators. Such insects frequently are aposematically coloured and patterned. When feeding on innocuous plants however, they are <b>harmless</b> and nutritious, but a bird that once has sampled a toxic specimen is unlikely to eat <b>harmless</b> specimens that have the same aposematic coloration. When regarded as mimicry of toxic {{members of the same}} species, this too may be seen as automimicry.|$|E
5|$|Mimicry {{may involve}} {{numerous}} species; many <b>harmless</b> {{species such as}} hoverflies are Batesian mimics of strongly defended species such as wasps, while many such well-defended species form Mullerian mimicry rings, all resembling each other. Mimicry between prey species and their predators often involves three or more species.|$|E
5|$|No {{contraindications}} {{are known}} for this examination. Ultrasonography does not involve the use of ionizing radiation, and the procedure is <b>harmless</b> and can be safely used on anybody of any age. A World Health Organization report published in 1998 supports this.|$|E
5|$|The Director – H.A.R.M.'s {{chief and}} the most mysterious {{character}} of the game. He is mentioned several times by antagonists and intelligence items and appears in several missions as a <b>harmless</b> drunkard. His true identity is revealed at the very end.|$|E
5|$|The {{bacterium}} Paenibacillus popilliae {{which causes}} milky spore disease {{has been found}} useful in the control of Japanese beetle, killing the larvae. It is very specific to its host species and is <b>harmless</b> to vertebrates and other invertebrates.|$|E
5|$|While sharks {{had been}} seen as <b>harmless,</b> the {{pendulum}} of public opinion quickly swung to the other extreme, and sharks quickly came to be viewed not only as eating machines, but also as fearless, ruthless killers.|$|E
5|$|A Drax Industries Moonraker {{space shuttle}} on loan is hijacked and Bond is ordered to investigate. Bond meets {{the owner of}} the company, Hugo Drax and one of Drax's scientists, Dr. Holly Goodhead. Bond follows the trail to Venice, where he {{establishes}} that Drax is manufacturing a nerve gas deadly to humans, but <b>harmless</b> to animals. Bond again meets Goodhead and finds out that she is a CIA agent.|$|E
5|$|A {{dust devil}} is a strong, well-formed, and {{relatively}} long-lived whirlwind, ranging from small (half a metre wide {{and a few}} metres tall) to large (more than 10 metres wide and more than 1000 metres tall). The primary vertical motion is upward. Dust devils are usually <b>harmless,</b> but can on rare occasions grow large enough to {{pose a threat to}} both people and property.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the announcement, it was stated that the {{original}} goal was to transmit the six-part adaptation of the third novel starting in February 2004, with the remaining eight episodes comprising the final two novels. A fourth and fifth series based on So Long, and Thanks For All the Fish and Mostly <b>Harmless</b> were to have been transmitted in September 2004.|$|E
5|$|Cheating, where {{either a}} cleaner {{sometimes}} harms its client, or a predatory species mimics a cleaner, also occurs. Predatory cheating {{is analogous to}} Batesian mimicry, as where a <b>harmless</b> hoverfly mimics a stinging wasp, though with the tables turned. Some genuine cleaner fish, such as gobies and wrasse, have the same colours and patterns, in an example of convergent evolution. Mutual resemblance among cleaner fish is analogous to Mullerian mimicry, as where stinging bees and wasps mimic each other.|$|E
5|$|Decompression may be {{continuous}} or staged, {{where the}} ascent {{is interrupted by}} stops at regular depth intervals, but the entire ascent {{is part of the}} decompression, and ascent rate can be critical to <b>harmless</b> elimination of inert gas. What is commonly known as no-decompression diving, or more accurately no-stop decompression, relies on limiting ascent rate for avoidance of excessive bubble formation.|$|E
5|$|Grit {{is often}} mixed with hydrous sodium {{ferrocyanide}} as an anticaking agent which, while <b>harmless</b> {{in its natural}} form, can undergo photodissociation in strong sunlight to produce the extremely toxic chemical hydrogen cyanide. Although sunlight is generally not intense enough to cause this in polar and temperate regions, salt deposits must kept {{as far as possible}} from waterways to avert the possibility of cyanide-tainted runoff water entering fisheries or farms.|$|E
5|$|<b>Harmless</b> {{to humans}} and of no {{economic}} value, the slender smooth-hound is occasionally caught incidentally in bottom trawls and on bottom longlines. Much of its northern range lies in little-fished waters, {{and thus the}} International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Least Concern. However, this shark's very low fecundity would render it susceptible to population depletion should fishing pressure increase in the future.|$|E
5|$|<b>Harmless</b> to humans, the Australian weasel shark is {{commonly}} caught by prawn and fish trawlers operating off northern Australia. Smaller numbers are also captured in gillnets and on longlines. As this species has {{a relatively high}} reproductive rate and losses to fisheries are not severe enough to affect its population, it has been assessed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|<b>Harmless</b> to humans, the blotchy swellshark adapts {{readily to}} captivity and has {{reproduced}} in public aquariums. This species is caught incidentally by Japanese and Taiwanese bottom trawlers {{and brought to}} market. Intensive commercial fishing within its range do not yet appear to have impacted its numbers, but until more data are available the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Data Deficient.|$|E
5|$|<b>Harmless</b> watersnakes of {{the genus}} Nerodia are often mistaken for it. These are also semiaquatic, thick-bodied snakes with large heads that can be {{aggressive}} when provoked, but they behave differently. For example, watersnakes usually flee quickly into the water, while A. piscivorus often stands its ground with its threat display. In addition, watersnakes do not vibrate their tails when excited. A. piscivorus usually holds its head at an angle around 45° when swimming or crawling.|$|E
5|$|Henry Walter Bates's 1863 book The Naturalist on the River Amazons {{describes}} his extensive {{studies of the}} insects in the Amazon basin, and especially the butterflies. He discovered that apparently similar butterflies often belonged to different families, with a <b>harmless</b> species mimicking a poisonous or bitter-tasting species to reduce its chance of being attacked by a predator, in the process now called after him, Batesian mimicry.|$|E
5|$|Molecular oxygen is {{an ideal}} {{terminal}} electron acceptor {{because it is a}} strong oxidizing agent. The reduction of oxygen does involve potentially harmful intermediates. Although the transfer of four electrons and four protons reduces oxygen to water, which is <b>harmless,</b> transfer of one or two electrons produces superoxide or peroxide anions, which are dangerously reactive.|$|E
5|$|Most viral {{vaccines}} {{are based}} on live attenuated viruses, while many bacterial vaccines {{are based on}} acellular components of micro-organisms, including <b>harmless</b> toxin components. Since many antigens derived from acellular vaccines do not strongly induce the adaptive response, most bacterial vaccines are provided with additional adjuvants that activate the antigen-presenting cells of the innate immune system and maximize immunogenicity.|$|E
5|$|Niobium has {{no known}} {{biological}} role. While niobium dust is an eye and skin irritant {{and a potential}} fire hazard, elemental niobium {{on a larger scale}} is physiologically inert (and thus hypoallergenic) and <b>harmless.</b> It is frequently used in jewelry and has been tested for use in some medical implants.|$|E
5|$|One day, {{billions of}} small black cubes appear across the globe. The Doctor arrives and he, Amy, and Rory {{are taken to}} UNIT headquarters, where Commander Kate Stewart {{explains}} {{that they have not}} been able to analyze the cubes' function. The Doctor waits with Amy and Rory for several days to monitor the situation, and gets to know Rory's father, Brian. The Doctor deems the cubes <b>harmless</b> and departs, though instructs Brian to keep watch.|$|E
5|$|Operation Grand Slam {{begins with}} Pussy Galore's Flying Circus {{spraying}} the gas over Fort Knox. However, Bond had seduced Galore and convinced her {{to replace the}} nerve gas with a <b>harmless</b> substance and alert the US government about Goldfinger's plan. The military personnel of Fort Knox play dead until they are certain that they can prevent the criminals from escaping.|$|E
5|$|Restrictions {{were imposed}} on the {{advertisement}} of tobacco products, enacted on 7 December 1941 and signed by Heinrich Hunke, the President of the Advertising Council. Advertisements trying to depict smoking as <b>harmless</b> or {{as an expression of}} masculinity were banned. Ridiculing anti-tobacco activists was also outlawed, as was the use of advertising posters along rail tracks, in rural regions, stadiums and racing tracks. Advertising by loudspeakers and mail was also prohibited.|$|E
5|$|Solutions at {{more than}} 25% acetic acid are handled in a fume hood because of the pungent, {{corrosive}} vapour. Dilute acetic acid, {{in the form of}} vinegar, is practically <b>harmless.</b> However, ingestion of stronger solutions is dangerous to human and animal life. It can cause severe damage to the digestive system, and a potentially lethal change in the acidity of the blood.|$|E
5|$|Some {{heavy metals}} are either {{essential}} nutrients (typically iron, cobalt, and zinc), or relatively <b>harmless</b> (such as ruthenium, silver, and indium), {{but can be}} toxic in larger amounts or certain forms. Other heavy metals, such as cadmium, mercury, and lead, are highly poisonous. Potential sources of heavy metal poisoning include mining, tailings, industrial wastes, agricultural runoff, occupational exposure, paints and treated timber.|$|E
5|$|Some years later, Peg Boggs, a local Avon {{door-to-door}} saleswoman, {{visits the}} decrepit Gothic mansion where Edward lives. She finds Edward alone and offers {{to take him}} to her home after discovering he is virtually <b>harmless.</b> Peg introduces Edward to her family: her husband Bill, their young son Kevin, and their teenage daughter Kim. Despite their initial fear of Edward, they come to see him as a kind person.|$|E
5|$|The quagga {{catshark}} is <b>harmless</b> {{and is not}} {{utilized by}} humans. It is caught incidentally by demersal fisheries in bottom trawls and potentially other gear; such fishing activity is very intense in Indian and Somalian waters, though specific data on this species is lacking. Therefore, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it as Data Deficient.|$|E
5|$|Viruses {{are by far}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} biological entities on Earth and they outnumber all the others put together. They infect all types of cellular life including animals, plants, bacteria and fungi. However, different types of viruses can infect only a limited range of hosts and many are species-specific. Some, such as smallpox virus for example, can infect only one species – in this case humans, and are said to have a narrow host range. Other viruses, such as rabies virus, can infect different species of mammals and are said to have a broad range. The viruses that infect plants are <b>harmless</b> to animals, and most viruses that infect other animals are <b>harmless</b> to humans. The host range of some bacteriophages is limited to a single strain of bacteria and they can be used to trace the source of outbreaks of infections by a method called phage typing.|$|E
5|$|With their {{powerful}} stings and conspicuous warning coloration, social wasps are {{the models}} for {{many species of}} mimic. Two common cases are Batesian mimicry, where the mimic is <b>harmless</b> and is essentially bluffing, and Müllerian mimicry, where the mimic is also distasteful, and the mimicry can be considered mutual. Batesian mimics of wasps include many species of hoverfly and the wasp beetle. Many species of wasp are involved in Müllerian mimicry, as are many species of bee.|$|E
5|$|A {{teaspoon}} of seawater contains about 50 million viruses. Most {{of these are}} bacteriophages, which are <b>harmless</b> to plants and animals, and are in fact essential to the regulation of marine and freshwater ecosystems; however, they are also important mortality agents of phytoplankton, {{the base of the}} foodchain in aquatic environments. They infect and destroy bacteria in aquatic microbial communities, and {{are one of the most}} important mechanisms of recycling carbon and nutrient cycling in marine environments. The organic molecules released from the dead bacterial cells stimulate fresh bacterial and algal growth, in a process known as the viral shunt. Viral activity may also affect the biological pump, the process whereby carbon is sequestered in the deep ocean.|$|E
