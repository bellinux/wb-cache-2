Despite {{there are a number of}} commercialized <b>dopaminergic</b> <b>agonists</b> that are currently being used successfully in the first stages of the disease, they often fail to provide sustained clinical benefit for a long period due to the appearance of side-effects such as augmentation, sleepiness, nausea, hypothension, and compulsive behaviors among others.

Setting: Centro de Estudos em Psicobiologia e Exercicio. Universidade Federal de São Paulo, Brazil. Methods: A total of 13 volunteers (mean age: 31. 6 +/- 8. 3 years) received L-DOPA (200 mg) and benserazide (50 mg) 1 h before sleeping time for 30 days and were then submitted to a physical exercise program on a manual bicycle ergometer for 45 days (3 times a week). Results: Both L-DOPA administration (35. 11 - 19. 87 PLM/h, P< 0. 03) and physical exercise (35. 11 - 18. 53 PLM/h, P< 0. 012) significantly reduced PLM; however, no significant difference was observed between the two types of treatment. Conclusions: the two types of treatment were found to be effective in the reduction of PLM; however, physical exercise is indicated as the first treatment approach, while dopaminergic agonists or other drugs should only be recommended for patients who do not respond to this type of treatment.
