5|$|A <b>hatch</b> or {{hatchway}} is {{the opening}} {{at the top of}} a cargo hold. The mechanical devices which allow hatches to be opened and closed are called <b>hatch</b> cover. In general, <b>hatch</b> covers are between 45% and 60% of the ship's breadth, or beam, and 57% to 67% of the length of the holds. To efficiently load and unload cargo, hatches must be large, but large hatches present structural problems. Hull stress is concentrated around the edges of the hatches, and these areas must be reinforced. Often, <b>hatch</b> areas are reinforced by locally increasing the scantlings or by adding structural members called stiffeners. Both of these options have the undesired effect of adding weight to the ship.|$|E

40|$|Accelerated <b>hatching</b> {{is one of}} few defences {{available}} to embryos, and is effective against many egg-stage risks. We present the first analysis of genetic variation in <b>hatching</b> plasticity, examining premature <b>hatching</b> of American toad embryos in response to pathogenic water moulds. We reared eggs from half- and full-sib families in the presence and absence of water mould. <b>Hatching</b> age and hatchling size showed low cross-environment genetic correlations, suggesting that early-induced <b>hatching</b> can evolve largely independently of spontaneous <b>hatching.</b> We found less phenotypic and additive genetic variation for early-induced <b>hatching</b> than spontaneous <b>hatching,</b> and a stronger correlation between egg and induced hatchling sizes. Directional selection by the pathogen may have eroded variation in early-induced <b>hatching,</b> pushing it against the constraint of <b>hatching</b> gland development. Later <b>hatching</b> has a second, muscular component. This pattern of variation may characterize defences based on developmental transitions, although other inducible defences show more variation in induced phenotypes. © 2008 The Authors.

40|$|International audienceSize, {{caloric value}} and {{chemical}} composition were measured separately in the progeny of two northern pike (Esox lucius) females at 3 -day intervals during the endogenous feeding period from <b>hatching</b> to final yolk resorption. Tissue, yolk and entire larvae were analysed separately in {{three groups of}} larvae that <b>hatched</b> at different times (between 88 and 106 degree-days post-fertilization). An integrated approach with the Gompertz model was used to compute the yolk conversion efficiency and time to maximum tissue size in early, mid and late <b>hatched</b> larvae. At <b>hatching,</b> unresorbed yolk of early <b>hatched</b> larvae contained more energy (39. 20 J) and more protein (0. 99 mg) compared to the yolk of larvae that <b>hatched</b> later (38. 13 J and 0. 92 mg protein for late <b>hatched</b> larvae, p < 0. 05). In contrast, {{a significant reduction in}} tissue weight (- 0. 7 mg DW) and protein content (- 0. 5 mg) was found in early <b>hatched</b> larvae compared to those which <b>hatched</b> later (p < 0. 05). Between days 9 and 12 post-hatching (108 and 144 degree-days post-hatching), close to the final yolk resorption, late <b>hatched</b> larvae stopped growing and their tissue began to be resorbed. This tissue resorption time was delayed in early <b>hatched</b> larvae which presented {{at the end of the}} experiment a greater tissue weight than late <b>hatched</b> ones. Yolk conversion efficiency in term of energy from <b>hatching</b> to complete yolk resorption stage was significantly higher for early and mid <b>hatched</b> larvae (51 %) compared to late <b>hatched</b> ones (44 %) (p = 0. 004). Furthermore, the time to maximum tissue size was found to be negatively related to <b>hatching</b> time which implies that early <b>hatched</b> larvae take longer time to switch from one developmental stage to the next. The maximum tissue dry weight and energy content were found to be reached at approximately the same age post-fertilization for both early <b>hatched</b> and late <b>hatched</b> larvae, suggesting that the principal steps in a fish's lifespan are better correlated with time of fertilization than <b>hatching</b> time...|$|R

40|$|<b>Hatching</b> {{care has}} been {{reported}} for many taxonomic groups, from invertebrates to vertebrates. The sophisticated care that occurs around <b>hatching</b> time {{is expected to have}} an adaptive function supporting the feeble young. However, details of the characteristics of the adaptive function of <b>hatching</b> care remain unclear. This study investigated the <b>hatching</b> care of the subsocial shield bug, Parastrachia japonensis (Heteroptera: Parastrachiidae) to verify its function. Results show that the P. japonensis mothers vibrated the egg mass intermittently while maintaining an egg-guarding posture. Then embryos started to emerge from their shells synchronously. Unlike such behaviors of closely related species, this vibrating behavior was faint, but lasted more than 6 h. To investigate the effect of this behavior on <b>hatching</b> synchrony and <b>hatching</b> success, we observed the <b>hatching</b> pattern and the <b>hatching</b> rate in control, mother-removed, and two artificial vibration groups. Control broods experienced continuous guarding from the mother. Intermittent artificial vibration broods were exposed to vibrations that matched the temporal pattern of maternal vibration produced by a motor. They showed synchronous <b>hatching</b> patterns and high <b>hatching</b> rates. However, for mother-removed broods, which were isolated from the mother, and when we provided continuous artificial vibration that did not match the temporal pattern of the maternal vibration, embryo <b>hatching</b> was not only asynchronous: some embryos failed to emerge from their shells.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to test whether it is {{possible}} to produce early <b>hatching</b> cysts of Artemia franciscana from San Francisco Bay (SFB) by truncation selection. The starting material was an SFB cyst sample, harvested in nature. After selection of early <b>hatching</b> nauplii had taken place, these selected individuals were cultured to maturity, and the <b>hatching</b> rate of their offspring (F 1) was compared with that of the parental generation and with the non-selected control F 1. The possible differences in <b>hatching</b> rate were used to estimate heritability. Two different selection experiments were run, accompanied with a number of additional tests studying the influence of the <b>hatching</b> set-up, the <b>hatching</b> temperature and diapause termination using hydrogen peroxide, on the <b>hatching</b> rate.

Choosing the individuals based on their own phenotypic values (<b>hatching</b> within a certain time span of <b>hatching</b> incubation) and using those to produce the next generation, revealed a positive response. The selection in different salinities showed a different response.

40|$|Plasticity in {{the timing}} of {{transitions}} between stages of complex life cycles allows organisms to adjust their growth and development to local environ- mental conditions.

We studied the genetic architecture of <b>hatching</b> plasticity in embryos of the red-eyed treefrog (Agalychnis callidryas) in response to simulated predator attacks using a series of paternal and maternal half-sibs from a captive breeding colony of wild-collected animals. We compared the developmental timing of induced early <b>hatching</b> across sibships and estimated cross-environment genetic correlations between induced and spontaneous <b>hatching</b> traits.
