5|$|The Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources is {{responsible}} for general strategy in {{the oil and gas}} sectors and for monitoring the state-owned oil company, Saudi Aramco. The oil, gas and refining industries in Saudi Arabia are controlled by law by Saudi Aramco, which has a near monopoly in these areas. It is the world's biggest oil producer, the Middle East's biggest company and is generally considered {{to be the most important}} energy company in the world. However, in 2003, the law was changed to allow <b>foreign</b> <b>companies</b> to look for Saudi Arabia's vast reserves of natural gas, believed to represent 4% of the world's reserves. This was the first time since the 1970s that <b>foreign</b> <b>companies</b> have been permitted to search for oil or gas.|$|E

5000|$|The key {{difference}} between a manufacturing outsource situation and a contract manufacturing / subcontracting situation, {{is that in a}} contract manufacturing / subcontracting situation the contract manufacturer / subcontractor already has the equipment, tooling, procedure, supply chain, and expertise in place and is currently manufacturing products that are very similar [...] to the products that the <b>foreign</b> <b>company</b> needs. In contrast, a manufacturing outsource <b>company</b> utilizes the <b>foreign</b> <b>company's</b> equipment, tooling, supply chain, and procedure combined with in-house expertise to manufacture the <b>foreign</b> <b>company’s</b> product {{in exactly the same way}} the <b>foreign</b> <b>company</b> makes it themselves.|$|R
5000|$|The key {{difference}} between a manufacturing outsource situation and a [...] "shelter" [...] situation, {{is that in a}} shelter situation the <b>foreign</b> <b>company</b> must have a constant physical presence in Mexico to manage and oversee their operation, as the shelter provider bills the <b>foreign</b> <b>company</b> for the services provided (see “shelter” above) without taking responsibility for production, quality, and delivery of the product. In contrast, a manufacturing outsource <b>company</b> bills the <b>foreign</b> <b>company</b> on a “price per piece” basis which shifts the responsibility for production, quality, and delivery to the manufacturing outsource company; therefore allowing the <b>foreign</b> <b>company</b> to concentrate on their core competencies without having to manage a foreign manufacturing operation.|$|R

Important agricultural products include potatoes and cattle byproducts, including meat.

5|$|Purchase the Namer APC – Seats 9 {{soldiers}} with combat survival rates expected {{slightly higher than}} the GCV, and costs $9 billion less. The Namer has less ability to destroy other enemy vehicles and is less mobile.

5|$|Purchase the Puma (IFV) – More lethal {{than the}} GCV, combat {{survival}} and protection at better rates, {{and just as}} mobile. Purchasing the Puma would save $14.8 billion and was considered the most capable of the vehicles. Puma IFVs only carry six infantrymen, which would require five vehicles to replace every four Bradleys. Development and production would require collaboration with <b>foreign</b> <b>companies</b> and governments.|$|E

(OIL) are the leading companies with respect to production volume, whilst some <b>foreign</b> <b>companies</b> take part in upstream developments in joint-ventures and production sharing contracts (PSCs).

5|$|During the 1996 elections, the BJP shifted its stance {{away from}} {{protectionism}} and towards globalisation; its election manifesto recommended increasing {{foreign investment in}} priority sectors, while restricting it in others. When the party was in power in 1998, it shifted its policy even further in favour of globalisation. The tenure of the NDA saw an unprecedented influx of <b>foreign</b> <b>companies</b> in India. This was criticised by the left parties and the BJP's affiliates (the RSS and the Swadeshi Jagran Manch). The communist parties said that the BJP was attempting to appease the World Bank and the United States government through its neoliberal policies. Similarly, the RSS stated that the BJP was not being true to its swadeshi ideology.|$|E

It {{recommended that the}} Koninklijke Marine (Royal Netherlands Navy) acquire nine dreadnought-type battleships to protect the NEI from attack and help guarantee the country's neutrality in Europe. Five of these would be based in the colony, while the other four would operate out of the Netherlands. Seven <b>foreign</b> <b>companies</b> submitted designs for the contract; naval historians believe that a 26,850-long-ton (27,280tonnes) ship, whose design was submitted by the German firm Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft, would have been eventually selected.|$|E
5|$|The city {{industry}} {{is dominated by}} food processing, textile, printing and metal processing. In 2012, it accounted for 30% of the city GDP. Most of the industrial areas are located in Gazi Baba municipality, on the major routes and rail lines to Belgrade and Thessaloniki. Notably, the ArcelorMittal and Makstil steel plants are located there, and also the Skopje Brewery. Other zones are located between Aerodrom and Kisela Voda, along the railway to Greece. These zones comprise Alkaloid Skopje (pharmaceuticals), Rade Končar (electrical supplies), Imperial Tobacco, and Ohis (fertilisers). Two special economic zones also exist, around the airport and the Okta refinery. They have attracted several <b>foreign</b> <b>companies,</b> such as Johnson Controls, Johnson Matthey and Van Hool.|$|E
5|$|The {{pillars of}} the {{economic}} plan were trade and fiscal budget surpluses and a high exchange rate for the United States dollar. The surplus was increased by taxes levied during de la Rúa's presidency and the devaluation which occurred during the Duhalde administration. Kirchner sought to rebuild the Argentine industrial base, public works and public services, renegotiating the operation of public services privatized by Carlos Menem and owned by <b>foreign</b> <b>companies.</b> His policies were accompanied by a nationalist rhetoric sympathetic to the poor. However, despite of the financial prosperity, {{there was no significant}} {{decrease in the number of}} people living in poverty, which was 8 to 10 million people, or almost 25% of the country.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, {{banks were}} {{deregulated}} in Iceland. This {{set the stage}} for banks to upload debts when <b>foreign</b> <b>companies</b> were accumulated. The crisis unfolded when banks became unable to refinance their debts. It is estimated that the three major banks held foreign debt in excess of €50 billion, or about €160,000 per Icelandic resident, compared with Iceland's gross domestic product of €8.5 billion. As early as March 2008, the cost of private deposit insurance for deposits in Landsbanki and Kaupthing was already far higher (6–8½% of the sum deposited) than for other European banks. The króna, which was ranked by The Economist in early 2007 as the most overvalued currency in the world (based on the Big Mac Index), has further suffered from the effects of carry trading.|$|E
5|$|Nigeria Airways Ltd., more {{commonly}} known as Nigeria Airways, was a Nigerian airline. The company was founded in 1958 after the dissolution of West African Airways Corporation (WAAC). It held the name WAAC Nigeria until 1971, when it was rebranded to the name it had until it ceased operations in 2003. The government of Nigeria owned {{a majority of the}} airline (51%) until 1961, when it boosted its participation in the company to 100% and made it the country's flag carrier. At the time of dissolution, the airline's headquarters were at Airways House in Abuja. Operations were concentrated at Murtala Muhammed International Airport and served both domestic and international destinations mainly concentrated in West Africa; the network also had points in Europe, North America and Saudi Arabia. The airline was managed by a number of <b>foreign</b> <b>companies,</b> including British Airways, the Dutch company KLM and South African Airways.|$|E
5|$|The US-based United Fruit Company (UFC) {{was one of}} many <b>foreign</b> <b>companies</b> that {{acquired}} {{large tracts}} of both state land and indigenous land. Manuel Estrada Cabrera, who was president of Guatemala from 1898 to 1920, permitted limited unionization in rural Guatemala, but also made further concessions to the UFC. In 1922, the Communist Party of Guatemala was created, and became a significant influence among urban laborers; however, it had little reach among the rural and Indian populations. In 1929, the Great Depression led to the collapse of the economy and a rise in unemployment, leading to unrest among workers and laborers. Fearing the possibility of a revolution, the landed elite lent their support to Jorge Ubico y Castañeda, who had built a reputation for ruthlessness and efficiency as a provincial governor. Ubico won the election that followed in 1931, in which he was the only candidate.|$|E

5|$|In September 2014, Modi {{introduced}} the Make in India initiative to encourage <b>foreign</b> <b>companies</b> to manufacture products in India, {{with the goal}} of turning the country into a global manufacturing hub. Supporters of economic liberalisation supported the initiative, while critics argued it would allow foreign corporations to capture a greater share of the Indian market. In order to enable the construction of private industrial corridors, the Modi administration passed a land-reform bill that allowed it to acquire private agricultural land without conducting a social impact assessment, and without the consent of the farmers who owned it. Under the previous bill, the government had required the consent of 80% of the owners of a piece of property before acquiring it for a private project: this requirement was waived. The bill was passed via an executive order after it faced opposition in parliament, but was eventually allowed to lapse. Modi's government put in place the Goods and Services Tax, the biggest tax reform in the country since independence. It subsumed around 17 different taxes and became effective from 1 July 2017.|$|E
