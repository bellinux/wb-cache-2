5|$|After Smith's {{departure}} from the company for soft drinks producer PepsiCo in 1980, the company began to see a system-wide decline in sales. Pillsbury {{executive vice president of}} restaurant operations Norman E. Brinker was tasked with turning the brand around and strengthening its position against its main rival, McDonald's. One of his first acts was to initiate an advertising plan emphasizing claims that Burger King's flame-broiled burgers were better and larger than its rival's. The program, arguably the first attack ads on a food chain by a competitor, was controversial in that before <b>it</b> <b>fast</b> food ads only made allusions to the competition without ever mentioning them by name. McDonald's sued Burger King, their ad agency at the time J. Walter Thompson. The child actress Sarah Michelle Gellar was also implicated in the lawsuit because of her appearance in these television commercials. The suit was settled the following year on undisclosed terms. Despite the controversy, the ad plan, dubbed the Burger Wars, boosted same store sales. Brinker continued working for the company in this capacity until 1982 when he was promoted to president of Pillsbury's food service division, which included the company's other chains beyond Burger King. Brinker left the company in 1984 to take the helm at Dallas-based gourmet burger chain Chili's.|$|E

The phrase [...] "Honor to us all" [...] is {{constantly}} reiterated throughout the song. Its [...] "witty" [...] lyrics are intended to be highly ironic, expressing that a daughter can only honor both herself and her family by marrying, {{as demonstrated by the}} phrase [...] "A girl can bring her family great honor in one way, by striking a good match". Beginning with the line [...] "This is what you give me to work with", the performers then offer an extensive list of examples and qualities required to create an ideal bride, providing both oral and visual examples {{of what it means to}} be a woman, including the lyrics [...] "Wait and see, when we're through, boys will gladly go to war for you" [...] and [...] "With good breeding and a tiny waist you'll bring honor to us all." [...] According to The Criterion: A Journal in English contributor Joshi Aditi, the song also expresses the [...] "inner desire of the male" [...] using the lyrics [...] "Men want girls with good taste, calm, obedient/Who work fast-paced", which is later confirmed in the all-male musical number [...] "A Girl Worth Fighting For". The line [...] "scarier than the undertaker, we are meeting our Matchmaker" [...] appears towards the end of the song. Lyrically, [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] also makes heavy use of the literary device alliteration, as heard during its final verse [...] "Destiny, guard our girls/And our future as <b>it</b> <b>fast</b> unfurls/Please look kindly on these cultured pearls/Each a perfect porcelain doll". Thought Catalog contributor Chelsea Fagan felt that the song's lyrics make it appropriate for single women whose loved ones are constantly pressuring them to pursue romantic relationships despite the fact that they would much rather remain single: [...] "the kind of girl who doesn’t need to be put into a tight-waisted outfit to go find herself a husband and pop out a bunch of sword-wielding sons.

When Saratoga and Enterprises air groups began their runs on Red Beach in the pre-dawn hours they were virtually unopposed. The Japanese air response was coming in fast, though: the 5th Air Attack Force scrapped plans to attack the Allied airfield at Rabi and instead launched straightaway for Guadalcanal.

2500|$|... {{written in}} about 1660. This account is {{particularly}} noteworthy as {{he refers to}} football by its correct name in English and {{is the first to}} describe the following: modern goals and a pitch ("a close that has a gate at either end. The gates are called Goals"), tactics ("leaving some of their best players to guard the goal"), scoring ("they that can strike the ball through their opponents' goal first win") and the way teams were selected ("the players being equally divided according to their strength and nimbleness"). He is the first to describe a law of football: [...] "They often break one another's shins when two meet and strike both together against the ball, and therefore there is a law that they must not strike higher than the ball". His account of the ball itself is also very informative: [...] "They blow a strong bladder and tie the neck of it as fast as they can, and then put it into the skin of a bull's cod and sew <b>it</b> <b>fast</b> in". He adds: [...] "The harder the ball is blown, the better it flies. They used to put quicksilver into it sometimes to keep it from lying still".

2500|$|The {{production}} {{was not without}} its lucky accidents: The company had just finished shooting the final segment of the sequence where Phyllis and Walter make their getaway after dumping their victim's body on the tracks. The crew was breaking for lunch before striking the set. In the script, the pair get in their car and simply drive away. But as Wilder got into his own car to leave, it wouldn't start. Inspired, he ran back and ordered the crew back. Wilder reshot the scene, only this time as Phyllis starts the car, the motor stalls and won't turn over.

2500|$|Cruyff's footballing {{principles}} {{have significantly}} influenced the football career of many players and managers, including Frank Rijkaard and Pep Guardiola, two devoted disciples and successors of the Cruyffian (Barça-Ajax) school of football. Without Cruyff operating {{behind the scenes}} as the spiritual father of Barça, {{there could be no}} Joan Laporta presidency, and Rijkaard and Guardiola, two largely unproven managers, could never have been appointed. Guardiola, a typical product (graduate) of Cruyffian school, who was the manager of Barcelona between 2008 and 2012, stated: [...] "Throughout my career I've simply tried to instil what I learned from Johan Cruyff. He has had the biggest influence on football out of anyone in the world, first as a player and then as a coach. He taught me a lot {{and you can see that}} in the fact that so many of his former players are now coaches". Guardiola added, [...] "Johan Cruyff built the cathedral, our job is to maintain and renovate it." [...] In regards to how the football world will remember Cruyff's posthumous legacy, he said, [...] "As a player and as a manager he won a lot of titles, but that's not his legacy. The titles only help. Johan has changed two clubs. Not only did he change Ajax, but also Barcelona – and then the Dutch and Spanish national teams, too. Forget the titles. I've won more titles than him. Messi, for example, is someone runs less and in that he's the best of Cruyff's alumni. (...) I would not have been capable of doing what he did at Barcelona. He changed everything. He did it all. What Cruyff's done for football cannot be compared. The statue thing is superficial. He has made us love this sport so openly that there's no way we can forget him." [...] Jürgen Klinsmann, the head coach of the United States national team, said about Cruyff's overall impact on contemporary football, [...] "More than an athlete, Cruyff was also a great thinker, someone who reinvented the sport... Cruyff has left us now, but his vision and philosophy will hopefully live forever. You can see it in the way Barcelona—one of two clubs Cruyff revolutionized, along with Ajax—still plays every week. It's a style that has admirers around the world. I think a lot of people share that [...] with him. You want to see this type of game, where you set the tone, you control the game, you make <b>it</b> <b>fast,</b> you make it attractive and attacking.
