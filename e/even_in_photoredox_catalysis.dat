5000|$|<b>Photoredox</b> <b>{{catalysis}}</b> is {{a branch}} of catalysis that harnesses the energy of light to accelerate a chemical reaction via single-electron transfer events. This area is named as a combination of [...] "photo-" [...] referring to light and redox, a condensed expression for the chemical processes of reduction and oxidation. <b>In</b> particular, <b>photoredox</b> <b>catalysis</b> employs small quantities of a light-sensitive compound that, when excited by light, can mediate the transfer of electrons between chemical compounds that otherwise would react more slowly or not at all. Photoredox catalysts are generally drawn from three classes of materials: transition-metal complexes, organic dyes and semiconductors. While organic photoredox catalysts were dominant throughout the 1990's and early 2000's, soluble transition-metal complexes are more commonly used today.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThree copper {{complexes}} (E 1, G 1, and G 2) {{with different}} ligands {{in combination with}} an iodonium salt (and optionally another additive) were used to generate radicals upon soft visible light exposure (e. g., polychromatic visible light from a halogen lamp, laser diodes at 405 and 457 nm, LEDs at 405 and 455 nm). This approach can be worthwhile and versatile to initiate free radical photopolymerization, ring-opening cationic photopolymerization, and the synthesis of interpenetrating polymer networks.

40|$|The boom <b>in</b> {{visible light}} <b>photoredox</b> <b>catalysis</b> (VLPC) {{research}} has demonstrated that this novel synthetic approach is here to stay. VLPC enables reactive radical intermediates to be catalytically generated at ambient temperature, a feat not generally allowed through traditional pyrolysis- or radical initiator-based methodologies. VLPC has vastly extended the range of substrates and reaction schemes that have been traditionally the domain of radical reactions. In this review the photophysics background of VLPC will be briefly discussed, followed by a report on recent inroads of VLPC into decarboxylative couplings and radical C-H functionalization of aromatic compounds.

Although the D3-symmetric transition-metal complexes used in many photoredox-catalyzed reactions are chiral, the use of enantioenriched photoredox catalysts led to low levels of enantioselectivity in a photoredox-catalyzed aryl-aryl coupling reaction, suggesting that the chiral nature of these catalysts is not yet a highly effective means of transmitting stereochemical information <b>in</b> <b>photoredox</b> reactions. However, while synthetically useful levels of enantioselectivity have not been achieved using chiral photoredox catalysts alone, optically-active products have been obtained through the synergistic combination of <b>photoredox</b> <b>catalysis</b> with chiral organocatalysts such as secondary amines and Brønsted acids.|$|R

40|$|Supramolecular {{chemistry}} {{allows the}} rapid formation of complex systems through self-assembly. These systems often possess unique properties not observed for conventional covalent constructs and have potential applications {{in areas such}} as sensing, drug delivery and catalysis. Metallosupramolecular container compounds have been shown to catalyse reactions with both regio- and stereo-selectivity in methods analogous to enzyme type <b>catalysis.</b> Separately, visible-light <b>photoredox</b> <b>catalysis</b> has recently gained considerable interest as an efficient, green and mild method for the rapid synthesis of many chemical compounds. In order to combine the favourable properties of both supramolecular <b>catalysis</b> and visible-light <b>photoredox</b> <b>catalysis,</b> a number of photoredox active metallosupramolecular assemblies were designed, synthesised and analysed. Initial steps were taken to stabilise a known iridium-based M 6 L 4 luminescent cage compound to allow guest encapsulation to take place. The incorporation of isocyanide donors as strong ligands improved the stability of model compounds but synthesis of an analogous three-dimensional assembly was unsuccessful. Instead, a “complex-as-ligand” approach was taken that allowed the straight-forward formation of Pd 2 L 4 systems from a range of photoactive iridium complexes. Importantly, unlike many other photoactive systems, the complexation to palladium did not drastically affect the photoredox properties of the constituent iridium complexes. Multiple approaches were then taken to improve both the stability and guest binding properties of the photoactive assembly in an effort to achieve supramolecular <b>photoredox</b> <b>catalysis.</b> Utilising a model system, a general method was thus developed for enhancing the association constants of neutral guests in organic solvents by switching to large, non-coordinating counter ions that provided reduced competition for the internal binding site. In combination with this increased binding affinity, a range of guest properties were adjusted by association with the hydrogen bond donor environment of the internal cavity. The encapsulation of quinone based oxidants led to unexpected and novel reaction pathways not observed in the bulk phase.
