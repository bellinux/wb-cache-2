Moreover, since the Year Bearers are <b>geographically</b> <b>identified</b> with boundary markers or mountains, they help define the local community.|$|R

This study introduces a crawler methodology of collecting large amount of content data that could be connected to addresses with known geographical position. By analysing geocoded web content completely new aspects of regional inequalities of the information age appear. Queries of keywords reflect that geocoded web content is not spatially random but follows certain geographical characteristics of the society. On the other hand, visual interpretations of results revealed new inequality patterns and served as evidences of presumed but not yet tested assumptions...|$|R

The PIGME technique is a fast non-destructive and accurate method for determining these three elements with essentially no special sample preparation. The measuring technique is described and results are listed for sources chiefly in the Papua New Guinea region. Their classification is discussed in terms of groups which are distinguishable by the PIGME method.

5000|$|The use {{of signs}} to {{communicate}} a marketer’s message <b>places</b> advertising in <b>geographically</b> <b>identified</b> areas {{in order to}} capture customer attention. The most obvious method of using signs is through billboards, which are generally located in high traffic areas. Outdoor billboards come in many sizes, though the most well-known are large structures located near transportation points intending to attract the interest of people traveling on roads or public transportation. Indoor billboards are often smaller than outdoor billboards and are designed {{to attract the attention}} of foot traffic (i.e., those moving past the sign). For example, smaller signage in airports, train terminals and large commercial office space fit this category.|$|R

The vast majority of these visits were because of an infective illness; and developmental and behavioural problems were rarely presented to GPs. 53 % of children had not been to hospital since birth, but 11 % had been at least four times. Respiratory infections and middle ear disease were the commonest illness reported, and nearly 3 % had an infected or discharging ear at the time of examination. 15 % of 3 year olds had speech and language problems. 18 % of children over 2 years were thought by the examiners to have a behavioural problem, half being assessed as mild, the remainder as moderate or severe...|$|R

30|$|To be exact, {{there were}} a total of 45 MSAs in the CPS dataset. However, 12 of these MSAs: Milwaukee, Phoenix, Columbus, Rochester, Sacramento, Fort Worth, Birmingham, Albany Schenectady Troy, Norfolk Portsmouth, Akron, Gary Hammond East Chicago, and Greensboro Winston Salem High Point, were created only after 1977. Also, 3 MSAs ceased to exist after 1985 : Nassau Suffolk, Newark, and Patterson Clifton Passaic. These MSAs were {{therefore}} excluded from our analysis to ensure consistency in the control units throughout the period 1973 – 1988. Furthermore, the redefinition of MSAs after 1985 resulted {{in a number of}} preexisting MSAs being merged with other MSAs: A total of 3 mergers were created: (1) Anaheim Santa Ana Garden Grove—Los Angeles Long Beach, (2) San Bernardino Riverside Ontario—Los Angeles Long Beach, and (3) San Jose—San Francisco Oakland. Hence, observations from the 3 originally independent MSAs: Anaheim Santa Ana Garden Grove, San Bernardino Riverside Ontario, and San Jose, were subsumed into the combined entities. All in all, these meant that only 27 of the original 45 <b>geographically</b> <b>identified</b> MSAs were available for use.|$|R
40|$|This project {{seeks to}} advance the state of {{knowledge}} {{of the relationship between}} transportation and economic development by investigating how firms in competitive industry clusters use transportation networks and what role the networks play in the formation and growth of these clusters. The approach combines quantitative and qualitative techniques to <b>geographically</b> <b>identify</b> competitive industry clusters and to investigate the role of transportation. The U. S. Cluster Mapping tool is used to identify competitive clusters by employment location quotients in 25 Minnesota metropolitan and micropolitan regions. Twelve competitive clusters were selected for further study, and in-depth interviews and site visits were conducted with businesses in each cluster to explore the competitive importance of different modes of transportation. These methods can yield valuable insights into how transportation functions as an input within competitive industry clusters and how it can inform economic development strategies tailored to certain locations and industries.
