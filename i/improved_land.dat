5|$|In the Neolithic period, {{from around}} 6,000 years ago, there is {{evidence}} of permanent settlements and farming. This includes the well-preserved stone house at Knap of Howar on Papa Westray, dating from around 3500 BCE and the village of similar houses at Skara Brae on West Mainland, Orkney from about 500 years later. Evidence of prehistoric farming includes small plots of <b>improved</b> <b>land,</b> with simple stone boundaries. On Shetland these have been found under peat and on the mainland they are associated with cairnfields (piles of rocks that have been cleared from fields). Archaeological evidence of pollen, pottery, settlements and human remains indicates that the two main sources of food were grain and cow milk, in a pattern that probably remained constant until the High Middle Ages. There is also some limited evidence of the cultivation of flax from this period.|$|E

25|$|John Locke {{stated that}} {{whenever}} labour {{is mixed with}} natural resources, such {{as is the case}} with <b>improved</b> <b>land,</b> private property is justified under the proviso that there must be enough other natural resources of the same quality available to others. Geoists state that the Lockean proviso is violated wherever land value is greater than zero. Therefore, under the assumed principle of equal rights of all people to natural resources, the occupier of any such land must compensate the rest of society to the amount of that value. For this reason, geoists generally believe that such payment cannot be regarded as a true 'tax', but rather a compensation or fee. This means that while Geoists also regard taxation as an instrument of social justice, contrary to social democrats and social liberals they do not regard it as an instrument of redistribution but rather a 'predistribution' or simply a correct distribution of the commons.|$|E

500|$|There {{followed}} {{a period when}} improvement of the moors for agriculture was considered the way to proceed. An entrepreneur named John Gossip bought [...] of moor near Lindholme, and set about warping it with silt from an old river bed near Lindholme Lake. The cost proved excessive, and he installed a stationary steam engine and narrow gauge railway tracks, on which small wagons were pushed by hand, to aid the work. He ran into financial difficulties, however, and the land was repossessed by his backers. The main emphasis of the Thorne Moor Improvement Company, set up in 1848, was the [...] "draining, warping and otherwise improving" [...] of Thorne Waste, but the railway across the moors proposed by the Great Northern Railway Company, which was to provide transport for {{the products of the}} <b>improved</b> <b>land,</b> did not materialise, and little was achieved.|$|E
500|$|As {{a congressman}} for three months, Greeley {{introduced}} legislation for a homestead act {{that would allow}} settlers who <b>improved</b> <b>land</b> to purchase it at low rates—a fourth of what speculators would pay. He was quickly noticed because he launched a series of attacks on legislative privileges, taking note of which congressmen were missing votes, and questioning the office of House Chaplain. This {{was enough to make}} him unpopular. But he outraged his colleagues when on December 22, 1848 the Tribune published evidence that many congressmen had been paid excessive sums as travel allowance. In January 1849, Greeley supported {{a bill that would have}} corrected the issue, but it was defeated. He was so disliked, he wrote a friend, that he had [...] "divided the House into two parties—one that would like to see me extinguished and the other that wouldn't be satisfied without a hand in doing it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{a mutual}} home {{ownership}} corporation, rents are kept low {{by creating an}} economy of scale. There are also savings for mass-construction, <b>improved</b> <b>land</b> use, centralized facilities, operating economies, and maintaining a non-profit status. [...] Costs can also be contained—although controversially—by the federal government providing all necessary public works (i.e. sewers, streets, curbs, sidewalks) through the Works Progress Administration (WPA). According to Colonel Lawrence Westbrook, membership in the community {{should be based on}} a process in which individuals of predominantly similar income groups from a cross-section of area occupations, and from different age groups, are selected. [...] These demographics made the community less vulnerable to economic crisis, while the differing family sizes and space needs allowed for flexibility in housing requirements. Plans called for the final selling price of the Mutual Housing project to be set through negotiations between two separate appraisers—one representing {{the federal government and the}} other representing the Corporation—and title would be transferred at the 20% amortization point.|$|E

60|$|But {{with regard}} to capital {{actually}} sunk in improvements, and not requiring periodical renewal, but spent once for all in giving the land a permanent increase of productiveness, {{it appears to me}} that the return made to such capital loses altogether the character of profits, and is governed by the principles of rent. It is true that a landlord will not expend capital in improving his estate unless he expects from the improvement an increase of income surpassing the interest of his outlay. Prospectively, this increase of income may be regarded as profit; but, when the expense has been incurred and the improvement made, the rent of the <b>improved</b> <b>land</b> is governed by the same rules as that of the unimproved.|$|E
6000|$|I {{have come}} to Scotland to exhort you to engage in this battle and devote your whole energy and {{influence}} to securing a memorable victory. Every {{nation in the world}} has its own way of doing things, its own successes and its own failures. All over Europe we see systems of land tenure which economically, socially, and politically are far superior to ours; but the benefits that those countries derive from their <b>improved</b> <b>land</b> systems are largely swept away, or at any rate neutralised, by grinding tariffs on the necessaries of life and the materials of manufacture. In this country we have long enjoyed the blessings of Free Trade and of untaxed bread and meat, but against these inestimable benefits we have the evils of an unreformed and vicious land system. In no great country in the new world or the old have the working people yet secured the double advantage of free trade and free land together, by which I mean a commercial system and a land system from which, so far as possible, all forms of monopoly have been rigorously excluded. Sixty years ago our system of national taxation was effectively reformed, and immense and undisputed advantages accrued therefrom to all classes, the richest as well as the poorest. The system of local taxation to-day is just as vicious and wasteful, just as great an impediment to enterprise and progress, just as harsh a burden upon the poor, as the thousand taxes and Corn Law sliding scales of the [...] "hungry 'forties." [...] We are met in an hour of tremendous opportunity. [...] "You who shall liberate the land," [...] said Mr. Cobden, [...] "will do more for your country than we have done in the liberation of its commerce." ...|$|E
6000|$|Sect. 37. This is certain, {{that in the}} beginning, {{before the}} desire of having more than man needed had altered the {{intrinsic}} value of things, which depends only on their usefulness {{to the life of}} man; or had agreed, that a little piece of yellow metal, which would keep without wasting or decay, should be worth a great piece of flesh, or a whole heap of corn; though men had a right to appropriate, by their labour, each one of himself, as much of the things of nature, as he could use: yet this could not be much, nor to the prejudice of others, where the same plenty was still left to those who would use the same industry. To which let me add, that he who appropriates land to himself by his labour, does not lessen, but increase the common stock of mankind: for the provisions serving to the support of human life, produced by one acre of inclosed and cultivated land, are (to speak much within compass) ten times more than those which are yielded by an acre of land of an equal richness lying waste in common. And therefore he that incloses land, and has a greater plenty of the conveniencies of life from ten acres, than he could have from an hundred left to nature, may truly be said to give ninety acres to mankind: for his labour now supplies him with provisions out of ten acres, which were but the product of an hundred lying in common. I have here rated the <b>improved</b> <b>land</b> very low, in making its product but as ten to one, when it is much nearer an hundred to one: for I ask, whether in the wild woods and uncultivated waste of America, left to nature, without any improvement, tillage or husbandry, a thousand acres yield the needy and wretched inhabitants as many conveniencies of life, as ten acres of equally fertile land do in Devonshire, where they are well cultivated? ...|$|E
