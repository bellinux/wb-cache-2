Therefore, mathematical models of both reforming process and internal combustion engine were implemented. In particular, steams reforming of glycerol to produce synthesis gas and spark <b>ignition</b> four <b>strokes</b> ICE were studied. The reforming process mathematical model was verified using experimental data. Synthesis gas was used to feed the ICE with different syngas and engine configuration.

Smoke and NOX are main pollutants of emission from diesel engine {{and it is very}} difficult to control them simultaneously Petroleum based fuels is a finite resource that is rapidly depleting. Consequently, petroleum reserves are not sufficient enough to last many years. Biodiesel is one of the alternative fuel made from vegetable oil, friendly for environment and has no effect on health and can reduce the emission compared with diesel fuel.

40|$|Abstract- Increasing the {{consumption}} of fuel in power and automobile sector, increase the pollution of the environment. Smoke and NOx are main pollutants of emission from diesel engine {{and it is very}} difficult to control them simultaneously. A preliminary literature review suggests that smoke and NOx can be reduced by adding additives in diesel. But some additives are very costly and not vible because they reduce smoke and NOx while decreasing the performance of combustion. In the present study Nitromethane (NM) (2 %) was used as an additive with diesel, and investigate the performance characteristic of it on compression ignition engine (A single cylinder, direct <b>ignition,</b> four <b>stroke,</b> vertical, water cooled, naturally aspirated, variable compression ratio diesel engine). The performance and emission characteristics of the engine run on diesel at compression ratio 17. 5 : 1 were evaluated and compared with engine operating on NM-Diesel blend at compression ratio 17. 5 : 1 and 16. 5 : 1. The performance has been studied and compare for diesel and NM- Diesel blend for two compression ratios. Keywords- NM-Diesel, VCR diesel engine, acetone. I...|$|R

The present work is investigate on ethanol-diesel blends with and without additive for their suitability of hot surface <b>ignition</b> four <b>stroke</b> single cylinder C. I engine on cylindrical type combustion chamber in varies ratios of ethanol-diesel blends. The blends are 100 %diesel, 85 %diesel with 10 %ethanol and 5 %additive, 75 %diesel with 20 %ethanol and 5 %additive, 55 %diesel with 40 %ethanol and 5 %additive, 35 %diesel with 60 %ethanol and 5 %additive, 100 %ethanol, 90 %diesel and 10 %ethanol, 80 %diesel and 20 %ethanol, 60 %diesel and 40 %ethanol, 40 %diesel and 60 %ethanol and 90 %diesel and 10 %ethanol. The fuel consumptions of the engine fuelled by diesel were higher, compared with those fuelled by pure ethanol. The differences were from 10. 2 % to 31. 5 % at different engine loads. When fueled with pure ethanol given 26. 7 % out put at 4. 5 kw and 26. 8 % at 3. 5 kw engine load. The stabilized zirconia ceramic heater is used to reduce the CO, HC, NOx and smoke emissions and improve engine output behaviors. The reduction of CO emissions from the blended fuels were from 2 % to 16. 1 % at 10 % ethanol blends, NOx emissions from 200. 36 ppm to 1547. 29 ppm and the maximum reduction of smoke was observed at 43. 5 %.

40|$|In all {{internal}} combustion engines {{working on a}} cycle in which a combustible mixture is compressed prior to the <b>ignition</b> and expansion <b>strokes,</b> the efficiency {{is limited to the}} efficiency at which the maximum compression temperature is equal to the ignition temperature of the fuel used. For the {{internal combustion}} engines, such as are used in the automotive and airplane field, the fuel is gasoline. This has a flash point at about 600 degrees Fahrenheit, depending on the gravity of the fuel. Compression temperatures higher than this, cause preignition. In fact compression temperatures approaching this limit are difficult of realization because of detonation or knocking. It is evident on analysis that the higher is the expansion ratio the higher will be the efficiency of any engine; for the larger is this ratio, the more will the heat of combustion be utilized in doing useful work. Due to mechanical reasons it is customary in engine work to keep the expansion ratio practically equal to the compression ratio, so that the efficiency is limited to that determined by the compression ratio, which is in turn limited by the final temperature of compression. It has been the purpose of the investigation to develop a method which has been proposed for lowering the maximum compression temperature so that an increase in the expansion ratio could be realized. In this method cooling of the charge during the compression stroke is obtained by connecting the cylinder with an auxiliary chamber through a valve during a portion of the compression stroke. The pressure in the auxiliary chamber builds up until the flow from the chamber when the connecting valve is first opened is equal to that forced back into the chamber during the time the valve is open. The auxiliary chamber is fitted with cooling tubes so that cooling in the cylinder is affected by means of these gases and the lower compression ratio during that portion of the stroke when the auxiliary valve is open...|$|R
