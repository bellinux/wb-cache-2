5|$|Since the Neolithic Revolution about 47% of the world's forests {{have been}} lost to human use. Present-day forests occupy {{about a quarter of}} the world's {{ice-free}} land with about half of these occurring in the tropics. In temperate and boreal regions forest area <b>is</b> <b>gradually</b> increasing (with the exception of Siberia), but deforestation in the tropics is of major concern.|$|E
5|$|The 11 {{miles of}} Devon section remains open, despite various threats to its future, {{and is now}} a {{designated}} country park and local nature reserve, and allows navigation. The Somerset section was closed in 1867, and <b>is</b> <b>gradually</b> disappearing from the landscape, although sections are now used as a footpath. It maintains a historical interest and has been subject to some archaeological excavations.|$|E

5|$|Wellingborough has {{approximately}} 2,500 registered businesses {{within its}} boundaries. Much {{of the town}} centre was redeveloped during the 1970s, when it grew rapidly from London overspill. The Borough Council has adopted a 'Town Centre Action Plan'. The former traditional economic structure based on footwear and engineering <b>is</b> <b>gradually</b> diversifying with wholesale, logistics, and service sectors providing new opportunities for employment.|$|E

5|$|While some 19th-century {{experiments}} {{suggested that}} the underlying premise is true if the heating is sufficiently gradual, according to contemporary biologists the premise is false: a frog that <b>is</b> <b>gradually</b> heated will jump out. Indeed, thermoregulation by changing location is a fundamentally necessary survival strategy for frogs and other ectotherms.|$|E
5|$|As the {{consultant}} {{talks with the}} residents of the town and investigates its history, the backstory of his injury <b>is</b> <b>gradually</b> revealed. After repeatedly stubbing his toe and covering it up with Apex bandages, {{the consultant}} accidentally stepped into pig feces during a company team retreat. Because of the colored bandage, he never discovered how his toe was badly infected, and fainted on the sidewalk after fleeing from an awards party. This led to the amputation of his toe, his departure from the nomenclature firm, and the beginning of his hermetic lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|Barium, as a {{metal or}} when alloyed with aluminium, {{is used to}} remove {{unwanted}} gases (gettering) from vacuum tubes, such as TV picture tubes. Barium is suitable for this purpose because of its low vapor pressure and reactivity towards oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water; it can even partly remove noble gases by dissolving them in the crystal lattice. This application <b>is</b> <b>gradually</b> disappearing due to the rising popularity of the tubeless LCD and plasma sets.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} step, the crystal {{is placed in}} an intense beam of X-rays, usually of a single {{wavelength}} (monochromatic X-rays), producing the regular pattern of reflections. As the crystal <b>is</b> <b>gradually</b> rotated, previous reflections disappear and new ones appear; the intensity of every spot is recorded at every orientation of the crystal. Multiple data sets {{may have to be}} collected, with each set covering slightly more than half a full rotation of the crystal and typically containing tens of thousands of reflections.|$|E
5|$|Incubation {{takes two}} weeks. The hatched young, called squabs, are {{strongly}} altricial, being helpless at hatching {{and covered with}} down. Both parents feed the squabs pigeon's milk (dove's milk) for the first 3–4 days of life. Thereafter, the crop milk <b>is</b> <b>gradually</b> augmented by seeds. Fledging takes place in about 11–15 days, before the squabs are fully grown but after {{they are capable of}} digesting adult food. They stay nearby to be fed by their father for up to two weeks after fledging.|$|E
5|$|Sirius appears bright {{because of}} its {{intrinsic}} luminosity and its proximity to Earth. At a distance of 2.6 parsecs (8.6 ly), {{as determined by the}} Hipparcos astrometry satellite, the Sirius system is one of Earth's near neighbours. Sirius <b>is</b> <b>gradually</b> moving closer to the Solar System, so it will slightly increase in brightness over the next 60,000 years. After that time its distance will begin to increase and it will become fainter, but it will continue to be the brightest star in the Earth's night sky for the next 210,000 years.|$|E

5000|$|The {{linguistic}} {{heartland of}} the Saka language was the Kingdom of Khotan, which had two dialects, {{corresponding to the}} major settlements at Khotan (modern Hotan) and Tumshuq (Tumxuk). The Saka heartland <b>was</b> <b>gradually</b> conquered during the Turkic expansion, beginning in the 4th century and the area <b>was</b> <b>gradually</b> [...] "Turkified" [...] linguistically (under the Uighurs).|$|R
5|$|The Binding Blade {{is set on}} {{the fictional}} {{continent}} of Elibe, which is dominated by humans {{in the wake of}} an ancient war between humanity and dragons. The story follows Roy from the small country of Pherae as he leads a growing army against the forces of King Zephiel of the kingdom of Bern, who <b>is</b> <b>gradually</b> taking over Elibe. As with other Fire Emblem games, battles take place on a grid-based map, with player units assigned character classes taking part in single combat with enemies and being subject to permanent death if defeated.|$|E
5|$|The eggs {{have large}} yolks; {{cleavage}} (division) is superficial and a germinal disc develops at the pole. During gastrulation, {{the margins of}} this grow down and surround the yolk, forming a yolk sac, which eventually forms part of the gut. The dorsal side of the disc grows upwards and forms the embryo, with a shell gland on its dorsal surface, gills, mantle and eyes. The arms and funnel develop {{as part of the}} foot on the ventral side of the disc. The arms later migrate upwards, coming to form a ring around the funnel and mouth. The yolk <b>is</b> <b>gradually</b> absorbed as the embryo develops.|$|E
5|$|The {{variations}} {{between the}} AADT and the ASDT traffic volumes {{are attributed to}} the fact that the motorway carries certain tourist traffic from Hungary to the Croatian motorway network and ultimately to the Adriatic Sea. On average the motorway carries 15% increased volume of traffic during summer months. As the Hungarian M6 motorway <b>is</b> <b>gradually</b> extended towards the Croatian border and the A5 motorway's northern terminus, the number of tourists traveling along this route in summer months is increasing.|$|E

5|$|There are two {{medical schools}} in the territory, one based at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and the other at the University of Hong Kong. Both have links with public sector hospitals. With respect to {{postgraduate}} education, traditionally many doctors in Hong Kong have looked overseas for further training, and many took British Royal College exams such as the MRCP(UK) and the MRCS(UK). However, Hong Kong has been developing its own postgraduate medical institutions, in particular the Hong Kong Academy of Medicine, and this <b>is</b> <b>gradually</b> taking over the responsibility for all postgraduate medical training in the territory.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} Victorville area the scenery changes, as {{suburban}} neighborhoods disappear and the highway traverses the Mojave Desert. While crossing the desert, the route clips the northeastern corner of Edwards Air Force Base. Just past the base the road intersects SR 58 at Kramer Junction. This is currently an at-grade intersection; however, SR58 <b>is</b> <b>gradually</b> being upgraded to a freeway. After leaving Kramer Junction 395 passes the Kramer Junction Solar Electric Generating Station. US395 crosses the Rand and El Paso Mountains, where the highway crosses into San Bernardino–Kern county line, near Johannesburg. While traversing these mountains the route crosses a former Southern Pacific rail line, {{now owned by}} the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) that loosely follows the route of State Route 14 through the Mojave. Though the railroad is abandoned north of Searles Station, US 395 parallels the old railroad grade from this point to Lone Pine.|$|E
5|$|As a {{teenager}} John proves his worth and <b>is</b> <b>gradually</b> granted positions of authority, first as Master of the Falcons, then as Lord Warden of the East Marches and Constable of England. He takes all three positions seriously, devoting {{himself to the}} acquirement of knowledge necessary for effective administration. He comes {{of age in the}} midst of these busy tasks, a ready pupil to the string of men sent to advise him. He helps his father withstand the Glyndŵr and Northern Risings, and wisely gives military command to his more experienced uncle Westmorland. He understands that his administrative skill is more useful than acting as a soldier, and earns the respect of the people under his control by not being unduly harsh with punishment and embarking on negotiations with the Scots.|$|E
