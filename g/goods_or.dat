25|$|Chandogya Upanishad, {{in chapter}} 1.2, {{describes}} {{the battle between}} Devas and Asuras on various sensory powers. This battle {{between good and evil}} fails to produce a victor and simply manifests itself in the perceived universe, as <b>good</b> <b>or</b> evil sights witnessed by beings, as <b>good</b> <b>or</b> evil words shared between people, as <b>good</b> <b>or</b> evil smells of nature, as <b>good</b> <b>or</b> evil feelings experienced, as <b>good</b> <b>or</b> evil thoughts within each person. Finally, the Deva-Asura battle targets the soul, where Asuras fail and Devas succeed, because soul-force is serene and inherently good, asserts Chandogya Upanishad.|$|R

5|$|Many feminist economists argue {{economics}} {{should be}} focused less on mechanisms (like income) or theories (such as utilitarianism) {{and more on}} well-being, a multidimensional concept including income, health, education, empowerment and social status. They argue that economic success {{can not be measured}} only by <b>goods</b> <b>or</b> gross domestic product, but must also be measured by human well-being. Aggregate income is not sufficient to evaluate general well-being, because individual entitlements and needs must also be considered, leading feminist economists to study health, longevity, access to property, education, and related factors.|$|E
5|$|Moving towards energy {{sustainability}} {{will require}} changes {{not only in}} the way energy is supplied, but in the way it is used, and reducing the amount of energy required to deliver various <b>goods</b> <b>or</b> services is essential. Opportunities for improvement on the demand side of the energy equation are as rich and diverse as those on the supply side, and often offer significant economic benefits.|$|E
5|$|The strike action led to {{a backlog}} of tens of {{millions}} of items of undelivered mail, with an estimated 30 million letters and parcels affected after the first wave of walkouts, and rising to in excess of 50 million following the second. Businesses in London were forced to lay off staff, or defer paying them, generally because they were unable to dispatch <b>goods</b> <b>or</b> couldn't receive payment for them. However, the strikes had less of an impact outside the capital.|$|E
50|$|In economics, {{marginal}} {{concepts are}} associated with a specific change in the quantity used of a <b>good</b> <b>or</b> service, as opposed to some notion of the over-all significance of that class of <b>good</b> <b>or</b> service, or of some total quantity thereof.|$|R

5000|$|As {{defined by}} the Austrian School of {{economics}} the marginal use of a <b>good</b> <b>or</b> service is the specific use to which an agent would put a given increase, or the specific use of the <b>good</b> <b>or</b> service that would be abandoned {{in response to a}} given decrease. [...] The usefulness of the marginal use thus corresponds to the marginal utility of the <b>good</b> <b>or</b> service.|$|R
5|$|Trade {{was a key}} {{component}} of Maya society, and {{in the development of the}} Maya civilization. The cities that grew to become the most important usually controlled access to vital trade <b>goods,</b> <b>or</b> portage routes. Cities such as Kaminaljuyu and Q'umarkaj in the Guatemalan Highlands, and Chalchuapa in El Salvador, variously controlled access to the sources of obsidian at different points in Maya history. The most important cities in the northern Yucatán Peninsula controlled access to the sources of salt. In the Postclassic, the Maya engaged in a flourishing slave trade with wider Mesoamerica.|$|E
5|$|Work teams (also {{referred}} to as production and service teams) are continuing work units responsible for producing <b>goods</b> <b>or</b> providing services for the organization. Their membership is typically stable, usually full-time, and well-defined. These teams are traditionally directed by a supervisor who mandates what work is done, who does it, and in what manner is it executed. Work teams are effectively used in manufacturing sectors such as mining and apparel and service based sectors such as accounting which utilize audit teams.|$|E
5|$|A PPF (production {{possibility}} frontier) typically {{takes the}} form of the curve illustrated above. An economy that is operating on the PPF is said to be efficient, meaning that {{it would be impossible to}} produce more of one good without decreasing production of the other good. In contrast, if the economy is operating below the curve, it is said to be operating inefficiently because it could reallocate resources in order to produce more of both <b>goods</b> <b>or</b> some resources such as labor or capital are sitting idle and could be fully employed to produce more of both goods.|$|E
50|$|Intrinsicism is {{the belief}} that value is a non-relational {{characteristic}} of an object. This means that an object can be valuable <b>or</b> not, <b>good</b> <b>or</b> bad, without reference to who it is <b>good</b> <b>or</b> bad for, and without reference to the reason it is <b>good</b> <b>or</b> bad. One example of this might be the belief that certain sex acts are intrinsically evil, even if they harm no one.|$|R
30|$|According to the CIS 3, product (<b>good</b> <b>or</b> service) {{innovation}} is ‘the market {{introduction of a}} new <b>good</b> <b>or</b> service or a significantly improved <b>good</b> <b>or</b> service with respect to its capabilities, such as improved software, user friendliness, components or sub-systems. The innovation (new or improved) must be new to your enterprise, {{but it does not}} need to be new to your sector or market. It does not matter if the innovation was originally developed by your enterprise or by other enterprises’.|$|R

He rejected the position that God loves or hates a soul based on its inclination toward <b>good</b> <b>or</b> evil, before the soul actually commits a <b>good</b> <b>or</b> evil act.

5|$|Currency {{was often}} used for {{settling}} judicial fines, taxes and payments for <b>goods</b> <b>or</b> services. However, remuneration for services to the king, officials and temples were often made {{in the form of}} land revenue. The oldest coins found at Anuradhapura date up to 200 BC. These earliest coins were punch marked rectangular pieces of silver known as kahavanu. These eventually became circular in shape, which were in turn followed by die struck coins. Uncoined metals, particularly gold and silver, were used for trading as well. Patterns of elephants, horses, swastika and Dharmacakra were commonly imprinted on the coins of this period.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unknown}} what mental element is {{expected}} in cases of trespass to goods; while trespass to the person requires intent, the requirements for trespass to goods have never been tested in court. The common remedy is damages, which may be awarded regardless of if any actual harm is suffered; where there is damage, the defendant will only be liable {{if he could have}} reasonably foreseen it, as in Kuwait Airways Corporation v Iraqi Airways Co (No 5). Valid defences are those of statutory authority, consent, where it is necessary to interfere with the <b>goods,</b> <b>or</b> jus tertii.|$|E
5|$|Richard's {{government}} was formed around his uncles, most prominently {{the rich and}} powerful John of Gaunt, and many of his grandfather's former senior officials. They faced the challenge of financially sustaining the war in France. Taxes in the 14th century were raised on an ad hoc basis through Parliament, then comprising the Lords, the titled aristocracy and clergy; and the Commons, the representatives of the knights, merchants and senior gentry from across England. These taxes were typically imposed on a household's movable possessions, such as their <b>goods</b> <b>or</b> stock. The raising of these taxes affected the members of the Commons much more than the Lords. To complicate matters, the official statistics used to administer the taxes pre-dated the Black Death and, since the size and wealth of local communities had changed greatly since the plague, effective collection had become increasingly difficult.|$|E

5|$|The Sundanese author M.A.Salmoen classifies Joehana as a realist. Rosidi {{writes that}} {{a sense of}} realism was {{promoted}} in Joehana's writings {{through the use of}} references to existing (and often popular) brands of products, including cigars, salted fish, and biscuits (though, as Joehana wrote for persons in contemporary Bandung who were expected to know these products, they are not given any in-text explanation). Joehana used real-life Bandung locations in his novels, and local figures prominent in the news (such as the pickpocket Salim) are mentioned in passing. There is also the possibility that the use of such names are a form of product placement, in which Joehana was paid to include the names of the products in his novels; this payment may not have been direct, but in the form of <b>goods</b> <b>or</b> services, or a donation to Sarekat Rakyat.|$|E
5|$|With many 9th century Tang era merchants {{avoiding}} {{the weight and}} bulk of so many copper coins in each transaction, this led them to using trading receipts from deposit shops where <b>goods</b> <b>or</b> money were left previously. Merchants would deposit copper currency into the stores of wealthy families and prominent wholesalers, whereupon they would receive receipts that could be cashed {{in a number of}} nearby towns by accredited persons. Since the 10th century, the early Song government began issuing their own receipts of deposit, yet this was restricted mainly to their monopolized salt industry and trade. China's first official regional paper-printed money {{can be traced back to}} the year 1024, in Sichuan province.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the core}} {{economic}} functions, consumption, production, and investment, have become highly globalized in recent decades. While consumers increasingly import foreign <b>goods</b> <b>or</b> purchase domestic goods produced with foreign inputs, businesses continue to expand production internationally to meet an increasingly globalized consumption in the world economy. International financial integration among nations has afforded investors the opportunity to diversify their asset portfolios by investing abroad. Consumers, multinational corporations, individual and institutional investors, and financial intermediaries (such as banks) are the key economic actors within the global financial system. Central banks (such as the European Central Bank or the U.S. Federal Reserve System) undertake open market operations {{in their efforts to}} realize monetary policy goals. International financial institutions such as the Bretton Woods institutions, multilateral development banks and other development finance institutions provide emergency financing to countries in crisis, provide risk mitigation tools to prospective foreign investors, and assemble capital for development finance and poverty reduction initiatives. Trade organizations such as the World Trade Organization, Institute of International Finance, and the World Federation of Exchanges attempt to ease trade, facilitate trade disputes and address economic affairs, promote standards, and sponsor research and statistics publications.|$|E
