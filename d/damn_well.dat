A [...] "fire-eater with a marvellous flow of language", it was Cubitt's manner of speech, more than anything else, which made an impact on his contemporaries; a front-line officer in 1918 described watching him, during the October offensive, clearing a traffic jam with merely [...] "a magnificent gush of language". A colleague from his early days in the artillery described him as a [...] "perpetual joy to the soldier's world ... because of his picturesque language, which never gave offence because it was so absolutely natural and so aptly fitted the occasion", but under some circumstances it proved less suitable. Following a failed raid in 1918, he visited the offending battalion and harangued the officers collectively for some time, before demanding that they [...] "damn well had to do the raid over again, and <b>damn</b> <b>well</b> see that [...] made a proper job of it, or, by God, <b>damn</b> <b>well</b> go on raiding until [...] <b>damn</b> <b>well</b> did."

500|$|Historian H. M. Walbrook {{wrote in}} 1921 that Pinafore [...] "satirizes {{the type of}} {{nautical}} drama of which Douglas Jerrold's Black-Eyed Susan is a typical instance, and the 'God's Englishman' sort of patriotism which consists in shouting a platitude, striking an attitude, and doing {{little or nothing to}} help one's country". G. K. Chesterton agreed that the satire is pointed at the selfishness of [...] "being proud of yourself for being a citizen" [...] of one's country, which requires no virtuous effort of will to resist the [...] "temptations to belong to other nations" [...] but is merely an excuse for pride. In 2005, Australian opera director Stuart Maunder noted the juxtaposition of satire and nationalism in the opera, saying, [...] "they all sing 'He is an Englishman', and you know <b>damn</b> <b>well</b> they're sending it up, but the music is so military... that you can't help but be swept up in that whole jingoism that is the British Empire." [...] In addition, he argued that the song ties this theme into the main satire of class distinctions in the opera: [...] "H.M.S. Pinafore is basically a satire on... the British love of the class system.... f course [...] can marry [...] daughter, because he's British, and therefore he's great'". Jacobs notes that Gilbert is lampooning the tradition of nautical melodrama in which the sailor's [...] "patriotism guarantees his virtue".|$|E
500|$|Todd Gilchrist feels Sparrow is {{the only}} element of the films that will remain timeless. According to Sharon Eberson, the character's {{popularity}} {{can be attributed to}} his being a [...] "scoundrel whose occasional bouts of conscience allow viewers to go with the flaws because, as played to the larger-than-life hilt by Depp, he owns every scene he is in". Film history professor Jonathan Kuntz attributed Sparrow's popularity to the increased questioning of masculinity in the 21st century, and Sparrow's personality contrasts with action-adventure heroes in cinema. Leonard Maltin concurs that Sparrow has a carefree attitude and does not take himself seriously. Mark Fox noted Sparrow is an escapist fantasy figure for women, free from much of the responsibility of most heroes. Sparrow is listed by IGN as one of their ten favorite film outlaws, as he [...] "lives for himself and the freedom to do whatever it is that he <b>damn</b> <b>well</b> pleases. Precious few film characters have epitomized what makes the outlaw such a romantic figure for audiences as Captain Jack Sparrow has." [...] Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, [...] "best-of" [...] list, saying, [...] "Part Keith Richards rift, part sozzled lounge lizard, Johnny Depp's swizzleshtick pirate was definitely one of the most dazzling characters of the decade."
