5|$|On 26 July 1962 the Chapter General of the Holy Ghost Fathers elected Lefebvre as the Superior General. Lefebvre {{was widely}} {{respected}} for {{his experience in}} the mission field. On the other hand, certain progressive members of <b>his</b> <b>congregation,</b> particularly in France, considered his administrative style authoritarian and desired radical reforms. On 7 August 1962 Lefebvre was given the titular archiepiscopal see of Synnada in Phrygia.|$|E
5|$|Beecher {{enjoyed the}} company of women, and rumors of extramarital affairs {{circulated}} as early as his Indiana days, when he was believed to have {{had an affair with}} a young member of <b>his</b> <b>congregation.</b> In 1858, the Brooklyn Eagle wrote a story accusing him of an affair with another young church member who had later become a prostitute. The wife of Beecher's patron and editor, Henry Bowen, confessed on her deathbed to her husband of an affair with Beecher; Bowen concealed the incident during his lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Crane died on February 16, 1880, {{at the age}} of 60; Stephen {{was eight}} years old. Some 1,400people mourned Dr. Crane at his funeral, more than double the size of <b>his</b> <b>congregation.</b> After her husband's death, Mrs. Crane moved to Roseville, near Newark, leaving Stephen in the care of his older brother Edmund, with whom the young boy lived with cousins in Sussex County. He next lived with his brother William, a lawyer, in Port Jervis for several years.|$|E

50|$|Du Toit died on 25 May 1911 as {{a result}} of {{injuries}} sustained in August the previous year when the cart in which he was travelling overturned while he was journeying to Calvinia to visit one of <b>his</b> <b>congregations.</b>|$|R
5|$|Joseph {{was also}} {{unable to stop}} those who came to hear him speak from desecrating the Sabbath, and his Yiddish sermons had {{no impact on the}} younger generation. In addition, he had to contend with a number of obstacles: he had no {{administrative}} experience or training, local Orthodox rabbis (particularly Joshua Seigel) and Jews outside <b>his</b> <b>congregation</b> did not accept his authority, and non-Orthodox Jews and groups criticized him. These problems were exacerbated by a stroke suffered in 1895, which partially incapacitated him, followed by a relapse in 1900 which left him bedridden.|$|E
5|$|Gracie is {{questioned}} by Mulder and Scully about O'Connor {{because she is}} a former member of his church. The two agents discover that she is, in fact, O'Connor's daughter and was kicked out of <b>his</b> <b>congregation</b> and home when she became pregnant. The agents go back to O'Connor's church and Scully is attacked by O'Connor, who attempts to stick her head in a box of snakes. He is promptly arrested. Later, while in his cell, he is attacked by snakes in his cell, but is not killed. O'Connor later wakes up in the hospital and is visited by Gracie. O'Connor then takes Gracie and leaves the hospital. Reverend Mackey tells Mulder and Scully that Enoch O'Connor is the father of Gracie's child.|$|E
5|$|In November of {{that year}} the same group planted a bomb that blew out the front of Nussbaum's house, while {{he and his wife}} were {{sleeping}} there. Nussbaum blamed the bombings on local antisemitism and bigotry, but most of <b>his</b> <b>congregation</b> blamed it on Nussbaum's anti-segregationist activism. Though the congregation officially supported him, a number of members privately urged him to leave Beth Israel and find another pulpit. The synagogue's board of trustees voted to prohibit non-Jewish groups from using the synagogue's premises unless they had prior approval from the board; the intent was to put an end to the interracial meetings that Nussbaum held there.|$|E
40|$|Given {{the sheer}} volume of {{scholarship}} which has been devoted to examining Paul and <b>his</b> <b>congregations,</b> it is surprising that so little {{attention has been paid to}} what the texts portray as the apostle's main concern: not what <b>his</b> <b>congregations</b> were in any 'objective', historical sense, but what they were 'in Christ'. Building on this observation, my thesis may be stated as follows. Traditional Pauline studies, with their emphases either on the apostle's thought or on his congregations' historical situation, obscure the importance of the 'church in the work', a reality established in the text, structured to engender change, and made real rhetorically for readers. These, then, are some of the questions posed: What influence should an awareness of Paul's hortatory, theological image of <b>his</b> <b>congregations</b> have on our efforts to reconstruct them historically? May the well-known Pauline 'indicative-imperative' be taken as a rhetorical strategy? And: In what way does the text try to make its portrayal the definitive reality lived out by its readers?The focus of this thesis is on Paul's congregations as the letters indicated 'they should be', and on the linkage this vision in the letters provides between theology and history, author and reader...|$|R

5|$|The next morning, Maude informs Marge that Ned is missing, {{having been}} chased {{around by the}} boys {{throughout}} the night. Marge realizes that she may be partially responsible for his disappearance. Marge goes to Reverend Lovejoy for help, {{and the two of}} them track Ned to the zoo, where Japanese tourists think Homer is Mr. Sparkle. Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney have abandoned their pursuit, but now Ned is trapped in the baboon exhibit. While the Simpson family looks on, Reverend Lovejoy rescues Ned in the baboons' food cart. Now that he feels useful again, Reverend Lovejoy rediscovers his passion for his job, regaling <b>his</b> <b>congregation</b> with the tale of Ned's rescue.|$|E
5|$|Zwingli was a humanist and {{a scholar}} with many devoted friends and disciples. He communicated as easily with the {{ordinary}} people of <b>his</b> <b>congregation</b> as with rulers such as Philip of Hesse. His {{reputation as a}} stern, stolid reformer is counterbalanced {{by the fact that}} he had an excellent sense of humour and used satiric fables, spoofing, and puns in his writings. He was more conscious of social obligations than Luther and he genuinely believed that the masses would accept a government guided by God's word. He tirelessly promoted assistance to the poor, who he believed should be cared for by a truly Christian community.|$|E
5|$|Childe {{was born}} on 14 April 1892 in Sydney, New South Wales. He was the only {{surviving}} child of the Reverend Stephen Henry (1844–1923) and Harriet Eliza Childe (1853–1910), a middle-class couple of English descent. Stephen Childe was a second-generation Anglican priest, ordained into the Church of England in 1867 after gaining a BA from the University of Cambridge. Becoming a teacher, in 1871 he married Mary Ellen Latchford, together having five children. They moved to Australia in 1878. It was here that Mary died, and in 1886 Stephen married Harriet, an Englishwoman from a wealthy background who had moved to Australia as a child. Gordon Childe was raised alongside five half-siblings at his father's palatial country house, the Chalet Fontenelle, in the township of Wentworth Falls in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney. Reverend Childe worked as the minister for St. Thomas' Parish, but proved unpopular, arguing with <b>his</b> <b>congregation</b> and taking unscheduled holidays.|$|E
50|$|The Rev. Stiegemeyer served <b>his</b> <b>congregations</b> faithfully, serving {{churches in}} Ohio, West Virginia, and Illinois. In 1911, he {{accepted}} {{a call to}} St. John's Evangelical Lutheran Church in Champaign, Illinois. As part of his ministry, he was to serve {{the students at the}} University of Illinois.|$|R
50|$|Post retirement, in his {{new role}} as Parish Priest, he has been taking liturgical and {{classical}} music directly to <b>his</b> <b>congregations.</b> Placed in charge of training for the Revised Missal by Cardinal Oswald Gracias, he and his Team helped introduce it to the churches of Mumbai in 2011.|$|R
50|$|When {{the episcopal}} {{constitution}} of the church was abolished, <b>his</b> former <b>congregation</b> at Ringley tried to recover him. The contest between the two congregations was referred to the judgement of ministers, who decided that Angier should stay in his latest settlement. When the Presbyterian form of church government was established in Lancashire, he often acted as moderator of the classis, and attended the provincial assembly, and had ruling elders in <b>his</b> own <b>congregation.</b> <b>His</b> presbyterianism was moderate, and he incurred some blame for the breadth of his views as to church discipline.|$|R
5|$|The Church {{assigned}} Belcourt to Pembina, North Dakota as {{a missionary}} to the Chippewa and Métis of the Pembina River basin, a tributary to the Red River of the North. Upon arrival at Pembina, Belcourt constructed a small log cabin of 20 feet long by 30 feet wide, {{which was not}} large enough for all of <b>his</b> <b>congregation.</b> On August 14, 1848, the missionary baptised his first person in Pembina, and held a Holy Communion class consisting of 92 Native Americans. Needing more resources, Belcourt wrote to the Archbishop of Quebec for money for food and building supplies. He also asked for another Canadian priest well-versed in both French and the Chippewa language, as he noted there were more Métis than Chippewa in the Pembina area. Belcourt described the original territory of the Chippewa in the Pembina district as several hundred miles north to south, and east to west - {{much larger than the}} small reservation to which they were later assigned.|$|E

On returning to New York, he endeavored to establish a yeshiva based on the European model, but found little encouragement.|$|R

50|$|Scholars {{disagree}} about whether Father Divine, an African American, was {{a civil rights}} activist, but he certainly advocated some progressive changes to race relations. For example, because he believed that every human was accorded equal rights, he believed that all members of lynch mobs ought to be tried and convicted as murderers. Father Divine's anti-lynching campaigns resonated in the black ghettos where <b>his</b> <b>congregations</b> lived, and he got over a quarter million people to sign his anti-lynching proposals.|$|R
