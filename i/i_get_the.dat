25|$|Regarding {{comments}} he made {{suggesting that}} contracts for the mega-fight {{were close to}} being finalized, De La Hoya told BoxingScene.com on July 26, 2010: I think I said it because <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> question asked so many times that, obviously, I was fed up and tired of it and I just said like, yeah, yeah, it's gonna get made. So it was a quick answer that I should have obviously thought about. But, obviously, negotiations weren't going on. Nothing was going on.|$|E

It's kind of a {{hypnotic}} state that you reach after a while when you keep on playing it where words just evolve from it. So you take those words and just let them go whichever way they want...'Moonshadow'? Funny, that was in Spain, I went there alone, completely alone, {{to get away from}} a few things. And I was dancin' on the rocks there... right on the rocks where the waves were, like, blowin' and splashin'. Really, it was so fantastic. And the moon was bright, ya know, and I started dancin' and singin' and I sang that song and it stayed. It's just the kind of moment that you want to find when you're writin' songs.|$|E

500|$|On August 25, 2010, Mitchell {{signed a}} two-year deal worth $3.5 million per {{season with the}} Los Angeles Kings. He had {{interest}} from several other teams, including the Washington Capitals and San Jose Sharks. The Canucks were also offering a one-year contract between $1.8 and $2 million, but were not willing to match the Kings' deal. Mitchell expressed disappointment in leaving the Canucks, but stated he was [...] "looking forward to going to a team which, <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> feeling, is really passionate about having me there." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} {{consists of}} various computer beats and electronic effects. The song contains an ascending bridge {{incorporated into the}} chorus, which consists of the lines: [...] "If you're ready for me boy / You'd better push the button {{and let me know}} / Before <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> wrong idea and go." [...] Lyrically, the song is about a woman's sexual frustration of being unnoticed by a man. [...] Joe Macare of Stylus Magazine described Buena's delivery of the lyric [...] "my sexy ass" [...] as [...] "carefree", and noted that the lyrics adapt an [...] "idiosyncratic approach" [...] to the English language. Musically, [...] "Push the Button" [...] received comparisons to the sound of pop group ABBA.|$|E
500|$|I wanted {{somebody}} with a tremendous {{understanding of how to}} make a pop video, because my biggest challenge working with directors is that I am the director and I write the treatments and <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> fashion and I decide what it's about and it's very hard to find directors that will relinquish any sort of input from the artist. ... But Francis and I worked together. ... It was collaborative. He's a really pop video director and a filmmaker. He did I Am Legend and I'm a huge Will Smith fan, so I knew he could execute the video in a way that I could give him all my weirdest, most psychotic ideas ... But it would come across to and be relevant to the public.|$|E

500|$|As {{the debate}} continued, Thompson wrote, [...] "An {{industry}} {{that says a}} line cannot be drawn will be drawn and quartered." [...] He said of his campaign, [...] "I won't stop till <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> head of a record company or record chain in jail. Only then will they stop trafficking in obscenity". Bob Guccione, Jr., founder of Spin magazine, responded by calling Thompson [...] "a sort of latter-day Don Quixote, as equally at odds with his times as that mythical character was," [...] and argued that his campaign was achieving [...] "two things...: pissing everybody off and compounding his own celebrity". Thompson responded by noting, [...] "Law enforcement and I put 2 Live Crew's career back into the toilet where it began." ...|$|E
500|$|Marsh {{thought the}} problem with the album's {{narrative}} is that there isn't enough transitional material provided by the lyrics. There are no stage directions, no cast, and narration is restricted to key phrases (such as [...] "Tommy can you hear me?") Key problems included an unclear explanation of what Tommy didn't hear or see in [...] "1921", how or why he plays pinball, why [...] "Smash the Mirror" [...] leads into [...] "I overwhelm as I approach you" [...] (the opening line in [...] "Sensation"), why Tommy tells his followers in [...] "We're Not Gonna Take It" [...] they cannot drink or smoke but can play pinball, and what the [...] "you" [...] is in [...] "Listening to you, <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> music".|$|E
500|$|A {{child of}} the Jim Crow South, Stengel has {{sometimes}} {{been accused of being}} a racist, for example by Roy Campanella Jr., who stated that Stengel made racist remarks from the dugout during the World Series towards his father Roy Campanella, Jackie Robinson and other black stars of the Dodgers. Bak noted, though, that Stengel was a [...] "viscous and inventive" [...] bench jockey, hazing the other team with whatever might throw off their performance. Stengel had poor relations with Robinson; each disliked the other and was a vocal critic. One widely quoted Stengel comment was about catcher [...] Elston Howard, who became the first black Yankee in 1955, eight years after Robinson had broken the color barrier, [...] "they finally get me a nigger, <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> only one who can't run".|$|E

500|$|When he was twenty, the National Post {{described}} Raonic as a [...] "hothead whose on-court demeanour {{was holding}} him back." [...] As he grew older, commentators {{came to see}} him as [...] "stoic", [...] "robotic", and [...] "emotionless", with The Daily Telegraph referring to him as [...] "an analytical character who questions everything he does in practice". In 2014, Raonic explained: [...] "I'm the son of two engineers, so everything is a numbers and calculation game." [...] In 2016, he added: [...] "I am very systematic in how [...] need to go about things to bring out the best tennis for myself, and maybe that comes off as mechanical and robotic and those kind of things, but I don't know if I'd ever change that because I feel that's the way <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> best out of myself when it comes to my tennis." ...|$|E
500|$|Potter was an unsentimental naturalist {{who thought}} no {{creature}} either good or bad, {{and had no}} qualms describing earwigs in Mrs. Tittlemouse's passage or woodlice in her pantry. Her publisher Harold Warne however had different ideas about what was appropriate for a children's book. He had become accustomed to Potter's unusual choice of animal subjects through the years, but, ever sensitive to public reaction, thought she had gone a bit too far in Mrs. Tittlemouse with the earwig and the woodlice. [...] The earwig was, at his behest, transmogrified into a beetle and the woodlice into [...] "creepy-crawly people" [...] hiding in Mrs. Tittlemouse's plate rack. [...] "I can alter the text, when <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> proofs," [...] she wrote, [...] "and will erase the offensive word 'wood-lice'!" [...] Potter argued for the generic term [...] "slaters" [...] for the woodlice, but was overruled. It was decided that an illustration of a centipede (Miss Maggie Manylegs) would be withdrawn and replaced with a butterfly.|$|E
500|$|Taylor {{returned}} to baseball in 1995, {{and spent the}} season with the Rookie-level Gulf Coast Yankees. When he {{returned to}} the game, after surgery, he had lost 8mph off his fastball and was unable to throw a curveball for a strike. As a result, in his first season back, he had two wins, five losses, a 6.08 ERA, and 54 walks in 40 innings pitched. The Yankees planned to have Taylor spend the 1996 season with the Double-A Norwich Navigators, but he continued to struggle with his control in spring training, saying at one point, [...] "Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> ball across the plate, sometimes I feel like I've never held a ball in my life". He instead spent the year with the Single-A Greensboro Bats and walked 43 batters in 16.1 innings, going 05 with an 18.73 ERA in nine games; the Yankees removed him from their 40-man roster as a result.|$|E

500|$|American {{producers}} Christopher [...] "Tricky" [...] Stewart and Penelope Magnet, known {{collectively as}} RedZone Entertainment, presented Spears {{with the third}} song they had written and produced, [...] "Pop Culture Whore". While her management liked the track, she rejected it, telling them the song [...] "sucked". After bonding with Spears during a night in New York City to [...] "get in her world", as Magnet explained, {{it was easier to}} [...] "actually write and know what she would and wouldn't say, to know where her real vibe is". Stewart and Magnet began working on the first version of the song; Stewart came up with the track, while Magnet developed the melody on a piano and some of the lyrics. American producer The-Dream became involved after Stewart proposed him to work together on the track for Spears. He explained, [...] "I was just getting into the business. I'm in Atlanta, driving home in a '92 Cadillac, and <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> call [...] I hung up and just screamed out joyous sounds." [...] During the recording sessions, Stewart recalls that the studio's air-conditioning died for three days, but Spears [...] "didn't complain or anything, and for me that shows she's where she is for a reason." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Rhimes said she tried {{to talk him out}} of quitting, explaining: [...] "I looked in his face and he was really sure. It felt like the right thing for him." [...] However, in another interview, Knight said of his exit: [...] "My five-year experience proved to me that I could not trust any answer that was given [...]" [...] Knight was [...] "at peace" [...] with his departure, saying: [...] "There just comes a time when it's so clear that moving on is the best decision." [...] However, Heigl tried to talk Knight out of leaving, saying: [...] "I didn't think it was the right decision. I felt like some of the problems could be worked through. But by the time it came to fruition, I was [...] for him because he was ready to go." [...] On the topic of losing a US$14 million contract, Knight commented: [...] "From an outsider's perspective, <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> [...] 'He's just a spoiled actor, he doesn’t know how good he has it.' There are a lot of people who would like to be in my position. But in the end, I need to be fulfilled in my work." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{search for}} a new guitarist and drummer began with {{advertisements}} placed in copies of Melody Maker. The invitation was spotted by drummer Phil Collins, formerly of Flaming Youth who already knew Stratton-Smith. He recalled, [...] "My only knowledge of Genesis was through seeing the ads for their gigs. It seemed like they were constantly working. ... I thought 'At least I'm going to be working if <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> gig'." [...] Roger Taylor, subsequently of Queen, turned down an invitation to audition. Collins went to the audition at Gabriel's parents' house in Chobham, Surrey with his Flaming Youth band mate, guitarist Ronnie Caryl. As they arrived early, Collins took a swim in the pool and heard what the other drummers were playing. [...] "They put on 'Trespass', and my initial impression of a very soft and round music, not edgy, with vocal harmonies and I came away thinking Crosby, Stills and Nash". Gabriel and Rutherford noticed the confident way Collins approached and sat at his drum kit and knew he would be the right replacement. Banks said, [...] "It was a combination of things. He could make it swing a little bit ... he could also tell good jokes and make us laugh ... And he could sing, which was an advantage because Mike and I were not very good at back-up vocals". In August 1970, Collins became the new drummer for Genesis. Caryl's audition was unsuccessful; Rutherford thought he was not the player the group were looking for.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, Body Language touches upon themes like enjoyment, flirting, sex, and [...] "partying like it's 1987 {{all over}} again". In an {{interview}} with VH1, Minogue was asked why the lyrics on the album [...] "sound more personal than {{they might have been}} a few years ago", and she responded by saying [...] "Some of that could be just chance! I wrote lyrics that were intensely personal to me on an album a few years ago. Maybe people know me better now, and therefore, if a songwriter pitches me a song, they might tailor it [...] <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> lyrics of a tune and interpret them my way". Although the lyrics of [...] "Slow" [...] seem like an invitation to the dance floor, Minogue revealed that [...] "it's about how time and space have a different meaning when you meet someone [...] ". In [...] "Sweet Music", Minogue sings about the [...] "magic of the modern singer/producer partnership" [...] in lines like [...] "I think we're on to something/Your taste it mirrors mine/So hot and in the moment" [...] and [...] "Let's make this demo right". The song also makes use of double entendre in some lines. Similarly, [...] "Chocolate" [...] is [...] "packed with saccharine innuendo". [...] "Secret (Take You Home)" [...] contains various metaphors that compare flirting and sex to car racing. Ballads like [...] "Obsession" [...] deal with issues of loss and the ending of a relationship.|$|E
