"When I was a Souldier I, {{with others}} were drawn out {{to go to}} such a place to besiege it; But when I was just ready to go, {{one of the company}} desired to go in my room, to which, when I had consented, <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> place; and coming to the siege, as he stood Sentinel, he was shot into the head with a Musket bullet and died." ...|$|E
2500|$|Robinson {{walked a}} step ahead of us, but when he noticed me hurrying to catch up, he {{shortened}} his stride to accommodate mine. I kept reaching up for his hand, but he hadn't looked down and seemed unaware. Fannie called his attention to what I was doing, so he stopped short, bent low over me, his eyes wide and rows of brilliant teeth showing in a wide smile. When <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> hand in his, it felt large and cool. For a few moments, we continued walking in silence. [...] "Can I call you Uncle Billy?" [...] I asked. [...] "Why sure you can", he replied... "But then I get to call you darlin.'" [...] It was a deal. From then on, whenever we walked together it was hand in hand, and I was always his [...] "darlin.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|This thought grew less {{agreeable}} {{and more}} humiliating as he dwelt upon the possible consequences. [...] "Will Lambert remember me? Will <b>he</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> warning to heart?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I have heard. Will Pharaoh {{be pleased}} to declare whether with <b>my</b> royal {{heritage}} <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>my</b> life? If so, let it be here and now. My cousin Amenmeses wears a sword." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> bridle, and, {{leading the}} horse, {{began to walk}} rapidly towards the station.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> {{hand in a}} grasp {{cold and}} listless, and smiled from mirthless eyes.|$|E
60|$|So I {{called upon}} this man--Stiffelkind was his name--and <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> measure for a pair.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not well}} {{see how that}} can happen," [...] said Sir Edward with a smile, and who had not art enough to conceal his thoughts, [...] "unless <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>my</b> sister here." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>takes</b> <b>my</b> arm. [...] "You know I did not {{understand}} this," [...] he says. [...] "I did not really understand that when you said Utopia, you meant I was to meet her--in happiness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Bill,--see here! I can't take this!" [...] {{interrupted}} Thatcher hastily. [...] "You can't {{swear that}} <b>he's</b> <b>taken</b> <b>my</b> bag,--and--and,--blank it all,--this won't do, you know. I've {{no right to}} this man's things, even if--" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> hand fervently, {{raised it}} with warmth {{to his lips}} and kissed it twice over.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> {{hand and}} kissed it. He was like himself again, and I felt still more encouraged.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> hand, {{but as he}} did so {{he pushed}} me back into the shadow from which I had stepped to proffer it him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait {{a minute}} or two," [...] replied Lane. [...] "I'll catch this fellow. See him bite! <b>He's</b> cunning. <b>He's</b> <b>taken</b> <b>my</b> bait time and again, but I'll get him. There! See him run with the line. It's a big sunfish!" ...|$|R
6000|$|OF MAUPERTUIS, IN SUCCESSIVE PHASES.--... "Maupertuis {{is not of}} very {{engaging}} ways; <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>my</b> dimensions harshly {{with his}} quadrant: it is said there enters something of envy into his DATA. ...

60|$|When {{he found}} that Van Koop had gone away without saying good-bye, Lord Ragnall made no remark. Only <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> hand and shook it.|$|E
60|$|He {{had risen}} when I had brought myself {{to look at}} him. And as I hope for heaven <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> emotion for pity of himself.|$|E

60|$|He had {{hitherto}} concealed his feelings, but I {{saw them}} now {{begin to get}} the better of him. His eyes softened, and <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> hand and squeezed it hard.|$|E

6000|$|... "Doesn't he {{tell you}} that I offered to leave Dimchurch for ever? I meant it. I saw the misery in the poor fellow's face, when Grosse and I were leading Lucilla out of the room.
