2500|$|The airport {{designator}} [...] "SUX" [...] {{has been}} contentious. [...] Sioux City Mayor Craig Berenstein in 2002 described SUX as an [...] "embarrassment" [...] to the city. [...] After petitioning the FAA for a changed airport identifier in 1998 and 2002, authorities found the alternatives offered - GWU, GYO, GYT, SGV, and GAY - to be unappealing, and elected {{to stay with}} SUX. In October 2007, airport board member Dave Bernstein proposed embracing the identifier, saying [...] "Let's {{make the best of}} it. [...] I think we have the opportunity {{to turn it into a}} positive," [...] and noting [...] "I've got buddies that <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>college</b> with in different cities that can't even remember their own birthdays, but they all know the Sioux City designator — SUX." [...] The airport now sells merchandise with the words [...] "Fly SUX".|$|E

50|$|The {{question}} on students' minds {{should not be}} Will <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>college?,</b> but rather Which <b>college</b> will <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to?</b> Each Wednesday morning, students attend workshops that focus on various aspects of preparing for college. In the lower grades, students focus on personality and aptitude surveys and set up their collegeboard.com accounts. These lead to learning about various college majors and the careers to follow. Students {{then move on to}} standardized test strategies and a semester-long college admission essay class.|$|R

60|$|Not {{long after}} this event <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>college,</b> and studied medicine. My course was nearly {{completed}} when my dear father died. He had earnestly desired that I should enter the medical profession. I therefore resolved {{to finish my}} course, although, being left {{in possession of a}} small estate named Fagend, in Devonshire, and an ample income, it was not requisite that I should practise for a livelihood.|$|E

[...] "I've always done what pleased me at the moment--or because {{it was easier to}} do as others were doing. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>college</b> that way. Truth is, I {{never had any}} surplus vitality, and my father never demanded {{anything}} of me. I haven't any motives now. A few days ago I was interested in forestry. At this time it all seems futile. What's the use of my trying to live?" ...|$|E

I'd {{like to get}} a line on the National Forests there before <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>college.</b> The work will be different; those Western forests are all pine. I've a friend, Dick Leslie, a fellow I used to fish with, who went West and is now a fire ranger in the new National Forest in Arizona--Penetier is the name of it. He has written me several times to come out and spend a while with him in the woods." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I, too, had an {{adventure}} before I went to college; {{and there was}} no one to save me as Major Pendennis saved Pen. Pardon me, Miss Laura, if I tell this story before you. It is as well that you all of you should hear my confession. Before <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>college,</b> as a boy of eighteen, I was at a private tutor's, and there, like Arthur, I became attached, or fancied I was attached, to a woman of a much lower degree and a greater age than my own. You shrink from me----" ...|$|E
60|$|Until I {{went up to}} Oxford {{my father}} educated me, partly {{because he knew that}} he could do it better than anyone else, and partly to save school expenses. The {{experiment}} was very successful, as my love of all outdoor sports and of any small hazardous adventure that came to my hand, also of associating with fisherfolk whom the dangers of the deep make men among men, saved me from becoming a milksop. For the rest I learned more from my father, whom I always desired to please because I loved him, than I should have done at the best and most costly of schools. This was shown when at last <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>college</b> with a scholarship, for there I did very well indeed, as search would still reveal.|$|E
60|$|And {{there is}} a thing {{stranger}} than all that; for this homunculus or part-man of mine that walked about the eighteenth century with Dr. Balfour in his youth, was {{in the way of}} meeting other homunculi or part-men, in the persons of my other ancestors. These were of a lower order, and doubtless we looked down upon them duly. But as <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>college</b> with Dr. Balfour, I may have seen the lamp and oil man taking down the shutters from his shop beside the Tron;--we may have had a rabbit-hutch or a bookshelf made for us by a certain carpenter in I know not what wynd of the old smoky city; or, upon some holiday excursion, we may have looked into the windows of a cottage in a flower-garden and seen a certain weaver plying his shuttle. And these were all kinsmen of mine upon the other side; and from the eyes of the lamp and oil man one-half of my unborn father, and one-quarter of myself, looked out upon us as we went by to college. Nothing of all this would cross the mind of the young student, as he posted up the Bridges with trim, stockinged legs, in that city of cocked hats and good Scots still unadulterated. It would not cross his mind that he should have a daughter; and the lamp and oil man, just then beginning, by a not unnatural metastasis, to bloom into a lighthouse-engineer, should have a grandson; and that these two, in the fulness of time, should wed; and some portion of that student himself should survive yet a year or two longer in the person of their child.|$|E

50|$|The verbal {{expression}} used to expresses past {{states or}} past habitual actions, usually with {{the implication that}} {{they are no longer}} so. It is followed by the infinitive (that is, the full expression consists of the verb used plus the to-infinitive). Thus the statement <b>I</b> used <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>college</b> means that the speaker formerly habitually <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>college,</b> and normally implies that this is no longer the case.|$|R

60|$|Pompey and Caesar {{were of the}} party, {{though the}} latter did not join us until Pompey had taken me all round the town, to see the {{principal}} sights; it being understood that the Patroon had slept at Kingsbridge, {{and would not be}} likely to reach town until near noon. New York was certainly not the place, in 1751, it is to-day; nevertheless, it was a large and important town, even when <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>college,</b> containing not less than twelve thousand souls, blacks included. The Town Hall is a magnificent structure, standing at the head of Broad Street; and thither Pompey led me, even before my aunt had come down to breakfast. I could scarcely admire that fine edifice sufficiently; which, for size, architecture and position, has scarcely now an equal in all the colonies. It is true, that the town has much improved, within the last twenty years; but York was a noble place, even {{in the middle of this}} century! After breakfast, Pompey and I proceeded up Broadway, commencing near the fort, at the Bowling Green, and walking some distance beyond the head of Wall Street, or quite a quarter of a mile. Nor did the town stop here; though its principal extent is, or was then, along the margin of the East River. Trinity Church I could hardly admire enough either; for, it appeared to me, that it was large enough to contain all the church-people in the colony. [3] It was a venerable structure, which had then felt the heats of summer and the snows of winter on its roofs and walls, near half a century, and it still stands a monument of pious zeal and cultivated taste. There were other churches, belonging to other denominations, of course, that were well worthy of being seen; to say nothing of the markets. I thought I never should tire of gazing at the magnificence of the shops, particularly the silversmiths'; some of which must have had a thousand dollars' worth of plate in their windows, or otherwise in sight. I might say as much of the other shops, too, which attracted a just portion of my admiration.|$|E

5000|$|Schwartz {{says that}} the idea for Chuck {{originally}} came from Fedak: [...] "A guy named Chris Fedak, who <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>college</b> with, pitched me the initial concept. I {{thought there was a}} real opportunity there for a really funny show, while he was thinking thriller. We started talking back and forth and it evolved from there. We came up with something that's a fusion of both of our sensibilities—it's been a really fun collaboration".|$|E

5000|$|Greer Lankton {{was born}} in Flint, Michigan, to a Presbyterian {{minister}} and his wife. It was during her rough childhood as a feminine boy that she began creating dolls. [...] "It was when I was about ten years old ... I used to make dolls out of hollyhocks and all types of flowers. Pipecleaner dolls and things like that. I started taking it seriously by the time <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>college</b> when I was 17."

5000|$|While at Dartmouth in {{the late}} 1980s, Britton studied Chinese, {{including}} living for a summer in Beijing with future US Senator Kirsten Gillibrand.

But when <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>college,</b> I had to fulfill a language requirement and so I thought it would be really cool to do it speaking Chinese.

50|$|Growing up, Novella did {{not always}} want to be a physician. In an {{interview}} for the Books and Ideas podcast he said, I think I entertained various career ideas.

60|$|After luncheon we sat for two {{or three}} hours in one of the parlors, and talked, and talked, and talked. It was a sort of family congress.

When she passed away a couple of years ago, I received a financial gift from her estate. I chose to spend the inheritance on the tuition for my Master’s degree. I know that she would be proud of my decision. I would also like to dedicate this to my husband, Robbin, and my children, Seth and Sarah. I am very lucky to have an incredible family that has supported the decision to return to school and obtain my Master’s degree. I am very blessed to be a wife and mother to these three...|$|R
