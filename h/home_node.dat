30|$|In rendezvous-based {{protocols}} it {{is important}} to estimate how densely messages are concentrated on the rendezvous area. Hot region traffic cost is the average energy spent by a hot spot region node. In data-centric storage such as GHT, all messages are directed to several <b>home</b> <b>nodes.</b> To prevent <b>home</b> <b>nodes</b> from being exhausted due to heavy traffic, replicas of <b>home</b> <b>nodes</b> are chosen. This approach, however, increases the total energy consumption and the replication cost of <b>home</b> <b>nodes.</b> In Railroad, every query and event summary is sent to the Rail, which can be the bottleneck that limits the network lifetime. Also, in HexDD queries and data packets are forwarded toward border lines, which are becoming hot regions in the network. In this section, we analyze the hot region traffic cost of GHT, RailRoad, LBDD and our approach HexDD. In the following calculations, T is the amount of energy for a node to transmit a single bit, and R is the energy needed to receive a bit.|$|R

40|$|Finding {{efficient}} algorithms {{to explore}} large networks {{with the aim}} of recovering information about their structure is an open problem. Here, we investigate this challenge by proposing a model in which random walkers with previously assigned <b>home</b> <b>nodes</b> navigate through the network during a fixed amount of time. We consider that the exploration is successful if the walker gets the information gathered back home, otherwise, no data is retrieved. Consequently, at each time step, the walkers, with some probability, have the choice to either go backward approaching their home or go farther away. We show that there is an optimal solution to this problem in terms of the average information retrieved and the degree of the <b>home</b> <b>nodes</b> and design an adaptive strategy based on the behavior of the random walker. Finally, we compare different strategies that emerge from the model in the context of network reconstruction. Our results could be useful for the discovery of unknown connections in large scale networks. Comment: 10 pages, 10 figure...|$|R

50|$|In NUMA, each {{address in}} the global address space is {{typically}} assigned a fixed <b>home</b> <b>node.</b> When processors access some data, a copy is made in their local cache, but space remains allocated in the <b>home</b> <b>node.</b> Instead, with COMA, there is no home. An access from a remote node may cause that data to migrate. Compared to NUMA, this reduces the number of redundant copies and may allow more efficient use of the memory resources. On the other hand, it raises problems of {{how to find a}} particular data (there is no longer a <b>home</b> <b>node)</b> and what to do if a local memory fills up (migrating some data into the local memory then needs to evict some other data, which doesn't have a home to go to). Hardware memory coherence mechanisms are typically used to implement the migration.|$|E

40|$|A {{cost-effective}} distributed {{shared memory}} (DSM) system typically uses a limited directory protocol to enforce cache coherence. This paper presents {{a new family}} of protocols, called Limited directory with Region-based Broadcast (Limited-RB), to efficiently implement cache coherence in wormhole routed DSM systems. This protocol family uses multidestinationbased cache invalidation mechanisms to distribute invalidation requests to and collect the associated acknowledgments from separate regions. As a result, a write invalidation can be accomplished with fewer messages, less network traffic, and reduced occupancy at <b>home</b> <b>nodes.</b> These reductions contribute to decreasing invalidation latency and improving overall system performance. Directory organization under this new protocol is developed for 2 D systems with e-cube routing and evaluated through simulations {{for a set of}} applications. The results indicate that with a small directory storage, the Limited-RB protocol family can achieve supe [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Low-latency remote-write networks, such as DEC's Memory Channel, {{provide the}} {{possibility}} of transparent, inexpensive, large-scale shared-memory parallel computing on clusters of shared memory multiprocessors (SMPs). The challenge is {{to take advantage of}} hardwareshared memory for sharing within an SMP, and to ensure that software overhead is incurred only when actively sharing data across SMPs in the cluster. In this paper, we describe a "twolevel " software coherent shared memory system [...] -Cashmere- 2 L [...] - that meets this challenge. Cashmere- 2 L uses hardware to share memory within a node, while exploiting the Memory Channel's remote-write capabilities to implement "moderately lazy" release consistency with multiple concurrent writers, directories, <b>home</b> <b>nodes,</b> and page-size coherence blocks across nodes. Cashmere 2 L employs a novel coherence protocol that allows a high level of asynchrony by eliminating global directory locks and the need for TLB shootdown.

40|$|This {{document}} specifies Mobile IPv 6, {{a protocol}} that allows nodes to remain reachable while moving {{around in the}} IPv 6 Internet. Each mobile node is always identified by its home address, regardless of its current point of attachment to the Internet. While situated away from its <b>home,</b> a mobile <b>node</b> is also associated with a care-of address, which provides information about the mobile node’s current location. IPv 6 packets addressed to a mobile <b>node’s</b> <b>home</b> address are transparently routed to its care-of address. The protocol enables IPv 6 nodes to cache the binding of a mobile <b>node’s</b> <b>home</b> address with its care-of address, and to then send any packets destined for the mobile node directly to it at this care-of address. To support this operation, Mobile IPv 6 defines a new IPv 6 protocol and a new destination option. All IPv 6 nodes, whether mobile or stationary, can communicate with mobile nodes.
