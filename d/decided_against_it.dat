5|$|Ford seriously {{considered}} leaving the Senate and {{running for governor}} again in 1983 and 1991, but <b>decided</b> <b>against</b> <b>it</b> both times. In the 1983 contest, he would have faced sitting lieutenant governor Martha Layne Collins in the primary. Collins was a factional ally of Ford's, which influenced his decision.

For example, Iron Man sports his Extremis Armor, while Wolverine wears his costume from Astonishing X-Men.

5|$|Globocnik and I {{were talking}} about Operation Reinhard, which was in full effect {{following}} Heydrich's murder, and also the construction of Sobibor and Treblinka. I know I asked him about Höss, who was also standing there and had been summoned by Himmler regarding logistics or something regarding the new camp (Auschwitz). Then Globocnik mentioned to me and Kaltenbrunner that Lidice had been cleared, and all the Jews and Czechs had been dealt with. I noticed that this young pilot, who I later learned was Marseille, must have overheard, and I debated whether I should go over and say something to him. I <b>decided</b> <b>against</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the Steelers {{played the}} Philadelphia Eagles in a preseason game {{to commemorate the}} 60th anniversary of the Steagles team, when the two merged {{as a result of}} player {{shortages}} caused by World War II. Steelers president Dan Rooney had initially considered wearing a throwback uniform for the game, but <b>decided</b> <b>against</b> <b>it</b> because the merged team wore the Eagles uniforms, and the Steelers didn't want to wear the Eagles' colors. Instead, the team had the south end zone painted in plain diagonal white lines, which were common in NFL endzones until the 1960s.|$|E
50|$|Beachum {{is tempted}} by Nunally's scheme to plant false {{evidence}} to implicate Crawford but <b>decides</b> <b>against</b> <b>it</b> {{at the last}} minute.

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} film's release in late 1977, Spielberg desired to do either a sequel or prequel, before <b>deciding</b> <b>against</b> <b>it.</b> He explained, [...] "The army's {{knowledge}} and ensuing cover-up is so subterranean {{that it would}} take a creative screen story, perhaps someone else making the picture and giving it the equal time it deserves." ...|$|R

Nasser had considered dispatching troops to aid his Iraqi sympathizers, but <b>decided</b> <b>against</b> <b>it.</b> He clamped down on Egyptian communist activity due to the key backing Iraqi communists provided Qasim. Several influential communists were arrested, including Nasser's old comrade Khaled Mohieddin, who {{had been allowed to}} re-enter Egypt in 1956.|$|E
5|$|The team {{considered}} {{utilizing the}} PlayStation Move controller for casting spells in the game, {{in a similar}} fashion {{to the use of the}} touchscreen in the DS version, though ultimately <b>decided</b> <b>against</b> <b>it</b> as it would limit the potential sales. The battle system was revised over ten times, in order to achieve something new and unique. For about a year of development, the battle system used a turn-based system, though this was ultimately changed when the team felt that it was not fun for players. The team eventually merged turn-based combat and action elements, popular in Japanese and Western regions, respectively, in order to appeal to both regions.|$|E
