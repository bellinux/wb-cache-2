5|$|For {{the first}} six periods of the {{periodic}} table, the noble gases are exactly the members of group18 of the periodic table. Noble gases are typically highly unreactive except when under particular extreme conditions. The inertness of noble gases makes them very suitable in applications where reactions are not wanted. For example, argon is used in light bulbs to prevent the hot tungsten filament from oxidizing; also, helium is used in breathing gas by deep-sea divers to prevent oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide (<b>hypercapnia)</b> toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Secondary {{spontaneous}} pneumothoraces (SSPs), by definition, {{occur in}} individuals with significant underlying lung disease. Symptoms in SSPs {{tend to be}} more severe than in PSPs, as the unaffected lungs are generally unable to replace the loss of function in the affected lungs. Hypoxemia (decreased blood-oxygen levels) is usually present and may be observed as cyanosis (blue discoloration of the lips and skin). <b>Hypercapnia</b> (accumulation of carbon dioxide in the blood) is sometimes encountered; this may cause confusion and – if very severe – may result in comas. The sudden onset of breathlessness in someone with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, or other serious lung diseases should therefore prompt investigations to identify the possibility of a pneumothorax.|$|E
5|$|The blunted {{ventilatory}} {{response is}} attributed to several factors. Obese people tend to have raised levels of the hormone leptin, which is secreted by adipose tissue and under normal circumstances increases ventilation. In OHS, this effect is reduced. Furthermore, episodes of nighttime acidosis (e.g. due to sleep apnea) lead to compensation by the kidneys with retention of the alkali bicarbonate. This normalizes the acidity of the blood. However, bicarbonate stays around in the bloodstream for longer, and further episodes of <b>hypercapnia</b> lead to relatively mild acidosis and reduced ventilatory response in a vicious circle.|$|E
5|$|Khambatta also faced {{difficulties}} during filming. Due to the actress' personal objections, {{she would}} not appear nude as {{called for in the}} script during the Ilia probe's appearance. The producers got her to agree to wear a thin skin-colored body stocking, but she caught a cold {{as a result of the}} shower mist, created by dropping dry ice into warm water and funneling the vapors into the shower by a hidden tube. Khambatta had to leave the location repeatedly to avoid <b>hypercapnia.</b> One scene required the Ilia probe to slice through a steel door in the sickbay; doors made out of paper, corrugated cardboard covered in aluminum foil, and cork were tested before the proper effect was reached. The illuminated button in the hollow of the probe's throat was a 12–volt light bulb that Khambatta could turn on and off via hidden wires; the bulb's heat eventually caused a slight burn.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms {{and signs}} of early <b>hypercapnia</b> include flushed skin, full pulse, tachypnea, dyspnea, extrasystoles, muscle twitches, hand flaps, reduced neural activity, and {{possibly}} a raised blood pressure. According to other sources, symptoms of mild <b>hypercapnia</b> might include headache, confusion and lethargy. <b>Hypercapnia</b> can induce increased cardiac output, an elevation in arterial blood pressure, and a propensity toward arrhythmias. <b>Hypercapnia</b> may increase pulmonary capillary resistance. In severe <b>hypercapnia</b> (generally PaCO2 greater than 10 kPa or 75 mmHg), symptomatology progresses to disorientation, panic, hyperventilation, convulsions, unconsciousness, and eventually death.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hypercapnia</b> is {{generally}} {{defined as a}} blood gas carbon dioxide level over 45 mmHg. Since carbon dioxide is in equilibrium with carbonic acid in the blood, <b>hypercapnia</b> can drive serum pH down, resulting in a respiratory acidosis. Clinically, the effect of <b>hypercapnia</b> on pH is estimated using {{the ratio of the}} arterial pressure of carbon dioxide to the concentration of bicarbonate ion, PaCO2/.|$|E

25|$|Normal {{respiration}} in divers {{results in}} alveolar hypoventilation with inadequate carbon dioxide elimination (<b>hypercapnia).</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Hypercapnia</b> is {{generally}} caused by hypoventilation, lung disease, or diminished consciousness. It {{may also be}} caused by exposure to environments containing abnormally high concentrations of carbon dioxide, such as from volcanic or geothermal activity, or by rebreathing exhaled carbon dioxide. It can also be an initial effect of administering supplemental oxygen on a patient with sleep apnea. In this situation the <b>hypercapnia</b> can also be accompanied by respiratory acidosis.|$|E
25|$|This {{suggests}} that poisoning from hydrogen sulfide, anoxia, and <b>hypercapnia</b> acted {{together as a}} killing mechanism. <b>Hypercapnia</b> best explains the selectivity of the extinction, but anoxia and euxinia probably contributed to the high mortality of the event. The persistence of anoxia through the Early Triassic may explain the slow recovery of marine life after the extinction. Models also show that anoxic events can cause catastrophic hydrogen sulfide emissions into the atmosphere (see below).|$|E
25|$|This {{spread of}} toxic, oxygen-depleted water {{would have been}} devastating for marine life, {{producing}} widespread die-offs. Models of ocean chemistry show that anoxia and euxinia would have been closely associated with <b>hypercapnia</b> (high levels of carbon dioxide).|$|E
25|$|An {{analysis}} of marine fossils from the Permian's final Changhsingian stage found that marine organisms with low tolerance for <b>hypercapnia</b> (high concentration of carbon dioxide) had high extinction rates, while the most tolerant organisms had very slight losses.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hypercapnia,</b> {{also known}} as {{hypercarbia}} and CO2 retention, is a condition of abnormally elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the blood. Carbon dioxide is a gaseous product of the body's metabolism and is normally expelled through the lungs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hypercapnia</b> {{normally}} {{triggers a}} reflex which increases breathing {{and access to}} oxygen (O2), such as arousal and turning the head during sleep. A failure of this reflex can be fatal, for example as a contributory factor in sudden infant death syndrome.|$|E
25|$|The hypercapnic {{state is}} {{routinely}} used to calibrate blood-oxygen-level dependent functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (BOLD fMRI), a modality that is sensitive to changes in blood oxygenation. However, this calibration crucially relies on the assumption that <b>hypercapnia</b> has no effect on neuronal function, which is a matter of debate.|$|E
25|$|The ant faces many {{respiratory}} challenges due to {{its highly}} variable environment, which can cause increased desiccation, hypoxia, and <b>hypercapnia.</b> Hot, humid climates cause an increase in heart rate and respiration which increases energy and water loss. Hypoxia and <b>hypercapnia</b> can result from red imported fire ant colonies living in poorly ventilated thermoregulatory mounds and underground nests. Discontinuous gas exchange (DGE) may allow ants to survive the hypercapnic and hypoxic conditions frequently found in their burrows; it is ideal for adapting to these conditions because it allows the ants to increase the period of O2 intake and CO2 expulsion independently through spiracle manipulation. The invasion success of the red imported fire ant may possibly be related to its physiological tolerance to abiotic stress, being more heat tolerant and more adaptable to desiccation stress than S. richteri. This means that the ant is less vulnerable to heat and desiccation stress. Although S. richteri has higher water body content than the red imported fire ant, S. richteri was more vulnerable to desiccation stress. The lower sensitivity to desiccation {{is due to a}} lower water loss rate. Colonies living in unshaded and warmer sites tend to have a higher heat tolerance than those living in shaded and cooler sites.|$|E
25|$|The {{alternative}} concept, {{developed in}} {{roughly the same}} time frame was closed-circuit scuba. The body consumes and metabolises {{only a small fraction}} of inhaled oxygen—the situation is even more wasteful of oxygen when the breathing gas is compressed as it is in ambient pressure breathing systems underwater. The rebreather recycles the exhaled breathing gas, while constantly replenishing it from the supply so that the oxygen level does not get depleted. The apparatus also has to remove the exhaled carbon dioxide, as a buildup of CO2 levels would result in respiratory distress and <b>hypercapnia.</b>|$|E
25|$|The dilemma {{faced by}} C. anderseni {{is to avoid}} {{drowning}} without suffering anoxia or <b>hypercapnia,</b> and they show a remarkable ability {{to adapt to the}} extreme conditions in the mangrove and exploit a niche where the density of other ants is insignificant. By adapting to these hostile situations, mangrove ants have developed the ability to switch to anaerobic respiration. This was proven by the observed oxygen and carbon dioxide levels. Oxygen uptake in the nests eventually stopped, but the carbon dioxide production continued. This indicates high levels of anaerobic respiration.|$|E
25|$|The {{alternative}} concept, {{developed in}} {{roughly the same}} time frame was closed-circuit scuba. The body consumes and metabolises {{only a part of}} the oxygen in the inhaled air at the surface, and an even smaller fraction when the breathing gas is compressed as it is in ambient pressure systems underwater. A rebreather recycles the used breathing gas, while constantly replenishing it from the supply so that the oxygen level does not get dangerously depleted. The apparatus also has to remove the exhaled carbon dioxide, as a buildup of CO2 levels would result in respiratory distress due to <b>hypercapnia.</b>|$|E
25|$|The hyper-vigilance {{response}} {{can lead}} to the creation of endogenous stimuli that contribute to the perceived threat. A similar process may explain hallucinations, with slight variations, in which an evil presence is perceived by the subject to be attempting to suffocate them, either by pressing heavily on the chest or by strangulation. A neurological explanation hold that this results from a combination of the threat vigilance activation system and the muscle paralysis associated with sleep paralysis that removes voluntary control of breathing. Several features of REM breathing patterns exacerbate the feeling of suffocation. These include shallow rapid breathing, <b>hypercapnia,</b> and slight blockage of the airway, which is a symptom prevalent in sleep apnea patients.|$|E
25|$|Afferent {{signals are}} sensory {{neuronal}} signals that ascend to the brain. Afferent neurons significant in dyspnea arise {{from a large}} number of sources including the carotid bodies, medulla, lungs, and chest wall. Chemoreceptors in the carotid bodies and medulla supply information regarding the blood gas levels of O2, CO2 and H+. In the lungs, juxtacapillary (J) receptors are sensitive to pulmonary interstitial edema, while stretch receptors signal bronchoconstriction. Muscle spindles in the chest wall signal the stretch and tension of the respiratory muscles. Thus, poor ventilation leading to <b>hypercapnia,</b> left heart failure leading to interstitial edema (impairing gas exchange), asthma causing bronchoconstriction (limiting airflow) and muscle fatigue leading to ineffective respiratory muscle action could all contribute to a feeling of dyspnea.|$|E
25|$|Binge {{drinking}} {{is a more}} important factor rather than average alcohol intake, {{with regard to the}} severity of alcohol induced damage to the fetus. Alcohol has definite long-term adverse effects on the fetus, in particular impaired attentional skills and may lead to psychiatric disorders when the child grows up. Approximately one in five nonpregnant women binge-drinks and one in 25 pregnant women binge-drinks. Binge drinking during pregnancy is associated with fetal alcohol syndrome, alcohol-related birth defects as well as alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders. The affected children after birth can suffer mental retardation and problems with learning, memory, attention, problem solving and problems with mental health and social interactions. Deformities in facial features, skeletal and body organs as well as a smaller head circumference are also sometimes present in these children. Studies in sheep indicate that fetal neurotoxicity induced by alcohol may be due to acidaemia and <b>hypercapnia.</b> Binge drinking three or more times during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of stillbirth.|$|E
500|$|Obesity hypoventilation {{syndrome}} {{is defined as}} the combination of obesity (body mass index above 30kg/m2), hypoxemia (falling oxygen levels in blood) during sleep, and <b>hypercapnia</b> (increased blood carbon dioxide levels) during the day, resulting from hypoventilation (excessively slow or shallow breathing). The disease has been known since the 1950s, initially as [...] "Pickwickian syndrome" [...] in reference to a Dickensian character but currently under a more descriptive name.|$|E
500|$|The second {{variable}} {{is related to}} dive conditions and speculates an influence of CO2 on the lung filter. Raised levels of CO2 could decrease the lungs' filtration capacity and allow bubbles to pass to the arterial side of the circulation. Thus, diving situations associated with CO2 retention and <b>hypercapnia</b> {{would be associated with}} a higher risk of Type II DCS. This could explain why the following situations, which are all related to high levels of CO2, have been identified as contributing factors to DCS: ...|$|E
500|$|Neon, argon, krypton, and xenon are {{obtained}} from air {{in an air}} separation unit using the methods of liquefaction of gases and fractional distillation. Helium is sourced from natural gas fields which have high concentrations of helium in the natural gas, using cryogenic gas separation techniques, and radon is usually isolated from the radioactive decay of dissolved radium, thorium, or uranium compounds (since those compounds give off alpha particles). Noble gases have several important applications in industries such as lighting, welding, and space exploration. A helium-oxygen breathing gas is often used by deep-sea divers at depths of seawater over [...] to keep the diver from experiencing oxygen toxemia, the lethal effect of high-pressure oxygen, nitrogen narcosis, the distracting narcotic effect of the nitrogen in air beyond this partial-pressure threshold, and carbon dioxide poisoning (<b>hypercapnia),</b> the panic-inducing effect of excessive {{carbon dioxide in the}} bloodstream. After the risks caused by the flammability of hydrogen became apparent, it was replaced with helium in blimps and balloons.|$|E
500|$|Symptoms of DPB include chronic {{sinusitis}} (inflamed paranasal sinuses), wheezing, crackles (respiratory sounds made by obstructions such as phlegm and secretions in the lungs), dyspnea (shortness of breath), and a severe cough that yields {{large amounts of}} sputum (coughed-up phlegm). There may be pus in the sputum, and affected individuals may have fever. Typical signs of DPB progression include [...] (enlargement) of the bronchiolar passages and hypoxemia (low levels of oxygen in the blood). If DPB is left untreated, bronchiectasis will occur; it is characterized by dilation and thickening of {{the walls of the}} bronchioles, inflammatory damage to respiratory and terminal bronchioles, and pooling of mucus in the lungs. DPB is associated with progressive respiratory failure, <b>hypercapnia</b> (increased levels of carbon dioxide in the blood), and can eventually lead to pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the pulmonary vein and artery) and cor pulmonale (dilation of the right ventricle of the heart, or [...] "right heart failure").|$|E

2500|$|Normal {{respiration}} in divers {{results in}} alveolar hypoventilation resulting in inadequate CO2 elimination or <b>hypercapnia.</b> Lanphier's {{work at the}} US Navy Experimental Diving Unit answered the question, [...] "Why don't divers breathe enough?": ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Hypercapnia</b> is the {{opposite}} of hypocapnia, the state of having abnormally reduced levels of carbon dioxide in the blood. [...] The word is from the Greek hyper = [...] "above" [...] or [...] "too much" [...] and kapnos = [...] "smoke".|$|E
2500|$|Dry ice sublimates at , at Earth {{atmospheric}} pressures. This extreme cold {{makes the}} solid dangerous to handle without protection due to burns caused by freezing (frostbite). While generally not very toxic, the outgassing from {{it can cause}} <b>hypercapnia</b> [...] (abnormally elevated carbon dioxide levels in the blood) due to buildup in confined locations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{spelling}} hypercapnea is occasionally seen in published medical articles (44 {{results in}} a PubMed search in 2016), {{but it is not}} entered in major dictionaries and is not tied to any etymology that involves the [...] suffix. It is most likely a misspelling by writers who misapprehend that the word <b>hypercapnia</b> ends in the same suffix that apnea does.|$|E
2500|$|Note {{that the}} urge to breathe is {{triggered}} by rising carbon dioxide levels in the blood and not by the reduction of oxygen. [...] The body can actually detect low levels of oxygen {{but this is not}} normally perceptible prior to blackout. [...] Persistently elevated levels of carbon dioxide in the blood, <b>hypercapnia</b> (the opposite to hypocapnia), tend to desensitise the body to carbon dioxide, in which case the body may come to rely on the oxygen level in the blood to maintain respiratory drive. This is illustrated in the scenario of type II respiratory failure. However, in a normal healthy person there is no subjective awareness of low oxygen levels.|$|E
2500|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} to dry ice can cause severe skin damage through frostbite, and the fog produced may also hinder attempts {{to withdraw from}} contact in a safe manner. Because it sublimes into large quantities of carbon dioxide gas, which could pose a danger of <b>hypercapnia,</b> dry ice should only be exposed to open air in a well-ventilated environment. For this reason, dry ice is assigned the S-phrase [...] {{in the context of}} laboratory safety. Industrial dry ice may contain contaminants that make it unsafe for direct contact with foodstuffs. Tiny dry ice pellets used in dry ice blast cleaning do not contain oily residues.|$|E
2500|$|The {{breathing}} reflex in {{the human}} body is weakly related to the amount of oxygen in the blood but strongly related to the amount of carbon dioxide (see <b>Hypercapnia).</b> During apnea, the oxygen in the body is used by the cells, and excreted as carbon dioxide. [...] Thus, the level of oxygen in the blood decreases, and the level of carbon dioxide increases. Increasing carbon dioxide levels lead to a stronger and stronger breathing reflex, up to the breath-hold breakpoint, at which the person can no longer voluntarily hold his or her breath. This typically occurs at an arterial [...] partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 55mm Hg, but may differ significantly from individual to individual and can be increased through training.|$|E
2500|$|Hyperventilation depletes {{the blood}} of carbon dioxide (hypocapnia), which causes {{respiratory}} alkylosis (increased pH), and causes a leftward shift in the oxygen–hemoglobin dissociation curve. This results in a lower venous partial pressure of oxygen, which worsens hypoxia. A normally ventilated breath-hold usually breaks (from CO2) with over 90% saturation which is far from hypoxia. [...] Hypoxia produces a respiratory drive but {{not as strong as}} the hypercapnic respiratory drive. This has been studied in altitude medicine, where hypoxia occurs without <b>hypercapnia</b> due to the low ambient pressure. The balance between the hypercapnic and hypoxic respiratory drives has genetic variability and can be modified by hypoxic training. These variations imply that predictive risk cannot be reliably estimated, but pre-dive hyperventilation carries definite risks.|$|E
2500|$|The {{demand valve}} adds a little {{respiratory}} dead space to the airway, and there is added [...] due to hydrostatic pressure differences between {{the depth of the}} demand valve and the lungs, and due to cracking pressure and flow resistance in the demand valve. These factors make breathing from a demand valve more effort than normal breathing out of the water, and the additional work of breathing at depth due to increased density and viscosity of the compressed gas, make a slow deep breathing cycle more energy efficient and more effective at carbon dioxide elimination. The diver learns to breathe more slowly and deeply with practice, and this usually improves endurance on a given quantity of gas. Part of the skill is learning to relax under water, and part is to minimize effort by learning good buoyancy, trim, maneuvering and propulsion skills. The breathing rate should not be slowed down too much, or there is a risk of <b>hypercapnia</b> (carbon dioxide buildup).|$|E
