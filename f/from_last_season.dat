On 11 January, Arsenal played their next league game which was at home to Stoke. Arsenal won 3–0 with Sánchez being involved in all three goals, assisting Laurent Koscielny's header and scoring the two remaining goals to seal a comfortable victory.

25|$|The {{month of}} the December started early for Bengaluru FC as the club took on Shillong Lajong on 1 December 2013 at the Bangalore Football Stadium. Bengaluru FC {{eventually}} came out as the victors in the match after two early goals from captain Sunil Chhetri in the 7th and 34th minute (from a penalty) sealed a 2–1 win for the team. The victory pushed Bengaluru FC {{to the top of}} the I-League table to begin the month. Their second match of the month came away from home at the Duler Stadium. Bengaluru FC took on the reigning champions <b>from</b> <b>last</b> <b>season,</b> Churchill Brothers. Bengaluru FC took an early second half lead of 2–0 thanks to strikes from Sean Rooney and Sunil Chhetri. Churchill Brothers brought a goal back with a strike from Balwant Singh before Chhetri sealed the match for Bengaluru FC by scoring his second goal of the match as Bengaluru FC won 3–1. The team then continued their away form in Kolkata on 11 December 2013 when they defeated Mohammedan at the Salt Lake Stadium by a score of 3–2. After taking an early 21st-minute lead through Johnny Menyongar it was Josimar who scored the equalizer for Mohammedan in first-half stoppage time. Sunil Chhetri then restored the lead for Bengaluru FC in the 48th minute before Josimar once again equalized for Mohammedan in the 57th minute but in the 71st minute it was Sunil Chhetri who scored his second goal of the match and the eventual winner for the Bangalore side. However, the club then slipped to their third loss of the season in their next match against East Bengal - thus their second loss to East Bengal this season - at the Bangalore Football Stadium on 15 December 2013. Both goals for East Bengal were scored by James Moga and Chidi Edeh. It was in this match that Bengaluru FC managed to draw 8,216 fans into the Bangalore Football Stadium, the most the team has had till that point. Despite the loss though, Bengaluru FC still managed to end the month of December and the year 2013 with a victory on 21 December 2013 against Salgaocar at the Bangalore Football Stadium in which penalty goals from Sunil Chhetri and Robin Singh (his first of the season) sealed a 2–1 win for the team.|$|E
25|$|In the 2013 NBA draft on June 27, the Suns {{selected}} Ukrainian center Alex Len {{from the}} Maryland with their 5th pick and power forward Alex Oriakhi from the Missouri with their 57th pick. In addition, they traded their 30th pick to the Golden State Warriors for shooting guards Archie Goodwin from the Kentucky (who was selected one pick earlier) and Malcolm Lee {{on the same}} day. On July 2, 2013, the Suns agreed to a trade involving the Los Angeles Clippers and the Milwaukee Bucks, in which they gave up Jared Dudley to the Clippers and a 2014 second-round pick to the Bucks in exchange for point guard Eric Bledsoe and small forward Caron Butler, both of whom last played for the Clippers. The Suns also agreed to trade Luis Scola to the Indiana Pacers in exchange for Gerald Green, Miles Plumlee, and a 2014 top-14-protected first-round pick on July 27. The Suns later traded Butler to the Bucks for center Viacheslav Kravtsov and point guard Ish Smith on August 29. In addition, the Suns waived one of their biggest signings <b>from</b> <b>last</b> <b>season,</b> Michael Beasley, on September 3, 2013. Finally, before the 2013–14 NBA season began, the Suns traded center Marcin Gortat, along with guards Shannon Brown, Kendall Marshall (whom the team drafted a year earlier), and Malcolm Lee, to the Washington Wizards for veteran forward-center Emeka Okafor and a top-12-protected 2014 first-round draft pick. The Suns were predicted to have a league-worst 16-66 season. The Suns' season proved opposite. Phoenix began the season 16–10. Eric Bledsoe (a main reason to the early success) went down against the Los Angeles Clippers with a torn meniscus, which occurred when the Suns were 19–11 on the season. Bledsoe missed 33 games due to the injury and the Suns went 17–16 during his absence. Phoenix went over 0.500 during that period thanks to consistent play from Gerald Green, Markieff and Marcus Morris, Channing Frye and Miles Plumlee. This was being led by a breakout season by Goran Dragić, who led Phoenix to a 36–27 record while Bledsoe was out, which set Phoenix up for a strong playoff push, which nearly had Dragić {{on the brink of}} an All-Star selection. Phoenix was in a tight playoff race with the Memphis Grizzlies and Dallas Mavericks and coincidentally the three teams faced one another in the last week of the regular season. Before these teams faced off, Phoenix was sitting at 47–32 while Dallas and Memphis were both 48–32. Phoenix lost against both Memphis and Dallas and beat Sacramento Kings to finish the season 48–34, Dallas beat Phoenix and lost to Memphis to finish 49–33, and Memphis beat both Phoenix and Dallas to finish 50–32. This resulted in Memphis finishing with the 7th seed, Dallas finishing with the 8th seed and Phoenix finishing with the 9th seed. This was an upset for the Suns, who were making a push for the playoffs in a competitive Western Conference.|$|E

[...] Matt Mitovich of TV Guide stated that the premiere [...] "offer compelling twists … the foundation is laid for a pivotal penultimate season … it sends the mind reeling and uncorks infinite possibilities." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote that [...] "it's hard to name a series that is as engaging, surprising and flat-out gorgeous as Lost, or one in which every effort and penny expended seems to be put to shimmering good use. [...] This is an epic big-screen adventure done for the small screen—and done {{in a way that makes}} most big-screen versions pale in comparison." [...] Bianco also commended the characterizations, noting them as realistic and compelling. [...] Maureen Ryan of The Chicago Tribune praised the opening sequence, calling it [...] "really, really great … nerd-tastic for [...] hardcore Lost fan; it's full of shout-outs and callbacks to classic Lost moments and trivia." [...] She concluded that the premiere is [...] "quite good" [...] (three and a half out of four stars) with [...] "a lot to like", specifically the expanded screen time for Faraday; however, Ryan expressed difficulty in understanding the use of time (travel) in the show and felt that one to two more viewings were warranted for her to give a better review of that aspect. [...] Verne Gay of Newsday summed up that [...] "The season's premiere represents pig-in-the-python storytelling—there's so much to work through, so many details, stories, characters and time dimensions to attend to, that after a while this all starts to feel like a very full meal. [...] A bloated feeling may result." [...] Among other pieces of praise, Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle was impressed by the [...] "parallel plotting" [...] of the characters on and off the island in different times. [...] Despite deeming the premiere [...] "riveting" [...] and the script [...] "tantalizing as ever", Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe had a mixed response, for he worried that he would not be able to handle a season's worth of time travel, stating that [...] "I may be alone in this, and I hope I will be proven wrong, but I expected the solution to [...] "Lost" [...] to be more metaphysical, and more original, than simply people being unstuck in time." [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger deemed it [...] "really good, in terms of keeping the momentum <b>from</b> <b>last</b> <b>season</b> going, servicing the characters and their emotions, and providing an appropriate number of 'Whoa's per hour." [...] In a three out of four stars review, Thomas Connor of the Chicago Sun-Times stated that [...] "the time-travel training wheels are coming off—and the path thus far seems blissfully free of the usual stumbling blocks", due to the previous four seasons of [...] "baby steps" [...] that set up the science fiction driven fifth season. [...] Caryn Kunz of the Honolulu Advertiser said that [...] "This was a great episode to get back into every aspect of our favorite show: relationships, mythology, reunions/cameos, and enough whoa moments to keep me on the edge of my seat throughout." ...|$|E
