Before he reached 13, like many in the area, his life was {{disrupted}} by the Japanese invasion. The family relocated to a rubber estate in Ulu Langat, Selangor. Later, they moved to Singapore thinking, erroneously, that it would avoid Japanese occupation. When Singapore was threatened, the family moved once again, to India, leaving Yuson Loo behind as all able-bodied men were not allowed to leave.

The work also {{focuses on the}} negative impacts of being a single parent on recruitment and participation on the labour market. Changing family behaviour {{in recent years has}} led to an increase of <b>incomplete</b> <b>families.</b> Given {{that the vast majority of}} <b>incomplete</b> <b>families</b> are mothers living with at least one dependent child, this thesis focuses on single mothers. The thesis also deals with single mothers because of their problematic state on the labour market. Through three theoretical background papers, the thesis describes the causes and risks associated with being a single parent, assistance available to single mothers, both financial and non-financial, and tools for reconciling work and family life of single mothers. To analyse these topics, secondary data were used. The conclusion of this thesis focuses on current family and employment situation of single mothers and the possible forms of discrimination on the labour market. Data from performed qualitative research were primarily used. Generally, mothers may encounter problems in reconciling work and family life and the labour market discrimination for the reasons of sex and motherhood. For single mothers, this area [...] ...|$|R
40|$|To analyze <b>incomplete</b> <b>families,</b> the {{following}} statistical tests can be used: LRAT-a simple likelihood-based association test, TRANSMIT, SIBASSOC/STDT, and RCTDT. We compared these four tests, for the diallelic case, on simulated data sets. The comparisons {{focused on the}} power to detect linkage and association when different familial structures, resistance to population stratification, resistance to misclassification of the disease status of the healthy sib, {{and the effect of}} nonpaternity were considered. The simulations lead to {{the following}} conclusions. The type I errors of TRANSMIT, SIBASSOC/STDT, and RCTDT were not affected by population stratification. LRAT showed bias under strong population stratification. High nonpaternity rates can lead to inflated type I errors, highlighting the importance of identification of half sibs. Under different homogeneous models, the power of TRANSMIT was very similar to that of LRAT, and, similarly, no difference in power was observed between SIBASSOC/STDT and RCTDT. Under various recessive and additive models, TRANSMIT was slightly more powerful than SIBASSOC/STDT when monoparental families with one affected and one unaffected sib were analyzed. Under various dominant models, SIBASSOC/STDT was slightly more powerful than TRANSMIT. Misclassification of the disease status of healthy sibs, as well as the discarding of <b>incomplete</b> <b>families,</b> resulted in a consistent loss of power...|$|R

We conclude that replacement rates are high only in case of specific <b>family</b> types (<b>incomplete</b> <b>families</b> and families with children where women have lost the job), low skilled categories of the unemployed. Reservation wages are linked mainly to {{the economic and social}} status of the unemployed and seem to be raised by replacement rates of benefits only with the category of the unskilled.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{statistical}} methodology for making inferences about mutation rates from paternity casework. This takes {{account of a}} number of sources of potential bias, including hidden mutation, <b>incomplete</b> <b>family</b> triplets, uncertain paternity status and differing maternal and paternal mutation rates, while allowing a wide variety of mutation models. An object-oriented Bayesian network is used to facilitate computation of the likelihood function for the mutation parameters. This can process either full or summary genotypic information, both from complete putative father-mother-child triplets and from defective cases where only the child and one of its parents are observed. We use a dataset from paternity casework to illustrate the effects on inferences about mutation parameters of various types of biases and the mutation model assumed. In particular, we show that there can be relevant information in cases of unconfirmed paternity, and that excluding these, as has generally been done, can lead to biased conclusions...|$|E

The main criticism is that results are usually more or less consistent with the knowledge we have from maybe other models built on different premises.
