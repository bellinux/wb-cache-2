5|$|Biofuels are fuels {{derived from}} biomass {{conversion}}, {{as in the}} conversion of cellulose contained <b>in</b> <b>corn</b> stalks, switchgrass, and other biomass into cellulosic ethanol. This process is dependent upon microbial consortia that transform the cellulose into sugars, followed by the fermentation of the sugars into ethanol.

25|$|The wool {{industry}} {{took off in}} the 16th century, {{partly due to the}} river. The plague hit the town hard in 1611 and 1636.

The trade in cloth faced further problems during the English Civil War due to a Royalist proclamation that prohibited the sale of cloth to the Parliamentarian-controlled London.|$|E
25|$|The best {{method of}} {{prevention}} is to each food rich in B3. Generally, this involves the intake of a protein-rich diet. Foods that contain high concentrations of niacin in the free form include beans and organ meat, as well as enriched grain and cereal products. While niacin is present <b>in</b> <b>corn</b> and other grains, the bioavailability of the nutrient is much less {{than it is in}} protein-rich sources. Different methods of processing corn may result in a higher degree of bioavailability of the vitamin.|$|E
25|$|The first corn {{varieties}} {{grown in}} Illinois were those obtained from local Indians or varieties brought to Illinois from the New England states. After the Civil War, varieties were developed which were {{adapted to the}} state's soils and climate, such as Reid's Yellow Dent.

25|$|Early in {{its history}} Kentucky gained {{recognition}} for its excellent farming conditions. It {{was the site of}} the first commercial winery in the United States (started in present-day Jessamine County in 1799) and due to the high calcium content of the soil in the Bluegrass region quickly became a major horse breeding (and later racing) area. Today Kentucky ranks 5th nationally in goat farming, 8th in beef cattle production, and 14th <b>in</b> <b>corn</b> production. Kentucky has also been a long-standing major center of the tobacco industry – both as a center of business and tobacco farming.|$|E
25|$|Though {{only about}} 17% of Spain's {{cultivated}} land was irrigated, {{it was estimated}} to be the source of between 40–45% of the gross value of crop production and of 50% of the value of agricultural exports. More than half of the irrigated area was planted <b>in</b> <b>corn,</b> fruit trees, and vegetables. Other agricultural products that benefited from irrigation included grapes, cotton, sugar beets, potatoes, legumes, olive trees, mangos, strawberries, tomatoes, and fodder grasses. Depending {{on the nature of the}} crop, it was possible to harvest two successive crops in the same year on about 10% of the country's irrigated land.|$|E
