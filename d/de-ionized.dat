50|$|For {{small-scale}} production of hydrogen, water purifiers are installed to prevent formation of minerals {{on the surface}} of the electrodes and to remove organics and chlorine from utility water. First the water passes through a 20 micrometer interference (mesh or screen filter) filter to remove sand and dust particles, second, a charcoal filter (activated carbon) to remove organics and chlorine, third stage, a <b>de-ionizing</b> filter to remove metallic ions. A test can be done before and after the filter for proper functioning on barium, calcium, potassium, magnesium, sodium and silicon.|$|R
50|$|Water {{has been}} shown {{not to be a}} very {{reliable}} substance to store electric charge long term, so more reliable materials are used for capacitors in industrial applications. However water has the advantage of being self healing after a breakdown, and if the water is steadily circulated through a <b>de-ionizing</b> resin and filters, then the loss resistance and dielectric behavior can be stabilized. Thus, in certain unusual situations, such as the generation of extremely high voltage but very short pulses, a water capacitor may be a practical solution - such as in an experimental Xray pulser.|$|R

2500|$|Replacement water {{should be}} of the same source as the aquarium, whether it be reverse osmosis (RO), <b>de-ionized</b> (DI), {{distilled}} or from a municipal supply, {{in order to avoid}} drastic changes in water chemistry.

[...] However, large water changes are not advised under routine circumstances anyway, so this is really irrelevant. Municipal, or tap water, is not recommended for a marine aquarium as it often contains high levels of nitrates, phosphates, and silicates and other dissolved solids which fuel the growth of nuisance algaes, particularly diatoms, which appears as a rust colored powdery algae and grows in the overabundance of silicates present in all tap water. [...] Water filtered by a four-stage process including mechanical, carbon, reverse-osmosis, and de-ionizing components is recommended as this can provide the easiest route to absolutely pure water.

5000|$|Starting in 1951, he {{received}} generous {{support from the}} Research Corporation in New York, and moved to Hawaii. In the 1950s, he wanted to return to active studies {{but much of the}} field was already filled with very large and expensive instruments. Instead he turned to a field that was being largely ignored, that of medium frequency (hectometre) radio signals in the 0.5-3 MHz range, around the AM broadcast bands. However, signals with frequencies below 30 MHz are reflected by an ionized layer in the Earth's atmosphere called the ionosphere. In 1954, Reber moved to Tasmania, the southernmost state of Australia, where he worked with Bill Ellis at the University of Tasmania. There, on very cold, long, winter nights the ionosphere would, after many hours shielded from the sun's radiation by the bulk of the Earth, 'quieten' and <b>de-ionize,</b> allowing the longer radio waves into his antenna array. Reber described this as being a [...] "fortuitous situation". Tasmania also offered low levels of man-made radio noise, which permitted reception of the faint signals from outer space.|$|R

40|$|Hyaluronan-binding protein 1 (HABP 1) is a trimeric protein {{with high}} {{negative}} charges distributed asymmetrically along {{the faces of}} the molecule. Recently, we have reported that HABP 1 exhibits a high degree of structural flexibility, which can be perturbed by ions under in vitro conditions near physiological pH (Jha, B. K., Salunke, D. M., and Datta, K. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 27464 - 27472). Here, we report the effect of ionic strength and pH on thermodynamic stability of HABP 1. Trimeric HABP 1 was shown to unfold reversibly upon dissociation ruling out the possibility of existence of folded monomer. An increase in ionic concentration (0. 05 - 1 M) or decrease in pH (pH 8. 0 - pH 5. 0) induced an unusually high thermodynamic stability of HABP 1 as reflected in the gradual increase in transition midpoint temperature, enthalpy of transition, and conformational entropy. Our studies suggest that the presence of counter ions in the molecular environment of HABP 1 leads to dramatic reduction of the intramolecular electrostatic repulsion either by <b>de-ionizing</b> the charged amino acid residues or by direct binding leading to a more stable conformation. A regulation on cellular HA-HABP 1 interaction by changes in pH and ionic strength may exist, because the more stable conformation attained at higher ionic strength or at acidic pH showed maximum affinity toward HA as probed either in solid phase binding assay on HA-immobilized plates or an in-solution binding assay using intrinsic fluorescence of HABP 1...|$|R

50|$|Deionized water (DI water, DIW or <b>de-ionized</b> water), often {{synonymous with}} demineralized water / DM water, is water {{that has had}} almost all of its mineral ions removed, such as cations like sodium, calcium, iron, and copper, and anions such as {{chloride}} and sulfate. Deionization is a chemical process that uses specially manufactured ion-exchange resins, which exchange hydrogen and hydroxide ions for dissolved minerals, and then recombine to form water. Because most non-particulate water impurities are dissolved salts, deionization produces highly pure water that is generally similar to distilled water, with the advantage that the process is quicker and does not build up scale. However, deionization does not significantly remove uncharged organic molecules, viruses or bacteria, except by incidental trapping in the resin. Specially made strong base anion resins can remove Gram-negative bacteria. Deionization can be done continuously and inexpensively using electrodeionization.|$|E
