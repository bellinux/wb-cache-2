5|$|A five-part series {{published}} between August and December 1995, {{it marks}} the first appearance of She-Venom after the symbiote bonds with Brock's wife Ann to save her from gunshot wounds. It also features the debut of a new Sin-Eater, Michael Engelschwert, following the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original. The story concludes the plotline begun in Venom: Carnage Unleashed with Kirstin's mother, a skilled assassin, trying to kill Venom and killing the Sin-Eater.|$|E
5|$|A naval {{board of}} inquiry was {{appointed}} shortly afterwards that determined {{the cause of}} the collision was of a lack of seamanship by the captain and watch officers of the ship. The Justice Minister, Kobie Coetsee, subsequently introduced a retrospective change in law to allow him to hold an inquest into the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> only crewman whose body was found. The inquest lasted a year and apportioned blame on the captain and PWO.|$|E
5|$|A {{plot against}} {{his life was}} revealed, {{and one of his}} officers, Philotas, was {{executed}} for failing to alert Alexander. The <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> son necessitated the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> father, and thus Parmenion, who had been charged with guarding the treasury at Ecbatana, was assassinated at Alexander's command, to prevent attempts at vengeance. Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus, Cleitus the Black, during a violent drunken altercation at Maracanda (modern day Samarkand in Uzbekistan), in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgmental mistakes and most especially, of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle.|$|E

5|$|Another {{issue is}} why France2, the Associated Press and Reuters did not film the scene {{directly}} after the shooting, including the shooting <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ambulance driver who arrived {{to pick up}} Jamal and Muhammad.

5|$|Belton House {{remained}} relatively untouched during this period, largely {{owing to the}} failing fortunes of the Brownlow family. The 3rd Earl Brownlow and his Countess lived {{for only a few}} months of the year at Belton, where they came for the fox-hunting, and divided the remainder of their time between their house in London and Ashridge, another country house in Hertfordshire. Ashridge, a huge Gothic revival pile, had come to the Brownlows in the 19th century through the Egerton family. It was sold, with its art collection and furnishings, to pay the death duties arising on the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 3rd Earl in 1921. Hence Belton became the Brownlows' sole country home. Further death duties were incurred in 1927 on the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 3rd Earl's successor, his second cousin Adelbert Cust, 5th Baron Brownlow.|$|E

5|$|From {{the start}} of the liturgical year on the first Sunday in Advent, Bach {{composed}} prolifically.

When Bach's hope to become Drese's successor was not realized, he ceased to compose cantatas for the Weimar court.|$|E
