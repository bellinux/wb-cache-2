Because {{it can only}} be scratched by other diamonds, it maintains its polish <b>extremely</b> <b>well.</b> Unlike many other gems, it is well-suited to daily wear because of its resistance to scratching—perhaps contributing to its popularity as the preferred gem in engagement or wedding rings, which are often worn every day.|$|E

5|$|Cicadas use {{a variety}} of {{strategies}} to evade predators. Large cicadas can fly rapidly to escape if disturbed. Many are <b>extremely</b> <b>well</b> camouflaged to evade predators such as birds that hunt by sight. As well as being coloured like tree bark, they are disruptively patterned to break up their outlines; their partly transparent wings are held over the body and pressed close to the substrate. The wings are antireflective, avoiding the typical shine of insect cuticle, which would break the cicada's camouflage. Some cicada species play dead when threatened.|$|E
5|$|Dinheirosaurus is not <b>extremely</b> <b>well</b> known, {{and as a}} consequence, its phylogenetic {{position}} is not certain. In 2012 during a redescription of the taxon by Philip Mannion et al., it was recovered, in both cladograms, to be sister species to Supersaurus vivianae and together forming the most basal diplodocines. A 2012 cladogram, published by Mannion et al. and using a modified matrix of Whitlock (2011) found that Dinheirosaurus was more primitive than Torneria and more derived than Apatosaurus. However, a cladogram from 2014 found that their group was supported, but in fact more primitive than Apatosaurus, and therefore outside Diplodocinae.|$|E
5|$|Further, young giraffes {{are much}} more {{vulnerable}} to predation than adults: between 60% and 75% of calves die within a year. Mothers hide their calves, which spend {{much of the time}} lying down in cover. Since the presence of a mother does not affect survival, Mitchell suggests that young giraffes must be <b>extremely</b> <b>well</b> camouflaged. This is supported by the fact that coat markings are strongly inherited. Conversely, far from hiding, adult giraffes move about to gain the best view of an approaching predator, relying on their size and ability to defend themselves even from lions.|$|E

5|$|Musidora was <b>extremely</b> <b>well</b> {{received}} {{when first}} exhibited, and {{considered one of}} the finest works by an English artist. Etty died in 1849 and his work rapidly went out of fashion. At the same time, the topic of Musidora itself became a cliche, and from the 1870s Thomson's writings faded into obscurity. Etty's Musidora is likely to have influenced The Knight Errant by John Everett Millais, but other than that has had little influence on subsequent works. The Tate's version of the painting was exhibited in major exhibitions in 2001–02 in London and in 2011–12 in York.|$|E

5|$|A new viticultural area {{along the}} Snake River was {{established}} on April 9, 2007. Principally located in Idaho, the area also encompasses two large counties in Eastern Oregon, Baker County and Malheur County.
