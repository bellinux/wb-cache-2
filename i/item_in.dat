5|$|An {{anonymous}} {{review of}} Srigala <b>Item</b> <b>in</b> the Surabaya-based daily Soerabaijasch Handelsblad was positive, predicting the film {{would be a}} commercial success. This prediction was fulfilled, as Srigala Item reached extensive audiences– mostly lower-class natives. The Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran credits this success to escapism. He writes that the film's theme of an oppressed, financially destitute youth {{who is able to}} control his destiny by becoming a masked vigilante, allowed viewers {{to be able to see}} themselves as the Black Wolf, and thus take revenge against those who had wronged them.|$|E

Thus, about 30% of the data can be expected to have 1 as first digit, 18% start with 2, etc. Auditors examine deviations from Benford's law to detect fraudulent accounting.|$|E
5|$|Bog turtles are {{omnivorous}} and eat {{aquatic plants}} (such as duckweed), seeds, berries, earthworms, snails, slugs, insects, other invertebrates, frogs, {{and other small}} vertebrates.

5|$|Few {{vocabulary}} {{items are}} considered unique to Ottawa. The influx of speakers of other Ojibwe dialects into the Ottawa area {{has resulted in}} mixing of dialects that were historically distinct. Given that vocabulary spreads readily from one dialect to another {{the presence of a}} particular vocabulary <b>item</b> <b>in</b> a given dialect is not a guarantee of the original source of the item. Two groups of function words are characteristically Ottawa: the sets of demonstrative pronouns and interrogative adverbs are both distinctive relative to other dialects of Ojibwe. Although some of the vocabulary items in each set are found in other dialects, taken as a group each is uniquely Ottawa.|$|E
5|$|Freedom fries was a {{political}} euphemism for French fries in the United States.

Although originally supported with several restaurants changing their menus as well, the term fell out of use due to declining support for the Iraq War.

5|$|More recently, {{research}} at the Duke Lemur Center {{has shown that the}} ring-tailed lemur can organize sequences in memory and retrieve ordered sequences without language. The experimental design demonstrated that the lemurs were using internal representation of the sequence to guide their responses and not simply following a trained sequence, where one <b>item</b> <b>in</b> the sequence cues the selection of the next. But this is not the limit of the ring-tailed lemur's reasoning skills. Another study, performed at the Myakka City Lemur Reserve, suggests that this species along with several other closely related lemur species understand simple arithmetic operations.|$|E
5|$|Murder on the Orient Express, as {{with its}} predecessor, {{features}} an inventory system. There are several {{components of the}} inventory, including a fingerprint examination screen, a scrapbook, and a passport screen for managing and viewing the passengers' passports. There are a total of eighty slots for carrying items in the inventory, spread across five separate screens. Items cannot be discarded from the inventory once they have been acquired. The player can access the inventory by clicking on an icon on the game's interface, or can simply right-click. After items are used, a right-click returns them to the inventory, and the exact slot they were originally placed in. Each item is labelled, and the player can inspect each inventory <b>item</b> <b>in</b> more detail by dragging it over a magnifying glass icon, and can also listen for a soft hissing sound which indicates {{that there is something}} relevant for the player to note about a certain <b>item.</b> <b>In</b> a divergence from other games in its genre, Murder on the Orient Express does not allow the player to combine items in the main inventory screen. There is a separate interface for item combinations, and the player must drag items into this screen if they wish to try to combine them.|$|E
5|$|Nuthatches are omnivorous, eating mostly insects, {{nuts and}} seeds. They forage for insects hidden in or under bark by {{climbing}} along tree trunks and branches, sometimes upside-down.

Their habit of wedging a large food <b>item</b> <b>in</b> a crevice and then hacking at it with their strong bills gives this group its English name.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} new t^atonnement process called a {{double-track}} auction for efficiently allocating multiple heterogeneous indivisible <b>items</b> <b>in</b> two distinct sets S 1 and S 2 to many buyers who view <b>items</b> <b>in</b> {{the same set}} as substitutes but items across the two sets as complements. The auctioneer initially announces sufficiently low prices for <b>items</b> <b>in</b> one set, say S 1, but sufficiently high prices for <b>items</b> <b>in</b> the other set S 2. In each round, the buyers respond by reporting their demands at the current prices and the auctioneer adjusts prices upwards for <b>items</b> <b>in</b> S 1 but downwards for <b>items</b> <b>in</b> S 2 based on buyers' reported demands until the market is clear. Unlike any existing auction, this auction {{is a blend of}} a multi-item ascending auction and a multi-item descending auction. We prove that the auction finds an efficient allocation and its market-clearing prices in finitely many rounds. Based on the auction we also establish a dynamic, efficient and strategy-proof mechanism.
