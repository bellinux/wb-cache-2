As they try to decide how to deal with their hostage, they learn that Hardenberg was a radical himself during the 1960s.

5|$|Morikawa Kaichirō {{identifies}} the subculture as distinctly Japanese, {{a product of}} the school system and society. Japanese schools have a class structure which functions as a caste system, but clubs are an exception to the social hierarchy. In these clubs, a student's interests will be recognized and nurtured, catering to the interests of otaku. Secondly, the vertical structure of Japanese society {{identifies the}} value of individuals by their success. Until the late 1980s, unathletic and unattractive males focused on academics, hoping to secure a <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>and</b> marry to raise their social standing. Those unable to succeed socially focused instead on their interests, often into adulthood, with their lifestyle centering on those interests, furthering the creation of the otaku subculture.|$|E

The film was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won three, including Cagney's for Best Actor. In his acceptance speech, Cagney said, [...] "I've always maintained that in this business, you're {{only as good as the}} other fellow thinks you are.

[...] Bringing the plants to the SGC at all was regarded irritating, as the [...] "obvious move [...] doesn't make for such good drama."

500|$|The Blackstone was {{managed by}} Harry J. Powers, a Chicago {{businessman}} with {{extensive experience in}} the theatre: [...] he had {{worked his way up}} from his early days as an usher to ultimately become one of Mr. Erlanger's most trusted associated; Powers remained as the Blackstone's manager throughout its first two decades. [...] The Blackstone's first productions featured some of that era's best known performers and playwrights—for example, after [...] "U.S. Minister Bedloe" [...] came a David Belasco production, [...] "The Return of Peter Grimm", starring David Warfield. [...] Many of the productions had already been well received in New York before coming to the Blackstone, such as another play that featured comic actor William H. Crane, [...] "The Senator Keeps House." [...] But while some of these productions were the equal of the version that played in New York, Tribune theatre critic Hammond observed on several occasions that the Chicago companies lacked the biggest stars. Despite this, the touring companies that performed at the Blackstone tended to do a <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>and</b> Hammond praised them for their [...] "effective" [...] productions. This trend of presenting touring company versions would continue in later years, when most of the performances at the Blackstone were plays which had already won the Pulitzer Prize or the Tony Award, and were presented by touring companies from New York.|$|E

500|$|Weinberg rose {{to success}} as the drummer for Springsteen's E Street Band, as his {{powerful}} yet controlled beat solved the E Street Band's drumming instabilities. On Born to Run (1975), Weinberg's drumming evoked {{two of his}} idols, Ringo Starr and Levon Helm, and he covered his snare drum with heavy paper towels to capture some of the Memphis soul sound. While travelling on tour, Weinberg became known for his exact requests, such as specifying the particular brand of paper towels to use for his drums or the standards for his hotel rooms. Weinberg never adopted the [...] "rock and roll lifestyle"; he treated his music seriously and kept to the mantra, [...] "Show up, do a <b>good</b> <b>job,</b> <b>and</b> give them more than their money's worth." [...] One compromise Weinberg did have to make was sometimes playing on the High Holy Days. During shows, Springsteen built up the personas of his bandmates, and Weinberg was frequently referred to as [...] "the Mighty Max". Weinberg started a long practice of keeping his eyes on Springsteen every moment during the show, even when Springsteen was behind the stage, as he never knew when Springsteen would change a tempo or suddenly deviate from the set list. Decades later, E Street guitarist Steve Van Zandt would say of Weinberg, [...] "What nobody understands is {{that not only is}} Max a great drummer, Max reads Bruce's mind. You can't learn that." [...] Weinberg bought a house overlooking the water in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, triggering a lifelong interest in real estate and home design.|$|E

Metcalfe believed that it was easy for Mercedes to lie; [...] "hence why she does it so much and so well!" [...] Mercedes felt that she had to lie, and found it easy to cry if she needed to, [...] "especially if it will benefit her". Metcalfe was unsure whether the audience would start to hate her character because she believed that Mercedes was not hateful. She stated, [...] "I hope I've done a <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>and</b> people still feel sorry for her". She said that [...] "the viewers have still been feeling some sympathy for Mercedes. I was getting lots of tweets saying, 'I feel so sorry for Mercedes, she needs to get back with Riley' and 'Mitzeee is being a bitch'". Metcalfe said that she was surprised by the fans' strong reaction. Hollyoaks executive producer Emma Smithwick also said that Mercedes [...] "gets away with blue murder [...] and yet there's so much love for that character". Smithwick told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that Mercedes would get her comeuppance for framing Mitzeee, saying: [...] "there most definitely will be a comeuppance. With the stabbing, she did it so coolly and lied about it so easily - that can't last forever". Smithwick explained that Mercedes is [...] "driven by her insecurities. She thinks she loves Riley and will do what it takes to win him. That's what it's about...winning. Mitzeee crossed her - she is dispensable but Riley...well, Riley is the prize.

[...] After retiring from coaching, Spurrier further reflected on his NFL stint in several interviews. In a 2016 appearance on the Paul Finebaum Show, Spurrier reflected that the Redskins might not have been the best choice for his jump to the NFL.

However, on April 18, 2006, Keller {{was released from the}} team in what many viewed as a [...] "cheap shot" [...] from Finch. He was replaced by Mike Wallace. Keller would then try to race the No. 34 Frank Cicci Racing Chevy at Richmond, but he did not qualify and declined further rides with the team. Instead, Brewco Motorsports hired Keller to qualify and practice Greg Biffle's No. 66 Ford for select races when Biffle was working on his Nextel Cup Series team.
