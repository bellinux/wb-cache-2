50|$|Apron : This is {{a wooden}} <b>fascia</b> <b>board</b> {{used to cover}} up {{trimmers}} and joists exposed by stairwell openings. The apron may be moulded or plain, and is intended to give the staircase a cleaner look by cloaking the side view.|$|E
50|$|In an open cornice, {{the shape}} of the cornice {{is similar to that of}} a wide box cornice except that both the lookouts and the soffit are absent. It is a lower-cost {{treatment}} that requires fewer materials, and may even have no <b>fascia</b> <b>board,</b> but lacks the finished appearance of a box cornice.|$|E
50|$|Falkland {{houses are}} renowned for being brightly painted with immaculately {{maintained}} gardens, older houses frequently have intricately carved wooden <b>fascia</b> <b>boards.</b>|$|R
50|$|Rhydypennau Library (Llyfrgell Rhydypennau) is {{situated}} near Cardiff High School. Refurbished in 2006-2007, {{modifications to the}} entrance included installing automatic doors and replacing existing ramps. New windows were also fitted and <b>fascia</b> <b>boards</b> were replaced. Accessible facilities for disabled people were introduced.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ticket hall}} was rebuilt {{in the early}} 1980s along with changes to the roofs on the platforms. The island platform's wooden roof was {{replaced}} with steel sheeting on the existing frames whilst the side platforms were left unaltered other than the removal of their [...] "dog-tooth" [...] <b>fascia</b> <b>boards.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} was updated {{to move with}} the times. There was now an all-anti-dazzle-black interior (including black instrument dial bezels instead of the previous chrome versions). The padded <b>fascia</b> <b>board</b> had crash pads {{at the top and}} bottom, and improvements were made with the ventilation by fitting directionally variable ventilator jets, as used by Ford.|$|E
50|$|The Art Deco Men's Toilet Block {{is a small}} masonry T-shaped {{building}} with a stepped parapet concealing gabled roofs clad in corrugated pre- painted metal sheeting. It is constructed of mid-brown face brick on a concrete base and with painted cement rendered banding at shoulder height extending across the parapet at the front and continuous around the building to the <b>fascia</b> <b>board.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} {{still looks}} much as when built. Sitting on {{a foundation of}} limestone blocks, it is a two story frame structure with symmetric openings, small corner pilasters, <b>fascia</b> <b>board</b> beneath the eaves, and a raking cornice - all characteristic of the Greek Revival style. At the attic level below the peak is a small window {{in the shape of}} a Gothic trefoil. On top is an open belfry topped with a weather vane.|$|E
50|$|A lookout, lookout rafter or roof outlooker is {{a wooden}} joist that extends in {{cantilever}} {{out from the}} exterior wall (or wall plate) of a building, supporting the roof sheathing and providing a nailing surface for the <b>fascia</b> <b>boards.</b> When not exposed it serves to fasten the finish materials of the eaves.|$|R
50|$|District No. 48 School is {{a simple}} wood-frame {{building}} with clapboard siding. It has a rectangular footprint with a small vestibule at the main entrance topped with a little belfry. Sited on a hill, the building consists of one story over a walk-out basement. Ornamentation is limited to Doric pilasters, <b>fascia</b> <b>boards,</b> and flared window jambs.|$|R
50|$|In 1889, the Adam & Eve {{was taken}} over by the Brewers Investment Corporation Ltd who set about remodelling it. Large windows and <b>fascia</b> <b>boards</b> were added, making it similar to other pubs of the time. The {{internal}} floor space was restructured and an outdoor department was created. Toilets were also constructed in the rear yard.|$|R
50|$|The Fulton House is a {{modified}} {{example of the}} International style in the materials, detailing and asymmetrical massing. It is a two-storey buff-coloured brick house with contrasting red brick to the lower levels and a terra cotta tiled roof. A large box gutter is concealed behind a deep <b>fascia</b> <b>board</b> and this combined with the horizontal raked joints and the concrete balcony and steel balustrade serves to emphasise the horizontal lines. The chimney is built in a red brick emphasising the vertical line.|$|E
5000|$|The Sheads House, {{also known}} as Oak Ridge Seminary, is a {{historic}} home located at Gettysburg in Adams County, Pennsylvania. It was built in 1862, and is a 2 1/2-story, [...] "T"-shaped brick dwelling in the Gothic Revival style. It sits on a granite foundation and has a cross gable roof. It features an ornamental <b>fascia</b> <b>board</b> and porches with ornamental balustrades. Shortly after it was built it housed Oak Ridge Seminary, a girls' school. During the Battle of Gettysburg, it {{was used as a}} hospital for Confederate States Army wounded.|$|E
50|$|On the interior, {{the broad}} central hall is divided at {{midpoint}} by a graceful elliptical arch which rests at either side on piers {{alluding to the}} Doric order in detail. The stair which ascends along the east wall of the hall and curves {{at the beginning and}} end of each flight, develops exceptional rhythm of design due to the repetition of the octagonal-shaped and turned balusters, two to a tread. In addition, the scrolled, uncarved brackets on the step ends and the <b>fascia</b> <b>board</b> on the landings increase the activity of the design, making the stairway the finest single piece of woodwork in the house.|$|E
50|$|It {{also does}} not require plants. It just as easily builds its colonies in wooden structures. It is a {{household}} pest. It has been introduced to new areas in shipments of wooden furniture and lumber. It has been observed colonizing a wooden bench. In structures it infests wood flooring, window frames, door frames, <b>fascia</b> <b>boards,</b> and soffits. It occupies utility poles. In Japan it infests tatami.|$|R
5000|$|Following {{extensive}} refurbishment, {{the station}} won an Ian Allan Heritage Railway award in 1990, {{but since then}} only remedial work {{has been carried out}} to the station's intricate and distinctively carved wooden <b>fascia</b> <b>boards</b> and other paintwork. In 1999 the traditional [...] "picket" [...] style wooden fencing was removed from the platform area and replaced with tall metal security fencing (to protect the bus yard in the former platform area) which detracted from the picturesque setting.|$|R
25|$|In some {{decorative}} applications, {{wood with}} knots may be desirable to add visual interest. In applications where wood is painted, such as skirting <b>boards,</b> <b>fascia</b> <b>boards,</b> door frames and furniture, resins {{present in the}} timber may continue to 'bleed' through {{to the surface of}} a knot for months or even years after manufacture and show as a yellow or brownish stain. A knot primer paint or solution (knotting), correctly applied during preparation, may do much to reduce this problem {{but it is difficult to}} control completely, especially when using mass-produced kiln-dried timber stocks.|$|R
50|$|Cast iron gutters were {{introduced}} in the late 18th century {{as an alternative to}} lead. Cast iron enabled eaves gutters to be mass-produced: they were rigid and non-porous while lead could only be used as a liner within timber gutters. Installation was a single process and didn't require heat. They could be attached directly to the <b>fascia</b> <b>board.</b> Cast iron gutters are still specified for restoration work in conservation areas, but are usually replaced with cast aluminium made to the same profile. Extruded aluminium gutters can be made to a variety of profiles from a roll of aluminium sheet on site in lengths of up to 30m. They feature internal brackets at 400mm spacing.|$|E
5000|$|Many of {{the same}} {{decorative}} motifs appear on the inside as on the exterior fascia; the pilasters of the arcs have the same capitals, and grooved <b>fascia</b> <b>board</b> frames. On {{the walls of the}} chapel also appears a ledge, beautifully decorated. The walls are painted to imitate stones. In the pavement are preserved inscriptions concerning the graves surrounding the altar; on the epistle side is inscribed [...] "Graves of nobles and commoners" [...] and on the gospel side [...] "Graves of nobles married and unmarried children." [...] Vaqueiros were placed in the nave.("The 'baqueros' (sic) will no more move from here in order to hear Mass" [...] and [...] "Graves for 'baqueros' (sic) and strangers").|$|E
5000|$|A rake is an {{architectural}} term for an eave or cornice which {{runs along the}} gable end of {{the roof of a}} modern residential structure. It may also be called a sloping cornice, a raking cornice. The trim and rafters at this edge are called rake-, verge-, or barge-board or verge- or barge-rafter. [...] It is a sloped timber on the outside facing edge of a roof running between the ridge and the eave. [...] On a typical house, any gable will have two rakes, one on each sloped side. The rakes are supported by a series of lookouts (sometimes also called strong arms) and may be enclosed with a rake <b>fascia</b> <b>board</b> on the outside facing edge and a rake soffit along the bottom.|$|E

25|$|On the exterior, Frank Lloyd Wright traded the dual-pitched, cross-gable roof in the Stick {{style for}} a more {{distinctive}} dual-pitched hip roof with deep eaves and thick wood <b>fascia</b> <b>boards.</b> The form and style of the roof exemplified Wright's Japanese influence, and has been likened {{to the design of}} Asian pagodas. The unique design was furthered by a tierred surface of cedar shingles created by furring strips under every fifth row. Three dormers – one each on the east, south, and west façades – were likewise faced in shingles and were topped by the same flared, double-pitched roofs.|$|R
5000|$|The {{building}} is of loadbearing construction {{and has a}} rectangular plan and a hipped roof clad with corrugated iron. The {{building is}} surrounded on three sides by a double-storeyed verandah, with hipped curved awnings supported on cast iron columns {{on the first floor}}. A wide <b>fascia</b> <b>board</b> at the first floor level of the verandah, has signage, [...] "Maryborough Heritage Centre". Joining the columns on the first floor are balustrade panels of decorative cast iron. Surmounting the columns on the first floor is a dentilled entablature, being the fascia of the awning. The ground floor of the verandah is lined with cast iron columns on rendered masonry plinths between which a wrought iron balustrade runs, also on a rendered masonry plinth.|$|E
5000|$|The top of {{the facade}} is marked by two flying gables with {{triangular}} pediments and semi-circular valances with a central finial. The gables are supported by decorative timber brackets and they frame vertical timber panelling {{on the face of}} the building. The gables surmount small, elongated oriel windows with narrow rectangular glass panels. In the centre of the facade is a neo-classical triangular pediment which surmounts a Dutch-style pediment with a decorative timber [...] "heart" [...] motif in the centre. On ground level, a protruding set of doors framed in Gothic style arches are protected by a double awning, the top layer convex and the bottom layer concave. The two awnings are separated by a large <b>fascia</b> <b>board</b> decorated by rectangular panels.|$|E
50|$|The Compton house {{also has}} a two-story rear ell, for which the periodization is less clear-cut. One {{theory is that the}} middle portion of the ell was a one-story kitchen built {{at the same time as}} the more {{finished}} original house, and the ell was later expanded upward and backward. In the attic, an exposed <b>fascia</b> <b>board</b> for the front portion of the house indicates that at least the second story of the rear ell was a later building phase. Yet there are signs that the original ell could be an earlier, 18th-century structure that was attached to the 1818 house. The size and form of the middle section, which displays exposed beaded joists, resembles some 18th-century one-room dwellings in Cape May County. The rear portion of the ell was clearly a later addition, as revealed by the split rear stairs and a second set of carpenters marks in the attic.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{carving of}} the {{traditional}} Malay house is not only aesthetical but also functional for filtering daylight. The carvings were commonly applied at the roof end as <b>fascia</b> <b>boards,</b> on the walls, on windows {{and other parts of}} opening design. The study focus on evaluating carving panels applied at the top {{of the traditional}} Malay house's window. A computer simulation, the ECOTECT software, is conducted based on simplified carving ratio categories of solid and void (1 : 1 - 1 : 99). The results will suggest the daylight levels filter through the carvings that can correlate with suitable task recommended by the guidelines...|$|R

40|$|The {{manufacture}} of polyvinyl (PVC) <b>fascia</b> <b>boards</b> involves the extrusion of a pressurized mixture of molten PVC and foaming agents through a die that is shaped in {{the exterior of}} a board; subsequent pressure release triggers foaming, so that {{the interior of the}} board is filled, simultaneously as the board is cooled. Sometimes, however, the foam does not fill the interior, leading to undesired voids, especially at corners. We consider a mathematical model for the foaming process that attempts to account for the formation of undesired voids. Preliminary model results suggest that severe temperature gradients through the cross-section are most likely responsible for void formation; two mechanisms are suggested...|$|R
5000|$|Trustee Chambers has a hipped {{corrugated}} iron roof, recently reclad. The Quay Street elevation features a double storeyed verandah, the awning {{supported on the}} ground floor by six substantial cast iron columns with Doric capitals resting on square planned bases which are linked with a wrought iron cross braced balustrade on a rendered brick plinth. The <b>fascia</b> <b>board</b> above the columns {{at the level of the}} first floor has lettering [...] "TRUSTEE CHAMBERS" [...] painted onto it. On the first floor the skillion roofed verandah, hipped at the ends, is supported on timber columns aligned with the ground floor cast iron columns. The first floor verandah has a cast iron balustrade and the stop chamfered columns have simple timber brackets and decorative mouldings. The soffit of this verandah is clad with timber boarding and the concrete floor is carpeted. On the face of the building between the verandah awning and the eaves line are several single eaves brackets regularly spaced to align with the columns below.|$|E
50|$|The steeply pitched {{hipped roof}} of Freshney House is clad with {{corrugated}} iron and is half-gabled over {{the eastern and}} western ends and has projecting bays over the northern entrance wing. The entrance is emphasized on the roof with a large, half-timbered gablet with central ventilation panel. This gable detail is repeated at the half-gabled ends of the building. Smaller ventilation gablets line the main hipped roof of the building. Two face brick chimneys project symmetrically from the roof over the entrance wing. The roof encompasses the upper-storey verandah awning, which is supported on timber columns with elongated art nouveau brackets. These columns are repeated on the ground level. Lining the first floor verandah is a timber balustrade of battened timber with central decorative timber panels within each verandah bay, featuring an art nouveau motif. Forming the valance of the ground floor verandah and visually separating the two storeys is a wide <b>fascia</b> <b>board</b> clad with horizontal timber boarding which curves outwards, forming a skirt around the building.|$|E
5000|$|The {{house is}} part of a terrace {{on the south side of}} Watergate Street. It is built in {{sandstone}} and timber framing with plaster panels and a slate roof. It has four storeys and a gable overlooking the street. At the street level is a modern shop front and, to the right, a set of concrete steps leading up to the row level. Set back at this level is another modern shop front. Overlooking the street is a Jacobean style railing. Above the row level is a <b>fascia</b> <b>board</b> inscribed [...] "GOD'S PROVIDENCE IS MINE INHERITANCE". In the centre of the third storey is a central nine-pane casement window, surrounded by timber framing with recessed moulded plaster panels. Across the base of the attic storey is a row of quatrefoil braces, with a four-pane window in the centre. At the sides and above the window is more timber framing with panels similar to those on the third storey. At the top of the gable is an elaborately carved bargeboard and, at its summit, a finial. Internally in the undercroft at street level, some 13th century sandstone fabric is still present in the east party wall.|$|E
50|$|The dining room, {{drawing room}} and hall were all built with {{tongue and groove}} pine {{boarding}} which was then stamped with pressed metal ceilings. A pressed metal ceiling was also placed in the first bedroom. The foundations of the chimneys and hearths, carried up to the underscore of the metal plates, were constructed using blue stone set with lime mortar. The inner and outer hearths of all the fireplaces were laid with salt glazed bricks. Hodgen also designed the stable buildings which are still extant. The specifications book provides details about stumps, floors, walls and ceilings, <b>fascia</b> <b>boards,</b> windows, the coach house doors and the stable doors.|$|R
25|$|Traditional shophouses facade {{ornamentation}} draws {{inspiration from}} the Malay, Chinese and European traditions. European neo-classical motifs include egg-and-dart moldings and ionic or Corinthian capitals on decorative pillasters. From the Malay building tradition, elaborate woodwork has been borrowed {{in the form of}} carved panels. <b>Fascia</b> <b>boards,</b> louvres, screens and fretwork. Finally, from the Chinese tradition comes Sino-Portuguese influences and mythological motifs like phoenixes as well as butterfly-shaped windows. Other traditions include the use of Peranakan pastel coloured glazed tiles, often with floral or geometric motifs. The degree of a shophouse's ornamentation depended on the prosperity of its owner and the surrounding area; shophouse facades in cities and (former) boomtowns are generally more elaborate than spartan rural shophouses.|$|R
50|$|The main {{building}} is two storey, timber framed with green painted corrugated iron to the hip roof with skillion veranda awnings on three sides. External walls are clad with painted vertical corrugated iron. The former front {{section of the}} timber deck veranda has been removed, the lower level open rail balustrade replaced with weatherboards and steps added to access the bar. At the upper level the cross braced open balustrade remains as does the decorative <b>fascia</b> <b>boards.</b> Timber posts support the timber deck veranda which provides access to the tongue and groove-lined guest bedrooms through individual French doors. Behind the public bar stands an old hardwood insulated coolroom which is claimed to produce excellent temperature beer.|$|R
