60|$|Java and {{the islands}} eastward {{as far as}} Flores are {{inhabited}} by G. varius (or furcatus), which differs in so many characters--green plumage, unserrated comb, and single median wattle--that no one supposes it {{to have been the}} parent of any one of our breeds; yet, as I am informed by Mr. Crawfurd (7/17. See also Mr. Crawfurd 'Descriptive Dict. of the Indian Islands' 1856 page 113.), hybrids are commonly raised between the male G. varius and the common hen, and are kept for their great beauty, but are invariably sterile: this, however, was not the case with some bred in the Zoological Gardens. These hybrids were at one time thought to be specifically distinct, and were named G. aeneus. Mr. Blyth and others believe that the G. temminckii (7/18. Described by Mr. G.R. Gray 'Proc. Zoolog. Soc' 1849 page 62.) (of which the history is not known) is a similar hybrid. Sir J. Brooke sent me some skins of domestic fowls from Borneo, and across the tail of one of these, as Mr. Tegetmeier observed, there were transverse blue bands like those which he had seen on the tail- feathers of hybrids from G. varius, reared in the Zoological Gardens. This fact apparently indicates that some of the fowls of Borneo have been slightly affected by crosses with G. varius, but the case may possibly be one of analogous variation. I may just allude to the G. giganteus, so often referred to in works on poultry as a wild species; but Marsden (7/19. The passage from Marsden is given by Mr. Dixon in his 'Poultry Book' page 176.

5000|$|The {{principal}} {{difference between}} wild einkorn and cultivated einkorn is {{the method of}} seed dispersal. In the wild variety the seed head usually shatters and drops the kernels (seeds) of wheat onto the ground. This facilitates {{a new crop of}} wheat. In the <b>domestic</b> <b>variety,</b> the seed head remains intact. While such a mutation may occasionally occur in the wild, it is not viable there in the long term: the intact seed head will only drop to the ground when the stalk rots, and the kernels will not scatter but form a tight clump which inhibits germination and makes the mutant seedlings susceptible to disease. But harvesting einkorn with intact seed heads was easier for early human harvesters, who could then manually break apart the seed heads and scatter any kernels not eaten. Over time and through selection, conscious or unconscious, the human preference for intact seed heads created the <b>domestic</b> <b>variety,</b> which also has slightly larger kernels than wild einkorn. Domesticated einkorn thus requires human planting and harvesting for its continuing existence. [...] This process of domestication might have taken only 20 to 200 years with the end product a wheat easier for humans to harvest.|$|E

These intermediate goods {{are used in}} the production of a final good, which can be used for consumption, capital accumulation, or investment in market entry. Therefore capital accumulation is the direct alternative to investing in firm entry. This has a number of implications. First, in the short run following trade liberalizations a higher interest rate will prevail, which will tend to shelter incumbent firms from increased competition by discouraging investment in entry of new firms. Second, different forms of trade liberalizations with the same impact on the share of expenditure on <b>domestic</b> <b>variety</b> will have different effects on consumption, and thus welfare, both during transitions and in steady-state, due to different effects on aggregate investment. Third, the accumulation of capital will add a time dimension to the anti-variety effects of trade liberalizations.

Further, the study of transitions in this framework provides important insights regarding the effects of different forms of trade liberalizations in general and on welfare and individual firms in particular. ...|$|E

The knowledge on the phenolic composition of grapes and its evolution during ripening is thus of crucial importance in relation to wine quality. Among them, anthocyanins, located in the skins, are responsible for the red colour of the grapes, while flavonoids and especially flavan- 3 -ols intervene in their taste, astringency and bitterness. In this study, total polyphenols, flavonoids, flavan- 3 -ols and anthocyanins were determined in the pulp, skins and seeds of Vranec grapes in three ripening stages: veraison, technological and physiological ripeness, applying standardized spectrophotometric methods [1, 2]. Extraction of phenolic compounds from grape pulp, seeds and skins was performed with acetone/water mixture (80 / 20, v/v). Results showed that the concentration of total phenolics in skins increased during ripening (21. 21 mg/g, 48. 17 mg/g, 61. 55 mg/g, {{at the beginning of the}} ripeness, at technological and physiological ripeness, respectively), but they slightly decreased in the seeds.

Oil content of the blackberry pomace was 13. 97 and 14. 34 %, while the oil content of the raspberry pomace was 13. 44 and 14. 33 % on dry basis (d. b.). In regard to technological characteristics of the pomaces, i. e. volumetric and specific weight, no considerably difference was found. However, a weight test for 1000 seeds showed a significant difference in weight: 3. 5 g (d. b.) for the blackberry pomace and 1. 5 g for the raspberry pomace (d. b.). Proximate analysis of blackberry seed oil showed that this oil had better quality since the FFA value was 3. 43 % (sample B 1) and 3. 53 % (sample B 2), while the peroxide value was 8. 89 and 11. 16 mmol/kg, respectively. Raspberry seed oil had higher FFA (8. 59 and 8. 83 % for sample R 1 and R 2) and peroxide values (13. 99 and 13. 84 for sample R 1 and R 2) than the blackberry seed oil. Crude extracted blackberry seed oil had a brown-greenish color due to the high total chlorophyll content (around 3000 mg/kg dissolved in cyclohexane). Raspberry seed oil had a dark yellowishorange color, due to lower chlorophyll content (around 200 mg/kg) compared to the blackberry seed oil, while the content of total carotenoids was slightly higher in this oil (around 40 mg/kg) compared to the blackberry seed oil (33 mg/kg).

60|$|Nevertheless, {{the fact}} remains indisputable that domesticated varieties, of animals and of plants, which differ greatly from one another in structure, but which are {{certainly}} descended from the same aboriginal species, such as the races of the fowl, pigeon, many vegetables, {{and a host of}} other productions, are extremely fertile when crossed; and this seems to make a broad and impassable barrier between <b>domestic</b> <b>varieties</b> and natural species. But, as I will now attempt to show, the distinction is not so great and overwhelmingly important as it at first appears.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{includes}} three essays. Essay 1 extends the Dixit-Stiglitz (1977) model of monopolistic competition by relaxing {{the assumption of}} a single technology. The main objective is to study whether the equivalence of the monopolistically competitive equilibrium to the social optimum still holds in the extended model. I show that the answer crucially depends {{on the nature of}} the technological heterogeneity. If firms are free to choose from a common set of available technologies, and a free entry/exit condition holds to ensure a zero-profit equilibrium, then the Dixit-Stiglitz result is robust to the existence of heterogeneous firms. However, if firm-level productivity is drawn from a heterogeneous distribution, so that some intra-marginal firms earn positive profits, then the market equilibrium no longer has the same desirable properties. ^ Models with CES preferences are commonly employed in the ‘new’ international trade literature, but these models generate counterfactual implications for the price elasticity of demand, and the rate of variety growth. Essay 2 generalizes Lancaster 2 ̆ 7 s ‘ideal variety’ model in order to better match empirical facts on trade. In particular, the strength of preference for the ideal variety depends on quantities consumed resulting in a price elasticity of demand that covaries positively with the market size and negatively with income per capita of the importer. ^ Essay 3 generalizes Romer 2 ̆ 7 s (1994) story by endogenizing the number of <b>domestic</b> <b>varieties.</b> This accounts for the possibility that countries which are capable of producing more of their own capital goods will be less dependent on foreign imports. In Romer 2 ̆ 7 s model, all capital goods come from foreign sources so that domestic production cannot compensate for the absence of foreign <b>variety.</b> I allow <b>domestic</b> firms to produce capital goods so that the model solves simultaneously for the number of total varieties in the economy and the foreign/domestic split. The number of <b>domestic</b> <b>varieties</b> depends on fixed and variable costs of their production—countries with low costs of production can produce a greater set of <b>domestic</b> <b>varieties</b> and so import fewer foreign varieties. An implication is that welfare is more responsive to tariffs for countries with a lower potential for innovation. ...|$|R
