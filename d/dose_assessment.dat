It is related to the gray by weighting factors described in the articles on equivalent dose and effective dose.

40|$|Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) {{methodology}} for radioactive substances {{is an important}} regulatory tool for assessing the safety of licensed nuclear facilities for wildlife, and the environment as a whole. ERAs are therefore expected to be both fit for purpose and conservative. When uranium isotopes are assessed, there are many radioactive decay products which could be considered. However, risk assessors usually assume 235 U and its daughters contribute negligibly to radiological dose. The validity of this assumption has not been tested: what might the 235 U family contribution be and how does the estimate depend on the assumptions applied? In this paper we address this question by considering aquatic wildlife in Canadian lakes exposed to historic uranium mining practices. A full theoretical approach was used, in parallel to a more realistic assessment based on measurements of several elements of the U decay chains. The 235 U family contribution varied between about 4 % and 75 % of the total dose rate depending on the assumptions of the equilibrium state of the decay chains. Hence, ignoring the 235 U series will not result in conservative <b>dose</b> <b>assessments</b> for wildlife.

Currently, full physics Monte Carlo calculations for dose calculations have been regarded as a ‘gold standard’ for <b>dose</b> <b>assessments</b> of the target and OAR (organ at risk). However, these Monte Carlo calculations require very long computation times. The current treatment planning methods provide shorter calculation times, but issues such as heterogeneities and model-based parameter calculations cause challenges and affect dose calculation accuracy. This thesis describes a new and fast dose estimation method leveraging parallel computing called EDK-SN, “Electron Dose Kernel-Discrete Ordinates”. This new method uses hybrid electron dose kernels driven by linear Boltzmann (discrete ordinates) photon transport method to carry out dose calculations. The method has proven effective for fast and accurate computations of out-of-field whole body dose calculations benchmarked to Monte Carlo with isotropic monoenergetic photon sources. This thesis accomplishes adaptation of clinical Varian phase space data for use with general Monte Carlo codes including MCNP, and mapping accurate phase space data into the application of optimized EDK-SN dose calculation method with a 15 -year-old patient phantom. The EDK-SN method with improved source term modeling is demonstrated to fall within accuracy of the measured golden beam data for a clinical water phantom. Ph. D...|$|R

40|$|The {{radiation}} dose for the Dutch population due to discharges and emissions from processing industries has decreased substantially since 1994. However, the processing industry still makes the largest industrial {{contribution to the}} {{radiation dose}}. Nuclear installations and medical institutions contribute much less. There was a considerable decrease up to 2000, when two fertilizer enterprises stopped their activities in the Netherlands. Although the reported discharges of radioactive substances to water show a sharp decrease, the collective dose due to emissions to air has shown slight increases since 2001. The policy to reduce discharges in water has led to enterprises investing in wastewater treatment systems. Enterprises also take the radiological consequences into account when purchasing raw materials containing natural occurring radioactive material. The cost of the raw material obviously also influences the decision. Occupational exposure in processing plants was investigated using the data of the National Dose Registration and Information System (NDRIS).
