Background Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a polymicrobial condition whereby the lactobacilli dominated vaginal microflora is overgrown by anaerobes [1], such as Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae [2].

40|$|Many drug {{molecules}} exert {{their biological}} action on intracellular molecular targets present on or inside various cellular organelles. Consequently, {{it has become}} more evident that the efficiency and efficacy of drug action is dependent largely on how well an unaided drug molecule is able to reach its intracellular target. We hypothesized that the biological action of such drug molecules might be improved by specific delivery to the appropriate sub-cellular site by a pharmaceutical carrier designed for the purpose. To test our hypothesis, we used paclitaxel, a molecule that has recently been shown to have pro-apoptotic biological targets on the mitochondria but has a quantitative structure–activity relationship-predicted cytosolic accumulation and no affinity for mitochondria. Using a mitochondria-specific nanocarrier system (DQAsomes) prepared from the amphiphilic quinolinium derivative <b>dequalinium</b> <b>chloride</b> to deliver paclitaxel to mitochondria in cells, we report {{that it is possible to}} improve the pro-apoptotic action of paclitaxel...|$|E
40|$|Acute {{myeloid leukemia}} (AML) is a {{neoplasia}} {{characterized by the}} rapid expansion of immature myeloid blasts in the bone marrow, and marked by poor prognosis and frequent relapse. As such, new therapeutic approaches are required for remission induction and prevention of relapse. Due to the higher chemotherapy sensitivity and limited life span of more differentiated AML blasts, differentiation-based therapies are a promising therapeutic approach. Based on public available gene expression profiles, a myeloid-specific differentiation-associated gene expression pattern was defined as the therapeutic target. A XIAP inhibitor (<b>Dequalinium</b> <b>chloride,</b> DQA) was identified in an in silico screening searching for small molecules that induce similar gene expression regulation. Treatment with DQA, similarly to Embelin (another XIAP inhibitor), induced cytotoxicity and differentiation in AML. XIAP inhibition differentially impaired cell viability of the most primitive AML blasts and reduced clonogenic capacity of AML cells, sparing healthy mature blood and hematopoietic stem cells. Taken together, these results suggest that XIAP constitutes a potential target for AML treatment and support the evaluation of XIAP inhibitors in clinical trials...|$|E
40|$|Aims: To {{investigate}} if vaginal {{application of}} <b>dequalinium</b> <b>chloride</b> (DQC, Fluomizin (R)) is {{as effective as}} vaginal clindamycin (CLM) {{in the treatment of}} bacterial vaginosis (BV). Methods:This was a multinational, multicenter, single-blind, randomized trial in 15 centers, including 321 women. They were randomized to either vaginal DQC tablets or vaginal CLM cream. Follow-up visits were 1 week and 1 month after treatment. Clinical cure based on Amsel's criteria was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were rate of treatment failures and recurrences, incidence of post-treatment vulvovaginal candidosis (VVC), lactobacillary grade (LBG), total symptom score (TSC), and safety. Results: Cure rates with DQC (Cl: 81. 5 %, C 2 : 79. 5 %) were as high as with CLM (Cl: 78. 4 %, C 2 : 77. 6 %). Thus, the treatment with DQC had equal efficacy as CLM cream. A trend to less common post-treatment VVC in the DQC-treated women was observed (DQC: 2. 5 %, CLM: 7. 7 %; p = 0. 06). Both treatments were well tolerated with no serious adverse events occurring. Conclusion: Vaginal DQC {{has been shown to be}} equally effective as CLM cream, to be well tolerated with no systemic safety concerns, and is therefore a valid alternative therapy for women with BV {[}ClinicalTrials. gov, Med 380104, NCT 01125410].

40|$|Three genes encode the small-conductance Ca 2 +-activated K+ {{channels}} (SK channels). We have stably expressed hSK 1 and rSK 2 in HEK 293 {{cells and}} addressed the pharmacology of these subtypes using whole-cell patch clamp recordings. The bee venom peptide apamin blocked hSK 1 {{as well as}} rSK 2 with IC 50 values of 3. 3 [*]nM and 83 [*]pM, respectively. The pharmacological separation between the subtypes was even more prominent when applying the scorpion peptide blocker scyllatoxin, which blocked hSK 1 with an IC 50 value of 80 [*]nM and rSK 2 at 287 [*]pM. The potent small molecule blockers showed little differentiation between the channel subtypes. The bis-quinolinium cyclophane UCL 1684 blocked hSK 1 with an IC 50 value of 762 [*]pM and rSK 2 at 364 [*]pM. The antiseptic compound <b>dequalinium</b> <b>chloride</b> blocked hSK 1 and rSK 2 with IC 50 values of 444 [*]nM and 162 [*]nM, respectively. The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist d-tubocurarine was found to block hSK 1 and rSK 2 with IC 50 values of 27 [*]μM and 17 [*]μM when measured at + 80 [*]mV. The inhibition by d-tubocurarine was voltage-dependent with increasing affinities at more hyperpolarized potentials. The GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline methiodide also blocked hSK 1 and rSK 2 in a voltage-dependent manner with IC 50 values of 15 and 25 [*]μM when measured at + 80 [*]mV. In conclusion, the pharmacological separation between SK channel subtypes expressed in mammalian cells {{is too small to}} support the notion that the apamin-insensitive afterhyperpolarization of neurones is mediated by hSK 1...|$|E
40|$|A meiotic {{segregant}} (oliPR 1) {{was isolated}} with a phenotype of multiple cross resistance and collateral sensitivity. Strain oliPR 1 has increased sensitivity to ethidium bromide, <b>dequalinium</b> <b>chloride,</b> acriflavin, paromomycin and neomycin, and increased resistance to oligomycin, rutamycin, venturicidin, triethyltin bromide, antimycin, carbonylcynamide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone, tetra-N-butylammonium bromide, dibenzyldimethylammonium chloride, triphenylmethylphosphonium bromide, chloramphenicol, carbomycin, tetracycline, triton-X- 165 and cycloheximide. Single gene inheritance {{of the cross}} resistance and collateral sensitivity was shown by 2 : 2 parental ditype segregation and reversion of the complete phenotype by a spontaneous revertant. The locus conferring the oliPR 1 phenotype was mapped 11. 7 units from an unspecified centromere. Antibiotic resistance showed incomplete dominance, {{with the level of}} hybrid resistance dependent upon the inhibitor tested. Resistant diploids that produced four resistant ascospores were the result of mitotic recombination prior to meiosis. A partial revertant phenotype (sensitive to all inhibitors except oligomycin, antimycin and carbonylcyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone) was shown to be due to a single nuclear gene causing partial suppression of oliPR 1. Anaerobic pretreatment, 37 ° and 0. 5 M KCl were observed to reduce the growth of oliPR 1 when challenged with seven diverse inhibitors (antimycin, carbonylcyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone,-chloramphenicol, cycloheximide, oligomycin, triethyltin bromide, and triphenylmethylphosphonium bromide). Resistance to cycloheximide was not altered by the [rho—] state. A revertant of oliPR 1 (sensitive to the above inhibitors but resistant to ethidium bromide, paromycin and neomycin) showed anaerobic and temperature sensitization to ethidium bromide, paromomycin and neomycin. Continuous monitoring of oxygen uptake by the revertant after anaerobic pretreatment revealed that anaerobiosis sensitized respiratory adaptation of the revertant to neomycin. It is proposed that oliPR 1 is a mutation resulting in the alteration of plasma membrane premeability to many diverse inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|Indicators of {{mitochondrial}} function were studied {{in two different}} cell culture models of cis-diamminedichloroplatinum-II (CDDP) resistance: the intrinsically resistant human ovarian cancer cell line CI- 80 - 13 S, and resistant clones (HeLa-S 1 a and HeLa-S 1 b) generated by stable expression of the serine protease inhibitor—plasminogen activator inhibitor type- 2 (PAI- 2), in the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa. In both models, CDDP resistance was associated with sensitivity to killing by adriamycin, etoposide, auranofin, bis[1, 2 -bis(diphenylphosphino) ethane]gold(I) chloride {[Au(DPPE) 2]Cl}, CdCl 2 and the mitochondrial inhibitors rhodamine- 123 (Rhl 23), <b>dequalinium</b> <b>chloride</b> (DeCH), tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP), and ethidium bromide (EtBr) and with lower constitutive levels of ATP. Unlike the HeLa clones, CI- 80 - 13 S cells were additionally sensitive to chloramphenicol, 1 -methyl- 4 -phenylpyridinium ion (MPP+), rotenone, thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA), and antimycin A, and showed poor reduction of 1 -[4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl]- 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), suggesting a deficiency in NADH dehydrogenase and/or succinate dehydrogenase activities. Total platinum uptake and DNA-bound platinum were slightly lower in CI- 80 - 13 S than in sensitive cells. The HeLa-S 1 a and HeLa-S 1 b clones, on the other hand, showed poor reduction of triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC), indicative of low cytochrome c oxidase activity. Total platinum uptake by HeLa-S 1 a was similar to HeLa, but DNA-bound platinum was much lower than for the parent cell line. The mitochondria of CI- 80 - 13 S and HeLa-S 1 a showed altered morphology and were fewer in number than those of JAM and HeLa. In both models, CDDP resistance was associated with less platinum accumulation and with mitochondrial and membrane defects, brought about one case with expression of a protease inhibitor which is implicated in tumor progression. Such markers may identify tumors suitable for treatment with gold phosphine complexes or other mitochondrial inhibitors.
