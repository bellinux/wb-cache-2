40|$|Alveolar macrophages from Pneumocystis carinii-infected rats are {{defective}} in phagocytosis. To {{investigate whether}} this defect {{is due to}} a certain factor present in P. carinii-infected lungs, alveolar macrophages from uninfected rats were incubated with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) <b>fluid</b> <b>samples</b> from P. carinii-infected rats. Alveolar macrophages treated with these BAL <b>fluid</b> <b>samples</b> became defective in phagocytosis but remained normal when treated with BAL <b>fluid</b> <b>samples</b> from noninfected or Toxoplasma gondii-infected rats. The suppressive activity of the BAL <b>fluid</b> <b>samples</b> from P. carinii-infected rats on phagocytosis was retained when the BAL <b>fluid</b> <b>samples</b> were passed through a filter with a pore size of 0. 45 μm but was lost when the BAL <b>fluid</b> <b>samples</b> were digested with proteases such as trypsin, pepsin, papain, or endopeptidase Gly-C. Lipid fractions of these BAL <b>fluid</b> <b>samples</b> had no suppressive activity on phagocytosis. The suppressive activity of these BAL <b>fluid</b> <b>samples</b> was also lost when they were incubated with concanavalin A-agarose beads, suggesting that the inhibitor is a glycoprotein. The inhibitor was estimated to be larger than 100, 000 Da by exclusion filtration. After binding to the concanavalin A-agarose beads, the inhibitor in BAL <b>fluid</b> <b>samples</b> and P. carinii lysate could be eluted with 200 mM methylmannose. Treatment of both the crude BAL <b>fluid</b> <b>samples</b> and P. carinii lysate and the 200 mM methylmannose eluate with antibody against the major surface glycoprotein of P. carinii eliminated their suppressive activity. These results suggest that the factor capable of suppressing the phagocytic activity of alveolar macrophages is P. carinii major surface glycoprotein or one or more of its derivatives...|$|R

30|$|Formation testing while {{drilling}} is {{an innovative}} technique that is replacing conventional pressure testing {{in which the}} <b>fluid</b> <b>sampling</b> is conducted {{in a relatively short}} time following the drilling. At this time, mud invasion has just started, mudcake has not formed entirely and the formation pressure is not stable. Therefore, it is important to study the influence of the downhole dynamic environment on pressure testing and <b>fluid</b> <b>sampling.</b> This paper applies an oil-water two phase finite element model to study the influence of mudcake quality and mud filtrate invasion on supercharge pressure, pretest and sampling in the reservoirs of different permeability. However, the study is only for the cases with water based mud in the wellbore. The results illustrate that the mudcake quality has a significant influence on the supercharge pressure and <b>fluid</b> <b>sampling,</b> while the level of mud filtrate invasion has a strong impact on pressure testing and sampling. In addition, in-situ formation pressure testing is more difficult in low permeability reservoirs as the mud filtrate invasion is deeper and therefore degrades the quality of <b>fluid</b> <b>sampling.</b> Finally, a field example from an oil field on the Alaskan North Slope is presented to validate the numerical studies of the effects of downhole dynamic conditions on formation testing while drilling.|$|E

40|$|The {{acquisition}} of representative subsea <b>fluid</b> <b>sampling</b> from offshore field development asset {{is crucial for}} the correct evaluation of oil reserves and {{for the design of}} subsea production facilities. Due to rising operational expenditures, operators and manufacturers have been working hard to provide systems to enable cost effective subsea <b>fluid</b> <b>sampling</b> solutions. To achieve this, any system has to collect sufficient sample volumes to ensure statistically valid characterisation of the sampled fluids. In executing the research project, various subsea sampling methods used in the offshore industry were examined and ranked using multi criteria decision making; a solution using a remote operated vehicle was selected as the preferred method, to compliment the subsea multiphase flowmeter capability, used to provide well diagnostics to measure individual phases – oil, gas, and water. A mechanistic (compositional fluid tracking) model is employed, using the fluid properties that are equivalent to the production flow stream being measured, to predict reliable reservoir fluid characteristics on the subsea production system. This is applicable even under conditions where significant variations in the reservoir fluid composition occur in transient production operations. The model also adds value in the decision to employ subsea processing in managing water breakthrough as the field matures. This can be achieved through efficient processing of the fluid with separation and boosting delivered to the topside facilities or for water re-injection to the reservoir. The combination of multiphase flowmeter, remote operated vehicle deployed <b>fluid</b> <b>sampling</b> and the mechanistic model provides a balanced approach to reservoir performance monitoring. Therefore, regular and systematic field tailored application of subsea <b>fluid</b> <b>sampling</b> should provide detailed understanding on formation fluid, a basis for accurate prediction of reservoir fluid characteristic, to maximize well production in offshore field development...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{trend in}} subsea {{petroleum}} production systems in offshore field developments points towards integrated production and processing facilities at the seabed {{along with more}} extensive use of multiphase transportation technology. The SOFA (Subsea On-line multiphase <b>Fluid</b> <b>sampling</b> and Analysis) system designed by Christian Michelsen Research {{in cooperation with the}} University of Bergen is an autonomous metering station for permanent installation subsea. The SOFA carries out fluid analysis subsea, and the current method of transfer of fluid samples to surface by a remote operated vehicle is avoided. A laboratory prototype for capturing multiphase fluid samples in a dedicated measurement chamber/sample container has been built and tested. This is equipped with ultrasound sensors, a dual modality densitometer (DMD) gamma-ray system, pressure and temperature sensors, which together with conductivity, permittivity or similar measurements will be used as a multi-modality system for fluid characterisation. This paper presents experimental results for <b>fluid</b> <b>sampling</b> and characterisation based on multimodality. The focus is on detection and monitoring of water salinity, water density and oil density. In addition, perspectives for operational use are discussed. 1...|$|E

The ELISA results were compared with the results of culture and Aspergillus genus-specific PCR analysis of BAL <b>fluid</b> <b>samples.</b> ELISA was also performed with serum samples. Aspergillus species were detected by PCR or ELISA with BAL <b>fluid</b> <b>samples</b> from five of seven patients who had radiological evidence of IPA.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the transfer of}} fentanyl across the early human placenta, we have collected samples of maternal blood and fetal fluids and/or blood, simultaneously, between 5 and 22 min following an intravenous bolus of fentanyl (1. 5 mg/kg) to the mother. The pregnancies were between 6 and 16 weeks of gestation and scheduled for elective termination of pregnancy under general anaesthesia. Total fentanyl concentration was determined by radioimmunoassay in 11 pairs of first trimester maternal serum and fetal coelomic <b>fluid</b> <b>samples,</b> 14 pairs of maternal serum and amniotic <b>fluid</b> <b>samples,</b> seven series of first trimester maternal serum and coelomic and amniotic <b>fluid</b> <b>samples,</b> and 10 series of early second trimester maternal and fetal sera and amniotic <b>fluid</b> <b>samples.</b> Fentanyl was not detected in coelomic <b>fluid</b> <b>samples</b> at any gestational age and in amniotic <b>fluid</b> <b>samples</b> collected after 12 weeks of gestation. Measurable concentrations of fentanyl were found in maternal serum collected within 15 min after the initial bolus and in fetal serum collected between 10 and 12 min later.

The distribution of this molecule inside the early gestational sac is probably influenced by the increased binding by maternal and fetal sera, its short half-life of distribution and the specific biology of the fetal fluid formation and composition.
