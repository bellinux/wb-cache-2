5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} the storm, Congress appointed a bipartisan committee to investigate the response to Hurricane <b>Katrina</b> <b>and</b> the preparations prior to its landfall. The committee concluded that the forecasts given by the National Weather Service were timely, were not responsible for failures in other agencies, and were likely responsible for saving thousands of lives that would have otherwise {{been lost in the}} raging hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Initially the {{depression}} was forecast to move ashore as a minimal tropical storm, {{and the threat}} of {{the depression}} prompted state of emergency declarations in Mississippi and Louisiana. It was the first tropical cyclone to threaten the New Orleans area since Hurricane <b>Katrina</b> <b>and</b> the destructive 2005 hurricane season. Overall impact from the cyclone was minor and largely limited to light rainfall. However, the precursor system spawned a damaging tornado in Eustis, Florida, where 20houses were destroyed and 30more were damaged.|$|E

He then rides to Hell, taking her with a smile, fulfilling her end of the deal with the Devil. Crane returns home to New York City with <b>Katrina</b> <b>and</b> Young Masbath, {{just in time for}} the new century.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm, the United Nations {{deployed}} {{field assessment}} teams {{to survey the}} damage caused by Katrina. The International Organization for Migration helped relocate affected families and construct at least 300 new residences for victims of <b>Katrina</b> <b>and</b> Hurricane Mitch the year prior. The Pan American Health Organization also deployed assessment teams to survey the area for the possibility of post-storm diseases. Due to the lack of any significant damage, the name Katrina was not retired and was re-used in the 2005 season; however, due to the catastrophic damage caused by the storm, it was retired in 2006 and was replaced with the name Katia.|$|E

5|$|On November8, Lafourche Parish, Louisiana president, Charlotte Randolph, {{declared}} a state of emergency for the parish as the storm approached the United States Gulf Coast. Although no evacuations were issued, all schools and government offices were closed through November10. Voluntary evacuations were issued for residents in Plaquemines Parish along coastal areas. The Belle Chasse Auditorium was converted into a shelter to house evacuees for the duration of the storm. Grand Isle mayor David Carmadelle issued voluntary evacuation orders for residents in recreational vehicles and trailers on the island. Nearly 1,400 families still living in temporary FEMA homes in Louisiana, in the wake of Hurricanes <b>Katrina</b> <b>and</b> Rita, were urged to stay at home.|$|E
5|$|The season officially {{began on}} June1, 2005, and lasted until November30, {{although}} it effectively persisted into January2006 due to continued storm activity. A record twenty-eight tropical and subtropical storms formed, {{of which a}} record fifteen became hurricanes. Of these, a record-tying seven strengthened into major hurricanes, a record-tying five became Category4 hurricanes and a record four reached Category5 strength, the highest categorization for hurricanes on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Among these Category5 storms were hurricanes <b>Katrina</b> <b>and</b> Wilma, respectively the second costliest and the most intense (by lowest pressure) Atlantic hurricanes on record. This season was also notable because the list of storm names was used up and six Greek letter names had to be used.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Hurricane <b>Katrina</b> <b>and</b> the {{subsequent}} 2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans, the congregation's building at 7000 Canal Boulevard filled with at least ten feet of water, and Beth Israel garnered national attention after {{attempts were made to}} save its Torah scrolls. Beth Israel's rabbi, Yisroel Shiff, who had evacuated to Tennessee before Katrina hit, contacted Rabbi Isaac Leider, who had worked on ZAKA search-and-rescue teams in Israel for five years. After contacting federal officials and the Louisiana National Guard, Leider hired a helicopter to fly him to within a mile of Beth Israel, met with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) search-and-rescue team appointed to retrieve the scrolls. The group used rubber rafts to reach Beth Israel and enter it, where Leider waded into the sanctuary and rescued the Torah scrolls and their silver ornaments.|$|E

5|$|Before the 2006 election, Hastert {{expressed}} his intent to seek reelection as Speaker if the Republicans maintained {{control of the}} House. Hastert was reelected for an eleventh term to his seat in the House with nearly 60 percent of the vote, but that year the Republicans lost control of both the Senate and the House to the Democrats following a wave of voter discontent with the Iraq War, the Federal response to Hurricane <b>Katrina,</b> <b>and</b> a series of scandals among congressional Republicans. The day after the November election, Hastert announced he would not seek to become minority leader when the 110th Congress convened in January 2007. Later that month, John Boehner of Ohio defeated Mike Pence of Indiana in a 168-27 vote of the House Republican Conference election to become minority leader for the 110th Congress. The House Democratic Caucus unanimously selected House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to be Speaker (succeeding Hastert) for the 110th Congress.|$|E
5|$|By {{the morning}} of October29, a {{tropical}} wave, tracking towards the west, began {{to interact with the}} depression and leading to forecasters discussing a possible merger of the two systems. An upper-level anticyclone over the eastern Caribbean produced significant wind shear over the depression, preventing the center from moving under the deep convection. However, a large convective banding feature developed {{to the north of the}} system. Several hours later, hurricane hunters flew through the storm and recorded surface winds of 40mph (65km/h) and a barometric pressure of 999mbar (hPa; 29.5inHg), leading to the upgrade of the depression to a tropical storm. At this time, the storm received the name <b>Katrina</b> <b>and</b> peaked in intensity. By 0000UTC on October30, the center of Katrina made landfall near Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua at peak intensity. Within three hours, the storm weakened to a depression due to interaction with the mountains of Nicaragua and convection was limited to a small area on the western side of the center of circulation.|$|E
