Between 1994 and 2009 the US market recorded a wave of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) due {{to a change in}} legislation. To illustrate and price exchange options, we extend the Margrabe (1978) model by looking at the impact of internal and external funding and the effect of stochastic volatilities and jumps in M&A pricing.

40|$|Using a {{complete}} market equilibrium model, we present results concerning the effect disagreement has on equilibrium option trading volume and positioning. We find that if agents agree on volatility, total option volume {{is independent of}} wealth distribution and average optimism. We also <b>find</b> <b>option</b> volume increasing in drift disagreement and decreasing in risk aversion and volatility. Pessimists are shown to write most options. With volatility disagreement, the results are less clear; however, we show agents with high volatility beliefs write deep {{out of the money}} options and buy close to the money options.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the information content of stock option exercises versus regular insider share trades by corporate executives. We {{argue that the}} asymmetric payoff structure of options makes managerial wealth - compared to holdings of shares - relatively more sensitive to stock price changes and more likely induces opportunistic behaviour. Consistent with our predictions, we <b>find</b> <b>option</b> exercises followed by share liquidations are associated with disappointing future earnings news, while sales of previously held shares are not. In addition, liquidation exercises of deep in-the-money options are associated with larger income-increasing abnormal accruals, signalling lower quality earnings. On the buy side, we find that regular insider share purchases are associated with positive future earnings news while purchases through option conversions are not. This research has implications for investors, compensation committees, and future research on corporate insider trades. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the impact of market {{activity}} on the percentage bid-ask spreads of S&P 100 index options using transaction data. We propose a new market microstructure theory called a derivative hedge theory, in which option market percentage spreads will be inversely related to the option market maker's ability to hedge his positions in the underlying market, as measured by the liquidity of this underlying market. In a perfect hedge world, spreads arise from the illiquidity of the underlying market, rather than from inventory risk or informed trading in the option market itself. We estimate three models to investigate various market microstructure theories. In the static model, option spreads are a function of moneyness, time to maturity, option prices, hedge ratios and volatility. The dynamic model includes time between trades or duration and average volume per transaction while the cross-market model adds cross option market activity and spreads in the underlying market. We <b>find</b> <b>option</b> market volume is not a significant determinant of option market spreads, which challenges the validity of volume as a proxy for liquidity and supports my theory. Option market spreads are positively related to spreads in the underlying market, again supporting our theory. However, option market duration does affect option market spreads, with very slow and very fast option markets both leading to bigger spreads. Only the fast market result would be predicted by asymmetric information theory. Inventory models predict big spreads in slow markets. Neither would be observed if the underlying securities market provided a perfect hedge. We interpret these mixed results to mean that the option market maker is able to only imperfectly hedge his positions in the underlying securities market. Our result of insignificant option volume casts doubt on the price discovery argument between stock and option markets (Easley, O'Hara, and Srinivas (1997)). Asymmetric information costs in either market are naturally passed to the other market by market maker's hedging and therefore it is unimportant where the informed traders trade...|$|E

Hence, we seek {{an alternative to}} calibration from historical data. Formally, historical data offers constraints {{to a set of}} model options. An alterna-tive methods of generating those constraints is to augment a process model with a search engine (simulated annealing plus variable ranking) that <b>finds</b> <b>options</b> that improve the process model outputs. The improvements can be dramatic: in one of the studies in this paper, the search engine found process options that reduced the median and variance of the effort estimates by a factor of 20. In ten case studies, we show that the estimates generated in this manner can be quite accurate, despite being generated without using historical data. ...|$|R
