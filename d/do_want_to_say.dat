500|$|Relations {{between the}} Olympians and the Australian Government {{remained}} tense {{after months of}} political struggle regarding the boycott. The quartet did not receive the customary congratulations from Fraser, who initially resisted complaints the next day from the media and government members at his failure to applaud the Australian victory. In a radio interview, he said [...] "I hope that circumstances do not arise {{over the next few}} years which will cause them to have very great regrets about the fact that they've gone". Fraser relented and late in the night, his office sent a telegram indirectly, through the Australian Embassy in Moscow. Fraser had ordered the Australian diplomatic mission to shun the Olympians, so the embassy staff had to pass the envelopes containing the message through the Olympic Village fence. Fraser's telegram said: [...] "You know I did not and do not approve of Australia being represented at these Olympic Games. I <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> however that your performance in the relay was a truly great sporting achievement. My personal congratulations."

I see now that I might have made you sorry to part with me, if I had tried to make you love me more. It's too late now, but I'm not too proud to confess when I'm wrong. I want to part kindly; I ask your pardon; I {{thank you for all}} you've done for me, and I say good-bye affectionately now." ...|$|E

I'm not afraid in it, even out here on the dark dunes--which Aunt Emma wouldn't--somehow--approve! But I do want to be fair to you, and I'm afraid I'm not, when I let you love me this way. I don't want to hurt you. Ever. Perhaps it's egotistical of me, but I'm afraid you would be hurt if I let you kiss me and then {{afterward}} I decided I didn't love you at all." ...|$|E

5000|$|Evans' win {{elicited}} much {{celebration in}} his home nation with calls for a national holiday as his win was {{compared to that of}} the 1983 America's Cup which was considered Australia's greatest sporting achievement. Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard personally phoned to congratulate Evans saying that [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> a very big congratulations to Cadel Evans.

Walsh initially denied, then admitted to the allegations, but stated {{that it was not}} done intentionally.

Wright introduced a debate on Knox's future with an on-screen caption headed [...] "Foxy Knoxy: Would Ya?" [...] and told viewers: [...] "She's entirely innocent. She's also undeniably fit and loves wild sex. Or did. So if you were a guy who'd met her in a bar and she invited you back to hers, would you go?" [...] Wright apologised for the segment the following day, stating: [...] "While I'm not going to apologise for discussing Amanda Knox's future after all the terrible things the media has said about her these past four years, I <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> sorry for the way I framed the debate.

If I appeared there, what if I did an imitation of a butterfly at rest? There is no crime in making anybody laugh ... I don't care if you laugh at me.MR. JACKSON: If your interpretation of a butterfly at rest brought any money into the coffers of the Communist Party, you contributed directly to the propaganda effort of the Communist Party.MR.

40|$|We first want {{to express}} our thanks to the {{commentators}} for their close and critical readings of The Phenomenological Mind. We would like to treat their comments and challenging questions as a productive opportunity to clarify and to make our positions more precise. Before we address the specific points raised by our colleagues, we <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the intersection between phenomenology and the cognitive sciences is a rich one, and growing richer as collaboration and research continues. Our book {{was meant to be}} an introduction to this area rather than a complete map of ongoing research. For that reason {{we were not able to}} cover every interesting issue, many of which are raised in the set of commentaries. 1. Phenomenology as a method Regarding the scope of our book, one of the issues raised by Andrew Brook is to what extent the phenomenological approach we endorse and adopt is overly biased towards a Husserlian and Merleau-Pontyan understanding of phenomenology or whether it really captures something that is common to the phenomenological tradition. We certainly don’t want to deny that phenomenology has in many ways developed as...|$|E

50|$|In India, this {{particular}} headshake {{can also be}} acknowledgement or encouragement. In the Western world, people often use a nod for the same purpose.
