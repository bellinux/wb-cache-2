50|$|Serbian hip hop {{started in}} the early 80's, {{with the birth of}} b-boy crews and their battles which have spread over the country in no time. The first sound {{recording}} of the Serbian hip hop is the Degout EP by the band named The Master Scratch Band, which was released through Jugoton in the year 1984. - 5-tracker presenting b-boy electro-breakbeat tracks with a bit of rapping. In the late 80's, bands such are Budweiser, Green Kool Posse, Who Is The Best and Robin Hood started the first demo scene. The music spread slowly until 1995, when the first significant album was released: Da li imaš pravo? by Gru. This release {{marked the beginning of the}} first wave of Serbian hip hop, which reached its peak in 1997-98, when many new groups started to break out from the underground: Voodoo Popeye, Full Moon, Straight Jackin, Sunshine, Bad Copy, Belgrade Ghetto, CYA, 187. Monteniggers, from Montenegro (at the time in a union with Serbia), were another popular rap group. Just as the scene was taking off, the flood of new talent slowed to a trickle, probably due to the economic effects of the Kosovo War of 1999, which resulted in only a few hip hop albums released in 1999-2001. However, in 2002 the silence was shown to be temporary with the founding of the Bassivity label, which made Serbian, Bosnian and Croatian hip hop widely available in record stores.

During the 2014 research, which {{was carried out in}} spite of extremely adverse weather conditions, a series of new digs from both prehistoric settlements was discovered. There are particularly interesting remains of a larger, irregular, Late Bronze building which were fully explored.

Since 1997 Institute for Archaeology {{has been}} {{systematically}} excavating the Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age settlement in Nova Bukovica, at the Sjenjak site. So far a surface of almost 1800 m 2 has been unearthed, with sunken buildings which were {{parts of the}} infrastructure of the Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age settlement. An extremely signiﬁcant ﬁnd {{within the context of}} the Bronze Age settlement are the remains of the building above ground (House 1) with a storage pit inside the building, whereas in the structure of the La Téne settlement numerous canals of different sizes stand out. During excavations in 2004 it was noted that the canals probably mark the borders of the La Téne settlement, and that close to them there are pits with heavily packed ﬁlling, almost without moveable archaeological ﬁnds, which at present we have interpreted as clay extraction pits. The movable archaeological ﬁnds from 2004 conﬁrm the earlier dating of the La Téne settlement (purple glass armlet), whereas in one of the La Téne pits, along with certain other still undetermined iron artifacts, iron dross appears. In addition to bronze dross lumps from the Late Bronze Age facilities, this is additional proof of metallurgy at the archaeological site in Nova Bukovica...|$|E

Notwithstanding {{the fact}} that this year 2 ̆ 7 s {{research}} was somewhat reduced due to unfavourable weather conditions, the eight season of systematic archaeological investigations allowed us to define another refuse pit (the first was investigated in 2012) and another larger space, in □ G/F 6 - 8, used as a dump for kiln refuse (charcoal). However, the finds suggest that this was also a place for the waste created during the repairs of the kiln, as well as during the firing of pottery. A similar situation was observed in 2011 in □ H 11. The primary and cabinet processing of finds, carried out intensively in the museum depository over a ten-day period, marked a significant leap forward in the processing of the site assemblage. Due to the abundance of the assemblage, which presently amounts to dozens of tons, the processing of finds is slow and lags behind fieldwork. This year 2 ̆ 7 s work on the finds enabled us to finish the cabinet processing of finds from the 2009 campaign, the processing of 2. 3 tons of finds from 2010, and the primary processing of the finds from the 2012 season...|$|E

The size and appearance of the structure suggest that {{it used to be a}} provision pit, and the abundance of moveable archaeological items dates it into the Late Bronze Age. The size and ground-plan of the structure recall the large pit, SU 318, excavated in 1998 (Kovačević 2001) in which large broken pithoi and a small bronze lance were discovered. The location of the structure within a Late Bronze Age settlement is also interesting, since pit SU 997, 998 lies only several metres north of pit dwelling SU 979, 980 excavated in the 2007 season.

In 2007, {{as in the}} {{previous}} years, the Institute of Archaeology in Zagreb continued systematic archaeological excavations of the settlements from the Late Bronze and Early Iron Ages in Nova Bukovica on the Senjak site in Podravina, south-east from Slatina. The excavations were continued on the same cadastre plot as in {{the previous}} years, on the southern slope of an elevation, east from the area on which in the previous years we found rectangular above-earth structures (5 in all) and a cattle pen, all from the La Tène period. In the course of explorations we discovered a number of new archaeological structures, among which the most numerous continue to be pillar holes. However, among the structures explored this year, of special importance is a pit dwelling of a simple, irregularly circular ground plan, with a trough-shaped bottom which deepens in the north-eastern part (Fig. 1). In its backfill we found characteristic material, among which there is a profiled, deep bowl decorated with vertical ribs and lines of warts on the widest part of the body (Fig. 2). The pit dwelling belongs to the Late Bronze Age and is the first such object explored on Sjenjak. Likewise, this year we had finds of waste pits, especially those with finds of Late La Tène culture. These are larger, deeper pits with an abundance of finds (a whetstone, rustic pottery, highly profiled edges of vessels…). Among other finds, along with a lot of mostly rough, home use pottery, we should single out a renewed find of lumps of slag, stone masticator, ceramic whorls and one beautifully preserved bronze ring with closed ends reminding of a temporal ornament...|$|E

The team surveyed the sites known from the literature and from previous research, but also those pointed out by informants. All the sites were mapped, that is, their GPS coordinates were taken. In addition to sites, the positions of chance finds were documented, too, as well as individual recognizable structures observed on the sites. Alongside the mapping of immovable finds, movable finds and samples were collected.

Sondiranjima je potvrđeno postojanje lokaliteta, te su prikupljeni nalazi koji će pomoći prilikom njegova užeg kulturno-kronološkog određenja. In September 2007 a {{team from}} the Institute of Archaeology {{organized}} and conducted trial-trenching on the Torčec-Međuriče site in Podravina, north-east of Koprivnica. The site itself is 1500 m northwest from the centre of Torčec, west of the road that leads from Torčec to Đelekovec, in the centre of lowlands well permeated by water currents. According to the concentration of the ploughed-up material – the information we received from amateur archaeologists, the Zvijerac brothers – we decided to place two trial trenches in the east-west direction, across the entire width of the chosen fields. The trenches had approximately the same dimensions. The trench 1 / 2007 (S- 1) was 16 m long and approximately 4 m wide, while the trench further to the north was 15 m long and 5 m wide. One {{of the most important}} results of this year’s explorations in Torčec is the confirmation that in the Međuriče region there exists, albeit heavily damaged by intensive agriculture, a settlement from the Early Iron Age (pillar holes, pits, characteristic pottery of the developed phase of the Early Iron Age), and it seems from the Middle Ages as well (skeleton in a crouched position?). We managed to collect the samples, which was of utmost importance, and a characteristic archaeological material which in the analysis will join the previously collected surface finds. At this stage we cannot say much about the layout of the settlement itself, as the trialtrenching was limited in scope and duration, and it was not our primary aim to determine the infrastructure of the settlement. However, it can be concluded from a preliminary inspection of the archaeological material that the Torčec site on the Međuriče position clearly belongs to the group of Early Iron Age settlements in Podravina, the other such settlements being Farkašić “P”, Sigetec, Sv. Petar Ludbreški, Zbelava and many others (Marković 1982; Vinski-Gasparini 1987; Šimek 1982; Kovačević 2007 b, Registar 1997) ...|$|E

In the research 2006, a range of new archaeological objects were discovered, among which the remains of an over-ground object with an irregular ground plan − Object 1 − (Fig. 1.) are to be mentioned in particular. The object {{is placed in the}} immediate proximity of rectangular hut alike objects (5 in number), which had been explored in the previous years. The newly discovered object is assumed to have functioned as a livestock pen. Object 1 in the south has a round part with the diameter of about 4 m, which is prolonged in the direction of north-south and southwest-northeast into two series of columns, balustrades, {{in the shape of a}} crater. Most of the post hols which form the object are of a similar diameter (about 40 cm) and of a similar depth (about 20 cm). The low depth of some of the objects is a direct consequence of permanent damagings of the site on grounds of intensive husbandry. Besides the above mentioned, a more considerable appearance of waste pits from the period of the Late Bronze Age as well as some which culturally belong to the Late La Tène (Fig. 2.), is to be pointed out. Two rather deep (around 2 m depth) and rather narrow cylindrical pits, covered with several earth fills, should be mentioned in particular, because they were rich in finds, in the first place hand made La Tène ceramics. Among other finds, the repeated find of cinder clumps is to be mentioned, which points to certain metallurgic activity within the settlement in Nova Bukovica; as well as a dark blue glass bracelet fragment from the Late La Tène, which is of chronological importance...|$|E

We focused on a semi-annual period of time from 01. 01. 2013 to 06. 30. 2013, where we define what was discussed during emergency situations, how emergencies are separated by sex, with which emergency situations we encountered and where patients are directed to follow treatment. Information were acquired, with the permission of the executives in Health Centre Trbovlje from the program database IRIS...|$|E

Cilj projekta je bil zahtevnemu trgu predstaviti in v uporabo ponuditi prikolico, ki bo na potovanjih in oddihih ponujala vso dostopnost in razkošje doma. Da bi se kar se da približali temu, je bila <b>ekipa,</b> zadolžena za razvoj (razvojniki, tehnologi, nabavniki in prodajniki), pred številnimi izzivi, ki so ovirali razvoj. Iskali smo možnosti za izboljšavo stare serije modela Alpine ter uvajali nove elemente in karoserijske materiale ob upoštevanju dizajna izdelka. Sodobni končni kupci so vse bolj zahtevni in pričakujejo vse več dodatne opreme, zato je bila poseben izziv majhna dovoljena skupna teža. Naloga je bila vse prej kot preprosta, a na koncu smo zadostili vsem potrebam in tudi predpisom. Pri vgrajevanju novih sestavin smo naleteli na številne ovire. Vseh želja in smernic, začrtanih na začetku, ni bilo moč izpolniti. Ključno vlogo pri trdnosti karoserije so prevzeli elementi, s katerimi smo zamenjali zdaj vgrajeni smrekov les. Pri načrtovanju razvoja smo upoštevali dejavnike krčenja gozda, zato smo les nadomestili s poliuretanom in aluminijastimi vložki. S tem se je spremenila tudi sestava oz. montaža karoserije v celoto. Poiskati je bilo treba nova orodja in elemente za sestavo. Zamenjali smo lepila, vijake, materiale, ki zagotavljajo tesnjenje, ter način izdelave. In {{the thesis}} I {{researched}} and established course of {{development for the}} new luxury class caravans, Alpine. The aim {{of the project was}} to present to the contemporary demanding market a trailer, which can offer the all-embracing accessibility and luxury of the home to the modern traveller. In order to make this possible, the development team (developers, technologists, purchasers and salespeople) got exposed to a number of challenges, which were impeding the progress. We were looking for alternatives to improve the old model Alpine, {{and at the same time}} we have introduced new elements, as well as new bodywork material, with the focus on the product design. Since the demands the modern consumers are increasing, and they request more accessories, we were faced with the shortage of the total available weight. The problems were anything but simple, but we managed to fulfil all the needs and requirements. When installing new component materials we have encountered certain resistance and obstacles. In the beginning, the guidelines and desires were set, of which not all could be accepted and carried out. A key role in the strength of the body has taken elements that have replaced the currently installed spruce. When planning the progress we took into account deforestation factors, so we replaced the wood with polyurethane and aluminium inserts, thus also changing the composition and assembling of the body into a whole unit. It was necessary to find new tools and composition elements. We replaced the adhesive, screws, materials that provide sealing and the method of manufacture itself...|$|E
