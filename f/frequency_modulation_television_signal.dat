Measuring levels of exposure to electromagnetic radiation at three chosen locations in the city considered to be sensitive did not reveal that exposure limits were being exceeded. Mobile phone, modulated amplitude emission, <b>frequency</b> <b>modulation</b> and <b>television</b> bands installed at the sites several years ago were also measured. Levels ob-tained from electric field strength exceeded 100 dBuV / m in all cases, maximum value being 139 dBuV / m. Levels were well below exposure limits established by the K- 52 rule. The highest levels for the general public’s exposure were 1. 74964 % in the AM band and 0. 006408 % for the cellular band between 869 and 894 MHz. This article also contains a description of the modules, exposure limits, acquisition and geo-positioning using the EspecVIEW tool designed for performing several types of measurements by Ministry officials and used in this study...|$|R

The author, a law school {{professor}} at Columbia University on leave at the Federal Trade Commission when the book was published, reviews the history of the telegraph, telephone, movies, radio (amplitude <b>modulation</b> [AM] and <b>frequency</b> <b>modulation</b> [FM]), and <b>television</b> (broadcast and cable) industries. In all of these, he finds a recurring pattern, a cycle in which the industry begins in a state of chaos with many entrepreneurs competing for the right to provide peoplewith the means of receiving and/or sending information. The chaos period is short-lived and eventually a monopoly, or very tight oligopoly, emerges to dominate the industry (i. e., control the master switch), retaining its power until technology produces the means of its decline. The Master Switch should be of interest to the readers of this journal. Not only is the Internet the central feature of the evolving market but also is itself an evolving form (think cloud) that influences the creation and destruction of almost every marketing institution.

40|$|Abstract—Different from {{traditional}} Fourier analysis, a signal can be decomposed into amplitude and <b>frequency</b> <b>modulation</b> components. The speech processing strategy in most modern cochlear implants only extracts and encodes amplitude modulation {{in a limited}} number of frequency bands. While amplitude modulation encoding has allowed cochlear implant users to achieve good speech recognition in quiet, their performance in noise is severely compromised. Here, we propose a novel speech processing strategy that encodes both amplitude and <b>frequency</b> <b>modulations</b> in order to improve cochlear implant performance in noise. By removing the center frequency from the subband signals and additionally limiting the frequency modulation’s range and rate, the present strategy transforms the fast-varying temporal fine structure into a slowly varying <b>frequency</b> <b>modulation</b> signal. As a first step, we evaluated the potential contribution of additional <b>frequency</b> <b>modulation</b> to speech recognition in noise via acoustic simulations of the cochlear implant. We found that while amplitude modulation from {{a limited number of}} spectral bands is sufficient to support speech recognition in quiet, <b>frequency</b> <b>modulation</b> is needed to support speech recognition in noise.
