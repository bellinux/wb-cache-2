5|$|Hybrids are not {{as might}} be {{expected}} always intermediate between their parents (as if there were blending inheritance), but are sometimes stronger than either parent variety, a phenomenon called heterosis, hybrid vigour, or heterozygote advantage. This is most common with plant hybrids. A transgressive phenotype is a phenotype that displays more extreme characteristics than either of the parent lines. Plant breeders use several techniques to produce hybrids, including line breeding and the formation of complex hybrids. An economically important example is <b>hybrid</b> <b>maize</b> (corn), which provides a considerable seed yield advantage over open pollinated varieties. Hybrid seed dominates the commercial maize seed market in the United States, Canada and many other major maize-producing countries.|$|E
25|$|Before the 1980s, smallholders grew local, open-pollinated {{types of}} maize, using seed {{reserved}} from previous crops. With adequate rain, this needed 80 to 120 days to develop fully. The <b>hybrid</b> <b>maize</b> {{introduced in the}} 1980s, ripened after as little as 75 days in similar conditions with sufficient fertilizer. Local maize benefited from fertilizer, but <b>hybrid</b> <b>maize</b> yielded up to 4 tonnes per hectare only if sufficient fertilizer was applied. Growing <b>hybrid</b> <b>maize</b> required reasonable sale prices and low fertilizer costs for farmers.

25|$|Maize {{breeding}} in prehistory {{resulted in}} large plants producing large ears. Modern breeding began with individuals who selected highly productive varieties {{in their fields}} and then sold seed to other farmers. James L.

The objectives were to: (i) characterize <b>maize</b> <b>hybrids</b> from different periods by RAPD markers; (ii) analyze temporal changes in genetic diversity among <b>maize</b> <b>hybrids.</b> Twenty-four <b>maize</b> <b>hybrids</b> were chosen from breeding programs in Maize Research Institute “Zemun Polje” {{on the basis of their}} superior yield and predominant seed production throughout four Periods.

25|$|The partial {{privatisation}} left ADMARC {{with limited}} funds to supply fertilizer and seed to smallholders, and {{the closure of}} many of its depots hindered distribution. Credit was also tightened and from 1988 until 1992 (when donors funded alternatives) smallholders had little access to credit. An increase in maize producer prices in 1988 did not compensate farmers who had previously grown <b>hybrid</b> <b>maize</b> for their lost subsidies, so many reverted to growing local maize. After privatisation had increased competition, ADMARC reduced its maize sales, but by 1988 it had to support over 500,000 Mozambican refugees, and could not replenish its stocks from the poor harvests of the late 1980s. Its weakness led to increased consumer prices and reduced food security.|$|E
25|$|When Malawi’s {{agricultural}} sector was liberalised, {{it was expected}} that the role of the parastatal ADMARC would be taken over by private traders, and that the private sector would create an efficient marketing system that would stimulate the use of fertilizer and <b>hybrid</b> <b>maize,</b> which in turn would lead to expanded distribution networks. Liberalisation, it was hoped, would create an efficient and responsive private sector marketing system that would stimulate agricultural production. In Malawi, the withdrawal of ADMARC from most areas contributed to widespread food insecurity among smallholder farmers, especially those in remote areas. To fill up the vacuum created following the withdrawal of ADMARC, the Ministry of Agriculture launched a development programme to train agro-dealers preferably rural shop owners. This started in 2001 with financial support from the USAID, but the programme had limited success as the majority of those trained ceased to be active agro-dealers within a few years of training, and most continuing agro-dealers were not rural based small-businessmen, as to start a successful dealing business required more capital than these possessed.|$|E
25|$|Land {{reform in}} Zimbabwe officially began in 1980 with {{the signing of}} the Lancaster House Agreement, as an effort to more equitably {{distribute}} land between black subsistence farmers and white Zimbabweans of European ancestry, who had traditionally enjoyed superior political and economic status. The programme's targets were intended to alter the ethnic balance of land ownership. Inequalities in land ownership were inflated by a growing overpopulation problem, depletion of over-utilised tracts, and escalating poverty in subsistence areas parallel with the under-utilisation of land on commercial farms. However, the predominantly white commercial sector also provided a livelihood for over 30% of the paid workforce and accounted for some 40% of exports. Its principal crops included sugarcane, coffee, cotton, tobacco, and several varieties of high-yield <b>hybrid</b> <b>maize.</b> Both the commercial farms and the subsistence sector maintained large cattle herds, but over 60% of domestic beef was furnished by the former. In sharp contrast, the life of typical subsistence farmers was difficult, and their labour poorly rewarded.
