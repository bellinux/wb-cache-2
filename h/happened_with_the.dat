5|$|On 1 October 2013, in Celtic's second UEFA Champions League {{match of}} the group stage against Barcelona, Brown kicked out at Neymar and was sent off in the 59th minute. The sending off <b>happened</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> game at 0–0 and shortly after Brown's dismissal, Cesc Fàbregas would score the only goal of the game to give Barcelona a 1–0 victory.|$|E
5|$|On June 9, 2010, the MTO {{approved}} the extension as far east as Simcoe Street in Oshawa, announcing plans to phase {{construction of the}} extension. Local residents and politicians rejected the plan, as had <b>happened</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> section between McCowan Road and Markham Road. A motion was proposed in the Ontario Legislature to build the full extension in one project, but failed to pass. Instead, a compromise was issued on March 10, 2011: the first phase would extend Highway407 to Harmony Road in Oshawa by 2015, including Highway412; the second phase would then complete the extension to Highway35/ 115 by 2020, including Highway418.|$|E
5|$|Richard named Geoffrey Archbishop of York on 20 July 1189, {{within days}} of taking the throne; the formal {{election}} took place on 10 August. What <b>happened</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> vacant archbishopric of York after Richard took the throne, and why, {{as well as the}} exact chronology of events, is complicated by the contradictory nature of the main contemporary accounts. Gerald of Wales states that Geoffrey was reluctant to accept York, but another chronicler, Benedict of Peterborough relates that Geoffrey quickly took control of the archiepiscopal estates. However the election occurred, Geoffrey's consecration did not take place until much later, and soon after his election, he either resigned or was stripped of his office of Chancellor. A further complication was that the cathedral chapter had earlier elected the Dean of York, Hubert Walter, as archbishop.|$|E

5|$|The iPad 2 {{supports}} iOS 8 {{which was}} released on September 17, 2014, making it the first iOS device to support 5 major versions of iOS (including iOS 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8). While the device is still supported, {{most of the new}} features of the software are not supported due to relatively aged hardware and therefore, is limited in terms of performance. Users have also reported numerous problems after receiving the update including the accessibility features and battery-related issues. Many users predicted that the iPad 2 was going to be dropped from updating to iOS 8 along with the iPhone 4, the same process that <b>happened</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> iPhone 3GS and the iPod Touch (fourth generation) and earlier models, considering that it has been supported for more than 3 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of the first effective anti-aircraft missiles by the late 1950s changed this picture dramatically. Missiles could stand ready for immediate launch, eliminating operational delays like {{the time needed to}} get the pilot into the cockpit of a fighter. Guidance did not require wide-area tracking or calculation of an intercept course: a simple comparison of the time needed to fly to the altitude of the target returned the required deflection. Missiles also had greater altitude capability than any aircraft, and improving this to adapt to new aircraft was a low-cost development path. The US was aware of Soviet work in the field, and had reduced the expected operational lifetime of the U-2, knowing that it would become vulnerable to these missiles as they were improved. This later <b>happened</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 1960 downing of the U-2 flown by Gary Powers.|$|E
5|$|The Persian {{strategy}} for 480 BC was probably to simply progress through Greece in overwhelming force. The cities in any territory {{that the army}} passed through {{would be forced to}} submit or risk destruction; and indeed this <b>happened</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Thessalian, Locrian and Phocian cities who initially resisted the Persians but then were forced to submit as the Persians advanced. Conversely, the Allied strategy was probably to try and stop the Persian advance as far north as possible, and thus prevent the submission of as many potential Allies as possible. Beyond this, the Allies seem to have realised that given the Persians' overwhelming numbers, they had little chance in open battle, and thus they opted to try to defend geographical bottle-necks, where the Persian numbers would count for less. The whole Allied campaign for 480 BC can be seen in this context. Initially they attempted to defend the Tempe pass to prevent the loss of Thessaly. After they realised that they could not defend this position, they chose the next-most northerly position, the Thermopylae/Artemisium axis. The Allied performance at Thermopylae was initially effective; however, the failure to properly guard the path that outflanked Thermopylae undermined their strategy, and led to defeat. At Artemisium the fleet also scored some successes, but withdrew due to the losses they had sustained, and since the defeat of Thermopylae made the position irrelevant. Thus far, the Persian strategy had succeeded, while the Allied strategy, though not a disaster, had failed.|$|E

5|$|Vito Spatafore is outed as {{homosexual}} {{after running}} into {{a friend at}} a New York gay night club. The rumor spreads quickly, and once word gets to Meadow that everyone else knows, she tells Tony and Carmela about the incident between Finn and Vito with the security guard. Finn then has to {{sit in front of}} Tony's entire crew and tell them what <b>happened</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> guard, solidifying their thoughts on Vito's sexuality. Tony is urged {{to deal with the problem}} by Phil Leotardo, now acting boss of New York with Johnny Sack in prison. Once Vito is outed, he runs away from the city and hides out in a New Hampshire town where he claims to be writing a book and meets with the locals. Vito also starts a romantic relationship with a male cook at a local diner. Eventually, Vito returns to New Jersey and asks Tony to allow him to return to work, albeit in Atlantic City. He continues to maintain that he is not a homosexual. Tony mulls over the decision to let him work, as well as whether to let him live. When Tony fails to act, Phil intervenes and kills Spatafore. When one of the members of the New York family, Fat Dom Gamiello, pays a visit to the Jersey office and won't stop making jokes about Vito and his death, the two members of Tony's crime family who are present kill Fat Dom out of anger at the disrespect he has shown. Once more, it appears that the families are on the verge of all-out war.|$|E

25|$|The {{next major}} {{eruption}} (volume 62.6km3) created large voids inside the volcano, {{which led to}} the collapse of the apex and the formation of the caldera.

The products of this eruption mostly consisted of ignimbrites (c. 58.2km3). Thus the collapse of the cone occurred gradually, probably in three stages.|$|E
