25|$|First Orbit is a feature-length {{documentary}} film about Vostok 1, the first manned space flight around the Earth. By matching {{the orbit of}} the International Space Station to that of Vostok 1 as closely as possible, in terms of <b>ground</b> <b>path</b> and time of day, {{documentary film}}maker Christopher Riley and ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli were able to film the view that Yuri Gagarin saw on his pioneering orbital space flight. This new footage was cut together with the original Vostok 1 mission audio recordings sourced from the Russian State Archive. Nespoli, during Expedition 26/27, filmed {{the majority of the}} footage for this documentary film, and as a result is credited as its director of photography. The film was streamed through the website firstorbit.org in a global YouTube premiere in 2011, under a free license.|$|E

2500|$|This lack of {{difference}} between these two states, their non-dual (advaya) nature, corresponds with the idea that change from one to another doesn't happen due to an ordinary process of causation but is an instantaneous and perfect 'self-recognition' (rang ngo sprod) of what is already innately (lhan-skyes) there. According to John W. Pettit, this idea has its roots in Indian texts such as Nagarjuna's Mulamadhyamakakarika, which states that samsara and nirvana are not separate and that there is no difference between the [...] "doer", the [...] "going" [...] and the [...] "going to" [...] (i.e. the <b>ground,</b> <b>path</b> and fruit).|$|E

50|$|Ground bounce {{can also}} {{occur when the}} circuit board has poorly {{designed}} <b>ground</b> <b>paths.</b> Improper <b>ground</b> or VCC can lead to local variations in the ground level between various components.

30|$|The HVDC Flexible {{system with}} {{two-level}} or three-level converter configurations usually adopts the grounding {{point on the}} DC side, but on the AC side while the system with MMC configuration. Regardless the grounding location a monopole- symmetric system is always used for the HVDC Flexible system. During normal operating conditions, no current passes through <b>grounding</b> <b>path</b> thus it {{is no need to}} set special grounding pole, but when the DC line or converter fails, the whole system will stop running. Furthermore, it may forms a monopole asymmetric structure via <b>grounding</b> <b>path</b> or metallic return, which is similar to a pole of a traditional HVDC transmission system.|$|R
2500|$|As the Earth {{turns around}} its axis, {{everything}} {{attached to it}} turns with it (imperceptibly to our senses). An object that is moving without being dragged along with this rotation travels in a straight motion over the turning Earth. From our rotating perspective on the planet, its direction of motion changes as it moves, bending {{in the opposite direction}} to our actual motion. When viewed from a stationary point in space directly above the north pole, any land feature in the Northern Hemisphere turns anticlockwise—and, fixing our gaze on that location, any other location in that hemisphere rotates around it the same way. The traced <b>ground</b> <b>path</b> of a freely moving body travelling from one point to another therefore bends the opposite way, clockwise, which is conventionally labeled as [...] "right," [...] where it will be if the direction of motion is considered [...] "ahead," [...] and [...] "down" [...] is defined naturally.|$|E

50|$|In {{the latter}} mode, the patient must sit or lie on an {{insulated}} table, {{much as in}} the case with objects to be charged electrostatically with high-voltage D.C. (as from a Van de Graaff generator, for example). Stray <b>ground</b> <b>paths</b> between the patient and foreign conductors (such as a metal table leading somewhere to earth-ground) can offer another capacitative reservoir besides the patient, and burns out of the area of treatment may thus result, from current passing between patient and the earth-ground. For this reason, hyfrecation and all non-ground-pad electrosurgery is performed only on conscious patients, who would be aware of the burn and discomfort from an unwanted earth-ground path. (In types of electrosurgery which do employ a ground-pad, the ground-pad path serves as such a low resistance ground to the machine, that extraneous other <b>ground</b> <b>paths</b> become unimportant, and thus with proper precautions these methods can, and often are, used on anesthetized patients).|$|R

50|$|A ground {{connection}} that is missing or of inadequate capacity may {{not provide the}} protective functions as intended during a fault in the connected equipment. Extra connections between ground and circuit neutral may result in circulating current in the <b>ground</b> <b>path,</b> stray current introduced in the earth or in a structure, and stray voltage. Extra {{ground connection}}s on a neutral conductor may bypass the protection provided by a ground-fault circuit interrupter. Signal circuits that rely on a ground connection will not function or will have erratic function if the ground connection is missing.|$|E

It has disadvantage in high frequency systems, where it leads to impedance mismatch and leakage of the signal onto the shield, where it's subsequently radiated, or, symmetrically through the same mechanism, external signal is received by the shield and mixed into the desired signal.|$|E

5000|$|Create a {{break in}} the signal cable shield conductor. [...] The break should be at the load end. This is often called [...] "ground lifting".

One problem with this solution is if the other <b>ground</b> <b>path</b> to the component is removed, it will leave the component ungrounded, [...] "floating". Stray leakage currents will cause a very loud hum in the output, possibly damaging speakers. Also, since there is no return current on the cable shield, the characteristic impedance of the cable can be changed.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that statistical mechanical systems with quenched disorder can exhibit dramatically different properties than their disorder-free counterparts. The introduction of disorder can change the spatial structure of a system’s ground state or the typical behavior of the system’s free energy (or other quantities of interest). In many systems, the changes to spatial and quantitative behavior are closely linked. This dissertation explores these themes in two model disordered systems: first-passage percolation and critical percolation. In first-passage percolation, a model for paths in a random potential, {{the energy of the}} <b>ground</b> state <b>path</b> of length n is expected to fluctuate like nχ, and the <b>ground</b> state <b>path</b> is expected to deviate from a straight line by a distance of nξ. There are longstanding conjectures about the values of χ and ξ, and the relation χ = 2 ξ − 1 has recently been rigorously established. The prediction that χ < 1 / 2 (in contrast to a situation where each step of unit length contributed independently to the <b>ground</b> state <b>path’s</b> energy) is related to the existence of many “approximate ground states, ” and such techniques have prove...|$|R
