Stenhousemuir became {{the first team to}} do so in 1995, followed by Stranraer a year later in 1996 and Alloa Athletic in 1999. The most recent club to win from below the second tier was Queen of the South, in 2013. All winners and runners-up from below the second tier <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>from</b> the third tier.|$|E

5|$|D. lacustris ("of the lake") is a nomen dubium, {{named by}} Marsh in 1884 based on {{specimen}} YPM 1922 found by Arthur Lakes, {{consisting of the}} snout and upper jaw of a smaller animal from Morrison, Colorado. These remains are now believed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>from</b> an immature animal, rather than from a separate species. In 2015, {{it was concluded that}} the specimen actually belonged to Camarasaurus.|$|E

5|$|Elsewhere in the Mediterranean are pumice {{deposits}} {{that could}} have been caused by the Thera eruption. Ash layers in cores drilled from the seabed and from lakes in Turkey, however, show that the heaviest ashfall was towards the east and northeast of Santorini. The ash found on Crete is now known to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>from</b> a precursory phase of the eruption, some weeks or months before the main eruptive phases, and it would have had little impact on the island. Santorini ash deposits were at one time claimed to have been found in the Nile delta, but this is now known to be a misidentification.|$|E
5|$|Large {{sections}} of the hull plating seem to have fallen off well before the wreck hit the bottom. One such section, thought to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>from</b> the galleys, separated from the stern in one piece and landed nearby. The force of the water tore up the poop deck and folded it back on itself. The center propeller is totally buried, while {{the force of the}} impact caused the two wing propellers and shafts to be bent upwards by an angle of about 20°.|$|E
5|$|Of the 62 players {{drafted by}} the Angels, 28 have been pitchers, {{the most of any}} position; 18 of these were right-handed, while 10 were left-handed. Twelve outfielders, seven shortstops, four third basemen, and four first basemen were also taken. No second basemen have been selected. Thirteen of the players came from high schools or {{universities}} in the state of California, while Florida follows with six players. Four players have been selected from both Illinois and Georgia. All players selected <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>from</b> the United States. The franchise has made five selections in the same draft three times, in 1986, 2009, and 2010.|$|E

5|$|Sometimes {{they are}} {{referred}} to, in Latin, as magnus rotulus pipae. Several {{sources for the}} actual idea of making the rolls as rolls have been suggested, including Jews, Adelard of Bath, who was a royal clerk and was familiar with Arabic practices of using rolls, or the royal clerk Thurkil, who studied under a mathematician who may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>from</b> Sicily.|$|E
5|$|The Sendai International Music Competition is a tri-annual {{violin and}} piano music {{competition}} held in Sendai, Japan, presented {{in association with}} the Sendai International Music Competition Organizing Committee, City of Sendai and the Sendai Cultural Foundation.

Although the competition is international, most award-winners <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>from</b> either Europe or Asia. The first award-winner from outside those continents was American Sean Kennard, who finished fifth in the 2004 competition's piano category.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Tropical Storm Arthur are {{believed}} to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>from</b> a decaying cold front in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico in July 2002. By July 9, a weak low-level circulation was first detected, in association with a broad low pressure area. Across the region, surface pressures were high, while upper level wind shear was marginally favorable for slow tropical development. The system tracked slowly north-northwestward, gradually becoming better defined, although thunderstorm activity remained limited and disorganized.|$|E
5|$|The sthamba buttalikas are pillar {{images that}} show traces of Chola {{art in the}} Chalukyan touches.

The image of mohini on one of the pillars in the mantapa (closed hall) of the Chennakeshava temple is an example of Chola art.|$|E

5|$|A {{little more}} than thirty years later, in August 1964, {{paleontologist}} John Ostrom led an expedition from Yale's Peabody Museum of Natural History which discovered more skeletal material near Bridger. Expeditions during the following two summers uncovered more than 1,000 bones, among which were at least three individuals. Since the association between the various recovered bones was weak, making the exact number of individual animals represented impossible to determine properly, the type specimen (YPM 5205) of Deinonychus was restricted to the complete left foot and partial right foot that definitely belonged to the same individual. The remaining specimens were catalogued in fifty separate entries at Yale's Peabody Museum although they could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>from</b> as few as three individuals.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for Bermuda on August27 but swiftly canceled {{the next day}} as Danielle steered well clear of the island. Swells from the powerful hurricane reached the East Coast of the United States, leading to the rescues of 250 people in Ocean City, Maryland and an additional 70 people {{off the coast of}} Central Florida. The body of a man—whose death appeared to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>from</b> drowning—was pulled from the waters of Satellite Beach, Florida; a second man went missing in Ocean City, but his body was never recovered and the search was eventually called off. Researchers examining the wreckage of RMS Titanic were forced to seek refuge in St. John's, Newfoundland; swells as large as 10ft (3m) impacted the coastline of Newfoundland.|$|E

5|$|As a hadrosaurid, Prosaurolophus {{would have}} been a large herbivore, eating plants with a {{sophisticated}} skull that permitted a grinding motion analogous to chewing. Its teeth were continually replaced and packed into dental batteries that contained hundreds of teeth, only a relative handful of which were in use at any time. Plant material {{would have been}} cropped by its broad beak, and held in the jaws by a cheek-like structure. Feeding would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>from</b> the ground up to around 4meters (13ft) above. Like other hadrosaurs, it could have moved both bipedally and quadrupedally. Comparisons between the scleral rings of Prosaurolophus and modern birds and reptiles suggest that it may have been cathemeral, active throughout the day at short intervals.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{there was}} damage to two Spanish frigates: the Sabina {{was struck by}} cannon fire during the night killing one man and {{wounding}} five, {{although it was not}} determined which ship had fired on the flagship and James suggested that it may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>from</b> one of the destroyed 112-gun ships in a case of friendly fire. In addition, the Spanish 34-gun frigate Perla was seen wallowing off the North African coast of the Strait of Gibraltar on the morning of 13 July, sinking later in the day due to severe damage. How Perla came to be engaged in the action has never been explained. The ship was not part of Moreno's squadron at Algeciras and none of the British ships reported engaging a frigate during the night – during the hours of darkness Perla must have encountered the battle and become caught in the cross-fire, suffering fatal damage.|$|E
5|$|From {{the close}} of the Civil War until 1895, Kentuckians elected a series of Bourbon Democrats with Confederate sympathies as governor, {{including}} two men—James B. McCreary and Simon Bolivar Buckner—who had served in the Confederate States Army. The Democratic dominance was broken by William O'Connell Bradley, who was elected the state's first Republican governor in 1895. Bradley's election marked the beginning of thirty years of true, two-party competition for the governorship in the state. Between 1895 and 1931, five Republicans and six Democrats held the office of governor. Since 1931, however, the Republicans have been unable to preserve this level of parity, and in that period only four of the twenty elected governors <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>from</b> the Republican party, including incumbent Matt Bevin.|$|E
