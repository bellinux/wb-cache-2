A complex Hilbert space has its x, y, z, etc. coordinates as complex numbers. This effectively doubles the number of dimensions. A polytope constructed in such a unitary space is called a complex polytope.|$|E

25|$|In physics, {{action is}} an {{attribute}} {{of the dynamics}} of a physical system from which the equations of motion of the system can be derived. It is a mathematical functional which takes the trajectory, also called path or history, of the system as its argument and <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> number as its result. Generally, the action takes different values for different paths. Action has the dimensions of ⋅ or ⋅, and its SI unit is joule-second.|$|E

25|$|When the {{appropriate}} conditions above are satisfied {{a system is}} said to be asymptotically stable; the variables of an asymptotically stable control system always decrease from their initial value and do not show permanent oscillations. Permanent oscillations occur when a pole <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> part exactly equal to zero (in the continuous time case) or a modulus equal to one (in the discrete time case). If a simply stable system response neither decays nor grows over time, and has no oscillations, it is marginally stable; in this case the system transfer function has non-repeated poles at the complex plane origin (i.e. their real and complex component is zero in the continuous time case). Oscillations are present when poles with real part equal to zero have an imaginary part not equal to zero.|$|E
25|$|More formally, real {{numbers have}} the two basic {{properties}} of being an ordered field, and having the least upper bound property. The first says that real numbers comprise a field, with addition and multiplication as well as division by non-zero numbers, which can be totally ordered on a number line in a way compatible with addition and multiplication. The second says that, if a non-empty set of real numbers has an upper bound, then it <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> least upper bound. The second condition distinguishes the real numbers from the rational numbers: for example, the set of rational numbers whose square is less than 2 is a set with an upper bound (e.g. 1.5) but no (rational) least upper bound: hence the rational numbers do not satisfy the least upper bound property.|$|E

The cast members strove to make their French accents authentic yet understandable. John Ratzenberger notes that he often segued into an Italian accent.

A reviewer in CMJ called the album: [...] "unique and ground-breaking". A reviewer in Q magazine described Olivia as [...] "well-versed in the not always noble {{art of the}} R ballad" [...] and the songs as: [...] "a list of saucy demands that would make Lil' Kim blush". Jon Azpiri of AllMusic praised the album, saying [...] "her softer tracks show some versatility", and deemed Olivia's best works as coming from: [...] "when she is venting her spleen rather than revealing her soul".|$|E
500|$|According to Wright, Rosamund Pike {{was cast}} as the eldest sister [...] "because [...] knew she wasn't going to play her as a nice, simple person.

The other three Bennet sisters were played by Talulah Riley, Carey Mulligan, and Jena Malone, the only American actress among them. Wright believed Malone to have a [...] "pretty faultless English accent". Mulligan heard about the casting call at a dinner hosted by Julian Fellowes, to whom she had written a letter after failing to get into drama school; she won the part after three auditions. Tamzin Merchant appears as Georgiana Darcy; she was hired despite having no previous acting experience after she {{wrote a letter to}} the casting director. In addition to Merchant, Pride & Prejudice was the feature film debut of both Mulligan and Riley.|$|E
500|$|Following a brief, uncredited {{role in the}} post-apocalyptic {{blockbuster}} I Am Legend (2007), Thompson {{played the}} devoutly Catholic Lady Marchmain in a 2008 film adaptation of Brideshead Revisited. Critics were unenthusiastic about the film, but several picked Thompson out as its highlight. Mark Kermode said [...] "Emma Thompson is to some extent becoming the new Judi Dench, {{as the person who}} kind of comes in for 15 minutes and is brilliant ... when she goes away, the rest of the movie <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> problem living up to the wattage of her presence". Thompson was further acclaimed for her work in the London-based romance Last Chance Harvey (2008), where she and Dustin Hoffman played a lonely, middle-aged pair who cautiously begin a relationship. Critics praised the chemistry between the two leads, and both received Golden Globe nominations for their performances. Thompson's two 2009 films were both set in 1960s England, and in both she made cameo appearances: as a headmistress in the critically praised drama An Education and as a [...] "tippling mother" [...] in Richard Curtis's The Boat that Rocked.|$|E

500|$|The {{story was}} well received. Joe Rybicki of Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine celebrated that [...] "for {{the first time}} I can remember, an extreme-sports game {{actually}} <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> story [...] honest-to-goodness characters". IGN's Douglas Perry called it [...] "a kick, albeit relatively lightweight in nature". He especially praised the pervasive sense of humor in the narrative and in the portrayal of real-world skaters. Knutson called the story [...] "unique" [...] and stated, [...] "I really like that Neversoft {{had the guts to}} try something this radical and ditch the formula that they know works so well." [...] Ben Silverman of Game Revolution described the game's plot as a [...] "silly" [...] cross between those of the 1980s films North Shore and Gleaming the Cube, but he praised it for giving context to the level goals and keeping distance between the skill unlocks. Bramwell called it [...] "hackneyed". Rybicki found that the plot hurt the game's replay value and caused missions to be overly simplistic. By contrast, Game Informers Justin Leeper thought that [...] "it serves to make some of the less-entertaining goals tolerable, because there’s a reason for doing them." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN Todd Gilchrist {{called it}} Bay's best film, and [...] "one {{of the few}} {{instances}} where it's OK to enjoy something for being smart and dumb at the same time, mostly because it's undeniably also {{a whole lot of}} fun". The Advertiser Sean Fewster found the visual effects so seamless that [...] "you may come to believe the studio somehow engineered artificial intelligence". The Denver Post Lisa Kennedy praised the depiction of the robots as having [...] "a believably rendered scale and intimacy", and ABC presenter Margaret Pomeranz was surprised [...] "that a complete newcomer to the Transformers phenomenon like myself became involved in the fate of these mega-machines". Ain't It Cool News's Drew McWeeny felt most of the cast grounded the story, and that [...] "it <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> sense of wonder, one of the things that's missing from so much of the big CGI lightshows released these days". Author Peter David found it ludicrous fun, and said that [...] " [...] manages to hold on to his audience's suspension of disbelief long enough for us to segue into some truly spectacular battle scenes". Roger Ebert gave the film a positive review, giving it 3 stars out of a possible 4, writing: [...] "It's goofy fun with a lot of stuff that blows up real good, and it has the grace not only to realize how preposterous it is, but to make that into an asset." ...|$|E
500|$|Contemporary music critics {{received}} the [...] "Ave Maria" [...] with mixed reception. While some praised Knowles' emotion-filled vocals, others stated that her version {{as merely a}} normal take on the original. Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle commended the open-hearted emotion and the soft vocals that Knowles adopts on [...] "Ave Maria", before adding that it is [...] "a clever riff on the classic aria" [...] and [...] "a unique risk that pays off". Likewise, the Hartford Courants Eric R. Danton, praised the rework of the classic aria, adding that Knowles' lyrics were an [...] "elegant take on the timeless melody". Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork Media commented that Knowles twist on the song is [...] "vocally impeccable, but it reads more like recital fodder rather than a true confessional." [...] Leah Greenblatt from Entertainment Weekly wrote that on the I Am disc there were some [...] "lovely ballads" [...] including [...] "Disappear", the [...] "soaring 'Halo' and 'Ave Maria'". Matos Michaelangelo of The A.V. Club wrote that [...] "Beyoncé <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> flair for grandeur" [...] and the [...] "big, wide melodies of 'Halo' and 'Ave Maria' give her enough to work with that." [...] Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune commented that [...] "Ave Maria" [...] offers a [...] "rare moment of comfort" [...] and added that it [...] "come off as delicate as [...] emotions." [...] Jim Farber of Daily News praised the song with its [...] "operatic flourishes... heavenly élan". In another review, {{he noted that the}} song was [...] "by far her most melodically sure, and musically diverse, work". USA Todays Elysa Gardner chose [...] "Ave Maria" [...] as one of the songs to download from the album. While reviewing I Am...

[...] Additionally, co-producer Alex da Kid said, [...] "I started on the train and finished in the studio. I knew it was special from the start. It wasn't like I was aiming for Nicki with this track; I had a idea I thought was crazy. Nicki heard it and the rest was history." [...] In {{an interview}} with MTV News, Minaj stated when she first heard the song she felt she was in Africa {{and fell in love with}} the drum beats, and commented, [...] "It's a very rare. ... You're not gonna get the song the first time you hear it. After the second or third time, you're gonna be like, 'Whoa, what is this?' It sounds nothing like anything that's out right now." [...] She also called the song [...] "next-level futuristic", and said that she chose Garrett for the song in that he would be the best to [...] "illustrate Nicki Minaj", as he got her and her personality". In an interview on the set of the video shoot for [...] "Massive Attack", Minaj said, [...] "I'm excited for people to hear me ... doing more than one verse. It's really creative. I wanted to be theatrical, but I am very serous about what I do." [...] Also on the set of the video, Garrett said, [...] "We wanted to give her something that was global," [...] he continued. [...] "We wanted to give her something that was urban; we wanted to give her something that was mainstream pop, you know what I mean, that the world could get a chance to see her out on this pedestal. And of course, you know, I had to come along with her, because I've got an album dropping soon." [...] The song made its debut March 29, 2010 on WQHT. The song leaked onto the Internet on March 30, 2010, the day before its music video premiere on 106 & Park. The single's art cover was revealed on April 1, 2010, featuring a still of Minaj in the music video as a ninja and comic book font designs.
