40|$|<b>Halofenate</b> {{has been}} shown {{previously}} to lower triglycerides in dyslipidemic subjects. In addition, significant decreases in fasting plasma glucose were observed but only in type 2 diabetic patients. We hypothesized that <b>halofenate</b> might be an insulin sensitizer, and we present data to suggest that <b>halofenate</b> is a selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) - modulator (SPPARM). We demonstrate that the circulating form of <b>halofenate,</b> halofenic acid (HA), binds to and selectively modulates PPAR-. Reporter assays show that HA is a partial PPAR- agonist, which can antagonize {{the activity of the}} full agonist rosiglitazone. The data suggest that the partial agonism of HA may be explained in part by effective displacement of corepressors (N-CoR and SMRT) coupled with inefficient recruitment of coactivators (p 300, CBP, and TRAP 220). In human preadipocytes, HA displays weak adipogenic activity and antagonizes rosiglitazone-mediated adipogenic differentiation. Moreover, in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes, HA selectively modulates the expression of multiple PPAR-responsive genes. Studies in the diabetic ob/ob mouse demonstrate <b>halofenate</b> 9 ̆ 2 s acute antidiabetic properties. Longer-term studies in the obese Zucker (fa/fa) rat demonstrate <b>halofenate</b> 9 ̆ 2 s comparable insulin sensitization to rosiglitazone in the absence of body weight increases. Our data establish <b>halofenate</b> as a novel SPPARM with promising therapeutic utility with the potential for less weight gain...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{decades have}} seen a {{worldwide}} explosion of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 85 - 90 % of all diabetes cases with an estimated 940, 000 Australians aged 25 years and over afflicted. This number has trebled since 1981. Globally, type 2 diabetes afflicts approximately 150 - 200 million people, with this number expected to increase to 300 million by 2010. A major contributor to this massive increase in type 2 diabetes is obesity. World wide, more than 1 billion adults are overweight with at least 300 million of these clinically obese. This rapid rise in lifestyle related diseases reflects changes in behavioural patterns including diets consisting of high proportions of saturated fats and sugar and a tendency toward less physical activity. This trend is proving to socially and economically burden communities worldwide. Current therapies {{for the treatment of}} type 2 diabetes include a class of glucose lowering, insulin sensitising drugs, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which were developed before the molecular target had been identified. Research has since identified the nuclear receptor Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor y (PPARy) as the molecular target of these drugs. Activation of this receptor by TZDs has been found to ameliorate the metabolic disturbances associated with type 2 diabetes ie hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance and some aspects of dyslipidemia. Unfortunately, the current therapies that target PPARy produce adverse side effects, particularly in those patients co-treated with insulin, including edema and weight gain, which are counterproductive {{in the context of the}} metabolic syndrome. As a result, there is a requirement for the identification of novel compounds that can elicit the positive antidiabetic effects while avoiding negative side effects. Such compounds include SPPARyMs (Selective PPARy Modulators). These compounds are partial agonists/antagonists of PPARy, capable of differentially modulating cofactor interaction and resultant gene expression relative to full agonists. In addition, they are capable of antagonising the PPARy mediated effects elicited by full agonists in a cell specific manner. We demonstrate that <b>halofenate,</b> a phenoxy acetic acid derivative, initially described and utilised in the 1970 s to lower triglycerides and glucose in type 2 diabetic patients, is a SPPARyM. Halofenic acid, the circulating form of <b>halofenate,</b> binds to and modulates PPARy. It is a partial agonist that is capable of antagonising the activity of the full agonist, rosiglitazone. It displays weak adipogenic potential and antagonises rosiglitazone-mediated adipogenic differentiation in human preadipocytes. In 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes, halofenic acid differentially modulates the expression of PPARy target genes. This partial agonism/antagonism may be explained in part by the attenuated displacement of corepressors (N-CoR and SMRT) coupled with the defective recruitment of coactivators (p 300, CBP and TRAP 220). In vivo studies in ob/ob and fa/fa rodents demonstrate that <b>halofenate</b> is equally as efficacious as rosiglitazone at ameliorating insulin resistance, but without eliciting weight gain. Second generation <b>halofenate</b> derivatives were also found to differentially activate PPARy and PPARa. These compounds are partial PPARy agonists, capable of dose dependently activating PPARy with reduced efficacy and/or potency compared to rosiglitazone. Each compound also displays a unique efficiency and potency at displacing corepressors and recruiting coactivators. On the basis of these findings the <b>halofenate</b> derivatives were similarly classified as SPPARyMs. The modulation of PPARy activity and interactions with cofactors by SPPARyMs ultimately leads to a distinct gene expression profile. Analysis of target genes in C 2 C 12 skeletal muscle cells reveal these compounds have differential effects on the expression of genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism, in comparison to rosiglitazone. It is these discrete changes in the down stream effects of PPARy signalling that may lead to a more beneficial metabolic outcome than that observed for full PPARy agonists. Despite the differences in the modulation of PPARy activities, <b>halofenate</b> and its derivatives have been found to retain the insulin sensitising effects of full agonists while avoiding the side effects associated with them. These compounds may provide not only a novel approach to treating type 2 diabetes, but also offer a unique tool in further understanding PPARy signalling and its role in ameliorating symptoms associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects on}} glycerolipid {{synthesis}} {{of a series}} of compounds including many drugs were investigated in cell-free preparations and slices of rat liver. p-Chlorobenzoate, p-chlorophenoxyisobutyrate, <b>halofenate,</b> D-amphetamine, adrenaline, procaine and N-[2 -(4 -chloro- 3 -sulphamoylbenzoyloxy) ethyl]norfenfluramine had little inhibitory effect on any of the systems investigated. Two amphiphilic anions, clofenapate and 2 -(p-chlorophenyl) - 2 -(m-trifluoromethylphenoxy) acetate, both inhibited glycerol phosphate acyltransferase and diacylglycerol acyltransferase at approx. 1. 6 and 0. 7 mm respectively. Clofenapate (1 mm) also inhibited the incorporation of glycerol into lipids by rat liver slices without altering the relative proportions of the different lipids synthesized. The amphilic amines, mepyramine, fenfluramine, norfenfluramine, hydroxyethylnorfenfluramine, N-(2 -benzoyloxyethyl) norfenfluramine, cinchocaine, chlorpromazine and demethylimipramine inhibited phosphatidate phosphohydrolase by 50 % at concentrations between 0. 2 and 0. 9 mm. The last four compounds inhibited glycerol phosphate acyltransferase by 50 % at concentrations between 1 and 2. 6 mm. None of the amines examined appeared to be an effective inhibitor of diacylglycerol acyltransferase. Norfenfluramine, hydroxyethylnorfenfluramine and N-(2 -benzoyloxyethyl) norfenfluramine produced less inhibition of glycerol incorporation into total lipids than was observed with equimolar clofenapate. The major effect of these amines in liver slices was to inhibit triacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine synthesis and to produce a marked accumulation of phosphatidate. The results are discussed in terms of the control of glycerolipid synthesis. They partly explain the observed effects of the various drugs on lipid metabolism. The possible use of these compounds as biochemical tools with which to investigate the reactions of glycerolipid synthesis is considered...|$|E
