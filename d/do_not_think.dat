5|$|Hanuman Chalisa (हनुमान चालीसा), literally, Forty Verses to Hanuman, is an Awadhi work of 40 Chaupais and two Dohas in obeisance to Hanuman. Popular belief {{holds the}} work to be {{authored}} by Tulsidas, and it contains his signature, though some authors <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> the work was written by him. It {{is one of the}} most read short religious texts in northern India, and is recited by millions of Hindus on Tuesdays and Saturdays. It is believed to have been uttered by Tulsidas in a state of Samadhi at the Kumbh Mela in Haridwar.|$|E
5|$|With Goya we <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> of {{the studio}} or even of the artist at work. We think only of the event. Does this imply that The Third of May {{is a kind of}} {{superior}} journalism, the record of an incident in which depth of focus is sacrificed to an immediate effect? I am ashamed to say that I once thought so; but the longer I look at this extraordinary picture and at Goya's other works, the more clearly I recognise that I was mistaken.|$|E
60|$|A {{railway station}} is an admirable place, {{although}} Ruskin <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> so; he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> so because {{he himself was}} even more modern than the railway station. He <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> so because he was himself feverish, irritable, and snorting like an engine. He could not value the ancient silence of the railway station.|$|R

5|$|The next front {{action for}} Ledbury came later on that day, at 08:20, when the {{destroyer}} began signalling, 'Eight air torpedo-bombers 210 degrees, five miles', {{and then two}} minutes later, 'for eight read ten'. Suddenly after Ledburys signals, all the escorts seemed to be blinking morse-signals at once. The loudspeakers were booming, 'Bombers approaching... there's six of them... there's twelve... there's eighteen... good God, there's twenty-five!' The anti-aircraft ship lurched forward and altered course to head off the attack. Commodore Dowding signalled Keppel to ask if the convoy should make an 'emergency turn'; but it was deemed too late for such a manoeuvre, since half the ships would most likely miss the signal altogether and Broome flashed back, 'I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> it worth it.' The developing air attack spotted by Ledbury turned into a blitz of the convoy, with Luftwaffe aircraft being shot down over the formation, and one plane crashed into the sea about four thousand yards from the destroyer , on the convoy's starboard bow. The crash occurred not far from Ledbury and seamen on board saw four German airmen climbing out into a rubber dinghy with the bomber sinking soon after. The pilot, Lieutenant Kaumeyr, and his three crewmen were picked out of their dinghy by Ledbury. The attack however, continued and throughout the fierce fighting the escorts distinguished themselves by screening the merchantmen from many attacks, especially U-boat sorties; Ledbury alone had sighted seven.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{researchers}} <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> {{that the}} plague ever became endemic in Europe or its rat population.

25|$|As for the Hellenes, {{it seems}} {{obvious to me that}} ever since they came into {{existence}} they have always used the same language. They were weak at first, when they were separated from the Pelasgians, but they grew from a small group into a multitude, especially when many peoples, including other barbarians in great numbers, had joined them. Moreover, I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> the Pelasgian, who remained barbarians, ever grew appreciably in number or power.|$|E

25|$|An {{analysis}} of all reports convinces {{me that there}} was no submarine in the area. Lieutenant Commander Sullivan states that he was unable to obtain any evidence of a submarine except one bubble of air which is unexplained except by turbulence of water due to a depth charge explosion.

25|$|The {{effects of}} fiscal policy can {{be limited by}} {{crowding}} out. When there is no output gap, the economy is producing at full capacity {{and there are no}} excess productive resources. If the government increases spending in this situation, the government use resources that otherwise would have been used by the private sector, so there is no increase in overall output. Some economists think that crowding out is always an issue while others <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> it is a major issue when output is depressed.|$|E
