The {{purpose of this study is}} to explore the different use of emoticons between males and females in LINE application, where social media become one of the tools which support and as an important access to communicate oneanother with someone beloved, family, and also friends. The researcher used two methods for this analysis. There are quantitative analysis and qualitative analysis. The number of participants was 60 people;the participantswere divided into three parts, 50 people followed the quantitative analysis, two groups of males and females to a qualitative analysis; there are 23 females and 27 males, also 10 people who were interviewed. In collecting data, researcher asked participants to <b>fill</b> <b>out</b> <b>questionnaire</b> and to screenshot the conversations between female – female and male – male. From the questionnaire researcher found that females choose agree and strongly agree, males choose disagree, neutral, and agree on every statement in questionnaire. It can be seen from the screenshots that 80 percents of line users who use emoticonsare females, and 20 percents are males. From the interview, is found that there are 8 people; 5 females and 3 males who always use emoticons in LINE application. Therefore, the result of this research shows there is a difference between males and females in using emoticon in LINE chat and that females use emoticons in communication more frequently than males...|$|E

The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate predictors which affect unresponsiveness to diet questions based on " Oral Health Situation of Iranian Children" Survey carried out in 1998. Materials and Methods: A dummy variable was created as dependent variable according to responding eight questions relating to diet. Then {{predictors of}} missing data were defined using multivariable logistic regression and classification tree method. To evaluate goodness of fit of logistic regression model, sensitivity and specificity were assessed. Classification tree analysis was done by Quest growing method. Significance level was set at 0. 05 in logistic regression analysis. Observations and Results: "Missing data" variable was marked as missing in 616 (7. 2 %) of questionnaires. In logistic regression model revealed that, gender, mother′s education level and father′s education level didn′t affect "missing data" variable (P > 0. 05). But, dmf index (OR = 0. 94), Area of living (OR = 0. 49), number of children in the family (OR = 1. 19), sibling order (OR = 0. 85), brushing (OR = 0. 84) and visiting dentist (OR = 0. 59) had statistically significant association with dependent variable (P < 0. 05). Classification tree analysis showed that questionnaires related to children in urban area whose dmf index is under 5 and haven′t visited dentist are predicted to have missing data more than other groups. Conclusions: Area of living, dmf index, number of children in the family, sibling order, brushing and visiting dentist are significant variables for predicting the risk of missing data when asking parents about their children′s diet...|$|E

In line with the major purpose, it also aimed at investigating teachers' perception of CLT principles, classroom vocabulary instruction and activities. Major obstacles that affected the implementation of CLT during vocabulary instruction were also assessed. To this effect, 617 (10 %) sample students and 51 EFL teachers were chosen to <b>fill</b> <b>out</b> <b>questionnaire.</b> Two teachers from two high schools were also selected for classroom observation. Frequencies and percentages were employed in analyzing the quantitative data and qualitative description was {{used to analyze the}} data collected via classroom observation. The findings of the study revealed that the majority of teachers perceived that most of the CLT principles are appropriate to teach vocabulary communicatively. However, in relation to classroom instruction of vocabulary, they believed that they spend much of their time in presenting the meanings and forms of words. A great deal remained to be done to change the principles into communicative activities to relate the presentation of forms and meanings of separate words to classroom activities and authentic contexts. As the obstacles to implement vocabulary lessons in CLT, it was found out that teachers were highly depending on the lecture method. They also depend on dictionary definition of many words at time for the sake of finalizing the portion. Finally, based on the findings, the researcher recommended that creating meaningful learning opportunities through English club and English day in the school and use of authentic writing and listening activities out of the school is very important for learners. In addition, department heads and school administrators should follow up teachers not only for the coverage of portions but also how better each skill are taught. Jimma Universit...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} this study was to assess college students' {{knowledge}} and attitudes about the human papillomavirus. Purpose of the StudyThe purpose of the study was to determine HPV knowledge and attitudes of students enrolled in an introductory community health education course. This information was extremely important to collect due to the fact HPV is the most commonly transmitted STD in the United Stated and there is widespread misinformation among health care providers, educators and the general public about all the aspects of HPV and its consequences. (CDC, 2001) This study will provide students enrolled in the introductory community health education course with an enhanced understanding of HPV and STD prevention education and the issues that surround it. Knowledge gained from this project will help better prepare students especially preservice nursing and community health educators for their future role in either the hospital or community setting. Over the last 10 years, little emphasis has been placed on HPV education and prevention. Compared to other STD's HPV has taken a backseat to acquired immunodeficiency (AIDS) and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which present with more immediate health concerns. The new rate of infections for HPV is typically highest during the late teen and early twenties. Studies have found HPV is widespread across racial and ethnic groups (Ho, Bierman, Beardsley, Chang, & Burk, 1998). Annual cost burdens for genital HPV are the second highest after HIV infection, existing estimates of these costs range from $ 1. 6 billion to $ 6 billion. These estimates do not include costs for lost time and wages or intangible costs such as emotional pain anxiety and disrupted relationships (CDC, 2002). Currently, research is being done on the effectiveness of a HPV vaccine and it's acceptability with men and women, but at this time there is no cure for this transmittable virus. The study was delimited to: 1. The sample for this study comprised of 85 students Ball State University students enrolled in an introductory community health education course. 2. A 41 -question instrument (questionnaire) designed to determine knowledge and attitudes about HPV was utilized. 3. The instrument was administered to students enrolled in a Principals of Community Health Class (HSC 180).

H 577 P ISE 2015 Rozhkovxix, 210 pages, 50 {{variously}} numbered pages :illustrationsOrganizations require {{competent and}} high-level performance from the employees in project teams. However, {{our understanding of}} the factors that enable and support this high performance is far from complete. Much of the previous research on team performance focuses on the behaviour of team members, their individual competence, and the effect of organizational culture on team competency. However, the effects of organizational culture, organizational climate, manager behaviour, and team members' competencies on team performance have received relatively little attention. Meanwhile, institutions of higher education try to develop professional competencies among students, including effective teamwork. Indeed, the student workgroup context {{is similar to that of}} an industry work (project) team. Yet, most previous research on student workgroup performance focuses on the measurement of performance, rather than on the effect of team climate and social axioms on the competencies of the student groups, which ultimately determine their performance. The results of such research would not only help improve student performance, but also help institutions of higher learning create appropriate curricula to develop the competencies desired by industry. As such, this study aims to develop a research methodology that will help improve individual competencies and performance in a work team. Furthermore, this study attempts to better understand the important factors enabling and supporting the required competencies and performance of employees on a work team. Particular attention is paid to technological companies and student groups. This study develops a theoretical framework for building context-based competency models to guide the management of an individual team member's performance. The framework combines workplace characteristics, individual employee competencies, and performance. The present study set the following research objectives: (i) To establish a theoretical framework for the development of context-based competency models; (ii) To build context-based competency models for work teams and student groups; (iii) To explore the constructs of organizational culture, team climate, manager behaviour, and social axioms in the workplace context; (iv) To explore the relationships between work context and individual competencies; (v) To build quantitative models to predict competencies and performance in specific work contexts. This study used survey-based methodology in the form of electronic self-administered questionnaires to collect quantitative data. The study was conducted in three stages. In the first stage, respondents were requested to fill out questionnaires related to their organizational culture and team climates. Then, each employee was asked to <b>fill</b> <b>out</b> <b>questionnaire</b> to assess their manager's behaviour while managers performed a self-assessment. Finally, in the third stage of the study, a 360 degree assessment of employee competencies was conducted. Specifically, each employee was asked to evaluate themselves and their peers by responding to a series of questions pertaining to behavioural indicators of competencies. Furthermore, the manager of each team was asked to answer questions relating to the employees under their supervision. Managers and employees were separated during data collection. Data collection among student groups took place in two stages. In the first stage, an email was sent to the subject coordinator of the Faculty of Engineering of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University with basic information about the study and asking for permission to invite students to participate. Once permission was obtained, the author of the current study went to a class, gave a short presentation about the study and invited students to participate. Students who agreed to participate listed their names and emails on the consent form. Then, in the second stage, the electronic questionnaires were emailed to participants. Each student received a unique link to a customized online questionnaire and was asked to respond to the questionnaire within a one week time frame. Data analysis included data coding, measurement, assessment and reliability analysis, hypothesis testing, and predictive model building. Data analysis was performed using Microsoft Office Excel 2010, R language for statistical analysis, and IBM SPSS Statistics 22. Descriptive statistics were computed to assess the overall tendencies of the collected data (including the mean, standard deviation, variance, skewness and kurtosis). Tests of normality for each variable were performed using Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests. Construct validity analysis was performed via Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a technique which relates the measured variables to the latent constructs. Cronbach's alpha was used to perform a reliability analysis to assess internal consistency and the reliability of the constructs. Correlation was used to estimate the strength of each relationship studied. Furthermore, a PCA factor analysis was conducted to identify the factor structure of the data. The hypotheses regarding the effect of competencies on individual and group performance were tested using t-test statistics. Finally, linear regression and decision trees were used to build and test the predictive power of context-based competencies on both work team and student group performance. The findings of the present study contribute to the body of knowledge concerning competencies and team performance. The two studies reported below, which clarify both employee and student perspectives, permit a deeper understanding of the role of contextual factors in group work performance. Furthermore, the employee study integrated the concepts of organizational culture, team climate and manager behaviours into one model enabling the prediction of competencies and performance of team members. The results of the employee study suggest that team member performance is mainly affected by workplace contextual factors such as organizational culture, team climate and managerial practices. Indeed, effective team building and the strategic design of the workplace environment may enhance team member performance. The student groups study went beyond the traditional study of academic performance by considering the behaviour of students as analogous to the behaviour of team members in industry. In addition to the originality of this study in considering contextual factors, the present study investigated social axioms as predictors of student competencies and performance. It was assumed that the role of social axioms would be similar among students and among employees in work teams. The study found evidence that competencies and social axioms play an important role in group performance. The results generated from the study of student groups may be used in two ways. First, the models can be used to predict and improve the performance of student teams. Specifically, they can be used to predict the performance of the student teams working together over the course of a semester or to build the most effective teams based on the individual competencies of students. Further, they can also be used for assessing or developing the specific competencies required by industry. Second, the models can be used to enhance corporate performance. For example, they can be used for the purpose of predicting the effectiveness of team-based learning activities during training and development programmes. Finally, they can also be used to assess the influence of employees' social axioms on individual competencies. Department of Industrial and Systems EngineeringPh.
