40|$|Modern {{critical}} {{editions of}} ancient works generally include manually created indices of other sources {{quoted in the}} text. Since indices {{can be considered as}} a form of domain specific language, the paper presents a parsing-based approach to the problem of extracting information from them to support the creation of a collection of fragmentary texts. This paper first considers the characteristics and structure of quotation indices and their importance when dealing with fragmentary texts. It then presents the results of applying a fuzzy parser to the OCR transcription of an <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>quotations</b> to extract information from potentially noisy input...|$|E

40|$|This Memorial Volume is {{dedicated}} {{to one of the}} most prolific and renowned scholars in the field of Iranian Studies, the late Professor Ronald E. Emmerick, who held the chair of Iranian Studies in Hamburg until his untimely death in 2001. The volume consists of thirty-three papers, written by some of the foremost scholars in the field of Iranian Studies. The articles are essentially concerned with Old, New and especially Middle Iranian languages and texts, reflecting the predominant scholarly interests of Ronald Emmerick, whose reasearches were also directed towards Indian and Tibetan Studies. Nine papers deal with the Khotanese and Tumshuquese language, one of Emmericks main ? elds of research. The volume is accompanied by an updated Bibliography and <b>Indices</b> <b>of</b> <b>quotations</b> and <b>of</b> words...|$|R
40|$|This {{new edition}} is a {{carefully}} elaborated critical and annotated {{reading of the}} purvapaksah of Vidhivivekah and Nyayakanika, together with supercommentaries previously available only in manuscript. An introduction discusses the need for and achievements of the present edition, and {{the significance of the}} works and their authors; provides an account of the purvapaksah of Vidhivivekah; describes the manuscript sources for the edition; and presents and discusses stemmata codicum for the manuscripts of Vidhivivekah and Nyayakanika. A series of appendices give the verses for the entire text <b>of</b> Vidhivivekah; an <b>index</b> <b>of</b> verse quarters; <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> <b>quotations</b> <b>of</b> other works in the purvapaksah of Vidhivivekah, Nyayakanika, and Jusadhvankarani, and in Svaditankarani/; <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> <b>quotations</b> <b>of</b> Vidhivivekah and Nyayakanika in other works; <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> authors, works and their portions, doctrines and their upholders, and schools and their adherents, mentioned in the purvapaksah of Vidhivivekah, Nyayakanika, and Jusadhvankarani/, and in Svaditankarani/; cross references to the uttarapaksah; and several additional notes to the texts. A large number of sources, paraphrases, parallel passages and comparable arguments found in the primary literature are identified and quoted in the notes. In addition, quotations internal to the text, commentary and supercommentaries are identified and recorded in the notes. ^ Vidhivivekah is the treatise in the mimamsa philosophical school composed by Mandanamisrah (late 7 th or early 8 th century CE) which examines the meaning of vidhih, 2 ̆ 7 injunction 2 ̆ 7. The commentary, Nyayakanika, by Vacaspatimisrah, another well known philosophical writer (9 th or 10 th century CE), is his earliest work and the only known running commentary on Vidhivivekah. It provides a clear and authoritative interpretation of the text, and includes short treatise length elaborations of selected portions. The two supercommentaries by Paramesvarah, Jusadhvankarani/ and Svaditankarani/, which are published here for the first time, are not only lucid and insightful aids for readers of Vidhivivekah and Nyayakanika, but also give testimony to readings of good text and commentary manuscripts available in the fourteenth century CE, but sometimes not preserved in currently available text and commentary manuscripts. Their clear statements of arguments obscured in the muddled readings of text and commentary manuscripts often facilitated the editorial work. ^ Publication elsewhere of an edition of the complete text and commentary, together with the supercommentaries (which will supersede the present edition of the purvapaksah) may be expected within five years. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, I {{argue that}} {{quotation}} is not primarily a linguistic phenomenon. Linguistic productions are essentially symbolic (in Peirce’s sense), whereas quotations, in essence, are iconic. They are therefore best treated as ‘demonstrations’ (Clark & Gerrig 1990; Clark 1996; Recanati 2001). As a consequence, any purely semantic {{account of the}} meaning <b>of</b> <b>quotations</b> {{is bound to be}} not only incomplete but flawed in key respects. Any sound theory <b>of</b> <b>quotation</b> must be a pragmatic one at heart, with semantics playing only an ancillary role. Since most existing accounts <b>of</b> <b>quotation</b> are fundamentally semantic, they are also necessarily deficient, and therefore unsuitable as general, comprehensive theories <b>of</b> <b>quotation.</b> info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

The analysis was done in three parts: first, an analysis of the modified Jones´ model under panel data considerations by using fixed effects and adjustments of performing autocorrelation of order 1; second, a correlation analysis between the residuals of the modified Jones´ model and the return of stock price in 3 annual closings years of study: 2007, 2008 and 2009; and third, we incorporated this variable (DAI) in the Ohlson model (of the financial and corporate accounting literature) and we tested it with panel data analysis, under fixed effects, throughout the study period...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} results of an {{experimental}} study which targets prosodic correlates <b>of</b> subclausal <b>quotation</b> marks. We found that written sentences containing passages enclosed by quotation marks were read aloud in a manner that significantly differs in prosody from spoken realizations of corresponding disquoted counterparts. However, we also observed that such prosodic marking <b>of</b> subclausal <b>quotation</b> wasn’t strong enough to survive subsequent back-translation into written language: there was no correlation between the presence/absence <b>of</b> <b>quotation</b> marks in the original written examples, and the presence/absence <b>of</b> <b>quotation</b> marks in corresponding back-translations from oral renditions.

40|$|The present thesis {{focuses on}} the way the seven {{selected}} writings of the Apostolic Fathers quote the texts of the Bible. Beginning with discussion of the term "Apostolic Fathers", the thesis turns to explaining the key expressions used in the next chapters, namely Quotation, Composite Quotation, Allusion, Paraphrase, Scriptural Language, Exemplum. The second part, the principal part of the thesis, contains close analysis <b>of</b> the <b>quotations</b> within the selected writings. Attention is also paid to the question, which books of the Bible were quoted by the individual authors, whereas the investigation concentrates primarily on how the quotations are used. For the purpose of unbiased comparison of the single writings' citation technique, the total number <b>of</b> <b>quotations,</b> the length <b>of</b> all <b>quotations</b> in total and the length of each writing was enumerated, the length of the writing being expressed in the count of standard pages. In this way, two significant quantities were achieved, namely proportional bulk <b>of</b> <b>quotations</b> in the writing and quotation frequency expressed in the number <b>of</b> <b>quotations</b> per standard page. Besides these figures, attention was paid also to the role <b>of</b> <b>quotations</b> in individual writings with regard to their genres.
