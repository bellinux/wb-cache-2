40|$|Thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR 1) is a homodimeric {{flavoprotein}} crucially {{involved in}} the regulation of cellular redox homeostasis, growth, and differentiation. Its importance in various diseases makes TrxR 1 a highly interesting drug target. Here we present the first crystal structures of human TrxR 1 in complex with its substrate thioredoxin (Trx). The carboxy−terminal redox centre is found about 20 Å apart from the amino−terminal redox centre, with no major conformational changes in TrxR or Trx. Thus, our structure confirms that the enzyme uses a flexible C−terminal arm for electron transport to its substrates, which is stabilized by a <b>guiding</b> <b>bar</b> for controlled transfer. This notion is supported by mutational analyses. Furthermore, essential residues of the interface region were characterized both structurally and functionally. The structure provides templates for future drug design, and contributes {{to our understanding of}} redox regulatory processes in mammal...|$|E
40|$|Electron micrographs {{of serial}} {{sections}} {{show that the}} male sexual apparatus of Scutellonema brachyurum includes two morphologically identical spicules. Each is composed of a swollen tubular head, crescentic shaft, and leaf-like blade with membranous velum expanded from the central trunk. The spicules are concave and grooved on the ventral side and convex on the dorsal side near the trunk. The trunk is continuous with the shaft and head. Nerve tissue occupies {{the core of the}} spicule and includes a dendritic process which gains access to the exterior via a small pore on the lateral side of the spicule tip. Three protractor and two retractor muscles are associated with each spicule. A sensory accessory piece connects with the tip of the gubernaculum and protrudes from the lower side of the opening of the spicular pouch; it protracts and retracts with the muscularized gubernaculum. The gubernaculum varies from bow-shaped in the distal part to boat-shaped in the mid region. A sac exits beneath the accessory piece as a buffer for its movement. A cuticular <b>guiding</b> <b>bar</b> originating from the dorsal wall of the spicular pouch has a tongue. The ventral surface of the tongue is sclerotized to separate the two spicules. It is mobile by muscles of the protractor gubernaculi, retractor gubernaculi, and seductor gubernaculi...|$|E
40|$|Human {{thioredoxin}} reductase (hTrxR) is a homodimeric flavoprotein crucially {{involved in}} the regulation of cellular redox reactions, growth and differentiation. The enzyme contains a selenocysteine residue at its C-terminal active site that is essential for catalysis. This redox center is located on a flexible arm, solvent-exposed and reactive towards electrophilic inhibitors, thus representing a target for antitumor drug development. During catalysis reducing equivalents are transferred from the cofactor NADPH to FAD, then to the N-terminal active site cysteine residues {{and from there to}} the flexible C-terminal part of the other subunit to be finally delivered to a variety of second substrates at the molecule's surface. Here we report the first crystal structure of hTrxR 1 (Sec→Cys) in complex with FAD and NADP+ at a resolution of 2. 8 Å. From the crystals three different conformations of the carboxy-terminal arm could be deduced. The predicted movement of the arm is facilitated by the concerted action of the three side-chain residues of N 418, N 419 and W 407, which act as a <b>guiding</b> <b>bar</b> for the C-terminal sliding process. As supported by previous kinetic data, the three visualized conformations might reflect different stages in enzymatic catalysis. Comparison with other disulfide reductases including human glutathione reductase revealed specific inhibitor binding sites in the intersubunit cavity of hTrxR that can be exploited for structure-based inhibitor development...|$|E
5000|$|The {{chainsaw}} [...] "blades" [...] are technically {{known as}} [...] "guide bars". For chainsaw carving these bars have very small noses (typically around 25 mm diameter).

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{a process of}} design of a fuzzy control system for the Amira PS 600 Inverted pendulum system. The control system is realized in the MATLAB/Simulink environment and uses the Fuzzy Logic Toolbox. A connection of the Simulink scheme to the PS 600 system is realized through the Real Time Toolbox. 1 Inverted pendulum Inverted pendulum is a typical example of an unstable nonlinear system and {{is often used to}} test the performance and efficiency of control methods. The goal of the control process is to move the pendulum from the lower (stable) equilibrium position to the upright (unstable) equilibrium position and keep it in this position. Movement of the carriage acts as an actuator of the control system. Moreover, the control system should be able to move the carriage to the desired position while keeping the pendulum in the upright position. 2 PS 600 Inverted Pendulum System The Amira PS 600 Inverted Pendulum System consists of the carriage which can perform rectilinear motion along a <b>guiding</b> <b>bar,</b> the pendulum which can freely rotate around the spindle connected to the cart and a DC motor connected to the belt which is used to move the cart.

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Increased {{competition}} in the market place for both occasional and professional chain saw users {{has led to a}} desire for improved performance in chain saw <b>guide</b> <b>bars.</b> One aspect of improved performance is lower bar weight. The primary focus of this research was to establish the feasibility of a lower weight, composite, chain saw <b>guide</b> <b>bar.</b> A production steel chain saw <b>guide</b> <b>bar</b> was analyzed using COSMOS finite element modeling. This analysis determined the feasibility of totally or partially replacing the steel with a lower density composite material. Classical strength of materials analytical techniques for beams in bending were used to verify the FEA models accuracy. Additionally, strain gauges were used in high stress areas to further verify the FEA models. Various fiber reinforced thermoplastic pre-pregs were considered for the prototype research. From the literature study performed, two candidate thermoplastic matrices were chosen for further evaluation. Analyses of polyetherimide and polyphenylene sulfide were performed using differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical testing. From these tests, information concerning processing temperature and ultimate end use requirements were determined. Necessary electric heaters and other apparatus were fabricated to produce composite lay-ups. Pre-preg fiber lay-up orientation was determined from the finite element analysis and wear requirements. From the analysis and testing two prototype chain saw bars were designed and then fabricated. The first bar was composed entirely of carbon reinforced polyetherimide. The second bar was a hybrid design utilizing steel side laminates adhesively bonded to a central core of carbon fiber reinforced polyphenylene sulfide. Fabricated prototype <b>guide</b> <b>bars</b> were evaluated using a production power head...|$|R
30|$|Although {{our sample}} size was {{increased}} by pooling the variables of {{the right and left}} sides, it was nonetheless small. In addition, even though both retractors are composed of thick (0.9  mm) stainless steel wires, the lever arm and <b>guide</b> <b>bar</b> could be deflected during retraction, making accurate force application and location of the force vector difficult. Therefore, a modified APLR is proposed, in which the lever arms of both sides are connected to prevent deflection and a trans-palatal arch is added to link the posterior segments [20]. Furthermore, the difference between the angles of the position of the <b>guide</b> <b>bar</b> and tube as well as correlations between tube height and anterior and posterior intrusion should be considered in future studies.|$|R

On designing the system, we mainly consider a simple structure with low vibration and high accuracy. In stead of the traditional two level stages, we used a surface plate as the reference of the main stage. Therefore, it has low profile and simple structure. Surface plate {{was made of the}} ceramic glass with very low thermal expansion. The stage is positioned on the surface plate of 800 mm x 800 mm. It is guided horizontally by a cross structure with two precision bars perpendicularly linked and vertically by the surface plate. The sliding pads of PTFE are used at X- and Y-axes, and also used for vertically supporting the stage. The X-axis <b>guide</b> <b>bar</b> with a moving plate is glued on the surface plate.
