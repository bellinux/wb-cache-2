40|$|The {{confused}} {{classification of}} pituitary tumours was clarified {{at the beginning}} of this century by the work of Erdheim (1904, 1926). In a series of exemplary papers, he gave proofs that a variety of solid and cystic tumours of the pituitary gland and its stalk have a common origin in the displaced stratified squamous epithelium of the <b>hypophyseal</b> <b>duct.</b> This histogenesis is well expressed in the designation ' <b>hypophyseal</b> <b>duct</b> tumours ' (Erdheim) or craniopharyngeomata. Recently Ingraham and Scott (1946) rightly objected to the term cranio-pharyngeoma, pointing out that the hypophyseal 'duct develops from the ectodermal stomodeum and not from the entodermal primitive pharynx. They suggested tentatively the term ' craniostomodeoma. &apos...|$|E
40|$|Most living {{vertebrates}} are jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes), and {{the living}} jawless vertebrates (cyclostomes), hagfishes and lampreys, provide scarce information about the profound reorganization of the vertebrate skull during the evolutionary origin of jaws. The extinct bony jawless vertebrates, or 'ostracoderms', are regarded as precursors of jawed vertebrates and provide insight into this formative episode in vertebrate evolution. Here, using synchrotron radiation X-ray tomography, we describe the cranial anatomy of galeaspids, a 435 - 370 -million-year-old 'ostracoderm' group from China and Vietnam. The paired nasal sacs of galeaspids are located anterolaterally in the braincase, and the <b>hypophyseal</b> <b>duct</b> opens anteriorly towards the oral cavity. These three structures (the paired nasal sacs and the <b>hypophyseal</b> <b>duct)</b> were thus already independent of each other, like in gnathostomes and unlike in cyclostomes and osteostracans (another 'ostracoderm' group), and therefore have the condition that current developmental models regard as prerequisites {{for the development of}} jaws. This indicates that the reorganization of vertebrate cranial anatomy was not driven deterministically by the evolutionary origin of jaws but occurred stepwise, ultimately allowing the rostral growth of ectomesenchyme that now characterizes gnathostome head development...|$|E
