Dunstan later said of his involvement with the Liberals: [...] "I do not call it snobbery to deride the Establishment in South Australia, I admit that I was brought up into it, and I admit that <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> pain."

500|$|By time Tunis had fallen, few Rhodesians {{remained}} with the First or Eighth Armies; most were transferring to the South African 6th Armoured Division, then in Egypt, or {{making their way}} home on leave. Out of the 300 Southern Rhodesians who had joined the KRRC in Egypt, only three officers and 109 other ranks remained {{at the end of}} the Tunisian Campaign. The Rhodesian Anti-Tank Battery retraced many of the movements it had taken during the campaign as it returned to Egypt. [...] "Left for Matruh at 0830 hours today," [...] one Rhodesian gunner wrote.

500|$|Gailard Sartain plays Ray Stuckey, {{the sheriff}} of Jessup County — a {{character}} based on former Neshoba County sheriff Lawrence A. Rainey. Sartain described Stuckey as [...] "an elected official... {{who has to}} be gregarious - but with sinister overtones". Stephen Tobolowsky plays Clayton Townley, a Grand Wizard of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. The character is based on [...] White Knights leader Samuel Bowers. Michael Rooker plays Frank Bailey, a Klansman involved in the murders of the three civil rights activists. Pruitt Taylor Vince, who had a small role in Parker's previous film Angel Heart, plays Lester Cowens, a Klansman who unknowingly becomes a pawn in the FBI's investigation. Vince described the character as [...] "goofy, stupid and geeky" [...] and stated, [...] "I never had a prejudiced bone in my body. <b>It</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> funny feeling to play this guy with a hood and everything.

500|$|... 1602, Nick Lowe and Joe Quesada, {{approached}} Gaiman after Quesada became Marvel's Editor in Chief {{with the}} intent for Gaiman {{to work on a}} project for Marvel. Gaiman eventually agreed to write a Marvel comic in August 2001, although he was not sure what it would contain. When the September 11, 2001 attacks occurred, Gaiman decided {{that he did not want}} planes, skyscrapers, bombs or guns in his comic. [...] "I didn't want it to be a war story, and I didn't want to write a story in which might made right – or in which might made anything." [...] On a trip to Venice soon after, Gaiman was struck by how the [...] "past seemed very close at hand"; he returned from the trip knowing the story he wanted to tell. The time was chosen because [...] "it was a nice place to set the story. It gave me America and <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> lot of things that I wanted in terms of the way the world was changing. It also gave me the sense of wonder and magic." ...|$|E

[...] She has said that riding [...] "saved my life", explaining that, [...] "I was losing most of the function of my right side. And I decided I needed to go back and do what I loved before I couldn't do it anymore." [...] At first she could barely stay on a horse without getting tired, but gradually the muscle control required for riding proved directly beneficial, and psychologically, [...] "Riding exhilarated me; <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> joy and a purpose. When I was so fatigued that I couldn't move, the excitement of going to the barn and getting my foot in the stirrup would make me crawl out of bed." [...] As a result, she said, [...] "My desire to ride was, and is, so strong that I kept getting healthier and healthier." ...|$|E

500|$|Many {{of these}} films feature her in roles as distressed women, and often showed Baker in nude scenes, which few major Hollywood actors were willing {{to do at the}} time. Baker became a {{favorite}} of Umberto Lenzi, with her best-known role being in the aforementioned Paranoia, where she played a wealthy widow tormented by two sadistic siblings. In his review of Paranoia, Roger Ebert said: [...] "Carroll Baker, who was a Hollywood sex symbol (for some, it is said) until she sued Joe Levine and got blacklisted, has been around. She may not be an actress, but she can act. In The Carpetbaggers, there was a nice wholesome vulgarity to her performance. She is not intrinsically as bad as she appears in Paranoia. I think maybe she was saying the hell with it and having a good time." [...] As with Paranoia, the majority of the films she made in Italy received poor critical reception in the United States, though they afforded Baker—who had left Hollywood in debt and with two children to support— an income, as well as fame abroad. In retrospect, Baker commented on her career in Italy and on her exploitation film roles, saying: [...] "I think I made more films [...] than I made in Hollywood, but the mentality is different. What they think is wonderful is not what we might... it was marvelous for me because it really brought me back to life, and <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> whole new outlook. It's wonderful to know about a different world." ...|$|E
500|$|The transfer, in 2007, {{coincided with}} an upturn in Ebsary's career. After {{a slow start}} in the new WNCL season—Western Australia lost their first five matches—Ebsary became more productive. She scored 30 of 141 and took 1/16 in a low-scoring win over New South Wales in the sixth match. In the last double-header of the season, against Queensland, she made {{consecutive}} half-centuries {{for the first time}} in her career. In the first match she made 72 before taking 4/46 to help secure a 104-run win, before scoring 62 the next day to lay the foundation for a five-wicket win. Ebsary scored 236 runs at 29.50; her previous best WNCL aggregate was 149. However, she did have trouble in running between the wickets; three of her eight dismissals were run outs. She took eight wickets at 33.87 at an economy rate of 4.43 and had a workload more than 50% heavier than in previous seasons. Ebsary was not as successful in the fledgling Twenty20 format; in two matches for the season, her first in the most abbreviated form of cricket, she scored 33 runs at 16.50 and conceded 51 runs at an economy rate of 7.46 without taking a wicket. Ebsary later said [...] "Looking back, the move to the West has been the best thing for my cricket...After settling our line-up, <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> chance to let loose at the top of the order and helped my confidence to be aggressive at the batting crease...Under the leadership of Avril Fahey, the West Aussies were very welcoming and I found my groove at the top of the order." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} the leg, {{the band}} members were having trouble {{adjusting}} to their newfound fame as virtually every concert on the tour was sold out and Mother's Milk approached 500,000 units sold. Spin reported that following a show in Atlanta, Flea invited a woman to his hotel room for sexual intercourse, but locked himself in the bathroom upon arriving because all he could think of were his wife and daughter. Kiedis ended a two-year long relationship with actress Ione Skye, and Frusciante, looking back on the tour years later, admitted, [...] "I was totally abusing the situation [...] partying and screwing a bunch of girls. At 19, I might have looked like a stud but I was a weakling inside. I wasn't proud of who I was then." [...] Shortly before {{the end of the}} North American leg, the band filmed a performance at the Long Beach Arena, which was released as Psychedelic Sexfunk Live from Heaven in 1990. A concert at the San Francisco Civic Auditorium on New Year's Eve 1989 attracted over 10,000 attendees and was considered by band photographer Tony Woolliscroft to be [...] "the biggest [...] I had seen them play at that point. <b>It</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> handle on how hard the band had worked in the USA in the years prior to this." [...] The tour continued in the United Kingdom, where the band was receiving less attention; Kiedis complained after several shows there, [...] "We're huge in the States and it's sort of frustrating and confusing that no one knows who we are here." [...] It was not until after their return from the UK that [...] "Taste the Pain" [...] was released as a single and subsequently charted at number twenty-nine there. In March 1990, the band was asked to perform on MTV's coverage of Spring break in Florida. At the event, Flea and Smith attempted to engage the audience by jumping from the stage; the situation got out of hand, and the two were alleged to have sexually assaulted and verbally abused a female audience member. They were arrested several days later on charges of battery, disorderly conduct and solicitation to commit a lascivious act, but released on $2,000 bail. Smith and Flea's arrest worsened Kiedis' impending charge in Virginia from the [...] "Positive Mental Octopus" [...] tour, for which the vocalist was ultimately convicted of sexual battery and indecent exposure and sentenced to pay a fine of $1,000 per charge.|$|E

500|$|Over 13 {{seasons with}} the White Sox, Pierce was the ace of the {{pitching}} staff, leading the team in wins nine times and in strikeouts eight times. He was Chicago's Opening Day starter seven times (1951–52, 1954, 1956–59), and started the home opener in 1953 and 1961. He had an outstanding fastball and an excellent curveball, and in 1951 added the slider (for which he used his motion for the curve rather than the fastball) as a third strong pitch, {{as well as a}} changeup. He worked quickly with an over-the-top motion, dropping his back shoulder in a style similar to that later used by Sandy Koufax. In 1957, Paul Richards noted of Pierce's early style: [...] "He had a tendency to windmill in his delivery, which makes the ball spin too much and takes the life out of it. He flashed his curve-the Yankees always knew when he was throwing a curve. But mainly Bill didn't want to throw anything but fast balls in the old days. He laughed at the change-of-pace and the slider, so most of the strong right-hand hitters were laying back for him, waiting for a fast ball down the middle." [...] After Pierce finally tried the slider against the Yankees, to great effect, Richards noted, [...] "Then, for a while there, he began throwing nothing but sliders. He finally learned about that, too. Even today Pierce will pitch a whole ball game and almost never throw anything but fast balls. But only on certain days." [...] Yankees star Joe DiMaggio was among those praising Pierce's ability, reportedly remarking, [...] "That little so-and-so is a marvel. So little – and all that speed. And I mean speed! He got me out of there on a fastball in the ninth that I'd have needed a telescope to see." [...] Richards became Chicago's manager in 1951, and worked with Pierce to develop his two new pitches and slow down his pace, as well as significantly improve his control; Pierce later recalled, [...] "I learned to control my fastball better [...] Developing the slider helped me tremendously because <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> third out pitch. I threw it almost as hard as my fastball, but I could throw it for strikes better than the fast ball or good curve ... Richards made me work on it, and it took me about two years before it was consistent." [...] After issuing 249 walks in 391 innings in 1949–1950, Pierce gave up only 73 walks in 240 innings in 1951, and averaged more than 3 walks per 9 innings in three seasons afterward. His 1951 ERA of 3.03 was fourth best in the league, and he ranked sixth in 1952 with a mark of 2.57. On September 21, 1952 he broke Doc White's 1907 club record of 141 strikeouts by a left-hander, ending the season with 144.|$|E

It was a huge shock because we've always been a very close family. I missed the first couple of Tests in England that year so I could be at home with him. It was obviously the saddest time of my life but those last weeks were maybe some of the most beautiful. <b>It</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> chance to say thank you and goodbye. After a while I realised how lucky I was to do that. It's far harder if a parent is taken away before you have that time together. So his death put cricket in perspective for me. It's just a game – and a very simple game if you keep your mind straight.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2009, Jones {{appeared}} in Unforgiven, a three-part drama on ITV1, where she plays Ruth Slater, a woman {{released from prison}} after serving a 15-year prison sentence {{for the murder of}} two policemen. Naturally brown-haired, Jones dyed her hair [...] "tobacco yellow" [...] with [...] "big roots"; Jones joked that whilst not filming she [...] "really should have worn a wig". Additionally, the character of Ruth wore no make-up throughout, with Jones stating she was left feeling [...] "quite exposed", but nonetheless saying [...] "Ruth wouldn't have worn any make-up, I don't think". Jones received favourable reviews for her portrayal, with Brian Viner of The Independent writing: [...] "a stunning performance, the stuff of Bafta nominations if ever I saw it. Heck, on the back of it she might even get propelled into the movies, and bring a bit of North Country sense to the Golden Globes". Viner summarised his review of Unforgiven by stating, [...] "Five stars all round, and six for Jones". Jones later stated, [...] "I loved that role. They don't come along that often. It was seen by the broadsheets as well as the tabloids. <b>It</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> little bit of credibility, I suppose".|$|E
