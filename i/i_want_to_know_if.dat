2500|$|The {{arrest of}} Radovan Karadžić {{took place on}} 21 July 2008 in Belgrade. He was in hiding, posing as a doctor of {{alternative}} medicine mostly in Belgrade but also in Vienna, Austria. [...] Karadžić was transferred into ICTY custody in the Hague on 30 July. Karadžić appeared before judge Alphons Orie on 31 July, in the tribunal, which has sentenced 64 accused since 1993. During the first hearing Radovan Karadžić expressed a fear for his life by saying: [...] "If Holbrooke wants my death and regrets there is no death sentence at this court, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> his arm is long enough to reach me here." [...] and stated that the deal he made with Richard Holbrooke {{is the reason why}} it took 13 years for him to appear in front of the ICTY. He made similar accusations against the former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Muhamed Sacirbey, Bosnian foreign minister at the time, claimed that a Karadžić-Holbrooke deal was made in July 1996.|$|E
