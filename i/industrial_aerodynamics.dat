A simulated driver and vehicle are subject to two time-dependent crosswinds, one representative of a windy day and the second an extreme crosswind gust. Initially a quasi-static response is considered and then 5 additional sources of aerodynamic unsteadiness, based on experimental results, are added to the model. From the simulated vehicle and driver, the responses are used to produce results based on lateral deviation, driver steering inputs and also to create a ‘subjective’ handling rating. These results show that the largest effects are due to the relatively low frequency, time-dependent wind inputs. The additional sources of simulated unsteadiness have much smaller effect on the overall system and would be experienced as increased wind noise and reduced refinement rather than a worsening of the vehicle's handlin...|$|E

40|$|The Shake-The-Box (STB) {{technique}} [1] {{opened the}} possibility to perform accurate Lagrangian particle tracking in 30 at relatively high seeding densities. The STB method relies {{on the availability of}} a sequence of time-resolved recordings, the Iterative Particle Reconstruction technique (IPR [2]) and particle prediction in order to provide accurate particle trajectories {{that can be used to}} measure particleposition, velocity and material acceleration. When dealing with high flow velocities typical of <b>industrial</b> and <b>aerodynamics</b> applications, where, due to the current limitations in terms of acquisition frequency, time­resolved data are not available, multi-pulse systems can be employed; the acquisition of a dual illumination and imaging system is synchronized in a staggered fashion in order to generate short sequences of time-resolved recordings (typically four). Recently, the STB technique has been extended to the case of multi-pulse data; an iterative STB processing strategy has been proposed by [3], where the sequential application of IPR and particle tracking is used to progressively reduce the complexity of the object tobe reconstructed (i. e. perceived imaged seeding density) and increase the number of successfully retrieved tracks. The principle of the iterative strategy has been demonstrated by means of synthetic experiments of isotropic turbulence and of a transonic base flow in [4] and the technique has been successfully applied to the experimental investigation of a turbulent boundary layer with adverse pressure gradient in air at 36 m/s [3] and to data from a transonic jet experiment at Mach 0. 84 [5]...|$|R
40|$|Turbulent gas flows {{laden with}} small, dense {{particles}} are encountered {{in a wide}} number of important applications in both <b>industrial</b> settings and <b>aerodynamics</b> applications. Particle interactions with the underlying turbulent flow are exceedingly complex and, consequently, difficult to accurately model. The difficulty arises primarily {{due to the fact}} that response of a particle to the local environment is dictated by turbulence properties in the reference frame moving with the particle (particle-Lagrangian). The particle-Lagrangian reference frame is in turn dependent upon the particle relaxation time (time constant) as well as gravitational drift. The combination of inertial and gravitational effects in this frame complicates our ability to accurately predict particle-laden flows since measurements in the particle-Lagrangian reference frame are difficult to obtain. Therefore, in this work we will examine separately the effects of inertia and gravitational drift on particle dispersion through a combination of physical and numerical experiments. In this study, particle-Lagrangian measurements will be obtained in physical experiments using stereo image velocimetry. Gravitational drift will be varied in the variable-g environments of the NASA DC- 9 and in the zero-g environment at the drop tower at NASA-Lewis. Direct numerical simulations will be used to corroborate the measurements from the variable-g experiments. We expect that this work will generate new insight into the underlying physics of particle dispersion and will, in turn, lead to more accurate models of particle transport in turbulent flows...|$|R
40|$|Visualization, in {{its various}} forms, has always contributed to endeavors of art, science and engineering. Tapping a {{remarkable}} means {{of the human brain}} to grasp complexity, it has helped practitioners in all three endeavors achieve a better understanding of aesthetic, natural and technological objects, phenomena and processes. In science and engineering, wherever adequate visualization {{has been part of the}} creative process, it has yielded new insights into complex phenomena and catalyzed better descriptions and predictive models. Examples range from unmanned space exploration, weather satellites, astronomy, the impetus for the recent advances in our understanding of turbulence, complicated <b>industrial</b> processes to <b>aerodynamics,</b> and all kinds of in vivo and in vitro medical imaging applications. Usually, the nature of this understanding is qualitative; therefore, a subsequent quantitative measurement is essential for further progress. Quantitative single point measurement techniques such as hot wire anemometry or laser Doppler velocimetry are often used to obtain Eulerian velocity fields. These two techniques are typically limited to simultaneous sampling at a few spatial locations. In this respect, the global nature of the information contained in a single flow image invites one to develop quantitative methods to obtain multi-point spatial and temporal velocity or vorticity fields from such images. Indeed, substantial progress in many complex fields of science and technology has often awaited the development of adequate, quantitative-imaging methods capable of revealing global information about the phenomena understudy. In this talk, we focus on the strive to advance present state-of-the-art, quantitative imaging...|$|R

These vortices strongly influence all the aerodynamic coefficients. Working at model scale, using two configurations of the Davis model with different rear pillar radii, (sharp edged and 10 mm radius) the flow fields over the rear half of the models were investigated using balance measurements, flow visualisations, surface pressure and PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry) measurements. For a small geometry change between the two models, the changes to the aerodynamic loads and wake flow structures were unexpectedly large with significant differences to the strength and location of the trailing vortices in both the time averaged and unsteady results. The square edged model produced a flow field similar to that found on an Ahmed model with a sub-critical backlight angle. The round edged model produced a flow structure dominated by trailing vortices that mix with the wake behind the base of the model and is weaker. This flow structure was more unsteady than that of the square edged model. Consequently, although both models can be described as having a wake dominated by trailing vortices, there are significant differences to both the steady state and unsteady flow fields that have not been described previously. This also shows that the fastback wake structure described by Ahmed is not definitive...|$|E

To suppress the vibrations of the cylinders, tripping wires were deployed, attached symmetrically about the leading stagnation lines of the cylinders. Five spacing ratios were examined, i. e., L/D= 0. 1, 0. 3, 0. 8, 2. 0 and 3. 2 (L is the gap spacing between the two cylinders; D is the diameter of cylinder), which are representative for five Regimes I (0. 1 ≤L/D< 0. 2), II (0. 2 ≤L/D< 0. 6), III (0. 6 ≤L/D< 2), IV (2 ≤L/D< 2. 7) and V (L/D≥ 2. 7), respectively, as classified in Part 1 [Kim et al., 2009. Flow-induced vibrations of two circular cylinders in tandem arrangement (part 1 : characteristics of vibration). Journal of Wind Engineering and <b>Industrial</b> <b>Aerodynamics,</b> submitted together for publication]. Tripping wire position θ measured from the leading stagnation lines of the cylinders was changed from 20 ° to 60 ° to determine the optimum range of θ for suppressing structural vibrations. The shear layers separated from the two cylinders were investigated based on flow visualization. The main findings are: (i) the flow-induced vibration on the two cylinders depends strongly on θ, (ii) at θ= 20 - 30 ° the vibrations on both cylinders are almost completely suppressed for all regimes except V, and (iii) for θ≥ 40 ° the vibration amplitudes of both cylinders are considerably larger {{than those of the}} plain cylinders, particularly at θ= 40 °, where the vibration of the upstream cylinder becomes divergent.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This thesis {{deals with}} a system that reduces the {{oncoming}} boundary layer displacement thickness in a wind tunnel. The device is then {{used to examine the}} effect that this boundary layer has on the aerodynamic drag of a standard truck, which is classified as a bluff body with a high ground clearance and the same truck fitted with skirts all round, which is then classified as a bluff body with a low ground clearance. To gain insight into this field of <b>industrial</b> <b>aerodynamics,</b> an extensive literature survey was done in which all the relevant SAE papers onwards from the late sixties were studied and summarised in the first section of this report. The second section {{deals with a}} system that can limit the boundary layer displacement thickness in the test section of the 3 / 4 open jet wind tunnel. Through investigations and an extensive literature research a suction device was designed and built. This boundary layer removal system was then tested to ensure that the main flow indicators are not influenced by the suction and thus lie within internationally accepted limits. Included in this section are a description of the truck model and the other instruments or devices used to complete the testing. The third section deals with the aerodynamic drag experienced by the bluff body with a high ground clearance. Included in the third section is an investigation that deals with the aerodynamic drag of the same truck model, when skirting has been added which considerably lowers the ground clearance. The results obtained from the above investigations indicate that the drag of the Ground Simulation model without skirts is increased by about 3. 8 % with the removal of the boundary layer and up to 10 % for the model with the skirts. It is thus shown that the farther the object protrudes into the boundary layer, the larger the increase in drag will be once this boundary layer has been removed. These figures were obtained from testing the model at 22. 2 m/s free stream velocity and a 6 mm wheel-ground clearance, with the wheels rotating...|$|E
