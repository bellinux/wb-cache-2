5|$|According to Israeli {{historian}} Anita Shapira, {{there is}} a gap, at times quite wide, between the 'facts established by historical research' {{and the image of}} the battle as retained in collective memory. This <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> case for the battle of Latrun, which has become, in Israel, a founding myth.|$|E
5|$|In {{the context}} of {{philosophy}} of mind, the problem of free will takes on renewed intensity. This <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> case, at least, for materialistic determinists. According to this position, natural laws completely determine {{the course of the}} material world. Mental states, and therefore the will as well, would be material states, which means human behavior and decisions would be completely determined by natural laws. Some take this reasoning a step further: people cannot determine by themselves what they want and what they do. Consequently, they are not free.|$|E
25|$|The problem between Australia and Oceania: Mount Hagen in Papua New Guinea <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> {{second highest}} volcano on the Australian continent, but {{expanding}} the continental definition to span also the broad definition of Oceania drops Hagen to 4th behind Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa on the Island of Hawaii.|$|E
50|$|The Second Battle of Acentejo <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> not <b>the</b> last {{battle on}} Tenerife between the Spaniards and <b>the</b> Guanches, but <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> most decisive, {{resulting}} in the ultimate incorporation of the island into the kingdom of Castile and the final subjugation of the aborigines.|$|R

50|$|Also in Japan {{there are}} cat yōkai called the bakeneko, but since nekomata <b>are</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> yōkai of {{transformed}} cats, sometimes nekomata are confused with bakeneko.|$|R
25|$|Religious scriptures {{suggest that}} the Llü-bu were female shamans who practised divination, exorcism, and other rites in a trance. By the early nineteenth century, the Dongba priests had created a huge {{religious}} vocabulary accompanied {{by a variety of}} rituals, and had largely displaced the Llü-bu. This <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> case with Yi shamans, but the connection to dongba practices remains unclear.|$|E
25|$|Infertility {{is often}} {{described}} as a characteristic of A-T. Whereas this <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> case for the mouse model of A-T, in humans it may be more accurate to characterize the reproductive abnormality as gonadal atrophy or dysgenesis characterized by delayed pubertal development. Because programmed DSBs are generated to initiate genetic recombinations involved in the production of sperm and eggs in reproductive organs (a process known as meiosis), meiotic defects and arrest can occur when ATM is not present.|$|E
25|$|The {{classification}} of finite simple groups is regarded {{by some to}} be the longest proof of a theorem. It comprises tens of thousands of pages in 500 journal articles by some 100 authors. These papers are together believed to give a complete proof, and several ongoing projects hope to shorten and simplify this proof. Another theorem of this type is the four color theorem whose computer generated proof is too long for a human to read. It <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> longest known proof of a theorem whose statement can be easily understood by a layman.|$|E

25|$|Sylvia is {{generally}} considered a classical ballet. It features a nondescript mythical setting and a late nineteenth-century score, both of which give it an old-fashioned feel. In many ways, however, it was quite revolutionary for its time. The score {{was and still is}} recognized for its greatness. Delibes' work <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> best appreciated aspect of the ballet for its innovation, creativity, and maturity. Frederick Ashton's choreography complements the music very well in this respect, staying true to the spirit of the original production while incorporating modern techniques and adding his own unique touch.|$|E
25|$|As a child, Madetoja was by {{no means}} a musical prodigy, {{although}} his first attempts at composition were at the age of eight. He also studied the violin and piano on his own and played the mouth organ as a boy. Additionally, Madetoja reportedly became skilled at playing the kantele (a traditional plucked Finnish folk instrument): he received a 10-string kantele on his tenth birthday, and in secondary school at the Oulu Lyceum, this was upgraded to a 30-string version, built by a professional constructor. (Madetoja <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> only notable classical composer in history whose primary instrument was the kantele.) In addition, at the Lyceum, Leevi sang in the school choir and, later, directed his fellow students in the school's male and mixed choirs.|$|E
25|$|Juno <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> divine protectress of the community, {{who shows}} both a {{sovereign}} and a fertility character, {{often associated with}} a military one. She was present in many towns of ancient Italy: at Lanuvium as Sespeis Mater Regina, Laurentum, Tibur, Falerii, Veii as Regina, at Tibur and Falerii as Regina and Curitis, Tusculum and Norba as Lucina. She is also attested at Praeneste, Aricia, Ardea, Gabii. In five Latin towns a month was named after Juno (Aricia, Lanuvium, Laurentum, Praeneste, Tibur). Outside Latium in Campania at Teanum she was Populona (she who {{increase the number of}} the people or, in K. Latte's understanding of the iuvenes, the army), in Umbria at Pisaurum Lucina, at Terventum in Samnium Regina, at Pisarum Regina Matrona, at Aesernia in Samnium Regina Populona. In Rome she was since the most ancient times named Lucina, Mater and Regina. It is debated whether she was also known as Curitis before the evocatio of the Juno of Falerii: this though seems probable.|$|E
50|$|The Parish of Artigat (shown as Arugat on <b>the</b> Cassini Map) <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> most {{important}} parish of this Languedoc enclave. The famous case of Martin Guerre {{took place in}} Artigat.|$|R

25|$|During {{the early}} period of {{exploration}} and development of ideas, premature conference presentations and individual seminars were given by {{various members of the}} Cambridge group in other archaeological departments in England and abroad. Individual scholars who were invited to talk to us in Cambridge in that period often felt, understandably, obliged to maintain a distinct opposition. While it <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> case that these presentations had occurred before our views had even begun to settle down, and that they were excessively aggressive, they {{played an important role in}} the process of enquiry and reformulation. In particular, the contrasts which were set up by us and by outside scholars allowed the views of the seminar group, and the differences of viewpoint within the group, to be clarified. The opposition highlighted our own opinion but also threw the spotlight on the blind alleys down which there was a danger of straying. Our aggression resulted from the conviction that we were doing something new. This, too, was important. In the initial period there was a clear idea of what was wrong with existing approaches and there was a faith that something else could be done.|$|E
25|$|Of all {{the city}} gates and triumphal arches built during the Neoclassical period, {{the most famous}} and monumental <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> Arco della Pace. It was built during the Kingdom of Italy period {{at the end of}} the Corso Sempione road, the {{principal}} axis connecting the city to France under whose dependency the Kingdom came. Designed by Luigi Cagnola, construction began in 1805 only to be suspended a few years later. It was completed in 1816 at the instigation of Francis I of Austria. He called it the arch for European peace which had been achieved the previous year at the Congress of Vienna. The arch consists of three fornices with four giant order Corinthian columns. The entablature depicts allegories of the main rivers of the region, the Po, Ticino, Adige and Tagliamento, sculpted by Pompeo Marchesi. On top is a group of bronze sculptures from designs by Luigi Cagnola. The Chariot of Peace (Sestiga della Pace), representing Napoleon's victories, was originally designed to face the Corso Sempione but was later repositioned to overlook the city. Similarly, the arch's bas-reliefs were intended to depict Napoleon's exploits but when work began, under the influence of the Austrians, some of the scenes were changed to represent episodes from the Restoration and the Congress of Vienna while others depicting Napoleon were replaced with heads resembling Francis I. The customs offices on either side of the Arco della Pace date from 1838.|$|E
25|$|The minbar, {{situated}} {{on the right of}} the mihrab, is used by the imam during the Friday or Eids sermons, is a staircase-shaped pulpit with an upper seat, reached by eleven steps, and measuring 3.93 meters length to 3.31 meters in height. Dated from the ninth century (about 862) and erected under the reign of the sixth Aghlabid ruler Abul Ibrahim (856-863), it is made in teak wood imported from India. Among all the pulpits of the Muslim world, it <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> oldest example of minbar still preserved today. Probably made by cabinetmakers of Kairouan (some researchers also refer to Baghdad), it consists of an assembly of more than 300 finely carved wood pieces with an exceptional ornamental wealth (vegetal and geometric patterns refer to the Umayyad and Abbasid models), among which about 90 rectangular panels carved with plenty of pine cones, grape leaves, thin and flexible stems, lanceolate fruits and various geometric shapes (squares, diamonds, stars, etc.). The upper edge of the minbar ramp is adorned with a rich and graceful vegetal decoration composed of alternately arranged foliated scrolls, each one containing a spread vine-leaf and a cluster of grapes. In the early twentieth century, the minbar had a painstaking restoration. Although more than eleven centuries of existence, all panels, with the exception of nine, are originals and are in a good state of conservation, the fineness of the execution of the minbar makes it a great masterpiece of Islamic wood carving referring to Paul Sebag. This old chair of the ninth century is still in its original location, next to the mihrab.|$|E

500|$|As Archie Griffin {{garnered}} the lion's {{share of}} the media attention in 1975, Schembechler spoke out for Bell: [...] "I think Bell's {{as good as any}} back there is anywhere.

500|$|... eason tells me, that if {{numerous}} gradations from {{a perfect}} and complex eye to one very imperfect and simple, each grade being useful to its possessor, {{can be shown}} to exist; if further, the eye does vary ever so slightly, and the variations be inherited, which <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> case; and if any variation or modification in the organ be ever useful to an animal under changing conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though insuperable by our imagination, can hardly be considered real.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} 17 {{games of the}} 1890 season, Dunlap's batting average fell to [...]172, {{and as a result}} he was {{released}} by the Alleghenies on May 15. Aside from his batting average, disagreements with Pittsburgh's manager, Guy Hecker, reportedly contributed to the decision. The Pittsburgh Dispatch quoted manager Hecker as saying, [...] "Dunlap <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> worst man to get along with that I ever met. He has had everybody in hot water during our entire western trip." [...] Others speculated that Dunlap's release was motivated by his $3,500 salary and the fact that Pittsburgh's backup second baseman, Henry Youngman, had signed for a salary of only $1,050.|$|E

500|$|Amid {{the boredom}} of the largely eventless drift, the crew ate well; ship's stores were boosted by regular hunting parties [...] which brought a harvest of seal and polar bear meat. In late October, as winter approached, De Long ordered the Edison arc {{lighting}} system erected, but the generating mechanism {{failed to produce}} even the dimmest of lights, and the apparatus was swiftly abandoned, along with the equally ineffective [...] telephone system. [...] Christmas 1879, {{and the start of}} the new year, were celebrated [...] without great joy; De Long wrote of Christmas as [...] "the dreariest day of [...] my life, and it <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> dreariest part of the world".|$|E
500|$|Kennet Allott, in {{defending}} against any possible harsh criticism of [...] "Ode to Psyche", {{argues that the}} poem [...] "is the Cinderella of Keats's great odes, {{but it is hard}} to see why it should be so neglected, and at least two poets imply that the conventional treatment of the poem is shabby and undeserved". Allott then cites Bridges and Eliot as views that he sympathizes with, and he believes that the poem [...] "is neither unflawed nor the best of odes, but to me it illustrates better than any other Keats's possession of poetic power in conjunction with what was for him an unusual artistic detachment, besides being a remarkable poem in its own right. This may be another way of saying that it is the most architectural of the odes, as it <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> one that culminates most dramatically." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing in The Guardian, critic Anthony Berkeley Cox, writing {{under the}} name Francis Iles, noted that the two minor {{grammatical}} errors he spotted were [...] "likely to spoil no one's enjoyment" [...] of the novel as he considered that On Her Majesty's Secret Service was [...] "not only up to Mr. Fleming's usual level, but perhaps even a bit above it." [...] Writing in The Guardians sister paper, The Observer Maurice Richardson pondered {{if there had been}} [...] "a deliberate moral reformation" [...] of Bond. However, he notes Bond still has his harder side when needed. Richardson also thought that [...] "in reforming Bond Mr. Fleming has reformed his own story-telling which had been getting very loose". Overall he thought that [...] "O.H.M.S.S. <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>the</b> best Bond for several books. It is better plotted and retains its insane grip until the end".|$|E
