He notified me today that there exists at the moment a particularly favorable opportunity to purchase valuable works of art from Dutch dealers and private owners in German currency. Even though {{a large number of}} important works have doubtless been removed recently from Holland, I believe that the trade still contains many objects which are desirable for the Führer's collection, and which may be acquired without foreign exchange.|$|E
25|$|After his {{expulsion}} from Rugby School for drunkenness, the young Flashman looks {{for an easy}} life. He has his wealthy father buy him an officer's commission in the fashionable 11th Regiment of Light Dragoons. The 11th, commanded by Lord Cardigan, later involved in the Charge of the Light Brigade, <b>has</b> <b>just</b> <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> India and {{are not likely to}} be posted abroad soon. Flashman throws himself into the social life that the 11th offered and becomes a leading light of Canterbury society. In 1840 the regiment is converted to Hussars with an elegant blue and crimson uniform, which assists Flashman in attracting female attention for the remainder of his military career.|$|E

He tells her it is too late for them to separate, because she has changed his view of life.|$|E

500|$|Prince Robot IV: A {{member of}} the royal family of the Robot Kingdom, {{assigned}} by Landfall as their primary pursuer of Alana and Marko {{in the beginning of the}} series when his wife is pregnant with their first child. Like others of his race, he is a humanoid with a small television set for a head, which Vaughan explains is influenced by a fascination with old televisions that he developed when he began writing for TV. He also has blue blood and the ability to morph his right arm into a cannon. In the beginning of the series, Prince Robot IV <b>has</b> <b>just</b> <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> a [...] "two–year tour of hell" [...] after which he had to be given a new leg following a brutal sneak attack. His brain [...] "reboots" [...] after he is injured confronting the family in the third story arc and he is still missing when his son is born in the fourth story arc.|$|E
500|$|On 15 March 2007, Diaby {{was called}} up to the senior team {{for the first time}} by coach Raymond Domenech for UEFA Euro 2008 {{qualifying}} match against Lithuania and a friendly against Austria. He described the call-up as a [...] "huge surprise" [...] primarily because he <b>has</b> <b>just</b> <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> his ankle fracture just two months prior. Diaby made his senior international debut in the qualifier against Lithuania appearing as a substitute for Florent Malouda. He earned his first international start in the ensuing match against Austria; the game ending in a 1–0 victory for France. Following the Austria match, Diaby went without an appearance for France for three years. The midfielder experienced several call ups to the team during the three years, but either withdrew from the squad due to injury or was not preferred by Domenech for a match. Despite this, Diaby was named to Domenech's 30-man preliminary squad to participate in the 2010 FIFA World Cup. He made his return to the international scene in the team's 2–1 friendly match win over Costa Rica. Diaby was later named to the 23-man team to serve as a possible backup in the holding midfield role.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 2008 season, O'Brien {{was named}} Northamptonshire's player of the year and was rewarded for his {{consistent}} performances with a three-year contract with the club. A representative of Northamptonshire CCC said [...] "Niall, who <b>has</b> <b>just</b> <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> international duty, was in sensational form last season with the bat, scoring over 850 championship runs and piling on the runs in one-day competitions in a new pinch-hitter role". In a tour match against Australia during the 2009 Ashes in July 2009, O'Brien made scores of 30 and 58 in a match Northamptonshire lost. During his half century, he scored seven boundaries off the struggling Mitchell Johnson.|$|E
2500|$|Many critics {{agree that}} in Richard II, this {{central theme of}} the king's two bodies unfolds in three main scenes: the scenes at the Coast of Wales, at Flint Castle, and at Westminster. At the coast of Wales, Richard <b>has</b> <b>just</b> <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> a trip to Ireland and kisses the soil of England, demonstrating his kingly {{attachment}} to his kingdom. This image of kingship gradually fades as Bolingbroke's rebellion continues. Richard starts to forget his kingly nature as his mind becomes occupied by the rebellion. This change is portrayed in the scene at Flint Castle during which {{the unity of the}} two bodies disintegrates and the king starts to use more poetic and symbolic language. Richard's body politic has been shaken as his followers have joined Bolingbroke's army, diminishing Richard's military capacity. He has been forced to give up his jewels, losing his kingly appearance. He loses his temper at Bolingbroke, but then regains his composure as he starts to remember his divine side. At Flint castle, Richard is determined to hang onto his kingship even though the title no longer fits his appearance. However at Westminster the image of the divine kingship is supported by the Bishop of Carlisle rather than Richard, who at this point is becoming mentally unstable as his authority slips away. Biblical references are used to liken the humbled king to the humbled Christ. The names of Judas and Pilate are used to further extend this comparison. Before Richard is sent to his death, he [...] "un-kings" [...] himself by giving away his crown, sceptre, and the balm that is used to anoint a king to the throne. The mirror scene is the final end to the dual personality. After examining his plain physical appearance, Richard shatters the mirror on the ground and thus relinquishes his past and present as king. Stripped of his former glory, Richard finally releases his body politic and retires to his body natural and his own inner thoughts and griefs. Critic J. Dover Wilson notes that Richard's double nature as man and martyr is the dilemma that runs through the play eventually leading to Richard's death. Richard acts the part of a royal martyr, and due to the spilling of his blood, England continually undergoes civil war for the next two generations.|$|E
