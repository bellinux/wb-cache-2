5|$|The duo enlisted a music {{marketing}} startup company—TopspinMedia—to {{design their}} site, <b>delivery</b> <b>options</b> for the digitalmusic, and promotional webwidgets. Like {{the entirety of}} the recording process, the marketing was self-financed and controlled by the artists, with Topspin taking a portion of the money made from digital sales. This allowed the artists to control creative aspects of producing music as well as the overhead costs associated with marketing an album. The company used viralmarketing techniques to collect potential customers' e-mailaddresses and encourage them to post the album streaming on their blogs. By early November, the collected e-mail addresses amounted to 37percent of the album sales. Topspin has also created a Flickr pool encouraging users to upload screenshots of the widget posted to web sites. No advertisements were taken out for the album.|$|E

This technique uses a risk neutral interest rate simulation with a prepayment option model to recover a price which is an expectation over the possible rate outcomes.

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} the implicit <b>delivery</b> <b>option</b> in a bond futures contract {{and its effect}} on the contract's hedging effectiveness. Bond futures are widely used in hedging of government debt securities. In this thesis, the <b>delivery</b> <b>option</b> arises from the futures seller's right to choose which bond, among several deliverable bonds, will be delivered at the delivery date. To the extent this <b>delivery</b> <b>option</b> has value it should be reflected in a reduced futures price, because the buyer of futures must be compensated for the freedom of choice the seller has in choosing the asset to be delivered. The objective of the study is to price the futures contract and its <b>delivery</b> <b>option</b> in a theoretically consistent framework. In particular, the difference in valuing the option under constant interest rate and under stochastic term structure will be emphasized. Secondly, this paper studies whether the <b>delivery</b> <b>option</b> harms or helps the hedging effectiveness of the futures contract. Also, the effectiveness of the widely used conversion factor hedging method is questioned in the stochastic interest rate environment. The base for modelling the <b>delivery</b> <b>option</b> is the formula generating value for an exchange option. This formula was first introduced by Margrabe (1978) and is an extension of the Black-Scholes solution (1973) to option pricing problem. The <b>delivery</b> <b>option</b> will be modelled in the fixed interest rate environment (Hemler 1990) and under stochastic term structure (Lin and Paxson 1995). The stochastic term structure of interest rates will be represented with a term structure model by Heath, Jarrow and Morton (1992), although only the intuition of the HJM -model will be presented. The result of this paper is that the <b>delivery</b> <b>option</b> has to be included to the futures pricing formula and the theoretical equilibrium price of the futures contract with the <b>delivery</b> <b>option</b> can be obtained on a theoretically consistent basis. Secondly, there were no evidence that the <b>delivery</b> <b>option</b> would significantly harm the hedging effectiveness of the Euro-Bund futures contract. Theoretical drawbacks of the conversion factor hedging method appeared only, when hedging short-term bonds with the 10 -year Bund futures con-tract. Endast sammandrag.

40|$|In a sinking-fund bond, {{the issuer}} is {{required}} to retire portions of the bond prior to maturity, with the option of doing so either by calling the bonds by lottery, or by buying them back at their market value. This paper discusses the valuation of a default-free sinking-fund bond issue in the Vasicek (1977) and, alternatively, the Cox, Ingersoll and Ross (CIR) (1985) frameworks. We show in particular that, calling the bond issue without the <b>delivery</b> <b>option</b> 'corresponding serial', and the one without the prepayment feature 'corresponding coupon', under no-arbitrage a sinking-fund bond can be priced either {{in terms of the}} corresponding coupon bond and a bond call option, or in terms of the corresponding serial and a bond put option. We also present a detailed comparative-statics analysis of our valuation model, where we show that a sinking-fund bond has a stochastic duration intermediate between the ones of the corresponding serial and coupon bonds. We argue that such a feature gives a further rational for the presence of the <b>delivery</b> <b>option.</b> Moreover, we compare our results with the ones of Ho (1985), who has previously discussed the valuation problem under scrutiny. sinking-fund bonds, <b>delivery</b> <b>option,</b> term structure models, Vasicek, CIR,...|$|R

40|$|Under {{standard}} assumptions the reduced-form {{credit risk}} model is {{not capable of}} accurately pricing the two fundamental credit risk instruments - bonds and credit default swaps (CDS) - simultaneously. Using a data set of euro-denominated corporate bonds and CDS our paper quantifies this mispricing by calibrating such a model to bond data, and subsequently using it to price CDS, resulting in model CDS spreads up to 50 % lower on average than observed in the market. An extended model is presented which includes the <b>delivery</b> <b>option</b> implicit in CDS contracts emerging since a basket of bonds is deliverable in default. By using a constant recovery rate standard models assume equal recoveries for all bonds and hence zero value for the <b>delivery</b> <b>option.</b> Contradicting this common assumption, case studies of Chapter 11 filings presented in the paper show that corporate bonds do not necessarily trade at equal levels following default. Our extension models the implied expected recovery rate of the cheapest-to-deliver bond and, applied to data, largely eliminates the mispricing. Calibrated recovery values lie between 8 % and 47 % for different obligors, exhibiting strong variation among rating classes and industries. A cross-sectional analysis reveals that the implied recovery parameter depends on proxies for the <b>delivery</b> <b>option,</b> primarily the number of available bonds and bond pricing errors. No evidence is found for a direct influence of the bid-ask spread, notional amount, coupon, or rating used as proxies for bond market liquidity. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{contribution}} of this thesis is {{to study the}} impact of different risk factors on bond prices and credit default swap (CDS) premia to explore {{the extent to which}} the different factors or sensitivities cause diverging price behavior. In particular, I focus on contractual differences between bonds and CDS and on the instrument-specific liquidity as two potential reasons for divergence, and I separate bond yield spreads and CDS premia into a credit risk, liquidity, correlation, and <b>delivery</b> <b>option</b> component. My main result is that CDS markets are systematically affected by liquidity premium surcharges for protection buyers. The reason is a prevailing demand pressure which increases CDS ask premia more strongly than bid premia. Bond and CDS liquidity premia exhibit a mostly positive dependence on credit risk premia, but the precise behavior depends on the rating class. The cross-market relation of the liquidity premia can be consistently interpreted by demand relations between the bond and the CDS market, and my results are robust against the inclusion of the <b>delivery</b> <b>option</b> in CDS contracts...|$|R
