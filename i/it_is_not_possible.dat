5|$|As {{opposed to}} film makers, virtual camera system creators {{have to deal}} with a world that is {{interactive}} and unpredictable. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> to know where the player's character {{is going to be in}} the next few seconds; therefore, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> to plan the shots as a film maker would do. To solve this issue, the system relies on certain rules or artificial intelligence to select the most appropriate shots.|$|E

50|$|As soon as {{the film}} was wound forwards, the light meter would switch on. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> to switch <b>it</b> off manually, so {{the only way to}} {{conserve}} battery would be to delay advancing the film until the next exposure. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> to attach a winder or motor to the camera.|$|R

5|$|Although less used, the {{separability}} {{assumption is}} considered more general because every stochastic process has a separable version. It {{is also used}} when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> to construct a stochastic process in a Skorokhod space. For example, separability is assumed when constructing and studying random fields, where the collection of random variables is now indexed by sets other than the real line such as -dimensional Euclidean space.|$|E
5|$|As of 2009, {{passengers}} of two-axle vehicles (such as {{cars and}} motorcycles) pay tolls of 65¢ in cash or 55¢ if Pikepass is used. Drivers in vehicles {{with more than}} two axles, such as truckers, pay higher tolls. Tolls are collected at the single barrier toll plaza between the US-177 and Roff interchanges. Due to the partial interchanges, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> to legally use the turnpike without passing through this toll plaza. The toll is the same regardless of the point of entry or exit.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of a nominal roll or other records listing the Australians {{who took part in the}} D-Day landings, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> to {{determine}} the exact number involved. However, it has been estimated that about 3,000 Australian military personnel and merchant seamen participated in the operation. The total number of Australians killed on 6 June was 14, of whom 12 were RAAF airmen and two were members of the RAN.|$|E

5|$|Halley has {{probably}} been in its current orbit for 16,000–200,000 years, although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> to numerically integrate its orbit {{for more than a}} few tens of apparitions, and close approaches before 837 AD can only be verified from recorded observations. The non-gravitational effects can be crucial; as Halley approaches the Sun, it expels jets of sublimating gas from its surface, which knock it very slightly off its orbital path. These orbital changes cause delays in its perihelion of four days, average.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> to {{estimate}} the chances of another very bright Kreutz comet arriving in the near future, but given that at least 10 have reached naked eye visibility over the last 200 years, another great comet from the Kreutz family seems almost certain to arrive at some point. Comet White–Ortiz–Bolelli in 1970 reached an apparent magnitude of 1. In December 2011, Kreutz sungrazer C/2011 W3 (Lovejoy) survived its perihelion passage and had an apparent magnitude of −3.|$|E
5|$|Items of {{jewellery}} {{made before}} the death of Queen Victoria in 1901 are regarded as heirlooms owned by the Queen in right of the Crown and pass from one monarch to the next in perpetuity. Objects made later, including official gifts, can also be added {{to that part of}} the Royal Collection at the sole discretion of the monarch. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> to say how much the collection is worth because the jewels have a rich and unique history, and they will likely never be sold on the open market.|$|E

5|$|On both trains, the {{locomotive}} faces towards Hogsmeade station; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> for the trains to face King's Cross. The Hogwarts Express enters King's Cross in reverse but forwards at Hogsmeade; the train departs King's Cross forwards and in reverse at Hogsmeade. As a result, the trains are only {{designed to be}} seen from one side as {{the locomotive}}s' false driving wheels and specific detailing only exist on one side.|$|E
5|$|Sōryūs {{second wave}} {{consisted}} of nine A6M Zeros and seventeen D3As. The former attacked Naval Air Station Kaneohe Bay, losing one Zero to American anti-aircraft guns. On the return trip, the Zero pilots {{claimed to have}} shot down two American aircraft while losing two of their own. The D3As attacked various ships in Pearl Harbor, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> to identify which aircraft attacked which ship. Two of them were shot down during the attack.|$|E

Although some of those deaths were probably latent stochastic (random) effects of the accident, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> to draw any definitive conclusions from such a small sample set.|$|E
5|$|After Calabi–Yau {{manifolds}} {{had entered}} physics {{as a way}} to compactify extra dimensions, many physicists began studying these manifolds. In the late 1980s, Lance Dixon, Wolfgang Lerche, Cumrun Vafa, and Nick Warner noticed that given such a compactification of string theory, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> to reconstruct uniquely a corresponding Calabi–Yau manifold. Instead, two different versions of string theory called type IIA string theory and type IIB can be compactified on completely different Calabi–Yau manifolds giving rise to the same physics. In this situation, the manifolds are called mirror manifolds, and {{the relationship between the two}} physical theories is called mirror symmetry.|$|E
5|$|As of 1994, {{the line}} was intact and {{operational}} from Ganddal to Foss-Eigeland and the cement factory there. Here, an internal crane track has been welded across the line. From Foss-Eigeland to Figgjo, the track is intact. At Figgjo, a bridge has been demolished, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>possible</b> to traverse that section. Except {{for a number of}} level crossings where the tracks have been asphalted over, the line remains intact to Ålgård. At Ålgård Station the tracks have been removed, but the station building and depot remains. The station at Foss-Eigeland has been converted to a church, while the station at Figgjo had been taken over by a wholesaler. The line has officially been closed, but has not been abandoned. The Norwegian National Rail Administration retains ownership and can in the future renovate the line for operation.|$|E
