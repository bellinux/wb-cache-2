50|$|Ultra low volume (ULV) fogging {{machines}} are cold fogging machines that use {{large volumes of}} air at low pressures to transform liquid into droplets that are dispersed into the atmosphere. This type of fogging machine can produce extremely small droplets with diameters ranging from 1-150 µm. ULV {{machines are}} used for applying pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, sterilizers, and disinfectants amongst other chemicals. The size of the droplet is very important as each application has an optimal droplet size. The optimum droplet sizes are between 5 and 20 µm for flying insects, 20 to 40 µm for leaf nematodes and 30 to 50 µm for fungi.Low volume refers to the low volume of carrier fluid that is required with these types of machines. The droplets that are created are of such a small size that less carrier for the formulation is required to cover the required surface area. The best way to {{understand the concept of}} using less formulation to cover a larger surface area {{is to look at the}} mathematical side of the scenario. In the case where the diameter of a droplet is reduced to half its original size then the amount of droplets that can be formed from the same volume of formulation will increase eightfold.

As the water droplet is very conductive the induced charges will reside on the surface. The droplet has no net charge but one positive and one negative side.

50|$|Investigations {{show that}} in all cases gas {{atomisation}} of molten metal yields {{a broad range of}} droplet diameters, typically in the range 10-600 µm diameter, with a mean diameter of ~100 µm. <b>Droplet</b> <b>diameter</b> governs the dynamic behaviour of the droplet in flight which in turn determines the time available for in-flight cooling which is critical in controlling the resulting billet microstructure. At a flight distance of 300-400 mm, predictions show droplet velocities of 40-90 ms−1 for droplet diameters in the range 20-150 µm respectively, compared to measured velocities of ~100 ms−1, and at distances of up to 180 mm from the atomiser, droplets were still being accelerated by the gas. Droplets cool in-flight predominantly by convection and radiation, and can experience undercooling of up to 300 C prior to nucleation. Models and experimental measurements show that small droplets (<50 µm) very rapidly become fully solid prior to deposition, 50-200 µm droplets will be typically semi-solid and droplets of diameters >200 µm will be liquid at deposition. The range of droplet dynamic and thermal histories result in a billet top surface of 0.3 to 0.6 solid fraction. Not all material that impacts the surface is incorporated into the billet: some solid droplets will bounce or splash-off the billet top surface or be directed out of the deposition region by turbulent gas movement in the chamber. The proportion of droplets that impact the surface compared to the proportion that are incorporated into the billet has been termed the sticking efficiency: dependent on the geometric sticking which {{is a function of the}} spray angle relative to substrate and the thermal sticking efficiency dependent on spray and billet solid/liquid fraction.|$|E

In this work, the spray and atomization characteristics were investigated for commercial No. 2 diesel fuel, biodiesel (FAME) derived from waste cooking oil (B 100), 20 % biodiesel blended diesel fuel (B 20), renewable diesel fuel produced in house, and civil aircraft jet fuel (Jet-A). <b>Droplet</b> <b>diameters</b> and particle size distributions were measured by a laser diffraction particle analyzing system and the spray tip penetrations and cone angles were acquired using a high speed imaging technique. All experiments were conducted by employing a common-rail high-pressure fuel injection system with a single-hole nozzle under room temperature and pressure. The experimental results showed that biodiesel and jet fuel had different features compared with diesel. Longer spray tip penetration and larger <b>droplet</b> <b>diameters</b> were observed for B 100. The smaller droplet size of the Jet-A were believed to be caused by its relatively lower viscosity and surface tension. B 20 showed similar characteristics to diesel but with slightly larger droplet sizes and shorter tip penetration. Renewable diesel fuel showed closer droplet size and spray penetration to Jet-A with both smaller than diesel. As a result, optimizing the trade-off between spray volume and droplet size for different fuels remains a great challenge. However, high-pressure injection helps to optimize the trade-off of spray volume and droplet sizes.

The droplet spacing is approximately 1. 0 mm (8 <b>droplet</b> <b>diameters).</b> The CARS measurements indicate a flame surrounding the droplet stream located I mm (8 <b>droplet</b> <b>diameters)</b> from the stream centerline. The temperature profile shows a local minimum temperature a the stream centerline. Moving radially outward from the centerline, the temperature rises at the flame (about 2000 K), and then falls gradually to room temperature. The local minimum temperature is more pronounced on lines through droplet centers than on lines between adjacent droplets. The results also show that the temperature profile between adjacent droplets becomes more uniform as the droplets move downstream. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved...|$|R
