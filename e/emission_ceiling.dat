5000|$|On November 23, 2009, Premier Jean Charest {{announced}} {{targets for}} reducing greenhouse gases during the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen. Quebec will cut its emissions by 20% {{by the year}} 2020 compared to international reference of 1990. On January 14, 2010, a new law came into force to reduce greenhouse gases from automobiles which represent 40% of Quebec GHGs. This new law stipulates that car manufacturers serving the territory of Quebec must meet an <b>emission</b> <b>ceiling</b> of 187 grams of GHG/km or approximatively 7.7 L/100 km. This level must be reduced annually up to 127 grams of GHG/km or approximatively 5.3 L/100 km in 2016. These standards are as stringent as those in California (United States), according to the Government of Quebec. The provincial government plans to offer up to $8,000 rebate towards the purchase of an electric car. The government hopes that by 2020, a quarter of cars purchased in Quebec will be electric. The plan would position Quebec as a world leader in electrified transportation according to Jean Charest. Quebec became the first region in North America to set a carbon tax. Since 2007, consumers pay a special tax on gasoline. Since July 2011, Quebec has imposed a carbon tax that affect more than 85% of industries in the province. This tax will be mandatory from 2013. The sectors affected by this carbon tax will have to reduce their carbon dioxide below 25 000 kilotonnes per year. Only the forest industry, agriculture and waste industries are not affected by this tax. In addition, the Quebec government plans to recover 60% of putrescible organic matter by 2015 {{in order to reduce}} its emissions. Quebec climate policy has been harshly criticised by the federal government under Prime minister Stephen Harper. In 2010, former minister Jim Prentice has openly criticized Quebec's plan to set GHG standards for motor vehicles sold in the province, describing it as [...] "lunatic". However, ten months later, Prentice successor, John Baird, has praised Quebec as a world leader in GHG abatement.|$|E

We argue that three main concerns promoted by the European Union in The Hague, i. e. a 50 % national <b>emission</b> <b>ceiling</b> (the supplementarity principle), the use of carbon sinks and an international market control system, can be solved by less restrictions on free GHG trade and by establishing the World Trade Organization as an international authority. Because the US face much higher future reduction costs than the EU, the US will be imposed considerably higher costs than the negotiations in Kyoto were based on. Thus, to make the US stay in an international GHG emission- trading scheme, the EU must reconsider and acknowledge US claims for cheaper reduction options and the right to trade ‘hot air. ’ This point is important. If the US do not participate, the increase in emissions will be much higher than the emission reduction following the EU supplementarity proposal.

40|$|In {{december}} 2003 the Dutch Government has {{set down}} a national programme for {{the reduction of}} sulphur dioxide (SO 2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) and ammonia (NH 3) in an implementation memorandum called 'Erop or Eronder'. For this memorandum, the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (RIVM/MNP) took {{on the task of}} updating the emission projections according to the latest insights into emission sources, policies and trends up to 2010. The updated emission projections for SO 2, NOX, NH 3, NMVOC (and also PM 10) will be presented in this report. The projection includes current policy decisions up to July 2003. Effects of new measures announced in the implementation memorandum 'Erop of Eronder' have not been considered in the projections {{with the exception of the}} Dutch NOx-emission trading system. Projections show that given current policies, the emission ceilings for SO 2, NOX and NMVOC will probably not be met in 2010. Additional measures are needed. The <b>emission</b> <b>ceiling</b> for NH 3 seems attainable, although there is still a chance that the ceiling will be exceeded. Results show that the ceiling for SO 2, NOX and NMVOC will be exceeded by approximately 15, 28 and 15 million kg, respectively.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the use of environmental economics at the European Commission in recent policy making concerning climate change, energy, and air pollution. In particular, we describe economic analysis of policy options designed to help the European Union (EU) to achieve its objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent and increasing the share of renewable energy to 20 percent by 2020. This analysis looked at cost-effectiveness and emission trading options as well as equity issues. We also discuss an economic analysis of policy options for including {{carbon capture and storage}} (CCS) in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. The analysis finds that CCS could result in significant cost savings. The additional costs of making CCS mandatory or using subsidies were also estimated. Economic assessments prepared for the revision of the national <b>emission</b> <b>ceiling</b> directive suggest that air pollution objectives can be met at modest costs and that monetary benefits exceed costs. The assessments also find that limiting the additional costs for poorer Member States does not increase overall costs significantly and that when limited to regional zones, emissions trading of air pollutants could save costs but might lead to hot spots.

Our parameters approximate the abatement costs of sources in a proposed tradable emissions market for the reduction of nitrogen in the Port Phillip Watershed in Victoria, Australia. We vary across treatments the initial (pre-trade) allocation of permits to sources, so that in one treatment the seller of permits is a monopolist and in another treatment the selling side of the market is duopolistic. We also vary the information that subjects have about the number and abatement costs of their competitors. We find that prices and seller profits are higher and efficiency is lower on average in the monopoly sessions compared to the duopoly sessions, but the differences are not substantial and are not statistically significant due to pronounced variation across sessions...|$|E

This information is necessary to support European air quality policies with knowledge on time delays of ecosystem damage or recovery caused by changes, in time, of acidifying deposition. This manual has been requested by bodies under the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) to support {{the extension of the}} European critical load database with dynamic modelling parameters.

This phase of Eurodelta investigates how different air quality models would represent the effect on pollutant impacts of applying, on a European scale, emission reductions to individual emission sectors. The reason for doing this is to test whether there are important sensitivities not captured by the sound science approach to air quality policy making on a European scale {{which is based on}} an integrated assessment (IA) approach and embodied in the IIASA RAINS/GAINS model. This study shows that there are important differences between sectors in the amount of concentration (deposition) reduction obtained by changing a pollutant emission. This difference is not accounted for in the present process used to evaluate future national emissions ceiling reductions for both beneficial effect and cost-effectiveness.

40|$|Climate {{change is}} one of the main threats to mankind. The European Union is {{committed}} to limit the global temperature increase to 2 degrees, relative to pre-industrial levels. To meet this goal, the European Commission has analyzed greenhouse gas reduction scenarios using the partial equilibrium model POLES to analyze changes in energy use. The greenhouse gas reduction scenario assumes dedicated policies that result in fuel and technology shifts, and most importantly energy savings. As a result not only greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions change (- 25 % by 2050 compared to 1990), but also the emissions of air pollutants decrease. This is beneficial for air quality, but also causes a net warming of climate, since removal of aerosols leads to an increased radiative forcing (RF). Air pollution and GHG policies are often developed independently. To limit the effects of the burning of fossil fuels and biomass on the deterioration of air quality, human health and vegetation, many developed countries have issued stringent regulations and it is likely that developing countries will follow. We assume that by 2030 the world will have implemented the technology according to the European National <b>Emission</b> <b>Ceiling</b> Directive for 2020. These technologies and measures often encompass cleaner fuels and modern techniques, leading to less energy use. We consider the following four scenarios for the year 2030...|$|E

Here, information on the projected emissions in 2010 was reported, along with adopted and envisaged policies to further reduce emissions, and quantified estimates of the effect of such policies and measures. Emission calculations for this report have been done by the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (RIVM/MNP). Results of these calculations are documented here. Emission reductions are calculated for a package of 12 policy options envisaged by the Dutch Government; however social and political support for these envisaged measures was not considered. Such social and political support has however been taken aboard in the official government report to the commission.

40|$|According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global {{greenhouse}} gas (GHG) emissions must {{be reduced by}} 50 to 85 percent by 2050 to avoid dramatic consequences of global warming. Enhanced energy efficiency and increased renewable energy production {{is not enough to}} give the required emission reduction, and CO 2 capture and storage (CCS) is therefore required as a bridging technology to the renewable society. CCS can be commercially viable by 2020 if new regulations and incentives are established, or else CCS will be a reality too late to meet the climate challenge. The required regulations and incentives are: (1) adaptation of regulations that allows and regulate CO 2 capture and storage, (2) incentives to ensure demonstration projects are established by 2015, and (3) market regulations to establish a market for CCS from 2020. Adaptation of the proposed EU directive on CO 2 storage will be a good start to establish the necessary regulations, and incentives for demonstration projects should be a combination of EU funding, Member State funding and contribution from industry. Market regulation for CCS should be a based on the EU ETS combined with low emission certificates or emission performance standards.

The Reference projection is based on assumptions regarding economic, structural, technological and policy developments. Two scenarios have been used: the Strong Europe (SE) scenario is characterized by moderate economic growth and strong public responsibility, the Global Economy (GE) scenario assumes high economic growth and has a strong orientation towards private responsibility. Energy consumption continues to grow in both scenarios and energy intensity is declining in the GE scenario. Gradual rise of temperature is now included in the estimates for space heating and air conditioning. Energy prices for end users will rise, due to increased imports of natural gas and rising costs of electricity generation. The share of renewables in electricity consumption increases considerably due to subsidies for wind at sea and biomass, up to the target of 9 % in 2010. Emissions of non-CO 2 greenhouse gases are reduced and stabilise after 2010. The Dutch Kyoto target is met in both scenarios, assuming considerable emission reduction efforts abroad.

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} Dutch {{industrial}} environmental policy on emissions of Volatile Organic Substances (VOC) in the last 15 years and provides insight into VOC emissions in the Netherlands in 2010. Up till now, voluntary agreements between public authorities and industrial branches {{within the framework of}} the Dutch VOC 2000 programme, called KWS 2000, have made an important contribution to the VOC policy. Voluntary agreements are concluded to be reasonably successful. The target for reducing industrial VOC emissions by at least 55 % between 1981 and 2000 through the implementation of environmental technologies has been reached. Different factors of influence (e. g. policy instruments) on the implementation process were characterised for five important industrial branches. A new expert-support computer model was used as a tool to simulate the implementation of environmental technologies and to provide insight into the basic assumptions and data used. The success of the voluntary agreements was found in the embedding of the agreements in the practice of granting and enforcing permits in combination with the availability and affordability (from a company point of view) of technologies, and the compatibility of these with the existing technological system. Considering the present environmental policy pressure on VOC emission reduction, about 15 % emission reduction at the most can be achieved between 2000 and 2010 in the evaluated branches of industry. Intensification of policy pressure could lead to about 30 - 35 % reduction.

Such a ceiling policy {{can be carried out}} either in full cooperation of all (major) carbon emitting countries or by a sub-global climate coalition.

In a two-country two-period general equilibrium model with a non-renewable fossil- energy resource we characterize the unilateral cost-effective ceiling policy and compare it with its fully cooperative counterpart. We show that with full cooperation there exists a cost-effective ceiling policy in which only first-period emissions are taxed at a rate that is uniform across countries. In contrast, the cost-effective ceiling policy of a sub-global climate coalition is characterized by emission regulation in both periods. That policy may consist either of positive tax rates in both periods or of negative tax rates (= subsidies) in both periods or of a positive rate in the first and a negative rate in the second period.

40|$|How to {{implement}} emission trading is one {{question in the}} current negotiations on a new sulfur protocol in Europe. Whereas the current protocol stipulates a 30 percent uniform reduction, national <b>emission</b> <b>ceilings</b> included in the proposed new protocol imply differentiated reductions.

Emission trading combined with regulations is a new element in the paper. Calculations using the RAINS (Regional Acidification INformation and Simulation) model suggest that overlaying emission trading on regulations not only reduces the cost savings but has beneficial impacts as well: ecosystem protection is not changed and significant decreases in environmental benefits for countries are largely avoided. Emission trading {{can also be used}} to decrease emissions and increase ecosystem protection. If combined with existing legislation, emission trading minimizes losses in expected environmental benefits for some countries, and most countries gain. However, the initial distribution of <b>emission</b> <b>ceilings</b> has to be used so that some countries are not confronted with higher costs. Trade-offs appear to exist between the use of emission trading to achieve cost savings on the one hand, and ecosystem protection and distributional equity on the other.

40|$|In past years, the European {{limit value}} for average annual NO 2 {{concentration}} has been exceeded in city streets and along motorways in the Netherlands. By 2015 the limit value must be adhered {{to in the}} Netherlands. Although the total road length for which exceedance is likely is expected to decrease over the coming years, exceedances may still occur by 2015. Future NO 2 concentrations not only depend on economic growth, current and proposed policies, and on inevitable meteorological fluctuations, they also depend {{on the effectiveness of}} technical measures to reduce emissions. New emission measurements for heavy-duty vehicles in the Euro-V (and Euro-III) emission standard categories, carried out under typical Dutch driving conditions, have revealed that real-world NOx emissions from these trucks are significantly higher than was previously estimated based on the reduction steps in the Euro emission standards. Emission levels were higher, by about a factor of three, along city streets, and 10 to 40 % higher along motorways. These higher emission levels resulted in higher estimated national NOx emissions, increasing from 250 kt to 264 kt, compared with the national <b>emission</b> <b>ceiling</b> of 260 kt, to be adhered to by 2010. The higher emissions more than double the total road length with possible exceedance (chance > 33 %) of the NO 2 limit value; from about 100 km to about 250 km along cities streets and motorways, by 2015.

40|$|The {{baseline}} scenario for agricultural ammonia emissions in 2010 {{is based on}} existing and proposed environmental legislation. Alternative scenarios are {{used to assess the}} effect of individual policy measures. The agricultural ammonia emission in the {{baseline scenario}} is estimated at 106 million kg ammonia, while the reduction, with proposed legislation, for low-emission pig and poultry animal housing is estimated at 11 million kg ammonia. The effect of lower application rates of nitrogen and phosphate to agricultural soils in the 2000 - 2004 period has resulted in an additional reduction of 7 million kg ammonia. Finally, the regulations for closure of pig and poultry farms in 2000 resulted in an ammonia reduction of 7 million kg. The effect of these three measures is already included in the baseline scenario. Additional future legislation may include use of specific low-emission techniques for landspreading animal manure on grassland on sandy soils and arable land on all soils, limiting the maximum level of milk urea and the use of low-emission cattle housing. The corresponding emission reduction employing these three additional measures has been calculated at 17 million kg ammonia. It can therefore be concluded from the above findings that the Dutch national ammonia <b>emission</b> <b>ceiling</b> of 128 million kg ammonia is feasible for 2010, taking into account that non-agricultural ammonia emissions amount to 14 - 15 million kg.

40|$|The Dutch Cabinet has {{set down}} a {{national}} programme, drawn {{up in the}} framework of the European Directive on national emission ceilings (the NEC Directive), in an Implementation Memorandum, 'Make it or break it'. On request of the Cabinet, the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (MNP) - RIVM took on the evaluation of the objectives and cost-effectiveness of this programme for. Conclusions and recommendations are reported here. A major conclusion is the strong probability that the Netherlands will not meet its international emission obligations for 3 out of 4 NEC compounds, SO 2, NOx and NMVOCs. Many of the measures and options for additional measures are not concrete and lack sufficient policy instruments for implementation. The choice made to translate national ceilings into sector targets has not been accepted by any of the sectors. This increases the risks surrounding implementation because of the uncertainty in the results of the policy package. Furthermore, the passage of time may mean that some of the reductions needed cannot be realised, making a declaration of default a very real possibility. In the case of ammonia, current policies may be sufficient to meet the target, although there is still a chance that the <b>emission</b> <b>ceiling</b> will be exceeded. Additional measures proposed are expected to bring the ammonia emissions under the ceiling. It will be possible to update the policy programme in 2006. In the meantime, it still {{remains to be seen whether}} 'Make it or break it' has set out the right implementation course for realising the Dutch national emission ceilings...|$|E

This group has many countries with the greatest obligations to reduce emissions, according with the Annex B of the Kyoto Protocol (United Nations 1998). As asserted by Peters et al. (2011), these countries have shifted an increasing proportion of their CO 2 emissions to countries without <b>emissions</b> <b>ceilings.</b>|$|R

However, national <b>emission</b> <b>ceilings</b> {{laid down in}} European Commission's Directive status reports are not based on actual recorded pollution but on computed theoretical modelling such as e.g. TREMOVE, TREMOD or COPERT[78]. Modelling of toxic traffic emissions may thus be based on overall national fuel consumption[19]. Even that, any model acknowledges to comprise potential errors - e.g. TREMOVE considers these to be 17 % to 19 % of computed NO [...]...|$|R

The most important regulations are the directives 2001 / 81 /EC; National <b>Emission</b> <b>Ceilings</b> for certain pollutants and 96 / 61 /EC; Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control, and the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). These directives state that the emission of ammonia from poultry houses must decrease and that each farm must have a permit. Poultry farmers in Holland must use a housing system with an ammonia emission that is not higher than given maximum levels...|$|R
