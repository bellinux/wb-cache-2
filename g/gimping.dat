5000|$|A [...] is a {{term for}} {{improving}} or modifying items, skills, abilities, or stats, as opposed to direct nerfing or <b>gimping.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1828 an {{improvement}} {{was made to}} drive the bobbin carriage at intervals, thus leaving time for 'shogging' the guidebars between each movement. In 1841 use of a knob Jacquard allowed the insertion of thick thread (liner). The knobs allowed a greater distance and allowed the automatic <b>gimping</b> around flowered patterns.|$|E
5000|$|The bobbin threads tie the top {{and bottom}} board threads to the pillars. The bobbin threads are carried on brass bobbins that are held in {{carriages}} that are swung back and forth on combs in a pushing and catching routine. Pillaring is controlled by the pillaring cam; in net formation the pillars must be connected and this can be done by the spool threads (top or bottom board). These are secured each time by the bobbin threads. Patterning or <b>gimping</b> is created by using longer shogs on the spool threads.|$|E
50|$|The XCF {{file format}} is {{backward}} compatible (all versions of <b>GIMP</b> can open earlier versions' files) {{and in some}} cases, forward compatible. For example, <b>GIMP</b> 2.0 can save text in text layers while <b>GIMP</b> 1.2 can not. Text layers saved in <b>GIMP</b> 2.0 will open as ordinary image layers in <b>GIMP</b> 1.2. However, XCF files containing layer groups, a feature introduced in <b>GIMP</b> 2.7, can't be opened with <b>GIMP</b> 2.6.|$|R
25|$|<b>GIMP</b> classic: A patch against <b>GIMP</b> v2.6.8 {{source code}} created to undo changes {{made to the}} user {{interface}} in <b>GIMP</b> v2.4 through v2.6. A build of <b>GIMP</b> classic for Ubuntu is available. As of March 2011, a new patch could be downloaded that patches against the experimental <b>GIMP</b> v2.7.|$|R
25|$|<b>GIMP</b> {{operations}} can be automated with scripting languages. The Script-Fu is a Scheme-based language implemented using a TinyScheme interpreter {{built into}} <b>GIMP.</b> <b>GIMP</b> {{can also be}} scripted in Perl, Python (Python-Fu), or Tcl, using interpreters external to <b>GIMP.</b> New features {{can be added to}} <b>GIMP</b> not only by changing program code (<b>GIMP</b> core), but also by creating plug-ins. These are external programs that are executed and controlled by the main <b>GIMP</b> program. MathMap {{is an example of a}} plug-in written in C.|$|R
2500|$|Because of {{the free}} and {{open-source}} nature of <b>GIMP,</b> several forks, variants and derivatives of the computer program have been created to fit {{the needs of their}} creators. While <b>GIMP</b> is available for popular operating systems, variants of <b>GIMP</b> may be OS-specific. These variants are neither hosted nor linked on the <b>GIMP</b> site. [...] The <b>GIMP</b> site does not host <b>GIMP</b> builds for Windows or Unix-like operating systems either, although it does include a link to a Windows build.|$|R
25|$|The user {{interface}} of <b>GIMP</b> is {{designed by a}} dedicated design and usability team. This team was formed after the developers of <b>GIMP</b> signed up to join the OpenUsability project. A {{user interface}} brainstorming group has since been created for <b>GIMP,</b> where users of <b>GIMP</b> can send in their suggestions {{as to how they}} think the <b>GIMP</b> user interface could be improved.|$|R
50|$|<b>GIMP</b> 1.2.0 was {{released}} on December 25, 2000. <b>GIMP</b> 1.2 had a new development team of Manish Singh, Sven Neumann and Michael Natterer and others. <b>GIMP</b> 1.2 offered internationalization options, improved installation dialogs, many bug fixes (in <b>GIMP</b> and GTK+), overhauled plug-ins, reduced memory leaks and reorganized menus.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>GIMP</b> 1.1 series {{focused on}} fixing bugs and {{improving}} the port to Windows. No official release occurred during this series. Following this the odd numbered series (e.g. 1.1) of <b>GIMP</b> releases were considered unstable development releases and even numbered releases (e.g. 1.2) were considered stable releases. By this time, GTK+ had become a significant project and many of <b>GIMP's</b> original developers turned to GTK+ development. These included Owen Taylor (author of <b>GIMP</b> ifsCompose), Federico Mena, Tim Janik, Shawn Amundson and others. GNOME also attracted <b>GIMP</b> developers. The primary <b>GIMP</b> developers during this period were Manish Singh, Michael Natterer Sven Neumann [...] and Tor Lillqvist [...] who primarily fixed issues so that <b>GIMP</b> could run on Win32.|$|R
25|$|A GUI toolkit called GTK (<b>GIMP</b> tool kit) was {{developed}} to facilitate the development of <b>GIMP.</b> GTK was replaced by its successor GTK+ after being redesigned using object-oriented programming techniques. The development of GTK+ {{has been attributed to}} Peter Mattis becoming disenchanted with the Motif toolkit <b>GIMP</b> originally used; Motif was used up until <b>GIMP</b> 0.60.|$|R
2500|$|<b>GIMP</b> {{supports}} importing and exporting with a {{large number}} of different file formats, <b>GIMP's</b> native format XCF is designed to store all information <b>GIMP</b> can contain about an image; XCF is named after the eXperimental Computing Facility where <b>GIMP</b> was authored. [...] Import and export capability can be extended to additional file formats by means of plug-ins.|$|R

50|$|An {{official}} website was constructed for <b>GIMP</b> during the 1.0 series, designed by Adrian Likins and Jens Lautenbacher, now found at classic.gimp.org which provided introductory tutorials and additional resources. On April 13, 1997, <b>GIMP</b> News {{was started by}} Zach Beane, a site that announced plug-ins, tutorials and articles written about <b>GIMP.</b> May 1997, Seth Burgess started <b>GIMP</b> Bugs, the first 'electronic bug list'.|$|R

40|$|The {{ultimate}} {{reference and}} {{guide to the}} GNU image manipulation program. <b>GIMP</b> is a free, Photoshop-like image manipulation program, and as its use grows, so does the demand for detailed instruction {{on how to get}} the very most out of it. <b>GIMP</b> Bible is the most comprehensive and current independent <b>GIMP</b> reference available that goes beyond official documentation. If you're a digital artist or photographer, the step-by-step explanations in this authoritative guide show you how to power-use <b>GIMP</b> throughout a production pipeline. Topics include understanding the <b>GIMP</b> interface and how to work with...|$|R
50|$|GEGL was {{originally}} {{conceived as a}} <b>GIMP</b> core replacement in 2000 by Rhythm & Hues software engineers, finally in 2006 the external API was deemed stable enough and capable of replacing the <b>GIMP</b> core. On 20 December 2007, it {{was added to the}} development version of <b>GIMP.</b> Some of <b>GIMP's</b> tools have already been converted to GEGL operations; mostly tools which modify colors, brightness or contrast have been converted. As of unstable 2.9.x series, all of <b>GIMP's</b> core relies on GEGL, and almost half of filters have been replaced with GEGL operations.|$|R
25|$|The Generic Graphics Library (GEGL) {{was first}} {{introduced}} as part of <b>GIMP</b> on the 2.6 release of <b>GIMP.</b> This initial introduction does not yet exploit all of the capabilities of GEGL; as of the 2.6 release, <b>GIMP</b> can use GEGL to perform high bit-depth color operations; because of this less information is lost when performing color operations. When GEGL is fully integrated, <b>GIMP</b> will have a higher color bit depth and better non-destructive work-flow. Current distribution versions of <b>GIMP</b> only support 8-bit of color, which is much less than what e.g. digital cameras produce (12-bit or more). Full support for high bit depth is included with actual <b>Gimp</b> 2.9 Development version. For accelerations OpenCL is available for some operations.|$|R

50|$|<b>GIMP</b> 1.0.0 was {{released}} on June 2, 1998GIMP and GTK+ split into separate projects during the <b>GIMP</b> 1.0 release. <b>GIMP</b> 1.0 included a new tile based memory management system which enabled editing of larger images and {{a change in the}} plug-in API (Application programming interface) allowed scripts to be safely called from other scripts and to be self documenting. <b>GIMP</b> 1.0 also introduced a native file format (xcf) with support for layers, guides and selections (active channels).|$|R
5000|$|CinePaint is a fork of <b>GIMP</b> {{with support}} for 16 bit and 32 bit {{floating}} point channels, and 16 bit integer channels. The XCF file format used in CinePaint has diverged from the <b>GIMP's</b> native format, so XCF files created in <b>GIMP</b> cannot be opened in Cinepaint, and vice versa.|$|R

40|$|The {{intention}} {{of this article}} is to investigate the cultural power associated with the <b>gimp</b> and the <b>gimp</b> mask. The <b>gimp</b> is a clothed or costumed SM body, frequently a submissive that often wears a leather or rubber costume that covers and effectuates the entire body including the face. The <b>gimp</b> is also a representation of SM that circulates throughout fashion and film and other forms of popular culture. Since the <b>gimp’s</b> first outing and naming in the film Pulp Fiction it has become the byword for the head-to-toe leather SM look that has been appropriated by a number of designers as way of exploring and exploiting the relationship between fashion, fetishism, and transgression. As a counterpoint to the popular image of SM in fashion and film, this article also explores how the artists Catherine Opie and Robert Mapplethorpe have represented the <b>gimp,</b> not as an index of horror or transgressive style rather as an affirmative image of their own SM communities that, while still intended to shock, is an defiant attempt to rescue or reclaim the <b>gimp</b> from its negative associations...|$|R
50|$|GimPhoto is a {{modification}} of the free and open source graphics program GNU Image Manipulation Program (<b>GIMP),</b> {{with the intent to}} be a free replacement to Adobe Photoshop.It has a new menu layout, new brushes and gradient sets. Its primary purpose is to enhance <b>GIMP</b> in terms of user interface, use of the best plugins and other resources combined with the latest stable version of <b>GIMP.</b> Because the new menu layouts are much closer to Photoshop's, adaptation from Photoshop is much quicker than <b>GIMP.</b>|$|R
50|$|GTK+ was {{originally}} designed {{and used in}} the GNU Image Manipulation Program (<b>GIMP)</b> as a replacement of the Motif toolkit; at some point Peter Mattis became disenchanted with Motif and began to write his own GUI toolkit called the <b>GIMP</b> toolkit and had successfully replaced Motif by the 0.60 release of <b>GIMP.</b> Finally GTK was re-written to be object-oriented and was renamed GTK+. This was first used in the 0.99 release of <b>GIMP.</b> GTK+ was subsequently adopted for maintenance by the GNOME Foundation, which uses it in the GNOME desktop environment.|$|R

2500|$|In {{his review}} of <b>GIMP</b> for ExtremeTech in October 2013, David Cardinal noted that <b>GIMP's</b> {{reputation}} of being hard to use and lacking features has [...] "changed dramatically {{over the last couple}} years", and that it was [...] "no longer a crippled alternative to Photoshop". He described <b>GIMP's</b> scripting as one of its strengths, but also remarked that some of Photoshop's features - such as Text, 3D commands, Adjustment Layers and History - are either less powerful or missing in <b>GIMP.</b> Cardinal favorably described the UFRaw converter for raw images used with <b>GIMP,</b> noting that it still [...] "requires some patience {{to figure out how to}} use those more advanced capabilities". Cardinal stated that <b>GIMP</b> is [...] "easy enough to try" [...] despite not having as well developed documentation and help system as those for Photoshop, concluding that it [...] "has become a worthy alternative to Photoshop for anyone on a budget who doesn’t need all of Photoshop’s vast feature set".|$|R
2500|$|The <b>GIMP</b> website {{links to}} binary installers {{compiled}} by Jernej Simončič for the platform.
