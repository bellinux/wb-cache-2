40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the role of public finance in the {{economic}} development of Newfoundland since 1949. The thesis starts with a discussion of some of the imminent economic problems of the Province and a description of those features of its economy which have bearing on public revenue and expenditure. A short history of public finance in the Island is sketched from the second half of the 19 th century highlighting the financial features which culminated in Confederation in 1949. A survey of public revenue. and public expenditure is presented with a view to show how I conducive the structure of revenue and pattern of expenditure is to the development of Newfoundland The accuracy of revenue is discussed and the elasticity of individual· tax revenues is calculated. Finally capital formation is discussed in relation to fiscal policy and comparison is made between public and private capital formation. Some of the principal findings of this thesis are: 1. Although the revenue from provincial sources has increased rapidly yet the federal aid remains the biggest source of revenue. 2. The common argument that conditional grants distort the provincial priorities does not apply in the case of Newfoundland. 3. Revenue raised from provincial sources suffers from a high degree of rigidity due to earmarking of funds for certain uses and due to low elasticity of tax revenue 4. The revenue estimates suffer from a bias towards under estimation and there is no definite evidence of improvement in them. 5. While public <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> <b>material</b> and supplies has been increasing over the years, social welfare has remained the top priority despite the inadequacy of social capital. 6. Public capital formation accounts for a high share of total capital formation and the gross rate of public capital accumulation has been much higher than that of the private...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} and analysis {{presented in this}} special issue shows that the same limited number of consumption categories are consistently revealed {{to be responsible for}} the largest share of environmental impact: mobility (automobile and air transport), food (meat, poultry, fish, and dairy followed by plant-based food), and residential energy use in the house (heating, cooling, electrical appliances, and lighting). It appears that differences in impact per euro between the product groupings are relatively limited, so it is essential to reduce the life-cycle impacts of products as such, rather than to shift expenditures to less impact-intensive product groupings. Furthermore, the effectiveness of <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> <b>material</b> products to improve quality of life leaves much room for improvement. Environmentally extended input-output (EEIO) tables probably form, in this field, the most appropriate information support tool for priority setting, prospective assessment of options, scenario analysis, and monitoring. A clear benefit would result from integrating the input-output (IO) tables in the report to Eurostat of the 25 individual countries that make up the European Union (EU), with other officially available information on emissions and resources use, into a 60 -sector EEIO table for the EU. This, obviously, would be the first step toward more detailed tables. Three strategies are suggested to realize the additional, desirable detail of 150 sectors or more, each achievable at an increasing time horizon and with increasing effort: (1) developing further the current CEDA EU 25 table; (2) building a truly European detailed input-output table accepting the restrictions of existing data gathering procedures; and (3) as (2), but developing new, dedicated data gathering and classification procedures. In all cases, a key issue is harmonizing classification systems for industry sectors, consumer expenditure categories, and product classifications (as in import/export statistics) {{in such a way that}} data sets may adequately be linked to input-output tables. © 2006 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Yale University...|$|E

This paper explores the effects of long-term productivity trends in the U. S. economy and relates them to the cost of reducing CO 2 emissions. Technology change has been negatively correlated with energy prices and positively correlated with materials prices. Thus, if all prices remain constant <b>expenditures</b> <b>on</b> <b>materials</b> per unit of output will decline, and <b>expenditures</b> <b>on</b> energy per unity of output will increase. If energy prices increase, the rate of productivity growth will decrease. This trend will be very small, if measured on an annual basis, but eventually could be quite significant. A comparison with recent cost estimates of CO 2 emission control suggests that this otherwise ignored productivity effect could be the largest component of a complete cost analysis. ...|$|R

FCRM DASH groups {{are found to be}} motivated by challenges of increasing flood risk and reduced public funding, alongside a sense of stewardship and community solidarity, catalysed by a few motivated individuals. The thesis develops a conceptual framework of the different dimensions, contextual aspects and motivations for DASH activity. Case studies show that channel maintenance work by DASH groups can be effective and efficient at reducing some aspects of local fluvial flood risk for lower order flood events. By contrast, maintenance of existing sea walls by DASH groups is less efficient because of the need for significant <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> <b>materials</b> and is only efficacious if the engineering is quality controlled; its longer term effectiveness is limited by sea level rise.

40|$|In {{this chapter}} we {{identify}} {{and attempt to}} qualify the direct and indirect links that the mineral exporting sector has with other economic activity in a developing country. We find that the traditional macroeconomic models used for analysis in developed countries may not be appropriate for some developing countries because the effective constraints and linkages between sectors are significantly different. Keynesian macroeconomic models would lead us to expect that the principal channel for the mining sector’s impact on aggregate economic activity would be through its direct <b>expenditures</b> <b>on</b> labor, <b>materials</b> and transport services. To the extent that unemployed resources characterize these markets, an expansion of mining activities will generate additional income. Real income may be further increased when the income created initially is spent on domestic goods that are also produced with inputs {{that would otherwise be}} unemployed. In the case of Bolivia, which may be typical of many other less developed countries, we find that this linkage between the mining sector {{and the rest of the}} economy is relatively less important than three other ways in which the mining sector interacts with the rest of the economy. mineral sector, macro-economic impact...|$|R
40|$|This study {{deals with}} the issue of caking of mineral binding {{materials}} during storage and transportation. The author conducted a critical analysis of known methods for the protection of cement from exposure to moisture and water vapour. Common disadvantages of these methods are their low effectiveness and complexity of use in industrial and domestic environments. This article introduces a new method for hydrophobising construction materials using peat, which achieves high water repellency in the modified materials with relatively low <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> organic <b>materials.</b> The author proposes film coating of the mineral particles of dispersed hydrophilic materials as a protection mechanism against their undesirable exposure to moisture during storage. The insulating film consists of hydrophobic products (bitumens) released during thermal decomposition of the organic matter in peat. The estimated thickness of the bitumen film is about 12 nm and it does not adversely affect the flow properties of the powder. A model of the formation of film coatings on mineral particles is provided and their elemental chemical composition is determined. It is shown experimentally that the modified hydrophobic cement is protected from exposure to liquid vapours, and optimal values of organic component concentrations in the dispersed mineral matter that do not reduce the strength of cement mortar are identified...|$|R

In many ways managing a serials collection differs little from managing a bank, a soccer team, or any other organization. The fundamentals of a shared mission, commonly defined objectives, open two-way communication and clearly perceived tasks and responsibilities drive any organization to its level of appropriate success. Essential to the successful management of serials collections in libraries is an understanding of the nature of the collection being managed, and of the managerial forces at play over the collection.

PISA score was selected as an indicator representing the educational competitiveness of 22 OECD countries, and this included some independent variables, such as per capita GDP, total public <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education as a percentage of GDP, and total per capita public <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education (US dollars), affecting educational competitiveness. We employed the fuzzy set analysis method (FS/QCA) to analyze the complex causal relationships among the factors affecting educational competitiveness. The research results show that there are three significant combinations of variables affecting educational competitiveness (PISA score). Model 1 is a configuration of four variables (high total <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education as a percentage of GDP, high total per capita <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education, high ratio of private-source <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education to GDP, and high GDP), and includes Netherlands, Finland, Australia, and Ireland.
