The great majority of basic calculator mechanisms move the accumulator by starting, then moving at a constant speed, and stopping. In particular, stopping is critical, because to obtain fast operation, the accumulator needs to move quickly. Variants of Geneva drives typically block overshoot (which, of course, would create wrong results).|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Natural {{frequencies}} and dynamic response of a spur <b>gear</b> <b>sector</b> are investigated using a two dimensional {{finite element model}} that offers significant advantages for dynamic gear analyses. The gear teeth are analyzed for different operating speeds. A primary feature of this modeling is determination of mesh forces using a detailed contact analysis for each time step as the gears roll through the mesh. ANSYS software has been used on the proposed model to find the natural frequencies by Block Lanczos technique and displacements and dynamic stresses by transient mode super position method. The effect of rotational speed of the gear on the dynamic response of gear tooth has been studied and design limits have been discussed.

40|$|Impacts of {{predation}} by {{seals and}} dogfish on fish caught in gillnets {{has been largely}} neglected. This is important in Cape Cod’s Fixed <b>Gear</b> <b>Sector</b> because all discarding associated with predation is counted against the sector’s Total Allowable Catch (TAC). This results {{in a loss of}} profits for fishermen within the sector. Between June 3 rd and July 3 rd 2007, sixty-one gillnet hauls were observed during regular commercial fishing activities in order to investigate predation rates of both species. Allometric regression was used in tandem with weight conversion factors to determine the estimated total weight of eaten and discarded fish in each haul. Spatial relationships and predation rates relative to certain environmental variables were also investigated. Results showed that approximately 2, 500 lbs of fish was discarded from a total catch weight of nearly 130, 000 lbs because of predation by both seals and dogfish. This represented an estimated $ 2, 500 loss from a total catch value of $ 64, 000, signifying a 3. 53 % loss of the fishermen’s gross profits. The biggest monetary loss was associate...|$|E

40|$|The known {{attempts}} {{to create a}} continuously-adjustable gear train with solid gears have led to development of some so-called adaptive gears. The most structurally simple version of continuously- adjustable gear train is a two-wheel planetary gear. It is an obvious fact that an active regulation of gear ratio for the gear {{should be based on}} the presence of con- trolled elements (parameters) and a mechanism for their control. In respect of the mentioned gear one of the controlled elements that is a compound central toothed gear has such controlled parameter as a nominal pitch diameter. In this case it can rotate or remain motionless. Other controlled element which is a planetary carrier has its own radius as a controlled parameter and makes a rotary motion with a great speed of a leading element. The purpose of the control mechanism is to ensure radial displacement of central toothed gear and planet <b>gear</b> <b>sectors</b> in the working gear. The paper describes the mechanism modifications and considers two variants for transfer of control action from its source to an object to be controlled.

40|$|The New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC) manages New England’s {{northeast}} multispecies fishery {{with effort}} controls including gear restrictions, seasonal and permanent closures, trip and daily possession limits, and days-at-sea (DAS). The fishery operates on a soft or “target” {{total allowable catch}} (TAC) rather than a hard catch limit. Target TACs lack a closure provision, and do not require overages to be deducted from the following year’s recommended TAC. New England routinely exceeds target catch levels for multiple stocks, threatening rebuilding objectives and leading to more restrictive effort controls. Hard catch limits would provide greater control over total fishing mortality, ensuring that managers and fishermen are held accountable to objectives of the multispecies management plan and that rebuilding plans are successful. They would also eliminate the economic inefficiencies generated by input controls and provide fishermen with greater economic opportunities during the rebuilding process. Seven sub-programs within the northeast multispecies fishery are currently managed under hard catch limits including the Georges Bank hook and fixed <b>gear</b> <b>sectors,</b> the U.

Racks also feature in the theory of gear geometry, where, for instance, the tooth shape of an interchangeable set of gears may be specified for the rack, (infinite radius), and the tooth shapes for gears of particular actual radii are then derived from that. The rack and pinion gear type is employed in a rack railway.|$|R

It is argued that these changes do not so much derive from academics, employers or students taking on board an enthusiasm for new public management but are as much the consequences of deregulation of student choice and an expansion in student numbers that has not been matched in financial terms. The consequence has been to increasingly move this sector towards business and management teaching <b>geared</b> to private <b>sector</b> interests and away from its more political and social science roots. </p...|$|R

This paper investigates the role of financial systems as a crucial determinant of apparent differences in national abilities to promote innovative activities in specific sectors. Firstly, a short overview of the relevant finance and innovation literature is provided, and a synthetic view of the finance-innovation link is sketched. It is argued that national financial systems have an impact on the structure of growth through their differing abilities to promote innovation in sector-specific technology regimes. Secondly, I apply a simple econometric model to a data set consisting of 17 OECD countries and 20 manufacturing industries to identify empirical patterns. The evidence suggests that sectors characterized by high technological opportunity and a focus on product innovation perform relatively better in financial systems with large stock markets, competitive banking sectors and good accounting standards.

There is a {{pronounced}} annual, close-inshore run of large schools of tailor from New South Wales, where the fishery peaks in April–June, to Queensland where the Fraser Island fishery at {{the northern end of}} the run peaks in August–September. The commercial sector of the fishery developed over {{the first half of the}} 20 th century while the recreational beach line sector grew strongly from the late 1940 s, facilitated by rapid developments in recreational beach-fishing <b>gear.</b> The recreational <b>sector</b> appeared to have had a pronounced peak in both harvest size and fishing effort in the mid- 1990 s, after which both the recreational and commercial sectors experienced big falls driven largely by cultural change.

So far, however, limited recognition has been given to how the development of cultural industries and the creative economy as a whole influences urban transformation in the rapidly urbanising Global South, especially in Africa. In Cape Town, a steadily growing number of creative industries and ‘culturepreneurs’ (Lange 2005) are carving out new spaces from the city’s highly contested urban setting. Over the past five years, the mixed-use, inner-city fringe area of Woodstock has seen the incessant arrival of creatives from various sectors. Travelling alongside is a property <b>sector</b> <b>geared</b> towards catering specifically for the creative industries’ spatial demands by turning old industrial structures – the remains of Woodstock’s former capacity as national hub for clothing, food processing and other light manufacturing – into creative centres hosting international film studios, leading galleries and designer ‘theatre retail spaces’.
