50|$|For telecommunications, cables can be {{installed}} in water, in air or underground. In the latter case, the cables might be direct buried or installed in ducts. The first is more common for copper balanced cables; the latter for <b>fibre</b> <b>optic</b> <b>cables.</b> The ducts in which the <b>fibre</b> <b>optic</b> <b>cables</b> are installed are usually made of polyethylene. They have a size ranging from typically 25 mm to 100 mm. Sometimes they are installed as subducts in larger ducts. These larger ducts can also consist of other materials, like concrete.

Internet services were provided using VDSL and ADSL until central government introduced a national fibre optic rollout that included urban parts of Waiheke. Central government also forced the separation of the cable infrastructure from the ISPs, with the fibre backbone being mained by Chorus who has contracts with numerous ISPs. The locally owned WISP continues to provided wireless internet and some islanders use both services to ensure systems redundancy.|$|E
25|$|The LHC Computing Grid was {{constructed}} {{as part of}} the LHC design, to handle the massive amounts of data expected for its collisions. It is an international collaborative project that consists of a grid-based computer network infrastructure initially connecting 140 computing centres in 35 countries (over 170 in 36 countries as of 2012). It was designed by CERN to handle the significant volume of data produced by LHC experiments, incorporating both private <b>fibre</b> <b>optic</b> <b>cable</b> links and existing high-speed portions of the public Internet to enable data transfer from CERN to academic institutions around the world. The Open Science Grid is used as the primary infrastructure in the United States, and also as part of an interoperable federation with the LHC Computing Grid.|$|E
