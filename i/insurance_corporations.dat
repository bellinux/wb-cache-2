2500|$|Balancing {{the cost}} of care {{with the quality of}} care is a major issue in {{healthcare}} philosophy. In Canada and some parts of Europe, democratic governments {{play a major role in}} determining how much public money from taxation should be directed towards the healthcare process. In the United States and other parts of Europe, private health <b>insurance</b> <b>corporations</b> as well as government agencies are the agents in this precarious life-and-death balancing act. According to medical ethicist Leonard J. Weber, [...] "Good-quality healthcare means cost-effective healthcare," [...] but [...] "more expensive healthcare does not mean higher-quality healthcare" [...] and [...] "certain minimum standards of quality must be met for all patients" [...] regardless of health insurance status. This statement undoubtedly reflects the varying thought processes going into the bigger picture of a healthcare cost-benefit analysis. In order to streamline this tedious process, health maintenance organizations (HMOs) like BlueCross BlueShield employ large numbers of actuaries (colloquially known as [...] "insurance adjusters") to ascertain the appropriate balance between cost, quality, and necessity in a patient's healthcare plan. A general rule in the health insurance industry is as follows: This generalized rule for healthcare institutions [...] "is perhaps one of the best expressions of the practical meaning of stewardship of resources," [...] especially since [...] "the burden of proof is on justifying the more expensive intervention, not the less expensive one, when different acceptable treatment options exist." [...] And lastly, frivolous lawsuits have been cited as major precipitants of increasing healthcare costs.|$|E
