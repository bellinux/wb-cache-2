40|$|Purpose of {{the article}}: In the article we {{have focused on}} the trends {{determining}} the development of reverse logistics of <b>end-of-life</b> <b>vehicles</b> in selected European countries. The analysis concentrates on quantity of <b>end-of-life</b> <b>vehicles</b> which are especially interesting for reverse logistics because of their fitness for recovery or reuse. End-of-life products contain fully valuable elements which, according to the idea of sustainable use of resources, should be recovered. Accordingly, reverse logistics aims at protecting natural resources and the environment through reintroduction of processed waste materials into the economic cycle as valuable products and materials. Methodology/methods: The aim of the article was achieved {{on the basis of a}} critical analysis of subject literature and the analysis of statistical data. In the article the method of descriptive and mathematical statistics and dynamic analysis were used. The 2006 - 2014 years were analyzed. The data come from the data base of the Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union. The following variables were taken into account: the amount of <b>end-of-life</b> <b>vehicles</b> (in tonnes and in number of cars), reuse level (in tonnes), recovery level (in tonnes), and recycling level (in tonnes). The analysis was based on a t-Student test for two average values of dependent samples, sign test and the Wilcoxon signed rank test. In order to see if the reverse logistics actions implemented in European countries were effective, the analysis compares the average values of individual variables from the year 2014 and 2006. Measurements were done for the same countries on the same element of population. The chain indexes and the average change tempo for specified variables were calculated. The similarity of the formation of specified variables in each year was compared on the basis of the index of similarity structures. Scientific aim: The scientific aim of the article is to identify the basic trends determining the development of reverse logistics of <b>end-of-life</b> <b>vehicles</b> in selected European countries (Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, The Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Finland, United Kingdom, Norway). These trends are reflected in the amount of <b>end-of-life</b> <b>vehicles</b> designed for reuse, recovery and recycling. Findings: With respect to their total or partial processing, <b>end-of-life</b> <b>vehicles</b> are handled according to the 3 R principle (reduce, reuse, and recycle) in order to promote the concept of sustainable development. Unfortunately, the number of <b>end-of-life</b> <b>vehicles</b> in Europe is increasing which is a result of the growing economy and society's wealth. Also the ecological awareness of the producers and consumers is rising which is reflected in the increased number of <b>end-of-life</b> <b>vehicles</b> put through reuse, recovery and recycling processes. The analyzed period shows an average annual increase in the reuse, recovery and recycling indexes in most of the discussed countries. Therefore, we can speak of an increasing ecological efficiency of sustainable logistics of <b>end-of-life</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Conclusions: Sustainable logistics allows to recover value from used products. End-of-life products contain materials of full value that should be recovered, which undoubtedly fosters sustainable use of resources. European countries vary according to both the effort and the result of the <b>end-of-life</b> <b>vehicles</b> recovery which is due to economic, legal and cultural circumstances. But research shows the existence of positive trends in the realization of reuse, recovery and recycling processes of <b>end-of-life</b> <b>vehicles.</b> These tendencies should delineate further activities in this area...|$|R

50|$|Waste {{has become}} an {{important}} part of EU policy. A framework of different regulations and directives exist to improve the management of waste in the EU and EFTA countries. EU policy can be separated into product related regulation such as the ELV Directive, WEEE Directive or Battery Directive to only name a few, general waste legislation such as the Waste Framework Directive or Waste Shipment Regulation, and treatment related legislation e.g. Landfill Directive, Incineration Directive. The product related waste regulation is subordinate to the general waste regulation. An important principle of product specific regulation is that a given product can not fall under the jurisdiction of two separate directives at the same time. For instance, the lead acid battery in an <b>end-of-life</b> <b>vehicle</b> is covered under the ELV Directive, whereas a lead-acid battery being a replacement part during life cycle of the vehicle is subject to the Battery Directive.|$|E

Improper management of {{end-of-life vehicles}} endangers environment and social life in Malaysia. Excessive water, air and soil pollution are among the primary effects of improper <b>end-of-life</b> <b>vehicle</b> management. These negative impacts have led to an initiative to develop a framework for establishing <b>end-of-life</b> <b>vehicle</b> management system in Malaysia. A set of preliminary factors and underlying items have been identified from previous research efforts. Then, a large survey, with 300 respondents comprising of vehicle manufacturers and distributors, part dealers, and <b>end-of-life</b> <b>vehicle</b> collectors; and high response rate, was conducted. Responses of the survey were factor-analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 20.

40|$|Abstract in Undetermined Vehicles, {{symbolic}} {{goods of}} modern society, cause serious environmental impact in their endof- life phase owing to present end-of-life treatment practice and abandonment in nature. The enormous volume of vehicle waste, and accompanying environmental impacts, encourage seeking an environmentally effective policy solution {{to control the}} problem of end-of-life vehicles. This thesis {{is an attempt to}} explore and discuss the determinant factors, which may {{contribute to the development of}} effective and efficient <b>end-of-life</b> <b>vehicle</b> policy. Five European countries were studied: the main focus was on legislation, use of various policy instruments in systems, and financial mechanisms. Based on the experiences of the selected cases, the thesis identified several factors that influence the success or failure of the ELV system. These are: the extended producer responsibility; role of authorities; collection, and recycling and recovery targets; proper deregistration policy; sustainable financial mechanisms; cooperation among actors; wise use of regulatory requirements; and importance of monitoring. Discussion on these determinant factors, which are extracted from in-depth research on the selected <b>end-of-life</b> <b>vehicle</b> systems, may provide better understanding of the <b>end-of-life</b> <b>vehicle</b> issues and contribute to a sustainable <b>end-of-life</b> <b>vehicle</b> policy making...|$|E

This thesis reports on the research undertaken to analyse the factors affecting end-oflife vehicle value, and to investigate a costing framework to assist the vehicle recovery industry in promoting sustainable vehicle recycling. The principal objective {{of this research is}} to develop decision support tools for the vehicle recovery sector to adopt more sustainable processing strategies, whilst meeting the requirements of impending and future legislative targets. The research contributions are divided into three parts. The first part reviews the most relative research in the areas of environmental concerns relating to the automotive sector, <b>end-of-life</b> <b>vehicle</b> recovery and associated costing techniques, to identify the most relevant research directions. The second part consists of a substantial program of data collection, which included; formal interviews, survey of treatment facilities, time-studies and vehicle teardowns, to generate a costing framework for the modelling of indirect and direct costs of both pre and post-fragmentation activities in vehicle recycling. The third part includes the design and implementation of a decision support costing system that enables end-of-life stakeholders to understand the main economics that underpin their operations, and to support future investment in more sustainable vehicle recovery activities. The applicability of the research concept has been demonstrated via three case studies. The results from the case studies have shown that although most <b>end-of-life</b> <b>vehicle</b> recoverers are currently profitable due to the strong demand for scrap metal, significant improvement in their processes and value recovery is possible through strategic investment.

40|$|Nowadays, {{automotive}} {{manufacturers are}} facing with {{impact of the}} vehicle to the environment. In some European countries, Japan, USA, and Australia, laws require automotive manufacturers to take back their products {{at the end of}} their useful life and recycle them. Most of the developed countries also have set new legislation, which is planned to force automotive manufacturers to recover and recycle their products {{at the end of their}} life. Disassembly is the first step to recycle automotive components. In general, the designers do not have experience in disassembly and recycling to determine the impact of various design aspects on the disassemblability at the disassembly stage. Based on that, many researchers have proposed several methods in evaluating disassemblability. This paper reviews the evaluation methods of disassemblability which were proposed by the previous researchers and then outlines the functional requirements for a system for evaluating the disassemblabilty of automotive components based on automotive manufacturer and legislation requirements.
