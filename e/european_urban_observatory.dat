40|$|<b>Urban</b> <b>observatories</b> {{represent}} today {{a global}} phenomenon. In the last decades, public actors, universities {{and civil society}} actors have established hundreds of <b>urban</b> <b>observatories</b> all around the world. Some of these observatories actively contribute {{to the analysis of}} urban dynamics and affect urban policy making. However, <b>urban</b> <b>observatories</b> are still understudied; the scientific literature on <b>urban</b> <b>observatories</b> is rare and culturally fragmented. This article seeks to {{contribute to the development of}} a body of knowledge on <b>urban</b> <b>observatories,</b> by proposing a typology of <b>urban</b> <b>observatories</b> that stress the potential impacts and contributions of four different archetypes on urban and territorial planning and management.

40|$|The {{growth of}} urban areas, {{and all the}} {{problems}} that this fact entails, make more immediate the need to search for tools {{that are able to}} assist urban management. The <b>urban</b> <b>observatories</b> are, then, a tool that through indicators allows monitoring of the cities, assessing their progress over time. The observatories are also important to support decision making, involvement of people in decisions, data analysis and compilation and availability of data, which were previously unavailable to the general public. This paper makes a synthesis of the literature on the theme of <b>Urban</b> <b>Observatories</b> as a tool for monitoring our cities, with the objective to serve as a theoretical basis for the possible implementation of a project of this kind in Portugal...|$|R

40|$|The Regional Vancouver <b>Urban</b> <b>Observatory</b> (RVu) was {{established}} in 2004 to provide a new model for measuring and monitoring regional progress toward sustainability. RVu is the first indicator project in Canada to join the UN-Habitat Global <b>Urban</b> <b>Observatory</b> network. RVu takes up the challenge within sustainability assessment theory to analyze and inform {{at the same time}} as it attracts and unites the widest range of citizens possible toward the goal of improving our common future. This article presents the processes carried out by RVu in 2005 - 2006 to recommend sustainability indicators for the Vancouver region. While RVu’s expert process built upon rational models, RVu’s nonexpert process operationalized a systems modelling approach. RVu has aimed to mesh international expectations and regional aspirations, expert- and citizenbased views of progress, and hard line and storyline trends. The process and results hold lessons for other regions grappling to apply sustainability principles in practice...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we will make}} a brief {{presentation}} of ESCWA’s Social Guide for <b>Urban</b> <b>Observatories</b> (SGUO), then we will provide a commented example of application of its indicators’ framework. We will try to identify the essential determinants leading {{to the development of}} urban fragmentation. The SGUO indicators’ framework is a problem-based one. It aims to identify the determining conditions leading to the development of an urban “problem” and its impact on sustainable urban development. The author thinks of the SGUO indicators’ framework methodology as a building site in progress. On one hand, there’s still need to develop some of its theoretical framework components, mainly the concept of determinants. On the other, it should be revisited, in a participatory way. A primary application in a set of different <b>urban</b> <b>observatories</b> in the ESCWA region is needed in order to adapt it to the specificities of the region’s urban problems and local conceptions of sustainable development...|$|R
