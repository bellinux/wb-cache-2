40|$|In {{almost every}} field of law,from tort and {{contract}} to environmental law and criminal justice, issues about 'risk' are increasingly {{of interest to}} lawyers. At the same time, {{there has been little}} <b>general</b> <b>enquiry</b> into the nature of the contact between law and risks. This book argues that ideas about risk have not traditionally been absent from law, as is sometimes supposed. Lawyers and legal theorists have used and conceptualised risk in particular ways, and ideas of risk have had significant influence in key elements of legal theory including questions of justice and responsibility. The book explores the conceptual place of risk across a number of fields of law; and identifies some significant challenges for law and legal theory arising from broader debates about risk. It therefore sheds light on areas that are under-explored despite current interest among lawyers, and aims to provide an accessible guide to emerging controversies and challenges for law in this area while explaining their significance...|$|R

All errors and omissions remain the authors. Executive Summary There is a growing body of evidence indicating that the use of psychometric tests for selection purposes has increased in recent years. However, the data are almost entirely crosssectional. Thus, while the propensity to test, and levels of test use, can be related to various organisational characteristics such as size, costs of hiring and firing, or adoption of formal personnel policies, there is very little information on the underlying reasons for changes (and increases) in use. (See Jenkins, 2001 a; Jenkins and Wolf, 2002.) This paper reports findings from a series of in-depth interviews with senior human resources staff responsible for using selection testing. These formed part of a more <b>general</b> <b>enquiry</b> into patterns, and correlates, of test use, and drew on hypotheses which had been examined using national cross-sectional datasets. The interviews addressed directly the reasons for changes in test use, and so were deliberately focused on organisations (private and public) in which tests were already being used. As such, they obviously cannot provid...|$|R

40|$|The avowed aim of {{the thesis}} {{is to show that}} there are some {{synthetic}} necessary truths, or that synthetic apriori knowledge is possible. This is really a pretext for an investigation into the general connection between meaning and truth, or between understanding and knowing, which, as pointed out in the preface, is really the first stage in a more <b>general</b> <b>enquiry</b> concerning meaning. (Not all kinds of meaning are concerned with truth.) After the preliminaries (chapter one), in which the problem is stated and some methodological remarks made, the investigation proceeds in two stages. First there is a detailed inquiry into {{the manner in which the}} meanings or functions of words occurring in a statement help to determine the conditions in which that statement would be true (or false). This prepares the way for the second stage, which is an inquiry concerning the connection between meaning and necessary truth (between understanding and knowing apriori). The first stage occupies Part Two of the thesis, the second stage Part Three. In all this, only a restricted class of statements is discussed, namely those which contain nothing but logical words and descriptive words, such as "Not all round tables are scarlet" and "Every three-sided figure is three-angled".

5000|$|The {{earliest}} uses of {{the term}} degeneration {{can be found in}} the writings of Blumenbach and Buffon at the end of the 18th century, when these early writers on natural history considered scientific approaches to the human species. With the taxonomic mind-set of natural historians, they drew attention to the different ethnic groupings of mankind, and raised <b>general</b> <b>enquiries</b> about their relationships, with the idea that racial groupings could be explained by environmental effects on a common ancestral stock. This pre-Darwinian belief in the heritability of acquired characteristics does not accord with modern genetics. An alternative view of the multiple origins of different racial groups, called [...] "polygenic theories", was also rejected by Charles Darwin, who favored explanations in terms of differential geographic migrations from a single, probably African, population. The theory of degeneration found its first detailed presentation in the writings of Bénédict Morel (1809-1873), especially in his Traité des dégénérescences physiques, intellectuelles et morales de l'espèce humaine (Treatise on Degeneration of the Human Species) (1857). This book was published two years before Darwin's Origin of Species. Morel was a highly regarded psychiatrist, the very successful superintendent of the Rouen asylum for almost twenty years and a fastidious recorder of the family histories of his variously disabled patients. Through the details of these family histories, Morel discerned an hereditary line of defective parents infected by pollutants and stimulants; a second generation liable to epilepsy, neurasthenia, sexual deviations and hysteria; a third generation prone to insanity; and a final generation doomed to congenital idiocy and sterility. In 1857, Morel proposed a theory of hereditary degeneracy, bringing together environmental and hereditary elements in an uncompromisingly pre-Darwinian mix. Morel's contribution was further developed by Valentin Magnan (1835-1916), who stressed the role of alcohol—particularly absinthe—in the generation of psychiatric disorders.|$|E

40|$|In the Introduction I {{explore the}} reasons for my enquiry, and outline the inadequacies {{of some of the}} {{existing}} attempts to determine the aims and purposes of mathematics in education. In Part 1 I discuss the scope and validity of the justification of mathematics {{on the basis of its}} supposed usefulness. From there I defend the view that, in principle at least, there are different kinds of reasons for learning mathematics. In Parts 2 and 3 I attempt to explain whether or not mathematics is fit for two particular non-utility purposes claimed by various writers, and if so, how. Thus, in Part 2, I examine the rather strong claim that mathematics is afine art, and hence or otherwise that it is a source of aesthetic satisfaction. In Part 3, I explore the claim that mathematics provides mental training. Here I shall show that 'mental training', is a broad notion ranging from the rather moral character training to the more restricted notion of training in logic. Between these extremes lies a more modest notion which I argue is the most plausible. The thesis is thus both a history of ideas and a clarification of the concepts used in describing fairly established purposes and rejecting those that seem to me to be unattainable or at least scarcely attainable by studying mathematics. The reason for the study is twofold. I see it as a particular case of the <b>general</b> <b>enquiry</b> into the aims of education. So that my conclusions should inform those who want to justify the place of mathematics on the curriculum. Also, however, I want to suggest that the purposes of mathematics education are internally related to understanding the subject, so that the pupil will gain understanding from a clearer notion of what he or she is doing mathematics for...|$|R

40|$|The Yorkshire {{historian}} John Hargreaves {{has played}} {{a prominent role in}} the commemoration of the bicentenary of the Luddite unrest of 1812. In this article he focuses on a single image, very widely used to illustrate the events of that year, which purports to show Luddites engaged in smashing machines. He begins by reviewing the many publications and other sources, and television programmes, in which it has appeared and which use it as the archetypal illustration of the unrest. The article then challenges the provenance of the image, showing how it cannot possibly be contemporary because the machine shown is a Jacquard loom, and these were not used in Britain until the 1820 s at the earliest. Hargreaves then demonstrates that the image is a fabrication, because the background first appeared in the Penny Magazine in January 1844. The figures were clearly superimposed upon this image later in the nineteenth century. The final section of the article places this in the context of wider misunderstandings and falsehoods about Luddism and its circumstances, and argues that these have created much confusion and seriously impeded <b>general</b> historical <b>enquiry</b> as well as providing misleading evidence for Luddism itsel...|$|R
