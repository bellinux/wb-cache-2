40|$|Effects of the Objective and Perceived Built Environment on Bicycling for Transportation: This paper {{investigates the}} {{relative}} {{effects of the}} objectively-measured built environment versus stated perceptions of the built-environment on bicycling. Data are from a random phone survey conducted in the Portland, Oregon region. Binary logit and linear regression models, using objective measures, perceived measures, and both sets of measures, were estimated to predict odds of bicycling and frequency of bicycling separately. Results showed that the perceived <b>environment</b> and <b>objective</b> <b>environment</b> had independent effects on bicycling. This suggests that future bicycling research should include both perceived and objective measures of the built environment when possible. In addition, it indicates that interventions that focus on changing perceptions of the environment may {{be as important as}} actual changes in the built <b>environment.</b> The <b>objective</b> <b>environment</b> was necessary but not sufficient for bicycling. Intervention programs to improve people’s perceptions of the environment may be necessary to reap the full potential of planning and design policies. The results also suggest that it is useful to predict odds of bicycling and bicycling frequency separately, as the predictors of each behavior do vary. Finally, the analysis confirms the importance of attitudes in predicting behavior. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Background. The {{indications}} for urgent {{computed tomography}} {{of the brain}} (CTB) in the acute setting are controversial. While guidelines have been proposed for CTB in well-resourced countries, these are not always appropriate for resource-limited environments.

Adoption by resource-limited countries of more conservative scanning protocols, with outcomes comparable to well-resourced countries, would have significant benefit.
