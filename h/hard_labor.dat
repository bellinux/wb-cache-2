5|$|Section 14 was {{repealed}} by § 17 of the Crimes Act of 1825, which broadened the offense of counterfeiting and reduced authorized the punishment from death to 10 years <b>hard</b> <b>labor</b> and a $5000 fine. Sections 18 through 21 of the 1825 Act created additional counterfeiting offenses.|$|E
5|$|Early in Truman's second term, {{his former}} Secretary of Defense Forrestal died soon after retiring. Forrestal had become {{exhausted}} {{through years of}} <b>hard</b> <b>labor</b> {{during and after the}} war, and had begun to suffer depression. He retired in March 1949; soon after, he was hospitalized but committed suicide in May.|$|E
5|$|In 1965 Shostakovich {{raised his}} voice in defense of poet Joseph Brodsky, who was sentenced to five years of exile and <b>hard</b> <b>labor.</b> Shostakovich co-signed protests {{together}} with Yevtushenko and fellow Soviet artists Kornei Chukovsky, Anna Akhmatova, Samuil Marshak, and the French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. After the protests the sentence was commuted, and Brodsky returned to Leningrad.|$|E

60|$|Mountain-climbing is {{certainly}} dangerous, {{and it is}} about the <b>hardest</b> <b>labor</b> of which man is capable, but the proud satisfaction of standing upon a mountain-top repays the climber for all the labor, and makes him forget all the dangers that he has passed through.|$|R

Defended at trial by another one of her former attorneys general Paul Neumann, she claimed ignorance but was sentenced to five years of <b>hard</b> <b>labor</b> in prison {{by the military}} tribunal and fined $5,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the regiment's time, when not on expeditions, was spent in fatigue duty building fortifications around Suffolk. This included digging trenches and clearing trees {{in front of the}} defensive lines. The <b>hard</b> <b>labor</b> had a detrimental effect on the general morale of the Union troops stationed at Suffolk. This was exacerbated by antagonistic feelings between the civilians of occupied Suffolk and the enlisted men of the 6th Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|To {{prepare for}} the 1928 season, Berg went up to a lumber camp in New York's Adirondack Mountains three weeks before {{reporting}} to the White Sox spring training facility in Shreveport, Louisiana. The <b>hard</b> <b>labor</b> did wonders for him, as he reported to spring training on March 2, 1928 in excellent shape. By {{the end of the}} season, Berg had established himself as the starting catcher.|$|E
60|$|It is so {{with men}} as well as boys. Men {{sometimes}} are so situated that {{they have nothing to}} do but to try to amuse themselves. But these men are generally a very unhappy class. The poorest laborer, who toils all day at the <b>hardest</b> <b>labor,</b> is happier than they.|$|R

5|$|Imelda, {{coming from}} a family who practiced a simple lifestyle, had initial {{difficulties}} adjusting to her husband's extravagant lifestyle. She once complained that she was only earning a hundred and twenty pesos a month despite her <b>hard</b> <b>labor.</b> To this, Marcos laughed and {{said that it was}} her fault that she was working hard only for such an amount. This was a turning point for Imelda to no longer feel guilty about spending money. From then on, she pushed herself to extreme luxury.|$|E
5|$|In 121 BC, Han forces {{expelled}} the Xiongnu from a vast territory {{spanning the}} Hexi Corridor to Lop Nur. They repelled a joint Xiongnu-Qiang invasion of this northwestern territory in 111 BC. In that year, the Han court established four new frontier commanderies in this region: Jiuquan, Zhangyi, Dunhuang, and Wuwei. The {{majority of people}} on the frontier were soldiers. On occasion, the court forcibly moved peasant farmers to new frontier settlements, along with government-owned slaves and convicts who performed <b>hard</b> <b>labor.</b> The court also encouraged commoners, such as farmers, merchants, landowners, and hired laborers, to voluntarily migrate to the frontier.|$|E
5|$|In December 1954, 162 Puerto Ricans of the 65th Infantry were arrested, 95 were court martialed, and 91 {{were found}} guilty and sentenced to prison terms ranging from 1 to 18 years of <b>hard</b> <b>labor.</b> It was the largest mass court martial of the Korean War. The Secretary of the Army Robert T. Stevens moved quickly to remit the {{sentences}} and granted clemency and pardons to all those involved. Though {{the men who were}} court martialed were pardoned, there is currently a campaign for a formal exoneration.|$|E
50|$|Although {{she had a}} {{relatively}} privileged position, Zimetbaum devoted herself to helping other inmates. She interceded to have inmates sent to easier work when she suspected they were not fit for <b>harder</b> <b>labor.</b> She sneaked photographs that inmates' relatives had sent {{them out of the}} files and to the inmates as they were not allowed to have them in the camp. Zimetbaum also got food and medicine for people in need, cheered people up, and encouraged them. She was trusted by staff and prisoners alike.|$|R
60|$|All {{day long}} Joan, {{in the great}} court and subject to its rigid rules of procedure, was at a disadvantage; her judges had things their own way; but at night she held court herself, and matters were reversed, she presiding, with her tongue free and her same judges there before her. There could not be but one result: all the {{objections}} and hindrances they could build around her with their <b>hard</b> <b>labors</b> of the day she would charm away at night. In the end, she carried her judges with her in a mass, and got her great verdict without a dissenting voice.|$|R

5|$|On July 11, 1969, Kouandété accused Alley of {{plotting}} to kidnap and murder him. Facing the death penalty, Alley {{was sentenced to}} ten years of <b>hard</b> <b>labor</b> at an open trial held on October 4. Zinsou had intervened for Alley, and it strained relations {{between the president and}} Kouandété. The latter decided to lead another coup on December 10. In the aftermath, Alley was released from incarceration and reinstated in the army. In July 1968, he was named Secretary General of National Defence. Kouandété ended up becoming Alley's adjutant.|$|E
5|$|Various {{cases for}} rape, {{physical}} abuse and murder were prosecuted in court. Women, although usually having fewer rights by custom, {{were allowed to}} level civil and criminal charges against men. While suspects were jailed, convicted criminals were never imprisoned. Instead, punishments were commonly monetary fines, periods of forced <b>hard</b> <b>labor</b> for convicts, and the penalty of death by beheading. Early Han punishments of torturous mutilation were borrowed from Qin law. A series of reforms abolished mutilation punishments with progressively less-severe beatings by the bastinado.|$|E
5|$|Following Thomas Williams's {{sentence}} of one year's <b>hard</b> <b>labor</b> for publishing The Age of Reason in 1797, no editions were sold openly in Britain until 1818 when Richard Carlile included {{it in an}} edition of Paine's complete works. Carlile charged one shilling and sixpence for the work, and the first run of 1,000 copies sold out in a month. He immediately published a second edition of 3,000 copies. Like Williams, he was prosecuted for seditious libel and blasphemous libel. The prosecutions surrounding the printing of The Age of Reason in Britain continued for thirty years after its initial release and encompassed numerous publishers as well as over a hundred booksellers.|$|E

50|$|Since the {{previous}} siege the fortress had received many upgrades {{from the new}} school of trace italienne, which made it much more formidable in resisting artillery. In the most exposed land-facing sectors, these included a thickening of the main wall, doubling of {{the width of the}} dry ditch, coupled with a transformation of the old counterscarp into massive outworks (tenailles), the construction of bulwarks around most towers, and caponiers enfilading the ditch. Gates were reduced in number, and the old battlement parapets were replaced with slanting ones suitable for artillery fights. A team of masons, labourers and slaves did the construction work, the Muslim slaves were charged with the <b>hardest</b> <b>labor.</b>|$|R

5|$|From 28 December 1945 to 4 January 1946, seven Wehrmacht {{servicemen}} {{were tried}} by a Soviet military court in Leningrad. One of them, Arno Düre, who {{was charged with}} murdering numerous civilians using machine-guns in Soviet villages, confessed to having taken part in burial (though not the execution) of 15,000 to 20,000 Polish POWs in Katyn. For this he was spared execution and was given 15 years of <b>hard</b> <b>labor.</b> His confession was full of absurdities, and thus he was not used as a Soviet prosecution witness during the Nuremberg trials. He later recanted his confession, claiming that {{he was forced to}} confess by the investigators.|$|E
5|$|In 1885 Piłsudski started medical {{studies at}} Kharkov University (now Kharkiv, Ukraine), {{where he became}} {{involved}} with Narodnaya Volya, part of the Russian Narodniki revolutionary movement. In 1886, he was suspended for participating in student demonstrations. He {{was rejected by the}} University of Dorpat (now Tartu, Estonia), whose authorities had been informed of his political affiliation. On 22 March 1887, he was arrested by Tsarist authorities on a charge of plotting with Vilnius socialists to assassinate Tsar Alexander III. In fact, Piłsudski's main connection to the plot was his elder brother Bronisław's involvement in it. Bronisław Piłsudski was sentenced to fifteen years' <b>hard</b> <b>labor</b> (katorga) in eastern Siberia.|$|E
5|$|Michigan, led by {{the young}} and hot-headed Mason, responded {{with the passage of}} the Pains and Penalties Act just six days after Lucas County was formed; the act made it a {{criminal}} offense for Ohioans to carry out governmental actions in the Strip, under penalty of a fine up to $1,000, up to five years imprisonment at <b>hard</b> <b>labor,</b> or both. Acting as commander-in-chief of the territory, Mason appointed Brigadier-General Joseph W. Brown of the Third U.S. Brigade to head the state militia, with the instructions to be ready to act against Ohio trespassers. Lucas obtained legislative approval for a militia of his own, and he soon sent forces to the Strip area. The Toledo War had begun.|$|E
6000|$|The war-cloud hovered {{dark and}} ominous. The stage {{was set for}} a world-catastrophe, for {{in all the world}} were <b>hard</b> times, <b>labor</b> troubles, {{perishing}} middle classes, armies of unemployed, clashes of economic interests in the world-market, and mutterings and rumblings of the socialist revolution.* ...|$|R
5000|$|The work {{environment}} {{described in the}} book is in many ways opposite of traditional management. Instead of top-down management, many of the innovations are started at the grassroots level. Instead of management having to coerce <b>labor</b> to work <b>harder,</b> <b>labor</b> volunteers to complete the project on-time. The {{reason for this is that}} people will give their best when the work itself is challenging and rewarding. Many of the engineers state that, [...] "They don't work for the money", meaning they work for the challenge of inventing and creating. The motivational system is akin to the game of pinball, the analogy being that if you win this round, you get to play the game again; that is, build the next generation of computers.|$|R
50|$|Described as {{a source}} of {{optimism}} and hope for the group, often singing to help boost morale, Beth is soft-spoken and a devout Christian teenager. After the loss of her mother, Beth attempts suicide but ultimately chooses to live. During the initial outbreak and beyond, Beth is a sheltered girl, but is eventually forced into <b>hard</b> <b>laboring</b> survival after the downfall of the prison (a place that had been a safe haven). She forms a close bond with fellow survivor and group member Daryl Dixon. Her final arc revolves around being held captive under the service of Officer Dawn Lerner in Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, and the subsequent efforts of Rick's group to find and rescue her become the primary driving force behind {{the first half of the}} fifth season.|$|R
5|$|Oswaldo Payá {{was born}} on 29 February 1952 in Cerro, Havana. The fifth of seven children, he was brought up as a Roman Catholic and {{attended}} a Marist Brothers school in Havana. Payá was the only student at the school who refused to join the Communist League following the Cuban Revolution. The school was later closed. In 1969, {{he was sentenced to}} three years of <b>hard</b> <b>labor</b> on Isla de Pinos when he refused to transport political prisoners during his mandatory military service. While there, he discovered a locked Catholic church, Nuestra Señora de Dolores, that received permission from the Bishop of Havana to reopen as a mission, giving religious talks and caring for the sick.|$|E
5|$|Sentenced to 25 {{years of}} <b>hard</b> <b>labor,</b> Hartmann refused to work. He was {{eventually}} put into solitary confinement, which enraged his fellow prisoners. They began a revolt, overpowered the guards, and freed him. Hartmann made a complaint to the Kommandants office, {{asking for a}} representative from Moscow and an international inspection, {{as well as a}} tribunal, to acquit him of his unlawful conviction. This was refused, and he was transferred to a camp in Novocherkassk, where he spent five more months in solitary confinement. Eventually, Hartmann was granted a tribunal, but it upheld his original sentence. He was subsequently sent to another camp, this time at Diaterka in the Ural Mountains.|$|E
5|$|The {{bishops of}} Olinda and Belém (in {{the provinces of}} Pernambuco and Pará, respectively) {{were two of the}} new {{generation}} of educated, zealous Brazilian clerics. They had been influenced by the Ultramontanism which spread among Catholics in this period. In 1872 they ordered Freemasons expelled from lay brotherhoods. While European Masonry often tended towards atheism and anti-clericalism, things were much different in Brazil where membership in Masonic orders was common—although PedroII himself was not a Freemason. The government headed by the Viscount of Rio Branco tried on two separate occasions to persuade the bishops to repeal, but they refused. This led to their trial and conviction by the Superior Court of Justice. In 1874 they were sentenced four years at <b>hard</b> <b>labor,</b> although the Emperor commuted this to imprisonment only.|$|E
40|$|Elastofibroma dorsi (EFD) is a rare, benign, {{soft tissue}} tumor with an unclear pathogenesis, {{typically}} localized to the subscapular region. It occurs within the periscapular {{area between the}} ribs and dorsal chest wall muscles. Repetitive microtrauma by friction between {{the lower part of}} the scapula and the thoracic wall may cause reactive hyperproliferation of the fibroblastic tissue. This view has been supported by the higher prevalence of EFD, particularly among individuals who perform <b>hard</b> manual <b>labor.</b> EFD can, however, also be observed in those who have never performed <b>hard</b> manual <b>labor</b> and particularly in women over the age of 50.
