2500|$|Jeta Amata, {{who grew}} up in the Niger Delta stated in an {{interview}} that it has been a while since he has wanted to make a film on the Niger Delta. He had written three scripts on it for about eight years; but as the issues kept escalating, it seemed more difficult to make [...] "but I got to the point where I knew it just has to be now". [...] Black November is fiction based on an actual event, the title being derived from the month in which activist Ken Saro-Wiwa was executed in 1995. Amata had once met Saro-Wiwa through his father and was affected by his death. The recent Niger Delta militancy further triggered Amata's interest to make the film; Jeta Amata had to meet with most of the Niger Delta ex-militants such as Asari Dokubo and Boyloaf to listen to their sides of the story. He stated in an interview: [...] "What I'm doing is what they did, but without weapons." [...] Amata explained that even though the film touched some political points, he is more concerned about the human parts of the story, about the feelings of the people and what they passed through: [...] "We are not trying to fight the government, trying to fight the oil companies, no -- we are trying to repair what has been damaged". [...] The film was majorly funded by a Nigerian business magnate, Captain Hosa Wells Okunbo, who says he does not want to go down in history as [...] "just another rich merchant", <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> something back to the region that made him wealthy.|$|E

Still I own [...] It goes against me not to finish it [...] For the friends it might bring me. By the way, [...] I had a letter from Burroughs--did I tell you?-- [...] About my Cyprepedium reginæ; [...] He says it's not reported so far north. [...] There! there's the bell. He's rung. But you go down [...] And bring him up, and don't let Mrs. Corbin.-- [...] Oh, well, we'll soon be through with it. I'm tired." [...] Willis brought up besides the Boston lawyer [...] A little barefoot girl who in the noise [...] Of heavy footsteps in the old frame house, [...] And baritone importance of the lawyer, [...] Stood for a while unnoticed with her hands [...] Shyly behind her. [...] "Well, and how is Mister----" [...] The lawyer was already in his satchel [...] As if for papers that might bear the name [...] He hadn't at command. [...] "You must excuse me, [...] I dropped in at the mill and was detained." [...] "Looking round, I suppose," [...] said Willis. [...] "Yes, [...] Well, yes." [...] "Hear anything that might prove useful?" [...] The Broken One saw Anne. [...] "Why, here is Anne. [...] What do you want, dear? Come, stand by the bed; [...] Tell me what is it?" [...] Anne just wagged her dress [...] With both hands held behind her. [...] "Guess," [...] she said. [...] "Oh, guess which hand? My my! Once on a time [...] I knew a lovely way to tell for certain [...] By looking in the ears. But I forget it. [...] Er, let me see. I think I'll take the right. [...] That's sure to be right even if it's wrong. [...] Come, hold it out. Don't change.--A Ram's Horn orchid! [...] A Ram's Horn! What would I have got, I wonder, [...] If I had chosen left. Hold out the left. [...] Another Ram's Horn! Where did you find those, [...] Under what beech tree, on what woodchuck's knoll?" [...] Anne looked at the large lawyer at her side, [...] And thought she wouldn't venture on so much. [...] "Were there no others?" [...] "There were four or five. [...] I knew you wouldn't let me pick them all." [...] "I wouldn't--so I wouldn't. You're the girl! [...] You see Anne has her lesson learned by heart." [...] "I wanted there should be some there next year." [...] "Of course you did. You left the rest for seed, [...] And for the backwoods woodchuck. You're the girl! [...] A Ram's Horn orchid seedpod for a woodchuck [...] Sounds something like. Better than farmer's beans [...] To a discriminating appetite, [...] Though the Ram's Horn is seldom to be had [...] In bushel lots--doesn't come on the market. [...] But, Anne, I'm troubled; have you told me all? [...] You're hiding something. That's as bad as lying. [...] You ask this lawyer man. And it's not safe [...] With a lawyer at hand to find you out. [...] Nothing is hidden from some people, Anne. [...] You don't tell me that where you found a Ram's Horn [...] You didn't find a Yellow Lady's Slipper. [...] What did I tell you? What? I'd blush, I would. [...] Don't you defend yourself. If it was there, [...] Where is it now, the Yellow Lady's Slipper?" [...] "Well, wait--it's common--it's too common." [...] "Common? [...] The Purple Lady's Slipper's commoner." [...] "I didn't bring a Purple Lady's Slipper [...] To You--to you I mean--they're both too common." [...] The lawyer gave a laugh among his papers [...] As if with some idea that she had scored. [...] "I've broken Anne of gathering bouquets. [...] It's not fair to the child. It can't be helped though: [...] Pressed into service means pressed out of shape. [...] Somehow I'll make it right with her--she'll see. [...] She's going to do my scouting in the field, [...] Over stone walls and all along a wood [...] And by a river bank for water flowers, [...] The floating Heart, with small leaf like a heart, [...] And at the sinus under water a fist [...] Of little fingers all kept down but one, [...] And that thrust up to blossom in the sun [...] As if to say, 'You! You're the Heart's desire.' [...] Anne has a way with flowers to take the place [...] Of that she's lost: she goes down on one knee [...] And lifts their faces by the chin to hers [...] And says their names, and leaves them where they are." [...] The lawyer wore a watch the case of which [...] Was cunningly devised to make a noise [...] Like a small pistol when he snapped it shut [...] At such a time as this. He snapped it now. [...] "Well, Anne, go, dearie. Our affair will wait. [...] The lawyer man is thinking of his train. [...] <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> me lots and lots of money [...] Before he goes, because I hurt myself, [...] And it may take him I don't know how long. [...] But put our flowers in water first. Will, help her: [...] The pitcher's too full for her. There's no cup? [...] Just hook them {{on the inside of the}} pitcher. [...] Now run.--Get out your documents! You see [...] I have to keep on the good side of Anne. [...] I'm a great boy to think of number one. [...] And you can't blame me in the place I'm in. [...] Who will take care of my necessities [...] Unless I do?" [...] "A pretty interlude," [...] The lawyer said. [...] "I'm sorry, but my train-- [...] Luckily terms are all agreed upon. [...] You only have to sign your name. Right--there." [...] "You, Will, stop making faces. Come round here [...] Where you can't make them. What is it you want? [...] I'll put you out with Anne. Be good or go." [...] "You don't mean you will sign that thing unread?" [...] "Make yourself useful then, and read it for me. [...] Isn't it something I have seen before?" [...] "You'll find it is. Let your friend look at it." [...] "Yes, but all that takes time, and I'm as much [...] In haste to get it over with as you. [...] But read it, read it. That's right, draw the curtain: [...] Half the time I don't know what's troubling me.-- [...] What do you say, Will? Don't you be a fool, [...] You! crumpling folkses legal documents. [...] Out with it if you've any real objection." [...] "Five hundred dollars!" [...] "What would you think right?" [...] "A thousand wouldn't be a cent too much; [...] You know it, Mr. Lawyer. The sin is [...] Accepting anything before he knows [...] Whether he's ever going to walk again. [...] It smells to me like a dishonest trick." [...] "I think--I think--from what I heard to-day-- [...] And saw myself--he would be ill-advised----" [...] "What did you hear, for instance?" [...] Willis said. [...] "Now the place where the accident occurred----" [...] The Broken One was twisted in his bed. [...] "This is between you two apparently. [...] Where I come in is what I want to know. [...] You stand up to it like a pair of cocks. [...] Go outdoors if you want to fight. Spare me. [...] When you come back, I'll have the papers signed. [...] Will pencil do? Then, please, your fountain pen. [...] One of you hold my head up from the pillow." [...] Willis flung off the bed. [...] "I wash my hands-- [...] I'm no match--no, and don't pretend to be----" [...] The lawyer gravely capped his fountain pen. [...] "You're doing the wise thing: you won't regret it. [...] We're very sorry for you." [...] Willis sneered: [...] "Who's we?--some stockholders in Boston? [...] I'll go outdoors, by gad, and won't come back." [...] "Willis, bring Anne back with you when you come. [...] Yes. Thanks for caring. Don't mind Will: he's savage. [...] He thinks you ought to pay me for my flowers. [...] You don't know what I mean about the flowers. [...] Don't stop to try to now. You'll miss your train. [...] Good-bye." [...] He flung his arms around his face.|$|E
