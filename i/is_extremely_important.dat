As suspended particles (turbidity) can provide a growth substrate for microorganisms and can protect them from disinfection treatment, it <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> <b>important</b> that the water treatment process achieves a good level of removal of suspended particles.|$|E
5|$|This {{relationship}} between magnetic fields and currents <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> <b>important,</b> for {{it led to}} Michael Faraday's invention of the electric motor in 1821. Faraday's homopolar motor consisted of a permanent magnet sitting {{in a pool of}} mercury. A current was allowed through a wire suspended from a pivot above the magnet and dipped into the mercury. The magnet exerted a tangential force on the wire, making it circle around the magnet {{for as long as the}} current was maintained.|$|E

25|$|The {{investigation}} of the neural correlates of reciprocal imitation <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> <b>important</b> because it provides an ecological paradigm (a situation close to everyday life) {{to address the issue}} of the sense of agency.

25|$|The schwa {{deletion}} or schwa syncope phenomenon plays {{a crucial}} role in Konkani and several other Indo-Aryan languages, where schwas implicit in the written scripts of those languages are obligatorily deleted for correct pronunciation. Schwa syncope <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> <b>important</b> in these languages for intelligibility and unaccented speech. It also presents a challenge to non-native speakers and speech synthesis software because the scripts, including Nagar Barap, do not provide indicators of where schwas should be dropped.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{males with}} {{previous}} sexual experience will modify their courtship dance {{when attempting to}} mate with new females — the experienced males spend less time courting and therefore have lower mating latencies, meaning {{that they are able}} to reproduce more quickly. This decreased mating latency leads to a greater mating efficiency for experienced males over naïve males. This modification also appears to have obvious evolutionary advantages, as increased mating efficiency <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> <b>important</b> in the eyes of natural selection.|$|E
25|$|Testosterone, {{along with}} its {{metabolite}} dihydrotestosterone, <b>is</b> <b>extremely</b> <b>important</b> to normal sexual functioning in men and women.

Although this decline is gradual for most women, those who’ve undergone bilateral oophorectomy experience a sudden drop in testosterone levels; this is because the ovaries produce 40% of the body's circulating testosterone.|$|E
