40|$|<b>Decoquinate</b> {{nanoparticle}} and microparticle {{suspended in}} an oily vehicle to retard drug release are evaluated for long-term malaria prophylaxis. Pharmacokinetic studies in normal animals and antimalarial efficacy in liver stage malaria mice were conducted at various single intramuscular-decoquinate doses for 2, 4, 6, or 8 {{weeks prior to}} infection with P. berghei sporozoites. The liver stage efficacy evaluation was monitored by using an in vivo imaging system. Full causal prophylaxis was shown in mice with a single intramuscular dose at 120 [*]mg/kg of nanoparticle <b>decoquinate</b> (0. 43 [*]μm) for 2 - 3 weeks and with microparticle <b>decoquinate</b> (8. 31 [*]μm) injected 8 weeks earlier than inoculation. The time above MIC of 1, 375 [*]hr observed with the microparticle formulation provided a 2. 2 -fold longer drug exposure than with the nanoparticle formulation (624 [*]hr).

40|$|Plasmodium parasites {{undergo a}} {{clinically}} silent and obligatory developmental {{phase in the}} host’s liver cells before {{they are able to}} infect erythrocytes and cause malaria symptoms. To overcome the scarcity of compounds targeting the liver stage of malaria, we screened a library of 1037 existing drugs for their ability to inhibit Plasmodium hepatic development. <b>Decoquinate</b> emerged as the strongest inhibitor of Plasmodium liver stages, both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, <b>decoquinate</b> kills the parasite’s replicative blood stages and is active against developing gametocytes, the forms responsible for transmission. The drug acts by selectively and specifically inhibiting the parasite’s mitochondrial bc 1 complex, with little cross-resistance with the antimalarial drug atovaquone. Oral administration of a single dose of <b>decoquinate</b> effectively prevents the appearance of disease, warranting its exploitation as a potent antimalarial compound. The search for active compounds among drugs origi-nally developed and clinically tested for the treatment of other diseases is a particularly advantageous ap-proach in the case of historically neglected diseases such as malaria.

40|$|Coccidiosis is {{a serious}} {{obstacle}} to sheep production, which is becoming a limiting factor, {{especially with regard to}} lamb production. However, there are few studies on this parasite in the State of Rio Grande do Norte. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the action of <b>decoquinate,</b> added to mineral salt, for controlling Eimeria infection in lambs, and to identify which species are infecting sheep in the eastern region of the state. This study was carried out from August 2009 to January 2010, and used 76 animals. These were divided into two treatment groups: one with common mineral salt, and the other with mineral salt enriched with 6 % micronized <b>decoquinate.</b> Fecal samples and body weight measurements were taken every 14 days for parasitological diagnosis, weight gain follow-up and quantitative analysis. The study showed that there was a significant difference in OPG only at the 7 th collection, but no significant difference in weight gain. The Eimeria species found were E. ahsata. E. crandallis. E. granulosa. E. intrincata. E. ovina. E. faurei. E. ovinoidalis. E. pallida and E. parva. It was concluded that addition of <b>decoquinate</b> to mineral salt gave rise to lower oocyst elimination, thus favoring eimeriosis control in sheep...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effect was}} studied of {{introducing}} about {{equal numbers of}} decoquinate-sensitive or decoquinate-resistant Eimeria tenella oocysts into a floor pen of susceptible unmedicated chickens. "Sentinel " birds introduced 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 weeks later were used to recover popula-tions of E. tenella oocysts. In drug sensitivity tests, populations of oocysts harvested at 4 weeks were partially resistant to <b>decoquinate</b> medication. Oocysts obtained after 5 and 6 weeks were highly sensitive to decoquin-ate medication.

40|$|Anticoccidial {{drugs were}} {{evaluated}} for activity {{and for the}} development of resistance in a model of Toxoplasma gondii growing in human fibroblast cultures. Of 13 anticoccidial drugs tested, 9 had selective antitoxoplasma activity (50 % inhibitory concentration, in micrograms per milliliter) : <b>decoquinate</b> (0. 005), arprinocid-N-oxide (0. 015), robenidine (0. 03), the aryl triazine CP- 25, 415 (0. 2), toltrazuril (0. 4), clopidol (1), dinitolmide (Zoalene; Dow) (10), and the carboxylic acid ionophores monensin (0. 001) and salinomycin (0. 04). Glycarbylamide, amprolium, nicarbazin, and the 6 -(p-bromophenoxy) - 7 -chloro analog of halofuginone (Stenorol; Roussel-UCLAF) (CP- 63, 567) were toxic for the fibroblasts. Since Eimeria tenella has a similar drug susceptibility profile, anticoccidial durgs {{can be viewed as a}} potential source of new antitoxoplasma therapies. The development of resistance has limited the usefulness of most of these drugs as anticoccidial agents; in coccidia, resistance to all except the ionophores occurs readily in vivo. We explored the development of resistance in T. gondii by attempting to select mutants in vitro from parasites mutagenized with ethylnitrosourea. Mutants that had 20 - to 50 -fold-reduced susceptibility to <b>decoquinate,</b> arprinocid-N-oxide, and CP- 25, 415 were obtained. Ionophore-resistant T. gondii mutants were also selected in vitro; however, there was only a twofold difference in susceptibility between these mutants and the wild type. For three drugs (clopidol, robenidine, and toltrazuril), we were unable to select resistant mutants. For experimental anticoccidial drugs, there is currently no in vitro method for assessing the risk of development of resistance in Eimeria species. Our results suggest that T. gondii may offer a useful surrogate for this assessment...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Monensin, admixed {{with the}} feed {{at a level}} of 0. 0125 %, {{adequately}} protected chickens against experimental infections of Eimeria tenella initiated by a strain that had no previous exposure to drugs as well as by strains resistant to amprolium, arsenosobenzene, buquinoiate, clopidol, <b>decoquinate,</b> glycarbylamide, nequinate, nicarbazin, nitrofurazone, Nova-stat, Trithiadol, Unistat, or zoalene, respectively.

40|$|Coccidia were {{identified}} in intestinal sections from 82 piglets comprising 37 consignments from 34 farms, and represented a yearly increasing incidence {{in the three years}} 1978 to 1980. Piglets were primarily from medium to large farms with intensive, continuous-farrowing, confinement-rearing programs. Piglets, usually five days to 15 days old, had yellow, fluid diarrhea, became unthrifty and sometimes died. In six piglets from two farms, a green, adherent, fibrinonecrotic membrane was seen throughout most of the jejunum and ileum. Significant gross lesions were not observed in the other 76 piglets. Moderate to severe villous atrophy of jejunum and ileum was seen histologically. Various asexual and sexual stages of coccidia were seen within parasitophorous vacuoles of villar epithelial cells. Multifocal erosions with necrosis of villar tips and occasionally more diffuse mucosal necrosis with fibrinocellular exudate were seen. Isospora suis oocysts {{were identified}} in feces from several weaners from one farm.

40|$|International audienceA multi-residue HPLC-ESI-MS/MS {{method has}} been {{developed}} for the simultaneous extraction, detection, and confirmation of the 11 coccidiostats concerned by Regulation 2009 / 8 /EC (lasalocid sodium, narasin, salinomycin sodium, monensin sodium, semduramicin sodium, maduramicin ammonium alpha, robenidine hydrochloride, <b>decoquinate,</b> halofuginone hydrobromide, nicarbazin, and diclazuril) in feedingstuffs at carry-over level. The sensitivity of the method allows quantification and confirmation for all coccidiostats below target concentration. The method was in-house validated and meets all criteria of European legislation (2002 / 657 /EC). The precision of the method was determined under repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility conditions; RSDr and RSDR were below the maximum permitted values for every tested concentration. The specificity was checked by analysing representative blank samples and blank samples fortified with potentially interfering substances (benzimidazoles, corticosteroides, triphenylmethane dyes, quinolones, nitrofurans, nitroimidazoles, phenicols) and no interference were found. Concerning quantification, a quadratic regression model was fitted to every calibration curve with a regression coefficient R 2 above 0. 99 on each data set.

40|$|<b>Decoquinate</b> (DQ) {{is highly}} {{effective}} at killing malaria parasites in vitro; however, {{it is extremely}} insoluble in water. In this study, solid dispersion method was used for DQ formulation which created a suitable physical form of DQ in aqueous phase for particle manipulation. Among many polymers and surfactants tested, polyvinylpyrrolidone 10, a polymer, and L-α-phosphatidylcholine or polysorbate, two surfactants, were chosen as DQ formulation components. The formulation particles were reduced to a mean size between 200 to 400 [*]nm, which was stable in aqueous medium {{for at least three}} weeks. Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies showed that compared to DQ microparticle suspension, a nanoparticle formulation orally dosed to mice showed a 14. 47 -fold increase in area under the curve (AUC) of DQ plasma concentration and a 4. 53 -fold increase in AUC of DQ liver distribution. WR 299666, a poorly water-soluble compound with antimalarial activity, was also tested and successfully made into nanoparticle formulation without undergoing solid dispersion procedure. We concluded that nanoparticles generated by using appropriate formulation components and sufficient particle size reduction significantly increased the bioavailability of DQ and could potentially turn this antimalarial agent to a therapeutic drug...|$|E
40|$|The large {{utilization}} of coccidiostats in dairy herds {{has raised the}} question regards the best product to use, based on better animal performance. Sixty-four Holstein calves {{were randomly assigned to}} four treatments at 10 (± 4) d of age to evaluate calf performance when fed approved coccidiostats available on the market in Arizona, USA. Calves received a dry calf starter without (control) or with one of the following coccidiostats: lasalocid, 30 mg kg- 1; <b>decoquinate,</b> 19 mg kg- 1; and monensin, 30 mg kg- 1. Calves received 3. 6 kg d- 1 of a commercial 22 % CP: 20 % fat milk replacer until 6 wk of age. Calves were offered starter "ad libitum" up to 2 kg d- 1, and calves had free access to water throughout the trial. Alfalfa hay was offered "ad libitum" after weaning. Performance and dry matter intake (DMI) were monitored for 20 weeks and broken down in different periods of measurement (0 - 6, 7 - 12 and 13 - 20 weeks, respectively). Despite the lower dry matter intake and weight gain for females on monensin treatment during the whole period, differences among coccidiostats were seldom observed under the conditions of this study. Good calf management and the dry, hot climate of Arizona perhaps diminished the chances for subclinical and chronic disease appearance which negated potential differences and differences in calf performances...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of a}} {{programme}} {{aimed at}} identifying rational new triple drug combinations for treatment of malaria, tuberculosis and toxoplasmosis, we have selected quinolones as one component, given that selected examples exhibit exceptionally good activities against the causative pathogens of the foregoing diseases. The quinolone <b>decoquinate</b> (DQ), an old and inexpensive coccidiostat, displays anti-malarial activity in vitro against Plasmodium falciparum (Pf). However, because of its exceedingly poor solubility in water or organic solvents, development of DQ as a drug is problematical. We have therefore converted DQ in straightforward fashion into tractable new derivatives that display good activities in vitro against chloroquine-sensitive NF 54 and multidrug-resistant K 1 and W 2 Pf, and relatively low toxicities against human fibroblast cells. The most active compound, the N-acetyl derivative 30, is 5 -fold more active than DQ against NF 54 and K 1 and equipotent with DQ against W 2. It possesses an activity profile against all strains comparable {{with that of the}} artemisinin derivative artesunate. Overall, this compound and the other accessible and active derivatives serve as an attractive template for development of new and economic lead quinolones.

40|$|Coccidiosis, an {{intestinal}} plasmodium infection, {{is a major}} {{infectious disease}} in poultry and rabbits. Eleven different coccidiostats are licensed in the EU {{for the prevention of}} coccidiosis in these animal species. According to their chemical nature and main biological activity, these compounds can be grouped as ionophoric (monensin, lasalocid sodium, salinomycin, narasin, maduramicin and semduramicin) or non-ionophoric (robenidine, <b>decoquinate,</b> nicarbazin, diclazuril, and halofuginone) substances. Coccidiostats are used as feed additives, mixed upon request into the compounded feed. During the technical process of commercial feed production, cross-contamination of feed batches can result in the exposure of non-target animals and induce adverse health effects in these animals due to a specific sensitivity of mammalian species as compared to poultry. Residue formation in edible tissues of non-target species may result in unexpected human exposure through the consumption of animal products. This review presents recent risk assessments performed by the Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). The health risk to non-target species that would result from the consumption of cross-contaminated feed with coccidostats at levels of 2, 5 or 10 % was found to be negligible for most animal species with the exception of salinomycin and monensin in horses because of the particular sensitivity for which toxicity may occur when cross-contamination exceeds 2 % and 5 % respectively. Kinetic data and tissue analyses showed that residues of coccidiostats may occur in the liver and eggs in some cases. However, the level of residues of each coccidiostat in edible animal tissues remained sufficiently low that the aggregate exposure of consumers would not exceed the established acceptable daily intake (ADI) of each coccidiostat. It could be concluded that technical cross-contamination of animal feeds would not be expected to adversely affect the health of consumers...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} dietary anticoccidial drugs plus antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs) on parameters of immunity in commercial broiler chickens. Day-old chicks were raised on used litter from a farm with endemic gangrenous dermatitis to simulate natural pathogen exposure and provided with diets containing <b>decoquinate</b> (DECX) or monensin (COBN) as anticoccidials plus bacitracin methylene disalicylate and roxarsone as AGPs. As a negative control, the chickens were fed with a non-supplemented diet. Immune parameters examined were concanavalin A (ConA) -stimulated spleen cell proliferation, intestine intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) and spleen cell subpopulations, and cytokine/chemokine mRNA levels in IELs and spleen cells. ConA-induced proliferation was decreased at 14 d post-hatch in DECX-treated chickens, and increased at 25 and 43 d in COBN-treated animals, compared with untreated controls. In DECX-treated birds, increased percentages of MHC 2 + and CD 4 + IELS were detected at 14 d, but decreased percentages of these cells were seen at 43 d, compared with untreated controls, while increased TCR 2 + IELs were evident at the latter time. Dietary COBN was associated with decreased fractions of MHC 2 + and CD 4 + IELs and reduced percentages of MHC 2 +, BU 1 +, and TCR 1 + spleen cells compared with controls. The levels of transcripts for interleukin- 4 (IL- 4), IL- 6, IL- 17 F, IL- 13, CXCLi 2, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and transforming growth factorβ 4 were elevated in IELs, and those for IL- 13, IL- 17 D, CXCLi 2, and IFN-γ were increased in spleen cells, of DECX- and/or COBN-treated chickens compared with untreated controls. By contrast, IL- 2 and IL- 12 mRNAs in IELs, and IL- 4, IL- 12, and IL- 17 F transcripts in spleen cells, were decreased in DECX- and/or COBN-treated chickens compared with controls. These results suggest that DECX or COBN, in combination with bacitracin and roxarsone, modulate {{the development of the}} chicken post-hatch immune system...|$|E
40|$|A {{fermentation}} extract of {{the fungus}} Aspergillus oryzae can be utilized {{as a direct}} fed microbial (DFM). The objective {{was to determine if}} dietary inclusion of an extract of A. oryzae would improve the growth of Holstein bull calves from birth through 1 wk post weaning; it was hypothesized that it would. Calves were randomly assigned to a slaughter age, 4 wk (n = 16) or 8 wk (n = 36) and treatment, control (CON; n = 27) or DFM (n = 25). Calves averaged 43. 2 ± 1. 0 kg of body weight (BW) and 2. 8 ± 0. 3 days of age {{at the beginning of the}} experiment. Calves were housed and fed individually; no bedding was used. Calves assigned to DFM were fed 2 g/d of DFM. Liquid DFM was delivered in milk replacer for the first 4 wk of the trial; solid DFM was top-dressed on texturized grain thereafter. Calves were fed non-medicated milk replacer twice daily (22. 0 % CP, 20. 0 % fat DM basis; 680 g/d) and were weaned upon consumption of 0. 91 kg of grain (20 % CP, 2. 0 % fat; medicated with <b>decoquinate)</b> for 3 consecutive days or on d 45 of the study, whichever came first. Calves had ad libitum access to grain and water throughout the trial. Feed intake was recorded daily, and BW was recorded weekly. Total dry matter intake per calf did not differ from 0 thru 4 wk (20. 3 ± 0. 6 kg of DM) or 5 thru 8 wk (58. 0 ± 2. 08 kg of DM). The gain to feed ratio did not differ by treatment: from 0 thru 4 wk (0. 55 ± 0. 03) or 5 thru 8 wk (0. 52 ± 0. 03). There was no effect of treatment on BW, wither height, or hip height [...] Thus, dietary inclusion (2 g/d) of an extract of A. oryzae did not result in improved calf growth when supplemented animals were compared to cohorts not fed the DFM. It is possible that the dose used here was not high enough to elicit treatment effects. Given that effects have been noted in other species, a follow-up dose titration study with similar diets as used here seems warranted...|$|E
