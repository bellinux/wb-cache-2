5|$|After the 1962 World's Fair and {{introduction}} of the Seattle Center Monorail, a proposal was drawn up by fair organizers to extend the system to the airport. The plan, supported by Governor Albert D. Rosellini, was ultimately rejected by incoming Governor Daniel J. Evans in favor of completing Interstate 5. The Forward Thrust rapid transit plan, which was rejected by voters in 1968 and 1970, included Sea-Tac Airport in <b>its</b> <b>long-term</b> plans for service; the airport was excluded from the first phase because of possible changes brought by airport expansion and the Supersonic Transport program.|$|E
5|$|As {{problems}} with the EMD SDP40F mounted, Amtrak adopted the F40PH as <b>its</b> <b>long-term</b> solution nationwide for diesel service. In the spring of 1977 Amtrak traded 40 SDP40Fs back to EMD; components including the prime mover were installed into an F40PH's frame. The 40 rebuilt locomotives were designated F40PHR and were identical to new-build F40PHs, incorporating the larger fuel tank and more powerful HEP generator which had become standard. Amtrak ultimately acquired 132 F40PHRs in this manner, which combined with new orders between 1975–1988, and the purchase of six GMD F40PHs from GO Transit in 1990, led to a fleet of 216 locomotives, the country's largest fleet.|$|E
5|$|The Nassak Diamond {{originated}} in the 15th century in India. Although {{the date of the}} original cutting is unknown, the original cutting was performed in India and had sacrificed everything to size while giving the diamond a form and appearance {{similar to that of the}} Koh-i-Noor diamond. From at least 1500 to 1817, the Nassak Diamond adorned the Shivalinga in the Trimbakeshwar Shiva Temple, near Nashik (Nassak), India on the upper Godavari River. As priests worshiped Shiva, the diamond eventually acquired its name from <b>its</b> <b>long-term</b> proximity to Nashik.|$|E

5|$|Harmless and docile, the thornback {{guitarfish}} can {{be readily}} approached underwater, and fares well in public aquariums. Off the United States, this ray is common and faces no substantial threats: it is only occasionally caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fishers, and has no economic value. As most of its range lies within US waters, the species has been assessed as Least Concern overall by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, in Mexican waters the thornback guitarfish population is small and fragmented, {{and the degree to}} which it is affected by fishing is uncertain. There, the IUCN has listed it locally under Data Deficient while noting its susceptibility to inshore lagoon fisheries and shrimp trawlers, and the urgent need for additional information to ensure <b>its</b> <b>long-term</b> regional survival.|$|E
5|$|Sport England {{wished to}} avoid {{creating}} a white elephant, so they {{insisted that the}} City Council agree to undertake and fund extensive work to convert CoMS from a track and field arena to a football stadium, thereby ensuring <b>its</b> <b>long-term</b> financial viability. Sport England hoped either Manchester City Council or Manchester City F.C. would provide the extra £50 million required to convert the stadium to a 65,000 seater athletics and footballing venue with movable seating. However, Manchester City Council {{did not have the}} money to facilitate movable seating and Manchester City were lukewarm about the idea. Stadium architects Arup Sport believed history demonstrated that maintaining a rarely used athletics track often does not work with football – and cited examples such as the Stadio delle Alpi and the Olympic Stadium with both Juventus and Bayern Munich moving to new stadiums less than 40 years after inheriting them.|$|E
5|$|The X-Files {{was a hit}} for the Fox {{network and}} {{received}} largely positive reviews, although <b>its</b> <b>long-term</b> story arc was criticized near the conclusion. Initially considered a cult series, {{it turned into a}} pop culture touchstone that tapped into public mistrust of governments and large institutions and embraced conspiracy theories and spirituality. Both the series itself and lead actors Duchovny and Anderson received multiple awards and nominations, and by the end it was the longest-running science fiction series in U.S. television history. The series also spawned a franchise which includes The Lone Gunmen spin-off, two theatrical films and accompanying merchandise. After the final theatrical film in 2008, fans continued to push for a third movie to conclude the series' plot lines, and in March 2015, Fox eventually announced that the series would return, with Chris Carter as executive producer and writer, and Duchovny, Anderson, Pileggi, Davis, and Gish all reprising their roles.|$|E

5|$|With Peter Schneider, Ehlers {{embarked}} on an in-depth study of the foundations of gravitational lensing. One result of this work was a 1992 monograph co-authored with Schneider and Emilio Falco. It was the first systematic exposition of the topic that included both the theoretical foundations and the observational results. From the viewpoint of astronomy, gravitational lensing is often described using a quasi-Newtonian approximation—assuming the gravitational field to be small and the deflection angles to be minute—which is perfectly sufficient for most situations of astrophysical relevance. In contrast, the monograph developed a thorough and complete description of gravitational lensing from a fully relativistic space-time perspective. This feature of the book played a major part in <b>its</b> <b>long-term</b> positive reception. In the following years, Ehlers continued his research on the propagation of bundles of light in arbitrary spacetimes.|$|E
