Full scale testing in the laboratory is used to investigate the soil-host pipe-liner interaction. Two host pipe-liner systems are examined.

40|$|A European {{research}} project (RFCS) {{has started to}} provide economic and safe guidance {{for the design of}} spirally welded tubes in combined walls. The main motivation for this project called COMBITUBE is that the current Eurocode 3 regulations for tubes in quay walls lead to uneconomic designs, because of poor local buckling design rules for these tubes. Because the most important load in quay walls is bending due to <b>earth</b> <b>load,</b> economic design implies a high diameter to wall thickness ratio. For relatively thin walled shells, the Eurocode 3 rules provide good results for the local buckling stress. For thicker walled shells where local buckling occurs when a part of the cross section has yielded, rather poor and uneconomic estimates of the local buckling bending moment are obtained. Also, no information on the deformation capacity is given. A solution for this problem is the application of strain based design methods, where the strain at local buckling is determined, from which the curvature (deformation capacity) and via the stress strain relationship, the bending moment can be obtained. The advantages of strain based design are explained. In comparison with longitudinally welded tubes and seamless tubes not much bending test results are available for spirally welded tubes. Therefore in the project full scale four point bending tests on spirally welded tubes with diameters up to 1060 mm are performed. Test results obtained so far are presented. The test results are used for the validation of FEA models for parameter studies where the effect of geometrical conditions (spiral welds and girth welds, geometrical imperfections), material properties and loading (mainly combinations of bending moment, normal force and <b>earth</b> <b>loads)</b> on the local buckling curvature and bending moment capacity are determined. Therefore, in the test program accurate measurements are performed of these conditions.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The paper {{reports the}} results of six shaking table tests using reduced-scale model walls {{constructed}} with expanded polystyrene (EPS) panels to reduce dynamic <b>earth</b> <b>loads</b> due to base shaking. The results are compared with a nominal identical rigid (control) wall constructed without a seismic buffer. The test results show that dynamic load attenuation increased with decreasing geofoam stiffness. The test with the highest buffer stiffness resulted in a 15 % reduction in dynamic load and the test with lowest stiffness resulted in a 40 % reduction in dynamic load compared with the control wall. The results of these experiments provide proof of the concept that EPS panels placed against rigid walls can act as seismic buffers to attenuate dynamic loads due to ground shaking (e. g. earthquake). Additional quantitative data related to load–deformation–time response, back-calculated elastic modulus values for the EPS seismic buffer configurations, dynamic interface shear properties, acceleration amplification in the backfill soil and post-excitation stress relaxation-creep behaviour are also reported...|$|R

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} review {{was made of}} the design and construction of flexible metal and rigid reinforced concrete large-span culverts, past documented field experience of monitored culvert performance, and culvert failures. Full-scale field testing of a flexible metal and a reinforced concrete large-span culvert was conducted and the results compared with finite element computer analyses. Based on this work recommendations for improved design and construction of large-span culverts were developed. ^ The review of metal culvert design and construction practice revealed numerous differences among current methods as well as deficiencies. Proposed design limit states were identified and discussed for improved practice. An improved <b>earth</b> <b>load</b> thrust prediction model was developed based on past analytical work considering the flexural rigidity of the structure relative to the surrounding soil, in addition to other factors. The design curves for arching factors were extended to cover a wider range of structural backfill width conditions and shallower burial. Also, a proposed construction procedure was outlined to control construction moments based on deflection limits {{as a function of the}} expected level of construction control. ^ None of the existing methods explicitly deals with large-span reinforced concrete culvert design and construction practice. Therefore, a proposed design approach for these culverts was outlined. Construction practice was based on recommendations from the manufacturers. ^ The review of failure cases showed that most failures of large-span metal culverts occurred as a result of poor backfill procedures and/or poor backfill material selection. Other causes were excessive construction loads and invert uplift. Excessive deformation was the most common limit state reached before or at failure. Furthermore, significant variations in structural response may occur over time after construction. Therefore, better construction provisions and control are needed, coupled with consideration of flexural stiffness and moment capacity in design. ^ The field tests showed significant differences in structural behavior between backfilling and live load testing. The metal structure was successfully subjected to very heavy live loads at shallow cover conditions without the use of thrust beams or ribs (current practice). Finite element computer analyses of the two tests showed that <b>earth</b> <b>load</b> responses could be reasonably modeled; however, live load predictions were poor. ...|$|R

Observations of local buckling in the internal liners of these products have been examined and compared to stability assessments based on the conventional equation for buckling in stiffened plate structures (following modification of that equation to an equation that defines critical strain instead of critical stress). The strain levels that develop in the liner are, however, dependent on three-dimensional bending within the pipe profile.

40|$|Longitudinal {{fracture}} is one predominant observed {{failure mode}} in large diameter cast iron pipes installed between 1850 and early 1960 s. Some of these failures occur {{where there is}} evidence of some corrosion activity. This paper addresses three specific issues, namely, (1) review of expected loads, i. e., internal pressure, <b>earth</b> <b>loads,</b> traffic loads, (2) estimated pipe failure load (pipe resistance), and (3) estimated structural factor of safety. The second and third issues can be equally applicable to non-deteriorated and deteriorated pipes. The procedures described in this paper were motivated by the need to purposefully use the information derived from pipe inspection to assess the margin of safety of deteriorated large diameter cast iron pipes. A mechanistic model that accounts for cast iron material non-linearity is described. The model is validated using data obtained from experimental tests conducted in the mid 1930 s on undamaged (new) pipes. The model is subsequently extended to permit the analysis of pipes with corrosion pits or corroded areas. Reliability analysis using Monte Carlo simulations is proposed to account for uncertainties in input data. Illustrative analyses of 162 ̆ 033 and 482 ̆ 033 diameter pipes subjected to vertical loads and internal pressure showed that significantly high margins of safety exist in cast iron pipes with no damage (due to corrosion and or casting voids) while this margin of safety is meaningfully reduced in the presence of corrosion pits or corroded areas. The methodology described should enable engineers to realistically assess the pipe resistance capacity and hence the corresponding margin of safety of undamaged or damaged cast iron pipes encountered in current operational conditions.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{behavior}} of six reduced-scale reinforced soil walls under base excitation is investigated using physical shaking table tests. The models were tested {{to isolate the}} influence of facing geometry, facing mass and facing toe condition on response to simulated seismic loading. The walls were instrumented to measure facing lateral displacement, reinforcement strain, toe reaction loads and accelerations. The model walls were constructed with a structural facing and polymeric geogrid reinforcement layers and subjected to a stepped amplitude sinusoidal base input acceleration. The toe boundary condition and facing panel configuration {{were found to have}} a significant effect on model response. For example, the magnitude of the accumulated facing lateral displacement at the top of the vertical wall models and at the same base acceleration magnitude was less for vertical walls with a less massive facing panel regardless of toe boundary condition. For the same boundary condition, a wall with an inclined facing displaced less than the nominal identical vertical wall for the same base excitation level. The horizontally restrained toe in reduced-scale models attracted approximately 40 % to 60 % of the peak total horizontal <b>earth</b> <b>load</b> during base excitation, demonstrating that a stiff facing column plays an important role in resisting dynamic loads under simulated earthquake loading.

40|$|Abstract: The {{front-end}} loader is an indispensablemachine for the off-road construction equip-ment industry. It {{is a classic}} example of a working machine with complex interactions between its subsystems (hydraulic, mechanical, and electrical). Dynamic models of the full-scale vehicle coupled with event-based operatormodels are currently used to help quantify the overall system performance, efficiency, and operability. However, thesemodels are complex andnot always nec-essary to characterize the response of individual subsystems. There is great value added to the design process – especially in prototyping of new vehicle platforms – in development of simpler models that can quickly and accurately define first-order measures of system loads and per-formance. This paper presents a subscale dynamic model, which isolates the boom and bucket manipulator systems of the {{front-end loader}} for the purpose of design load characterization. The model includes state equations governing the hydraulic dynamics across the control valves and in the cylinders, as well as soil–tool interaction <b>loads</b> (passive <b>earth</b> <b>loads)</b> at the bucket cutting edge.

The influence of modified methods, rare earths kind and rare <b>earths</b> <b>loading</b> on {{the catalytic performance}} of Co/HMS was studied by the catalytic combustion of chlorobenzene (CB). It {{was found that the}} extra-framework Ce modified catalysts show the better catalytic performance than the framework Ln modified ones due to that the forming of CeO 2 is advantaged to obtain the fine Co 3 O 4 crystal clusters and the reduction of Ce 4 + ions to Ce 3 + species probably will promote neighboring reduction of Co species. The suitable extra-framework Ce loading (6 %, mass fraction) can effectively ameliorate the redox ability of Co species in the channel of HMS. Since the channel of HMS itself and Co(NO 3) (3) center dot 6 H(2) O aqueous solution both are hydrophilic, the polarity adjusting function of framework Ln to the internal reaction between Co species and support is not great in this case. However, the slightly improved redox ability and weak acidity originated from framework Ln still can do some contribution to the catalytic performance. The electronic structure of Co and Ce is advantageous to the delocalization of pi-electrons and the forming of radical species. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

The detected loading signals are larger at higher latitudes where pressure variations are greatest; the largest effect is observed at Fairbanks, Alaska (latitude 65 °), with a signal RMS of 5 mm. Out of 19 continuously operating GPS sites (with a mean of 281 daily solutions per site), 18 show a positive correlation between the GPS vertical estimates and the modeled loading displacements. Accounting for loading reduces the variance of the vertical station positions on 12 of the 19 sites investigated. Removing the modeled pressure loading from GPS determinations of baseline length for baselines longer than 6000 km reduces the variance on 73 of the 117 baselines investigated. The slight increase in variance for some of the sites and baselines is consistent with expected statistical fluctuations. The results from most stations are consistent with ∼ 65 % of the modeled pressure load being found in the GPS vertical position measurements. Removing an annual signal from both the measured heights and the modeled load time series leaves this value unchanged.

Among the deficiencies considered in this research are the use of tensile strength for compressive strength and the treatment of time-dependent properties. Also, current design procedures do not consider such factors as residual stresses, physical and chemical aging, stress concentrations, and environmental stress cracking. These factors were not considered in the present study either. ^ Laboratory tests performed on high density polyethylene pipe sections of different sizes and lining are described. Deformation rate tests involved the diametrical compression of pipe sections to high vertical deflections at various deformation rates. The tests showed pipe stiffness increase with increasing deformation rates. Stress-relaxation tests involved compressing pipe sections diametrically to specified vertical deflections and monitoring the load decay with time. The tests showed continuous decrease of the pipe Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus with time. ^ The performance over three years of an HDPE pipe under high fill is monitored. No wall crushing, structural buckling or excess deflection occurred. The pipe is in good physical condition of nearly round shape with most of the deflection occurring during the construction of the fill. Visual observation showed circumferential cracking of the unlined sections near the couplings, and buckling of the liner below springline level in the lined sections. Neither of these problems are addressed in current design practice. ^ Finite element analysis of the field installation is described.
