40|$|To gain needed {{insight into}} the effects of {{thickness}} to diameter ratio (t/Di), length to diameter ratio (l/Di), and helical angle (&alpha;) on the response of laminated tubes in material characterization tests, a unique new elasticity finite element program has been implemented which {{can deal with the}} general three-dimensional nature of axisym-metric composite bodies. The program, which is utilized here to analytically predict the response of unidirectional composite tube specimens to uniaxial tension/compression, differs from the usual finite element formulations in that it accounts for general anisotropy.

40|$|Abstract — In {{recent years}} many {{experimental}} and numerical {{studies have been}} conducted on the fatigue behaviour of CNG storage pressure vessels. The main objective of these studies is to estimate the total fatigue life, which consists of two parts: i) Life till crack nucleation and ii) Crack growth life. Although fatigue evaluation methods for metal cylinders are widely covered in literature including the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, comprehensive approaches for fatigue evaluation of composite-reinforced pressure vessels are very few. This paper calculates the fatigue life till crack nucleation for a steel-lined <b>hoop</b> <b>wrapped</b> composite pressure vessel containing a surface flaw (notch) using strain-life approach. Firstly, static stress analysis taking into account the non-linear material behaviour of steel liner was performed using finite element method to provide input for the fatigue analysis. Then fatigue analysis was carried out by applying a cyclic pressure inside the pre-stressed cylinder using strain-life approach, and the results obtained by the numerical simulations are discussed. The approach associated with these calculations can be used to study the effect of various material and geometry parameters on the fatigue life of the pressure vessel...|$|R

Four filament-wound, graphite epoxy tubes were studied to evaluate the effects of the rubber layer on the modal parameters (natural vibration frequencies, damping, and mode shapes). Tube 1 contained six alternating layers of 30 -degree helical wraps and 90 -degree <b>hoop</b> <b>wraps.</b> Tube 2 was identical to tube 1 {{with the addition of a}}n embedded 0. 030 -inch-thick rubber layer.

This report compares experimental modal parameters obtained by impact testing with analytical modal parameters obtained by NASTRAN finite-element analysis. Four test modes of tube 1 and five test modes of tube 3 correlate highly with corresponding analytical predictions. Unsatisfactory correlation of test and analysis results occurred for tubes 2 and 4 and these comparisons are not shown. Work is underway to improve the analytical models of these tubes. Test results clearly show that the embedded rubber layers significantly increase structural modal damping as well as decrease natural vibration frequencies...|$|R

Incorporating these FBG sensors for monitoring the integrity of structures during their life cycle will provide valuable information about viability of the usage of such material. The use of these sensors by surface bonding or embedding in this composite will measure internal strain and temperature, and hence the integrity of the assembled engineering structures. This paper focuses on such a structure, called a composite wound pressure vessel. This vessel was fabricated from the composite material: TRH 50 (a Mitsubishi carbon fiber with a 710 -ksi tensile strength and a 37 Msi modulus) impregnated with an epoxy resin from NEWPORT composites (WDE- 3 D- 1). This epoxy resin in water dispersed system without any solvents and it cures in the 240 - 310 degrees F range. This is a toughened resin system specifically designed for pressure applications. These materials are a natural fit for fiber sensors since the polyimide outer buffer coating of fiber can be integrated into the polymer matrix of the composite material with negligible residual stress. The tank was wound with two helical patterns and 4 <b>hoop</b> <b>wraps.</b> The order of winding is: two hoops, two helical and two hoops. The wall thickness of the composite should be about 80 mil or less. The tank should burst near 3, 000 psi or less. We can measure the actual wall thickness by ultrasonic or we can burst the tank and measure the pieces. Figure 1 shows a cylinder fabricated out of carbon-epoxy composite material. The strain in different directions is measured with a surface bonded fiber Bragg gratings and with embedded fiber Bragg gratings as the cylinder is pressurized to burst pressures.

40|$|Bisphenol A (BPA) is a {{synthetic}} unit of polycarbonate polymers and epoxy resins, {{the types of}} plastics that {{could be found in}} essentially every human population and incorporated into almost every aspect of the modern human society. BPA polymers appear {{in a wide range of}} products, from liquid storages (plastic bottles, can and glass linings, water pipes and tanks) and food storages (plastics <b>wraps</b> and <b>containers),</b> to medical and dental devices. BPA polymers could be hydrolyzed spontaneously or in a photo- or temperature-catalyzed process, providing widespread environmental distribution and chronic exposure to the BPA monomer in contemporary human populations. Bisphenol A is also a xenoestrogen, an endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) that interferes with the endocrine system mimicking the effects of an estrogen and could potentially keep our endocrine system in a constant perturbation that parallels endocrine disruption arising during pregnancy, such as insulin resistance (IR). Gestational insulin resistance represents a natural biological phenomenon of higher insulin resistance in peripheral tissues of the pregnant females, when nutrients are increasingly being directed to the embryo instead of being stored in peripheral tissues. Gestational diabetes mellitus may appear in healthy non-diabetic females, due to gestational insulin resistance that leads to increased blood sugar levels and hyperinsulinemia (increased insulin production from the pancreatic beta cells). The hypothesis states that unnoticed and constant exposure to this environmental chemical might potentially lead to the formation of chronic low-level endocrine disruptive state that resembles gestational insulin resistance, which might contribute to the development of diabetes. The increasing body of evidence supports the major premises of this hypothesis, as exemplified by the numerous publications examining the association of BPA and insulin resistance, both epidemiological and mechanistic. However, to what extent BPA might contribute to the development of diabetes in the modern societies still remains unknown. In this review, I discuss the chemical properties of BPA and the sources of BPA contamination found in the environment and in human tissues. I provide an overview of mechanisms for the proposed role of bisphenol A in insulin resistance and diabetes, as well as other related diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases. I describe the transmission of BPA effects to the offspring and postulate that gender related differences might originate from differences in liver enzyme levels, such as UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, which is involved in BPA processing and its elimination from the organism. I discuss the molecular mechanisms of BPA action through nuclear and membrane-bound ER receptors, non-monotonic dose response, epigenetic modifications of the DNA and propose that chronic exposure to weak binders, such as BPA, may mimic the effects of strong binders, such as estrogens...|$|R
40|$|The peanut {{is one of}} {{the crops}} chosen for use in NASA's Advanced Life Support Program (ALS). The peanut is a source of both oil and protein. After oil is {{extracted}} from the peanut, a protein rich flour remains. An edible peanut protein film is one use for this flour. Two types of film are developed for this study, one set of film contains 10 % fat while the other set contains no fat. For film without fat the defatting of the peanut by the Soxhlet method {{is the first step in}} the manufacturing process of the film. Secondly, the protein is precipitated at its isoelectric point (pH 4. 5) and centrifuged to separate the protein from the non-protein. After freeze-drying the protein it is milled in a ceramic ball mill to decrease particle size and sifted through a series of sieves to determine particle size distribution. Those particles retained on the 100 mesh sieves are utilized for film formation. Larger particles are re-ground and sifted. Five grams of protein is mixed with 50 mL of distilled water, 70 mL of 80 % ethanol, 15 mL of 6 N ammonium hydroxide and a plasticizer. This mixture is heated for 30 minutes until the temperature reaches 70 C. The mixture is then poured onto a level Teflon coated glass surface. After allowing the film to form overnight under a ventilation hood, it is manually removed from the plate.

But instead of the traditional allure of a meal awaiting an unseen viewer’s consumption, Letinsky photographs the remains of the table so as to investigate the precarious relationships between ripeness and decay, delicacy and awkwardness, control and haphazardness, waste and plenitude, pleasure and sustenance. What is looked at is [...] "after the fact," [...] what (ma)lingers, what persists, and by inference, what is gone. The photographs in After All veer into darkness; literally, as regards the time of day the photograph is made, as well as emotionally and psychologically. Little bits and pieces hover in white grounds blown flat by blinding light, later lurking in deep inky grayed out pools. Light, through its abundance and its absence, can record and reveal as well as obscure and exaggerate. Formally, through degrees of control and chaos, the domestic scenes Letinsky photographs are redolent with the allures of domesticity (safety, comfort, familiarity) as well as its dangers (boredom, satiation, lack of desire).

40|$|External bonding {{of carbon}} fibre {{reinforced}} polymer (CFRP) sheets with epoxy resin has been effectively used to strengthen and repair concrete structures. In recent years, {{there has been}} resurgence {{in the use of}} CFRP to strengthen steel bridges and structures as a result of increased service loads, corrosion and inadequate maintenance. This strengthening system may be extended to steel tubular structures, which may be prone to local buckling. Only a few studies tested steel tubular sections of wider section slenderness range, such as compact, non-compact and slender sections in bending, and addressed the behaviour of such sections reinforced using bidirectional (longitudinal and <b>hoop</b> directions) CFRP <b>wraps.</b> In addition, few studies have investigated the response of fully effective and not-fully effective composite steel hollow sections in compression. The research aims to understand the structural behaviour of steel circular hollow section (CHS) beams and short columns externally reinforced with CFRP sheets by means of static tests and theoretical analysis, and to develop rules for strength design of the composite sections. The effects of much wider section slenderness ratios, amount of CFRP and fibre orientation were examined. Initially, the flexural behaviour was investigated by conducting experiments on eighteen CHS beams (five control specimens and thirteen reinforced with CFRP sheets) under pure bending. The diameter-to-thickness ratios of the tubes used in the tests ranged from 12 to 96. Rotation and strain measurements at mid-length were taken. The reinforced beams had better performance compared with their bare steel counterparts, especially for tubes with larger diameter-to-thickness ratios. The experimental results have demonstrated that it improved the bending strength and rotation capacity of the bcams. The improvement in the behaviour of the CFRP-reinforced tubes appears {{to be related to the}} delay or elimination of elastic local buckling in slender section tubes as a result of the restraint provided by the hoop CFRP layers. The longitudinal fibre layers were shown to be effective in providing strength in the CHS beams. The increase in bending capacity obtained in the tests was between 3 and 90 %. The main failure mode of the strengthened beams is associated with crushing of the CFRP sheets. The second test programme was performed on short CHS columns subjected to axial compression. A total of ten columns were tested, of which six were reinforced with CFRP sheets and four were control specimens. The tubes have diameter-to-thickness ratios of ranging between 37 and 78. The parameters investigated included the amount of CFRP, the diameter-to-thickness ratio of the steel tube and the fibre configuration. The axial load-shortening and strains at mid-length of the tube were recorded throughout the period of loading. A theoretical model was developed to calculate the ultimate moment capacity of CFRP-reinforced steel CHS beams subjected to bending. The ultimate capacity was calculated based on equilibrium of forces and strain compatibility between CFRP and steel. The model assumed that the steel is either elastic, elastic-plastic or plastic at ultimate. Two cases were included in the analysis, one of which considers the CFRP in compression and the other does not account for the CFRP in compression. It was found that the CFRP in compression has significant influence on the ultimate capacity of CHS beams. Further analysis was carried out to predict the moment-curvature response of CFRP-reinforced steel CHS beams. Material nonlinearity was implemented using a tri-linear stress-strain relationship for the steel and a linear elastic relationship for the CFRP material, involving subdivision of the section into elemental areas. The inclusion of volume fractions of the fibre and adhesive is necessary to determine the elastic properties of the CFRP. The nonlinear equilibrium equations were solved using an incremental-iterative method. The analytical predictions were verified with the experimental results. It was shown that the volume fraction of the fibre has an effect on the initial stiffness of CHS beams. The effects of local imperfections in slender section tubes and strain hardening in the post-yield stage would need to be taken into account in the analysis to improve the accuracy of the results. A design method based on the modular ratio concept was proposed for the CFRP¬-reinforced steel circular tubular beams and short columns. The applicability of current section slenderness limits for steel hollow sections for the design of CFRP-reinforced steel CHS has been discussed. Design expressions for CFRP-reinforced CHS were derived as a function of the parameters related to the amount of CFRP, the elastic modulus of hoop CFRP, the geometrical slenderness, and the yield stress of steel. Design curves illustrating the significance of strengthening parameters were developed, and they form the basis of a simple and effective design procedure for CFRP-reinforced steel CHS tubular beams and columns...|$|R
