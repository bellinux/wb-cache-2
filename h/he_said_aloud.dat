2500|$|... "Ay," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>aloud.</b> There is no {{translation}} {{for this}} word {{and perhaps it}} is just a noise such as a man might make, involuntarily, feeling the nail go through his hands and into the wood.|$|E
60|$|For {{quite a while}} Rezu went on staring. Then <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>aloud</b> {{as if he were}} {{thinking}} to himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Glover," [...] {{said the}} skipper to himself with dismal intuition. [...] "I met a friend here {{the day before}} yesterday," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>aloud.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "That's what we want," [...] muttered Carter {{under his}} breath. [...] "Imposter! What {{do you call}} yourself?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> half <b>aloud</b> to Shaw.|$|R
6000|$|As he {{sat there}} {{on the edge of}} the precipice, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> half <b>aloud,</b> [...] "What {{prevents}} me from darting suddenly on that fellow and knocking him down?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{climb up}} in this darkness," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> half <b>aloud.</b> [...] "I might slip and break my neck. I had better walk along and hunt for some natural upward slope." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>aloud,</b> [...] "the Jew Caleb. Now I understand." [...] Then {{he marched}} forward {{and gave the}} {{military}} salute to the prince.|$|E
6000|$|... "Paula, Paula," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>aloud,</b> [...] "are you {{surprising}} {{yourself and}} me {{after all these}} years? Are you turning madcap at sober middle age?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought so," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>aloud,</b> as {{he placed}} the needle in a pocket instrument-case: [...] "the stem of the leaf of the coucourite palm!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{too cold}} to travel, anyway," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> <b>He</b> spoke <b>aloud,</b> after the manner of men who are much by themselves. [...] "Only a fool would travel at such a temperature. If it isn't eighty below, it's because it's seventy- nine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What {{does the}} Faun mean,' <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> half <b>aloud</b> to himself, 'by {{telling me that}} the Painted People have changed?' He caught sight of Una's yellow head. 'Have you seen a painted lead-slinger?' he called.|$|R
6000|$|Then Dane, {{standing}} beside his leader, saw the grimness grow a trifle less marked in his eyes. [...] "It {{is in the}} blood," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> half <b>aloud,</b> but Dane heard him and afterwards remembered it.|$|R
6000|$|Some {{hours later}} <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>aloud,</b> tossing about in bed: [...] "I wonder if I was too fresh. I hope I wasn't. I {{ought to be}} careful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{you never}} feel any embarrassment from {{the sense of}} your youth--that you are a lovely young woman on whom men's eyes are fixed?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>aloud.</b>|$|E
6000|$|After {{the door}} slammed, Sanford took the sheet from the {{envelope}} and reread it. At length he dropped into his chair. [...] "That settles it," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>aloud.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Not a {{pleasant}} one, but he bore {{it as well}} as he could, and when his mates left him stranded in a corner, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> half <b>aloud,</b> with a long breath, as if the battle had been a hard one,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{how exactly}} like an egg <b>he</b> is!' she <b>said</b> <b>aloud,</b> {{standing}} {{with her hands}} ready to catch him, for she was every moment expecting him to fall.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why don't {{somebody}} send in an alarm?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> speaking <b>aloud</b> in his anxiety, {{although there}} was no one at hand to hear him. [...] "Seth an' Dan will be burned to death if the engines don't get here mighty soon!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Old man, if {{you must}} roll, wait till I {{get back to the}} girl, and then roll!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>aloud,</b> as if the stones were indeed a god.|$|E
6000|$|Wilson said to himself, [...] "Aha!" [...] {{and thought}} of the mysterious girl in the bedroom. [...] "The Driscolls have been making discoveries!" [...] Then <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>aloud,</b> gravely: ...|$|E
6000|$|Caleb got up {{and looked}} at the blazing mass a minute or two, in despair; but finding that it kept on burning, his eye {{suddenly}} brightened, and <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>aloud,</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It don't {{take much}} fishin' {{to find out}} how the wind blows, you blessed innocents," [...] thought John Adams, with a quiet chuckle, which {{somewhat}} disconcerted Dan; but <b>he</b> only <b>said</b> <b>aloud,</b> [...] "Well, yes, you may come, but only on condition that you swim alongside, for I mean to carry a cargo of staggerers and sprawlers." ...|$|R
6000|$|Jack gasped, then he sighed, {{after which}} he smiled and began to pace the hall slowly. At last <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> half <b>aloud,</b> [...] "I think I'll smoke my pipe to-night with that poor fellow, O'Donel. He must be lonely enough, and I don't often condescend to be social." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{walk along}} {{on this side}} until I {{get a chance to}} cross over," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> half <b>aloud,</b> and then the {{loneliness}} of his situation dawned upon him. He struck out without delay, determined {{to catch up with the}} others of the party as quickly as possible.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{the monks}} drink this nectar?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>aloud,</b> and laughed sneeringly. [...] "I know the breed--the fair found belly wi' fat capon lined. Tha's your poverty {{stricken}} Capuchin." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Would he {{had been}} as frank!" [...] thought Egremont. And must he quit her in this way. Never! [...] "You must indeed let me attend you!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>aloud.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "This," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>aloud,</b> [...] "is a {{nightmare}} from which I must awaken or lose all my power {{of action and}} my ability to help my country in its peril." ...|$|E
6000|$|Wilson said to himself, [...] "Anybody with a {{reasonably}} good head {{would have thought}} of it. I am not surprised that Blake didn't detect it; I am only surprised that Tom did. There is more to him than I supposed." [...] <b>He</b> <b>said</b> nothing <b>aloud,</b> and Tom went on: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "About {{five miles}} from here. Yes, {{we can get to}} him if we want to." [...] Pawnee Brown mused for a moment. [...] "I'll risk it," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> half <b>aloud.</b> [...] "They can't arrest me for coming to expose a criminal, and I have the facts right here in my pocket." ...|$|R
6000|$|He asked Ailie to {{give him}} the plant, and he kept it in his room very lovingly, though he forgot to water it. He sat for long periods looking at it, and his {{thoughts}} were very deep, but all <b>he</b> actually <b>said</b> <b>aloud</b> was, [...] "There are two of us." [...] Aaron sometimes saw them together, and thought they were an odd pair, and perhaps they were.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now if I don't get the fever," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>aloud,</b> and at {{the same}} moment {{resolved}} to go to taking quinine {{as soon as he was}} strong enough to dare.|$|E
6000|$|... "We shall lose this," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>aloud</b> in despair; [...] "suspicious {{circumstances}} {{are not enough}} to upset a will," [...] and then, addressing Beatrice, who {{was sitting at the}} table, working: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hai! The white man. I know!" [...] {{he murmured}} absently. [...] "This white man or another. [...] . Tuan," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>aloud</b> with {{unexpected}} animation, [...] "you are {{a man of}} the sea?" ...|$|E
6000|$|After {{everybody}} had gone home, Dr. Alec paced {{up and down}} the lower hall in the twilight for an hour, thinking so intently that sometimes he frowned, sometimes he smiled, and more than once he stood still in a brown study. All of a sudden <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> half <b>aloud,</b> as if he had made up his mind, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now as to terms," [...] {{repeated}} Bartley to himself; but <b>he</b> <b>said</b> nothing <b>aloud.</b> <b>He</b> {{felt that}} Witherby had {{cut out a}} great deal of work for him, and work of a kind that he could not easily find another man both willing and able to do. He resolved that he would have all that his service was worth.|$|R
6000|$|... "O, {{are you at}} that?" [...] thought Hereward. [...] "Tout est perdu. The {{question}} is, Earl," [...] <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>aloud,</b> [...] "simply this: How {{many men}} can you raise off this shire?" ...|$|R
