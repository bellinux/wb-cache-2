60|$|Skiff Miller shook <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>no</b> longer belligerent, but kindly, {{quick to}} be generous in {{response}} to generousness.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's a braw day {{coming for}} him, then," [...] said I, [...] "for he'll {{have to learn}} {{of it on the}} deaf side of <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>no</b> later than to-morrow, when I call on him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{fell out}} with Antipas over {{the matter of}} Herodias. John was a moralist. It is too long a story, but he paid for it with <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> <b>No,</b> there was nothing {{political}} in that affair." ...|$|E
60|$|JOHNSON (shaking <b>his</b> <b>head).</b> I've <b>no</b> orders. You {{must wait}} til the capn comes, sir.|$|R
60|$|Harper made an assenting {{inclination}} with <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> but <b>no</b> other reply, to this remark; while Mr. Wharton, after lighting his pipe, resumed the subject.|$|R
6000|$|He shook <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> 'Oh, <b>no.</b> I couldn't climb at all. I must be lifted, somehow. You {{had better}} {{go back to}} Lungern and bring men to help you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{fisherman}} shook <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> <b>No,</b> {{he would}} not go; he had said {{he would not}}, and he would not. But the wife only smiled and said again, [...] "My advice to you is that you go." ...|$|E
6000|$|Running to the window, {{he opened}} it, {{and put out}} <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> <b>No</b> fog, no mist; clear, bright, jovial, stirring, cold; cold, piping for the blood to dance to; Golden sun-light; Heavenly sky; sweet fresh air; merry bells. Oh, glorious! Glorious! ...|$|E
60|$|ZOE: (Tragically) Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! (She {{takes his}} hand) Blue eyes beauty I'll read your hand. (She {{points to his}} forehead) No wit, no wrinkles. (She counts) Two, three, Mars, that's courage. (Stephen shakes <b>his</b> <b>head)</b> <b>No</b> kid.|$|E
60|$|The man {{who heard}} this {{attempt to take}} his duty and {{perquisites}} over <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> lost <b>no</b> time in pocketing the money, and departed on his errand {{as fast as he}} could.|$|R
60|$|Her afflicted father hung <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> {{and offered}} <b>no</b> reply {{but in his}} penitence and sorrow.|$|R
60|$|Dr. Whitlett shook <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> He had <b>no</b> elucidation to offer. The {{thing was}} {{absolutely}} mysterious.|$|R
60|$|Graham {{lifted his}} arm and was {{astonished}} to find what strength the restoratives had given him. He thrust one leg {{over the side of}} the couch and then the other. <b>His</b> <b>head</b> <b>no</b> longer swam. He could scarcely credit his rapid recovery. He sat feeling his limbs.|$|E
60|$|From {{that moment}} Blunt {{began to lose}} <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> <b>No</b> doubt he had not thought of such a serious fight as this when he had given his challenge, {{and there was a}} savage bull-dog {{tenacity}} about Myles that could not but have had a somewhat demoralizing effect upon him.|$|E
6000|$|... "A goodly knight, all armd in harnesse meete, [...] That from <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>no</b> place {{appeared}} to his feete, [...] His carriage was full comely and upright; [...] His countenance demure and temperate; [...] But yett so sterne and terrible in sight, [...] That cheard his friendes, and did his foes amate." ...|$|E
50|$|Joe: A {{drink of}} water, my foot! You {{came down to}} sneak some food out of the kitchen, didn't you? Huh? Didn't you, Hoss? And you're sorry, aren't you? (Hoss shakes <b>his</b> <b>head)</b> Oh, <b>no,</b> you're not sorry.|$|R
60|$|Sir Patrick slowly raised <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> There was <b>no</b> irritation--there {{was only}} {{distress}} in his face--when he spoke next.|$|R
6000|$|Two of them unfurled {{a banner}} between poles which bore the legend: 'The Earth is flat.' Woodhouse and I turned to Bat. He shook <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> 'No, <b>no!</b> Not me.... If I had only seen their costumes in advance!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Phil, I {{would not}} {{put it into}} <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> <b>No</b> doubt you would take very good care of him, but I doubt whether your father would like the Bishop to hear of him--under the circumstances--going to disport himself at the dragoon mess. Besides, I don't {{think he will be}} well enough before Lent, and then of course he could not." ...|$|E
60|$|To set {{the mind}} of his {{mistress}} at rest, {{he took a sip}} (amounting in quantity to a pint or thereabouts) from the stone bottle, and then smacked his lips, winked his eye, and nodded <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> <b>No</b> doubt with the same amiable desire, he immediately resumed his knife and fork, as a practical assurance that the beer had wrought no bad effect upon his appetite.|$|E
60|$|At last however, Neptune {{appeared}} to take pity {{on the poor}} student. His recovery--at least as regarded the sea-sickness--was sudden. He awoke, {{on the morning after}} the opening of the case of books, quite restored. He could hardly believe it. <b>His</b> <b>head</b> <b>no</b> longer swam; other parts of him no longer heaved. The first intimation that Skipper Martin had of the change was John Binning bursting into a hymn with the voice of a stentor. He rose and donned his clothes.|$|E
60|$|The old man merely bowed <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{and made}} <b>no</b> answer. His fiery spirit {{seemed to be}} crushed out of him.|$|R
60|$|But Eric shook <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> making <b>no</b> answer. Then, leaving Skallagrim {{with the}} dead, he turned, and striding back alone towards the hall, {{sat down on}} a rock in the home meadows and, {{covering}} his face with his hands, wept for his comrades.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No!' said Mr. jorkins, {{stopping}} {{at the door to}} shake <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> 'Oh, <b>no!</b> I object, you know,' which he said very rapidly, and went out. 'You must be aware, Mr. Copperfield,' he added, looking restlessly in at the door again, 'if Mr. Spenlow objects--' ...|$|R
60|$|When {{once the}} Marquis, {{as he was}} wont, put {{on one of the}} old helmets that were stuck up in his hall; though <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>no</b> more filled it than a dry pea its pease cod; yet his eyes sparkled {{from the bottom of the}} iron cavern with the brilliancy of carbuncles, and when he poised the {{ponderous}} two-handled sword of his ancestors, you would have thought you saw the doughty little David wielding the sword of Goliath, which was unto him like a weaver's beam.|$|E
60|$|But {{the dogs}} snarled and drew in, and he broke off, {{listening}} to the crunch-crunch of many snowshoes. Indian after Indian stalked into the firelight, tall and grim, fur-clad and silent, their shadows dancing grotesquely on the snow. One, the witch doctor, spoke gutturally to Sipsu. His face was daubed with savage paint blotches, and over his shoulders was drawn a wolfskin, the gleaming teeth and cruel snout surmounting <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> <b>No</b> other word was spoken. The prospectors held the peace. Sipsu arose and slipped into her snowshoes.|$|E
6000|$|They named Asmund {{master of}} the game, and his word must be law to both of them. Eric claimed that Asmund should hold the sword Whitefire that was at stake, but Ospakar gainsaid him, saying that if he gave Whitefire into Asmund's keeping, Eric must also give his eye--and about this they debated hotly. Now the matter was brought before Asmund as umpire, and he gave {{judgment}} for Eric, [...] "for," [...] he said, [...] "if Eric yield up his eye into my hand, I can return it to <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>no</b> more if he should win; but if Ospakar gives me the good sword and conquers, {{it is easy for}} me to pass it back to him unharmed." ...|$|E
60|$|His {{father had}} told him, {{whatever}} he did, never to peach on a fellow. He shook <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and answered <b>no</b> and felt glad.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the cartoon}} The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, he appears with Attila the Hun and Abraham Lincoln to give Mandy advice after she summons spirits from Grim's skull. He is shown {{with a sword}} through <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> {{although}} <b>no</b> accounts of Rasputin's death involve a sword.|$|R
6000|$|... "Weel, in the {{confusion}} o' things after the propeller had dropped off an' the engines were racin' an' a', it's vara possible that Calder might ha' lost it off <b>his</b> <b>head</b> an' <b>no</b> troubled himself {{to pick it up}} again. I remember seem' that cap on him at Southampton." ...|$|R
6000|$|Next day, when Jeff--having {{got rid of}} the nose-plaster, {{and removed}} the mud, and brushed the dishevelled hair, and put on dry garments--paid another visit to Miss Millet, the Rosebud formed a more correct {{estimate}} of her condition, became alarmed, and shrank like a sensitive plant before the gaze of the coastguardsman; insomuch that she drove him to the conclusion that he had no hope whatever in that quarter, and that he was foolish to think of her seriously. What was she, after all? A mere chit of a school girl! It was ridiculous. He would heave her overboard forthwith, and trouble <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>no</b> more about her. He would not, however, give up visiting his old confidante on her account--oh dear, no! ...|$|E
60|$|Not so Caleb Balderstone. If wordly profit {{could have}} consoled the old man, his age was better {{provided}} for than his earlier years had ever been; but life had lost to him its salt and its savour. His whole course of ideas, his feelings, whether of pride or of apprehension, of pleasure or of pain, had all arisen from its close connexion {{with the family}} which was now extinguished. He held up <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>no</b> longer, forsook all his usual haunts and occupations, and seemed only to find pleasure in moping about those apartments in the old castle which the Master of Ravenswood had last inhabited. He ate without refreshment, and slumbered without repose; and, with a fidelity sometimes displayed by the canine race, but seldom by human beings, he pined and died within {{a year after the}} catastrophe which we have narrated.|$|E
6000|$|... "Married," [...] {{suggested}} Lady Albury, more plainly. Mr. Dosett shook <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> <b>No</b> idea on {{the subject}} had ever flashed across his mind. To provide bread and meat, a bed and clothes, for his sister's child he had felt to be a duty,--but not a husband. Husbands came, or did not,--as the heavens might be propitious. That Ayala should go to Stalham {{for the sake of}} finding a husband was certainly beyond the extent of his providing care. [...] "In fact how is a girl to have a chance at all unless she is allowed to see some one? Of course I don't say this with reference to our house. There will be no young men there, or anything of that kind. But, taking a broad view, unless you let a girl like that have what chances come in her way how is she to get on? I think you have hardly a right to do it." ...|$|E
60|$|I saw Louis {{half turn}} <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> There was <b>no</b> {{change in his}} tone nor in his expression. Naturally, therefore, his words sounded a little strangely.|$|R
60|$|With that he hung <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> {{and said}} <b>no</b> more, wasted and wretched, {{he was not}} a {{creature}} upon whom to heap reproaches that were unavailing.|$|R
5000|$|... “… He {{looked at}} his clock and shook <b>his</b> <b>head</b> pensively. <b>No,</b> dear sir, no, you are wiring about that. It {{has nothing to do}} with the bombs. You should not keep talking about the bombs. No. At 2:30. At night I mean. Nearly always at 2:30. That is just it…” ...|$|R
