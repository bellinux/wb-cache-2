5|$|Carson and {{the others}} {{involved}} with publication of Silent Spring expected fierce criticism. They were particularly concerned {{about the possibility of}} being sued for libel. Carson was also undergoing radiation therapy to combat her spreading cancer, and expected to have little energy to devote to defending her work and responding to critics. In preparation for the anticipated attacks, Carson and <b>her</b> <b>agent</b> attempted to amass as many prominent supporters as possible before the book's release.|$|E
5|$|Although the British Army {{refused to}} co-operate with the producers—and Winston Churchill thought the film would ruin wartime morale—Colonel Blimp confounded critics when {{it proved to}} be an artistic and {{commercial}} success. Powell hoped to reunite Kerr and lead actor Roger Livesey in his next film, A Canterbury Tale (1944), but <b>her</b> <b>agent</b> had sold her contract to MGM. According to Powell, his affair with Kerr ended when she made it clear to him that she would accept an offer to go to Hollywood if one were made.|$|E
5|$|Her {{first scene}} was for The Oral Adventures of Craven Moorehead 8 with <b>her</b> <b>agent</b> Slim Shady (Dez) {{and his best}} friend, Moorehead. It was {{intended}} to only be an oral scene, but {{in the heat of}} the moment she had intercourse with both. The next day she shot a scene with Miles Long in Joey Silvera's Service Animals 4. A few months later, she realized that she did not need an agent and started to represent herself.|$|E

5|$|Leigh {{appeared}} with Robert Taylor, Lionel Barrymore and Maureen O'Sullivan in A Yank at Oxford (1938), {{which was the}} first of her films to receive attention in the United States. During production, she developed a reputation for being difficult and unreasonable, partly because she disliked her secondary role but mainly because her petulant antics seemed to be paying dividends. After dealing with the threat of a lawsuit brought over a frivolous incident, Korda, however, instructed <b>her</b> <b>agent</b> to warn her that her option would not be renewed if her behaviour did not improve. Her next role was in Sidewalks of London, also known as St. Martin's Lane (1938), with Charles Laughton.|$|E
5|$|Patty Hearst guest {{stars in}} the episode, {{something}} that was planned since July 2006. Hearst {{did not know that}} she would be appearing on the show until after she was chosen {{due to a lack of}} communication between her and <b>her</b> <b>agent.</b> She was reluctant to appear as a character similar to herself, but she eventually agreed. In addition, Hearst's character was initially scheduled to have a lesbian kiss with Keri Lynn Pratt's character, but the scene was vetoed by the network for unknown reasons.|$|E
5|$|The {{casting process}} for Monica Reyes was unconventional. Gish {{received}} a call from <b>her</b> <b>agent,</b> who informed her that The X-Files were looking for a new female character. Gish applied for the part, but instead of having to a do a reading, she only had to meet with Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz. After receiving the part, Gish's first shot was scheduled four in the morning; her first scene in the episode was to run down a hill to discover a former abductee.|$|E

5|$|Throughout her career, Godwin worked {{consistently}} with <b>her</b> <b>agent,</b> John Hawkins, but {{worked with}} several different publishing houses. Godwin's early books were published by Knopf. After the editor for The Perfectionists, David Segal, died suddenly {{of a heart}} attack, Robert Gottlieb from Knopf became her editor for her next four books. Godwin credits Gottlieb {{for much of the}} success of her early works. Later on, when Godwin's then-recent books were less widely read, USA Today commented that this could be in part because she was no longer working with Gottlieb. After Knopf, Godwin contracted with Viking, who offered larger advances and more publicity for her books.|$|E
5|$|Babbit {{recruited}} Clea DuVall, who had {{starred in}} her short film Sleeping Beauties, {{to play the}} role of Graham Eaton. Babbit says that she was able to get a lot of the cast through DuVall, including Natasha Lyonne and Melanie Lynskey. Lyonne first saw the script in the back of DuVall's car and subsequently contacted <b>her</b> <b>agent</b> about it. She had seen and enjoyed Babbit's short Sleeping Beauties and was eager to work with the director. She was not the first choice for the role of Megan. An unnamed actress wanted to play the part but eventually turned it down because of religious beliefs; she did not want her family to see her face on the poster. Babbit briefly considered Rosario Dawson as Megan but her executive producer persuaded her that Dawson, who is Hispanic, would not be right for the All-American character.|$|E
5|$|Coyle cold called Kristin Chenoweth's {{agent and}} {{proposed}} the part, which {{is different from}} her usual roles, and <b>her</b> <b>agent</b> {{said it was the}} exact part the actress was seeking. In order to film Into Temptation, Chenoweth took a five-day hiatus from her supporting role on the ABC television series Pushing Daisies. Brian Baumgartner, best known for his supporting role as Kevin Malone in the NBC comedy series The Office, was a regular theater performer in the Minneapolis – Saint Paul area before joining that show. While visiting New York City in May 2008 for an upfront presentation, shortly after having finished filming the fourth season of The Office, Baumgartner was offered the Into Temptation script by Coyle, who asked him to consider taking the role of Father Ralph O'Brien. Baumgartner said he enjoyed the script and agreed to the part.|$|E

50|$|Pyun {{returned}} to Alex Rain in 1991, after making the virtual reality film Arcade for Full Moon Entertainment. Pyun's research on that film {{gave him a}} number of ideas he wanted to incorporate into Alex Rain, including lowering {{the age of the}} protagonist to 13 and making Alex a tough, violent street urchin working undercover for a futuristic L.A.P.D. Having just worked with Megan Ward on Arcade, Pyun met with Ward and <b>her</b> <b>agents</b> to outline the film and discuss casting her as the lead. Ward and <b>her</b> <b>agents</b> responded favorably, despite reservations about the high level of violence and a scene which called for her character to be completely nude. Pyun shot a few test scenes with Ward and then began looking for a studio partner.|$|R

In a press release, Rowling said that her new book would be quite different from Harry Potter. In April 2012, Little, Brown and Company announced that the book was titled The Casual Vacancy and would be released on 27 September 2012. Rowling gave several interviews and made appearances to promote The Casual Vacancy, including at the London Southbank Centre, the Cheltenham Literature Festival, Charlie Rose and the Lennoxlove Book Festival. In its first three weeks of release, The Casual Vacancy sold over 1 million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|In 1571, Cecil and Walsingham {{uncovered}} the Ridolfi Plot, {{which was a}} plan to replace Elizabeth with Mary {{with the help of}} Spanish troops and the Duke of Norfolk. Norfolk was executed, and the English Parliament introduced a bill barring Mary from the throne, to which Elizabeth refused to give royal assent. To discredit Mary, the casket letters were published in London. Plots centred on Mary continued. Pope Gregory XIII endorsed one plan {{in the latter half of}} the 1570s to marry her to the governor of the Low Countries and half-brother of Philip II of Spain, Don John of Austria, who was supposed to organise the invasion of England from the Spanish Netherlands. After the Throckmorton Plot of 1583, Walsingham introduced the Bond of Association and the Act for the Queen's Safety, which sanctioned the killing of anyone who plotted against Elizabeth and aimed to prevent a putative successor from profiting from her murder. In February 1585, William Parry was convicted of plotting to assassinate Elizabeth, without Mary's knowledge, though <b>her</b> <b>agent</b> Thomas Morgan was implicated. In April, Mary was placed in the stricter custody of Sir Amias Paulet, and at Christmas she was moved to a moated manor house at Chartley.|$|E
5|$|Rand wrote Night of January 16th in 1933. She was 28 and {{had been}} in the United States for seven years after emigrating from the Soviet Union, where her strong anti-Communist {{opinions}} had put her at risk. Rand had never written a stage play, but had worked in Hollywood as a junior screenwriter for Cecil B. DeMille, and later in RKO Studios' wardrobe department. In September 1932, Rand sold an original screenplay, Red Pawn, to Universal Studios and quit RKO to finish her first novel, We the Living. She wrote the stage play with the hope of making money from it while finishing her novel. By 1934 <b>her</b> <b>agent</b> was trying to sell the play and the novel, but both were repeatedly rejected. Red Pawn was shelved and Rand's contract for rewrites on it expired. Rand's husband, actor Frank O'Connor, was getting only minor roles with little pay, leaving the couple in financial difficulties. With the last of her money from Red Pawn exhausted, Rand got an offer for her new play from Al Woods, who had produced The Trial of Mary Dugan for Broadway. The contract included a condition that Woods could make changes to the script. Wary that he would destroy her vision of the play to create a more conventional drama, Rand turned Woods down.|$|E

Patients were followed until the earlier of the following: end of enrollment, inpatient death, or December 31, 2012. Study cohorts were women ± <b>HER</b> 2 -targeted <b>agent</b> use, <b>HER</b> 2 -targeted <b>agent</b> users&# 39; subgroups of stages III and IV, and age group. Pre- and postindex breast cancer treatments were compared among study cohorts. Overall survival was compared using log-rank tests. Cox proportional-hazards models {{were used to}} study the predictors of overall survival. Results: Of 30, 660 eligible women, 14. 4 % received <b>HER</b> 2 -targeted <b>agents.</b> <b>HER</b> 2 -targeted <b>agent</b> users received more aggressive pre- and postindex cancer treatments compared to those with no <b>HER</b> 2 -targeted <b>agents.</b> <b>HER</b> 2 -targeted <b>agents</b> had higher rates of pre- and postindex breast cancer surgery, adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and biologics-based therapy. Among <b>HER</b> 2 -targeted <b>agent</b> users, younger women and those with stage III breast cancer received more aggressive treatments. After adjusting for clinically relevant patient characteristics, women receiving <b>HER</b> 2 -targeted <b>agents</b> had a 20 % reduced risk of death compared to patients not receiving <b>HER</b> 2 -targeted <b>agents.</b> Among all patients and the subset of <b>HER</b> 2 -targeted <b>agent</b> users, stage IV patients {{and those in the}} oldest age group had a higher risk of death. Conclusion: Among patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer, receipt of <b>HER</b> 2 -targeted <b>agents</b> was associated with more aggressive treatment and longer survival. Patients with higher stage breast cancer and older patients received less aggressive therapies and had a higher risk of death.

25|$|Following {{a hearing}} on 7 and 8 September 2016, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) panel found that Sharapova had a reduced {{perception}} of the risk that she took while using Mildronate, because (a) she had used Mildronate for around ten years without any anti-doping issue, (b) she had consulted the Russian doctor who prescribed the Mildronate for medical reasons, not to enhance her performance, and (c) she had received no specific warning about the change in status of meldonium from WADA, the ITF, or the WTA. However, the CAS panel also noted Sharapova’s failure to disclose her use of meldonium on her doping control forms {{and that she was}} at fault for (a) failing to give <b>her</b> <b>agent</b> adequate instructions as to how to carry out the important task of checking the Prohibited List, and (b) failing to supervise and control the actions of <b>her</b> <b>agent</b> in carrying out that task (specifically the lack of any procedure for reporting or follow-up verification to make sure that <b>her</b> <b>agent</b> had actually discharged his duty).|$|E
