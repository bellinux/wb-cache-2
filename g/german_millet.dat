5000|$|Foxtail millet ( [...] ; botanic name Setaria italica, synonym Panicum italicum L.) is {{an annual}} grass grown for human food. It is the second-most widely planted species of millet, {{and the most}} {{important}} in East Asia. It has the longest history of cultivation among the millets, having been grown in India since antiquity. According to recent research, it was first domesticated in China around 6,000 BC. Other names for the species include dwarf setaria, foxtail bristle-grass, giant setaria, green foxtail, Italian millet, <b>German</b> <b>millet,</b> and Hungarian millet.|$|E
40|$|When corn {{or other}} crops fail to grow {{on account of}} {{defective}} seeds, cut worms or other causes; it is necessary frequently to plant something else as a substitute, which will ripen before frosts. But the list of crops which can be grown in Iowa as substitutes in suchcases, is very short. The millets, buck-wheat or beans, are used for such purposes generally; but they have proved failures much oftener than corn, oats, barley or clover. I have grown such crops frequently, not as substitutes for other crops; but because they were profitable. I intend to grow {{them in the future}} also, but I will be careful to select the best varieties for seed, and prepare the ground for them properly. Hungarian grass and, (the weed) Fox-tail, belong to the millet family. Last spring, we planted a large collection of millets which we procured from many different sources. They were billed to us as Hungarian grass, Common millet, <b>German.</b> <b>millet,</b> Pearl millet and Golden Wonder millet. When they were fully grown, the differences between the varieties proved to be great; but not greater than the differences between the plants which were grown from the seeds that were received in each of a considerable number of packages, which were labeled <b>German</b> <b>millet.</b> The seeds in a few of them were nearly pure or true to name; while the plants from the seeds of others showed from twenty-five to fifty variations between Fox-tail and <b>German</b> <b>millet.</b> The Pearl millet lacks vitality and proved a failure on our grounds last year and this year. The common millet is a week earlier than Hungarian grass and two weeks earlier than <b>German</b> <b>millet.</b> Its average heighth on good ground is from 31 / 2 to 4 feet, and its stalks are slender and liable to be blown down by storms. Its blades are very thin and narrow; it is smothered frequently in old fields by Fox-tail and other weeds, and it yields only about half as much hay per acre as <b>German</b> <b>millet.</b> The principal distinctions between Hungarian grass and common millet are, that the former is later and larger than the latter. Neither of them are profitable crops, except on rich, clean ground. The average heighth of <b>German</b> <b>millet</b> is about four feet. Its stalks are so large and strong, that it stands up much better during rain storms than wheat, oats or oarley. Its blades are long, very thick and from 3 / 4 to 1 inch in width. It produces from three to four tons of nutritious hay per acre usually on good ground, and the chinch bugs let it alone; while they are extremely fond of the smaller and earlier varieties. As it is the best of the annual grasses I saved a peck of seeds from carefully selected stalks, to which I expect to add improvements by similar selections of seeds in the future...|$|E
40|$|Stromatal fruiting {{bodies of}} Cordyceps cardinalis were {{successfully}} produced in cereals. Brown rice, <b>German</b> <b>millet</b> and stan-dard millet produced the longest-length of stromata, followed by Chinese pearl barley, Indian millet, black rice and standard barley. Oatmeal produced the shortest-length of fruiting bodies. Supplementation of pupa and larva to the grains {{resulted in a}} slightly enhanced production of fruiting bodies; pupa showing better production than larva. 50 ~ 60 g of brown rice and 10 ~ 20 g of pupa mixed with 50 ~ 60 mL of water in 1, 000 mL polypropylene (PP) bottle {{was found to be}} optimum for fruiting body production. Liquid inoculation of 15 ~ 20 mL per PP bottle produced best fruiting bodies. The optimal temperature for the formation of fruiting bodies was 25 ºC, under conditions of continuous light. Few fruiting bodies were produced under the condition of complete darkness, and the fresh weight was considerable low, compared to that of light condition...|$|E
40|$|About seventy-live {{kinds of}} grasses and {{other forage plants}} were sown last spring. A {{considerable}} number of these were in one-eighth-acre plots, with a thin seeding of rye for protection. The rye {{proved to be the}} winter, instead of the spring variety, as was intended, and it grew so rank as to cover the ground and greatly injure the grasses. It was cut and removed July 7, but the weather following was so hot and dry that some of the kinds failed to recover. In addition to this, a severe attack of chinch bugs occurred in the* latter part of July and nearly destroyed many of the other kinds. Only the true grasses were attacked. The coarser kinds of these, such as Johnson grass, sorghum, teosinte, and the pearl and <b>German</b> <b>millets,</b> suffered least...|$|R

40|$|Foxtail millet (Setaria italica L. Beauv.) {{commonly}} known as ‘Kaon ’ is an important minor cereal crops in Bangladesh. It {{is also known as}} Italian millet or <b>German</b> <b>millet</b> which was originated in North China where it was an important cereal till the introduction of wheat and Lorelei (FAO, 1985). In Bangladesh, it can be grown in both rabi and kharif seasons, but it grows better in rabi season. Although low yielding, its short duration and drought tolerance along with low-input requirements ensure its bright prospects under the existing rainfed farmers cropping system (Mannujan et al., 1990). Foxtail millet, a drought resistant, M. H. RASHID 2, Q. A. RAHMAN 4 AND M. H.

40|$|According to {{the growth}} of the {{chickens}} up to the matured domestic fowls the vicissitude of the intestinal flora is observed investigating of the each period. The chickens are usually bred in the breeding box but occasionally they are put to grass outside the box. And they are always given the difinite foods, that is, water, grass and the mixed food, which consists of barley, wheat, corn, <b>German</b> <b>millet</b> and powder or fishes in a certain percentage. Fourty-three chickens in total are investigated during the various seasons in this experiment, and it gives us the following results; (I) Aerobic Culture: In the mammals the specific strain of the bacteria becomes predominant in the intestinal flora during some periods of their growth, however, in the domestic fowl it is different from that, i. e., throughout their lifetime the predominant bacteria in the intestinal flora is always the group of bac. coli or enterococci, although there might be a slight fluctuation in the balance between both groups. (1) Young, Period. I. (within one week after being hatched) I>C>E>B Young Period II. (till the first month) I>E>C>B (2) Middle Period(till the fourth month) E>C>B 3) Matured Period(over four months) B>E>C The keys of the table: I; the number of the cases in which the superiority of the coli or enterococci groups is inconstant and daily changeable. E; the number of the cases in which the enterococci group is predominant. C; the number of the cases in which the group of bac. coli is predominant. B; both groups maintain the balance of power. Leaving out these both groups of bac. coli and enterococci, however, some tiny colonies are frequently isolated from the feces. These are usually not recognized in the culture from the meconium, but from the feces defecated after the fifth to sixth day of the age at earliest. These tiny colonies are consists of many different organism, but most of them have an anerobic character. And a half to two third of the numbers of the colonies isolated belong to the group of bac. acidophilus. (II) Anaerobic Culture: The obligate anaerobic bacteria are scarcely proved in the culture from the feces defecated within two to three days after being hatched, but they become,to be isolated gradually in those defecated after the fifth day. But the isolated strains are variable in species, and they are far less in number than the facultative anaerobic bacteria, such as the groups of bac. coli, enterococci or bac. acidophilus. Therefore {{it is a matter of}} difficulity to find out their significance as the main intestinal bacteria. Bac. Welchii, the analogous bacilli of bac. torutuosus and bac. pelton, the other bacterioides and several Gram positive micrococci etc. are also sometimes isolated from the culture, but it is irregular in appearance. (III) Conclusion: In the domestic fowls, which are fed with the same food and grown up in the same circumstances, they do not appear to develop any characteristic feature of the intestinal flora according to the different periods of their ages being differ from that in the mammals. There is also no special correlation of the intestinal flora with the seasons. In other words it is assumed that the animals fed with the same food in the similar condition since their birth will keep the relatively similar intestinal flora...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} between millet and European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hu¨ bner), was investigated to {{gain insight into}} whether millet {{could serve as a}} refuge or trap crop for O. nubilalis management. In 1995, 1996, and 1999, millet selection studies were conducted in North Dakota and New York with four millet species. Proso millet, Panicum milliaceum L., had the highest infestation and widest distribution of O. nubilalis developmental stages, indicating the presence of both univoltine and bivoltine ecotypes. Siberian foxtail millet, Setaria italica (L.) Beauvois, harbored the greatest number of adults, followed by <b>German</b> foxtail <b>millet,</b> Setaria italica (L.) Beauvois. These two millets appeared to serve as better aggregation sites than proso millet. In North Dakota in 1997, proso millet planting date studies showed later planting dates were more heavily infested than earlier dates; in 1998, thistrend wasrevers ed. The change in trendsbetween yearswasprobably a result of differencesin the respective growing seasons and subsequent differences in O. nubilalis ßights. Adult sampling showed that both old and young females aggregated in proso millet during the day; however, at night, it appeared that young femalesmoved out of millet to oviposit, whereasold femalesremained in millet. Egg masses were detected in proso millet over a 7 -d period in 1997 and a 4 -d period in 1998. Larval sampling showed planting proso millet between late May and mid-June may maximize the presence of individualsfrom both O. nubilalis ecotypes. Once the optimal combination of planting date, plant density, and millet type is found, millet may serve as an effective refuge or trap crop for O. nubilalis management...|$|R
40|$|Ground cover {{management}} systems affect soil quality {{and health and}} thereby orchard growth and productivity. There have been few studies in the southern US {{on the effects of}} managed drive-rows using cover crops as part of a sustainable apple orchard management system. A field study used treatments of 1) seasonal legumes (cowpea [Vigna unguiculata] and crimson clover [Trifolium incarnatum]), 2) seasonal grasses (millet [Setaria italic] and annual rye [Lolium multiflorum]), or 3) unmanaged natural vegetation drive row plantings, with mowed vegetation blown into the tree row as mulch (mow/blow) nested variable. The legume crop cycles produced {{more than twice as much}} cover crop tissue N than grasses or natural vegetation. Soils with legume mulches produced the highest labile N compared to other treatments, and the highest labile N where legumes were mulched to the tree-row with a mow/blow treatment. There was a smaller labile pool C/N ratio for legume treatments and for tree row compared to drive row samples, and the largest N concentration for soils in the tree row with legumes as a mow/blow mulch. After two seasons the labile pool C/N ratio was lower for legumes than other treatments. Tree foliage, had highest N content for the legume treatments. These results indicate that legume cover crop mow/blow {{management systems}} may offer a N benefit and be a potential sustainable alternative for orchard management. A greenhouse study was also conducted, pairing the cover crop species of the field study with potted apple trees to examine the effects of both cover crop competition and mulches on tree growth and nutrient status. Apple trees in inert media were grown with and without cover crop competition, and cover crops were cut and mulched to the media surface. Cowpeas and <b>German</b> foxtail <b>millet</b> were studied. Legume cover crops generated more biomass per plant, higher % and total N, and total C. Trees grown in competition with cover crops grew less than those without, and did not recover after cover crop harvest within the duration of the study. Trees with neither mulch nor competition grew better than either competition treatment...|$|R
