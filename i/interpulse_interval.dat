Ten pre-trained test men with normal vision, aged 18 – 20 participated in the experiment. Testees were showed subsequent paired light pulses at a 200 ms interval, divided by initial <b>interpulse</b> <b>interval</b> of 70 ms, recurring at the fixed time interval of 1 s. Testees determined the threshold <b>interpulse</b> <b>interval,</b> at which the two pulses in a pair merged into one, three times, using the method of successive approximation. Then testees solved algebraic equations with several unknowns for two hours. The threshold <b>interpulse</b> <b>interval</b> was determined three times every 20 minutes {{in the course of}} equations solving. The degree of mental fatigue DMF was calculated, using the formula: DMFi = (TPIi – TPI 0) 100 % / TPIi; i = 1, 2, …, n, where DMFi is the degree of mental fatigue at the i-th measurement; TPIi is average arithmetic duration of threshold <b>interpulse</b> <b>interval</b> at the i-th measurement; TPI 0 is average arithmetic duration of threshold <b>interpulse</b> <b>interval</b> before algebraic equations solving; n is the dimension of threshold <b>interpulse</b> <b>interval</b> measurement in the course of algebraic equations solving. After 20 minutes of work, the degree of mental fatigue of one of the testees was 9. 5 %, rose to 21 % {{by the end of the}} first hour and exceeded 39 % by the end of the second hour. Similar dynamics of mental fatigue was observed in all testees, but its development and the degree of fatigue are individual. To prevent fatigue and ensure high level of efficiency one should set the individual schedule and rest pauses duration during mental activity...|$|E

40|$|Statistical {{characteristics}} of background firing in the midbrain auditory units of grass frog (Rana t. temporaria) located in torus semicircular (TS) were investigated. Only about 5 % {{of the cells}} demonstrated prominent spontaneous firing. For such units the following characteristics were obtained: the distribution of <b>interpulse</b> <b>intervals,</b> the autocorrelation functions (ACF) for the real firing process and for the process with shuffled intervals, the hazard function (HF) and the joint distribution of adjacent <b>interpulse</b> <b>intervals.</b> The burstiness of firing was also estimated. In the absolute majority of the cells, the background firing demonstrated considerable deviation from the renewal process. There was weak but significant positive correlation between adjacent <b>interpulse</b> <b>intervals.</b> The burstiness of firing in the midbrain auditory units was moderate but higher than reported for medullary auditory neurons. The value of burstiness did not decrease after interval shuffling. Along with the reduction in excitability (generalized refractoriness) in many neurons observed post-spike facilitation effects were observed.

It transmitted signals adequate for fine frequency analysis within a range of approximately 3 m. Telemetry permitted the recording of constant-frequency pulses free from flight-induced Doppler shifts and without time delays. The difference in frequency between telemetered signals and the same signals detected by a remote microphone was used to calculate velocity and Doppler shifts. Pulse emission behavior of Pteronotus parnelliiin flight was compared with simulated fl ight on a pendulum. The data showed significant differences in echo bandwidths, constant-frequency pulse durations and <b>interpulse</b> <b>intervals.</b> In flight, pulses and <b>interpulse</b> <b>intervals</b> tended to be shorter and bats maintained echo frequencies within a significantly narrower band. Phases of echolocation that characterized the approach to a target were clearly evident in flight, but not during pendulum swings. Differences in pulse durations and <b>interpulse</b> <b>intervals</b> may be correlated with the integration of wingbeat, respiration and vocalization.

40|$|Courtship {{behaviours}} {{may provide}} a more reliable means of identifying reproduc-tively isolated taxa than traits such as morphology or many genetic markers. Here we describe the courtship songs of the Drosophila willistoni sibling species group, which consists of several species and subspecies. We find that song pattern is species-specific, despite significant differences among strains within species. D. paulistorum has the most variable song pattern, which reflects this species ’ traditional subdivision into semispecies. All the other species could be unambiguously identified by song. The major differences among these species was in the <b>interpulse</b> <b>interval,</b> as {{has been found in}} other studies of fly song. However, the interpulse intervals of the species studied here were often multimodal. This was partly due to the presence of multiple song types within the courtship repertoire, but it also reflected changes in <b>interpulse</b> <b>interval</b> within a song type by some males. Unusually, some species had distinctively patterned variation in <b>interpulse</b> <b>interval.</b> Song must have evolved rapidly within the species complex, probably due to sexual selection...|$|E
40|$|The {{inhibition}} of CA 1 pyramidal neurones in rat hippocampal slices was studied using extracellular recordings of population spike potential responses to paired orthodromic stimulation. Variation of the <b>interpulse</b> <b>interval</b> allowed {{the separation of}} an early phase of inhibition (<b>interpulse</b> <b>interval</b> 5 – 20 ms), blocked by the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline (1 ?M; n = 11), and a late phase (<b>interpulse</b> <b>interval</b> 200 – 400 ms) blocked by the GABAB receptor antagonist phaclofen (1 mM; n = 5) but enhanced by bicuculline (n = 11). Similar enhancement was not observed when conditioning response amplitudes were increased by increasing the stimulus strength, rather than bicuculline. Orthodromic stimulation leads to synaptic excitation of both pyramidal neurones and inhibitory interneurones, and may also lead to activation of inhibitory inputs onto interneurones. Bicuculline could prevent {{inhibition of}} the interneurones, and hence enhance the late, GABAB receptor-mediated inhibition. Conversely, the therapeutic administration of benzodiazepines would be postulated to enhance the inhibition of inhibitory interneurones, leading to an iatrogenic decrease in GABAB receptor-mediated inhibition...|$|E
40|$|Summary. Pregnant (N = 10) and {{non-pregnant}} (N = 10) ewes were bled every 2 h from Days 12 to 17 after oestrus (oestrus = Day 0). Plasma {{concentrations of}} pro-gesterone, 15 -keto- 13, 14 -dihydro-PGF- 2 =a and 11 -ketotetranor-PGF metabolites were determined in all samples. The number of PGF- 2 =a pulses in non-pregnant ewes was 8 =. =+-=. (mean =+-. e. m.) with an <b>interpulse</b> <b>interval</b> of 10 =. =+-=. h. Two or 3 pulses of low frequency (<b>interpulse</b> <b>interval</b> = 13 =. =+-=. h) occurred in most non-pregnant ewes before {{the onset of}} luteolysis; the <b>interpulse</b> <b>interval</b> then decreased to 7 =. =+-=. h for the 6 =. =+-=. pulses temporally associated with luteolysis. In contrast, the number of PGF- 2 =a in pregnant ewes was lower (2 =. =+-=., 0 =n-) and the interpulse inter-vals longer (18 =. =+-=. h). Most pulses occurred on Days 14 and 15 in the pregnant and non-pregnant ewes. The mean concentrations of both PGF- 2 =a in non-pregnant ewes were highest on Day 15 while basal levels of both metabolites remained constant at all times.

40|$|Courtship {{vibratory}} signals can be air-borne or substrate-borne. They convey {{distinct and}} species-specific information from one individual to its prospective partner. Here, we study the substrate-borne vibratory signals {{generated by the}} abdominal quivers of the Drosophila male during courtship; these vibrations travel through the ground towards courted females and coincide with female immobility. It is not known which physical parameters of the vibrations encode the information that is received by the females and induces them to pause. We examined the intervals between each vibratory pulse, a feature that was reported to carry information for animal communication. We were unable to find evidence of periodic variations in the lengths of these intervals, as has been reported for fly acoustical signals. Because {{it was suggested that}} the genes involved in the circadian clock may also regulate shorter rhythms, we search for effects of period on the interval lengths. Males that are mutant for the period gene produced vibrations with significantly altered interpulse intervals; also, treating wild type males with constant light results in similar alterations to the <b>interpulse</b> <b>intervals.</b> Our results suggest that both the clock and light/dark cycles have input into the <b>interpulse</b> <b>intervals</b> of these vibrations. We wondered if we could alter the <b>interpulse</b> <b>intervals</b> by other means, and found that ambient temperature also had a strong effect. However, behavioural analysis suggests that only extreme ambient temperatures can affect the strong correlation between female immobility and substrate-borne vibrations...|$|R

A protocol consisting of addition and rate modulation of ten VR filaments that contain alpha motoneurones to the soleus muscle was adopted. EMG was measured using indwelling electrodes and forces were measured at the distal tendon using a strain transducer. EMG records obtained using this approach were similar in the time and frequency domains to those obtained during voluntary contractions. Force records obtained from {{stimulation of}} single VR filaments showed summation effects typical of irregular <b>interpulse</b> <b>intervals.</b> The overall relationship between integrated rectified EMG (IEMG) and mean force {{was found to be}} non-linear. At low and high stimulation levels, IEMG tended to increase proportionally more than mean force. In the intermediate stimulation region (i. e. producing forces between approximately 5 % and 88 % of the maximal tetanic force), the IEMG–mean force relationship was virtually linear.

40|$|Pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) {{secretion}} was {{studied in}} vitro using explants of the retrochiasmatic hypothalamus from prepubertal {{male and female}} rats. Leptin caused a dose-dependent reduction of the GnRH <b>interpulse</b> <b>interval</b> in both sexes. We studied the effects of cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) since this peptide was shown recently to mediate the anorectic effects of leptin in the hypothalamus. CART caused a reduction of the GnRH <b>interpulse</b> <b>interval.</b> This effect was prevented using an anti-CART antiserum which could partially overcome leptin stimulatory effects as well. Using hypothalamic explants from Zucker rats homozygous for the leptin receptor mutation (fa/fa), GnRH pulse frequency was not affected by leptin, while a significant acceleration {{was caused by the}} CART-peptide.

40|$|The {{pitch of}} stimuli was studied under {{conditions}} where place-of-excitation was held constant, and where pitch was therefore derived from "purely temporal" cues. In experiment 1, the acoustical and electrical pulse trains consisted of pulses whose amplitudes alternated between a high {{and a low}} value, and whose <b>interpulse</b> <b>intervals</b> alternated between 4 and 6 ms. The attenuated pulses occurred after the 4 -ms intervals in condition A, and after the 6 -ms intervals in condition B. For both normal-hearing subjects and cochlear implantees, the period of an isochronous pulse train equal in pitch to this " 4 - 6 " stimulus increased from near 6 ms at the smallest modulation depth to nearly 10 ms at the largest depth. Additionally, the modulated pulse trains in condition A were perceived as being lower in pitch than those in condition B. Data are interpreted in terms of increased refractoriness in condition A, where the larger pulses are more closely followed by the smaller ones than in condition B. Consistent with this conclusion, the A-B difference was reduced at longer <b>interpulse</b> <b>intervals.</b> These findings provide a measure of supra-threshold effects of refractoriness on pitch perception, and increase our understanding of coding of temporal information in cochlear implant speech processing schemes. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{electrical}} activity of magnocellular neurosecretory cells (NSCs) is {{correlated with the}} release rates of neurohypophysial hormones. NSCs may control their secretory activity in a cooperative manner by changing their {{electrical activity}} in response {{to changes in the}} internal milieu. In the present study, we applied confocal Ca 2 + imaging to a sagittally hemisected rainbow trout brain to simultaneously monitor the neuronal activity of a number of NSCs. We found that NSCs in vitro showed synchronized pulsatile elevations of intracellular Ca 2 + levels at regular intervals. Double immunostaining of vasotocin (VT) and isotocin (IT) after the confocal imaging clarified that each of the VT and IT neuronal populations showed a distinct pattern of periodic Ca 2 + pulses. Simultaneous cell-attached patch recordings ensured that individual Ca 2 + pulses were associated with a phasic burst firing. Depolarizing stimuli by increasing the extracellular K+ concentration from 5 to 7 - 9 mM reversibly shortened the <b>interpulse</b> <b>intervals</b> in both VT and IT neurons. <b>Interpulse</b> <b>intervals</b> but not durations of pulses were shortened by hypo-osmotic stimuli and prolonged by hyperosmotic stimuli, consistent with the osmoregulatory function of teleost NSCs.

There is strong evidence that courtship calls are used by many fishes to locate mates, coordinate spawning, and for species recognition, but the possibility that these calls also act as honest signals is not yet highly explored. Calls produced by the male round goby, Neogobius melanostomus, were analyzed for dominant frequency, <b>interpulse</b> <b>interval,</b> duration and number of pulses in the call.

40|$|Leptin may {{act as a}} {{negative}} feedback signal to the brain in the control of appetite through suppression of neuropeptide Y (NPY) secretion and stimulation of cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), a new anorectic peptide. We aimed at studying whether leptin, NPY, and CART have related effects on the hypothalamic control of the pituitary-gonadal system and the developmental changes in NPY and CART effects. Using retrochiasmatic hypothalamic explants from prepubertal 15 -day-old male rats, the GnRH <b>interpulse</b> <b>interval</b> (mean +/- SD: 62 +/- 5 min) was significantly reduced by 10 (- 7) M of leptin (46 +/- 3. 3 min) as well as 10 (- 7) M of NPY (47 +/- 4. 4 min) and 10 (- 6) M of CART (46 +/- 2. 7 min), whereas the GnRH pulse amplitude was not affected. The stimulatory effects of different NPY receptor agonists [human PYY 3 - 36, porcine NPY 13 - 36, human (D-Trp 32) NPY, porcine (Leu 31 Pro 34) NPY, human pancreatic polypeptide (PP) ], {{as well as the}} absent effects of rat PP were consistent with the involvement of the Y 5 -receptor subtype in mediation of NPY effects. Incubation with 10 (- 7) M of a Y 5 -receptor selective antagonist prevented the effect of NPY (61 +/- 4 vs. 46 +/- 2 min), whereas leptin and CART effects were not (47 +/- 3 vs. 46 +/- 3 min and 46 +/- 3 vs. 46 +/- 2 min, respectively), suggesting that NPY was not involved in leptin and CART effects. Using an anti-CART antiserum (1 : 1000), the reduction of GnRH <b>interpulse</b> <b>interval</b> caused by leptin was partially prevented (56. 2 +/- 4 vs. 47. 9 +/- 3. 8 min), whereas the reduction of GnRH interval caused by NPY was not affected (45. 9 +/- 2. 5 vs. 47. 8 +/- 3. 7). The GnRH <b>interpulse</b> <b>interval</b> was decreased by 10 (- 7) M of NPY at 5 days (72 +/- 3. 8 vs. 91. 9 +/- 3. 5) as well as at 15 days, whereas such an effect was not observed anymore at 25 and 50 days. Similar effects were observed using 10 (- 6) M of CART-peptide. Using 10 (- 6) M of the Y 5 -receptor antagonist, the GnRH <b>interpulse</b> <b>interval</b> was significantly increased at 15 days (66. 6 +/- 2. 7 min), 25 days (56. 5 +/- 39. 9 min), and 50 days (52. 5 vs. 38. 2 min), whereas no change was observed at 5 days. Using the anti-CART antiserum, a significant increase of GnRH <b>interpulse</b> <b>interval</b> was observed at 25 days only. In conclusion, the stimulatory effects of leptin and NPY on the frequency of pulsatile GnRH secretion before puberty involve two distinct mechanisms. NPY causes acceleration of GnRH pulsatility via the Y 5 -receptor subtype, which is not involved in leptin effects while the CART is involved in leptin effects on GnRH secretion but not in NPY effects. The reduction of pulsatility by the Y 5 antagonist provides evidence of endogenous NPY involvement in the control of GnRH secretion from the time of onset of puberty. Peer reviewe...|$|E

The {{aim of the}} present study was to determine whether prolongation of only the first <b>interpulse</b> <b>interval</b> (IPI) resulted in tetanic depression. The experiments were carried out on fast MUs of the medial gastrocnemius muscle in cats and rats.

For cats, the mean values of force depression amounted to 28. 64 % for FR and 10. 86 % for FF MUs whereas for rats 9. 30 and 7. 21 % for FR and FF motor units, respectively.

40|$|Abstract—In this study, {{we examine}} the {{characteristics}} of electric field pulse trains that are attributed to preliminary breakdown in negative cloud-to-ground lightning discharges and compare them to those of similar pulse trains associated with attempted cloud-to-ground leaders. The data were acquired in 2006 in Gainesville, Florida. The largest pulses in the train can exceed in magnitude the following first return-stroke pulse. The arithmetic mean pulse duration and <b>interpulse</b> <b>interval</b> for pulse trains in negative cloud-to-ground discharges are 4. 8 and 65 µs, respectively. The arithmetic mean pulse duration and <b>interpulse</b> <b>interval</b> for pulse trains in attempted cloud-to-ground leaders are 17 and 73 µs, respectively. This implies that pulse trains in ground discharges contain a larger fraction of “narrow” pulses (apparently disregarded in previous studies), defined here as those with durations equal to or less than 4 µs, than the pulse trains in attempted cloud-to-ground leaders. Submicrosecond-scale pulses are observed as part of pulse trains associated with cloud-to-ground discharges, but not with attempted leaders. We also examine the occurrence of pulses of different duration and amplitude {{in different parts of}} the preliminary breakdown pulse train of ground discharges.

The prefield uniform distribution of the receptors became asymmetrical, and was polarized toward the cathodal pole, {{in the same way as}} in DC fields. The extent of asymmetry depended on the duration of field exposure, pulse width (or alternatively, <b>interpulse</b> <b>interval),</b> frequency, and intensity. This relationship was most conveniently expressed by using duty cycle, a quantity determined by both pulse width and frequency. Pulses of average intensity 1. 5 V/cm induced detectable asymmetry within 5 min. At the lowest average field intensity used, 0. 8 V/cm, significant asymmetry was detected at 150 min. For pulses of high duty cycle (greater than 25 %), steady state was reached after 30 min exposure and the steady state asymmetry was dependent on average field intensity. For low duty cycle fields, the time required to reach steady state was prolonged (greater than 50 min). Before reaching a steady state, effectiveness of the pulses, as compared with DC fields of equivalent intensity, was a function of duty cycle.

Pressure pulses of InsP 3 were delivered into the cell with various <b>interpulse</b> <b>intervals.</b> The desensitization of {{the response to the}} second injection of each pair approached totality at 200 ms, which is the duration of the response to a single pressure pulse of InsP 3. Lowering extracellular calcium did not affect the time-course of the desensitization. Lowering the temperature slowed down both the time-course of the response to InsP 3 and the time-course of the desensitization to the same extent. These findings suggest that the desensitization is powerful enough and its onset fast enough to contribute to the transience of the InsP 3 response. The time-course of the desensitization suggests it may influence light adaptation...|$|R
40|$|Neurostimulation is a {{promising}} treatment for refractory epilepsy. We studied {{the effect of}} cortical stimulation with different parameters in the rat motor cortex stimulation model. High intensity simulation (threshold for motor response - 100 mu A), high frequency (130 Hz) stimulation during 1 h decreased cortical excitability, irrespective of the <b>interpulse</b> <b>interval</b> used (fixed or Poisson distributed). Low intensity (10 mu A) and/or low frequency (5 Hz) stimulation had no effect. Cortical stimulation appears promising {{for the treatment of}} neocortical epilepsy if frequency and intensity are high enough...|$|E
40|$|A differential, time-invariant, surface {{electromyogram}} (sEMG) {{model has}} been implemented. While {{it is based on}} existing EMG models, the novelty of this implementation is that it assigns more accurate distributions of variables to create realistic motor unit (MU) characteristics. Variables such as muscle fibre conduction velocity, jitter (the change in the <b>interpulse</b> <b>interval</b> between subsequent action potential firings) and motor unit size have been considered to follow normal distributions about an experimentally obtained mean. In addition, motor unit firing frequencies have been considered to have non-linear and type based distributions that are in accordance with experimental results. Motor unit recruitment thresholds have been considered {{to be related to the}} MU type...|$|E
40|$|A versatile, {{microprocessor-based}} stimulator for {{skeletal muscle}} cardiac assist (SMCA) has been designed, constructed, {{and used in}} several studies, The stimulator uses multiple bipolar electrodes to deliver arbitrarily specified electrical stimulus sequences to three nerve branches of the latissimus dorsi muscle, The electrodes are electrically isolated to effect regional stimulation of the muscle, The width, amplitude, and <b>interpulse</b> <b>interval</b> of each pulse in the stimulus sequence are independently variable, and the three channels are independently programmable, allowing {{a wide variety of}} stimulus patterns, Battery powered units have been used in studies for up to one year, In this paper, the stimulator and sample applications in SMCA are described...|$|E
40|$|Spontaneous {{electrical}} activity recorded from solitary Tubularia solitaria Warren consisted of long bursts of potentials regularly alternating with series of short bursts. Hydranth pulse (HP) systems in isolated hydranths produce a pulse pattern {{similar to that}} in intact animals though at a much lower frequency. Stalk pulse (SP) systems in isolated stalks produced extremely regular bursts of pulses resembling bursting patterns in molluscan single neurones. The bursts were associated with strong bending movements. In contrast with hierarchies in other hydroids, T. soUtaria's HP system dominates the SP system. Excised parts of the stalk produced bursting patterns. Interburst- and <b>interpulse</b> <b>intervals</b> were longer in these parts than in the whole stalk. Numbers of pulses per burst and overall pulse frequency were highest in the most distal part of the stalk, and lowest in the most proximal part...|$|R
40|$|Carlyon et al. (J Acoust Soc Am 112 : 621 - 33, 2002) {{found that}} a pulse train with {{alternating}} inter-pulse intervals between 4 and 6 ms (“ 4 - 6 stimulus”) is perceived as having a periodicity of 5. 7 ms. Using a model that relies on neuronal first order intervals (FOIs) for pitch perception, they showed that {{the recovery of the}} auditory nerve from adaptation is not sufficient to explain this effect and suggested that a weighting function that favours longer FOI intervals was needed to account for the perceived pitch. Here we investigate whether there are neurons, or populations of neurons, at the next stage of processing, the cochlear nucleus (CN), that give greater representation to longer intervals. We measured the responses of single neurons in the ventral CN of anesthetised guinea pigs to isochronous and anisochronous pulse trains. Pulse trains were band-pass filtered between 3900 Hz and 5300 Hz. Isochronous pulse trains had <b>interpulse</b> <b>intervals</b> of 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 ms. Anisochronous pulse trains had alternating <b>interpulse</b> <b>intervals</b> between 4 and 6 ms. The results are based on the responses of 58 units, classified by the shape of their post stimulus time histograms as Primary with notch (PN, 9), transient chopper (CT, 22), sustained chopper (CS, 10) and onsets (ON, 17). PN and CT units showed a recovery behaviour that is quantitatively similar to the auditory nerve. ON and CS units showed a faster recovery between 4 and 6 ms, but not enough to account for the size of the psychophysical effect. The average of FOI distributions for single units generally has too many long intervals to account for the observed pitch of the 4 - 6 stimulus. When sequentially interleaving the spikes from all units the average FOI distribution contains more shorter intervals, but, by interleaving spikes from just 2 to 4 units the average FOI becomes small enough to explain the observed pitch of the 4 - 6 stimulus. The location of units that may participate in such an analysis remains obscure...|$|R
40|$|Paralysed muscle, or {{skeletal}} muscle {{which is to}} be used for cardiac assistance, may be given an artificial function if it is electrically stimulated to contract and the response can be adequately controlled. To design a controller, a model of the muscle or system is usually required. The most commonly used models are analogues, originating from A. V. Hill's model. However muscles exhibit many nonlinear and time-varying phenomena which, {{if they are to be}} modelled, make the analogue complex and cumbrous to work with. The system may further be complicated by pathological changes and secondary effects of stimulation. We propose that such a system can be modelled by nonlinear networks ('neural networks'). The radial basis function network (RBF) has two advantages over the better-known multi-layer perceptron (MLP). We describe the use of an RBF network to model rabbit muscle that is supramaximally stimulated at irregular <b>interpulse</b> <b>intervals...</b>|$|R
