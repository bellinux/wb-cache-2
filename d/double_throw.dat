25|$|The dealer throws three dice in {{the square}} wall and sums up the total. Counting {{anti-clockwise}} so that the dealer is 1 (or 5, 9, 13, 17), so that south (player to the right) is 2 (or 6, 10, 14, 18), etc., a player's quarter of the wall is chosen. Some house rules may use only two dice but have <b>double</b> <b>throws</b> to increase randomness. In the case of <b>double</b> <b>throws,</b> the player of the chosen wall makes the second throw.|$|R

5000|$|A {{minimum of}} two [...] "3-way" [...] (SPDT - single pole, <b>double</b> <b>throw)</b> {{switches}} are needed in a multiway switch setup. Each 3-way switch has a single dark-colored [...] "common" [...] terminal, and two gold-colored [...] "traveler" [...] terminals.|$|E
5000|$|In {{building}} wiring, multiway switching is the interconnection {{of two or}} more electrical {{switches to}} control an electrical load (often, but not always, lighting) from more than one location. For example, this allows lighting in a hallway, stairwell or large room to be controlled from multiple locations.While a [...] "normal" [...] light switch needs to be only a single pole, single throw (SPST) switch, multiway switching requires the use of switches that have one or more additional contacts and two or more wires must be run between the switches. When the load is controlled from only two points, single pole, <b>double</b> <b>throw</b> (SPDT) switches are used. Double pole, <b>double</b> <b>throw</b> (DPDT) switches allow control from three or more locations.|$|E
50|$|When {{more than}} one common {{terminal}} is used, the number of poles increases. Figure 1C shows a double-pole, single-throw (DPST) switch. Both poles are actuated simultaneously when the relay is energized. In this case, both poles are either always closed or always open. Figure 1D illustrates a double-pole, <b>double</b> <b>throw</b> (DPDT) switch.|$|E

5000|$|Electrically, {{a typical}} [...] "3-way" [...] switch {{is a single}} pole, <b>double</b> <b>throw</b> (SPDT) switch. By {{correctly}} connecting two of these switches together, toggling either switch changes {{the state of the}} load from off to on, or vice versa. The switches may be arranged so that they are in the same orientation for off, and contrasting orientations for on.|$|E
5000|$|The Eudelin was a French {{automobile}} manufactured {{from around}} 1905 until 1908. The {{product of a}} Parisian builder, it came in 14/16hp and 25/40 four-cylinder models. The company also produced an opposed-piston engine with a complex variable-stroke linkage. The original power unit {{was described as a}} [...] "double piston engine with a single <b>double</b> <b>throw</b> crank directly below the combustion chamber".|$|E
50|$|Flange-mounted steel barrels were {{bolted to}} the {{crankcase}} and enclosed with cast aluminium alloy, screwed-on, cylinder heads with integral cooling fins. The pistons were also made of aluminium alloy and had floating gudgeon pins. The fourteen pistons drove the <b>double</b> <b>throw</b> crankshaft via two channel-section master rods and twelve circular section auxiliary rods. The master rod had an integral, split type big-end. The crankshaft was machined from a single forging, with bolt-on balance weights.|$|E
60|$|The already {{retreating}} Dervishes, {{encouraged by}} the arrival of Ed Din's division, returned to the attack. The 11th Soudanese swung round, to aid the 9th in their struggle with Ed Din's troops. The charges of the Dervishes were impetuous in the extreme. Regardless of the storm of shell and bullets they rushed on, and would have thrust themselves between the 9th and 11th, had not the 2nd Egyptians, wheeling at the <b>double,</b> <b>thrown</b> themselves into the gap.|$|R
25|$|Using {{the same}} total on the dice (or {{the total of}} the two throws), the player whose wall is chosen then counts the stacks of tiles from right to left. (For <b>double</b> <b>throws,</b> the count may extend {{to the left side}} player's stack.) This determines the {{location}} where the 'deck' of tiles is cut. Starting from the left of the stacks counted, the dealer draws four tiles for himself, and players in anti-clockwise order draw blocks of four tiles until all players have 12 tiles, so that the stacks decrease clockwise. Each player then draws one last tile to make a 13-tile hand.|$|R

5000|$|A [...] "4-way" [...] (intermediate) switch is {{a purpose}} built double pole, <b>double</b> <b>throw</b> (DPDT) switch, {{internally}} wired in manufacture {{to reverse the}} connections between the input and output and having only four external terminals. This switch has two pairs of [...] "traveler" [...] terminals that it connects either straight through, or crossed over (transposed, or swapped). An intermediate switch can, however, be implemented by adding appropriate external wiring to an ordinary (six terminal) DPDT switch, or by using a separate DPDT relay.|$|E
5000|$|The carrier, {{which is}} AC, {{at a given}} time, makes one pair of diodes conduct, and reverse-biases the other pair. The {{conducting}} pair carry the signal from the left transformer secondary to the primary of the transformer at the right.If the left carrier terminal is positive, {{the top and bottom}} diodes conduct. If that terminal is negative, then the [...] "side" [...] diodes conduct, but create a polarity inversion between the transformers. This action is much like that of a DPDT (double pole, <b>double</b> <b>throw)</b> switch wired for reversing connections. (See also Integrated circuit methods of ring modulation) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Schmitt trigger {{is based}} on the dynamic threshold idea that is implemented by a voltage divider with a switchable upper leg (the collector resistors RC1 and RC2) and a steady lower leg (RE). Q1 acts as a comparator with a differential input (Q1 base-emitter junction) consisting of an inverting (Q1 base) and a non-inverting (Q1 emitter) inputs. The input voltage is applied to the inverting input; the output voltage of the voltage divider is applied to the non-inverting input thus determining its threshold. The comparator output drives the second common collector stage Q2 (an emitter follower) through the voltage divider R1-R2. The emitter-coupled transistors Q1 and Q2 actually compose an electronic <b>double</b> <b>throw</b> switch that switches over the upper legs of the voltage divider and changes the threshold in a different (to the input voltage) direction.|$|E
5000|$|Opportunity cards (taken from a shuffled pile) are gained {{on a roll}} of 3, 7 or 11 (not {{counting}} rerolls due to <b>double</b> <b>throws).</b> These {{present the}} player with additional opportunities for escape. Some cards allow [...] "free" [...] equipment to be gained (without visiting the rooms required). Additional cards allow players {{to use one of}} the three tunnels shown on the map, hide escape equipment to avoid confiscation, steal the Staff Car, move to safe hideaways, escape solitary or avoid being shot during an escape attempt. Players may keep their opportunity cards secret or secretly show each other their hands in order to assist each other's escapes.|$|R

5000|$|A {{knife switch}} {{is a type}} of switch used to control the flow of {{electricity}} in a circuit. It is composed of a hinge which allows a metal lever, or knife, to be lifted from or inserted into a slot or jaw. The hinge and jaw are both fixed to an insulated base, and the knife has an insulated handle to grip at one end. Current flows through the switch when the knife is pushed into the jaw.Knife switches can take several forms, including single throw, in which the [...] "knife" [...] engages with only a single slot, and <b>double</b> <b>throw,</b> in which the knife hinge is placed between two slots and can engage with either one. Also, multiple knives may be attached to a single handle and can be used to activate more than one circuit simultaneously.|$|E
5000|$|The screw {{terminals}} are hollow and allow up {{to at least}} three 1 mm (CSA) wires, twisted together, to be inserted {{to a depth of}} up to 10 mm and secured with a set screw. The contact terminal set screws are installed at a slight angle to allow easier screwdriver access after the switch mechanism has been installed into a wall-plate - before fixing the wall-plate to the wall. Also shown is a “loop” connection terminal. This terminal plays no part in the action of the switch but, because there is available space, it is provided as an insulated terminal for joining other wires, if required (such as the neutral wires). Each Australian rocker switch mechanism is actually a Single Pole <b>Double</b> <b>Throw</b> (SPDT) Switch, also known as a [...] "two-way switch", and has three terminals.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{version of}} wallball {{is that the}} ball is catchable {{off the wall and}} the {{catching}} player can move about freely as long as they throw the ball within the next few seconds. If the ball bounces very far away from the wall the other players may call [...] "challenge" [...] to the player with the ball. A call of challenge means the player may not move and must throw the ball and try to hit the wall. If the player chooses to drop the ball at his/her feet then the player is automatically out. The thrower, however, may choose to simply throw it at an object that would cause the ball to be hard to get before the thrower can be thrown out, possibly causing a successive number of challenges until a suitable throw has been made. If a player catches the ball they may run to the wall and place both their off hand and foot on the wall and call [...] "bulldog." [...] If the player does this they can freely throw the ball at whomever they wish. If they hit another player then the hit player must touch the wall before they are thrown out. [...] "Bulldogs" [...] are usually frowned upon by other players and considered a cheap way of getting other players out. If a player has committed a double touch another player may call the foul and is allowed a throw at the person. The offending player must be [...] "spread eagle" [...] as it is called, against the wall and may not move. The thrower is not allow a full force throw unless the person moves or flinches as it is usually taken from a short distance. This can either result in a peg or a <b>double</b> <b>throw</b> depending on the rules. If the thrower makes a full force throw without the offender moving then the thrower must be pegged by the original offender. In some games the thrower on [...] "spread eagle" [...] must touch the wall or they too will be out, unless they missed and hit the wall.|$|E
5000|$|Waste spinning, reeling, <b>doubling</b> and <b>throwing</b> put little {{strain on}} the building, but power-looms were a {{different}} matter. From preference they were operated in single-storey sheds with saw-tooth north-facing roof windows: {{if they were to}} be operated on an upper-floor, box-beams and cast-iron columns increased the floor strength and load-bearing capacities.|$|R
30|$|Methods: A laparoscopic {{cervical}} cerclage was performed before pregnancy under general anesthesia. A 5 -mm Mersilene tape with straight needle in both {{end of the}} tape were used for {{cervical cerclage}}. First we dissected the bladder flap of peritoneum and exposed the uterine isthmus. At this part {{we can see the}} uterine artery in both side of the uterus. The needle pass through the uterine wall at the level of uterine isthmus just lateral in the uterine artery. The needle pass through the uterine wall in both side of the uterine isthmus from anterior to posterior. The tip of the needle come out just above the uterine- sacral ligament. Hysteroscopy examination was carried out to exclude the exposure of tape in the uterine canal when the tape was placed in position. The tape was than tied posteriorly with <b>double</b> <b>throws</b> of an intracorporeal knot after hysteroscopy examination.|$|R
