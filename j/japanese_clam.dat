Fractions showing a significant effect were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and proteins were identified by nano LC-MS/MS. 45 proteins were identified for V. aestuarianus and 87 for V. tapetis. Most of them belonged to outer membrane or were periplasmic, including porins or adhesins that were already described as virulence factors in other bacterial species. Others were transporter components, flagella proteins, or proteins of unknown function (14 and 15 respectively). Interestingly, for V. aestuarianus, we noted the secretion of 3 extracellular enzymes including the Vam metalloprotease and two other enzymes (one putative lipase and one protease). For V. tapetis, we identified five extracellular enymes, i. e. two different endochitinases, one protease, one lipase and an adhesin. A comparison of both secretomes also showed that only the putative extracellular lipase was common to both secretomes, underscoring the difference in pathogenicity mechanisms between these two species.

Experimental period was 7 days. Experimental groups consisted of control, 5, 10, 20 psu. LC 50 (96 h.) by the probit was 19. 55 psu. Mortality was {{significantly different from the}} control (p < 0. 05). Inner demibranch of the gill of C. japonica was wider 1. 37 times than outer demibranch (p < 0. 001). The filament zone on the plica can be distinguished by the six epithelial celll cell; frontal ciliated epithelium (7 μm), latero-frontal ciliated epithelium (5 μm), postlatero-frontal epithelim (3 x 8 μm), and lateral ciliated epithelium (5 μm) in the frontal zone, endothelial cellin the intermediate zone, and abfrontal cell in the abfrontal zone. It had one type of secretory cell that was filled with fibrous substances of low electron density. The gill of C. japonica exposed to 5 psu for 7 days was observed partially disappearance of the cilia, and glycogen granule in the filament.

40|$|IIn 2012, world mollusk {{production}} in aquaculture reached {{a volume of}} 15, 171, 000 tons, representing 23 % of total aquaculture production and positioning mollusks as {{the second most important}} category of aquaculture products (fishes are the first). Clams and oysters are the mollusk species with the highest production levels, followed in descending order by mussels, scallops and abalones. In view of the increasing importance attached to genetic information on aquaculture, which can help with good maintenance and thus the sustainability of production, the present work offers a review of the state of knowledge on genetic and genomic information about mollusks produced in aquaculture. The analysis was applied to mollusks which are of importance for aquaculture, with emphasis on the 5 species with the highest production levels. According to FAO, these are: <b>Japanese</b> <b>clam</b> Ruditapes philippinarum; Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas; Chilean mussel Mytilus chilensis; Blood clam Anadara granosa and Chinese clam Sinonovacula constricta.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of four copepod species (Lichomolgus inflatus, Modiolicola bifiba, Conchyliurus quintus and Ostrincola koe) in the <b>Japanese</b> <b>clam,</b> Tapes japonica, in Sasebo Bay is reported (Table 1). L. inflatus appears {{only from the}} end of April to June (Table 2). M. bifida is found throughout the year except in September and October (Table 3), though in smaller number as compared with two other species mentioned below. C. quintus always lives in a considerable number. In winter their copepodids seem to grow up slowly and spawn in March and April. The larvae produced presumably by these over-wintering individuals appear in May in a large number. Therefore, the percentage of infested clams by this copepod species and the numberof copepod individuals per host are the highest in May and June (Tables 1 and 4). On the contrary, the rate of infestation and the occurring number of individuals of O. koe per host are the lowest in this period, though in the other seasons this copepod species lives in T. japonica most numerously among four commensal. copepod species (Figs. 1 and 2). In case of O. koe, that period corresponds to the growing and breeding period of the first generation resulting from the spawning of the wintering females. It may be possible that these two copepod species are relative to each other. ﻿佐世保湾産アサリ中に棲息する共生橈脚類 4 種につき,夫々の種の出現時期,共生率(宿主貝数の供試貝数に対する百分率) および宿主貝 1 個体当りの平均個体数等を調査した. 1.

40|$|Ostrincola koe, a {{commensal}} copepod species, {{has seven}} pelecypod species as its host {{such as the}} <b>Japanese</b> <b>clam,</b> Tapes japonica. Among four commensal copepod species living in T. japonica, Ostrincola koe is found most frequently in that hosts 1) 2). The nauplii of this species leave the hosts immediately after hatching and spend the free-living stages in the sea water, re-entering clams at the first copepodid stage. All of the copepodid stage larvae, however, subsist in the mantle cavity of the hosts, molting periodically and finally reaching the sixth copepodid stage (the adult stage). This ecological study was accomplished by rearing the nauplii or ovigerous females in dishes with 80 ml to 100 ml of filtered sea water and then by placing the copepodids in beakers with 1 ltr of filtered sea water using in each beaker an individual of T. japonica as host. In the latter cases, the hosts and the sea water were replaced daily after the observations of these copepodids. On {{the basis of the}} results of these rearing experiments, it may be concluded as follows: 1. Mating takes place {{a few days after the}} adult stage is attained. 2. Each individual of the females ovulates at least 2 - 3 times. 3. The incubation period at water temperatures approximately 28 ℃ and 23 ℃ is 1 - 2 days and 2 - 3 days respectively (Tables 1 and 2). 4.

40|$|Abstract Marine {{aquaculture}} {{and stock}} enhancement are major {{causes of the}} introduction of alien species. A good example of such an introduction is the <b>Japanese</b> shortneck <b>clam</b> Ruditapes philippinarum, {{one of the most}} important fishery resources in the world. To meet the domestic shortage of R. philippinarum caused by depleted catches, clams were imported to Japan from China and the Korean peninsula. The imported clam is an alien species that has a very similar morphology, and was misidentified as R. phil-ippinarum (hereafter, Ruditapes form). We genotyped 1, 186 clams of R. philippinarum and R. form at four microsatellite loci, sequenced mitochondrial DNA (COI gene fragment) of 485 clams, 34 of which were R. var-iegatus, and measured morphometric and meristic charac-ters of 754 clams from 12 populations in Japan and China, including the Ariake Sea and Tokyo Bay, where large numbers of R. form were released. Our analyses confirmed that R. form was from the genus Ruditapes, and the genetic differentiation between R. philippinarum and R. form was distinct, but small, compared with five bivalve outgroups. However, R. form had distinct shell morphology, especially larger numbers of radial ribs on the shell surface, sug-gesting that R. form might be a new Ruditapes species or a variation of R. philippinarum that originated from southern China.

Monthly gonad examination of the clams suggested that spawning occurs at a low level throughout the year with a peak from January to February. This observation is corroborated {{by the appearance of}} new recruits in the monthly sample from April to June and by their presence at low levels at other times of the year. Size-specific fecundity, determined indirectly from differences in the length: dry weight relationships of ripe and spent clams, ranges from 432, 000 eggs in a 20 -mm clam, increasing exponentially to 1. 35 x 10 6 eggs in a 40 -mm clam. Estimates of the population of clams 11 mm and larger, which were 3. 09 x 10 6 in 1970 and 3. 4 x 10 6 in 1972, show a growth of 5 percent per year during the 2 -year period; monthly quantitative sampling showed no evidence of population growth after 1972. A survivorship curve obtained from the monthly samples gave a total instantaneous mortality of z = 0. 2005. The age-specific mortality agrees with the age-frequency of the empty shells collected from the bed, with a correlation coefficient of 0. 9345 with 4 d. f. The condition of the empty shells indicated that 57 percent of the mortality is attributable to crab predation, mainly by Thalamita crenata, which constitutes 70 percent of the experimental crab catch in the clam bed. Sixty percent of the broken shells were 19. 5 to 30. 4 mm in length; in experiments with predation by T. crenata, 96 percent of those eaten fell within the 14. 5 to 30. 4 mm size range.

40|$|Typescript. Bibliography: leaves 46 - 47. The bivalve, Tapes philippinarum Adams and Reeve, 1867, was introduced. in Hawaii around 1900 (Bryan, 1918). The clam {{originally}} {{came from}} Japan where, according to Cahn (1951), {{it is one}} of the most important commercial species of shellfish. It is cultured in bays throughout Japan, Korea, and the Philippines. T-apes was accidentally introduced to the Pacific coast of North America when Japanese oysters, Crassostrea gigas, were brought there early in the century (Bonnot, 1935). The clam spread rapidly and is now one of the more important commercial clams there. Tapes philippinarum is a member of the family Veneridae and appears in the literature under a variety of names including T. semidecussata Adams and Reeve 1864, and T. japonica Deshayes, 1853. Various generic names are also applied: Venerupis, Venus, Ruditapes and Paphia. The clam has been identified for me as Tapes philippinarum by Dr. E. A. Kay, who compared Hawaiian shells with type material at the British Museum (Natural History) and will be so called throughout this paper. A common name, the <b>Japanese</b> littleneck <b>clam,</b> is almost universally accepted; "Asari" is the Japanese name. The most extensive work concerning life history and ecology of Tapes was done by Cahn (1951) who summarizes the Japanese literature. Its natural history and shell pattern were described by Shaw (1950). Other references are limited to mention of its first appearance on the Pacific Coast (Keen, 1947; Kincaid, 1947 a, 1947 b; Neave, 1944). After its introduction to Hawaii the clam apparently spread rapidly in shallow bays on Oahu and was used extensively as food. Bryan (1918) reported that it became well established in the Kalihi and Moanalua mud-flats. Ostergaard, (1930) and Dall, (1938) confirmed its successful establishment. Edmondson, (1946) also stated that after its introduction, Tapes philippinarum multiplied rapidly in shallow bays about Oahu and was common in Honolulu fish markets. Distribution of Tapes throughout the islands today is poorly known, but its abundance appears to have declined since the initial spread. The beds in the Kalihi, Moanalua, and Pearl Harbor mud-flats have disappeared (personal communication [...] Mr. Sam Okamura, Hawaii Institute of :Marine Biology, and Mr. Henry Sakuda, State Division of Fish and Games). "'Kaneohe Bay, Oahu is the only area where there are enough -for exploitation. The earliest recorded planting in Kaneohe Bay occurred in 1920 (Dall, 1938). The clam became successfully established and, though there is no documented information, presumably spread considerably. At present it is abundant on the shallow water reef :platforms of the southeast Bay and is harvested extensively during a short clam season regulated by the State Division of Fish and Game. The waters of southeastern Kaneohe Bay have undergone change recently because of extensive building ashore which has increased the flow from the two streams which empty here (Bathen, 1968). In addition, two recently constructed sewer outfalls discharge treated sewage into the southeast section. Exchange with ocean water is slow leading to accumulation of sewage and water from run-off (Bathen, 1968). Accompanying these changes have been undocumented reports of atypical phytoplankton blooms, an increase in the abundance of Tapes, and a decrease in the population of the bra-chiopod Lingula reevii. These changes could be caused by increased run-off and pollution in this sector of the bay although there is no documentation. With these factors in mind, this study was made to: (1) to collect relevant ecological data particularly on the distribution and growth of clams in various parts of the bay in order to determine what limits distribution, and any effects pollution may have on the clam beds; (2) to determine interaction of Tapes with other species, particularly predators and L. reevii, a co-occurring filter feeder; and (3) to study the effects of harvesting on abundance and population structure...|$|R
40|$|Blanket {{is one of}} the key {{components}} of fusion reactors, which provides the main heat transfer and tritium breeding systems. Currently, reduced activation ferritic/martensitic steels (RAFMs) are considered as the primary candidates for blanket structural materials because of their most matured technological base and good irradiation resistance. In the past two decades, several advanced RAFM steels have been developed with continuous improvements in the world. Among these, JLF- 1 steel is a <b>Japanese</b> candidate, and <b>CLAM</b> steel is a Chinese reference. 　　In fusion reactor application, the structural materials will be exposed to long-term loading at high temperature, which may result in the changes of mechanical property and microstructure. The thermal changes of property and microstructure at the operation temperature are called ageing. Thermal ageing may reduce the maximum operation temperature by reduction of yield strength and/or creep strength. However, up to now, the understanding of the ageing effects is not sufficient. The objectives of this work are: (1) to investigate the thermal ageing effects on mechanical properties changes, including hardness, tensile and creep deformation, (2) to clarify mechanism of the mechanical property changes by correlation with microstructural evolution, and (3) to apply the experimental data obtained to the blanket design. 　　In this study, the JLF- 1 (JOYO-II-HEAT) and CLAM (0603 HEAT) were used for comparison. The chemical compositions (in weight%) were 9. 00 Cr, 1. 98 W, 0. 49 Mn, 0. 20 V, 0. 083 Ta, 0. 09 C, and balance Fe for JLF- 1, and 8. 94 Cr, 1. 45 W, 0. 44 Mn, 0. 19 V, 0. 15 Ta, 0. 13 C, and balance Fe for CLAM. Thus, CLAM has higher level of Ta and lower level of W than those of JLF- 1. The heat treatments included the normalization (1323 K/ 60 minutes for JLF- 1 and 1253 K/ 30 minutes for CLAM) and tempering (1053 K/ 60 minutes for JLF- 1 and 1033 K/ 90 minutes for CLAM). By comparing the two alloys, the effects of the composition and the heat treatment were investigated. 　　The thermal ageing experiments were carried out at a temperature range from 823 to 973 K up to 2000 h and under high vacuum to prevent oxidation. The temperature of 823 K was chosen to simulate the typical upper limit temperature for fusion reactor, and 973 K was chosen to accelerate the thermal processes. The mechanical properties including the hardness, tensile and creep were tested. Microstructural evolution was examined by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) equipped with Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS). 　　The results showed that, the hardness increased slightly after ageing at 823 K for 100 and 2000 h for the both steels, suggesting ageing-induced hardening. However, the hardness decreased at 873 K and above, indicating ageing-induced softening. No significant changes were detected in both yield strength and ultimate tensile strength after ageing at 823 K for 2000 h, while the strength decreased after higher temperatures ageing. 　　The creep curves of the both steels, similar to other RAFM steels, exhibited three regions: the short primary creep, the secondary creep which was a linear process with a minimum creep rate, and the tertiary characterized by an increased creep rate with time. After ageing at 823 and 873 K for 2000 h, the creep property improved. However, it degraded significantly after ageing at 973 K for 100 h. 　　JLF- 1 and CLAM steels before ageing exhibited a mixture of martensitic lath and tempered martensitic structure with two types of precipitates, M 23 C 6 and TaC. Microstructural evolution revealed that, the number density of small precipitates (23 C 6). 　　A traditional dispersed obstacle model was used to correlate the hardness change and the microstructure. In this model, the dominant obstacle was assumed to be precipitates only. The typical hardening (823 K/ 2000 h) and softening (973 K/ 100 h) conditions were chosen for calculation. The results showed that the calculated hardness change almost agreed with the measured ones after ageing at 823 K for 2000 h, suggesting that the new formation of TaC was responsible for the hardening. However, there is a large difference between the calculated and measured dada after ageing at 973 K for 100 h, indicating that the loss of TaC alone cannot account for the softening. The recovery of lath structure and dislocations would contribute the major effects to the softening. 　　Comparing the two steels, the CLAM has higher hardness and tensile strength, smaller minimum creep rate and longer rupture time than those of JLF- 1, while the susceptibility to thermal ageing of CLAM was larger than that of JLF- 1. The lower normalization and tempering temperature and higher level of Ta were considered to be responsible for the finer grain and smaller martensitic lath width, thus leading to the higher hardness and strength for CLAM than those of JLF- 1. However, the study showed that, because of the lower heat treatment temperature, the CLAM was more susceptible to thermal ageing, suggesting that the present heat treatment condition is not the best one. Increase in heat treatment temperature is necessary to improve the stability to thermal ageing for CLAM. 　　Since testing materials for the actual operation time is extremely costly and time-consuming, prediction of creep rupture performance in blanket conditions is critically important. In this work, the Larson-Miller parameter was used for prediction, which was based on the results of short-term creep experiments at higher temperatures with higher stresses. By prediction, the rupture stress at the typical blanket condition, 823 K for 100 000 h, was estimated to be about 140 MPa for the both steels, and the present prior ageing influenced the rupture stress by about ± 10 MPa. This result can provide a reference for the design of fusion blanket. 　　In summary, this study has demonstrated the effects of thermal ageing on mechanical property and microstructural evolution for JLF- 1 and CLAM steels. One of the important new findings is that the TaC is unstable, which can form newly or disappear by dissolution during the ageing. Ta is an element newly used in RAFM steels, instead of Nb in the conventional steel for the purpose of avoiding long radioactivity. Thus limited understanding of the status of Ta has been available up to now. The present study showed that the future control of TaC can enhance the thermal properties of RAFM steels. Since the Larson-Miller parameter only included partial effects of property change by ageing, the LMP correlated with pre-aged experiments in this study can provide the suggestion for developing suitable methods to predict the creep performance in blanket conditions including the overall ageing effects...|$|R
