5|$|Ethiopia has a long, {{historical}} {{reputation as}} a place where the weapon dance plays an important cultural role. According to Lucian, a Greek writer from the 2nd century, “The Ethiopians dance also during the battle. The Ethiopian never shoots his arrow without dancing and making a menacing gesture beforehand. He wants to frighten the enemy by his dance beforehand.” The broad range of weapon dances includes the hota jumping dance of Amharic males; the attack <b>dance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hailefo; the stick-dance of the Kullo; the Beroronsi Hama Haban, a dramatic dagger <b>dance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Esa; and the shire, the saber <b>dance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tigrean nomadic shepherds.|$|E
5|$|Related to weapon {{dances and}} war dances is the <b>dance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hunt. A very early {{reference}} to a weapon <b>dance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hunt {{comes in the form}} of a rock engraving at Çatal Höyük, the large neolithic settlement in south-central Anatolia. It depicts a hunting ritual involving dancers holding their bows; one figure has a bow in each hand, two perform artistic leaps and another holds a horn-shaped stick and is striking a frame drum.|$|E

5|$|Tripura {{is noted}} for bamboo and cane handicrafts. Bamboo, wood and cane {{are used to}} create an array of furniture, utensils, {{hand-held}} fans, replicas, mats, baskets, idols and interior decoration materials. Music and dance are integral {{to the culture of}} the state. Some local musical instruments are the sarinda, chongpreng (both string instruments), and sumui (a type of flute). Each indigenous community has its own repertoire of songs and dances performed during weddings, religious occasions, and other festivities. The Tripuri and Jamatia people perform goria dance during the Goria puja. Jhum dance (also called tangbiti dance), lebang dance, mamita dance, and mosak sulmani dance are other Tripuri dance forms. Reang community, the second largest scheduled tribe of the state, is noted for its hojagiri dance that is performed by young girls balanced on earthen pitchers. Bizhu dance is performed by the Chakmas during the Bizhu festival (the last day of the month of Chaitra in Hindu calendar). Other dance forms include wangala <b>dance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Garo people, hai-hak <b>dance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Halam branch of Kuki people, and sangrai dance and owa <b>dance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mog.

5|$|The Carnival of the Animals, Finale was {{directed}} by Goldberg; his wife Susan was its art director. The idea originated from animator Joe Grant, {{one of the two}} story directors on Fantasia who loved the ostriches in <b>Dance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hours. When development for Fantasia 2000 began, Grant suggested the idea of having one of the ostriches play with a yo-yo to the last movement of The Carnival of the Animals. The ostriches were later changed to flamingos as Disney wished to avoid reintroducing characters from the original film and thought flamingos would look more colorful on the screen. Goldberg was partly inspired by co-director Mike Gabriel, who would play with a yo-yo as he took a break from working on Pocahontas (1995). The segment was produced with CGI and 6,000 watercolor paintings on heavy bond paper.|$|E
5|$|Indira Parthasarathy's Nandan Kathai (1978) {{builds the}} tale of Nandanar (referred in the work as Nandan) further, {{introducing}} two non-Brahmin upper caste landholders, who are as ruthless as Bharati's Vediyar. Nandanar is portrayed as a lover of art, rather than God. He {{wants to see the}} cosmic dance of Nataraja. A Devadasi called Abhirami also appears; no significant female characters are found in earlier narratives. Indira is blunt in reprimanding the Dalits for not understanding Nandanar. Nandan Kathai is a quest for liberation of Dalits and women alike. Unlike earlier narratives, Indira's tale is devoid of miracles and is a story of how Nandanar falls prey to a conspiracy. The Vediyar-priest, the Vediyar-landlord and the two non-Brahmin upper caste landholders, hatch a plot to end Nandan. They make Nandanar believe that God harvested crop from the field, an allusion to the miracle of Vediyar's impossible task in Bharati's work. Then, they persuade him to organize a dance contest between Bharatnatyam, the high-caste elites' dance and the folk <b>dance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dalits. Finally, in the climax, Nandanar agrees to undergo a fire-trial, reassured by the earlier miracle, but he and Abhirami burn in the flames. The upper castes succeed in sending a warning to Dalits how trespassers of the caste code, longing for salvation, would be punished.|$|E
