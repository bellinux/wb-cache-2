40|$|The {{application}} of the critical loads methodology for radioactive contamination of Arctic and sub-arctic ecosystems, where natural and semi-natural food products are important components of the diet of many people, is proposed and discussed. The critical load is herein defined {{as the amount of}} radionuclide deposition necessary to produce radionuclide activity concentrations in food products exceeding intervention limits. The high transfer of radiocaesium to reindeer meat gives this product the lowest critical load, even though the <b>intervention</b> <b>limit</b> is relatively high compared with other products. Ecological half-lives of radiocaesium in natural and semi-natural products are often very long, and it is therefore important to take account of contamination already present {{in the event of an}} accident affecting areas where such products are important. In particular, the long ecological half-life for radiocaesium in moose meat means that the critical load is highly sensitive to prior deposition. An example of the potential {{application of}} the method for emergency preparedness is given for the Chernobyl acciden...|$|E
40|$|Current {{approaches}} {{to the treatment of}} stroke patients by senior physiotherapists in the Trent Region of the UK were surveyed. Familiarity with other approaches, the choice of assessment method, the use of standards and the use of aids and appliances were also recorded. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a sample of the respondents and a vignette presented to gain detailed information. Altogether, 121 senior therapists were identified, of whom 91 (75 %) responded. The 'Bobath' approach was the most frequently used approach, being reported by 80 % of the respondents. The 'functional approach' and the 'motor learning approach' were favoured by 10 and 4 %, respectively. The reason for choosing a particular approach was put down to experience gained through practice, not the use of published research results. As in previous studies in Sweden and Australia, the physiotherapists found it difficult to describe a theoretical basis for their treatment. The regular use of a published standardised assessment was rare. Reticence in the use of standardised published measures and a reluctance to provide a theoretical basis for <b>intervention</b> <b>limit</b> the development of neurological physiotherapy.

40|$|The {{accident}} at the Chernobyl {{nuclear power plant}} in 1986 resulted in levels of radiocaesium in animal-derived food products above national intervention limits {{in a number of}} countries. In upland areas of the United Kingdom (UK) radiocaesium activity concentrations in the meat of some sheep exceeds (in 1998) the local <b>intervention</b> <b>limit</b> of 1000 Bq kg− 1 and measures are still in place to restrict the entry of such animals into the human food chain. The use of many established countermeasure techniques is difficult {{due to the nature of}} animal management in the affected areas. This paper describes a study to develop and test a bolus containing the radiocaesium binder ammonium ferric hexacyanoferrate (AFCF) suitable for administration to small lambs of hill-sheep breeds used in the UK. It was found that a bolus 14 mm × 50 mm in size, and containing 20 % AFCF, could be safely administered to lambs of 10 kg. An increase in the AFCF content above 20 % resulted in too rapid a breakdown of the bolus. Administration of three boli per lamb reduced the activity concentration in muscle by circa 50 % between 3 and 8 weeks following administration of the boli. After 12 weeks the reduction in the activity concentration was 30 %. We conclude that the AFCF bolus developed could be effectively used to reduce the radiocaesium activity concentration in lambs within hill and upland areas of the U...|$|E

40|$|Following the 1986 Chernobyl {{accident}} radiocaesium {{levels in}} sheep meat in some upland {{areas of the}} United Kingdom were above the national <b>intervention</b> <b>limit.</b> West Cumbria {{was one of these}} areas and restrictions are currently still in place. In addition to deposition from the Chernobyl accident, Cumbria has been subject to radiocaesium deposition from atmospheric nuclear weapons tests, the 1957 Windscale accident and routine releases from the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant. A Monte-Carlo approach has been used to try to predict areas in west Cumbria where radiocaesium activity concentrations in lamb meat would require the imposition of restrictions at different times after the Chernobyl accident. The approach models the transfer of radiocaesium from soil to vegetation, based upon soil organic matter, and from vegetation to lamb meat. Spatial inputs are soil organic matter and total post-Chernobyl 137 Cs and 134 Cs deposition; a ratio of Chernobyl 137 Cs to 134 Cs deposition has been used to differentiate Chernobyl and pre-Chernobyl 137 Cs deposition. Comparisons of predicted radiocaesium transfer from soil-vegetation and the spatial variation in lamb 137 Cs activity concentrations are good and predicted restricted areas with time after Chernobyl compare well to the restricted areas set by UK government. We predict that restrictions may be required until 2024 and that in some areas the contribution of pre- Chernobyl 137 Cs to predicted lamb radiocaesium activity concentrations is significant, such that restrictions may only have been required until 1994 as a consequence of Chernobyl radiocaesium deposition alone. This work represents a novel implementation of a spatial radioecological model using a Monte-Carlo approach...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Automatic Defect Classification (ADC) is a {{well-developed}} {{technology for}} inspection and measurement of defects on patterned wafers in the semiconductors industry.

Compared to a lease contract structure where the pipeline owner controls the transportation capacity at all periods the selling of tradable rights with a competitive secondary market dissipates the monopolist's market power and leads to higher social welfare.
