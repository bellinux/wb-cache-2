5|$|Arthur Tudor (20 September 1486– 2 April 1502) was Prince of Wales, Earl of Chester and Duke of Cornwall. As {{the eldest}} son and heir {{apparent}} of Henry VII of England, Arthur was viewed by contemporaries as the <b>great</b> <b>hope</b> of the newly established House of Tudor. His mother, Elizabeth of York, {{was the daughter of}} Edward IV, and his birth cemented the union between the House of Tudor and the House of York.|$|E
5|$|Lawrence {{was hired}} as an {{associate}} professor of physics at the University of California in 1928, and two years later became a full professor, becoming the university's youngest professor. Robert Gordon Sproul, who became university president the day after Lawrence became a professor, {{was a member of the}} Bohemian Club, and he sponsored Lawrence's membership in 1932. Through this club, Lawrence met William Henry Crocker, Edwin Pauley, and John Francis Neylan. They were influential men who helped him obtain money for his energetic nuclear particle investigations. There was <b>great</b> <b>hope</b> for medical uses to come from the development of particle physics, and this led to much of the early funding for advances Lawrence was able to obtain.|$|E
5|$|The end of {{the eighteenth}} century was a time of <b>great</b> <b>hope</b> for {{progressive}} reformers such as Wollstonecraft. Like the revolutionary pamphleteer Thomas Paine and others, Wollstonecraft was not content to remain on the sidelines. She sought out intellectual debate at the home of her publisher Joseph Johnson, who gathered leading thinkers and artists for weekly dinners, and she traveled extensively, first to be a part of the French revolution and later to seek a lost treasure ship for her lover in what was then exotic Scandinavia, turning her journey into a travel book, Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. After two complicated and heart-rending affairs with the artist Henry Fuseli and the American adventurer Gilbert Imlay (with whom she had an illegitimate daughter, Fanny Imlay), Wollstonecraft married the philosopher William Godwin, one of the forefathers of the anarchist movement. Together, they had one daughter: Mary Shelley, the author of Frankenstein. Wollstonecraft died at the age of 38 due to complications from this birth, leaving behind several unfinished manuscripts. Today, she is most often remembered for her political treatise A Vindication of the Rights of Woman and is considered a foundational feminist philosopher.|$|E

However, Joe Jr., who had become a U.S. Navy bomber pilot, was killed over the English Channel in 1944 while {{undertaking}} Operation Aphrodite, a high-risk, new way to use heavy bombers to strike German missile sites in France. The intention was to use remote-controlled aircraft from which the pilot had bailed out after a piloted take-off. Joe Jr's bomber exploded before he could bail out.|$|E

From Seville 2,500 troops would depart in 30 flyboats to join the fleet in Lisbon. In the north, at Vigo, a further 41 vessels of various tonnage were waiting, with around 6,000 men. The Adelantado's total force consisted of 11,000 badly furnished and sick infantry and 3,000 cavalry, {{in addition to the}} sailors which numbered 5,500.|$|E
25|$|After graduating, both Orton and Halliwell {{went into}} {{regional}} repertory work: Orton spent {{four months in}} Ipswich as an assistant stage manager; Halliwell in Llandudno, Wales. Both returned to London and began to write together. They collaborated {{on a number of}} unpublished novels (often imitating Ronald Firbank) with no success at gaining publication. The rejection of their <b>great</b> <b>hope,</b> The Last Days of Sodom, in 1957 led them to solo works. Orton wrote his last novel, The Vision of Gombold Proval (posthumously published as Head to Toe), in 1959. He would later draw on these manuscripts for ideas; many show glimpses of his stage-play style.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 1907, Knox {{announced}} he would be playing no more first-class cricket, but soon before the 1908 season began it was expected he would play regularly in July and August. A superb performance for the Gentlemen at the Oval gave Surrey <b>great</b> <b>hope</b> he would {{be as good as}} in 1906, but he only played in three matches, and in 1909 could spare no time for cricket at all. 1910 saw Knox back in the Surrey eleven for five matches, in which he bowled as well as before, but after July he could never again spare any time for county cricket – thus ending a brief but brilliant career.|$|E

25|$|In Charismatic and Pentecostal communities, anointing of {{the sick}} is a {{frequent}} practice and {{has been an important}} ritual in these communities since the respective movements were founded in the 19th and 20th centuries. These communities use extemporaneous forms of administration at the discretion of the minister, who need not be a pastor. There is minimal ceremony attached to its administration. Usually, several people physically touch (laying on of hands) the recipient during the anointing. It may be part of a worship service with the full assembly of the congregation present, but may also be done in more private settings, such as homes or hospital rooms. Some Pentecostals believe that physical healing is within the anointing and so there is often great expectation or at least <b>great</b> <b>hope</b> that a miraculous cure or improvement will occur when someone is being prayed over for healing.|$|E
25|$|After 1809, {{there have}} been no more wars between Russia and Sweden, partly due to Swedish {{neutrality}} and nonalignment foreign policy since then. Peaceful relationships and the Russian capital being Saint Petersburg, many Swedish companies ran large businesses in Imperial Russia, including Branobel and Ericsson. Many poets still grieved the loss of Finland and called for a military revenge, ideas that were refueled by the Crimean War in the 1850s. With the increasing cultural exchange between neighboring countries (Scandinavism) and the nationalist revival in Finland (through Johan Ludvig Runeberg and Elias Lönnrot), contempt with the attempts of Russification of Finland spread to Sweden. Before World War I, travelling Russian saw filers were suspected of espionage by Swedish proponents of increased military spending. After the Russian Revolution in the spring of 1917 and the abdication of the Tsar, <b>great</b> <b>hope</b> was vested in the new provisional government, only to be replaced with despair after the so-called October Revolution. Old anti-Russian sentiments were compounded by a fresh element of anti-communism, to last {{for the duration of the}} existence of the Soviet Union. Many Swedes voluntarily joined the Finnish side in the Winter War between Finland and Soviet Union 1939–1940. When the Soviet state was finally dissolved in 1991, anti-communism became less relevant in terms of power politics and for some time, few seemed to recall the fear of its predecessor. The old cry ryssen kommer also seemed obsolete.|$|E

500|$|Despite waning {{popularity}} at home, Wałęsa's international reputation remained untouched. He {{continued his}} lecture circuit around the world, occasionally appearing in [...] headlines.

We were hoping that Obama would reclaim moral leadership for America, but that failed... in terms of politics and morality America no longer leads the world". Wałęsa also accused Obama of not deserving his Nobel Peace Prize; during the 2012 US presidential campaign he endorsed Obama's opponent Mitt Romney. In September 2015, Wałęsa again hit the headlines after sharing his thoughts on the migrant crisis in Europe with media, saying, [...] "watching the refugees on television, I noticed that...they are well fed, well dressed and maybe even are richer than we are...If Europe opens its gates, soon millions will come through and while living among us will start exercising their own customs, including beheading".|$|E

[...] Gore next placed <b>great</b> <b>hope</b> on Super Tuesday where they split the Southern vote: Jackson winning Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and Virginia; Gore winning Arkansas, North Carolina, Kentucky, Nevada, Tennessee, and Oklahoma. Gore was later endorsed by New York City Mayor Ed Koch who made statements in favor of Israel and against Jackson. These statements cast Gore in a negative light, leading voters away from Gore who received only 10% of the vote in the New York Primary. Gore then dropped out of the race. The New York Times said that Gore also lost support due to his attacks against Jackson, Dukakis, and others.|$|E
