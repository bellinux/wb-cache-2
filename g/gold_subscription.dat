The blackout occurred on January 18 and coincided with the blackouts of Wikipedia and several other websites. In May 2012, Reddit joined the Internet Defense League, a group formed to organize future protests.

25|$|Games with Gold is {{a program}} in which digital {{downloads}} of games are offered at no charge to Xbox Live Gold subscribers. Games with Gold launched for Xbox 360 in July 2013, while Xbox One games were added in June 2014. Xbox 360 receives a game twice per month, while Xbox One receives two games once per month. Games downloaded through the program on Xbox 360 are free to own with no further restrictions. Xbox One Games with Gold titles require active Xbox Live <b>Gold</b> <b>subscription</b> in order to use, and become locked and unplayable if the subscription lapses.

40|$|This paper extends {{traditional}} dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH) to efficiently exploit {{all available}} bands and licensing regimes {{in a given}} context. A novel objective quality-of-experience (QoE) metric is proposed to capture the most relevant factors that impact user perception during streaming sessions. Based on it, a QoE-driven adaptation strategy is devised to jointly select the best radio access technology (RAT) and quality for each video segment depending on the various components of the context. It relies first on fuzzy logic to estimate the QoE provided by each available RAT subject to the uncertainty level associated with DASH clients. Then, a fuzzy multiple attribute decision making (MADM) methodology is developed to combine the QoE estimates with the heterogeneous components of the context to assess the in-context suitability levels. The proposed approach is applied to adapt video streaming across available RATs in dense deployments {{for a set of}} Bronze and <b>Gold</b> <b>subscriptions.</b> The results reveal that the proposed strategy always assigns Gold clients to the wellregulated licensed band, while switches Bronze clients between licensed and unlicensed bands depending on the operating conditions. It strikes a balance between maximising video quality and reducing playback stalling, which significantly improves the perceived QoE compared to the traditional DASH approach...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{context-aware}} userdriven strategy to efficiently exploit all available bands and licensing regimes in ultra-dense deployments without prior knowledge about each combination. It relies first on fuzzy logic {{to estimate the}} suitability of each radio access technology (RAT) to support the requirements of various applications. Then, a fuzzy multiple attribute decision making (MADM) approach is developed to combine these estimates with the heterogeneous context components to assess the in-context suitability. Based on this metric, a spectrum management strategy is proposed to support interactive video sessions {{for a set of}} Bronze and <b>Gold</b> <b>subscriptions.</b> The results reveal that the proposed approach always assigns Gold users to the well-regulated licensed band, while switches Bronze users between licensed and unlicensed bands depending on the operating conditions. This results in a significant improvement of the quality-of-experience (QoE) compared to a baseline that exploits only licensed bands. Then, a comparative study is conducted between the available options to exploit unlicensed bands, namely Offloading and Sharing. The results show that the best option strongly depends on the existing load on WLAN. Therefore, a combined approach is proposed to efficiently switch between both options, which achieves the best QoE for all considered loads...|$|R
500|$|As with Xbox 360, premium online {{features}} such as multiplayer, voice communication, broadcasting and Upload Studio require an Xbox Live <b>Gold</b> <b>subscription</b> to use.
