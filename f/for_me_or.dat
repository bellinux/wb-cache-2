500|$|Levine's {{popularity}} {{outside of}} his musical work has seen him tagged as a [...] "stand-alone star," [...] which critics say have pushed other members of Maroon 5 to the backseat, even in their music. Their guitarist Valentine noted that his vocals were a central aspect around which their music revolved. Conversely, others opine that Levine's fame has been a boost to the band, with Paper writing: [...] "Maroon 5 has managed to ebb and flow with the times ... thanks {{in no small part}} to their frontman's uncanny ability to be extremely entertaining". Delta Sky described him as [...] "a natural, if slightly neurotic, leading man". He claims that the image was consciously cultivated, explaining: [...] "We talked about it {{a long time ago and}} decided I would step out, for us, not <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>or</b> my own ego ... We wanted there to be a frontman." ...|$|E
500|$|Eid {{said the}} Blanchard and Geisel {{situations}} {{were different from}} those of Gartrell, Adolf and Johnson because credible witnesses heard specific threats being made in both cases. Eid said Gartrell never made any threatening statements about killing Obama, and Johnson could not be considered a credible witness because he was under the influence of drugs when he made accusations against Gartrell and Adolf. Blanchard's attorney, Lawrence Hewitt, said he planned to research the Colorado cases to see whether it would have any bearing on his client's case. In a letter responding to criticism about not pursuing federal charges against Gartrell, Adolf and Johnson, Eid wrote, “It would have been disgraceful <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>or</b> any other prosecutor to charge someone for a crime he didn’t commit. ... There was no probable cause to support such a charge. To the extent you challenge my motives or those of the many investigating agents and career prosecutors who all reached this conclusion in this matter, you’re mistaken.” ...|$|E

Ausmus stated in an {{interview}} with the Jewish Journal: [...] "I wasn't raised with the Jewish religion, so in that sense I don't really have much feeling toward it.
