Whenever {{any state}} of {{consciousness}} has once been excited in us, no matter by what cause, an inferior degree of the same {{state of consciousness}}, a state of consciousness resembling the former, but inferior in intensity, is capable of being reproduced in us, without the presence of any such cause as excited it at first.

If we have been joyful or grieved at some event, {{we can think of}} or remember our past joy or grief, though no new event of a happy or painful nature has taken place. When a poet <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>together</b> <b>a</b> mental picture of an imaginary object, a Castle of Indolence, a Una, or a Hamlet, he can afterward think of the ideal object he has created, without any fresh act of intellectual combination.
