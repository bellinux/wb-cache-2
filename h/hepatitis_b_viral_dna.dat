40|$|When {{considering}} the cost-effectiveness {{of a new}} treatment, our usual approach {{is to find the}} optimal treatment candidates, rather than a way to lower the cost. This is because the long-term efficacy of the new treatment is unclear initially, and as clinicians we are more interested in the patients than in the price. In this situation, to show the most dramatic and beneficial effects, we define the optimal candidates as those patients who are at a sufficiently high risk.

Findings Protective anti-HBs concentrations were retained in 779 (64 %, 95 % CI 61. 6 - 67) children and 398 (89 %, 86. 4 - 92. 1) recruits. We recorded antibody amounts of less than 10 IU/L in 433 children (36 %, 33 - 38. 4) and 48 (11 %, 7. 9 - 13. 6) recruits.

40|$|Relaxation of Xenopus 5 S plasmid DNA (pX 1 o 8) in the {{presence}} of transcription factor (TF) IIIA reduces the linking number of the DNA. Parallel experiments with plasmid pMB 9 or cloned <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>viral</b> <b>DNA</b> indicate a degree of non-specific unwinding by TF; however, 60 % of the effect observed for pX 1 o 8 is due to specific interaction of TF IIIA with the 5 S rRNA gene internal promoter sequence. The extent of unwinding (0. 2 - 0. 4 helical turn per TF IIIA binding site) is not consistent with the complete denaturation of the 50 -base-pair TF binding site; however, it is consistent with a change in helix rotation, denaturation of 2 - 4 nucleotides per binding site, or DNA wrapping about a protein core. We show that proteins other than TF IIIA (bovine serum albumin and RNase) have no effect on the linking number of DNA when present during relaxation and that the unwinding activity associated with TF is heat labile.

In the second type of response, exemplified by cases with paracetamol-induced hepatic necrosis, anti-LSP was only occasionally detectable at presentation, although present in very low titre later in the clinical course.

Methods The study was conducted on 190 HBV chronic carriers, aged 1 – 19 years who were followed for 19 years. 160, 99 and 123 were traced at 5, 9 and 19 years later. All available samples were tested for HBsAg and HBeAg, whilst 170, 61, 63 and 81 were tested for HBV DNA at the baseline, and at 5, 9 and 19 years following recruitment. Results In general HBeAg which correlated with high levels of HBV DNA was lost at a much faster rate than HBsAg. 86 % of the carriers who were recruited at the age of 1 – 4 yrs lost HBeAg by the age of 19 years compared to 30 % who lost HBsAg. HBeAg negative carriers had serum HBV DNA levels of 5 copies per mL, HBV DNA positivity declined from 100 % in 1 – 4 yrs old carriers at recruitment to 62. 5 %, 60 % and 88 % at 5, 9 and 19 years respectively following recruitment.

Methods: <b>Hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>viral</b> <b>DNA</b> was isolated from HBV carriers' semen and sera using phenol extraction method and QIAamp DNA blood mini kit (Qiagen, Germany). HBV DNA was detected by conventional PCR and quantified by TaqMan technology-based real-time PCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)). The detection threshold was 200 copies of HBV DNA for conventional PCR and 10 copies of HBV DNA for real time PCR per reaction. Results: Both methods of phenol extraction and QIAamp DNA blood mini kit were suitable for isolating HBV DNA from semen. The value of the detection thresholds was 500 copies of HBV DNA per mL in the semen. The viral loads were 7. 5 × 10 7 and 1. 67 × 10 7 copies of HBV DNA per mL in two HBV infected patients' sera, while 2. 14 × 10 5 and 3. 02 × 10 5 copies of HBV DNA per mL in the semen.

40|$|Background: It {{has been}} {{reported}} a slow progression of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> in patients undergoing maintenance dialysis, and a role of dialysis session per se has been suggested. The aim {{of the present study}} is to evaluate the kinetics of the <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>viral</b> load (HBV <b>DNA)</b> in serum during haemodialysis sessions using a highly sensitive technique; the role of interferon-α in lowering HBV viral load in such patients was also investigated. Methods: HBV DNA was determined in 24 HBsAg positive patients on maintenance hemodialysis immediately before and after a 4 -hour hemodialysis session, the same measurements were repeated 48 and 72 hours later. HBV DNA quantitation was performed by a novel RealTime PCR assay. Serum IFN-α levels were tested in parallel in a subset of HD sessions (n= 40) by ELISA. Results: 20 (83 %) HBsAg positive patients had detectable HBV DNA in serum. Positive status for HBV DNA in serum was not predicted by demographic, clinical or biochemical parameters. HBV load decreased in many patients after hemodialysis sessions 5. 92 log 10 IU/mL (95 % CI, 5. 34 to 6. 28 log 10 IU/mL) vs. 4. 79 log 10 IU/mL (95 % CI, 4. 23 to 6. 15 log 10 IU/mL) (P= 0. 02). A significant relationship between mean HBV DNA levels before dialysis and percentage reduction of HBV DNA during HD sessions occurred [F-test= 5. 41, rho (least squares) = 0. 307]. Increase of serum IFN-α levels was found in a minority (3 / 40 = 7 %) of HD sessions. Conclusions: Hemodialysis procedure gives reduction of HBV load in HBsAg chronic carriers; no relationship with IFN-α activity during HD sessions was found. The kinetics of HBV viremia in HD procedures could explain the low viral load which is typically observed in these patients. Further studies to identify the mechanisms responsible for reduction of HBV viremia during HD procedures are under way...|$|R

Case Presentation: The patient is a 49 year old male {{with a history}} of chronic untreated <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas who initially presented to an outside hospital (OSH) with intractable nausea and non-bloody, non-bilious vomiting that began twelve hours after eating seven gray-white mushrooms from his backyard. On initial presentation to the OSH, his hepatic function panel and coagulation markers were within normal limits. He was treated symptomatically with intravenous (IV) fluids and anti-emetics. Subsequently, he developed significantly elevated serum aminotransferases. On day 4 after ingestion, he was transferred to our hospital with concern for fulminant hepatitis and consideration for liver transplantation. On transfer, his aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was 4217 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 7385 U/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was 105 U/L, total bilirubin (Tbili) was 5. 0 mg/dL, and international normalized ratio (INR) was 5. 91. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was briefly started at the OSH, but discontinued due to insufficient evidence in the setting of presumed amatoxin poisoning. On admission to our institution, he was awake and oriented, with normal vital signs. He denied any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or confusion. Ultrasound and MRI of the abdomen did not show evidence of intra- or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. He took no chronic medication, including acetaminophen. Alcohol and drug screen was negative.

40|$|It is {{estimated}} that one-third of the world’s population has been exposed to hepatitis B virus and that 300 – 400 million people have chronic hepatitis B. In {{areas of the world}} where hepatitis B infection is endemic, this chronic viral infection is a major cause of premature morbidity and mortality related to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and complications of end-stage liver disease. Recent data from population-based studies suggest that the level of viral replication in chronic hepatitis B is an independent predictor of the future complications of the disease; patients with <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>viral</b> <b>DNA</b> titres> 104 copies/mL (especially those with titres> 105 copies) have a significantly greater risk of developing HCC and cirrhosis. There is also recent evidence that treatment with antiviral therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis B who have advanced hepatic fibrosis is associated with a reduction in the risk of decompensation of liver disease and HCC. Several new antiviral medications have been recently approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. Several recent position statements and practice guidelines have recommended treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B with oral antiviral medications. However, there remains some disagreement as to the threshold of viral load before treatment should be initiated and the optimal duration of therapy in patients with cirrhosis due to hepatitis B.

40|$|AbstractObjective: To {{investigate}} the a determinant of hepatitis B virus (HBV) S gene {{for the presence}} of mutations responsible for vaccine failure. Methods: The a determinant of HBV S gene was amplified in sera obtained from 11 HBV-positive infants and children born to asymptomatic HBeAg-positive mothers by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subsequently subjected to direct sequencing. The sequences obtained were translated into the corresponding amino acids and compared to amino acid sequences of HBV subtype adr. All infants under investigation had received recombinant hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours after delivery and had completed the recommended vaccination course, consisting of three to four doses administered at defined intervals. Results: The usual divergence regarding genotype and subtype was identified among the 11 samples tested. Only two exhibited a point mutation within the a determinant, one of which consisted of a substitution of glycine with alanine at position 145, and the other of a substitution of glutamine with arginine at position 129. Conclusion: Eleven neonates were positive for HBV infection, and two of them showed point mutations that might have rendered the virus resistant to the vaccine, possibly due to a change in the S protein's secondary structure. Yet, this remains a matter of speculation, since the other seven cases positive for <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>viral</b> <b>DNA</b> merely demonstrated the usual genotype and subtype. The presence of escape mutants of HBV can be considered rather negligible with respect to vaccination programs, especially as the vaccine has been shown to reduce hepatitis B, as well as hepatocellular carcinoma efficiently...|$|E

40|$|While the {{intracellular}} pool of encapsidated <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>viral</b> <b>DNA</b> contains genomes in {{all stages}} of DNA replication, serum-derived virions contain predominantly mature, partially duplex, circular DNA genomes. To account for this finding, Summers and Mason proposed in 1982 that virion envelopment is somehow linked {{to the state of}} genomic maturation (J. Summers and W. S. Mason, Cell 29 : 403 – 415, 1982). Core gene mutations with phenotypes consistent with this concept have previously been identified in the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV). Here we show that DHBV polymerase mutants with altered DNA synthesis also display defects in envelopment, and we provide quantitative estimates of the magnitude of the preference for the envelopment of mature DNA. In cells transfected with wild-type DHBV DNA, immature minus-strand DNA represents 18 % of the intracellu-lar pool but only 4 % of extracellular virion DNA. A point mutation in the C-terminal domain of the polymerase strongly and selectively impairs plus-strand synthesis; in this mutant, the ratio of immature to mature DNA in the intracellular pool rises to 6 : 1 but is reduced to 1. 5 : 1 in released virions. A missense mutation in the poly-merase active site inactivates all viral DNA synthesis but still allows efficient RNA encapsidation; in this mutant, no detectable viral nucleic acid is enveloped and released. Thus, viral DNA synthesis is absolutely required for envelopment and export, and a strong further bias exists in favor of the export of genomes that have completed minus-strand synthesis and at least initiated plus-strand synthesis. These results imply that events within th...|$|E
40|$|Occult {{hepatitis}} B infection (OBI) {{is manifested}} by presence of very low levels (< 200 IU/mL) of <b>Hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>viral</b> <b>DNA</b> (HBV DNA) {{in the blood}} and the liver while exhibiting undetectable HBV surface antigen (HBsAg). The molecular mechanisms underlying this occurrence are still not completely understood. This study investigated the prevalence of OBI in a high-risk Australian population and compared the HBV S gene sequences of our cohort with refer-ence sequences. Serum from HBV DNA positive, HBsAg negative, and hepatitis B core an-tibody (anti-HBc) positive patients (study cohort) were obtained from samples tested at SEALS Serology Laboratory using the Abbott Architect, as part of screening and diagnostic testing. From a total of 228, 108 samples reviewed, 1, 451 patients were tested for all three OBI markers. Only 10 patients (0. 69 %) out of the 1, 451 patients were found to fit the selec-tion criteria for OBI. Sequence analysis of the HBV S gene from 5 suspected OBI infected patients showed increased sequence variability in the ‘a ’ epitope of the major hydrophilic re-gion compared to reference sequences. In addition, a total of eight consistent nucleotide substitutions resulting in seven amino acid changes were observed, and three patients had truncated S gene sequence. These mutations appeared to be stable and may result in alter-ations in HBsAg conformation. These may negatively impact the affinity of hepatitis B sur-face antibody (anti-HBs) and may explain the false negative results in serological HBV diagnosis. These changes may also enable the virus to persist in the liver by evading im-mune surveillance. Further studies on a bigger cohort are required to determine whether these amino acid variations have been acquired {{in the process of}} immune escape and serve as markers of OBI...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Hepatitis B e seroconversion, {{associated}} with preceding hepatic inflammation, marks {{the transition from}} immune active to residual phase in the natural disease history of chronic hepatitis B. Recently, interleukin- 27 {{has been reported to}} be {{associated with}} hepatic inflammation in hepatitis B infection. We aimed to evaluate the role of interleukin- 27 in predicting spontaneous e seroconversion in chronic hepatitis B. METHODS: A total of 142 treatment-naive hepatitis B patients with positive e antigen were recruited. Interleukin- 27, <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>viral</b> <b>DNA</b> levels and liver function parameters, were measured on presentation. Patients who had spontaneous e seroconversion within 3 years of follow-up were compared with those without e seroconversion within the same period of time. Factors predictive of spontaneous e seroconversion were identified. RESULTS: Of the 142 patients (M:F= 80 : 62, median age: 31), 44 (31 %) had spontaneous e seroconversion within 3 years of follow-up. Multivariate analyses revealed that younger age, lower viral DNA and lower interleukin- 27 levels on presentation independently predicted spontaneous e seroconversion: the rate was significantly higher in patients aged < 31 (OR: 11. 022, 95 % CI: 3. 658 - 33. 205; P<. 001), viral DNA < 5 log IU/mL (OR: 2. 311, 95 % CI: 1. 049 - 5. 091; P=. 038) and interleukin- 27 < 67. 3 pg/mL (OR: 3. 276, 95 % CI: 1. 257 - 8. 536; P=. 015). Among patients with all these three favourable factors on presentation, 77 % of them underwent spontaneous e seroconversion within 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: Low interleukin- 27 levels were associated with early e seroconversion. The combination of baseline interleukin- 27 < 67. 3 pg/mL and viral DNA < 5 log IU/mL in young patients was useful for predicting early spontaneous e seroconversion in treatment-naive chronic hepatitis B patients...|$|E
