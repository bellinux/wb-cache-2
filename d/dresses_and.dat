5|$|Life {{with her}} {{grandmother}} was strict and, as Mambo felt depressed without her father, she became withdrawn, sticking to a daily routine of prayers and studying. However, she performed well at school, ranking amongst the top five in her class at Yapenka Elementary School in South Jakarta. She later became more outgoing and was known among {{her family and friends}} as a very feminine child, enjoying <b>dresses</b> <b>and</b> make-up. While in elementary school she began singing along with songs by her favourite singers Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston in her bedroom. Her mother, believing that Mambo had the ability to be a professional singer, convinced Mambo to try and sing in public while the latter was still in junior high school.|$|E

5|$|Because Pride and Prejudice was {{a period}} drama, the design {{required}} more research than contemporary films. The personality and wealth of the characters were reflected in their costumes; the wealthy Bingley sisters were never shown in print <b>dresses</b> <b>and</b> they wore big feathers in their hair. As the BBC's stock of early 19th century costumes was limited, costume designer Dinah Collin designed most of the costumes, visiting museums for inspiration while {{trying to make the}} clothes attractive to a modern audience (although some costumes, mostly worn by extras, were re-used from earlier BBC productions or hired). Elizabeth's clothes had earthy tones and were fitted to allow easy and natural movements in line with the character's activity and liveliness. In contrast, Collin chose pale or creamy white colours for the clothes of the other Bennet girls to highlight their innocence and simplicity and richer colours for Bingley's sisters and Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Colin Firth participated in the wardrobe decisions and wanted his character to wear darker colours, leaving the warmer colours for Bingley.|$|E
5|$|From December 1559 Amy Dudley {{lived at}} Cumnor Place, near Abingdon in Berkshire (now in Oxfordshire). The house, an altered 14th century monastic complex, was rented {{by a friend}} of the Dudleys and {{possible}} relative of Amy's, Sir Anthony Forster. He lived there with his wife and Mrs. Odingsells and Mrs. Owen, relations of the house's owner. Lady Dudley's chamber was a large, sumptuous upper story apartment, the best of the house, with a separate entrance and staircase leading up to it. At the house's rear there were a terrace garden, a pond, and a deer park. Amy Dudley received the proceeds of the Robsart estate directly into her hands and largely paid for her own household, which comprised about 10 servants. She regularly ordered <b>dresses</b> <b>and</b> finery as accounts and a letter from her of as late as 24August 1560 show. She also received presents from her husband.|$|E
5|$|Grunge music hit the {{mainstream}} {{in the early}} 1990s with Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, and Nirvana being signed to major record labels. Grunge fashion began to break into mainstream fashion in mid-1992 for both sexes and peaked in late 1993 and early 1994. As it picked up momentum, the grunge tag was being used by shops selling expensive flannelette shirts {{to cash in on}} the trend. Ironically, the non-conformist look suddenly became a mainstream trend. In the fashion world, Marc Jacobs presented a show for Perry Ellis in 1992, featuring grunge-inspired clothing mixed with high-end fabrics. Jacobs found inspiration in the ‘realism’ of grunge streetwear; he mixed it with the luxury of fashion by sending models down the catwalk in beanies, floral <b>dresses</b> <b>and</b> silk flannel shirts. Unfortunately, this did not sit well with the brand owners and Jacobs was dismissed. Other designers like Anna Sui, also drew inspiration from grunge during the spring/summer 1993 season.|$|E
30|$|In {{the review}} we {{identified}} three topical research areas focused on <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> sex: (1) <b>dress</b> as cue to sexual information, (2) <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> sexual violence, <b>and</b> (3) <b>dress,</b> sex, <b>and</b> objectification. Across these three topical areas, {{it is clear}} that dress is used to infer a range of information about sex. Based on our review, the research on <b>dress,</b> sex, <b>and</b> objectification is the most recent of the three topical research areas we have defined. That research began after objectification theory was proposed by Fredrickson and Roberts in (1997); whereas the research on dress as a cue to sexual information dates from 1990 and the research on <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> sexual violence dates from 1991 (see Table  1). Furthermore, the research on <b>dress,</b> sex, <b>and</b> objectification is clearer and more focused than research in the other two categories because nearly all of it all relies on objectification theory as a framework, while researchers working in the other two topical areas have relied on a variety of theories or have sometimes not used theory at all. The research on dress as a cue to sexual information is the most varied of the topical trends and overlaps with some of the research on <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> violence. Although unacknowledged in the research, the research on sex, <b>dress,</b> <b>and</b> objectification overlaps with the research on <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> violence because that research has focused on violence in the context of sexually objectifying experiences.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} investigated {{maintenance of}} extrinsic cultural traits of <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance and assimilation into dominant American culture. Establishment of <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance {{as an expression}} of cultural group identity allows these variables to be used as measurements of assimilation. ^ The research design was exploratory since research pertaining to <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance and assimilation was minimal. Survey techniques employed a questionnaire. ^ A cross-cultural sample was 257 female students in university classes, San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California, spring semester, 1980. ^ Data gathered includes: <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance; assimilation indices; desire to be assimilated; retention of ethnic identity; and conformity to peer group dress. Data was analyzed by chi-square tests and Spearman rank-order correlations. ^ The conceptual framework was based upon concepts associated with Gordon 2 ̆ 7 s assimilation paradigm: (1) extrinsic traits are quickly lost upon contact with dominant society; (2) extrinsic cultural traits may be retained indefinitely if individuals do not progress beyond first stage of assimilation; (3) once individuals have progressed through structural assimilation evidence of extrinsic cultural traits is completely removed. ^ Research Hypothesis I, the relationship between <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance and assimilation was supported. Differences exhibited in assimilation indices of name, residential segregation, citizenship, language, family gatherings, and religion were related to differences in <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance characteristics. Persons with low levels of assimilation wore more ethnic clothing items and fewer items of dominant culture dress when compared to individuals with high levels of assimilation. ^ Research Hypothesis II, the relationship between <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance and desire to be assimilated was supported. Individuals desiring assimilation exhibited dress characteristics similar to dominant society. Persons not desiring assimilation retained ethnic dress traits. ^ Research Hypothesis III, the relationship between <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance and ethnic identity was supported. Continued identification with ethnic heritage related to maintenance of ethnic dress traits. Ethnic dress was worn on more occasions when there was interaction with ethnic group members. ^ Research Hypothesis IV, the relationship between <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance and generation was supported. First and second generation individuals retained ethnic dress traits. As generation changed from first through fourth, items of ethnic culture <b>dress</b> worn decreased <b>and</b> items of dominant culture dress worn increased. ^ Research Hypothesis V, the relationship between <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance and conformity to peer group dress was supported. Retention of ethnically defined dress traits was high when group cohesion between friends, family, and neighbors was strong. Dominant culture dress was worn more by individuals not attached to strong cohesive groups. ^ Conclusions were: (1) Extrinsic traits of <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance were not lost quickly upon contact with dominant society. (2) Extrinsic cultural traits of <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance were retained indefinitely by persons remaining unassimilated. (3) Maintenance of other intrinsic and extrinsic cultural traits was related to retention of ethnically specific <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance traits. (4) Extrinsic cultural traits of <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance were retained by individuals who had progressed through structural assimilation. (5) Strong group cohesion related to retaining ethnically defined dress traits. Finally, (6) <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance were found to be viable indices for measuring assimilation indicating the extent individuals maintain identity with ethnic heritages. ^ Further study includes: male subjects; hierarchy of clothing items released during assimilation; new <b>dress</b> patterns emerging; <b>and</b> psychological implications of ethnic dress. ...|$|R

30|$|A 45 -itemized Chinese Stress <b>Dressing</b> <b>and</b> Eating Survey (CSDES) was {{developed}} by the researchers. The researchers adopted a survey that assessed stress, <b>dressing,</b> <b>and</b> eating among females in the United States (Kandiah and Saiki 2010). The CSDES consisted of four sections: (i) effort to control <b>dressing</b> <b>and</b> making healthy eating choices, (ii) <b>dress</b> items selected <b>and</b> foods eaten during perceived stressful conditions (PSC), (iii) <b>dress</b> items selected <b>and</b> foods eaten during perceived non-stressful conditions (PNSC), and (iv) demographics. Prior {{to the start of the}} research the CSDES which included multiple choice, yes/no, and four point Likert scale questions was tested for reliability and validity. The Likert scale questions had response options ranging from “great” to “little or no” or “definitely disagree” to “definitely agree.” Likert scale questions were also used to assess participants’ effort put forth to control <b>dressing</b> <b>and</b> making healthy eating choices.|$|R
