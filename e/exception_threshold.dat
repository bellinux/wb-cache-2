Of course, {{it is more}} natural to speak of schedule performance in units of time, but the problems with traditional schedule performance metrics are even deeper. Near {{the end of a}} project -- when schedule performance is often a primary concern -- the usefulness of traditional schedule metrics is demonstrably poor. In traditional EVM, a schedule variance (SV) of 0 or a schedule performance index (SPI) of 1 indicates that a project is exactly on schedule. However, when a project is completed, its SV is always 0 and SPI is always 1, even if the project was delivered unacceptably late. Similarly, a project can languish near completion (e.g. SPI = 0.95) and never be flagged as outside acceptable numerical tolerance. (Using traditional SV as an <b>exception</b> <b>threshold,</b> it is not uncommon that an SPI > 0.9 is considered acceptable.) ...|$|E
40|$|As {{technology}} advances {{we encounter}} more available data on moving objects, thus increasing {{our ability to}} mine spatiotemporal data. We can use this data for learning moving objects behavior and for predicting their locations at future times according to the extracted movement patterns. In this paper we cluster trajectories of a mobile object and utilize the accepted cluster centroids as the object's movement patterns. We use the obtained movement patterns for predicting the object location at specific future times. We evaluate our prediction results using precision and recall measures.

40|$|Many modern {{application}} contexts, {{especially those}} related to the semantic Web, advocate for automatic techniques capable of extracting relationships between semi-structured data, for several purposes, such as the identification of inconsistencies or patterns of semantically related data, query rewriting, and so forth. One way to represent such relationships is to use relaxed functional dependencies (rfds), since they can embed approximate matching paradigms to compare unstructured data, and admit the possibility of exceptions for them. To this end, thresholds might need to be specified in order to limit the similarity degree in approximate comparisons or the occurrence of exceptions. Thanks to the availability of huge amount of data, including unstructured data available on the Web, nowadays {{it is possible to}} automatically discover rfds from data. However, due to the many different combinations of similarity and <b>exception</b> <b>thresholds,</b> the discovery process has an exponential complexity. Thus, it is vital devising proper optimization strategies, {{in order to make the}} discovery process feasible. To this end, in this paper, we propose a genetic algorithm to discover rfds from data, also providing an empirical evaluation demonstrating its effectiveness...|$|R

30|$|In {{the middle}} atmosphere, the main {{mechanism}} of GW obliteration is nonlinear breaking and/or saturation {{that occurs when}} amplitudes become large. Therefore, most GW parameterizations developed for middle atmosphere GCMs [starting from that of Lindzen (1981)] have in common that they terminate harmonics, whose amplitudes reach a certain instability <b>threshold.</b> <b>Exceptions</b> are the approaches of Hines (1997) (“Doppler spread”) and Medvedev and Klaassen (1995) (“nonlinear diffusion”), which sought to describe the underlying physics. The former {{is based on the}} assumption that harmonics are Doppler shifted by varying wave-induced wind directly to very short scales where they are removed by molecular diffusion. When averaged over wave phases, this parameterization, however, yields the very same termination of harmonics employing ad hoc chosen criteria. The approach of Medvedev and Klaassen (1995) is based on the concept of “enhanced diffusion” (Weinstock 1976; Weinstock et al. 2007). It takes into account Doppler shift by large-scale harmonics in the spectrum, and erosion by short-scale ones. For parameterization purposes, Doppler shift can be neglected, the coefficient of eddy-induced diffusion is self-consistently calculated, and no “tuning parameters” are required (Medvedev and Klaassen 2000).|$|R
40|$|Olfactory {{impairment}} {{has been}} reported in drug-induced parkinsonism (DIP), but the relationship between dopaminergic dysfunction and smell deficits in DIP patients has not been characterized. To this end, we studied 16 DIP patients and 13 patients affected by Parkinson's disease (PD) using the "Sniffin' Sticks" test and [(123) I] FP-CIT SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography). DIP patients were divided based on normal (n =  9) and abnormal (n =  7) putamen dopamine transporter binding. Nineteen healthy age- and sex-matched subjects served as controls of smell function. Patients with DIP and pathological putamen uptake had abnormal olfactory function. In this group of patients, olfactory TDI scores (odor threshold, discrimination and identification) correlated significantly with putamen uptake values, as observed in PD patients. By contrast, DIP patients with normal putamen uptake showed odor functions-with the <b>exception</b> of the <b>threshold</b> subtest-similar to control subjects. In this group of patients, no significant correlation was observed between olfactory TDI scores and putamen uptake values. The results of our study suggest that the presence of smell deficits in DIP patients might be more associated with dopaminergic loss rather than with a drug-mediated dopamine receptor blockade. These preliminary results might have prognostic and therapeutic implications, as abnormalities in these individuals may be suggestive of an underlying PD-like neurodegenerative process...|$|R

Purpose: To calibrate the Actigraph GT 1 M accelerometer, using energy expenditure (EE) as the criterion measure, to define thresholds for sedentary behaviour and physical activity categories suitable for use in a large scale epidemiological study in young children. Methods: Accelerometer-based assessments of physical activity (counts per minute) were calibrated against EE measures (kcal. kg 21. hr 21) obtained over a range of exercise intensities using a COSMED K 4 b 2 portable metabolic unit in 53 sevenyear-old children. Children performed seven activities: lying down viewing television, sitting upright playing a computer game, slow walking, brisk walking, jogging, hopscotch and basketball. Threshold count values were established to identify sedentary behaviour and light, moderate and vigorous physical activity using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.

40|$|AbstractIn the {{mammalian}} brain, {{form and}} motion are processed through two distinct pathways at {{early stages of}} visual processing. However, recent evidence suggests that these two pathways may interact. Here we used dynamic Glass patterns, which have been previously shown to create the perception of coherent motion in humans, despite containing no motion coherence. Glass patterns are static stimuli that consist of randomly positioned dot pairs that are integrated spatially to create the perception of a global form, whereas dynamic Glass patterns consist of several independently generated static Glass patterns presented sequentially. In the current study, we measured the detection threshold of five types of dynamic Glass patterns and compared the rank order of the detection thresholds with those found for static Glass patterns and real motion patterns (using random dot stimuli). With both the static Glass patterns and dynamic Glass patterns, detection thresholds were lowest for concentric and radial patterns and highest for horizontal patterns. We also found that vertical patterns were better detected than horizontal patterns, consistent with prior evidence of a “horizontal effect” {{in the perception of}} natural scene images. With real motion, detection thresholds were equivalent across all patterns, with the <b>exception</b> of higher <b>thresholds</b> for spiral patterns. Our results suggest that dynamic Glass patterns are processed primarily as form prior to input into the motion system...|$|R

40|$|Pharmacologically {{active drugs}} are {{considered}} as prohibited at any concentration (with the <b>exception</b> of <b>threshold</b> drugs) in body fluids collected during racing or equestrian events, even if environmental or feeds contamination might occur. This can create unexpected positive cases when feeds or supplements contain unlisted drugs in supplements or in feeds containing alkaloids such as atropine, scopolamine or caffeine. There are several contamination origins depending on drugs involved. Manufacturing or transportation are major factors {{which may explain}} {{the presence of these}} drugs in the feed. Two studies were carried out to assess the maximum intake of major contaminants absorbed through the diet that would not result in a positive test in urine. Caffeine, theobromine, theophylline, atropine, scopolamine and morphine were administered orally at different dosages, for 2 days before urine was sampled and submitted to analysis by screening methods. Each cocktail of drugs were administered to two horses. Caffeine: a 10 mg daily intake was found to induce urinary concentrations ranged from 23 to 50 ng/ml; theobromine: a 30 mg daily intake was found to produce urinary concentrations from 700 to 900 ng/ml; theophylline: a 15 mg/day intake was found to induce urinary concentrations of 140 - 500 ng/ml; atropine: a 10 mg/day intake was found to produce 10 to 25 ng/ml in urine; scopolamine: a 10 mg/day intake was found to give urinary concentrations from 25 - 140 ng/ml and, finally morphine: a 1 mg/day intake was found to produce a range of 10 - 15 ng/ml in urine. Horse feeds containing contaminants, even at low levels, may produce positive test results in anti [...] doping urine analysis. A maximum daily intake or a maximum concentration in feeds must be adopted to avoid inadvertent positive findings in routine tests. The use of feeds or supplements properly tested or guaranteed by manufacturers by an effective quality controlled process is crucial for feeding horses in training or before competition or racing events. The sensitivity of screening tests used to control feeds or feed supplements must at least comply with the concentrations determined in the present study. Nevertheless the lack of international harmonization remains an important issue, a MRL s (Maximum Residue Level) like approach would be the more appropriate as soon as harmonized levels of detection will be adopted. vo...|$|R

40|$|Under {{the global}} change scenario, the {{possible}} effects of ocean warming were investigated on the larvae of five species of Caribbean Echinoids: Echinometra lucunter, Echinometra viridis, Clypeaster rosaceus, Tripneustes ventricosus and Lytechinus williamsi. Their thermal tolerance was evaluated rearing them {{for six days}} under different temperature regimes (26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36 °C). The larval sensitivity to the treatments was evaluated {{on the base of}} survival and growth. The rearing at higher temperatures has revealed a great suffering state of the larvae by inducing both reduction of live larvae and abnormality in their development. The extent of impact of the treatments varied from species to species, evidencing different levels of thermal tolerance. Anyway, higher temperature treatments have shown a general lethal threshold at about 34 °C for most of the species. As an <b>exception,</b> the lethal <b>threshold</b> of Echinometra species was 36 °C, few larvae of which being still capable of survive at the temperature of 34 °C. The studies have also analyzed the effect of water warming on the larvae growth in terms of size and symmetry. The results put in evidence the presence of a critical upper temperature (about 32 °C) at which the larvae of all species reveal a great suffering state that translates in the reduction of size (i. e., of body, stomach and postero-dorsal arm) and abnormalities (i. e., strong difference in the lengths of the two postero-dorsal arms). As sea surface temperatures are predicted to increase of 4 - 5 °C by 2100, the high percentage of abnormal larvae and their scarce survival observed at 32 - 34 °C treatments indicate that the early stages of these species could be affected by future global warming...|$|R
