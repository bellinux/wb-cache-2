5|$|Despite being a much weaker storm upon {{impacting}} Russia, Saomai's rains flooded coal retrieval sites, {{cutting down}} on electric power supplies in Primorsky Krai. Due to the shortages, electric power was transferred there from other surrounding areas. Furthermore, a 50percent decrease <b>in</b> <b>electricity</b> output was documented at the local power station in Luchegorsk. To the south, an overflowing of the Kazachka River prompted the evacuation of over 60people. Overall, 55automobile accidents occurred in eastern Russia, leading to nine fatalities and 76people injured.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, the Portland Water Bureau {{expressed}} their {{surprise at the}} cost of running the fountain, which at the time was consuming $34,000 in water and $13,000 <b>in</b> <b>electricity</b> each year. Also in 1988, a 26-year-old Vancouver man was drowned when he attempted to swim through a small water pipe and got wedged under a concrete slab. He was taken to the Oregon Health & Science University and was listed in critical condition. According to Portland police, he had been drinking alcohol.|$|E

In the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research <b>in</b> <b>electricity,</b> selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key {{to the bottom of}} a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key {{to the back of his}} hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges.|$|E
