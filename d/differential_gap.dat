Proteomic analysis is a suitable approach to study <b>differential</b> <b>GAP</b> patterns between control and drug-treated cells. Since antimycotics induce variation in GAP content, we investigated {{the effect of a}} sublethal dose of micafungin and observed a clear increase in Bgl 2 p, an enzyme with glucanosyltransferase activity, with respect to a general decrease in cell wall protein content. Immunoelectron microscopy using mouse antiserum confirmed this increase of Bgl 2 p on the outer cell wall but also revealed a dramatic increase in the immature Bgl 2 p isoform in the cytoplasm of drug-treated cells. Since this increased expression of Bgl 2 p is clearly dependent upon micafungin treatment, this enzyme appears {{to be one of the}} survival strategies of C. albicans and thus could be considered the molecular basis of antifungal resistance and also as a potential valuable candidate for future vaccine development. © 2008 Elsevier B.

40|$|Recent {{systematic}} reviews {{have encouraged}} the psychiatric research community to reevaluate {{the contours of}} schizophrenia epidemiology. This paper provides a concise overview of three related systematic reviews on the incidence, prevalence, and mortality associated with schizophrenia. The reviews shared key methodological features regarding search strategies, analysis {{of the distribution of}} the frequency estimates, and exploration of the influence of key variables (sex, migrant status, urbanicity, secular trend, economic status, and latitude). Contrary to previous interpretations, the incidence of schizophrenia shows prominent variation between sites. The median incidence of schizophrenia was 15. 2 / 100, 000 persons, and the central 80 % of estimates varied over a fivefold range (7. 7 - 43. 0 / 100, 000). The rate ratio for males: females was 1. 4 : 1. Prevalence estimates also show prominent variation. The median lifetime morbid risk for schizophrenia was 7. 2 / 1, 000 persons. On the basis of the standardized mortality ratio, people with schizophrenia have a two-to threefold increased risk of dying (median standardized mortality ratio 5 2. 6 for all-cause mortality), and this <b>differential</b> <b>gap</b> in mortality has increased over recent decades. Compared with native-born individuals, migrants have an increased incidence and prevalence of schizophrenia. Exposures related to urbanicity, economic status, and latitude are also associated with various frequency measures.

40|$|CAPRI is {{a member}} of the GAP 1 family of GTPase-activating {{proteins}} (GAPs) for small G proteins. It is known to function as an amplitude sensor for intracellular Ca 2 + levels stimulated by extracellular signals and has a catalytic domain with dual RasGAP and RapGAP activities. Here, we have investigated the mechanism that switches CAPRI between its two GAP activities. We demonstrate that CAPRI forms homodimers in vitro and in vivo in a Ca 2 +-dependent manner. The site required for dimerization was pinpointed by deletion and point mutations to a helix motif that forms a hydrophobic face in the extreme C-terminal tail of the CAPRI protein. Deletion of this helix motif abolished dimer formation but did not affect translocation of CAPRI to the plasma membrane upon cell stimulation with histamine. We found that dimeric and monomeric CAPRI coexist in cells and that the ratio of dimeric to monomeric CAPRI increases upon cell stimulation with histamine. Free Ca 2 + at physiologically relevant concentrations was both necessary and sufficient for dimer formation. Importantly, the monomeric and dimeric forms of CAPRI exhibited <b>differential</b> <b>GAP</b> activities in vivo; the wild-type form of CAPRI had stronger RapGAP activity than RasGAP activity, whereas a monomeric CAPRI mutant showed stronger RasGAP than RapGAP activity. These results demonstrate that CAPRI switches between its dual GAP roles by forming monomers or homodimers through a process regulated by Ca 2 +. We propose that Ca 2 +-dependent dimerization of CAPRI may serve to coordinate Ras and Rap 1 signaling pathways...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to offer two {{empirical}} analyses of differences in the donations of money and time between males and females based on the impact of identical variables on the donation of money and time. Analysis was made of not only how a person's giving patterns are determined for both sexes, but also what portion of differences in giving patterns can be explained by observable and unobservable characteristics between men and women. Design/methodology/approach – The US dataset Giving and Volunteering 1999 was used in the study. Findings – It was found that, on average, women are predicted to donate more of both money and time. Variables affecting money donations are significant and robust for both males and females, whereas the variation in time donation is poorly explained by the same variables. A substantial portion of the money and time donation <b>differential</b> <b>gap</b> (over 85 percent in time donation) is unexplained by mean levels of characteristics such as, wage, age and experience. Practical implications – While the issue of whether altruism is innate or the product of socialization is not addressed, these results imply that women bring an extra willingness to give and to volunteer than do men. As women gain economic power in the marketplace, this may result in even more giving and volunteering, creating a windfall to organizations that rely on such donations. Originality/value – Organizations that rely on women for donations of time and money may find these results interesting. They imply that women are motivated by forces not easily captured by a traditional wage equation, especially when looking at donations of time.

40|$|At a {{priority}} intersection, critical gap is the threshold by which drivers judge whether {{to accept a}} gap or retain holding position. It is usually taken as a fixed value or considered to follow a certain distribution. Critical gap is needed at roadway segment to allow road user to make decisions relative to the lead vehicle. If the critical gap is larger than reaction time, drivers maintain safe following distance from the vehicle in front; otherwise the probability of vehicle collusion is heightened. The paper is aimed at determining critical gap acceptance at roadway segment under rainfall condition. <b>Differential</b> <b>gap</b> is expected under dry and rainfall conditions irrespective of rainfall intensity due to reduced visibility. Based on the hypothesis that rainy conditions have effect on critical gap acceptance, impact {{studies were carried out}} at Pontian-Skudai Route 5, Malaysia. The objectives are to estimate average gap and determine critical gap acceptance under prevailing conditions. In a 'dry and rainfall impact study', traffic stream gap was calculated from the headway, flow, length of vehicle and speed relationship. Headway was mainly derived from maximum flow rate. Results show that average traffic stream gap for dry weather is higher than that of rainfall conditions. However, motorists maintain a safe following distance under both circumstances. The paper concluded that rainfalls irrespective of their intensities have no significant impact on critical gap acceptance. These so because all observed vehicles on the roadway under rainy conditions are affected and there is no undue advantage enjoyed by any particular type of vehicle.

The complicated structure of the data has been considered carefully during all the stages of the analysis employing plausible values and jackknife standard error technique to accommodate the measurement error of the dependant variable and the clustering of students in classes and schools. The education production functions provide broad evidence from mean and quantile analysis of very low returns to schooling; few school variables are significant and none have effects across countries and quantiles. In general, student characteristics were {{far more important than}} school factors in explaining test scores, but there was considerable variability across countries in which specific factors were significant. Strikingly, computer usage was found to influence students’ performance negatively in six MENA countries. Only Turkey and Iran had a significant positive effect of computer usage on maths achievements. Gender inequality of academic achievement has been investigated thoroughly using mean and quantile decomposition analysis.

Transfers are required for getting to and from the device to bed, bath tub, car seat, among others. The United States Access Board develops guidelines and maintains design criteria for the built environment to maximize accessibility to public places. The objective {{of this study was to}} analyze the impact of transfer setup on performance of independent transfers. The first aim of the study was to perform an expert review of the current knowledge regarding transfers and the impact of setup. Results showed a consensus among studies that transferring to a higher surface implies greater exertion of the upper limb. Yet, there is no evidence concerning height differences, horizontal distance, and space needed next to the target surface so it can be accessible by a majority of WMD users. The second aim was to compare the current guidelines for amusement park rides with the results obtained by evaluating the impact of setup on transfer performance using a custom-built transfer station. We evaluated community-dwelling WMD users who were able to transfer independently and who represented a broad spectrum of disabilities. We evaluated the impact of height <b>differential,</b> <b>gap,</b> placement of a non removable armrest, and the effect of a grab bar. Results showed that height differentials above and below WMD height, gaps and obstacles pose serious transfer-related accessibility problems for WMD users. Current guidelines for amusement park rides fall short in terms of height recommendations and space available for the WMD and could exclude up to 72 % of our sample. The third aim was to evaluate the relationship between functional performance (i. e. upper limb strength and trunk control) and transfer ability in people with spinal cord injury. Results found that trunk stability and gender are significant predictors of transfer ability. Rehabilitation plans should include balance training and core strengthening in addition to upper limb conditioning when teaching transfer skills.

As isotermas foram determinadas em atividades de água no intervalo de 0, 11 a 0, 84, sob temperaturas que variaram de 30 a 50 °C. A Equação de GAB, que se ajustou bem às isotermas experimentais, foi utilizada para estimar as propriedades termodinâmicas de adsorção. As isotermas apresentaram ligeira inversão, indicando a precença de amido danificado. A entalpia diferencial e a entropia diferencial aumentaram com a diminuição da umidade de equilíbrio e correlacionaram entre si confirmando a compensação química linear. Um modelo exponencial do tipo Y = b. e(a/Xe) descreveu adequadamente a dependência destas propriedades diferenciais ao teor de umidade de equilíbrio. A entalpia integral e a entropia integral aumentaram continuamente com o teor de umidade de equil��brio, porém com valores negativos para a entropia integral.

Chapter I examines the supply and demand motivations of agents in a labor market for Ph. D. s that is segmented by sector. Labor is heterogeneous across sectors in that individuals with the same skills may earn different wages in different sectors. This {{can be attributed to}} sector differences in the organizational structure of work, and differences in the pricing of sector-specific output. Sector employers maximize profits by offering a prospective employee a wage equal to the employee 2 ̆ 7 s estimated value of marginal product in that sector. Prospective employees select employment in the sector that yields the highest degree of utility in employment. Employees maximize utility based on personal tastes (that are inherently identified by demographic characteristics) and on the wages offered to them by employers in different sectors. Wage offers are assumed to be determined independent of employees 2 ̆ 7 supply decisions (i. e. they are exogenous in the utility maximization problem).;Chapter 2 presents an analysis of wage differences across gender and race categories. It performs wage gap decompositions that determine the portions of the wage gap attributed to differences in the stock of human capital and differences in employer valuation of gender- and race-specific human capital. Moreover, Chapter 2 examines sector differences in these wage gaps. It decomposes sector wage <b>gap</b> <b>differentials</b> into observed and unobserved human capital and price effects. The observed human capital effect (also known as the observed X effect) evaluates sector differences in the relative human capital stocks of gender and race categories.

This study was carried out to analyse the socio-cultural perception about Moringa oleifera according to farmers’ gender in Southwestern Nigeria. It specifically established the correlates of perception of Moringa oleifera among the farmers; described the socio-demographics of the farmers; examined the gender gaps in the level of awareness and propagation of Moringa oleifera; compared their willingness to adopt innovation on Moringa oleifera and analysed the constraints associated with men’s and women’s propagation of Moringa oleifera. A snow-ball sampling technique was used to select equal number of male and female respondents across the region. The results revealed amongst others, that widowhood and illiteracy were the likely interlocking system, which has reshaped oppression among the female respondents. Statistically significant gender gaps or inequalities at P ≤ 0. 05 level, existed in the level of awareness (F = 6. 29), propagation (F = 15. 56), willingness to adopt innovation (F = 12. 61) and socio-cultural perception of Moringa oleifera (F = 11. 34).

40|$|Background: Rice (Oryza sativa) is {{the most}} {{consumed}} staple food in Nigeria. Consumers have persistently preferred {{and are willing to}} pay higher prices for imported rice despite improvements in the quality attributes of local rice brands in the last 5 years. Nigeria’s import bill of over $ 6 million daily on rice is not only a drain on the country’s Forex reserves, but a threat {{to the development of the}} domestic rice industry. Previous studies on rice consumers’ behaviours have not explained the underlying reason of how consumers with imported brands preference mind-set make purchasing decisions when faced with both local and imported rice brands with almost similar quality attributes but different market prices. Aim: When making purchase decisions, consumers consider product quality in comparison to its price. This study attempts to explain how the differences in prices and quality attributes of local and imported rice brands determine consumer’s inertia against preference for imported rice brands in Nigeria. Setting: This study was conducted in the Federal Capital Territory of Nigeria using data sets collected from a survey of 460 rice consumer households. Methods: Data were collected using a structured questionnaire administered to the household heads during the face-to-face interview. Two separate binary logit regression models were estimated for households’ preference and WTP for imported rice. Results: The results show that price, household head’s age, household’s income and general perception are statistically significant variables explaining household’s preference and WTP for imported rice brands. Consumers’ inertia against preference and WTP for imported rice persists because of the negative price–quality <b>differential</b> <b>gaps</b> between local and imported rice brands. Conclusion: Rice consumers in Nigeria compare price and quality differentials before making a choice between local and imported rice brands. There is need for implementation of flexible and synergic import restriction and strategic marketing policies that sustain wide price differentials between local and imported rice brands, while improving the quality image of the local brands to narrow consumer’s perception of the quality differential between these two sets of brands...|$|R

Capitalism not only reshuffles core-periphery relations, but rather, as Smith claims, it also penetrates all geographic scales. At the urban scale, <b>differential</b> rent <b>gaps</b> trigger investment and disinvestment in particular neighborhoods driving gentrification. On the global scale, integrated economies provoke time-space compression enabling enhanced communication and capital mobility. Smith argues that the subsequent erosion of the nation scale as the primary agent created a pivotal link between the global and urban scales. Since the 1990s, the increasingly integrated global economy has given greater importance {{to the role of}} the city. Indeed, world city building has become the geographical force of capitalism. New spaces of accumulation in Asia, Latin America and Africa are gaining competitive advantage as new centres of command and control and of surplus capital.|$|R
40|$|Individuals with {{schizophrenia}} {{have higher}} mortality rates {{compared to the}} general community. Apart from {{an increased risk of}} suicide, people with schizophrenia have an increased risk of death related {{to a wide range of}} comorbid physical conditions. There is evidence to suggest that much of this mortality is avoidable. The provision of assertive management of comorbid physical disorders has the potential to help close the <b>differential</b> mortality <b>gap.</b> While the primary data are robust, there is less empirical evidence to guide policy makers and service providers when dealing with these problems. Focused clinical programs aimed at reducing risk factors (e. g. smoking, obesity) and shared care between mental health teams and primary care providers can help reduce the burden of avoidable deaths. In light of recent evidence suggesting that the mortality gap has widened in recent decades, there is an urgent need to address the burden of avoidable deaths in those with serious mental illnesses...|$|R

The discussion includes a brief discussion of the incentives created by federal and state subsidies for institutions and for students, a summary of trends in enrollment rates by race and income, a survey of the empirical evidence on the impacts of financial aid policies, and a discussion of the possible role supply constraints may have played on the rise in the payoff to schooling over the last two decades. tuition, financial aid, capacity constraints, borrowing constraints, higher education, means-tested grant aid, subsidies-in-kind, faculty salaries, SAT scores, Pell Grant, Stafford Loan, Hope Tax Credit, Lifetime Learning Tax Credit, Expected Family Contribution, implicit tax, enrollment rate, education wage <b>differential,</b> racial <b>gap,</b> National Assessment of Educational Progress, educational attainment, D.

50|$|Gender {{earnings}} gap or {{the concentration}} {{of men and women}} workers in different occupations or industries in and of itself is not evidence of discrimination. Therefore, empirical studies seek to identify the extent to which earnings differentials are due to worker qualification differences. Many studies find that qualification differences do not explain more than a portion of the earnings differences. The portion of the earnings gap that cannot be explained by qualifications is then attributed to discrimination. One prominent formal procedure for identifying the explained and unexplained portions of the gender wage <b>differentials</b> or wage <b>gap</b> is the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition procedure.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the contribution of}} economic circumstances, neighborhood context, and cultural factors to explaining race/ethnic differences in fathering in two-parent families. Data come from the 1997 Child Development Supplement to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, a nationally representative sample of children under age 13. Black children’s fathers exhibit less warmth but monitor their children more, Hispanic fathers monitor their children less, and both minority groups exhibit more responsibility for childrearing than white fathers. Economic circumstances contribute to differences in paternal engagement and control, while neighborhood factors contribute to differences in warmth and responsibility. Cultural factors such as intergenerational fathering and gender-role attitudes contribute to explaining control and responsibility {{on the part of}} both blacks and Hispanics. 4 INTRODUCTION The lag in academic achievement of minority compared with nonminority students is a critical national problem (Jencks & Phillips, 1998). While the substantial socioeconomic difference between their families is a key factor in achievement <b>differentials,</b> the <b>gap</b> between minority and white students is present or even greater among middle-income than low-incom...|$|R
40|$|Despite a long {{standing}} debate over {{urban living conditions}} during industrialization, the impact of rural-urban migrations on health and mortality remains an open question. We observe both mortality and geographical mobility in a large longitudinal dataset of French males and show that rural-urban migrants benefited from clear advantages over those who already lived in the city. However, this benefit fades in a few years. Further we find {{no evidence of a}} spike in mortality among rural migrants as they encountered the more severe disease environment of cities, instead it seems their initially superior physical human capital was depleted over time.
