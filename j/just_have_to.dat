5|$|Author John Green, {{though an}} Indianapolis native, {{was pleased with}} the {{selection}} of Pittsburgh for filming. He commented that Pittsburgh has an amazing community of really talented film professionals that’s been built up over the last 20 years. I’ve been blown away by their professionalism, their confidence, their dedication. There aren’t a lot of cities like that. You kind of have to find the city that can be Indianapolis. And Pittsburgh, even though {{it has a lot of}} hills, it can be Indianapolis. We <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> find a couple of flat streets.|$|E
5|$|I'm {{giving you}} an example of how I think every woman should feel about herself. No matter what anyone tells you – you're too tall, you're too short, you're too big, you're too skinny...there's so many 'rules' to society's view of beauty. I wanted to dispel that and get rid of that. We're all {{beautiful}} in our own unique ways, you <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> find that happy place within yourself. And that's what the record's all about.|$|E
5|$|It's not my {{responsibility}} to draw (the audience) in, I <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> play the character. The way I would perform songs was always about the lyrics and always about trying to speak to everybody and make them watch and believe what I'm saying and I suppose I'm essentially doing that here but I'm {{not looking at the}} audience I'm obviously looking at the other actors.|$|E

5|$|The song comes first. And all {{of those}} other things that people remember, the imagistic things, are secondary, or {{certainly}} not as important. But I think I’ve become pretty good at sussing out when people's opinions of my work are coming from {{what they think of}} me personally. You <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do your thing and then let it go out into the world. The rest, you're not in control.|$|E

25|$|In 1996, Stan {{ran in the}} Republican primary to {{represent}} Oregon’s 1st congressional district, {{at a time when}} his brother Jim was running for re-election in Oregon’s 5th Congressional district. One of six Republicans in the primary, he finished third in the race with Bill Witt winning the party’s nomination. During his campaign, he teamed up with his brother to run a joint commercial featuring two talking hamburger buns with the tag line “We <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> get our Bunns to Washington”.|$|E

5000|$|After {{qualifying}} {{seventh and}} being all but guaranteed into the Daytona 500 based on speed, Ryan Blaney {{said that he}} [...] "wasn't really too nervous going into today. I knew we had a really fast race car. We <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do our job {{and we did it}} and we <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> lock ourselves in. I really wasn't feeling any different than I do any other day." ...|$|R

25|$|The {{conflict}} between {{the size of the}} human foetal brain at birth, (which cannot be larger than about 400cm3, else it will not get through the mother's pelvis) and the size needed for an adult brain (about 1400cm3), means the brain of a newborn child is quite immature. The most vital things in human life (locomotion, speech) <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> wait while the brain grows and matures. That {{is the result of the}} birth compromise. Much of the problem comes from our upright bipedal stance, without which our pelvis could be shaped more suitably for birth. Neanderthals had a similar problem.|$|E
25|$|You shouldn't make friends. It's not a {{good thing}} to be friends with people you're covering. There's just no point in doing it. It's tempting, but they're not going to {{consider}} you their friend anyway. They just know that you're somebody that can do something for them. So you shouldn't really flatter yourself that they want to be your buddy. They don't... They want you for some reason or other, and you <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> fend that off all the time. And you can't really cover people critically that you're friends with. How would that work? That would be bad. So you always have to keep that in mind.|$|E
25|$|Kant {{cautions}} that we cannot feel or intuit {{this world of}} the understanding. He also stresses that {{we are unable to}} make interesting positive claims about it because we are not able to experience the world of the understanding. Kant argues that we cannot use the notion of the world of the understanding to explain how freedom is possible or how pure reason could {{have anything to say about}} practical matters because we simply do not and cannot have a clear enough grasp of the world of the understanding. The notion of an intelligible world does point us towards the idea of a kingdom of ends, which is a useful and important idea. We <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be careful not to get carried away and make claims that we are not entitled to.|$|E

500|$|By 2008, Cuomo had reconsidered the album, saying: [...] "Pinkertons great. It's super-deep, brave, and authentic. Listening to it, I {{can tell}} that I was really going for it when I wrote and {{recorded}} {{a lot of those}} songs." [...] In 2010, Bell told The Aquarian Weekly: [...] "Pinkerton has definitely taken {{on a life of its}} own and became more successful and more accepted ... As an artist, you <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do what you believe in at the time, whether it’s accepted or not. You <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> keep going with it." [...] In 2015, following the Pinkerton reissue and the [...] "Memories" [...] tour, in which Weezer performed Blue and Pinkerton in their entirety, Cuomo said:The experience of learning those songs again, singing them every night, working on them with the guys, and then being in a relatively small venue with 1,000 of the most hardcore Weezer fans and hearing them sing every syllable, seeing them air-drum all the fills—it was such an amazing experience and so different from what we'd been doing the years before that ... So it was a great feeling of validation from the fans, for this album that was so personal to me and had been such a source of pain for years.|$|E
500|$|Waltrip, {{who failed}} {{to qualify for the}} Daytona 500 after {{crashing}} on lap 52, said he felt he had let everyone down but was thankful his team and his sponsor Aaron's had given him an opportunity to race in the Duels. Patrick, who was hit by Almirola on the final lap and crashed heavily into the wall, said, [...] "It sucks [...] You <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> brace yourself. I guess in these situations, I <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be glad that I'm a small driver and that I've got room. Kinda hug it in and let it rip." [...] She also said the crash was [...] "a blessing in a big disguise". Patrick, along with Gilliland, Montoya and Menard, were required to drive their backup cars for the Daytona 500. After the wreck on lap nine, Gilliland cut his thumb on his helmet; the thumb required one stitch but he was confident about driving his backup car. According to Menard, who was involved in the lap nine wreck, [...] "Somebody turned (David) Gilliland; I saw him get sideways underneath me. I was three lanes up and I tried to clear him and didn’t quite make it.” It took 56 minutes and 34 seconds to complete the first race; because it ended under caution, no margin of victory was recorded.|$|E
500|$|The {{designers}} {{attempted to}} recreate the films' characters and events in a [...] "cute" [...] way. Assistant producer Jeff Gullet said that, in the game's recreation of a Return of the Jedi scene where Luke Skywalker [...] "jumps off the plank ... and somersaults onto the skiff", Skywalker [...] "performs an all-out acrobatic routine {{with all sorts of}} jumps from the plank. It's hilarious". LucasArts producer David Perkinson said, [...] "unless you've got the heart of the Emperor, you are going to chuckle at many of [...] the first time you see them – you <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to.</b> They're so darn cute!" ...|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reactions}} {{towards the}} introduction of Kate Freelander was also mixed. Mark Wilson stated [...] "the growling sass-mouth feels out of place. Darshi's performance is good, at least, so we'll <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> see if the writers are capable of integrating her into the cast." [...] John Sinnot meanwhile, started [...] "I always found [...] a bit irritating, so {{it was no big}} loss. [...] For some reason however, they've replaced her with another annoying young woman, Kate Freelander. She's basically the same character as Ashley, tough as nails on the outside but still a vulnerable young woman on the inside, but this time in an Indian shell." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{releasing}} the book, John Lennon, My Brother—written with Giuliano, and a foreword by McCartney—Baird travelled to New York during 1989 {{to appear at}} a Beatlefest convention, and was {{asked if she could}} prove she was really Lennon's half-sister. Baird declined, saying {{she was not going to}} produce her passport, and the audience would <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> take her word for it. In 2000, Baird was present at the unveiling of six road signs, erected on major routes into Liverpool, saying, [...] "Liverpool welcomes you – to the birthplace of THE BEATLES", and in October she planted a tree in Liverpool's Peace Gardens to commemorate Lennon's birthday.|$|E
500|$|Part of the {{inspiration}} for the episode came from the Shakespeare play Richard III, most notably, the interaction between Richard and Lady Anne. The biggest inspiration for the episode, however, came from the fact that Davis wished to have an episode wherein he would interact solely with Gillian Anderson. He later noted, [...] "if they're not going to give me a scene with Gillian, I'll <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> write one myself." [...] The episode's title, [...] "En Ami," [...] translates from French into English as [...] "as a friend." [...] The title also functions as a pun, reading phonetically as [...] "enemy" [...] in English.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} campaign's launch, Party Committees {{provided}} instruction to judges reminding {{them of the}} political goals that their work must uphold. According to one document issued to judges in Zhejiang and quoted by Human Rights Watch, [...] "Recently, some judges have started to believe {{that to be a}} judge you <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> strictly apply the law in a case. In fact, this kind of concept is erroneous [...] all the legal formulations have a clear political background and direction [...] We must stamp out the kind of narrow viewpoint that thinks that you can also do court work by having judicial independence." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1974, Feynman {{delivered}} the Caltech commencement {{address on the}} topic of cargo cult science, which has the semblance of science, but is only pseudoscience {{due to a lack of}} [...] "a kind of scientific integrity, a principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter honesty" [...] on the part of the scientist. He instructed the graduating class that [...] "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool. So you have to be very careful about that. After you've not fooled yourself, it's easy not to fool other scientists. You <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be honest in a conventional way after that." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1999, {{following}} {{the launch of}} Ajay Devgn's production company, Devgan Films (now renamed Devgn Entertainment and Software Ltd), Kajol worked towards building a website for the company. In 2000, she launched an online portal, Cineexplore for the production company. She explained, [...] "The portal takes into account every aspect of film-making. My role {{is that of a}} supervisor. I <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> overlook the proceedings. We have our hands in everything. We are making software for TV and music videos." [...] She, however, clarified that she wasn't involved in the production aspect of the company, but participated in supervising and [...] "overseeing everything".
