5|$|In {{the medieval}} Japan, heian gentleman {{were not very}} {{interested}} in a woman's physical beauty and rarely {{had an opportunity to}} see it. The only physical attribute of interest was a woman's hair, which had to be thick and longer than she was tall. The fascination with long hair was one reason why a woman's becoming a nun was regarded with such seriousness— <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> again grow to its full length. This explains why Genji refuses to let Murasaki (his de facto wife in the classical Japanese novel The Tale of Genji) take the tonsure when she is ill.|$|E
5|$|In 1992 a {{party of}} French {{academics}} attended a condensed matter conference in Ukraine where physicist Daniel Beysens introduced them {{to the story of}} how ancient Theodosia was supplied with water from dew condensers. They were sufficiently intrigued that in 1993 they went to see for themselves. They concluded that the mounds that Zibold identified as dew condensers were in fact ancient burial mounds (a part of the necropolis of antic Theodosia) and that the pipes were medieval in origin and not associated with the mounds. They found the remains of Zibold's condenser, which they tidied up and examined closely. Zibold's condenser had apparently performed reasonably well, but in fact his exact results are not at all clear, and {{it is possible that the}} collector was intercepting fog, which added significantly to the yield. If Zibold's condenser worked at all, this was probably due to fact that a few stones near the surface of the mound were able to lose heat at night while being thermally isolated from the ground; however, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> have produced the yield that Zibold envisaged.|$|E
25|$|A {{firestorm}} of media coverage ensued, including nationwide coverage {{on television and}} in print, as well as front-page stories in local major dailies. The story continued to be followed at this level for a number of days following. It was almost poetic how the team finally achieved a level of notoriety in death that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> in life.|$|E

25|$|It {{has become}} legendary that, every single {{morning of the}} long seven-year period between the College's closure in 1881 and reopening in 1888, President Ewell would arise and ring the bell calling {{students}} to class, so <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> be said that William and Mary had abandoned its mission to educate the young men of Virginia.|$|E
25|$|In Ojibwe, Eastern Cree, Westmain Swampy Cree, Naskapi, and Innu lore, wendigos {{are often}} {{described}} as giants, many times larger than human beings (a characteristic absent from the myth in the other Algonquian cultures). Whenever a wendigo ate another person, it would grow {{in proportion to the}} meal it had just eaten, so that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> be full. Therefore, wendigos are portrayed as simultaneously gluttonous and emaciated from starvation.|$|E
25|$|On the {{outbreak}} of War, the Speed Spitfire was modified to a hybrid PR Mk II with the special Merlin II being replaced by a Merlin XII driving a variable pitch de Havilland propeller, and the racing windscreen replaced by a PR wrap-around type. Nothing could {{be done about the}} reduced fuel capacity and <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> be used as an operational aircraft. Flown as a liaison aircraft between airfields in Britain during the war, K9834 was scrapped in June 1946.|$|E

25|$|Once {{the land}} {{came into the}} control of the Church, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> be relinquished. Since the Church never died, the land could never be {{inherited}} or escheated to the lord. This {{came to be known as}} the “death hand” (mortmain). Either the Church was the death hand, or the hand of the dead still controlled land by willing it to the Church. The actions of people who had died generations before still controlled the land. This was also the “death hand”.|$|E
25|$|Miles was re-elected in 1858. In January 1859 {{he spoke}} in support of fellow fire-eater William Lowndes Yancey in advocating the repeal of federal laws banning the African slave trade. Miles felt that the {{regulation}} of the trade should be a state function and that the national ban was an insult to Southern honor. This stance was considered too radical even by his friends, such as Trescott, who felt, since <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> be supported {{by the majority of}} the nation, that Miles' stance was simply a guise to force disunion.|$|E
25|$|As {{unrest in}} the {{multinational}} control over Mars's affairs grows, various groups start to form with different aims and methods. Watching these groups evolve from Earth, the CEO of the Praxis Corporation sends a representative, Arthur Randolph, {{to organize the}} resistance movements. This culminates into the Dorsa Brevia agreement, in which nearly all the underground factions take part. Preparations are made for a second revolution beginning in the 2120s, from converting moholes to missiles silos or hidden bases, sabotaging orbital mirrors, to propelling Deimos out of Mars' gravity well and out into deep space so <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> {{be used as a}} weapons platform as Phobos was.|$|E

25|$|During the English Civil War Poole was staunchly puritan and a Parliamentary stronghold {{within a}} mostly Royalist Dorset. Nearby, Wimborne and the Bankes family in nearby Corfe Castle had sided with King Charles. The walled town of Poole {{constantly}} under {{the threat of}} siege but remained one of Cromwell's strongholds {{until the end of}} the war. In 1646 with the Royalists on the verge of defeat, the Parliamentary army from Poole laid siege to Corfe Castle. The Royalists surrendered and Parliament ordered the destruction of the castle to ensure that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> stand again as a Royalist stronghold. Upon the restoration of the monarchy Poole's defences were demolished on the orders of King Charles II.|$|E
25|$|Gorrell was {{immediately}} {{assigned by the}} Army to assist Director of War Plans and Menoher Board member Maj. Gen. William G. Haan in formulating their stance, which also deprived the airmen {{of one of their}} most articulate exponents at the same time. Gorrell's appearance in August 1919 with Patrick before the Frear Committee while still a member of the advisory board, to refute erroneous and polemic allegations made during earlier testimony, was well-remarked, but his second round of testimony on October 27, 1919, in which he returned to read into the record the just-issued report of the Menoher Board, is largely overlooked. In addition to putting forth the Army's arguments, the report bluntly opposed any independent role for the Air Service and averred that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> become more than an auxiliary branch of the Army.|$|E
25|$|Murder was {{regarded}} as an offence against the family rather than against society or the state. It was normally dealt with by the payment of blood money (galanas) by the killer and his extended family {{to the family of}} the deceased. The base sum was computed by the social status and position of the victim. The galanas of the king of Deheubarth was set at an impossibly long line of impossibly perfect cattle to ensure <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> be met; the family of a murdered slave, meanwhile, received no galanas, although the slave's owner was to be compensated for the loss. This sum might then be modified in certain situations (for example, an attack from ambush doubled the base fine). Upon the payment of the blood money, the victim's family was then legally bound to forgo its vengeance (dial). Murder by poison, however, carried the death penalty.|$|E

25|$|Just as importantly, only {{a limited}} section of the PAF's strike {{capability}} was employed during Operation Chengiz Khan. Also, compared to the Israeli Air Force's preparation for airstrikes against Egyptians (the Israeli pilots had flown against replicas {{of the most important}} Arab airfields) and the use of specific armaments, the PAF had been limited by servicability before the USA supplied spare parts in March of the year and training was limited if any. Constraints of the fledgling Pakistani economy also meant the development of its military could not be supported. The Pakistani Air Force thus lacked ammunition for effective runway denial. East Pakistani personnel of the PAF who defected may have revealed some of the plans, and it appears that IAF was expecting a pre-emptive strike against its forward airfields. A large-scale offensive was therefore doomed to fail, likely to cause heavy losses and bring the PAF in a position where <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> seriously challenge IAF operations.|$|E
25|$|Most of the war's major battles {{occurred}} in France and the French countryside was heavily scarred in the fighting. Furthermore, in 1918 during the German retreat, German troops devastated France's most industrialized {{region in the}} north-east (Nord-Pas de Calais Mining Basin). Extensive looting took place as German forces removed whatever material they could use and destroyed the rest. Hundreds of mines were destroyed along with railways, bridges, and entire villages. Prime Minister of France Georges Clemenceau was determined, for these reasons, that any just peace required Germany to pay reparations for the damage it had caused. Clemenceau viewed reparations {{as a way of}} weakening Germany to ensure <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> threaten France again. Reparations would also go towards the reconstruction costs in other countries, including Belgium, which was also directly affected by the war. British Prime Minister David Lloyd George opposed harsh reparations, arguing for a smaller sum that was less damaging to the German economy so that Germany could remain a viable economic power and trading partner. He also argued that reparations should include war pensions for disabled veterans and allowances for war widows, which would reserve a larger share of the reparations for the British Empire. Wilson opposed these positions and was adamant that no indemnity should be imposed upon Germany.|$|E
25|$|The same {{criticism}} {{is even more}} emphatically applicable {{to the influence of}} a not-self, or world of forces, corresponding to our sensations, and the cause of them. Starting from sensation as our basis, causality could never give us this, even though it be allowed that sensation is impersonal to the extent of being independent of our volition. Causality might tell us that a cause there is of sensation somewhere and of some sort; but that this cause is a force or sum of forces, existing in space, independently of us, and corresponding to our sensations, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> tell us, {{for the simple reason that}} such a notion is not supposed to exist in our consciousness. Causality cannot add to the number of our notions,--cannot add to the number of realities we know. All it can do is to necessitate us to think that a cause there is of a given change, but what that cause is it cannot of itself inform us, or even suggest to us, beyond implying that it must be to the effect. Sensation might arise, for aught we know, so far as causality leads us, not from a world of forces at all, but from a will like our own, though infinitely more powerful, acting upon us, partly furthering and partly thwarting us. And indeed such a supposition is, with the principle of causality at work, within the limits of probability, as we are already supposed to know such a reality—a will—in our own consciousness. When Cousin thus set himself to vindicate those points by reflection, he gave up the obvious advantage of his other position that the realities in question are given us in immediate and spontaneous apprehension. The same criticism applies equally to the inference of an absolute cause from the two limited forces which he names self and not-self. Immediate spontaneous apperception may seize this supreme reality; but to vindicate it by reflection as an inference on the principle of causality is impossible. This is a mere paralogism; we can never infer either absolute or infinite from relative or finite.|$|E

500|$|Lastly, {{the court}} {{rejected}} {{the argument that}} the admissions were voluntary because Thomas knew he had a right to silence, because he did not have any practical opportunity to exercise the right. The court concluded that the trial judge had made an error by separating the interview from the circumstances, and that in the circumstances Thomas had no real choice whether to answer questions: [...] "Even the threat 'Confess or be tortured' can be said to involve a choice, and a chance that torture may not be applied. But <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> be regarded as a free choice in the relevant sense." ...|$|E
