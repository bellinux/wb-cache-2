5|$|As {{pointed out}} by Paul Krugman, the Brander–Spencer model, due to the {{sensitivity}} of the results to its assumptions, does not establish a generally applicable policy prescription in favor of government subsidies. Rather, <b>it</b> <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> example for when such intervention may be justifiable and points to some conditions which may favor it.|$|E

5|$|Above {{the central}} figure shines a single small star {{at the very top}} of the picture, serving as a symbol of further hope beyond that of {{the central figure}} herself. The {{distance}} of the star from the central figure, and the fact that it is outside her field of vision even were she not blindfolded, suggests an ambiguity. <b>It</b> <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> uplifting message to the viewer that things are not as bad for the central character as she believes, and introduces a further element of pathos in that she is unaware of hope existing elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Every {{configuration}} of Rule 90 has exactly four predecessors, other configurations {{that form the}} given configuration after a single step. Therefore, in contrast to many other cellular automata such as Conway's Game of Life, Rule 90 has no Garden of Eden, a configuration with no predecessors. <b>It</b> <b>provides</b> <b>an</b> example of a cellular automaton that is surjective (each configuration has a predecessor) but not injective (it has sets {{of more than one}} configuration with the same successor), showing that the converse of the Garden of Eden theorem is not true.|$|E
5|$|The homological mirror {{symmetry}} conjecture of Maxim Kontsevich {{states that}} the derived category of coherent sheaves on one Calabi–Yau manifold is equivalent {{in a certain sense}} to the Fukaya category of its mirror.
