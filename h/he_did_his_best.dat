5|$|All {{the while}} Hancock was posted in New York, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> {{to keep his}} {{political}} ambitions alive. He received some votes at the Democrats' 1876 convention, but was never a serious contender as New York governor Samuel J. Tilden swept the field on the second ballot. The Republican candidate, Rutherford B. Hayes, won the election, and Hancock refocused his ambition on 1880. The electoral crisis of 1876 and the subsequent end to Reconstruction in 1877 convinced many observers that the election of 1880 would give the Democrats their best chance at victory in a generation.|$|E

25|$|Because of the Yugoslav verdict, on 25 September 1929 Pavelić {{was arrested}} in Vienna and {{expelled}} to Germany.

With the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the Commonwealth government lost interest in development of the Northern Territory as Federal funds were diverted towards the war.|$|E
25|$|At {{about this}} time, Robertson began exerting {{greater control over}} The Band, a point of {{contention}} between Helm and Robertson. Helm charges Robertson with authoritarianism and greed, while Robertson suggests his increased efforts in guiding the group were largely because Helm, Danko and Manuel were becoming more unreliable, due to their heroin usage.

25|$|The {{historian}} C.H. Firth {{opined that}} Lilburne had gained a great reputation for courage {{and seems to}} have been a good officer, but his military career was unlucky. He spent about six months in prison at Oxford, was plundered of all he had at Rupert's relief of Newark (22 March 1644), was shot through the arm at the taking of Walton Hall, near Wakefield (3 June 1644), and received very little pay. His arrears when he left the service amounted to £880. He also succeeded in quarrelling, first with Colonel King and then with the Earl of Manchester, both of whom he regarded as lukewarm, incapable, and treacherous. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> to get King cashiered, and was one of the authors of the charge of high treason against him, which was presented to the House of Commons by some of the committee of Lincoln in August 1644. The dispute with Manchester was due to Lilburne's summoning and capturing Tickhill Castle against Manchester's orders, and Lilburne was one of Cromwell's witnesses in his charge against Manchester.|$|E
25|$|In {{the region}} of Syrmia, people {{believed}} that dragons lived on high mountains and flew {{high in the sky}} shedding many sparks. Beneath them, in dense and terrible clouds, flew gigantic winged serpentine demons called aždaja, which spewed hail on fields. A special man, called an oblačar, would fight against them and their associates. This name is derived from the noun oblak ("cloud"). The oblačar would rush directly beneath the dark clouds, as soon as he noticed that they were gathering above the fields of his village. There he would run to and fro, following the movement of the aždaja, at the same time waving his arms, or holding a stick raised {{in the direction of the}} cloud. He would not stop until he was completely exhausted and drenched. Sometimes he succeeded in preventing hail fall, and other times not, as was the case with an oblačar from Mirkovci. When the wind blew the clouds away from Mirkovci without a damage to its crops, this man would return from the fields and boast to the villagers of his persistence in warding off the hail bringers despite their ferocity. And when hail fell on the crops, he would humbly state that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>his</b> <b>best,</b> but the adversaries flung themselves upon him with tenfold fierceness. The villagers believed and felt sorry for their oblačar, all drenched and bruised by hail. In autumn, he drove his cart from house to house in Mirkovci, receiving wheat from farmers for his struggle.|$|E

500|$|New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley {{published}} {{a volume of}} memoirs, Time Present, Time Past in 1996. [...] In it, the Democrat mentioned having written a high-school report on Hanna—his history teacher, Bradley related, {{told him that the}} lesson of the 1896 campaign is that money is power. [...] Bradley, a former basketball player, mentioned that when he was being interviewed in high school, he stated that Hanna was one of his heroes. [...] By the time he wrote the book, however, Bradley had come to believe in limits on campaign spending and blamed Hanna for a sharp escalation in campaign costs. [...] Bradley also stated what Horner terms mischaracterizations of Hanna: that he was the Republican boss of Ohio, and that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> to disrupt Roosevelt's presidency. [...] Bradley alleged that since 1896, Republicans have raised money easily from the rich. [...] Despite his condemnation of Hanna, Bradley wrote that he regretted that he could not find a Hanna-like figure who could play an analogous role in advancing his political career.|$|E
500|$|Fillmore {{presided over}} some of the most momentous and passionate debates in American history as the Senate debated whether to allow slavery in the territories. [...] The ongoing {{sectional}} conflict had already excited much discussion when on January 21, 1850, President Taylor sent a special message to Congress urging the admission of California immediately and New Mexico later, and that the Supreme Court settle the boundary dispute whereby the state of Texas claimed much of what is now the state of New Mexico. On January 29, Henry Clay introduced what was called the [...] "Omnibus Bill". The bill would give victories to both North and South: [...] it would admit California as a free state, organize territorial governments in New Mexico and Utah, and ban the importation of slaves into the District of Columbia for sale and export out of it. It would also toughen the Fugitive Slave Act, as resistance to enforcement in parts of the North was a longtime Southern grievance. Clay's bill provided for the settlement of the Texas-New Mexico boundary dispute; the status of slavery in the territories would be decided by those living there (known as popular sovereignty). Taylor was unenthusiastic about the bill, and it languished in Congress, but Fillmore, after hearing weeks of debate, in May 1850 informed Taylor that if senators divided equally on the bill, he would cast his tie-breaking vote in favor. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> to keep the peace among the senators, reminding them of the vice president's power to rule them out of order, but was blamed for failing to maintain it when a physical confrontation between Mississippi's Henry S. Foote and Missouri's Thomas Hart Benton broke out on April 17, with Foote pointing a gun at his colleague as Benton advanced on him.|$|E

After Cena got on the bad side of General Manager Kurt Angle, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> to get the title away from Cena. Cena {{successfully}} defended the title at The Great American Bash in a four-way elimination match against Booker, René Duprée, and Rob Van Dam. After Cena was stripped of his title by Angle for [...] "laying a hand" [...] on the GM, Booker took advantage of the situation and won an eight-man elimination match to win the vacant United States Championship, thus becoming the one-hundredth United States Champion in history, in a match that also featured Cena, Dupree, Billy Gunn, Charlie Haas, Luther Reigns, Kenzo Suzuki and Van Dam. Booker won by last eliminating both Cena and Van Dam in the course of less than 10 seconds After Angle was fired by Mr. McMahon for embellishing his injuries, Theodore Long began his first tenure as Smackdown GM, and booked a best-of-five series of matches for the United States Championship between Booker and Cena. The first match took place at SummerSlam in Toronto and saw Cena gain the pinfall victory to go up 1–0 in the series. Booker would bounce back and win the next two matches, on the edition of August 24 of Smackdown in Fresno, CA and a live event the next night in Sydney, Australia, to take a 2–1 lead. The next match in the series wouldn't come until the September 16 Smackdown from Spokane, WA, where Cena won and tied the series at two apiece. The series culminated at No Mercy, where Cena won the series 3–2, and thusly, the US Title.|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} {{suggestions}} that Gandhi {{had an opportunity}} to stop Singh's execution but refrained from doing so. Another theory is that Gandhi actively conspired with the British to have Singh executed. In contrast, Gandhi's supporters argue {{that he did not have}} enough influence with the British to stop the execution, much less arrange it, but claim that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> to save Singh's life. They also assert that Singh's role in the independence movement was no threat to Gandhi's role as its leader, so he would have no reason to want him dead. Gandhi always maintained that he was a great admirer of Singh's patriotism. He also stated that he was opposed to Singh's execution (and for that matter, capital punishment in general) and proclaimed that he had no power to stop it. Of Singh's execution Gandhi said: [...] "The government certainly had the right to hang these men. However, there are some rights which do credit to those who possess them only if they are enjoyed in name only." [...] Gandhi also once remarked about capital punishment: [...] "I cannot in all conscience agree to anyone being sent to the gallows. God alone can take life, because he alone gives it." [...] Gandhi had managed to have 90,000 political prisoners, who were not members of his Satyagraha movement, released under the Gandhi-Irwin Pact. According to a report in the Indian magazine Frontline, he did plead several times for the commutation of the death sentences of Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev, including a personal visit on 19 March 1931. In a letter to the Viceroy on the day of their execution, he pleaded fervently for commutation, not knowing that the letter would arrive too late. Lord Irwin, the Viceroy, later said: ...|$|E
