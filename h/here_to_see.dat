500|$|On June 17, 1825, an {{expedition}} from HMS Blonde, led by botanist James Macrae, reached {{the summit of}} Mauna Kea. Macrae {{was the first person}} to record the Mauna Kea silversword (Argyroxiphium sandwicense), saying: [...] "The last mile was destitute of vegetation except one plant of the Sygenisia tribe, in growth much like a Yucca, with sharp pointed silver coloured leaves and green upright spike of three or four feet producing pendulous branches with brown flowers, truly superb, and almost worth the journey of coming <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it on purpose." ...|$|E
500|$|I've {{had this}} idea {{in my head}} for this show Tears of a Clown which is a {{combination}} of music and storytelling. Because {{at the end of the}} day I do think of myself as a story teller. But it's rough as f---, [...] so bear with me and give me all the support you can. It's from the heart. I chose to debut this work in progress, this rough rehearsal, here in Australia because I feel so bad about cancelling on you guys the last time. I'm sorry. You've been so patient, you waited for so long, I feel like I owe you a present, so this is your present... I want to make a disclaimer... If anyone thinks they came <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a finished final show, there's the door. This is some brand spanking new shit. I don't know if you like it raw.|$|E
500|$|As a child, Mars {{spent time}} impersonating Elvis Presley. This playact {{had a major}} impact on his musical evolution; he later reflected: I watch the best. I'm a big fan of Elvis. I'm a big fan of 1950s Elvis when he would go on stage and scare people because he was a force and girls would go nuts! You can say the same thing for Prince or The Police. It's just guys who know that people are <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a show, so I watch those guys and I love {{studying}} them because I'm a fan." [...] He also impersonated Michael Jackson and Little Richard, both of whom are major inspirations of his. Mars was raised on his father’s doo-wop collection — “simple four-chord songs that got straight to the point” and on Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis,and Frankie Lymon. The hip-hop productions by The Neptunes and Timbaland, that were played on the radio constantly, also influenced him.|$|E

500|$|After {{recording}} was done, Music for Nations founder Martin Hooker {{wanted to}} arrange a triple bill UK tour in March / April 1984 with Exciter, Metallica, and The Rods. However, the Hell on Earth Tour never materialized because of poor ticket sales. To promote Ride the Lightning, Metallica commenced the Bang That Head That Doesn't Bang European tour on November 16, in Rouen, France, with British NWOBHM band Tank as support. The tour continued with dates in Belgium, Italy, Germany, and the Nordic countries to an average crowd of 1,300. After a Christmas break, the group embarked on a 50-date North American tour, firstly as a co-headlining act with W.A.S.P. and then as headliners with Armored Saint supporting. At a gig in Portland, Oregon, Metallica covered [...] "The Money Will Roll Right In" [...] by Fang, with Armored Saint onstage. The American leg ended in May 1985, and the band spent the following two months working on the next studio album, Master of Puppets, whose recording sessions were scheduled to begin in September. Metallica performed at the Monsters of Rock festival held at Castle Donington in England on August 17 in front of 70,000 fans. The band was placed between Ratt and Bon Jovi, two glam metal groups whose sound and appearance were much unlike Metallica's. At {{the start of the}} set, Hetfield pronounced to the audience: [...] "If you came <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> spandex, eye make-up, and the words 'oh baby' in every fuckin' song, this ain't the fuckin' band!" [...] Two weeks later, Metallica appeared on the Day on the Green festival in Oakland, California, before 90,000 people. The last show Metallica played before recording began was the Loreley Metal Hammer festival in Germany, headlined by Venom. Metallica finished 1985 with a show at the Sacramento Memorial Auditorium on December 29 opening for Y, and a New Year's Eve concert at the Civic Auditorium in San Francisco on a bill with Metal Church, Exodus, and Megadeth, the first time Metallica and Megadeth shared a stage. At this gig, Metallica premiered [...] "Master of Puppets" [...] and [...] "Disposable Heroes", songs from the then-upcoming third studio album.|$|E
2500|$|On February 25, 2007, {{she won the}} Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for {{her role}} in the film. During her {{acceptance}} speech, Hudson said: [...] "Oh, my God, I have to just take this moment in. I cannot believe this. Look what God can do. I didn't think I was going to win. [...] If my grandmother was <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> me now. She was my biggest inspiration." [...] She also concluded her speech by thanking Jennifer Holliday.|$|E
2500|$|I publish these poems, few {{though they}} are, {{because it is}} not likely that I shall ever be impelled to write much more. [...] I can no longer expect to be {{revisited}} by the continuous excitement under which in the early months of 1895 I wrote the greater part of my first book, nor indeed could I well sustain it if [...] it came; and it is best that what I have written should be printed while I am <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it through the press and control its spelling and punctuation. [...] About a quarter of this matter belongs to the April of the present year, but most of it to dates between 1895 and 1910.|$|E

6000|$|... "Have you? Well now, that's odd! How much I {{should like}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him. <b>To</b> {{tell you the}} truth, one of my chief reasons for coming <b>here</b> was <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him. What like is he?" ...|$|R
2500|$|As {{she came}} from a strong legal background, her family [...] "weren't wildly happy" [...] about her desire to become an actress: [...] "My parents were always making me watch Rumpole of the Bailey, going 'You see? It’s just like acting, you make things up, you wear a wig and a funny outfit. Why not the law?' But I just always, always wanted to act, {{as far back as}} I remember." [...] Her joining the Royal Shakespeare Company though, finally won her parents over. However, in a 2004 {{interview}} Oberman noted that her father's death seven years earlier prevented his seeing the development of her career and her national success as an actor: [...] "I've {{come a long way in}} my career since he died and I wish he was <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it. He was a big EastEnders fan so I know he'd be very, very proud of me." ...|$|E
