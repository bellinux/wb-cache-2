40|$|Converting {{energy from}} ocean waves is an {{exciting}} concept aimed at reducing our dependency on fossil fuels. Ocean energy devices must convert the large forces and relatively small movements from ocean waves into electrical power with a minimum carbon and energy intensity {{in order to be}} economically viable. The research herein focuses on the Oyster, a flap-type pitching wave energy converter developed by Aquamarine Power. A device that has the minimal carbon or energy intensity is not necessarily the most mechanically efficient. A commercially viable wave energy converter should have a competitive cost of energy and be as carbon negative as possible. In order to expedite the route to commercialisation, successive designs should iterate towards a minimum lifetime cost of energy. The sheer complexity of wave energy converter systems makes for a vast optimisation problem to determine the system parameters that exhibit the minimum carbon and energy intensities. This thesis presents a study of the oscillating flap-type wave energy converter to determine the trends between design parameters, total power output and carbon and energy throughput. The minimum carbon and energy intensities {{have been shown to be}} strongly dependent on minimising maintenance requirements. In order to determine the design criterion a range of flap widths and system pressures are investigated and their effect on component service lives assessed. The results are then converted to lifetime carbon and energy intensities for a direct comparison. To achieve this, fundamental research on the maintenance requirements of critical components such as the <b>hinge</b> <b>bearings</b> and hydraulic power system is required. A hydrodynamic model describes the dynamic response and links the system energy inputs to its modelled energy output. This work is intended to help guide developers of flap-type wave energy converters towards commercialisation. It enhances the understanding of the routes to failure and service life predictions, providing avenues to balance service lives to optimise maintenance and maximise uptime. This will assist in the development of more energy efficient wave energy converters over their lifetime. This information will better enable the marine energy sector to offset our fossil fuel dependence, ultimately reducing our impact on the environment and leading to a ‘greener’ future...|$|E

Especially the outer thermal protection system (TPS) of the X- 38 re-entry vehicle was regarded for all participants as a great challenge to both the technological progress and international cooperation of the involved companies respectively. Several German companies, MAN-T, Astrium and DLR, were {{directly involved in the}} responsibility of sufficient TPS structures of the vehicle in particular for the nose cap and within the body flap development. During the development work of the fully ceramic body flaps (two symmetrical body flaps are located in parallel at the lower rear position of the X- 38 vehicle, figure 1; 2), which was carried out by MAN-T in Augsburg, two mentionable qualification test campaigns were necessary and conducted at DLR Stuttgart focussed on two important bearing parts of the flap system (Fig. 2), the so called EMA = electromechanical actuator -bearing and the <b>hinge</b> <b>bearing</b> attachment system. Under contract of MAN-T and coordinated by ESA (European Space Agency) DLR Stuttgart tested the EMA bearing first in the summer of 2000 and one year later the <b>hinge</b> <b>bearing</b> attachment system. Both components have completely been made of C/SiC materials and developed, manufactured and delivered by MAN-T.

40|$|AbstractThe {{bearing in}} the roof of railway station is usually assumed {{three-dimensional}} fixed pin support. Good load-supporting, rotate and back-moving capacities are needed in the bearing design as well as durability. And the most prominent problem is how to bear so huge horizontal load in limited architecture space. Traditional spherical bearing couldn’t sustain huge horizontal loading because of excessive stress concentration induced by point-to-surface contact between upper and base plates. In this paper, a new economical steel <b>hinged</b> <b>bearing</b> form is developed to use surface contact to improve horizontal force carrying capacity. By FEM software ANSYS, nonlinear analyses are performed on bearing models to obtain necessary design results. Comparison between new and traditional bearings shows that new steel bearing is much more reasonable and economic...|$|R

In this paper a structronic concept for airfoils with variable camber is presented, in which the desired geometry changes are achieved through structural flexibility and no moveable parts are needed. A short introduction to the structronic approach to structure adaptation in general and to airfoil shape control in particular opens the paper, with some emphasis on the role of solid-state actuators. The description of the new structural concept (the belt-rib concept) follows, with the application to the case of a landing flap with variable camber. Some results of FEM simulations as well as of experimental tests on different prototypes  one of them equipped with shape memory wires as actuators  are also included in the paper.

40|$|Compliant {{mechanisms}} attain their mobility from {{flexibility of}} their structure instead of depending on <b>hinges,</b> <b>bearings</b> and sliders. Their main advantages {{are that they}} can be built using fewer parts, require fewer assembly processes and need no lubrication. These mechanisms have many areas of application: precision mechanic devices, biomedical area and in MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS). As temperature changes may be critical in precision mechanic equipment, since undesired displacements may be generated, one solution is to design a compliant mechanism with thermal compensation. Although this is not easily accomplished by trial and error methods, it can be done by using Topological Optimization Method, which combines Finite Element Method (FEM) with optimization algorithms. The optimization problem is formulated for the design of a compliant mechanism that generates the maximum desired output displacement when a force is applied, minimizing the undesired thermal e#ect to increase the actuator accuracy. Thus, a logarithm multi-objective function is defined considering the summation of objective functions using weighting coe#cients. These functions are: maximization of the output displacement generated by the force, minimization of the displacement generated by thermal e#ect in the output direction and minimization of the component normal to the output direction. Even though, the combination of many objective functions results in a problem with many local minima, satisfactory solutions could be obtained. A material model based on the traditional SIMP model is adopted and the optimization algorithm is constructed based on sequential linear programming (SLP). A filtering technique is applied to control the mesh dependency and the checkerboard problem. To illustrate t [...] ...|$|R

We have identified a cytosolic cytochrome b-type NAD(P) H oxidoreductase in mammals, a flavohemoprotein (b 5 +b 5 R) containing cytochrome b 5 (b 5) and b 5 reductase (b 5 R) domains. A genetic approach, using blast searches against dbest for FAD-, NAD(P) H-binding sequences followed by reverse transcription–PCR, was used to clone the complete cDNA sequence of human b 5 +b 5 R from the hepatoma cell line Hep 3 B. Compared with the classical single-domain b 5 and b 5 R proteins localized on endoplasmic reticulum membrane, b 5 +b 5 R also has binding motifs for heme, FAD, and NAD(P) H prosthetic groups but no membrane anchor. The human b 5 +b 5 R transcript was expressed at similar levels in all tissues and cell lines that were tested. The two functional domains b 5 * and b 5 R* are linked by an approximately 100 -aa-long <b>hinge</b> <b>bearing</b> no sequence homology to any known proteins. When human b 5 +b 5 R was expressed as c-myc adduct in COS- 7 cells, confocal microscopy revealed a cytosolic localization at the perinuclear space.

It includes sandstones and conglomerates carrying a rich fauna of invertebrates -mainly mollusks- represented by at least 45 species. A survey of this fauna reveals {{the presence of a}} new species of Mytilidae that appears to belong in Choromytilus Soot-Ryen, a genus including common species living along the Pacific coast of America between California and the Straits of Magellan, and also in widely separate areas such as South Africa, Kerguelen Island, Australia and New Zealand. Despite the fact that the bearing rocks are either a conglomerate or else coarse sandstone and that the shells are thin and fragile, they are remarkably well preserved and show enough key characters to allow a correct taxonomic placement. These include the smoothness of the shell, the dysodont <b>hinge</b> <b>bearing</b> a small vestigial anterior tooth in the right valve that fits into a groove in the left valve hinge, and the compact resilial ridge. Such a character combination points towards its inclusion in Choromytilus.

The paleobiogeographic implications of such an extended record still have to be assessed, but it appears that Choromytilus may have been an early constituent of the Neogene faunas of the southern part of South America and from there may have spread eastward, probably aided by the circumantarctic current in a similar manner to that inferred for other groups.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} pile strip foundations in {{the areas}} with karst risk. The analysis of karst hole formation mechanism shows the lateral soil pressure on the piles caused by the downfallen soil on the hole rims, which transfers around the hole edges during karst hole formation. In this case, the horizontal pressure of the pile reactive force {{in the area of}} the pile connection with the raft is transferred to the raft. Pile failure at the hole boundaries will lead to the increase of the raft bearing distance above the karst hole. The inadequate raft bearing capacity can provoke the emergency situation. The existing Codes on karst protective foundations design do not contain the analysis of pile and raft horizontal pressure under the downfallen soil. The goal of this work is to develop the method of pile strip foundations analysis {{in the areas}} with karst risk in case of karst hole formation. The analysis of stress-strain state of the system “foundation soil — pile foundation” was carried out using numerical modeling in geotechnical program MIDAS GTS. As a result of numerical investigations, the diagrams of lateral soil pressure onto the piles and the raft are plotted. The pile pressure is approximated with the linear or bilinear function in dependence on geometrical dimensions of the karst hole and strength characteristics of soil that generates the horizontal pressure. In the Codes, the analysis of a pile under lateral soil pressure is given for a pile with the free end. In the problem examined, the pile head has the <b>hinged</b> <b>bearing</b> in place of the connection with the raft. In view of the given boundary data, the pile design scheme is plotted. The inner forces and displacements of the pile are determined by integrating the differential equation of a pile bending. The consistent integrations are evaluated out of the boundary conditions. The boundary values of inner forces and displacements are evaluated from the equality conditions of displacements and inner forces in the pile at the level of the hole bottom that are evaluated in turn for the upward and downward pile section. The method of pile analysis is developed in case of lateral soil pressure approximation with the linear function. The method worked out allows recalculating a pile being at the edge of the karst hole and accepting the lateral pressure of the downfallen soil on the hole edges...|$|R

In order {{to know the}} {{behavior}} of the doors under blast load and verify the safety of the doors, dynamic finite element analysis and simulation are carried out with advanced FEA software, ANSYS/LS-DYNA and SAP. Contact surfaces are introduced to simulate the relation between the door leaf and doorframe, as well as the relation between the door <b>hinges</b> and <b>bearings.</b> Altogether 24 different load cases are analyzed to simulate various load conditions. For example, the difference between conventional explosive blast load and nuclear blast load are compared. Different doorframes are also discussed. And blasts that are much larger than the designed ones are analyzed to obtain the damage process of the doors and to get the safety margin to the original design. From the numerical computations, some special results are obtained, which are difficult from static analysis. For instant, the damage process shows that even if there is very large plastic strain in the door, the door may still be safe. So traditional allowable stress design method may be uneconomical. However, the numerical result also shows that the most dangerous situation for the door hinges does not consisted with designer's imagine, which means the original hinge design may be unsafe. Following conclusions are obtained from the whole simulation: (1) traditional static or quasi-static analysis has some limits in these special structures; (2) dynamic FEA is a cheap and convenient method for these structures; (3) contact analysis is important for dynamic simulation...|$|R

Pediatric prosthetic knees {{on the market today}} are not well designed for infants and toddlers for various reasons. Children at this age need a prosthetic that is light in weight, durable, and stable during stance. Of the eleven knees on the market for children, all but three are polycentric or four-bar knees, meaning they have multiple points of movement. Polycentric knees are popular designs because they offer the added benefit of stable stance control and increased toe clearance, unfortunately this type of knee is often too heavy for young children to wear comfortably and is not well suited for harsh environments such as sand or water, common places children like to play. The remaining three knees do not offer a stance control feature and are equally vulnerable to harsh environments due to ball <b>bearing</b> <b>hinges.</b> Compliant mechanisms offer several design advantages that may make them suitable in pediatric prosthetic knees [...] light weight, less susceptible to harsh environments, polycentric capable, low part count, etc. Unfortunately, they present new challenges that must be dealt with individually.

With the belt-rib idea the adaptive wing issue is approached in a new way: instead of a "mechatronic" solution with <b>hinges</b> or linear <b>bearings</b> a "structronic" solution is chosen, where distributed flexibility allows the desired shape changes. The resulting system is not only easier to maintain due to the absence of wear, but also is structurally more reliable and substantially lighter. The new concept evolves from the classical wing structure. The classical rib, which i s in charge of the wing section's stiffness, is replaced by a "belt rib," which allows camber changes within given limits while leaving the remaining in-plane stiffness properties of the section widely unchanged. The evolution of the belt-rib concept was accompanied by experimental tests on different prototypes. After a first development stage, in which mainly the system's shape adaptability and the overall stiffness properties were investigated, further steps followed, focused on manufacturing, weight optimization and strength aspects. Recent developments dealt with the construction of a model with solid-state hinges, realized as hybrid glass fiber-carbon-fiber reinforced composite s tructure. The model is actuated mechanically by cables, which can be replaced by multifunctional actuators-like shape memory wires-in the future.

40|$|As a {{helicopter}} transitions from hover to forward flight, the main rotor blades experience an asymmetry in flow field around the azimuth, with the blade section tangential velocities increasing on the advancing side and decreasing on the retreating side. To {{compensate for the}} reduced dynamic pressure on the retreating side, the blade pitch angles over {{this part of the}} rotor disk are increased. Eventually, a high enough forward speed is attained to produce compressibility effects on the advancing side of the rotor disk and stall on the retreating side. The onset of these two phenomena drastically increases the rotor vibratory loads and power requirements, thereby effectively establishing a limit on the maximum achievable forward speed. The alleviation of compressibility and stall (and the associated decrease in vibratory loads and power) would potentially result in an increased maximum forward speed. In the past, several methods have been examined and implemented to reduce the vibratory hub loads. Some of these methods are aimed specifically at alleviating vibration at very high flight speeds and increasing the maximum flight speed, while others focus on vibration reduction within the conventional flight envelope. Among the later are several types passive as well as active schemes. Passive schemes include a variety of vibration absorbers such as mechanical springs, pendulums, and bifilar absorbers. These mechanism are easy to design and maintain, but incur significant weight and drag penalties. Among the popular active control schemes in consideration are Higher Harmonic Control (HHC) and Individual Blade Control (IBC). HHC uses a conventional swash plate to generate a multi-cyclic pitch input to the blade. This requires actuators capable of sufficiently high power and bandwidth, increasing the cost and weight of the aircraft. IBC places actuators in the rotating reference frame, requiring the use of slip rings capable of transferring enough power to the actuators. Both schemes cause an increase in pitch link loads. Trailing Edge Flap (TEF) deployment can also used to generate unsteady aerodynamic forces and moments that counter the original vibratory loads, and thereby reduce rotor vibrations. While the vibrations absorbers, HHC, IBC, and TEF concepts discussed above attempt to reduce the vibratory loads, they do not specifically address the phenomena causing the vibrations at high advance ratios. One passive method that attempts to directly alleviate compressibility and stall, instead of reducing the ensuing vibrations, is the use of advanced tip designs. Taper, sweep, anhedral, and the manipulation of other geometric properties of the blade tips can reduce the severity of stall and compressibility effects, as well as reduce rotor power. A completely different approach to solve these problems is the tiltrotor configuration. As the forward velocity of the aircraft increases, the rotors, in this case, are tilted forward until they are perpendicular to the flow and act as propellers. This eliminates the edgewise flow encountered by conventional rotors and circumvents all the problems associated with flow asymmetry. However, the success involves a tremendous increase in cost and complexity of the aircraft. Another possible approach that has been proposed for the alleviation of vibratory loads at high forward flight speeds involves the use of controlled lead-lag motions to reduce the asymmetry in flow. A correctly phased 1 /rev controlled lag motion could be introduced such that it produces a backward velocity on the advancing side and a forward velocity on the retreating side, to delay compressibility effects and stall to a higher advance ratio. Using a large enough lead-lag amplitude, the tip velocities could be reduced to levels encountered in hover. This concept was examined by two groups in the 1950 's and early 1960 's. In the United States, the Research Labs Division of United Aircraft developed a large lead-lag motion rotor, meant to achieve lag motion amplitudes up to 45 degrees. In order to reduce the required actuation force, the blade hinges were moved to 40 % of the blade radius to increase the rotating lag frequency to approximately 1 /rev. The blade hinges were redesigned to produce a flap-lag coupling so the large flapwise aerodynamic loads could be exploited to actuate the blades in the lag direction. A wind tunnel test of this rotor concept revealed actuation and blade motion scheduling problems. The project was eventually discontinued due to these problems and high blade stresses. Around the same time, at Boelkow in Germany, a similar lead-lag rotor program was conducted under the leadership of Hans Derschmidt. Here, too, the blade hinges were moved outboard to 34 % radius to reduce the actuation loads. The main difference between this and the United Aircraft program was the use of a mechanical actuation scheme with maximum lead-lag motions of 400. This program was also discontinued for unclear reasons. The present study is directed toward conducting a comprehensive analytical examination {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} controlled lead-lag motions in reducing vibratory hub loads and increasing maximum flight speed. Since both previous studies on this subject were purely experimental, only a limited data set and physical understanding of the problem was obtained. With the currently available analytical models and computational resources, the present effort is geared toward developing an in-depth physical understanding of the precise underlying mechanisms by which vibration reduction may be achieved. Additionally, in recognition of the fact that large amplitude lead-lag motions would - (i) be difficult to implement, and (ii) produce very large blade stresses; the present study examines the potential of only moderate-to-small lead-lag motions for reduction of vibratory hub loads. Using such an approach, the emphasis is not on eliminating the periodic variations in tangential velocity at the blade tip, but at best reducing these variations slightly so that compressibility and stall are delayed to slightly higher advance ratios. This study was conducted in two steps. In the first step, a hingeless helicopter rotor was modeled using rigid blades undergoing flap-lag-torsion rotations about spring restrained <b>hinges</b> and <b>bearings.</b> This model was then modified by separating the lead-lag degree of freedom into two components, a free and a prescribed motion. Using this model, a parametric study of the effect of phase and amplitude of a prescribed lead-lag motion on hub vibration was conducted. The data gathered was analyzed to obtain an understanding of the basic physics of the problem and show the capability of this method to reduce vibration and expand the flight envelope. In the second half of the study, the similar analysis was conducted using an elastic blade model to confirm the effects predicted by the simpler model...|$|R
