40|$|Microbial sulfate {{reduction}} in acid mine drainage {{is still considered}} to be confined to anoxic conditions, although several reports have shown that sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) occur under microaerophilic or aerobic conditions. We have measured sulfate reduction rates of up to 60 nmol S cm− 3 day− 1 in oxidized layers of gold mine tailings in Kuzbass (SW Siberia). A novel, acidophilic, copper-tolerant Desulfosporosinus sp. I 2 was isolated from the same sample and its genome was sequenced. The genomic analysis and physiological data indicate the involvement of transporters and additional mechanisms to tolerate metals, such as sequestration by polyphosphates. Desulfosporinus sp. I 2 encodes systems for a metabolically versatile life style. The genome possessed a complete <b>Embden-Meyerhof</b> <b>pathway</b> for <b>glycolysis</b> and gluconeogenesis. Complete oxidation of organic substrates could be enabled by the complete TCA cycle. Genomic analysis found all major components of the electron transfer chain necessary for energy generation via oxidative phosphorylation. Autotrophic CO 2 fixation could be performed through the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. Multiple oxygen detoxification systems were identified in the genome. Taking into account the metabolic activity and genomic analysis, the traits of the novel isolate broaden our understanding of active sulfate reduction and associated metabolism beyond strictly anaerobic niches...|$|R

Here, we demonstrate that gluconeogenesis constitutes an essential metabolic pathway in Francisella pathogenesis. Indeed, inactivation of gene glpX, encoding the unique fructose 1, 6 -bisphosphatase of Francisella, severely impaired bacterial intracellular multiplication when cells were supplemented by gluconeogenic substrates such as glycerol or pyruvate. The glpX mutant also showed a severe virulence defect in the mouse model, confirming {{the importance of this}} pathway during the in vivo life cycle of the pathogen. Isotopic profiling revealed the major role of the <b>Embden-Meyerhof</b> (<b>glycolysis)</b> <b>pathway</b> in glucose catabolism in Francisella and confirmed the importance of glpX in gluconeogenesis. Altogether, the data presented suggest that gluconeogenesis allows Francisella to cope with the limiting glucose availability it encounters during its infectious cycle by relying on host amino acids. Hence, targeting the gluconeogenic pathway might constitute an interesting therapeutic approach against this pathogen...|$|R

40|$|Starch {{degradation}} with {{a rate of}} 1 to 2 microgram-atom carbon per milligram chlorophyll {{per hour}} was monitored in the isolated intact spinach (Spinacia oleracea) chloroplast which had been preloaded with 14 C-starch photosynthetically from 14 CO 2. Starch breakdown was dependent upon inorganic phosphate and the 14 C-labeled intermediates formed were principally those of the <b>Embden-Meyerhof</b> <b>pathway</b> from glucose phosphate to glycerate 3 -phosphate. In addition, isotope was found in ribose 5 -phosphate and in maltose and glucose. The appearance of isotope in the intermediates of the <b>Embden-Meyerhof</b> <b>pathway</b> {{but not in the}} free sugars was dependent upon the inorganic phosphate concentration. Dithiothreitol shifted the flow of 14 C from triose-phosphate to glycerate 3 -phosphate. Iodoacetic acid inhibited starch breakdown and caused an accumulation of triose-phosphate. This inhibition of starch breakdown was overcome by ATP. The inhibitory effect of ionophore A 23187 on starch breakdown was reversed by the addition of magnesium ions. The formation of maltose but not glucose was impaired by the ionophore. The inhibition of starch breakdown by glycerate 3 -phosphate was overcome by inorganic phosphate. Fructose 1, 6 -bisphosphate and ribose 5 -phosphate did not affect the rate of polysaccharide metabolism but increased the flow of isotope into maltose. Starch breakdown was unaffected by the uncoupler (trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone), electron transport inhibitors (rotenone, cyanide, salicylhydroxamic acid), or anaerobiosis. Hexokinase and the dehydrogenases of glucose 6 -phosphate and gluconate 6 -phosphate were detected in the chloroplast preparations. It was concluded (a) that chloroplastic starch was degraded principally by the <b>Embden-Meyerhof</b> <b>pathway</b> and by a pathway involving amylolytic cleavage; (b) ATP required in the <b>Embden-Meyerhof</b> <b>pathway</b> is generated by substrate phosphorylation in the oxidation of glyceraldehyde 3 -phosphate to glycerate 3 -phosphate; and (c) the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway is the probable source of ribose 5 -phosphate...|$|R

Potassium fluoride, an enolase inhibitor, abolished the catabolism by the <b>Embden-Meyerhof</b> <b>pathway</b> totally without affecting gluconate accumulation. Under these conditions glucose was exclusively oxidized to gluconate. Gluconate thus accumulated could be metabolized further via phosphorylation by gluconate kinase.

40|$|Eagon, R. G. (University of Georgia, Athens). Pyridine nucleotide-linked {{reactions}} of Pseudomonas natriegens. J. Bacteriol. 84 : 819 – 821. 1962 —The observation that Pseudomonas natriegens utilizes the <b>Embden-Meyerhof</b> <b>pathway</b> and the hexose monophosphate-pentose cycle only very slightly, {{even though the}} necessary enzymes are present, was explained by {{the existence of a}} sluggish system for the oxidation of reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide (TPNH). Pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase could not be detected in cell-free extracts. A very active system for the oxidation of reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide (DPNH) was observed. Thus, since lactic acid is a major end product of glucose dissimilation and since the lactic dehydrogenase of P. natriegens does not utilize DPNH as cofactor, the <b>Embden-Meyerhof</b> <b>pathway</b> apparently operates aerobically by direct oxidation of DPNH, presumably by coupling with the terminal oxidase system rather than by coupling to synthetic reactions requiring DPNH as cofactor.

Furthermore, the influence of inhibiter on them was examined {{to arrive at the}} difference of metabolism of the both types from the experimental results. The results were as follows: 1.

Each of these bacteria oxidize glucose converting into pyruvate, and a portion of glucose is converted to lactate or acetate and still other portion of it is completely oxidized. 2. In inhibitory experiments using DNP and arsenite, it has been found that each of these bacteria growing on the plain agar medium oxidizes glucose primarily by the <b>Embden-Meyerhof</b> <b>pathway.</b> 3.

Radiorespirometric measurements demonstrate an early and parallel respiration of glucose carbon atoms one and four in glucose-casein hydrolysate broth. It is concluded that the Entner-Doudoroff pathway performs an energetic role in glucose metabolism by T. intermedius with the pentose shunt and <b>Embden-Meyerhof</b> <b>pathways</b> functioning mainly in biosynthesis. The presence of thiosulfate in the growth medium inhibits the synthesis of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway and related enzymes. In addition, both thiosulfate and glucose inhibit the synthesis of the Krebs cycle enzymes, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-linked isocitrate and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenases. Thus, repression of enzymes is of significance in the adaptation of T. intermedius to its nutritional environment.

Enzyme activities of the cycle catalysing the formation of succinate from oxaloacetate were relatively higher than those catalysing other sections of the citric acid cycle, suggesting that this section of the cycle could be important to the parasite. Pyruvate carboxylase activity was more than 10 times that of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. It was suggested that pyruvate could be carboxylated to oxaloacetate.
