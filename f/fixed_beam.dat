40|$|The strawman Personal Access Satellite System (PASS) design {{calls for}} the use of a CONUS beam for {{transmission}} between the supplier and the satellite and for <b>fixed</b> <b>beams</b> for transmission between the basic personal terminal and the satellite. The satellite uses a 3 m main reflector for transmission at 20 GHz and a 2 m main reflector for reception at 30 GHz. There are several types of spot beams under consideration for the PASS system besides <b>fixed</b> <b>beams.</b> The beam pattern of a CONUS coverage switched beam is shown along with that of a scanning beam. A switched beam refers to one in which the signal from the satellite is connected alternatively to various feed horns. Scanning beams are taken to mean beams whose footprints are moved between contiguous regions in the beam's coverage area. The advantages and disadvantages of switched and/or scanning <b>beams</b> relative to <b>fixed</b> <b>beams.</b> The consequences of using switched/scanning in lieu of <b>fixed</b> <b>beams</b> in the PASS design and attempts are made to evaluate the listed advantages and disadvantages.

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} detecting, {{locating}} and quantifying the damage occurring {{in three different}} forms, namely (a) a beam with only a dominant crack, (b) a uniformly degraded beam, and (c) a uniformly degraded beam with a dominant crack. Generalised methodologies have been proposed to solve the three damage cases. <b>Fixed</b> <b>beams</b> have been considered to demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} generalised method for damage identification. The beam is loaded with a point load. The static deflection has been used as the response to perform continuous wavelet transform (CWT). The continuous wavelet transform coefficients are used to compute the Holder exponent and an Intensity factor. The intensity factor is used to relate the damage (crack damage and/or degradation) characteristics to the magnitude of the wavelet coefficients. The proposed generalised method can be used to solve the damage identification problem for all <b>fixed</b> <b>beams,</b> irrespective of changes in the magnitude of load applied, geometrical and material properties. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by validating with several numerical examples available in the literature...|$|R

5000|$|It is {{generally}} accepted {{that a few}} distinct causes lie behind different wavelengths of railroad corrugation. One study indicates that the specific short-wave railroad deformity is mainly caused by pinned-pinned resonance, in which the rail vibrates as a <b>fixed</b> <b>beam,</b> as if pinned between periodically placed sleepers. The dynamic train-track interaction that causes fixed frequency vibrations at high speeds, commonly observed in light load metro operations, and the anti-resonance caused by the pinning of the rails on sleepers, causes deformation and the [...] "roaring" [...] corrugation of the rails.|$|E

Later, he worked to refine and popularize the use of <b>fixed</b> <b>beam</b> systems.|$|E
50|$|Several other {{vertical}} boilers, {{such as the}} Straker, {{had similar}} arrangements for lifting their shells off the tube nest. The Sentinel though left the outer shell in place and instead dropped the tube nest downwards (having first removed the ashpan). This had the advantages that it required simpler lifting gear: the waggon would be raised on ramps or over a pit, the bolts removed and then the tube bank lowered with a block and tackle from a <b>fixed</b> <b>beam,</b> without requiring a mobile crane that could lift it and then move it sideways. Secondly the many pipe connections to the outer shell were left undisturbed, making the operation quicker.|$|E
