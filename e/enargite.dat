50|$|Metallurgically the {{concentrate}} {{is likely}} to be relatively complex. It will contain arsenic which could well incur smelter penalties in the early years because of the <b>enargite</b> (Cu3AsS4) {{in the top of the}} deposit.

A more serious problem is the presence of variable quantities of talc which come out with the copper/molybdenum concentrate and tend to depress the copper grade of the concentrate. Sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), will suppress the talc in the flotation process but it has the unfortunate side effect of reducing molybdenum recovery. It gives a higher grade copper concentrate but also lower recovery. A high grade copper concentrate is very desirable because smelters generally deduct 1% from the copper content which is a higher percentage of a low grade concentrate than a high one.|$|E

50|$|Copper mining, {{as well as}} gold, used to {{take place}} in Jinguashi town in Ruifang District, New Taipei. In 1904, arsenic-copper sulfate mineral <b>enargite</b> was found at the No. 3 Mine in the area when miners dug deeper, {{increasing}} the amount of copper minerals discovered. From that moment, the focus of the mining in the area shifted from gold and silver to gold, silver and copper. After the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China in 1945, the state-run Taiwan Gold and Copper Mining Bureau was established in 1946 and renamed to Taiwan Metals Mining Company in 1955. As copper production gradually increased over the years, Jinguashi mining area maintained excellent operating performance. However, after 1973, the gold and copper output began to decline. In order to increase the production, the company started large-scale open-pit mining in 1978 and shifted its focus to mineral refining and processing. To boost their mineral processing capabilities, the company took out bank loans in 1981 to build the Lile Copper Refinery in the area located at the Golden Waterfall today. Because of a collapse in the world copper price few years later, the company was unable to repay its loans and went out of business in 1987. The Taiwan Sugar Corporation assumed ownership of the land in Jinguashi and the mining in that area came to an end.|$|E
40|$|Cu- 3 (As,Sb) S- 4 {{minerals}} commonly contain structurally disordered crystals of intergrown <b>enargite</b> and the luzonite-famatinite series (Posfai and Sundberg 1998). Here {{we discuss}} {{the relationships between the}} fine-scale structural variations and the Sb/As ratios of these minerals. Although luzonite typically contains more Sb than <b>enargite,</b> individual layers of luzonite within Sb-bearing <b>enargite</b> are not associated with higher Sb/As ratios. Defect-free <b>enargite</b> can also contain Sb. We develop a ``structure-composition'' diagram in which both the structural enargite-luzonite and the compositional luzonite-famatinite solid solutions can be represented. Compositions plotted in this diagram reveal that Sb-bearing <b>enargite</b> and luzonite contain only {{a relatively small number of}} defects, whereas Sb-free crystals can be heavily disordered. Coexisting <b>enargite</b> and famatinite and zoning in luzonite-famatinite indicate fluctuations in the Sb-content of the fluid during ore deposition. On the other hand, assemblages of Sb-free <b>enargite</b> and luzonite probably reflect thermal oscillations; heavily disordered, intermediate structures may have formed near the transition temperature of low-temperature luzonite to high-temperature <b>enargite.</b> Our results suggest that characteristic microstructures in <b>enargite,</b> luzonite, and famatinite can be useful for constraining fluid composition and temperature during ore deposition...|$|E
40|$|<b>Enargite</b> surface {{reactivity}} in acidic ferric solutions simulating {{the acid}} mine drainage (AMD) environment {{has been investigated}} by X-ray photoelectron (XPS) and X-ray excited Auger electron spectroscopy (XAES) surface analysis. Natural <b>enargite</b> samples from a Peruvian mine with close to the nominal composition Cu 3 AsS 4 have been analysed after cleavage and a 24 h exposure to 0. 025 mol/l ferric acidic solutions. The results, based on the calculated modified Auger parameter α′, show that the chemical state of copper and arsenic in <b>enargite</b> does not change during immersion in acidic, oxidising solutions. The sulfur S 2 p spectrum of <b>enargite</b> is characterized by two components, one at 162. 0 ± 0. 2 eV and the other at 163. 5 ± 0. 2 eV. The lower binding energy component (162. 0 eV) is attributed to the sulfur atoms in <b>enargite.</b> Immersion {{does not change the}} chemical state of this compound. XPS/ARXPS measurements show the intensity of the higher binding energy component (163. 5 ± 0. 2 eV), located at the outermost surface of the reacted <b>enargite,</b> to increase after immersion in solutions. The chemical state plot suggests that this sulfur compound might be associated with the formation of a copper-deficient <b>enargite</b> surface layer and not with elemental sulfur. Based also on the quantitative XPS determinations, the surface of the reacted <b>enargite</b> can be described as a layered structure: a thin copper-deficient <b>enargite</b> layer (up to 0. 7 nm) is formed on a slightly sulfur-enriched <b>enargite</b> surface, the arsenic content remaining constant...|$|E

40|$|Arsenic {{contained}} in sulphides such as <b>enargite,</b> tennantite and arsenopyrite can represent a significant penalty element in base metals production. There are significant economic advantages to achieving {{a separation of}} arsenic bearing minerals {{at an early stage}} in processing, but to date no feasible widely applicable commercial method of separation at the flotation stage has been developed. This review focuses on the current state of knowledge in the selective flotation of <b>enargite,</b> commonly found in association with non-arsenic copper sulphide mineralisation. Due to its similar flotation properties with many other copper sulphides, <b>enargite</b> is typically recovered together with the copper minerals, producing a high arsenic bulk concentrate which is costly and problematic to process. Special consideration is given to the various approaches used {{in the study of the}} surface chemistry of <b>enargite</b> in different environments, and the implications for the flotation of <b>enargite.</b> Developments in the various approaches in the selective flotation of <b>enargite</b> are critically reviewed and discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{equilibrium}} distribution of arsenic and antimony between coexisting tetrahedrite-tennantite and <b>enargite</b> or famatinite {{is a function}} of temperature. Preliminary calibra-tion suggests that this distribution may provide a useful geothermometer. Experimental syntheses of coexisting tetrahedrite-tennantite and <b>enargite</b> or fama-tinite were carried out at 500 øC and 400 øC. At 500 øC the tie lines between tetrahe-drite-tennantite and <b>enargite</b> or famatinite are very nearly colinear with sulfur in the system CuaAs-CuaSb-S. With decreasing temperature, a given <b>enargite</b> coexists with increasingly more antimonian tetrahedrite-tennantite. The composition of the tetra-hedrite-tennantite in equilibrium with both <b>enargite</b> and famatinite migrates from approximately tn?o at 500 øC to tn 5 o at 400 øC. Attempts to synthesize coexisting phases below 400 ø,C are continuing. <b>Enargite</b> appears to coexist with tetrahedrite (tno-tn 5 o) immediately below 400 øC suggesting that the common association of arsenian Cua(As,Sb) S 4 and antimonian Cu• 2 (As, S. b) 4 S•a in the same deposits {{is a function of}} partitioning of arsenic and antimony under mesothermal conditions...|$|E
40|$|<b>Enargite,</b> {{a copper}} arsenic sulfide with the formula Cu 3 AsS 4 is of {{environmental}} concern {{due to its}} potential to release toxic arsenic species. The oxidation and dissolution of <b>enargite</b> are governed by the composition and chemical state of the outermost surface layer. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the <b>enargite</b> surface can be initially obtained {{on the basis of}} X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) binding energy and intensity data. However, a more precise determination of the chemical state of the principal elements of <b>enargite</b> (copper, arsenic and sulfur) in the altered surface layer and in the bulk of the mineral requires a combined analysis based on XPS photoelectron lines and the corresponding X-ray excited Auger lines. On the basis of results obtained on natural and synthetic <b>enargite</b> samples and on standards of sulfides and oxides, the Auger parameter a′ of different compounds was calculated and the Wagner chemical state plots were drawn for arsenic, copper and sulfur. Arsenic in <b>enargite</b> is found to be in a chemical environment similar to that of arsenides or elemental arsenic, whereas copper in <b>enargite</b> is in a chemical state that corresponds to copper sulfide, Cu 2 S, for all samples irrespective of surface treatment (natural or freshly cleaved). Only sulfur changed from a chemical state similar to that of copper or iron sulfide in freshly cleaved samples to another state in natural <b>enargite</b> in the as-received state. Thus, it is the sulfur atom at the surface of <b>enargite</b> that is most susceptible to changes in the <b>enargite</b> surface state and composition. A more detailed interpretation of this behavior, based on differences in the initial and final state effects, is proposed here. The concept of Auger parameter and chemical state plot, used {{here for the first time}} for investigating <b>enargite,</b> has proved to be a method to unambiguously assign the chemical state of the principal elements copper, arsenic and sulfur in these minerals...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} {{state of}} elements in <b>enargite,</b> Cu 3 AsS 4, has been traditionally interpreted assigning the monovalent (+ 1) state to copper, pentavalent (+ 5) to arsenic, and divalent (- 2) to sulphur. However, {{there are some}} evidences that make this interpretation not fully satisfying. These uncertainties refl ect on {{the understanding of the}} oxidation process of <b>enargite,</b> that has important implications for both environmental issues and mineral processing. To clarify the issue, our study involves the combined use of X-ray absorption (XAS) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies, and SQUID magnetometry. XANES spectra at the Cu K-edge for <b>enargite</b> and other copper sulphides show the expected affi nities between the spectra of <b>enargite</b> and chalcopyrite (although the pre-edge feature typical of chalcopyrite is absent in <b>enargite),</b> refl ecting the structural similarities of these two minerals; the spectra are, on the other hand, fairly similar to tetrahedrite, whose structure is different. The spectral shapes of bornite, chalcocite, and covellite are distinctly different from <b>enargite.</b> The edge position of <b>enargite</b> is consistent with the presence of monovalent copper, in spite of some small differences with respect to other sulphides where Cu is considered monovalent. At the As K-edge, the most striking feature is the clear difference in the edge position of <b>enargite</b> with respect to As(V) compounds such as calcium arsenate, and the similarity with As(III) compounds such as sodium arsenite. On the other hand, the edge position for <b>enargite</b> occurs at higher energies than those of tennantite, where As is regarded as trivalent, and of realgar (As 4 S 4), thus supporting the view that in <b>enargite</b> arsenic is in a higher valence state. <b>Enargite</b> does not show a recognizable EPR spectrum in the X band region; however, the mineral shows a rather strong bulk magnetisation, equivalent (in the hypothesis of divalent Cu) to 0. 05 unpaired electron per formula unit. The most likely explanation of this behaviour is the occurrence of small amounts of clustered paramagnetic impurities (e. g., divalent Fe). In summary, to the extent that nominal valence states can describe complex chemical bonding such as in sulphides, {{the results of this study}} rule out the occurrence of a signifi cant fraction of Cu(II) in <b>enargite,</b> and support the “traditional” assignment of a monovalent state to Cu, and pentavalent to As...|$|E
40|$|<b>Enargite,</b> Cu 3 AsS 4, {{is common}} in some deposit types, e. g. {{porphyry}} systems and high sulphidation epithermal deposits. It is of environmental concern as a potential source of arsenic. In this communication, we review the current knowledge of <b>enargite</b> oxidation, based on the existing literature and our own original data. Explicit descriptions of <b>enargite</b> oxidation in natural environments are scarce. The most common oxidized alteration mineral of <b>enargite</b> is probably scorodite, FeAsO 4. 2 H 2 O, with iron provided most likely by pyrite, a phase almost ubiquitously associated with <b>enargite.</b> Other secondary minerals after <b>enargite</b> include arsenates such as chenevixite, Cu 2 Fe 2 (AsO 4) 2 (OH) 4. H 2 O, and ceruleite, Cu 2 Al 7 (AsO 4) 4. 11. 5 H 2 O, and sulphates such as brochantite, Cu 4 (SO 4) (OH) 6, and posnjakite, Cu 4 (SO 4) (OH) 6 ·H 2 O. Detailed studies of <b>enargite</b> field alteration at Furtei, Sardinia, suggest that most alteration occurs through dissolution, as testified {{by the appearance of}} etch pits at the surface of <b>enargite</b> crystals. However, apparent replacement by scorodite and cuprian melanterite was observed. Bulk oxidation of <b>enargite</b> in air is a very slow process. However, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveals subtle surface changes. From synchrotron-based XPS it was suggested that surface As atoms react very fast, presumably by forming bonds with oxygen. Conventional XPS shows the formation, on aged samples, of a nanometer-size alteration layer with an appreciably distinct composition with respect to the bulk. Mechanical activation considerably increases <b>enargite</b> reactivity. In laboratory experiments at acidic to neutral pH, <b>enargite</b> oxidation/dissolution is slow, although it is accelerated by the presence of ferric iron and/or bacteria such as Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and Sulfolobus BC. In the presence of sulphuric acid and ferric iron, the reaction involves dissolution of Cu and formation of native sulphur, subsequently partly oxidized to sulphate. At alkaline pH, the reactivity of <b>enargite</b> is apparently slightly greater. XPS spectra of surfaces conditioned at pH 11 have been interpreted as evidence of formation of a number of surface species, including cupric oxide and arsenic oxide. Treatment with hypochlorite solutions at pH 12. 5 quickly produces a coating of cupric oxide. Electrochemical oxidation of <b>enargite</b> typically involves low current densities, confirming that the oxidation process is slow. Important surface changes occur only at high applied potentials, e. g. + 0. 74 V vs. SHE. It is confirmed that, at acidic pH, the dominant process is Cu dissolution, accompanied (at + 0. 56 V vs. SHE, pH= 1) by formation of native sulphur. At alkaline pH, a number of surface products have been suggested, including copper and arsenic oxides, and copper arsenates. XPS studies of the reacted surfaces demonstrate the evolution of Cu from the monovalent to the divalent state, the formation of As–O bonds, and the oxidation of sulphur to polysulphide, sulphite and eventually sulphate. In most natural and quasi-natural (mining) situations, it is expected that <b>enargite</b> reactivity will be slow. Moreover, {{it is likely that the}} release of arsenic will be further slowed down by at least temporary trapping in secondary phases. Therefore, an adequate management of exposed surfaces and wastes should minimize the environmental impact of enargite-bearing deposits...|$|E
