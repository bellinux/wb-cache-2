25|$|As the {{original}} {{requirement for the}} system was to provide additional information to optical instruments, accurate bearing measurements were not required. However, the system <b>did</b> <b>need</b> some {{way to ensure that}} the target being ranged was the one being tracked optically, and not another nearby target. For this role, the system used two receiver antennas mounted about one wavelength apart, so that when they were pointed directly at the target the received signals would cancel out and produce a null on the display. This was sent to a second display, who's operator attempted to keep the antennas pointed at the target.|$|E

Whilst at this point Bravo had no casualties, they <b>did</b> <b>need</b> an ammunition re-supply and were eager to know Alpha Company's location and situation. Whilst engaged in heavy fighting, Bravo lost one of their Pinzgauers to an RPG round which had detonated the fuel tank. A few minutes later and the second Pinzgauer was on fire and Bravo were having to fight through the streets to get to cover.|$|E
25|$|The torch for the 1948 London Olympics was {{designed}} by architect Ralph Lavers. They were cast in Hiduminium aluminium alloy with a length of 47cm and a weight of 960g. This classical design of a long handle capped by a cylindrical bowl re-appeared in many later torch designs. The torch used for the final entry to the stadium and the lighting of the cauldron was of a different design, also a feature that would re-appear in later years. This torch did not require the long distance duration or weather resistance of the other torches, but <b>did</b> <b>need</b> a spectacular flame for the opening ceremony. At the Melbourne Olympics of 1956, the magnesium/aluminium fuel used for the final torch was certainly spectacular, but also injured its holder. Runners were also burned by the solid-fueled torch for the 1968 Mexico Games.|$|E

500|$|Before {{and during}} the second world war, Ireland was a net food {{exporter}} and the Irish people enjoyed a high calorie diet. (Nonetheless the poor experienced real deprivation). Food was donated to war-refugees in Spain. The nation <b>did</b> <b>need</b> to import certain foods, such as fruits, tea and wheat. Nearly half of Ireland's wheat was imported from Canada. Domestic food production relied on imported fertilizer [...] and imported animal feeding stuffs. In 1940, 74,000 tons of fertilizer were imported, only 7,000 tons arrived in 1941. Similarly 5 million tons of animal feed were imported in 1940, falling to one million in 1941 and negligible quantities thereafter.|$|E
500|$|In January 1980, the {{producers}} and writers began plotting the culminating episodes for season 3. Executive producer Philip Capice says {{they decided to}} attempt {{to work in a}} ploy to hold interest over the summer. CBS ordered two extra episodes, which gave them a chance to weave many storylines into the scripts. He noted that [...] "J.R. had developed into a character we felt everyone out there wanted to see get his comeuppance. And we <b>did</b> <b>need</b> that sort of a cliffhanger to carry us over to the new season." [...] He said that there was consensus that a mystery with several suspects was optimal and that it should be a sudden event. Capice denied rumors that the shooting was a ploy to make it easy to write Hagman out of the script if his contract negotiations became too difficult. Producer Leonard Katzman, executive story consultant Art Lewis and story editor Camille Marchetta decided the actual culprit in mid-March by process of logical elimination with the belief that the audience should not be surprised by someone who was not important to the show as the shooter.|$|E
500|$|The limited series Infinite Crisis (2005), {{written as}} {{a sequel to}} the 1985 maxi-series Crisis on Infinite Earths, altered DC Comics continuity. Subsequently, all comic book titles {{published}} by DC Comics skip forward one year and a new maxi-series entitled 52 retroactively chronicles the 52 weeks which directly followed Infinite Crisis. When DC editors called for a redesign of Batwoman, comic book artist Alex Ross drew inspiration from the modified Batgirl costume he designed for Barbara Gordon, seven years prior to Kate Kane's debut in the limited comic book series 52. Ross and comic book author Paul Dini initially planned to revive the former Batgirl Barbara Gordon using {{an updated version of}} the character's original costume, with red accents in place of the traditional yellow. However, since Gordon served as one of {{a very small number of}} disabled superheroes of DC Comics as Oracle, DC's editorial staff decided to revitalize the original Batwoman instead. In an interview with Newsarama, Ross states [...] "They had me change the mask and hair to make it a bit more Batwoman, rather than Batgirl...I pointed out to them that the mask makes her look like the Huntress a little overall—but there weren't many options. The original mask that I had in there when it was to be a Batgirl design was the complete head cover that we've seen, so they <b>did</b> <b>need</b> something different from that." ...|$|E

Armament was two be three 12-pounder (3 inch, 76mm) guns, with the older 12 cwt gun chosen to save money, and two 18 in (450mm) torpedo tubes. It was realised during construction that the armament of the Tribals was too light, with the two ships ordered as part of the 1906–07 programme being armed with two 4 inch (102mm) guns. In October 1908, it was decided to strengthen the armament of the first five Tribals, including Afridi, by adding another two 12-pounder guns. This was done to Afridi prior to acceptance by the Royal Navy.|$|E
