50|$|Crohn's disease, {{like many}} other chronic, {{inflammatory}} diseases, can cause a variety of systemic symptoms. Among children, growth failure is common. Many children are first diagnosed with Crohn's disease based on inability to maintain growth. As it may manifest {{at the time of}} the growth spurt in puberty, up to 30% of children with Crohn's disease may have retardation of <b>growth.</b> <b>Fever</b> may also be present, though fevers greater than 38.5 °C (101.3 °F) are uncommon unless there is a complication such as an abscess. Among older individuals, Crohn's disease may manifest as weight loss, usually related to decreased food intake, since individuals with intestinal symptoms from Crohn's disease often feel better when they do not eat and might lose their appetite. People with extensive small intestine disease may also have malabsorption of carbohydrates or lipids, which can further exacerbate weight loss.|$|E
50|$|On January 31, 1831, Governor Roman {{took his}} {{oath of office}} {{during a time of}} storms, floods, {{economic}} depression, and epidemics. During these years of vigorous economic <b>growth,</b> yellow <b>fever</b> killed over 5,000 Louisianans, the number of banks in the state rose from 5 to 11, the Canal Bank built the New Basin Canal and the Pontchartrain Railroad began locomotive service in 1832.|$|R
50|$|Almost all {{children}} are remarkably short and have <b>growth</b> delay. <b>Fever</b> is extremely common but inconstant and is most often mild. Anemia is frequent. Other findings that have been reported include macrocephaly (95%), large fontanelle, prominent forehead, flattening of the nasal bridge (saddleback nose), short and thick extremities, and finger clubbing. The liver and/or spleen may be enlarged. Lymph node enlargement may also be present.|$|R
50|$|One factor {{limiting}} {{economic growth}} {{was the lack}} of population <b>growth.</b> Yellow <b>fever</b> had always been a threat in early Tampa, but the disease hit with terrifying regularity throughout the late 1860s and 1870s. Borne by mosquitoes from the surrounding swampland, Tampa was hit by wave after wave of yellow fever epidemics and scares throughout the period. The disease was little understood at the time, and some residents simply packed up and left rather than face the mysterious and deadly peril.|$|R
40|$|An autopsy case of {{combined}} immunodeficiency of 3 year 11 months old boy is presented. He had stomatitis, chronic protracted diarrhea, <b>fever,</b> <b>growth</b> retardation which are characteristic symptomes in severe {{combined immunodeficiency}} (SCID). IgA was low and IgG and IgM decreased towards the terminal stage. SK-SD skin reaction was negative and DNCB sensitized skin reaction was negative indicating the lack of delayed type of hypersensitivity. Compared to the typical case of primary immunodeficiency, the degree of abnormality of humoral and cellular immune functions is milder in this case. Autopsy revealed the remaining lymph nodes and histologically formation of lymphoid follicles was not distinct and lymphocyte depletion in thymic-dependent area was seen. These lesions varied in degrees depending on the location within the lymph nodes. Thymus weighed 2. 2 g and had Hassal's corpuscles with calcification. These findings are somewhat different from the typical case of primary immunodeficiency. We consider this case as suspected case or borderline case of combined immunodeficiency by correlation of clinical and histopathological aspect. Generalized cytomegalic inclusion disease is this direct cause of death...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Since April 2010, domesticated {{ducks in}} China have been {{suffering}} from an emerging infectious disease characterized by retarded <b>growth,</b> high <b>fever,</b> loss of appetite, decline in egg production, and death. The causative agent {{was identified as a}} duck Tembusu virus (DTMUV), a member of the Ntaya virus (NTAV) group within the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae. DTMUV is highly contagious and spreads rapidly in many species of ducks. More than 10 million shelducks have been infected and approximately 1 million died in 2010. The disease remains a constant threat to the duck industry; however, it is not known whether DTMUV can infect humans or other mammalians, {{despite the fact that the}} virus has spread widely in southeast China, one of the most densely populated areas in the world. The lack of reliable methods to detect the serum antibodies against DTMUV has limited our ability to conduct epidemiological investigations in various natural hosts and to evaluate the efficiency of vaccines to DTMUV. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) 1 F 5 binding specifically to the E protein was developed. Based on the mAb, a blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for the detection of neutralizing antibodies against DTMUV. The average value of percent inhibition (PI) of 350 duck serum samples obtained from DTMUV-free farms was 1. 0 % ± 5. 8 % (mean ± SD). The selected cut-off PI values for negative and positive sera were 12. 6 % (mean + 2 SD) and 18. 4 % (mean + 3 SD), respectively. When compared with a serum neutralizing antibody test (SNT) using chicken embryonated eggs, the rate of coincidence was 70. 6 % between the blocking ELISA and SNT, based on the titration of 20 duck DTMUV-positive serum samples. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The blocking ELISA based on a neutralizing mAb allowed rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of neutralization-related antibodies against DTMUV...|$|R

Both complex diseases are closely related to poor environmental factors and multiple pathogen infections, especially PRRSV and PCV 2 co-infections. The experiment is aimed to evaluate the efficacy of immunomodulant and managerial improvement on PRRSV and PCV 2 co-infection. In the first experiment, pigs will be weaned at 18 days and moved to a separate house to avoid or reduce PRRSV naturally infection. In contrast, pigs in experimental two will be weaned and raised at original management system, in which pigs will naturally exposure to PRRSV infection. Some of them will be fed with immunomodulant. Experimental pig at 9 weeks old will be inoculated with PCV 2 inocula. The <b>fever,</b> <b>growth</b> performance, pathological lesions, PCV 2 loads and antibody will be evaluated. The results of both experiments may offer some beneficial information of the improving managerial factor and immunomodulant on swine medicine in PCVAD or PRDC...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{document}} the effects of short courses of fluoroquinolones given during an outbreak of multidrug resistant typhoid fever in southern Viet Nam on the growth of children over a period of two years. In a prospective cohort study, 326 Vietnamese children aged between 1 and 14 years were followed up for two years after receiving either ciprofloxacin (70 mg/kg given over 7 d) (n = 173) or ofloxacin (45 - 50 mg/kg given over 3 - 5 d) (n = 153) for suspected typhoid <b>fever.</b> <b>Growth</b> velocity and weight for height were compared with an age matched control group of children from the same locality (n = 223) who had not contracted typhoid or received any fluoroquinolones. In the ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin treated patients there was no evidence of acute joint toxicity, nor of any joint symptoms attributable to either of the fluoroquinolones. There was no difference in expected weight for height measurements between the three groups of children over the two year period. During the first year, height velocity in ciprofloxacin treated children was greater than in either ofloxacin treated children or untreated controls. Height velocity in the latter two groups was not significantly different. After two years height velocity was similar in the three groups. The results support the use of short course fluoroquinolone treatment in childhood typhoid, especially when caused by strains resistant to other antibiotics...|$|R
40|$|The Italian Register for HIV- 1 {{infection}} in children was instituted in 1985 by the Italian Association of Pediatrics. As of March 1990, 1422 children (1321 born to seropositive mothers, 99 infected by blood products and 2 whose personal history was not available) {{were enrolled in}} our multicentre study. The number of perinatally exposed children was higher in industrialized areas and has been increasing over the years. Intravenous drug use (66. 4 %), sexual contacts with infected partner (14. 5 %) or both (15. 6 %) were the main mother's risk factors, with increasing proportion of those infected by sexual contacts (up to 21 % in 1989). The mother-to-offspring transmission rate was 19. 9 %, when assessed in first born children prospectively followed-up from birth who remained seropositive after 18 months of age. Efficiency of infection was higher in children born to symptomatic mothers, whereas it was unaffected by mode of delivery, gestational age or birthweight. The role of breast-feeding remains doubtful. The risk of infection was not increased at second pregnancy (33 siblings studied) and infection status was disconcordant only in 1 / 10 twin pairs. Perinatally exposed population consisted of 396 infants whose infection status was still indeterminate (P- 0), 388 infected children (93 P- 1), including 31 antibody-negative, viral marker-positive subjects, and 295 P- 2) and 537 uninfected children. 82. 6 % of infected seropositive children developed HIV-related clinical manifestations at a median age of 4 months. 69 (23. 4 %) P- 2 patients have died at a median age of 12 months. Decreased CD 4 + lymphocyte counts and increased serum immunoglobulin levels in {{the first months of}} life were indexes of disease progression rather than of infection status. Specific secondary infections, neurologic disorders, <b>growth</b> failure, <b>fever,</b> anemia and hepatitis were significantly and independently correlated to a poor prognosis. 688 doses of diphteria-tetanus vaccine, 476 of inactivated polyomielitis and 327 of attenuated live polyomielitis vaccine were administered in infected infants with no recorded side effects. Among bloodborne HIV- 1 infections (48 haemophilics, 41 beta-thalassemics and 10 occasionally transfused children), only anecdotal cases have been recorded after 1985, when specific preventive measures were adopted. Clinical evolution was worse in perinatally infected children when compared to that of those who acquired infection through administration of blood products. HIV- 1 {{infection in}} childhood has become a main problem in Italy. Diffusion by blood products has been widely restrained, but the increasing number of perinatally infected children indicates that further specific efforts and strategies in the field of public health are needed...|$|R
40|$|Although {{traditional}} uvulectomy, {{a procedure}} {{which consists of}} cutting away {{a part of the}} uvula, has been reported in several sub-Saharan African countries, in Maghreb and in Israel, epidemiological and anthropological data on this practice are rare. Severe complications may require hospitalization. The goal {{of this study was to}} assess the prevalence of this traditional procedure in Niamey, capital of Niger, the incidence of its severe complications and the beliefs and practices related to it. By the age of 5, 19. 6 % of the children in our survey had undergone uvulectomy. Severe complications of uvulectomy represented 7. 8 / 1000 cases of hospitalization for children under 15 years of age. Complications were infections (including tetanus), hemorrhage and passage of the cut piece of uvula further down the respiratory tract. The children who had undergone uvulectomy belonged significantly more often to the Hausa ethnic group (66. 2 %) than to the majority Zarma ethnic group (18. 3 %) or to the other ethnic groups (15. 5 %). This can be explained by the fact that, in some Hausa subgroups, uvulectomy is systematically performed on the 7 th day after birth, during the naming ceremony, to prevent death due to a 'swelling of the uvula'. In the other Hausa sub-groups and in the other ethnic groups, uvulectomy is solely a curative practice, both for children and adults, for vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, the child's rejection of the breast, <b>growth</b> retardation and <b>fever.</b> Uvulectomy is performed in Niger by the barbers, whose functions are also to perform specialized surgery. These traditional surgeons claim there is no risk to this practice. However, this study showed that incidence of severe complications (for cases admitted in the hospital) was low but that the risk of death was high for complicated cases. A dialogue between medical institutions and the barbers associations should be initiated. uvulectomy barbers epidemiology complications Niger traditional surgery...|$|R
