Confronted with the terrifying novelty of being a multicultural country, Denmark took a step not merely to the right but to the far right." [...] Professor Anders Linde-Laursen wrote that while the controversy [...] "should be understood {{as an expression of}} a growing Islamophobic tendency in Danish society," [...] this is just latest manifestation of a long-standing, and particularly deep conflict between traditionalists and agents of modernity in Denmark, and should not be seen as a major departure for Danish society.|$|E

500|$|Howard Gordon was {{inspired}} to write the episode after seeing two news reports about Project Dante, a robotic explorer created by NASA that had been sent into a volcano. Chris Carter said of the episode, [...] "I think that's the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> second season that we were telling what's one of our serial stories rather than our mythological stories. In other words, it was an X-File rather {{than one of the}} cosmology shows that explore the characters". However, Gordon felt that the episode allowed him to explore the possible results of Mulder's search for the truth, echoing this in the mindset of Daniel Trepkos and the interactions between the two characters. Gordon noted that [...] "the natural endpoint of this quest for the truth is madness", comparing Mulder's treatment of Trepkos with the events of the novel Heart of Darkness.|$|E
500|$|Anglin officially {{endorsed}} Donald Trump {{for president}} in 2015. Anglin encouraged the website's readers to [...] "vote for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> lives for the one man who actually represents our interests". The website also received national and international coverage for its endorsement of Trump's proposal of a temporary moratorium on admitting foreign Muslims into the country; it proclaimed [...] "Heil Donald Trump – The Ultimate Savior". According to the SPLC, white supremacist endorsement of Trump is unprecedented, as the movement is generally skeptical of all politicians. In July 2016, Andrew Anglin and The Daily Stormer were mentioned by Lacy Clay, Democratic Representative from Missouri, as he asked in a congressional hearing whether FBI director James Comey was aware of Trump sharing Twitter posts by white supremacists. [...] Anglin wrote in July 2016 that he believed that Trump was a pragmatic anti-Semite who praised Israel to win votes from evangelical Christians, while dropping subtle hints about purported Jewish domination of rival Hillary Clinton's campaign. The Huffington Post journalist Jessica Schulberg compared how white nationalists like Anglin and former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke believed Trump to be representative of their ethnic interests, {{while at the same}} time several Jews believed him to be representative of theirs.|$|E
500|$|Throughout 1969 and 1970, Cooper and Senator Frank Church co-sponsored the Cooper–Church Amendments, {{aimed at}} curbing further {{escalation}} of the Vietnam War. Congressional approval {{of one of these}} amendments on December 15, 1969, de-funded the use of U.S. troops in Laos and Thailand. Cooper had wanted to include a restriction on forces entering Cambodia as well, but Mike Mansfield, who helped Cooper write the amendment, feared that Cambodian Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who was officially neutral in the conflict, might be offended. When Sihanouk was deposed in 1970, Cambodia's new leader, Lon Nol, appealed to President Nixon for help in stabilizing his rule. Nixon agreed to send troops to Cambodia, despite protests from Cooper and others that this violated his stated goal of de-escalation in the region. Cooper and Church then drafted another amendment to de-fund U.S. operations in Cambodia; after negotiations with Nixon that continued funding until July 1970 so that the troops already in the country could be evacuated, the amendment passed 58–37. The House of Representatives later stripped the amendment from the legislation to which it was attached, and it did not go into effect. The amendment was nevertheless hailed by The Washington Post as [...] "the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> history that Congress has attempted to limit the deployment of American troops in the course of an ongoing war." [...] The fight over the Cooper–Church Amendments took its toll on Cooper's health, and he was briefly hospitalized to regain his strength. In 1971, Church, Mansfield, and George Aiken convinced Cooper to help them write an amendment to end U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia altogether, but ultimately, the measure did not have the support to pass and was abandoned.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} uses the radiation-induced {{grafting}} method and applies it onto poly (ethylene-alt-tetrafluoroethylene) (ETFE) for {{the synthesis of}} proton-exchange membranes by using monomers 4 -vinyl pyridine (4 VP), 2 -vinyl pyridine (2 VP), N-vinyl- 2 -pyrrolidone (NVP) followed by phosphoric acid doping. Phosphoric acid that provides Grotthuss mechanism in proton mobilization is used to transform the graft copolymers to a high temperature membrane state. Resultant proton-exchange membranes are verified with their proton conductivity, water uptake, mechanical and thermal properties, phosphorous distribution as ex situ characterization. Our most important finding as a novelty in literature is that ETFE-g-P 4 VP phosphoric acid doped proton-exchange membranes exhibit proton conductivities as 66 mS/cm at 130 °C, 53 mS/cm at 120 °C, 45 mS/cm at 80 °C at RH 100 % and 55 mS/cm at 130 °C, 40 mS/cm at 120 °C, 35 mS/cm at 80 °C at dry conditions. Moreover, ETFE-g-P 4 VP membranes still conserves the mechanical properties, i. e., tensile strength up to 48 MPa.
