50|$|The fire {{fighting}} {{needs of the}} city increased as Brisbane continued to develop. A number of <b>fire</b> <b>brigades</b> were formed early after The <b>Fire</b> <b>Brigades</b> Act Amendment Act of 1902 allowed local authorities to establish boards and brigades. Those formed were voluntary bodies with only the superintendent and immediate assistants receiving a salary. The <b>Fire</b> <b>Brigades</b> Act of 1920 rationalised the network of <b>fire</b> <b>brigades</b> in Brisbane and suburbs, centralising control under the Metropolitan <b>Fire</b> <b>Brigades</b> Board in 1921.|$|R

50|$|German <b>fire</b> <b>brigades</b> (Feuerwehr) are {{organized}} on a town/village basis, with each town having {{at least one}} brigade. In Germany there are about 25,000 local brigades - 24,000 volunteer <b>fire</b> <b>brigades</b> (Freiwillige Feuerwehr), 800 private <b>fire</b> <b>brigades</b> with public accreditation (Werkfeuerwehr), which mostly protect large industrial complexes or airports, many private <b>fire</b> <b>brigades</b> with no public accreditation (Betriebsfeuerwehr), and 100 public <b>fire</b> <b>brigades</b> (Berufsfeuerwehr) compulsory by law for large towns and cities. However, public brigades are often supported by and cooperate with volunteer brigades. Some volunteer brigades also have a small core of full-time firefighters paid by local community funds. Volunteer <b>fire</b> <b>brigades</b> are usually structured in three brigade categories (Grundausstattung, Stützpunktfeuerwehren, Schwerpunktfeuerwehren) depending on size and level of equipment. Some German <b>fire</b> <b>brigades</b> not only have firefighters, but also ambulance crews. They are estimated to have a total of 1,300,000 active members.|$|R

50|$|A {{large part}} of Finnish fire and rescue {{responsibility}} is on voluntary <b>fire</b> <b>brigades.</b> They are contracted by the municipality and are usually associations. In some municipalities, the fire fighting is entirely a voluntary <b>fire</b> <b>brigade's</b> task. There are over 600 voluntary <b>fire</b> <b>brigades</b> in the country. In 400 municipalities the voluntary <b>fire</b> <b>brigades</b> provide all the fire and rescue services. Approximately 47% of Finland's population lives in these municipalities and they make up for 95% of the country's area. The voluntary <b>fire</b> <b>brigades</b> offer approximately 15 000 trained fire fighters that are actively in service.|$|R

5|$|The {{newly built}} town proved highly {{vulnerable}} to fire. Houses {{were made of}} wood, heated with stoves and lit by candles and oil lamps; water for emergencies was wanting, especially in the frozen winters. The first major fire occurred on November 25, 1897, started accidentally by dance-hall girl Belle Mitchell. She also accidentally started a second major fire on October 14, 1898 which, {{in the absence of}} a <b>fire</b> <b>brigade</b> in Dawson, destroyed two major saloons, the post-office building and the Bank of British North America at a cost of $500,000 ($400 million). The worst fire occurred on April 26, 1899 when a saloon caught fire in the middle of a strike by the newly established <b>fire</b> <b>brigade.</b> Most of the major landmarks in the town were burned to the ground: 117 buildings were destroyed, with the damage estimated at over $1 million ($810 million).|$|E
5|$|After the war the Manchester <b>Fire</b> <b>Brigade</b> {{was again}} municipalised, and reorganised.

At about the same time, the ambulance station closed and was converted into the fire brigade's workshops. The control room was modernised in 1952, becoming the first in the country with equipment to record emergency calls.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to actively {{taking part in}} fire fighting operations within voluntary <b>fire</b> <b>brigades,</b> there are also women-specific activities in many <b>fire</b> <b>brigades.</b> They often cooperate with the youth workers in voluntary <b>fire</b> <b>brigades,</b> arrange catering services in major accident sites, provide mental help {{for the victims of}} accidents etc.|$|R
