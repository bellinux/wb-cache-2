Randomized Complete Design (RCD) by two factors treatments with two replications is used in this research. Factor I was soil reactiveness that is define as (a) low reactive= R 1; (b) moderate reactive =R 2; (c) strong reactive= R 3, and (d) very strong reactive= R 4 respectively. Factor II was drying, wetting, and <b>diluting</b> that is define as (1) drying continuously after wetting = W 1, (2) wetting continuously = W 2; (3) drying after weeting and <b>diluting</b> =W 3; and (4) wetting and <b>diluting.</b> The result of experiments show that continuous drying after wetting (W 1) and drying after wetting and <b>diluting</b> (W 3) or continuous weeting (W 2) gave soils pH lower than the weeting and <b>diluting</b> (W 4). Dried on the strong reactive soils (R 4) not decrease soil pH significantly. The continouos drying after wetting (W 1) can increase EC (electrical conductivity) higher than the continous wetting (W 2) and wetting that followed <b>diluting</b> (W 4) or drying after wetting and <b>diluting</b> (W 3).
