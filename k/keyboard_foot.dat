50|$|The Microsoft Natural Keyboard has {{had several}} {{upgrades}} and refreshes since its introduction. The {{first of these}} was the Natural Keyboard Elite, introduced in 1998. The Elite features a nonstandard layout of the key block normally found above the cursor keys. Another common criticism of the Elite is that the arrow keys' inverted-T layout has been changed into a cross-like layout, with left/right arrows keys side by side and up/down keys bracketing them from above and below, increasing {{the distance between the}} vertical keys. Another significant change was the <b>keyboard's</b> adjustable <b>feet.</b> While the original Microsoft Natural <b>Keyboard</b> had <b>feet</b> in the front, the Elite and its successors have their feet in the back. The Natural Keyboard Elite was manufactured in at least two different color schemes; white with black lettering and black with white lettering.|$|R
25|$|Mills co-composed or {{arranged}} over 150 {{pieces for}} the Star-Scape repertoire {{in collaboration with}} composer Christopher Dedrick. In 1996, Mills began composing spontaneous orchestral works, using four MIDI <b>keyboards</b> plus <b>foot</b> pedals to capture his instantaneous compositions. Critics have credited him with bridging the classical and new age genres. His goal was to approximate the sounds of real instruments {{as closely as possible}} with the keyboards, and in 2002 a CD of several of his orchestral compositions, titled Majestic Tonescape, was released, performed by musicians from the Toronto Symphony Orchestra.|$|R
5000|$|With the {{assistance}} of fellow engineer Robert Riesz, Dudley created the [...] "VODER" [...] (for [...] "Voice Operation DEmonstratoR"), a console from which an operator could create phrases of speech controlling a VOCODER with a <b>keyboard</b> and <b>foot</b> pedals; it was considered difficult to operate. The VODER was demonstrated at Bell Laboratory exhibits at both the 1939 New York World's Fair and the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition. With a woman operator sitting behind the console, phrases resembling human speech could be demonstrated to the audience, although the produced sounds were often difficult to understand.|$|R
5000|$|One of the {{earliest}} musical instruments utilizing a ring modulator may be the Melochord (1947) built by Harald Bode. It was a two-tone melody <b>keyboard</b> instrument with <b>foot</b> controllers and later added a second keyboard for timbre control, featuring a white-noise generator, envelope controller, formant filters and ring modulators for harmonics. [...] The early Melochord was extensively used by Werner Meyer-Eppler {{in the early days}} of the electronic music studio at Bonn University.|$|R
50|$|Bomb the Music Industry! has toured as a duo {{consisting}} of Rosenstock and Rick Johnson of Mustard Plug. Both carry vocal responsibilities while Rosenstock plays guitar and Johnson plays bass. Both play {{a variety of}} instruments as well, such as theremin, tub drum, and saxophone. Additionally, Rosenstock {{has been known to}} play <b>keyboard</b> with his <b>feet.</b> Often, this incarnation of the duo performs accompanied by an iPod wired into the venue's PA system that supplies all of the instruments that the duo themselves cannot perform live.|$|R
50|$|Another {{fairly common}} variant is the organ trio, {{comprising}} electric organ (typically a Hammond B-3), drums, and usually electric guitar. The bassist is excluded, and the organist instead plays the bassline {{with his or}} her left hand (on a <b>keyboard)</b> or their <b>feet</b> (on the bass pedalboard). Organists Jimmy Smith and Jack McDuff and guitarists Grant Green and Wes Montgomery are among the musicians who have worked in this format. The original line-up of the Tony Williams Lifetime featured Williams (drums); John McLaughlin (guitar); and Larry Young (organ).|$|R
50|$|The famous great Oliwa organ was {{designed}} and constructed between the years 1763 and 1788 by Johann Wilhelm Wulff (Brother Michael, a Cistercian Monk). The instrument contained 83 registers (5100 pipes), 3 manual keyboards (also manuals; Hauptwerk- great organ, Oberwerk- main organ, Kronwerk- crown organ), one <b>foot</b> <b>keyboard</b> (pedal), mechanical tracker action, and 14 wedge-shaped bellows. The console was independently located in {{the central part of}} the matroneum, which was unusual in Northern Europe at that time. The organ front was decorated with Rococo sculptures and moveable angels holding bells, trumpets, stars and suns. At that time it was the largest organ in Europe and probably also in the whole world.|$|R
2500|$|A {{carillon}} ( [...] or [...] ) is {{a musical}} instrument that is typically housed in the bell tower (belfry) of a church or municipal building. The instrument consists of at least 23 cast bronze, cup-shaped bells, which are played serially to produce a melody, or sounded together to play a chord. A traditional manual carillon is played by striking a keyboard – the stick-like keys of which are called batons – with the fists, and by pressing the keys of a pedal <b>keyboard</b> with the <b>feet.</b> The keys mechanically activate levers and wires that connect to metal clappers that strike {{the inside of the}} bells, allowing the performer on the bells, or carillonneur/carillonist to vary the intensity of the note according to the force applied to the key.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{different}} kinds of feedback in preventing mode errors was investigated. Two experiments examined the frequency of mode errors in a text editing task where a mode error was defined as an attempt to issue navigation commands while in insert mode, or an attempt to insert text while in command mode. In Experiment 1 the effectiveness of kinesthetic versus visual feedback was compared in four different conditions: the use of <b>keyboard</b> versus <b>foot</b> pedal for changing mode (kinesthetic feedback), crossed with {{the presence or absence of}} visual feedback to indicate mode. The results showed both kinesthetic and visual feedback to be effective in reducing mode errors. However, kinesthetic was more effective than visual feedback both in terms of reducing errors and in terms of reducing the cognitive load associated with mode changes. Experiment 2 tested the hypothesis that the superiority of this kinesthetic feedback was due to the fact that the foot pedal required subjects actively to maintain insert mode. The results confirmed that the use of a non-latching foot pedal for switching modes provided a more salient source of information on mode state than the use of a latching pedal. On the basis of these results we argue that user-maintained mode states prevent mode errors more effectively than system-maintained mode states. 1...|$|R
50|$|The {{carillon}} is {{a collection}} of tuned bells for playing conventional melodic music. The bells are stationary and struck by hammers linked to a clavier keyboard.The instrument is played sitting on a bench by hitting the top keyboard that allows expression through variation of touch, with the underside of the half-clenched fists, and the bottom <b>keyboard</b> with the <b>feet,</b> since the lower notes in particular require more physical strength than an organ, the latter not attaining the tonal range of the better carillons: for some of these, their bell producing the lowest tone, the 'bourdon', may weigh well over 8 tonnes; other fine bells settle for 5 to 6 tonnes. A carillon renders at least two octaves for which it needs 23 bells, though the finest have 47 to 56 bells or extravagantly even more, arranged in chromatic sequence, so tuned as to produce concordant harmony when many bells are sounded together.|$|R
5000|$|Geddy Lee's high-register vocal {{style has}} always been a {{signature}} of the band - and sometimes a focal point for criticism, especially {{during the early years of}} Rush's career when Lee's vocals were high-pitched, with a strong likeness to other singers like Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin. A review in The New York Times opined Lee's voice [...] "suggests a munchkin giving a sermon". Although his voice has softened, it is often described as a [...] "wail". His instrumental abilities, on the other hand, are rarely criticized. He has cited Jeff Berlin, Jack Casady, John Entwistle, Jack Bruce and Chris Squire as the bassists who had the biggest impact on his playing style. An award-winning musician, Lee's style, technique, and ability on the bass guitar have proven influential in the rock and heavy metal genres, inspiring such players as Steve Harris of Iron Maiden, John Myung of Dream Theater, Les Claypool of Primus, and Cliff Burton of Metallica among others. Lee is notable for his ability to operate various pieces of instrumentation simultaneously. This is most evident during live shows when Lee must play bass, sing, manipulate <b>keyboards,</b> and trigger <b>foot</b> pedals as in the song [...] "Tom Sawyer". Because of this, he remains in one place during songs with complex instrumentation. Lifeson and Peart are, to a lesser extent, responsible for similar actions during live shows.|$|R
