40|$|The study {{examined}} the determinants of <b>financial</b> <b>problems</b> and dissatisfaction {{and the degree to}} which experiencing <b>financial</b> <b>problems</b> and dissatisfaction influenced attitudes towards financial counseling in a sample of 400 young male Australian workers. Financial management practices and money attitudes significantly predicted <b>financial</b> <b>problems.</b> <b>Financial</b> management practices, money attitudes, and <b>financial</b> <b>problems</b> also significantly predicted financial satisfaction. There was no significant relationship between <b>financial</b> <b>problems</b> and dissatisfaction and financial counseling attitudes. These findings highlight the need for financial education initiatives for young male workers to be directed at facilitating changes in financial management practices and money attitudes and educational efforts to increase the social acceptability of seeking professional financial assistance for young male workers with <b>financial</b> <b>problems...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the link between <b>financial</b> <b>problems</b> and delinquency in {{adolescents and young adults}} (N = 1, 258). Using three measurement waves that covered a time span of 6 years, we conducted cross-lagged panel analyses. Overall, we found evidence that <b>financial</b> <b>problems</b> increase the risk of delinquency, and vice versa. Effects of delinquency on <b>financial</b> <b>problems</b> were larger than the other way around. In addition, a longer term (6 year) effect of delinquency on <b>financial</b> <b>problems</b> was found, whereas this effect was not found for <b>financial</b> <b>problems</b> to delinquency. Gender and age did not moderate the financial problem-delinquency link, suggesting that the bidirectional effect between <b>financial</b> <b>problems</b> and delinquency applies to adolescent and young adult males and females. Finally, we found some evidence to suggest that the indirect effects became stronger over time...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the existence and}} persistence of financial hardship at the household level {{using data from the}} British Household Panel Survey. Our modelling strategy makes three important contributions to the existing literature on household finances. Firstly, we model nine different types of household <b>financial</b> <b>problems</b> within a joint framework, allowing for correlation in the random effects across the nine equations. Secondly, we develop a dynamic framework in order to model the persistence of <b>financial</b> <b>problems</b> over time by extending our multi-equation framework to allow the presence or otherwise of different types of <b>financial</b> <b>problems</b> in the previous time period to influence the probability that the household currently experiences such problems. Our third contribution relates to the possibility that experiencing <b>financial</b> <b>problems</b> may be correlated with sample attrition. We model missing observations in the panel in order to allow for such attrition. Our findings reveal interesting variations in the determinants of experiencing different types of <b>financial</b> <b>problems</b> including demographic and regional differences. Our findings also highlight persistence in experiencing <b>financial</b> <b>problems</b> over time as well as the role that saving on a regular basis in previous time periods can play in mitigating current <b>financial</b> <b>problems...</b>|$|R

25|$|Although {{converts}} to Islam made up roughly 10% {{of the native}} population – {{most of the people}} living under Umayyad rule were not Muslim – this percent was significant due to the very small number of Arabs. Gradually, the non-Arab Muslims outnumbered the Arab Muslims, causing alarm among the Arab nobility. Socially, this posed a problem as the Umayyads viewed Islam as the property of the aristocratic Arab families. There was a rather large <b>financial</b> <b>problem</b> posed to the Umayyad system as well. If the new {{converts to}} Islam from non-Arab peoples stopped paying the jizya tax stipulated by the Qur'an for non-Muslims, the empire would go bankrupt. This lack of civil and political rights eventually led the non-Arab Muslims to support the Abbasids, despite the latter also being Arab.|$|E
25|$|After Petree's team {{began to}} run into {{financial}} problems, Nemechek's team was left without a sponsor and he left for Haas-Carter Motorsports {{to take over the}} No. 26 Kmart-sponsored Ford Taurus that Jimmy Spencer had left to drive for Chip Ganassi Racing. However, Nemechek went from one <b>financial</b> <b>problem</b> to another as Kmart filed for bankruptcy early in the 2002 season and stopped sponsoring the Haas-Carter team. This forced Haas-Carter to scale back its operations to one team and Nemechek was released in favor of keeping Todd Bodine, who was driving the team's other car, in the fold. Nemechek found an opportunity almost immediately as Johnny Benson, who was the driver of the No. 10 Valvoline Pontiac for MBV Motorsports, was injured in a crash and required a substitute. After driving several races in the No. 10 Nemechek was hired by Hendrick Motorsports to replace Jerry Nadeau in the No. 25 UAW/Delphi-sponsored Chevrolet. Nemechek drove the remainder of the season for Hendrick and performed well enough to earn a full-time ride the next season.|$|E

25|$|In 1921, General Smuts and his {{government}} wished for the early admission of Southern Rhodesia into the Union of South Africa. When the Union was established, Natal and the Free State were given representation in the Union Parliament considerably {{in excess of the}} number of their electors, and Smuts promised that this would apply in the case of Rhodesia, which would receive 12 to 15 seats in the Union Parliament, which then had 134 members. Smuts also promised that South Africa would make the financial provision necessary to buy out the commercial rights of the BSAC. If those rights continued under responsible government, they would create a serious <b>financial</b> <b>problem</b> for that government. In 1922, the company entered negotiations with the Union government for the incorporation of Southern Rhodesia. However, as the BSAC charter was due to expire on 1924, a referendum was held in 1922 in which the electorate was given a choice between responsible government and entry into the Union of South Africa. Those in favour of responsible government won a significant, but not overwhelming, majority. In 1923, the British government chose not to renew the Company's charter, and instead accorded self-governing colony status to Southern Rhodesia and protectorate status to Northern Rhodesia.|$|E

On 29 October 2010, Neighbours ratings dropped to a low figure of 386,000 viewers. Viewing numbers for Network Ten that night were down across all programmes.
