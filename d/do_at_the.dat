5|$|Davison was {{a staunch}} feminist and passionate Christian, and {{considered}} that socialism was {{a moral and}} political force for good. Much of her life has been interpreted through the manner of her death. She gave no prior explanation for what she planned to <b>do</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Derby and the uncertainty of her motives and intentions has affected how she has been judged by history. Several theories have been put forward, including accident, suicide, or an attempt to pin a suffragette banner to the king's horse; none has ever been proven.|$|E
5|$|This {{effectively}} left Pistrucci {{with little}} to <b>do</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Mint. He created several medallic works, for example a small memorial medal for the King's brother, Frederick, Duke of York in 1827 that was popular, in royal circles, mounted in rings. He was asked to design the Coronation medal after King William IV came to the throne on George's death in 1830, but declined as {{he was asked to}} copy a bust by Chantrey, and the King refused to sit for him. He created, in 1830–1831, the Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal, the first non-campaign medal of the British Army. He took twelve months to do so, a period of time Craig found unduly long. He continued to cut cameos, and to work, slowly, on the Waterloo Medal. Pistrucci's biographer, Michael A. March, tied his disinclination to work on the Waterloo Medal to his unhappiness about his position at the Mint, and he may have concluded that he would be sacked if he finished the medal. In 1836, the new Master, Henry Labouchere, stated that he felt the medal could be finished in 18 months, and offered Pistrucci payment if he would take on four apprentices and finish it. Pistrucci declined.|$|E

25|$|Each {{university}} has a Pro Day, {{during which the}} NCAA allows NFL scouts to visit the school and watch players participate in NFL Combine events together. (Some smaller universities join with nearby schools.) Essentially job fairs for prospective NFL players, Pro Days are held under the belief that players feel more comfortable at their own campus than they <b>do</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Combine, which in turn leads to better performances. College teams which produce a large quantity of NFL prospects generally generate huge interest from scouts and coaches at their Pro Days.|$|E

25|$|The {{dialogue}} {{begins with}} an unnamed friend of Socrates asking him how his pursuit of the young Alcibiades, just now reputed to be growing his first beard, was proceeding. Socrates explains that while he has just been {{in the company of}} Alcibiades, his mind is now on more interesting matters. He says that Protagoras, the wisest man alive (309c–d), is in town. Socrates relates the story of how his young friend, Hippocrates, son of Apollodorus, came knocking on his door before daybreak and roused him out of bed. Hippocrates was in a big hurry to be present when Protagoras held court, as he was expected to <b>do,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> home of Callias.|$|E
25|$|In April 2000, Rose-Tu, {{a female}} {{elephant}} {{born at the}} zoo, was severely abused by her handler, resulting in 176 lacerations including puncture wounds allegedly due to the handler attempting to shove a bullhook into her anus. It's been speculated that the trauma suffered by her {{as a result of}} this experience may have compromised her ability to raise calves. The handler was let off with a minimal sentence, the best that the state laws could <b>do</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. As a fall out from this incident, Animal Legal Defense Fund authored the Rose-Tu law, signed by Governor Kitzhaber in 2001. The law made Oregon the first state in the country to legally recognize the link between animal abuse and violence toward people, and increased the penalties for animal abuse.|$|E

25|$|Idle {{stated that}} the two things that made his life bearable were {{listening}} to Radio Luxembourg under the bedclothes and watching the local football team, Wolverhampton Wanderers. Despite this, he disliked other sports and would sneak out of school every Thursday afternoon to the local cinema. Idle was eventually caught watching the X-rated film BUtterfield 8 (suitable for audiences aged 16 years and over under the contemporary film certificates) and stripped of his prefecture, though by that time he was head boy. Idle had already refused to be senior boy in the school cadet force, as he supported the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and {{had participated in the}} yearly Aldermaston March. Idle maintains that there was little to <b>do</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> school, and boredom drove him to study hard and consequently win a place at Cambridge University.|$|E
500|$|With {{little for}} an {{archaeology}} officer to <b>do</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> OS in wartime, in mid-1941 Crawford was seconded to the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England [...] "for special duties during wartime". They assigned him {{to carry out}} a project of photographic documentation in Southampton for the National Buildings Record, producing images of many old buildings or architectural features that were threatened by the Luftwaffe's bombing campaign. He appreciated the value of this work, taking 5,000 photographs {{over the course of the}} war. In 1944, the Council for British Archaeology was founded, and while Crawford was invited to serve on its first council, he declined the offer, being lukewarm about the project.|$|E
500|$|Gjems-Onstad {{was active}} in the boy scouts before the invasion, and he was because of his {{experience}} there asked to instruct in map and compass for a volunteer military training program in late 1939. He thereafter became scout leader as the former leader went to fight in the Winter War. Due to the war in Europe, the scout exercises became increasingly serious, and the scout movement arguably had a big part in the early organisation of the Norwegian resistance. In the winter of 1939/40, Gjems-Onstad commenced training in orienteering and signaling during the night. The weekend before the invasion, he and a friend prepared [...] "for war" [...] by training and sleeping in a tent in the snow in the forest Vestmarka, which was seen as unusual to <b>do</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time.|$|E

500|$|Development {{started in}} early 1989, when the Pickford {{brothers}} were still {{learning about the}} NES and what it could <b>do.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, as being new to developing console video games, they were also learning about the market aspects and Nintendo's policies and restrictions on games. Feeling that the graphics {{in most of the}} games in the NES library were poor, they placed emphasis on the graphics and animation. Pickford was particularly pleased with the animation of the enemy eagles and their movement. Rare assisted with the sound, and all of the game's background music was composed by video game composer David Wise, who Pickford said [...] "did a fantastic job on IronSword". As far as gameplay was concerned, they tried to expand upon its predecessor, introducing more adventure-based gameplay and additional RPG elements such as magic, inns, and money.|$|E
500|$|In {{his second}} year of college, Thompson {{embarked}} {{on a trip to}} San Juan, Puerto Rico as part of an exchange program. He spent six months in an apartment with a [...] "weird, psycho roommate," [...] who later served as a direct inspiration for the Pixies song [...] "Crackity Jones;" [...] many of the band's early songs refer to Thompson's experiences in Puerto Rico. Thompson failed to learn to speak Spanish formally, and left his studies after debating whether he would go to New Zealand to view Halley's Comet (he later said it [...] "seemed like the cool romantic thing to <b>do</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time"), or start a rock band. He wrote a letter urging Santiago, with the words [...] "we gotta do it, now is the time Joe," [...] to join him in a band upon his return to Boston.|$|E

Later, Liz learns that Dot Com is in love with Grizz's fiancée, Feyoncé, Grizz is not aware of this, and that the only reason Tracy wanted to be the best man was to protect Dot Com. Finally, after changing Grizz's mind about Dot Com as his best man, Grizz appoints Liz as his woman of honor at his wedding instead.|$|E

Pam interrupts a mock basketball session the inner circle is having in the office in order to quiet it down, and an annoyed Deangelo reinvites Jim back into the circle. Jim instead challenges him to try a real dunk, which Deangelo claims he can <b>do,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> warehouse basketball hoop downstairs. Deangelo brings everyone down to the warehouse, including Dwight, who Deangelo finally loses his temper with and directly orders him downstairs or be fired. Deangelo then attempts to dunk from the free-throw line, only to severely injure himself by crashing down with the basketball stand on top of him. He is quickly taken to the hospital, leaving Dunder Mifflin Scranton without a manager.|$|E
500|$|Abbott {{initially}} {{created the}} game Confusion in the 1970s, {{and had it}} in finished form by 1980. The game was published in Germany by Franjos in 1992; Abbott was not satisfied with this version, however, due to several flaws in it. The rules {{were published in the}} Spanish translation of his book Abbott's New Card Games in 2008, but the game did not get published in North America until 2011. This Stronghold Games version was named [...] "Best New Abstract Strategy Game" [...] for 2012 by GAMES Magazine. The game is based on the idea of not knowing what your pieces are or what they <b>do</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the game. His game Eleusis uses a similar idea, in that you do not know how cards are to be played at the beginning; George Brancaccio, someone Abbott worked with at the Bank of New York, commented on this, saying [...] "In your game Eleusis, you don't know what cards can be played. Why don't you make a board game where you don't know how pieces move?" [...] This is what gave Abbott the idea, and he began work on it soon after.|$|E
500|$|Khrushchev was {{undecided}} what to <b>do</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> summit {{even as he}} boarded his flight to Paris. He finally decided, in consultation with his advisers {{on the plane and}} Presidium members in Moscow, to demand an apology from Eisenhower and a promise {{that there would be no}} further U-2 flights in Soviet airspace. Neither Eisenhower nor Khrushchev communicated with the other in the days before the summit, and at the summit, Khrushchev made his demands and stated that there was no purpose in the summit, which should be postponed for six to eight months, that is until after the 1960 United States presidential election. The U.S. President offered no apology, but stated that the flights had been suspended and would not resume, and renewed his Open Skies proposal for mutual overflight rights. This was not enough for Khrushchev, who left the summit. Eisenhower accused Khrushchev [...] "of sabotaging this meeting, on which so much of the hopes of the world have rested". Eisenhower's visit to the Soviet Union, for which the premier had even built a golf course so the U.S. President could enjoy his favorite sport, was canceled by Khrushchev.|$|E
