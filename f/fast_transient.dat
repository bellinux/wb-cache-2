5|$|<b>Fast</b> <b>transient</b> {{response}} and low distortion are both characteristic of electrostatics. The driver, being only 0.00137-inch thick and weighing only 3mg, is thus capable of stopping and starting seemingly instantaneously with no damping {{necessary to the}} drive units. However, the design also limits bandwidth to between 40Hz and 10kHz. Kohli of TNT noted that upper register starts to taper above 10kHz and then falls off severely beyond 13kHz, and is 15-20dB down at 20kHz. The speaker's design makes them extremely directional, and the general practice is to toe in the speakers to point directly to the listener. Although a slight deviation {{did not seem to}} make a difference, it is in practice not possible for more than one person to enjoy a reasonably balanced sound stage with the ESL.|$|E
5|$|When lasers {{were first}} invented, laser speckle was {{considered}} to be a severe drawback in using lasers to illuminate objects, particularly in holographic imaging because of the grainy image produced. It was later realized that speckle patterns could carry information about the object's surface deformations. Butters and Leendertz developed the technique of speckle pattern interferometry in 1970, and since then, speckle has been exploited in a variety of other applications. A photograph is made of the speckle pattern before deformation, and a second photograph is made of the speckle pattern after deformation. Digital subtraction of the two images results in a correlation fringe pattern, where the fringes represent lines of equal deformation. Short laser pulses in the nanosecond range can be used to capture very <b>fast</b> <b>transient</b> events. A phase problem exists: In the absence of other information, one cannot tell the difference between contour lines indicating a peak versus contour lines indicating a trough. To resolve the issue of phase ambiguity, ESPI may be combined with phase shifting methods.|$|E

The SOA has higher noise, lower gain, moderate polarization dependence and high nonlinearity with <b>fast</b> <b>transient</b> time. The main advantage of SOA is that all four types of nonlinear operations (cross gain modulation, cross phase modulation, wavelength conversion and four wave mixing) can be conducted. Furthermore, SOA can be run with a low power laser.|$|E

40|$|Transformers {{connected}} at the medium-voltage {{level in}} cable grids, such as wind park collection grids and industrial grids, {{are exposed to}} the stress of very <b>fast</b> <b>transients.</b> These electric transients are mainly generated during breaker switching operations and the rise time of the transient voltage in such systems is much shorter compared to the rise times of transients generated in transmission systems at a high-voltage level. In this paper, the internal voltage stress is studied during very <b>fast</b> <b>transients</b> generated during transformer energization. Instead of using a breaker, the energizing tests are performed using a low-impedance pulse generator that can generate lightning impulse-shaped waveforms and voltage steps with rise times varying between 35 and 500 ns. Experiments show that during very <b>fast</b> <b>transients</b> with a 35 -ns rise time and 1 -p. u. magnitude, the interturn voltage exceeds the level obtained with a lightning impulse-shaped voltage waveform of 4. 4 pu. Furthermore, during a specific switching scenario with delta-connected transformers, where the winding is excited from both ends, the same 1 -p. u. / 35 -ns voltage step generates an interturn voltage that exceeds the 1 -p. u. level, which is more than 2. 5 times higher voltage stress than during a lightning impulse test...|$|R
