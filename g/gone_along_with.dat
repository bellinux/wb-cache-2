5|$|The storyline {{also saw}} Franks film scenes {{alongside}} Steve McFadden, who plays Phil Mitchell, {{for the first}} time since their controversial drugs storyline in 2010. Ian told Phil about Rainie's blackmail, and Phil took Rainie to the allotments to 'deal with her'. He later told Ian that she would not be a 'problem' any longer, leaving Ian fearful of what lengths Phil had gone to. Phil was later revealed to have set Rainie up in a flat, but when his fiance Sharon Rickman (Letitia Dean) discovered what he was doing she ordered him to let Rainie go as she was not his problem. As a result, he abandoned Rainie on Cora's doorstep, where Rainie promises to get clean with Cora's help. Ian's actions were revealed when Rainie, depressed after a confrontation with Mick Carter and his family, told Denise about their night together. Cora and Rainie have a heart to heart, but when Cora heads out for a short time, she returns and find Rainie <b>gone</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> her purse.|$|E

25|$|On {{at least}} one occasion, a sports-writing {{assignment}} actually took Masterson {{out of the country}} to Cuba. On April 5, 1915, the 61-year-old Bat Masterson was in Havana, Cuba, attending the heavyweight championship fight between Jack Johnson and Jess Willard. As he arrived, he posed for a newsreel cameraman. He was now quite portly. The mustache of his younger days was long <b>gone</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> most of the hair on top of his head. In the brief film clip, he removes his hat, smiles for the camera, and replaces the hat on his head. Twenty-eight stills from this film can be viewed in a 1984 book on Masterson. Later that day, in the official film made of the fight, Bat can be seen as one of the seconds for Jess Willard, climbing through the ropes just {{prior to the start of}} the fight.|$|E

25|$|The {{continuous}} occupation from Igneri to Taíno times, {{the presence}} of the large stone constructions, {{the presence of}} shell middens and stratified deposits, all afford an opportunity to investigate some of the major substantive and theoretical problems in Caribbean archeology. Besides lending itself to the traditional problems of culture, history and chronology, the site provides the ideal setting {{for the study of the}} cultural processes responsible for the transition from Igneri to Taíno cultural manifestation. There has been some controversy in the literature as to whether there was a direct unilinear, in situ, transition from one to the other or whether the two manifestations actually represent two different groups. The data at this site can contribute significantly to the resolution of this research problem, as well as to other basic questions pertaining to the changes in sociopolitical organization which may have <b>gone</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> the changes evidenced in the material culture.|$|E
25|$|Dumouriez was {{at heart}} a monarchist and King Louis XVI had been {{executed}} on 21 January 1793. He planned {{to lead the}} army to Paris and overthrow the National Convention. He negotiated with the Austrians to cooperate by not invading France while her borders were undefended. On 1 April, when the War Minister Pierre de Ruel, marquis de Beurnonville and the government commissioners arrived at his headquarters in Saint-Amand-les-Eaux to demand answers, Dumouriez arrested them and handed {{them over to the}} Austrians. The plan quickly unravelled when the plotters failed to seize control of the frontier fortresses. In one incident, Louis-Nicolas Davout's volunteer battalion fired on Dumouriez. While the cavalry and some of the regular infantry might have <b>gone</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> the scheme, the artillery and the volunteers, pro-Revolution to the core, refused to follow their general. On 5 April 1793, Dumouriez defected to the Austrians with Duke Louis of Chartres, Jean-Baptiste Cyrus de Valence and other officers. With the plot in ruins, the Austrians resumed hostilities.|$|E
25|$|Despite his militarist {{convictions}} at {{this time}} Collins found the psychological strain caused by {{his involvement in the}} terrorist war increasingly difficult to deal with. His belief in the martial discipline of IRA's campaign had been seriously undermined by the event of the assassination of Norman Hanna, a 28 year old Newry man on the 11 March 1982 in front of his wife and young daughter, who had been targeted because of his former service with the Ulster Defence Regiment, which he had resigned from in 1976. Collins had opposed the targeting of Hanna on the basis that it wasn't of a governmental entity, but had been over-ruled by his superiors, and he had <b>gone</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> the operation; his conscience burdened him afterwards about it though. His uneasy state was further augmented by being arrested under anti-terrorism laws on two occasions, the second involving his detention at Gough Barracks in Armagh for a week, where he was subject to extensive sessions of interrogation in 1985 after an IRA mortar attack in Newry, which had claimed the lives of multiple police officers. Collins had not been involved in this operation, but after five days of incessant psychological pressure being exerted by R.U.C. specialist police officers, during which he had not said a word, he mentally broke, and yielded detailed information to the police about the organization. As a result of his arrest he was dismissed from his career with H.M. Customs & Excise Service.|$|E

500|$|The {{price of}} Altair BASIC to {{customers}} who purchased additional memory and I/O boards from MITS was $75. Users may have <b>gone</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> {{that if the}} memory board were reliable. Customers bought the computer from MITS, and working memory from companies like Processor Technology. Rather than pay $500 for BASIC, they would acquire bootleg copies of the software. Only about {{ten percent of the}} early customers actually purchased BASIC. With a royalty due of $30 per copy, Gates felt that the computer hobbyist were stealing money from him. In February 1976 Bill Gates, [...] "General Partner, Micro-Soft", wrote an [...] "Open Letter to Hobbyists" [...] that was sent to every computer publication insinuating that the hobbyists were thieves.|$|E
500|$|Wang had {{initially}} <b>gone</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> {{the writing on}} the show until {{towards the end of the}} second season when he asked the production writers if he could have some action scenes and perhaps a romance. He had realised at the time that he was the only member of the main cast without a stunt double as he had never had an action scene that required one. This resulted in the Brannon Braga penned [...] "", to which Wang said to Rick Berman that there wasn't a need to give him all his requests in a single episode. Following that, he became more involved in suggestions for character direction, but the writers avoided giving Kim more of a comedic element similar to The Doctor (Robert Picardo) and Neelix (Ethan Phillips). Wang described himself as someone who tells jokes and makes impersonations on sets and was disappointed at not being able to utilise this nature. The producers at one point had planned to permanently kill off Harry Kim during season three, but after Wang was included in the People list of sexiest people alive 1997, the plan was abandoned.|$|E

2500|$|In 1930 the Labor {{government}} {{headed by}} James Scullin appointed Evatt as the youngest-ever {{justice of the}} High Court of Australia. Regarded {{by some as a}} brilliant and innovative judge, he delivered a number of minority judgments, several of which were adopted by High Court majorities decades later. Evatt could, however, be partial on the bench. Sir Owen Dixon noted in Australian Woollen Mills Ltd v F.S. Walton & Co. Ltd (1937 58 CLR 641) that Evatt was on that occasion [...] "full of antagonism to the respondent ... Most unjudicial."

2500|$|... "Rape {{victims are}} blamed more when they resist the attack {{later in the}} rape {{encounter}} rather than earlier (Kopper, 1996), which seems to suggest the stereotype that these women are engaging in token resistance (Malamuth & Brown, 1994; Muehlenhard & Rogers, 1998) or leading the man on because they have <b>gone</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> the sexual experience thus far. Finally, rape victims are blamed more when they are raped by an acquaintance or a date rather than by a stranger (e.g., Bell, Kuriloff, & Lottes, 1994; Bridges, 1991; Bridges & McGr ail, 1989; Check & Malamuth, 1983; Kanekar, Shaherwalla, Franco, Kunju, & Pinto, 1991; L'Armand & Pepitone, 1982; Tetreault & Barnett, 1987), which seems to evoke the stereotype that victims {{really want to have}} sex because they know their attacker and perhaps even went out on a date with him. The underlying message of this research seems to be that when certain stereotypical elements of rape are in place, rape victims are prone to being blamed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Salvatore [...] "Sal" [...] Romano (Bryan Batt); regular Seasons 1–3: The Italian-American former art {{director}} at Sterling Cooper. Sal is a closeted homosexual. Reluctant to act upon his homosexuality, he twice avoids sexual encounters with different men. By 1962, Sal has married Kitty, who seems unaware of Sal's sexual orientation, yet begins {{to realize that}} something is amiss in their relationship. The issue of being closeted for Sal is shown in brief but stark contrast against the newly evolving social attitudes toward homosexuality. Sal's secret crush on Ken Cosgrove comes uncomfortably and awkwardly close to being revealed during a dinner in Sal's apartment. Later, when a recently hired young advertising exec, Kurt, casually announces his homosexuality, Sal remains painfully silent while his fellow co-workers speak disparagingly about Kurt. In the premiere of Season 3, Sal has a brief interrupted homosexual encounter with a hotel employee while in Baltimore, {{the end of which}} Don accidentally witnesses. Don, who {{was in the midst of}} a heterosexual encounter of his own at the same hotel, finesses this uncomfortable situation through a coded conversation about their current client, London Fog. He suggests the tagline [...] "Limit your exposure." [...] Later in Season 3, Sal rebuffs the sexual advances of Lee Garner Jr., the drunken playboy son of Lucky Strike's founder and a key client. Angered by the rejection, the client demands Sal be removed from the campaign and Roger fires Sal in order to appease the client and keep his $25 million account. In a conversation right after the firing, Don explains the agency cannot risk losing Lucky Strike and implies Sal should have <b>gone</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> Garner Jr. At the end of the episode, Sal is seen calling his wife Kitty from a phone booth (presumably in Central Park), in an area frequented by gay men cruising for sex. On the phone, Sal explains to Kitty he would be working late that night. Sal never appeared again in the series.|$|E
