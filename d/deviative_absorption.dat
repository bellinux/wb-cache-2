30|$|A {{number of}} radio {{experiments}} were conducted at Ahmedabad (23 °N, 73 °E) {{with the aim}} of studying the ionospheric effects of the total solar eclipse of 11 August 1999. Rapid radio soundings from the ionosonde were made on the eclipse day and on control days. A riometer was operating at 30 MHz, and field strength measurements along the three oblique incidence paths of Colombo-Ahmedabad (11905 kHz), Bombay-Ahmedabad (558 kHz) and Rajkot-Ahmedabad (810 kHz) were also made. A reduction of about 20 % was observed in the minimum frequency of reflection from the ionosonde (fmin), which indicates a reduction in D-region ionization. The critical frequency of the E-layer was not measurable beyond 1600 h IST on eclipse day due to the strong blanketing sporadic-E, but there is a 20 % decrease in the critical frequency of the F 1 -layer. Although there was no change in the minimum virtual height of the F-layer on eclipse day, there {{appears to have been a}} decrease in the height of maximum ionization (hpF 2) during the eclipse, indicating a reduction in the thickness of the F-layer. The signal strength of the Colombo-Ahmedabad path shows an initial rapid increase with the start of the eclipse (indication of a decrease in ionization in the D- and lower E-regions), but subsequently decreases until the maximum of the eclipse (excessive <b>deviative</b> <b>absorption</b> because of the wave penetrating to the E-region). The field strength measurements of the Bombay-Ahmedabad path show a large fading after sunset as the sky wave also appeared. On eclipse day the fading started about an hour earlier. Riometer recordings also show a higher signal during eclipse day, which again indicates an eclipse-associated decrease in ionization.|$|E
40|$|The {{region of}} the {{ionosphere}} situated above the E layer peak and below the F layer is difficult to investigate using conventional ground based techniques, consequently our knowledge of this region is limited. An attempt {{has been made in}} this study to construct representative electron density distributions from a consideration of the fine structure observed on ionospheric sounding records and of the variation of the absorption and virtual height of a fixed frequency during the growth of the ionosphere below 200 km following the sunrise. Special reference was made to the results obtained for frequencies reflected near the E layer peak and the validity of this analysis in this region of high <b>deviative</b> <b>absorption</b> and group retardation is discussed. Attention is drawn to the large variation in published values of the collisional frequency above 120 km and an attempt has been made to construct a suitable height variation of this parameter for use in the calculation of absorption. Routine ionospheric soundings were made hourly over an extended period and augmented with continuous soundings on a number of selected days between February and June 1969. Also on 42 days during this period, measurements of absorption and virtual height were carried out on a fixed frequency for several hours following the sunrise. The variations of absorption with time and virtual height with time and frequency were computed from the electron density profiles obtained from 3 independent sources (a) Theoretical post sunrise profiles constructed by Bourne, Setty and Smith. (b) Monotonic profiles computed from Leicester Ionograms (c) Profiles observed by a Thomson Scatter technique at R. R. E. Malvern. The results of these calculations are compared directly with the experimental observations and computations of the variation of absorption with frequency are also discussed. From a synoptic study of the cusp features observed on ionospheric soundings it is found that complex cusp structure around f E is a regular phenomenon at Leicester occurring throughout the day but showing some decrease in occurrence frequency towards noon. The development of this structure can be represented by an expression of the form fcusp = A cosn x where different cusp features take differing values of the constant A. The comparisons made in this study indicate that the polynomial reduction technique produces monotonic electron density profiles which satisfactorily represent conditions when only the virtual height is considered but are not capable of producing calculated absorption values to the same degree of accuracy. The virtual height and absorption values computed from the Thomson Scatter profiles are in good agreement with experimental observations of these parameters at Leicester. These profiles are therefore considered to accurately represent the structure of the electron density distribution. The existence of the small undulations, as evident in these profiles, is shown to account for the multi-cusp phenomenon and various observations concerning the variability and extent of such structures are described. In addition, these comparisons have indicated some inadequacy in the growth theory employed in the derivation of the Bourne, Setty and Smith profiles. As a result of comparing the variation with frequency of both the virtual height and absorption it has been shown experimentally and supported theoretically that indicating that absorption especially in the deviative region may be a more sensitive parameter to profile fine structure. It is anticipated therefore that sweep frequency absorption sounding may indicate more clearly short term perturbations in the electron density profile. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|E
