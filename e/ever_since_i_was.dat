25|$|I cannot {{forget that}} <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a child Fitzwilliam has been, in all situations, my warmest and most affectionate friend, {{and the person}} in the world of whom decidedly I have the best opinion, and so in most respects I have still, but as a {{politician}} I cannot reconcile his conduct with what I (who have known him for more than five-and-thirty years) have always thought to be his character. I think they have all behaved very ill to me, and for most of them, who certainly owe much more to me than I do to them, I feel nothing but contempt, and do not trouble myself about them; but Fitzwilliam is an exception indeed.|$|E
500|$|In November 2013, the Halcyon Gallery in London mounted Mood Swings, an {{exhibition}} in which Dylan displayed seven wrought iron gates he had made. In a statement {{released by the}} gallery, Dylan said, [...] "I've been around iron all my life <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a kid. I {{was born and raised}} in iron ore country, where you could breathe it and smell it every day. Gates appeal to me because of the negative space they allow. They can be closed but at the same time they allow the seasons and breezes to enter and flow. They can shut you out or shut you in. And in some ways there is no difference." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the second}} half of 1814, {{following}} his long and almost continuous campaigns throughout Europe during the last ten years, the health of General Nansouty badly deteriorated. He was suffering from his wounds, some of which were very recent, but, above all from war fatigue. On his death bed, he is recorded to have said: [...] "I have carefully reflected upon all my action <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> born and in all my life, I have not done anyone wrong." [...] He is also said to have reasserted his Christian faith and to have asked that his son be recommended for the King's protection, as a favour for his services. Just before passing away, he told his son that his heritage would be to follow his example and live an honourable and blameless life. General Count Étienne-Marie-Antoine-Champion de Nansouty died on 12 February 1815 in Paris, leaving behind his wife and their only son. A pension of 6,000 Francs per year was granted to the General's widow by the King of France. His final resting place is at the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, division 27. The engraving on his tombstone reads: ...|$|E

Simply ask him for a {{confirmation}} of the existing situation." ...|$|R
500|$|At the 2012 London Paralympics, Cole {{participated in}} eight events and won six medals. In her first event, the 100m Butterfly S9, she {{finished}} fourth, while South Africa's Natalie du Toit finished first. However, the following night, Cole won the 100m Backstroke S9, winning her first gold medal {{of the games}} in Australian record time. She told the press that it had [...] "been a goal of mine <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> 12 years old to beat Natalie du Toit" [...] who was [...] "kind of like the Michael Phelps of swimming for me, {{she has been a}} great mentor and relaxes me in the marshalling room. She is my biggest hero." [...] Cole won a second gold medal in the 4 x 100m freestyle relay 34 pts, this time in World Record time. In the 400m Freestyle S9, she was again beaten by du Toit, who finished first, while Cole took bronze. Cole won a second bronze in the 50m Freestyle S9, in which du Toit finished seventh, and then gold in the 100m Freestyle S9, in which du Toit finished third. Cole capped off the games, surprising even herself with a fourth gold medal, in the 4 x 100m freestyle relay 34 pts, again in Australian record time.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Opeth {{wrote and}} {{recorded}} the new track, [...] "The Throat of Winter", which {{appeared on the}} digital EP soundtrack of the video game, God of War III. Åkerfeldt described the song as [...] "odd" [...] and [...] "not very metal." [...] To celebrate their 20th anniversary, Opeth performed a six-show, worldwide tour called Evolution XX: An Opeth Anthology, from March 30 through April 9, 2010. Blackwater Park was performed in its entirety, along with several songs never before performed. The concert of April 5, 2010, at the Royal Albert Hall in London, England was filmed for a DVD and live album package titled In Live Concert at the Royal Albert Hall. The set was released on September 21, 2010, in 2-DVD and 2-DVD/3-CD configurations. For the DVD the concert was split into two sets. The first set consists of the entire Blackwater Park album, while the second set contains one song from every album excluding Blackwater Park, in chronological order representing the twenty years of [...] "evolution" [...] in their music. Åkerfeldt stated, [...] "I can't believe it, but, fuck, we're celebrating 20 years. I've been in this band <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> 16. It's insane." [...] A special edition of Blackwater Park was released in March 2010 {{to coincide with the}} tour.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson's solid-bronze casket (which {{reportedly}} cost USD $25,000) {{was placed}} in front of the stage. Numerous celebrity guests attended the services. His brothers each wore a single, white, sparkling glove, while Stevie Wonder, Mariah Carey, Lionel Richie, Jermaine Jackson and others sang his songs. Jackson's then 11-year-old daughter, Paris, broke down as she told the crowd, [...] "I just want to say, <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> born, Daddy has been the best father you could ever imagine ... and I just want to say I love him... so much." [...] Marlon Jackson said, [...] "Maybe now, Michael, they will leave you alone." ...|$|E

2500|$|John Clayton of ESPN {{stated that}} Russell's {{workouts}} at the 2007 NFL Combine that Russell's arm strength and size impressed several teams, and predicted {{that it would}} [...] "be hard to pass up on Russell at #1." [...] At the combine, Russell stated about his size, [...] "I've been playing quarterback <b>ever</b> <b>since.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> always bigger and taller than the other kids, and I was always able to throw it a pretty good length of the field." [...] Cleveland Browns General Manager Phil Savage said of Russell's abilities, [...] "His talent is substantial. He's a rare combination of size and arm strength." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some Hindus {{claim that}} the beliefs {{presented}} in the novel conform to the teachings of Hinduism, though Matheson denied any direct influence. Raised a Christian Scientist, Matheson gradually developed what he called his own religion, taking elements from many sources. [...] "As a Pisces," [...] he explained, [...] "I have been fascinated about parapsychology, metaphysics and the supernatural <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a teenager. The concepts in the book are derived from my wide range of reading." [...] One of Matheson's influences was Harold W. Percival, an adherent of Theosophy, a belief system with a strong Eastern and Hindu influence.|$|E
2500|$|Stone grew up {{listening}} {{to a wide variety of}} music including 1960s and 1970s American R and soul music performed by such artists as Dusty Springfield and Aretha Franklin. As a result, she developed a soulful style of singing like her idols. [...] "My first CD that I owned was Aretha Franklin: Greatest Hits. And I saw the advert on TV and it was just like little clips of her songs. I had no idea who she was—I was only like 10 so. I said, 'Oh yeah, that looks really good', so I wrote it down and I said to my mum, 'Can I have that for Christmas?' So she told my friend Dennis, who always gets me good music anyway, and he got that for me. So that was one of my first albums that I loved." [...] She would later tell MTV News: [...] "I kind of clicked into soul music more than anything else because of the vocals. You've got to have good vocals to sing soul music and I always liked it <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> little." ...|$|E

2500|$|His {{music has}} been noted for its diversity, with Dusted {{saying that he had}} been [...] "defying strict genre classifications since the early nineties, {{swapping}} labels, styles, partners, motifs, and recording techniques as the desire has struck him". He has been recording for most of his life, telling Foxy Digitalis that [...] "I've made music as long as I can remember - <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a child - and recorded the stuff as long as I've had the technology - I began with a cheap cassette player. So, it's strange to think what it'd be like not to make or record music. It seems unnatural!". When reviewing his 1996 CD Festival, Melody Maker described him as [...] "grand-meister of contemporary British improv, spiritual son of Eddie Prevost and Maddy Prior; gentle manipulator of English hymn-notics and religious incantations; protege, challenger and radicaliser of folk, blues, rock, minimalism and improvisation; translator for the sea and the rain and the sky; ambassador to war and peace, to love and anguish".|$|E
2500|$|Klaw also {{produced}} {{a line of}} still photos taken during these sessions. Some have become iconic images, such as his highest-selling photo of Page—shown gagged and bound {{in a web of}} ropes, from the film Leopard Bikini Bound. Although these [...] "underground" [...] features had the same crude style and clandestine distribution as the pornographic [...] "stag" [...] films of the time, Klaw's all-female films (and still photos) never featured any nudity or explicit sexual content. Commenting on the bondage photos and the reputation they afforded her, Page said retrospectively: They keep referring to me in the magazines and newspapers and everywhere else as the [...] "Queen of Bondage." [...] The only bondage posing I ever did was for Irving Klaw and his sister Paula. Usually every other Saturday he had a session for four or five hours with four or five models and a couple of extra photographers, and in order to get paid you had to do an hour of bondage. And that was the only reason I did it. I never had any inkling along that line. I don’t really disapprove of it; I think you can do your own thing as long as you’re not hurting anybody else — that’s been my philosophy <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a little girl. I never looked down my nose at it. In fact, we used to laugh at some of the requests that came through the mail, even from judges and lawyers and doctors and people in high positions. Even back in the ’50s they went in for the whips and the ties and everything else.|$|E

60|$|The {{severity}} of the winter in America (which was quite exceptional even in that rigorous climate), combined with the hard work I had to do, tried me a good deal.
