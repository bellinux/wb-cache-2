5000|$|Crimidine is a <b>fast</b> <b>acting</b> convulsant, with an LD50 of 5mg/kg. Earliest {{symptoms}} {{can develop}} within 20-40 minutes. These symptoms can include burning, irritation, and itching {{at the site}} of exposure or intake. Following these initial symptoms, convulsions follow and can be fatal. Low dose, long-term exposure can lead to damage in the central nervous system, resulting in muscle stiffness, restlessness, and sensitivity to light and noise. [...] Although crimidine is <b>fast</b> <b>acting,</b> it is also quickly secreted and can pass through the system in less than 24 hours.|$|R

40|$|The {{amount of}} Distributed Generation (DG - often from {{renewable}} energy sources) {{connected to the}} power system is increasing. DG typically requires a Power Electronic Converter (PEC) interface to connect to the main network. These PEC interfaces generally have a low tolerance to overcurrent and rely on extremely <b>fast</b> <b>acting</b> protection which is integral to the PECs' control systems. As the proportion of PEC interfaces increases, their <b>fast</b> <b>acting,</b> self-preserving, protection functions may have a detrimental effect on system protection and supply availability. The main goal {{of this paper is}} to investigate potential problems for network protection in 'PEC-dense' power systems at the distribution level and discuss potential solutions to these problems...|$|R

50|$|Recommended {{management}} include {{lifestyle changes}} such as avoiding potential triggers. Treatments for acute attacks include oxygen or a <b>fast</b> <b>acting</b> triptan. Measures recommended to decrease the frequency of attacks include steroid injections, civamide, or verapamil. Nerve stimulation or surgery may occasionally be used if other measures are not effective.|$|R
50|$|Nitrovasodilators are {{contraindicated}} under {{circumstances where}} lowering of blood pressure can be dangerous. This includes, with some variation {{between the individual}} substances, severe hypotension (low blood pressure), shock including cardiogenic shock, and anaemia. Whether a specific drug is useful or harmful under heart failure and myocardial infarction depends on its speed of action: <b>Fast</b> <b>acting</b> substances such as glyceryl trinitrate and nitroprusside can be helpful for controlling blood pressure and consequently the amount of blood the heart has to pump, if the application is monitored continuously. Slow acting substances would hold the danger of ischaemia due to an uncontrollably low blood pressure and are therefore contraindicated. Depending on the circumstances, even <b>fast</b> <b>acting</b> substances can be contraindicated - for example, glyceryl trinitrate in patients with obstructive heart failure.|$|R
50|$|Thunderbird was the Army's only heavy {{anti-aircraft}} missile. As missile {{systems like}} Thunderbird made flight at medium and higher altitudes practically suicidal, nap-of-the-earth flying became the norm and even shorter-range, <b>faster</b> <b>acting</b> systems were needed. Thunderbird's role {{was taken over}} by the much smaller BAC Rapier as they became available.|$|R

50|$|The core {{material}} for imaging brain activity with voltage-sensitive dyes are the dyes themselves. These voltage-sensitive dyes are lipophilic and preferably localized in membranes with their hydrophobic tails.

5000|$|NPH insulin may be {{combined}} with <b>faster</b> <b>acting</b> insulin to allow more accurate dosing and better blood sugar level control. When administered this way, the two insulin types will normally {{be combined}} in the same syringe. NPH and fast-acting insulin bind when mixed, so {{they should not be}} combined until it is time to inject. People are instructed on the proper procedure to prepare this type of injection to minimize the likelihood of combining two types of insulin in the same vial. The proper order for withdrawing NPH insulin and fast-acting insulin into the same syringe can be remembered by the mnemonic [...] "clear before cloudy", or <b>fast</b> <b>acting</b> clear insulin first, followed by NPH (cloudy). Aspiration, or pulling back on the plunger of the syringe after the needle has been injected to check for blood, is not appropriate for subcutaneous injections.|$|R
50|$|The {{blood of}} dragons is {{poisonous}} to most other creatures, including humans. The poison consumes the victim with chills, blurs vision, makes {{him or her}} dizzy, and induces vomiting.

25|$|Ionotropic receptors, {{otherwise}} known as ligand-gated ion channels, are <b>fast</b> <b>acting</b> receptors that mediate neural and physiological function by ion channel flow with ligand-binding. Nicotinic, GABA, and Glutamate receptors are {{among some of the}} cell surface receptors regulated by ligand-gated ion channel flow. GABA is the brain's main inhibitory neurotransmitter and glutamate is the brain's main excitatory neurotransmitter.|$|R

30|$|We use {{extensive}} {{computer simulation}} to design (and test) a high pressure, <b>fast</b> <b>acting,</b> pulsed, valve {{that can produce}} short pulses of gas.
