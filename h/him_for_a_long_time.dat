500|$|One of Rhys' first storylines saw him {{caught up}} in Karl and Susan Kennedy's marital problems. Rhys is the {{attending}} physician to Jim Dolan (Scott Parmeter), a man befriended by Susan. At first, Rhys is not aware that Karl and Susan are going through a difficult time in their marriage as he is [...] "solely concerned" [...] with Jim's well being. Rhys is annoyed by Susan's interference with his patient and Barber told a columnist for Inside Soap [...] "He wants him to have chemotherapy, but Karl tells Susan it will only prolong Jim's suffering, not save his life. Susan tells that to Jim, which Rhys doesn't like." [...] Karl later takes over as Jim's physician and Rhys steps back and watches the situation unfold.

2500|$|Greece {{issued a}} postage stamp in his honour (1996) and a prepaid {{telephone}} card (1996). However, the Greek state {{after the fall of}} the Colonels did not honor <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> For instance, his actions are not mentioned in school textbooks, with very few exceptions. There is still growing suspicion regarding this, given that a minority of active current politicians in Greece are allegedly linked to the Colonels' regime and do not wish to promote Panagoulis' deeds. The Greek Ministry of Culture (under the minister Evangelos Venizelos) refused to contribute €1,500 in order to facilitate the translated publication of Panagoulis' poems. This has changed during the last years: by 2008, 22 streets in Athens and its suburbs are named after him and a metro station in Athens (Agios Dimitrios, which is close to the place of his death) was renamed to carry his name (...)

2500|$|Christopher, a fifteen-year-old {{boy with}} an autism {{spectrum}} condition, {{lives with his}} father, who has {{told him that his}} mother, Judy, died two years ago. The boy discovers the dead body of the neighbour's dog, Wellington, speared by a garden fork. Mrs Shears, the dog's owner, calls the police, and Christopher comes under suspicion. When a policeman touches him, he hits the policeman, and is arrested, then released with a police caution. He decides to investigate the dog's death, despite his father's orders to stay out of other people's business. He is severely limited by his fears and difficulties when interpreting the world around him. Throughout his adventures, Christopher records his experiences in a book, which he calls a [...] "murder mystery novel". During his investigation, Christopher meets people whom he has never before encountered, even though they live on the same street, including the elderly Mrs Alexander, who informs Christopher that his mother had an affair with Mr Shears and had been with <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

[...] The renovation effort is spearheaded by Los Angeles-area general contractor James Cowan and foreman Christopher Chico instead of the regular crew (who {{were in the process}} of filming the remaining episodes of the season), and only Holmes and senior contractor Damon Bennett (both of whom had to fly regularly between Toronto and Los Angeles) from the regular crew appear in this episode. Even though only Mike Holmes and Damon Bennett were the only regular crew members to appear in this episode.

2500|$|Elvis and Priscilla Ann Beaulieu {{first met}} in 1959 while Elvis was {{stationed}} in Germany with the U.S. Army. Priscilla was 14 years old when Elvis met her. Elvis' relationships with young women were pointed in [...] "In his love life," [...] by Reuben Fine, who observed that Elvis [...] "quickly became attached to teenage girls, and he loved to have them wearing white panties in bed with <b>him.</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> {{he would not have}} sex with them, whom he described as 'jail bait.' [...] " [...] In similar terms, Brent D. Taylor has stated that [...] "Elvis's closest female relationships were usually with young girls of around 13 or 14, ending as they reached late teens. He didn't have sex with these young girls, but had pajama parties, pillow fights and indulged in 'girl talk', just as he did with Gladys." [...] "As a perpetual youth", Elvis was [...] "attracted to young women", and [...] "Elvis felt comfortable with these adolescent girls" [...] because he [...] "was so insecure ... That’s why he needed younger girls." [...] Elvis biographer Alanna Nash also confirms that the singer had a predilection for young adolescent girls. The author says that Presley was overly attached to his mother and could not relate normally to mature women; presumably, Presley sought out very young girls because he felt threatened by women who were older.|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} on 15 November 2010. In addition, Egan fully expressed what he felt on during recording Gravity: [...] "It’s hard to believe this is our 11th album but performing is our passion and it would seem like throwing it all away if we stopped."“Both us and Take That go for epic pop songs but them taking Robbie back hasn’t made us think about Brian McFadden returning. It would feel odd to have a fifth person back on stage with us". In addition Westlife told Digital Spy: [...] "We'd {{wanted to work with}} <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> but all his loyalty was to Take That and he didn't want to work with another boyband," [...] "We'd been asking him and asking, but literally within moments of Take That deciding to go and work with Stuart Price, he said yes to us straight away. Afterwards he said he'd wanted to work with us for a long time, but he just couldn't do the Take That thing and the Westlife thing because they were too close." [...] "John created a sound for us in the same way he created a sound for Take That, a sound for Bon Jovi and a sound for all the other incredible artists he's worked with," [...] "He created a sound for Westlife that we haven't had before - it's not a massive departure, but it's definitely a step up in terms of production." [...] Filan also revealed that the group is currently in the process of selecting 12 or 13 songs for the album's final track listing from a pool of 16, with all but [...] "one or two" [...] likely to be originals. On 22 October 2010, Shanks stated that they have finished the Westlife record, all approved by Cowell. Shanks stated that the album ended up with two covers in it. On 27 October 2010, the album main release date was changed to 22 November 2010. On 25 October 2010, Feehily unveiled the final track listing on his official Twitter page as follows: On 1 November 2010, Mark confirmed the two cover songs on the album are, [...] "Chances" [...] by Athlete and [...] "The Reason" [...] by Hoobastank. In the November 2010 issue of Hello Magazine they told them about their competition with Take That and Walsh and Cowell's involvement in the album, [...] "You need competition to keep you on your toes".|$|E
