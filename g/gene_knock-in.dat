5000|$|In {{molecular}} cloning and biology, a knock-in (or <b>gene</b> <b>knock-in)</b> {{refers to a}} genetic engineering method that involves the one-for-one substitution of DNA sequence information in a genetic locus or the insertion of sequence information not found within the locus. Typically, this is done in mice since the technology for this process is more refined {{and there is a}} high degree of shared sequence complexity between mice and humans. The difference between knock-in technology and traditional transgenic techniques is that a knock-in involves a gene inserted into a specific locus, and is thus a [...] "targeted" [...] insertion.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively, the {{technique}} {{can be used}} to create null alleles so that the gene is not functional. For example, deletion of a gene by gene targeting (gene knockout) can be done in some organisms, such as yeast, mice and moss. Unique among plants, in Physcomitrella patens, gene knockout via homologous recombination to create knockout moss (see figure) is nearly as efficient as in yeast. In the case of the yeast model system directed deletions have been created in every non-essential gene in the yeast genome. In the case of the plant model system huge mutant libraries have been created based on gene disruption constructs.

40|$|Genome editing (GE) {{entails the}} {{modification}} of specific genomic sequences in living cells {{for the purpose}} of determining, changing, or expanding their function(s). Typically, GE occurs after delivering sequence-specific designer nucleases (e. g., ZFNs, TALENs, and CRISPR/Cas 9) and donor DNA constructs into target cells. These designer nucleases can generate gene knockouts or <b>gene</b> <b>knock-ins</b> when applied alone or in combination with donor DNA templates, respectively. We review progress in this field, with an emphasis on designer nuclease and donor template delivery into mammalian target cell populations. We also discuss the impact that incremental improvements to these tools are having on the specificity and fidelity attainable with state-of-the-art DNA-editing procedures.

40|$|Gene-editing {{tools are}} {{essential}} for uncovering how genes mediate normal brain-behaviour relationships and contribute to neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Recent progress in gene-editing technology is now allowing neuroscientists unprecedented access to edit the genome efficiently. Although many important tools have been developed, here we focus on approaches that allow for rapid gene-editing in the mature nervous system, particularly CRISPR/Cas 9 and anti-sense nucleotide-based techniques. CRISPR/Cas 9 is a flexible gene-editing tool, allowing the genome to be manipulated in diverse ways. For instance, CRISPR/Cas 9 has been successfully used to knock-out <b>genes,</b> <b>knock-in</b> mutations, overexpress or inhibit gene activity, and provide scaffolding for recruiting specific epigenetic regulators to individual genes and gene regions. Moreover, the CRISPR/Cas 9 system may be modified to target multiple genes at one time, affording simultaneous inhibition and overexpression of distinct genetic targets. Although {{many of the more}} advanced applications of CRISPR/Cas 9 have not been applied to the nervous system, the tool-box is widely-accessible, such that it is poised to help advance neuroscience. Anti-sense nucleotide-based technologies can be used to rapidly knock down genes in the brain and are simple to use. A main advantage of anti-sense based tools is their independence of viral packaging, allowing for rapid gene delivery with minimal technical expertise. Here, we describe the main applications and functions of each of these systems with an emphasis on their many potential applications in neuroscience laboratories...|$|R
30|$|As an integration-free gene {{insertion}} method, CRISPR/Cas 9 holds great promise as an efficient <b>gene</b> <b>knock-in</b> platform. Conventional CAR expression in T cells requires randomly integrating viral delivery vectors, including lentivirus and retrovirus. However, uncontrolled virus integration in host cell genomes {{has the potential}} risk of causing insertional mutagenesis. CRISPR/Cas 9 mediates efficient <b>gene</b> <b>knock-in</b> in human cells, embryos, and plants. Schumann et al. reported successful introduction of exogenous DNA into T cells genome at the Cas 9 cleavage site. Although the knock-in of large fragments, such as a CAR in T cells, remains challenging, doing so is desirable for therapeutic application and needs further exploration. Sather et al. reported the feasibility of knock-in of a CAR transgene in T cells with MegaTal and an AAV HDR template (Sather et al., 2015). A more recent study showed that targeting a CAR to the TRAC locus greatly enhanced the antitumor activity by reducing tonic activation (Eyquem et al., 2017). Microhomology Mediated End Joining (MMEJ) {{has been used for}} <b>gene</b> <b>knock-in</b> in human cells and animals wherein large homology arm is not required, thus facilitating gene delivery with small inserts (Nakade et al., 2014; Sakuma et al., 2015). Previously, some studies have highlighted the possibility of knock-in of large gene cassettes using homology-independent targeted integration strategy, which enables robust DNA knock-in in both dividing and non-dividing cells in vitro and, more importantly, in vivo (Auer et al., 2014; He et al., 2016; Suzuki et al., 2016).|$|E

TALEN-mediated PITCh, termed TAL-PITCh, enables efficient integration of exogenous donor DNA in human cells and animals, including silkworms and frogs. We further demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas 9 -mediated PITCh, termed CRIS-PITCh, can be applied in human cells without carrying the plasmid backbone sequence.

Here we describe TALEN and PITCh vector-mediated integration of long gene cassettes, including a single-chain Fv-Fc (scFv-Fc) gene, in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, with comparison of targeting and cloning efficiency among several donor design and culture conditions. We achieved 9. 6 -kb whole plasmid integration and 7. 6 -kb backbone-free integration into a defined genomic locus in CHO cells. Furthermore, we confirmed the reasonable productivity of recombinant scFv-Fc protein of the knock-in cells. Using our protocol, the knock-in cell clones could be obtained by a single transfection and a single limiting dilution using a 96 -well plate, without constructing targeting vectors containing long homology arms.

40|$|International audienceThe CD 28 costimulatory {{receptor}} has {{a pivotal}} role in T cell biology as this molecule amplifies T cell receptor (TCR) signals to provide an efficient immune T cell response.

The insertion of exogenous DNA sequences using HDR templates demonstrated by Schumann et al. further opens the possibility of precisely integrating transgenic elements, thereby reducing the risk of gene integration in oncogenic sites caused by viruses. However, the current efficiency of site-specific <b>gene</b> <b>knock-in</b> by nuclease-mediated homologous recombination is not comparable to that of standard viral transduction.

40|$|CXCR 4 regulates cell proliferation, enhances cell {{survival}} and induces chemotaxis, yet molecular mechanisms underlying its signaling remain elusive. Like all other G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), CXCR 4 delivers signals through G-protein-dependent and -independent pathways, the latter involving its serine-rich cytoplasmic tail. To evaluate the signaling and biological contribution of this G-protein-independent pathway, we generated mutant mice that express cytoplasmic tail-truncated CXCR 4 (ΔT) by a <b>gene</b> <b>knock-in</b> approach. We found that ΔT mice exhibited multiple developmental defects, {{with not only}} G-protein-independent but also G-protein-dependent signaling events completely abolished, despite ΔT's ability to still associate with G-proteins.

40|$|With the {{development}} of several new technologies using synthetic biology, {{it is possible to}} engineer genetically intractable organisms including Mycoplasma mycoides subspecies capri (Mmc), by cloning the intact bacterial genome in yeast, using the host yeast’s genetic tools to modify the cloned genome, and subsequently transplanting the modified genome into a recipient cell to obtain mutant cells encoded by the modified genome. The recently described tandem repeat coupled with endonuclease cleavage (TREC) method has been successfully used to generate seamless deletions and point mutations in the mycoplasma genome using the yeast DNA repair machinery. But, attempts to knock-in genes in some cases have encountered a high background of transformation due to maintenance of unwanted circularization of the transforming DNA, which contains possible autonomously replicating sequence (ARS) activity. To overcome this issue, we incorporated a split marker system into the TREC method, enabling seamless <b>gene</b> <b>knock-in</b> with high efficiency. The modified method is called TREC-assisted <b>gene</b> <b>knock-in</b> (TREC-IN). Since a gene to be knocked-in is delivered by a truncated non-functional marker, the background caused by an incomplete integration is essentially eliminated. In this paper, we demonstrate applications of the TREC-IN method in gene complementation and genome minimization studies in Mmc. In the first example, the Mmc dnaA gene was seamlessly replaced by an orthologous gene, which shares a high degree of identity at the nucleotide level with the original Mmc gene, with high efficiency and low background. In the minimization example, we replaced an essential gene back into the genome that was present {{in the middle of a}} cluster of non-essential genes, while deleting the non-essential gene cluster, again with low backgrounds of transformation and high efficiency. Conclusion Although we have demonstrated the feasibility of TREC-IN in gene complementation and genome minimization studies in Mmc, the applicability of TREC-IN ranges widely. This method proves to be a valuable genetic tool that can be extended for genomic engineering in other genetically intractable organisms, where it may be implemented in elucidating specific metabolic pathways and in rationale vaccine design...|$|E

Unexpectedly, examination of mutant ES cell clones and mice revealed that site-specific homologous recombination was mimicked in three independently generated ES cell clones by bidirectional extension of the vector homology arms using the endogenous mParp- 1 -flanking sequences as templates. This was followed by adjacent integration of the targeting vector, thus leaving the endogenous mParp- 1 locus functional.

Traditionally this efficiency was considered dependent on provirus integration in the host cell genome; however, recent results have challenged this view.

These lentiviral episomes lack replication signals and are gradually lost by dilution in dividing cells, but are stable in quiescent cells. Compared to integrating lentivectors, IDLVs have a greatly reduced risk of causing insertional mutagenesis and a lower risk of generating replication-competent recombinants (RCRs). IDLVs can mediate transient gene expression in proliferating cells, stable expression in nondividing cells in vitro and in vivo, specific immune responses, RNA interference, homologous recombination (<b>gene</b> repair, <b>knock-in,</b> and knock-out), site-specific recombination, and transposition.

Whereas E-cad is associated with pluripotency, N-cadherin (N-cad) expression is correlated with differentiation into mesodermal and neuroectodermal lineages. We investigated whether E-cad harbors unique molecular features in establishing or maintaining pluripotency. By using a <b>gene</b> replacement <b>knock-in</b> (ki) approach to express N-cadherin (N-cad) or E-cad/N-cad chimeric cadherins {{under the control of}} the E-cad locus, we show that all E-cad-depleted ki/ki ES cells are maintained in an undifferentiated state. Surprisingly, these cells retained key features of pluripotency, such as Nanog expression and full differentiation capacity in vitro and in vivo, whereas E-cad knockout (ko) ES cells irreversibly lost most of these features. Moreover, our results indicate that E-cad mediated adhesion is essential for iPS cell generation, since E-cad depleted fibroblasts were not reprogrammed. In contrast, N-cad efficiently supports somatic reprogramming similar to E-cad, and permits initiation of the crucial initial step of mesenchymal–epithelial transition. Thus, we show that cell adhesion and a robust pluripotent phenotype are ultimately connected. Since N-cad properly compensates for loss of E-cad, no specific ‘cadherin code’ is required...|$|R

Gene editing has been successfully employed in different aspects of stem cell research such as <b>gene</b> correction, mutation <b>knock-in,</b> and establishment of reporter cell lines (Raya et al., 2009; Howden et al., 2011; Li et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2011 b; Papapetrou et al., 2011; Sebastiano et al., 2011; Soldner et al., 2011; Zou et al., 2011 a). These techniques combined with the utility of hPSCs will significantly influence the area of regenerative medicine.|$|R
40|$|We {{generated}} a versatile mouse line, L 7 -tTA knock-in mouse, in which tetracycline-responsive transcriptional activator (tTA) gene was introduced into exon 2 of L 7 locus. Since L 7 is specifically expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells, we expected Purkinje cell-restricted expression of tTA <b>gene</b> in the <b>knock-in</b> mice. In situ hybridization analysis exhibited that tTA mRNAs in those mice were expressed only in Purkinje cells. Introduction of transgene consisting of tetracycline-responsive element {{that is a}} binding site for tTA and ideal cDNAs into L 7 -tTA knock-in mouse would result in specific expression of cDNA encoding proteins in Purkinje cells and its expression could be controlled by doxycycline administration. L 7 -tTA knock-in mice would provide us with opportunity to elucidate the role o...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the function of genes expressed in specific region of the developing brain, including signaling molecules and axon guidance molecules, local gene transfer or knock- out is required. <b>Gene</b> targeting <b>knock-in</b> or knock-out into local regions is possible to perform with combination with a specific CRE line, which is laborious, costly, and time consuming. Therefore, a simple transfection method, an in utero electroporation technique, which can be performed with short time, will be handy to test the possible function of candidate genes prior to the generation of transgenic animals 1, 2. In addition to this, in utero electroporation targets areas of the brain where no specific CRE line exists, and will limit embryonic lethality 3, 4. Here, we present a method of in utero electroporation combining two different types of electrodes for simple and convenient gene transfer into target areas of the developing brain. First, a unique holding method of embryos using an optic fiber optic light cable will make small embryos (from E 9. 5) visible for targeted DNA solution injection into ventricles and needle type electrodes insertion to the targeted brain area 5, 6. The patterning of the brain such as cortical area occur at early embryonic stage, therefore, these early electroporation from E 9. 5 make a big contribution to understand entire area patterning event. Second, the precise shape of a capillary prevents uterine damage by makin...|$|R
