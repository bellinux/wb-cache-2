Behind him plans are drawn on {{a large piece of}} paper, and hung on the wall.; Photoprint reads: "Machinists in the gear section and jig-bore unit of Autonetics, a division of North American Incorporated, operate this important, high-precision Swiss made <b>jig</b> <b>bores.</b> The magnifying glass is used to observe if the cut is clean and true. With this precision equipment, tolerance can be held to two ten-thousandths of an inch"...|$|R
50|$|The {{boring process}} can be {{executed}} on various machine tools, including (1) general-purpose or universal machines, such as lathes (/turning centers) or milling machines (/machining centers), and (2) machines designed to specialize in boring as a primary function, such as <b>jig</b> borers and <b>boring</b> machines or boring mills, which include vertical boring mills (workpiece rotates around a vertical axis while boring bar/head moves linearly; essentially a vertical lathe) and horizontal boring mills (workpiece sits on a table while the boring bar rotates around a horizontal axis; essentially a specialized horizontal milling machine).|$|R
50|$|NEL {{operated}} an indentured {{apprentice training}} scheme {{and offered a}} wide range of skills for young engineers before being privatised ranging between light machining, heavy machining, fitting, electro-discharge-machining, <b>jig</b> and horizontal <b>boring</b> and in later years CNC machining, programming and introductions to FMS (flexible manufacturing system) and CAD/CAM facilities running KCurve on DEC/VAX mini computers. This work commenced around 1982-6 using raster scan, (green) monitors to visualise the programming, each known as workstations, (since the 'intelligence' was built into the desk, not the monitor) and the CAD CAM programs were still printed out on punched paper to be transferred in some cases into onboard RAM and in others read and implemented sequentially. Machines in use in the CAD / CAM department were Matchmaker 7000M vertical mill, Norton Variant with Fanuc control, Cincinnati horizontal mill that had (then) been recently retrofitted with Gould drives.|$|R
