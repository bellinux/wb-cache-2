5|$|Guidelines {{for the use}} {{of drugs}} in the {{management}} of cancer pain have been published by the World Health Organization (WHO) and others. Healthcare professionals have an <b>ethical</b> <b>obligation</b> to ensure that, whenever possible, the patient or patient's guardian is well-informed about the risks and benefits associated with their pain management options. Adequate pain management may sometimes slightly shorten a dying person's life.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{challenges}} surrounding human remains accessioned by museums, including legal complications involved {{in dealing with}} human remains, involvement of living relatives or tribes, and potential repatriation and issues such as NAGPRA. The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990 requires any federal or federally-funded institution, {{with the exception of}} the Smithsonian Institution, to submit full inventories of their Native American funerary and sacred objects and human remains and to repatriate these objects to their tribe of origin should a request be made to do so. Should a museum possess human remains which have a direct living relative or group (Native American or otherwise), it is their <b>ethical</b> <b>obligation</b> to involve these individuals in the care and treatment of the remains.|$|E
500|$|The {{widespread}} use of pesticides, their release into the environment, {{and the potential for}} adverse public health effects due to exposure may raise public concern. [...] Some feel that regulatory authorities have an <b>ethical</b> <b>obligation</b> to track the health effects of such chemicals. [...] In the Handbook of Pesticide Toxicology, Calvert et al. write [...] "ecause society allows pesticides to be disseminated into the environment, society also incurs the obligation to track the health effects of pesticides." [...] Jay Vroom, president of CropLife America, said in a press release that [...] "...our industry has a moral and ethical obligation...to know how these products impact humans." [...] Surveillance of pesticide-related injuries and illnesses is recommended by the American Medical Association, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE), the Pew Environmental Health Commission, [...] and the Government Accountability Office.|$|E

A New Zealand understanding of these standard international obligations is influenced by New Zealand’s ethical culture. New Zealand arbitrators practicing overseas must recognise how their culture affects their approach to <b>ethical</b> <b>obligations.</b> In particular, they must be aware that a New Zealand approach to impartiality and independence {{may be seen as}} relaxed by those outside New Zealand. A New Zealand approach to <b>ethical</b> <b>obligations</b> is also applied during the enforcement of arbitrators’ obligations where New Zealand is the seat of an international arbitration. Foreign parties are likely to be satisfied with the enforcement of <b>ethical</b> <b>obligations</b> in New Zealand. This is good news for those seeking to establish New Zealand as a regional hub of international arbitration...|$|R

500|$|CJ DeLuzio Chasin {{states in}} Reconsidering Asexuality and Its Radical Potential that {{academic}} research on asexuality [...] "has positioned asexuality {{in line with}} essentialist discourses of sexual orientation" [...] which is troublesome as it creates a binary between asexuals and persons who {{have been subjected to}} psychiatric intervention for disorders such as Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder. Chasin says that this binary implies that all asexuals experience a lifelong (hence, enduring) lack of sexual attraction, that all non-asexuals who experience a lack of sexual desire experience distress over it, and that it pathologizes asexuals who do experience such distress. As Chasin says such diagnoses as HSDD act to medicalize and govern women's sexuality, the article aims to [...] "unpack" [...] problematic definitions of asexuality that are harmful to both asexuals and women alike. Chasin states that asexuality has the power to challenge commonplace discourse of the naturalness of sexuality, but that the unquestioned acceptance of its current definition does not allow for this. Chasin also argues there and elsewhere in Making Sense in and of the Asexual Community: Navigating Relationships and Identities in a Context of Resistance that is important to interrogate why someone might be distressed about low sexual desire. Chasin further argues that clinicians have an <b>ethical</b> <b>obligation</b> to avoid treating low sexual desire per se as pathological, and to discuss asexuality as a viable possibility (where relevant) with clients presenting clinically with low sexual desire.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to Yarhouse's paper, Jack Drescher argued that [...] "any putative <b>ethical</b> <b>obligation</b> to refer a patient for reparative therapy is outweighed by a stronger <b>ethical</b> <b>obligation</b> to keep patients away from mental health practitioners {{who engage in}} questionable clinical practices". Chuck Bright wrote that refusing to endorse a procedure that [...] "has been deemed unethical and potentially harmful by most medical and nearly every professional psychotherapy regulating body cannot be justifiably identified as prohibiting client self-determination". Some commentators, recommending a hard stand against the practice, have found therapy inconsistent with a psychologist's ethical duties because [...] "it is more ethical to let a client continue to struggle honestly with her or his identity than to collude, even peripherally, with a practice that is discriminatory, oppressive, and ultimately ineffective in its own stated ends". They argue that clients who request it do so out of social pressure and internalized homophobia, pointing to evidence that rates of depression, anxiety, {{alcohol and drug abuse}} and suicidal feelings are roughly doubled in those who undergo therapy.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{academic}} journals have {{codes of}} ethics that specifically refer to self-plagiarism. For example, the Journal of International Business Studies. Some professional organizations like the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) have created policies that deal specifically with self-plagiarism. Other organizations do not make specific reference to self-plagiarism such as the American Political Science Association (APSA). The organization published {{a code of ethics}} that describes plagiarism as [...] "...deliberate appropriation of the works of others represented as one's own." [...] It does not make any reference to self-plagiarism. It does say that when a thesis or dissertation is published [...] "in whole or in part", the author is [...] "not ordinarily under an <b>ethical</b> <b>obligation</b> to acknowledge its origins." [...] The American Society for Public Administration (ASPA) also published a code of ethics that says its members are committed to: [...] "Ensure that others receive credit for their work and contributions," [...] but it makes no reference to self-plagiarism.|$|E

60|$|In {{order that}} the same rules of {{interpretation}} should be considered applicable to the Constitution of the Society and {{to that of the}} United States, we must attribute to the former a solemnity and importance which involve a palpable absurdity. To claim for it the verbal accuracy and the legal wariness of a mere contract is equally at war with common sense and the facts of the case; and even were it not so, the party to a bond who should attempt to escape its <b>ethical</b> <b>obligation</b> by a legal quibble of construction would be put in coventry by all honest men. In point of fact, the Constitution was simply the minutes of an agreement among certain gentlemen, to define the limits within which they would accept trust funds, and the objects for which they should expend them.|$|E
