5|$|The Portuguese {{conquest of}} the Jaffna kingdom {{occurred}} after Portuguese traders arrived at the rival Kotte Kingdom in the southwest of modern Sri Lanka in 1505. Many kings of Jaffna, such as Cankili I, initially confronted the Portuguese <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> at converting the locals to Roman Catholicism, but eventually made peace with them.|$|E
5|$|During the 2008–09 Superliga Femenina season Domínguez {{was still}} enjoying playing for L'Estartit. She {{revealed}} {{it was her}} ultimate dream to coach the Mexico women's national team. She had started coaching L'Estartit's youth teams the previous season. Difficulties with her visa and commitments with the Mexico national team eventually reduced Domínguez's playing time with UE L'Estartit. In {{the first half of}} the 2011–12 Superliga Femenina season she appeared four times. In April 2012 UE L'Estartit admitted defeat <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> to bring her back to Spain.|$|E
5|$|Hodj 'n' Podj is a 1995 {{computer}} board game and minigame compilation developed by Boffo Games {{and published by}} Media Vision and Virgin Interactive. It was designed by Steve Meretzky, previously known for adventure games such as The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Hodj 'n' Podj features 19 minigames based on peg solitaire, Pac-Man, Battleship and other games. These may be played separately or within an overarching fairy tale story, which follows the suitors Hodj and Podj <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> to rescue two princesses.|$|E

5|$|On 20 December 1943, the under-strength Loyal Edmonton Regiment {{moved toward}} Ortona, with the Seaforth Highlanders {{covering}} their eastern flank. Throughout the day, they encountered {{heavy machine gun}} fire during their attempts to enter Ortona. By nightfall, both battalions held a toehold on {{the western edge of}} Ortona, yet had encountered heavy resistance <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> to secure it. The following day, D Company of the Loyal Edmonton Regiment launched attacks eastward towards the city centre, but accurate German sniper fire rapidly stalled the advance.|$|E
5|$|Reduced {{to a minor}} character, the new fictional Napoleon became not a world {{historical}} figure but {{an intimate}} one, fashioned by individuals' needs and consumed as popular entertainment. <b>In</b> <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> to represent the emperor as a figure of national unity, proponents and detractors of the Third Republic used the legend {{as a vehicle for}} exploring anxieties about gender and fears about the processes of democratization that accompanied this new era of mass politics and culture.|$|E
5|$|Durham's {{location}} in the north left it insecure, as Malcolm Canmore, King of Scots, raided and invaded the north of England {{on a number of}} occasions. Malcolm claimed Northumbria, in which Durham was located, as part of his kingdom. St-Calais managed to befriend Malcolm, and secured his support for the patron saint of Durham, Saint Cuthbert. Malcolm and his wife helped lay the foundation stone of the new cathedral dedicated to Cuthbert. Respect for the saint did not mean that Malcolm refrained entirely from raiding the north; he was killed in 1093 while once more raiding Northumbria. Both the English king and St-Calais did all in their power to support Malcolm's sons, who had been educated in England, <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> to secure the Scottish throne.|$|E

5|$|Gregory House, M.D., often {{construed}} as a misanthropic medical genius, heads a team of diagnosticians at the Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in New Jersey. Most episodes revolve around the diagnosis of a primary patient and start with a cold open set outside the hospital, showing events ending {{with the onset of}} the patient's symptoms. The typical episode follows the team <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> to diagnose and treat the patient's illness, which often fail until the patient's condition is critical. They usually treat only patients whom other doctors have not accurately diagnosed, and House routinely rejects cases that he does not find interesting. The story lines tend to focus on his unconventional medical theories and practices, and on the other characters' reactions to them, rather than on the details of the treatments.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the entire}} party, none were skilled skiers and only Bernacchi and Armitage had any {{experience}} with dog-sledges. The {{results of the}} men's early efforts to master these techniques were not encouraging, and tended to reinforce Scott's preference for man-hauling. The dangers of the unfamiliar conditions were confirmed when, on 11 March, a party returning from an attempted journey to Cape Crozier became stranded on an icy slope during a blizzard. <b>In</b> <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> to find safer ground, one of the group, Able Seaman George Vince, slid {{over the edge of}} a cliff and was killed. His body was never recovered; a cross with a simple inscription, erected in his memory, still stands at the summit of the Hut Point promontory.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} action began, Persano {{decided to leave}} Re d'Italia and {{transfer}} to Affondatore, though none of his subordinates on the other ships {{were aware of the}} change. They were thus left to fight as individuals without direction. More dangerously, by stopping Re d'Italia, he allowed a significant gap to open up between Vacca's three ships {{and the rest of the}} fleet. Tegetthoff took his fleet through the gap between Vacca's and Persano's ships, though he failed to ram any Italian vessels on the first pass. The Austrians then turned back toward Persano's ships, and took Re d'Italia, San Martino, and Palestro under heavy fire. The Austrian ships concentrated their fire on Re d'Italia, paying particular attention to her stern. <b>In</b> <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> to ram her, one of the Austrian ships destroyed Re d'Italias rudder, leaving her unmaneuverable.|$|E

5|$|The Bulgarian forces {{commanded}} by Ivan the Russian managed {{to withstand the}} four-month siege of Plovdiv undertaken by Andronikos III Palaiologos, claimant to the Byzantine throne, and his Bulgarian ally Voysil, despot of Kopsis. <b>In</b> <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> to capture the city, the Byzantines employed German specialists to construct a siege machine, from which they fired with crossbows at the Bulgarian defenders. Despite the elaborate siege tactics, {{by the summer of}} 1323 the Bulgarians had not only retained the city, but also launched raids on nearby Byzantine-held fortresses in the Rhodope Mountains, such as Stenimachos (modern Asenovgrad) and Tsepina. Plovdiv was lost, however, to the Byzantines soon thereafter. As Ivan's forces were leaving the city to meet the Bulgarian garrison that was to replace them, the pro-Byzantine inhabitants of Plovdiv opened the city gates and let a covert Byzantine detachment in.|$|E
5|$|The FEPP {{conducted}} a survey in 2001 which revealed that online monitoring software, including Net Nanny, SurfWatch, and Cybersitter, cast too broad a net and often blocked legitimate educational websites <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> to censor material from youths. In 2003, the organization assisted 33 academics in filing a friend-of-the-court brief challenging a law which restricted the sale of violent video games to minors. In coordination with the Brennan Center for Justice, the FEPP released a public policy report in 2006 on the inefficiency of Internet filtering; the report concluded that freedom of expression was harmed by such online censorship activity. In 2007, the FEPP became an independent organization.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{crashed into}} a remote area of marshland on Jamaica Bay used as a wildlife sanctuary. Upwards of 300 policemen and fire fighters, including 125 detectives attending a narcotics seminar at the Police Academy, as well as Coast Guard helicopters were mobilized to the crash site within {{half an hour of}} the crash for rescue operations, only to find there were no survivors. The three-alarm fire was under control by 10:50 AM EST, by which point only wreckage remained. Low tides aided search personnel <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> to recover bodies from the downed aircraft. Only a few bodies remained intact.|$|E

5|$|The coaches both chose strong squads <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> {{to win the}} trophy, though Sounders forward Kenny Cooper, later {{selected}} as Player of the Tournament, did {{not appear in the}} final. The Union's Maurice Edu gave his team the lead with a goal in the first half, but the Sounders equalized with a second half strike by Chad Barrett, and the match went into extra time. Although Philadelphia controlled periods of the match with chances throughout, Clint Dempsey took the lead for Seattle in the first extra time period, and Obafemi Martins sealed a Seattle victory with a late goal. Seattle earned a $250,000 cash prize, as well as a berth into the 2015–16 CONCACAF Champions League. Philadelphia received a $60,000 cash prize as the competition's runner-up.|$|E
5|$|The ridge {{fell under}} German control in October 1914, during the Race to the Sea, as the Franco-British and German forces {{continually}} attempted to outflank {{each other through}} northeastern France. The French Tenth Army attempted to dislodge the Germans from the region during the Second Battle of Artois in May 1915 by attacking their positions at Vimy Ridge and Notre Dame de Lorette. During the attack, the French 1st Moroccan Division briefly captured {{the height of the}} ridge, where the Vimy memorial is currently located, but was unable to hold it owing to a lack of reinforcements. The French made another attempt during the Third Battle of Artois in September 1915, but were once again unsuccessful in capturing the top of the ridge. The French suffered approximately 150,000 casualties <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> to gain control of Vimy Ridge and surrounding territory.|$|E
5|$|Unlike their adversaries, the South Vietnamese {{military}} suffered heavily <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> {{to recapture}} the village of Bình Giã and secure the surrounding areas. The South Vietnamese and their American allies lost the total of about 201 personnel killed in action, 192 wounded and 68 missing. In just four days of fighting, two of South Vietnam's elite Ranger companies were destroyed and several others suffered heavy losses, while the 4th Marine Battalion was rendered ineffective as a fighting force. At that stage of the war, Bình Giã was the worst defeat experienced by the South Vietnamese. Despite their losses, the South Vietnamese army considered the battle as their victory and erected a monument {{at the site of}} the battle to acknowledge the sacrifices of the soldiers who had fallen to retake Bình Giã.|$|E

5|$|By March 10, several South Vietnamese {{units were}} {{defeated}} <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> {{to hold off}} the North Vietnamese; the 1st battalion of 54th Infantry Regiments of ARVN 1st Division (South Vietnam) was destroyed on Hill 224 and 273; the ARVN 47th Armoured Squadron was overrun by the VPA 1st Regiment, 324th Division, on Mount Nghe; and the ARVN 113th Regional Force Battalion conceded Pho Lai to the VPA 4th Regiment, which {{was supported by the}} 223rd Artillery Regiment. General Thi then ordered the 15th Ranger Group and the 2nd Battalion of the 54th Infantry Regiment, with support from the 27th and 37th Tank Squadrons, to mount a counter-attack on Hill 224. Over the period of one week, both sides fired over 8,000 rounds of artillery shells on Hill 224, and the Republic of Vietnam Air Force conducted over 60 bombing sorties in an attempt to halt the advances of the North Vietnamese 2nd Army Corps.|$|E
5|$|During {{his absence}} from the Test team, the Australian {{selectors}} had been unsuccessful <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> to find a reliable partner for Arthur Morris to open the batting. Barnes started the season solidly and, in the last match before the team for the third Test against the West Indies was chosen, he hit 107 against Victoria. The selectors duly picked him for the match, then passed the team list to the Board of Control for ratification. The Board vetoed the inclusion of Barnes and requested the nomination of a replacement player. Unwilling to accept the blame for Barnes's omission, the selectors deliberately deferred their decision on the replacement. When the team was not announced at the scheduled time, journalists uncovered the story and Barnes became a cause célèbre for many weeks, missing all of the remaining Tests. Speculation abounded as {{to the nature of}} his supposed misdeeds. These included jumping the turnstile at a ground when he forgot his player's pass; insulting the Royal Family; theft from team-mates; drunkenness; and stealing a car.|$|E
5|$|Henry of Huntingdon {{records that}} noblemen sent their {{children}} to be educated at Bloet's household, {{whether or not they}} were destined for a career in the church. King Henry's illegitimate son Robert of Gloucester was educated in Bloet's care. Another illegitimate son of Henry's, Richard of Lincoln, was also in Bloet's household for an education. Gilbert of Sempringham, who founded the Gilbertine Order, was also educated in Bloet's household, entering it before Bloet's death and continuing there under Bloet's successor Alexander of Lincoln. Besides educating laymen, Bloet educated his own household clergy, including sending some of them to study under Ivo, Bishop of Chartres. He was known for his ostentatious manner of living, and served personally in war when needed. The medieval chronicler William of Malmesbury claimed that he hated monks. Henry of Huntingdon, however, remembered him as handsome, cheerful and affable. Earlier in his episcopate, Bloet had aided Christina of Markyate's family <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> to get the religious hermit to marry, at one point giving a judicial judgement that she must marry, which she refused to do. It was only after Bloet's death that Christina was able to be consecrated as a recluse at St Albans Abbey.|$|E
