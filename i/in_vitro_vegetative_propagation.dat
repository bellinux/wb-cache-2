This paper aimed to evaluate <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>vegetative</b> <b>propagation</b> of sacaca, including the establishment of propagules from the field, decontamination protocols, and determination of multiplication rates, besides describing limiting aspects for the culture during in vitro experiments. We used 1. 0 cm microcuttings with an axillary bud, collected from adult plants in the field. Disinfestation treatments were tested in the establishment, and there is an evaluation of the collecting month influence on the contamination rates. After disinfestation, microcuttings were placed in test tubes containing MS medium, added with BAP (0, 1, 2 and 3 mg L- 1) and GA 3 (0 and 0. 5 mg L- 1). In vitro establishment of sacaca with 41. 9 % of sprouted microcuttings was obtained. The contamination rate reached 58. 1 % (65. 4 % caused by fungi and 34. 6 % by bacteria), with greater occurrence when propagules were collected between October and January, the rainiest months in the Amazon region. The increased BAP and GA 3 concentrations in the culture medium provided significant improvements in the material multiplication rates. In spite of the results obtained, the species shows peculiarities and limitations to in vitro cultivation that were identified and described in this paper...|$|E

The lack of an effective clonal propagation method not only hampers the collection of superior germplasm but also makes {{it almost impossible to}} conduct feasibility trials of this crop.

The National Clonal Germplasm Repository at Hilo, USDA-ARS, has initiated studies of <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> and <b>vegetative</b> <b>propagation</b> for the multiplication and long-term preservation of pili.

40|$|In plants, {{undifferentiated}} or totally differentiated {{cells can}} be easily <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> cultured to generate undifferentiated embryogenic cells that can regenerate complete plants. This is the most spectacular expression of totipotency. Embryogenic cells represent a key material in plant biotechnologies as they are used in many processes aiming at asexual reproduction by somatic embryogenesis (SE), genetic transformation, protoplast regeneration and cryopreservation. Nevertheless, tissue culture systems that involve the acquisition of competence for totipotency and extensive cell division remain risky with respect to genome and epigenome instabilities. Particularly, the use of embryogenic cell suspensions has frequently been {{associated with an increased}} likelihood of genetic instability and somaclonal variation (SV) in the regenerated plants. SV is a major concern <b>in</b> all <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>vegetative</b> plant <b>propagation</b> systems because it leads to the loss of genetic fidelity. Since 20 years, embryogenic cell suspension based SE techniques have been applied to coffee for the large-scale dissemination of exceptional Arabica hybrids. Here, we present our production and research experience showing that SE is efficient and reliable for true-to-type propagation. Over 99 % of coffee trees regenerated fully conform to the mother plant, both morphologically - they grow, flower and produce normally. Hence strong genetic and epigenetic changes in proliferating embryogenic cells are not a fatality. The results also demonstrated the importance of embryogenic culture age on SV and hence the non-random nature of this phenomenon. The genetic and epigenetic alterations are particularly limited during SE. The main change in most of phenotypic variants was aneuploidy showing that mitotic aberrations {{play a major role in}} SV in coffee. These results provide a proof of concept for the use of embryogenic cell suspensions with other plant species: a revolution in the world of plant micropropagation on an industrial scale.

A β-glucuronidase reporter gene under control of pCsVMV (pCsVMV-GUS) was introduced into the cassava landrace ‘Tokunbo’ via Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation. Transgenic tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum SR 1) with the same gene construct were also produced.

In transgenic cassava, the pCsVMV-GUS gene was highly expressed in all tissues and most cell types of <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> plants including leaf, stem, petiole, and fibrous roots. The pCsVMV-GUS gene was also highly expressed in these tissues as well as in tubers of greenhouse grown cassava.

Como explantes, foram utilizadas brotações axilares provenientes do estabelecimento e multiplicação <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> de ápices caulinares das {{cultivar}}es Caipira (AAA), Preciosa (AAAB) e Japira (AAAB). Para o enraizamento, empregou-se o meio MS reduzido a 50 % da concentração de sais, adicionado de 30 g. L- 1 de sacarose, 1 mg. L- 1 de AIB e 6 g. L- 1 de ágar. Os tratamentos foram dispostos em esquema fatorial 3 x 4, com três cultivares (Caipira, Preciosa e Japira) e quatro períodos de enraizamento <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> (7; 14; 21 e 28 dias), num total de 12 tratamentos. Ao final de cada período, a altura da parte aérea, o número e o comprimento de raízes foram avaliados, e as plantas, submetidas ao processo de aclimatização por 90 dias. Após esse período, as plantas foram avaliadas quanto à sobrevivência, número e comprimento de raízes, diâmetro do pseudocaule e massa seca de raízes, parte aérea e total. De modo geral, observou-se que a fase de indução de raízes nas brotações de bananeira <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> ocorreu até os 14 dias de cultivo em meio de enraizamento, havendo apenas crescimento em tamanho das raízes após esse período. Entre as cultivares, verificou-se que, com exceção do diâmetro de pseudocaule, a cultivar Caipira apresentou crescimento vegetativo <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> e durante a aclimatização (altura de plantas, número e comprimento de raízes e massa seca da parte aérea, raízes e total) superior às cultivares Preciosa e Japira. Após 21 dias de permanência em meio de enraizamento, a taxa de sobrevivência das plantas, observada em casa de vegetação, alcançou 100 %, independentemente da cultivar testada. The {{objective of the}} present study was to assess the influence of the exposition time to rooting medium on the <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> and ex vitro growth of banana plants. As explants, new axillaries buds obtained from the <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> establishment and multiplication of stem apices of Caipira (AAA), Preciosa (AAAB) and Japira (AAAB) cultivars were used. The MS medium with reduction to 50 % of the salt concentration adding 30 g. L- 1 of sucrose, 1 mg. L- 1 of IBA, and 6 g. L- 1 of agar was used to induce rooting. The treatments were analyzed in a 3 x 4 factorial design, with three cultivars (Caipira, Preciosa and Japira) and four <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> rooting periods (7, 14, 21 and 28 days), given a total of 12 treatments. At the end of each period, the height of the aerial portion, and number and length of roots were assessed, and the plants were submitted to 90 days of acclimatization. After that, the survival, number and length of roots, pseudostem diameter, and dry weight of the roots, aerial and total portions of the plants were assessed. Generally, the root induction step <b>in</b> the <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> banana budding occurred up to 14 days of cultivation in rooting medium, and after that, the roots grew only in length. Among the cultivars, it was verified that, with the exception of the pseudostem diameter, the Caipira cultivar showed superior <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>vegetative</b> growth, and during the acclimatization, the height of the plant, number and length of the roots, and dry mass of the aerial, roots, and total parts, were also superior to the observed in Preciosa and Japira cultivars. After 21 days on rooting medium, the survival rate of the plants in greenhouse reach 100 %, in despite of the tested cultivar...|$|R
