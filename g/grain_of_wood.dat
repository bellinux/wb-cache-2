40|$|Previous {{articles}} {{have shown that}} modification of wood by citric acid (CA) improves dimensional stability and resistance of wood against fungi attack. However, chemical modification of wood also modifies its mechanical properties in some way. The compression strength of wood {{is one of its}} representative mechanical properties. Modified wood with lower values of compression strength has limited purpose. The intention of this work is to show the effect of wood modification by citric acid on the compression strength of wood. Fir wood (Abies alba Mill.) and beech wood (Fagus sylvatica L.) were impregnated by citric acid with sodium-dihydrogen-hypophosphite (NaH 2 PO 2) as a catalyst. Part of the impregnated samples together with control samples were cured at the temperature of 140 °C for 10 hours and the remaining samples were cured in microwaves for 35 minutes. The average compression strength parallel to the <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> modifi ed by CA, using different regimes of curing, was compared to the strength of unmodifi ed wood. The average compression strength parallel to the <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> was retained after modification. In the case of fir wood, the average compression strength was even improved after modification. The results indicate that wood modified by citric acid may be considered for the purposes where compression strength properties are equally important as improved durability and dimensional stability of wood...|$|E

40|$|Texture can be {{observed}} in many natural and synthetic images from multispectral satellite images to the microscopic images of cell or tissue samples. Texture is an innate property of virtually all surfaces, the <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood,</b> the weave of fabric, the pattern of crop in fields etc It contains important information about the structural arrangement of surfaces and their relationship to the surrounding environment. Since the textural properties of images appear to carry useful information, for discriminating purpose features have always been calculated for textures. The paper deals with the pattern classification using texture features. The features used in the project are standard deviation and entropy of all parts obtained after 3 rd level decomposition using DWT. A mean feature vector is calculated and is used for classification. For classification distance similarity is used. The different distances used are Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, Bray Curtis distance and Canberra distance. The efficiency of classification is calculated for each distance and is compared. The time required for each retrieval, in every distance method used, is also calculated...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of dynamic}} {{mechanical}} analysis was explored as a possible method of screening for wood quality in breeding programmes. Viscoelastic properties along the <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> from 18 -month-old Pinus radiata saplings were measured using a humidity-controlled dynamic mechanical analyser. Storage modulus and tanδ were determined independently for opposite wood (OW) and compression wood (CW) in 25 trees in the temperature range from 10 to 45 °C at 5 °C intervals at three frequencies (0. 1, 1 and 10 Hz) at constant moisture content of 9 %. Storage modulus and tanδ were frequency and temperature dependent. The two wood types {{did not differ significantly}} in their storage modulus. But OW exhibited significantly higher tanδ values than CW. The relationship of viscoelastic properties with physical (acoustic velocity, basic density and longitudinal shrinkage) and chemical wood properties was explored. There was a strong correlation (R = 0. 76) between storage modulus and dynamic MOE (measured by acoustics). In addition, tanδ was positively correlated with longitudinal shrinkage. Monosaccharide compositions of the cell wall polysaccharides and lignin contents were determined and showed significant differences in the relative proportion of major cell wall components in OW and CW. Correlations between tanδ and xylose, originating from heteroxylans, and lignin content were found for CW, suggesting that the damping behaviour of cell walls is controlled by the matrix between cellulose fibril aggregates...|$|E

The {{goal of this}} study was to analyse fiddleback figure and other log characteristics in sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) and their contribution to the price of the timber. We studied sycamore maple logs at the annual auction of the highest quality wood assortments in Slovenj Gradec, Slovenia. Measurements were performed on the logs and wavy grain was analysed in 2013. In addition, data were used on logs auctioned between 2007 and 2012. Using the data collected at the auction in 2013 and a binary logistic regression model, the original sample was expanded considerably. The percentage of fi ddleback maple was 7. 4 % at the auction in 2013. Larger volume of maple logs was on average linked to higher price; however, the presence of fiddleback figure in a log per se did not guarantee above average price. Prices of more than half of the fiddleback figured maple logs at the auction in 2013 were below average. On the other hand, large fiddleback logs achieved the highest prices. Trees with fiddleback figure proved to be evenly distributed throughout the entire population of sycamore maple in Slovenia. The geographic origin of sycamore maple did not influence the occurrence of fiddleback figure. The presented results appear to be representative of the occurrence of fiddleback figure in Acer pseudoplatanus throughout its entire distribution range...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the RC {{aircraft}} design was not to address a problem {{that has not been}} solved, but to redesign an aircraft with the intent to understand the practical applications of the building process. Our approach to completing this project involved two phases; the planning phase and the building phase. In the planning phase, we made selections for the airfoil, wing, fuselage, tail, elevators, and ailerons. These choices were made using aeronautical engineering concepts and theory. For the building phase, we focused on materials selection, fabrication, and testing. During our design process, a lot of time went to choosing the airfoil. While researching, we considered three governing factors: drag coefficient, lift coefficient, and manufacturability. Each airfoil offered a variation of these parameters. The Eppler 423 airfoil was picked for its low drag coefficient. There were issues during fabrication. These issues mainly stemmed from the lack of quality equipment. For example, initial attempts to cut the balsa wood into the airfoil profile caused wood splitting. This happened because the saw was too coarse for that <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood.</b> If this project were redone, we would utilize tools that are commonly used within the hobbyist community to optimize fabrication. Our project focused on the application of the engineering design process that we have become familiar with as undergraduate students. In terms of purpose, our project would identify most with the R/C aircraft hobbyist community and FSAE community that also engineer and build aircrafts for personal or competition uses. [URL]...|$|E

Introduction: The general order and sequence of arrangement of these subjects and the, exercises involved in each is of fundamental {{importance in the}} selection of manual training courses. It is the purpose of this treatise, to show the relation between these different lessons, together with reasons for the sequence of exercises outlined. Woodwork should naturally come first as it is simpler, involving the use of simpler tools and softer materials, and is thus a better subject in which to teach the mathematics of dimensions, and the interpretation of plans, than are the metals. The forge work may not be so difficult if the student first masters woodwork. Also the philosophy of the behavior of iron and steel and the working conditions to be fulfilled in iron work, would place forging after the joinery course. The joinery course should also precede the course in turning because (1) It is a good preliminary training in the interpretation of plans. (2) It forms a foundation for the turning course as the workman acquires the knowledge of the behavior of the <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> when muscular force is applied to it. (3) It teaches how to apply this force to the best advantage, and (4) The use of simple tools should be mastered before commencing the operating of machinery. In woodwork soft wood should be practiced on before hard wood and provision has been made for this in setting forth the following lists of exercises. After joinery, turning, and forging, should come the foundry practice. Foundry work requires much care and still more knowledge of the action and reaction of materials and adaptation of means to an end than blacksmithing...|$|E
