Oshii commented that his first thought to find {{an image of the}} future setting was an Asian city, but finding a {{suitable}} cityscape of the future would be impossible. Oshii chose to use the real streets of Hong Kong as his model. He also said that Hong Kong was the perfect subject and theme for the film with its countless signs and the cacophony of sounds. The film's mecha designer Takeuchi Atsushi noted that while the film does not have a chosen setting, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>obviously</b> based on Hong Kong because the city represented the theme of the film, {{the old and the new}} which exist in a strange relationship in an age of an information deluge. Before shooting the film, the artists drew sketches that emphasized Hong Kong's chaotic, confusing and overwhelming aspects.|$|E

25|$|Some in Modern Orthodox Judaism {{reject the}} above view as naive. Some Orthodox Jews accept the earlier rabbinic {{position}} that the Zohar was a work written in the Middle Medieval Period by Moses de Leon, but argue that since <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>obviously</b> based on earlier materials, it can still be held to be authentic, but not as authoritative or without error as others within Orthodoxy might hold.|$|E

25|$|Intuitively {{it seems}} {{unlikely}} {{that there could be a}} retraction of D n onto S n − 1, and in the case n = 1 <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>obviously</b> impossible because S 0 (i.e., the endpoints of the closed interval D 1) is not even connected. The case n = 2 is less obvious, but can be proven by using basic arguments involving the fundamental groups of the respective spaces: the retraction would induce an injective group homomorphism from the fundamental group of S 1 to that of D 2, but the first group is isomorphic to Z while the latter group is trivial, so this is impossible. The case n = 2 can also be proven by contradiction based on a theorem about non-vanishing vector fields.|$|E
25|$|Items {{such as the}} windscreen, wipers and {{exhaust systems}} are tested for {{condition}} and operation. Windscreen wipers will fail the test {{if they do not}} adequately clear the windscreen when used in conjunction with the washers. The exhaust system, in addition to checks on its condition and security, is tested to ascertain whether <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>obviously</b> louder than another vehicle of the same make and model with a standard exhaust system fitted. Dismantling of any part of the vehicle during the MOT test is strictly against test regulations, making the assessment of corrosion or worn components in certain areas on certain car models very difficult to determine accurately. As the MOT is only an inspection for road-worthiness at the time of test, the inspection of most accessories is not included. One exception is tow bars: their condition and their attachment to the vehicle is now included in the MOT.|$|E
25|$|However, {{considerations}} of how unified conscious representations are formed {{are not the}} full focus of multisensory Integration research. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>obviously</b> important for the senses to interact {{in order to maximize}} how efficiently people interact with the environment. For perceptual experience and behavior to benefit from the simultaneous stimulation of multiple sensory modalities, integration of the information from these modalities is necessary. Some of the mechanisms mediating this phenomenon and its subsequent effects on cognitive and behavioural processes will be examined hereafter. Perception is often defined as one's conscious experience, and thereby combines inputs from all relevant senses and prior knowledge. Perception is also defined and studied in terms of feature extraction, which is several hundred milliseconds away from conscious experience. Notwithstanding the existence of Gestalt psychology schools that advocate a holistic approach to the operation of the brain, the physiological processes underlying the formation of percepts and conscious experience have been vastly understudied. Nevertheless, burgeoning neuroscience research continues to enrich our understanding of the many details of the brain, including neural structures implicated in multisensory integration such as the superior colliculus (SC) and various cortical structures such as the superior temporal gyrus (GT) and visual and auditory association areas. Although the structure and function of the SC are well known, the cortex and the relationship between its constituent parts are presently the subject of much investigation. Concurrently, the recent impetus on integration has enabled investigation into perceptual phenomena such as the ventriloquism effect, rapid localization of stimuli and the McGurk effect; culminating in a more thorough understanding of the human brain and its functions.|$|E

After polls showed declining support for his candidacy, he dropped out of the race in December 1988 and endorsed Richard M. Daley, who won the nomination in the February 1989 Democratic primary.|$|E
500|$|The {{geophysical}} and archaeological {{study of}} {{the area around the}} stone feature as well as the soil sampling strategy and the close observation of the 1792-93 maps of the area suggest that the stone layout cannot be the garden of Delahaye. [...] This study also indicated that the location of the garden shown on the maps is in a dry and rocky environment which does not fit he description of the French ... The stone layout found in 2002 is probably an uncompleted structure associated with the late 19th and early 20th century development of the area.

500|$|An {{early and}} very {{influential}} modern historian, George Grote, {{set the tone}} by expressing incredulity at the numbers given by Herodotus: [...] "To admit this overwhelming total, or anything near to <b>it,</b> <b>is</b> <b>obviously</b> impossible." [...] Grote's main objection is the supply problem, though he does not analyse the problem in detail. He did not reject Herodotus's account altogether, citing the latter's reporting of the Persians' careful methods of accounting and their stockpiling of supply caches for three years, but {{drew attention to the}} contradictions in the ancient sources. A later influential historian, J. B. Bury, calls Herodotus's numbers [...] "wholly fabulous" [...] and judges that the Persian land forces may have been 180,000. [...] A major limiting factor for the size of the Persian army, first suggested by Sir Frederick Maurice (a British transport officer) is the supply of water. Maurice suggested in the region of 200,000 men and 70,000 animals could have been supported by the rivers in that region of Greece. He further suggested that Herodotus may have confused the Persian terms for chiliarchy (1,000) and myriarchy (10,000), leading to an exaggeration by a factor of ten. Other early modern scholars estimated that the land forces participating in the invasion at 100,000 soldiers or less, based on the logistical systems available to the Ancients.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} chapter 4 ("Why there almost {{certainly}} is no God"), Dawkins sums up his argument and states, [...] "The temptation [...] is a false one, because the designer hypothesis immediately raises the larger problem of who designed the designer. The whole problem we started out with was the problem of explaining statistical improbability. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>obviously</b> no solution to postulate something even more improbable". In addition, chapter 4 asserts that the alternative to the designer hypothesis is not chance, but natural selection.|$|E
2500|$|The {{description}} of a universe that expanded and contracted in a cyclic manner was first put forward in a poem published in 1791 by Erasmus Darwin. Edgar Allan Poe presented a similar cyclic system in his 1848 [...] essay titled <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>obviously</b> not a scientific work, but Poe, while starting from metaphysical principles, tried to explain the universe using contemporary physical and mental knowledge. Ignored by the scientific community and often misunderstood by literary critics, its scientific implications have been reevaluated in recent times.|$|E
2500|$|The {{model is}} seen smoking a pipe, as did Apollinaire, but Cubist portraits {{did not always}} {{accurately}} represent characteristics of the sitter. The pipe was a common theme in the poems of Stéphane Mallarmé and {{was used as a}} sexual device by several Cubists because of its phallic symbolism. [...] "The question of identity in Metzinger’s portraits is further obscured by their titles" [...] writes Joann Moser, for example, [...] "the study for the Portrait of Apollinaire {{would seem to be a}} study for the Portrait of an American Smoker… Although Apollinaire did smoke a pipe, the man portrayed in the drawing does not have the round cheeks and double chin characteristic of Apollinaire.

2500|$|Consivius sower, is an epithet that {{reflects}} the tutelary function of the god at the first instant of human life and of life in general, conception. This function is a particular case of his function of patron of beginnings. As far as man is concerned <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>obviously</b> of the greatest importance, even though both Augustine and some modern scholars see it as minor. Augustine shows astonishment {{at the fact that}} some of the dii selecti may be engaged in such tasks: [...] "In fact Janus himself first, when pregnancy is conceived,... opens the way to receiving the semen" [...] Varro on the other hand had clear the relevance of the function of starting a new life by opening the way to the semen and therefore started his enumeration of the gods with Janus, following the pattern of the Carmen Saliare. Macrobius gives the same interpretation of the epithet in his list: [...] "Consivius from sowing (conserendo), i. e. from the propagation of the human genre, that is disseminated by the working of Janus." [...] as the most ancient form. He though does not consider Conseuius to be an epithet of Janus but a theonym in its own right.|$|E
2500|$|The Canon, {{together}} {{with the rest of}} the Order of Mass, is now printed in the middle of the Missal, since 1970 between the Proper of the Seasons and the Proper of the Saints, in the immediately preceding centuries between the propers for Holy Saturday and Easter Day. Until about the ninth century, it stood towards the end of the sacramentary, among the [...] "Missae quotidianae" [...] and after the Proper Masses (so in the Gelasian book). Thence it moved to the very beginning. From the eleventh century it was constantly placed in the middle, where it is now, and since the use of complete Missals [...] "according to the use of the Roman Curia" [...] (from the thirteenth century) that has been its place invariably. It is the part of the book that is used far more than any other, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>obviously</b> convenient that it should occur where a book lies open best – in the middle. The same reason of practical use that gave it this place led to the common custom of printing the Canon on vellum, even when the rest of the Missal was on paper; vellum stands wear much better than paper.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{they can}} be written in a {{completely}} symbolic form, for example, within the propositional calculus, theorems are often expressed in a natural language such as English. The {{same is true of}} proofs, which are often expressed as logically organized and clearly worded informal arguments, intended to convince readers of the truth of the statement of the theorem beyond any doubt, and from which a formal symbolic proof can in principle be constructed. Such arguments are typically easier to check than purely symbolic ones—indeed, many mathematicians would express a preference for a proof that not only demonstrates the validity of a theorem, but also explains in some way why <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>obviously</b> true. In some cases, a picture alone may be sufficient to prove a theorem. Because theorems lie at the core of mathematics, they are also central to its aesthetics. Theorems are often described as being [...] "trivial", or [...] "difficult", or [...] "deep", or even [...] "beautiful". These subjective judgments vary not only from person to person, but also with time: for example, as a proof is simplified or better understood, a theorem that was once difficult may become trivial. On the other hand, a deep theorem may be stated simply, but its proof may involve surprising and subtle connections between disparate areas of mathematics. Fermat's Last Theorem is a particularly well-known example of such a theorem.|$|E

Also, Australia's ACT Chief Minister, Jon Stanhope confirmed that the Chinese embassy was closely involve to ensure that [...] "pro-China demonstrators vastly outnumbered Tibetan activists." [...] Australian freestyle swimmer and five-time Olympic gold medalist Ian Thorpe ended the Australian leg of the torch relay April 24, 2008, touching the flame to light a cauldron after a run that was only marginally marked by protests. People demonstrated both for China and for Tibet. At least five people were arrested during the torch relay. Police said [...] "the five were arrested for interfering with the event under special powers enacted in the wake of massive protests against Chinese policy toward Tibet." [...] At one point, groups of Chinese students surrounded and intimidated pro-Tibet protesters. One person had to be pulled aboard a police launch when a group of pro-Chinese students looked like they might force him into the lake.|$|E
