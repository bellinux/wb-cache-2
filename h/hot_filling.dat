The majority of this demand {{is due to}} the operation of electric heating elements inside appliances. This paper investigates the potential benefits that can be realised by adding a <b>hot</b> <b>fill</b> connection to washing appliances, with respect to carbon emissions, demand side management and renewable energy integration. Initial laboratory testing of new <b>hot</b> and cold <b>fill</b> appliances has resulted in modifications to optimise <b>hot</b> <b>fill</b> intake, and a novel numerical model presents a method of characterising appliance electricity use in different configurations. In order to validate model findings and test the use of new <b>hot</b> <b>fill</b> appliances in situ, a pilot study has recorded appliances’ resource consumption at one-minute resolution in fourteen households. The addition of <b>hot</b> <b>fill</b> reduced the total dishwasher and washing machine electricity consumption by 38 % and 67 % respectively.
