30|$|This {{study used}} a {{vibration}} test method {{to show that}} grain angles of <b>face</b> <b>veneer</b> have substantial effects on sound velocities and dynamic Young’s moduli of three types of wood-based composites. The sound velocity at 0 ° grain angle of <b>face</b> <b>veneer</b> was the highest, and it decreased with increasing grain angle {{in the range of}} 0 ° to 90 °. This tendency was similar to that for dynamic Young’s modulus. The relationship between the grain angle of <b>face</b> <b>veneer</b> and the sound velocity of three types of wood-based composites can be expressed in the form of Hankinson’s equation or a second-order parabolic equation. This study also showed that the application of orthotropic elasticity theory was valid for the three types of wood-based composites. The relationship between the grain angle of the <b>face</b> <b>veneer</b> and the Young’s modulus of three types of wood-based composites can be expressed {{in the form of the}} Jenkin equation, Hankinson’s equation, or a second-order parabolic equation.

30|$|The {{effects of}} grain angle of <b>face</b> <b>veneer</b> on surface wave {{velocity}} and dynamic shear modulus of {{three types of}} wood-based composites were examined using a surface wave propagation method. It was found that grain-angle dependence of surface wave velocity and dynamic shear modulus indeed exists for wood-based composites. Grain angles of <b>face</b> <b>veneer</b> {{were found to have}} substantial effects on the surface wave velocities and dynamic shear moduli of wood–plastic composite (WP), wood–fiberboard composite (WF), and wood–metal composite (WM). The orthotropic properties of the three composites were defined as the ratio of surface wave velocities at 0 ° and 90 ° grain angles (V 0 /V 90), which were 3.7, 2.2, and 2.0 for WP, WF, and WM, respectively. For WP, WF, and WM, the dynamic shear moduli in the 90 ° grain angle of <b>face</b> <b>veneer</b> were approximately 7 %, 19 %, and 25 % of that in the 0 ° grain angle, respectively. The relationships between grain angles of <b>face</b> <b>veneer</b> and the shear moduli of the three types of wood-based composites could be represented by Hankinson’s equation, and their optimal n values were 2.1, 1.2, and 1.3 for WP, WF, and WM, respectively.|$|E

25|$|A typical plywood {{panel has}} <b>face</b> <b>veneers</b> {{of a higher}} grade than the core veneers. The {{principal}} function of the core layers {{is to increase the}} separation between the outer layers where the bending stresses are highest, thus increasing the panel's resistance to bending. As a result, thicker panels can span greater distances under the same loads. In bending, the maximum stress occurs in the outermost layers, one in tension, the other in compression. Bending stress decreases from the maximum at the face layers to nearly zero at the central layer. Shear stress, by contrast, is higher {{in the center of the}} panel, and at the outer fibres.|$|R

40|$|The {{strength}} and stiffness properties of Pinus radiata D. Don plywood at angles to {{the grain of}} the <b>face</b> <b>veneer</b> have been modelled by theoretical equations and compared with test results. Stiffness properties were calculated assuming linear elastic behaviour of each wood veneer in the plywood, and strength properties were determined using a two-dimensional plane stress failure criterion and assumed values for shear {{strength and}} axial strength of wood. Experimental values were close to the theoretical relationships derived for in-plane bending strength and stiffness, tension strength, and compression strength, and for stiffness bending perpendicular to the plane of the plywood. The derived relationships were used to calculate strength ratios which may be used for the design of plywood gusset plates and other components where stress is applied at angles other than parallel or perpendicular to {{the grain of the}} <b>face</b> <b>veneer.</b> Experimental results verify that the current code basic working stresses parallel to the grain derived from out-of-plane bending tests can be used for in-plane bending...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine appropriate accelerated aging methods for exterior plywood made with Southeast Asian hardwood <b>face</b> <b>veneers.</b> A secondary {{objective of this}} study was to determine the durability of exterior plywood made with keruing (12 Dipterocarpus spp.). To reach these objectives I made plywood using three phenolic adhesives in a split-split plot design, varying assembly time (5, 20, 45 minutes) and species (16 Southeast Asian hardwoods) through four replications. Samples from these panels were subjected to vacuum/ pressure soak (PS 1 - 74); standard boil cycle (PS 1 - 74) for 2, 5, 10, and 25 cycles; automatic boil cycle (ASTM D 3434 - 75) for 20, 40, 100, and 200 cycles; weatherometer (ASTM G 23 - 69) for 2400 hours; and wet/dry cycling for 2400 hours. For these hardwoods, both the standard and automatic boil cycle aging methods were good discriminators of bond durability. The standard boil method required 10 or more cycles to assure that unsatisfactory bonds would be detected. The automatic boil method required 40 or more cycles. The vacuum/pressure, weatherometer and wet/dry cycle methods were poor discriminators of bond durability. All keruings examined formed uniformly excellent bonds with a low molecular weight resin (adhesive B); they formed bonds of variable quality with a moderately high molecular weight resin (adhesive A) ...|$|R

The face layer of external walls is carried out of high-quality brick, and sometimes from plastered mineral wool heater. Layered walls with face brick layer in CIS countries have received wide application since the middle of 90 th years of last century in connection with toughening of standard requirements for thermal resistance. Thus, without possessing corresponding standard base and the building experience, many decisions have been borrowed abroad, and first of all from the European countries where layered walls have started to take root widely for 20 - 30 years earlier. Operation of layered walls, especially in many-storeyed frame-monolithic housing construction, already in the first 3 - 5 years has revealed a number of serious lacks which in many cases led to an emergency condition of walling.

40|$|In Polynesia, {{the complex}} Society Islands chiefdoms {{constructed}} elaborate temples (marae), {{some of which}} reached monumental proportions and were associated with human sacrifice in the ‘Oro cult. We investigated the development of temples on Mo‘orea Island by 230 Th/U dating of corals used as architectural elements (<b>facing</b> <b>veneers,</b> cut-and-dressed blocks, and offerings). The three largest coastal marae (associated with the highest-ranked chiefly lineages) and 19 marae in the inland ‘Opunohu Valley containing coral architectural elements were dated. Fifteen corals from the coastal temples meet geochemical criteria for accurate 230 Th/U dating, yield reproducible ages for each marae, and have a mean uncertainty of 9 y (2 σ). Of 41 corals from wetter inland sites, 12 show some diagenesis and may yield unreliable ages; however, the majority (32) of inland dates are considered accurate. We also obtained six 14 C dates on charcoal from four marae. The dates indicate that temple architecture on Mo‘orea Island developed rapidly {{over a period of}} approximately 140 y (ca. AD 1620 – 1760), with the largest coastal temples constructed immediately before initial European contact (AD 1767). The result of a seriation of architectural features corresponds closely with this chronology. Acropora coral veneers were superceded by cut-and-dressed Porites coral blocks on altar platforms, followed by development of multitier stepped altar platforms and use of pecked basalt stones associated with the late ‘Oro cult.
