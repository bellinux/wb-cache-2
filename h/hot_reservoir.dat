Again there are four bodies: the working body, the <b>hot</b> <b>reservoir,</b> the cold reservoir, and the work reservoir. A single cycle starts with the working body colder than the cold reservoir, and then energy is taken in as heat by the working body from the cold reservoir. Then the work reservoir does work on the working body, adding more to its internal energy, making it hotter than the <b>hot</b> <b>reservoir.</b> The hot working body passes heat to the <b>hot</b> <b>reservoir,</b> but still remains hotter than the cold reservoir.

25|$|Carnot {{published}} his {{book in the}} heyday of steam engines. His theory explained why steam engines using superheated steam were better because of the higher temperature of the consequent <b>hot</b> <b>reservoir.</b> Carnot's theories and efforts did not immediately help improve the efficiency of steam engines; his theories only helped to explain why one existing practice was superior to others. It was only {{towards the end of the}} nineteenth century that Carnot's ideas, namely that a heat engine can be made more efficient if the temperature of its <b>hot</b> <b>reservoir</b> is increased, were put into practice. Carnot's book did, however, eventually have a real impact on the design of practical engines. Rudolf Diesel, for example, used Carnot's theories to design the diesel engine, in which the temperature of the <b>hot</b> <b>reservoir</b> is much higher than that of a steam engine, resulting in an engine which is more efficient.|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} thermodynamics, {{a commonly}} considered {{model is the}} heat engine. It consists of four bodies: the working body, the <b>hot</b> <b>reservoir,</b> the cold reservoir, and the work reservoir. A cyclic process leaves the working body in an unchanged state, and is envisaged as being repeated indefinitely often. Work transfers between the working body and the work reservoir are envisaged as reversible, and thus only one work reservoir is needed. But two thermal reservoirs are needed, because transfer of energy as heat is irreversible. A single cycle sees energy taken by the working body from the <b>hot</b> <b>reservoir</b> {{and sent to the}} two other reservoirs, the work reservoir and the cold reservoir. The <b>hot</b> <b>reservoir</b> always and only supplies energy and the cold reservoir always and only receives energy. The second law of thermodynamics requires that no cycle can occur in which no energy is received by the cold reservoir. Heat engines achieve higher efficiency when the difference between initial and final temperature is greater.|$|E
2500|$|The device has transported {{energy from}} a colder to a <b>hotter</b> <b>reservoir,</b> {{but this is}} not {{regarded}} as by an inanimate agency; rather, it is regarded as by the harnessing of work [...] This is because work is supplied from the work reservoir, not just by a simple thermodynamic process, but by a cycle of thermodynamic operations and processes, which may be regarded as directed by an animate or harnessing agency. Accordingly, the cycle is still in accord with the second law of thermodynamics. The efficiency of a heat pump is best when the temperature difference between the <b>hot</b> and cold <b>reservoirs</b> is least.|$|R
25|$|He {{showed that}} the {{efficiency}} of this idealized engine is a function only of the two temperatures of the reservoirs between which it operates. He did not, however, give the exact form of the function, which was later shown to be (T1−T2)/T1, where T1 is the absolute temperature of the <b>hotter</b> <b>reservoir.</b> (Note: This equation probably came from Kelvin.) No thermal engine operating any other cycle can be more efficient, given the same operating temperatures.|$|R
40|$|Clausius' {{statement}} of the second law of thermodynamics reads: Heat will flow spontaneously from a <b>hot</b> to cold <b>reservoir.</b> This statement should hold for transport of energy through a quantum network composed of small subsystems each coupled to a heat reservoir. When the coupling between nodes is small, {{it seems reasonable to}} construct a local master equation for each node in contact with the local reservoir. The energy transport through the network is evaluated by calculating the energy flux after the individual nodes are coupled. We show by analysing the most simple network composed of two quantum nodes coupled to a <b>hot</b> and cold <b>reservoir,</b> that the local description can result in heat flowing from cold to <b>hot</b> <b>reservoirs,</b> even in the limit of vanishing coupling between the nodes. A global derivation of the master equation which prediagonalizes the total network Hamiltonian, and within this framework derives the master equation, is always consistent with the second-law of thermodynamics...|$|R
25|$|This {{definition}} of efficiency {{makes sense for}} a heat engine, {{since it is the}} fraction of the heat energy extracted from the <b>hot</b> <b>reservoir</b> and converted to mechanical work. A Rankine cycle is usually the practical approximation.|$|E
25|$|Carnot's theorem is {{a formal}} {{statement}} of this fact: No engine operating between two heat reservoirs {{can be more}} efficient than a Carnot engine operating between those same reservoirs. Thus, Equation 3 (what's equation 3-a confused reader) gives the maximum efficiency possible for any engine using the corresponding temperatures. A corollary to Carnot's theorem states that: All reversible engines operating between the same heat reservoirs are equally efficient. Rearranging {{the right side of}} the equation gives what may be a more easily understood form of the equation. Namely that the theoretical maximum efficiency of a heat engine equals the difference in temperature between the hot and cold reservoir divided by the absolute temperature of the <b>hot</b> <b>reservoir.</b> Looking at this formula an interesting fact becomes apparent; Lowering the temperature of the cold reservoir will have more effect on the ceiling efficiency of a heat engine than raising the temperature of the <b>hot</b> <b>reservoir</b> by the same amount. In the real world, this may be difficult to achieve since the cold reservoir is often an existing ambient temperature.|$|E
25|$|Consider a {{heat engine}} working between two {{temperatures}} TH and Ta. With Ta we have ambient temperature in mind, but, in principle {{it may also}} be some other low temperature. The heat engine is in thermal contact with two heat reservoirs which are supposed to have a very large heat capacity so that their temperatures do not change significantly if heat QH is removed from the <b>hot</b> <b>reservoir</b> and Qa is added to the lower reservoir.

40|$|Geochemical {{models for}} Los Azufres and Los Humeros {{geothermal}} reservoirs are discussed. Los Azufres {{is defined as}} vapour-liquid (VAP-LIQ) and Los Humeros is mainly a vapour-dominated field. The geochemical conceptual model for Los Azufres reservoir {{was based on the}} spatial distribution of isotopic and chemical species in the reservoir fluid. Based on equilibrium of the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) reaction (CO 2 + 4 H 2 =CH 4 + 2 H 2 O), the “reservoir excess steam” parameter was estimated. This parameter was used to correct the total discharge composition of fluids to obtain the composition of fluids at reservoir. Results indicated that concentration of volatile species was higher at shallower levels while non-volatile species concentration was higher at depth. This pattern suggested the occurrence of a convective process with reservoir vapour separation and condensed vapour down-flows. For the Los Humeros geothermal field, where the liquid phase is scarce, two reservoirs were found, a <b>hotter</b> vapour-dominated <b>reservoir</b> located at depth and a liquid-dominated shallower one. Gas equilibria based on the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) reaction and on the pyrite-hematite and pyrite-magnetite (HSH 2) combined reactions provided both the reservoir temperature and the “excess steam” parameters.
