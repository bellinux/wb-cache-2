5|$|Lakers owner <b>Jack</b> <b>Kent</b> <b>Cooke</b> {{was known}} for having a keen eye {{identifying}} leadership and teaching qualities (he also gave Hall of Famers Sparky Anderson and Joe Gibbs their first managerial/head coaching positions), and asked West to coach and participate in player personnel decisions. In the 197677 season, West became coach of the Los Angeles Lakers. In three years, he led the Lakers and star center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to a 145–101 record, making the playoffs in all 3 seasons and reaching the Western Conference Finals once in 1977.|$|E
5|$|At the 1999 Women's World Cup in the United States, the German {{team also}} failed to qualify directly, but managed to beat the Ukraine in a {{qualifying}} play-off. Germany started their World Cup campaign by drawing with Italy and winning 6–0 over Mexico. In the last group game, Germany drew 3–3 against Brazil; by conceding a last minute equalizer, Germany failed to win the group and subsequently {{had to face the}} hosts in the quarter-final. With 54,642 people in attendance, among them U.S. President Bill Clinton, the crowd at the <b>Jack</b> <b>Kent</b> <b>Cooke</b> Stadium was the biggest the German team had ever played in front of. Despite leading twice, they lost 2–3 to the eventual World Cup winners.|$|E
50|$|In 1945, {{the station}} was sold to <b>Jack</b> <b>Kent</b> <b>Cooke's</b> Toronto Broadcasting Co., and adopted the callsign CKEY. It was {{subsequently}} acquired by Shoreacres Broadcasting, a consortium that included Westinghouse and The Globe and Mail, in 1961, and changed its frequency to 590 in 1964 as CKWW signed on at 580 that year in Windsor and CKAR, (known today as CFBK-FM), in Huntsville had to change its frequency from 590 to 630 kHz.|$|R
50|$|The Lakers {{earned the}} top {{pick of the}} 1979 NBA draft (traded as {{compensation}} by the New Orleans Jazz after signing Gail Goodrich in 1976) and selected Magic Johnson from Michigan State. It was one of then-owner <b>Jack</b> <b>Kent</b> <b>Cooke's</b> final acts before selling the team to Jerry Buss during that summer. While Magic dazzled in his rookie season, Kareem would enjoy an MVP campaign in the Lakers' 60-22 regular season. This despite an early season coaching change where Paul Westhead assumed head coaching duties following a bicycle accident to Jack McKinney.|$|R
50|$|Eight {{miles from}} the village of Middleburg, the area had long been home to many horse farms and since the mid-19th century, a center for equestrian events. By {{the early part of the}} 20th century Thoroughbred {{breeding}} operations were gaining importance and in 1930, Liz Whitney would be one of the first of a number of prominent personalities in Thoroughbred horse racing who would develop substantial and important breeding operations. Others who came to the area include heiress Isabel Dodge Sloane, who built the highly successful Brookmeade Stud, the very prestigious Rokeby Farm of Paul Mellon, <b>Jack</b> <b>Kent</b> <b>Cooke's</b> <b>Kent</b> Farms, and the Newstead Farm of Diana M. Firestone and her husband Bertram. Since the early 1960s, for two days each year more than ten horse farms and centers in Upperville and Middleburg open their gates to visitors.

5|$|The 1971–72 season brought several changes. Owner <b>Jack</b> <b>Kent</b> <b>Cooke</b> {{brought in}} Bill Sharman as head coach, and Elgin Baylor {{announced}} his retirement {{early in the season}} after realizing that his legs were not healthy enough. Sharman increased the team's discipline. He introduced the concept of the shootaround, where players would arrive at the arena early in the morning before a game to practice shots. They won 14 straight games in November and all 16 games played in December. They won three straight to open the year of 1972 but on January 9, the Milwaukee Bucks ended their winning streak by defeating the Lakers, 120–104. By winning 33 straight games, Los Angeles set a record for longest winning streak of any team in American professional sports. The Lakers won 69 games that season, which stood as the NBA record for 24 years until the Chicago Bulls won 72 games in 1995–96. Chamberlain averaged a low 14.8 points but led the league in rebounding at 19.2 a game. West's 9.7 assists per game (apg) led the league, he also averaged more than 25 points, and was named MVP of the 1972 NBA All-Star Game. The team failed to score 100 points just once all year, {{and at the end of}} the season, Bill Sharman was named Coach of the Year. The Lakers went on to reach the finals against the New York Knicks where they would avenge their 1970 finals loss by defeating them 4 games to 1. Chamberlain tallied 24 points and 29 rebounds in game five and won the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award.|$|E
25|$|The District's {{insistence that}} parking {{be built on}} Langston Golf Course, however, helped clinch a stadium agreement: On December 7, 1992, Redskins owner <b>Jack</b> <b>Kent</b> <b>Cooke</b> agreed to build his team's new stadium next to RFK Stadium. But rising Congressional {{opposition}} to the stadium deal (primarily due to the impact it would have on local residents and its high costs) imperiled the stadium deal. Congressional opposition rose significantly after the stadium's chief proponent, D.C. City Council Chairman John A. Wilson, committed suicide on May 19, 1993. By December, Redskins owner <b>Jack</b> <b>Kent</b> <b>Cooke</b> abandoned the D.C. site and pledged to build his stadium in Maryland. FedExField opened in Landover, Maryland, in August 1997.|$|E
25|$|The Federal City Council {{was less}} {{successful}} {{in keeping the}} Washington Redskins professional football team in town. In 1991 and 1992, team owner <b>Jack</b> <b>Kent</b> <b>Cooke</b> wanted a new stadium, but the cash-strapped city wanted to renovate Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium. When talks between the city and Cooke broke down, Federal City Council officials tried to restart them. Cooke cancelled the talks, and then announced he was building a new stadium in Landover, Maryland.|$|E
50|$|The Lakers {{acquired}} Wilt Chamberlain in 1968, {{which brought}} the personal rivalry {{between him and}} Bill Russell, previously {{a feature of the}} Celtics-76ers rivalry, to Celtics-Lakers. The Lakers posted {{the best record in the}} West during the 1968-1969 season. By contrast, the aging Celtics struggled to obtain the fourth seed, with Russell and Jones playing in their final seasons. Despite this, the Celtics upset the Philadelphia 76ers and the New York Knicks and made it to the Finals. The Lakers had home court advantage for the first time and won the first two games, but the Celtics rebounded to force and win a dramatic Game 7 at the Los Angeles Forum, defying Laker's owner <b>Jack</b> <b>Kent</b> <b>Cooke's</b> infamous prediction of a Lakers celebration. West was named Finals MVP despite being on the losing team, but it was small consolation in a decade where the Lakers went without a championship, every one of their Finals' losses in that decade coming at the hands of the Celtics.|$|R
5000|$|Ahead of the 1995 league expansion, {{eleven years}} after the Colts' {{controversial}} move to Indianapolis, the city of Baltimore expected to be granted an NFL franchise and put together its most attractive financial package. However, {{to make way for}} <b>Jack</b> <b>Kent</b> <b>Cooke's</b> ultimately unsuccessful plan to move the Washington Redskins to Laurel, Maryland, then-commissioner Paul Tagliabue convinced the league's team owners to pass over Baltimore. Franchises were instead granted to smaller TV markets in Charlotte, North Carolina and Jacksonville, Florida. In response to outrage in Baltimore, including then-governor William Donald Schaefer's threat to announce over the loudspeakers Tagliabue's exact location in Camden Yards any time he attended a Baltimore Orioles game, Tagliabue remarked, [...] "Maybe (Baltimore) can open another museum with that money." [...] Having failed to obtain a franchise via the expansion, the city, despite having [...] "misgivings," [...] turned to the possibility of obtaining an existing franchise, namely the Cleveland Browns, whose then-owner Art Modell was financially struggling and at odds with the city of Cleveland over needed improvements to the team's stadium.|$|R
5000|$|In 1972, the Kings {{made two}} key acquisitions. First, {{the rise of}} rookie goaltender Ken Dryden in Montreal made goaltender Rogie Vachon expendable, and the Kings {{obtained}} him in a trade with the Canadiens on November 4, 1971. After years of a [...] "revolving door" [...] in goal, Vachon solidified the position, often in spectacular fashion. For the next five years, the Forum was often filled with chants of [...] "Rogie!, Rogie!" [...] as Vachon made many a great save. In addition, the Kings obtained former Toronto Maple Leafs winger Bob Pulford, first {{as a player and}} then as their head coach. Under Pulford's disciplined direction, the Kings went from being one of the worst defensive teams in the league to one of the best. It took him just two seasons to lead the Kings back to the playoffs and in 1974, they faced the Chicago Blackhawks, only to be eliminated in five games. Pulford eventually led the team to three of the most successful seasons in franchise history, including a 105-point season in 1974-75 that is still a franchise record. They finished second behind Montreal in the Norris Division, which was relatively strong compared to the other divisions. Also in 1975 that season, due to the growing number of teams, the NHL introduced a new playoff structure, including a best of three preliminary round to the playoffs for the bottom eight of the qualifying twelve teams (the winners of each division automatically receiving a berth into the next round). With the fourth-best record in the league, the Kings were heavy favorites against the Maple Leafs, who finished with 78 points. Despite winning game one at home in the Forum, the Kings lost game two in Toronto on April 10. Due to scheduling conflicts, and owner <b>Jack</b> <b>Kent</b> <b>Cooke's</b> refusal to play an afternoon game on April 12, game three was played at the Forum the next day, April 11, instead, giving each team less rest between the games. The Kings, having an older core of players that were jet-lagged from the cross country flight right before the game, simply did not have the energy due to lack of rest and recovery, and were upset in the deciding game at home 2-1 by the lowly but younger Maple Leafs. As Bob Miller said in his book, Tales from the Los Angeles Kings, [...] "I'll never forget, with 10 seconds left, looking down from our broadcast location, seeing Toronto owner Harold Ballard and his sidekick King Clancy hugging and jumping {{up and down in the}} aisle as they eliminated the heavily favored Kings. It was such a disappointment after a tremendous season that Bob Pulford left the building in tears... because of Cooke's stubbornness the Kings' best season ever was wasted." ...|$|R
25|$|On January 13, 1981, owner <b>Jack</b> <b>Kent</b> <b>Cooke</b> {{signed the}} {{offensive}} {{coordinator of the}} San Diego Chargers, Joe Gibbs, as their head coach. Also during the off-season, the Redskins acquired Mark May, Russ Grimm, and Dexter Manley in the 1981 NFL Draft, all of whom became significant contributors to the team {{for the next few}} years. After starting the 1981 season 0–5, the Redskins won eight out of their next 11 games and finished the season 8–8.|$|E
25|$|Despite having {{teammates}} such as Alex Delvecchio and Mickey Redmond, Dionne's frustrations with losing were evident. His agent, Alan Eagleson {{pushed for}} more money. The {{owner of the}} Los Angeles Kings, <b>Jack</b> <b>Kent</b> <b>Cooke,</b> offered Dionne $300,000 per year. A deal was struck with the Red Wings and Dionne was traded for Terry Harper, Dan Maloney, cash, and draft picks; Dionne then signed with the Kings and became their franchise player. At the time, it was the richest deal in hockey history.|$|E
25|$|After two seasons, John Kent Cooke {{was unable}} to raise {{sufficient}} funds to permanently purchase the Redskins, and on May 25, 1999, Daniel Snyder gained unanimous approval (31–0) from league owners and bought the franchise for $800 million, a deal {{that was the most}} expensive team-purchasing deal in sporting history. One of his first acts as team owner occurred on November 21, 1999, when he sold the naming-rights to <b>Jack</b> <b>Kent</b> <b>Cooke</b> Stadium to the highest bidder, Federal Express, who renamed the stadium FedExField.|$|E

25|$|Lakers owner <b>Jack</b> <b>Kent</b> <b>Cooke</b> in 1979 was in {{the process}} of selling the team to Jerry Buss. Possessing the first overall pick in the {{upcoming}} 1979 NBA Draft, the Lakers narrowed their choice to either Magic Johnson or Sidney Moncrief. Los Angeles already had a fine point guard in Norm Nixon, making Moncrief potentially a wonderful complement at off guard. However, Cooke liked Johnson's smile and playing style. In one of Cooke's last acts as Lakers owner, the Lakers drafted the point guard Johnson.|$|E
25|$|The Los Angeles Kings are a {{professional}} ice hockey team based in Los Angeles. They {{are members of}} the Pacific Division of the Western Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). The team was founded on June 5, 1967, after <b>Jack</b> <b>Kent</b> <b>Cooke</b> was awarded an NHL expansion franchise for Los Angeles on February 9, 1966, becoming one of the six teams that began play as part of the 1967 NHL expansion. The Kings called The Forum in Inglewood, California (a suburb of Los Angeles), their home for thirty-two years until they moved to the Staples Center in Downtown Los Angeles to start the 1999–2000 season.|$|E
25|$|One {{reason for}} the team's struggles was disarray in the front office. Marshall began a mental decline in 1962, and the team's other {{stockholders}} {{found it difficult to}} make decisions without their boss. Marshall died on August 9, 1969, and Edward Bennett Williams, a minority stockholder who was a Washington resident and one of America's most esteemed attorneys, was chosen to run the franchise while the majority stockholder, <b>Jack</b> <b>Kent</b> <b>Cooke,</b> lived in Los Angeles and ran his basketball team, the Los Angeles Lakers. In 1966 Otto Graham was hired as the new head coach. Graham coached the Redskins between 1966 and 1968, but whatever magic he had as an NFL player disappeared on the sidelines as the team recorded a mark of 17–22–3 during that time period. After resigning the Redskins' post in favor of Vince Lombardi, Graham returned as athletic director of the Coast Guard Academy before retiring at the end of 1984.|$|E

25|$|The National Capital Planning Commission quickly {{approved}} of the transfer. However, various other groups were opposed to the theme park development, including several Advisory Neighborhood Commissions, the Anacostia Watershed Society, the Capitol Hill Restoration Society, and the Committee of 100 on the Federal City (a highly influential businesspersons' and civic leaders' organization). The D.C. City Council nonetheless approved the land transfer on July 13, 1993, although it also required that any plans for the islands be submitted to the council for approval. The Council also required the company to complete an environmental impact assessment {{and more than a}} dozen other studies and present them to the Council before any development could proceed. Meanwhile, the loss of parking space to the children's theme park and rising Congressional opposition to the stadium deal (primarily due to the impact it would have on local residents and its high costs) imperiled the D.C. stadium deal. Congressional opposition rose significantly after the stadium's chief proponent, D.C. City Council Chairman John A. Wilson, committed suicide on May 19, 1993.

Lakers owner <b>Jack</b> <b>Kent</b> <b>Cooke</b> gave Chamberlain an unprecedented contract, paying him $250,000 after taxes (about $ million in real value); in comparison, previous Lakers top earner Jerry West was paid $100,000 before taxes (about $,000 in real value).|$|E
