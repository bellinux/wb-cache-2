Based on the report, the <b>Health</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Financing</b> Administration fined the HHC $3,050 per day for every day the former residents remained in sub-par housing, totaling $450,000. In December 1998, a portion of the complex, the Neponsit Adult Day Health Care which provided outpatient physical therapy, was relocated to the gymnasium of the Young Israel of Far Rockaway synagogue in Far Rockaway. A second court ruling on October 29, 1999, stated that the HHC overextended its authority when evacuating the facility, and blocked demolition. Despite this, the Giuliani administration continued to try and demolitish the building. In March 2000, a structural evaluation was conducted by the New York City Council, finding the three Neponsit buildings to be in good condition, with repairs estimated at $600,000.|$|E

The state faced pressure from the federal government to make changes to the federal waiver that allows the state to operate an expanded Medicaid program. Under the existing waiver, the state was receiving $385 million in federal funds to reimburse hospitals for services provided to the uninsured. The free care pool had to be restructured so that individuals, rather than institutions, received the funding.
