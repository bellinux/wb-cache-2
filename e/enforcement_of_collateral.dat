40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} {{terms and conditions}} of credit contracts with characteristics typically found in microfinance settings influence investment and repayment decisions. Dynamic programming models are developed for individual and for group loan contracts. The models generate repayment frontiers for specific lending technologies. The effects of characteristics of these lending technologies, in particular rationing rules, on repayment behavior, focusing on strategic default, are analyzed by performing simulations. The characteristics of microfinance contracts result from the lender’s handling of information asymmetries, incompatible incentives, and <b>enforcement</b> constraints (absence <b>of</b> <b>collateral).</b> Credit-constrained borrowers enter loan contracts to maximize utility from their inter-temporal consumption. As credit constraints are overcome, borrowers experience increasing incentives to default. The need to keep them credit-constrained to avoid default creates a trade-off between sustainability of the microlending organization and optimization {{of the level of}} borrower investment. Dynamic programming models explain this trade-off in contracts where the threa...|$|R

30|$|Since {{empirical}} studies {{have identified a}} significant positive influence <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> on the recovery rate, {{there has been a}} second strand of literature, in which the <b>collateral</b> provided, instead <b>of</b> the individual debtors or loans, is studied. Studies in this field analyze the fundamental value of different forms <b>of</b> <b>collateral,</b> such as collateral in real estate, guarantees, etc. The fundamental value is measured by the proceeds ratio, which relates the realized proceeds to the original fundamental value assumed by the bank. Grunert (2010) analyzes potential factors influencing the proceeds ratio, based on a German data set consisting of 104 pieces <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> (<b>of</b> which 62 are collateral in real estate). The average proceeds ratio is 61  %, and the author concludes that the proceeds ratio fluctuates depending on the type <b>of</b> <b>collateral.</b> Franks et al. (2004) analyze the fundamental value <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> for 790 pieces <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> in Germany, France, and Great Britain. The German subsample consists of 120 pieces <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> with an average proceeds ratio of 73  % (median 77  %). The authors likewise conclude that the average proceeds ratio fluctuates depending on the type <b>of</b> <b>collateral.</b> Nevertheless, an above-average fundamental value <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> in real estate is pointed out. Their result coincides with practical experience: according to a survey carried out by Grunert (2009), banking professionals have identified collateral in real estate to have the highest fundamental value.|$|R

40|$|The authors build a {{theoretical}} model that generates demand for collateral by Large Value Transfer System (LVTS) participants {{under the assumption}} that they minimize the cost of holding and managing collateral for LVTS purposes. The model predicts that the optimal amount <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> held by each LVTS participant depends on the opportunity cost <b>of</b> <b>collateral,</b> the transactions costs of acquiring assets used as collateral and transferring them {{in and out of the}} LVTS, and the distribution of an LVTS participant's payment flows in the LVTS. The authors conclude that the aggregate amount <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> pledged to the LVTS is quite close to that predicted by the model, when benchmark values are used for opportunity and transactions costs that are based on anecdotal evidence, despite the fact that these costs are likely to vary among participants. If one LVTS participant that appears to face a lower opportunity cost <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> is excluded from the analysis, the model predicts an aggregate level <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> that is within 5 per cent of the amount actually held by LVTS participants, on average, between February 1999 and May 2003. The authors also apply panel-data regressions to the level <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> held in the LVTS. They find that the results are broadly supportive of the theoretical model. Sensitivity analysis of this model indicates that, when the opportunity cost <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> increases, the amount <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> that participants hold could be greatly reduced. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the effect <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> on moral hazard and credit volume. A standard theoretical {{argument for the}} use <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> is its power in reducing problems of moral hazard. However, collateral may {{also be used as}} a screening device and existing empirical studies have not isolated the incentive effect <b>of</b> <b>collateral.</b> This paper uses experimental tools to identify the effect. The results show that collateral significantly decreases moral hazard when interest rates are low. Interestingly, if interest rates are high, it does not. The results suggest that borrowers’loss aversion offsets the incentive effect <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> when interest rates are high. Importantly, collateral increases credit supply. But, if interest rates are high, increases in collateral also lead to a decrease in credit demand. These findings suggest that, in credit markets with high interest rates, the effect <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> on moral hazard and credit volume may be weaker than expected...|$|R

Using the record of actual loan defaults of borrowers {{as a measure of}} credit quality, we find that the use <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> is higher in loans to low credit quality borrowers. The likelihood <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> is also higher when the lender is a small bank, when the lender is a savings bank and in loans made in periods of low economic growth. On the other hand, the use <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> is less likely in loans made to borrowers with longer relationship with the lender and in more concentrated credit markets. A higher risk free interest rate of the economy and a smaller size of the loan increase the likelihood that a loan will be totally secured with <b>collateral</b> instead <b>of</b> partially secured. Overall the result are consistent with theories that explain the use <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> as a consequence of information asymmetries in credit markets, although the effect of macroeconomic conditions in the use <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> remains unexplained. ...|$|R

BACKGROUNDThere is limited information regarding the hemodynamic quantification <b>of</b> recruitable <b>collateral</b> vessels. METHODSAngiography <b>of</b> the donor coronary artery was performed before and during balloon coronary occlusion in 63 patients with one vessel disease. Patients were divided into groups of those with an absence <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> vessels (group 1, n = 10), those with recruitable collateral vessels (group 2, n = 23) and those with spontaneously visible collateral vessels (group 3, n = 30). During balloon inflation the coronary wedge/aortic pressure ratio (Pw/Pao) was determined as were collateral blood flow velocity variables, using a 0. 014 ″ Doppler guide wire. Myocardial ischemia was defined as ≥ 0. 1 mV ST-shift on a 12 lead electrocardiogram at 1 min coronary occlusion. RESULTSMyocardial ischemia was present in all patients of group 1, in 14 patients of group 2 and in 3 patients of group 3. Recruitable collateral flow without ischemia showed similar hemodynamic values as in group 3 while these values were similar to group 1 in regard to the presence <b>of</b> recruitable <b>collateral</b> vessels showing ischemia. Logistic regression analysis revealed both Pw/Pao and Vicolas independent predictors for the function <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> vessels. CONCLUSIONSHemodynamic variables <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> vascular circulation are better markers of the functional significance <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> vessels than is coronary angiography.

40|$|While {{financial}} liberalization has {{in general}} favorable effects, reforms {{in countries with}} poor regulation is often followed by financial crises.

Methods and resultsWhile many methods have been used to assess collateral blood flow only a few have been formally validated. Collateral flow index, as determined by measurement of intra-coronary pressure or flow velocity, is the most robust measure <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> flow.
