40|$|Aggression between {{species is}} a seldom-considered but {{potentially}} widespread mechanism of character displacement in secondary sexual characters. Based on previous {{research showing that}} similarity in wing coloration directly influences interspecific territorial aggression in Hetaerina damselflies, we predicted that wing coloration would show a pattern of character displacement (divergence in sympatry). A geographical survey of four Hetaerina damselfly species in Mexico and Texas showed evidence for character displacement in both species pairs that regularly occurs sympatrically. Hetaerina titia, a species that typically has large black wing spots and small <b>red</b> <b>wing</b> spots, shifted to having even larger black spots and smaller <b>red</b> <b>wing</b> spots at sites where a congener with large <b>red</b> <b>wing</b> spots is numerically dominant (Hetaerina americana or Hetaerina occisa). Hetaerina americana showed the reverse pattern, shifting towards larger <b>red</b> <b>wing</b> spots where H. titia is numerically dominant. This pattern {{is consistent with the}} process of agonistic character displacement, but the ontogenetic basis of the shift remains to be demonstrated...|$|R

40|$|Using Lyα {{emission}} line as a tracer of high redshift star forming galaxies, hundreds of Lyα {{emission line}} galaxies (LAEs) at z > 5 have been detected. These LAEs {{are considered to}} be low mass young galaxies, critical to the reionization of the universe and the metal enrichment of circumgalactic medium (CGM) and intergalactic medium (IGM). It is assumed that outflows in LAEs can help ionizing photons and Lyα photons escape out of galaxies. However we still know little about the outflows in high redshifts LAEs due to observational difficulties, especially at redshift > 5. Models of Lyα radiative transfer predict asymmetric Lyα line profiles with broad <b>red</b> <b>wing</b> in LAEs with outflows. Here we report a z 5. 7 Lyα emission line with a broad <b>red</b> <b>wing</b> extending to > 1000 km/s relative to the peak of Lyα line, which has been detected in only a couple of z > 5 LAEs till now. If the broad <b>red</b> <b>wing</b> is ascribed to gas outflow instead of AGN activity, the outflow velocity could be larger than the escape velocity (500 km/s) of typical halo mass of z 5. 7 LAEs, being consistent with the picture that outflows in LAEs disperse metals to CGM and IGM.

40|$|A {{transient}} event {{consistent with}} the predicted temporal and spectral signatures of an energetic proton beam was detected in the impulsive phase of a small flare on the red dwarf star AU Microscopii. It consisted of a prominent increase in the flux in the <b>red</b> <b>wing</b> of Lyman-alpha near 1223 A, simultaneously with the peak of a flare observed in the 1206 A transition region line of Si III. The probability that the <b>red</b> <b>wing</b> event was a chance fluctuation is one chance in 2. 5 x 10 exp 4. This observation represents a confirmation of the prediction by Orrall and Zirker (1976) in which downstreaming protons accelerated during the impulsive phase of a flare charge exchange with ambient neutral hydrogen and emit Lyman-alpha radiation from 1 to 15 A redward of line center...|$|R
