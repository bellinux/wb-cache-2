5|$|Book XI covers <b>human</b> <b>beings,</b> portents and transformations. Isidore derives <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> (homo) {{from the}} Latin for soil (humus), as in Genesis 2:7 {{it says that}} man is made from the soil. Urine (urina) gets its name either {{from the fact that}} it can burn (urere) the skin or, Isidore hedges, that it is from the kidneys (renes). Femina, meaning woman, comes from femora/femina meaning thighs, as this part of the body shows she is not a man. The Latin for {{buttocks}} is clunis as they are near the large intestine or colon (colum).|$|E

5|$|Some {{philosophers}} take an epistemic {{approach and}} argue that the mind–body problem is currently unsolvable, and perhaps will always remain unsolvable to <b>human</b> <b>beings.</b> This is usually termed New mysterianism. Colin McGinn holds that <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> are cognitively closed in regards to their own minds. According to McGinn human minds lack the concept-forming procedures to fully grasp how mental properties such as consciousness arise from their causal basis. An example would be how an elephant is cognitively closed in regards to particle physics.|$|E

Thus, the {{philosophy of}} self-respect taught that human actions should be guided by reason, right and wrong should follow from rational thinking and conclusions drawn from reason should be respected under circumstances. Freedom means respect to thoughts and actions considered 'right' by <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> on the basis of 'reason'. There is not much difference between 'freedom' and 'self-respect'.|$|E

This article does not show the relation between human characters, male and female. Instead, it limits the discussion on the <b>human</b> <b>being</b> portrayed by Koran not considering the division of male and female. In this phase, male and female are the same. They are not burdened by unique load for each male and female <b>human</b> <b>being.</b> Instead, they are given characteristics as <b>human</b> <b>being</b> according to the existence.
