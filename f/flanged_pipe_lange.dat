From previous comparative reliability studies of both gasketed and non-gasketed bolted <b>flanged</b> <b>pipe</b> joints, generally it is found that both the joints types are of high integrity and perform well in excellent service under appropriate installation and maintenance conditions. However, based on certain factors better functional safety for non-gasketed joints can be achieved. All studies have been performed based on operational information and reported observations. This study reported herein presents a detailed failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) in the light of industrial surveys, analysis, experimental work and subsequent observations in addition to previous studies. The aim of the study is to increase the reliability knowledge of the gasketed and non-gasketed <b>flanged</b> <b>pipe</b> joints and thereby to increase the basis for finding the optimal pipe connection based on surveys, observation and experimental studies performed...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Apparently no {{analytical}} method {{is available to}} analyze the bolt tension in a <b>flanged</b> <b>pipe</b> joint subjected to flexure {{taking into account the}} actual stress distribution at the joint. Conventionally, a method similar to the flexural analysis of beam is sometimes applied on the assumption that bolt tension is proportional to the distance from neutral axis which is far from the actual stress condition. In this paper, an investigation has been carried out to find the effects of various parameters relating to <b>flanged</b> <b>pipe</b> joint connection, so that a definite guideline on determining the bolt tension can be developed. In addition, results are compared with the conventional analysis. To carry out the investigation, a <b>flanged</b> <b>pipe</b> joint subjected to bending has been modeled using finite element method, which also includes contact simulation. In this analysis, shell element has been used for the modeling of pipe and flange. Non-linear spring has been used to model contact surface and bolt. Non-linear finite element method has been used to find out results till failure by yielding of pipe. Joint has been subjected to ultimate moment and under this moment; the maximum bolt tension has been evaluated. Based on the study, an attempt has been made to present a guideline to find out bolt tension that is structurally effective for a <b>flanged</b> <b>pipe</b> joint. The whole process is carried out under various parametric conditions within certain range. It has been found that some parameters like flange thickness...|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} known that {{resonance}} can quickly lead to failure in vibrating bolted <b>flanged</b> <b>pipe</b> joints. Condition monitoring is performed {{time to time}} in some industries for smooth operation of a system, whereas mostly trial-and-error tests are performed to control vibration. During all this process, the inherent design problems are not considered. A bolted flange joint in piping system is not a simple problem, being the combination of flange, gasket, bolts, and washers. The success of a bolted <b>flanged</b> <b>pipe</b> joint is defined by the “static mode of load” in the joint. However, it has been recognized that a “dynamic mode of load” governs in a gasketed bolted <b>flanged</b> <b>pipe</b> joint, which leads to its failure due to flange rotation, providing flange yielding, fatigue of bolts, and gasket crushing.

40|$|Abstract – Welding {{produces}} {{residual stresses}} and distortion, having detrimental effect on structure integrity and service {{performance of the}} welded pipe joints. This paper investigates residual stresses and distortion during Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) of pipes of schedule 40 and 60, nominal diameter 100 mm and 200 mm and thickness 8 mm and 10 mm with ANSI flanges of class 300 #. Welding parameters including voltage, current and heat input are varied to find the optimized set to control stresses and deformations. Stress variation on the flange side is observed prominent compared to the pipe side due to its dimensional variation. Axial flange displacement along 360 degrees is also concluded obvious, hence effecting sealing performance of the gasketed <b>flanged</b> <b>pipe</b> joints...|$|R

A simple experimental assembly is rotated using the Horizontal Air Bearing and allowed to spin freely as the internal rotational damping is measured. The low friction of the bearing effectively isolates the test assembly, allowing the internal damping of the test object to be evaluated. The experimental assembly is composed of an aluminum ball within a spherical cavity. A <b>flanged</b> <b>pipe</b> section and an auxiliary adapter plate secure the assembly to the Air Bearing interface plate. Three aluminum balls are interchanged to vary test parameters. The aluminum balls are free to move independently as the entire assembly rotates. The aluminum balls vary in diameter and/or surface finish.

40|$|International audienceThe {{measurement}} of acoustic intensity assumes {{taking the time}} average of the energy flow and treating the intensity as a real quantity. However, one may extract additional information if the intensity {{is viewed as a}} complex quantity which contains information about the local mean energy flow and local energy oscillations. In this paper experiments are reported using a tri-axial Microflown intensity probe to measure the complex instantaneous intensity near the open end of a <b>flanged</b> <b>pipe.</b> The measurements are then used to quantify the energy travelling out of the pipe and the energy oscillating back and forth inside the pipe. This has a potential significance for acoustic detection of structural and operational conditions inside the pipe as one would expect oscillating energy to be increased and travelling energy to be decreased {{in the presence of a}} cross-sectional change. These experiments are carried out in the high frequency range to show the interaction between a plane wave and the first circumferential mode. Here, the amplitude of the circumferential mode is found to be strongly related to the relative position of the source in the pipe, and the complex intensity is seen to change in transverse as well as the axial direction...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: From {{analytical}} {{contact pressure}} studies of gasketed and non-gasketed <b>flanged</b> <b>pipe</b> joints, {{it is known}} that good contact maintained over consistently large areas occurs in a no-gasketed flange joint compared with a gasketed joint, where contact is only on the seal ring portion of the gasket. However, the presence of contact pressure and a good flange surface finish does not in itself eliminate the problem of leakage. Rather, it is the surface flatness in combination with contact pressure and surface finish that is necessary to generate effective contact at the inside diameter of the flange. This occurs providing there are no gaps due to deformation arising from the welding process to the mating pipe as flow is proportional to gap height. However, the question remains as how to ensure adequate surface flatness as non-gasketed flange surfaces are sensitive to damage, which may be present in the form of surface deformation, scratches and dents or bulges. A detailed experimental study is therefore carried out to measure the surface finish and surface flatness post manufacture and welding of such flanges. Results of actual flanges were compared with solid circular plates of the same dimension with inserted shims to provide gaps in order that flow rate/gap height ratio be studied. Manufacturing issues with respect to monitoring and controlling deformations are discussed and recommendations are suggested for flange redesign, appropriate welding approaches and manual handling of non-gasketed flanges...|$|R

The study also included evaluation of liners applied by hand on pipe pieces that cannot be lined by rotary methods. Such pipe pieces include tees, elbows and <b>flanged</b> <b>pipe</b> sections. Results are reported from a corrosion survey of 17 different liner formulations tested at the-Big-Rill SPR Site. Testing consisted of electrochemical corrosion rate measurements made on lined pipe sections exposed, in a test manifold, to flowing SPR generated fluids. Testing also involved cumulative immersion exposure where samples were exposed to static site-generated brine for increasing periods of time. Samples were returned to the laboratory for various diagnostic analyses. Results of this study showed that standard calcium silicate concrete (API RP 10 E) and a rotary calcium aluminate concrete formulation were excellent performers. Hand-lined pipe pieces did not provide as much corrosion protection. The focus of {{the second part of the}} study was on further evaluation of the calcium silicate, calcium aluminate and hand-applied liners in actual SPR equipment and service. It was a further objective to assess the practicality of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for field corrosion monitoring of concrete lined pipe compared to the more well-known linear polarization technique. This study showed that concrete linings reduced the corrosion rate for bare steel from 10 to 15 mils per year to 1 mil per year or less. Again, the hand-applied liners did not provide as much corrosion protection as the rotary-applied liners. The EIS technique was found to be robust for field corrosion measurements.

40|$|International audienceA hybrid {{finite element}} method is used to model wave {{propagation}} in a <b>flanged</b> cylindrical <b>pipe</b> containing a monopole source. Here, a modal expansion is used to represent sound propagation in the exterior domain and this avoids the use of perfectly matched layers normally found in commercial software packages. Complex intensity in the pipe is then obtained and the real part of the complex intensity is shown to represent the local travelling energy and the imaginary part the local oscillating energy. Results are presented in the plane wave region and at higher frequencies, where the first circumferential mode has cut-on. The predicted complex intensity is then compared to experimental measurements and generally good agreement is observed. From this it is seen that {{the interaction between the}} acoustic pressure in the plane wave and the acoustic particle velocity in the first circumferential mode mainly contributes to the transverse flow of energy flow in the pipe, whilst the interaction between the acoustic pressure in the first circumferential mode pressure and the acoustic particle velocity in the first circumferential mode contributes to energy oscillation...|$|R
40|$|Use of bolted <b>flanged</b> <b>pipe</b> joints is {{very common}} in petrochemical, nuclear and process industry. Welding of pipe to flange results in {{residual}} stress built up and distortions which provide negative effects on the structural integrity and sealing capability of the pipe flange joint. The effects include stress corrosion cracking, brittle fracture, reduced fatigue and creep strengths, poor sealing performance and reduced buckling strength etc. The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the extent and distribution of residual stress built up and distortions in the welded pipe-flange joints. The effects of welding parameters, welding procedure, applied mechanical constraints on residual stress built-up and distortions are evaluated. Effort are made to suggest the preventive or corrective measures for the reduction of welding distortions and residual stresses to improve the performance and service life of welded pipe-flange joints. This thesis is organized in three phases. In the first phase, preliminary studies for implementation of numerical technique for welding simulation and selection of appropriate models are performed. In the second phase, welding residual stresses are investigated including their dependence on welding parameters and their mitigation technique. The third phase is associated with the welding deformations. In Chapter- 1, a general introduction of welding deformation and residual stresses and their effect in pipe-flange joints in presented. In Chapter- 2, a comprehensive literature review of experimental and finite element simulation of welding in general and its application in circumferential joint in particular is discussed. Chapter- 3, describes the general finite element formulation and its application technique for material modeling, heat source modeling, modeling of filler material and analysis procedure etc. Chapter- 4, presents a comparative study of two and three-dimensional FE models of the pipe-flange joint subjected to a welding process. The aim of this study was to select an appropriate FE model for forth coming parametric numerical studies with the objective to investigate residual stresses and deformations. In Chapter- 5, experimental validation procedure has been described and a few selective validations are also presented. The objective of this chapter is to establish the reader confidence over the accuracy of numerical results. Chapter- 6, describes the effect of welding (Current and speed) and geometrical (pipe diameter and thickness) parameters on residual stress profile. In Chapter- 7, an analytical study regarding mitigation of residual stresses using mechanical stress relieving is presented and the effects of internal pressure, external pressure and axial pull on the residual stresses are determined. The objective {{of this study is to}} explore the most effective mode of mechanical stress relieving. In Chapter- 8, the issues related to welding procedure specifications are addressed. In this chapter a numerical procedure for modeling of tack welds is suggested. In addition, the effect of tack weld locations on welding deformations and residual stresses are investigated and appropriate position for the tack welds is suggested. The effect of root gap is also analyzed and presented.

The new OGT line will provide a waste transfer pipeline between these valve pits in support of saltwell pumping activities. The length of the OGT line is approximately 180 ft from pit to pit. The primary pipe is nominal 1 -in. diameter stainless steel (SST) braided Ethylene-propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) hose. The encasement pipe is a nominal 3 -in., <b>flanged,</b> SST <b>pipe</b> made up of several different length pipe spool pieces (drawing H- 2 - 829564, sh. 1 and sh. 2). The OGT line slopes from valve pit 241 -S-B toward valve pit 241 -S-D. At each end, the primary and encasement pipe connect to a pit entry spool piece. The pit entry spool pieces are constructed of prefabricated SST materials. These spool pieces allow for {{the separation of the}} primary and encasement pipelines after the pipes have entered the valve pits (drawing H- 2 - 818280, sh. 2). The pit entry spool pieces also allow for leak detection of the encasement pipe at each end (drawing H- 2 - 829564, sh. 2). The OGT encasement pipeline is supported above ground by adjustable height unistrut brackets and precast concrete bases (drawing H- 2 - 829654, sh. 1). The pipeline is heat-traced and insulated.

40|$|The {{future of}} new {{nuclear power plant}} {{construction}} will depend {{in large part on}} the ability of designers to reduce capital, operations, and maintenance costs. One of the methods proposed, is to enhance the modularity of the designs in which the basic plant is broken down into modules, each of which is built offsite at a "factory", transported to the plant site, and assembled into a working plant using a minimum amount of labor and tooling. The value of this approach is that it improves overall quality, reduces site field work and rework, and speeds the construction of the plant. This approach also takes advantage of economies of mass-production, rather than relying on economy of scale to reduce costs. The ability to remove and replace modules for repair and maintenance also leads to reduced costs and downtime. Past work at MIT has resulted in a reference design that takes into account modularity. Based on this reference cycle design, a detailed analysis and modularity design of a power producing plant was performed. This design takes into account the goals for the modularity and construction approach. (cont.) The plant takes the factory approach to its logical conclusion, resulting in a "virtual factory" where each major component is integrated into a modular space-frame by its manufacturer. Each module is designed to be transported by truck (although, if the necessary infrastructure is available the modules could be transported at potentially lower cost by rail or barge) to the construction site. The plant site itself requires only simple excavation and the plant containment building is a simple, reinforced poured concrete structure. Assembly of the plant is simple by comparison to conventional facilities as the modularity approach requires that each space-frame module be stacked together, <b>pipe</b> <b>flanged</b> bolted together, a self-test performed, and the plant started. In order to make this assembly method possible a pressure-backed insulation system was designed. This insulation system reduces the temperature of the pressure boundary, enabling the use of lower-cost alloys for system construction. The metallic liner and insulation layer also reduce the temperature swings of the piping and vessel walls, reducing thermal expansion loads that must be borne by the structure of the system. (cont.) To enable flange-joints between component modules a scavenged flange design was created. This flange design enables redundant sealing of the pressure boundary, and also prevents Helium loss and contamination of the plant. This design also enables monitoring of the flange integrity. This design should enable the MIT pebble bed reactor to meet the cost, operations and maintenance goals of an advanced reactor. by Marc Vincent Berte. Thesis (S. M.)
