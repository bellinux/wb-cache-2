5|$|Both of the attendants– Dakini to {{her left}} and Varnini to her right– are {{depicted}} nude, with matted or dishevelled hair, three-eyed, full-breasted, wearing the serpentine sacred thread and the mundamala, and carrying the skull-bowl in the left hand and the knife in the right. Sometimes, the attendants also hold severed heads (not their own). While Dakini <b>is</b> <b>fair,</b> Varnini is red-complexioned. In other depictions, both are depicted blue-grey. Sometimes, her attendants are depicted as skeletons and drinking the dripping blood from Chhinnamasta's severed head, rather than her neck. The attendants are absent in some depictions.|$|E

5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> {{to assume}} that the average Joe/Jane is neither a college {{graduate}} nor a high school drop-out. It is, however, difficult {{to determine whether or not}} the average American has some college education as the population is split between those who did and did not attend college. Over the past half century the educational attainment of the US population has significantly increased.|$|E
5|$|Sibu BASE jump is {{an annual}} event that is held in September every year since 2009, which lasts for 3 days. Night jumps are also {{performed}} if the weather <b>is</b> <b>fair.</b> The BASE jumping usually takes place {{from the top of}} Wisma Sanyan which is 126 m high and is the tallest building in Sarawak. The number of jumpers has increased from 11 jumpers in 2009 to 45 jumpers in 2014. In 2013, world's first tandem BASE jumping from a building (Wisma Sanyan in Sibu) was done by Sean Chuma (world-renowned BASE jumper), carrying Rudy Anoi (chief executive of Sarawak Tourism Board, Sibu branch) with him.|$|E
5|$|A UTI affects {{parts of}} the urinary system {{including}} the urethra, bladder, and kidneys. There is about a one percent risk of UTIs in boys under two years of age, {{and the majority of}} incidents occur {{in the first year of}} life. There is good but not ideal evidence that circumcision of babies reduces the incidence of UTIs in boys under two years of age, and there <b>is</b> <b>fair</b> evidence that the reduction in incidence is by a factor of 310 times (100 circumcisions prevents one UTI). Prevention of UTIs does not justify routine use of the procedure, however. Circumcision is most likely to benefit boys who have a high risk of UTIs due to anatomical defects, and may be used to treat recurrent UTIs.|$|E

5|$|Kapoor {{practices}} vegetarianism, and {{credits the}} author Brian Hines' book Life <b>is</b> <b>Fair</b> for influencing this lifestyle choice. He also supports charitable organisations for various causes. In 2010, he {{took part in}} a charity event named Superstars Ka Jalwa, which helped generate money for the employees of the Cine and Television Artists Association (CINTAA). Also that year, he lent his support to the NGO Swayamsiddh, which helps children with special needs. The following year, he adopted three villages in support of NDTV's Greenathon, an initiative to support environmental consciousness and improve electricity supplies to rural areas. In 2012, Kapoor helped revive the Victory Arts Foundation NGO, founded by Shiamak Davar, which helps underprivileged children through dance therapy programs. Also that year, he appeared alongside other Bollywood celebrities in Because My World Is Not The Same, a short film by Zoya Akhtar, to generate awareness on breast cancer. He supports the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals organisation through advertisement campaigns.|$|E

50|$|Amount and substantiality of {{the portion}} used in {{relation}} to the copyrighted work as a whole: Courts look at both {{the quantity and quality of}} the copyrighted material that was used.

However, courts have occasionally found use of an entire work to <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> use, and in other contexts, using even a small amount of a copyrighted work was determined not to <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> use because the selection was an important part—or the “heart”—of the work.|$|R
