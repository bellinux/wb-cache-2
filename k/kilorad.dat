40|$|The {{effects of}} ⁶⁰Co {{irradiation}} on Amblyomma hebraeum Koch, 1844 were studied by mating normal females to males irradiated to attain dosages of 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 <b>kilorad.</b> The males of all 5 groups were observed mating 7 days after {{being placed on}} the host. The higher the irradiation dosage received by the males, progressively longer were the feeding periods of the females mated with them and fewer completed their engorgement. Furthermore, {{the mass of the}} females when engorged was lower, fewer laid eggs and the number of eggs they laid decreased progressively. None of the egg batches produced by females mated with irradiated males hatched. No chromosomal abnormalities or discrepancies in spermiophore formation were found in the 2 and 4 <b>kilorad</b> group males, while no micro- or macroscopical growth of the 6 and 8 <b>kilorad</b> group male testes took place, although accessory gland development appeared normal. A. hebraeum males have a chromosome complement of 10 bivalents and a univalent sex chromosome. The articles have been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 300 dpi.

40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to {{attenuate}} Cowdria ruminantium by irradiation of the nymphal stage of its tick host, Amblyomma hebraeum. The irradiated nymphae were homogenized and serial dilutions of the resultant suspension were injected intravenously into heartwater-susceptible sheep. No attenuation could be demonstrated but the results indicate that progressively more micro-organisms will be destroyed the higher the irradiation dosage applied, and that dosages between 20 and 30 <b>kilorad</b> apparently prove fatal to all the pathogenic organisms.

40|$|Six calves were immunized with schistosomula of Schistosoma bovis {{irradiated}} at 3 or 20 <b>Kilorad</b> (Krad) {{and three}} calves were kept as controls. Twenty four weeks post immunization, three calves (one from the 20 Krad and {{two from the}} 3 Krad group) were challenged with normal cercaria of S. bovis. The immune response was monitored by agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) and the Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) using adult worm antigen. Using AGID, precipitin lines were observed only with sera from challenged animals. Using ELISA, the immune response of the vaccinated calves was first detected by 2 - 3 weeks, peaking by 6 - 8 weeks post vaccination. The immune response of the three challenged calves was elevated by 2 weeks post challenge, peaking at 8 - 10 weeks post challenge and remained high throughout the experimental period. This study suggests that ELISA {{could be used for}} diagnosis of bovine schistosomiasis...|$|E

40|$|The {{protection}} and immune response to infection {{caused by the}} parasite Schistosoma mansoni were studied by comparison of two murine irradiated-vaccine models. Mice were exposed from 1 to 4 times to infective-stage cercariae attenuated with either a moderate dose (15 <b>kilorads)</b> or a high dose (50 <b>kilorads)</b> of radiation. Seven weeks after challenge infection, the mice were assessed for resistance, liver size, and lymphokine responses to parasite antigens. Both vaccine models showed high levels of protection, but the moderate-dose model proved superior in that mice in those groups achieved higher levels of resistance in fewer exposures. Additionally, the mice exposed three times and four times to moderately irradiated cercariae all had significantly lower liver weights independent of worm burden. Assessment of lymphokine production by the spleen cells {{at the time of}} perfusion showed that gamma interferon was the only lymphokine of those measured that was differentially produced in the two models and correlated with a decrease in size of in vitro granulomas. The findings suggest that a selected vaccine regimen may lead to greater resistance and decreased liver pathology, the latter of which appears to be mediated by induction of gamma interferon. The blood vessel-dwelling trematode Schistosoma man-soni causes a debilitating parasitic disease affecting more than 300 million people in developing countries. Publi...|$|R
40|$|For {{two years}} {{a colony of}} albino rats was fed diets one-third of which {{consisted}} of potatoes which received, for sprout-inhibition purposes, a dose of up to 40 <b>kilorads</b> of irradiation from reactor fuel elements. There were no effects of the irradiation treatment on growth, reproductive performances through four generations, hematology, nor on pathologic changes of these rats. The higher mortality of first-generation males and second-generation females fed the diets containing irradiated potatoes is not believed to be attributable to the irradiation treatment per se. Irradiation was not {{a factor in the}} unusually high incidence of a necrotizing arteritis resembling "peri-arteritis nodosa" in the first- and second-generation animals...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{characterize}} {{by different}} spectroscopic techniques the radiation effects on ytterbium-(Yb) and ytterbium/erbium (Yb/Er) -doped optical fibers. Their vulnerability {{to the environment}} of outer space is evaluated through passive radiation-induced attenuation (RIA) measurements during and after exposure to 10 keV X-rays, 1 MeV gamma-rays, and 105 MeV protons. These fibers present higher levels of RIA (1000 x) than telecommunication-type fibers. Measured RIA is comparable for gamma-rays and protons {{and is on the}} order of 1 dB/m at 1. 55 mu m after a few tenths of a <b>kilorad.</b> Their host matrix codoped with aluminum (Al) and/or phosphorus (P) is mainly responsible for their enhanced radiation sensitivity. Thanks to the major improvements of the Er-doped glass spectroscopic properties in case of Yb-codoping, Yb/Er-doped fibers appear as very promising candidates for outer space applications. In the infrared part of the spectrum, losses in P-codoped Yb-doped fibers are due to the P- 1 center that absorbs around 1. 6 mu m and are very detrimental for the operation of Er-codoped devices in a harsh environment. The negative impact of this defect seems reduced in the case of Al and P-codoping...|$|E
40|$|Solar flares are {{enormous}} explosions {{on the surface}} of the sun and they release energy of the order of billion megatons of TNThis energy is in the form of electromagnetic radiations such as alpha, gamma, and ultraviolet rays. When exposed to high doses of radiation like 2 - 15 <b>kilorad</b> (Si), silicon integrated circuits in satellite communication systems fail to operate properly, thus affecting the performance of communication systems. Therefore, the major issue that needs to be addressed is the protection of integrated circuits and their survivability when they are exposed to various space environmental hazards including high doses of electrons, protons, solar flares and other cosmic radiations. In this paper, we present a survey of novel approaches whose effectiveness in protecting communication systems in space against solar flares has been demonstrated. In particular, we explore high Z materials used to form a radiation shielding that acts as a grit-blasted screen and low Z carbon nanotechnology used to protect against protons. We also make observations regarding a 3 D layered coating for improved shielding, the use of commercially available substances, and additional ionizing radiation resistance to virtually sensitive electronic devices...|$|E
40|$|The total dose {{radiation}} {{response of}} {{two classes of}} floating gate nonvolatile memory devices is examined. While the hardness of commonly studied double polysilicon cells is restricted to a few <b>kilorads,</b> devices having only one polysilicon layer are shown {{to be much more}} radiation-hard. This is mainly due to the thinner oxide {{that can be used in}} the coupling capacitor of such cells. It is also shown that the contribution of the field oxide regions, present under the floating gate of the cells, is of major importance for their radiation response. Finally, the programming behaviour of the devices is shown to remain fairly unaffected by the ionizing radiation. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Ocular {{exposure}} of mice to live elementary bodies of Chlamydia trachomatis serovar A results in immunological sensitization of the mice. This reactivity is manifested {{by the development}} of early (5 h) and delayed-type (24 h) dermal reactivity and serovar-specific antibody formation against either live or irradiated (100 <b>kilorads)</b> elementary bodies. Parallel ocular {{exposure of}} mice to irradiated elementary bodies does not result in this sensitization. The early and late dermal immune responses induced by ocular exposure to live organisms can be transferred to unexposed mice by serum and lymphoid cell transfers, respectively. It appears that successful murine ocular sensitization by human C. trachomatis serovar A elementary bodies is an ability manifested by live organisms and not by inactivated but antigenic organisms...|$|R
40|$|A {{possible}} multiplexer {{design for}} the focal plane for the Cassini Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) is reviewed. The instrument's requirements for the multiplexed array are summarized. The VIMS instrument has a modest radiation-hardness requirement due to the trajectory and planetary environments in which the instrument {{will be required to}} operate. The total ionizing dose hardness requirement is a few tens of <b>kilorads.</b> A thin-gate oxide of a few hundred angstroms thickness is to be used. Field hardness is to be achieved by guard bands or hardened dielectric isolation. The design is argued to meet the low-noise and radiation-hardness required for imaging at Saturn. The design is versatile enough to provide double-correlated and double-uncorrelated sampling, which is accomplished in the signal processing electronics outside the focal plane...|$|R
40|$|Sporulated oocysts of the {{protozoan}} parasite Eimeria tenella were attenuated {{by exposure}} to various doses of X-radiation to inhibit intracellular replication and thus determine whether sporozoites alone can induce a protective immune response. Exposure to doses greater than 15 -kilorads {{had a significant effect}} on development, as indicated by the absence of oocyst production in chickens infected with parasites treated with 20 or 30 <b>kilorads</b> of radiation. Infection with nonirradiated or 15 -kilorad-exposed parasites led to either normal or reduced oocyst shedding. Equivalent protection was afforded chickens inoculated with a minimum immunizing dose of either nonirradiated or 20 -kilorad-irradiated E. tenella oocysts. Immunofluorescence staining of cecal tissue from chickens inoculated with 10 (7) nonirradiated or 20 - or 30 -kilorad-irradiated oocysts with stage-specific monoclonal antibodies showed no significant difference in sporozoite invasion between treatment groups. Normal merogonic development was observed at appropriate times (48, 60, 72, and 96 h) postinfection in chickens inoculated with nonirradiated oocysts. In contrast, irradiated parasites exhibited minimal merogonic development at 48 h postinfection. Furthermore, no merogonic stages were observed at times of otherwise peak merozoite development (60, 72, and 96 h) in cecal tissue from chickens inoculated with irradiated parasites. Infection of chicken cells with irradiated or nonirradiated parasites in vitro corroborated these findings and indicate that events early after sporozoite invasion induce a protective immune response against this parasite...|$|R
40|$|Brucella abortus strain RB 51 is an {{attenuated}} rough mutant used as {{the live}} vaccine against bovine brucellosis in the United States and other countries. We previously reported the development of strain RB 51 as a bacterial vaccine vector for inducing Th 1 -type immune responses against heterologous proteins. Because safety concerns may preclude the use of strain RB 51 -based recombinant live vaccines, we explored {{the ability of a}} gamma-irradiated recombinant RB 51 strain to induce heterologous antigen-specific immune responses in BALB/c mice. Exposure of strain RB 51 G/LacZ expressing Escherichia coli β-galactosidase to a minimum of 300 <b>kilorads</b> of gamma radiation resulted in complete loss of replicative ability. These bacteria, however, remained metabolically active and continued to synthesize β-galactosidase. A single intraperitoneal inoculation of mice with 109 CFU equivalents of gamma-irradiated, but not heat-killed, RB 51 G/LacZ induced a β-galactosidase-specific Th 1 -type immune response. Though no obvious differences were detected in immune responses to B. abortus-specific antigens, mice vaccinated with gamma-irradiated, but not heat-killed, RB 51 G/LacZ developed significant protection against challenge with virulent B. abortus. In vitro experiments indicated that gamma-irradiated and heat-killed RB 51 G/LacZ induced maturation of dendritic cells; however, stimulation with gamma-irradiated bacteria resulted in more interleukin- 12 secretion. These results suggest that recombinant RB 51 strains exposed to an appropriate minimum dose of gamma radiation are unable to replicate but retain their ability to stimulate Th 1 immune responses against the heterologous antigens and confer protection against B. abortus challenge in mice...|$|R
40|$|In murine schistosomiasis, {{the highest}} levels of {{resistance}} to cercarial challenge are obtained by vaccination with radiation-attenuated cercariae. To identify candidate vaccine antigens relevant to the vaccine model, we examined parasite antigens recognized by antibodies from mice vaccinated with irradiated cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni. To optimize recognition of a wide spectrum of antigens, several factors that influence the level of protection in this model were varied; specifically, we examined the effect of (i) single versus multiple vaccinations with irradiated cercariae, (ii) the dose of irradiation (15 or 50 <b>kilorads)</b> administered to the cercariae, and (iii) the genetic background of mouse strains, high-responder (C 57 BL/ 6 J) versus moderate-responder (CBA/J) mice. We found that the number of vaccinations did not alter antibody specificity but modified the relative antibody titers against particular antigens. The dose of irradiation used to attenuate the immunizing cercariae had a similar effect on antibody titers but in addition influenced antibody specificity. Only mice that had been vaccinated with moderately irradiated cercariae recognized cathepsin B (Sm 31) and Sm 32. Interestingly, when vaccinated mice of the two strains, C 57 BL/ 6 J and CBA/J, were compared, differences in antibody responses to particular antigens were observed. Both strains recognized the integral membrane protein Sm 23, glutathione S-transferase, and cathepsin B, whereas Sm 32 and paramyosin were recognized only by CBA/J mice, and heat shock protein 70 was recognized exclusively by C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. In this study, we conclusively identified six distinct antigens that are specifically recognized by the humoral immune response of vaccinated mice...|$|R
40|$|The {{bacterium}} Deinococcus radiodurans shows remarkable {{resistance to}} a range of damage caused by ionizing radiation, desiccation, UV radiation, oxidizing agents, and electrophilic mutagens. D. radiodurans is best known for its extreme resistance to ionizing radiation; not only can it grow continuously in the presence of chronic radiation (6 kilorads/h), but also it can survive acute exposures to gamma radiation exceeding 1, 500 <b>kilorads</b> without dying or undergoing induced mutation. These characteristics were the impetus for sequencing the genome of D. radiodurans and the ongoing development of its use for bioremediation of radioactive wastes. Although it is known that these multiple resistance phenotypes stem from efficient DNA repair processes, the mechanisms underlying these extraordinary repair capabilities remain poorly understood. In this work we present an extensive comparative sequence analysis of the Deinococcus genome. Deinococcus is the first representative with a completely sequenced genome from a distinct bacterial lineage of extremophiles, the Thermus-Deinococcus group. Phylogenetic tree analysis, combined with the identification of several synapomorphies between Thermus and Deinococcus, supports the hypothesis that it is an ancient group with no clear affinities to any of the other known bacterial lineages. Distinctive features of the Deinococcus genome as well as features shared with other free-living bacteria were revealed by comparison of its proteome to the collection of clusters of orthologous groups of proteins. Analysis of paralogs in Deinococcus has revealed several unique protein families. In addition, specific expansions of several other families including phosphatases, proteases, acyltransferases, and Nudix family pyrophosphohydrolases were detected. Genes that potentially affect DNA repair and recombination and stress responses were investigated in detail. Some proteins appear to have been horizontally transferred from eukaryotes and are not present in other bacteria. For example, three proteins homologous to plant desiccation resistance proteins were identified, and these are particularly interesting because of the correlation between desiccation and radiation resistance. Compared to other bacteria, the D. radiodurans genome is enriched in repetitive sequences, namely, IS-like transposons and small intergenic repeats. In combination, these observations suggest that several different biological mechanisms contribute to the multiple DNA repair-dependent phenotypes of this organism...|$|R
40|$|In today 2 ̆ 7 s rapidly {{advancing}} technology roadmap {{for space}} applications {{there is an}} emphasis on completing missions faster and cheaper than previous large-scale missions at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) such as the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) or the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission. As part of this effort, focus has shifted from using mostly radiation-tolerant or radiation-hardened parts to more commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components for missions that can last {{at least one year}} in orbit. However, there are some portions of a spacecraft 2 ̆ 7 s avionics, such as the command and data handling (C 2 ̆ 6 DH) system and the Electrical Power Systems (EPS) that need to have some level of predictable reliability that goes beyond the capabilities of currently available COTS parts. While {{there are a number of}} COTS components that can withstand a total ionizing dose (TID) of tens or hundreds of <b>kilorads,</b> there is still a great deal of concern about tolerance to and mitigation of single-event effects (SEE). The Goddard Modular Smallsat Architecture (GMSA) is based on an initiative at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) to address this reliability issue along with minimizing cost and schedule challenges. The goal is to develop a modular, flexible, and extensible small satellite implementation approach that can accommodate spacecraft subsystems that are designed both internally within NASA and externally. There will also be an emphasis placed on maximizing the volume available for science payloads. This paper provides details a new technology development effort that will add a miniaturized board-level capability that will fulfill the requirements of both the C 2 ̆ 6 DH and EPS within a 6 U (10 cm x 20 cm x 30 cm) satellite. This effort will dramatically transform spaceflight systems capabilities at GSFC with the goal of accomplishing a variety of ambitious science goals that are increasingly challenged by constraints on cost, mass, power, volume, and schedule. The selected topology for the EPS is a Direct Energy Transfer (DET) system with the battery connected directly to the bus. The shunt control technique is a linear sequential full shunt which provides a simple solar array interface and can support both 3 -axis stabilized and spinner satellites. The EPS includes all the circuits needed to perform telemetry and command function using I 2 C interface with the C 2 ̆ 6 DH. In addition, the EPS will be designed, tested, and verified to meet launcher vehicle safety requirement. The C 2 ̆ 6 DH functionality will be implemented using the Smallsat Common Electronics Board (SCEB) and its adapter board. The SCEB can be configured to implement a variety of serial communication interfaces including RS- 422, I 2 C, SPI, and SpaceWire. There will also be a number of available general purpose input/output (GPIO) signals. The SCEB will house a reprogrammable FPGA that supports a soft-core processor and flight software (FSW) which will be reused from NASA GSFC’s Core Flight System (cFS) project. Lastly, the SCEB will interface with an adapter board that will contain the analog circuitry that converts temperature, voltage, and current data collected from multiple points within 6 U satellite to a digital format that can be processed, stored, and downlinked using the front end Comm interface...|$|R
