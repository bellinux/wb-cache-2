25|$|While Anglicans {{consolidated}} their hold on {{the upper}} classes, workingmen and farmers responded to the Methodist revivals, often sponsored by visiting preachers from the United States. Typical was Rev. James Caughey, an American sent by the Wesleyan Methodist Church from the 1840s through 1864. He brought in the converts by the score, most notably in the revivals in Canada West 1851–53. His technique combined restrained emotionalism with a call for personal commitment, coupled with follow-up action to organize support from converts. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> the Holiness Movement caught fire, with the revitalized interest {{of men and women}} in Christian perfection. Caughey bridged the gap between the style of earlier camp meetings and the needs of more sophisticated Methodist congregations in the emerging cities.|$|E

To counter this phenomenon, Sunder Singh Lyallpuri started educating the Sikh masses about Sikhism and its history. In association with S. Harchand Singh Ryees and some other well-wishers, Lyallpuri founded the Khalsa Bhujangi Sabha (Khalsa Youngman Association), the members of which {{played a leading role}} in the Sikh affairs and for the country as a whole. It was this association which had started the Gurdwara Rikabganj Morcha which was later supported by broad Sikh community and won the victory for the Akalis.|$|E
25|$|In 1865, Ward {{relocated}} to Chicago, {{where he worked}} for Case and Sobin, a lamp house. He traveled for them as salesman, and sold goods on commission for a short time. Chicago {{was the center of}} the wholesale dry-goods trade, and in the 1860s Ward joined the leading dry-goods house, Field Palmer & Leiter, forerunner of Marshall Field & Co. He worked for Field for two years and then joined the wholesale dry-goods business of Wills, Greg & Co. In tedious rounds of train trips to southern communities, hiring rigs at the local stables, driving out to the crossroads stores and listening to the complaints of the back-country proprietors and their rural customers, he conceived a new merchandising technique: direct mail sales to country people. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> rural consumers longed for the comforts of the city, yet all too often were victimized by monopolists and overcharged by the costs of many middlemen required to bring manufactured products to the countryside. The quality of merchandise also was suspect and the hapless farmer had no recourse in a caveat emptor economy. Ward shaped a plan to buy goods at low cost for cash. By eliminating intermediaries, with their markups and commissions, and drastically cutting selling costs, he could sell goods to people, however remote, at appealing prices. He invited them to send their orders by mail and he delivered the purchases to their nearest railroad station. The only thing he lacked was capital.|$|E

He moved to Cleveland in 1913, {{when he was in his}} mid-twenties, to be circulation manager for the Cleveland News. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> circulation battles over newsstands and street corners often turned violent. He started with the News on a $10,000 salary ($ in today's dollars) and was charged with organizing the paper's newsboys. [...] "This meant choosing strong young men comfortable fighting with fists, clubs, knives, chains and, when they could get them, handguns," [...] author Ted Schwarz wrote. [...] "They were the business equivalent of the street gang, and McBride's salary depended on how well he organized his newsboys to avoid losing their corners to one or more violent rivals." ...|$|E
500|$|Letitia Woods Brown {{attended}} Tuskegee Institute, as {{her father}} had. She graduated with a bachelor of science degree in 1935, {{during the middle of}} the Great Depression. While she continued her education, she briefly served as a teacher in the Macon County, Alabama segregated school system, where she taught 3rd and 4th grade in 1935 and 1936. She once stated, [...] "The rural black school in the segregated post-depression era was deprived by any standard. There were never enough books and the teacher had to provide her own chalk, paper, pencils...". She subsequently obtained a master's of arts degree in history from Ohio State University in 1937. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> women of African American ancestry were unlikely to continue higher education and pursue degrees. After graduating from Ohio State, Brown and a group of Ohio State University students traveled to Haiti to pursue academic knowledge about Caribbean history and literature. She later wrote, [...] "That trip was my first sally forth to see the world".|$|E
500|$|Although Let It Be was the Beatles' final album release, it {{was largely}} {{recorded}} before Abbey Road. The project's impetus came from an idea Martin attributes to McCartney, who suggested they [...] "record an album of new material and rehearse it, then perform it before a live audience {{for the very first}} time – on record and on film". Originally intended for a one-hour television programme to be called Beatles at Work, much of the album's content came from extensive rehearsals filmed by director Michael Lindsay-Hogg at Twickenham Film Studios, beginning in January 1969. Martin has said that the project was [...] "not at all a happy recording experience. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> relations between the Beatles were at their lowest ebb." [...] Lennon described the largely impromptu sessions as [...] "hell... the most miserable... on Earth", and Harrison, [...] "the low of all-time". Irritated by both McCartney and Lennon, Harrison walked out for five days. Upon returning, he threatened to leave the band unless they [...] "abandon all talk of live performance" [...] and instead focused on finishing a new album, initially titled Get Back, using songs recorded for the TV special. He also demanded they cease work at Twickenham and relocate to the newly finished Apple Studio. The other band members agreed, and the idea came about to salvage the footage shot for the TV production for use in a feature film.|$|E

2500|$|Apollonius {{was among}} the {{foremost}} Homeric scholars in the Alexandrian period. He wrote the period's first scholarly monograph on Homer, critical of the editions of the Iliad and Odyssey published by Zenodotus, his predecessor {{as head of the}} Library of Alexandria.

It has even been called [...] "a kind of poetic dictionary of Homer", without at all detracting from its merits as poetry.

2500|$|On August 29, 2006 Sec. Donald Rumsfeld said “Over {{the next}} decades , a {{sentiment}} took root that contended that {{if only the}} growing threats that had begun to emerge in Europe and Asia could be accommodated, then the carnage {{and the destruction of}} then-recent memory of World War I could be avoided. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> a certain amount of cynicism and moral confusion set in among Western democracies. When those who warned about a coming crisis, the rise of fascism and nazism, they were ridiculed or ignored. Indeed, in the decades before World War II, a great many argued that the fascist threat was exaggerated or that it was someone else's problem. Some nations tried to negotiate a separate peace, even as the enemy made its deadly ambitions crystal clear. It was, as Winston Churchill observed, a bit like feeding a crocodile, hoping it would eat you last. ...I recount that history because once again we face similar challenges in efforts to confront the rising threat of a new type of fascism. Today -- another enemy, a different kind of enemy -- has made clear its intentions with attacks in places like New York and Washington, D.C., Bali, London, Madrid, Moscow and so many other places. But some seem not to have learned history's lessons. ...With the growing lethality and the increasing availability of weapons, can we truly afford to believe that somehow, some way, vicious extremists can be appeased?
