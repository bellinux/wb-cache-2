30|$|We {{calculated}} Manly’s habitat selection {{ratio for}} <b>great</b> <b>egrets</b> and white ibis (Eudocimus albus L.) in each year following Manly et al. (2002). We used <b>great</b> <b>egrets</b> and white ibises because foraging individuals {{of these two}} species are readily detected, identified, and counted from the air. A selection ratio of 1 indicates habitat use is {{in direct proportion to}} habitat availability. Selection ratios < 1 indicate avoidance, while selection ratios > 1 indicate selection for the habitat. We compared selection ratios in each habitat type to calculated expected use via a chi-squared analysis and calculated 95 % confidence limits using the Bonferroni correction (Manly et al. 2002).|$|R
25|$|The {{unofficial}} {{symbol of}} Haliburton and Muskoka is the loon, also honoured as Ontario's provincial bird. In addition to loons, other water birds {{on the lake}} include the great blue heron, the <b>great</b> <b>egret,</b> the sandhill crane, and the hooded merganser. Other water birds include {{a wide variety of}} ducks, grebes, bitterns, herons, terns, and mergansers as well as the Canada goose, the double-crested cormorant, the ring-billed and herring gull, the common sandpiper, the killdeer, the common snipe, the Virginia rail, the sora, the American coot, and the common moorhen.|$|E
25|$|The native fauna {{consists}} of marsupials and monotremes, reptiles, amphibians, bats and birds. The greater glider (Petauroides volans) {{is the largest}} possum found in this forest. It has furry hair with the colour varying from grey to cream and with a pale underside. It has a large snout and large ears. Its range is {{in the western part}} of the Wombat State Forest. Several state-listed threatened bird species occur in the forest including the <b>great</b> <b>egret,</b> intermediate egret, grey goshawk, Australian masked owl, powerful owl and square-tailed kite. Additionally, the forest is the western extent of the range of the red-browed treecreeper and olive whistler.|$|E
25|$|Another {{migratory bird}} {{seen in the}} winter is the <b>great</b> <b>egret,</b> which grows to up to a meter in height. Some rare birds that have been seen here include the common kestrel, the osprey and certain types of owl. The most {{commonly}} observed migratory species is the American white pelican, which was not seen in the area before the lake and canals were restored. However, this species has only been seen in numbers since the 2000s, with 500 reported as of 2009. These birds migrate here from Canada and the northern US. Another important species is the kingfisher, which was earlier thought to be extinct in the area, but has been seen again.|$|E
50|$|Bird lovers have {{constructed}} {{a series of}} artificial nesting structures on a network of small islets within one of the lakes. The lake complex draws great blue herons, <b>great</b> <b>egrets,</b> black-crowned night herons, double-crested cormorants, and cattle egrets.|$|R

50|$|Audubon Canyon is {{a coastal}} valley in Marin County, California, United States, which is {{associated}} with a small stream. The canyon provides habitat for a variety of animals and plants. Notably, its redwoods provide nesting sites for great blue herons, <b>great</b> <b>egrets,</b> and snowy egrets.|$|R
25|$|At {{the time}} of Sanford Hall's construction, plume-hunting for the {{millinery}} trade had brought many coastal bird species {{to the brink of}} extinction, most notably the <b>great</b> <b>egret.</b> Frank Chapman was a key figure in the conservation movement that emerged during this time. His dioramas were created with the intention of furthering this conservationist cause, giving museum visitors a brief glimpse at the dwindling bird species being lost in the name of fashion. Thanks in part to Chapman's efforts, both inside and outside of the museum, conservation of these bird species would be very successful, establishing refuges, such as Pelican Island National Wildlife Refuge, and eventually leading to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} of feathers in central Mexico were the long green feathers of the resplendent quetzal which were reserved for deities and the emperor. One reason for their rarity was that quetzals could not be domesticated as they died in captivity. Instead wild birds were caught, plucked and released. Other tropical birds were used as well. Bernardino de Sahagún {{made a list of}} the species used for fine feathers, many of which are now either threatened or locally extinct. These include the mountain trogon, lovely cotinga, roseate spoonbill, squirrel cuckoo, red-legged honeycreeper, emerald toucanet, agami heron, russet-crowned motmot, turquoise-browed motmot, blue grosbeak, golden eagle, <b>great</b> <b>egret,</b> military macaw, scarlet macaw, yellow-headed amazon, Montezuma oropendola and the over 53 species of hummingbird found in Mexico.|$|E
25|$|As {{trees are}} drowned by rising beaver impoundments, they become ideal nesting sites for woodpeckers, which carve {{cavities}} that attract many other bird species, including flycatchers (Empidonax spp.), tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor), tits (Paridae spp.), wood ducks (Aix sponsa), goldeneyes (Bucephala spp.), mergansers (Mergus spp.), owls (Tytonidae, Strigidae) and American kestrels (Falco sparverius). Piscivores, including herons (Ardea spp.), grebes (Podicipedidae), cormorants (Phalacrocorax ssp.), American bitterns (Botaurus lentiginosa), <b>great</b> <b>egret</b> (Ardea alba), snowy egret (Egretta thula), mergansers, and belted kingfishers (Megaceryle alcyon), use beaver ponds for fishing. Hooded mergansers (Lophodytes cucullatus), green heron (Butorides virescens), {{great blue heron}} (Ardea herodias) and belted kingfisher appeared more frequently in New York wetlands where beaver were active than at sites with no beaver activity.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the migratory}} species include the Mongolian plover, eastern curlew, grey-tailed tattler and bar-tailed godwit. Other birds seen the reserve include pied oystercatchers, beach thick-knees, darters, little black cormorants, white-faced herons, Australian white ibis, <b>great</b> <b>egrets,</b> grass owls, {{whistling}} kites and brahminy kites.|$|R
30|$|Contrary to our {{prediction}} (H 4 a), {{capture rate}} of <b>great</b> <b>egrets</b> was much higher in Sloughs Adjacent to Burns than in burned areas. Capture rates {{in this study}} fell in the ranges observed {{in other areas of}} the Everglades (Surdick 1998, Lantz et al. 2010, 2011, Sizemore and Main 2012), although capture rates in 2010 were at the low end of those reported. Given that capture rates were higher in Sloughs Adjacent to Burns, it seems contrary to expectations that <b>great</b> <b>egrets</b> preferentially foraged in burned areas. However, sloughs are deeper water habitats than burned sawgrass, and at the time that burns were available, many Sloughs Adjacent to Burns may have been too deep for foraging (Powell 1987, Gawlik 2002).|$|R
50|$|Many other {{shore and}} water birds {{can be found}} in the {{sanctuary}} such as roseate spoonbills, <b>great</b> <b>egrets,</b> laughing gulls and many others.

2500|$|The Goose Lake Valley is on {{the western}} flyway from Mexico to bird {{breeding}} grounds in the Arctic. [...] During the spring, Canada geese, snow geese, Ross' geese, and whistling swans stops in the valley to feed and rest before continuing north. Numerous shorebirds also migrate though the valley. These include black-necked stilts, American avocets, spotted sandpipers, Wilson's phalaropes, red-necked phalaropes, black terns, eared grebes, horned grebes, and cinnamon teal. [...] In the fall, these birds pass through the valley on their way south. [...] In addition, a number of bird species nest in the areas around Goose Lake. [...] Shorebirds such as American avocets, willets, killdeer, western grebe, and long-billed curlew nest near the lake. [...] The wetlands north of the lake provide breeding areas for Canada geese and sandhill cranes as well as mallard and other duck species.
