The economic and social status of divorced-mother families in Kazakhstan is an unexplored area of research.

Higher male earnings and employment opportunities in a woman's marriage market appear to lead to fewer never married <b>mothers,</b> but more <b>divorced</b> <b>mothers.</b> Higher child support or alimony payments are associated with a higher prevalence of <b>divorced</b> <b>mothers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Using a {{large-scale}} sample of online daters in eight European countries (N = 196, 777), we examine willingness to stepparent among divorcees {{in relation to}} both gender and number of children, {{as well as a}} set of contextual determinants. We find evidence that having one’s own resident children increases the readiness to partner someone with children. Contrary to previous findings, women are generally less willing to stepparent than men, but when resident children are present, gender dissimilarities fade. Notable national differences are also found. <b>Divorced</b> <b>mothers</b> living in Sweden, the Netherlands, Austria, or France are more open to having a partner with children, whereas Polish and Spanish <b>divorced</b> <b>mothers</b> would be less willing to stepparent.

40|$|Due to the {{preponderance}} of single mothers on public assistance, delinquent child support has been a contentious political issue in the U. S. for over 30 years. We examine whether joint-child-custody reform affects the child- support receipt of single mothers. We use variation in the timing of joint-custody reforms across states to identify the effect of joint custody on the child-support receipt of single mothers. Joint-custody enactment raises the probability of receiving child support for all single mothers by six percent. However, the effect on all single mothers {{is driven by the}} effect on <b>divorced</b> <b>mothers</b> since separated and never-married mothers are unaffected by joint-custody reform. We conclude joint-custody reform confers the most benefit on <b>divorced</b> <b>mothers</b> and their children, particularly those who do not receive public assistance. ...|$|R

40|$|Although {{research}} has studied women 2 ̆ 7 s post-divorce financial recovery, this topic needs revisiting {{as most of}} these studies are over a decade old and {{do not reflect the}} current life situations of divorced women today. This study draws upon a recent cohort of divorced women with children from the 2010 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 and investigates how divorced women 2 ̆ 7 s various social resources are associated with their economic well-being. Specifically, I examine three categories of resources: individual resources (e. g., education, employment, and socio-emotional well-being), interpersonal resources (e. g., religious attendance, nonresident father involvement), and structural resources (community size, child support, and welfare receipt). This study looks at more variables associated with mothers 2 ̆ 7 personal, interpersonal and structural resources available to her post-divorce, specifically, region of residence and nonresidential father visitation. Overall, the major findings within this study show that education, more precisely, a four year degree has the largest effect on income for single <b>divorce</b> <b>mothers.</b> More specific to single <b>divorced</b> <b>mothers,</b> was the negative effect of dependence on welfare and no visitation from fathers on mothers income. Limitations of this study are first, the sample is limited single, divorced women with children; <b>divorced</b> <b>mothers</b> have the highest incidence of poverty and that many of the variables are generalizable to women or men, barring father visitation...|$|R

50|$|The {{differential}} {{distribution of}} household work has significant implications. For example, most married mothers become economically {{dependent on their}} husbands, but {{the law does not}} grant them financial equality in marriage. This means that, in the case of <b>divorce,</b> <b>mothers</b> experience a dramatic drop in income. Moreover, the social safety net does not protect <b>divorced</b> or single <b>mothers</b> from poverty, and mothers are not eligible for unemployment insurance if they work part-time or at home.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze the {{relationship}} between the income sources of custodial divorced parents and their expenditure patterns. We use data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey to directly investigate the {{issue of whether or not}} <b>divorced</b> <b>mothers</b> receiving child support income spend larger amounts on "child goods" than those not receiving child support holding total household income constant. By comparing the estimated coefficients on child support income and other income in an "endogenous" Engel curve specification we argue that we can classify child goods as being public or private and say something about the expenditure patterns of noncustodial fathers under a Nash equilibrium model of parental expenditures on public child goods and some plausible assumptions regarding the manner in which child support transfer decisions are made by noncustodial fathers. Our empirical results indicate that income composition does affect the expenditure patterns of <b>divorced</b> <b>mothers</b> and that consumption externalities exist even among divorced parents. ...|$|R

40|$|The stress {{parents feel}} affects how they fulfill {{their roles as}} parents and their own {{psychological}} well-being. Social support {{has been shown to}} help parents deal with the demands of their parenting roles while maintaining psychological health. Compared to married parents, <b>divorced</b> <b>mothers</b> are most at risk for parenting stress and negative feelings of well-being. Low-income can add further to the levels of stress in parenting and increase the need for sources of social support. This study compared low-income <b>divorced</b> <b>mothers</b> to low-income married mothers. It explored mothers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of the stresses of parenting and feelings of wellbeing in relation to their use of social support resources. Results indicated that <b>divorced</b> <b>mothers</b> who used informal sources of social support (i. e., relatives or fiiends) were more likely to feel in control of their lives and have a more positive perception of their preschool child. On the other hand, married mothers who used formal sources of social support (i. e., agencies or professionals) felt more positive about interactions with their children and felt less distress in their parenting roles. This study also looked at social support as a moderating variable interacting with marital status to affect feelings of well-being and parenting stress. Social support as a moderating variable was not supported for this sample. It was concluded that researchers must be careful in selecting an instrument used to measure the concept of social support.
