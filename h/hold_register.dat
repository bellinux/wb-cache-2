40|$|Abstract: The {{universal}} {{serial bus}} (USB) is a Full duplex serial bus interface. USB devices receive the data from Transmitter Macro cell interface: a transmitter and a receiver section both of which uses 2 lines D+ and D- for transmission and reception. There are three functional blocks present in USB controller: Serial Interface Engine (SIE), UTMI and Device Specific Logic (DSL). The transmit <b>hold</b> <b>register</b> holds the data received from SIE and is converted to serial data and is send to transmit shift register. This serial data is added to some extra bits known as bit stuffing in order for clock synchronization and Manchester encoding. Then the encoded data is sent on to the serial bus. When the data is received on the serial bus, it is decoded, bit unstuffed and is sent to receive shift register. After the shift register is full, the Data is sent to receive <b>hold</b> <b>register.</b> The same can be designed using VHDL code and synthesize...|$|E
40|$|The {{universal}} {{serial bus}} (USB) transceiver macro cell interface (UTMI) is a two wire, bi-directional serial bus interface. UTMI consists of transmitting and receiving sections, in which the transmitter of the UTMI sends data to different USB devices through D+ and D- lines whereas the receiver gets data on the same lines. UTMI {{is one of the}} important functional blocks of USB controller, which can transmit and receive data to or from USB devices. There are three functional blocks present in USB controller; those are Serial Interface Engine (SIE), UTMI and Device Specific Logic (DSL). The parallel data from SIE is taken into the transmit <b>hold</b> <b>register</b> and this data is sent to transmit shift register from where the data is converted serially. This serial data is bit stuffed to perform data transitions for clock recovery and NRZI (1) encoding. Then the encoded data is sent on to the serial bus. When the data is received on the serial bus, it is decoded, bit unstuffed and is sent to receive shift register. After the shift register is full, the Data is sent to receive <b>hold</b> <b>register.</b> This presentation reveals the FPGA implementation of UTMI transmission rate providing with USB 2. 0 specifications. Further UTMI has been designed by using VHDL code and simulated, synthesized and programmed to the targeted Spartan family of FPGA in th...|$|E
40|$|The driving {{circuits}} of thin-film transistor-liquid crystal displays (TFT-LCDs) for LCD-TV and large-size LCD applications were studied. In {{the first}} part, a high slew rate and {{low offset voltage}} buffer for TFT-LCD source driver was proposed. For LCD-TV and multimedia applications, TFT-LCD panels become larger and usually have heavy loads in scan/data lines on the array. In order to enhance driving capability of the buffer, two comparators which sense the rising and falling edges of the input waveform were used {{to turn on the}} auxiliary driving transistors to enhance charging/discharging of the output load. When the buffer is at steady-state, it consumes no extra power. On the other hand, it needs a low offset voltage to reach the high color depth. The replica-gain circuit could reduce the offset voltage and minimize affection of the mismatch transistors. The offset voltage of the novel buffer amplifier I was reduced to 4. 99 mV. In the second part, based on the buffer amplifier I, the buffer amplifier II with the improved offset voltage and output swing were proposed. The active load was adds in the replica-gain stage which could effectively reduce the offset voltage. In this part, two type buffers were designed and simulated. Type A is with the pure offset cancellation in the circuit. Type B is with the offset cancellation and slew rate enhancement functions. The output swing of the buffer amplifier II is from 0. 0 to 4. 9 V. The offset voltage of the type A and type B can be reduced and controlled within 0. 07 mV and 0. 19 mV, respectively. Therefore, the proposed high slew rate and low offset voltage buffer has a potential to be applied to the source driver for LCD-TVs and large-size TFT-LCD monitors with high color depth and high resolution.

40|$|We {{present a}} method of test {{generation}} for acyclic sequential circuits with <b>hold</b> <b>registers.</b> A complete (100 % fault efficiency) test sequence for an acyclic sequential circuit {{can be obtained by}} applying a combinational test generator to all the maximal time-expansion models (TEMs) of the circuit. We propose a class of acyclic sequential circuits for which the number of maximal TEMs is one, i. e, the maximum TEM exists. For a circuit in the class, test generation can be performed by using only the maximum TEM. The proposed class of sequential circuits with the maximum TEM properly includes several known classes of acyclic sequential circuits such as balanced structures and acyclic sequential circuits without <b>hold</b> <b>registers</b> for which test generation can be also performed by using a combinational test generator. Therefore, in general, the hardware overhead for partial scan based on the proposed structure is smaller than that based on balanced or acyclic sequential structure without <b>hold</b> <b>registers.</b> [URL]...|$|R
