40|$|The {{scattering}} of a weakly bound (halo) projectile nucleus by a <b>heavy</b> <b>target</b> <b>nucleus</b> is investigated. A new approach, called the Uncorrelated Scattering Approximation, is proposed. The main approximation involved is to neglect {{the correlation between}} the fragments of the projectile in the region where the interaction with the target is important. The formalism makes use of hyper-spherical harmonics, Raynal-Revay coefficients and momentum-localized wave functions to expand projectile channel wave functions in terms of products of the channel wave function of the individual fragments. Within this approach, the kinetic energy and angular momentum of each fragment is conserved during the scattering process. The elastic, inelastic and break-up S-matrices are obtained as an analytic combination involving the bound wave function of the projectile and the product of the S-matrices of the fragments. The approach is applied to describe the {{scattering of}} deuteron on $^{ 58 }$Ni at several energies.

Although {{a majority of the}} neutrons will have energies below 20 MeV, a small fraction at higher energies has still to be characterised. Above 200 MeV, direct reaction models work reasonably well, while at lower energies nuclear distortion plays a non-trivial role.

40|$|Investigation of {{the breakup}} and {{transfer}} effect of weakly bound nuclei on the fusion {{process has been}} an interesting research topic {{in the past several}} years. However, owing to the low intensities of the presently available radioactive ion beam (RIB), it is difficult to clearly explore the reaction mechanisms of nuclear systems with unstable nuclei. In comparison with RIB, the beam intensities of stable weakly bound nuclei such as 6, 7 Li and 9 Be, which have significant breakup probability, are orders of magnitude higher. Precise fusion measurements have already been performed with those stable weakly bound nuclei, and the effect of breakup of those nuclei on the fusion process has been extensively studied. Those nuclei indicated large production cross sections for particles other than the α + x breakup. The particles are originated from non-capture breakup (NCBU), incomplete fusion (ICF) and transfer processes. However, the conclusion of reaction dynamics was not clear and has the contradiction. In our previous experiments we have performed 6 Li+ 96 Zr and 154 Sm at HI- 13 Tandem accelerator of China Institute of Atomic Energy (CIAE) by using HPGe array.

It has been shown that this simple {{reduction scheme}} works also well for α-particle induced reactions on <b>heavy</b> <b>target</b> <b>nuclei,</b> but very recently significant deviations have been seen for α+^ 33 S and α+^ 23 Na. Motivated by these unexpected discrepancies, the present study analyses α-induced reaction cross sections for targets with masses A ≈ 20 - 50. The study shows that the experimental data for α-induced reactions on nuclei with A ≈ 20 - 50 deviate slightly from the global behavior of reduced cross sections. However, in general the deviations evolve smoothly towards lower masses. The only significant outliers are the recent data for ^ 33 S and ^ 23 Na which are far above the general systematics, and some very old data may indicate that ^ 36 Ar and ^ 40 Ar are below the general trend. As expected, also the doubly-magic ^ 40 Ca nucleus lies slightly below the results for its neighboring nuclei. Overall, the experimental data are nicely reproduced by a statistical model calculation utilizing the simple α-nucleus potential by McFadden and Satchler.

40|$|Proton {{radiography}} {{has become}} an important tool for predicting the performance of stockpiled nuclear weapons. Current proton radiography experiments at LANSCE are confined to relatively small targets {{on the order of}} centimeters in size because of the low beam energy. LANL scientists have made radiographs with 12 and 24 GeV protons produced by the accelerator at Brookhaven National Laboratory. These energies are in the range required for hydrotest radiography. The design of a facility for hydrotest radiography requires knowledge of the cross sections for producing high-energy particles in the forward direction, which are incorporated into the Monte Carlo simulation used in designing the beam and detectors. There are few existing measurements of neutron production cross sections for proton-nuclei interactions in the 50 GeV range, and almost no data exist for forward neutron production, especially for <b>heavy</b> <b>target</b> <b>nuclei.</b> Thus the data from the MIPP EMCAL and HCAL, for which our group was responsible, are critical to proton radiography. Since neutrons and photons cannot be focused by magnets, they cause a background “fog” on the images. This problem can be minimized by careful design of the focusing system and detectors. The purpose of our research was to measure forward production of neutrons produced by high-energy proton beams striking a variety of targets. The forward-going particles carry most of the energy from a high-energy proton interaction, so these are the most important to proton radiography. This work was carried out in conjunction with the Fermilab E- 907 (MIPP) collaboration. Our group was responsible for designing and building the E 907 forward neutron and photon calorimeters. With the support of our Stewardship Science Academic Alliances grants, we were able to design, build, and commission the calorimeters on budget and ahead of schedule.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} impact of nuclear effects on the higher twist terms using a {{particular}} example of the structure function xF 3 as extracted from a QCD fit to neutrino deep inelastic data on a <b>heavy</b> <b>nucleus</b> <b>target.</b> The operator product expansion is a common theoretical framework in analyses of deep inelastic scattering (DIS) in QCD. The operators can be ordered according to their twist yielding the series in Q − 2 for physical observables. For example, for the structure function F 3, this reads xF 3 (x, Q 2) = xF LT 3 (x, Q 2) + H 3 (x, Q 2) Q 2 + [...] . (1) The first term in this expansion (the leading twist, LT) dominates at sufficiently large momentum transfer Q 2 and invariant mass W 2 = M 2 + Q 2 (1 − x) /x. The LT structure functions are constructed in terms of parton distribution functions (PDFs), which are universal for charged lepton and neutrino scattering and have clear probabilistic interpretation. An accurate knowledge of these {{plays a key role}} in the extraction of possibl...|$|R
40|$|We have {{measured}} the charge-changing cross sections of 10. 6 GeV/nucleon ^(197) Au <b>nuclei</b> interacting in <b>targets</b> of CH 2 (polyethylene), C, Al, Cu, Sn, and Pb. Cross sections for H are calculated from those measured in C and CH_ 2. The total charge-changing cross sections {{are higher than}} those measured at energies of ≤ 1 GeV/nucleon. The measured cross sections for the <b>heavier</b> <b>targets</b> are somewhat larger than those predicted by a model based on data taken at lower energies with lighter targets. Partial charge-changing cross sections {{for the production of}} fragments from the incident Au projectiles were measured for charge changes (ΔZ) from ΔZ=+ 1, _(80) Hg, down to approximately ΔZ=- 29, _(50) Sn. In comparison to lower energy measurements, these partial cross sections are found to be smaller for small ΔZ and larger or the same for large ΔZ. The H partial cross sections are found to follow a power law in ΔZ similar to that for <b>heavier</b> <b>targets,</b> instead of the exponential form observed at lower energies. Factorization is found to hold for all partial cross sections with ΔZ greater than two. In the <b>heavier</b> <b>targets,</b> the cross sections for one and two proton removal have significant contributions from electromagnetic dissociation. The electromagnetic dissociation contribution to the total cross section is derived and found to be relatively small, but with a strong dependence on the charge of the <b>target</b> <b>nuclei</b> of the form Z__T^(1. 75 ± 0. 01) ...|$|R
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the Lanzhou quantum molecular dynamics (LQMD) transport model, the nuclear fragmentation induced by low-energy antiprotons has been investigated thoroughly. A coalescence approach is developed for constructing the primary fragments in phase space. The secondary decay process of the fragments is described by the well-known statistical code. It is found that the localized energy released in antibaryon-baryon annihilation is deposited in a nucleus mainly via pion-nucleon collisions, which leads to the emissions of pre-equilibrium particles, fission, evaporation of nucleons and light fragments etc. The strangeness exchange reactions dominate the hyperon production. The averaged mass loss increases with the mass number of <b>target</b> <b>nucleus.</b> A bump structure in the domain of intermediate mass for <b>heavy</b> <b>targets</b> appears owing to the contribution of fission fragments.
