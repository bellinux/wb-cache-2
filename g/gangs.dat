African-American street <b>gangs</b> familiar in other cities, including the Crips, have struggled to establish footholds in the city, although <b>gangs</b> with shotcallers in China, including Triad {{groups such as the}} Wo Hop To, have been reported active. In 1977, an ongoing rivalry between two Chinese <b>gangs</b> led to a shooting attack at the Golden Dragon restaurant in Chinatown, which left five people dead and eleven wounded. Five members of the Joe Boys gang were arrested and convicted of the crime. Oakland, which also sees organized gang violence, implemented Operation Ceasefire in 2012 in an effort to reduce the violence.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Gang</b> Unit is {{a statewide}} {{specialty}} unit established to: suppress criminal <b>gang</b> activity, investigate <b>gang</b> related crimes, and gather intelligence on known and suspected <b>gang</b> members. <b>Gang</b> Unit duties include street-level narcotics enforcement, weapons enforcement, criminal investigation, and special operations.

In addition to these activities, the <b>Gang</b> Unit also provides local police departments with personnel, intelligence, expertise, and training specific to battling gang-related crime. The <b>Gang</b> Unit maintains partnerships with, and provides <b>gang</b> awareness training to: schools, corporations, social service agencies, probation officers, trial courts, District Attorneys' offices, and civilian groups.

Once all three <b>gangs</b> are fully exterminated, in the closing cutscene of the game, the Director reveals to the Agent {{that there was an}} ulterior motive for the Agency's actions: the Agency had secretly empowered the three <b>gangs</b> in the first place to instill fear in Pacific City's residents, thus creating a need for the Agency to control the city, and acceptance in the populace when they did take over. The Agency Director's comments suggest that the Agency will replicate this plan in other cities across the globe to create a New World Order.|$|E
5|$|Also in 2002, DiCaprio {{appeared}} in Martin Scorsese's <b>Gangs</b> of New York, a historical film {{set in the}} mid-19th century in the Five Points district of New York City. Director Scorsese initially struggled selling his idea of realizing the film until DiCaprio became interested in playing protagonist Amsterdam Vallon, a young leader of the Irish faction, and thus, Miramax Films got involved with financing the project. Nonetheless production on the film was plagued by blown-out budgets and producer-director squabbles, resulting in a marathon eight-month shoot and, at US$103 million, the most expensive film Scorsese had ever made. Upon its release, <b>Gangs</b> of New York became a financial and critical success. DiCaprio's acting was well-received but was overshadowed by Daniel Day-Lewis' performance among most critics.|$|E

5|$|At 10:30 pm, {{the crowd}} became violent after an {{individual}} threw a bottle off a roof {{into the crowd}} aggregated about the hospital. The group dispersed into <b>gangs</b> containing between 50–100 members. The <b>gangs</b> first broke windows of white businesses as they traveled through Harlem: if the mob was told the business was owned by blacks, they left it alone. If it was owned by whites, the store would be looted and vandalized. Rioters broke streetlights and threw white mannequins onto the ground. In grocery stores, the rioters took war-scarce items, such as coffee and sugar; clothing, and liquor; and furniture stores were also looted. Estimates put the total monetary damage between $250,000–$5,000,000, which included 1,485 stores burglarized and 4,495 windows broken.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a single case}} study of one street <b>gang</b> in one London borough. Semistructured {{interviews were conducted with}} 12 <b>gang</b> members, or former <b>gang</b> members, and seven practitioners. The practitioners and <b>gang</b> members / ex-gang members reported different perspectives on how the <b>gang</b> was structured and drug dealing was organised. The <b>gang</b> members / ex-gang members suggested that the <b>gang</b> is a loose social network with little recognisable formal organisation. Although individual <b>gang</b> members sell drugs, the <b>gang</b> should not be viewed as a drug dealing organisation. Rather it is a composition of individual drug dealers who cooperate out of mutual self-interest. Therefore, some <b>gang</b> members are best described as independent entrepreneurs while others are subcontractors looking to 'go solo'. The seven practitioners, however, tended to describe a more hierarchically structured <b>gang,</b> with formal recruitment processes. This divergence of perspective highlights an important consideration for policy and research...|$|R

The group's purpose was to oppose the influence of the violent <b>gangs</b> within the university; despite his promises, Prío had failed to control the situation, instead offering many of their senior members jobs in government ministries. Castro volunteered to deliver a speech for the Movement on November 13, exposing the government's secret deals with the <b>gangs</b> and identifying key members. Attracting the attention of the national press, the speech angered the <b>gangs,</b> and Castro fled into hiding, first in the countryside and then in the U.S. Returning to Havana several weeks later, Castro lay low and focused on his university studies, graduating as a Doctor of Law in September 1950.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>gang</b> {{system is}} a system of {{division}} of labor within slavery on a plantation. It is the more brutal of two main types of labor systems.
