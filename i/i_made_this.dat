5|$|The {{development}} of effective time-delay shells {{at the end}} of World War <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>this</b> scheme much less effective, as the intact shell would penetrate layers of weak armour and explode deep inside the ship. In addition, she was grossly overweight compared to her original design, making her a wet ship with a highly stressed structure.|$|E
5|$|The year 1918 saw the {{introduction}} of the Education Act 1918, commonly also known as the Fisher Act as it was devised by Herbert Fisher. The act enforced compulsory education from 5–14 years, but also included provision for compulsory part-time education for all 14 to 18-year-olds. There were also plans for expansion in tertiary education, by raising the participation age to 18 though cuts in public spending after World War <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>this</b> impractical. This is the first act which starting planning provisions for young people to remain in education until the age of 18. The 1918 act was not implemented until a further act of 1921 was passed.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Fischer {{stayed at}} the home of {{grandmaster}} Peter Biyiasas, where, over a period of four months, he defeated Biyiasas seventeen times in a series of speed games. In an interview with Sports Illustrated reporter William Nack, Biyiasas assessed Fischer's play:He was too good. There was no use in playing him. It wasn't interesting. I was getting beaten, and it wasn't clear to me why. It wasn't like <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>this</b> mistake or that mistake. It was like I was being gradually outplayed, from the start. He wasn't taking any time to think. The most depressing thing about it is that I wasn't even getting out of the middle game to an endgame. I don't ever remember an endgame. He honestly believes there is no one for him to play, no one worthy of him. I played him, and I can attest to that.|$|E

It's {{not so much about}} this particular city but more about the people who inhabit it." [...] He further said, [...] "It's a story about hope and dreams. It's a story about people making the impossible possible—whether it's Kanye West, James Franco, or a kid who's living on the streets on Hollywood Boulevard. It's a story about survival and about what it takes to become who you really want to be." ...|$|E
500|$|Straczynski {{surprised}} many when he publicly revealed: [...] "There's a {{lot that}} I don't agree with, and <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>this</b> very clear to everybody within shouting distance at Marvel, especially Joe Quesada... {{there was a point}} where I made the decision, and told Joe, that I was going to take my name off the last two issues of the OMD arc. Eventually, Joe talked me out of that decision because {{at the end of the}} day, I don't want to sabotage Joe or Marvel, and I have a lot of respect for both of those." [...] Quesada explained this disagreement with Straczynski, stating that their rift was primarily over the [...] "methodology" [...] of how to erase Peter and Mary Jane's marriage, but Straczynski was on board with the editorial mandate of undoing the Parkers' marriage.|$|E

2500|$|A few Iranian exile groups saw a new {{audience}} in Western gays. They began reporting multiple executions in Iran as gay-related...

We was trying to go to the radio and not do the typical R {{featured}} record. I was trying to be more creative and find somebody who can do melody as well as rap on the record. Nelly doesn't really rap on this song, he's singing. He has that different style. That's kind of what the record is. We see that enough: R with a rapper feature. That's why I call this a duet as opposed to a feature".|$|E

2500|$|In December 2008, Georgian President Saakashvili declared: [...] "I {{have always}} openly {{acknowledged}} that I ordered {{military action in}} South Ossetia -- as any responsible democratic leader would have done, and as the Georgian Constitution required me to do {{in defense of the}} country. <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>this</b> decision after being confronted by two facts. First, Russia had massed hundreds of tanks and thousands of soldiers on the border between Russian and Georgia in the area of South Ossetia. (...) Second, for a week Russian forces and their proxies engaged in a series of deadly provocations, shelling Georgian villages that were under my government's control -- with much of the artillery located in Tskhinvali, often within sites controlled by Russian peacekeepers. Then, on Aug. 7, Russia and its proxies killed several Georgian peacekeepers." [...] He also said that when the crisis began to escalate, he tried to call Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on both August 6 and 7, but he did not answer.|$|E
2500|$|Given {{the strangeness}} of the concept, some historians have doubted {{the reality of the}} {{exchange}} of goods and suggested that the exchange was really a transfer of the liturgy itself. [...] For contrary evidence, others [...] look to Demosthenes' speech [...] "Against Phaenippus", where an exchange of property is explicitly mentioned by the litigant: [...] "For <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>this</b> offer before to Phaenippus, and now again, men of the jury, I tender it freely:—I will surrender to him all my property including the mines, if he will hand over to me the farm alone free from all encumbrances as it was when I first went to it with witnesses, and will replace as they were before the grain and wine and the other things which he has carried away from the buildings after removing the seals from the doors." [...] However, it is possible that placing seals on the property was done solely to assess the respective fortunes of the owners.|$|E
