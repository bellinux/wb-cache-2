40|$|Advanced {{types of}} Umbrella Shaped Fish Protection Arrangement (UFPA) were {{developed}} at St. Petersburg Architectural and Civil Engineering University. Fish protection strategy proposed {{is based on}} use of specific stream patterns at water intake, accounting for the swimming habits of different fish species. Pertaining computer program for streams velocity calculation in water <b>intake</b> <b>zone</b> was also developed and is available to the eventual Customers. Graphs based on specific fish species swimming habits can be effectively used in pre-setting of protective water streams patterns in water <b>intake</b> <b>zone.</b> Efficiency of formulated theoretical approach to fish protection problems was confirmed by results obtained on various fish species in pilot fish protection arrangement test runs. Test runs successfully completed, more than 15 UFPA with water intake capacity varying in range from 0. 1 to 12 cu. m. per second were manufactured and installed at river bed, shore, and bucket water intakes. Advanced UFPA implementation resulted in up to 80 - 85 % effective fish protection, not affecting water intake reliability. Proposed fish protection concepts simplicity and low material requirements provide for existing water intakes conversion and upgrading practically without interruption in water supply...|$|E

40|$|Harmful {{cyanobacteria}} {{and their}} metabolites often contaminate drinking water resources, and effective control remains challenging. Here, {{we developed a}} physical algal pre-treatment method, the vertical weir curtain (VWC), to mitigate cyanobacteria {{and some of their}} metabolites (geosmin, 2 -methylisoborneol (2 -MIB), and microcystins) in situ and evaluated its performance in a raw water reservoir used for drinking water supply. The VWC was manufactured with two fibrous polypropylene mats (0 % and 92 % porosity) which were mounted to maintain a constant underwater depth. We installed the VWC to cover the entire epilimnion of the drinking water <b>intake</b> <b>zone</b> and monitored its efficiency during an algal bloom period (July–October 2015). Reduction rates were 40 – 59 % for total algae, 60 – 75 % for cyanobacteria, 23 – 55 % for geosmin, 30 – 51 % for 2 -MIB, and 47 – 89 % for microcystin-LR during the study period. Significant reductions were observed in the shallow layer of the water column (1 – 3 m water depth), particularly during August, when cyanobacterial density was the highest. The results indicate that the VWC can effectively mitigate harmful cyanobacteria and their metabolites when suitably applied, serving as a valuable reference for the algal reduction in raw drinking water resources...|$|E
40|$|Hydraulic model {{tests were}} carried out in order to {{establish}} the feasibility of the Teesta VI hydropower plant in Sikkim State, Northern India. An initial arrangement of barrage and river intake with four desander basins on the right bank of the Teesta River, tributary to the Brahmaputra, has been proposed. During high Monsoon floods, river bed load and suspended sediments shall be diverted through the spillway openings. During normal operation, the four desander basins of 250 m lenght with free flow conditions must be able to evacuate suspended sediments avoiding their entrainment into the power intakes. In order to study flow conditions and evaluate the river intake and desander design, LSPIV and UVP measurements were performed at several locations within the basins and the <b>intake</b> <b>zone.</b> The measurements were conducted for two different river intake designs. UVP allowed to measure mean flow velocity and evaluate the retention efficiency of the basins. Overall flow field comparisons for different scenarios over the entire model surface are reported by LSPIV technique [...] The mean flow velocity is the main parameter to design a desander and it {{is directly related to the}} sediment grain size diameter to be removed. To improve the desander efficiency, flow disturbances as reverse flows, circulation cells and eddies must be avoided. Therefore the flow velocity must be well distributed all over the cross section and the flow velocity standard deviation must be minimized...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} carried out in the sea {{adjacent}} to a major MSF plant where a new 24 MGD SWRO plant is being commissioned. Data were collected on the topographical feature of the marine basin, water quality and plankton of the <b>intake</b> <b>zone.</b> The incidents of planktonic bloom, influx of invasive organisms like jellyfish and macrofouling organisms and ingress of marine algae were monitored regularly. The Intake Bay of the plant is a well designed man-made structure studded to the coast. The marine basin in Al-Jubail, is for geological reasons, a shallow gently sloping shelf while the bay proper is a dredged, deeper basin. The area outside the bay is a vast sea grass bed and the seafloor sediment is sandy. The drag of sea water maintained by the intake pumps facilitates the transport of sediment particles, uprooted algae and floating objects creating fouling problems inside the plant. Seawater temperatures, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen and trace metals were found to be very much benign to the trouble free operation of the plant. Influx of jellyfish, noticed during the summer, was not found to be very severe. Data on plankton showed the presence of many phyto and zooplankton organism of biofouling potential in the plant. Total suspended solids indicated the possibility of the intake bay becoming a source of elevated Silt Density Index (SDI) for the new SWRO plant. The paper considers the data in detail and discusses the effects of environment on the desalination plant in Al-Jubail and suggests certain strategies for the protection of seawater intakes and some points useful in the siting and design of coastal seawater intakes in the region...|$|E
50|$|In {{many areas}} of the DRC, land use changes are {{associated}} with degradation of drinking water sources. The main threat to drinking water sources poses the unregulated growth of urban and rural areas. The nonexistence of drinking water protection zones results in the exposure of vulnerable source areas to pollution and land degradation. Springs, river <b>intake</b> <b>zones,</b> wellheads, priority lake and reservoir segments as well as aquifer recharge areas comprise the most endangered water source areas, which typically lack any form of identifiable demarcation and protection. Modification of runoff patterns, increased erosion and environmental degradation are the consequences of unregulated expansion of inhabited and agricultural areas. Development of housing, poor road construction, pit latrines, septic tanks, mining operations, and tailings are important contributors to pollution of water sources. In urban areas, industry, fuel stations, garages, abattoirs and storm water runoff are further sources of contamination. Biological contamination from sewage and solid waste disposal and increased suspended sediment loads are the two main sources of pollution.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} some results {{concerning}} {{the evolution of}} 3 D fluid flow pattern through all four strokes in combustion chambers with entirely different bowl-in-piston geometry layouts ranging from ”omega” to “simple cylinder” were presented. All combustion chambers i. e. those with „omega“ bowls, with different profiles, and those with „cylinder“ bowls, with different squish area ranging from 44 % to 62 %, were with flat head, vertical valves and identical elevation of intake and exhaust ports. A bunch of results emerged by dint of multidimensional modeling of nonreactive fluid flow in arbitrary geometry with moving objects and boundaries. The fluid flow pattern during induction and compression in all cases was extremely complicated and entirely three-dimensional. It {{should be noted that}} significant differences due to geometry of the bowl were encountered only in the vicinity of TDC. Namely, in the case of “omega” bowl all three types of organized macro flows were observed while in the case of “cylinder” bowl no circumferential velocity was registered at all. On the contrary, in the case of “cylinder” bowl some interesting results concerning reverse tumble and its center of rotation shifting from exhaust valve <b>zone</b> to <b>intake</b> valve <b>zone</b> during induction stroke and vice-verse from <b>intake</b> valve <b>zone</b> to exhaust valve zone during compression were observed while in the case of “omega” bowl no such a displacement was legible.

For that reason it is not affected by the geometry of the bowl...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{temporal}} distribution of phytoplanktonic cyanobacteria in a site located in the freshwater tidal zone near the extraction point for the drinking water supply. Samples were taken considering three timescales as follows: hours, days, and weeks, during the period of highest development of cyanobacteria. The phytoplankton density, microcystin concentration (LR, RR, YR), and chlorophyll-a were related to meteorological variables (wind and temperature), tidal high, and physicalchemical variables (nutrients, pH, conductivity, light penetration). The results obtained in this study showed that the variables that primarily modulate the temporal distribution of cyanobacteria were temperature, pH, light penetration, conductivity, and nutrients (particularly NO 3 − and NH 4 +), while the winds and tide had a secondary effect, only evidenced at an hourly scale. Therefore, this timescale would be the most suitable for monitoring cyanobacterial populations, when the amount of cyanobacterial cells exceeds the alert I level proposed by the World Health Organization. This recommendation is particularly important for the water <b>intake</b> <b>zones</b> in Río de la Plata, which are vulnerable to the damage generated by cyanobacteria on the water quality.

40|$|Between 1920 and 1950 an oil {{gasification}} plant operated on a property adjacent to Kettle Creek about 0. 2 km {{from the mouth}} of Port Stanley harbour on Lake Erie, Ontario, Canada. Oil tar wastes from the gasification plant were stored on the site until it was eventually abandoned in 1987. At that time the Ontario Ministry of the Environment (MOE) determined that the site was contaminated with heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and that some of this waste had been flowing into Kettle Creek through the George Street drain in the village of Port Stanley for an undetermined period of time. The site was completely remediated in 1995 and the flow of contaminated water from the drain ceased. However, sediment sampling revealed the presence of heavy metals and PAHs in Kettle Creek, the inner and outer harbours, and in Lake Erie. From a drinking water source protection perspective, there was an interest in identifying the oil tar contaminants and assessing contaminated sediment transport within the Elgin Area Water Treatment Plant <b>intake</b> protection <b>zones</b> (IPZs). The effectiveness of conventional treatment processes currently available within Elgin Area Water Treatment Plant (WTP) in removing these contaminants was also evaluated. According to historical monitoring data from various compartments including soil, sediment, groundwater and surface water, three types of contaminants were identified, including heavy metals (Sb, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Pb, Ni, Se, V and Zn), PAHs and volatile organics (benzene, toluene, phenols). Due to extremely low toxicity and exposure probability, some unregulated contaminants (iron, vanadium, zinc, phenol and some PAHs) were removed from the final contaminant list and were not discussed from the perspective of treatment. A technique developed by the USEPA to characterize and track contaminant plumes in water, the fingerprint analysis of leachate contaminants (FALCON), was for the first time investigated for its suitability as a tool to assist with the interpretation of contaminated sediment transport in surface water originating from a former oil/coal gasification plant and its potential to help assess drinking water <b>intake</b> protection <b>zones.</b> A source fingerprint based on 4 heavy metals (As, Cr, Pb, Ni) and 6 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from 12 sampling sites in a contaminant-impacted harbour was generated. This source fingerprint of the contaminated harbour sediments was then compared to 48 fingerprints generated at other sites in the vicinity of two <b>intake</b> protection <b>zones</b> of a drinking water treatment plant. The source fingerprint did not match fingerprints of sites upstream from the contaminant input source in the creek which fed the small harbour and other potential contamination sources to the east and west in the lake. However, the source fingerprint did match most sites in an outer harbour and some outside the harbour break walls, including sediments collected from within the drinking water intake pipe ~ 3 km to the east of the harbour. A high correlation between water intake sediments and the source fingerprint demonstrated that contaminated sediments have reached water intake. However, no exceedances of the target contaminants were reported in intake surface water in the period from 1990 – 2010. It was also found that the correlation between the source fingerprint and those in the intake has been decreasing over the period for which data are available, confirming the success of remediation efforts. Surface water monitoring has demonstrated that PAH concentrations are lower than detection limits and only iron (Fe) exceeds the Ontario Drinking Water Quality Standards (ODWQS) aesthetic objective. The concentrations of oil tar contaminants in treated water were all below the MOE regulated concentrations, indicating that the current Elgin Area Water Treatment Plant configuration is effectively removing any oil tar contaminants present in raw water. Critical raw water concentrations (CRWCs), which represent maximum raw water concentrations that can reliably be removed by the Elgin WTP, were predicted for each oil tar contaminant. The probability of each contaminant exceeding the CRWC was then estimated using a Log Pearson Type III distribution. Copper was found to be the contaminant with the highest exceedance probability. A point system was designed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of other treatment alternatives and to select the most appropriate of these to improve the robustness of the WTP. Granular activated carbon (GAC) was determined to be the most cost-effective compared to other techniques and hence is considered as the most suitable technique to be implemented in the plant in order to improve its robustness as it relates to dissolved heavy metal species and PAHs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Expanding {{traditional}} time geography, {{this study}} examines personal exposure to air pollution and personal pollutant intake, and defines personal health danger zones by accounting for individual level space-time behavior. A 3 D personal air pollution and health risk map is constructed to visualize individual space-time path, personal Air Quality Indexes (AQIs), and personal health danger zones. Personal air pollution exposure level and its variation through space and time is measured by a portable air pollutant sensor coupled with a portable GPS unit. Personal pollutant intake is estimated by accounting for air pollutant concentration in immediate surroundings, individual’s biophysical characteristics, and individual’s space-time activities. Personal air pollution danger zones are defined by comparing personal pollutant intake with air quality standard; these zones are particular space-time-activity segments along an individual’s space-time path. Being able to identify personal air pollution danger zones can help plan for proper actions aiming at controlling health impacts from air pollution. As a case study, this paper reports on an examination and visualization of an individual’s two-day ozone exposure, <b>intake</b> and danger <b>zones</b> in Houston, Texas...|$|R
40|$|As on land, {{plants are}} the real {{producers}} in the sea, and on them depend all marine living resources and the basic sustainability of ecosystems. Primary production is performed by chlorophyll-bearing plants ranging from the tiny phytoplankton to the giant kelps {{through the process of}} photosynthesis. Zooplankton play an important role as secondary producers and together with phytoplankton they support the vast assemblages of marine food chain with all their diversity and complexity. Data on chlorophyll pigments, phytoplankton and zooplankton are regarded as a sound basis for environmental appraisal of ecosystems. This paper presents and discusses a set of data collected from the Saudi Arabian coastal waters near the desalination plants in AI-Jubail. Materials were collected from six different sites covering the <b>intake</b> and discharge <b>zones</b> during cruises carried out in 1997 - 98. Analyses of Chlorophyll pigments were made using the spectrophotometric method. Plankton samples were collected using a Nansen plankton net of 75 µ mesh size, and analyzed following standard procedures. Chlorophyll a,b,c and Phaeophytin are the most commonly occurring pigment in seawater. Their concentrations showed wide fluctuation. The phytoplankton community was composed of 35 genera representing the Diatoms, Dinoflagellates and Blue- green algae. Zooplankton was composed of Protozoa, Coelentrata,Ctenophora, Aschelminthes, Annelida, Mollusca, Arthropoda, Echinodermata and Chordata. Arthropoda, represented by Cladocera, Copepoda and Crustacean larvae, formed the largest group followed by Chordata. The distribution of phyto and zooplankton are examined and discussed on a seasonal, annual and inter annual basis. In terms of species, over all species composition has not been affected b...|$|R
