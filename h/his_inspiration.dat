5|$|After {{the release}} of I Not Stupid, a sequel was suggested, but Neo had {{difficulty}} finding a suitable topic. <b>His</b> <b>inspiration</b> was a book on appreciation education, a method of teaching developed by Chinese educator Zhou Hong.

5|$|Although Pericles was a {{main source}} of <b>his</b> <b>inspiration,</b> some historians have noted that the passionate and idealistic {{literary}} style of the speeches Thucydides attributes to Pericles is completely at odds with Thucydides' own cold and analytical writing style. This might, however, {{be the result of}} the incorporation of the genre of rhetoric into the genre of historiography. That is to say, Thucydides could simply have used two different writing styles for two different purposes.|$|E

5|$|Pianist McCoy Tyner, {{who grew}} up close to the Powell {{brothers}} in Philadelphia, was influenced by their relatively heavy keyboard touch and their liking of percussive piano sounds. Tyner also got some of <b>his</b> <b>inspiration</b> for chord voicings from hearing Richie's use of left-hand fourths. Tyner's voicings became the norm for young jazz pianists.|$|E
5|$|After the 2004 {{release of}} , Powderfinger took a hiatus, and several members {{played in the}} side {{projects}} Drag and The Predators. Fanning decided to work independently and acted on direction he felt unable to explore {{as a member of}} Powderfinger. Some of <b>his</b> <b>inspiration</b> was derived from a will {{to see if he was}} capable of recording a solo album, considering what he viewed as his limited guitar playing abilities; compared to bandmates Darren Middleton and Ian Haug. The distance from the band, coupled with the more relaxed writing process for Tea & Sympathy helped Fanning to unwind from the stress left over from 10 years working recording and touring with Powderfinger.|$|E
5|$|Early in his career, Peart's {{performance}} {{style was}} {{deeply rooted in}} hard rock. He drew most of <b>his</b> <b>inspiration</b> from drummers such as Keith Moon and John Bonham, players {{who were at the}} forefront of the British hard rock scene. As time passed, he began to emulate jazz and big band musicians Gene Krupa and Buddy Rich. In 1994, Peart became a friend and pupil of jazz instructor Freddie Gruber. It was during this time that Peart decided to revamp his playing style by incorporating jazz and swing components. Gruber was also responsible for introducing him to the products of Drum Workshop, the company whose products Peart currently endorses.|$|E

5|$|Father Dale Grubba, {{the priest}} who had presided over Kulwicki's funeral, {{released}} {{a biography of}} his friend entitled Alan Kulwicki: NASCAR champion Against All Odds in 2009.

The film chronicles Kulwicki's life from racing late models at Slinger Super Speedway, through his rise to NASCAR champion, and ends with his death. The movie was created by Kulwicki's Wisconsin fans for less than $100,000. The star of the film, Brad Weber, was a Kulwicki fan and credits the late driver with being <b>his</b> <b>inspiration</b> to become an actor.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí's work is {{normally}} classed as modernista, and {{it belongs to}} this movement because of its eagerness to renovate without breaking with tradition, its quest for modernity, the ornamental sense applied to works, and the multidisciplinary character of its undertakings, where craftsmanship plays a central role. To this, Gaudí adds a dose of the baroque, adopts technical advances and continues to use traditional architectural language. Together with <b>his</b> <b>inspiration</b> from nature and the original touch of his works, this amalgam gives his works their personal and unique character {{in the history of}} architecture.|$|E
5|$|Ramanujan {{spent nearly}} five years in Cambridge collaborating with Hardy and Littlewood, and {{published}} part of his findings there. Hardy and Ramanujan had highly contrasting personalities. Their collaboration was a clash of different cultures, beliefs, and working styles. In the previous few decades, the foundations of mathematics had come into question {{and the need for}} mathematically rigorous proofs recognized. Hardy was an atheist and an apostle of proof and mathematical rigour, whereas Ramanujan was a deeply religious man who relied very strongly on his intuition and insights. While in England, Hardy tried his best to fill the gaps in Ramanujan's education and to mentor him in the need for formal proofs to support his results, without hindering <b>his</b> <b>inspiration</b> - a conflict that neither found easy.|$|E

Game publisher Panda rereleased an identical version of Space Cavern under the name Space Canyon the following year, and an Atari 5200 port was started but not completed.|$|E

5|$|The {{series was}} created by Japanese manga artist Kazuhiko Katō under the pen name Monkey Punch. <b>His</b> <b>inspiration</b> for the series was the fictional French gentleman thief Arsène Lupin, created by Maurice Leblanc.

Originally the intention {{was to keep the}} blood ties between the two fictional characters secret, however he was convinced by others not to do so.|$|E
5|$|Alternate {{theories}} of self-defence, inspired by Ahimsa, build principles similar to {{theories of}} just war. Aikido, pioneered in Japan, illustrates one such principles of self-defence. Morihei Ueshiba, {{the founder of}} Aikido, described <b>his</b> <b>inspiration</b> as Ahimsa. According to this interpretation of Ahimsa in self-defence, one must not assume {{that the world is}} free of aggression. One must presume that some people will, out of ignorance, error or fear, attack other persons or intrude into their space, physically or verbally. The aim of self-defence, suggested Ueshiba, must be to neutralise the aggression of the attacker, and avoid the conflict. The best defence is one where the victim is protected, as well as the attacker is respected and not injured if possible. Under Ahimsa and Aikido, there are no enemies, and appropriate self-defence focuses on neutralising the immaturity, assumptions and aggressive strivings of the attacker.|$|E
5|$|Elgar's {{principal}} large-scale {{early works}} were for chorus and orchestra for the Three Choirs and other festivals. These were The Black Knight, King Olaf, The Light of Life, The Banner of St George and Caractacus. He also wrote a Te Deum and Benedictus for the Hereford Festival. Of these, McVeagh comments favourably on his lavish orchestration and innovative use of leitmotifs, but less favourably on {{the qualities of}} his chosen texts and the patchiness of <b>his</b> <b>inspiration.</b> McVeagh makes the point that, because these works of the 1890s were for many years little known (and performances remain rare), the mastery of his first great success, the Enigma Variations, {{appeared to be a}} sudden transformation from mediocrity to genius, but in fact his orchestral skills had been building up throughout the decade.|$|E

5|$|On December 15, 1987, {{entrepreneur}} Jerry Richardson {{announced his}} bid for an NFL expansion franchise in the Carolinas. A North Carolina native, Richardson was a former wide receiver on the Baltimore Colts who had used his 1959 league championship bonus to co-found the Hardee's restaurant chain, later becoming president and CEO of TW Services. Richardson drew <b>his</b> <b>inspiration</b> to pursue an NFL franchise from George Shinn, who had made a successful bid for an expansion National Basketball Association (NBA) team in Charlotte, the Charlotte Hornets. Richardson founded Richardson Sports, a partnership consisting of himself, his family, {{and a number of}} businessmen from North and South Carolina were also recruited to be limited partners. Richardson looked at four potential locations for a stadium, ultimately choosing uptown Charlotte. In choosing the team name, the Richardsons did not run focus groups with potential fans. Their intention had always been the 'Panthers'; Jerry Richardson began driving a car with the license plate 'PNTHRS' near the end of 1989.|$|E
5|$|Sjumandjaja first {{marriage}} was to ballet dancer Farida Utoyo, {{whom he met}} and married while in the Soviet Union; Utoyo was studying at the Moscow State Academy of Choreography. With Utoyo he had two sons, Aridya Yudistira and Sri Aksana (former drummer of Dewa 19). The couple's separation in the early 1970s served as <b>his</b> <b>inspiration</b> for Flambojan (Flamboyant; 1972). After divorcing Utoyo, Sjumandjaja married actress Tuti Kirana before the release of Si Doel Anak Betawi. In 1973 the couple had a daughter, Djenar Maesa Ayu, who later became a writer-cum-director and won a Citra Award for her debut film Mereka Bilang, Saya Monyet! (They Say I'm a Monkey!; 2007). In 1982 his relationship with Kirana soured, and the couple divorced. In 1984 he married a third wife, Zoraya Perucha.|$|E
5|$|Space Invaders {{was created}} by Tomohiro Nishikado, who spent a year {{designing}} the game and developing the necessary hardware to produce it. The game's inspiration {{is reported to have}} come from varying sources, including an adaptation of the mechanical game Space Monsters released by Taito in 1972, and a dream about Japanese school children who are waiting for Santa Claus and are attacked by invading aliens. However, Nishikado has cited Atari's arcade game Breakout as <b>his</b> <b>inspiration.</b> He aimed to create a shooting game that featured the same sense of achievement from completing stages and destroying targets, but with more complex graphics. Nishikado used a similar layout to that of Breakout but altered the game mechanics. Rather than bounce a ball to attack static objects, players are given the ability to fire projectiles at their own discretion to attack moving enemies.|$|E
