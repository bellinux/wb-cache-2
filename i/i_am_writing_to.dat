25|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>writing</b> <b>to</b> {{ask you to}} {{consider}} the inclusion of my son, E. M. Grace– a splendid hitter and most excellent catch– in your England XI. I am sure he would play very well and do the team much credit. It may interest you to learn that I have another son, now twelve years of age, who will in time be a much better player than his brother because his back stroke is sounder, and he always plays with a straight bat.|$|E
2500|$|I am {{often asked}} why I begin my letters this way. No matter whether <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>writing</b> <b>to</b> my lady or to my butcher, always I begin with these eleven words. Why, how else should I begin? What other {{greeting}} {{could be so}} glad? Look, brother, we are free! Rejoice with me, sister, {{there is no law}} beyond Do what thou wilt! ...|$|E
6000|$|À propos {{of spiritual}} {{messages}} comes in Georgina, and, hearing that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>writing</b> <b>to</b> you, delivers the following enigma to be conveyed to Mrs. White: ...|$|E
60|$|BOBBY. Of course I couldnt {{hold you}} to our {{engagement}} after that. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> <b>to</b> you {{to break it}} off. [He also descends {{from the table and}} makes slowly for the hearth]. You must think me an utter rotter.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, papa, {{it must be}} to-night, if you please. It is {{necessary}} {{for me to know}} before to-morrow how <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>to</b> Lord Fitzjocelyn.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You needn't tell me that. I wonder, Selina, if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>to</b> my sister, {{whether she}} could send me over {{anything}} that would answer?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I just {{mentioned}} it," [...] said Hartley, [...] "although I suppose Mrs. Chinnery is mostly responsible {{while they are}} with her. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>writing</b> <b>to</b> tell Trimblett that the children are at Tranquil Vale. When he comes back perhaps, he will make other arrangements." ...|$|E
6000|$|Yes, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>writing</b> <b>to</b> a man; {{but let me}} {{not think}} of that, for madness is in the thought. You will {{understand}} my feelings? O yes, I am sure you will; and you will respect them too, and not despise them, - will you? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dearest Janet, {{let it be}} dropped;--pray let it be dropped. I am {{sure you}} believe me now when I say that it can do no good. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>writing</b> <b>to</b> my aunt this moment {{to tell her that}} I will return. What day shall I name?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fan! I don't know. We made no arrangement. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>to</b> let {{her know}} when to come. Has Fan {{anything}} to do with the vexation you speak of?" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{event of}} to-day {{began with the}} {{delivery}} of a message summoning me to my father's study. He had decided--too hastily, as <b>I</b> feared--that he <b>was</b> sufficiently recovered to resume his usual employments. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> <b>to</b> his dictation, when we were interrupted. Maria announced a visit from Mr. Dunboyne.|$|R
6000|$|... 'She {{wished to}} spare us all, but that <b>was</b> not allowed. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>written</b> <b>to,</b> and told that her strong desire {{was such a}} {{favourable}} condition, that I had better consent, {{so as not to}} protract the strain of spirits. She made a point of no one else knowing except Clement.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jump up at once, Dick; I {{want you}} to ride over with a letter to Mr Jackson. We have pretty well settled that you shall go with Mr Harvey, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>writing</b> <b>to</b> make an offer to Mr Jackson {{for the use of}} his waggon for six months." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{understood}} {{that you would}} return to the factory this evening for a few minutes, before taking the train to Liverpool. There were one or two matters upon which I should like some further information, but as time is short <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>writing</b> <b>to</b> you at the Waldorf Hotel at New York.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, Mr. Monk, and {{how they}} left Miss Fregelius behind, and you went to fetch her, {{and all sorts of}} strange things {{happened}} to you. We think it quite wonderful and romantic. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>writing</b> <b>to</b> dear Miss Porson to tell her about it, because I am sure that you are too modest to sing your own praises." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'When {{do you go}} down?' again asked Mr. Smith. 'To {{tell you}} the truth, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> <b>to</b> Lancelot when you were announced! but the post will not reach him till to-morrow at noon, {{and we are all}} so busy here, that I have no one whom I can trust to carry down an express.' ...|$|R
60|$|And, as <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>writing</b> this <b>to</b> you, <b>I</b> see {{no reason}} why I shouldn't go on in behalf of myself.|$|R
5000|$|... 'as {{a matter}} of fact <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sitting there as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> this <b>to</b> you' (i.e. 'I am sitting there as I <b>write</b> this <b>to</b> you') ...|$|R
60|$|I {{wish you}} would tell your father--not that I like to {{encourage}} my rival--that {{we have had a}} wonderful time here of late, and that they are having a cold day on Mulinuu, and the consuls are writing reports, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>writing</b> <b>to</b> the Times, and if we don't get rid of our friends this time I shall begin to despair of everything but my name-daughter.|$|E
6000|$|... "MY DEAR MAGDALEN--You have no useless remonstrances to {{apprehend}} {{at the sight}} of my handwriting. My only object in this letter is to tell you something which I know your sister will not tell you of her own accord. She is entirely ignorant that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>writing</b> <b>to</b> you. Keep her in ignorance, if you wish to spare her unnecessary anxiety, and me unnecessary distress.|$|E
60|$|I {{wish you}} would tell your father - not that I like to {{encourage}} my rival - {{that we have had}} a wonderful time here of late, and that they are having a cold day on Mulinuu, and the consuls are writing reports, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>writing</b> <b>to</b> the TIMES, and if we don't get rid of our friends this time I shall begin to despair of everything but my name-daughter.|$|E
6000|$|Dr. Martineau {{pressed the}} limp hand upon the little tea table. [...] "I understand, dear lady," [...] he said. [...] "I understand. Now ... suppose <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>to</b> her and arrange--I {{do not see}} that you need {{be put to the}} pain of meeting her. Suppose <b>I</b> <b>were</b> to meet her here myself? ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> {{discovered}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{putting all}} this into {{the form of}} a letter <b>to</b> Mary. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> <b>to</b> her in my mind, as many people talk to themselves. And I remember that I wandered upon the Palatine Hill musing over the idea of writing a long letter to her, a long continuous letter to her, a sort of diary of impressions and ideas, that somewhen, years ahead, <b>I</b> might <b>be</b> able to put into her hands.|$|R
60|$|Of course my {{aunt was}} {{immediately}} made {{acquainted with the}} successful issue of the conference, and with all that had been said and done {{in the course of}} it. She was happy to see me so happy, and promised to call on Dora's aunts without loss of time. But she took such a long walk up and down our rooms that night, while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> <b>to</b> Agnes, that <b>I</b> began to think she meant to walk till morning.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>writing</b> <b>to</b> you in {{this fashion}} even {{although}} I am writing you [...] "intimately"; because I am not at the present moment in very good form for any free play of hand, and this machinery helps me so much when there is any question of pressure and promptitude, or above all of particular clearness. That is the case at present--at least I feel I ought to lose no more time.|$|E
60|$|However, {{everybody}} is all right, now, except Yortzburg, {{and he is}} mending--that is, he is being mended. I knocked off, during these stirring times, and don't intend {{to go to work}} again till we go away for the Summer, 3 or 6 weeks hence. So <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>writing</b> <b>to</b> you not because I have anything to say, but because you don't have to answer and I need something to do this afternoon.....|$|E
6000|$|... "MY DEAR VALENTINE,--Although <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>writing</b> <b>to</b> you to {{announce}} my return, I cannot say that I take up my pen in good spirits. It {{is not so}} long since I picked up my last letters from England that told me of my father's death. But besides that, I have had a heavy trial to bear, in hearing the dreadful secret, which you all kept from me when it was discovered; and afterwards in parting from Matthew Grice.|$|E
5000|$|Ryder {{has stated}} [...] "I'd <b>been</b> <b>writing</b> a lot since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> maybe eleven years old. I wasn't doing diary entries; I needed to express {{something}} a little deeper than that, which I couldn't express in conversation. And I'd <b>been</b> singing since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a little kid, doing cover songs at gigs. But when I got my guitar, a whole other world opened up to me. I realized I could put the poetry <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> <b>to</b> song and bring two very separate things together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Your eldest niece,' Agnes explained, as Henry {{looked at}} her in amazement. 'The {{children}} used to call me aunt when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> staying with their mother in Ireland, in the autumn. The three girls were my inseparable companions--they are the most charming children <b>I</b> know. It <b>is</b> quite true that <b>I</b> offered to <b>be</b> their governess, if they ever wanted one, on the day when I left them to return <b>to</b> London. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> <b>to</b> propose it to their mother, just before you came.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because the sun shall go {{down upon}} your wrath before I become its messenger. If you choose <b>to</b> <b>write</b> to-day yourself, I cannot help it. I cannot hinder you. If <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>to</b> him {{on your behalf}} I will take my {{instructions}} from you to-morrow morning. When to-morrow morning comes {{you will not be}} angry with me because of the delay." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>writing</b> <b>to</b> express to you my {{sincere and}} heartfelt regret for last night's unfortunate {{incident}}. I {{can do no}} more nor any less than to confess in plain words that I was drunk. It is a humiliating confession, but {{it happens to be}} the truth. Will you accept this apology in the spirit in which it is tendered, and wipe out the whole incident from your memory? I venture to hope and believe that you are sportsman enough to accede to my request.|$|E
6000|$|I have had, {{during the}} last three weeks, such {{numerous}} interruptions of my [...] "uninterrupted rural retirement," [...] such a succession of visitors, both indigenous and exotic, that verily I wanted both the time and composure necessary to answer your letter of the first of June--at present <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>writing</b> <b>to</b> you from my bed. For, in consequence of a very sudden change in the weather from intense heat to a raw and scathing chillness, my bodily health has suffered a relapse as severe as it was unexpected....|$|E
60|$|This extract {{is mostly}} {{taken out of}} the ingenious Dr. Wallis, and lying hid in that little book, which is but rarely inquired after and too {{scarcely}} known, died in a manner with that great man. And as he designed it for the general use of mankind that laboured under the misfortune of losing those two valuable talents of hearing and speaking, I thought it might not be amiss (in the life of so particular a dumb person as <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>writing)</b> <b>to</b> give them this small but particular fragment of grammar and syntax.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have asked}} him. I've sent word by Lopez {{over and over}} again. If he means that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>to</b> him and say that I'm sorry for {{offending}} him, I won't. Don't talk of him any more. It makes me so angry that I sometimes feel inclined to do things which I know I should repent when dying." ...|$|R
5000|$|She wrote, [...] "While {{writing the}} {{manuscript}} of Great Controversy <b>I</b> <b>was</b> often {{conscious of the}} presence of the angels of God.... And many times the scenes about which <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> <b>were</b> presented <b>to</b> me anew in visions of the night, so that they were fresh and vivid in my mind." ...|$|R
5000|$|Paton’s brother-in-law, Lewellys Barker MD, was {{successor}} to Sir William Osler as {{professor of medicine}} at Johns Hopkins. A great friend of Stewart Patons was William Welch MD, who wrote the following letter: “Dear Paton, I thought that I would not embarrass you, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> quite sincere in saying that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> of the opinion that you would make an excellent president of Princeton, and if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>writing</b> <b>to</b> anybody else <b>I</b> should say more on the subject. Very sincerely yours, William H. Welch. November 14, 1910.” ...|$|R
