Fuel-rich and fuel-lean flame with different air factors were analyzed separately. Emission of <b>fuel-rich</b> <b>flame</b> is CO whereas emission of fuel-lean is NOx, and fuel rich-lean ratio {{is the most important}} factor for NOx and CO emission. If <b>fuel-rich</b> <b>flame</b> α 1 is changed with constant fuel-lean flame α 2, NOx emission decreases and CO emission increases evidently. If α 2 is changed with constant α 1, NOx decreases slightly and CO increases initially and then decreases.

40|$|Three-dimensional direct {{numerical}} simulations {{with detailed}} chemistry {{were performed to}} investigate the effect of equivalence ratio on spatial variations of the heat release rate and flame markers of hydrogen/carbon monoxide syngas expanding spherical premixed flames under turbulent conditions at elevated pressures. The flame structures and the heat release rate were analysed and compared between fuel-lean, stoichiometric and fuel-rich centrally ignited spherical flames. The equivalence ratio changes the balance among thermo-diffusive effects, Darrieus-Landau instability and turbulence, leading to different flame dynamics and the heat release rate distribution, despite exhibiting similar cellular and wrinkling flames. The Darrieus-Landau instability is relatively insensitive to the equivalence ratio while the thermo-diffusive process is strongly affected by the equivalence ratio. As the thermo-diffusive effect increases as the equivalence ratio decreases, the fuel-lean flame is more unstable than the <b>fuel-rich</b> <b>flame</b> with the stoichiometric flame in between, under the joint effects of the thermo-diffusive instability and the Darrieus-Landau instability. The local heat release rate and curvature display a positive correlation for the lean flame, no correlation for the stoichiometric flame, and negative correlation for the rich flame. Furthermore, for the fuel-lean flame, the low and high heat release rate values {{are found in the}} negative and positive curvature zones, respectively, while for the <b>fuel-rich</b> <b>flame,</b> the opposite trends are found. It is found that heat release rate markers based on species concentrations vary strongly with changing equivalence ratio.

40|$|With the {{emergence}} of new biorenewable transportation fuels, the role of heteroatoms in combustion has increased tremendously. While petroleum-based fuels are primarily hydrocarbons, many biorenewable fuels contain heteroatoms such as oxygen and nitrogen, introducing new challenges associated with toxic emissions. A fundamental understanding of the chemical kinetics of combustion of these heteroatomic fuels is necessary to elucidate the pathways by which these toxic emissions are formed and may be achieved through the development of combustion models. Reaction sets, the core of these combustion models, may be assembled for individual fuels through a balance of employing vetted rate constants from prior publications, quantum chemistry calculations, and rate constant estimations. For accuracy, reaction sets should be tested against experimental combustion studies such as low-pressure flame experiments using molecular-beam mass spectrometry (MBMS) or chemiluminescence and high-pressure shock-tube experiments. ^ This dissertation presents {{the development of a new}} reaction set to describe gas-phase combustion chemistry of fuels containing only hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen. The foundation of this model was a reaction set to describe combustion of ammonia flames. This reaction set contains only H/N/O chemistry for simplicity. The new reaction set was tested against a pyrolysis shock-tube study, as well as 12 MBMS flame experiments under a variety of conditions, including different mixtures of fuels and oxidizers (NH 3, N 2 O, H 2, NO, O 2), fuel equivalence ratios (lean to rich), pressures, and concentrations of diluent gas. Additionally, the base H/N/O mechanism was expanded to include carbon chemistry and was tested against flames of dimethylamine, ethylamine, and a methane/ammonia mixture. ^ This reaction set was employed to study heterocyclic biofuels including a <b>fuel-rich</b> <b>flame</b> of tetrahydropyran, the monoether analogue to cyclohexane and the basic ring in cellulose.

40|$|It is {{established}} nowadays in combustion {{science and technology}} that every flame can pro-duce particles, even when {{it appears to be}} particle-free. Starting from this assumption, flames are considered no longer only as a reactive flow with internal energy transfer, but also as a reactor for synthesizing gaseous and solid species. Traditional combustion aerosol technology is focused on studying nanosized particulate matter formation during combustion of hydrocarbons, considered as unwanted pollutants, {{in order to understand the}} onset of their formation and minimize their emis-sions. On the other hand, in flame aerosol synthesis nanoparticles are desired products, and the knowledge of their formation is the starting point to set up cheap flame reactors. The main objective of this Ph. D. thesis is the development and control of specific aerosol flame synthesis (AFS) systems for the production and the subsequent characterization of engineered nanomaterials. The work was focused on metal oxides based nanomaterials, carbonaceous nano-materials and carbon-metal oxides nanocomposite. The flame reactors used for the synthesis of carbon nanomaterials were constituted by un-doped flat laminar ethylene/air premixed flame, operated in fuel-rich condition, in which vapor car-bon precursors are given by the unburned fuel. Different carbonaceous particles were produced by changing flame equivalent ratio and particle residence time (i. e, sampling position). Properties of synthesized nanoparticles, such as 2 D/ 3 D character, optical features, chemical structure, electrical behavior and interaction forces, were characterized with respect to the flame reactor characteristics. Regarding the production of metal oxides nanoparticles and carbon-metal oxides nanocom-posites, an Aerosol Flame Synthesis (AFS) system was developed and successfully operated in VAFS mode to produce pure, monodisperse nanoparticles of magnesium oxide and titanium diox-ide, by feeding magnesium and titanium precursors to a fuel-lean hydrocarbon flame reactor.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{is to improve the}} understanding of combustion chemistry by modeling the chemical and physical characteristics of ethylene and allene reacting mixtures {{in a wide variety of}} combustion systems. This is of critical importance for environmental and economic reasons today: formation of air toxics whose emissions are regulated by the U. S. Clean Air Act Amendments, optimization of engines output, and reformulation of fuels, for example. ^ First, a reaction set containing 731 reactions of 85 species was assembled from the literature and theoretical calculations. The mechanism focuses on the C 2 and C 3 hydrocarbons reactions but it also includes heavier species up to C 6 hydrocarbons such as benzene and phenyl. New rate constants for the reactions of the key system C 2 H 3 +O 2 were calculated theoretically and rate constants for the C 3 H 3 recombination reaction were inferred from the recent literature. ^ This reaction set was then used in simulations of shock-tubes, flow reactors and especially flame experiments in various conditions. The predictions obtained throughout the study are generally in good agreement with the experimental data and establishes the overall high-quality of the reaction set. However, in the case of a fuel-lean (2 ̆ 6 phis; = 0. 70) ethylene flame, the predicted profiles of key radicals are not within the experimental uncertainty. The modeling of important reactions involving radicals such as H+O 2 in this environment may still be inaccurate. ^ A novel approach to flat-flame modeling is also introduced. External heat losses by radiation are included in the energy conservation equation for the first time. This improvement of the model allows the temperature profile to be computed in the case of real, non-adiabatic flames. The analysis of the predictions shows that temperature is greatly affected by the presence of soot in fuel-rich flames. In fuel-lean flames, insufficient heat is generated by the mechanism at low temperature. Finally, net heat flux analysis is used to demonstrate the very good agreement of the predictions with data of the <b>fuel-rich</b> <b>flame</b> and quantify the discrepancy in the case of the fuel-lean flame. ...|$|E
40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} are {{a remarkable}} material with many appealing properties. Despite {{the appeal of}} this material, there are few synthesis techniques capable of producing nanotubes in large quantities at low-cost. The broad objective {{of this study was}} to examine the potential of a premixed flame for the synthesis of carbon nanotubes with the view that flame synthesis may prove a means of continuous production at low-cost. The specific approach focused on the formation of metallic nanoparticles in flames; identification of nanotube formation zones, time scales, and transition conditions; characterization of material properties; and the development of a formation mechanism and associated flame-model. Carbon nanotube formation requires a source of carbon, a source of heat and the presence of metal particles. A <b>fuel-rich</b> <b>flame</b> is a high-temperature, carbon-rich environment and addition of metal is likely to give conditions suitable for nanotube growth. This study considered a premixed acetylene/oxygen/ 15 mol% argon flame doped with iron pentacarbonyl (Fe(CO) ₅) vapor (typically 6100 ppm), operated at 50 Torr pressure and 30 cm/s cold gas feed velocity. The flame was investigated with regard to the growth of metal particles and subsequent formation and growth of carbon nanotubes. Thermophoretic samples were extracted from the flame at various heights above burner (HAB) and analyzed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). HAB is representative of residence time in the flame. Size distribution and number density data were extracted from TEM images using a quantitative image analysis technique. The mean particle size for a precursor concentration of 6100 ppm was observed to increase from around 2 to 4 nm between 20 and 75 mm HAB. (cont.) The particle number density results showed a decreasing number density with increasing HAB, giving a complementary picture of the particle dynamics in the flame. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) were also observed to form in the premixed flame. Thermophoretic sampling and TEM analysis gave insight into nanotube formation dynamics. Nanotube structures were observed to form as early as 30 mm HAB (20 ms) with growth proceeding rapidly within the next 10 to 20 mm HAB. The growth-rate for the nanotubes in this interval is estimated to be between 10 and 100 ptm per second. The upper region of the flame (50 to 70 mm HAB; 35 to 53 ms) is dominated by tangled web structures formed via the coalescence of individual nanotubes formed earlier in the flame. The nanotube structures are exclusively single-walled with no multi-walled nanotubes observed in any of the flame samples. The effect of carbon availability on nanotube formation was tested by collecting samples over a range of fuel equivalence ratios at fixed HAB. The morphology of the collected material revealed a nanotube formation 'window' of 1. 5 < < 1. 9, with lower dominated by discrete particles and higher favoring soot-like structures. These results were also verified using Raman spectroscopy. A clear trend of improved nanotube quality (number and length of nanotubes) is observed at lower.

To achieve significant emissions reduction, more insight is needed into the mechanisms of NO formation. Martijn van Essen’s thesis provides insight into the effects of two NOx control strategies, flue-gas recirculation (FGR) and burner stabilization, on NO formation. Since many combustion systems operate under fuel-rich (oxygen deficient) conditions, the focus of the thesis was on <b>fuel-rich</b> premixed methane-air <b>flames.</b> The experiments were performed at reduced pressures, to facilitate the measurements of the distributions of temperature and concentrations of key species (CH, OH and NO) using the optical technique laser-induced fluorescence (LIF).

In the present study we found that SRgas was a good index to consider the gas phase reaction mechanism in <b>fuel-rich</b> pulverized coal <b>flames.</b> When SRgas < 1. 0, NOx concentration was strongly influenced by the SRgas value. NOx concentration was also calculated by using a reaction model. The model was verified for various coals, particle diameters, reaction times, and initial oxygen concentrations. The most important reactions were gas phase NOx reduction reactions by hydrocarbons. The hydrocarbon concentration was estimated based on SRgas. We also investigated the ratio as an index to develop a new low-NOx combustion technology for pulverized coals. We examined the relation between local SRgas distribution in the fuel-rich region in the low-NOx flame and NOx emissions at the furnace exit, by varying burner structures. The relationship between local SRgas value and local NOx concentration was also examined. When a low-NOx type burner was used, the value of SRgas in the flame was readily decreased. When the local SRgas value was the same, it was difficult to influence the local NOx concentration by changing the burner structure.

40|$|UnrestrictedSoot {{formed from}} {{incomplete}} combustion has significant health effects {{and contributes to}} atmospheric pollution. The details of soot nucleation and growth have been studied experimentally and numerically and recent advances in experimental techniques have enabled the investigation of soot particles in the size range of 1 to 10 nm. This range is particularly interesting as soot nucleation occurs {{at the lower end}} of this range and mass growth is fast within this range.; This work utilizes a variety of complimentary experimental techniques to probe soot nucleation and growth from premixed lightly sooting flat flames. A scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) in conjunction with probe sampling is used to study detailed particle size distributions, soot volume fraction and number density. Soot volume fraction is also measured using a thermocouple particle densitometry technique. Soot morphology is investigated using transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. For the ethylene-oxygen-argon flames studied, the particle size distributions are bimodal. The trough of this bimodal distribution shifts gradually to smaller sizes as the flame temperature is increased resulting in an apparent unimodal size distribution. Morphology studies show that nascent particles are spherical and not fully carbonized.; A standard SMPS system is modified to extend the lower size detection limit from 2. 5 nm to 1. 6 nm. Using this lower detection limit the particle distributions at high flame temperatures are observed to be persistently bimodal and the apparent unimodality previously seen is concluded to be due to instrumentation limitation. In addition, the ethylene flames are doped with benzene to examine the effect of nucleation rate variation on nascent soot size distribution. The size distributions for benzene doped flames are similar to that of pure ethylene flames yet further study needs to be done to decouple the influence of flame temperature resulting from benzene doping on the evolution of the size distributions.; An inherent challenge of probe sampling is that it is intrusive and the effect of probe perturbation needs to be quantified. To address this issue, a burner stabilized stagnation flow sampling technique is developed and fully characterized. The key advantage of this technique is that the flame can be modeled as the flow field and boundary conditions are known. The size distributions measured by this technique are similar to that observed with tubular probe sampling with the onset of the second size mode occurring at somewhat short residence times.; Using the new sampling technique developed, n-dodecane sooting flames are investigated. This liquid fuel is of particular interest as it is an ideal surrogate component for real jet fuels. The size distributions for these flames show a bimodal characteristic and the nucleation mode for n-dodecane flames is stronger compared to similar ethylene flames. The measured and simulated temperature profiles show good agreement. The modified sampling probe and development of a liquid fuel system makes this configuration ideal for studying soot formation for a broad range of conditions and fuels.; The nature of nano-organic carbon (transparent soot) in non-sooting rich ethylene-air flames is studied. Experiments are performed to allow nanoparticles with particle diameter around 2 nm to coagulate and deposit on larger substrate particles that can easily be detected by a standard SMPS.

40|$|The main {{research}} {{area of the}} PhD thesis refers to the actual and global problem of ecology, related to the gradually increasing pollution of the Earth's atmosphere by the greenhouse emissions. These emissions form during the combustion of the fossil fuels (CO_ 2, CH_ 4, NO_x) and lead to the global warming of the Earth's surface and surrounding atmosphere, thus initiating the climate changes. With the aim to solve this problem, this thesis investigates the ways to restrict {{the formation of the}} greenhouse emissions during the fuel combustion. As an effective tool to reduce the carbon emissions, the method of thermal decarbonization of the fossil fuel is applied, using the electric control of fuel decarbonization. The theoretical analysis of the mechanism of the electric field and flame interaction allows to conclude that the electrical force drives the ion (C_ 2 H_ 4 "+, C_ 3 H_ 3 "+, CHO"+, O"-_ 2, etc.) drift motion in the field direction by initiating the interrelated processes of heat and mass transfer, which could vary the flame temperature and composition fields. The results of experimental studies show that the electric field effect on the fuel combustion, fuel decarbonization, soot formation, carbon capture and sequestration can be used to reduce the levels of greenhouse emissions from the flame. For example, reduces the levels of CO_ 2 emissions in the pollutants are 10 - 15 %, but NO_x#approx# 25 %. The electrical processing of the soot formation and carbon sequestration from propane combustion are studied too for the conditions of the incomplete mixing of the axial fuel flow with the swirling airflow at the burner outlet, providing the stage combustion along the swirling flame channel flow. The swirling flame flow has a relative cold central core with a hot reaction zone forming an envelope between the fuel rich flame core and the surrounding swirling air co-flow. Experimentally it is observed that the air swirl motion under certain conditions promotes the stable stratification of the flame temperature and composition fields with an intensive and lasting propane pyrolysis along the <b>fuel-rich</b> <b>flame</b> core, thus enhancing the nucleation of the primary soot precursors and the formation of soot nanoparticles. The measurements of the flame temperature profiles show that the processes of propane decomposition, nucleation of soot precursors and soot growth along the flame channel flow are developing at the presence of the relatively high radial temperature gradients in the flame core. The radial temperature gradients along the flame core initiate the thermodiffusion of soot precursors and thermophoretic transport of soot nanoparticles to the steel rod surface that is arranged along the centerline of the swirl flame core, thus reducing the levels of greenhouse emissions (CO_ 2) in the products. The more effective soot formation and carbon sequestration from the swirling flame is achieved using the radial electric field control of the swirling flame. These soot nanoparticles produced by the thermal decomposition of hydrocarbons could be further used in chemical industry as reaction catalysts or coloring in the production of the paints for laser printers and copying machines. Besides, the chemically-active carbon nanoparticles could be used for high-efficient energy production in electrochemical fuel cells.

40|$|Carbon {{materials}} {{in all its}} forms, from the natural carbon solid materials, as coal and graphite, to the synthesized carbon materials, as carbon black, pitch fibers, fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, etc,. have been object of many studies regarding their characteristics and behaviour due to their importance in the energy and industrial sectors. Recently, {{most of the research}} efforts have been focused on the synthesis of new carbon materials and in particular on their physico-chemical properties which are very variable {{as a function of the}} production process. Arc discharge and laser ablation methods, chemical vapour deposition, pyrolysis and flame synthesis are the processes mostly used for production of special carbon materials as fullerenes, nanotubes, graphene, etc., whose structures are relatively simple and fairly well known. By contrast, traditional high-temperature pyrolytic and combustion processes in very fuel-rich conditions of gaseous, liquid, and solid fuels also produce a carbon material, namely soot, that is important when the enhancement of radiative transfer is required, but undesired for the pollutant effect. A special form of soot is carbon black that is an industrially-manufactured product used as filler in rubber products and as a component in ink for printers. Soot and related high mass aromatic species, as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, constitute as a whole the carbon particulate matter, in form of particles and aggregates, that can be produced starting from organic precursors, generally hydrocarbons, in high temperature partially oxidative conditions (fuel-rich) typical of combustion processes. Soot exhibits a mixed ordered/disordered character having a nano-structure mainly based on two-dimensional graphene layers grouped, cross-linked and/or layered each other in a disordered (turbostratic) way. The degree of order/disorder depends on the process temperature and fuel source. This PhD thesis is focused on the study of the structural characteristics of carbon particulate matter, synthesized in the well-controlled combustion conditions of a premixed <b>fuel-rich</b> <b>flame,</b> where it is possible to study the parameters affecting their formation and, consequently, controlling their features. In this context the main objectives of this thesis are: i) to explore the diagnostic potentialities of fast and non-destructive spectroscopic tools for carbon characterization, ii) to get a deeper understanding of the formation mechanism of carbon {{materials in}} flames with the perspective of controlling and modulating the properties of carbon materials obtained. Structural characterization of carbon materials at a nanoscale implies the determination of three key parameters that determine their structure and properties: the fraction of sp 2 -bonded carbon sites, the hydrogen content and the ordering and clustering of sp 2 sites. Various characterization methods have been developed and implemented to determine these structural parameters. Among them, the use of optical features have been in deeper investigated and focused on the upgrade and the exploitation of the diagnostic potentiality of spectroscopic tools. In particular UV-Visible, FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy, have been developed for the quantitative and qualitative characterization of flame-derived carbon soot materials and their related micro- and nano-structure. A reconstruction method of UV-Visible spectra has been developed as diagnostic tool discriminating the contribution and the spectral features of different molecular weight aromatic species to the spectral properties of carbonaceous species formed in flame. A detailed procedure for the quantitative FT-IR analysis of aromatic and aliphatic hydrogen has been set up by using different standard aromatic and aliphatic species and implemented on hydrogen-rich and hydrogen-poor carbon materials. Regarding Raman spectroscopy, there are no multiwavelength Raman data for flame formed soot. Part of this work was devoted to fill this gap by providing Raman spectra at different excitation energies and exploiting the resonant Raman process as a powerful mean for soot structural and electronic characterization. On the basis of the experimental results obtained, relationships between synthesis/combustion conditions and specific carbon properties, such as size distribution, chemical composition, optical properties and internal structural organization, have been found. This has led to give further insights on the carbonaceous species formation mechanism into a flame environment...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{experimental}} {{study on the}} heat transfer optimization of an Innovative Inverse Diffusion Flame (IDF) characterized by a central air jet surrounded by an array of fuel jets for impingement heating. It is found that the diameter ratio between air port and fuel port (da/df) exerts significant influence on the impingement heat transfer performance via changing the hydrodynamics and the thermal structure of the IDF. The effects of the overall equivalence ratio (Φ), the burner-to-plate distance (H), and the air jet Reynolds number (Rea), on the local and average heat fluxes, are investigated and compared between IDFs with different da. Under the same air flow rate (Q̇a) and fuel flow rate (Q̇f), {{it is found that}} the IDF jet with smaller da produces higher maximum heat flux (qmax') and average heat flux in the impingement region (qmacr), due to the increased flame temperature (Tf) and turbulence level under larger Rea. <b>Fuel-rich</b> <b>flames</b> produce low fuel utilization efficiency and low heat flux and should be avoided in the practical applications. Fuel-lean condition in the range of Φ = 0. 9 to Φ = 1. 1 is found to be a desirable operation condition for its high heat flux and fuel efficiency. The current study provides valuable information on the heat transfer optimization of this innovative port-array IDF. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study has been}} performed to determine the heat transfer characteristics of round and slot premixed butane/air flame jets, which were impinging upwards normally on a horizontal rectangular plate. Effect of the burner geometry on the heat transfer coefficient at the jet/plate interface, with the variation of Reynolds number and air/fuel equivalence ratio, has been examined. Round and slot burner nozzles with the same cross-sectional area were tested at a constant nozzle-to-plate distance of 2 d. The Reynolds number was selected to range from 1, 000 to 1, 700, {{in order to produce}} a laminar flow. The air/fuel equivalence ratio was extended from 0. 95 to 1. 3 to produce fuel-lean, stoichiometric, and <b>fuel-rich</b> <b>flames.</b> When compared to the round jet, the slot jet provided more uniform heat flux on the impingement plate, but the peak heat flux was not so concentrated. The slot jet produced different heat flux distributions along the length and width of the impingement plate, and the average heat flux was higher along the direction of the slot width (i. e., the plate width) in the present study, especially when the Reynolds number or the equivalence ratio was increased. The present study provides more information and a comparison between the heat transfer characteristics of round and slot premixed impinging flame jets utilizing a butane/air mixture. Such reports have rarely been reported in the literature. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (P AH) and soot are formed when a hydrocarbon fuel is oxidized under fuel-rich conditions. The distinction between {{what constitutes the}} largest P AH molecule and the smallest soot particle is arbitrary; the formation processes of both can be placed {{under the heading of}} molecular weight growth. Evidence exists for the carcinogenicity of many P AH molecules. Soot is used as a component of dyes and as an additive to rubbers as well as being an undesirable atmospheric pollutant. Both are emitted from many typical combustion processes such as diesel engines, wood fires, furnaces, etc. Though the area has received much attention, the fundamental chemical mechanisms for formation of both P AH and soot are still uncertain. Much debate has centered on the identity of the soot surface growth reactant, in particular whether the dominant surface growth reactant is P AH or acetylene. Though several models of soot formation exist, none has demonstrated through comparison to experimental data a thorough knowledge of the fundamental chemical processes of soot formation. The goal of this research was to further the understanding of these fundamental chemical processes. Since the chemistry of P AH and soot are intertwined, PAH was a necessary subcomponent of the soot formation research. The research was accomplished by obtaining soot particle size distribution data for the jet-stirred reactor/ plug-flow reactor (JSR/PFR), development of kinetics modeling methods, {{and the development of a}} kinetics model of soot formation. The JSR/PFR has been used extensively in the past to investigate P AH and soot formation, providing much data for concentrations of light-gas species, P AH, and soot under various conditions of equivalence ratio, temperature, and PFR additives. No experimental data have been obtained for soot particle size distribution in the JSR/PFR, so a study was undertaken here to obtain the soot particle size distributions for two conditions previously studied by Marr, premixed atmospheric ethylene combustion at equivalence ratio 2. 2 and temperatures of 1520 K and 1620 K. Thermophoretic sampling was used to obtain soot samples for transmission electron micrograph analysis. Software was written and used to obtain soot particle sizes from electron micrographs. The chemical environment in a <b>fuel-rich</b> <b>flame</b> consists of many hundreds of species and thousands of chemical reactions. To isolate particular portions of the chemistry, a calculational technique was developed, data incorporation, that replaces chosen portions of the chemistry in kinetics models with functions of data concentrations. This technique was then used to isolate the process of P AH molecular weight growth and soot nucleation through the use of a discrete sectional model, and rate coefficients for hydrogen-atom abstraction, acetylene-addition, and PAH radical addition to PAH were obtained by comparisons to data from Marr for the 1620 K condition described above and the same condition with naphthalene injection into the PFR. The data incorporation technique was then used to expand the discrete sectional model to include sections describing soot, and the experimental soot size distribution data described above was used with previously available PFR data to obtain values for rate coefficients of PAHaddition to soot and coagulation of soot particles. Five PFR conditions were used to develop the soot formation model in these calculations, and the dominant mechanisms of soot formation present under these conditions appear to be present in the model. Quantitative agreement is obtained to all of the available data, including simultaneous agreement of soot mass and particle size, without significant deviation in the rate coefficients required to obtain agreement. Calculations were performed using both PAH and acetylene as the dominant soot surface growth reactant. It was found that P AH had far more consistent rate coefficient values (constant to within a factor of 4) than acetylene (constant to within a factor of 59) to describe the data for all of the conditions. An analysis of the above five sets of conditions in the PFR, an additional three for the PFR, and three for premixed one-dimensional flames of acetylene, ethylene, and benzene, for which concentrations of acetylene, P AH. and soot, and in the case of the one-dimensional flames, soot particle size data, were available, were analyzed with the aim of understanding the dominant characteristics of the soot surface growth reactant. Soot mass growth rates were calculated for all of the conditions, and deviate markedly between the PFR and one-dimensional flames. Soot growth rate increases and oscillates in the PFR and sharply declines in the one-dimensional flames in the region of soot growth after initial particle inception. Under all of these conditions, PAH show the characteristics required of the dominant surface growth reactant: increases and oscillations in the PFR and sharp declines in the one-dimensional flames. For acetylene to be the dominant surface growth reactant, anomalous behavior of acetylene-suot reactivity would be required that cannot be explained by soot aging or radical intermediates. This leads to the observation that the long-held notion of declining soot reactivity in premixed one-dimensional flames similar to the ones studied here is a result of variations in the PAH intermediates and not a real phenomenon in the region after soot particle inception. An approximate method of uncertainty analysis of kinetics models was used to place an uncertainty bound of a factor of 3 on the rate coefficient parameters calculated. The approximate method was compared to more precise techniques and used to show that the uncertainty of concentration predictions with PAH kinetics models is of very large magnitude. The approximate uncertainty analysis technique was also used to show that the data incorporation technique reduces the uncertainty in calculated rate parameters by over two orders of magnitude. A kinetics model reduction algorithm was developed and implemented to reduce a PAH kinetics model fro. n 722 reactions and 187 species to 93 reactions and 52 species, maintaining naphthalene conc 1;;ntration to within 9 % of the original model. This technique was also used by Dinaro to redm:e a benzene oxidation model from 545 to 41 reactions for use in super-critical water oxidation applications. by David Franklin Kronholm. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a systematic computational {{study of the}} inhibition of premixed flames of short chain hydrocarbons with CF 3 I, focusing on sensitivity analysis of the (normalized) burning velocity and reaction pathway analysis using the "iodine-flux" approach. A comprehensive kinetic mechanism was obtained by combining the GRI, hydrofluorocarbon and CF 3 I sub-mechanisms, and updating the rates {{of some of the}} elementary reactions. Calculations were performed using the PREMIX computer code in the CHEMKIN suite of computer codes. The updated mechanism yielded estimates of the normalized laminar burning velocities which concurs closely with published measurements. The sensitivity analysis resulted in a positive coefficient for CF 3 I + M → CF 3 + I + M, confirming the promoting effect of CF 3 I on the laminar flame velocity and is consistent with previous studies. Reaction pathways were drawn for stoichiometric, fuel-lean and <b>fuel-rich</b> <b>flames</b> doped with 1 and 2 % of CF 3 I at atmospheric pressure. The reaction pathway analysis served to identify four major inhibition cycles, denoted as HI → I → HI, HI → I → I 2 → HI, HI → I → CH 3 I → HI and HI → I → C 2 H 5 I → HI. Furthermore, the paper developed a linear expression linking the normalized rate of heat release with the ratio of laminar burning velocities of mitigated and non-mitigated flames, and verified the efficacy of this expression for flames inhibited with CF 3 I...|$|R
40|$|Laminar methane/air {{premixed}} flames {{at different}} pressures {{in a newly}} developed high-pressure Bunsen flame rig are studied using detailed numerical simulations and laser diagnostics. In the numerical simulations, one-dimensional and two-dimensional axisymmetric configurations were considered employing detailed transport properties and chemical kinetic mechanisms. In the measurements, OH PLIF was employed. The aims are to improved {{the understanding of the}} structures of the flames at varying pressures, to measure the laminar flame speed at different pressures, and to quantify the accuracy of the Bunsen flame method for measurement of laminar flame speed at different pressures. The stoichiometric and <b>fuel-rich</b> <b>flames</b> were found to exhibit a two-reaction-zone structure: an inner premixed flame in which the fuel was converted to CO and H 2, and an outer diffusion flame in which CO and H 2 were oxidized further to form combustion products. With increasing pressure, the inner premixed flame becomes thinner and the flame as a whole has the tendency to become unstable. Using the numerical and the experimental data, the methods of flame-cone-angle and flame-area were used to extract the laminar flame speed for different equivalence ratios and pressures. The flame-cone-angle method showed slightly better accuracy than the flame-area method did. The accuracy of both methods became lower under high pressure conditions. The inlet velocity of the burner was shown to affect the accuracy of the extracted laminar flame speed. For a stoichiometric atmospheric flame {{it was found that the}} most suitable inlet velocity for the fuel/air mixture was about 6 times the laminar flame speed, yielding a flame length about 7 times the radius of the burner. With appropriate flame length, the mid-height of the flame showed a rather low flame stretch rate, the laminar flame speed being in close agreement with the unstretched laminar flame speed, the error being less than 6 % for the flames that were studied...|$|R
