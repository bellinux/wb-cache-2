40|$|Heat-aging {{studies were}} {{conducted}} on <b>fluororubber</b> (copolymers of vinylidene fluoride and perfluoropropylene) using N,N-dicinnamylidene- 1, 6 -hexanediamine, a Schiff's base of 1, 6 -hexanediamine, and MgO as acid acceptor. The principal technique employed was chemical stress relaxation for determining network changes brought about in the heat-aged <b>fluororubber.</b> This technique was backed up by swelling measurements, gel permeation chromatography, and IR spectroscopy. Stress relaxation curves are plotted {{for a wide range}} of variation in parameters (time, crosslinking density, state of curing, temperature, intermittent and continuous relaxation) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. To study {{effects of}} binders on storage {{stability}} of the silicon delay composition, sample B and C 1 were prepared separately by adding shellac and fluororubber(FPM 2602) in basic formula A, and sample C 2 and C 3 were prepared by changing adding amounts and modes of <b>fluororubber</b> respectively. On conditions of 71 ℃ and 92 % humidity variation rule of burning rate and delay precision varying with time was studied. The results indicate that binders have function of “heat sink”, and reduce burning rate and delay precision of the delay composition, especially the effects of shellac are obvious. Under two kinds of storage conditions, sample B adding with shellac can obviously improve agents influenced by temperature and humidity. Increasing <b>fluororubber</b> contents the delay composition can also be improved influenced by temperature and humidity. Binders at constant amounts, <b>fluororubber</b> solution in adding directly to the composition in mixing process can improve the delay precision...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Several {{kinds of}} rubbers used for fabric {{expansion}} joints were studied by Thermogravimetric analysis under inert atmosphere {{before and after}} artificial accelerated thermal aging. The results showed {{that because of the}} difference of the chemical structures, the rubber aging is different. And the thermal stability of Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) was obviously higher than that of other two kinds of rubbers, ethylene-propylene-diene-terpolymer rubber (EPDM) and <b>fluororubber...</b>|$|E
30|$|The {{chemical}} absorption process, using amine solutions, is a commercialized {{technology and}} {{has been used in}} natural gas industry for 60  years. It is regarded as a mature process. The most commonly used solvent is monoethanolamine (MEA). Many studies have been reported about CO 2 capture from an existing coal-fired power plant using chemical absorption method based on MEA (Singh et al. 2003; Alie et al. 2005; Aroonwilas and Veawab 2007; Rubin et al. 2007; Abu-Zahra et al. 2007). They all have indicated that CO 2 capture using MEA is the only feasible option in the short term for flue gases with low concentration CO 2. Therefore, in this study, random packed columns and ordinary carbon steel are used to act as the absorber and stripper with anticorrosive <b>fluororubbers</b> and stainless steel internals. Furthermore, 20  wt% MEA is selected to absorb CO 2, and the CO 2 loadings of lean and rich solution are, respectively, set to 0.20  mol-CO 2 /mol-MEA and 0.45  mol-CO 2 /mol-MEA (Alie et al. 2005). An absorption temperature of 40  °C is used and the average pressure is around 0.01  MPa. The regeneration temperature is 110  °C and pressure is 0.025  MPa. Therefore, based on these operating conditions, the size of absorber and stripper needed can be determined using the model provided by Abu-Zahra et al. (2007).|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of rotation and superposed axial {{movement on the}} sealing behaviour of rotary shaft <b>fluororubber</b> seals has been experimentally tested with special regard to the conveying behaviour, friction, tightness and wear resistance. From the results it is concluded that in the most application cases no negative {{influence of}} the axial movement on the sealing behaviour is to be expected.

40|$|Improved energy {{efficiency}} and durability are demanded for sealing components in multiple industries. Flat elastomer plates were coated with a polymeric film (SiOxCyHz) in a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition process. The film thickness was varied from approximately 0. 7 µm to 4. 0 µm. Tribological lifetime tests were performed {{as a function of}} the applied film thickness. The investigated elastomeric substrate materials were acrylic rubber, <b>fluororubber</b> and nitrite butadiene rubber. Oscillating ball-on-plate contact was chosen to induce rapid wear. Significant wear protection was found to depend on applied load and elastomer type. Film thicknesses in the range of 1 µm to 2. 5 µm were recommended...|$|E
