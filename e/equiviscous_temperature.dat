40|$|In 1999, the Canadian Roofing Contractors' Association (CRCA) {{initiated}} {{a study to}} compare the quality and performance properties of bulk asphalt from various suppliers/manufacturers across Canada. The study was prompted by concerns raised by contractor members {{about the quality of}} bulk asphalt and, in particular, fallback (softening point drop back) after heating the asphalt during built-up roofing (BUR) applications. The study consisted of a quantitative analysis of changes to the physical properties of asphalt samples, including <b>equiviscous</b> <b>temperature</b> (EVT), after heating and assessment {{of the quality of the}} information provided to roofing contractors by asphalt suppliers/manufacturers regarding their recommended EVTs. The issue of the quality of EVT information is discussed in Appendix A of this paper. The concept of EVT is widely accepted as a quality control instrument in the application of BUR systems. The study was designed to assess the effectiveness of the concept as currently applied in the field...|$|E
40|$|Although foamed bitumen {{has been}} widely applied in {{pavement}} construction some of its aspects are still not yet understood. In this study, some of these aspects including: effects of the foaming process on binder chemistry, characterization of foamed bitumen and development of a rational method to optimize foam characteristics, evaluation of aggregate particle coating within foamed bitumen treated materials, and development of a gyratory compaction procedure for laterite gravels treated with foamed bitumen were addressed. The effects of the foaming process on bitumen chemistry were investigated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy techniques. Also, foam characteristics of three binders were established and a rational method to optimize foam characteristics proposed. Aggregate particle coating with foamed bitumen was studied using the concepts of surface energy and Rice density. In addition a gyratory laboratory compaction procedure for laterite gravels treated with foamed bitumen was established using the modified locking concept. Infrared techniques have shown that foaming does not cause any changes in the binder chemistry, suggesting that foaming may be a physical process. Further, foam characteristics are greatly influenced by binder viscosity. Also, the <b>equiviscous</b> <b>temperature</b> seems to produce foam with optimum foam characteristics. Rice density results showed that aggregate size fraction, binder expansion ratio and viscosity influenced aggregate particle coating. Surface energy results revealed that foamed bitumen exhibited better coating attributes than neat bitumen. A new compaction procedure for laterite gravels treated with foamed bitumen based on the modified locking point was developed. QC 2011042...|$|E
40|$|Project {{conducted}} {{in cooperation with}} the Federal Highway Administration. According to Superpave mixture design, gyratory specimens are mixed and compacted at <b>equiviscous</b> binder <b>temperatures</b> corresponding to viscosities of 0. 17 and 0. 28 Paxs, respectively. These were the values previously used in the Marshal mix design method to determine the mixing and compaction temperatures. In order to estimate the appropriate mixing and compaction temperatures for Superpave mixture design, a temperatureviscosity relationship for the binder should be developed (ASTM D 2493, Calculation of Mixing and Compaction Temperatures). This approach is simple and provides reasonable temperatures for unmodified binders. However, some modified binders have exhibited unreasonably high temperatures for mixing and compaction using this technique. These high temperatures could result in construction problems, asphalt damage, and fume production. ASTM D 2493 was established for unmodified asphalt binders, which are Newtonian fluids at high temperatures. For these materials, viscosity does not depend on shear rate. However, most of the modified asphalt binders exhibit a phenomenon known as pseudoplasticity, in which viscosity depends on shear rate. Thus, at the high shear rates that occur during mixing and compaction, {{it is not necessary to}} use very high temperatures. A research study was undertaken to determine the shear rate during compaction so that the effect of this parameter could b...|$|R
