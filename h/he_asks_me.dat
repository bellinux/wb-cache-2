2500|$|Walter {{presents}} {{me with a}} page {{of notes}} he's prepared for a new script. [...] It {{will be the first}} in a series of adventures of an action hero he's had it in his mind to create for a long time. [...] The character's name is Tom Cody. [...] And Walter has it in his head to create a franchise about him...introducing him as The Stranger.

[...] Suits me.|$|E
6000|$|... "'When <b>he</b> <b>asks</b> <b>me,</b> I will sing--if I {{feel like}} it.' And she shrugged her {{shoulders}} with a provoking gesture of indifference.|$|E

60|$|<b>He's</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> {{to be his}} wife. And on Thursday I shall {{give him}} an answer.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{will go to}} Jericho if <b>he</b> <b>asks</b> <b>me,</b> {{only you}} will have to go with me." [...] "I thought we were to go to,--Belgium," [...] said Violet.|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot sit {{and hear}} it. And what am I {{to say when}} <b>he</b> <b>asks</b> <b>me</b> a {{question}} as he did just now? He said that you had confessed." ...|$|E
60|$|FAITH. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> to be {{a friend}} to him. He said he was lonely here.|$|R
5000|$|... kérte, hogy menjek. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> that I go. (<b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> to go.) Here, [...] "I go" [...] {{is in the}} subjunctive.|$|R
2500|$|If <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> {{what was}} my second wish, I would again answer, [...] "My country's independence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{goes a long}} way," [...] Maraton {{reminded}} her, [...] "when <b>he</b> <b>asks</b> <b>me</b> to his home; invites me--well, {{why should}} I not say it?--invites me to join his party." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>he</b> <b>asks</b> <b>me</b> to go somewhere, {{will you}} tease mamma? She always lets you, Imogene, {{and it seems}} {{sometimes}} as if she just took a pleasure in denying me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You've just come? It's rather odd. He's unavoidably detained. <b>He</b> <b>asks</b> <b>me</b> in {{this note}} to lead off with dinner at seven if he's not back. Says he'll explain when he comes.' ...|$|E
5000|$|... … <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> if I {{were about}} to return to London …(Mary Shelley, The Last Man, 1833) ...|$|R
60|$|And then <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> whether, {{as things}} had turned out, I myself {{had been so}} {{especially}} happy.|$|R

6000|$|... "Hark at him, citizens! <b>He</b> <b>asks</b> <b>me</b> {{what is our}} business. Oh, citizen Bibot, {{since when}} have you become blind? A dolt you've always been, else you had not asked the question." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} {{shall not}} tell you a lie. Mr. Dalrymple has asked me to be his wife, and I have made him no answer. If <b>he</b> <b>asks</b> <b>me</b> again I shall accept him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And then <b>he</b> <b>asks</b> <b>me</b> who I {{was working}} for, and I shows him Rancho Chiquito, two miles away, {{in the shadow}} of a low hill, and he tells me he's a deputy sheriff.|$|E
60|$|When I left him, <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> where I was quartered, {{and said}} he hoped I would be comfortable.|$|R
60|$|HASTINGS. His Grace will be {{with you}} presently. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> to deal with the {{business}} matter first of all.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> as {{the subject}} arose in his mind, in his graceful, light-hearted manner and without the least embarrassment.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; I did. Was I not right? Ought I {{to go to}} him {{to bring}} a disgrace upon all the family, just because he is so good that <b>he</b> <b>asks</b> <b>me?</b> Shall I injure him {{because he wants to}} do me a service?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then you see, if {{that was}} the case, it seemed to me I might {{represent}} it, quiet so to say, to the 'Ead when <b>he</b> <b>asks</b> <b>me</b> about it. I've got to take 'im the charges to-night, an'--it looks bad on the face of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because it is best. Nothing more {{is settled}} than was settled before. When <b>he</b> <b>asks</b> <b>me</b> whether he may come again, how can I {{say that he}} may not? What can I say, except that as far I can see now, I cannot be his wife?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> what I read, {{and when}} I had told him, a thin smile fluttered across his white face.|$|R
5000|$|Romita later elaborated: Stan {{showed me}} Dick Ayers' splash page for a Daredevil. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me,</b> [...] "What {{would you do}} with this page?" [...] I showed him on a tracing paper what I would do, and then <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> to do a drawing of Daredevil the way I would do it. I did a big drawing of Daredevil ... just a big, tracing-paper drawing of Daredevil swinging. And Stan loved it.|$|R
6000|$|... "The Inspector <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> why I had {{run away}} when the other constable wanted to take me in charge. I replied {{that it was because}} I did not desire to spend my Christmas {{holidays}} in the lock-up, which he evidently regarded as a singularly weak argument. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> what I had thrown into the canal. I told him a goose. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> why I had thrown a goose into the canal. I told him because I was sick and tired of the animal.|$|R
6000|$|Devine smiled. [...] "I'm {{not sure}} we'll go at all. It {{seems to me}} Brooke means to give the thing a private trial before <b>he</b> <b>asks</b> <b>me</b> {{to come over and}} see it work, and that's why he waited until it was almost dark. Can you make him out, Barbara?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cyril Chrysostom {{represents}} the authorities. If <b>he</b> <b>asks</b> <b>me</b> to speak, I will speak." [...] Cyril nodded {{at me with}} a smile, and I went on. [...] "It is a very simple matter. In Altruria everybody works with his hands three hours a day. After that he works or not, as he likes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “What’s this?” he exclaimed, {{examining}} Clay’s envelope, {{which had}} just been handed to him. “I have no acquaintances in Vancouver who use expensive stationery.” He read the note and then looked up with a surprised frown. “It’s from Clay! <b>He</b> <b>asks</b> <b>me</b> to meet him in the smoking-room of his hotel. It’s the big, smart place they’ve lately opened.” ...|$|E
60|$|The {{explanation}} satisfied {{him on that}} point, {{and being}} satisfied, <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> when I had left Pesaro. A moment I hesitated.|$|R
60|$|COMTESSE. Do I know him! The {{last time}} I saw him <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> to--to-- hem!--ma cherie, it was thirty years ago.|$|R
6000|$|My uncle said he {{was very}} sorry he had forgotten. He said he {{believed}} in the old saying: [...] "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy." [...] <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> where I was going and, when I had told him a second time <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> did I know The Arab's Farewell to his Steed. When I left the kitchen {{he was about to}} recite the opening lines of the piece to my aunt.|$|R
