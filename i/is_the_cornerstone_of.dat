Corn was used to make all kinds of dishes, from the familiar cornbread and grits, to liquors such as moonshine and whiskey (which is still important to the Southern economy).|$|E

25|$|Epidemiology is {{the study}} and {{analysis}} of the patterns, causes, and effects of health and disease conditions in defined populations. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cornerstone</b> <b>of</b> public health, and shapes policy decisions and evidence-based practice by identifying risk factors for disease and targets for preventive healthcare. Epidemiologists help with study design, collection, and statistical analysis of data, amend interpretation and dissemination of results (including peer review and occasional systematic review). Epidemiology has helped develop methodology used in clinical research, public health studies, and, to a lesser extent, basic research in the biological sciences.|$|E
25|$|Fibre Channel (FC) is a {{successor}} to parallel SCSI interface on enterprise market. It is a serial protocol. In disk drives usually the Fibre Channel Arbitrated Loop (FC-AL) connection topology is used. FC has much broader usage than mere disk interfaces, and it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cornerstone</b> <b>of</b> storage area networks (SANs). Recently other protocols for this field, like iSCSI and ATA over Ethernet have been developed as well. Confusingly, drives usually use copper twisted-pair cables for Fibre Channel, not fibre optics. The latter are traditionally reserved for larger devices, such as servers or disk array controllers.|$|E

25|$|Cisplatin {{combination}} chemotherapy <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cornerstone</b> <b>of</b> {{treatment of}} many cancers. Initial platinum responsiveness is high {{but the majority}} of cancer patients will eventually relapse with cisplatin-resistant disease. Many mechanisms of cisplatin resistance have been proposed including changes in cellular uptake and efflux of the drug, increased detoxification of the drug, inhibition of apoptosis and increased DNA repair. Oxaliplatin is active in highly cisplatin-resistant cancer cells in the laboratory; however, there is little evidence for its activity in the clinical treatment of patients with cisplatin-resistant cancer. The drug paclitaxel may be useful in the treatment of cisplatin-resistant cancer; the mechanism for this activity is unknown.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the social}} mores {{represented}} in the show, a happy marriage <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cornerstone</b> <b>of</b> successful middle-class family life, and June and Ward represent the warm, happily married, successful middle class couple. In contrast, the parents of Beaver's friend Larry Mondello are a husband frequently {{out of town on}} business and an exasperated wife struggling single-handedly to raise a son and sometimes depending on Ward to help discipline him. Singles like prim Aunt Martha and globe-trotting, yarn-spinning Uncle Billy are shown as either out-of-touch and irksome or untrustworthy. The one episode dealing with divorce shows it as having negative effects on children and family life.|$|E
25|$|In Engel v. Vitale (1962) the Court {{ruled that}} government-imposed nondenominational prayer {{in public school}} was unconstitutional. In Lee v. Weisman (1992), the Court ruled prayer {{established}} by a school principal at a middle school graduation was also unconstitutional, and in Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe (2000) it ruled that school officials may not directly impose student-led prayer during high school football games nor establish an official student election process {{for the purpose of}} indirectly establishing such prayer. The distinction between force of government and individual liberty <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cornerstone</b> <b>of</b> such cases. Each case restricts acts by government designed to establish prayer while explicitly or implicitly affirming students' individual freedom to pray.|$|E

25|$|Rice (vary) <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cornerstone</b> <b>of</b> the Malagasy {{diet and}} is {{typically}} consumed at every meal. The accompaniment served with rice is called laoka {{in the highlands}} dialect, the official version of the Malagasy language. Laoka are most often served {{in some kind of}} sauce: in the highlands, this sauce is generally tomato-based, while in coastal areas coconut milk is often added during cooking. In the arid southern and western interior where herding zebu is traditional, fresh or curdled zebu milk is often incorporated into vegetable dishes. Laoka are diverse and may include such ingredients as Bambara groundnuts with pork, beef or fish; trondro gasy (freshwater fish); ravitoto (shredded cassava leaves) with peanuts, beef or pork; henan'omby (beef) or akoho (chicken) sauteed with ginger and garlic or simmered in its own juices (a preparation called ritra); various types of seafood, which are more readily available along the coasts or in large urban centers; and many more. A variety of local greens such as anamamy (Morelle greens), anamafaitra (Martin greens) and particularly anamalao (paracress)—distinguished by the mildly analgesic effect the boiled leaves and flowers produce—are commonly sold alongside anandrano (watercress) and anatsonga (bok choy). In the arid south and west, such as among the Bara or Tandroy peoples, staples include sweet potato, yams, taro root and especially cassava, millet and maize, generally boiled in water and occasionally served in whole milk or flavored with crushed peanuts. Ro (broth) may be served as the main laoka or in addition to it to flavor and moisten the rice.|$|E
