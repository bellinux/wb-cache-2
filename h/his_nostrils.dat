5|$|Captain Blackadder's trench {{receives}} {{a phone call}} from HQ: a full-scale attack has been ordered for the next day at dawn. Realising that this is likely to mean his death, Blackadder plans to escape by pretending to be mad: he puts underpants on his head and sticks pencils in <b>his</b> <b>nostrils.</b> His plan is thwarted when General Melchett arrives to see what is happening and remarks that he shot an entire platoon that used this exact method; Blackadder overhears and narrowly escapes Melchett's punishment by pretending he is relating the story to Baldrick.|$|E
5|$|In Sri Lanka {{the belief}} of Riri Yaka (Blood Demon) can be found. According to mythology, he tore his mother's breast and emerged {{into the human}} world as a demon killing her. The demon is said to give a primary form and eight other manifestations. In most cases {{he is said to}} be a giant who towers over his human victims. In the primary form, his face is blue and splotched with blood. Red rays radiate from his bloodshot eyes. Blood pours from <b>his</b> <b>nostrils</b> and smoke billows from his ears. His mouth is filled with decomposing human flesh and his breath is foul. His entire body is {{coloured}} scarlet with dripping blood. He is closely associated with Mara, the demon king of death.|$|E
500|$|Media reports {{stated that}} Jackson's autopsy {{reported}} one scar beside each of <b>his</b> <b>nostrils,</b> [...] one scar behind {{each of his}} ears, and two scars on his neck, [...] "probably" [...] from cosmetic surgery, plus cosmetic tattoos on his eyebrows, around his eyes and lips, and on his scalp (at his receding hairline).|$|E

500|$|In the Vishnu Purana, Varaha {{represents}} yajna (sacrifice), as {{the eternal}} upholder of the earth. His feet represent the Vedas (scriptures). His tusks represent sacrificial stakes. His teeth are offerings. His mouth is the altar with tongue of sacrificial fire. The [...] {{hair on his}} head denotes the sacrificial grass. The eyes represent {{the day and the}} night. His coarse hair represents sexual prowess. The head represents the seat of the Brahmin (priest). The mane represents the hymns of the Vedas. <b>His</b> <b>nostrils</b> are for oblation. His joints represent the various ceremonies. The ears are said to indicate rites (voluntary and obligatory). Thus, Varaha is the embodiment of the Supreme Being who brings order amidst chaos in the world by his sacrifice.|$|E
500|$|In 1785, the French {{sculptor}} Jean-Antoine Houdon {{was commissioned}} by the Virginia General Assembly to sculpt a bust of Washington, who had led the nascent United States to victory in the American Revolutionary War. [...] Houdon had been recommended by the recently returned United States Minister to France, Benjamin Franklin. [...] The retired general sat for Houdon at Mount Vernon, the Washington family home in Fairfax County, Virginia between October 6 and 12, 1785. [...] The sculptor took a life mask of the general's face—Washington's adopted granddaughter Nelly Custis, aged six at the time, later recalled her shock in seeing Washington lying on a table, as she thought dead, covered by a sheet and by the plaster for the mask. [...] She was told that two quills extended into <b>his</b> <b>nostrils,</b> providing him with air. [...] A bust at Mount Vernon today testifies to that visit. [...] On his return to Paris, Houdon used his visage of General Washington {{in a number of}} sculptural settings, including the commissioned statue for the General Assembly, which still stands in marble in the Virginia State Capitol.|$|E

6000|$|Let Howison urge with {{perfunctory}} chin [...] Toleration--that's {{all very}} well, [...] But a roast is [...] "nuts" [...] to <b>his</b> <b>nostril</b> thin, [...] And he's running--I know by the smell-- [...] A secret and personal Hell! ...|$|R
2500|$|Tóibín sent a {{photograph}} of Borges to Don DeLillo, who described it as [...] "the face of Borges against a dark background—Borges fierce, blind, <b>his</b> <b>nostrils</b> gaping, his skin stretched taut, his mouth amazingly vivid; his mouth looks painted; he's like a shaman painted for visions, and the whole face {{has a kind of}} steely rapture". DeLillo often seeks inspiration from it.|$|E
2500|$|The North British Review {{reflected}} evangelical Presbyterian {{willingness to}} consider science {{in relation to}} [...] "Reason and not to Faith" [...] and to view natural law as directly guided by God, but warned that [...] "If it has been revealed to man that the Almighty made {{him out of the}} dust of the earth, and breathed into <b>his</b> <b>nostrils</b> the breath of life, it is in vain to tell a Christian that man was originally a speck of albumen, and passed through the stages of monads and monkeys, before he attained his present intellectual pre-eminence." [...] Many women admired the book, and [...] "It would augur ill for the rising generation if the mothers of England were infected with the errors of Phrenology: it would augur worse were they tainted with materialism." ...|$|E
2500|$|What {{followed}} was chaotic. Some {{people in the}} room left to call for help. Among those that stayed, some pleaded with Dwyer to surrender the gun while others tried to approach him and seize the weapon. Dwyer warned against either action, exclaiming, [...] "Don't, don't, don't, this will hurt someone." [...] A moment later, Dwyer fired one shot into his mouth and collapsed to the floor, dead. [...] Witnesses screamed and cursed as five news cameras recorded the events. One of the cameras remained focused on Dwyer and captured close up footage of the aftermath of the shooting; as his lifeless body slumped to the floor, blood streamed from the exit wound {{in the back of his}} head as well as from <b>his</b> <b>nostrils.</b> A shaken Horshock took the podium and asked the media to leave and for someone to call for medical assistance and the Pennsylvania Capitol Police.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the second}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), before any shrub or grass had yet sprouted on earth, and before God had sent rain for the earth, a flow would well {{up from the}} ground to water the earth. God formed man from the dust, blew the breath of life into <b>his</b> <b>nostrils,</b> and made him a living being. God planted a garden in the east in Eden, caused to grow there every good and {{pleasing}} tree, and placed the tree of life and the Tree of the knowledge of good and evil {{in the middle of the}} garden. A river issued from Eden to water the garden, and then divided into four branches: the Pishon, which winds through Havilah, where the gold is; the Gihon, which winds through Cush; the Tigris, which flows east of Asshur; and the Euphrates. God placed the man in the garden of Eden to till and tend it, and freed him to eat from every tree of the garden, except for the tree of knowledge of good and evil, warning that if the man ate of it, he would surely die. Announcing that it was not good for man to be alone and that God would make for him a fitting helper, God formed out of the earth all the beasts and birds and brought them to the man to name. The second reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E

50|$|On October 2, 1897, Truesdale {{underwent}} a minor surgical procedure {{to remove a}} growth in <b>his</b> <b>nostril.</b> While the operation initially appeared successful, complications developed two days later.

He was buried in Minneapolis' Lakewood Cemetery.|$|R
60|$|He put out {{his arms}} and folded her to his breast. And for a while she lay there sobbing. He looked at us over her bowed head, with eyes that blinked damply above <b>his</b> quivering <b>nostrils.</b> <b>His</b> mouth was set as steel.|$|R
60|$|He put the {{cigarette}} between his lips, {{drew a deep}} breath, then slowly sent the smoke down <b>his</b> <b>nostrils.</b>|$|E

60|$|True enough, {{in another}} moment the black would have struck the grey sideways. Lysbeth saw Van de Werff rise {{from his seat}} and throw his weight backward, {{dragging}} the grey on to his haunches. By an inch--not more--the Wolf sleigh missed the gelding. Indeed, one runner of it struck his hoof, and the high wood work of the side brushed and cut <b>his</b> <b>nostril.</b>|$|R

60|$|This is {{a gentle}} delineation, is it not, reader? Yet he whom it {{describes}} scarcely impressed {{one with the}} idea of a gentle, a yielding, an impressible, or even of a placid nature. Quiescent as he now sat, there was something about <b>his</b> <b>nostril,</b> <b>his</b> mouth, his brow, which, to my perceptions, indicated elements within either restless, or hard, or eager. He did not speak to me one word, nor even direct to me one glance, till his sisters returned. Diana, as she passed in and out, in the course of preparing tea, brought me a little cake, baked on the top of the oven.|$|R
