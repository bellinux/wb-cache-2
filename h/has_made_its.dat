5|$|Ethnocentrism, tribalism, {{religious}} persecution, and prebendalism {{have affected}} Nigerian politics both prior and subsequent to independence in 1960. Kin-selective altruism <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>its</b> way into Nigerian politics, resulting in tribalist efforts to concentrate Federal {{power to a}} particular region of their interests. Nationalism has also led to active secessionist movements such as MASSOB, Nationalist movements such as Oodua Peoples Congress, Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta and a civil war. Nigeria's three largest ethnic groups (Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba) have maintained historical preeminence in Nigerian politics; competition amongst these three groups has fuelled corruption and graft.|$|E

25|$|The {{presence}} of some unique physical characteristics in the species C. insititia <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>its</b> taxonomic status uncertain, {{and a source}} of some debate in the literature― some authors have supported its segregation into the genus Boedijnopeziza, and others have questioned this interpretation. Based on a study of ultrastructural characteristics using electron microscopy, a possible solution to the taxonomic conundrum was suggested in 2003, to segregate C. insititia into a subgenus Boedijnopeziza within the Cookeina.|$|E
25|$|Firms may {{engage in}} Stackelberg {{competition}} {{if one has}} some sort of advantage enabling it to move first. More generally, the leader must have commitment power. Moving observably first is the most obvious means of commitment: once the leader <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>its</b> move, it cannot undo it - it is committed to that action. Moving first may be possible if the leader was the incumbent monopoly of the industry and the follower is a new entrant. Holding excess capacity is another means of commitment.|$|E

But if the player so chooses, the predictor will already <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>its</b> decision, making it impossible for the player's decision to affect the predictor's decision.|$|R

Changi Airport's efforts to counter the onset of age includes periodic physical upgrades to its existing terminals, building of new facilities and raising the benchmark in service quality, a factor which cannot be bought or built overnight, and where it continues to excel over its rivals.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the years}} Rauchtown Run <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>its</b> {{way through the}} {{mountains}} {{on its way to}} the West Branch Susquehanna River near Jersey Shore, via Antes Creek. The years of water flow have created the gorge in which the park is located. Tall erosional spires of sandstone have created a formation known as Castle Rocks. The rocks can be seen from the Mid State Trail and are said to resemble the towers of an ancient castle. The frost action, brought on by the cold winters of Pennsylvania, has led to the creation of this rock formation.|$|E

American Apparel shirts are used as band merchandise and concert T-shirts for the bands, among many others, Hanson, Van Halen, Wilco, Death Cab for Cutie, Foursquare, Vampire Weekend, Metric, and Flogging Molly as well as websites like Threadless, Busted Tees. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, the animal rights advocacy group, prints its merchandise on American Apparel clothes because they are made domestically and animal-free.|$|E

25|$|Since the Corps {{as a whole}} {{began to}} grow in 2007, Marine Aviation {{expanded}} with it, and continues to grow. Several new squadrons have been activated, with HMLA-567, VMFAT-501, and VMU-4 pending. Some support units will gain personnel and equipment. The Corps intends to buy 340 F-35Bs to replace all F/A-18 Hornets, AV-8B Harrier IIs and EA-6B Prowlers in the fighter, attack, and electronic warfare roles. The MV-22B Osprey is replacing the CH-46 Sea Knight and the remaining CH-53D Sea Stallion (most of which were replaced by CH-53E Super Stallions). The Corps has transitioned all East Coast CH-46 squadrons to the MV-22, which <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>its</b> first combat deployments and Marine Expeditionary Unit deployments. Remaining CH-53Es will eventually {{be replaced by the}} CH-53K model. The KC-130J Super Hercules will replace all other C-130 models. As part of the H-1 upgrade program, UH-1N Twin Hueys will be replaced or converted to UH-1Y Venoms, while AH-1W SuperCobras will upgrade to AH-1Z Vipers. The VH-3D Sea Kings and the VH-60N Blackhawks of HMX-1 were to be replaced by the VH-71 Kestrel in the VXX program, but the future of the program is in doubt with budget cuts by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. Unmanned aerial vehicle programs will be upgraded in tiers, with the RQ-7 Shadow currently replacing the RQ-2 Pioneer and the RQ-11 Raven replacement planned. They have also been in the lead in looking at unmanned helicopters to resupply troops at remote forward operating bases in places such as Afghanistan.|$|E

500|$|A Song of Ice and Fire spawned an {{industry}} of spin-off products. Fantasy Flight Games released a collectible card game, a board game, and two collections of artwork {{inspired by the}} Ice and Fire series. Various roleplaying game products were released by Guardians of Order and Green Ronin. Dynamite Entertainment adapted A Game of Thrones into a same-titled monthly comic in 2011. Several video games are available or in production, including [...] (2011) and Game of Thrones (2012) by Cyanide; both received mediocre ratings from critics. A social network game titled Game of Thrones Ascent (2013) by Disruptor Beam allows players to live {{the life of a}} noble during the series' period setting. Random House released an official map book called The Lands of Ice and Fire, which includes old and new maps of the Ice and Fire world. The companion book The World of Ice & Fire by Martin and the Westeros.org owners Elio M. García Jr. and Linda Antonsson was published in October 2014. Other licensed products include full-sized weapon reproductions, a range of collectable figures, Westeros coinage reproductions, and a large number of gift and collectible items based on the HBO television series.

2500|$|The {{priests of}} these {{respective}} [...] "Royal Fires" [...] {{are said to}} have competed with each other to draw pilgrims by promoting the legends and miracles that were purported to have occurred at their respective sites.
