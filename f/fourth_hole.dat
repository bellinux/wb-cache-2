2500|$|Perhaps his {{favorite}} design feature was to include naturally occurring geological cliffs. He built a green atop a 50-foot cliff on the par 5 16th hole at Dornick Hills. The green is reachable in two shots by long hitters. Most players, however, {{opt for a}} lay up shot {{to set up a}} short iron approach to the elevated green. [...] On the next hole golfers tee off from the cliff summit and play sharply downward to a par 3 green below. The par 3 <b>fourth</b> <b>hole</b> at Twin Hills Golf & Country Club also features Maxwell's cliff attribute.|$|E
2500|$|Jones had {{a unique}} {{relationship}} with the town of St Andrews, Scotland. On his first appearance on the Old Course in The Open Championship of 1921, he withdrew after 11 holes in the third round, when he failed to complete the hole (in effect disqualifying himself), and tore up his scorecard, although he finished the round and indeed played the fourth round as well. He firmly stated his dislike for The Old Course and the town reciprocated, saying in the press, [...] "Master Bobby is just a boy, and an ordinary boy at that." [...] Later, he came to love the Old Course and the town like few others. When he won the Open at the Old Course in 1927, he wowed the crowd by asking that the trophy remain with his friends at the Royal and Ancient Golf Club rather than return with him to Atlanta. He won the British Amateur over The Old Course in 1930, and scored a double eagle 2 on the <b>fourth</b> <b>hole</b> (then a par-5, now a par-4), by holing a very long shot from a fairway bunker. In 1958, he was named a Freeman of the City of St Andrews, becoming only the second American to be so honored, the other being Benjamin Franklin in 1759. As Jones departed Younger Hall with his honor, the assembly spontaneously serenaded him off to the traditional tune of Will Ye No Come Back Again? in a famously moving tribute. Today, a scholarship exchange bearing the Jones name exists between the University of St Andrews and Emory University, Queen's University, The University of Western Ontario and the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. At Emory, four students are sent to St Andrews for an all-expenses-paid year of study and travel. In return, Emory accepts four students from St Andrews each year. The program, the Robert T. Jones Scholarship, {{is among the most}} unusual scholarships offered by any university.|$|E

60|$|It is evident, {{from the}} Vicomte's remarks, {{that he found}} time to {{continue}} Honora's lessons in golf--or rather that she found time, {{in the midst of}} her manifold and self-imposed duties, to take them. And in this diversion she was encouraged by Mrs. Holt herself. On Saturday morning, the heat being unusual, they ended their game by common consent at the <b>fourth</b> <b>hole</b> and descended a wood road to Silver Brook, to a spot which they had visited once before and had found attractive. Honora, after bathing her face in the pool, perched herself on a boulder. She was very fresh and radiant.|$|E
60|$|The <b>fourth</b> <b>hole</b> {{follows the}} curve of the road, {{on the other side of}} which are picturesque woods. It {{presents}} no difficulties to the expert, but it has pitfalls for the novice. The dashing player stands for a slice, while the more cautious are satisfied if they can clear the bunker that spans the fairway and lay their ball well out to the left, whence an iron shot will take them to the green. Peter and James combined the two policies. Peter aimed to the left and got a slice, and James, also aiming to the left, topped into the bunker. Peter, realizing from experience the futility of searching for his ball in the woods, drove a second, which also disappeared into the jungle, as did his third. By the time he had joined James in the bunker he had played his sixth.|$|E
60|$|Their {{friendship}} ripened rapidly, as friendships {{do in the}} South of France. In that favoured clime, {{you find}} the girl and Nature does the rest. On the second morning of their acquaintance Mortimer invited her to walk round the links with him and watch him play. He did it a little diffidently, for his golf was not of the calibre that {{would be likely to}} extort admiration from a champion. On the other hand, one should never let slip the opportunity of acquiring wrinkles on the game, and he thought that Miss Somerset, if she watched one or two of his shots, might tell him just what he ought to do. And sure enough, the opening arrived on the <b>fourth</b> <b>hole,</b> where Mortimer, after a drive which surprised even himself, found his ball in a nasty cuppy lie.|$|E

50|$|The clubhouse is {{contemporary}} in design, but blends {{with the}} surrounding woodland. Inside, high ceilings and large windows offer magnificent views of the course and Connecticut's seasonal foliage, with a large dining room overlooking the third and <b>fourth</b> <b>holes</b> serving as the building's center. Gourmet food and fine wines are provided {{to the dining room}} and an adjoining sunny garden patio and deck by the club restaurant, Widdy's. The building also houses a unique hexagonal conference room with matching hexagonal conference table and a full service PGA pro shop, which contains the computerized national golf handicap system and sells, rents, and repairs the latest equipment, as well as selling golf apparel featuring Handsome Dan, the Yale bulldog mascot. Scott Ramsay is the course superintendent. Yale Golf Professional Peter Pulaski was named Connecticut Section PGA Golf Professional of The Year in 2010.|$|R
6000|$|The youth looked up, and now {{perceived}} {{the advantage of}} the <b>fourth</b> <b>hole</b> or window, just over the forehead, which is peculiar to the Denayrouze helmet, most others having only three openings. He could look up by merely raising his eyes, whereas with the other helmets it is necessary to bend well back {{in order to get the}} front-glass to face upwards. Afterwards he found that there were some who objected to this glass on the ground that as divers when below, and in total or partial darkness, are constantly butting their heads against beams and other portions of wrecks, the upper glass would be in frequent danger of being broken, but to this it was replied that it might be well guarded by powerful cross-bars. The point we believe is still an open question. At all events the upper glass was found useful on the occasion to which we refer, for, looking up through it, our amateur diver saw a stone coming down to him. It was lowered by a piece of twine, and tied to it was an old Times newspaper. Detaching and unfolding it Berrington set his lamp on the sand, and, seating himself beside it, found that he could read with perfect ease! ...|$|E
50|$|Besides {{sequential}} uncovering, recorders can use forked fingering {{to produce}} tones {{other than those}} produced by simple sequential lifting of fingers. In the fingering 0123, air leaks from the open holes 4,5,6, and 7. The pressure inside the bore is higher at the <b>fourth</b> <b>hole</b> than at the fifth, and decreases further at the 6th and 7th holes. Consequently, the most air leaks from the <b>fourth</b> <b>hole</b> and the least air leaks from the seventh hole. As a result, covering the <b>fourth</b> <b>hole</b> affects the pitch more than covering any of the holes below it. Thus, at the same air pressure, 01235 produces a pitch between 0123 and 01234 may be obtained. In this way, the fingers {{may be used to}} obtain fine gradations in pitch.|$|E
