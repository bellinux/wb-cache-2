Along with Ed Greene and Bob La Masney {{who worked}} on post-production mixing, he received an Emmy Award for sound design and the mixing of the live show. Jackson designed the sound for Streisand's 1999–2000 , and he mixed the New Year's Eve concert 31 December 1999 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Paradise, Nevada. He mixed Streisand's appearances in Sydney and Melbourne in March 2000, connecting the large backing choir's sound mix by optical fibre from a nearby polo field where the choir was stationed. The <b>fibre</b> <b>connection</b> was Jackson's real-world test of a similar setup planned {{to be used for}} the Summer Olympics six months later.|$|E

40|$|Mental {{disorders}} {{are a major}} cause of long-term disability and are a direct cause of mortality, with approximately 800. 000 individuals dying from suicide every year worldwide - a high proportion of them related to major depressive disorder (MDD) ^ 1 ^. Healthy relatives of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) are at risk to develop the disease. This higher vulnerability is associated with structural^ 2 - 4 ^ and functional brain changes^ 5 ^. However, we found using high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) with 61 diffusion directions that neuron tracts between frontal cortices and limbic as well as temporal and parietal brain regions are characterized by better diffusion coefficients in unaffected relatives (UHR), who managed to stay healthy, compared to healthy volunteers without any family history for a psychiatric disease (HC). Moreover, those UHR with stronger <b>fibre</b> <b>connections</b> better managed incidences of adversity in early life without later developing depression, while in HC axonal connections were found to be decreased when they had early-life adversity. Altogether these findings indicate the presence of stronger neural <b>fibre</b> <b>connections</b> in UHR, which seem to be associated with resilience against environmental stressors, which we suggest occur through epigenetic mechanisms...|$|R

The topology is fabric utilizing FC switches or directors. Valid rates include 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 [...] Gigabit per second data rates at distances up to 100 km. FICON has replaced ESCON in current deployments because of FICON's technical superiority (especially its higher performance) and lower cost.|$|E
