50|$|A fillet knife (also {{called a}} <b>filleting</b> <b>knife)</b> is a kitchen knife used for filleting. It gives good control and aids in filleting. It is very {{flexible}} boning knives {{that are used}} to filet and prepare fish. They have blades about 15 cm to 28 cm (6 to 11 inches) long, allowing them to move easily along the backbone and under the skin of fish.|$|E
50|$|In {{the light}} of Restivo's {{connection}} to Claps' disappearance and suspicious behaviour detectives regarded him as chief suspect, but there was not sufficient evidence for a prosecution. In March 2004 he was put under close surveillance using electronic tracking and listening devices; police overheard Restivo being spoken to by his parents and female companion {{as if he were}} a child. He was observed on repeated visits to a beauty spot where he was covertly filmed as he apparently stalked lone women. On 12 May 2004 the surveillance team became alarmed, a uniformed patrol was ordered to stop and search Restivo on a pretext. Although it was a warm day he was wearing waterproof over-trousers. In his car police found an identical change of clothing, <b>filleting</b> <b>knife,</b> scissors, a balaclava and gloves. In June 2004 a schoolgirl identified Restivo as the man who had cut her hair on a bus, in November 2006 he was rearrested and his home searched. Police found a lock of hair. Trainers he had worn on the day of the murder had traces of blood, but it could not be identified. In 2008 new techniques revealed a bloodstained towel left at the murder scene had a DNA match for Restivo, but he claimed to have left it on the visit to the home of Barnett on 6 November. The evidence was still judged insufficient for a prosecution.|$|E
50|$|The {{shape of}} the blade is also important. A thicker blade will be heavier and {{stronger}} and stiffer than a thinner one of similar design while also making it experience more drag while slicing or piercing. A <b>filleting</b> <b>knife</b> will be thin enough to be very flexible while a carving knife will be thicker and stiffer; a dagger will be thin so it can pierce while a camping knife will be thicker to it can be stronger and more durable. A strongly curved edge, like a talwar will allow the user to draw {{the edge of the}} blade against an opponent even while close to the opponent where a straight sword would be more difficult to pull in the same fashion. The curved edge of an axe means that only a small length of the edge will initially strike the tree, concentrating force as does a thinner edge whereas a straight edge could potentially land with the full length of its edge against a flat section of tree. A splitting maul has a convex section to avoid getting stuck in wood where chopping axes can be flat or even concave. A khopesh or falchion or kukri is angled and/or weighted at the distal end so that force is concentrated at the faster moving, heavier part of the blade maximising cutting power and making it largely unsuitable for thrusting where a rapier is thin and tapered allowing it to pierce and be moved with more agility while reducing its chopping power compared to a similarly sized sword.|$|E

In addition to his career in engineering and politics, Canney also created his own brand of fish <b>fillet</b> <b>knives,</b> called [...] "Canney’s Leech Lake filet knife." [...] The knives were named for a lake in which he fished during the summer.|$|R
50|$|Very sharp knives sharpen {{at about}} 10 dps (degrees per side) (which {{implies that the}} knife's edge has an {{included}} angle of 20-degrees). Generally speaking, razors, paring <b>knives,</b> and <b>fillet</b> <b>knives</b> should be the sharpest knives at an angle of 12° - 18°. Most kitchen knives, like utility/slicing knives, chef’s knives, boning knives, carving knives, should be sharpened to 15° - 25°. The exceptions are Japanese style knives that are usually sharpened to 14° - 16° depending on the knife maker. Japanese style knives utilize a much harder steel, {{and are therefore more}} brittle than their Western style counterparts. This means care should be taken when handling these knives as they are susceptible to chipping and breaking. The sporting knife category, including pocket knives, survival knives, and hunting knives, sees more intense action and should be sharpened to the 25° - 30° angle range. The less sharp angle means there is more metal there to cut, thus providing more durability out in the field. For an extremely durable edge, a machete, chisel, drawknife or ax should be sharpened down to 30° - 40° providing even more ruggedness and longer lasting sharpness.|$|R
50|$|Norma Davis, 86, {{is thought}} to be Gray’s first victim; {{because of the lack of}} evidence, however, Gray was never convicted of killing her. Norma was the {{mother-in-law}} of the woman (Jeri Davis) who married Dana's father in 1988. Jeri's first husband, Bill Davis, was Norma's son. Bill died in the early 1980s, and his widow eventually married Dana's father Russell Armbrust. Jeri continued to care for her elderly mother-in-law, even after she remarried. Dana knew Norma very well. On February 16, 1994, Norma Davis had been dead for two days when she was found by her neighbor, Alice Williams. Davis had a wood handled utility knife sticking out of her neck, and a <b>fillet</b> <b>knife</b> sticking out of her chest. Other than a broken fingernail, she had no other marks. A bloodied afghan lay at her feet. Detectives learned that there was no forced entry into the house. Detectives were informed that she always kept her door locked unless she was expecting a visitor. Williams stated she could not remember Davis mentioning she was expecting company. Detectives found a Nike shoe print pointed toward the kitchen. They also found Davis’ $148 Social Security check. On the first floor of Davis’ condo, a smear of blood was found on an armchair. A ripped out phone cord was also found.|$|R
40|$|Sulfuric acid is a colorless, odorless liquid, {{which causes}} typical injury {{patterns}} such as cutaneous and ocular burns, respiratory complications from inhalation, and ingestion injuries (coagulative necrosis of the mucosa, gastric and intestinal perforations) with significant dermal and mucosal injury {{because of its}} corrosive action. Most injuries caused by sulfuric acid ingestion are accidental, especially in the pediatric population. Intentional cases of ingestion have rarely been reported in adults {{as a method of}} suicide following a major depressive disorder. In this paper, we report the case of a 44 -year-old woman who was found dead outside her home with a retained <b>fillet</b> <b>knife</b> embedded in her left chest wall and cutaneous chemical burns extending from her mouth down her chin and anterior torso. During the crime scene investigation, a half empty bottle of chemical drain cleaner containing concentrated sulfuric acid was found next to her body. An autopsy revealed chemical burns to the tongue, trachea, larynx, pharynx and esophagus along with a blackish fluid in the peritoneal cavity. Histological analyses showed extensive corrosive changes in the gastrointestinal tract. Toxicological screening of blood and urine samples was negative; gastric contents contained a high quantity of concentrated (≈ 96 %) sulfuric acid with a pH value of < 1. 0. Death was attributed to shock following sulfuric acid ingestion. Circumstantial evidence and autopsy findings proved that the manner of death was suicidal. Complex suicides can be challenging for the forensic pathologist because of the plurality of methods used. The authors highlight the importance of systematical exhaustive postmortem investigation in order to ascertain the cause and manner of death in cases of planned complex suicide...|$|R
50|$|The {{filleting}} {{process of}} the fish starts after the pretreatment and trimming stage. Fish filleting is either done by mechanical filleting machine or by hand. The machine which {{is used for the}} production of fish <b>fillet</b> has cutting <b>knives</b> which cut the fillet from the backbone and take out the collarbone. The filleting department and the pretreatment department are always separated from each other because ensures that workers from non-sterile pretreatment area are not coming across the hygienic filleting care area.|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} a thesis {{in the context}} of the {{engineering}} education Ergonomic Design and Production at Luleå University of Technology that includes 30 hp. The work began in 2007 in collaboration with the knife manufacturer Mora of Sweden. The company wanted to enter the market for kitchen knives and formulated a mission statement: to develop a series of kitchen knives, identify what kind of knifes that should be included in such series and to develop packaging and display material for the series. The work would be based on a market and user study and the design would be based on Mora of Sweden’s design manual. The process that was used for the work began with an exploratory phase including interviews, observations and questionnaires with both professional users and ordinary consumers. Based on the survey the work identified user needs and established a product specification based on user needs, the requirements of the manufacturer and the theory of antropometry and hand ergonomics. The next phase was a concept generating phase with brainstorming and sketching. After sorting out four concepts followed a concept selection phase that began with visualization of the four concepts both through renderings and prototypes to be tested by users. After this phase the work took a break and was addressed again in 2015 with the last phase of the concept selection process that was based on the user’s opinion and a decision matrix. The concept chosen was a knife handle made of plastic with a dark gray rubber surface and lime green accents. The handle is easy to grip and is designed so that the user can easily switch position of the hand to keep the knife balanced during various operations. The design harmonize with Mora of Sweden design manual by the simple curved line that divides the handle into two surfaces and the concave and convex surfaces that come together in a smooth transition. Based on the information collected from users and benchmarking the work identified five kinds of knives that should be included in the series: large chef's <b>knife,</b> bread <b>knife,</b> <b>fillet</b> <b>knife,</b> paring knife and small chef’s knife. A proposal for a packaging material was developed from the knife concept and Mora of Sweden design manual. The package can both be adapted for a smaller series of knives and for individual knives and picks up the shape of Mora of Sweden logotype and shows the silhouette images of which knives are inside. Because the work was paused for a long time the result was no longer of relevant to Mora of Sweden but the work nonetheless presented proposals on how the concept could be further developed.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the occurrence of L. monocytogenes in a selected fish and seafood processing line. Results showed that during 2013, 12. 4 %, 8. 3 % and 2. 3 % of fish, seafood salads and environmental swabs were positive for L. monocytogenes. All positive food samples showed a contamination level below 100 CFU/g. Environmental swabs from surface of slicing and trimming tables, slicing machines, fish <b>filleting</b> and trimming <b>knives,</b> belt glazer and working table were positive for L. monocytogenes. Therefore, strict attention must be paid to cleaning and disinfection to control the level of L. monocytogenes...|$|R
