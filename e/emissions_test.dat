25|$|The list {{of items}} tested has been {{continually}} expanded over the years, including in 1968 – a tyre check; 1977 – checks of windscreen wipers and washers, direction indicators, brakelights, horns, exhaust system and condition of the body structure and chassis; 1991 – checks of the <b>emissions</b> <b>test</b> for petrol engine vehicles, together with checks on the anti-lock braking system, rear wheel bearings, rear wheel steering (where appropriate) and rear seat belts; 1992 – a stricter tyre tread depth requirement for most vehicles; 1994 – a check of emissions for diesel engine vehicles; 2005 – introduction of a computerised administration system for issuing non-secure test certificates. Also rolled out in 2005 {{was the creation of}} the 'Automated Test Bay' this differs from traditional testing by adding additional equipment to the bay to negate the use of an assistant during the test; 2012 – checks of secondary restraint systems, battery and wiring, ESC, speedometers and steering locks.|$|E

In 2005, the EPA and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) confirmed Harley-Davidson {{to be the first}} corporation to voluntarily enroll in the One Clean-Up Program. This program is designed for the clean-up of the affected soil and groundwater at the former York Naval Ordnance Plant.

40|$|This {{research}} study developed a methodology to perform mandatory dynamometer vehicular <b>emissions</b> <b>tests</b> on real roads, performed on-road <b>emissions</b> <b>tests,</b> and compared {{the test results}} to the estimates using the current EPA emissions estimation model. Currently, mandatory vehicular exhaust <b>emission</b> <b>tests</b> are performed on chassis or engine dynamometers using the Federal Test Procedure (FTP) /Supplemental Federal Test Procedure (SFTP) drive schedules. Based on the developed real-world in-use <b>emissions</b> <b>testing</b> methodology with using a modified test vehicle, authors could follow the FTP/SFTP drive schedules while the vehicle was driven on real roads, and measure emissions during the in-use on-road FTP/SFTP <b>emissions</b> <b>testing.</b> <b>Emissions</b> from the vehicle during the testing were measured, analyzed, and compared to estimated emissions using the current EPA emissions estimation model, MOtor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES).

40|$|This {{research}} {{attempts to}} evaluate emission measurement of on road vehicle. In this regard, the research develops failure probability model of vehicle <b>emission</b> <b>test</b> for passenger car which utilize binomial logit model. The model focuses on failure of CO and HC <b>emission</b> <b>test</b> for gasoline cars category and Opacity <b>emission</b> <b>test</b> for diesel-fuel cars category as dependent variables, while vehicle age, engine size, brand {{and type of}} the cars as independent variables. In order to implement the model, a survey to measure the vehicle emission was done to the two categories of passenger cars on road. Other information related to {{the characteristics of the}} cars sampling was collected in the survey. The survey was done at two main roads in Makassar City, one of the large cities in Indonesia. According to calculation result, the model gave good appearance. In further, the results showed that vehicle age became significant variable to determine the failure probability of vehicle <b>emission</b> <b>test</b> for CO and HC emission of gasoline cars category. As well as, engine size gave significant contribution to the failure of Opacity <b>emission</b> <b>test</b> for diesel-fuel cars category. The model provides good expectation to be tested in others cases and to develop failure model of vehicle <b>emission</b> <b>test</b> on macro scale in further studies...|$|R

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the abilities of acoustic <b>emission</b> <b>testing</b> and self-sensing fibres to detect damage in composite materials. This was achieved by performing acoustic <b>emission</b> <b>testing</b> on fibre samples and resin samples during tensile tests. In parallel to the acoustic <b>emission</b> <b>testing</b> the changes in strain for the resin samples was recorded using electrical resistance strain gauges and fibre Bragg gratings. Acoustic <b>emission</b> <b>testing</b> of Self-sensing fibre composites allowed the recorded changes in the light intensity transmitted by the fibres to be analysed in conjunction with the acoustic emission data. The fabrication of the three different sample types is presented as is the installation of the electrical resistance strain gauges and fibre Bragg gratings. The experimental procedure and method of data capture is detailed for tensile and acoustic <b>emission</b> <b>testing,</b> strain data and Self-sensing fibre data. The fabrication and testing of the samples was performed successfully. The testing procedure and analysis of results demonstrates the accurate use of acoustic emission and the potential of self-sensing fibres in detecting damage in composite materials...|$|R

50|$|Heavy duty {{trucks and}} buses are also covered by Drive Clean program. They are tested {{annually}} once {{the vehicle is}} more than one year old, with no age limit to testing; A 1975 diesel powered truck or bus would still be tested so long as it was still registered. All vehicles on Ontario roads are further monitored by a 'smog patrol' team for MOECC and can be stopped at random and roadside tested. The Smog Patrol team drive vehicles that are equipped with mobile testing equipment to perform roadside tests. The Smog Patrol can also perform a visual inspection to ensure all emissions control equipment is in place and functioning as originally built (tampering with or removing this equipment is an offence separate from Drive Clean but under the same Regulation). Some registrants circumvent an <b>emissions</b> <b>test</b> by registering their vehicles to addresses outside the Drive Clean testing areas. Circumventing an <b>emissions</b> <b>test</b> in this way is an offence and could result in a ticket or summons and could also result in licence plates being seized.|$|E

50|$|Otoacoustic <b>emissions</b> <b>test</b> (OAE) and {{auditory}} brainstem response (ABR) testing measures the brain's response to sounds. The OAE measures hearing of newborns by placing an emitting sound into the baby's ear through a probe. A microphone {{placed in the}} baby's ear canal {{will pick up the}} inner ear's response to sound stimulation and allows for observation. The ABR, also known as the brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER) test or auditory brainstem evoked potential (ABEP) test measure the brain's response to clicking sounds sent through headphones. Electrodes on the scalp and earlobes record a graph of the response.|$|E
50|$|Aggressive {{throttle}} movements, {{engine speed}} changes, and engine motoring are characteristics of most transient engine tests. The usual {{purpose of these}} tests are vehicle emissions development and homologation. In some cases, the lower-cost eddy-current dynamometer is used to test one of the transient test cycles for early development and calibration. An eddy current dyno system offers fast load response, which allows rapid tracking of speed and load, but does not allow motoring. Since most required transient tests contain {{a significant amount of}} motoring operation, a transient test cycle with an eddy-current dyno will generate different <b>emissions</b> <b>test</b> results. Final adjustments are required to be done on a motoring-capable dyno.|$|E
