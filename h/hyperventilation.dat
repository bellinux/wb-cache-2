5|$|Diagnosis of {{epilepsy}} can be difficult. A {{number of}} other conditions may present very similar signs and symptoms to seizures, including syncope, <b>hyperventilation,</b> migraines, narcolepsy, panic attacks and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES). In particular a syncope can {{be accompanied by a}} short episode of convulsions. Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, often misdiagnosed as nightmares, was considered to be a parasomnia but later identified to be an epilepsy syndrome. Attacks of the movement disorder paroxysmal dyskinesia may be taken for epileptic seizures. The cause of a drop attack can be, among many others, an atonic seizure.|$|E
5|$|It {{is only as}} {{a result}} of {{accurately}} maintaining the composition of the 3 litres alveolar air that, with each breath, some carbon dioxide is discharged into the atmosphere and some oxygen is taken up from the outside air. If more carbon dioxide than usual has been lost by a short period of <b>hyperventilation,</b> breathing will be slowed down or halted until the alveolar partial pressure of carbon dioxide has returned to 5.3kPa (40mmHg). The opposite occurs after breath-holding.|$|E
5|$|The major {{side effects}} include dilated pupils, blurred vision, dryness of the mouth, extreme alertness, pruritus, confusion, agitation, tremor, {{extrapyramidal}} symptoms (dystonia, akathisia), headache, dizziness, anxiety, insomnia, vomiting, chest pain, hallucinations, paresthesia, tachycardia, hypertension, palpitations, collapse, <b>hyperventilation,</b> sweating, hyperthermia and problems with urine retention. The more severe toxic effects include psychosis or adverse psychiatric events, renal toxicity, respiratory failure, hyperthermia, serotonin syndrome, rhabdomyolysis and seizure. Blood benzylpiperazine concentrations have been measured either to confirm clinical intoxication or {{as part of}} a medicolegal death investigation.|$|E
5|$|Blackouts in {{freediving}} {{can occur}} when the breath is held long enough for metabolic activity to reduce the oxygen partial pressure sufficiently to cause loss of consciousness. This is accelerated by exertion, which uses oxygen faster, or by <b>hyperventilation,</b> which reduces the carbon dioxide level in the blood. Lower carbon dioxide levels increase the oxygen-haemoglobin affinity, reducing availability of oxygen to brain tissue {{towards the end of}} the dive (Bohr effect); they also suppress the urge to breathe, making it easier to hold the breath to the point of blackout. This can happen at any depth.|$|E
5|$|Neuroimaging {{is helpful}} but not {{flawless}} in detecting raised ICP. A more accurate {{way to measure}} ICP is to place a catheter into a ventricle of the brain, which has {{the added benefit of}} allowing cerebrospinal fluid to drain, releasing pressure in the skull. Treatment of raised ICP may be as simple as tilting the patient's bed and straightening the head to promote blood flow through the veins of the neck. Sedatives, analgesics and paralytic agents are often used. Hypertonic saline can improve ICP by reducing the amount of cerebral water (swelling), though it is used with caution to avoid electrolyte imbalances or heart failure. Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, appears to be equally effective at reducing ICP. Some concerns; however, have been raised regarding some of the studies performed. Diuretics, drugs that increase urine output to reduce excessive fluid in the system, may be used to treat high intracranial pressures, but may cause hypovolemia (insufficient blood volume). <b>Hyperventilation</b> (larger and/or faster breaths) reduces carbon dioxide levels and causes blood vessels to constrict; this decreases blood flow to the brain and reduces ICP, but it potentially causes ischemia and is, therefore, used only in the short term. Administration of corticosteroids is associated with an increased risk of death, and so it is recommended that they not be given routinely.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} for blackout on ascent differs from <b>hyperventilation</b> induced hypocapnia expedited blackouts {{and does not}} necessarily follow <b>hyperventilation.</b> However, <b>hyperventilation</b> will exacerbate the risk {{and there is no}} clear line between them. Shallow water blackouts can happen in extremely shallow water, even on dry land following <b>hyperventilation</b> and apnoea but the effect becomes much more dangerous in the ascent stage of a deep freedive. There is considerable confusion surrounding the terms shallow and deep water blackout and they have been used to refer to different things, or be used interchangeably, in different water sports circles. For example, the term shallow water blackout has been used to describe blackout on ascent because the blackout usually occurs when the diver ascends to a shallow depth.|$|E
25|$|Others: dizziness, <b>hyperventilation,</b> sweating, {{difficulty}} breathing, confusion, headache, and lacrimation.|$|E
25|$|Three {{factors are}} thought to be involved: Voluntary {{suppression}} of breathing and rapid depressurisation are necessarily present, and self-induced hypocapnia by <b>hyperventilation</b> is known to be present in many cases. Depressurisation on ascent is an explanation for the shallow depth of ascent blackouts but does not fully explain all cases unless accompanied by an underlying suppression of the urge to breathe through self-induced hypocapnia via <b>hyperventilation.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{respiratory}} centers {{try to maintain}} an arterial CO2 pressure of 40mm Hg. With intentional <b>hyperventilation,</b> the CO2 content of arterial blood may be lowered to 10–20mm Hg (the oxygen content of the blood is little affected), and the respiratory drive is diminished. This is why one can hold one's breath longer after hyperventilating than without hyperventilating. This carries the risk that unconsciousness may result before the need to breathe becomes overwhelming, which is why <b>hyperventilation</b> is particularly dangerous before free diving.|$|E
25|$|In {{this article}} {{constant}} pressure blackout and shallow water blackout refers to blackouts {{in shallow water}} following <b>hyperventilation</b> and ascent blackout and deep water blackout refers to blackout on ascent from depth. Some free divers consider blackout on ascent to be a special condition or subset of shallow water blackout but the primary underlying mechanisms differ. This confusion is exacerbated {{by the fact that}} in the case of blackout on ascent, <b>hyperventilation</b> induced hypocapnia also may be a contributory factor even if depressurisation on ascent is the actual precipitator.|$|E
25|$|An {{analysis}} of incidents suggests that lifeguards at swimming pools could prevent most accidents by {{watching out for}} young male swimmers who are practicing <b>hyperventilation</b> and underwater swimming.|$|E
25|$|If excited or {{anxious about}} the dive, the diver should take extra care to remain calm and breathe {{naturally}} as adrenaline (epinephrine) can cause <b>hyperventilation</b> without the diver noticing.|$|E
25|$|The CDC has {{identified}} a consistent set of voluntary behaviors associated with unintentional drowning, and calls them dangerous underwater breath-holding behaviors. These are intentional <b>hyperventilation,</b> static apnea and hypoxic training.|$|E
25|$|Panic {{occurs when}} an inexperienced swimmer or non swimmer becomes mentally {{overwhelmed}} by the circumstances of their immersion, leading to sinking and drowning. Occasionally, panic kills through <b>hyperventilation,</b> even in shallow water.|$|E
25|$|Where deep breath-hold divers are {{observed}} to use <b>hyperventilation</b> timely and informed advice may {{save their lives}} but experience suggests that divers are reluctant to change their practice unless {{they have a very}} clear understanding of the mechanics of the process.|$|E
25|$|Increases in the strength-duration time {{constant}} are observed when this conductance is activated by depolarization, or by <b>hyperventilation.</b> However, demyelination, which exposes internodal membrane {{with a higher}} membrane {{time constant}} {{than that of the}} original node, can also increase strength-duration time constant.|$|E
25|$|Shallow water {{blackout}} – {{caused by}} <b>hyperventilation</b> prior to swimming or diving. The primary urge to breathe is triggered by rising carbon dioxide (CO2) {{levels in the}} bloodstream. The body detects CO2 levels very accurately and relies on this to control breathing. <b>Hyperventilation</b> reduces the carbon dioxide content of the blood but leaves the diver susceptible to sudden loss of consciousness without warning from hypoxia. There is no bodily sensation that warns a diver of an impending blackout, and victims (often capable swimmers swimming under the surface in shallow water) become unconscious and drown quietly without alerting anyone {{to the fact that}} there is a problem; they are typically found on the bottom.|$|E
25|$|Bicarbonate ions {{are crucial}} for {{regulating}} blood pH. A person's breathing rate influences {{the level of}} CO2 in their blood. Breathing that is too slow or shallow causes respiratory acidosis, while breathing that is too rapid leads to <b>hyperventilation,</b> which can cause respiratory alkalosis.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms {{and signs}} of early {{hypercapnia}} include flushed skin, full pulse, tachypnea, dyspnea, muscle twitches, reduced neural activity, headache, confusion and lethargy, increased cardiac output, an elevation in arterial blood pressure, and a propensity toward arrhythmias. In severe hypercapnia, symptoms progresses to disorientation, panic, <b>hyperventilation,</b> convulsions, unconsciousness, and eventually death.|$|E
25|$|Tests for vertigo often {{attempt to}} elicit {{nystagmus}} and to differentiate vertigo from other causes of dizziness such as presyncope, <b>hyperventilation</b> syndrome, disequilibrium, or psychiatric causes of lightheadedness. Tests of vestibular system (balance) function include: electronystagmography (ENG), Dix-Hallpike maneuver, rotation tests, head-thrust test, caloric reflex test, and computerized dynamic posturography (CDP).|$|E
25|$|Irregular respirations {{occur when}} injury {{to parts of}} the brain {{interfere}} with the respiratory drive. Biot's respiration, in which breathing is rapid for a period and then absent for a period, occurs because of injury to the cerebral hemispheres or diencephalon. <b>Hyperventilation</b> can occur when the brain stem or tegmentum is damaged.|$|E
25|$|Divers and {{swimmers}} who blackout or {{grey out}} underwater during a dive will usually drown unless rescued and resuscitated {{within a short}} time. Freediving blackout has a high fatality rate, and mostly involves males younger than 40 years, but is generally avoidable. Risk cannot be quantified, but is clearly increased by any level of <b>hyperventilation.</b>|$|E
25|$|During the recording, {{a series}} of {{activation}} procedures may be used. These procedures may induce normal or abnormal EEG activity that might not otherwise be seen. These procedures include <b>hyperventilation,</b> photic stimulation (with a strobe light), eye closure, mental activity, sleep and sleep deprivation. During (inpatient) epilepsy monitoring, a patient's typical seizure medications may be withdrawn.|$|E
25|$|Outright {{banning of}} <b>hyperventilation</b> and breath-hold {{training}} at swimming pools may reduce or prevent instances of blackout at those pools, but {{may result in}} the activity being done at other places where there may be less supervision and {{a higher risk of}} fatality. Supervision by a person not involved in the activity and familiar with the risks and management of blackouts is a preferred option.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} of diuresis involves the proximal tubule of the kidney. The enzyme carbonic anhydrase is found here, allowing the reabsorption of bicarbonate, sodium, and chloride. By inhibiting this enzyme, these ions are excreted, along with excess water, lowering blood pressure, intracranial pressure, and intraocular pressure. By excreting bicarbonate, the blood becomes acidic, causing compensatory <b>hyperventilation</b> with deep respiration (Kussmaul respiration), increasing levels of oxygen and decreasing levels {{of carbon dioxide}} in the blood.|$|E
25|$|If these homeostats are compromised, then a {{respiratory}} acidosis, or a {{respiratory alkalosis}} will occur. In {{the long run}} these can be compensated by renal adjustments to the H+ and HCO3− concentrations in the plasma; but since this takes time, the <b>hyperventilation</b> syndrome can, for instance, occur when agitation or anxiety cause a person to breathe fast and deeply thus causing a distressing respiratory alkalosis through the blowing off of too much CO2 from the blood into the outside air.|$|E
25|$|Freediving {{blackout}} {{can occur}} on any dive profile: at constant depth, on an ascent from depth, {{or at the}} surface following ascent from depth and may be described {{by a number of}} terms depending on the dive profile and depth at which consciousness is lost. Blackout during a shallow dive differs from blackout during ascent from a deep dive in that deep water blackout is precipitated by depressurisation on ascent from depth while shallow water blackout is a consequence of hypocapnia following <b>hyperventilation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Symptoms {{and signs}} of early {{hypercapnia}} include flushed skin, full pulse, tachypnea, dyspnea, extrasystoles, muscle twitches, hand flaps, reduced neural activity, and possibly a raised blood pressure. According to other sources, symptoms of mild hypercapnia might include headache, confusion and lethargy. Hypercapnia can induce increased cardiac output, an elevation in arterial blood pressure, and a propensity toward arrhythmias. Hypercapnia may increase pulmonary capillary resistance. In severe hypercapnia (generally PaCO2 greater than 10 kPa or 75 mmHg), symptomatology progresses to disorientation, panic, <b>hyperventilation,</b> convulsions, unconsciousness, and eventually death.|$|E
25|$|The primary urge {{to breathe}} is {{triggered}} by rising carbon dioxide (CO2) {{levels in the}} bloodstream. Carbon dioxide builds up in the bloodstream when oxygen is metabolized {{and it needs to}} be expelled as a waste product. The body detects carbon dioxide levels very accurately and relies on this as the primary trigger to control breathing. <b>Hyperventilation</b> artificially depletes the resting concentration of carbon dioxide causing a low blood carbon dioxide condition called hypocapnia. Hypocapnia reduces the reflexive respiratory drive, allows the delay of breathing and leaves the diver susceptible to loss of consciousness from hypoxia. For most healthy people the first sign of low oxygen levels is a greyout or unconsciousness: there is no bodily sensation that warns a diver of an impending blackout.|$|E
25|$|Vaginismus {{has been}} {{classified}} by Lamont {{according to the}} severity of the condition. Lamont describes four degrees of vaginismus: In first degree vaginismus, the patient has spasm of the pelvic floor that can be relieved with reassurance. In second degree, the spasm is present but maintained throughout the pelvis even with reassurance. In third degree, the patient elevates the buttocks to avoid being examined. In fourth degree vaginismus (also known as grade 4 vaginismus), the most severe form of vaginismus, the patient elevates the buttocks, retreats and tightly closes the thighs to avoid examination. Pacik expanded the Lamont classification to include a fifth degree in which the patient experiences a visceral reaction such as sweating, <b>hyperventilation,</b> palpitations, trembling, shaking, nausea, vomiting, losing consciousness, wanting to jump off the table, or attacking the doctor. The Lamont classification continues to be used to the present and allows for a common language among researchers and therapists.|$|E
500|$|In unusual circumstances, {{effects on}} other tissues may be observed: it is {{suspected}} that during spaceflight, high oxygen concentrations {{may contribute to}} bone damage. Hyperoxia can also indirectly cause carbon dioxide narcosis in patients with lung ailments such as {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} or with central respiratory depression. [...] <b>Hyperventilation</b> of atmospheric air at atmospheric pressures does not cause oxygen toxicity, because sea-level air has a partial pressure of oxygen of [...] whereas toxicity does not occur below [...]|$|E
500|$|Diabetic {{ketoacidosis}} arises {{because of}} a lack of insulin in the body. The lack of insulin and corresponding elevation of glucagon leads to increased release of glucose by the liver (a process that is normally suppressed by insulin) from glycogen via glycogenolysis and [...] also through gluconeogenesis. High glucose levels spill over into the urine, taking water and solutes (such as sodium and potassium) along with it in a process known as osmotic diuresis. This leads to polyuria, dehydration, and polydipsia. The absence of insulin also leads to the release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue (lipolysis), which are converted through a process called beta oxidation, again in the liver, into ketone bodies (acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate). β-Hydroxybutyrate can serve as an energy source in the absence of insulin-mediated glucose delivery, and is a protective mechanism in case of starvation. The ketone bodies, however, have a low pKa and therefore turn the blood acidic (metabolic acidosis). The body initially buffers the change with the bicarbonate buffering system, but this system is quickly overwhelmed and other mechanisms must work to compensate for the acidosis. One such mechanism is <b>hyperventilation</b> to lower the blood carbon dioxide levels (a form of compensatory respiratory alkalosis). This <b>hyperventilation,</b> in its extreme form, may be observed as Kussmaul respiration.|$|E
500|$|Stage 2 (12 to 36 hours) where {{signs of}} [...] "alcohol" [...] {{poisoning}} appear to resolve, underlying severe internal damage is still occurring. An elevated heart rate, <b>hyperventilation</b> or increased breathing effort, and dehydration may start to develop, along {{with high blood}} pressure and metabolic acidosis. These symptoms are a result of accumulation of organic acids formed by the metabolism of ethylene glycol. Additionally low calcium concentrations in the blood, overactive muscle reflexes, muscle spasms, QT interval prolongation, and congestive heart failure may occur. If untreated, death most commonly occurs during this period.|$|E
500|$|West in 1986 {{reported}} that a few miners permanently lived in the mine area. A small group of men, caretakers of the mine, has lived {{at an altitude of}} [...] in a galvanized iron hut. One of them reportedly had spent two years there. These are considered to be the highest human inhabitants on Earth. Research performed on Aymara miners of the Aucanquilcha mine indicates that they are fully acclimatized to the altitude, with less <b>hyperventilation</b> and higher hemoglobin than acclimatized people from lower areas. Their families are born and raised at lower altitudes, however.|$|E
