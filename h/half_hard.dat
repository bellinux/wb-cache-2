The copper strips are produced in three different tempers – soft, <b>half</b> <b>hard</b> and hard – under different rolling and heat-treatment conditions. The copper strips from different tempers are subjected to specialized testing and their mechanical and high-electrical-conductivity characteristics analyzed. On the basis of mechanical rolled-strip parameters – yield strengths, Re, ultimate tensile strengths, Rm, Vickers hardness, HV, and elongation after fracture, A, – some Stress-hardness and Stress-hardness-elongation spaces have been plotted. These Spaces {{can be used as}} an instrument for general evaluation of the applied rolling technology and for prediction of copper-strip mechanical behaviour under given exploitation conditions...|$|E

40|$|The thermophysical {{parameters}} of selected cheeses (processed cheese and <b>half</b> <b>hard</b> cheese) {{are presented in}} the article. Cheese is a generic term for {{a diverse group of}} milk-based food products. Cheese is produced throughout the world in wide-ranging flavors, textures, and forms. Cheese goes during processing through the thermal and mechanical manipulation, so thermal properties {{are one of the most}} important. Knowledge about thermal {{parameters of}} cheeses could be used in the process of quality evaluation. Based on the presented facts thermal properties of selected cheeses which are produced by Slovak producers were measured. Theoretical part of article contains description of cheese and description of plane source method which was used for thermal parameters detection. Thermophysical parameters as thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity and volume specific heat were measured during the temperature stabilisation. The results are presented as relations of thermophysical parameters to the temperature in temperature range from 13. 5 °C to 24 °C. Every point of graphic relation was obtained as arithmetic average from measured values for the same temperature. Obtained results were statistically processed. Presented graphical relations were chosen according to the results of statistical evaluation and also according to the coefficients of determination for every relation. The results of thermal parameters are in good agreement with values measured by other authors for similar types of cheeses...|$|E

Les modele constitutifs de Johnson-Cook et Steinberg-Guinan sont evalues avec le modele de Steinberg mis en evidence comme etant le mieux adapte eq raison de sa limite superieure sur la contrainte d'Ccoulement. Un ensamble de parameters de durcissement par contrainte d'ecoulement est defiftni, fournissant une excellente correllente correlation avec les quatre configurations differentes d'ogives EFP. Abstrack The {{determination of}} liner material constitutive modeling parameters {{based on the}} results of four EFP tests, with different liner geometry's, is described in this paper. This paper presents an approach for determining an "appropriate set " of materiai parameters to describe the deviatoric behavior of the liner material. The Johnson-Cook and Steinberg-Guinan constitutive models are evaluated with the Steinberg model shown to be more suitable because of its upper limit on the flow stress. A set of flow stress hardening parameters are found that provide excellent correlation to the four different EFP warhead design configurations. 1. GENERIC WARHEAD DESCRIPTION The generic EFP warhead used in this study has an 89 mm diameter, LID of 0. 5, contains 300 g of LX- 14, and an 82 g copper liner. The EFP projectile created by the warhead is shown in Figure 1 [I]. It has a velocity of 2520 m/s, length of 58 mm, with nose and tail diameters of 18 mm and 24 mm respectively. The liner material used in the warhead is fabricated using a multi-step forge/anneal/coin process.

40|$|The {{locus of}} {{innovation}} {{is not the}} individual firm anymore but increasingly the network in which the firm is embedded. Hence, in this paper innovation is investigated in the broader context of networks and applied to the traditional food sector. Networking refers to a process of identifying and acting on complementary interests with or without formal means of cooperation and {{plays an important role}} for the diffusion and adoption of innovations, because they increase the flow of information. Two main types of networks exist. Vertical networks relate to cooperation of partners belonging to the same chain. Meanwhile, horizontal networks refer to coopereation among firms which are primarily competitors. Data were collected during focus groups and in-depths interviews in three European contries: Belgium, Hungary, and Italy. In each country, data are collected from retailers/wholesalers, food manufacturers and suppliers in the beer, hard and <b>half</b> <b>hard</b> cheese, ham, sausage, or white paprika chain. In the investigated countries both vertical and horizontal networks exist. However, the intensity of using the network differs. On the one hand vertical networks are well developed based on quality assurance schemes and traceability, though these networks often face difficulties due to high lack of trust. On the other hand, horizontal networks are well developed when a producer consortium is involved. However, these networks can be inhibited through strong competition. The partners in traditional food networks focus mainly on innovation related to product characteristics such as new size, form and packaging without changing the traditional character of the product. The main barriers for innovation in the traditional food networks are the lack of understanding the benefits of networking activities for innovation, the lack of trust, the lack of knowledge of appropriate methods and skills, and the lack of financial and physical resources. Our study points out that successful SMEs use their networks to overcome lacks of knowledge and information and to create possibilities of joint use of resources. </span...|$|E
