This thesis focuses on examining the possibility of implementing the marketing-oriented fisheries co-management in Lake Victoria (Tanzanian side) for Nile perch fisheries. The community-based organization BMU was selected as fisher’s representative organization in order to investigate {{how it is possible}} to improve the fisher’s market performance and reduce poverty in that fishing community. The findings of this study indicated that the globalization of Nile perch fishery has attracted number of actors to join the fishery and among of them are middlemen, processing plants and fishers themselves. The current <b>first-hand</b> <b>sales</b> system has greater contribution on poverty situation to the majority fishers and made few players benefits over resource, especially investors of the fish processing plants and the fish agents. The deliberate ignoring to identify and incorporate the problems, needs and opportunities that exist in the fishing communities under the co-management arrangement has made the fishers community less motivated in the participation of resource management activities. Fight for better fish prices and issuing of credits to fishers were the most prioritized <b>first-hand</b> <b>sales</b> activities that proposed by fishers community to be undertaken by the BMU organization. Capacity building for the BMU is highly needed in order for the organization to undertake its responsibilities efficiently and effectively. Theories used in this study include the poverty theory, co-management, SLA and middlemen theory. Key words: Co-management, <b>first-hand</b> <b>sales,</b> poverty, BMU’s, Tanzani...|$|R

The data represents {{the value of}} fish for consumption as a non-differentiated private good. The objective is to measure the welfare gains to society {{of an increase in}} “quality” for major fish species. The demand for Quality Extra and quality A-fish is estimated using an Inverse Almost Ideal Demand System (IAIDS-model) as the functional form of demand on <b>first-hand</b> <b>sales</b> data following the European Union established trade norms for quality-grading and sizecategories. Secondly the possibility of estimating changes in consumer surplus as the welfare gained by society of a general increase in quality of landed fish is discussed. However, the estimates on consumer surplus are not yet completed. The model adopted is a pricing model for the implicit price of the characteristic “quality” which necessarily is part of the product i. e. fish for consumption. Today the Danish market for fish does not explicitly state the “quality” of fish in the consumers market. This is generally a credence parameter. There are no objective verifiable standards available to the consumer and this is an element of trust in the word of the fish retailer. This paper shows the first results of adopting a revealed preference model for indirect benefit estimation on existing quality differentiated fish at <b>first-hand</b> <b>sales.</b> We explicitly discuss the assumptions of “weak complementarity” and “derived demand” necessary to run the model...|$|R

It gives a lively {{account of the}} latest development of the regulatory regime, including the Steering Committee’s Report on Regulation of <b>Sale</b> of <b>First-hand</b> Residential Properties by Legislation in October 2011, {{the publication of the}} first draft of the Residential Properties (<b>First-hand</b> <b>Sales)</b> Bill in November 2011, and the enactment of the Residential Properties (<b>First-hand</b> <b>Sales)</b> Ordinance in July 2012. Throughout the discussion, the study of unfair commercial behaviours in off-plan sales proceeds with the thinking on the design of a better regulatory regime, which involves yet goes beyond the analysis of individual rules of the Consent Scheme and the Residential Properties (<b>First-hand</b> <b>Sales)</b> Ordinance. The thesis first examines information and description of a variety of aspects pertaining to the property, the agreement and the sale: floor area; internal and external dimensions; fittings, finishes and appliances; location and environmental features; floor number; date of completion; lease term; salient points of the Deed of Mutual Covenants and Land Grant Conditions; sales arrangement; and transaction record. This is followed by a discussion on the design of the sales brochure, show flats, advertisements, project website, and preliminary agreement for sale and purchase. Then the thesis explores the bigger picture of the construction of a regulatory regime that strikes a balance between economic freedom and consumer protection, where different approaches to regulate property misdescripton including the doctrine of misrepresentation at common law and the Property Misdescriptions Act 1991 are compared. published_or_final_versionLawDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|Purchase of {{residential}} property in Hong Kong, no matter {{it is for}} accommodation or investment, is usually quite a big decision for most citizens in their life time. Since the price index and transaction cost are continually while the affordability of housing is relatively low as compared to most cities all over the world. Purchase of first-hand residential properties is even more special, as it is different from second hand property that most first-hand residential properties are sold under “Consent Scheme” when development projects are still under construction stage. Sometimes, no site visit is available and all information of the properties for buyers were provided by the developer of selling agencies. Such that buyers usually could hardly collect comprehensive information on their own. The market failure induced the Government, Consumer Council and respective associations in the property development industries to set up statutory requirements for the presentation of sale information and control of sale arrangement, so as to enhance protection of buyer interest. The Residential Properties (<b>First-hand</b> <b>Sales)</b> Ordinance Cap 621 was implemented in 2013 as a result, expected that the Ordinance could improve the fairness and transparency of property sale information and sale arrangement. After execution for years, there were different comments in the community. Particularly, Consumer Council opined that the Ordinance was still subject to review as there are loopholes and objectives of buyer protection could not be fulfilled as expected. This dissertation aims at revision for the expectation of buyer interest protection and finding out the gap between buyers’ expectation and the legislation. The expectation may not be fully covered by the legislation since the Legislation Council also obligate to balance the interest between buyers and property developers. A study of the similar statutory control measures in other countries will be conducted for comparison and evaluate the quality of buyers’ protection. Such that the effectiveness of the statutory control measures in Hong Kong could be concluded finally. published_or_final_versionHousing ManagementMasterMaster of Housing Managemen...|$|R
40|$|The {{natural gas}} {{industry}} combines activities with natural monopoly characterisitics {{with those that}} are potentially competitive. Pipeline transport and distribution, which have natural monopoly characterisitcs, require regulation of price and non-price behavior. Production is a contestable activity, but in a few countries (including Mexico) it remains a state monopoly. Gas marketing is also contestable, but {{the presence of a}} dominant, upstream, vertically integrated incumbent may pose significant barriers to entry. Market architecture decisions [...] such as horizontal structure, regional development, and the degree of vertical integration [...] are also crucial. The authors report that Mexico has undertaken structural reform in the energy sector more slowly than many other countries,but it has introduced changes to attract private investment in natural gas transport and distribution. These changes were a response to the rapid growth in demand for natural gas (about 10 percent a year) in Mexico, which was in turn a response to economic development and the enforcement of environmental regulations. The new regulatory framework provides incentives for firms to invest and operate efficiently and to bear much much of the risk associated with new projects. It also protects captive consumers and improves general economic welfare. The continued vertical integration of the state-owned company Pemex and its statutory monopoly in domestic production posed a challenge to regulators. Their response in liberalizing trade, setting <b>first-hand</b> <b>sales</b> prices, and regulating natural gas distribution makes the Mexican case an interesting example of regulatory design. As the first phase of investment mobilization and competition for the market in Mexican distribution project concludes, remaining challenges include consistently and transparently enforcing regulations, coordinating tasks among government agencies, and ensuring expansion of gas transport services and domestic production. A key challenge in the near term will be fostering competition in the market. In strengthening the role of market forces, one issue is Pemex's discretionary discounts on domestic gas and access to transport services, made possible by its monopoly in domestic production and marketing activities and its overwhelming dominance in transport. The main instrument available to the regulator is proscribing Pemex contract pricing, but more durable and tractable instruments should be considered.
