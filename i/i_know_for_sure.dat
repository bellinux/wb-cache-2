Primarily, he was {{concerned}} about the identity of the leading tenor: [...] "Until <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure,</b> I cannot compose duets, finales and trios", he writes in October. By the time Donizetti arrived in Venice on 6 January 1836, the score of Belisario was almost finished, and because of delays, he had time to hear several of the proposed singers in a performance of Rossini's L'assedio di Corinto given on 12 January, the day before rehearsals of Belisario were to begin.|$|E

In the book Along Came Mary: A Bad Girl Creek Novel (by writer Jo-Ann Mapson of the original bestseller Bad Girl Creek), character Mary Madigan details the extent of the impact that the Tad and Dixie love story has had on the people in her life: [...] "One thing <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure,</b> unless Mama had gotten a job, she was home, because it was time for All My Children. Both MayAnn and Mama had a king-size investment in Tad and Dixie's marriage, the one union on earth they considered unbreakable. It was the source of most of their bickering." ...|$|R
2500|$|Shortly {{after my}} arrival, Gabby flew the first F-86E to arrive on base in {{simulated}} combat {{over the field}} against an F-86A and whipped the other guy badly, with every Sabre jock on the base as witness. After he landed he briefed all pilots and announced that {{the limited number of}} E’s would be reserved for flight leaders. [...] I never forgot his response, when someone asked about the problem of wingmen staying with leaders. [...] He replied “Wingmen are to absorb firepower” and I never knew him well enough to judge whether he had a dry sense of humor, but he made the right choice. One thing <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure,</b> Gabby proved himself the greatest at our skills and talents, when he added 6 ½ MIG kills to his 28 victories in WW II and become the all-time American Fighter Ace, and I MIGht [...] add, he did it in the P-47, not the better air-to-air P-51. [...] And he didn’t have a chance to fly the much more powerful F-86F, which arrived after us.|$|E
