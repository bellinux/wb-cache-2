5|$|A {{combination}} of favorable geographical features {{contributed to the}} success of ancient Egyptian culture, the most important of which was the rich fertile soil resulting from annual inundations of the Nile River. The ancient Egyptians were thus able to produce an abundance of food, allowing the population to <b>devote</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> and resources to cultural, technological, and artistic pursuits. Land management was crucial in ancient Egypt because taxes were assessed based on the amount of land a person owned.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1930s, Smyth {{began to}} shift his {{interest}} to nuclear physics, inspired by James Chadwick's {{discovery of the}} neutron, John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton splitting the atom, and Ernest Lawrence's invention of the cyclotron. Three of his last research articles concerned detection of triatomic hydrogen and helium-3. His appointment as department chair forced him to <b>devote</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> to administrative work, {{at the expense of}} research. As department chair, he had two cyclotrons built at Princeton, one in 1935 and the other in 1946.|$|E
5|$|A new, {{permanent}} job with Trinidad Leaseholds allowed Constantine to <b>devote</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> to cricket. Constantine realised that to succeed {{as a professional}} cricketer, he needed to improve; his bowling lacked true speed and, when batting, he was often dismissed playing shots that were too adventurous. After his relative failure in 1926, he increased his level of practice, improved his fitness and trained to become a slip fielder to conserve his energies for genuine fast bowling. In the trial matches before the 1928 tour of England, Constantine secured his place on the tour by taking five for 32 and scoring 63. He left behind his wife Norma, whom he had married in 1927, and his newly-born daughter.|$|E

5|$|After Gemini 7, Kraft {{stepped back}} from his work at Mission Control, {{allowing}} other flight directors {{to take charge of}} the remaining missions so that he could <b>devote</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> to planning for the Apollo program. He served on two review boards at North American Aviation, the contractor responsible for the Apollo capsule. Yet Kraft still felt pangs at not being {{at the center of the}} action, particularly after the emergency re-entry of Gemini 8. Both astronauts and mission controllers had made the right decisions, but, as Kraft confessed to Robert Gilruth, he found himself wishing that he had been the one on the spot.|$|E
5|$|Since Lucas refocused {{the film}} on Anakin, {{he had to}} {{sacrifice}} certain extraneous plot points relating to Attack of the Clones. Lucas had previously promised fans that he would explain the mystery behind the erasure of the planet Kamino from the Jedi Archives. However, Lucas abandoned this plot thread in order to <b>devote</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> to Anakin's story, leaving the matter unresolved on film. As a compromise, Lucas permitted author James Luceno to explain the mystery of Kamino's erasure and {{the origins of the}} Clone army in his expanded universe novel Labyrinth of Evil.|$|E
5|$|Cave Story 3D is a 3D {{version of}} the game {{developed}} by Nicalis and published by NIS America as a retail title for the Nintendo 3DS. It was released on 8 November 2011 in North America, 11 November 2011 in Europe and 26 July 2012 in Japan. The game was built from scratch using 3D character models, featuring a dynamic camera system and another additional level, {{as well as a}} remixed soundtrack by Danny Baranowsky. The Japanese version features crossover content from various NIS and other companies' franchises such as Crazy Climber, Ikki, and Dragon Slayer. In order to <b>devote</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> to perfecting the title, Amaya quit his job as a software developer to become director of Cave Story 3D. He remarked that the transition to 3D was difficult because it required the consideration of so many more details.|$|E

5|$|Early in the 1958–59 season, Punch Imlach, the {{assistant}} {{general manager of the}} Leafs, fired Reay, installed himself as head coach, and appointed Olmstead as the playing assistant coach. This meant that while Imlach coached the team during games, Olmstead {{was in charge of the}} practices; however, Olmstead only lasted three months as assistant coach, resigning to <b>devote</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> to improving his play. The same season, the Leafs went on a long winning streak in order to qualify for the playoffs, but they lost to the Canadiens in the finals. After losing in the Finals the next season, and falling short of the Finals the next season, Olmstead won his fifth and final Stanley Cup in 1962, missing two months of the season with a broken shoulder, and being limited to only four out of the 12playoffgames.|$|E
5|$|Musial {{was named}} a vice {{president}} of the St. Louis Cardinals in September 1963, and he remained in that position until after the 1966 season. From February 1964 to January 1967, he also served as President Lyndon Johnson's physical fitness adviser, a part-time position created to promote better fitness among American citizens. Before the 1967 season began, the Cardinals named Musial the team's general manager, and he oversaw the club's World Series championship that year. He won the allegiance of Cardinals players by making fair offers from the outset of player-contract negotiations and creating an in-stadium babysitting service so players' wives could attend games. His longtime business partner Biggie Garagnani died in June 1967, prompting Musial to <b>devote</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> to managing his restaurant and other business interests. He came to realize that the detail-oriented desk job was not his forte. He consequently decided to step down as general manager, before even completing a full year on the job.|$|E
5|$|Gray {{was an avid}} reader even in his youth. He {{completed}} Clinton Grammar School {{from about}} 1823 to 1825, in those years reading many books from the nearby library at Hamilton College. In 1825 he enrolled at Fairfield Academy, switching to its Fairfield Medical College, {{also known as the}} Medical College of the Western District of Fairfield, in autumn 1826. It was during this time that Gray began to mount botanical specimens. On a trip to New York City, he attempted to meet with John Torrey to get assistance in identifying specimens, but Torrey was not home, so Gray left the specimens at Torrey's house. Torrey was so impressed with Gray's specimens that he began a correspondence with him. Gray graduated and became an M.D. in February 1831, even though he was not yet 21 years of age, which was a requirement at the time. Although Gray did open a medical office in Bridgewater, New York, where he had served an apprenticeship with Doctor John Foote Trowbridge while he was in medical school, he never truly practiced medicine as he enjoyed botany more. It was around this time that he began making explorations in New York and New Jersey. By autumn 1831 he had essentially given up his medical practice to <b>devote</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> to botany.|$|E
