40|$|The constructivist {{theory of}} {{knowledge}} and learning views knowledge not as pre-existing, but constructed. Individuals are different and these differences affect user performance. A recognition and awareness of learning styles will enable our students to develop learning strategies that will support them through their careers, assist our staff to present courses which {{address the needs of}} our students and industry, and promote quality conversations between staff and students addressing individual learning styles and approaches to learning. All our students are required to complete a <b>Foundation</b> <b>unit</b> in first year, first semester. This unit is a critical course for the students as it sets the groundwork on which all further study is dependant. The principal material covered includes essay and report writing, use of technology, ethics, critical thinking and project planning. As a result of our research into constructivism and the recognition of the value of students understanding their own learning styles, it was decided that some fundamental metacognitive skills needed to be available to all first year students. Due to the broad interdisciplinary nature of Foundation units, the School of Engineering decided to include a section on 'understanding your learning styles' into their newly developed <b>Foundation</b> <b>unit</b> with the aim of empowering our students in their university and life long learning requirements. This continuing phase of our research examines the learning styles of our students and staff and addresses issues confronting them in a university environment and beyond.

40|$|Wind, {{wave and}} current forces cause {{significant}} overturning loads to be transmitted to foundation systems of fixed-bottom offshore structures, while buoyancy forces, {{in conjunction with}} environmental loading, impart direct tensile loads to foundations of floating facilities. Shallow skirted foundations are a potentially attractive foundation solution when overturning or tension loading is significant, as suctions mobilised within the soil plug provide tensile resistance. While passive suctions are maintained, undrained reverse end bearing will govern failure providing enhanced uplift resistance compared with vented pull-out of the <b>foundation</b> <b>unit</b> (with or without the soil plug), governed by skirt/soil friction. Currently uncertainty exists over the limiting ratio of skirt depth to foundation diameter to mobilise undrained reverse end bearing and the duration over which passive suctions can be sustained.

40|$|Australia {{needs more}} {{qualified}} {{professionals in the}} Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) areas. The national focus on widening participation in higher education (HE) includes strengthening pathways from vocational education and training (VET). VET students often lack the mathematics skills necessary to articulate successfully to their chosen university degrees. Current approaches such as bridging and foundation mathematics programs are not tailored or sufficiently contextualised for VET articulants. This project is developing a mathematics pathway designed to improve the readiness of VET engineering diploma graduates for higher education study in engineering degree programs. Arrangements are flexible so that students can complete these pathways either {{as part of their}} engineering diploma as a VET student or as part of preparatory study at the diploma level at university. Many VET students are granted credit when entering a HE course in engineering and can transfer directly to second year units which may assume a level of mathematical knowledge by the university. However, in the VET Diploma of Engineering Technical (MEM 50212), there is only one core unit in mathematics (MEM 30012 A) equivalent to year 9 level and there are two mathematics electives, MEM 23004 A and MEM 23007 A, which are part of the advanced diploma and often not taught by many TAFE providers due to student demand and staff capabilities. The lack of required mathematics often leaves the student with a large gap in the required knowledge for success in HE. The project has been underway for over a year and significant {{progress has been made in}} developing the pathway for engineering. To date, the mathematical knowledge outcomes from the VET courses have been mapped to the requirements of the HE courses at the University of Tasmania, Flinders University and James Cook University. Gaps in mathematical knowledge have been identified. A formal articulation agreement has been established through TasTAFE and the University of Tasmania where current VET students will be able to enroll in the university <b>foundation</b> mathematics <b>units</b> and receive credit towards their VET diploma in engineering. In addition to the <b>foundation</b> <b>units,</b> the students need to do an online component. This consists of a few compulsory topics which are not covered in the <b>foundation</b> <b>units</b> with supporting examples, practice problems, practical application and self-assessed quizzes for each mathematics topic covered in the <b>foundation</b> <b>units,</b> contextualised to engineering. VET students are applied learners and therefore often struggle with the transition to HE. The online component of the pathway is designed to support the student by providing the context to the mathematics they are learning. Another advantage of the pathway is that it exposes the VET students to HE units and the university environment while satisfying the university mathematics entry requirements...|$|R

It focuses particularly on the teaching of 'economics as a social science', the <b>foundation</b> <b>unit</b> of study that lays the basis for a full programme of undergraduate studies in political economy. The pluralist character of this introductory unit reflects concern for a pedagogy that emphasises critical inquiry while building a basic understanding of rival schools of economic thought. Students are encouraged to consider controversial issues and thereby enhance their capacity to deal with complex challenges in an uncertain world. The article includes extensive discussion of the means by which the effectiveness of a such course can be assessed, including questionnaire data, written assignments and students' subsequent career trajectories. political economy; struggle; learning; values; reputation; Sydney; Australia; pluralism; pluralist economics; economics education; higher education. ...|$|E
30|$|After noticing her first-year {{accounting}} students growing disengaged {{whenever a}} difficult concept was introduced, the unit’s head lecturer turned to mobile technology {{to improve the}} situation. Student disengagement is not uncommon in the discipline of accounting (Byrne, Flood, & Griffin, 2014), but the unit in question also ‘suffered’ from being a mandatory breadth (or <b>foundation)</b> <b>unit</b> as it tended to attract {{students who did not}} specialise in accounting and who were generally direct-school leavers entering university for the first time. As a result, the unit routinely showed low test performance and high attrition. The lecturer experimented with using such online tools as Kahoot! to boost in-class engagement, but the issue of keeping students engaged in learning after the lecture was over remained an ongoing concern. Because of the proliferation of personal mobile devices among the students, it was decided that a mobile app was {{the most efficient way to}} reach out to them and keep them interested in the unit.|$|E
40|$|Plagiarism {{detection}} software (or more accurately, text-matching software) is commonly employed in a punitive capacity, detecting plagiarism after assignment submission. As {{an alternative to}} this approach, online plagiarism {{detection software}} was adopted as a learning tool for students instead. A trial was conducted in the <b>foundation</b> <b>unit</b> of the professional development component of the engineering degree at the University of Western Australia. Prior {{to the use of}} plagiarism detection software as a learning tool, efforts to instruct students regarding proper referencing and paraphrasing did not result in commensurate decreases in the levels of plagiarism detected. Many student assignments submitted displayed at the very least careless source acknowledgement. As part of the trial, students were given individual access to the software to self-assess their work as often as required prior to submission. The plagiarism detection algorithm assignment-originality statistics across three substantial written assignments throughout semester revealed continual and substantial improvement in student ability to avoid plagiarising. Through the use of this software, students were facilitated to learn how to properly acknowledge sources and improve their paraphrasing. This was accompanied by a dramatic decrease in the reportable incidence rates of plagiarism. Student perception of the use of plagiarism detection software in this capacity was also very positive...|$|E

40|$|It {{would be}} a rare thing to visit an early years setting or {{classroom}} in Australia that does not display examples of young children’s artworks. This practice serves to give schools a particular ‘look’, but {{is no guarantee of}} quality art education. The Australian National Review of Visual Arts Education (NRVE) (2009) has called for changes to visual art education in schools. The planned new National Curriculum includes the arts (music, dance, drama, media and visual arts) as one of the five learning areas. Research shows that it is the classroom teacher that makes the difference, and teacher education has a large part to play in reforms to art education.

40|$|At the University of the West Indies, large courses {{often require}} the {{involvement}} of multiple persons in their delivery. Within the English Language <b>Foundation</b> <b>Unit,</b> several of the courses offered cater to over 500 students in any given semester. The large number of students necessitates multiple practitioners providing instructions {{as part of the}} same course offering.

Practitioners’ conceptualization of a specific topic will inform the instruction received by students. In instances where practitioners do not conceptualize content in a like manner, students within the same course may receive varied instruction, thus affecting student output and overall evaluation. The paper looks specifically at a service course offered at the University of the West Indies and the practices of the multiple persons involved in the teaching of the course. It provides an overview of practitioners’ discussion of their conceptualization of content areas within the courses and assesses the extent to which there are variations and/or similarities.

The results indicated lacks in the stages of training needs and planning which committed the execution stage. The respondents perceived that there is a good impact of training at work as the quality of work improved with the application of the knowledge acquired in training. However, the scarce management and social support indicates the lack of planning and lack of the leadership and team support to the use of new skills, with negative influence to the transfer of learning to practice long-term work...|$|E
