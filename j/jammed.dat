Smythe's will gave the racing stable to the Conn Smythe Foundation, which as a charitable foundation, could not run a business. The new owners leased back the farm and stables. The only horse not in the sale was <b>Jammed</b> Lucky, Smythe's favourite, which was given to Smythe's grandson Tommy. <b>Jammed</b> Lucky was 23 years old and had sired 25 winning foals to that point.|$|E

The story led many national news broadcasts {{and was on}} the front page of most American newspapers, and in most largely Latter-day Saint communities in Utah and Idaho, telephone networks were completely <b>jammed</b> with excited callers. The announcement was formally approved by the church at the October 1978 general conference and is included in LDS Church's edition of the Doctrine and Covenants as Official Declaration 2.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to study the {{available}} literature on the production of <b>jams,</b> Greek-style yogurt, sensory analysis of yogurts and methodology for FaceReader. Than was made 10 samples of cranberry <b>jam.</b> It was followed by sensory analysis of <b>jams</b> and <b>jams</b> with commercial Greek-style yogurts. Best overal impression did <b>jam</b> from pressed cranberries (50 g of sugar per 100 g of fruit). In category of Greek-style yogurt with <b>jam</b> was rated the best yogurt Elinas with the same <b>jam.</b> It {{was found that the}} overal impression was influenced by intensity of sweetness. Using a computer program FaceReader was rated five <b>jams</b> from pressed cranberries. Top <b>jam</b> was again <b>jam</b> from pressed cranberries (50 g of sugar per 100 g of fruit). For evaluation of yogurt with <b>jam</b> using FaceReader was the best another <b>jam</b> from pressed fruit (55 g of sugar per 100 g of fruit) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, Firstly, the {{follower}} <b>jamming</b> and the <b>jamming</b> ellipse are introduced; After {{studying the}} <b>jamming</b> ellipse and combining the mathematical model of FH signal, the mathematical model of follower <b>jamming</b> is built; {{the performance of}} FH communication under the follower <b>jamming</b> is analyzed; Finally, the anti-jamming measures of follower <b>jamming</b> are proposed, In the future research, these can supply {{the foundation for the}} feature extraction of the follower <b>jamming</b> identification...|$|R
30|$|For power-cooperative <b>jamming,</b> noise {{frequency}} modulation and smart noise convolution power-cooperative <b>jamming</b> can {{more or less}} reduce the detection probabilities of CFAR detectors. Additionally, smart noise convolution power-cooperative <b>jamming</b> has a better interference effect than noise {{frequency modulation}} power-cooperative <b>jamming</b> for the same noise duration. Interrupted-sampling and periodic repeater power-cooperative <b>jamming</b> can achieve a larger pulse compression gain than either of the two <b>jamming</b> methods mentioned above, but it is sensitive to the radar uncertain position. In summary, for power-cooperative <b>jamming,</b> noise barrage can be used to improve the noise floor and cooperate with deceptive <b>jamming,</b> i.e., interrupted-sampling and periodic repeater <b>jamming,</b> to accomplish power barrage.|$|R
