500|$|Cambridge won the toss {{and elected}} {{to start from}} the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex {{side of the river}} to Oxford. The race started at 5:40p.m. with a <b>fair</b> <b>tide</b> in front of [...] "immense crowds"; The Times {{reported}} that the attendance was the largest in the race's history despite a rainstorm an hour before the race start. [...] Both crews rowed 38 strokes and were level for the first minute until Cambridge, slightly reducing their rating began to pull ahead, holding a canvas-length lead by the Mile Post.|$|E

50|$|It {{has also}} been {{suggested}} that Seil may be the Innisibsolian {{referred to in the}} Chronicle of the Kings of Alba, which records a victory of the Scots over a Viking force during the time of Donald II in the 9th century. Innisibsolian is of Goidelic origin and if Solian is derived from 'Seil' as this early date it is hardly likely to have had a different Gaelic name prior to the arrival of the Norse. Furthermore, although south of Iona, Seil is not on a direct route to Iona from Ireland and the very strong tides in the area would make it an unlikely stopping off point. On the other hand, any sailor will tell you that tides can be of great help to boats that must be sailed or rowed. If the journey is well timed, <b>fair</b> <b>tides</b> aid a journey from Antrim to the sheltered sound of Jura, which (according to Neil Oliver) was a well used trade route in those days. If this route is taken Seil is a natural stopping off point with a choice if sheltered anchorages. The onward journey avoids tha dangerous rocks and unsheltered water of a direct route from Iona to Ireland. There is no need to pass through the gulf of corryvreckan when conditions are unfavourable.|$|R

[...] "I am proud to see you, Mr. Balfour," [...] said he, in a fine deep voice, [...] "and glad that ye are here in time.

60|$|Seeing {{the impossibility}} of a {{successful}} attack below the town, Wolfe determined to attempt operations {{on a large scale}} above it. Accordingly, with every <b>fair</b> wind and <b>tide,</b> ships and transports ran the gauntlet of the batteries of Quebec, and, covered by a hot fire from Point Levi, generally succeeded, with more or less damage, in getting above the town. A fleet of flatboats was also sent up, and 1200 troops marched overland, under Brigadier Murray, to embark in them.|$|R
6000|$|The swift brown stream carried us at full speed. [...] "Captain Merrick" [...] {{pointed out}} sundry short cuts, but my brain now refused to admit as truth a word {{coming from a}} Mpongwe. We passed some bateaux pecheurs, saw sundry shoals of fish {{furrowing}} the water, and after two hours we were bumping on the rocks outlying Mombe Creek and Nenga Oga village. The passage of the estuary was now a pleasure, and though we grounded upon the shallows of [...] "Voileliay Bay," [...] the Kru-men soon lifted the heavy boat; the wind was <b>fair,</b> the <b>tide</b> was ebbing, and the strong current was in our favour. We reached Glass Town before midday, and after five hours, covering some twenty-two direct geographical miles, I found myself with pleasure under the grateful shade of the Factory. It need hardly be described, {{as it is the}} usual [...] "bungalow" [...] of the West African shore.|$|R
25|$|The {{end of the}} Napoleonic Wars and {{the long}} period of {{relative}} peace that followed caused a decline in both {{the number of new}} ships demanded by the navy and the number that needed to be repaired and maintained. Deptford's location and the shallow riverine waters exacerbated the problem as work and contracts were moved to other royal dockyards. The yard had its location close to the main navy offices in London in its favour, but the silting of the Thames and the trend towards larger warships made continued naval construction there an unappealing prospect. Engineer John Rennie commented of the yard that Ships-of-the-line which are built there cannot as I am informed with propriety be docked and coppered. Jury masts are put into them and they are taken to Woolwich, where they are docked, coppered and rigged, and I have been told of an instance where many weeks elapsed before a <b>fair</b> wind and <b>tide</b> capable of floating a large ship down to Woolwich occurred.|$|R

[...] For {{who that}} once possessed those heav'nly charms, [...] Could live one moment absent from thy arms? [...] He ceased, and May with modest grace replied; [...] 575 [...] (Weak was her voice, as while she spoke she cried;) [...] Heav'n knows (with that a tender sigh she drew) [...] I have a soul to save {{as well as}} you; [...] And, what no less you to my charge commend, [...] My dearest honour, will to death defend. [...] 580 [...] To you in holy church I gave my hand, [...] And joined my heart in wedlock's sacred band: [...] Yet, after this, if you distrust my care, [...] Then hear, my lord, and witness what I swear: [...] First may the yawning earth her bosom rend, [...] 585 [...] And let me hence to hell alive descend;[55] [...] Or die the death I dread no less than hell, [...] Sewed in a sack, and plunged into a well,[56] [...] Ere I my fame by one lewd act disgrace, [...] Or once renounce the honour of my race. [...] 590 [...] For know, sir knight, of gentle blood I came, [...] I loath a whore, and startle at the name. [...] But jealous men on their own crimes reflect, [...] And learn from thence their ladies to suspect: [...] Else why these needless cautions, sir, to me? [...] 595 [...] These doubts and fears of female constancy! [...] This chime still rings in ev'ry lady's ear, [...] The only strain a wife must hope to hear. [...] Thus while she spoke, a sidelong glance she cast [...] Where Damian, kneeling, worshipped as she passed:[57] [...] 600 [...] She saw him watch the motions of her eye, [...] And singled out a pear-tree planted nigh:[58] [...] 'Twas charged with fruit that made a goodly show, [...] And hung with dangling pears was ev'ry bough. [...] Thither th' obsequious squire addressed his pace, [...] 605 [...] And climbing, in the summit took his place; [...] The knight and lady walked beneath in view, [...] Where let us leave them, and our tale pursue. [...] 'Twas now the season when the glorious sun [...] His heav'nly progress through the Twins had run; [...] 610 [...] And Jove, exalted, his mild influence yields, [...] To glad the glebe, and paint the flow'ry fields: [...] Clear was the day, and Phoebus rising bright, [...] Had streaked the azure firmament with light; [...] He pierced the glitt'ring clouds with golden streams, [...] 615 [...] And warmed the womb of earth with genial beams.

[...] 630 [...] Heav'n rest thy spirit, noble Solomon, [...] A wiser monarch never saw the sun: [...] All wealth, all honours, the supreme degree [...] Of earthly bliss, was well bestowed on thee! [...] For sagely hast thou said: Of all mankind, [...] 635 [...] One only just, and righteous, hope to find: [...] But should'st thou search the spacious world around, [...] Yet one good woman {{is not to be}} found. [...] Thus says the king who knew your wickedness; [...] The son of Sirach[60] testifies no less. [...] 640 [...] So may some wildfire on your bodies fall, [...] Or some devouring plague consume you all; [...] As well you view the lecher in the tree, [...] And well this honourable knight you see: [...] But since he's blind and old (a helpless case) [...] 645 [...] His squire shall cuckold him before your face. [...] Now by my own dread majesty I swear, [...] And by this awful sceptre which I bear, [...] No impious wretch shall 'scape unpunished long, [...] That in my presence offers such a wrong. [...] 650 [...] I will this instant undeceive the knight, [...] And, in the very act, restore his sight: [...] And set the strumpet here in open view, [...] } [...] A warning to these ladies,[61] and to you, [...] } [...] And all the faithless sex, for ever to be true. [...] } [...] 655 [...] And will you so, replied the queen, indeed? } [...] Now, by my mother's soul it is decreed, [...] } [...] She shall not want an answer at her need. [...] } [...] For her, and for her daughters, I'll engage, [...] And all the sex in each succeeding age; [...] 660 [...] Art shall be theirs to varnish an offence, [...] And fortify their crimes with confidence. [...] Nay, were they taken in a strict embrace, [...] Seen with both eyes, and pinioned on the place; [...] All they shall need is to protest and swear, [...] 665 [...] Breathe a soft sigh, and drop a tender tear;[62] [...] Till their wise husbands, gulled by arts like these, [...] Grow gentle, tractable, and tame as geese. [...] What though this sland'rous Jew, this Solomon, [...] Called women fools, and knew full many a one; [...] 670 [...] The wiser wits of later times declare, [...] How constant, chaste, and virtuous women are: [...] Witness the martyrs, who resigned their breath, [...] Serene in torments, unconcerned in death;[63] [...] And witness next what Roman authors tell, [...] 675 [...] How Arria, Portia, and Lucretia fell. [...] But since the sacred leaves to all are free, [...] And men interpret texts, why should not we? [...] By this no more was meant, than to have shown, [...] } [...] That sov'reign goodness dwells in him alone [...] } [...] 680 [...] Who only Is, and is but only One.[64] [...] } [...] But grant the worst; shall women then be weighed [...] By ev'ry word that Solomon has said? [...] What though this king (as ancient story boasts) [...] Built a fair temple to the Lord of Hosts; [...] 685 [...] He ceased at last his Maker to adore, [...] And did as much for idol gods, or more. [...] Beware what lavish praises you confer [...] On a rank lecher and idolater; [...] Whose reign indulgent God, says Holy Writ, [...] 690 [...] Did but for David's righteous sake permit; [...] David, the monarch after heav'n's own mind, [...] Who loved our sex, and honoured all our kind. [...] Well, I'm a woman, and as such must speak; [...] Silence would swell me, and my heart would break. [...] 695 [...] Know then, I scorn your dull authorities, [...] Your idle wits, and all their learned lies. [...] By heav'n, those authors are our sex's foes, [...] Whom, in our right, I must and will oppose. [...] Nay, quoth the king, dear madam, be not wroth: [...] 700 [...] I yield it up; but since I gave my oath, [...] That this much injured knight again should see, [...] It must be done--I am a king, said he, [...] And one whose faith has ever sacred been. [...] And so has mine, she said, I am a queen: [...] 705 [...] Her answer she shall have, I undertake; [...] And thus an end of all dispute I make. [...] Try when you list; and you shall find, my lord, [...] It is not in our sex to break our word.[65] [...] We leave them here in this heroic strain, [...] 710 [...] And to the knight our story turns again; [...] Who in the garden, with his lovely May, [...] Sung merrier than the cuckoo or the jay: [...] This was his song; [...] "Oh kind and constant be, [...] Constant and kind I'll ever prove to thee." [...] 715 [...] Thus singing as he went, at last he drew [...] By easy steps, to where the pear-tree grew: [...] The longing dame looked up, and spied her love, [...] Full fairly perched among the boughs above. [...] She stopped, and sighing: Oh, good gods, she cried, [...] 720 [...] What pangs, what sudden shoots distend my side? [...] Oh for that tempting fruit, so fresh, so green; [...] Help, for the love of heav'n's immortal queen; [...] Help, dearest lord, and save at once the life [...] Of thy poor infant, and thy longing wife![66] [...] 725 [...] Sore sighed the knight to hear his lady's cry, [...] But could not climb, and had no servant nigh: [...] Old as he was, and void of eye-sight too, [...] What could, alas! a helpless husband do? [...] And must I languish then, she said, and die, [...] 730 [...] Yet view the lovely fruit before my eye? [...] At least, kind sir, for charity's sweet sake, [...] Vouchsafe the trunk between your arms to take; [...] Then from your back I might ascend the tree; [...] Do you but stoop, and leave the rest to me. [...] 735 [...] With all my soul, he thus replied again, [...] I'd spend my dearest blood to ease thy pain. [...] With that, his back against the trunk he bent, [...] She seized a twig, and up the tree she went. [...] Now prove your patience, gentle ladies all! [...] 740 [...] Nor let on me your heavy anger fall: [...] 'Tis truth I tell, though not in phrase refined, [...] Though blunt my tale, yet honest is my mind. [...] What feats the lady in the tree might do, [...] I pass as gambols never known to you; [...] 745 [...] But sure it was a merrier fit, she swore, [...] Than in her life she ever felt before. [...] In that nice moment, lo! the wond'ring knight [...] Looked out, and stood restored to sudden sight. [...] Straight on the tree his eager eyes he bent, [...] 750 [...] As one whose thoughts were on his spouse intent; [...] But when he saw his bosom-wife so dressed, [...] His rage was such as cannot be expressed: [...] Not frantic mothers when their infants die, [...] With louder clamours rend the vaulted sky: [...] 755 [...] He cried, he roared, he stormed, he tore his hair; [...] Death! hell! and furies! what dost thou do there! [...] What ails my lord? the trembling dame replied; [...] I thought your patience had been better tried; [...] Is this your love, ungrateful, and unkind, [...] 760 [...] This my reward for having cured the blind? [...] Why was I taught to make my husband see, [...] By struggling with a man upon a tree? [...] Did I for this the pow'r of magic prove? [...] Unhappy wife, whose crime was too much love! [...] 765 [...] If this be struggling, by this holy light, [...] 'Tis struggling with a vengeance, quoth the knight; [...] So heav'n preserve the sight it has restored, [...] As with these eyes I plainly saw thee whored; [...] Whored by my slave--perfidious wretch! may hell [...] 770 [...] As surely seize thee, as I saw too well. [...] Guard me, good angels! cried the gentle May, [...] Pray heav'n this magic work the proper way! [...] Alas, my love! 'tis certain, could you see, [...] You ne'er had used these killing words to me: [...] 775 [...] So help me, fates, as 'tis no perfect sight, [...] But some faint glimm'ring of a doubtful light. [...] What I have said, quoth he, I must maintain, [...] For by th' immortal pow'rs it seemed too plain. [...] By all those pow'rs, some frenzy seized your mind, } [...] 780 [...] Replied the dame, are these the thanks I find? [...] } [...] Wretch that I am, that e'er I was so kind! [...] } [...] She said; a rising sigh expressed her woe, [...] The ready tears apace began to flow, [...] And as they fell she wiped from either eye [...] 785 [...] The drops; for women, when they list, can cry. [...] The knight was touched; and in his looks appeared [...] Signs of remorse, while thus his spouse he cheered: [...] Madam, 'tis past, and my short anger o'er! [...] Come down, and vex your tender heart no more; [...] 790 [...] Excuse me, dear, if aught amiss was said, [...] For, on my soul, amends shall soon be made: [...] Let my repentance your forgiveness draw, [...] By heav'n, I swore but what I thought I saw. [...] Ah, my loved lord! 'twas much unkind, she cried, [...] 795 [...] On bare suspicion thus to treat your bride. [...] But till your sight's established, for awhile, [...] Imperfect objects may your sense beguile. [...] Thus when from sleep we first our eyes display, } [...] The balls are wounded with the piercing ray, [...] } [...] 800 [...] And dusky vapours rise, and intercept the day: } [...] So just recov'ring from the shades of night, [...] } [...] Your swimming eyes are drunk with sudden light, [...] } [...] Strange phantoms dance around, and skim before your sight. } [...] Then, sir, be cautious, nor too rashly deem; [...] 805 [...] Heav'n knows how seldom things are what they seem! [...] Consult your reason, and you soon shall find [...] 'Twas you were jealous, not your wife unkind: [...] Jove ne'er spoke oracle more true than this, [...] None judge so wrong as those who think amiss. [...] 810 [...] With that she leaped into her lord's embrace [...] With well-dissembled virtue in her face. [...] He hugged her close, and kissed her o'er and o'er, [...] Disturbed with doubts and jealousies no more: [...] Both, pleased and blessed, renewed their mutual vows, [...] 815 [...] A fruitful wife and a believing spouse. [...] Thus ends our tale, whose moral next to make, [...] Let all wise husbands hence example take; [...] And pray, to crown the pleasure of their lives, [...] To be so well deluded by their wives.[67] [...] 820 ...|$|R
