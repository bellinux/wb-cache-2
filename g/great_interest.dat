5|$|New Guinea, writes Wallace, {{is mostly}} unknown, {{with only the}} {{wildlife}} of the northwestern peninsula partially explored, but already 250 land birds are known, making the island of <b>great</b> <b>interest.</b> There are few mammals, mostly marsupials, including a kangaroo (first seen by Le Brun in 1714).|$|E
5|$|Sir Malcolm Campbell, {{and later}} his son Donald, used R engines from 1931 to 1951. At Sir Malcolm's knighthood {{ceremony}} in February 1931, King George V expressed <b>great</b> <b>interest</b> in the R and asked {{many questions about}} its fuel consumption and performance.|$|E
5|$|The first {{director}} of STScI, Riccardo Giacconi, announced in 1986 {{that he intended}} to devote some of his director discretionary time to allowing amateur astronomers to use the telescope.

5|$|The {{overwhelming}} probability is {{that the}} next supernova observed in the Milky Way will originate from an unknown white dwarf or anonymous red supergiant, very likely not even {{visible to the naked}} eye. Nevertheless, the prospect of a supernova originating from an object as extreme, nearby, and well-studied as Eta Carinae arouses <b>great</b> <b>interest.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} <b>great</b> <b>interest</b> in human evolution. Neanderthal fossils were {{discovered}} in 1856, {{but at the time}} it was not clear that they represented a different species from modern humans. Eugene Dubois created a sensation with his discovery of Java Man, the first fossil evidence of a species that seemed clearly intermediate between humans and apes, in 1891.|$|E
5|$|Although Clinch {{believed}} that the evidence pointed to the twins having genuinely existed but that they {{had lived in the}} 16th century, rather than the early 12th century as generally claimed, they are not mentioned in any journals or books from the period. This points against their having lived in the 16th century; the case of Lazarus and Joannes Baptista Colloredo (1617– after1646) had prompted <b>great</b> <b>interest</b> in conjoined twins, and conjoined sisters surviving to adulthood in south east England would have been widely noted.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{possibility}} of subsurface liquid oceans on Jupiter's moons Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, there has been <b>great</b> <b>interest</b> in studying the icy moons in detail. Funding difficulties have delayed progress. The Europa Orbiter was a planned NASA mission to Europa, which was canceled in 2002. Its main objectives included determining {{the presence or absence of}} a subsurface ocean and identifying candidate sites for future lander missions. NASA's JIMO (Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter), which was canceled in 2005, and a European Jovian Europa Orbiter mission were also studied, but were superseded by the Europa Jupiter System Mission.|$|E
5|$|Following its capture, Java {{was under}} British {{administration}} from 1811 to 1816. The appointed governor was Lieutenant Governor-General Thomas Stamford Raffles, who took <b>great</b> <b>interest</b> {{in the history}} of Java. He collected Javanese antiques and made notes through contacts with local inhabitants during his tour throughout the island. On an inspection tour to Semarang in 1814, he was informed about a big monument deep in a jungle near the village of Bumisegoro. He was not able to make the discovery himself and sent H.C. Cornelius, a Dutch engineer, to investigate.|$|E
5|$|Grijalva's return aroused <b>great</b> <b>interest</b> in Cuba, and Yucatán was {{believed}} to be a land of riches waiting to be plundered. A new expedition was organised, with a fleet of eleven ships carrying 500 men and some horses. Hernán Cortés was placed in command, and his crew included officers that would become famous conquistadors, including Pedro de Alvarado, Cristóbal de Olid, Gonzalo de Sandoval and Diego de Ordaz. Also aboard were Francisco de Montejo and Bernal Díaz del Castillo, veterans of the Grijalva expedition.|$|E

5|$|In 1811, {{when the}} Parisian saltpetre {{manufacturer}} Bernard Courtois made iodine {{for the first}} time from the kelp ash, his discovery was greeted with <b>great</b> <b>interest</b> by experts. Accum was among the first chemists in England to undertake experiments to isolate iodine. In two articles published in Tilloch's Philosophical Journal in January and February 1814, Accum described the iodine content of different kinds of seaweed and gave a detailed account of a process for iodine production.|$|E
5|$|In 1852, Great Britain {{made her}} first voyage to Melbourne, Australia, {{carrying}} 630 emigrants. She excited <b>great</b> <b>interest</b> there, with 4,000 people paying a shilling each to inspect her. She operated on the England–Australia route for almost 30 years, interrupted only by two relatively brief sojourns as a troopship during the Crimean War and the Indian Mutiny. Gradually, {{she earned a}} reputation as the most reliable of the emigrant ships to Australia and carried the first English cricket team to tour Australia in 1861.|$|E
5|$|Luang Pu Sodh had a <b>great</b> <b>interest</b> to {{introduce}} Dhammakaya meditation outside of Thailand. Wat Paknam already published international magazines and leaflets {{in the time}} Kapilavaddho, his first Western student, started living {{under the guidance of}} Luang Pu Sodh. The periodical of the temple was in both Thai and English, and at certain occasions booklets would be published in Chinese as well. In old periodicals of the temple visits from high-standing monks from Japan and China have been recorded, and Dhammakaya meditation is still passed on by Japanese Shingon Buddhists that used to practice at Wat Paknam.|$|E
50|$|Subject neural {{patterns}} (brain waves) can {{be recorded}} using BCI devices; currently, use of non-invasive devices, specifically the EEG, is of <b>greater</b> <b>interest</b> to researchers than invasive and partially invasive types. This is because non-invasive types pose the least risk to subject health; EEG's have attracted the <b>greatest</b> <b>interest</b> because they {{offer the most}} user-friendly approach {{in addition to having}} far less complex instrumentation than that of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI’s), another commonly used non-invasive BCI.|$|R

5|$|Matter falling onto {{a compact}} object {{is one of}} the most {{efficient}} mechanisms for releasing energy in the form of radiation, and matter falling onto black holes is thought to be responsible for some of the brightest astronomical phenomena imaginable. Notable examples of <b>great</b> <b>interest</b> to astronomers are quasars and other types of active galactic nuclei. Under the right conditions, falling matter accumulating around a black hole can lead to the formation of jets, in which focused beams of matter are flung away into space at speeds near that of light.|$|E
5|$|The Manasollasa {{has been}} called an {{important}} source on socio-cultural history of medieval India, particularly {{for the history of}} food, drinks and cuisines and of sports. Mandakranta Bose, a professor on South Asian studies, describes the text to be of <b>great</b> <b>interest</b> because it is the earliest known text with details on dance genres in India. A team consisting of Bruno Nettl, a professor of music and anthropology, has called Manasollasa an enormous treatise with large sections on music, dance and other performance arts.|$|E
5|$|The {{assimilation}} was not {{as strongly}} implemented in the German dominions of Swedish Pomerania, Bremen-Verden, and the Baltic dominions (Estonia and Livonia). In Germany, Charles found himself being opposed by the Estates there. He was also bound by {{the law of the}} German emperor and the peace treaty. In the Baltic, the power structure was completely different, with a German-descended nobility that used serfs, something that Charles abhorred and wanted to abolish but was unable to. Finally, Kexholm and Ingria were sparsely populated and not of <b>great</b> <b>interest.</b>|$|E

5|$|The survey {{continued}} {{to the south}} in Patagonia. They stopped at Bahía Blanca, and in cliffs near Punta Alta Darwin made a major find of fossil bones of huge extinct mammals beside modern seashells, indicating recent extinction with no signs of change in climate or catastrophe. He identified the little-known Megatherium by a tooth and its association with bony armour, which had at first seemed to him {{to be like a}} giant version of the armour on local armadillos. The finds brought <b>great</b> <b>interest</b> when they reached England.|$|E
5|$|Though Parry had a <b>great</b> <b>interest</b> in music, {{he had no}} {{opportunity}} to study it until there was a temporary closure of the Rough and Ready Iron Works. Some of his co-workers were also musicians, and they offered music lessons while the iron works was closed. Parry joined a music sight-reading class taught {{by one of the}} men. He continued to study harmony with another co-worker, and learned how to read and write while he was learning about harmony.|$|E
5|$|Verville {{was born}} in Atlantic Mine, {{a small town in}} Michigan's Upper Peninsula, on November 16, 1890, as the son of Victor Verville and Fabianna Miron. As a child, his mother bought him a Conyne-style box kite from Sears Roebuck, which {{captured}} his imagination and started his interest in flight and aviation. Verville also began reading stories about the Wright Brothers in newspapers and magazines with <b>great</b> <b>interest.</b> Later he even wrote to the Wrights and Glenn Curtiss and received responses.|$|E
