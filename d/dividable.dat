The theme of this thesis is a characterization of constructible complexes in terms of their face posets, and the relation between constructibility and partitionability. After reviewing some preliminaries on posets and complexes in Chapter 2, the property of constructible complexes is studied in Chapter 3.

40|$|Abstract. In {{conventional}} speech processing, researchers adopt a di-vidable assumption, {{that the}} speech utterance {{can be divided}} into non-overlapping feature sequences and each segment represents an acoustic event or a label. And the probability of a label sequence on an utter-ance approximates to the probability of the best utterance segmentation for this label sequence. But in the real case, feature sequences of acous-tic events may be overlapped partially, especially for the neighboring phonemes within a syllable. And the best segmentation approximation even reinforces the distortion by the <b>dividable</b> assumption. In this pa-per, we propose an all-path decoding algorithm, which can fuse the in-formation obtained by different segmentations (or paths) without paying obvious computation load, so the weakness of the <b>dividable</b> assumption could be alleviated. Our experiments show, the new decoding algorithm can improve the system performance effectively in tasks with heavy in-sertion and deletion errors. ...|$|E

30|$|The Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), {{commonly}} refered to as ‘deprivation level’ here, is a floating-point number {{assigned to}} each LSOA. When a road segment had a single LSOA, we thus assigned it the deprivation level of its LSOA. For boundary roads assigned to two LSOAs, we could not assume that their deprivation would be more like one LSOA or the other, and thus we assigned them the average deprivation level of the two LSOAs. As in previous analyses of the fast-food outlets in England with respect to deprivation [38], we simplified the (continuous) deprivation level into tertiles. The first tertile contains deprivation levels up to 11.92 (included), the second tertile contains deprivation levels from 11.92 (excluded) to 24.845 (included), and the third tertile contains deprivation levels strictly greater than 24.845.

40|$|Attribute {{reduction}} {{is one of}} the challenging problems facing the effective application of computational intelligence technology for artificial intelligence. Its task is to eliminate dispensable attributes and search for a feature subset that possesses the same classification capacity as that of the original attribute set. To accomplish efficient attribute reduction, many heuristic search algorithms have been developed. Most of them are based on the model that the approximation of all the target concepts associated with a decision system is <b>dividable</b> into that of a single target concept represented by a pair of definable concepts known as lower and upper approximations. This paper proposes a novel model called macroscopic approximation, considering all the target concepts as an indivisible whole to be approximated by rough set boundary region derived from inconsistent tolerance blocks, as well as an efficient approximation framework called positive macroscopic approximation (PMA), addressing macroscopic approximations with respect to a series of attribute subsets.

Therefore, the flow region is <b>dividable</b> and eight vortices occur in a duct flow. The theoretical and experimental {{results show that the}} division line, separating the neighboring secondary currents in a corner, is not always identical to the bisector of the corner, but deviates from the corner bisector if the aspect ratio is b/h = 1. By simplifying Reynolds equation in the near-bed region, we find that theoretically a lateral variation of streamwise velocity initiates the wall-tangent flow that drives the vortex in the region bounded by zero total shear stress. A simplified method for estimating the vortex center, near-bed secondary velocity, and shape of secondary currents has been proposed, and a good agreement between the measured and predicted features is achieved...|$|E
