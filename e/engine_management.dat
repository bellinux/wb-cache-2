40|$|Engine {{simulation}} model / virtual engine building {{is one of}} the important aspects towards development of <b>engine</b> health <b>management</b> system. In the present work, an attempt has been made to develop {{simulation model}} for a typical twin spool turbo jet engine using commercially available Gas turbine Simulation Program (GSP). The engine simulation model has been used for aero-thermodynamic gas path performance analysis related to engine run at design point (ISA conditions), off design points (test-bed ambient condition) and Accelerated-Deceleration Cycles(ADC) at ISA conditions. Simulation results have been compared with sample test bed data for the purpose of validation. This document describes in detail the procedure for engine simulation model development using GSP. Predicted results show good correlation with experimental test-bed data. The engine simulation model can further be used to simulate several fault conditions leading to data generation required for <b>engine</b> health <b>management</b> system development.

40|$|Abstract: For {{the four}} {{processes}} of aero <b>engine</b> health <b>management,</b> which {{are composed of}} condition monitoring, diag-nostics, prognostics and prescriptive action, a four-layer architecture of aero <b>engine</b> health <b>management</b> divided into data layer, transaction layer, decision layer and users layer, is designed based on multi-agent. Corresponding to the function of each layer, six agent roles are defined, such as condition monitoring, information fusion, fault diagnosis, task consultation, rules management and human-computer interaction. FIPA ACL (Agent Communication Language) is the foundation for multi-agent interaction. The various steps involved in developing a multi-agent system using JADE (Java Agent Devel-opment Framework) are discussed. This paper provides theoretical conception for intelligent monitoring and intelligent fault diagnosis of aero engine, and for further research of multi-agent collaboration on multi-agent system...|$|R

25|$|In an <b>Engine</b> <b>Management</b> System (EMS), {{electronics}} control {{fuel delivery}} and ignition timing. Primary sensors {{on the system}} are crankshaft angle (crankshaft or Top Dead Center (TDC) position), airflow into the engine and throttle position. The circuitry determines which cylinder needs fuel and how much, opens the requisite injector to deliver it, then causes a spark {{at the right moment}} to burn it. Early EMS systems used an analogue computer to accomplish this, but as embedded systems dropped in price and became fast enough {{to keep up with the}} changing inputs at high revolutions, digital systems started to appear.|$|E
25|$|For {{model year}} 1999 a minor {{facelift}} was introduced. Apart from very minor cosmetic changes like the square XC-style roof rails replacing the rounded version {{and a slightly}} changed logo for the front grill, it concentrated on the mechanicals. Volvo introduced dual stage frontal airbag deployment logic and its second generation side airbag which was increased in volume to offer better protection. WHIPS was also introduced {{as part of the}} standard equipment. New <b>engine</b> <b>management</b> systems with drive-by-wire throttle replaced the mechanical throttle on turbo models and an upgraded traction control now called STC was introduced. The ABS was upgraded from a three-channel to a four-channel system, while all-wheel drive models received thicker rear discs and redesigned rear calipers. The 4-speed automatic transmissions were upgraded to adaptive shift logic.|$|E
25|$|For the 1991 model year, Mexico enacted new-vehicle {{emission}} regulations {{similar to}} those in the U.S. and Canada. The carbureted leaded-fuel engine was too dirty to comply with the new regulations, so a fully integrated <b>engine</b> <b>management</b> system with fuel injection was added to the Spirit. This was not the TBI system used in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. Rather, the Mexican-market Spirits came with a more advanced MPFI setup. The MPFI 2.5 improved performance and driveability, as well as achieved cleaner emissions than its TBI counterpart, but was not used in the U.S., Canadian, or rest-of-world export markets except on turbocharged and FFV models. The Chrysler Spirit with MPFI 2.5L engine was sold in Mexico from 1991 through 1995, and was exported to Argentina and Brazil from 1993 through 1995. It was employed by the Argentine police in Buenos Aires.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Trust {{can be used}} {{to measure}} our {{confidence}} that a secure system behaves as expected. We had previously proposed a vector model of trust [1]. In this work we address the problem of trust management using the vector model. We develop a new trust <b>management</b> <b>engine</b> which we call VTrust (from Vector Trust). The trust <b>management</b> <b>engine</b> stores and manages current as well as historical information about different parameters that define a trust relation between a truster and a trustee. We propose an SQL like language called TrustQL to interact with the trust <b>management</b> <b>engine.</b> TrustQL consists of a Trust Definition Language (TDL) that is used to define a trust relationship and a Trust Manipulation Language (TML) that is used to query and update information about trust relationships. ...|$|R
