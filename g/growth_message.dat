40|$|Abstract—Deliberate {{practice}} {{is important in}} many areas, including learning to program computers. However, beliefs {{about the nature of}} personal traits, known as mindsets, can have a profound impact on such practice. Previous research has shown that those with a fixed mindset believe their traits cannot change and tend to reduce their level of practice when they encounter difficulty. In contrast, those with the growth mindset believe their traits are flexible and tend to maintain regular practice despite the level of difficulty. However, focusing on mindset as a single construct focused on intelligence may not be appropriate in the field of computer programming. Exploring this notion, a self-belief survey was distributed to undergraduate software engineering students. It was revealed that beliefs about intelligence and programming aptitude formed two distinct constructs. Furthermore, the mindset for programming aptitude had greater utility in predicting software development practice and a follow-up survey showed that it became more fixed throughout instruction. Thus, educators should consider the role of programming-specific beliefs in the design and evaluation of introductory courses in software engineering. Particularly, the need to situate and contextualize the <b>growth</b> <b>messages</b> that motivate students who experience early setbacks...|$|R

The growth mindset intervention halted the students’ decline in grades and started the students on a new pathway of improvement and high achievement” (Boaler, 2013). Educational systems focusing on creating a growth mindset environment allows for girls to feel like their intelligence is moldable rather than constant.|$|R

We present a generative phylogenetic model for automatically inducing cognate group structure from unaligned word lists. Our model represents the process of transformation and transmission from ancestor word to daughter word, {{as well as the}} alignment between the words lists of the observed languages. We also present a novel method for simplifying complex weighted automata created during inference to counteract the otherwise exponential <b>growth</b> of <b>message</b> sizes. On the task of identifying cognates in a dataset of Romance words, our model significantly outperforms a baseline approach, increasing accuracy by as much as 80 %. Finally, we demonstrate that our automatically induced groups can be used to successfully reconstruct ancestral words. ...|$|R

30|$|Various {{types of}} {{information}} and communication technologies have been trialled, aiming primarily to support emergency response planning [3]. Recent approaches [4] have started to address coordination during the emergency response execution phase through situation awareness, i.e., the ability to identify, process, and comprehend the critical elements of information about what is happening to the emergency response team with regards to the mission. Such approaches realise that most emergency responders are mobile, hence support technologies must explicitly address the mobility aspect, through location and context-aware messaging. However, use of mobile messaging in emergency response might not be without any pitfalls, as evidenced by symptoms of information overload, fatigue and anxiety, caused by the rapid <b>growth</b> of <b>messaging</b> in recent years, both on the Internet and through telephony [5]. As a result, managing and controlling the large volumes of electronic message flows is now a major commercial and research endeavour [6].

40|$|Abstract. Glycans {{of natural}} glycoconjugates are con-sidered {{as a source}} of {{biological}} information relevant to cell adhesion or <b>growth.</b> Sugar-based <b>messages</b> are decoded and translated into responses by endogenous lectins. This mechanism assigns a func tional dimen-sion to tumour-associated changes of glycosylation. Conse quently, it calls for mapping the lectin presence in tumours. Such an analysis has so far com monly been performed with the scope to determine expres-sion of a few dis tinct proteins, e. g. from the effector family of galectins with focus on galectins- 1 and- 3. Due to the emerging evidence for functional di-vergence among galectins it is timely to address the challenge to evaluate their presence beyond these few family members. Having raised a panel of non-cross [...] reactive antibodies against seven human galectins covering all three subfamilies, we de scribe their expres-sion profiles in human skin. Comparison of normal and ma lignant tissues enabled us to de fine galectin-type-dependent alterations, arguing in favour of dis-tinct function alities.

Finally, we show that teenagers encounter three problems when text messaging: understanding evolving language, determining intent from content, and addressing messages...|$|R

The results point to a striking pattern: the status of being an outsourcer matters strongly for indigenous non-exporters, while for exporters and foreign affiliates, tfp increases are lower, insignificant and sometimes negative. On the other hand, a higher intensity of outsourcing matters for both exporters and foreign affiliates, but not for indigenous non-exporters. Similarly, in dynamic analysis, indigenous non-exporters are found to increase tfp for two periods after entering into international outsourcing, while indigenous exporters experience one more weakly significant period of <b>growth.</b> The key <b>message</b> of the paper is thus: outsourcing 2 ̆ 7 s role as a channel of technology diffusion is most pronounced when it serves as a first exposure to international markets...|$|R

The third plan expressed what should be called the social turn of science and technology policy in Japan; the fourth Plan was supposed to reach a step further by including a Japanese version of a fourth helix.|$|R
40|$|Chatbots are {{the text}} based {{conversational}} agents with which users interact in natural language. They {{are becoming more}} and more popular with the immense <b>growth</b> in <b>messaging</b> apps and tools to develop text based conversational agents. Despite of advances in Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing, chatbots still struggle in accurately understanding user requests, thus providing wrong answers or no response. An effective solution to tackle this problem is involving human's capabilities in chatbot’s operations for understanding user requests. There are many existing systems using humans in chatbots but they are not capable to scale up with the increasing number of users. To address this problem, we provide insights in how to design such chatbot system having humans in the loop and how to involve humans efficiently. We perform an extensive literature survey about chatbots, and human computation applied for a chatbot, to guide the design of our reference chatbot system. Then we address the problem of cold starting chatbot systems. We propose a methodology to generate high quality training data, with which, chatbot’s Natural Language Understanding (NLU) model can be trained, making a chatbot capable of handling user requests efficiently at run time. Finally we provide a methodology to estimate the reliability of black box NLU models based on the confidence threshold of their prediction functionality.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the consistency and scalability {{behavior of a}} soft-state signaling protocol. Soft-state is state that has a predefined validity period. A soft-state protocol is a signaling approach in which soft-states are periodically refreshed by the receipt of a message indicating a new validity period and possibly a new value. Unrefreshed state eventually expires and recovers {{as soon as a}} subsequent refresh message is received. This protocol is widely used in distributed systems where components need {{to keep track of the}} state of other components. Within such a system, the state consistency is affected by many parameters, some given by the environment while others are tunable. The environment parameters are the loss probability and latency of the channel between the endpoints, and the change rate of the source state. The tunable parameters are the refresh period and timeout period. In this study, we dissect the overall system inconsistency into false-positive and false-negative cases, address the tradeoff between the two, and analyze their sensitivity towards parameter changes. In the end, we identify the necessary measures to optimize each of them. Our results show that false-positive ratio can be optimized by using a state cancellation mechanism, whilst the false-negative ratio can be optimized by specifying the timeout period as a function of the other parameters. Moreover, we study the systempsilas scalability behavior by observing the <b>growth</b> of <b>messages</b> overhead that is needed to keep inconsistency ratio constant as the channelpsilas loss probability increases...|$|R
