25|$|Devil's Due Publishing and Image Comics {{introduced}} new elements into Snake Eyes' past {{during their}} Snake Eyes Declassified miniseries, which {{show more of}} Cobra Commander's motivation to kill Snake Eyes while training to become a ninja. Snake Eyes had an encounter with Cobra Commander prior {{to the formation of}} Cobra, where Cobra Commander befriended Snake <b>Eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> recruit him into murdering a judge. The judge had convicted Cobra Commander's older brother of arson and insurance fraud, resulting in the ruin of his brother's life, causing his spiral downward into alcoholism, and ultimately the car accident that claimed both his life and the lives of Snake Eyes' family. Snake Eyes agreed to accompany Cobra Commander, but at the last minute refused {{to go along with the}} plan. Cobra Commander then killed the judge, and swore revenge against Snake Eyes, resulting in him hiring Firefly (who in turn subcontracted Zartan) to kill Snake Eyes while he was training with the Arashikage Clan.|$|E

60|$|A sudden {{illuminating}} {{flash of}} horror {{told her the}} truth. She closed her <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> run from the room.|$|E
6000|$|... "Whether Frascatti {{is right}} or not," [...] said Patsy, drying her <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> be brave, [...] "we ought to search for Uncle John at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, John," [...] she said. The spaniel John, {{showing the}} whites of his <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> back through his collar, was {{assisted}} from the room. Mr. Pendyce {{closed the door behind}} them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{you must}} not talk any more, Cuthbert. Your hands are cold, let me put the rug over them. There, you look more comfortable. Now shut your <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> get to sleep until the doctor comes round." ...|$|R
60|$|A sound {{suspiciously like}} a giggle {{came from the}} landing and fell heavily on Gale's ears. He closed his <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> think.|$|E
60|$|The Hoppers {{looked at}} one another questioningly and blinked their <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> think what it all meant; but they couldn't figure it out.|$|E
60|$|As if {{compelled}} {{against her}} will--answering to an irresistible voice--Bess raised her head, {{looked at him}} with sad, dark <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> whisper with tremulous lips.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a harness}} store we found {{ourselves}} in, and he fixed me up a couch of horse blankets in the private office well to the rear. To add to my wretchedness a splitting headache was coming on, and I was only too glad <b>to</b> close my <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> sleep.|$|R
60|$|He {{closed his}} <b>eyes</b> impatiently, <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> shut her {{out in a}} {{darkness}} of his own making.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{daguerreotype}} likeness, do you mean?" [...] asked Phoebe {{with less}} reserve; for, {{in spite of}} prejudice, her own youthfulness sprang forward to meet his. [...] "I don't much like pictures of that sort,--they are so hard and stern; besides dodging away from the <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> escape altogether. They are conscious of looking very unamiable, I suppose, and therefore hate to be seen." ...|$|R
6000|$|I dried my <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> look {{steadily}} at her. 'Yes, Lady Georgina,' I faltered. 'You {{need not}} be afraid. I have refused him; and I mean it.' ...|$|E
60|$|Charlie ran in again, {{seized a}} coil of rope, bound {{his hands and}} feet securely, and dragged him into the hut. Then he dashed some cold water on his face. The man opened his <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> move.|$|E
60|$|So it was settled, and the German {{proceeded}} {{to make himself}} and the others as comfortable as possible. He prepared something to eat, and suggested that Tom be given a little broth, made out of some dried meat. This was done, and presently the sufferer opened his <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> sit up.|$|E
5000|$|One {{player is}} chosen as [...] "It". This player closes {{his or her}} <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> find <b>and</b> tag the other players {{without the use of}} vision. The player who is [...] "It" [...] shouts [...] "Marco" [...] and the other players must respond by {{shouting}} [...] "Polo", which [...] "It" [...] uses <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> acoustically locate them. If a player is tagged, then that player becomes [...] "It." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, by {{this time}} {{we were on the}} peacefullest of terms. When I saw that he wasn't after Miss Willella, I had more endurable contemplations of that sandy-haired snoozer. In order to help out the ambitions of his {{appetite}} I kept on <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> get that receipt from Miss Willella. But every time I would say 'pancakes' she would get sort of remote and fidgety about the <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> change the subject. If I held her to it she would slide out and round up Uncle Emsley with his pitcher of water and hip-pocket howitzer.|$|R
60|$|Through {{the dust}} and smoke of ages, and through the centuries of wars we strain our <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> gain a glimpse of thee, Master, in thy good days, when the Muses walked with thee. We seem to mark thee {{wandering}} silent through some little village, or dreaming in the woods, or loitering among thy lonely places, or in gardens where the roses blossom among wilder flowers, or on river banks where the whispering poplars and sighing reeds make answer to the murmur of the waters. Such a picture hast thou drawn of thyself in the summer afternoons.|$|R
6000|$|Kemp had hurried upstairs after letting Adye out, and now {{crouching}} {{among the}} broken glass and peering cautiously {{over the edge of}} the study window sill, he saw Adye stand parleying with the Unseen. [...] "Why doesn't he fire?" [...] whispered Kemp to himself. Then the revolver moved a little and the glint of the sunlight flashed in Kemp's eyes. He shaded his <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> see the source of the blinding beam.|$|E
60|$|Then, all at once, {{the coolness}} {{of the morning}} air caught her full in the face. She opened her <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> move, but those {{powerful}} arms held her more closely than before. Now she could have shrieked with horror. With returning consciousness the sense of her desperate position came on her with its full and ghastly significance, its awe-inspiring details. The grey dawn, the abandoned wretch who held her, and the stillness of this early morning hour, when not one pitying soul would be astir to lend her a helping hand or give her the solace of mute sympathy. So great, indeed, was this stillness that the click of the man's sabots upon the uneven pavement reverberated, ghoul-like and weird.|$|E
6000|$|Such prayers avail much, {{and such}} entire devotion often {{seems to work}} miracles when other aids are in vain. Phebe's cry was answered, her self-forgetful task accomplished, and her long vigil rewarded with a happy dawn. Dr. Alec always said that she kept him alive {{by the force of}} her will, and that, during the hours when he seemed to lie unconscious, he felt a strong, warm hand holding his, as if keeping him away from the swift current trying to sweep him away. The happiest hour of all her life was that in which he knew her, looked up with the shadow of a smile in his hollow <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> say in his old cheery way: [...] "Tell Rose I've turned the corner, thanks to you, my child." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Morcombe family {{started the}} [...] "Daniel Morcombe Foundation", and put its {{resources}} into keeping Morcombe's disappearance {{in the public}} <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> {{find out what happened}} to their son. The foundation is committed to educating children about personal safety and to raising awareness throughout Australia of the dangers of predatory criminals. These efforts are supported by the Australian media, especially on each anniversary of Morcombe's disappearance when a [...] "Day for Daniel" [...] is held to promote awareness of the vulnerability of children. An accompanying event is the [...] "Ride for Daniel", which covers 50 km of the Sunshine Coast, held each year since 2005.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no, dear, you haven't. You {{are always}} full of consideration. But I have noticed it with mother, {{and with others}} also. The husband pulls out his {{cheque-book}} {{at the end of}} the week or month, and he says, [...] "Well, this is rather more than we can afford," [...] or [...] "This is less than I expected," [...] but he never really takes any interest in his wife's efforts to keep things nice on a little. He does not see it with her <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> realise her difficulties. Oh, I wish I could express myself better, but I know that the interest is one- sided.' ...|$|R
50|$|One {{member from}} a team chooses a song to sing while being blindfolded. During {{the time they are}} singing, the guest must take our their tongue {{from time to time to}} lick sauces that Harlem and Patrick give them. After the song ended, the guest uncovers their <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> recall as many sauces as possible. Each correct guess would earn the team $500 HK. In {{addition}} to earning cash from guessing the sauces, Harlem would judge how well the guest sang on a scale of 0-10. With 10 being the highest, whatever score he gives the guest is multiply by $1000 HK. The maximum amount of cash the guest can get from singing is $10000 HK.|$|R
60|$|I don't {{often go}} to the theatre, but when I do I {{like one of those}} plays with some ginger in them which the papers {{generally}} cuss. The papers say that real human beings don't carry on in that way. Take it from me, mister, they do. I seen a feller on the stage read a letter once which didn't just suit him; and he gasped and rolled his <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> say something and couldn't, and had to get a hold on a chair to keep him from falling. There was a piece in the paper saying that this was all wrong, and that he wouldn't of done them things in real life. Believe me, the paper was wrong. There wasn't a thing that feller did that Andy didn't do when he read that letter.|$|E
60|$|I {{turned and}} crept to where Tota lay {{by the side}} of Indaba-zimbi. It was {{impossible}} to say if they were dead or swooning. The lady sprinkled Tota's face with the water, which I watched greedily, for my thirst was still awful, while the woman Hendrika did the same office for Indaba-zimbi. Presently, to my vast delight, Tota opened her <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> cry, but could not, poor little thing, because her tongue and lips were so swollen. But the lady got some water into her mouth, and, as in my case, the effect was magical. We allowed her to drink {{about a quarter of a}} pint, and no more, though she cried bitterly for it. Just then old Indaba-zimbi came to with a groan. He opened his eyes, glanced round, and took in the situation.|$|E
60|$|At first, when {{he opened}} his eyes, he fancied, from the sound of water in his ears, that it must have come on to rain very heavily, but, being {{regardless}} of rain, he tried to fall asleep again. Then he felt as if there must be a leak in his berth somewhere, he was so wet; but, being sleepy, he shut his <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> shut his senses against moisture. Not succeeding, he resolved to turn on his other side, but experienced a strange resistance to that effort. Waxing testy, he wrenched himself round, and in so doing kicked out somewhat impatiently. This, of course, woke him up to the real state of the case. It also awoke Slagg, who received the kick on his shins. He, delivering a cry of pain straight into Sam Shipton's ear, caused that youth to fling out his fist, which fell on Stumps's nose, and thus in rapid succession were the sleepers roused effectually to a full sense of their condition.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must not}} talk, indeed you mustn't," [...] she said, facing round again. [...] "I am sure the doctor must {{have told you}} to keep {{perfectly}} quiet. If you are quiet and good, I will come to you very often, but if not I shall hand you over {{to the charge of}} another nurse. I blame myself for asking you any questions. Indeed I am quite in earnest; you are not fit to talk; the slightest movement might possibly set your wound off bleeding; besides you are not strong enough; it is an effort to you, and the great thing is for you to be perfectly quiet and tranquil. Now shut your <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> doze off again." ...|$|R
50|$|In the evening, Brodie meets Zakk in {{a repair}} shop {{to tell him}} what {{happened}} where they are attacked by Zakk's father. The latter acts as if possessed, tears out his own <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> then <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> kill them, but the two manage to defend themselves and kill him.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1800s, Hermann Helmholtz, a German {{physician}} and physicist, extensively researched conscious sensations and {{different types of}} perception [...] He defined sensations as the [...] "raw elements" [...] of conscious experience that required no learning, and perceptions as the meaningful interpretations derived from the senses. He studied the physical properties of the <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> vision, as well as acoustic sensation. In one of his classic experiments regarding how space perception could be altered by experience, participants wore glasses that distorted the visual field by several degrees to the right. Participants were asked to look at an object, close their <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> reach out <b>and</b> touch it. At first, the subjects reached for the object {{too far to the}} left, but after a few trials were able to correct themselves.|$|R
60|$|One day, when I came to {{the little}} thicket on the cliff where I used to lie and watch the nest through my glass, I found that one eaglet was gone. The other stood {{on the edge of}} the nest, looking down fearfully into the abyss, whither, no doubt, his bolder nest mate had flown, and calling disconsolately from time to time. His whole {{attitude}} showed plainly that he was hungry and cross and lonesome. Presently the mother-eagle came swiftly up from the valley, and there was food in her talons. She {{came to the}} edge of the nest, hovered over it a moment, so as to give the hungry eaglet a sight and smell of food, then went slowly down to the valley, taking the food with her, telling the little one in her own way to come and he should have it. He called after her loudly from the edge of the nest, and spread his wings a dozen times to follow. But the plunge was too awful; his heart failed him; and he settled back in the nest, and pulled his head down into his shoulders, and shut his <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> forget that he was hungry. The meaning of the little comedy was plain enough. She was trying to teach him to fly, telling him that his wings were grown and the time was come to use them; but he was afraid.|$|E
6000|$|The {{next morning}} was sultry, and the air, usually so fresh at those altitudes, was oppressively heavy. Rowland lounged {{on the grass}} a while, near Singleton, who was at work under his white umbrella, within view of the house; and then in quest of coolness he wandered away to the rocky ridge whence you looked across at the Jungfrau. To-day, however, the white summits were invisible; their heads were muffled in sullen clouds and the valleys beneath them curtained in dun-colored mist. Rowland had a book in his pocket, {{and he took it}} out and opened it. But his page {{remained}} unturned; his own thoughts were more importunate. His interview with Christina Light had made a great impression upon him, and he was haunted with the memory of her almost blameless bitterness, and of all that was tragic and fatal in her latest transformation. These things were immensely appealing, and Rowland thought with infinite impatience of Roderick's having again encountered them. It required little imagination to apprehend that the young sculptor's condition had also appealed to Christina. His consummate indifference, his supreme defiance, would make him a magnificent trophy, and Christina had announced with sufficient distinctness that she had said good-by to scruples. It was her fancy at present to treat the world as a garden of pleasure, and if, hitherto, she had played with Roderick's passion on its stem, there was little doubt that now she would pluck it with an unfaltering hand and drain it of its acrid sweetness. And why the deuce need Roderick have gone marching back to destruction? Rowland's meditations, even when they began in rancor, often brought him peace; but on this occasion they ushered in a quite peculiar quality of unrest. He felt conscious of a sudden collapse in his moral energy; a current that had been flowing for two years with liquid strength seemed at last to pause and evaporate. Rowland looked away at the stagnant vapors on the mountains; their dreariness seemed a symbol of the dreariness which his own generosity had bequeathed him. At last he had arrived at the uttermost limit of the deference a sane man might pay to other people's folly; nay, rather, he had transgressed it; he had been befooled on a gigantic scale. He turned to his book and tried to woo back patience, but it gave him cold comfort and he tossed it angrily away. He pulled his hat over his <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> wonder, dispassionately, whether atmospheric conditions had not something to do with his ill-humor. He remained for some time in this attitude, but was finally aroused from it by a singular sense that, although he had heard nothing, some one had approached him. He looked up and saw Roderick standing before him on the turf. His mood made the spectacle unwelcome, {{and for a moment he}} felt like uttering an uncivil speech. Roderick stood looking at him with an expression of countenance which had of late become rare. There was an unfamiliar spark in his eye and a certain imperious alertness in his carriage. Confirmed habit, with Rowland, came speedily to the front. [...] "What is it now?" [...] he asked himself, and invited Roderick to sit down. Roderick had evidently something particular to say, and if he remained silent for a time it was not because he was ashamed of it.|$|E
6000|$|Was {{her mind}} running on Lady Janet's nephew? No. Lady Janet's brief allusion to her {{relative}} had not led her into alluding {{to him by}} his name. Mercy was still as ignorant as ever that the preacher at the Refuge and the nephew of her benefactress were one and the same man. Her memory was busy now with the tribute which Lady Janet had paid to her {{at the outset of the}} interview between them: [...] "It is hardly too much to say, Grace, that I bless the day when you first came to me." [...] For the moment there was balm for her wounded spirit in the remembrance of those words. Grace Roseberry herself could surely have earned no sweeter praise than the praise that she had won. The next instant she was seized with a sudden horror of her own successful fraud. The sense of her degradation had never been so bitterly present to her as at that moment. If she could only confess the truth--if she could innocently enjoy her harmless life at Mablethorpe House--what a grateful, happy woman she might be! Was it possible (if she made the confession) to trust to her own good conduct to plead her excuse? No! Her calmer sense warned her that it was hopeless. The place she had won--honestly won--in Lady Janet's estimation had been obtained by a trick. Nothing could alter, nothing could excuse, that. She took out her handkerchief and dashed away the useless tears that had gathered in her <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> turn her thoughts some other way. What was it Lady Janet had said on going into the library? She had said she was coming back to speak about Horace. Mercy guessed what the object was; she knew but too well what Horace wanted of her. How was she to meet the emergency? In the name of Heaven, what was to be done? Could she let the man who loved her--the man whom she loved--drift blindfold into marriage with such a woman as she had been? No! it was her duty to warn him. How? Could she break his heart, could she lay his life waste by speaking the cruel words which might part them forever? [...] "I can't tell him! I won't tell him!" [...] she burst out, passionately. [...] "The disgrace of it would kill me!" [...] Her varying mood changed as the words escaped her. A reckless defiance of her own better nature--that saddest of all the forms in which a woman's misery can express itself--filled her heart with its poisoning bitterness. She sat down again on the sofa with eyes that glittered and cheeks suffused with an angry red. [...] "I am no worse than another woman!" [...] she thought. [...] "Another woman might have married him for his money." [...] The next moment the miserable insufficiency of her own excuse for deceiving him showed its hollowness, self-exposed. She covered her face with her hands, and found refuge--where she had often found refuge before--in the helpless resignation of despair. [...] "Oh, that I had died before I entered this house! Oh, that I could die and have done with it at this moment!" [...] So the struggle had ended with her hundreds of times already. So it ended now.|$|E
60|$|The {{stranger}} {{stared at}} him for a moment, again looked carefully round the room, and then suddenly dropped his head back on the pillow, and with his white hands over his <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> mouth <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> restrain a spasm of silent laughter. After an effort he succeeded, wiped his moist <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> sat up.|$|R
5000|$|Damage to the {{olfactory}} system can occur by traumatic brain injury, cancer, infection, inhalation of toxic fumes, or neurodegenerative {{diseases such as}} Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. These conditions can cause anosmia. In contrast, recent finding suggested the molecular aspects of olfactory dysfunction can {{be recognized as a}} hallmark of amyloidogenesis-related diseases and there may even be a causal link through the disruption of multivalent metal ion transport and storage. [...] Doctors can detect damage to the {{olfactory system}} by presenting the patient with odors via a scratch and sniff card or by having the patient close their <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> identify commonly available odors like coffee or peppermint candy.Doctors must exclude other diseases that inhibit or eliminate 'the sense of smell' such as chronic colds or sinusitus before making the diagnosis that there is permanent damage to the olfactory system.|$|R
6000|$|... "He never says {{anything}} about God, and you don't, {{but when he}} comes in here he seems like God to me. He's so peaceful,--he makes me peaceful. I remember the minister in Madison,--he was a putty-faced man with indigestion,--and when he prayed he used <b>to</b> close his <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> look pious, but he never fooled me. He never made me believe he knew anything about God. And don't think for a minute he'd have done what you and Miss Grower and Mr. Bentley did! He used {{to cross the street}} {{to get out of the}} way of drunken men--he wouldn't have one of them in his church. And I know of a girl he drove out of town because she had a baby and her sweetheart wouldn't marry her. He sent her to hell. Hell's here--isn't it?" ...|$|R
