When used directly to label surface immunoglobulin, and indirectly to label alloantigens and concanavalin A receptors, hybrid antibodies induced similar displacement of all surface components from a uniform distribution into “patches” and “caps” at 37 °. One hybrid antibody preparation, antimouse immunoglobulin/anti-ferritin, contained negligible amounts of bivalent anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibody, {{and was therefore}} “monovalent” for the antimouse immunoglobulin specificity. This observation suggests that factors other than multivalent crosslinking are responsible for hybrid antibody-induced redistribution of cell-surface components. Cap formation induced by hybrid antibody was enhanced markedly by attachment of the visual marker, either ferritin or southern bean mosaic virus, at 37 °. At - 5 °, hybrid antibody does not displace uniformly distributed H- 2 b alloantigen-alloantibody complexes, but patches of label develop when ferritin attaches to the hybrid antibody. These results explain the patchy distribution of cell-surface components, which is a temperature-independent characteristic of labeling with hybrid antibodies and visual markers for electron microscopy...|$|E

A particular attention was focused upon the population of large-sized follicles present through the first 6 days after induced pseudopregnancy, since this follicular category, being steroidogenically active, may be crucial to the survival of the developing CL.

40|$|In {{an effort}} to sustain optimum milk {{production}} and overlapping pregnancy, rabbit meat producers often increase nutrient density of rabbit does.

The effect of dietary protein level on plasma urea nitrogen concentrations (PUN) and reproduction efficiency was assessed through a trial involving 90 multiparous <b>hybrid</b> <b>rabbit</b> does at the same pregnancy stage. At d 27 of pregnancy, the animals were equally divided into 2 experimental groups fed on mixture at different protein levels: 18. 5 % (CP 18. 5 = 45) and 22 % (CP 22 = 45) on d. m. Blood samplings (= 90) were performed at the same day of AI (12 d pp) and plasma was assayed for PUN. Reproduction efficiency was evaluated by abdominal palpation 12 d after AI to determine the pregnancy rate (PR). CP 22 rabbits exhibited significantly higher PUN levels compared to CP 18. 5 (34. 06 vs 24. 64; P < 0. 01). Moreover, PUN concentrations above 30 mg/dl have been associated with reduced fertility: PR increased when does were fed a diet not exceeding in protein content (78. 1 vs 69. 3 % for CP 18. 5 vs CP 22; P < 0. 01).

40|$|The {{requirements}} of intensively reared rabbit does {{are very high}} because of the overlapping of lactation and pregnancy. In this situation, {{it is important to}} adopt the most appropriate reproductive system to improve the energy balance of the lactating does and to maximise their productive potential. Previous studies demonstrated that an increase of dietary energy content is often not sufficient to cancel the energy deficit and avoid intense body mobilisation. A negative energy balance is detrimental for the reproductive process and the length of the reproductive life is shorter in intensively than in extensively reared does. Therefore, it seems interesting to study strategies which can reduce the energy mobilisation in lactating females and improve their reproductive performance. This research evaluated body condition, as assessed by some blood metabolites profiles, and pregnancy rate of 120 multiparous <b>hybrid</b> <b>rabbit</b> does submitted to different reproduction rhythms: AI at 11 (I 11 = 60) or 25 (I 25 = 60) d after kindling and weaning at 35 d. Blood samplings (= 360) were repeated at 12, 26 and 36 d pp in all the rabbits. Glucose was analysed by the glucose oxidase method (Sigma), non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) using a two-reaction enzymatic-based colorimetric assay (Wako) and plasma urea nitrogen (PUN) by a colorimetric assay (Sigma). Reproduction efficiency was evaluated by abdominal palpation 15 d after AI to determine the pregnancy rate (PR) (pregnant does x 100 /IA). All data were analyzed by GLM SAS-procedure. The trial was repeated for two consecutive reproduction cycles with identical experimental design; however, {{no significant differences were found}} between cycles. Throughout the experiment mean concentrations of glucose, the body’s major energy source, and PUN were both lower in I 11 compared to I 25 (87. 6 vs. 115. 7 mg/dl; 11. 2 vs. 15. 8 mg/dl; P < 0. 05). In contrast, NEFA mean level resulted higher in I 11 rather than in I 25 (0. 313 vs. 0. 279 mmol/L; P < 0. 05). Moreover, NEFA values were consistent with a steadier mobilisation of adipose depots during lactation in I 25 than in I 11 (0. 247 - 0. 288 - 0. 301 vs. 0. 283 - 0. 338 - 0. 318 mmol/L; P < 0. 05). NEFA are released by the action of hormone sensitive lipase on triglycerides stores in adipose tissue and high NEFA concentrations are indicative of negative energy balance. Hence, low circulating NEFA may reflect direction of fat metabolism towards reduced lipolysis due to increased plasma insulin concentrations. The observation that PUN was constantly lower in I 11 throughout the trial, suggests that an alteration of protein metabolism occurred during lactation. As a matter of fact, in energy deficient rabbits protein-sparing adaptation comes into play to limit turn-over and degradation of protein, whereas during compensatory higher energy intake, increased protein synthesis is associated with decreased nitrogen excretion and lower plasma urea. PR was higher in I 25 does compared to I 11 (82. 4 vs. 71. 3...|$|E

40|$|At weaning (five {{weeks of}} age), 50 <b>hybrid</b> <b>rabbits</b> were at random divided into five groups (labelled blocks). Block 1, which were fed ad libitum with a {{commercial}} diet during weaning period, were slaughtered. The remaining rabbits {{were placed in}} individual cages and fed {{the same amount of}} food until slaughter, but differently rationed. From 5 to 8 wk of age, the rabbits coming from blocks 2 and 4 received 70 % of ad libitum, meanwhile those belonging to blocks 3 and 5 received 90 % of ad libitum. Animals of blocks 2 and 3 were slaughtered at 8 wk of age, while those of blocks 4 and 5 received the reverse restriction level and were slaughtered at 11 wk of age. All the animals were weighed before slaughter and the Biceps femoris muscle was immediately dissected and thereafter its fibers were typed (βR, αR and αW) and mean cross-sectional area was determined for each muscle. As expected, at eight-weeks slaughter age, rabbits given for 3 weeks the strictest feed restriction (70 % of the ad libitum) showed the lowest body weight but presented significantly higher (P< 0. 01) body weights after successive 3 weeks of rationing at 90 % of the ad libitum, if compared with the rabbits that followed the inverse feeding treatment. The 70 - 90 % rationing mode reduced the proportion of oxidative fibers. No relationship was found between the enlargement of muscle fibers and body weight. At the light of actual knowledge further investigations are needed to better understand the relationship between feed restriction and fiber characteristics...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Among {{the main}} {{physiological}} stress indicators, the temperature evaluation {{is very important}} and innovative because it may be monitored without directly interacting with the animal. The use of a thermographic system, {{which is based on}} the detection of infrared radiation emitted by a subject, is a suitable method in order to measure temperature without any contact. In this research, a thermographic system was employed in order to single out the rabbit skin’s zones most suitable for the temperature monitoring during stress challenges. Six <b>hybrid</b> <b>rabbits</b> were observed during induced stress; the areas selected as reference were: the ocular area (globe and periocular area), the internal auricle pavilion, and a shaved area of the head. The results of this pilot study show that the thermographic technique is a suitable method for the evaluation of temperature on rabbit. The best areas singled out were the eye bulb, the periocular area and the ear skin. The results concerning the effect of stress on cutaneous temperature showed that during stress condition a decrease in temperature occurs with respect to the basal condition (ΔT~ 1 °C) and this trend is more evident for the auricle pavillion. In fact, this reaction is more evidenced in the ear skin, where a vasoconstriction process occurs. Moreover, corticosterone levels slightly increase (P= 0. 08) following the stressor’s challenge due to tonic immobility test. In this research, both temperature and the change in corticosterone level show that the stress reaction induced by tonic immobility test is stronger than the one due to the other stressors applied to rabbits...|$|R
40|$|The study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} if the digestible fibre (DF, hemicelluloses+pectins) to starch {{ratio of the}} diet {{and the time of}} antibiotic treatment after epizootic rabbit enteropathy (ERE) outbreak affect health status, digestive physiology, growth performance, and carcass traits of early weaned rabbits. Two hundred forty Grimaud <b>hybrid</b> <b>rabbits</b> were put in individual cages and controlled from 25 d of age to slaughter (70 d). The rabbits were assigned to four groups according to a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement (2 DF to starch ratios by 2 antibiotic treatment times). Half of the rabbits fed ad libitum diet L, with low (1. 0) DF to starch ratio (19. 1 % DF and 18. 9 % starch as-fed) and half fed diet H with high (2. 5) DF to starch ratio (23. 9 % DF and 9. 6 % starch). The diets were characterized by similar protein (16. 8 %), ADF (19. 8 %), and ADL (3. 9 %) concentrations. After the ERE appearance, half of the rabbits within diet were submitted to an early antibiotic treatment (from 38 to 42 d of age), while half of the rabbits to a late treatment (from 45 to 49 d). The antibiotic treatment was realized by an association of oxytetracycline hydrochloride (100 g/ 100 l) and colistin (24 g/ 100 l) administered in water. At 43 d of age, 36 rabbits (6 per group) were sacrificed to collect caecal content and ileum mucosa samples. Increasing DF to starch ratio of the diet improved fibre fraction digestibility (P< 0. 001) therefor...|$|R
40|$|Management {{and feeding}} {{strategies}} for early weaning of rabbits. Under commercial conditions, litters are usually {{separated from their}} mothers at around 35 days of age or even later {{in order to increase}} weight at weaning {{on the basis of the}} positive correlation with post-weaning viability observed in previous research. Recent studies, however, have proposed anticipating weaning age for the dual purpose of reducing doe energy output for milk production and consequent body energy deficit and providing better coverage for kit nutritional requirements through the administration of specific starter diets. Previous studies have demonstrated that the early weaning of rabbits has no detrimental effects on health or growth performance when performed from 21 d onwards and is compatible with the behaviour of wild rabbits. Early weaning has been observed to improve doe body condition and energy balance by decreasing the lactation period and increasing the dry period. In highly productive <b>hybrid</b> <b>rabbits</b> however, the sudden interruption of lactation at its peak may compromise reproductive performance in an extent that needs to be further investigated. Animal welfare may present another critical point against early weaning, even if survival is guaranteed whenever kits can easily access water and food. Specific starter diets appear useful in stimulating digestive functions and microflora development, although studies have shown that kits can be successfully weaned at an early stage regardless of the weaning diet adopted. Current knowledge on protein, fibre and fibrous fractions, starch and fat supply appears sufficient for the formulation of starter diets for early weaned rabbit. However, the complete comprehension of digestive physiology development in this condition and its relationship with digestive efficiency and health requires further investigation...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this trial}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of high chromium (Cr) yeast supplemented diets on performance of growing-finishing <b>rabbits.</b> Ninety-six commercial <b>hybrid</b> <b>rabbits,</b> half males and half females, aged 35 days, were divided into 4 experimental groups and fed, ad libitum, for 49 days the same basal diet supplemented with 0 (T 1), 400 (T 2), 800 (T 3) or 1600 (T 4) ppb of Cr in the form of chromium enriched yeast. Control diet (T 1) was analysed and found to contain 789 ppb Cr, a level which was probably due to the raw feed materials. The Cr content of all the diets was then proportionally increased. Chromium supplementation did not induce any significant differences in daily weight gain (32. 2 to 32. 9 g/d), feed to gain ratio, hot carcass weight, dress-out percentage, kidney weight, scapular fat deposit, or left hindleg percentage and meat/bone ratio. No differences in Cr level were observed for longissimus dorsi pH and colour. In contrast, the perirenal fat deposit was significantly higher in all rabbits which received the Cr supplementation (1. 51 to 1. 61 vs 1. 02 % of the carcass; P = 0. 013) This was probably the result of a modification in lipid anabolism, in relation with the insulin activity, and particularly with the stimulation of the Glucose Tolerance Factor (GTF) which contains chromium. The liver weight of T 3 rabbits was significantly higher than that of control group (4. 94 vs 4. 30 % of the carcass; P = 0. 028). The authors noted a substantial lack of any practical effects of Cr supplementation on growing rabbit performance under experimental conditions. [ [...] . ...|$|R
