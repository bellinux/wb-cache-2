5|$|The {{cultural}} {{impact of}} extraterrestrial contact is the corpus of changes to terrestrial science, technology, religion, politics, and ecosystems resulting from {{contact with an}} extraterrestrial civilization. It {{is closely related to}} the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), which attempts to locate <b>intelligent</b> <b>life</b> as opposed to analyzing the implications of contact with that life.|$|E

5|$|The {{depiction}} of Mars in fiction has been stimulated by its dramatic red color and by nineteenth century scientific speculations that its surface conditions might support not just life but <b>intelligent</b> <b>life.</b> Thus originated {{a large number}} of science fiction scenarios, among which is H.

5|$|Writer Robert L. Forward {{described}} being {{inspired by}} astronomer Frank Drake's suggestion in 1973 that <b>intelligent</b> <b>life</b> could inhabit neutron stars. Physical models in 1973 implied that Drake's creatures would be microscopic.

Later Forward found an earlier letter in which he discussed the idea of high-gravity life in the Sun with science fiction novelist Hal Clement.|$|E
5|$|In April 1966, Feynman {{delivered}} {{an address}} to the National Science Teachers Association, in which he suggested how students could be made to think like scientists, be open-minded, curious, and especially, to doubt. In the course of the lecture, he gave a definition of science, which he said came about by several stages. The evolution of <b>intelligent</b> <b>life</b> on planet Earth—creatures such as cats that play and learn from experience. The evolution of humans, who came to use language to pass knowledge from one individual to the next, so that the knowledge was not lost when an individual died. Unfortunately, incorrect knowledge could be passed down as well as correct knowledge, so another step was needed. Galileo and others started doubting the truth of what was passed down and to investigate ab initio, from experience, what the true situation was—this was science.|$|E

5|$|Kazamatsuri is {{the setting}} for a secret war being waged by two main groups: Gaia and Guardian. Gaia, an {{organization}} {{under the auspices of}} the environmental conservation group Martel, is populated by nihilistic and misanthropic people able to contract with familiars, which manifest as constructs fueled by the summoner's life force. Martel itself used to be a church and contains within it a holy maiden group of girls with developmental disabilities. Guardian is dedicated to the destruction of familiars and is composed almost entirely of humans who possess special powers. Gaia and Guardian came to Kazamatsuri in the pursuit of the Earth's familiar named Kagari, who manifests as a young, high school age-looking girl. Kagari, the main heroine of Rewrite, has the power to initiate a period of re-evolution, which restarts the process of evolving another means of <b>intelligent</b> <b>life.</b> However, this is done with the use of the Earth's energy, and by the time the events of Rewrite occur, there is no more energy left to do another re-evolution. Gaia wants to capture Kagari to ensure the destruction of humanity, but Guardian wishes to seek out Kagari to kill her, ensuring that human life continues.|$|E
25|$|The Fermi {{paradox is}} a {{conflict}} between arguments of scale and probability that seem to favor <b>intelligent</b> <b>life</b> being common in the universe, and a total lack of evidence of <b>intelligent</b> <b>life</b> having ever arisen anywhere other than on the Earth.|$|E
25|$|With high probability, some {{of these}} stars will have Earth-like planets, and if the Earth is typical, some might develop <b>intelligent</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Rare Earth {{hypothesis}} {{argues that}} complex and <b>intelligent</b> <b>life</b> is uncommon {{and that the}} CHZ {{is one of many}} critical factors. According to Ward & Brownlee (2004) and others, not only is a CHZ orbit and surface water a primary requirement to sustain life but a requirement to support the secondary conditions required for multicellular life to emerge and evolve. The secondary habitability factors are both geological (the role of surface water in sustaining necessary plate tectonics) and biochemical (the role of radiant energy in supporting photosynthesis for necessary atmospheric oxygenation). But others, such as Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen in their 2002 book Evolving the Alien argue that complex <b>intelligent</b> <b>life</b> may arise outside the CHZ. <b>Intelligent</b> <b>life</b> outside the CHZ may have evolved in subsurface environments, from alternative biochemistries or even from nuclear reactions.|$|E

25|$|Some {{physicists}} {{believe this}} {{large number of}} solutions is actually a virtue because it may allow a natural anthropic explanation of the observed values of physical constants, in particular the small value of the cosmological constant. The anthropic principle {{is the idea that}} some of the numbers appearing in the laws of physics are not fixed by any fundamental principle but must be compatible with the evolution of <b>intelligent</b> <b>life.</b> In 1987, Steven Weinberg published an article in which he argued that the cosmological constant could not have been too large, or else galaxies and <b>intelligent</b> <b>life</b> {{would not have been able}} to develop. Weinberg suggested that there might be a huge number of possible consistent universes, each with a different value of the cosmological constant, and observations indicate a small value of the cosmological constant only because humans happen to live in a universe that has allowed <b>intelligent</b> <b>life,</b> and hence observers, to exist.|$|E
50|$|The Message {{has been}} {{determined}} to meet SETI’s Standards For <b>Intelligent</b> Extraterrestrial <b>Life</b> (repetition, spectral width, extrasolar origin, metadata, and Terran elimination) {{by a team of}} codebreakers led by renowned cryptographer, Lewis Krell.

25|$|Using {{new data}} from Kepler, an astrobiologist has {{attempted}} to update the Drake equation. It is estimated that a biotic planet may be expected within 10-100 light years from Earth, while the nearest <b>intelligent</b> <b>life</b> is probably a few thousand light years away.|$|E
25|$|Another active {{research}} area in astrobiology is planetary system formation. It {{has been suggested}} that the peculiarities of the Solar System (for example, the presence of Jupiter as a protective shield) may have greatly increased the probability of <b>intelligent</b> <b>life</b> arising on our planet.|$|E
25|$|The second {{aspect of}} the Fermi paradox is the {{argument}} of probability: given intelligent life's ability to overcome scarcity, and its tendency to colonize new habitats, it seems possible {{that at least some}} civilizations would be technologically advanced, seek out new resources in space, and colonize their own star system and, subsequently, surrounding star systems. Since there is no significant evidence on Earth, or elsewhere in the known universe of other <b>intelligent</b> <b>life</b> after 13.8billion years of the universe's history, there is a conflict requiring a resolution. Some examples of possible resolutions are that <b>intelligent</b> <b>life</b> is rarer than we think, that our assumptions about the general development or behavior of intelligent species are flawed, or, more radically, that our current scientific {{understanding of the nature of}} the universe itself is quite incomplete.|$|E

50|$|Humanity was {{introduced}} to the existence of <b>intelligent</b> extraterrestrial <b>life</b> with the discovery of an alien statue on Iapetus, a moon of Saturn, which depicted an alien life form.

25|$|Seeing {{little sense}} in a {{principle}} requiring <b>intelligent</b> <b>life</b> to emerge while remaining {{indifferent to the}} possibility of its eventual extinction, Barrow and Tipler propose the final anthropic principle (FAP): Intelligent information-processing must come into existence in the universe, and, once it comes into existence, it will never die out.|$|E
25|$|This {{can be seen}} {{as simply}} the classic design {{argument}} restated in the garb of contemporary cosmology. It implies {{that the purpose of the}} universe is to give rise to <b>intelligent</b> <b>life,</b> with the laws of nature and their fundamental physical constants set to ensure that life as we know it will emerge and evolve.|$|E
25|$|Soviet {{scientists}} took {{a strong}} interest in SETI during the 1960s and performed a number of searches with omnidirectional antennas in the hope of picking up powerful radio signals. Soviet astronomer Iosif Shklovsky wrote the pioneering book in the field, Universe, Life, Intelligence (1962), which was expanded upon by American astronomer Carl Sagan as the best-selling book <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Life</b> in the Universe (1966).|$|E
25|$|Those {{who think}} that <b>intelligent</b> {{extraterrestrial}} <b>life</b> is (nearly) impossible argue that the conditions needed {{for the evolution of}} life—or at least the evolution of biological complexity—are rare or even unique to Earth.
