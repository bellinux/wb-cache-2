40|$|We {{propose a}} novel method of {{detecting}} trace amounts of dengue virus (DENVs) from serum. Our method {{is based on}} the interaction between a sulfated sugar chain and a DENV surface glycoprotein. After capturing DENV with the sulfated sugar chain-immobilized gold nanoparticles (SGNPs), the resulting complex is precipitated and viral RNA content is measured using the reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction SYBR Green I (RT-qPCR-Syb) method. Sugar chains that bind to DENVs were identified using the array-type <b>sugar</b> chain immobilized <b>chip</b> (<b>Sugar</b> <b>Chip)</b> and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) imaging. Heparin and low-molecular-weight dextran sulfate were identified as binding partners, and immobilized on gold nanoparticles to prepare 3 types of SGNPs. The capacity of these SGNPs to capture and concentrate trace amounts of DENVs was evaluated in vitro. The SGNP with greatest sensitivity was tested using clinical samples in Indonesia in 2013 - 2014. As a result, the novel method was able to detect low concentrations of DENVs using only 6 μL of serum, with similar sensitivity to that of a Qiagen RNA extraction kit using 140 μL of serum. In addition, this method allows for multiplex-like identification of serotypes of DENVs. This feature is important for good healthcare management of DENV infection in order to safely diagnose the dangerous, highly contagious disease quickly, with high sensitivity...|$|R

Some of those foods have unique characteristics {{in the sense that}} they are able to convert non edible by products or waste products which usually used as animal feeds into nutritious and sometimes very tasty foods, such as oncom and some kinds of tempe. Most of the fermented foods in lndonesia are available in solid form, liquid and semi liquid, * generally prepared from vegetable products, particularly legumes, cereals, and tubers, or their by products. The technology of traditional fermentation is simple with extremely low cost production. There are so many kinds of traditional non fermented foods available in the country.

Traditional foods are important component in lndonesian diets especially due to their contribution as source of protein, calorie and vitamins. Moreover, since most of them are made from plant origin, they become more suitable as important diets for lndonesian people who seem depend increasingly on plant rather than animal products. These special traditional foods are processed by traditional methods without sufficient hygienic precautions and therefore natural contamination is always possible.

40|$|Consumers {{purchase}} {{fruits and}} vegetables based on its quality, which {{can be defined as}} a degree of excellence which {{is the result of a}} combination of characteristics, attributes and properties that have significance for market acceptability. In this paper, a novel hybrid active imaging methodology for potato quality inspection that uses an optical colour camera and an infrared thermal camera is presented. The methodology employs an artificial neural network (ANN) that uses quality data composed by two descriptors as input. The ANN works as a feature classifier so that its output is the potato quality grade. The input vector contains information related to external characteristics, such as shape, weight, length and width. Internal characteristics are also accounted for in the input vector in the form of excessive sugar content. The extra sugar content of the potato is an important problem for potato growers and potato <b>chip</b> manufacturers. Extra <b>sugar</b> content could result in diseases or wounds in the potato tuber. In general, potato tubers with low sugar content are considered as having a higher quality. The validation of the methodology was made through experimentation which consisted in fusing both, external and internal characteristics in the input vector to the ANN for an overall quality classification. Results using internal data as obtained from an infrared camera and fused with optical external parameters demonstrated the feasibility of the method since the prediction accuracy increased during potato grading...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} characterizing a potato with extra sugar content and identifying the location and depth of the extra sugar content using the active thermography imaging technique. The extra sugar content of the potato is an important problem for potato growers and potato <b>chip</b> manufacturers. Extra <b>sugar</b> content could result in diseases or wounds in the potato tuber. In general, potato tubers with low sugar content are considered as having a higher quality. The inspection system and general methodologies characterizing extra sugar content will be presented in this study. The average heating rate obtained from the thermal image analysis is the major factor in characterization procedures. Using information on the average heating rate, the probability of achieving a potato with extra sugar content may be predicted using the logistic regression model. In addition, neural networks are also used to identify the potato with extra sugar contents. The correct rate for identifying a potato with extra sugar content in it can reach 85 %. The location of extra sugar content {{can also be found}} using the logistic regression model. Results show the overall correct rate predicting the extra sugar content location with a resolution of 20 by 20 pixels is 91 %.

40|$|The National Food Survey {{provides}} a valuable {{supply of information}} on the intake of food and nutrients in the British diet (Derry and Buss, 1984), but is confined to food brought into the home. The present study examined nutrient contribution from foods eaten outside the home to the overall diet. Seventy subjects (35 males and 35 females), were selected from a local health centre register, using age and sex as criteria, and asked to keep a written record of everything consumed for three days. There was a very high percentage of all subjects eating out over the three days, but most of this food could be classed as 'casual', or of the 'non-meal' category i. e. snacks. Employment was a significant determinant of frequency of eating out. The food groups contributing more highly to nutrient intake away from home were meats, sugars and preserves, alcoholic beverages, fish and <b>chips.</b> Energy from <b>sugar,</b> measured as sugar density, was significantly higher in 'away' foods, but fibre density and protein as a percentage of energy was higher in foods eaten at home. The percentage energy from nutrients to total energy did not differ greatly when alcoholic beverages were excluded from the data, apart from redistribution of the energy from alcohol between the other nutrients. The results show that foods eaten outside the home are potentially significant contributors to total nutrient intake, and future research on 'out of home' eating habits would benefit from inclusion of nutritional analysis...|$|R
40|$|It can be {{postulated}} that schools have an ethical {{responsibility to protect}} children from an unhealthy food environment. Against the backdrop of stunting, overweight and micronutrient deficiencies prevalent in South African children, the aim of this scoping study is to review information available on foods sold to school children within an ethical framework. While some schools have a formal tuck shop, at other schools, food vendors sell food either on or outside the school premises. Ten studies, of which two were national, fit the selection criteria for this study. Available data show that mostly unhealthy food options are sold to South African school children; with low-nutrient energy-dense foods (e. g. <b>chips,</b> sweets) and <b>sugar</b> sweetened beverages being the most popular. The Integrated School Health Policy provide a policy framework for achieving healthy school food environments in South Africa, and several guidelines are available in South African to assist school tuck shops to sell healthier options. Children’s preference for unhealthy foods, the cost of healthier food options and a lack of proper facilities may however be barriers for implementing healthy tuck shops. An action stronger than merely providing guidelines may therefore be needed. Cognisance needs to be taken of conflicting value based arguments within ethical perspectives. Given these conflicts, the authors argue that an Ethics of Responsibility contributes to the debate of the best and supports the notion that society at large has a responsibility to protect vulnerable communities of which school children are part. Presently an ethical vacuum exists in terms of rights and responsibilities which this study hopes to address. DHE...|$|R

Clones grown in spring had shorter dormancy than clones grown in autumn. Potato tubers grown in spring and autumn and stored at 4 ºC, as well as tubers grown in autumn and stored at 8 ºC had no sprouting for six months. Among clones grown in autumn, the longest dormancy period during storage at 12 ºC was observed in the clone SMINIA 793101 - 3, and at 25 ºC was in the clone Asterix.

40|$|The aim {{of these}} studies is to {{investigate}} the production of plasma polymer modified surfaces for the non-covalent binding of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). These surfaces are designed to aid the investigation of GAG-protein interactions, and enable the elucidation of the important biological processes they may be involved in. It is also hoped that the discoveries in this thesis will translate into the production of new technology for studying GAG-protein interactions for example a sugar plate array that can be utilised in probe GAGprotein interactions and gycomics in a high-throughput platform. In this work investigations {{have been carried out}} on binding of heparin, heparin sulphate, chondroitin sulphate, dermatan sulphate and the unsulphated hyaluronic acid. Allylamine can be plasma-polymerised (PpAA) on to surfaces to provide a positivelycharged surface to which sulphated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) such as heparin can bind. A range of plasma polymer chemistries were investigated, for the elucidation of the requirements for efficient binding of biologically active GAGs, initially using heparin as the.. model ligand. The influence of heparin concentration, solution ionic strength and incubation time were all explored as variables in the immobilization of heparin to ppAA modified microtitre plates. Gradients of surface chemistry were produced by mixing of allylamine with a hydrocarbon monomer octadiene to elucidate the optimal surface chemistry for the binding of heparin. The amount of heparin bound to the plates was monitored by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), using the S 2 p from heparin on the surface and radio-labelled esS] heparin. The biological activity of the surface immobilised GAGs were investigated using a range of protein binding assays. These systems involved using GAGs to capture proteins on the allylamine modified surfaces in a modified sandwich ELISA approach. Readout systems such as antibody specific binding to the proteins retained on the surface was utilised with a colourimetric change being read as an absorbance readout. The results showed that there are differences in binding by the GAGs for the different binding proteins. OPG protein appeared to be dependent on sulphation levels with higher sulphated GAGs binding more protein. Link _ TSG- 6 protein showed the opposite, with less sulphated GAGs binding better in general. While TIMP- 3 showed no correlation with sulphation levels, as heparan sulphates containing different sulphation levels bound equally well. This suggests a specific molecular binding moiety for binding may be utilised by TIMP- 3, meaning the protein structure for GAG interactions may be more specific. However, more research to elucidate these specific moieties is required. These results clearly demonstrate that if scaled down to a micro array format, these surfaces could act as a platform for a high-throughput <b>sugar</b> <b>chip</b> for the investigation of GAG-protein interactions. These could have some advantages over current assay formats that are widely used so far as they are inexpensive to produce and can bind native GAGs with no modifications. This allows avoidance of expensive and time consuming synthesis procedures for GAG production containing modified regions. As well as the risks involved in modifying a GAG such as altering its affinities for its binding proteins. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
