5|$|TWR {{took over}} the IMSA GT Championship {{operation}} in 1988 and one model– Jaguar XJR-9– was launched to compete in both series. The XJR-9, which retained the Jaguar V12 engine, {{went on to win}} the 1988 24 Hours of Le Mans and World Sportscar Championship in the same year. The poor fuel consumption of the Jaguar V12 combined with new rules restricting refueling during races forced the replacement of the V12 engine in the XJR-9s successors, the XJR-10 and XJR-11. The normally-aspirated Austin Rover V64V engine, designed for the MG Metro 6R4 had recently been made redundant thanks to the Group B rally ban in 1987, and the <b>design</b> <b>rights</b> were for sale. The compact, lightweight and fuel efficient nature of the small-displacement, turbocharged engine was investigated by TWR, who considered it an ideal basis for a new engine to power the XJR-10 and purchased the <b>design</b> <b>rights</b> from Austin Rover Group.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the design protection available under community designs, UK law provides its own national registered <b>design</b> <b>right</b> and an unregistered <b>design</b> <b>right.</b> The unregistered right, which exists automatically if the requirements are met, can last for up to 15 years. The registered <b>design</b> <b>right</b> can last up to 25 years subject to the payment of maintenance fees. The topography of semi-conductor circuits are also covered by integrated circuit layout design protection, a form of protection which lasts 10 years.|$|R

[...] By agreement with the owners of the lock's <b>design</b> <b>rights,</b> the key profile for each and every live weapon was unique, and would not be used for any other purpose. [...] The profile for the training rounds was also not used elsewhere, but all training rounds used the same profile. [...] The physical safety characteristics of WE.177 were probably comparable to similar U.S. weapons, e.g. using the concept of being 'one-point-safe'. [...] The safety and arming system was more sophisticated than on a conventional shell or bomb. [...] The WE.177 safety and arming system had three safety breaks (which varied according to delivery mode) in the arming chain, whereas a conventional weapon only requires two.|$|E

This thesis examines the technological background to 3 D printing and scanning before evaluating the viability of these technologies as a mass consumer product.
