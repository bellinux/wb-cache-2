40|$|The aims of {{this paper}} are twofold: First, we locate the most {{effective}} human geographical methods for sampling across space in large-scale dialectological projects. We propose two geographical concepts {{as a basis for}} sampling decisions: Geo-demographic classification, which is a multidimensional method used for the socio-economic <b>grouping</b> <b>of</b> <b>areas.</b> We also develop an updated version of functional regions {{that can be used in}} sociolinguistic research. We then report on the results of a pilot project that applies these models to collect data regarding the acceptability of vernacular morpho-syntactic forms in the North-East of England. Following the method of natural breaks advocated for dialectology by Horvath and Horvath (2002), we interpret breaks in the probabilistic patterns as areas of dialect transitions. This study contributes to the debate about the role and limitations of spatiality in linguistic analysis. It intends to broaden our knowledge about the interfaces between human geography and dialectology...|$|E
40|$|Tests are {{reported}} {{of the possibility}} that local information from contour junctions and from corners of intersecting surfaces is used for perceived surface segregation. Stimuli were two intersecting squares with small disks occluding different parts of the squares. The perceived segregation of the squares from one another decreased as the amount of occlusion of parts of the squares increased. This segregation was less when disks occluded parts of contours than when disks occluded parts entirely inside the squares. Occlusion of parts of contours reduced segregation independently of whether contour junctions or corners were visible or invisible, both where the intersecting surfaces were transparent squares and when they were outlined squares. The present findings show that local information from contour junctions or from corners is not used for surface segregation, and confirm that this segregation is determined by global processes of <b>grouping</b> <b>of</b> <b>areas</b> and of extrapolation of contours...|$|E

40|$|The {{magnitude}} {{and frequency of}} precipitation is of great significance {{in the field of}} hydrologic and hydraulic design and has wide applications in varied areas. However, the availability of precipitation data is limited to a few areas, where the rain gauges are successfully and efficiently installed. The {{magnitude and}} frequency of precipitation in ungauged sites can be assessed by grouping areas with similar characteristics. The procedure of <b>grouping</b> <b>of</b> <b>areas</b> having similar behaviour is termed as Regionalization. In this paper, RCDA cluster ensemble algorithm is employed to identify the homogeneous regions of rainfall in India. Cluster ensemble methods are commonly used to enhance the quality of clus-tering by combining multiple clustering schemes to produce a more robust scheme delivering similar homogeneous re-gions. The goal is to identify, analyse and describe hydrologically similar regions using RCDA cluster ensemble algo-rithm. RCDA cluster ensemble algorithm, which is based on discriminant analysis. The algorithm takes H base cluster-ing schemes each with K clusters, obtained by any clustering method, as input and constructs discriminant function for each one of them. Subsequently, all the data tuples are predicted using H discriminant functions for cluster membership. Tuples with consistent predictions are assigned to the clusters, while tuples with inconsistent predictions are analyzed further and either assigned to clusters or declared as noise. RCDA algorithm has been compared with Best of K-means and Clue cluster ensemble of R software using traditional clustering quality measures. Further, domain knowledg...|$|E
40|$|This Thesis {{reports on}} the {{principles}} and usefulness of Performance Rating as developed by the writer {{over a number of}} years. In Part one a brief analysis is made of the Quality scene and its development up to the present. The need is exposed for Performance Rating as a tool for all areas of management*. At the same time a system of Quality Control is described which the writer has further developed under the title of 'Operator Control'. This system is based on the integration of all Quality control functions with the creative functions required for Quality achievement. The discussions are mainly focussed on the general philosophy of Quality, its creation and control and that part of Operator Control which affects Performance Rating. Whereas it is shown that the combination of Operator Control and Performance Rating is both economically and technically advantageous, Performance Rating can also usefully be applied under inspection control conditions. Part two describes the principles of Area Performance Rating. *The need for, and the advantages of, Performance Rating are particularly demonstrated in Case study No. 1. From this a summation expression is derived which gives the key for <b>grouping</b> <b>of</b> <b>areas</b> with similar Performance Rating (P). A model is devised on which the theory is demonstrated. Relevant case studies, carried out in practice in factories are quoted in Part two, Chapter 4, one written by the Quality manager of that particular factory. Particular stress is laid in the final conclusions on management's function in the Quality field and how greatly this function is eased and improved through the introduction of Area Performance Rating...|$|E
40|$|IntroductionFunctional imaging studies {{reported}} activations in the inferior frontal sulcus (ifs), e. g., in sentence comprehension and verbal working memory (1). Furthermore, studies on cognitive control activate cortical areas {{buried in the}} inferior frontal junction (ifj; (2)). These activations cannot assigned to a Brodmann area (BA; (3)), since Brodmann’s map does not contain information about areal borders in the depth of sulci. Moreover, we recently found that Broca´s region and its surroundings, especially the ifs, encompass several receptor architectonically defined areas (4, 5). Aim {{of this study was}} to analyze the segregation of the cortical ribbon in the ifs and ifj based on their cyto- and receptor architecture (6) and compute probabilistic maps of detected areas. MethodsHuman brains were obtained in accordance with legal requirements through the body donor program of the University of Düsseldorf (Germany) and coronally cut into 20 µm thick sections. Alternating sections of seven hemispheres were autoradiographically labeled (8) to visualize 17 receptor types of the glutamate, GABA, acetylcholine, noradrenaline, serotonin, dopamine, and adenosine transmitter systems. Receptor densities (fmol/mg protein) were extracted from the digitized autoradiograms via density profiles. Ten additional brains were processed for cell body staining. Cell packing density was measured by Grey Level Index (GLI) profiles. Borders between areas were defined based on differences in the laminar pattern of receptor densities and GLI values using an observer independent method (9). A hierarchical cluster analysis was performed to visualize <b>grouping</b> <b>of</b> <b>areas</b> depending on cyto- and receptor architectonic similarities (8). Finally, defined areas were 3 D reconstructed, registered and superimposed in the anatomical MNI space, resulting in a probabilistic map (pmap) for each cortical area (7). ResultsSix previously unknown cortical areas, ifs 1 - 4, ifj 1 and ifj 2, were mapped within the ifs and ifj. They differed in cyto- and receptor architecture from each other and their neighboring areas (BA 6, 9, 46, 44, 45). Area ifs 3, e. g., showed higher BZ receptor densities in the supragranular layers and higher kainate receptor densities in the infragranular layers (Fig. 1) as well as more and bigger pyramidal cells in layer III, a broader layer VI and a more conspicuous columnar cellular arrangement than the other ifs and ifj areas. The hierarchical cluster analysis (Fig. 2) showed that ifj 1 and ifj 2 were more similar to each other than to ifs areas, and ifs 1 / 2 shared more similarities than did ifs 3 / 4. Finally, areas within the sulci were distinct from areas on the middle frontal gyrus, BA 6, and 44 / 45. The pmaps (Fig. 3) demonstrated a rostro-caudal arrangement of the areas along the ifs and ifj, whereby ifs 1, 2, 4, and ifj 1 were located on the ventral and ifs 3 on the dorsal bank of the ifs. Areal volumes varied from 38 mm 3 of ifs 2 to 260 mm 3 of ifj 2. The high interindividual variability demonstrated by blue colors in the pmaps was mainly caused by the small areal sizes and considerable differences in individual sulcal patterns...|$|E
