40|$|This study {{presents}} the theoretical and experimental research of an ejector expansion transcritical refrigeration system for military {{environmental control unit}} (ECU) applications with carbon dioxide as refrigerant. The expansion losses of an isenthalpic throttling process are identified {{as one of the}} largest irreversibilities of transcritical CO 2 refrigeration cycles, which contribute to the low efficiency of such cycles. An <b>ejector</b> expansion <b>device</b> is proposed here to recover the expansion losses and increase cycle efficiency. The ejector was chosen over other expansion work recovery devices because of its unique advantages such as simple construction and robust operation. ^ A new two-phase flow ejector simulation model is developed to investigate the effects of design parameters and operation conditions on the performance of the <b>ejector</b> expansion <b>device.</b> An experimental test setup is built to test the performance of an <b>ejector</b> expansion <b>device.</b> Experimental results are used to validate the two-phase flow ejector model. The two-phase flow ejector model can predict the mass flow rate through motive nozzle within ± 5 % and the ejector outlet pressure within ± 12 % with the experimentally determined motive nozzle and suction nozzle isentropic efficiencies. ^ A prototype transcritical CO 2 environmental control unit was build and tested. The unit was tested with a two-stage compressor and a single-stage compressor. Micro-channel heat exchangers were used to build the gas cooler and evaporator. The test results were used to validate an existing simulation model for transcritical CO 2 air conditioning systems. After modification, the simulation model was able to predict the cooling capacity and cooling COP within ± 10 % of the measured results. ^ A new ejector expansion transcritical CO 2 system simulation model has been developed to predict the performance of unitary air conditioners using micro-channel heat exchangers.

The compressor compresses the vapor to approximately 2 / 3 of the final pressure and additional compression is provided in an ejector, thus the amount of mechanical energy required by a compressor is reduced and the efficiency is increased.

40|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines {{are a major}} source of airborne particulate matter (PM). The size of the engine PM is in the sub-micrometer range. The number of engine particles per unit volume is high, normally in the range of 10 {sup 12 } to 10 {sup 14 }. To measure the size distribution of the engine particles dilution of an aerosol sample is required. A diluter utilizing a venturi ejector mixing technique is commercially available and tested. The purpose of this investigation was to determine if turbulence created by the ejector in the mini-dilutor changes the size of particles passing through it. The results of the NaCl aerosol experiments show no discernible difference in the geometric mean diameter and geometric standard deviation of particles passing through the ejector. Similar results were found for the DOP particles. The ratio of the total number concentrations before and after the ejector indicates that a dilution ratio of approximately 20 applies equally for DOP and NaCl particles. This indicates the dilution capability of the ejector is not affected by the particle composition. The statistical analysis results of the first and second moments of a distribution indicate that the ejector may not change the major parameters (e. g., the geometric mean diameter and geometric standard deviation) characterizing the size distributions of NaCl and DOP particles. However, when the skewness was examined, it indicates that the ejector modifies the particle size distribution significantly. The ejector could change the skewness of the distribution in an unpredictable and inconsistent manner. Furthermore, when the variability of particle counts in individual size ranges {{as a result of the}} ejector is examined, one finds that the variability is greater for DOP particles in the size range of 40 - 150 nm than for NaCl particles in the size range of 30 to 350 nm. The numbers or particle counts in this size region are high enough that the Poisson counting errors are small (< 10 %) compared with the tail regions. This result shows that the <b>ejector</b> <b>device</b> could have a higher bin-to-bin counting uncertainty for ''soft'' particles such as DOP than for a solid dry particle like NaCl.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is the study and the modeling of a cogeneration system that features an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) coupled with an ejector refrigeration cycle. The ejector refrigeration cycle structure is basically analogue {{to that of a}} standard vapor compression cycle, with the difference that the compressor that is normally present in the latter will be substituted with an ejector to operate the compression in its stead. The specifics of the system that is sized and analyzed in this work come from the idea of a collaboration between the University of Liège, the company Enertime and the school ESPRIT (Ecole Supérieure Privée d’Ingénierie et des Technologies) in Tunis. The goal of the project is to study and build a prototype of a small scale ORC system, which utilizes water heated by concentrating solar collectors, coupled with an ejector refrigeration cycle. The ORC will recover heat from the source available at low temperature and will have a hydrocarbon or a refrigerant as working fluid. The best fitting fluid will be selected among the conventional options for similar applications, as a balanced solution for the necessities of high efficiency, safety and low environmental impact. The most relevant features of the ejector refrigeration cycle are its relatively simple structure, low construction costs and the complete lack of moving parts, which make its operating costs negligible once the device has been properly realized. The other refrigeration technologies that could be coupled with a thermal power cycle, from the conventional vapor compression cycle to the absorption or adsorption ones, normally show higher energy and exergy efficiency, but the systems are relatively complicated, resulting in a higher capital investment. Most theoretical works on ejector cycles are either specifically focused on the isolated <b>ejector</b> <b>device</b> itself, or tend to describe its behavior in a simplified way while focusing on the whole cycle’s characterization instead. Furthermore, while several structural choices and enhancements have been proposed for the ejector cycle, only the simplest architectures are usually investigated in the combined cycle analyses. The idea behind the present work is to adopt an intermediate approach, exploiting the capabilities of a one-dimensional model as much as possible and adapt it in order to predict the ejector’s behavior when it is not operated under design conditions. Different working fluids and system architectures are presented, and the effect of possible enhancements to the cycle is investigated...|$|E

A prototype was designed and the experiment system was set up. The performance of pressure-exchange ejector at different overall pressure ratio and outlet pressure was investigated.

Higher efficiency could be obtained when the outlet pressure {{was close to the}} average pressure of the channel after a cycle. Besides, the efficiency of pressure-exchange ejector decreased as the overall pressure ratio increasing. The maximum efficiency was about 60 % when pH/pL= 1. 5, while for pH/pL= 2. 0, the maximum efficiency reduced by 15 %. However this value was also much higher than that of the steady flow ejector.

The analysis of the ejector cycle, considering both a constant area and a constant pressure device, is presented by varying the schematic of the system and performance parameters. The best performing cycle is a constant pressure ejector cycle without any suction liquid heat exchanger: it can allow improvements over the standard reference cycle whenever the primary nozzle efficiency is above 50 % and diffuser efficiency above 60 %.

Ejector studies often focus on the design and performance of the two-phase ejector and the effect it can have {{on the performance of}} the ejector cycle. However, the ejector is not the only component of the system that can have a significant influence on the performance of the ejector cycle. Recent experimental work has shown that the effect of evaporator design on ejector cycle performance can be quite significant, though there is very little research available on the relation between evaporator design and ejector cycle performance. In this paper, a numerical model of a microchannel air-to-refrigerant evaporator, capable of accounting for heat transfer and pressure drop effects, is developed and used to investigate the effect that different evaporator dimensions have on the performance of ejector cycles. The model is validated with experimental data from previous ejector cycle studies. There are two ejector cycles of interest: The standard ejector cycle, in which the ejector is used to directly lift the compressor suction pressure, and the ejector recirculation cycle, in which the ejector recirculates excess liquid through the evaporator but does not directly lift compressor suction pressure. The effects of microchannel port hydraulic diameter, number of evaporator passes, refrigerant outlet state, and air-side resistance are investigated.

These ejectors can be broadly classified into central ejectors and annular ejectors.

This paper is an exploratory study to show how effectively supersonic wave structures can fulfill this goal, and to provide some fundamental insight as to the behavior. A comparison, at a fundamental level, of the spectrum of flow induction devices from mechanical turbomachinery to direct flow induction including steady flow ejectors, wave rotors, and pressure exchange devices is explored. While the authors have been studying various flow induction devices intended to lead to practical solutions, the details of the flow interactions are obscured by geometries and the complex interactions. This paper attempts to take a step backward and look at the simplest conceivable model that demonstrates the phenomena thought to be the key to a new technology. This model is a crypto-steady supersonic pressure exchange process occurring behind a supersonic frictionless semi-infinite flat plate having a pressure differential between both sides of the plate. It is found that very high compressor efficiencies and energy transfer rates are possible even with the presence of supersonic flow structure.
