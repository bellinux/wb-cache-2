40|$|Mambo et al [6 - 7] {{introduced}} a proxy signature scheme. Neuman [8] extended the scheme for delegation by warrant, which was further extended by Kim et al [4] to partial delegation with a warrant. In this {{paper we propose}} a new type of <b>digital</b> <b>proxy</b> signature scheme in which the warrant message can be recovered from the proxy signature. In this scheme the warrant message is conveyed within the proxy signature and recovered by the verifier, i. e., the warrant need not be hashed or sent along with the proxy signature. It saves both communication bandwidth and storage space...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Proxy {{signatures}} {{are very}} useful tools with which a potential signer can delegate his signing {{power to a}} proxy signer who signs a message {{on behalf of the}} original signer. A blind signature is the concept with a salient feature that the signer cannot make a linkage between the blind signature and the identity of the requester. Therefore, it is very suitable for electronic commerce. On the basis of the blind Schnorr signature, this paper presents a <b>digital</b> <b>proxy</b> blind signature scheme, which satisfies the security properties of both the blind signature scheme and the proxy signature scheme...|$|E
40|$|The {{mouse cursor}} {{acts as a}} <b>digital</b> <b>proxy</b> for a finger on {{graphical}} displays. Our hands, however, have ten fingers and many degrees of freedom that we use {{to interact with the}} world. We posit that by creating graphical cursors that reflect more of the hand's physical properties, we can allow for richer and more fluid interaction. We demonstrate this idea with three new cursors that are controlled by the user's fingers using a multi-point touchpad. The first two techniques allow for simultaneous control of several properties of graphical objects, while the third technique makes several enhancements to object selection...|$|E

A number of useful services {{based on the}} framework are described. The concepts of virtual locations and <b>digital</b> <b>proxies</b> for physical services are introduced and used together with a physically based scope mechanism (aura and nimbus).

40|$|Colonial {{archives}} {{have historically}} been centralised and exclusive in spatial as well as ideological terms. Digitalisation {{paved the way for}} the decentralisation and democratisation of institutional archives as <b>digital</b> <b>proxies</b> have become accessible to wider and geographically disperse audiences through different online platforms. This online presence as well as the possibilities for user interactivity and repurposing of content that Web 2. 0 offered has opened new channels and networks for the critical examination of the colonial archive, its ontology, politics and power. This panel sought to investigate novel readings of the colonial photographic archive in the digital era. Papers reflected on how the concept, content and taxonomy of colonial and postcolonial archives in Southeast Asia have been used, challenged, appropriated and repurposed by contemporary artists, curators and academics, within western and nonwestern explorations of ethnicity, identity, history and memory. Speakers also explored the ways that these new interpretations, located on or disseminated through the Web, constitute an expanded postcolonial archive that may afford us a reimagining of Southeast Asia...|$|R

In order {{to guard against}} the attack, Hwang et al. proposed another threshold proxy signature scheme. However, a new attack is proposed to work on both Hwang et al. ’s and Sun’s schemes. By executing this attack, one proxy signer and the original signer can forge any valid proxy signature. Therefore, both Hwang et al. ’s scheme and Sun’s scheme were insecure.

40|$|Abstract. In a proxy {{signature}} scheme, {{a potential}} signer delegates his signing {{power to a}} proxy, who signs a message {{on behalf of the}} original signer. In a blind signature scheme, the signee cannot link the relationship between the blind message and the signature of the chosen message. That is, the signee cannot make a linkage between the blind signature and the identity of the requester. Therefore, it is very suitable for electronic commerce application. In this paper, {{on the basis of the}} Schnorr blind signature, we present two <b>digital</b> <b>proxy</b> blind signature schemes, which satisfy the security properties of both the blind signature and the proxy signature. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Proxy {{signature}} allows {{an original}} signer to delegate his/her signing capability to a proxy signer {{such that the}} proxy signer can sign messages {{on behalf of the}} original signer. Blind signature allows a user to have a given message signed by the signer without revealing any information about the message. By using Schnorr blind signature, Tan et al. recently proposed a <b>digital</b> <b>proxy</b> blind signature scheme. They claimed that it satisfies the security properties of both blind signatures and proxy signatures. However, it is not the fact. This paper shows that the proposed scheme is vulnerable to universal forgery as well as linkability attacks. It also explains why their proofs of the security are incorrect...|$|E
40|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>proxy</b> multi-{{signature}} {{and blind}} signature scheme are found very {{useful for the}} purpose of electronic voting and electronic cash transaction. In proxy multi-signature, many original signers can delegate their signing power to a proxy signer {{in such a way that}} the proxy signer can sign any message on behalf of original signers. In blind signature, the signer cannot make a linkage between the blind signature and the identity of the requester. Proxy blind multi-signature is the combination of proxy multi-signature and blind signature. In this paper, we propose a new proxy blind multi-signature scheme based on integer factorization problem (IFP) and discrete logarithm problem (DLP) to improve the security aspect. It satisfies the security properties of both the blind signature and the proxy multi-signature scheme...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In 2001, Hsu et al. {{proposed}} a non-repudiable threshold proxy signature with known signers. In their scheme, the proxy group cannot deny having signed the proxy signature if they did. However, Hsu et al. ’s scheme {{is vulnerable to}} some attacks. A malicious original signer or malicious proxy signer can impersonate some other proxy signers to generate proxy signatures. In this article, we shall present our cryptanalysis of the Hsu et al. ’s scheme. After that, we shall propose a new threshold proxy signature that can overcome the weaknesses.

40|$|The {{one-time}} proxy signature {{scheme is}} a kind of digital signature scheme. Using the signature scheme, the original signer can delegate his/her signing capability to the proxy signer and the proxy signer can sign the message only once. In this paper, we propose a new one-time proxy signature scheme based on Discrete Logarithm Problem(DLP). The proposed scheme uses Wang's basic proxy signature and the warrant. Because our one-time proxy signature scheme satisfies all security properties, the scheme is secure. Furthermore, we extend our scheme for multiple signing.

40|$|Within {{ecological}} {{research and}} environmental management, {{there is currently}} a focus on demonstrating the links between human well-being and wildlife conservation. Within this framework, {{there is a clear}} interest in better understanding how and why people value certain places over others. We introduce a new method that measures cultural preferences by exploring the potential of multiple online georeferenced digital photograph collections. Using ecological and social considerations, our study contributes to the detection of places that provide cultural ecosystem services. The degree of appreciation of a specific place is derived from the number of people taking and sharing pictures of it. The sequence of decisions and actions taken to share a digital picture of a given place includes the effort to travel to the place, the willingness to take a picture, the decision to geolocate the picture, and the action of sharing it through the Internet. Hence, the social activity of sharing pictures leaves <b>digital</b> <b>proxies</b> of spatial preferences, with people sharing specific photos considering the depicted place not only "worth visiting" but also "worth sharing visually. " Using South Wales as a case study, we demonstrate how the proposed methodology can help identify key geographic features of high cultural value. These results highlight how the inclusion of geographical user-generated content, also known as volunteered geographic information, can be very effective in addressing some of the current priorities in conservation. Indeed, the detection of the most appreciated nonurban areas could be used for better prioritization, planning, and management...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- A {{distributed}} E-Business System {{based on}} conic curve is proposed. This scheme {{is composed of}} two parts, constructing license and validating license. Because the security of license is determined by private key, not the arithmetic itself, user can not construct new license by given license and the public key {{as long as the}} private key is not leaked. Since encoding and decoding over conic are easily implement on conic curves, it has enabled our scheme to greatly enhance efficiency. We also analysis its security. The entire process guarantees the security and reliability. Key-Words:- conic curve, E-Business system, public-key cryptosystem, <b>digital</b> signature, <b>proxy</b> signature...|$|R
40|$|Abstract —Due to {{the threat}} of quantum computer, the public key {{cryptosystem}} which against quantum computing has became the focus of research. This paper applies a proxy signature scheme based on McEliece public key cryptosystem, aiming at hidden danger exists in current proxy signatures. It is designed by finding the matrices that are different but equivalent to original private keys to implement proxy signature. In addition, public key matrices are well constructed to ensure the correctness of proxy signature. Analysis shows that this scheme not only has general basic properties of digital signatures, but also inherits the security of McEliece public key cryptosystem. Therefore it has much higher security.

40|$|In this paper, on {{the basis}} of Guilin Wang's proxy {{signature}} scheme and the Schnorr blind signature, we propose a secure proxy blind signature scheme. A proxy blind signature scheme is a digital signature scheme which combines the properties of a proxy signature and a blind signature scheme. Guilin Wang proposed a provably secure proxy signature scheme, which is based on a two-party Schnorr signature scheme. Also, using the proposed proxy blind signature scheme, we propose the proxy agent system for the electronic voting. We show the proposed scheme satisfies the security properties of both the blind signature and the proxy signature scheme and is efficient and optimal proxy blind signature scheme. ▸Keywords: <b>digital</b> signature, <b>proxy</b> signature, blind signature, public key cryptography, proxy agent, opimal algorith...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Archivists are faced with the challenge of ensuring access, preservation, security and storage of a rapidly growing quantity of records. The life span of records may be reduced by continuous and frequent manipulation, yet these same records might be of high interest to many scholars or journalists. These documents may also contain confidential information. One solution to these problems is to create <b>digital</b> <b>proxies</b> of these original documents. Opportunities for manipulation and access of digital documents are increasing at a steady pace. Based on an extensive survey of this field and with the specific needs of archivists in mind, this thesis presents an architecture for a digital system for archiving digital reproductions. The issues of storage, retrieval and networked environment are presented. manipulation in. a collaborative fashion in a networked environment are presented. Digital redaction, which constitutes the main theme of the thesis, is further elabo rated. Digital redaction methods and commonly used techniques employed in the editing of documents are presented. Digital redaction tools that allow users to edit textual image documents have great potential in the context of digital archives. This thesis describes CIRT, a Collaborative Image Redacting Tool designed to provide specific manipulation and editing of electronic documents by archivists. The prototypical implementation of this tool is used as a method of investigation of research issues in digital redaction of archival material by archivists. CIRT is composed of an individual editing tool, synchronous and asynchronous collaborative editing tools, a document viewer and a document access manager...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{threshold}} proxy signature scheme {{allows the}} original signer to delegate a signature {{authority to the}} proxy group to cooperatively sign message on behalf of an original signer. In this paper, we propose a new scheme which includes the features and benefits of the RSA scheme. Also, we will evaluate the security of undeniable threshold proxy signature scheme with known signers. We find that the existing threshold proxy scheme is insecure against the original signer forgery. In this paper, we show the cryptanalysis of an existed scheme. Additional, we propose the secure, undeniable and known signers threshold proxy signature scheme which answers the drawback of an existed scheme. We also demonstrate that a threshold proxy signature suffers from a conspiracy of an original signer and a secret share dealer, that the scheme is commonly forgeable, and cannot offer undeniable. We claim that the proposed scheme offers the undeniable characteristic. Keywords—cryptography; <b>digital</b> signature; <b>proxy</b> signature; threshold proxy signature I...|$|R
40|$|The proxy {{signature}} {{scheme is}} a kind of digital signature scheme. In the proxy signature scheme, one user, called the original signer, can delegate his/her signing capability to another user called the proxy signer. This is similar to a person delegating his/her seal to another person in the real world. In this paper, we propose a new type of proxy signature scheme, the self proxy signature scheme. In this scheme, a signer, Alice, delegates her signing capability to herself and uses the proxy private/public key pair as temporary keys. Using this scheme, the signer protects her original private/public key pair and uses multiple private/public key pairs simultaneously. Therefore, the signer Alice uses a temporary key pair for only a particular work. Furthermore, it is easy to revoke the temporary private/public key pair. Thus, {{it can be said that}} the proposed scheme is practical. Key words: <b>Digital</b> signature, <b>Proxy</b> signature, Public key cryptograph...|$|R

40|$|Methods for {{measuring}} the health and performance of Communities of Practice (CoP) have traditionally been limited to surveys and interviews of the membership. Practically, this means that assessments can only be done infrequently, having {{to be mindful of}} “survey fatigue ” as the enthusiasm for participation in surveys drops off with each subsequent application. As communities begin to make greater use of electronic support tools, the potential for using digitally tracked activities i. e. <b>digital</b> footprints, as <b>proxy</b> measures for actual CoP activity, is increasing. Two experiments with digital tracking of community activities are presented. The first experiment uses electronic discussion group data fed into a Social Network Analysis (SNA) visualisation tool to analyse activity patterns over a two year period. The second experiment compares a traditional SNA of a Global Network with an electronically derived sociogram using usage data collected from the web based CoP support tool used by the Network. The results were encouraging, confirming the potential for digital tracking. In particular, active discussion group analysis using SNA tools to help visualise the interactions, told quite plausible stories of what was actually happening in the networks. Digital tracking of community activity is seen as a useful adjunct to the more traditional CoP metrics. As we move more actively into the electronic age, the value and validity of non-intrusive methods like digital tracking, will become much more widespread...|$|R
