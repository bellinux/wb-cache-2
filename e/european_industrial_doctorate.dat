40|$|Background: Structural {{identifiability}} concerns {{whether the}} parameters in a postulated model structure can be uniquely determined given the {{input and output}} functions to and from that model. What this means in practice {{is that if a}} model is structurally unidentifiable, the model structure itself allows a subset (or all) of the model parameters to vary while the model output remains unchanged. Conclusions drawn from such a model are potentially unreliable. For instance, if the estimated value of Emax is of interest, but if Emax {{is a member of the}} subset of unidentifiable parameters as a result of the model structure, the estimated value of Emax is effectively meaningless. For deterministic models, there exist several different structural identifiability analysis techniques for both linear and nonlinear systems. However, little has been done on the identifiability analysis of models having a mixed-effects framework. Here the main challenge comes from the fact that, apart from having a deterministic part describing the typical individual, there is also an additional statistical sub-model describing the random effects for the parameters and the covariance between them. In population modelling, these parameters represent the variability in the population. Since estimation of the variability is often one of the main goals in population modelling, it is important to determine whether these parameters can be uniquely determined or otherwise. This motivates the need to extend the concept of structural identifiability for deterministic models to non-deterministic models such as mixed-effects models. Aim: To develop ways of analysing structural identifiability in mixed-effects models. Methods: In statistics, and in particular statistical inference, there exist problems which are similar to those encountered in parameter estimation for mixed-effect models. In this work, we make use of these similarities and use these relevant relations to study structural identifiability in mixed-effects models. Results: Some initial results from a structural identifiability analysis on a particular mixed-effects model structure are presented.

40|$|Wireless {{real-time}} {{networks are}} a natural step for deployments in industrial automation, automotive, avionics, or robotics targeting {{features such as}} improved mobility, reduced wiring costs, and easier more flexible network developments. However, the open transmission medium where wireless networks operate is generally more prone to interference and transmission errors caused by fading. Due to this, real-time communications is in general still provided by wired networks {{in many of these}} application fields. At the same time, wired and wireless standards traditionally associated with the consumer electronics application field (e. g., IEEE 802. 3 "Ethernet" and IEEE 802. 11 “WiFi”) are trying to find their way into industrial automation, automotive, avionics, and robotics use cases, since they provide features like high throughput and cheap hardware. Many times, applications with diverse real-time and reliability requirements have to co-exist, and often in hybrid wired-wireless networks to ensure compatibility with existing systems. Given this scenario, it is essential to provide support for data traffic with requirements ranging from real-time time-triggered and event-driven to non-real-time, and enable high reliability with respect to timing constraints, in the context of hybrid wired-wireless networks. This thesis aims at covering the aforementioned requirements by proposing a medium access control (MAC) solution suitable for wireless communications, with support for real-time traffic with diverse time and reliability requirements. The MAC layer is in charge of providing timely access to the transmission medium, and can be effectively used to increase reliability by means of, e. g., avoiding concurrent transmissions and performing retransmissions. To this end, a set of evaluation criteria is proposed to determine the suitability of a particular MAC method to meet the identified emerging requirements. These criteria include channel access delay, reliability, protocol overhead, capability to integrate with wired networks, and sensitivity to interference from collocated systems. Next, based on these requirements, a MAC protocol with a set of tunable features is proposed, and evaluated in terms of support for data traffic with different loads and distributions, i. e., emanating from different traffic classes, and from different number of senders. The evaluation is made both analytically, by calculating the worst case delay and, with the help of real-time schedulability analysis, determining the effective load required to guarantee real-time deadlines, as well as by means of computer simulations using the INET framework for OMNeT++ to determine the average delay. Finally, the thesis proposes a set of retransmission schemes to be used together with the proposed MAC protocols in order to improve the resistance against interference and transmission errors. For this, a set of interference patterns with different characteristics is proposed and applied in the simulator. The resulting MAC layer solution is designed to be used at the wireless segment of a hybrid wired-wireless network, and is able to schedule data traffic originating from three different classes: time-triggered, rate-constrained and best-effort. To achieve this, an additional collision domain introducing wireless segments is added to the real-time scheduler, as well as support for real-time retransmissions, to enable high reliability while keeping real-time deadlines.

40|$|The {{ultimate}} goal of industrial policy is to allow constant improvement in both the quality and standard of living. Necessary conditions to such improvement are full employment at both high, real wages and at increasing rates of productivity. For the European Economic Community, productivity must not only increase absolutely but also relatively, in comparison to other international competitors. Yet during the 60 's and early 70 's, Europe's competitive position {{in a number of}} major industrial sectors weakened, such that the energy shock, when it did come, signaled a reversal in established terms of trade. Suddenly, the Common Market was confronted with new problems of adjustment and decline. It is within this context that both the role and the focus of EEC industrial policy have changea and that come to play the underlying dynamics that shape <b>European</b> <b>industrial</b> policy formulation. In these new economic conditions, traditional policies of demand management, of counter-cyclical measures and of monetary control have proved inadequate to restore real growth, full employment and ordered structural change. While purely national solutions appear to be no longer possible in many sectors, member countries have become increasingly locked into competitive rather than the complementary industrial strategies. New and intense political strains have emerged. Political legitimacy and a clear mandate are critical to the formulation and implementation of industrial policy. Although the essential economic logic of the Treaty of Rome is clear, its political dimensions are less evident. Indeed {{there is nothing in the}} Common Market treaty about industrial policy. Yet as the question of industrial development moves to the centre of political debate, the future evolution of the community will be increasingly linked to EC industrial policy. This article analyzes <b>European</b> <b>industrial</b> policy as we enter the 80 's. It begins with an analysis of the economic realities and the social and political forces behind the changing focus of <b>European</b> <b>industrial</b> policy and examines briefly the context of industrial policy formulation at the European Community level.
