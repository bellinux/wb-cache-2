40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{has been}} {{promoting}} {{health and safety}} in mining since its establishment in 1910. One area of research covers methane control in coalbeds; this report describes a multipurpose borehole used for both degasification {{and the production of}} commercial-quality gas. The multipurpose borehole was drilled into a barrier pillar, and seven horizontal degasification holes and one pressure point hole were drilled radially out from its perimeter. On January 28, 1974, after 505 days <b>of</b> <b>degasification,</b> a compressor was installed to the exhaust stack of the multipurpose borehole (2), and pipeline [...] quality gas was introduced into a commercial pipeline. As of February 4, 1975, over 171 million cubic feet of gas had been purchased by the gas company. The in situ pressure at a depth of 200 feet into the coalbed and the average gas flow and water flow from the degasification holes as they were completed and closed off were 203 psig, 1, 200, 000 cfd, and 6. 8 gpm, respectively. Twenty-four hours after the seven holes were connected through individual pipes to the atmosphere, the total gas and water flows and the in situ pressure dropped, respectively, to 971, 000 cfd, 1. 3 gpm, and 18 psig. Five hundred days later, the corresponding values were 620, 000 cfd, 0. 15 gpm, and 10. 5 psig. Daily flows have been as high as 800, 000 cfd, and as low as 360, 000 cfd, during the last 500 days.

40|$|In the Socotá area in Boyacá, Colombia, high {{contents}} of coalbed methane have been reported. In order to prove it, additional gas measurements were done and different possibilities of degassing were considered.

Lost, desorbed and residual gases were determined separately, and proximate analyses were also carried out. In some samples the content of gas reached the 100 - 200 SCF/t.

However, these vertical boreholes are becoming so costly, and the surface rights so difficult to obtain, that the Bureau of Mines is developing underground gob gas drainage as an alternate means of methane control for U.

As the longwall retreats, an increasing portion of the hole inter 2 the fracture system over the caved gob.

40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{conducted}} research to degasify a virgin block of coal in the Beckley Coalbed using long horizontal holes drilled in an array {{from the bottom}} of a ventilation air shaft. Eight horizontal holes and an in situ pressure hole were drilled in a radial pattern to depths ranging from 418 to 910 ft (127 to 277 m) and 205 ft (62 m), respectively. The investigation showed the shaft was in a basin saturated with water, which resulted in low gas flows from holes. The in situ pressure at 200 ft (61 m) into the coalbed was 79 psig (544. 6 KN/m 2). The aver- age gas and water flows for the eight holes were 94, 100 ft 3 /day (2, 665 m 3 /day) and 13 gal/min (49. 3 l/min). After 514 days <b>of</b> <b>degasification,</b> 18. 7 million ft 3 (0. 53 million m 3) of gas had been drained.

40|$|During {{development}} mining, ventilation capacity may decrease and {{the ventilation}} requirements may depart from initially planned values {{depending on the}} mining rate, increases in the methane emission rate, and changes in ventilation airway leakages. Insufficient ventilation air quantities and the occurrences of high methane liberation rates can overwhelm the existing quantity of ventilation air and result in elevated levels of methane gas during development mining. This condition can both limit the development of that section and increase the risk for an ignition {{that may lead to}} an explosion. Thus, the prediction of ventilation air requirements prior to mining can enhance worker safety by reducing the likelihood that explosive methane-air mixtures form. This study presents an approach for prediction of methane inflow rates using coalbed methane reservoir modeling. For this purpose, a two-phase coalbed reservoir model of a three-entry type roadway is developed. In the model, grids are dynamically controlled to simulate development of entries. Examples are given for methane inflow and ventilation air requirements as a function of mining rate, development section length, mining height, and the existence <b>of</b> <b>degasification</b> boreholes. This technology can be used to limit the methane concentrations occurring {{as a result of the}} influences of various coalbed and operational parameters...|$|R
40|$|Methane {{emissions}} from the active face areas {{and from the}} fractured formations overlying the mined coalbed can affect safety and productivity in longwall mines. Since ventilation alone may {{not be sufficient to}} control the methane levels on a longwall operation, gob vent boreholes (GVB), horizontal and vertical drainage boreholes, and their combinations are drilled and used as supplementary methane control measures in many mines. However, in most cases, the types <b>of</b> <b>degasification</b> wellbores chosen are decided based on previous experiences without analyzing the different factors that may affect this decision. This study describes the development of an expert classification system used as a decision tool. It was built using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) type artificial neural network (ANN) structure. The ANN was trained using different geographical locations, longwall operation parameters, and coalbed characteristics as input and was tested to classify the output into four different selections, which are actual degasification designs that US longwall mines utilize. The ANN network selected no degasification, GVB, horizontal and GVB, and horizontal, vertical and GVB options with high accuracy. The results suggest that the model {{can be used as a}} decision tool for degasification system selection using site- and mine-specific conditions. Such a model can also be used as a screening tool to decide which degasification design should be investigated in detail with more complex numerical techniques...|$|R

The main purpose of this work was to evaluate the potential of H 2 production and respective energy consumptions and CO 2 emissions in the global fermentation process: hydrolysis of S. obliquus biomass, preparation of the fermentation medium, degasification and incubation. The scale-up to industrial production was not envisaged. Energy consumption and CO 2 emissions estimations were based on SimaPro 7. 1 software for {{the preparation of the}} fermentation medium and the use <b>of</b> <b>degasification</b> gas, nitrogen.

40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} {{the efficiency of}} dissolved methane (D-CH 4) collection by degasification from the effluent of a bench-scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor treating synthetic wastewater. A hollow-fiber degassing membrane module was used for degasification. This module {{was connected to the}} liquid outlet of the UASB reactor. After chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency of the UASB reactor became stable, D-CH 4 discharged from the UASB reactor was collected. Under 35 °C and a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 10 h, average D-CH 4 concentration could be reduced from 63 mg COD L– 1 to 15 mg COD L– 1; this, in turn, resulted in an increase in total methane (CH 4) recovery efficiency from 89 % to 97 %. Furthermore, {{we investigated}} the effects of temperature and HRT of the UASB reactor on degasification efficiency. Average D-CH 4 concentration was as high as 104 mg COD L– 1 at 15 °C because of the higher solubility of CH 4 gas in liquid; the average D-CH 4 concentration was reduced to 14 mg COD L– 1 by degasification. Accordingly, total CH 4 recovery efficiency increased from 71 % to 97 % at 15 °C as a result <b>of</b> <b>degasification.</b> Moreover, degasification tended to cause an increase in particulate COD removal efficiency. The UASB reactor was operated at the same COD loading rate, but different wastewater feed rates and HRTs. Although average D-CH 4 concentration in the UASB reactor was almost unchanged (ca. 70 mg COD L– 1) regardless of the HRT value, the CH 4 discharge rate from the UASB reactor increased because of an increase in the wastewater feed rate. Because the D-CH 4 concentration could be reduced down to 12 ± 1 mg COD L– 1 by degasification at an HRT of 6. 7 h, the 3 CH 4 recovery rate was 1. 5 times higher under degasification than under normal operation...|$|R
