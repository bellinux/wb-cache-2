5|$|Back at the Emperor's palace, Faythe {{decides that}} she must see Gabriel again. Disguising herself, she begins to travel back to Ravenskill. Arabelle, knowing about her daughter's intentions, instructs Daryus to follow and protect her. Daryus feels {{he has always been}} {{overlooked}} by his father in favor of his sister, so he travels to the town with his own intentions ("A Life Left Behind"). Faythe arrives in the town and finds Xander, who trusts her and leads her to his father Arhys. Faythe convinces Arhys that she can help, so he brings her to Gabriel's hideout. Gabriel and Faythe embrace, and she tells him that she believes she can convince her father to give up his hunt for Gabriel ("Ravenskill"). Gabriel tells her that if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> meet with the Emperor, he could inspire him to restore peace to the land using his gift of music ("Chosen").|$|E
25|$|The Rev. Raymond Davis was {{installed}} as rector of Truro in 1948. He {{said that he}} would be pleased if <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> <b>just</b> once, fill all one hundred seats of the little brick church. Not only were all the seats filled, but the growing congregation began to burst at the seams as the great suburban expansion of Northern Virginia began in the 1950s. In 1959, a new and larger church was completed with a seating capacity of 500. The congregation first worshiped in the new church on Palm Sunday, 1959, and when the mortgage was paid off in 1974, a new Truro Church building was consecrated. The old church building is now known as the Chapel. Numerous services are still held throughout the week in the historic chapel, including contemporary worship services.|$|E
500|$|The {{first thing}} for a private {{secretary}} {{to do is to}} study her employer. After I went to work for Mr. Roosevelt, for months I read carefully all the letters he dictated ... I learned what letters he wanted to see and which ones it was not necessary to show him ... I came to know exactly how Mr. Roosevelt would answer some of his letters, how he would couch his thoughts. When he discovered that I had learned these things it took a load off his shoulders, for instead of having to dictate the answers to many letters <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> say yes or no and I knew what to say and how to say it.|$|E
50|$|A month later, Malike phoned Renner {{and asked}} him if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{purchase}} <b>just</b> 100 Valium pills and 50 sleeping pills for $150, and met up with him for a fourth time.|$|R

500|$|The letter serves {{one other}} purpose: to {{delight in the}} Drapier's lack of being {{captured}} and his victory over Whitshed. William Whitshed, Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench in Ireland, {{was the one who}} actually arrested Harding and sought to convict him of printing treasonous materials. A letter written anonymously by Swift, [...] "Seasonable Advice to the Grand-Jury", motivated the Irish jury to stand up against Whitshed and release the printer. The Drapier hints at the letter and the freeing of Harding when he lists many other works written by Jonathan Swift, and, in the process, nearly reveals his own identity. However, his tone may not be mocking, as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> be flaunting his own position, and some have credited this idea to the incorporation of so many Biblical and Classical allusions beyond the three that begin the letter. Scholar Herbert Davis declared this letter is [...] "in some ways the best written of all the Letters".|$|E
500|$|Bates {{called the}} {{recording}} process [...] "seamless" [...] {{because of the}} unconventional studio environment. Manson, isolated in a vocal booth {{with no more than}} three people in the control room at any one time, was free to improvise or develop new lyrics and vocal melodies at a high speed. By using Pro Tools, Bates was able to [...] "manipulate the music {{in a way that would}} allow [...] to just keep working on it without causing [...] If he had an idea, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> throw it down without there being a lot to explain." [...] The majority of the album was recorded during a three-month period. The band's manager, Tony Ciulla, only became aware that Manson had been recording new material when he was invited to Bates' home recording studio, where Bates played final cuts of nine of the album's ten tracks; [...] "Cupid Carries a Gun" [...] was the only track not yet completed. With the base tracks recorded, overdubbing took place over the following six months between Manson's acting commitments on Sons of Anarchy and Bates scoring the 2014 television series Salem.|$|E
500|$|Hopkins was {{generally}} expected to reprise his Academy Award-winning role. Hopkins did say in June 1999 {{that he would}} only be interested if the script was [...] "really good". Hopkins says on the making-of feature on DVD that he couldn’t {{make up his mind}} to commit. [...] "I was kind of surprised by this book, Hannibal. I thought it was really overreaching and so bizarre. So I couldn’t make up my mind about it all. Some of it I found intriguing, some I was a little doubtful about." [...] When the producers confirmed {{that they were going to}} film Harris' novel, Hopkins told them yes, but added: [...] "It needs some condensing." [...] The Hollywood Reporter would confirm that Hopkins had agreed to reprise his role in late December 1999, saying he had approved the latest [...] of the script by Steven Zaillian. Hopkins said he had no difficulty moving back into [...] "Lecter's mind". [...] "I just learned the lines and showed up and walked around as Hannibal Lecter. I thought, 'Do I repeat that same performance, or do I vary it?' Ten years had passed so I changed a bit." [...] In the book, Lecter uses bandages to disguise himself as a plastic surgery patient. This was left out of the film because Scott and Hopkins agreed to leave the face alone. Hopkins explains why: [...] "It's as if he's making a statement—'catch me if you can'. With his big hat, he's so obvious that nobody thinks he's Hannibal Lecter. I've always thought he's a very elegant man, a Renaissance man." [...] In the film, Lecter is first seen in Florence [...] "as the classical Lecter, lecturing and being smooth", according to Hopkins. When the film moves to the U.S., Hopkins changed his appearance by building up muscle and cropping his hair short [...] "to make him like a mercenary, that he would be so fit and so strong that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> snap somebody in two if they got... in his way".|$|E
60|$|It was morning. She {{came down}} the same as usual, and asked if there had arrived any {{telegram}} or letter; but there was neither. Louis avoided her, knowing that nothing <b>he</b> <b>could</b> say <b>just</b> then would do her any good.|$|R
5000|$|An eager {{prisoner}} functionary {{could have}} a camp [...] "career" [...] as an SS favorite and be promoted from Kapo to Oberkapo and eventually to Lagerältester, but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> also <b>just</b> as easily run afoul of the SS and {{be sent to the}} gas chambers.|$|R

500|$|Early in the series, Clark {{was still}} {{learning}} how to handle his life, by learning to control his powers and find the best solution for everyone. His main priority was {{to fit in with}} his friends at school and be an average guy. Initially, Clark's biggest problem was the fact that he could not share his secret with anyone he cared about. According to Welling, [...] "He is burdened with a lot of responsibility. He hasn't been able to choose whether or not he has these abilities. All this responsibility has just been thrust on him, and he has to deal with it. There have got to be times when he goes home and thinks to himself, ‘Why me?' He wishes it could all go away and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> be normal. That's part of the character dilemma which makes him interesting to play." [...] Welling noted that the show was not about Clark always saving the day, but more about how using his powers [...] "... alienate him from others". Welling reasoned {{that by the end of}} season three, Clark had decided that leaving Smallville and going with Jor-El was something that would save everyone a lot of pain in the long run. Welling described why Clark finally gave in to Jor-El at the end of season three:"If you can't fight them, you might as well join them [...] he was choosing the lesser of two evils to go with Jor-El. I think a combination of those two things would probably sum it up. A lot of times in your life, you get to a point where you go, 'I just can't fight this anymore. There's nothing I can do about it, so I better get up out of bed and go to work!' And in a sense, that's what Clark had to do. Somehow he had to try to face what it was that was causing him so much pain—and everyone else so much pain—and maybe he reasoned that by causing everyone else a little bit of pain, he could save them a lot of pain in the long run." ...|$|E

2500|$|Charles Sporck retold another incident: {{during a}} European {{roadshow}} Widlar got drunk and publicly {{refused to speak}} to the audience unless he got more gin. Sporck said that [...] "We had no choice. We had to get his glass filled up. And then he went on with the lecture. And he, you know, he got plastered, but the interesting part of it is he was just so damn smart, you know. Even drunk <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> wow these people." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of the marvellous {{things about}} John Bonham which made things very easy [...] {{was the fact}} that he really knew how to tune his drums, and I tell you what, that was pretty rare in drummers in those days. He really knew how to make the {{instrument}} sing, and because of that, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> get so much volume out of it by just playing with his wrists. It was just an astonishing technique that was sort of pretty holistic if you know what I mean.|$|E
2500|$|In a field {{starved for}} {{vigorous}} writing, colorful characters and invigorating plot lines, Brooks's prose {{was seen by}} contemporary critics as a long-overdue tonic. But seen from today's vantage, many of Brooks's assumptions seem almost quaint, writes The New Yorkers current financial writer James Surowiecki. On reading Brooks's The Seven Fat Years several decades later, Brooks's account of the managing of General Motors's first-ever secondary offering in 1955, [...] "the business world Brooks describes seems so oddly innocent, so unvoracious that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> as well be talking about children playing Monopoly." ...|$|E

2500|$|Piper is {{considered}} one of the greatest talkers and heels in wrestling history. Piper's Pit interview segments were considered innovative, especially in an atmosphere where only the people like the world champion got to talk, and the wrestlers were the interviewees—never the interviewers. Many of the people on Piper's Pit never got to be world champion, but were main eventers. According to Bobby [...] "The Brain" [...] Heenan, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> leave Piper in a room and return twenty minutes later with Piper having done a class-A promo.

2500|$|The musicians {{on these}} {{recordings}} included Harrison on guitars and bass; Temple members such as Yamuna on lead vocals; and other devotees on backing vocals, mridanga, harmonium, tambura and kartal. Harrison was much impressed with Yamuna's voice and suggested she could become [...] "a famous rock star". In a 1982 discussion with Mukunda, Harrison said: [...] "I {{liked the way}} [...] sang with conviction, and she sang [...] like she'd been singing it a lot before. It didn't sound like the first [...] tune she'd ever sung." [...] Discussing Harrison's role in the studio, Gurudas, Yamuna's husband, has compared him with the Hare Krishna movement's leader, saying: [...] "George was like Prabhupada, {{he could be a}} ringmaster – <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> pull everything together." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1951 he {{made his}} final {{first-class}} appearance, which came for the Minor Counties cricket team against Kent. In his final first-class match, he scored 8 runs in the Minor Counties first-innings and an unbeaten 21 in their second-innings. However, he went wicket-less with the ball and Kent won by an innings. This meant he went winless in his 57 first-class appearances, a record {{for the number of}} first-class appearances without featuring in a win. Perkins continued to play for Suffolk in the Minor Counties Championship until 1967, having by then made 105 appearances for the county. By the time of his retirement at the age of 56, he had claimed a record 779 wickets for the county, some way ahead of Colin Rutterford's 431. Such was Perkins' accuracy as a bowler, The Daily Telegraph reporter Simon Parry-Crooke described watching him bowl as: [...] "he had this incredible control: <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> drop the ball on a handkerchief." [...] Indeed, he once took 10 wickets in an innings, when playing against Hertfordshire in 1960. He still had the match ball when he celebrated his 100th birthday. Perkins also made a solitary List A appearance for Suffolk at the age of 55 in the 1966 Gillette Cup against a powerful Kent side at Ipswich School. He bowled 12 wicket-less overs for the cost of 31 runs, while he wasn't required to bat in the Suffolk innings as Kent ran out winners by 113 runs.|$|E
