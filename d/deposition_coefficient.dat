40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{identify}} concentration levels of different chemical forms of mercury (TGM, TPM) in the ambient air in selected areas of the Silesian Region, characterized by low and high mercury emission. Based on the obtained data TGM and TPM concentration levels were determined. The project also focused on determination of dry and wet deposition of mercury compounds. Data concerning TGM and TPM flux rates in the ambient air and data on mercury deposition {{were used to determine}} a <b>deposition</b> <b>coefficient.</b> The coefficient was calculated as a share of mercury deposition on the land surface (dry and wet) to the amount of this contaminant transported with loads of air in the form of TGM and TPM in a given measurement station.

A model for the deposition of large droplets based on the droplet sticking efficiency to the tube wall is proposed.

40|$|Transport and {{deposition}} of nanoparticles in porous media is a multi-scale problem governed by several pore scale processes, and hence, {{it is critical}} to link the processes at pore scale to the Darcy-scale behavior. In this study, using pore network modeling, we develop correlation equations for <b>deposition</b> rate <b>coefficients</b> for nano particle transport under unfavorable conditions at the Darcy scale based on pore-scale mechanisms. The upscaling tool is a multi-directional pore-network model consisting of an interconnected network of pores with variable connectivities. Correlation equations describing the pore-averaged <b>deposition</b> rate <b>coefficients</b> under unfavorable conditions in a cylindrical pore, developed in our earlier studies, are employed for each pore element. Pore-network simulations are performed {{for a wide range of}} parameter values to obtain the breakthrough curves of nanoparticle concentration. The latter is fitted with macroscopic 1 -D advection-dispersion equation with a two-site linear reversible deposition accounting for both equilibrium and kinetic sorption. This leads to the estimation of three Darcy-scale <b>deposition</b> coefficients: distribution <b>coefficient,</b> kinetic rate constant, and the fraction of equilibrium sites. The correlation equations for the Darcy-scale <b>deposition</b> <b>coefficients,</b> under unfavorable conditions, are provided as a function of measurable Darcy-scale parameters, including: porosity, mean pore throat radius, mean pore water velocity, nanoparticle radius, ionic strength, dielectric constant, viscosity, temperature, and surface potentials of the particle and grain surfaces. The correlation equations are found to be consistent with the available experimental results, and in qualitative agreement with Colloid Filtration Theory for all parameters, except for the mean pore water velocity and nanoparticle radius.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Simulations of tropical-tropopause-layer (TTL) cirrus {{under the}} {{influence}} of a large-scale equatorial Kelvin wave have been performed in two dimensions. These simulations show that, even {{under the influence}} of the large-scale wave, radiatively induced dynamics in TTL cirrus plays an important role in the transport of water vapor in the vertical direction. In a typical TTL cirrus, the heating that results from absorption of radiation by ice crystals induces a mesoscale circulation. Advection of ice and water vapor by the radiatively induced circulation leads to the persistence of the cloud and upward advection of the cloudy air. Upward advection of the cloudy air is equivalent to upward transport of water vapor when the air above the cloud is drier than the cloudy air, and downward transport otherwise. In TTL cirrus, microphysical processes also contribute to transport of water vapor in the vertical direction. Ice nucleation and growth, followed by sedimentation and sublimation, always lead to downward transport of water vapor. The magnitude of the downward transport by microphysical processes increases with the relative humidity of the air surrounding the cloud. Moisture in the surrounding environment is important because there is continuous interactions between the cloudy and environmental air throughout the cloud boundary. In our simulations, when the air surrounding the cloud is subsaturated, hence drier than the cloudy air, the magnitude of the downward transport due to microphysical processes is smaller than that of the upward transport due to the radiatively induced advection of water vapor. The net result is upward transport of water vapor, and equivalently hydration of the lower stratosphere. On the other hand, when the surrounding air is supersaturated, hence moister than the cloudy air, microphysical and radiatively induced dynamical processes work in concert to induce downward transport of water vapor, that is dehydration of the lower stratosphere. TTL cirrus processes also depend sensitively on the <b>deposition</b> <b>coefficient</b> of water vapor on ice crystals. The <b>deposition</b> <b>coefficient</b> determines the depositional growth rate of ice crystals, hence microphysical and radiative properties of the cloud. In our simulations, larger values of the <b>deposition</b> <b>coefficient</b> correspond to less ice crystals nucleated during homogeneous freezing, larger ice crystal sizes, faster ice sedimentation, smaller radiative heating rate and weaker dynamics. These results indicate that detailed observations of the relative humidity in the vicinity of TTL cirrus and accurate laboratory measurements of the <b>deposition</b> <b>coefficient</b> are necessary to quantify the impact of TTL cirrus in the dehydration of the stratosphere. This research highlights the complex role of microphysical, radiative and dynamical processes in the transport of water vapor within TTL cirrus. It shows that under certain realistic conditions, TTL cirrus may lead to upward transport of water vapor, which results in moistening of the lower stratosphere. Thus it is not accurate to always associate TTL cirrus with stratospheric dehydration...|$|E

For example, if the <b>deposition</b> <b>coefficient</b> of H 182 O differs by just 5 % from that of ordinary water (H 162 O), the resulting fractionation coefficient at 20 % supersaturation may deviate from the KF value by up to about ± 17 ‰, and even more at greater supersaturation. As a result, the surface-kinetic theory may significantly change how fractionation depends on supersaturation.

40|$|Nanoparticle {{deposition}} behavior {{observed at}} the Darcy scale represents {{an average of}} the processes occurring at the pore scale. Hence, the effect of various pore-scale parameters on nanoparticle deposition can be understood by studying nanoparticle transport at pore scale and upscaling the results to the Darcy scale. In this work, correlation equations for the <b>deposition</b> rate <b>coefficients</b> of nanoparticles in a cylindrical pore are developed {{as a function of}} nine pore-scale parameters: the pore radius, nanoparticle radius, mean flow velocity, solution ionic strength, viscosity, temperature, solution dielectric constant, and nanoparticle and collector surface potentials. Based on dominant processes, the pore space is divided into three different regions, namely, bulk, diffusion, and potential regions. Advection-diffusion equations for nanoparticle transport are prescribed for the bulk and diffusion regions, while the interaction between the diffusion and potential regions is included as a boundary condition. This interaction is modeled as a first-order reversible kinetic adsorption. The expressions for the mass transfer rate coefficients between the diffusion and the potential regions are derived in terms of the interaction energy profile. Among other effects, we account for nanoparticle-collector interaction forces on nanoparticle deposition. The resulting equations are solved numerically for a range of values of pore-scale parameters. The nanoparticle concentration profile obtained for the cylindrical pore is averaged over a moving averaging volume within the pore {{in order to get the}} 1 -D concentration field. The latter is fitted to the 1 -D advection-dispersion equation with an equilibrium or kinetic adsorption model to determine the values of the average <b>deposition</b> rate <b>coefficients.</b> In this study, pore-scale simulations are performed for three values of Peclet number, Pe = 0. 05, 5, and 50. We find that under unfavorable conditions, the nanoparticle deposition at pore scale is best described by an equilibrium model at low Peclet numbers (Pe = 0. 05) and by a kinetic model at high Peclet numbers (Pe = 50). But, at an intermediate Pe (e. g., near Pe = 5), both equilibrium and kinetic models fit the 1 -D concentration field.

Low ice number concentrations ([*]<[*]  200  L − 1) and high supersaturations (150 – 160  %) have been observed in these clouds. Different mechanisms have been proposed to explain these low ice number concentrations, including the inhibition of homogeneous freezing by the deposition of water vapour onto pre-existing ice crystals, heterogeneous ice formation on glassy organic aerosol ice nuclei (IN), and limiting the formation of ice number from high-frequency gravity waves. In this study, we examined the effect from three different representations of updraft velocities, the effect from pre-existing ice crystals, the effect from different water vapour deposition coefficients (α  [*]=[*]  0. 1 or  1), and the effect of 0. 1  % of the total secondary organic aerosol (SOA) particles acting as IN. Model-simulated ice crystal numbers are compared against an aircraft observational dataset. Including the effect from water vapour deposition on pre-existing ice particles can effectively reduce simulated in-cloud ice number concentrations for all model setups. A larger water vapour <b>deposition</b> <b>coefficient</b> (α  [*]=[*]  1) can also efficiently reduce ice number concentrations at temperatures below 205  K, but less so at higher temperatures. SOA acting as IN is most effective at reducing ice number concentrations when the effective updraft velocities are moderate ([*]∼[*]  0. 05 – 0. 2  m s − 1). However, the effects of including SOA as IN and using (α  [*]=[*]  1) are diminished when the effect from pre-existing ice is included. When a grid-resolved large-scale updraft velocity ([*]<[*]  0. 1  m s − 1) is used, the ice nucleation parameterization with homogeneous freezing only or with both homogeneous freezing and heterogeneous nucleation is able to generate low ice number concentrations in good agreement with observations for temperatures below 205  K as long as the pre-existing ice effect is included.

40|$|International audienceThe {{homogeneous}} freezing of supercooled H 2 SO 4 /H 2 O aerosols in an aerosol chamber is investigated with a microphysical box model {{using the}} activity parameterization of the nucleation rate by Koop et al (2000). The simulations are constrained by measurements of pressure, temperature, total water mixing ratio, {{and the initial}} aerosol size distribution, described in a companion paper Möhler et al. (2002). Model results are compared to measurements conducted in the temperature range between 194 and 235 K, with cooling rates in the range between 0. 5 and 2. 6 K min - 1, and at air pressures between 170 and 1000 hPa. The simulations focus on the time history of relative humidity with respect to ice, aerosol size distribution, partitioning of water between gas and particle phase, onset times of freezing, freezing threshold relative humidities, aerosol chemical composition {{at the onset of}} freezing, and the number of nucleated ice crystals. The latter three parameters can directly be inferred from the experiments, the former three aid in interpreting the measurements. Sensitivity studies are carried out to address the relative importance of uncertainties of basic quantities such as temperature, H 2 O mixing ratio, aerosol size spectrum, and <b>deposition</b> <b>coefficient</b> of H 2 O molecules on ice. The ability of the numerical simulations to provide detailed explanations of the observations greatly increases confidence in attempts to model this process under real atmospheric conditions, for instance with regard to the formation of cirrus clouds or type-II polar stratospheric clouds, provided that accurate temperature and humidity measurements are available...|$|E
40|$|Column {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate the transport and deposition behavior of representative hydrophobic and hydrophilic bacteria strains in sand at different water saturations. These strains are similar in surface charge, shape, and size, and differ primarily in their surface hydrophobicity and tendency to form aggregates. The amount of bacteria that were retained in the sand increased with decreasing water saturation, especially for the more hydrophobic strain that formed larger cell aggregates. Most of the cells were retained close to the column inlet, {{and the rate of}} deposition rapidly decreased with depth. The experimental data were analyzed using a mathematical model that accounted for deposition on two kinetic sites. Consideration of depth-dependent deposition in the model formulation significantly improved the description of the data, and the amount of cell retention was typically dominated by this site. The depth-dependent <b>deposition</b> <b>coefficient</b> tended to increase with decreasing water content, especially for the hydrophobic bacteria. Straining is believed to account for these observations because it increases in magnitude with increasing cell and aggregate size and when a greater fraction of the water flows through a larger number of small pore spaces with decreasing water content. Cell retention on the other kinetic deposition site was well described using a conventional model for attachment and detachment. Consistent with interaction energy calculations for bacteria attachment, however, low amounts of cell retention occurred on this site. Attempts to separately determine the amounts of attachment to solid-water and air-water interfaces were confounded by the influence of straining...|$|E
40|$|Bag {{sampling}} {{techniques can}} be used to temporarily store an aerosol and therefore provide sufficient time to utilize sensitive but slow instrumental techniques for recording detailed particle size distributions. Laboratory based assessment of the method were conducted to examine size dependant <b>deposition</b> loss <b>coefficients</b> for aerosols held in VelostatTM bags conforming to a horizontal cylindrical geometry. Deposition losses of NaCl particles in the range of 10 nm to 160 nm were analysed in relation to the bag size, storage time, and sampling flow rate. Results {{of this study suggest that}} the bag sampling method is most useful for moderately short sampling periods of about 5 minutes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{transport}} of pathogenic bacteria from wastewater treatment facilities in subsurface has attracted extensive concerns over recent decades, while {{the impact of}} effluent water chemistry remains unclear. The influence of retention time in effluent from a {{municipal wastewater treatment plant}} on bacterial surface properties and deposition of Escherichia coli strains in saturated quartz sand packed-bed columns was investigated in this paper. Retentions in effluent significantly altered bacterial surface properties, such as zeta potential, surface charge and hydrophobicity, subsequently changed their <b>deposition</b> rate <b>coefficients</b> and attachment efficiencies in quartz sand packed-bed columns. Under low ionic strength conditions, bacterial deposition onto quartz sand grains was in agreement with the predictions of DLVO theory, in which the secondary energy minimum was demonstrated to be predominant...|$|R
40|$|Boiling heat {{transfer}} to fluid flow in microchannel heat sinks is being {{looked upon as}} a promising {{solution to the problem}} of cooling microprocessors with large power densities. In the present work, an annular flow model [1] is implemented to investigate the boiling {{heat transfer}} and two-phase flow characteristics in microchannel heat sinks. A modification in the model for the <b>deposition</b> mass transfer <b>coefficient</b> is proposed to better compare the existing experimental data [2]. The <b>deposition</b> mass transfer <b>coefficient</b> affects the distribution of liquid in the form of entrained droplets and the liquid film. The liquid film thickness is the most significant parameter in the determination of the heat transfer coefficient. The suggested change ensures consistent results for the behavior of the entrained fraction. We further report pressure drop results obtained using the modified annular flow model and a comparison with existing experimental data. Finally, we present results predicted by the annular flow model for non-uniform heating of a microchannel, in an effort to simulate hot spots on a microprocessor chip. A few preliminary results obtained from the modified model to simulate boiling and two-phase flow in a parallel microchannel device with non-uniform heating are presented...|$|R
