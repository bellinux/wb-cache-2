25|$|On October 17, 2017 Frank Ocean's dad, Calvin Cooksey, sued Frank {{on charges}} of {{defamation}} and other damages with restitution payments reaching up to 14.5 million dollars. The issue started when Frank Ocean wrote a post in his personal Tumblr responding to the Pulse Nightclub shooting back in June 2016 and told {{a story about how}} when he was a kid, he heard his father use a transphobic slur towards a waitress. The post stated that:'I was six years old when I heard my dad call our transgender waitress a f***** as he dragged me out a neighborhood diner saying we wouldn’t be served because she was dirty. 'That was the last afternoon <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and the first time I heard that word, I think, although it wouldn’t shock me if it wasn’t. Many hate us and wish we didn’t exist.' The judge ended up ruling in favor of Frank Ocean and the case was put to an end.|$|E
500|$|It {{was about}} {{two in the morning}} of August 27 that I was awakened by seeing a soldier at the side of my bed. I got up and dressed and went down to the barroom, where <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> {{standing}} in one corner with three British soldiers before him with muskets and bayonets fixed. The army was then lying in the field in front of the house.... General Howe and another officer were in the barroom. General Howe wore a camlet cloak over his regimentals. After asking for a glass of liquor from the bar, which was given him, he entered into familiar conversation with my father, and among other things said, [...] "I must have some one of you to show me over the Rockaway Path around the pass." [...] My father replied, [...] "We belong to the other side, General, and can’t serve you against our duty." [...] General Howe replied, [...] "That is alright; stick to your country, or stick to your principles, but Howard, you are my prisoner and must guide my men over the hill." [...] My father made some further objection, but was silenced by the general, who said, [...] "You have no alternative. If you refuse I shall shoot you through the head." ...|$|E
60|$|ARETHUSA. One thing puzzles me: {{how did you}} get in? <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> {{lock the}} door.|$|E
6000|$|... "My Lord," [...] said Richard, coming near, [...] "methought <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> face under a visor--one of the knightly guards {{beside the}} holy King." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Is that so?" [...] exclaimed Steinar, bewildered. [...] "Well, as <b>I</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> or <b>my</b> brothers, {{and they}} treated me but ill, I cannot weep for them." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{got under}} way in fine style, and as the pungy swung around with the current, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> waving his hat from the craft to which he belonged, and thus knew he {{understood}} we were bound on some service for the commander.|$|E
60|$|I Saw {{then what}} a man's face {{may look like}} when he is {{stricken}} with a sudden paralysing fear. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> sit {{in his chair and}} shake from head to foot. Ray's black eyes seemed to be flashing upon us all the most unutterable scorn.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{like being}} haunted. I {{read a story}} somewhere of a fellow who kept {{thinking}} he saw a battleship bearing down on him. I've got it, too. Four {{times in the last}} three days I could have sworn <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and Edwin. I saw them as plainly as I see you. And, of course, Edwin's at home and father's in Europe somewhere. Do you think it's some sort of a warning? Do you think I'm going to die?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Now, {{while they}} spake, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> face [...] Grow long and troubled like a rising moon, [...] Inflamed with wrath: he started on his feet, [...] Tore the king's letter, snowed it down, and rent [...] The {{wonder of the}} loom through warp and woof [...] From skirt to skirt; and at the last he sware [...] That he would send a hundred {{thousand}} men, [...] And bring her in a whirlwind: then he chewed [...] The thrice-turned cud of wrath, and cooked his spleen, [...] Communing with his captains of the war.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think he}} is;--but I do not know. <b>I</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> {{so as to}} {{remember}} him; though I do remember {{that we used to}} be very unhappy when we were in Spain." ...|$|R
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> scruples {{were much}} {{softened}} by {{the consciousness of}} his superiority in the legal argument, I took care to accept my pardon {{as a matter of}} grace, rather than of justice; and only replied, we should feel ourselves duller of an evening, now that you were absent. I will give you <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> exact words in reply, Darsie. You know him so well, that they will not offend you; and you are also aware, that there mingles with the good man's preciseness and formality, a fund of shrewd observation and practical good sense.|$|R
60|$|I gently {{pushed him}} through the doorway, and {{went back into the}} transept, down the nave, and onward to the west door. There <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> to whom I spoke. He {{answered}} severely that, having first obtained comfortable quarters in a pension on the Grand Canal, he had gone back to the hotel on the Riva degli Schiavoni to find me; but that I was not there. He was now waiting for Caroline, to accompany her back to the pension, at which she had requested to be left to herself as much as possible till she could regain some composure.|$|E
60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> {{and mother}} and my sister Helen {{standing}} there on the stone foot-walk, as the cars rolled in, I was amazed. I hadn't expected them. It was all right enough for Rectus to expect his father and mother, for they lived in New York, but I had supposed that I should meet my folks at the station in Willisville. But it was a capital idea in {{them to come to}} New York. They said they couldn't wait at home, and besides, they wanted to see and know the Chippertons, for we all seemed so bound together, now.|$|E
6000|$|... "As it died slowly away, {{there was}} a rasping and {{creaking}} as of keys and bolts, followed by the clang of an opening door and the clatter of hurrying feet. From my window <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and Corporal Rufus Smith rush frantically {{out of the house}} hatless and unkempt, like men who are obeying a sudden and overpowering impulse. The three strangers laid no hands on them, but all five swept swiftly away down the avenue and vanished among the trees. I am positive that no force was used, or constraint of any visible kind, and yet I am as sure that my poor father and his companion were helpless prisoners as it I bad seen them dragged away in manacles.|$|E
60|$|My heavy head {{dropped into}} my hands, and I groaned. Many a temperance tale perused on Sunday afternoons {{came back to}} me. Imaginative in all directions, I watched myself hastening toward a drunkard's grave, now heroically {{struggling}} against temptation, now weakly yielding, the craving growing upon me. In the misty air about me <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> white face, <b>my</b> mother's sad eyes. I thought of Barbara, of the scorn that could quiver round that bewitching mouth; of Hal, with his tremendous contempt for all forms of weakness. Shame of the present and terror of the future between them racked my mind.|$|R
60|$|He moved a {{few steps}} towards them, and then paused. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>my</b> <b>father</b> was leaning forward, and in his shaking hand was a tiny gleaming revolver. A certain desperate courage seemed to have come to him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'They've been {{carrying}} on this game,' thought Jonas {{in a brown}} study, 'for {{the last two or}} three weeks. <b>I</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> take so much notice of him as he has in that time. What! You're legacy hunting, are you, Mister Chuff? Eh?' ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was past}} two o'clock when {{by a sudden}} turn I found myself close to the lake near a cove where a little skiff was moored--It was not far from our house and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and aunt walking on the lawn. I jumped into the boat, and well {{accustomed}} to such feats, I pushed it from shore, and exerted all my strength to row swiftly across. As I came, dressed in white, covered only by my tartan rachan, my hair streaming on my shoulders, and shooting across with greater speed {{that it could be}} supposed I could give to my boat, my father has often told me that I looked more like a spirit than a human maid. I approached the shore, my father held the boat, I leapt lightly out, and in a moment was in his arms.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had been}} with my mother to carry some clothes to my father on the last {{occasion}} on which I saw him. As we neared the castle <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and three other of the workmen, together with the baron, {{coming down from the}} castle toward the spot. As my mother did not wish to approach while the baron was at hand, we stood within the trees {{at the edge of the}} wood and watched what was being done. The baron came with them down to the bushes, and then they again came out, crossed the river, and one of them cut some willows, peeled them, and erected the white staves in a line toward the castle. They walked for a bit on each side, and seemed to be making calculations. Then they went back into the castle, and I never saw my father again." ...|$|E
60|$|That was {{the first}} and only time <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> kill a bird, and nothing but his extreme anger against the robber of his {{precious}} pigeons would have made him do a thing so contrary to his nature. He was quite willing to have birds killed--young pigeons, wild ducks, plover, snipe, whimbrel, tinamou or partridge, and various others which he liked to eat--but the killing always had to be done by others. He hated to see any bird killed that was not for the table, and that was why he tolerated the falcon, and even allowed a pair of caranchos, or carrion-eagles--birds destructive to poultry, and killers when they got the chance of newly-born lambs and sucking- pigs--to have their huge nest in one of the old peach-trees for several years. I never saw him angrier than once when a visitor staying in the house, going out with his gun one day suddenly threw it up to his shoulder and brought down a passing swallow.|$|E
60|$|Once more, {{what could}} <b>I</b> say? <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> from <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> hurried and alarmed manner, {{that nothing could}} vex him so much as failing in the point he had {{determined}} to carry, and once more intimated my readiness to do my best, under every disadvantage.|$|R
6000|$|... "With my father," [...] reiterated Beresteyn. [...] "That fool, Hals, {{was with}} him, {{and there were}} another half dozen busy-bodies sitting round the table. Our man was evidently the centre of interest; I could not then hear what was said, but at one moment <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>my</b> <b>father</b> shook him cordially by the hand." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{caught the}} general there, and, {{while my mother}} turned her head aside and smiled, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>my</b> <b>father</b> colored a little, though he made out to laugh. After a moment of embarrassment, however, he {{answered}} with spirit--my good, old grandmother coming up and linking her arm at his vacant side as he did so.|$|R
60|$|Fatigue kept me in {{bed next}} morning {{until it was}} late. On quitting the house I passed through the gateway, then always left open--defence being no longer thought of--and walked musingly toward the grave of Chainbearer. Previously to doing this, I {{went as far as}} each corner of the building, however, to cast an eye over the fields. On one side of the house <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and mother, arm in arm, gazing around them; while on the other, aunt Mary stood by herself, looking wistfully in the {{direction}} of a wooded ravine, which had been the scene of some important event in the early history of the country. When she turned to re-enter the building, I found her face bathed in tears. This respectable woman, who was now well turned of forty, had lost her betrothed in battle, on that very spot, a quarter of a century before, and was now gazing on the sad scene for the first time since the occurrence of the event.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly I was {{conscious}} {{that my father}} was in the room, but not alone: there were two persons with him. Strange! I had heard no footstep, I had not seen the door open; but <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> and at his right hand our neighbour Mrs. Filmore, whom I remembered very well, though I had not seen her for five years. She was a commonplace middle-aged woman, in silk and cashmere; but the lady on the left of my father was not more than twenty, a tall, slim, willowy figure, with luxuriant blond hair, arranged in cunning braids and folds that looked almost too massive for the slight figure and the small-featured, thin-lipped face they crowned. But the face had not a girlish expression: the features were sharp, the pale grey eyes at once acute, restless, and sarcastic. They were fixed on me in half-smiling curiosity, and I felt a painful sensation as if a sharp wind were cutting me. The pale-green dress, and the green leaves that seemed to form a border about her pale blond hair, made me think of a Water-Nixie--for my mind was full of German lyrics, and this pale, fatal-eyed woman, with the green weeds, looked like a birth from some cold sedgy stream, the daughter of an aged river.|$|E
6000|$|... "I cast {{upon this}} man {{a look of}} scorn, but made no reply. Going to the drawer in which the {{surgical}} instruments were kept, I took out those that suited my purpose, {{and went to work}} with a degree of coolness which astonished myself. I had often seen my father sew up wounds, and had assisted at many an operation of the kind, so that, although altogether unpractised, I was not ignorant of the proper mode of procedure. The people looked on with breathless interest. When I had completed the operation, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> looking over the shoulders of the people with an expression of unutterable surprise not unmingled with amusement. I blushed deeply, and began some sort of explanation, which, however, he cut short by observing in an off-hand manner, that the thing had been done very well, and the child had better be carried into my bedroom and left there to rest for some time. He thus got the people out of the surgery, and then, when we were alone, told me that I was a born surgeon, that he could not have done it much better himself, and, in short, praised me {{to such an extent that}} I felt quite proud of my performance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'So, my dear Cousin, {{see what}} blessings I have, how small our trials are. They may yet come, {{but it is}} now just twelve years, exactly twelve years on Monday, since <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>my</b> <b>Father's</b> and Sisters' faces, and how little have those years been marked with sorrows. My lot is cast in a good land indeed. I read and hear of others, such as that noble Central African band, and I wonder how men can go through it all. It comes to me as from a distance, not as to one who has {{experienced}} such things. We know nothing of war, or famine, or deadly fever; and we seem now to have a settled plan of work, {{one of the greatest}} comforts of all; but while I write thus brightly I don't forget that a little thing (humanly speaking) may cause great reverses, delays, and failures.|$|R
5000|$|In his {{lifetime}} his regiment, the Argylls, recognized his importance. One of his commanding officers called him “as fine {{a type of}} officer as {{can be found in}} the Canadian Militia today”; another referred to him as “one of the most important officers that this unit possesses.”Major Archie Cairns recalled that the “only time <b>I</b> ever <b>saw</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> weep, was when he first learned that his friend and mentor Charlie Dunbar was dead.” ...|$|R
60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Umslopogaas, <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> <b>my</b> bowels melted within me, and I {{longed to}} run to him and throw myself upon his neck. Yet I took council with myself and did not--nay, I dropped {{the corner of the}} kaross I wore over my eyes, hiding my face lest he should know me. Presently he stood before me, searching me out with his keen eyes, for I drew forward to greet him.|$|R
60|$|I {{was still}} running, mad {{with fear and}} anger, when <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> coming to meet me from the landing-place; and with a cry that I thought would have killed me, leaped {{into his arms and}} broke into a passion of sobs and tears upon his bosom. He made me sit down below a tall {{palmetto}} that grew not far off; comforted me, but with some abstraction in his voice; and as soon as I regained the least command upon my feelings, asked me, not without harshness, what this grief betokened. I was surprised by his tone into a still greater measure of composure; and in firm tones, though still interrupted by sobs, I told him there was a stranger in the island, at which I thought he started and turned pale; that the servants would not obey me; that the stranger’s name was Madam Mendizabal, and, at that, he seemed to me both troubled and relieved; that she had insulted me, treated me as a slave (and here my father’s brow began to darken), threatened to buy me at a sale, and questioned my own servants before my face; and that, at last, finding myself quite helpless and exposed to these intolerable liberties, I had fled from the house in terror, indignation, and amazement.|$|E
6000|$|I {{remember}} going {{to one of}} these big fires when I was about twelve years old. It broke out a few miles from home and was travelling in our direction; <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> mount and dash off, but it took me half an hour or more to catch a horse for myself, so that I arrived late on the scene. A fresh fire had broken out {{a quarter of a mile}} in advance of the main one, where most of the men were fighting the flames; and to this spot I went first, and found some half a dozen neighbours who had just arrived on the scene. Before we started operations about twenty men from the main fire came galloping up to us. They had made their path, but seeing this new fire so far ahead, had left it in despair after an hour's hard hot work, and had flown to the new danger spot. As they came up I looked in wonder at one who rode ahead, a tall black man in his shirt sleeves who was a stranger to me. [...] "Who is this black fellow, I wonder?" [...] said I to myself, and just then he shouted to me in English, [...] "Hullo, my boy, what are you doing here?" [...] It was my father; an hour's fighting with the flames in a cloud of black ashes in that burning sun and wind had made him look like a pure-blooded negro! ...|$|E
60|$|There was a mill, {{just where}} the stream {{that runs through}} our valley tumbles down to a level below that on which the farm lies, and empties itself into a small {{tributary}} of the Hudson. This mill was on our property, and {{was a source of}} great convenience and of some profit to my father. There he ground all the grain that was consumed for domestic purposes, for several miles around; and the tolls enabled him to fatten his porkers and beeves, in a way to give both a sort of established character. In a word, the mill was the concentrating point for all the products of the farm, there being a little landing on the margin of the creek that put up from the Hudson, whence a sloop sailed weekly for town. My father passed half his time about the mill and landing, superintending his workmen, and particularly giving directions about the fitting of the sloop, which was his property also, and about the gear of the mill. He was clever, certainly, and had made several useful suggestions to the millwright who occasionally came to examine and repair the works; but he was by no means so accurate a mechanic as he fancied himself to be. He had invented some new mode of arresting the movement, and of setting the machinery in motion when necessary; what it was, I never knew, for it was not named at Clawbonny after the fatal accident occurred. One day, however, in order to convince the millwright of the excellence of this improvement, my father caused the machinery to be stopped, and then placed his own weight upon the large wheel, in order to manifest the sense he felt in the security of his invention. He was in the very act of laughing exultingly at {{the manner in which the}} millwright shook his head at the risk he ran, when the arresting power lost its control of the machinery, the heavy head of water burst into the buckets, and the wheel whirled round carrying my unfortunate father with it. I was an eye-witness of the whole, and saw the face of my parent, as the wheel turned it from me, still expanded in mirth. There was but one revolution made, when the wright succeeded in stopping the works. This brought the great wheel back nearly to its original position, and I fairly shouted with hysterical delight when <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> standing in his tracks, as it might be, seemingly unhurt. Unhurt he would have been, though he must have passed a fearful keel-hauling, but for one circumstance. He had held on to the wheel with the tenacity of a seaman, since letting go his hold would have thrown him down a cliff of near a hundred feet in depth, and he actually passed between the wheel and the planking beneath it unharmed, although there was only an inch or two to spare; but in rising from this fearful strait, his head had been driven between a projecting beam and one of the buckets, in a way to crush one temple in upon the brain. So swift and sudden had been the whole thing, that, on turning the wheel, his lifeless body was still inclining on its periphery, retained erect, I believe, in consequence of some part of his coat getting attached, to the head of a nail. This was the first serious sorrow of my life. I had always regarded my father as one of the fixtures of the world; as a part of the great system of the universe; and had never contemplated his death as a possible thing. That another revolution might occur, and carry the country back under the dominion of the British crown, would have seemed to me far more possible than that my father could die. Bitter truth now convinced me of the fallacy of such notions.|$|E
2500|$|Stewart {{grew up in}} a poor {{household}} {{with domestic}} violence from his father, an experience which later influenced his political and ideological beliefs. He spent much of his childhood in Jarrow. [...] Stewart's father served with the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry and was regimental sergeant major of the 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment during the Second World War, having previously worked as a general labourer and as a postman. As a result of his wartime experience during the Dunkirk evacuation, his father suffered from what was then known as combat fatigue (related to what is now known as post-traumatic stress disorder). In a 2008 interview, Stewart said, [...] "My father was a very potent individual, a very powerful man, who got what he wanted. It was said that when he strode onto the parade ground, birds stopped singing. It was many, many years before I realised how <b>my</b> <b>father</b> inserted himself into my work. I've grown a moustache for Macbeth. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> didn't have one, but when I looked in the mirror just before I went on stage <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> face staring straight back at me." ...|$|R
