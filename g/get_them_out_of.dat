25|$|Three {{years later}} the capital was {{restructured}} and the company {{was taken out of}} Judicial Management. PUTCO pioneers began giving aptitude tests to potential drivers. A year later it also introduced advertising on the sides of its buses. On 7 January 1957 workers from Johannesburg and Pretoria townships began a boycott of PUTCO, due to the company increasing fares by 25% (one penny at that time) in order to <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a continuous financial crisis. This spontaneous act marked the start of a three-month period during which an estimated 70,000 workers joined in the action, which became known as the 1957 Alexandra Bus Boycott. PUTCO was forced to rescind the increase in the bus fare.|$|E
25|$|The link-and-pin coupler {{consisted}} of a tube-like body that received an oblong link. During coupling, a rail worker had to stand between the cars as they came together and guide the link into the coupler pocket. Once the cars were joined, the employee inserted a pin into a hole {{a few inches from}} the end of the tube to hold the link in place. This procedure was exceptionally dangerous and many brakemen lost fingers or entire hands when they did not <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the way of the coupler pockets in time. Many more were killed as a result of being crushed between cars or dragged under cars that were coupled too quickly. Brakemen were issued with heavy clubs that could be used to hold the link in position, but many brakemen would not use the club, and risked injury.|$|E

25|$|On June 10, {{the insurgents}} {{occupied}} buildings in northern Anahuac. Bradburn {{worried that the}} armed men wanted {{to do more than}} free the American prisoners; he suspected a full-scale revolt. Bradburn had Travis and Jack tied to the ground with weapons pointed at them. Bradburn threatened to shoot both men if the Texians attacked. Travis encouraged Johnson to lead an attack anyway. During the ensuing negotiations, the Texians offered to exchange the cavalry officers for Travis and the other prisoners. Mexican officers agreed to release their prisoners into civilian custody in exchange for the cavalry officers and for the withdrawal of the Texians to Turtle Bayou. Although most of the rebels left Anahuac, between 15 and 30 of them remained scattered through the town. Bradburn believed this violated their agreement and warned that he would begin firing on the village within two hours. Most of the Texians believed that Bradburn had lied to them just to <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the buildings they had occupied. Unbeknownst to the Texians at the time, the buildings contained extra ammunition and supplies.|$|E
25|$|Operation Barbarossa {{was planned}} as a blitzkrieg {{intended}} {{to last a}} few weeks. By the autumn of 1941 {{it was clear that}} this the operation would not accomplish its goals, and leading Finnish military officers started to doubt Germany's capability to finish the war quickly. German troops in northern Finland faced circumstances they were not properly prepared for, and failed to reach their targets, most importantly Murmansk. As the lines stabilized, Finland sent out peace feelers to the Soviet Union several times. Germany was alarmed by this, and reacted by drawing down shipments of desperately needed materials each time. The idea that Finland had to continue the war while putting its own forces in the least possible danger gained increasing support, perhaps {{in the hope that the}} Wehrmacht and the Red Army would wear each other down enough for negotiations to begin, or to at least <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the way of Finland's independent decisions. Nationalist elements, including the IKL, may also have continued to hope for an eventual victory by Germany.|$|E

Every time you get a big storyline and lots of scripts, it's fantastic– there's lots to sink your teeth into. Myself, Jamie and Tony Discipline sat down and spoke about the scenes beforehand, discussing {{how we were going}} to perform them. It's like taking on a new project, so every time I get a new storyline, I'm hands-on and ready to go for it." [...] On the scenes involving Anthony, Tyler and Derek, Lapinskas said, [...] "I think it was definitely a shock for them to see his true colours! Anthony was really worried as he didn't want them to get into trouble, so as we saw, he was trying his best to <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it. But even though they were scared of Derek, Anthony and Tyler are brothers and they've got each other's backs, so it was nice that we saw them standing up to Derek in some of the scenes." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, the {{decision}} to extend an amnesty to the mutineer sailors engendered much criticism from Brazil's upper classes. As historian Zachary Morgan put it, [...] "for the elite, {{the intention of the}} naval renovation itself was to fix their institution, propelling Brazil to the front of a South American arms race, and to make their navy competitive with that of any Western nation. Instead, enlisted men had used those very ships to humiliate the naval elite. The ships were saved, but at what cost?" [...] These sailors were given shore leave on the day the revolt ended (26 November). In the next days, the ships were disarmed to prevent a recurrence of events, and the rebels were discharged from the navy as threats to the service's discipline—nearly 1,300 of them, a drop so drastic that the Brazilian Navy was forced to pay for Portuguese merchant crewmen to fill the gaps. The government later claimed that over 1,000 of the dismissed sailors were given tickets to their home states to <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the capital.|$|E

[...] Scott Harrah from Stagezine awarded the album four-and-a-half stars out of five, but did not review the box set; instead, he reviewed each album individually because [...] "all [...] are so different in both sound and concept." [...] Jon O'Brien from AllMusic awarded the album three-and-a-half stars, labelling her earlier work as [...] "infectious". Despite being critical towards the lack of inclusion of her 1994–1998 Deconstruction work, and the inclusion of her albums, X, and Aphrodite, he concluded [...] "Kylie {{has yet to make}} that one essential album, and the going-through-the-motions nature of her later releases suggests her time may have passed, but this box set still contains plenty of moments to justify her position as one of the all-time premier pop princesses." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike the band's three {{previous}} albums, {{most of the}} songs on Spiritual Machines were written solely by Maida. “I think that because this record happened quickly, we just ended up using {{a lot more of}} my songs this time,” stated Maida. “Whatever happens, happens, and if there are good ideas lying around, we use them.” Also unlike on their previous albums, this one was recorded sporadically piece by piece with songs being added as others were discarded. Raine had made several vocal demos at his new home recording studio before the Spiritual Machines idea had come into play. Many of these demos were used for the final recordings and Raine was given production credits. “It was more a means to an end." [...] he explained, [...] "I would start off with a 4-track, then move to an 8-track, then go to digital. I have a ProTools system set up in my basement, so I just try to finish songs and <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the way so I don’t build up this backlog of ideas. We just sift through that stuff, as well as the stuff we do in rehearsal and just pick the best ideas and go. It wasn't like I said I wanted to be a producer or anything, it’s just that the demos I was making came closer to the finished product on one or two occasions, so now, I’m a producer.” ...|$|E
