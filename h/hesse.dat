5|$|Alice {{was born}} in the Tapestry Room at Windsor Castle in Berkshire in the {{presence}} of her great-grandmother, Queen Victoria. She was the eldest child of Prince Louis of Battenberg and his wife Princess Victoria of <b>Hesse</b> and by Rhine. Her mother was the eldest daughter of Princess Alice, Grand Duchess of <b>Hesse,</b> the second daughter of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. Her father was the eldest son of Prince Alexander of <b>Hesse</b> and by Rhine through his morganatic marriage to Julia von Hauke, Princess of Battenberg. Her three younger siblings, Louise, George, and Louis, later became Queen of Sweden, 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven, and Earl Mountbatten of Burma, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In September 1883, Queen Victoria {{appointed}} {{him to her}} yacht, HMY Victoria and Albert. On 30 April 1884 at Darmstadt {{in the presence of}} the Queen, Prince Louis married her granddaughter, Princess Victoria of <b>Hesse</b> and by Rhine. His wife was the eldest daughter of Queen Victoria's second daughter Princess Alice by Louis IV, Grand Duke of <b>Hesse.</b> Through the <b>Hesse</b> family, Prince and Princess Louis of Battenberg were first cousins once removed. They had known each other since childhood, and invariably spoke English to each other. As wedding presents Louis received the British Order of the Bath and the Star and Chain of the Hessian Order of Louis.|$|E
50|$|In the 1950s, <b>Hesse's</b> {{popularity}} {{began to}} wane, while literature critics and intellectuals {{turned their attention}} to other subjects. In 1955, the sales of <b>Hesse's</b> books by his publisher Suhrkamp reached an all-time low. However, after <b>Hesse's</b> death in 1962, posthumously published writings, including letters and previously unknown pieces of prose, contributed to a new level of understanding and appreciation of his works.|$|R
40|$|The dynamic between viewer and art {{object is}} central to Eva <b>Hesse’s</b> oeuvre. In writing about <b>Hesse’s</b> {{sculpture}} through the viewer’s experience of the work, I demonstrate the experiential and embodied nature of viewership. Through Hélène Cixous’ definition of écriture féminine and a performative understanding of art viewership, I argue that <b>Hesse’s</b> sculpture puts the viewer’s physical presence {{at the forefront of}} the experience and meaning of the work. The viewer’s body thus infringes on the independent objecthood of the artwork. Furthermore, as phenomenology and Minimalist art theory help elucidate, <b>Hesse’s</b> work wavers between art object and mere thing, further destabilizing the state of objecthood in her art. Hence, the physical and conceptual experience of the viewer must be considered as part of the sculpture itself. If we acknowledge that the art of <b>Hesse’s</b> work is located not in the physical work but in the relationship between art and viewer, then <b>Hesse’s</b> sculpture is never closed or finished...|$|R

5|$|Princess Victoria of <b>Hesse</b> and by Rhine, later Victoria Mountbatten, Marchioness of Milford Haven (Victoria Alberta Elisabeth Mathilde Marie; 5 April 1863 – 24 September 1950) was {{the eldest}} {{daughter}} of Louis IV, Grand Duke of <b>Hesse</b> and by Rhine (1837–1892), {{and his first}} wife Princess Alice of the United Kingdom (1843–1878), daughter of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after her}} sister Marie {{was married to}} Crown Prince Ferdinand of Romania, a search was made for a {{suitable}} husband for Victoria. Her visit to her grandmother Queen Victoria at Balmoral Castle {{in the autumn of}} 1891 coincided with a visit by her cousin Prince Ernest Louis of <b>Hesse,</b> heir to the grand ducal throne of <b>Hesse.</b> Both were artistic and fun loving, got along well and even shared a birthday. The Queen, observing this, was very keen for her two grandchildren to marry.|$|E

5|$|With both of {{the leading}} {{candidates}} now discounted, Princess Victoria suggested Prince Louis of <b>Hesse,</b> a minor German royal, the nephew of the Grand Duke of <b>Hesse.</b> Princess Victoria {{had gone to the}} court of <b>Hesse</b> to inspect Louis's sister, Princess Anna, as a potential bride for her brother, the Prince of Wales. Although not favorably impressed with Princess Anna, she was impressed with Louis and his brother Prince Henry. Both were invited to Windsor Castle in 1860, ostensibly so they could watch the Ascot Races in the company of the royal family, but in reality, the visit was a chance for the Queen to inspect her potential son-in-law. The Queen admired both Louis and Henry, but noted how well Louis and Alice got along together. When the Hessian family departed, Louis requested Alice's photograph, and Alice made it clear that she was attracted to him.|$|E

5|$|Louis {{was born}} as Ludwig Alexander von Battenberg in Graz, Styria, {{the eldest son}} of Prince Alexander of <b>Hesse</b> and by Rhine by his morganatic {{marriage}} to Countess Julia von Hauke. Because of his morganatic parentage, Louis was denied his father's rank in the Grand Duchy of Hesse; and, from birth, his style of Illustrious Highness and title of Count of Battenberg instead derived from the rank given to his mother {{at the time of}} her marriage. On 26 December 1858, he automatically became His Serene Highness Prince Louis of Battenberg when his mother was elevated to Princess of Battenberg with the style of Serene Highness, by decree of her husband's brother, Louis III, Grand Duke of <b>Hesse.</b>|$|E

5|$|Beatrice fell in {{love with}} Prince Henry of Battenberg, the son of Prince Alexander of <b>Hesse</b> and by Rhine and Julia von Hauke and {{brother-in-law}} of her niece Princess Victoria of <b>Hesse</b> and by Rhine. After a year of persuasion, Queen Victoria, whose consent was required pursuant to the Royal Marriages Act, finally agreed to the marriage, which took place at Whippingham on the Isle of Wight on 23 July 1885. Queen Victoria consented on condition that Beatrice and Henry make their home with her and that Beatrice continue her duties as the Queen's unofficial secretary. The Prince and Princess had four children, but 10 years into their marriage, on 20 January 1896, Prince Henry died of malaria while fighting in the Anglo-Asante War. Beatrice remained at her mother's side until Queen Victoria died on 22 January 1901. Beatrice devoted the next 30 years to editing Queen Victoria's journals as her designated literary executor and continued to make public appearances. She died at 87, outliving all her siblings, two of her children, and several nieces and nephews including George V and Wilhelm II.|$|E
5|$|Born a British princess, Victoria {{spent her}} early life in England {{and lived in}} Malta for three years, where her father was serving in the Royal Navy. In 1889 {{the family moved to}} Coburg, where Victoria's father became the reigning duke in 1893. In her teens Victoria {{fell in love with her}} {{maternal}} first cousin Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich of Russia, but the disapprobation of marriage between first cousins of his faith, Orthodox Christianity, discouraged their romance. Instead, bowing to family pressure, Victoria married in 1894 a paternal first cousin, Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of <b>Hesse</b> and by Rhine, following the wishes of their shared grandmother, Queen Victoria. Their marriage was a failure. Victoria scandalized the royal families of Europe when she divorced her husband in 1901. The couple's only child, Princess Elisabeth of <b>Hesse</b> and by Rhine, died of typhoid fever in 1903.|$|E

5|$|During the Prussian {{invasion}} of <b>Hesse</b> in June 1866, Victoria and Elisabeth {{were sent to}} England {{to live with their}} grandmother until hostilities were ended by the absorption of Hesse-Kassel and parts of Hesse-Darmstadt into Prussia. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, military hospitals were set up in the palace grounds at Darmstadt, and she helped in the soup kitchens with her mother. She remembered the intense cold of the winter, and being burned on the arm by hot soup. In 1872, Victoria's eighteen-month-old brother, Friedrich, was diagnosed with haemophilia. The diagnosis came as a shock to the royal families of Europe; it had been twenty years since Queen Victoria had given birth to her haemophiliac son, Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, {{and it was the first}} indication that the bleeding disorder in the royal family was hereditary. The following year, Friedrich fell from a window onto stone steps and died. It was the first of many tragedies to beset the <b>Hesse</b> family.|$|E

This provoked war between Austria and Prussia, with <b>Hesse</b> siding with the Austrians, technically making Alice and her sister Victoria enemies.|$|E
