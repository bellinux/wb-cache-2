She did not {{participate}} in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 and made one cruise in the Pacific in the early 1880s. The ship spent 1884-85 in the Mediterranean before beginning a refit in 1886 during which she was partially re-boilered. General-Admiral had her boilers replaced, her funnel was replaced by two non-retractable funnels, and a <b>fixed</b> <b>propeller</b> was installed in 1892. The ship was reclassified as a 1st-class cruiser on 13 February 1892 and participated the Columibian Naval Review in Hampton Roads, Virginia, the following year. Afterwards she became a training ship. She became a school ship in 1906 and her armament was reduced accordingly.|$|E

50|$|At a small size, quadcopters {{are cheaper}} and more durable than {{conventional}} helicopters {{due to their}} mechanical simplicity. Their smaller blades are also advantageous because they possess less kinetic energy, reducing their ability to cause damage. For small-scale quadcopters, this makes the vehicles safer for close interaction. It is also possible to fit quadcopters with guards that enclose the rotors, further reducing the potential for damage. However, as size increases, <b>fixed</b> <b>propeller</b> quadcopters develop disadvantages over conventional helicopters. Increasing blade size increases their momentum. This means that changes in blade speed take longer, which negatively impacts control. At the same time, increasing blade size improves efficiency as it takes less energy to generate thrust by moving a large mass of air at a slow speed than by moving a small mass of air at high speed. Therefore, increasing efficiency comes {{at the cost of}} control. Helicopters do not experience this problem as increasing the size of the rotor disk does not significantly impact the ability to control blade pitch.|$|E
50|$|The ship's {{drivetrain}} is {{the more}} efficient diesel/electric, powered by five Wärtsilä diesel engines. The engines produce low NOx emissions, using low-sulphur fuel. The engines turn alternators producing electricity. Propulsion is by two GE Energy Power Conversion electric motors with each giving 21,850 kW at 138 rpm. Redundancy is provided, with the two fully independent electric motors each turning a <b>fixed</b> <b>propeller</b> on conventional propeller shafts. The two propellers are fully independent ensuring propulsion if one fails. The same approach {{was applied to the}} two fully independent steering systems. Further advantage of using electric motors to turn the propellers is in small sunshine ports. Each propeller is controlled individually, and quickly, for ease of ship manoeuvrability along with the four bow thrusters. The need for tugs while in the many ports of call is greatly reduced. Two of the five engines have 16 cylinders each with an output of 16,800 kW, and the remaining three engines have 12 cylinders each producing 12,600 kW. Total power generated is 71,400 kW at 514 rpm.|$|E
5000|$|Whereas most sailing yachts above {{a certain}} size will usually have an inboard engine, {{they will not}} be [...] "motorsailers", as their {{principal}} source of power is sail, and the engine is only for auxiliary drive and maneuvering. A sailing yacht with an auxiliary engine will typically have a small propeller that automatically feathers when sailing, whereas a motorsailer may have either a large <b>fixed</b> <b>propeller</b> or, ideally, a variable-pitch propeller. [...] Compared to such [...] "pure" [...] sailing yachts, a motorsailer will typically be heavier-built, with less delicate lines but with more spacious accommodation. A motorsailer will have an enclosed cockpit, or [...] "doghouse", whereas a pure sailing yacht would have an open cockpit. A motorsailer may have a higher freeboard, and, coupled with the doghouse and other superstructure, will have considerable side windage. The motorsailer's sail area will typically be rather smaller than an equivalent yacht's, and any masts may be shorter. Also, while a sailing yacht will often be rigged as a Bermuda sloop or a Bermuda cutter (both types having a single mast), the motorsailer will more likely have a multi-masted split-rig, such as a schooner, ketch or yawl.|$|E

40|$|A counter-propeller is a <b>fixed</b> <b>propeller</b> {{smaller than}} the main propeller, mounted either fore or aft of the latter and {{performing}} the function of changing the direction of motion of the fluid filaments, which naturally tend to adopt a helicoidal form.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of a propeller is {{directly affected by}} {{the shape of the}} propeller blades, that are deformed due to the loads during flight operation. Therefore the measurement of the real shape of the blades is of great interest. A powerful optical measuring method called Image Pattern Correlation Technique (IPCT) enables the flight test engineers to perform such measurements in a non-intrusiveway. It has already been applied to in-flight investigations of aircraft wing and propeller deformations, but only for one <b>fixed</b> <b>propeller</b> phase angle. To extend the optical access to 360 ◦ a new rotating 3 -D image acquisition system placed in front of the examined propeller has been designed. The measurement technique IPCT as well as the development of the rotating camera system are described in this chapter...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The {{ability of}} birds to perch robustly and {{effectively}} {{is a powerful}} demonstration of the capabilities of nature’s control systems. Their apparent robustness to gust disturbances is particularly remarkable because when the airspeed approaches zero just before acquiring a perch, the influence of aerodynamic forces, and therefore potentially the control authority, is severely compromised. In this paper we present a simplified closed-form model for a fixed-wing aircraft which closely agrees with experimental indoor perching data. We then carefully examine the LTV controllability along an optimized perching trajectory for three different actuation scenarios- a glider (no powerplant), a <b>fixed</b> <b>propeller,</b> and a propeller with thrust vectoring. The results reveal that while all three vehicles are LTV controllable along the trajectory, the additional actuators allow the perch to be more easily acquired with less control surface deflections. However, in all three cases, disturbances experienced just before reaching the perch cannot be effectively rejected. I...|$|E
