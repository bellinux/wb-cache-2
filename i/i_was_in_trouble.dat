I had intuited that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> and I had to leave — which was very difficult. It was hard to leave that whole scene, it was hard to leave rock ’n’ roll in that way, it was hard to leave the band that we had worked so hard to establish, it was hard to leave my sister. But I was falling apart." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then {{they run}} {{to me again}} to weep with remorse over their virgin peccadilloes. I never cuddled my Colonel when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble.</b> Lambs--positive lambs!' ...|$|E
60|$|FANNY [with an odd smile]. It went {{to pieces}} at the first. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> all last night; {{you must have}} known it. You left me alone.|$|E
60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> eating <b>is</b> {{the only}} thing that {{consoles}} me. Indeed, when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> really great <b>trouble,</b> as anyone who knows me intimately will tell you, I refuse everything except food and drink.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you not understand, Amuba? <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> because <b>I</b> {{struck the}} crocodile; {{it is an}} impious action, and yet what could I do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; {{they will}} not leave me as long as <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble.</b> <b>I</b> don't know what I should do without them, {{especially}} now this new blow has fallen upon me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, it isn't that. I meant before--all {{that time}} {{before you came}} across me and guessed at once that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble,</b> {{with no one to}} turn to. And you know it was desperate trouble too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, lad, well," [...] said Bartle, in {{a gentle}} tone, strangely in {{contrast}} with his usual peremptoriness and impatience of contradiction, [...] "it's likely enough I talk foolishness. I'm an old fellow, and it's a good many years since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> myself. It's easy finding reasons why other folks should be patient." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble,</b> for {{how would}} Marget live? Ursula {{could not find}} a coin in the road every day--perhaps not even a second one. And I was ashamed, too, for not having been near Marget, and she so in need of friends; but that was my parents' fault, not mine, and I couldn't help it.|$|E
6000|$|Algernon. When <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble,</b> eating <b>is</b> {{the only}} thing that {{consoles}} me. Indeed, when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> really great <b>trouble,</b> as any one who knows me intimately will tell you, I refuse everything except food and drink. At the present moment <b>I</b> <b>am</b> eating muffins because <b>I</b> <b>am</b> unhappy. Besides, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> particularly fond of muffins. [Rising.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon, Jude, for {{disturbing}} you," [...] said Arabella humbly. [...] "But I called earlier--I wanted particularly {{to see you}} to-night, if <b>I</b> could. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble,</b> and have nobody to help me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} don't mind my coming to you, Mr. Jarvis," [...] she said. [...] "You know {{you told me}} to if ever <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble,</b> so I've taken you at your word. You don't mind?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'There is one thing, Margaret. The {{fact that}} you have somehow felt when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> should cheer you, when I am away, for if mere danger should so affect you, surely you will know should death befall me; and {{as long as you do}} not feel that, you may be sure that I shall return safe and sound to you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, dear master; say not so. But, indeed, it {{is truth}} that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> {{at the moment}} of your welcome entrance, and this trouble was, as the Fates have willed it, brought forth by that very statue in which you have been graciously pleased to show your interest. There it stands, and you can see for {{yourself}} how rudely it has been mishandled." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir Percy," [...] {{she said}} impulsively, [...] "Heaven knows {{you have been}} at pains to make the task, which I had set to myself, {{difficult}} to accomplish. You spoke of my mood just now; well! we will call it that, if you will. I wished {{to speak to you}} [...] . because [...] . because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> [...] . and had need [...] . of your sympathy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thank you, Sir, {{from the}} bottom of my heart, for the words of {{friendship}} which you have spoken. I shall never forget them, never! and if at any time <b>in</b> my life <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> [...] . . ." ...|$|R
5|$|C: Well, if {{by chance}} {{one of a}} million of the people believe you that they {{committed}} suicide in church and I see {{that they have not}} committed suicide and I know differently, then if it ever leaks out, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'What do you mean, Louis?' she asked, {{flushing}} up warm, {{and drawing}} back from him. 'It {{was a form}} of prayer I use, particularly when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble.</b> It <b>was</b> recommended to me by the Bishop, and Mr. Torkingham commends it very highly.' ...|$|R
60|$|As {{soon as he}} had {{got over}} the first {{surprise}} of seeing me, he noticed that I looked pale and care-worn. I confessed at once that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble.</b> We sat down together by the bright fireside in his little library (Benjamin, {{as far as his}} means would allow, was a great collector of books), and there I told my old friend, frankly and truly, all that I have told here.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir, {{you are a}} {{stranger}} to me, but you have done me a kindness this day which I can never forget. If whole years of gratitude can be to you any slight compensation, they shall be yours. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> and you have relieved me nobly {{and at a time}} when all seemed dark and drear. Count me your friend from this time forth, for I am not a man to forget a favor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{started from}} 'Frisco {{that night on}} the boat ready to fling myself into anything--or the river!" [...] she went on hurriedly. [...] "There {{was a man in}} the cabin who noticed me, and began to hang around. I thought he knew who I was,--had seen me on the posters; and as I didn't feel like foolin', I told him so. But he wasn't that kind. He said he saw <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> and wanted me to tell him all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, do {{you think}} so?" [...] cried Anne. [...] "I shall call on her to-morrow, with mother. Do you know, Mr. Brice," [...] she continued, [...] "do {{you know that your}} mother is just the person I should go to if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble,</b> whether <b>I</b> knew her or not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|MARY. Nothing! O nothing! <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble,</b> and <b>I</b> {{know not}} what I say. And I cannot help you; I cannot help you if <b>I</b> would. He <b>is</b> not here; and I believe he was; and ill ... ill; {{and he is}} not--he <b>is</b> ... O, <b>I</b> think I shall lose my mind! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I make {{no secret}} of it. I do not talk about my private affairs. I do not send a {{town-crier}} to Charing Cross to tell the passers-by that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble.</b> But <b>I</b> care not whether men know or not that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> unfitted for joining in such festivities. My presence is not wanted for their marriage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In trouble, I {{should think}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble.</b> There's been an {{execution}} in the house, that is, there's been three executions, one for rates and taxes, {{one for a}} butcher's bill, and one for rent. They all came together, and fought like wild cats for the things. That was yesterday, and you see all they have left me; cleaned out everything down to my new yellow satin, and then asked for more. They {{wanted to know where}} my jewellery was, but I did them, hee, hee!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aye, aye, he's good metal; {{he gives}} the right ring when you try him, our parson does. A man o' sense--says no more than's needful. He's {{not one of those}} that think they can comfort you with chattering, as if folks who stand by and look on knew a deal better what the trouble was than those who have to bear it. I've had to do with such folks in my time--in the south, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> myself. Mr. Irwine is to be a witness himself, by and by, on her side, you know, to speak to her {{character}} and bringing up." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{stared at}} me in silent astonishment for a few moments, then took the {{portrait}} into his hand; and while he gazed admiringly at it I pondered over what I had heard. I could not now think of leaving this poor woman, who had offered herself with all her inheritance to me, without some attempt to rescue her from her sad position. She {{had given me a}} refuge when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> and danger, and the appeal she had just made to me, accompanied by so convincing a proof of her trust and affection, would have gone {{to the heart of the}} most cold-blooded man in existence, to make him, in spite of his nature, her devoted champion.|$|E
60|$|Although <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> at this time, Verily, <b>I</b> shall <b>be</b> doubly repaid; When {{the call}} {{comes to me}} from my Saviour, I shall receive mercy and new grace; I fear no more vexation, When <b>I</b> ascend to <b>be</b> with Thy saints; O Thou that sittest on the throne, Assist my {{speaking}} and accept my prayer.|$|R
60|$|EVA. Not now--presently. Yes, <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble,</b> but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> happy--I think, {{quite happy}} now.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not while <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble,</b> Tom?' said Mr. St. Clare, looking sadly {{out of the}} window. 'And {{when will}} my trouble be over?' Then half-smiling he turned from the window, and laid his hand on Tom's shoulder. 'Ah, Tom, you soft, silly boy,' he said. 'I won't keep you. Go home to your wife and children, and give them all my love.' ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{as soon as}} one is at rest, in this world, off he goes on {{something}} else to worry about. It occurred to me that I had made another blunder: I had sent the boy off to alarm his betters with a threat--I intending to invent a calamity at my leisure; now the people who are the readiest and eagerest and willingest to swallow miracles are the very ones who are hungriest to see you perform them; suppose I should be called on for a sample? Suppose I should be asked to name my calamity? Yes, I had made a blunder; I ought to have invented my calamity first. [...] "What shall I do? what can I say, to gain a little time?" [...] <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> again; in the deepest kind of trouble...|$|E
6000|$|LADY CHILTERN. It {{was your}} own wife. Robert, {{yesterday}} afternoon Lord Goring {{told me that}} if ever <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> I could come to him for help, as he was our oldest and best friend. Later on, after that terrible scene in this room, I wrote to him telling him that I trusted him, that I had need of him, that I was coming to him for help and advice. [SIR ROBERT CHILTERN takes the letter out of his pocket.] Yes, that letter. I didn’t go to Lord Goring’s, after all. I felt that it is from ourselves alone that help can come. Pride made me think that. Mrs. Cheveley went. She stole my letter and sent it anonymously to you this morning, that you should think [...] . Oh! Robert, I cannot tell you what she wished you to think. [...] .|$|E
60|$|While I {{was feeling}} badly at leaving Miss Pondar your letter came, dear madam, and I must say it gave heavy hearts to Jone and me, to me especially, {{as you can}} well understand. I went off into the summer-house, and as I sat there {{thinking}} and reading the letter over again, I do believe some tears came into my eyes; and Miss Pondar, who {{was working in the}} garden only a little way off--for if there is anything she likes to do it is to weed and fuss among the rose-bushes and other flowers, which she does whenever her other work gives her a chance--she happened to look up, and seeing that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble,</b> she came right to me, like the good woman she is, and asked me if I had heard bad news, and if I would like a little gin and water.|$|E
60|$|But Maude was {{not there}} for small talk. 'Dear dad,' said she, 'I want you to stand by me, for <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble.</b> Now, my dear good dad, please see things {{from my point of}} view, and don't make objections, and do exactly what I ask you.' She threw her arms round his neck and gave him a hearty squeeze.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Harry!" [...] {{cried the}} lad, with {{a ripple of}} laughter. [...] "Harry spends his days <b>in</b> saying what <b>is</b> incredible, and his evenings <b>in</b> doing what <b>is</b> improbable. Just the sort of life I would like to lead. But still I don't think I would go to Harry if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble.</b> <b>I</b> would sooner go to you, Basil." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, excuse me," [...] {{replied the}} Danish consul in haste, glancing round. [...] "I <b>am</b> followed, persecuted <b>I</b> may say. I had {{intended}} to call for your husband to-day to beg him to use his influence with the Dey in my behalf, but I cannot--circumstances--in short, will you kindly mention to him that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> because of the non-payment of the tribute due by our Government, and--" ...|$|R
