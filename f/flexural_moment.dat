The {{results showed that}} the distinct characteristics of biaxial hysteretic loops are rounded at corners and negative stiffness values. In addition, scatter plots of pseudo-dynamic results reveal that there is no bias in the orientations of the resultant <b>flexural</b> <b>moments.</b> Therefore, it seems appropriate to make a seismic design based on biaxial bending without bias in any specific direction. The complicated biaxial hysteretic loops confirm the difficulty of developing suitable load-displacement models for non-linear dynamic analysis. These pseudo-dynamic outputs, such as displacement and hysteretic responses, can be treated as references for analytical models proposed to simulate the load-displacement relationship. After comparing biaxial with uniaxial hysteretic loops for both cyclic loading and pseudo-dynamic tests, {{it is important to note}} that biaxial hysteretic loops show greater stiffness degradation and pinching during unloading. This reveals that damage caused in one direction weakens the seismic resistance in the other direction.|$|R

Because of random nature of the wave behavior, application of physical models {{for the study of}} wave-structure interaction can be quite efficient. In the present research, physical models of thin flexible walls were constructed and tested in a wave flume subject to generated random waves. The water surface variations and the strains {{at the base of the}} wall were recorded using sensors; and the relationship between the strain and the wave height was obtained using the zero up-crossing method. The results indicate that the strain-wave height relationship is linear.

In this study, a prefabricated permanent thin-walled steel form integrated with reinforcement cage (PPSFRC) was developed, {{and it makes}} for a fast-built construction by reducing the temporary form works. Axial compression tests were conducted on a total of 9 test specimens to investigate the structural performances of the newly developed columns. The proposed column construction method utilized relatively thinner steel plates compared to conventional concrete-filled tube (CFT) columns, but it was designed to have sufficient resistance performances against the lateral pressure of fresh concrete and to prevent the buckling of the thin plates by utilizing the steel angles and channel stiffeners prefabricated in the permanent thin-walled steel form. The experimental results showed that the column specimens fabricated by the PPSFRC method had better local buckling resistance and behaved in a more ductile manner compared to the conventional CFT columns.

Among the common strengthening methods, an efficient way to transform a simply supported into a continuous system is widely used in simply supported bridges with small or medium span. After the transformation of the system, the internal forces in the bridge are redistributed.

The beams had dimensions of 150  mm ×  300  mm ×  2000  mm with spans of 1800  mm. The diameter of the tensioned longitudinal rebar was 14  mm, and the average compressive strength and modulus of elasticity of the concrete were 32.5  MPa and 35.6 GPa, respectively.

According to the best knowledge of authors, there is no study investigating this important issue in the literature. Therefore, the present study focuses on retrofitting of beam support regions under reversed cyclic <b>flexural</b> <b>moments.</b> As the initial stage of a more comprehensive testing program, three full-scale RC beam-column-slab sub-assemblages were tested.

CFRP-plate structural systems were applied to multiple bridges on the M 2, and two bridges on the M 1, to increase bridge load capacity for heavy military vehicle traffic. This FRP application significantly increased the <b>flexural</b> bending <b>moment</b> of bridge structural members. A total of 14, 600  m of CFRP plates were applied to the 19 bridges having a bonded area of 1318 square meters (Crawford and Nikolovski 2007). Consequently, the condition of CFRP laminate–concrete bond becomes a critical element in sustaining long-term bridge load performance. After 15  years {{the condition of the}} CFRP–concrete bond on the 19 bridges is an open question: are the CFRP plates still 100  % bonded to the bridge structural members? Is the current bridge load performance sustaining the original designed CFRP-strengthened <b>flexural</b> bending <b>moment?</b> The challenge is having an effective field testing process to evaluate the CFRP-plate bond condition to determine if any changes in bridge performance have occurred. Since 2006 an additional 82 bridges in Macedonia have been strengthened and refurbished with FRP systems in varying applications. 46 bridges in the Ukraine, nine bridges in Montenegro, and six bridges in Kosovo have also been refurbished and strengthened. The most recent contract in Macedonia was awarded in December 2013, to repair and strengthen 16 bridges on the M 1 (European Corridor 10) between Skopje and 50  km south to Veles. To sustain the designed load performance on this large number of CFRP-strengthened bridges, a reliable field testing procedure in bridge inspection and maintenance is needed to periodically verify bond condition and associated bridge load performance.|$|R

The computational modelling procedures proposed in the thesis include the modelling of frost heave generation, the constitutive modelling of the frozen soil, the structural behaviour of the pipeline and the constitutive modelling of the soil-pipeline interface. The interactive thermo-hydro-mechanical processes encountered in the problem are generally time-dependent and non-linear. The frost heave modelling utilizes the three-dimensional form of a modified hydrodynamic frost heave model. A finite element implementation of the model is used to estimate the frost heave in a one-dimensional element. The comparison of the numerical results with an experimental result indicates that the prediction by computational modelling can reasonably simulate observations of one-dimensional experiments. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional simulations also indicate that the numerical modelling can predict trends of frost heave development which {{are consistent with the}} localized cooling {{at the base of a}} cuboidal element. In the development of the interaction effects, the mechanical behaviour of the frozen soil is represented by a complete creep model. The proposed complete creep model can take into consideration all three creep processes associated with frozen soils. Computations have also been conducted to calibrate the predictions of the creep model with observed experimental data. Extensive computations have been performed to investigate the general creep responses of a variety of geotechnical structures. To examine frozen soil-pipeline interaction problems, the pipeline is modelled either as a Bernoulli-Euler beam or as a cylindrical shell which accommodates both flexural and shear stiffness effects.

Three of the specimens were instrumented with strain gauges adhered to the reinforcement and the concrete side face. Three lap splice lengths, two bar sizes for square bars, and one bar size for round bars were investigated. The principal reinforcement was either cast in the bottom or top position. The results of maximum loads, crack patterns, load versus deflection behaviour, and deflected profiles are presented for all specimens. The analysis of specimens with strain gauge instrumentation is also presented, and includes results of strain compatibility, bond stress distribution, and flexural section analysis. All specimens failed by bond, caused by a sudden pullout of the reinforcement within the splice region. An equivalent round diameter based upon the cross-section area of the square bars allowed for a single predictive equation between the maximum normalized load as a function of splice length, casting position and bar size. A top cast factor of 0. 4 and 0. 6 captures the reduction in the maximum normalized load for specimens cast with round and square bars, respectively, in the top position. The CEB-FIP Model Code (1993) predictive equations are reasonably conservative in capturing the behaviour of specimens reinforced with round bars cast in the bottom position, and square bars with side dimension of 25 mm cast in the bottom position. However, the CEB-FIP Model Code (1993) predictive equation is unconservative when predicting the behaviour of specimens reinforced with either square or round bars cast in the top position. On the other hand, the draft CEB-FIP Model Code (2010) provisions showed an overly conservative prediction for all specimens reinforced with either round or square bars cast in the top or bottom position. Instrumented specimens showed that strain compatibility between the longitudinal reinforcement and the surrounding concrete did not exist for much of the loading range due to bond loss.

If the present trend in growing availability of FRP materials and design information were to continue, a sharp increase in FRP application could be forecast...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{the use of}} fibre {{reinforced}} polymers (FRP’s) as a preferred method of retrofitting existing structures has dramatically increased. This has brought about improvements in the mechanical properties of the materials and greater options for engineers and designers. This research has determined the most suitable fibre material to provide a maximum increase in structural performance at the lowest possible cost. Carbon fibre sheet and yarn were used. A unidirectional CFRP sheet and yarn had a cotton sheath attached that was been designed to promote resin impregnation and thus improved bond performance. The test methodology was to statically test concrete beams with surface applied FRP to comparatively examine the flexural strength and toughness. Sixteen beams were manufactured, eight with rebar and eight plain. Carbon fibre sheet and carbon fibre yarn was applied to all beams in equal proportions. The theoretical moment capacity was calculated for the steel reinforced beams using Eurocode 2 and compared against the actual moment capacity derived from the three point loading test. The findings displayed a tendency for higher <b>flexural</b> strength, <b>moment</b> capacity and toughness due to the surface application of FRP composite sheet and yarn. The carbon fibre sheet provided the most suitable form of retrofitted reinforcement. However the loose yarn was 25...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This work {{reports the}} results of an ongoing {{investigation}} {{on the use of the}} Near Surface Mounted (NSM) CFRP laminates for the flexural strengthening of continuous Reinforced Concrete (RC) slabs, in order to verify the possibility of increasing the negative resisting bending moment in 25 %, maintaining moment redistribution levels of about 30 %. To better understand the behavior of these structures, a comprehensive experimental program was proposed with the aim of evaluating the possibilities of NSM technique for statically indeterminate RC slab strips in terms of <b>flexural</b> strengthening effectiveness, <b>moment</b> redistribution and ductility performance. To assess the behavior of the tested slab strips the strains in CFRP laminates, steel reinforcement and concrete surfaces, as well as the applied load and support reactions were registered up to failure of the slabs. The experimental program is described and the obtained results are presented and analyzed in this paper. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Based on {{appropriate}} numerical {{constitutive model}} of lightweight aggregate concrete filled steel tubes (LCFST), layered method was adopted {{to predict the}} complete moment-curvature curves of LCFST composite section subjected to pure bending. A FORTRAN program for the moment-curvature curves was developed. Applying the layered method, the influences of the significant parameters, such as steel ratio, yield strength of steel and strength of lightweight aggregate concrete on the moment-curvature curves of the composite section subjected to pure bending were discussed. The practical composite <b>flexural</b> stiffness, ultimate <b>moment</b> and practical moment-curvature relationship of LCFST composite section were presented. The predicted results of both layered method and practical moment-curvature relationships of LCFST composite section are in good agreement with the test results from reference. Compared with the layered method, practical calculate method could remove the step of composite section layered and improve the calculation speed while achieving similar results...|$|R
