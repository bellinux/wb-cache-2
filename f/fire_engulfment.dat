50|$|The Feyzin {{disaster}} was {{the worst}} accident which had occurred in petroleum and petrochemical plants in Western Europe, prior to the Flixborough disaster in 1974. Since then, many pressurised tanks containing liquefied gases have BLEVE'd. The hazards are now better understood and storage spheres are protected from <b>fire</b> <b>engulfment</b> by better design. However, so many firemen and emergency servicemen have been killed while trying to control large fires that the cautious philosophy is to evacuate and take shelter until the material burns itself out. BLEVE's produce intense thermal radiation from the fireball. This and blast damage from the bursting pressure vessel are relatively localised compared with unconfined vapour cloud explosions. Therefore, evacuation of up to 0.5 km will usually {{ensure the safety of}} people. Burning hydrocarbon storage vessels are very spectacular but unpredictable. Therefore, newsmen and sightseers must be kept well away for their own safety.|$|E
40|$|The {{improvement}} of {{passive fire protection}} of storage vessels is a key factor to enhance safety among the LPG distribution chain. A thermal and mechanical model based on finite elements simulations was developed to assess the behaviour of full size tanks used for LPG storage and transportation in <b>fire</b> <b>engulfment</b> scenarios. The model was validated by experimental results. A specific analysis {{of the performance of}} four different reference coating materials was then carried out, also defining specific key performance indicators (KPIs) to assess design safety margins in near-miss simulations. The results confirmed the wide influence of coating application on the expected vessel time to failure due to <b>fire</b> <b>engulfment.</b> A quite different performance of the alternative coating materials was evidenced. General correlations were developed among the vessel time to failure and the effective coating thickness in full engulfment scenarios, providing a preliminary assessment of the coating thickness required to prevent tank rupture for a given time lapse. The KPIs defined allowed the assessment of the available safety margins in the reference scenarios analyzed and of the robustness of thermal protection design. © 2009 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|International audienceHigh-strength {{concrete}} (HSC) {{will experience}} thermal microcracking, explosive spalling, and undesirable chemical changes {{when exposed to}} high temperatures, such as during <b>ﬁre,</b> <b>engulfment</b> by lava ﬂow, or nuclear meltdown. Knowledge of the resultant changes in mechanical, physical, and chemical properties is paramount for hazard mitigation. We present a multidisciplinary study on the inﬂuence of thermalstressing on HSC. Our study shows that thermal microcracking in HSC initiates at 180 °C, is more prevalent during cooling, and exhibits the Kaiser ''temperature-memory'' effect. We show that residual compressive strength, indirect tensile strength, ultrasonic wave velocities, and Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio decrease, whilst porosity and permeability increase with increasing temperature. We discuss these data {{in terms of the}} chemical changes during thermal-stressing, provided by thermo-gravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and X-ray diffraction, and from optical microscopic analysis of thermally-stressed samples. We provide implications for thermally-damaged HSC structures and a new method for non-destructive monitoring...|$|E
40|$|Two {{large-scale}} diesel pool <b>fire</b> <b>engulfment</b> {{tests were}} carried out on LPG tanks protected with intumescing materials to test the effectiveness of thermal coatings {{in the prevention of}} hot BLEVE accidental scenarios in the road and rail transport of LPG. A specific test protocol was defined to enhance reproducibility of experimental tests. The geometrical characteristics of the test tanks were selected in order to obtain shell stresses similar to those present in full-size road tankers complying to ADR standards. In order to better understand the stress distribution on the vessel and to identify underlying complicating phenomena, a finite element model was also developed to better analyze the experimental data. A non-homogeneous and time-dependent effectiveness of the fire protection given by the intumescing coating was evidenced both by finite element simulations and by the analysis of the coating after the tests. The results of the fire tests pointed out that the coating assured an effective protection of the tanks, consistently increasing the expected time to failure. The data obtained suggest that the introduction of fire protection coatings may be a viable route to improve the safety of the LPG distribution chain. © 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|The {{potential}} {{reduction of}} risk in LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) road transport due {{to the adoption of}} passive fire protections was investigated. Experimental data available for small scale vessels fully engulfed by a fire were extended to real scale road and rail tankers through a finite elements model. The results of mathematical simulations of real scale <b>fire</b> <b>engulfment</b> scenarios that may follow accidents involving LPG tankers proved the effectiveness of the thermal protections in preventing the "fired" BLEVE (Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapour Explosion) scenario. The presence of a thermal coating greatly increases the "time to failure", providing a time lapse that in the European experience may be considered sufficient to allow the start of effective mitigation actions by fire brigades. The results obtained were used to calculate the expected reduction of individual and societal risk due to LPG transportation in real case scenarios. The analysis confirmed that the introduction of passive fire protections turns out in a significant {{reduction of risk}}, up to an order of magnitude in the case of individual risk and of about 50 % if the expectation value is considered. Thus, the adoption of passive fire protections, not compulsory in European regulations, may be an effective technical measure for risk reduction, and may contribute to achieve the control of "major accidents hazards" cited by the European legislation. © 2009 Elsevier B.
