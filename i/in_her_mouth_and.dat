5|$|To {{prove his}} innocence, Deodato had Luca Barbareschi get {{in contact with}} the other three actors, and the four of them were interviewed for an Italian {{television}} show. Deodato also explained in court how the special effect in the impalement scene was achieved: a bicycle seat was attached to the end of an iron pole, upon which the actress sat. She then held a short length of balsa wood <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> looked skyward, thus giving the appearance of impalement. Deodato also provided the court with pictures of the girl interacting with the crew after the scene had been filmed. After they were presented with this evidence, the courts dropped all murder charges against Deodato.|$|E
5|$|Confronting Joyce {{about the}} story, Lois {{questions}} her intentions, with Joyce revealing {{that the two}} attended high school together, where she was known as Joyce Chevapravatdumrong. She also reveals that Lois humiliated {{her in front of}} the entire school, by placing a hotdog <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> pulling down her pants while blindfolded (revealing her pink underwear), and has sought revenge ever since. At church the next day, Lois and her family enter, and are immediately demanded to leave by the preacher. Becoming extremely depressed, Lois is eventually coaxed by Brian to face her mistake by showing it to the church. The porno causes the church to reaccept her and admit the Griffin family back into their congregation due to a positive opinion of the film, much to Joyce's anger. Stewie in the meantime develops suspicions of having been conceived through the creation of the porno, heightened when he sees that one of the actors has a football-shaped head like his.|$|E
25|$|Nightclubbing {{claimed the}} number 1 slot on NMEs Album of the Year list. Slant Magazine listed the album at No. 40 on {{its list of}} Best Albums of the 1980s. Nightclubbing is now widely {{considered}} Jones' best studio album. The album's cover art is a painting of Jones by Jean-Paul Goude. Jones {{is presented as a}} man wearing an Armani suit jacket, with a cigarette <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> a flattop haircut. While promoting the album, Jones slapped chat-show host Russell Harty live on air after he had turned to interview other guests, making Jones feel she was being ignored.|$|E

25|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the Kearney attack, there were half a dozen similar attacks (See table), though none of the purported victims were able to provide a clear description of the prowler, and no clues were found {{at the scene of}} the attacks. The first specimen of physical evidence was found on the night of September 5, when Carl and Beulah Cordes of North 21st Street returned home around 10:00 pm. After spending a few minutes in the house they noticed a piece of white cloth, slightly larger than a man's handkerchief, sitting on their porch next to the screen door. Beulah Cordes picked up the cloth and smelled it. As soon as she inhaled, she became violently ill. She described the effect as being similar to an electric shock. Her face quickly began to swell, she experienced a burning sensation <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> throat, and began to vomit. As with other victims, she also reported feeling weak and experiencing partial paralysis of her legs. Beulah Cordes later hypothesized that the cloth had been left on the porch in order to knock out the family dog, which usually slept there, so that the prowler could gain access to the house unnoticed.|$|E
500|$|Later {{experiments}} were devised {{to test the}} mother-child bond with mothers who had themselves been reared in isolation as infants. This early deprivation {{was found to have}} retarded the mothers' emotional development and her ability to engage in intercourse and in turn become pregnant. In response, Harlow and his colleagues created an apparatus to impregnate these mothers they named a [...] "rape rack". Harlow found that once these monkeys gave birth, they cared little for their offspring writing, [...] "these monkey mothers that had never experienced love of any kind were devoid of love for their infants". While some mothers simply ignored their children, Harlow characterized others as [...] "evil" [...] and abusive and in some instances reported them [...] "crushing the infant's face to the floor, chewing off the infant's feet and fingers, and in one case... putting the infant's head <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> crushing it like an eggshell".|$|E
500|$|Ruffed lemurs are {{the only}} known {{primates}} to build arboreal nests, used exclusively for birth {{and for the first}} week or two of life. Starting three weeks prior to birth, females begin constructing the nest from twigs, branches, leaves, and vines, locating it within her core area and [...] above ground. The nests have only one apparent entry point, and are shallow and dish-shaped. During the first couple of weeks, the mother is mostly solitary and does not travel far from the nest, spending as much as 70–90% of her time with the newborns (in captivity). In order to find food, she will leave the infants alone in the nest or, after the first couple of weeks, will carry them <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> stash them in concealed locations in the canopy while she forages. Since this early developmental period corresponds {{with the end of the}} cold, dry season, which offers the least amount of fruit, energy is conserved for lactation while travel is limited. As the hot, rainy season begins, fruit availability rises, lactation demands rise as well, and females increase their travel distance in search of food.|$|E

500|$|In New Zealand, {{sharks and}} rays appear to be {{important}} prey; species taken include eagle rays, long-tail and short-tail stingrays, common threshers, smooth hammerheads, blue sharks and shortfin mako sharks. With sharks, orcas may herd them {{to the surface and}} strike them with their tail flukes, while bottom-dwelling rays are cornered, pinned to the ground and taken to the surface. Killer whales can induce tonic immobility in {{sharks and rays}} by holding them upside down, rendering them helpless and incapable of injuring the whale. Some sharks suffocate within about 15 minutes while the whale holds them still, because these sharks need to move to breathe. In one incident filmed near the Farallon Islands in October 1997, a [...] female killed a [...] great white shark, apparently after swimming with it upside-down <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> inducing tonic immobility in it. She and another pod member ate the shark's liver and allowed the rest of the carcass to sink. In February 2015, a pod of orcas was recorded to have killed a white shark off South Australia. Interspecific competition between the two species is probable in regions where dietary preferences overlap. Killer whales have also been recorded hunting tiger sharks. In July 1992, two killer whales attacked, killed and fed on an [...] long whale shark, Rhincodon typus, in the waters off Bahia de los Angeles in Baja California.|$|E

2500|$|The victim wore a blouse, bra, and slacks but no panties. The medical examiner, Dr. Donald Mills, was {{satisfied}} {{that the cause of}} death was accidental drowning. He signed a death certificate to that effect and released Kopechne's body to her family without ordering an autopsy; Kopechne was buried the day after she died. Later, on September 18, District Attorney Edmund Dinis attempted to secure an exhumation of Kopechne's body to perform a belated autopsy, citing blood found on Kopechne's long-sleeved blouse and <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> nose, [...] "which may or may not be consistent with death by drowning."

The restraining harness her father used had caused a thick callus and heavy black bruising on her buttocks, which took several weeks to heal. A series of X-rays found Genie had moderate coxa valga in both hips and an undersized ribcage, and doctors determined her bone age to be that of an 11-year-old.

25|$|Mouth brooders - carry eggs or larvae {{in their}} mouth. Mouth brooders can be ovophiles or larvophiles. Ovophile or egg-loving mouth-brooders {{lay their eggs}} in a pit, which are sucked up {{into the mouth of}} the female. The small number of large eggs hatch in the mother's <b>mouth,</b> <b>and</b> the fry remain there for a period of time. Fertilization often occurs with the help of egg-spots, which are {{colorful}} spots on the anal fin of the male. When the female sees these spots, she tries to pick up the egg-spots, but instead gets a mouthful of sperm, fertilizing the eggs <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> Many cichlids <b>and</b> some labyrinth fish are ovophile mouthbrooders. Larvophile or larvae-loving mouth-brooders lay their eggs on a substrate and guard them until the eggs hatch. After hatching, the female picks up the fry <b>and</b> keeps them <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> When the fry can fend for themselves, they are released. Some eartheaters are larvophile mouthbrooders.|$|R
