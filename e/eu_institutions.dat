While citizens {{in some states}} are {{highly critical of the}} <b>EU’s</b> <b>institutions,</b> others view them much more positively. Pieterjan Desmet and Claes de Vreese argue that public opinion toward the <b>EU’s</b> <b>institutions</b> can be shaped significantly by the quality of national political institutions within a member state. In those states with well regarded political <b>institutions,</b> the <b>EU</b> is likely to seem less democratic than it does to citizens living in a state with lower quality institutions...|$|R

25|$|The Belgian {{economy is}} heavily service-oriented and shows a dual nature: a dynamic Flemish {{economy and a}} Walloon economy that lags behind. One of the {{founding}} members of the European Union, Belgium strongly supports an open economy and {{the extension of the}} powers of <b>EU</b> <b>institutions</b> to integrate member economies. Since 1922, through the Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union, Belgium and Luxembourg have been a single trade market with customs and currency union.|$|E

25|$|The {{signing of}} the Treaty of Lisbon took place in Lisbon, Portugal on 13 December 2007. The Government of Portugal, by virtue of holding Presidency of the Council of the European Union at the time, {{arranged}} a ceremony inside the 15th century Jerónimos Monastery, the same place Portugal's treaty of accession to the European Union (EU) was signed in 1985.

25|$|Although the {{declaration}} was created without a formal affiliation with <b>EU</b> <b>institutions,</b> the European Commission (which has supported European {{projects such as}} the Tuning and TEEP projects) {{plays an important role}} in implementing the process. Most countries do not fit the framework, using their traditional systems. The process, which will result in bilateral agreements between countries and institutions which recognise each other's degrees, is moving from strict convergence in time spent on qualifications towards a competency-based system which will have an undergraduate and postgraduate division (with a bachelor's degree in the former and a master's and doctorate in the latter).|$|E
25|$|The European Union {{operates}} {{according to}} the principles of conferral (which says that it should act only within the limits of the competences conferred on it by the treaties) and of subsidiarity (which says that it should act only where an objective cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states acting alone). Laws made by the <b>EU</b> <b>institutions</b> are passed in a variety of forms. Generally speaking, they can be classified into two groups: those which come into force without the necessity for national implementation measures (regulations) and those which specifically require national implementation measures (directives).|$|E

50|$|Critics of the European Union {{assert that}} the Union's {{relative}} inability to establish itself as an influential external policy entity in the international level {{stems from the fact}} that the <b>EU's</b> <b>institutions</b> function on Kantian premises and are therefore ill-equipped to face the more primitive non-Kantian world outside.|$|R

The European Ombudsman is tasked with investigating complaints against <b>EU</b> <b>institutions</b> and bodies, including Europol, as well as assisting to create a more transparent, effective, accountable and ethical administration.

Partly {{as a result of}} this {{disappointed}} attitude concerning to the EU, Portugal has started to close ties with Africa, Brazil as well as with other Latin American countries, China, USA, Switzerland and other parts of the world, which has been reflected both in the investments, in foreign trade, and even in emigration.|$|E
