5|$|The main design {{differences}} with the Nclass included the cab front, exhaust arrangements, {{and the addition of}} an extra (inside) cylinder between the frames to drive the centre <b>driving</b> <b>axle.</b> Clayton had revised the layout of the cab front spectacle plates (small windows {{on the front of the}} cab) to improve forward visibility. This incorporated two large single panes of glass either side of the boiler instead of the four smaller windows used on the Nclass. The inside cylinder was to be actuated by Holcroft's design of conjugated valve gear, which consisted of mechanical links fitted to both sets of outside Walschaerts gear, eliminating the need for a separate set of valve gear between the frames to operate the inside cylinder. The result would be a reduction in weight and the amount of mechanical equipment located in this inaccessible part of the locomotive.|$|E
25|$|One {{solution}} to the problem was the Crampton design, in which the <b>driving</b> <b>axle</b> was moved behind the boiler's firebox. These engines were relatively long in comparison to their contemporaries, and had long rigid frames, sometimes with as many as three carrying axles ahead of the <b>driving</b> <b>axle,</b> creating a 6-2-0 wheel arrangement. Cramptons were most popular in France and Germany, but some were also used in England, by companies including the London & North Western Railway (LNWR).|$|E
25|$|As well as needing large wheels for speed, {{stability}} {{required a}} low centre of gravity, {{and thus a}} low-slung boiler. The difficulty was that the two conditions were in conflict, because the boiler of the locomotive would take up the space also needed for the <b>driving</b> <b>axle.</b>|$|E
50|$|A slow-running, large {{series-wound motor}} with 28 poles and two commutators drove the wheels, without any gear reduction, via an {{unsprung}} jackshaft. The jackshaft was linked by a coupling rod to three <b>driving</b> <b>axles</b> {{housed in the}} locomotive frame. The axle base of the <b>driving</b> <b>axles</b> was 2000 mm. The jackshaft was located {{between the first and}} second <b>driving</b> <b>axles.</b> The first and third <b>driving</b> <b>axles</b> were fixed to the frame, the centre one had transverse play to facilitate curve running. The mass was further distributed to two carrying axles that were designed as Adams axles. Control was achieved by means of a variable transformer (Drehtransformator) and power circuit breaker (Lastschalter) with 11 steps.|$|R

25|$|In 1858, Ramsbottom {{redesigned}} Cornwall almost completely. Little survived unchanged, {{other than}} the outside frames and the centres of the drivers.

25|$|On 25 September 1933, S301 broke a <b>driving</b> <b>axle</b> while hauling the 16:00 express to Albury, {{causing the}} left centre driving wheel to {{separate}} from the locomotive. There were no casualties, although the locomotive suffered significant damage. An investigation into the accident found that the axles were overstressed and the VR Commissioners announced that all four Sclass locomotives would be equipped with axles of a revised design.|$|E

50|$|Bavaria's {{state-owned}} railway chose {{a different}} way: They also used P, S, or G {{to indicate the}} train type, but combined with the numbers of <b>driving</b> <b>axles</b> and of the axles in total, separated by a slash (similar to the Swiss system). E. g., the famous S 3/6 was a 2'C1' or 4-6-2 Pacific, meaning that {{of a total of}} 6 <b>axles,</b> 3 were <b>driving</b> <b>axles.</b>|$|R

25|$|The line {{uses the}} Abt rack system devised by Roman Abt, a Swiss {{locomotive}} engineer. The system comprises {{a length of}} toothed rail (the rack) between the running rails which meshes with a toothed wheel (the pinion) mounted on each rail vehicle's <b>driving</b> <b>axle.</b> The traditional logo for the railway is a pinion ring engaged on a rack bar. At the stations and passing loops, the real items are mounted on steel frames.|$|E
25|$|Steam {{locomotives}} are locomotives with a {{steam engine}} that provides adhesion. Coal, petroleum, or wood is burned in a firebox, boiling {{water in the}} boiler to create pressurized steam. The steam travels through the smokebox before leaving via the chimney or smoke stack. In the process, it powers a piston that transmits power directly through a connecting rod (US: main rod) and a crankpin (US: wristpin) on the driving wheel (US main driver) or to a crank on a <b>driving</b> <b>axle.</b> Steam locomotives have been phased out {{in most parts of}} the world for economical and safety reasons, although many are preserved in working order by heritage railways.|$|E
25|$|A type long-familiar on French {{railways}} was the 4-cylinder de Glehn compound. The prototype, Nord 701, was a 2-2-2-0 {{designed by}} Alfred de Glehn, an {{engineer at the}} Société Alsacienne de Constructions Mécaniques (SACM), and ordered by Gaston du Bousquet, chief engineer of the Nord Railway. It had a 4-cylinder layout with the driving wheels uncoupled, and bore a superficial resemblance to a Webb compound, except that inside HP cylinders drove the leading <b>driving</b> <b>axle</b> whilst the LP cylinders were outside, driving the trailing axle. In 1891 two production locomotives, Nord 2.121 and 2.122, were placed in service with the cylinder positions inverted at du Bousquet's insistence, that is outside HP and inside LP, one of which initially had uncoupled driving axles as before but this arrangement proved inferior to the coupled version.|$|E
50|$|The <b>driving</b> <b>axles</b> {{were fixed}} in the frame, the leading {{carrying}} wheels were {{designed as a}} Novotny-Klien axle.|$|R
50|$|With cast frames (a few had frames {{flame cut}} from rolled steel slabs) and cast wheels, the front two <b>driving</b> <b>axles</b> were sprung {{independently}} {{from the rear}} two <b>driving</b> <b>axles,</b> to allow for running on poor quality track. The larger tender layout {{was derived from the}} similar design for the WD Austerity 2-8-0, with the coal bunker inset above the water tank to improve visibility when running backwards.|$|R

25|$|The {{locomotive}} pinions {{engage the}} rack and {{provide all the}} traction and braking effort; the wheels are free to revolve on the drive axles, {{to allow for the}} inevitable difference between the wheel radius and the effective radius of the pinion. The wheels serve only to support and guide the vehicle; if the pinion were missing, handbrake on and locomotive crank locked, the vehicle would still roll down the mountain. (The wheels are not capable of providing useful adhesion on such a gradient, so this is not the disadvantage it might seem.) The two <b>driving</b> <b>axle</b> pinions on a locomotive are mounted with a half a pitch difference between them. Combined with the half pitch difference in the two rack bars, this feature aims to make the transfer of power more continuous, and thus smooth the hauling of the train. In spite of this, the vehicles still suffer from very high levels of vibration.|$|E
25|$|The {{weight of}} the {{locomotive}} is roughly proportional to the power output; {{the number of axles}} required is determined by this weight divided by the axleload limit for the trackage where the locomotive is to be used. The number of driving wheels is derived from the adhesive weight in the same manner, leaving the remaining axles to be accounted for by the leading and trailing bogies. Passenger locomotives conventionally had two-axle leading bogies for better guidance at speed; on the other hand, the vast increase {{in the size of the}} grate and firebox in the 20th century meant that a trailing bogie was called upon to provide support. In Europe, some use was made of several variants of the Bissel bogie in which the swivelling movement of a single axle truck controls the lateral displacement of the front <b>driving</b> <b>axle</b> (and in one case the second axle too). This was mostly applied to 8-coupled express and mixed traffic locomotives, and considerably improved their ability to negotiate curves whilst restricting overall locomotive wheelbase and maximising adhesion weight.|$|E
500|$|The {{fast-moving}} {{and unpredictable}} Bulleid steam reverser {{was replaced with}} a screw-link version, whilst the mechanical lubricators were moved to the footplates along the boiler sides. [...] Sanding was also added to the leading <b>driving</b> <b>axle,</b> whilst rearward application was incorporated to the middle <b>driving</b> <b>axle.</b> [...] The first 'modified' locomotive {{to be released from}} Eastleigh was 35018 British India Line in 1956. The final example, 35028 Clan Line, was completed in 1960. The success of the modification programme for the Merchant Navy class was also to influence the design of the future modification of 60 'Light Pacifics'.|$|E

50|$|The seven <b>driving</b> <b>axles</b> {{were laid}} out 1.7 m apart, giving a very long rigid {{wheelbase}} of 10 m. This required adaptations to negotiate curves. The center three <b>driving</b> <b>axles</b> were blind, and the first and seventh <b>driving</b> <b>axles</b> were fitted with lateral motion devices. These measures were {{not enough to make}} the AA20-1 work properly, however. It was prone to frequent derailments, and despite its large number of wheels, it was still too heavy for the track. As a result of its long wheelbase, the AA20-1 also spread the track and wrecked the points of the switches it passed over. It was too big to fit on the turntables, too powerful for the couplers in use at the time and unable to run at full power for very long due to its undersized boiler.|$|R
50|$|Even {{some older}} {{electric}} locomotives have Bissell trucks, if the <b>driving</b> <b>axles</b> {{are located in}} the main frame rather than the now usual bogies.|$|R
500|$|Other {{innovations}} by Maunsell's team included greater superheating surface area, {{locating the}} boiler water top feed inside a dome-like cover with external clackboxes and water feed pipes mounted on either side, outside Walschaerts valve gear, and parts {{that could be}} shared with similar locomotive classes to reduce maintenance costs. The firebox was narrower towards the rear and featured a continuously sloping grate, whilst the ashpan was fitted with front and rear damper doors, the latter adjusted to clear the rear <b>driving</b> <b>axle.</b> The {{lower part of the}} coal bunker incorporated a water tank of [...] capacity. This was connected to two [...] side tanks by two rectangular pipes {{on either side of the}} locomotive that also formed supports for the cab footplate.|$|E
500|$|As a {{development}} of the Nclass, the N1class represented the next step forward for the British 2-6-0 concept, creating a capable workhorse equally adept at hauling passenger and freight traffic. The prototype proved economical in service as it used 10percent less coal than the Nclass, but used 11percent more water. However, the N1 design proved capable of fast speeds; No.822 reached [...] during trials between Charing Cross and Tonbridge in 1923. Once run-in, No.822 became popular amongst its regular crews as they favoured the way the three cylinders balanced cyclic forces on the <b>driving</b> <b>axle.</b> This resulted in improved riding characteristics on the footplate at low speeds whilst reducing mechanical wear {{and the effect of}} hammerblow on the track. The Holcroft valve gear also meant that No.822 was a comparatively light locomotive that could be used on weight-restricted routes.|$|E
500|$|At the Southern Railway’s January 1925 Locomotive Committee meeting, when it {{was decided}} to use outside {{contractors}} to build the Kclass, Maunsell received authority to retain one set of parts at Ashford works to construct a prototype 3-cylinder 2-6-4 tank. The modification was based upon that used on Nclass No.822 to produce a 3-cylinder locomotive in 1922, although it retained the [...] driving wheels and shorter wheelbase of the Kclass. The modification was the inclusion of an additional (inside) cylinder between the frames, and a crank axle was fitted to the middle driving wheels. The axle was connected to the inside cylinder assembly by a connecting rod inclined at 1 in 8 to clear the front <b>driving</b> <b>axle.</b> [...] This arrangement was supplemented by two smaller-diameter outside cylinders with [...] bore (compared to the [...] cylinders of the Kclass), and a greater chimney diameter. The resulting prototype 3-cylinder [...] "K1" [...] was narrower than the Kclass and hence could work on routes with restricted loading gauge. As with No.822, this locomotive used Holcroft's derivative of the Gresley conjugated valve gear to drive the inside cylinder. To accommodate this, the boiler had to be raised by [...] above the inside gear, raising the centre of gravity on the locomotive.|$|E

2500|$|Cornwall was {{an attempt}} to avoid the {{damaging}} long wheelbase of the Cramptons, whilst still permitting large driving wheels. By moving the <b>driving</b> <b>axle</b> ahead of the firebox, one of the carrying axles could be moved backwards, giving a shorter overall wheelbase. The difficulty of how to fit the axles past the boiler recurred, to which Trevithick provided an [...] "extremely complicated" [...] solution. The boiler was placed entirely underneath the <b>driving</b> <b>axle.</b> Even then, it was necessary to recess a transverse channel {{across the top of the}} boiler, so as to provide clearance for the <b>driving</b> <b>axle.</b> The trailing carrying axle passed through a crosswise tube through the middle of the firebox. This made assembly difficult, but as it was only a straight carrying axle rather than a cranked <b>driving</b> <b>axle,</b> the tube diameter required was manageable. This use of a cross-firebox axle tube was part of Crampton's patent of 1842. As completed in 1847, and first numbered 173, Cornwall was a 4-2-2 with 8'6" [...] drivers, paired leading wheels of 3'6", single trailing wheels of 4' and an overall wheelbase of 16'6". This is the condition in which she was exhibited at The Great Exhibition of 1851.|$|E
2500|$|On a tank {{locomotive}} {{the fuel}} (most often coal) is {{carried in a}} bunker the location of which can vary. [...] On a locomotive with a trailing carrying axle or a trailing bogie the bunker is generally situated {{to the rear of}} the cab, but in cases where the firebox overhangs the rear <b>driving</b> <b>axle,</b> it has been common practice to situate the bunker on top of and to one side of the firebox; this concentrates the weight and stabilises the locomotive.|$|E
2500|$|The X {{class was}} a {{development}} of the earlier C class 2-8-0 goods locomotive, designed to be gauge convertible from [...] to [...] {{in the event of}} the Victorian Railways network being converted to standard gauge.

The X class retained the same cylinder and driving wheel dimensions as the C class as well as its valve gear, but introduced a much larger boiler and a trailing truck behind the rear <b>driving</b> <b>axle.</b>|$|E
