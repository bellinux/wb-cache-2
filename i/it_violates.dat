25|$|On June 26, 2003, the Supreme Court {{released}} its 6–3 decision striking down the Texas statute. Five justices held <b>it</b> <b>violated</b> due process guarantees, and a sixth, Sandra Day O'Connor, held <b>it</b> <b>violated</b> equal protection guarantees. The five-member majority opinion overruled Bowers v. Hardwick and implicitly invalidated similar sodomy statutes in 13 other states.|$|R

5|$|Franklin {{points out}} that the {{technological}} nature of war requires states to conscript the resources needed to pay for hi-tech devices designed for destruction.

5|$|Current eagle feather law {{stipulates}} that only individuals of certifiable Native American ancestry {{enrolled in a}} federally recognized tribe are legally authorized to obtain or possess bald or golden eagle feathers for religious or spiritual use.

5|$|The {{original}} §14 of Article IV forbade {{the incorporation}} of churches, though the Virginia Commission on Constitutional Revision, in its 1969 report, had recognized that the prohibition was probably invalid. The federal district court for the Western District of Virginia ruled in April 2002 that this provision of the Virginia Constitution was in fact unconstitutional, because <b>it</b> <b>violates</b> the federal constitutional right to {{the free exercise of}} religion. The court found that it is unconstitutional to deny a church the option to incorporate under state law when other groups can incorporate. An amendment striking the ban on church incorporation was approved by Virginia voters in November 2006.|$|E
50|$|Several groups {{filed suit}} in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina against the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, {{regarding}} the Price Anderson Act.

50|$|The {{constitutionality}} of the Price-Anderson Act was upheld in June, 1978 by the Supreme Court {{in the case of}} Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group link. The lawsuit challenged the act on two grounds — first, that <b>it</b> <b>violated</b> the Fifth Amendment because it did not ensure adequate compensation for victims of accidents, and that <b>it</b> <b>violated</b> the Fourteenth Amendment because it treats nuclear accidents differently from other accidents.|$|R
5|$|Under the Act, it is a {{contempt}} of Parliament to perform certain acts, for instance, to insult the Speaker or any Member of Parliament (MP) coming to or going from Parliament {{on account of}} his or her conduct in Parliament or of anything done or said by him or her in Parliament; or to publish any statement, whether in writing or otherwise, which falsely or scandalously defames, or which reflects on the character of, the Speaker or any MP touching on his or her conduct in Parliament or anything done or said by him or her in Parliament. It is presumably not open to a person charged with one of these offences to argue that <b>it</b> <b>violates</b> the Article 14 right to freedom of speech and expression. However, there is not yet any case law addressing this provision, and thus little guidance as to how the courts are to interpret the restriction.|$|E
5|$|Evan loads {{hundreds}} of animals onto the Ark {{in front of}} {{hundreds of}} spectators and live news crews, who continue to mock him. Later, Long and the policemen arrive with a wrecking ball crew to try and destroy the ark, since <b>it</b> <b>violates</b> numerous building codes in Prestige Crest. When the wrecking crew threatens to demolish the ark within three minutes, a brief rainstorm occurs, prompting some of the spectators to leave. The rain also prevents the crew from proceeding, buying Evan a little time. Evan connects Long's profiteering ethics and what God had already {{told him about the}} original form of Prestige Crest, and realizes that the dam under Long Lake had violated building codes and will likely prepare to burst. Evan warns to those present must immediately board the ark, and many have do so when the prophesied flood is triggered soon after the dam bursts. Prestige Crest is catastrophically destroyed, and the ark later rides the flood through the streets and landmarks of Washington, D.C.. The ark reaches its final destination in front of the Capitol, which disrupts the vote on the Public Land Act bill. Long becomes outraged that the flood did really happen. Evan informs Long that the flood was actually caused by his poor design of the dam, which prompts the other Congressmen also present to turn against Long.|$|E
5|$|The House of Lords' {{statement}} on parliamentary privilege {{was assessed by}} the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege, which recommended that Parliament not counter the decision in Pepper v Hart, but cautioned that this should not lead to any further weakening of parliamentary privilege. However, academics widely condemned the decision and the thinking behind it. Academic Aileen Kavanagh questioned the logic used; the House of Lords was essentially saying that, where a minister has made a statement about an act's intent that was not questioned by Parliament, that statement {{can be used as}} evidence. However, there are many reasons why Members of Parliament might not question a statement, and this does not necessarily indicate that they approve of it; {{in the case of the}} Finance Act, for example, it could simply be that as the statement was not going to be added to the statute, they found no reason to actively oppose it. At the same time, different Members of Parliament may approve of a statutory provision for different reasons. The fact that a minister gives certain reasons for including a provision does not necessarily indicate that Parliament agrees; only that Parliament also feels, for whatever reason, that the provision should be included. The decision also raises questions about the separation of powers in the United Kingdom; it has been consistently maintained that it is Parliament, not the executive, which passes legislation. If one accepts that statements by the executive can allow them to specify the meaning of particular laws without formally including them in statutes where they can be approved by Parliament, <b>it</b> <b>violates</b> this separation of powers, allowing the executive to make law.|$|E
