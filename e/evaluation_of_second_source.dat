40|$|We {{study the}} {{decision}} of a manufacturer (the buyer), expecting new sourcing opportunities in the future, in selecting between sole- and second-sourcing strategies for a noncommodity component. In a sole-sourcing strategy, the buyer commits to sourcing from a single supplier (the incumbent) over the entire horizon. In a second-sourcing strategy, the buyer keeps the option open to source from a new supplier (the entrant) in the future. Supplier costs are private information, and the incumbent's cost may change in the future because of what it has learned. The buyer is relatively sure about current demand but uncertain about future demand. A supplier has to invest in capacity to produce the inputs for the buyer. With future private cost information, the incumbent earns rent in the future, and this prospective rent influences the incumbent's decision early in the horizon. On one hand, a second-sourcing strategy allows the buyer {{to take advantage of}} alternative sourcing opportunities, lowering her future cost. This benefit to the buyer {{is referred to as the}} option value <b>of</b> <b>second</b> <b>sourcing.</b> On the other hand, the future supplier competition in second-sourcing hurts the incumbent's future profit. The expectation of a lower future profit in <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> induces the incumbent to ask for a higher price at the beginning of the horizon. This causes more initial sourcing cost for the buyer in <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> than in sole sourcing, and is referred to as the cost of future supplier competition <b>of</b> <b>second</b> <b>sourcing.</b> The overall benefit <b>of</b> <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> relative to sole sourcing is influenced by the demand distribution and capacity cost. If the demand increases over time with positive probability, the incumbent's initial capacity may not be able to cover all future demand. If the capacity is cheap, the entrant may serve as an exclusive supplier, ousting the incumbent. In this case, the option value <b>of</b> <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> is high. If the capacity is expensive, the entrant may serve as a supplementary supplier by receiving only the demand in excess of the incumbent's installed capacity. In this case, the cost of future supplier competition is low and the option value is still significant. Thus <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> is better than sole sourcing not only when the capacity cost is low, but also when it is high (under the condition that demand increases over time with positive probability and the entrant's cost is relatively low). For intermediate capacity cost, the cost of future supplier competition dominates the option value; hence, sole sourcing is preferred. We also find that <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> is more attractive when the buyer expects the future demand to be higher or more volatile. Finally, more initial incumbent capacity strengthens the incumbent's competitiveness against the entrant, reducing the cost of future supplier competition. As a result, we find that <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> may lead to overinvestment of the initial capacity. sourcing, auction, supplier relationship, supply chain management...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Multinationals often serve {{foreign markets}} by {{producing}} domestically and exporting {{as well as}} by investing directly in foreign production facilities. We argue that if the multinational competes in an oligopolistic market characterized by strategic complements then there are strategic reasons to use two production facilities [...] committing to a <b>second</b> <b>source</b> allows the firm to keep average cost low {{while at the same time}} increasing its marginal cost. The increase in marginal cost softens product market competition resulting in higher profits. In our model, firms can sink capacity domestically, where the constant marginal cost is known, sink capacity in the foreign country, where the constant marginal cost is uncertain, or do both. In the absence of strategic considerations, the firm usually chooses to either export or use foreign direct investment [...] it rarely uses both sources of production. In contrast, price competition in the product market makes it much more likely that the firm will choose to use a <b>second</b> <b>source.</b> In fact, there are cases in which the firm sinks capacity in both locations even in the absence of cost uncertainty. We argue that this theory also has implications for the “make or buy ” literature in production management and the literature on <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> in industrial organization. Finally, we show that the practice <b>of</b> <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> has implications for the degree of exchange rate pass through when the uncertainty about foreign costs is driven by fluctuations in the exchange rate...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a two-period model of repeated franchise bidding or <b>second</b> <b>sourcing.</b> A regulator contracts {{with a single}} firm in each period, presumably because of increasing returns to scale. The incumbent firm invests in the first period. The investment may be transferable to a <b>second</b> <b>source</b> or not; and may be monetary or in human capital. Each firm has private information about its intrinsic efficiency, and, if it is selected to produce. about the cost-reducing effort it exerts and the investment it makes. The regulator, however, observes the firm's realized cost {{at the end of}} the period (the cost includes monetary investments and may be random). In the second period the incumbent firm can be replaced by an entrant. The regulator commits to an optimal breakout rule. The paper generalizes an earlier result that the optimal policy is to regulate through contracts linear in cost overruns. It also derives conclusions concerning the intertemporal evolution of incentive schemes. Mainly, it puts emphasis on the issue of bidding parity. It shows that three basic effects guide the optimal bias in the second-period auctioning process and determines whether the incumbent should be favored depending on the nature of investments. The outcome of the analysis is a relatively pessimistic assessment of the desirability <b>of</b> <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> when sizeable investments are at stake.
