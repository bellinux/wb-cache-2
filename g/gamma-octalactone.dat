40|$|Stable isotope {{dilution}} assays {{have been}} developed for <b>gamma-octalactone</b> (1), gamma-nonalactone (2), gamma-decalactone (3) and gamma-dodecalactone (4) in both white and red wines for the first time. (2) H(7) -analogues of each lactone were prepared for use as internal standards via a strategy employing ring-opening, esterification and oxidation of the respective starting lactones. The methods were shown to be highly accurate and reproducible (R(2) > or = 0. 999; SD < or = 1 %). A large selection of Australian wines (n = 178) were analyzed for the presence of lactones 1 - 4. Fifty-eight white wines covering the varieties Chardonnay, Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc, Semillon and Viognier, as well as Botrytis style wines, were analyzed and showed broadly that <b>gamma-octalactone</b> (1) was the most common lactone, being observed above its limit of detection in 28 of the wines, followed by gamma-nonalactone (2) in 23 wines. The Botrytis style white wines had the highest concentrations of 1 and 2 (maximum concentrations 8. 5 and 59 microg/L respectively). A total of 120 red wines covering the varieties Cabernet Sauvignon, Durif, Merlot, Pinot Noir and Shiraz were also studied and showed <b>gamma-octalactone</b> (1) and gamma-nonalactone (2) to be the most common lactones present, in 56 and 57 of the wines, respectively. gamma-Decalactone (3) was observed in only a small number (13) of red wine samples and not at all in the white varieties. gamma-Dodecalactone (4) was absent from all 178 samples studied. The highest concentrations of lactones 1, 2 and 3 in the red wines were 4. 2, 39. 7 and 4. 0 microg/L respectively. Rachel C. Cooke, Dimitra L. Capone, Katryna A. van Leeuwen, Gordon M.

40|$|International audienceWhereas {{the house}} mouse (Mus domesticus) {{has been studied}} {{extensively}} in terms of physiology/behavior and pheromonal attributes, the evolutionarily related mound-building mouse (Mus spicilegus) has received attention only recently due to its divergent behavioral traits related to olfaction. To date, no chemical studies on urinary volatile compounds have been performed on M. spicilegus. The rationale for our investigations {{was to determine if}} there are differences in urinary volatiles of intact and castrated M. spicilegus males and to explore further whether this species could utilize the same or structurally similar pheromones as the male house mouse, M. domesticus. The use of capillary gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) together with sorptive stir bar extraction sampling enabled quantitative comparisons between the intact and castrated M. spicilegus urinary profiles. Additionally, through GC-MS and atomic emission (sulfur-selective) detection, we identified qualitative molecular differences between intact M. spicilegus and M. domesticus. A series of volatile and odoriferous lactones and the presence of coumarin were the unique features of M. spicilegus, as was the notable absence of 2 -sec-butyl- 4, 5 -dihydrothiazole (a prominent M. domesticus male pheromone) and other sulfur-containing compounds. Castration of M. spicilegus males eliminated several substances, including delta-hexalactone and <b>gamma-octalactone,</b> and substantially decreased additional compounds, suggesting their possible role in chemical communication. Some other M. domesticus pheromone components were also found in M. spicilegus urine. These comparative chemical analyses support the notion of metabolic similarities as well as the uniqueness of some volatiles for M. spicilegus, which may have a distinct physiological function in reproduction and behavior...|$|E
40|$|Entre as inúmeras frutas tropicais e subtropicais produzidas no Brasil, duas que se destacam do ponto de vista do aroma da polpa são maracujá amarelo (Passiflora edulis forma Flavicarpa) e cajá (Spondias mombin L.). Os voláteis da polpa destas frutas foram capturados pela técnica de {{headspace}} dinâmico e analisados no sistema de cromatografia gasosa de alta resolução e espectrometria de massa. Foram identificados 48 e 33 compostos voláteis na polpa de maracujá e cajá, respectivamente. Os compostos voláteis predominantes na polpa de maracujá pertenceram às classes de ésteres (59, 24 %), aldeídos (15, 27 %), cetonas (11, 70 %) e álcoois (6, 56 %), enquanto na polpa de cajá as principais classes de compostos foram de ésteres (48, 76 %), álcoois (21, 69 %), aldeídos (11, 61 %) e cetonas (4, 19 %). Outros compostos aromáticos característicos foram para maracujá: beta-ionona e linalol e para cajá: gama-octalactona e ácidos butírico e hexanóico. Among {{the numerous}} tropical and sub-tropical fruits produced in Brazil, two that attain relatively greater importance {{from the point}} of view of aroma of their pulp are yellow passion fruit (Passiflora edulis forma Flavicarpa) and yellow mombin (Spondias mombin L.). The volatile components in the pulp of these fruits were captured by dynamic headspace technique and were analyzed in a system of high-resolution gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Forty-eight and thirty-one volatile compounds were identified in passion fruit and yellow mombin fruit pulp, respectively. The predominant volatile compounds in passion fruit pulp belonged to the classes of esters (59. 24 %), aldehydes (15. 27 %), ketones (11. 70 %) and alcohols (6. 56 %) while in the yellow mombin pulp, the principal classes of compounds were esters (48. 76 %), alcohols (21. 69 %). aldehydes (11. 61 %) and ketones (4. 19 %). The other characteristic aroma compounds for passion fruit were beta-ionone and linalool and for yellow mombin were <b>gamma-octalactone,</b> butanoic and hexanoic acids...|$|E
