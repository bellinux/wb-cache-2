They claim to have discovered a “Stradivari of 1692, the finest {{in the world for}} sale at £1,000.” The violin was originally sold by William Voller to Balfour for £45 with no attempt to defraud or mislabel and thus takes its name from the company that subsequently offered it for sale. Balfours’ exploited this ‘find’ in a remarkable way; certificates given with enthusiasm and florid descriptions were gathered from Silvestre-Maucotel, Gustav Bernardel, Nestor Audinot, C.A. Chanot, F.W. Chanot and the wholesale firm of Beare & Sons - George Hart, J. &A. Beare and W.E. Hill & Sons were conspicuous by their absence. These certificates with translations surround Balfour & Co.’s general <b>guarantee</b> <b>document.</b> After an unsuccessful attempt to sell it at Puttnick's (where it was bought in) it was sold privately for £2,500. This prompted an anonymus letter stating : [...] "You know it is only a clever [...] "Fake" [...] and signed [...] "One who knows who made it". Once the new owner of the [...] "Balfour" [...] violin realized his mistake, civil court proceedings were instigated that resulted in an out-of-court settlement." ...|$|E
30|$|The {{incremental}} {{validation process}} proposed and implemented {{in this paper}} {{is based on a}} categorization of NCL language elements that highlights which parts of code need to be validated further after the developer makes an editing on the document. Our proposal is organized into two distinct stages: firstly, it analyzes the local effects of a code modification and looks for any side effects that it may have triggered. Secondly, it selects the type of validation to be employed in order to <b>guarantee</b> <b>document</b> consistency. The determination of side effects is especially important, since NCL has elements, such as links and connectors, that semantically and syntactically bind elements distributed throughout the NCL document and which may not be so obviously correlated. This feature is accomplished through a metalanguage that provides a formal annotation of these relationships between elements and media objects in NCL documents. The incremental method implemented here also allows the fine tuning of the interval between subsequent validations, given one may wish a more immediate system response (by validating each change) or a more conservative and efficient behavior (by validating a group of changes).|$|E
40|$|It is an {{obligation}} that the fiduciary guarantee documents are {{registered in the}} form of authentic documents from the notary public so that the fiduciary recipients get their priority in paying debt. Practically, many financing institutions do not register the fiduciary <b>guarantee</b> <b>document</b> in fiduciary registration office. Many fiduciary guarantee documents are not {{in the form of}} authentic documents from the notary public because of the complicated procedures and spending much money. Besides, the registration office is located in every capital city in Indonesia. This causes a big question whether the fiduciary constitution is valuable or not. This thesis aims to know and understand the evaluative validity of fiduciary guarantee registration based on the fiduciary constitution. The normative method will be used which covers two aspects. In doing the analysis, the writer will use qualitative analysis, while in making conclusion, the deductive method will be used. From the analysis, the writer concludes that the fiduciary constitution is not valuable because {{it takes a lot of}} times and money to complete the procedures. Also, the basic problem is that the registration office is only in capital city and that makes many businessmen from other cities difficult to do the registration. Based on the findings, there are some suggestions that the writer wants to give. The registration process can be done underhanded to shorten the procedures and save money. The government builds branch offices not only in capital cities, but also regencies. ...|$|E

He said, [...] "In the present case ... it was ... evident to the bank that Mr. and Mrs. Amadio stood in need of advice as to the nature and effect of the transaction into which they were entering. It is apparent that any such advice would have included the importance to a guarantor of ascertaining from the bank {{the state of the}} customer's account which was being guaranteed and any unusual features of the account. If such information had been obtained by Mr. and Mrs. Amadio, they would not, on the evidence and {{in the light of the}} learned trial judge's finding, have entered into the guarantee/mortgage at all. The whole transaction should properly be seen as flowing from the special disability which was evident to the bank and as being unfair, unjust and unreasonable." [...] The customer's account stated here is that of their son who brought the bank <b>guarantee</b> <b>documents</b> to his parents. The bank knew of the poor state of the son's business accounts, and the bank and the son had a history of closely linked business relations with each other. Wilson J agreed with Deane J.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Compliance {{storage is}} an {{increasingly}} important area for businesses faced with a myriad of new document retention regulations. Today, businesses have turned to Write-One Read Many (WORM) storage technology to achieve compliance. But WORM answers {{only a part of}} the compliance puzzle; in addition to <b>guaranteed</b> <b>document</b> retention, businesses also need secure indexing, to ensure auditors can find required documents in a large database, secure deletion to expire documents (and their index entries) from storage once they are past their expiry period, and support for litigation holds, which require that certain documents are retained pending the resolution of active litigation. We build upon previous work in compliance storage and attribute-based encryption to design a system that satisfies all three of these requirements. In particular, we design a new encrypted index, which allows the owner of a database of documents to grant access to only those documents that match a particular query. This enables litigation holds for expired documents, {{and at the same time}} restricts auditor access for unexpired documents, greatly limiting the potential for auditor abuse as compared to previous work. We show by way of formal security proofs that our construction is secure and that it prevents reconstruction attacks wherein the index is used to recover the contents of the document. Our experiments show that our scheme can be practical for large databases and moderate sizes of queries. ...|$|R

40|$|Keyphrases {{are widely}} used as a brief summary of documents. Since manual {{assignment}} is time-consuming, various unsupervised ranking methods based on importance scores are proposed for keyphrase extraction. In practice, the keyphrases of a document should not only be statistically important in the document, but also have a good coverage of the document. Based on this observation, we propose an unsupervised method for keyphrase extraction. Firstly, the method finds exemplar terms by leveraging clustering techniques, which <b>guarantees</b> the <b>document</b> to be semantically covered by these exemplar terms. Then the keyphrases are extracted from the document using the exemplar terms. Our method outperforms sate-of-the-art graphbased ranking methods (TextRank) by 9. 5 % in F 1 -measure. ...|$|R
