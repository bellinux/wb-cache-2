5|$|In {{spite of}} these {{valuable}} contributions to the Spartan cause, Alcibiades fell out of favor with the Spartan government at around this time, ruled by Agis II. Leotychides, the son born by Agis's wife Timaia shortly after this, was believed {{by many to be}} Alcibiades's son. Alcibiades's influence was further reduced after the retirement of Endius, the <b>ephor</b> who was on good terms with him. It is alleged that Astiochus, a Spartan Admiral, was sent orders to kill him, but Alcibiades received warning of this order and defected to the Persian satrap Tissaphernes, who had been supporting the Peloponnesian forces financially in 412 BC.|$|E
2500|$|The {{early stages}} of World War I, with Romania {{maintaining}} neutrality, saw Rosetti campaigning for the Central Powers. His advised against any alliance with the Russian Empire, being fearful of Pan-Slavism and supportive of the Romanian claims in Bessarabia. He was disappointed when the country sided with Russia, and remained behind in Bucharest when it was occupied by the Central Powers; with Carp and other Conservatives, he organized a collaborationist bureaucracy, and served in it as <b>Ephor</b> of the Civilian Hospitals. Such choices contrasted those of his son, who became a war hero. Reunited with him in postwar Greater Romania, Rosetti still pursued his literary career, receiving accolades for his final works as a memoirist and raconteur. One of his [...] "Moldavian tales" [...] was adapted for the screen by his son-in-law, Victor Beldiman.|$|E
2500|$|Rosetti {{the elder}} {{remained}} behind in occupied Bucharest, where he rejoined a cell of Conservatives that included former Prime Ministers Carp and Maiorescu, {{as well as}} the Beldimans. His most controversial career move was open collaboration with the Germans and Germanophiles: in June 1917, he was nominated as minister in a putative Carp government. He ended up accepting a more minor position under Lupu Kostaki, becoming <b>Ephor</b> of the Civilian Hospitals. According to his son-in-law Victor Beldiman and his friend Bianu, Rosetti proved himself a staunch and dignified administrator, refusing to bow down to the Germans. Nonetheless, he was also involved in the intrigues dividing the Bucharest Conservatives. He supported Carp against Kostaki and Alexandru Marghiloman, and, the latter claims, promoted to high office favorites such as Jan Zaplachta. Meanwhile, with Beldiman, he also began collecting proof for a [...] "Brătianu file", to be used for denouncing the PNL chief.|$|E
50|$|The apella also {{elected the}} five <b>ephors</b> annually. <b>Ephors</b> presided over {{meetings}} of the gerousia and the apella. They could not run for re-election.|$|R
50|$|The <b>ephors</b> held {{numerous}} duties including legislative, judicial, financial, {{and executive}} duties. They {{had the power}} to indict a king, who would then be tried before the <b>ephors</b> and gerousia. The gerousia were the Supreme Court of Sparta. Historians Paul Cartledge, Bury and Huxley agree that the <b>ephors</b> attained powers as great as the kings during the 7th century BC.|$|R
25|$|Confident of {{his strong}} position, Cleomenes began {{plotting}} against the <b>ephors.</b> After gaining {{the support of}} his stepfather, he embarked with him on a whirlwind military expedition against his opponents, and when they requested to stay in Arcadia due to exhaustion he returned to Sparta to carry out his reform plans. When he reached the city, he sent some of his loyal followers to kill the <b>ephors.</b> Four of the <b>ephors</b> were killed, while the fifth, Agylaeus, managed to escape and seek sanctuary in a temple. Having removed the <b>ephors,</b> Cleomenes began to implement his reforms.|$|R
60|$|Agis {{thought his}} uncle Agesilaus was heartily with the change, {{and so had}} him chosen one of the Ephors; but, in truth, all Agesilaus wanted was {{to be free from}} his debts, and he persuaded the young king that the lands could not be freshly divided till all debts had been cancelled. So all the bonds were brought into the market-place and burnt, while Agesilaus cried out that he had never seen so fine a fire; but having done this, he was {{resolved}} not to part with his wealth, and delayed till the Ætolians made an attack on the Peloponnesus, and Aratus called on Sparta to assist the Achaians. Agis was sent at the head of an army to the Isthmus, and there behaved like an ancient Spartan king, sharing all the toils and hardships of the soldiers, and wearing nothing to distinguish him from them; but while he was away everything had gone wrong at Sparta; people had gone back to their old bad habits, and Agesilaus was using his office of <b>Ephor</b> so shamefully that he had been obliged to have a guard of soldiers to protect him from the people. This behaviour had made the people suspect his nephew of being dishonest in his reforms, and they had sent to recall Leonidas.|$|E

25|$|The royal prerogatives were curtailed over time. Dating {{from the}} period of the Persian wars, the king lost the right to declare war and was {{accompanied}} in the field by two <b>ephors.</b> He was supplanted also by the <b>ephors</b> in the control of foreign policy.

5000|$|The <b>ephors</b> were {{leaders of}} ancient Sparta and shared {{power with the}} two Spartan kings. The <b>ephors</b> were a council of five elected {{annually}} who swore [...] "on behalf of the city", while the kings swore for themselves.|$|R

5|$|After fortifying Belbina, Cleomenes {{advanced}} into Arcadia with 3,000 {{infantry and}} a few cavalry. However, he was called back by the <b>ephors,</b> and this retreat allowed Aratus to seize Caphyae as soon as Cleomenes returned to Laconia. Once this news reached Sparta, the <b>ephors</b> sent Cleomenes out again; he managed to capture the Megalopian city Methydrium before ravaging the territory surrounding Argos.|$|R
5|$|Cleomenes, {{who was now}} {{confident}} {{of the strength of}} his position, began plotting against the <b>ephors.</b> He first recruited his stepfather, persuading him of the need {{to do away with the}} <b>ephors.</b> Cleomenes contended they could then make the ephors' property common to all citizens and work toward the achievement of Spartan supremacy in Greece. Having won over his stepfather, Cleomenes started preparing his revolution. Employing the men he considered most likely to oppose him (probably in an attempt to get them killed), he captured Heraea and Asea. He also brought in food for the citizens of Orchomenus—which the Achaeans were besieging—before camping outside Mantinea. This campaign exhausted his opponents, who asked to remain in Arcadia so they could rest. Cleomenes then advanced upon Sparta with his mercenaries and sent some loyal followers to slay the <b>ephors.</b> Four of the five <b>ephors</b> were killed; the sole survivor was Agylaeus, who managed to escape and sought sanctuary in a temple.|$|R

He was {{appointed}} nauarch (ναύαρχος) of the Spartan fleet in 405 BCE, with Lysander as his vice-admiral (ἐπιστολεύς); Lysander was to have the actual power, but could not be named nauarch because Spartan law did not allow the same person to hold this office twice.|$|E

50|$|Sparta {{remained}} independent, {{but it was}} {{no longer}} the leading military power in the Peloponnese. The Spartan king Cleomenes III (235-222 BC) staged a military coup against the conservative <b>ephors</b> and pushed through radical social and land reforms in order to increase the size of the shrinking Spartan citizenry able to provide military service and restore Spartan power. Sparta's bid for supremacy was crushed at the Battle of Sellasia (222) by the Achaean league and Macedon, who restored the power of the <b>ephors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The <b>ephors</b> {{planned to}} arrest Pausanias in the street, {{but he was}} warned of their plans and escaped to the temple of Athena of the Brazen House. The <b>ephors</b> walled up the doors, put sentries outside and {{proceeded}} to starve him out. When Pausanias {{was on the brink}} of death by starvation they carried him out, and he died soon afterwards. [...] Thus Pausanias did not die within the sanctuary of the temple, which would have been an act of ritual pollution.|$|R
50|$|Excavations at the temenos {{sacred to}} Isis and other Egyptian deities were {{conducted}} in 1917 by the then <b>Ephor</b> of Antiquities for the island of Evia (Euboea), Ι. Papadakis.

50|$|Chilonis, {{daughter}} of the king Leonidas II and his wife Cratesiclea, a woman of Persian origin, became Queen of Sparta in 272 BC, when the father was deposed from the throne by the <b>ephor</b> Lysander and substituted by her husband Cleombrotus II. In that circumstance, Chilonis preferred to follow her father in his exile, instead of remaining in Sparta with her husband, the new king.|$|E
5000|$|The Arkalochori cave {{first came}} to {{scholarly}} attention in 1912, when peasants collected 20 kilos of Bronze Age weapons from the cave (known locally as [...] "the treasure hole") and sold them for scrap metal in the port town of Candia (Iraklion). The <b>ephor</b> Iosif Hatzidakis, the first explorer of the central cave chamber of three, discovered masses of bronze votive weapons and a silver labrys (double axe).|$|E
5000|$|The apella simply {{accepted}} or {{rejected the}} proposals submitted to it. In later times, too, the actual debate was almost, if not wholly, {{confined to the}} kings, elders, <b>ephors</b> and perhaps the other magistrates. The apella voted on peace and war, treaties and foreign policy in general: it decided which of the kings should conduct a campaign and settled questions of disputed succession to the throne: it elected elders, <b>ephors</b> and other magistrates, emancipated helots and perhaps voted on legal proposals.|$|R
25|$|Cleomenes {{advanced}} into Arcadia {{before being}} called {{back by the}} <b>ephors.</b> When Aratus captured Caphyae, the <b>ephors</b> sent him out again. He ravaged the territory of Argos with an army of 5,000 men before being confronted by the new strategos of the Achaean League, Aristomachos of Argos and his army consisting of 20,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry at Pallantium. Aratus, who accompanied Aristomachos as an adviser, urged him to retreat. Smith agrees with Aratus' assessment that 20,000 Achaeans were no match for 5,000 Spartans.|$|R
500|$|In 479 BC, {{one year}} after the Battle of Thermopylae, Dilios, a hoplite in the Spartan Army, begins his story by {{depicting}} the life of Leonidas I from childhood to kingship via Spartan doctrine. Dilios's story continues and Persian messengers arrive at the gates of Sparta demanding [...] "earth and water" [...] as a token of submission to King Xerxes; the Spartans reply by killing and kicking the messengers into a well. Leonidas then visits the <b>Ephors,</b> proposing a strategy to drive back the numerically superior Persians through the Hot Gates; his plan involves building a wall in order to funnel the Persians into a narrow pass between the rocks and the sea. The <b>Ephors</b> consult the Oracle, who decrees that Sparta will not go to war during the Carneia. As Leonidas angrily departs, a messenger from Xerxes appears, rewarding the <b>Ephors</b> for their covert support.|$|R
