2500|$|In 2004, {{during a}} {{football}} game between Oklahoma and Nebraska {{a member of the}} RUF/NEKS was injured by Darren DeLone, a 320-pound Nebraska football player. DeLone collided with the RUF/NEK, throwing him eight feet back into a brick wall injuring <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> spine and knocking out two teeth. [...] DeLone was charged by the Cleveland County District Attorney's Office with having acted intentionally, but he was acquitted.|$|E
2500|$|Producer David Puttnam viewed {{footage from}} a 1924 film of Liddell and Abrahams while researching the film with {{scriptwriter}} Colin Welland and Liddell's unorthodox running style as {{portrayed in the}} film, with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> his mouth wide open, is also said to be accurate. At an athletics championship in Glasgow, a visitor watching the 440 yard final in which Liddell {{was a long way}} behind the leaders {{at the start of the}} last lap (of a 220-yard track) remarked to a Glasgow native that Liddell would be hard put to win the race. The Glaswegian merely replied, [...] "His head's no' back yet." [...] Liddell then threw <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> with mouth wide open caught and passed his opponents to win the race. In the 1945 report of his death The Guardian wrote [...] "He is remembered among lovers of athletics as probably the ugliest runner who ever won an Olympic championship. When he appeared in the heats of the 400m at Paris in 1924 his huge sprawling stride, his head thrown back and his arms clawing the air, moved the Americans and other sophisticated experts to ribald laughter." [...] Rival Harold Abrahams said in response to criticism of Liddell's style: [...] "People may shout their heads off about his appalling style. Well, let them. He gets there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wei Yan {{was left}} with only his son(s) and a few followers. They fled towards Hanzhong Commandery. Yang Yi ordered Ma Dai to give chase. Ma Dai caught up with Wei Yan, decapitated him, brought <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> threw {{it in front of}} Yang Yi. Yang Yi trampled on Wei Yan's head and said, [...] "You {{inferior}} slave! Now, can you still commit evil?" [...] Wei Yan's family members and close relatives were also executed. Before Wei Yan's death, Jiang Wan had led divisions of the imperial guards from Chengdu to deal with the conflict. They had travelled for about 10 li (about three miles) when they received news of Wei Yan's death, after which they returned to Chengdu.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>his</b> <b>head</b> fell <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> {{the peace}} of death descended on his {{tortured}} brow.|$|R
6000|$|... [Illustration: He was now {{towering over}} those near him, with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> thrown <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> hair tossed like a mane on his shoulders] ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Bhaer {{helped him}} into her own room, and, once there, he dropped into a chair, <b>and</b> laid <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>back,</b> white <b>and</b> faint with weariness and suffering.|$|R
2500|$|The {{character}} {{first appeared}} in the Defenders of the Realm cartoon and Mythologies as a tall, bald figure wearing an teal-colored bodysuit under a black tabard adorned with ornamental spikes on the shoulders, accented by a yin-yang symbol on the sternum. Designed by Mortal Kombat co-creator John Tobias, this style was carried over into Mortal Kombat 4, but for Deadly Alliance, the first release following Tobias' 2000 departure from Midway, Quan Chi's design was minimized with him going shirtless and revealing a well-built physique with only a black bandolier across his chest, in addition to simple black trousers and knee-high boots, with Shinnok's amulet usually attached to his belt; this has remained his primary template in all his MK appearances thereafter, while his first design returned as an alternate costume in several games. In conceptual sketches by Deadly Alliance character designer Allen Ditzig, Quan Chi was seen brandishing a [...] "mysterious living weapon"—a staff topped with a grotesque head capable of spewing green mist and flies from its mouth. Though the staff was cut from the game, its concept was used in the creation of Drahmin, one of whose offensive moves involved shooting flies at his opponent. The one element of Quan Chi's design that has remained unchanged is his albino skin tone, with simple parallel black stripes extending upward from his eyelids and extending over {{the top of his head}} in his first appearances, then enhanced in Deadly Alliance and onward with an extensive collection of red tattoo-like markings on <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> arms, in addition to an elliptical red gem planted in the center of his forehead.|$|E
60|$|He flung <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> laughed his throaty {{affected}} cackle of anger.|$|E
60|$|The {{other man}} laughed with amusement, {{throwing}} <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> showing his teeth.|$|E
60|$|Something {{that she}} said {{appeared}} to tickle his fancy, for at her words he threw <b>his</b> <b>head</b> right <b>back</b> <b>and</b> laughed immoderately, loudly and long.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look at Hirst!" [...] Mr. Flushing whispered. His {{sheet of}} paper had slipped on to the deck, <b>his</b> <b>head</b> lay <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> he drew a long snoring breath.|$|R
6000|$|The {{stranger}} was asleep, with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> thrown <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> mouth slightly open. Alec {{wondered whether}} {{his opinion of}} the affair would be that of the majority. He thought Alec should shoot himself? ...|$|R
60|$|Hapley {{suddenly}} moved <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> looked {{with both}} eyes. His mouth fell open with astonishment.|$|E
60|$|Then {{he threw}} <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> {{began to talk}} still more arrogantly and defiantly than he had done hitherto.|$|E
60|$|Bridge halted and {{stretched}} himself. He threw <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> let the warm sun beat down upon his bronzed face.|$|E
60|$|Standing erect {{he threw}} <b>his</b> <b>head</b> far <b>back</b> <b>and</b> looking full into {{the eye of}} the rising moon he beat upon his breast with his great hairy paws and emitted his fearful roaring shriek.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{you will}} go home and burn all the poetry--all the manuscripts, and never let the {{children}} write a verse--a verse--when I am dead?" [...] <b>And</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> sank <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> jaw dropped.|$|R
6000|$|... (GEORGE {{makes an}} attempt to sit up, but <b>his</b> <b>head</b> falls <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> [...] eyes close again. Then DR. JONATHAN lays his hand on Dr. FRYE's [...] arm, as though to draw him aside.) ...|$|R
60|$|He half {{closed his}} eyes and tipped <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> {{swallowed}} a couple of times, as if he already tasted one of those eggs.|$|E
6000|$|She {{jerked her}} hand away, and, burying it with its mate in his curly mop, shook <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> forth. [...] "What shall I do with him, father?" ...|$|E
60|$|Wally threw <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> {{uttered a}} roar of {{appreciation}} which caused a luncher at a neighbouring table to drop an oyster {{which he was}} poising in mid-air.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll put you {{in charge}} of a team, I think," [...] the Major said, after talking with the foreman, a big, red-haired man, who looked at Arthur with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> thrown <b>back</b> <b>and</b> one eye shut.|$|R
60|$|Alton made {{a gesture}} of understanding, and drained the glass, then let <b>his</b> <b>head</b> fall <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> feebly {{stretched}} out his hand until it touched her fingers. The girl did not move, and his grasp tightened suddenly.|$|R
60|$|Thus he went on, <b>his</b> <b>head</b> turned <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> taking little heed to his footsteps, when, perceiving that he trod upon a smooth, level rock, {{he looked}} forward, {{and found himself}} almost on the utmost verge of a precipice.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly he paused. He {{had caught}} Martin-Roget's feverish gaze fixed excitedly upon him. Whereupon {{he leaned back}} in his chair, threw <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> broke into loud and immoderate laughter.|$|E
60|$|He threw <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and,</b> {{expanding}} {{his chest}} as though he already breathed more freely, nodded to both men, and, walking through the shop, passed {{out into the street}} and disappeared.|$|E
60|$|And at last Theseus {{came up with}} him, {{where he}} lay panting on a slab among the snow, and caught him by the horns, and forced <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> drove the keen sword through his throat.|$|E
60|$|Aghast at {{the light}} manner of her {{throwing}} her <b>head</b> <b>back</b> {{to look at it}} critically, Twemlow still dimly perceives the expediency of throwing <b>his</b> own <b>head</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> does so. Though he no more sees the portrait than if it were in China.|$|R
60|$|He {{was at the}} top of his register, with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> thrown <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> mouth open, {{when the}} door was thrown violently open, and a pair of new-comers marched noisily into the café. It was the Commissary, {{followed}} by the Garde Champêtre.|$|R
60|$|<b>His</b> <b>head,</b> throat, <b>back</b> <b>and</b> breast were black. Beneath he was white. His {{sides were}} reddish-brown. His tail {{was black and}} white, and the longer {{feathers}} of his wings were edged with white. It was Chewink the Towhee, sometimes called Ground Robin.|$|R
60|$|He {{thrust his}} hands in his trouser-pockets and, {{spreading}} his legs wide apart, tilted <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> blew smoke to the ceiling. He was in the same easy position when Ethel arrived home accompanied by Mr. Potter.|$|E
60|$|He made a feint {{of joining}} their hands, put <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> {{shut his eyes}} with an air and a grace that put Charlotte into an ecstasy, and made even Amy laugh, as she quitted the room, blushing.|$|E
6000|$|And Michael did, bumping his flanks against Daughtry's knee; nudging {{his head}} against Daughtry's hand, in {{solicitation}} {{for more of the}} blissful ear-rubbing and tail-twisting. Daughtry caught him by the jowl instead and slowly moved <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> forth as he addressed him: ...|$|E
60|$|Lister {{sat with}} <b>his</b> <b>head</b> thrown <b>back</b> <b>and</b> {{the sun on}} his brown face. His look was calm and frank; his {{careless}} pose brought out the lines of his thin but muscular figure. Vernon felt he was honest; he knew Lister's type.|$|R
60|$|He {{was at the}} top of his register, with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> thrown <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> mouth open, {{when the}} door was thrown violently open, and a pair of new comers marched noisily into the cafe. It was the Commissary, {{followed}} by the Garde Champetre.|$|R
60|$|Virginia stood by, smiling, but {{her breath}} came deeply. Had she done right? Could any good {{come of it}} all? Judge Whipple did not go in at the door--He stood uncompromisingly planted on the threshold, <b>his</b> <b>head</b> flung <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> actual fierceness in his stare.|$|R
