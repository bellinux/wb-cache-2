25|$|As I {{think about}} it, it {{is none of}} these things. They are not {{the reasons for this}} incident, there's a much later point to it all. Happiness. Yes happiness. If <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>out</b> of the way, all the family can get down to their own lives. Mother will {{not have to worry about}} me making my grades, and Daddy will not have to put out more money on me, which would do no more good than it did in high school.|$|E
500|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> ... <b>out</b> {{of sympathy}} with the cry that {{education}} is unnecessary for girls, and that all they require is a few accomplishments. Women have also to live their life - in most cases a harder one than men have. This notion of accomplishments being sufficient for girls is surely a remnant of those barbarous days when women were looked on as the plaything of men.|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{feeling better}} then, but <b>I</b> wished <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> of there, anyway. I couldn't look up yet.|$|R

500|$|Celebrity Marilyn Monroe is {{mentioned}} numerous times throughout the song, including the famous quote [...] "I'm selfish, impatient {{and a little}} insecure. I make mistakes, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>out</b> of control and at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best." [...] However, {{it has never been}} confirmed that Monroe actually said this. Minaj liked the track, as [...] "it spoke to me as a woman. I'm very infatuated with Marilyn Monroe. I had a moment with that song where I was like, 'Oh my God, every woman in this world needs to hear that'. No, we're not perfect. Sometimes, we think, 'What's wrong with us?' We spend so much time criticizing ourselves. I needed to hear that, 'I'm not perfect, but I'm worth it'. It resonated with me. I felt like the world needed to hear it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Clinton {{continued}} to poll high, with a September 2011 Bloomberg News poll finding {{her with a}} 64percent favorable rating, the highest of any political figure in the nation. A third of those polls said that Clinton {{would have been a}} better president than Obama, but when asked the likelihood she would stage a campaign against the president, she said, [...] "It's below zero. One {{of the great things about}} being secretary of state is <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>out</b> of politics. I am not interested in being drawn back into it by anybody." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several vigils {{took place}} to honor Harambe's death. As much as 3,400 people had {{attended}} a candlelight vigil at Hyde Park in London, United Kingdom. Anthony Seta, an activist {{who represents the}} Cincinnati Collective for Animal Rights and Education, organized a vigil at the Cincinnati Zoo to honor the loss of Harambe. In an interview by the press, he emphasized that animals feel and have emotions just like humans do. Seta said, [...] "I'm not here to decide what was right and what was wrong, {{the fact is that}} a gorilla who just celebrated his birthday has been killed. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>out</b> here to speak to remember him, because he can't do it." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was on the}} tip of {{my tongue}} to have given him a sharp answer, for no better reason than this--that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> of temper with him, because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> of temper with myself. But when he owned to being puzzled, a comforting doubt crossed my mind whether any great harm had been done after all. I waited in {{discreet}} silence to hear more.|$|R
60|$|I {{found my}} opportunity, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> walking with her, {{on the day}} after my arrival.|$|R
