The experimental investigation has been performed {{on a range of}} thirty-one (fifteen pure wool, twelve wooVpolyester blends, one wooVrayon blend and three pure linen) suiting and trousering materials varying in mass per unit area from 125 to 258 g/m 2. Low stress mechanical properties measurements <b>of</b> <b>fabric</b> bending, shear and tensile deformations were obtained using the KES (Kawabata Evaluation System) testers.

Following Spivak and Treloar's analysis [12], the bias load-extension and recovery curves were analysed to obtain equivalent shear stress/strain hysteresis curves. The two measures of shear rigidity, one obtained from the KES shear hysteresis curves and the other calculated from the bias extension tests, have been compared for the series <b>of</b> 31 <b>fabrics.</b> Relationships between fabric formability (defined as the product of tensile extensibility under low load and the bending rigidity) and its shear resistance are analysed.

PANI/ Nomex composite fabrics doped by a mixture of protonic acids exhibited higher conduc-tivity than those doped by other single dopants such as camphorsulfonic acid (CSA), p-toluenesulfonic acid (TSA), BSA, SSA, and HCl. The conductivity <b>of</b> PANI/Nomex <b>fabrics</b> especially doped by a mixture of HCl and DBSA was evenly maintained up to 100 °C without depression of mechanical properties of Nomex.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Elevated Freeways {{are perhaps}} the most monstrous type of {{infrastructure}} running through our urban fabric. Although they consume a great deal of resources in energy and land, most of them operate for a single purpose to carry massive amounts of vehicular traffic. The often hidden outcome of this technocracy is the space underneath the freeway which is an uninhabitable environment with a very low land occupation ratio. This urban void is often neglected and associated with negative connotations. The perception of this space is as a destructive and oppressive element in the <b>fabric</b> <b>of</b> the city. The massive structure and the space underneath, however, need to be perceived as a possible resource for public space. The potential of such urban void can be realized by its reclamation and transformation into a place of interaction which interconnects the communities. While architectural interventions beneath the freeway often merely infill the space, this thesis proposes to maximize the inherent openness of the elevated structure in order to repurpose the space underneath into an active place that evokes the spatial and psychological connection of the divided urban neighborhoods. This thesis contemplates a strategy for humanizing the dead spaces below Interstate 5 that has cut through Seattle's International District as a means of re-linking the divided urban neighborhoods. The proposed scheme {{takes the form of a}} series of retail storefronts, artist studios and a sculpture garden that reach out into the adjacent residential area. These programs are the <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> urban <b>fabric</b> blended into the space under the freeway in order to reclaim the giant dead space and transform it into a place for human activities. In other words, the scheme is the blend <b>of</b> urban <b>fabric</b> and freeway structure that seeks to transform these otherwise lost spaces below the freeway into a place for fostering vibrant communities. The resultant design depicts the coexistence of urban system and the system of elevated freeway and such coexistence indicates a way for evolution...|$|R

River cities {{displayed}} an intimate and complex relationship with water, which was never considered as a limit but rather as an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> the urban <b>fabric.</b> However during the industrialization the waterway network lost its monopoly in infrastructure. Ever since the lost of the river in the ‘battle of infrastructure’, river cities have seen a weakening of their functional relationship with water. The riverfront in today’s global cities is a legacy of industrialization and maritime commerce and typically a city’s most contested zone. The original functions of a river and its riverfront become obsolete resulting in the weakening of relationships between {{the city and its}} river. Instead of a communication axe the river transformed in a physical boarder dividing the city and its public realm into pieces.

40|$|The {{ballistic}} {{impact of}} Twaron CT 709 ? plain weave fabrics is studied using an explicit finite element method. Many existing approximations pertaining to woven fabrics cannot adequately represent strain rate-dependent behavior {{exhibited by the}} Twaron fabrics. One-dimensional models based on linear viscoelasticity can account for rate dependency but are limited by the simplifying assumptions on the fabric architecture and stress state. In the current study, a three-dimensional fabric model is developed by treating each individual yarn as a continuum. The yarn behavior is phenomenologically described using a three-dimensional linear viscoelastic constitutive relation. A user subroutine VUMAT for ABAQUS/Explicit? is developed to incorporate the constitutive behavior. By using the newly developed viscoelasticity model, a parametric study is carried out to analyze the effects of various parameters on the impact behavior <b>of</b> the Twaron <b>fabrics,</b> which include projectile shape and mass, gripping conditions, inter-yarn friction, and the number <b>of</b> <b>fabric</b> layers. The study leads to {{the determination of the}} optimal number <b>of</b> <b>fabric</b> layers and the optimized level of inter-yarn friction that are needed to achieve the maximum energy absorption at specified impact speeds. The present study successfully utilizes the combination of 3 D weave architecture and the strain rate dependent material behavior. Majority of the existing work is based either on geometry simplification or assumption of elastic material behavior. Another significant advantage with the present approach is that the mechanical constitutive relation, coded in FORTRAN?, is universal in application. The desired material behavior can be obtained by just varying the material constants in the code. This allows for the <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> this work to any fabric material which exhibits a strain-rate dependent behavior in addition to Twaron?.

In recent years, there has been a shift in the tradition of engineering the river landscape towards a more landscape-friendly perspective. However, the focus still remains usually on nature and recreation, while other functions, like housing, are restricted. In addition, the dikes of the Dutch defense system form strong borders between the urban fabric and the river landscape, allowing little to no interaction between them. The objective is to embrace the natural river processes and use the potentials of inundation and sedimentation as a condition {{for the creation of a}} multifunctional and sustainable landscape. A system of living mounds is integrated in the floodplains in balance with nature, through the use of local materials and sediments and with sustainable infrastructure. Main goal is also to ‘break’ the border of the dike and allow people of the surrounding cities to engage and reconnect with this unique, dynamic nature.
