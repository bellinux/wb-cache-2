5|$|By the {{spectral}} theorem, real symmetric matrices and complex Hermitian matrices have an eigenbasis; that <b>is,</b> <b>every</b> vector is expressible as a linear combination of eigenvectors. In both cases, all eigenvalues are real. This theorem can {{be generalized to}} infinite-dimensional situations related to matrices with infinitely many rows and columns, see below.|$|E

5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>every</b> {{reason to}} believe that a very close {{formation}} of six Wellington aircraft will emerge from a long and heavy attack by enemy fighters with very few if any casualties to its own aircraft. A loose formation is however liable to suffer very heavy casualties under the same conditions.|$|E
5|$|As Boykett argues, any {{one-dimensional}} reversible {{cellular automaton}} {{is equivalent to}} an automaton in rectangular form, in which the cells are offset a half unit at each time step, and in which both the forward and reverse evolution of the automaton have neighborhoods with just two cells, the cells a half unit away in each direction. If a reversible automaton has neighborhoods larger than two cells, it can be simulated by a reversible automaton with smaller neighborhoods and more states per cell, in which each cell of the simulating automaton simulates a contiguous block of cells in the simulated automaton. The two axioms of a semicentral bigroupoid are exactly the conditions required on the forward and reverse transition functions of these two-cell neighborhoods to be the reverses of each other. That <b>is,</b> <b>every</b> semicentral bigroupoid defines a reversible cellular automaton in rectangular form, in which the transition function of the automaton uses the operation to combine the two cells of its neighborhood, and in which the operation similarly defines the reverse dynamics of the automaton. Every one-dimensional reversible cellular automaton is equivalent to one in this form.|$|E
5|$|In 1673, the Duke of York's {{conversion}} to Catholicism became public, and {{he married a}} Catholic princess, Mary of Modena, who was only {{six and a half}} years older than Anne. Charles II had no legitimate children, and so the Duke of York was next in the line of succession, followed by his two surviving daughters from his first marriage, Mary and Anne—as long as he had no son. Over the next ten years, the new Duchess of York had ten children, but all were either stillborn or died in infancy, leaving Mary and Anne second and third in the line of succession after their father. There <b>is</b> <b>every</b> indication that, throughout Anne's early life, she and her stepmother got on well together, and the Duke of York was a conscientious and loving father.|$|E
