5|$|Since recent {{orders of}} new AH-64Ds have been blocked, <b>Israel</b> <b>has</b> pursued {{upgrades}} to its AH-64A fleet. In June 2010, Israel {{decided not to}} upgrade all AH-64As to D configuration, due to funding constraints and lack of U.S. cooperation. In December 2010, the IAF was examining {{the adoption of a}} new missile system as a cheaper and lightweight complement to the Hellfire missile, either the American Hydra 70 or the Canadian CRV7. In 2013, Israeli AH-64As had been receiving a comprehensive upgrade of their avionics and electrical systems. The AH-64As are being upgraded to the AH-64Ai configuration, which is near the AH-64D standard.|$|E
5|$|Wax {{became known}} for his {{activism}} during the Civil Rights Movement. Though some members—particularly those whose families {{had lived in the}} South for generations—had segregationist views, others were prominent in the fight for black civil rights. During Wax's tenure, most of Temple Israel's members moved far from the existing synagogue, and in 1976 the congregation constructed its current building, closer to where most members lived.

5|$|When {{asked how}} he, {{as the son}} of Holocaust survivors, felt about Israel’s {{operation}} in Gaza, Finkelstein replied:It {{has been a long time}} since I felt any emotional connection with the state of Israel, which relentlessly and brutally and inhumanly keeps these vicious, murderous wars. It is a vandal state. There is a Russian writer who once described vandal states as Genghis Khan with a telegraph. Israel is Genghis Khan with a computer. I feel no emotion of affinity with that state. I have some good friends and their families there, and of course I would not want any of them to be hurt. That said, sometimes I feel that <b>Israel</b> <b>has</b> come out of the boils (sic) of the hell, a satanic state.|$|E
5|$|Quneitra {{was founded}} in the Ottoman era as a way station on the caravan route to Damascus and {{subsequently}} became a garrison town of some 20,000 people. In 1946, it {{became part of the}} independent Syrian Republic within the Riff Dimashq Governorate and in 1964 became the capital of the split Quneitra Governorate. On 10 June 1967, {{the last day of the}} Six-Day War, Quneitra came under Israeli control. It was briefly recaptured by Syria during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, but Israel regained control in its subsequent counter-offensive. The city was almost completely destroyed before the Israeli withdrawal in June 1974. Syria had refused to rebuild the city and actively discouraged resettlement in the area. Israel was heavily criticized by the United Nations for the city's destruction, while <b>Israel</b> <b>has</b> also criticized Syria for not rebuilding Quneitra. During the Syrian civil war, Quneitra became a clash point between rebel forces and Syrian Arab Army. , it became controlled by the Syrian opposition.|$|E
5|$|Recently, <b>Israel</b> <b>has</b> {{modified}} {{a number}} of its Merkava main battle tanks with ambulance features {{in order to allow}} rescue operations to take place under heavy fire in urban warfare. The modifications were made following a failed rescue attempt in which Palestinian gunmen killed two soldiers who were providing aid for a Palestinian woman in Rafah. Since M-113 armored personnel carriers and regular up-armored ambulances are not sufficiently protected against anti-tank weapons and improvised explosive devices, it was decided to use the heavily armored Merkava tank. Its rear door enables the evacuation of critically wounded soldiers. Israel did not remove the Merkava's weaponry, claiming that weapons were more effective protection than emblems since Palestinian militants would disregard any symbols of protection and fire at ambulances anyway. For use as ground ambulances and treatment & evacuation vehicles, the United States military currently employs the M113, the M577, the M1133 Stryker Medical Evacuation Vehicle (MEV), and the RG-33 Heavily Armored Ground Ambulance (HAGA) as treatment and evacuation vehicles, with contracts to incorporate the newly designed M2A0 Armored Medical Evacuation Vehicle (AMEV), a variant of the M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicle (formerly known as the ATTV).|$|E
