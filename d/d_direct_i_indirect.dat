40|$|In {{addition}} to water vapor, oxygen, and carbon dioxide, plants release {{a variety of}} volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from their vegetative organs. These volatiles can mediate plant interactions with the environment. For example, they can help plants defend themselves against biotic attackers, or they can act as signals within or between plants, eliciting defensive responses. Since volatiles are so frequently released by plants after herbivore damage, much effort {{has been made to}} elucidate the role of herbivore-induced volatiles. However, undamaged plants of many species emit VOCs too. In order to fully understand the function of VOCs, it is necessary to investigate the function of both induced and constitutive volatile emission.

Girls who maintained a perception of strong social support had less of a decline in physical activity if they also had high self-efficacy. However, girls having high self-efficacy had a greater decline in physical activity if they perceived declines in social support.  Conclusions Randomized controlled trials of physical activity interventions based on social cognitive theory should consider that the influence of girls’ perceptions of social support on their physical activity may differ according to their efficacy beliefs about barriers to physical activity...|$|R

We studied the effect of atmospheric particles on microorganisms living in Bryophytes in situ and in controlled conditions. In situ, we observed a seasonal variation of the different groups. The total biomass of microorganisms and the fungal biomass were significantly higher in the coolest sites in winter. At the end of the experimentation, the biomass of cyanobacteria increased in the polluted sites while the biomass of predators (testate amoeba and ciliates) decreased. In the experimental study, the total microbial biomass and the biomass of cyanobacteria, testate amoebae and fungi decreased significantly in the polluted situations.

We were able to detect a significant association between a non-synonymous coding variant of DBI with anxiety disorders with panic attacks. The rare allele of this polymorphism was more frequent in controls than in patients (OR = 0. 43; 95 % Cl: 0. 19 - 0. 95).

Forecasting fungal responses to environmental changes is necessary for maintaining forest productivity, although our partial understanding of how abiotic and biotic factors affect fungal communities is restricting the predictions. We examined fungal communities of Pinus sylvestris along elevation gradients to check potential responses to climate change-associated factors. Fungi of roots and soils were analysed at a regional scale, by using a high-throughput sequencing approach. Overall soil fungal richness increased with pH, whereas it did not vary with climate. However, when representative sub-assemblages, i. e. Ascomycetes/Basidiomycetes, and families were analysed, they differentially answered to climatic and edaphic variables. This response was dependent on where they settled, i. e. soil versus roots, and/or on their lifestyle, i. e. mycorrhizal or not, suggesting different potential functional weights within the community. Our results revealed a highly compartmentalized and contrasted response of fungal communities in forest soils. The different response of fungal sub-assemblages indicated a range of possible selective <b>direct</b> and <b>indirect</b> (<b>i.</b> e. via host) impacts of climatic variations on these communities, of unknown functional consequences, that helps in understanding potential fungal responses under future global change scenarios...|$|R

40|$|Wetlands {{are among}} the most {{important}} ecosystems on Earth both in terms of productivity and biodiversity, but also as a source of the greenhouse gas CH 4. Microbial processes catalyzing nutrient recycling and CH 4 production are controlled by sediment physico-chemistry, which is in turn affected by plant activity and the foraging behaviour of herbivores. We performed field and laboratory experiments to evaluate the direct effect of herbivores on soil microbial activity and their indirect effects as the consequence of reduced macrophyte density, using migratory Bewick’s swans (Cygnus columbianus bewickii Yarrell) feeding on fennel pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus L.) tubers as a model system. A controlled foraging experiment using field enclosures indicated that swan bioturbation decreases CH 4 production, through a decrease in the activity of methanogenic Archaea and an increased rate of CH 4 oxidation in the bioturbated sediment. We also found a positive correlation between tuber density (a surrogate of plant density during the previous growth season) and CH 4 production activity. A laboratory experiment showed that sediment sterilization enhances pondweed growth, probably due to elimination of the negative effects of microbial activity on plant growth. In summary, the bioturbation caused by swan grazing modulates CH 4 cycling by means of both <b>direct</b> and <b>indirect</b> (<b>i.</b> e. plant-mediated) effects with potential consequences for CH 4 emission from wetland systems. <br /...|$|R

Chemical oxidation, biodegradation, and photodegradation {{have been identified as}} potential mechanisms for the transformation of these compounds. While some studies have investigated the photodegradation of steroid hormones under conditions relevant for engineered systems, few studies have examined the importance of photolysis on the transformation of steroid hormones under environmentally relevant conditions. Consequently, the objectives of this study were to determine the potential for <b>direct</b> and <b>indirect</b> (<b>i.</b> e., by humic acid and nitrate) photolysis of 17 β-estradiol, testosterone and progesterone by light in the UVA range (305 to 410 nm) in a phosphate buffered media at pH 5. 5.

The photolysis was modeled using pseudo first-order reaction kinetics and half-lives were found to be in the range from 3 to 6 hours, {{depending on the type of}} hormone and solution composition. Both testosterone and progesterone were directly photolyzed. In the presence of humic acid (HA), testosterone was photolyzed at increased rates, while HA did not influence the photolysis of progesterone. 17 β-estradiol was only photolyzed (indirectly) in the presence of HA.

Clinical studies have demonstrated that a prophylactic HPV vaccine can prevent infection, genital warts, and the precancerous lesions that lead to cervical cancer. Given the absence of data on the long-term effectiveness of HPV vaccination, a number of mathematical models have been developed to provide insight to policy makers by projecting the long-term epidemiologic and economic consequences of vaccination and evaluate alternative vaccination policies. This paper reviews the state of these models. Three types of HPV mathematical models {{have been reported in the}} literature: cohort, population dynamic, and hybrid. All have demonstrated that vaccination can significantly reduce the incidence of cervical cancer in the long term. However, only the cohort and hybrid models have evaluated the cost-effectiveness of vaccination strategies for preventing cervical cancer.

We also wanted to explore the relationship between functional status and specific dimensions of support (i. e. self-esteem, appraisal, belonging, and tangible support). Functional status (psychological disability, physical disability, pain) was assessed with the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales (AIMS). Multiple regression suggested that exposure to stressors and low self-esteem support were associated with increased disability along all AIMS dimensions; appraisal support was not correlated with any AIMS score. Also, physical disability was associated with being older and having less tangible support (R 2 = 0. 17); psychological disability with being younger, caucasian, and having less belonging support (R 2 = 0. 47); and pain with being younger, caucasian and having less education (R 2 = 0. 15). In no instance was there empirical support for the buffering model. Self-esteem appeared to be the most, and appraisal the least, consistent social support dimension when predicting functional status. While exposure to stressors negatively affected all AIMS dimensions, its impact was greatest with respect to psychological disability. We conclude that social support had a direct, rather than indirect, impact on functional status.
