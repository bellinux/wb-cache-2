5|$|Jones {{put an end}} to {{speculation}} linking {{him with}} a move to Tottenham Hotspur by signing a 4 and a half-year contract at the Stadium of Light on 27 January 2009. After a spell of six games without a goal, Jones scored against Manchester United in a 2–1 defeat. On 22 August Jones contributed to Sunderland's 2–1 victory over Blackburn Rovers scoring two goals. Jones again contributed with two goals for Sunderland when they were at home to Wolves on 27 September, in a 5–2 win. One goal being the highlight of the game, curling the ball home from 22yards out. Jones scored his fifth goal of the season with a <b>header</b> against Manchester United, outjumping Ben Foster to give Sunderland a 2–1 lead but in the dying moments of the match at Old Trafford, Patrice Evra's shot was deflected in for an own-goal by Anton Ferdinand to level it up and end the match as a 2–2 draw. Jones scored his sixth goal of the season with a close-range <b>header</b> against Manchester City which City won 4–3. On 6 February, Jones scored his seventh goal of the season with another <b>header</b> against Wigan Athletic which ended up 1–1 at the Stadium of Light. Jones then scored again against Manchester City bringing his tally to eight, with a spectacular <b>header</b> at the Stadium of Light, which ended up 1–1. He also opened the scoring against Wolves {{on the final day of}} the season, netting after a strike deflected off Jody Craddock after 8 minutes, but Wolves would go on to win 2–1.|$|E
5|$|São Paulo's {{pressure}} {{resulted in}} them {{taking the lead}} in the 27th minute. A chipped pass from Aloísio to Mineiro found the midfielder in space who put the ball beyond Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina to give the Brazilians a 1–0 lead. It was the first goal Liverpool had conceded in over 1,041 minutes of play. Immediately afterwards, Liverpool had a corner, which almost resulted in a goal. Xabi Alonso took the corner which found García, but his shot hit the woodwork. Liverpool had another chance 30 minutes into the match, but again he failed to score with a <b>header.</b> Gerrard had a chance to equalise five minutes later, but he put his shot wide after Harry Kewell had passed him the ball. Liverpool continued to create chances and in the 39th minute García saw his <b>header</b> into the far corner saved by São Paulo goalkeeper Rogério Ceni. From the resulting corner Liverpool defender Sami Hyypiä shot straight at Ceni. He had another chance late in the first half, but his <b>header</b> was saved by Ceni.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the start}} of extra time Cardiff made their first {{substitution}} of the match, goalscorer Mason was replaced by Filip Kiss. Liverpool had the first chance to score in extra time, but Suárez's <b>header</b> was cleared off the line by Andrew Taylor. Cardiff appeared to be playing for a penalty shoot-out, as they were positioning {{the majority of their}} team behind the ball and in front of their goal. Cardiff captain Hudson was replaced in the 98th minute by Anthony Gerrard after suffering from cramp. Liverpool had another chance in the 101st minute, when a pass by Gerrard was cleared for a corner kick by Taylor. The resulting corner was met by Carroll, but his <b>header</b> was wide of the Cardiff goal. Immediately after the attack Carroll was replaced by Dirk Kuyt. Just {{before the end of the}} first half of extra time Liverpool had another chance. Bellamy went past two men down the left hand side of the pitch before exchanging passes with Kuyt, however his subsequent shot went wide.|$|E

5|$|In the 66thminute, Alex Ferguson {{completed}} his attacking quartet by bringing Dimitar Berbatov on {{in place of}} Park. Ronaldo was penalised for a high elbow when challenging for a <b>header</b> with Puyol a minute later, before Rooney forced another corner off Piqué in the 69thminute. However, United's numbers up front in search of another goal left them wanting in defence; a weak clearance from Van der Sar was cut out by Puyol who played the ball to Eto'o {{on the right side}} of the penalty area. The ball broke to Xavi on the edge of the area, who crossed for Messi to send a looping <b>header</b> over the United goalkeeper and into the far side of the goal for a two-goal lead. Immediately after the goal, Henry was replaced by Seydou Keita, allowing Barcelona to adopt a more defensive stance.|$|E
