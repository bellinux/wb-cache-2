5|$|As {{the initial}} {{usage of the}} Cunard Building was mixed, {{there are a variety}} of {{features}} within the building that reflect the original purposes of different areas within. Initially, Cunard's administration facilities were located on the upper floors and due to the necessity for large amounts of light in the design facilities, these rooms where developed to include both toplights in the roof and also large windows to maximise the amount of natural light. Another feature are the high quality ornate fittings that are present in what would have been the former first class passenger lounge, which is located on the first floor.

5|$|Following {{a stroke}} {{at a family}} reunion in Tallahassee, Florida, in September 1989, Roddenberry's health {{declined}} further, ultimately requiring him to use a wheelchair. Following another stroke in early October 1991, his right arm was paralyzed, causing him ongoing pain as the muscles began to atrophy.

He arrived in the building with his staff, and began to travel up to the ninth floor in the elevator. As they reached the <b>fifth</b> <b>floor,</b> he began struggling for breath, and was wheeled into the doctor's office, where he was reclined and a nurse administered oxygen. Barrett was sent for. Upon her arrival, she held Roddenberry while encouraging him to breathe. He had a cardiopulmonary arrest, and {{he died in the}} doctor's office shortly afterwards.

5|$|Among Gaudí's {{largest and}} most {{striking}} works is the Casa Batlló (1904–1906). Commissioned by Josep Batlló i Casanovas to renovate an existing building erected in 1875 by Emili Sala Cortés, Gaudí focused on the façade, the main floor, the patio and the roof, and built a <b>fifth</b> <b>floor</b> for the staff. For this project he was assisted by his aides Domènec Sugrañes, Joan Rubió and Josep Canaleta. The facade is of Montjuïc sandstone cut to create warped ruled surfaces; the columns are bone-shaped with vegetable decoration. Gaudí kept the rectangular shape of the old building's balconies—with iron railings {{in the shape of}} masks—giving the rest of the facade an ascending undulating form. He also faced the facade with ceramic fragments of various colours ("trencadís"), which Gaudí obtained from the waste material of the Pelegrí glass works. The interior courtyard is roofed by a skylight supported by an iron structure {{in the shape of a}} double T, which rests on a series of catenary aches. The helicoidal chimneys are a notable feature of the roof, topped with conical caps, covered in clear glass in the centre and ceramics at the top, and surmounted by clear glass balls filled with sand of different colours. The facade culminates in catenary vaults covered with two layers of brick and faced with glazed ceramic tiles in the form of scales (in shades of yellow, green and blue), which resemble a dragon's back; on the left side is a cylindrical turret with anagrams of Jesus, Mary and Joseph, and with Gaudí's four-armed cross.|$|E

Safronov was alive immediately after the fall, but at least a half-hour passed before help arrived.
