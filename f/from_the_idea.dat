5|$|Kohli {{conceived}} Teri Meri Kahaani <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of soulmates, {{showing the}} strength of love beyond generations by having the same two actors portray all three couples without using a reincarnation theme. He co-wrote the film with Robin Bhatt. Muneesh Sappel created three sets for depicting the different time periods, requiring months of research and detailed designs. Principal photography began in Mumbai in mid-2011 and later moved to London, where it was primarily shot at the Jublee Campus of the University of Nottingham and Stratford-upon-Avon.|$|E
5|$|Geneforge stemmed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of {{creating}} a horde of creatures {{and the ability to}} care for those creatures or send them to their deaths. The choice was to be made by the player. From this point, Vogel considered who would be able to gain such powers, how they would control them and how these creatures would be treated. The game was developed with the intention of giving players choices; which factions to side with, how non-Shaper human outsiders are treated and whether to pursue goals through combat or diplomacy. Unlike most role-playing games, Geneforge was designed so that {{it would be possible to}} complete the game without using violence. Vogel cited , , Deus Ex and EverQuest as influences.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, he {{identified}} the hieroglyphic script on the Rosetta stone as being {{written in a}} mixture of ideograms and phonetic signs, just as Young had argued for Demotic. He reasoned that if the script was entirely ideographic the hieroglyphic text would require as many separate signs as there were separate words in the Greek text. But there were in fact fewer, suggesting that the script mixed ideographic and phonetic signs. This realization finally made it possible for him to detach himself <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that the different scripts had to be either fully ideographic or fully phonetic, and he recognized it as being much more complex mixture of sign types. This realization gave him a distinct advantage.|$|E

5|$|Lynch {{conceived}} South of Nowhere <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of a teenager's {{coming out}} after hearing that his friend's son {{had come out}} to his parents. Lynch pitched the premise to The N and was commissioned to write the pilot. After the casting process was complete, the episode was filmed in October 2004, but when the show was picked up for a full season, Lynch decided to recast many of the characters and the pilot was shot again in July 2005 with the new cast. The premiere of the episode was promoted with branded MetroCards that were handed out to teenagers in Manhattan. Generally, critics reviewed the pilot positively, particularly commending its treatment of current social issues; however, some critics found the show's introduction of these issues to be forced and inauthentic.|$|E
5|$|The game's setting stemmed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> {{of players}} {{being able to}} create and control a group of obedient creatures. The Shapers {{and the world of}} Geneforge were the result of Vogel imagining how would a being possess such power and how would they use it. The game's setting, a mixture of science fiction and fantasy, differs from the pure science fiction setting the game had been envisioned as. Vogel had {{difficulties}} balancing gameplay with the powerful directed-energy weapons players would expect to use in a science fiction game. Sales exceeded the developer's expectations, despite fears that the departure from Spiderweb's Avernum series would deter players. Geneforge received a positive reception from reviewers, despite the quality of the graphics being rated as poor and the game containing one piece of music, the title theme. The plot and setting were praised by reviewers for uniqueness and detail.|$|E
5|$|The major {{characteristic}} of Prester John tales {{from this period}} is the king's portrayal not as an invincible hero, but merely one of many adversaries defeated by the Mongols. But as the Mongol Empire collapsed, Europeans began to shift away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that Prester John had ever really been a Central Asian king. At any rate they had little hope of finding him there, as travel in the region became dangerous without the security the Empire had provided. In works such as The Travels of Sir John Mandeville and Historia Trium Regum by John of Hildesheim, Prester John's domain tends to regain its fantastic aspects and finds itself located not on the steppes of Central Asia, but back in India proper, or some other exotic locale. Wolfram von Eschenbach tied the history of Prester John to the Holy Grail legend in his poem Parzival, in which the Prester {{is the son of}} the Grail maiden and the Saracen knight Feirefiz.|$|E

25|$|The last {{objection}} that {{he makes}} draws on the widely discussed problem of evil. He argues that all the daily unnecessary suffering that goes on everywhere within the world is yet another factor that pulls away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that God is an 'omnipotent' 'benevolent' being.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> overall <b>idea</b> of cenobitic monasticism {{cannot be}} traced to a single source, however, but rather {{developed}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> and work of numerous groups, including the aforementioned Melitians, Manichaeans, Elkasites, Buddhists and Pachomians.|$|R

25|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, {{scientific}} racism developed {{the theory of}} Aryanism, holding that Europeans ("Aryans") were an innately superior branch of humanity , {{responsible for most of}} its greatest achievements. Aryanism was derived <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that the original speakers of the Indo-European languages constituted a distinctive race or subrace of the larger Caucasian race.|$|E
25|$|Lesbians often attract media attention, {{particularly}} {{in relation to}} feminism, love and sexual relationships, marriage and parenting. Some writers who have asserted this trend can lead to exploitative and unjustified plot devices. The lack of lesbian portrayal in the media can also influence the consumer's view of the particular sexuality. Common tropes of lesbians in the media include butch or femme lesbians and lesbian parents. The word Butch lesbian comes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of a lesbian expressing themselves as masculine by dressing masculine, behaving masculinely, or liking things that are deemed masculine, while the word femme lesbian comes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of a lesbian expressing themselves as feminine by dressing feminine, behaving femininely, or liking things that are deemed feminine. In the media, lesbian marriage and parenting are depicted in shows such as the live action television show The Fosters and even the children's cartoon Steven Universe.|$|E
25|$|Why {{lesbianism}} is {{not explicitly}} prohibited in the Bible {{has become a}} matter of interpretation. Suggestions range <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that in ancient times only acts in which men emitted semen were defined as sexual, to the assumption that in biblical times sexual attraction between women did not exist, to the belief that religious rules that apply to men automatically apply to women.|$|E

25|$|One major {{objective}} of Barth is {{to recover the}} doctrine of the Trinity in theology from its putative loss in liberalism. His argument follows <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that God is the object of God's own self-knowledge, and revelation in the Bible means the self-unveiling to humanity of the God who cannot be discovered by humanity simply through its own intuition.|$|E
25|$|Rousseau portrays Geneva in a {{very romantic}} and {{positive}} light, where people are productive, happy and hard at work, but he also recognizes the extreme wealth and poverty in the city. He first tries to sway Geneva away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of theatre by suggesting {{that it is not}} economically feasible, and that the population is too low to support a theatre.|$|E
25|$|The name {{organelle}} comes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> {{that these}} structures {{are parts of}} cells, as organs are to the body, hence organelle, the suffix -elle being a diminutive. Organelles are identified by microscopy, and can also be purified by cell fractionation. There are many types of organelles, particularly in eukaryotic cells. While prokaryotes do not possess organelles per se, some do contain protein-based bacterial microcompartments, which are thought to act as primitive organelles.|$|E

25|$|Although Thompson {{acknowledges}} {{similarities between}} African and European cool in shared notions of self-control and imperturbability, {{he finds the}} cultural value of cool in Africa which influenced the African diaspora {{to be different from}} that held by Europeans, who use the term primarily as the ability to remain calm under stress. According to Thompson, there is significant weight, meaning and spirituality attached to cool in traditional African cultures, something which, Thompson argues, is absent <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> in a Western context.|$|E

The fight was believed to stem <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that Batista considered himself {{to be better than}} the rest of the roster due to his main event status and relatively quick climb to achieve it. It was said that wrestlers backstage were praising Booker for speaking his mind to Batista about his attitude.|$|E
