Tables are an X and Y collection of cells, like a sheet, but extend only to the limits of the data they hold. Each section of data, or output from formulas, can be combined into an existing table, or placed into a new table. Tables can be collected by the user onto single or multiple canvases. Whereas a typical <b>Excel</b> <b>sheet</b> has data strewn across it, a Numbers canvas could build the same output through smaller individual tables encompassing the same data.|$|E
