The instrument was large, 36 inches (914 mm) across and it was normally mounted on a stand which placed the sighting telescope between 5 and 6 ft. high. It weighed about 200 lb (90 kg) and the accessories and cases weighed as much again. It travelled around Britain for over sixty years, in its own sprung carriage, to locations where it was hauled up mountains, church towers and even scaffolded steeples. The horizontal circular scale was divided very accurately with divisions at 15 minute (of arc) intervals using one of Ramden's own dividing engines; the marks on the 36 inch <b>diameter</b> <b>scale</b> would be about 1/6 inch (4 mm) apart. The position of the telescope could therefore be read to the nearest quarter of a degree by eye but the exact position between the divisions was read {{with the aid of}} micrometer microscopes fitted with adjustable cross wires in the focal plane, as shown. The threads of the screws were such that fifteen full turns moved from one scale mark to the next, i.e. 15 minutes, and since the scale on the adjusting knob allowed one sixtieth of a turn to be measured the resulting accuracy was within one arc second.|$|E

40|$|A {{simulation}} {{framework that}} couples atomistic electronic structures to Boltzmann transport formalism is developed {{and applied to}} calculate the transport characteristics of thin silicon nanowires (NWs) up to 12 nm in diameter. The sp 3 d 5 s*-spin-orbit-coupled atomistic tight-binding (TB) model {{is used for the}} electronic structure calculation. Linearized Boltzmann transport theory is applied, including carrier scattering by phonons, surface roughness (SRS), and impurities. We present a comprehensive investigation of the low-field mobility in silicon NWs considering: i) n- and p-type NWs, ii) [100], [110], and [111] transport orientations, and iii) diameters from D= 12 nm (electronically almost bulk-like) down to D= 3 nm (ultra-scaled). The simulation results display strong variations in the characteristics of the different NW types. For n-type NWs, phonon scattering and SRS become stronger as the diameter is reduced and drastically degrade the mobility by up to an order of magnitude depending on the orientation. For the [111] and [110] p-type NWs, on the other hand, large mobility enhancements (of the order of ~ 4 X) can be achieved as the <b>diameter</b> <b>scales</b> down to D= 3 nm.

40|$|Bark {{thickness}} is ecologically crucial, affecting functions from {{fire protection}} to photosynthesis. Bark thickness scales predictably with stem diameter, {{but there is}} little consensus on whether this scaling is a passive consequence of growth or an important adaptive phenomenon requiring explanation. With a comparative study across 913 species, we test the expectation that, if bark thickness- stem <b>diameter</b> <b>scaling</b> is adaptive, {{it should be possible to}} find ecological situations in which scaling is predictably altered, in this case between species with different types and deployments of phloem. 'Dicots' with successive cambia and monocots, which have phloem-free bark, had predictably thinner inner (mostly living) bark than plants with single cambia. Lianas, which supply large leaf areas with limited stem area, had much thicker inner bark than self-supporting plants. Gymnosperms had thicker outer bark than angiosperms. Inner bark probably scales with plant metabolic demands, for example with leaf area. Outer bark <b>scales</b> with stem <b>diameter</b> less predictably, probably reflecting diverse adaptive factors; for example, it tends to be thicker in fire-prone species and very thin when bark photosynthesis is favored.

The model test indicated that an increase of fracture scale increased the velocity and amplitude of the primary wave by about 2 %. When the shear wave propagated parallel to the fracture, the velocity of the fast shear wave hardly changed, while the velocity of slow shear wave increased by 2.6 % with increasing fracture scale.

Carbon sequestration is a multiscale problem, involving length scales over four orders of magnitude–from injection well <b>diameter</b> <b>scale</b> to the aquifer scale. XFEM is introduced to accurately approximate near injection well pressure behaviour with elements significantly larger than the injection well diameter.

Near well enrichment functions are presented along with the solution procedure for the coupled problem. Two examples are presented; in the first, CO 2 injection into a perfectly horizontal aquifer is model with both XFEM and FEM-based methods.

The ChemChar gasification system uses a granular carbonaceous char matrix to immobilize wastes and feed them into the gasifier. In the gasifier wastes are subjected to high temperature reducing conditions, which destroy the organic constituents and immobilize radionuclides on the regenerated char. Only about 10 percent of the char is consumed on each pass through the gasifier, and the regenerated char can be used to treat additional wastes.

The amount the feathers deflect during flight is dependent upon the flexural stiffness of the rachises. By quantifying scaling relationships between body mass and feather linear dimensions in a large data set of living birds, we show that both feather length and feather <b>diameter</b> <b>scale</b> much closer to predictions for geometric similarity than they do to elastic similarity. Scaling allometry also indicates that the primary {{feathers of}} larger birds are relatively shorter and their rachises relatively narrower, compared to those of smaller birds.

Due to their ultra-thin and high flexible properties, {{the surfaces of}} these membrane mirrors are susceptible to temperature variations. Therefore adaptive shape control of the mirror is essential to maintain the surface precision and to ensure its working performance. However, researches on modeling and control of membrane mirrors under thermal loads are sparse in open literatures. A 0.2 m <b>diameter</b> <b>scale</b> model of a polyimide membrane mirror is developed in this study. Three Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) patches are laminated on the non-reflective side of the membrane mirror to serve as in-plane actuators. A new mathematical model of the piezoelectric actuated membrane mirror in multiple fields, (i.e., thermal, mechanical, and electrical field) is established, with which dynamic and static behaviors of the mirror can be analyzed. A closed-loop membrane mirror shape control system is set up and a surface shape control method based on an influence function matrix of the mirror is then investigated. Several experiments including surface displacement tracking and thermal deformation alleviation are performed. The deviations range from 15 μm to 20 μm are eliminated within 0.1 s and the residual deformation is controlled to micron level, which demonstrates {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed membrane shape control strategy and shows a satisfactory real-time performance.

Linearized Boltzmann transport theory is applied, including phonon and surface roughness scattering (SRS) mechanisms, for the mobility calculation. We find that large mobility enhancements (of the order of 4 X) can be achieved as the diameter of the [110] and even more that of the [111] NWs scales down to D= 3 nm.

40|$|Piping {{structures}} are generally subjected to high dynamic loading due to multiphase forces. In particular subsea {{structures are}} very vulnerable as large flexibility {{is required to}} cope for instance with thermal stresses. The forces due to multiphase flow are characterized by a broadband spectrum with high amplitudes. These forces differ with flow regimes and are still difficult to predict. Therefore a joint industry project was setup to perform both large scale (6 ”) flow tests and to qualify CFD procedures and settings to calculate these forces with sufficient accuracy. A 1. 5 D radius bend was fully equipped with force rings (2 * 8), piezo strain gauges, classic strain gauges, dynamic pressure sensors (11) and both upstream and downstream a resistance tomography and transparent section. Both single phase (gas and liquid) as well as multiphase conditions were measured with maximum gas velocities up to 40 m/s and liquid velocities up to 4 m/s. For the low to mid gas fractions, the amplitude of the forces agree with literature, indicating no large diameter scaling effects. At very low liquid fractions, the comparison with literature starts to deviate. The amplitude of the forces scale well with the pressure at low liquid fraction whereas the mixture momentum is dominant at higher liquid fractions. The frequency spectrum {{is characterized by a}} top-hat shape of the PSD. The center frequency corresponds to the wave and slug frequencies from literature, although potentially a void wave interaction might be present at very low liquid fractions. The main slope of the PSD (m 2) is in line with the larger diameter measurements from literature, although a clear relation at very low gas fraction is measured which is not covered in literature.

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 A {{number of}} {{investigators}} have proposed equations {{to predict the}} permeability of porous media.

Presently the pore size distributions of agricultural soils are most commonly obtained from soil water release curves. The pressure scale is converted into an equivalent pore <b>diameter</b> <b>scale</b> by means of the pressure of displacement equation. This method is time consuming. The study reported in this thesis was initiated to (1) use a mercury intrusion method to obtain pore size distributions of porous materials similar to agricultural soils, (2) use the pore size distributions thus obtained with existing equations to calculate intrinsic permeability and (3) compare the calculated permeability values with measured values for a range of particle size distributions. The permeabilities and the pore size distributions of 54 systematically selected particle size classes of glass beads and crushed quartz sand were measured. The particle size classes ranged from 44 to 246 microns in diameter. The pore size distributions were evaluated and used in Marshall's proposed permeability prediction equation. The measured permeabilities did not agree with the calculated values until a correction factor which {{is a function of the}} pore diameter was used. It is apparent that the pressure of displacement equation measures only an effective pore dimension. Permeability prediction equations require the evaluation of an effective hydraulic dimension. These two dimensions are different and are influenced by the geometry of the pore aperture. A necessary correction factor has been developed which accounts for the difference between the measured and hydraulic dimension when the mercury intrusion technique is used to measure pore size distributions.
