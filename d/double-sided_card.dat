5000|$|Note: Innistrad boosters, first {{released}} in September 2011, contain {{a slightly different}} proportion of cards due {{to the introduction of}} double-faced cards. In Innistrad boosters one of the 10 commons is replaced by a <b>double-sided</b> <b>card.</b> This <b>double-sided</b> <b>card</b> can be of any rarity and either regular or foil, with the likelihood of a specific card being present depending on its rarity. Also, there is roughly a 3/4 chance that the basic land will be replaced by a checklist. Finally, non-double-sided foil cards may still be present, probably still in roughly 1/4 of the boosters.|$|E

50|$|Audience {{members were}} each given their own <b>double-sided</b> <b>cards.</b> The {{front of each}} card {{followed}} the pattern of those used by the contestants. When a contestant answered a question correctly and filled in a number, audience members could mark it off on their cards as well. Any member who reached {{the goal of a}} round before the contestants won $10; this payout could be collected in one, two, or all three rounds, for a maximum of $30.|$|R
50|$|The game {{is played}} {{with the use of}} four <b>double-sided</b> <b>cards</b> {{presenting}} system/site locations (Tatooine, Bespin, Hoth and Endor) revealed one after the other, each turn taking place on different location. The main purpose of the game is control as many locations as possible. Control over a location is checked by tallying up total power of characters. The player with the greater total is considered 'in control' of a location. The game is won by one of the players when he or she control the majority of locations of the game.|$|R
5000|$|The single was {{released}} in four parts: CD part 1 contains a poster, with the [...] "Virtual XI Fixture List 1998" [...] {{on one side and}} the band posing in Maiden football gear with some of their favourite players on the other side. CD part 2 contains three <b>double-sided</b> <b>cards</b> with the musicians posing in Maiden football gear and also has a shortened version of [...] "The Angel and the Gambler". The third was a 7" [...] picture disc and the fourth was a CD maxi-single with both b-side live tracks on it. The picture disc and maxi-single both had the edited version of the title track.|$|R
5000|$|The game {{involves}} 84 cards: 40 [...] "Hijinks" [...] cards, 40 [...] "Havok" [...] <b>cards,</b> and 4 <b>double-sided</b> Dragon <b>cards</b> (the Amber dragon, the Obsidian dragon, the Pearl dragon and the Ruby dragon). Other accessories are available, such as play {{mats and}} affinity tokens, {{but are not}} required for gameplay.|$|R
2500|$|Magnétophone's albums, 7"s and 12"s are {{visually}} impressive objects. The band state, [...] "we want our sleeves {{to be equally}} as exciting as the music they represent", and to this end, they have presented their music {{in a variety of}} quality art 'packages'. The very first single, 'You Should Write Music' consisted of a red audiophile-weight vinyl 7", with a matching textured sleeve and a single white sticker, containing the band name and track titles. Their work with V23's design-icon Vaughan Oliver and photographer/designer Chris Bigg has produced some unique sleeves, from the three-quarter cut-sleeved, double vinyl lp of 'I Guess Sometimes...', to the laser cut aluminium turntable pillar-disc that accompanied the CD version of the same LP, to the high quality cardboard, gate-folding digipack of 'The Man Who Ate The Man' which contained eight small <b>double-sided</b> <b>cards,</b> printed with domestic interior images and cryptic phrases.|$|R
40|$|The first {{principle}} {{is that you}} must not fool yourself— {{and you are the}} easiest person to fool. So {{you have to be very}} careful about that. After you’ve not fooled yourself, it’s easy not to fool other scientists. —Richard Feynman, 1974. That intuition can lead us astray is obvious and well-known, but watch for examples of people relying on intuition to solve a problem and you will see it everywhere. When people talk of a hunch or gut feeling, they’re talking about using their intuition. I have done a seismic inversion and have a Poisson’s ratio attribute volume. My hypothesis is that low Poisson’s ratio means gas. I have some wells, represented by <b>double-sided</b> <b>cards</b> in Figure 1, to calibrate to. The game is to answer this question: Which cards do I need to turn over to prove the hypothesis that all the cards with low PR on one side have gas on the other? Take a moment to look at the four cards an...|$|R
5000|$|Shadows over Innistrad {{has five}} main mechanics. The Madness mechanic, {{returning}} from Time Spiral, allows {{a player to}} cast a card for its madness cost instead of being discarded. This is shown on the card [...] Delirium counts the number of different card types in a player's graveyard. If that player has four or more card types among cards in their graveyard (e.g. creature, instant, sorcery, land), delirium is 'turned on', and will activate a specific effect on that card, like as on the card [...] Investigate is a keyword that creates a Clue artifact token that you may pay 2 generic mana and sacrifice it to draw a card. One card with Investigate is [...] The Transform mechanic, such as on the card [...] appears on <b>double-sided</b> <b>cards.</b> The cards come into play firstly in the front half, indicated by a sun symbol in the top left of the card, and once a certain effect is triggered or a flip ability activated the card will transform by flipping over into the 'night' mode, indicated by a moon symbol in the top left. Some cards can transform again and some are stuck in their night phase. Skulk is an evasion ability that appears on creature cards {{which means that they}} can't be blocked by creatures with greater power. [...] is a card with the skulk ability.|$|R
50|$|The game can be {{impacted}} by the <b>double-sided</b> dragon <b>cards</b> used by players. Epic Slant Press released several dragon cards {{not included in the}} base game. These additional cards include various cards of the Crystal Dragon, which has the ability to change elemental affinity, allowing for the player to capitalize on the bonuses found on all Hijinks cards.Such promotional cards were given out at various conventions, including Gen Con and Dragon Con, as well as to those who signed up for the company's newsletter.|$|R
50|$|Goth: The Game of Horror Trivia, {{also known}} as Goth: A Game of Pure Gothic Horror, is a board game where {{progress}} is determined by a player's ability to answer horror-related trivia and popular culture questions. The game was invented by Matthew Nuccio, designed and developed by Design Edge Inc, and manufactured in 2002 by McNutty Games. The board is a graveyard with four plots representing {{each of the four}} player's starting points. It contains 200 <b>double-sided</b> trivia <b>cards</b> with five questions per side, providing a total of 2,000 questions. A die, four playing pieces, and 52 tombstones are included.|$|R
40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{examined the}} influence of a second rule on the pattern of card selections on Wason's selection task. In Experiment 1 participants received a version of the task with a single test rule or one of two versions of the task with the same original test rule together with a second rule. The probability of q was manipulated in the two-rules conditions by varying the size of the antecedent set in the second rule. The results showed a significant suppression of q card and not-p card selections in the alternative-rule conditions, but no difference as a function of antecedent set size. In Experiment 2 the size of the antecendent set in the two-rules conditions was manipulated using the context of a computer printing <b>double-sided</b> <b>cards.</b> The results showed a significant reduction of q card selections in the two-rules conditions, but no effect of p set size. In Experiment 3 the scenario accompanying the rule was manipulated, and it specified a single alternative antecedent or a number of alternative antecedents. The q card selection rates were not affected by the scenario manipulation but again were suppressed by the presence of a second rule. Our results suggest that people make inferences about the unseen side of the cards when engaging with the task and that these inferences are systematically influenced by the presence of a second rule, but are not influenced by the probabilistic characteristics of this rule. These findings are discussed in the context of decision theoretic views of selection task performance (Oaksford & Chater, 1994) ...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>double-sided</b> Dragon <b>cards</b> {{included}} with the base game have one side (the [...] "Ready" [...] side) in which the dragon can perform one of two special abilities. These abilities are specific to that particular dragon (e.g. the Amber dragon has skills in trading while the Ruby dragon excels at stealing). Upon using one of these abilities, the dragon becomes tired and must be flipped over to the [...] "Tired" [...] side. While on this side, none of the dragon's abilities may be used. Only by fulfilling the condition listed on that side (e.g. the Obsidian dragon must successfully break a treasure) may the dragon be flipped back to the [...] "Ready" [...] side.|$|R
50|$|The Simple System is a card based Tabletop {{role-playing}} game {{system that}} was funded using Kickstarter in May 2014. The Simple System uses reusable <b>double-sided</b> Character <b>Cards</b> for each player (up to 5 players), Skill Cards and Item Cards with complete rule text to represent commonly used skills, weapons and other items. In addition Life and Dying Cards shows the Health Status of each player. The dice used in other Tabletop roleplaying games are swapped for a intriguing Resolution Deck that not only indicates success and failure of any attempted action, but also indicates directions, damage and turn order when needed. The Simple System includes cards (Hero, Story, and Complication Cards) for the Game Master to reward and punish players for interesting choices and unlucky resolutions.|$|R

Our baseline is a telemetry system recently developed at Eglin AFB to support 16 analog input channels, signal conditioning and encoding for Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) using Commercial Off-the- Shelf (COTS) ICs. The data acquisition {{portion of the}} system occupies three <b>double-sided,</b> round circuit <b>cards,</b> each 2. 3 " in diameter.
