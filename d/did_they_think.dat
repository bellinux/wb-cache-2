6000|$|We {{had left}} Anscombe and Heda seated {{side by side}} on the stoep. They were still there, but much closer together. In fact his arms were round her, and they were kissing each other in a remarkably whole-hearted way. About this there could be no mistake, since the rimpi-strung couch on which they sat was {{immediately}} under the hanging lamp--a somewhat unfortunate situation for such endearments. But what <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> of hanging lamps or any other lights, save those of their own eyes, they who were content to kiss and murmur words of passion as though they were as much alone as Adam and Eve in Eden?

40|$|How do low-income {{households}} <b>think</b> about retirement? <b>Do</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> about retirement? If so, when <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> will retire, {{and what}} is it they plan to live on? In this paper, we present evidence on these questions based on 51 qualitative interviews with low-income families in the Detroit area. We find that the great majority of low-income households think about retirement, although this does not necessarily mean they are able to plan and/or save actively for retirement. Most respondents plan to retire as soon as they become eligible for Social Security or, in a fe...|$|R

60|$|The Christians {{heard the}} order with an astonishment that took away all their powers of resistance. The suddenness of the {{presence}} of death stupified them. They did not resort even to an entreaty. They waited, like sheep, to be butchered. Little <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> what kind of saviour was at hand.|$|E
60|$|And China {{smiled and}} waited. On her land side, along her boundaries, were {{millions}} of the warriors of Europe. She mobilized {{five times as}} many millions of her militia and awaited the invasion. On her sea coasts she did the same. But China was puzzled. After all this enormous preparation, there was no invasion. She could not understand. Along the great Siberian frontier all was quiet. Along her coasts the towns and villages were not even shelled. Never, {{in the history of}} the world, had there been so mighty a gathering of war fleets. The fleets of all the world were there, and day and night millions of tons of battleships ploughed the brine of her coasts, and nothing happened. Nothing was attempted. <b>Did</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> to make her emerge from her shell? China smiled. <b>Did</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> to tire her out, or starve her out? China smiled again.|$|E

60|$|And now let us {{indulge in}} a very {{interesting}} speculation; how did {{it feel to be}} a man in those early days of the human adventure? How did men think and what <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> in those remote days of hunting and wandering four hundred centuries ago before seed time and harvest began. Those were days long before the written record of any human impressions, and we are left almost entirely to inference and guesswork in our answers to these questions.|$|E

60|$|With the {{appearance}} of these two men Bert's whole universe had changed again. A curtain fell before the immense and terrible desolation that had overwhelmed him. He was {{in a world of}} three people, a minute human world that nevertheless filled his brain with eager speculations and schemes and cunning ideas. What were they thinking of? What <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> of him? What did they mean to do? A hundred busy threads interlaced in his mind as he pottered studiously over the Asiatic aeroplane. New ideas came up like bubbles in soda water.|$|E
6000|$|Some {{statements}} I disagree with; others I do not understand. If a man says, [...] "I {{think the}} human race {{would be better if}} it abstained totally from fermented liquor," [...] I quite understand what he means, and how his view could be defended. If a man says, [...] "I wish to abolish beer because I am a temperance man," [...] his remark conveys no meaning to my mind. It is like saying, [...] "I wish to abolish roads because I am a moderate walker." [...] If a man says, [...] "I am not a Trinitarian," [...] I understand. But if he says (as a lady once said to me), [...] "I believe in the Holy Ghost in a spiritual sense," [...] I go away dazed. In what other sense could one believe in the Holy Ghost? And I am sorry to say that this pamphlet of progressive religious views is full of baffling observations of that kind. What can people mean when they say that science has disturbed their view of sin? What sort of view of sin can they have had before science disturbed it? <b>Did</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> that it was something to eat? When people say that science has shaken their faith in immortality, what do they mean? <b>Did</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> that immortality was a gas? ...|$|E

She was not aware that there had been any alteration in herself, and it was a revelation that set her to examine where she had changed--poor little thing! She was not angry, she did not resent the charge, she took it for granted that, coming from such a source, it must be true and reasonable--and what did it mean? <b>Did</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> her too gay, or neglectful of old friends?

He was of an age and in a mood to enter into them with all his heart, though he uttered little more than an {{occasional}} question, or some murmured remark when anything struck him.
