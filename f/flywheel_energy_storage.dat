25|$|The Toyota TS030 Hybrid LMP1 car, {{a racing}} car {{developed}} under Le Mans Prototype rules, uses a hybrid drivetrain with supercapacitors. In the 2012 24 Hours of Le Mans race a TS030 qualified with a fastest lap only 1.055 seconds slower (3:24.842 versus 3:23.787) than the fastest car, an Audi R18 e-tron quattro with <b>flywheel</b> <b>energy</b> <b>storage.</b> The supercapacitor and flywheel components, whose rapid charge-discharge capabilities help in both braking and acceleration, made the Audi and Toyota hybrids the fastest {{cars in the}} race. In the 2012 Le Mans race the two competing TS030s, {{one of which was}} in the lead for part of the race, both retired for reasons unrelated to the supercapacitors. The TS030 won three of the 8 races in the 2012 FIA World Endurance Championship season. In 2014 the Toyota TS040 Hybrid used a supercapacitor to add 480 horsepower from two electric motors.|$|E

Current leads, used for transferring currents from the power converters, working at room temperature, into the liquid helium environment, where the magnets are operating, represent an immediate application of the emerging technology of high temperature superconductivity. The LHC, currently under construction at CERN, will transfer more than 3 million amp√®res of current through leads having high temperature superconducting sections, thus providing a unique opportunity to incorporate these materials into large scale systems.
