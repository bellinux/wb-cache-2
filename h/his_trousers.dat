5|$|After dawn, Les accidentally wakes Maxwell, but {{sees that}} Kath is absent. The train brakes, waking everyone, and Hugo and the corpse {{fall to the}} floor. Maxwell guesses that Kath has stopped the train as Jorg stands, {{dropping}} <b>his</b> <b>trousers.</b> Maxwell next guesses that Kath has jumped {{in front of the}} train, and Les repeatedly hits him with a pillow as Jorg defecates into Kath's shoebox, which is held by Hugo. Shona sees that the train has hit a deer, and Kath re-enters.|$|E
5|$|Hartmann patiently {{waited for}} the right moment to escape, then, using the {{distraction}} of the Stukas attack, he attacked the single guard. Hartmann jumped {{out of the back of}} the truck and ran into a large field of giant sunflowers. Evading the pursuing soldiers, Hartmann hid and waited for nightfall. In the dark, Hartmann followed a Soviet patrol heading west to the front. As he approached the German position, he was challenged by a sentry who fired a shot which passed through <b>his</b> <b>trousers.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1972, the ferret-legging record {{stood at}} 40 seconds. A few years later, the record {{had risen to}} over one minute, and {{eventually}} to 90 minutes. In 1977, Edward Simpkins from the Isle of Wight set the new world record of five hours and ten minutes, although he only had one ferret in <b>his</b> <b>trousers</b> during the first four hours and two for the last seventy minutes. Simpkins sustained two large bites during his record-breaking attempt, but continued {{to play a game}} of darts undeterred.|$|E

5|$|Warwick Davis as Nikabrik, a black dwarf. He is {{descendant}} of Ginarrbrik, who served the White Witch, and bears {{one of his}} rings, which was passed down from each generation. Mark Johnson acknowledged casting Davis as the treacherous Nikabrik was casting against type: Berger covered all his face bar his eyelids in prosthetics, to allow Davis {{to ward off the}} audience's perceptions of him. Nikabrik's nose was based on Berger. Davis feared filming in the Czech Republic, because the grass is filled with ticks, so he put elastic bands to hold <b>his</b> <b>trousers</b> against his legs. Davis portrayed Reepicheep in the 1989 BBC production of Prince Caspian.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{were made}} to {{photograph}} the corpse for the naval identity card Martin would have to carry, but the results were unsatisfactory, and {{it was obvious that}} the images were of a cadaver. Montagu and Cholmondeley conducted a search for people who resembled the corpse, finding Captain Ronnie Reed of MI5; Reed agreed to be photographed for the identity card, wearing Royal Marine uniform. As the three cards and passes needed looked too new for a long-serving officer, they were issued as recent replacements for lost originals. Montagu spent the next few weeks rubbing all three cards on <b>his</b> <b>trousers</b> to provide a used sheen to them. To provide a used look to the uniform, it was worn by Cholmondeley, who was about the same build. The only non-issue part to the uniform was the underwear, which was in short supply in war-rationed Britain, so a pair of good-quality woollen underwear, owned by the late Herbert Fisher, the Warden of New College, Oxford, was used.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{was given}} the {{responsibility}} of batting in the number three position when Hassett was afflicted by tonsillitis. In the First Test at Johannesburg, Miller scored 21 and then took 5/40 in South Africa's first innings, only his second match on tour, resulting in the home side being forced to follow on and lose by an innings. In the Second Test at Cape Town, he scored 58 and then took 3/54 in the first innings. On the third morning, Miller crashed his car and arrived late to the ground, still putting on <b>his</b> <b>trousers</b> {{as he entered the}} playing field. Despite, this he dismissed Dudley Nourse with his third ball. He was wicketless in the second innings, and took only one in the Third Test in Durban and did not pass 10 with the bat. Australia won both matches. He returned to the form in the Fourth Test with 84, 33 notout and 3/75 in a high scoring draw. Miller took match figures of 5/66 in the Fifth Test as Australia took the series 4–0. He ended the series with 246runs at 41.00 and 17wickets at 22.94, placing in the top six in the Test averages for bat and ball. During the tour matches, he took match figures of 11/54 against Natal Country Districts and scored a century against Transvaal.|$|E

25|$|In the June 2006 Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra Silent Film Gala program {{book for}} Safety Last!, film {{historian}} Jeffrey Vance stated that Robert A. Golden, Lloyd's assistant director, routinely doubled for Harold Lloyd between 1921 and 1927. According to Vance, Golden doubled Lloyd in the bit with Harold shimmy shaking off the building's ledge after a mouse crawls up <b>his</b> <b>trousers.</b>|$|E

During this period Saddam was interrogated by FBI agent George Piro.|$|E
25|$|Ten {{days before}} the attack on Georgi Markov, Bulgarian defector, Vladimir Kostov survived an attack {{similar to the one}} against Markov. Kostov was {{standing}} on an escalator of the Paris metro when he felt a sting in his lower back above the belt of <b>his</b> <b>trousers.</b> He developed a fever, but recovered. After Markov's death the wound on Kostov's back was examined and a ricin-laced pellet identical to the one used against Markov was removed.|$|E

25|$|A {{contemporary}} account, however, suggests more mundanely that Peter Niers was {{a master}} of disguise: In a circulated warrant from 1579, based on confessions from his captured underlings, when Niers was thought {{to operate in the}} Schwarzwald area, it is stated that he frequently changed his appearance and costume, sometimes masquerading as a common soldier, at other times as a leper, {{and a number of other}} disguises. The same warrant states, however, that some things stayed constant: He always had a lot of money on him, he carried two loaded pistols in <b>his</b> <b>trousers,</b> and a huge two-handed sword.|$|E
25|$|Dave Bartlett and Vanessa Hunt, the two paramedics {{who were}} called {{to the scene of}} Kelly's death, have since gone public with their opinion that there was not enough blood at the {{location}} to justify the belief that he had died from blood loss. Bartlett and Hunt told The Guardian that they had seen a small amount of blood on plants near Kelly's body and a patch of blood the size of a coin on <b>his</b> <b>trousers.</b> They said they would expect to find several pints of blood at the scene of a suicide involving an arterial cut. Two forensic pathologists, Chris Milroy of Sheffield University and Guy Rutty of Leicester University, dismissed the paramedics' claims, saying it is hard to judge blood loss from the scene of a death, as some blood may have seeped into the ground. Milroy also told The Guardian that Kelly's heart condition may have made it hard for him to sustain any significant degree of blood loss.|$|E
25|$|Ant {{was brought}} to court at the Old Bailey. The charges against him, which {{included}} criminal damage and threatening members of the public, were reduced to a single count of causing affray, to which he pleaded guilty. He was fined £500 and ordered to psychiatric care with a suspended sentence. In June 2003, he was arrested again by police after a conflict with a neighbour resulted in him attempting to smash in the neighbour's patio door with a shovel, and then lying down on the concrete floor of a café basement with <b>his</b> <b>trousers</b> pulled down, curling up, and trying to sleep. Once again {{he was charged with}} affray and criminal damage and spent time in psychiatric wards. In September of that year he was sectioned under the Mental Health Act 1983, and spent a further six months receiving in-patient psychiatric care. He was eventually granted a conditional discharge by the judge at Highbury Magistrates Court.|$|E

25|$|Much {{international}} attention was attracted especially {{by the discovery}} of an extremely rare find, a life-sized sandstone statue or stele, dating from the 5th century BC, which was found just outside the larger tumulus. The stele, fully preserved except for its feet, depicts an armed male warrior. It measures 186cm in height and weighs 230kg. It is made from a type of sandstone available within a few kilometres of Glauberg. Much detail is clearly visible: <b>his</b> <b>trousers,</b> composite armour tunic, wooden shield and a typical La Tène sword hanging from his right side. The moustachioed man wears a torc with three pendants, remarkably {{similar to the one}} from the chamber in mound 1, several rings on both arms and one on the right hand. On his head, he wears a hood-like headdress crowned by two protrusions, resembling the shape of a mistletoe leaf. Such headdresses are also known from a handful of contemporary sculptures. As mistletoe is believed to have held a magical or religious significance to the Celts, it could indicate that the warrior depicted also played the role of a priest. Fragments of three similar statues were also discovered in the area. It is suggested that all four statues once stood in the rectangular enclosure. Perhaps they were associated with an ancestor cult.|$|E
25|$|Scene Two {{takes place}} two weeks later. It is midday, {{and the sun}} is scorching. Too hot to work, the mechanics, wearing {{sleeveless}} tank tops or stripped to their waists, laze around the garage and flirt with their girlfriends. Luca has taken Angelo under his wing and is teaching him how to fight. Unfortunately, Angelo shows little skill and continues to be the subject of the other mechanics' ridicule. Dino arrives, looking rather silly in a straw hat, Hawaiian shirt, Bermudas, and socks and sandals. Taking his briefcase, he leaves for a trip. Luca begins flirting with Lana, who is kneading dough for bread, and mutual seduction ensues. The mechanics and their partners also begin behaving lustily with increasing intensity. Lana leads Luca into her apartment with Dino above Dino's office. They make love, and Luca subsequently emerges dressed only in his underwear and an unbuttoned shirt, smoking a cigarette. He then re-enters the apartment and returns to Lana. Other couples lounge around the garage floor, apparently in post-coital bliss. Dino returns from his trip, and chases his workers and their friends away. He sees Lana through the apartment window and thinks she is waving at him, not realizing she is again making love to Luca with her hand pressed to the window. Dino ascends the metal staircase leading to the apartment, but trips and makes a clattering noise. Lana and Luca realize that Dino has returned. Just as Dino enters the apartment, Luca leaves by throwing his clothes out of another window and climbing down a fire escape. He dresses, but discovers that one of his boots is missing. Fortunately, Lana tosses the boot out of the window. Luca puts it on and walks away quickly. Angelo observes and follows him. Next, we see a car in the garage shaking as two people engage in sexual intercourse within. Luca emerges, buttoning <b>his</b> <b>trousers,</b> followed – unexpectedly – by Angelo. The expression on Angelo's face indicates he has fallen in love with Luca, and in parallel solos, both Lana and Angelo express joyous ecstasy at having encountered Luca that night.|$|E
