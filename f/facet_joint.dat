5|$|Antidepressants may be {{effective}} for treating chronic pain associated with symptoms of depression, {{but they have}} a risk of side effects. Although the antiseizure drugs gabapentin and carbamazepine are sometimes used for chronic low back pain and may relieve sciatic pain, there is insufficient evidence to support their use. Systemic oral steroids have not been shown to be useful in low back pain. <b>Facet</b> <b>joint</b> injections and steroid injections into the discs have not been found to {{be effective}} in those with persistent, non-radiating pain; however, they may be considered for those with persistent sciatic pain. Epidural corticosteroid injections provide a slight and questionable short-term improvement in those with sciatica but are of no long term benefit. There are also concerns of potential side effects.|$|E
5|$|Imaging is {{indicated}} {{when there are}} red flags, ongoing neurological symptoms that do not resolve, or ongoing or worsening pain. In particular, early use of imaging (either MRI or CT) is recommended for suspected cancer, infection, or cauda equina syndrome. MRI is slightly better than CT for identifying disc disease; the two technologies are equally useful for diagnosing spinal stenosis. Only a few physical diagnostic tests are helpful. The straight leg raise test is almost always positive in those with disc herniation. Lumbar provocative discography {{may be useful to}} identify a specific disc causing pain in those with chronic high levels of low back pain. Similarly, therapeutic procedures such as nerve blocks can be used to determine a specific source of pain. Some evidence supports the use of <b>facet</b> <b>joint</b> injections, transforminal epidural injections and sacroilliac injections as diagnostic tests. Most other physical tests, such as evaluating for scoliosis, muscle weakness or wasting, and impaired reflexes, are of little use.|$|E

40|$|The {{cervical}} <b>facet</b> <b>joints</b> of 20 cadavers {{were studied}} systematically with MR, CT, cryomicrotomy, and histologic sections {{to determine the}} anatomic changes that occur with age. Uniform layers of cartilage and subarticular cortical bone characterize the cervical <b>facet</b> <b>joints</b> in cadavers under 20 years of age.

5000|$|The biomechanical {{function}} of {{each pair of}} <b>facet</b> <b>joints</b> is to guide and limit movement of the spinal motion segment. In the lumbar spine, for example, the <b>facet</b> <b>joints</b> function to protect the motion segment from anterior shear forces, excessive rotation and flexion. <b>Facet</b> <b>joints</b> appear to have little influence on the range of side bending (lateral flexion). These functions can be disrupted by degeneration, dislocation, fracture, injury, instability from trauma, osteoarthritis, and surgery.In the thoracic spine the <b>facet</b> <b>joints</b> function to restrain the amount of flexion and anterior translation of the corresponding vertebral segment and function to facilitate rotation.

40|$|Cadaveric lumbar spine {{specimens}} of “motion segments”, each including two vertebrae and the linking disc and <b>facet</b> <b>joints,</b> were compressed. The pressure across the <b>facet</b> <b>joints</b> {{was measured using}} interposed pressure-recording paper. This was repeated for 12 pairs of <b>facet</b> <b>joints</b> at four angles of posture and with three different disc heights.

At each lumbar intersegmental level the intervertebral disc and the facetjoints act together to resist the resultant force acting through the “motion segment”. This force can be resolved into two components, one acting perpen-dicu!ar to the plane of the disc to produce compression, and the other acting in the plane of the disc to produce shear.

40|$|AbstractThe complex {{motion and}} {{geometry}} of the spine in the cervical region {{makes it difficult to}} determine how loads are distributed through adjacent vertebrae or between the zygapophysial (<b>facet)</b> <b>joints</b> and the intervertebral disc. Validated finite element modes can give insight on this distribution. The aim of this contribution was to produce direct validation of subject-specific finite element models of Functional Spinal Units (FSU׳s) of the cervical spine and to evaluate the importance of including fibre directionality in the mechanical description of the annulus fibrosus. Eight specimens of cervical FSU׳s were prepared from five ovine spines and mechanically tested in axial compression monitoring overall load and displacements as well as local <b>facet</b> <b>joints</b> pressure and displacement. Subject-specific finite element models were produced from microCT image data reproducing the experimental setup and measuring global axial force and displacement as well as local <b>facet</b> <b>joints</b> displacement and contact forces. Material models and parameters were taken from the literature, testing isotropic and anisotropic materials for the annulus fibrosus. The validated models showed that adding the direction of the fibres to their non-linear behaviour in the description of the annulus fibrosus improves the predictions at large strain values but not at low strain values. The load transferred through the <b>facet</b> <b>joints</b> was always accurate, irrespective of the annulus material model, while the predicted facet displacement was larger than the measured one but not significantly. This is, to the authors׳ knowledge, the first subject-specific direct validation study on a group of specimens, accounting for inter-subject variability...|$|R
