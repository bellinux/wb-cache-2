25|$|The IoT {{contributes}} significantly towards innovating farming methods. Farming challenges {{caused by}} {{population growth and}} climate change have made {{it one of the}} first industries to utilize the IoT. The integration of wireless sensors with agricultural mobile apps and cloud platforms helps in collecting vital information pertaining to the environmental conditions – temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind speed, pest infestation, soil <b>humus</b> <b>content</b> or nutrients, besides others – linked with a farmland, can be used to improve and automate farming techniques, take informed decisions to improve quality and quantity, and minimize risks and wastes. The app-based field or crop monitoring also lowers the hassles of managing crops at multiple locations. For example, farmers can now detect which areas have been fertilised (or mistakenly missed), if the land is too dry and predict future yields.|$|E
50|$|The {{combined}} {{effects of}} clay and <b>humus</b> <b>content</b> produce dark colors and crumb structure. Typical pH for Rendzina soils is between 5 and 8, and base saturation is high. Calcium and magnesium are abundant, but potassium content is often low, so nutrient imbalances are common.|$|E
50|$|The {{area of the}} Tägermoos {{has only}} a very slight slope and is {{approximately}} one to two metres above the water level of the Seerhein. The moist soil required comprehensive drainage to allow intensive agricultural use. It is, however, very fertile, due to its high <b>humus</b> <b>content.</b>|$|E
40|$|An organic {{long-term}} {{field experiment}} {{has been carried}} out at the experimental station Gladbacherhof (Giessen University, Germany) since 1998 to survey the performance of agronomical, economical and ecological indicators dependant on farm type and tillage intensity. This article presents results on cash crop yields and changes in <b>humus</b> <b>contents</b> in the first two rotations of the experiment. It can be concluded that organic stockless farming without ley affects cash crop yields and demands special attention with regard to a sustainable humus management. Stockless farming with rotational ley on the other hand up to now showed a satisfactory performance when compared to a mixed farm type with livestock. As for the yields, reduced tillage systems could cope with the regularly ploughed reference system if at least a shallow turning of the soil was carried out. An increase of <b>humus</b> <b>contents</b> was not induced by reduced tillage systems...|$|R
40|$|In organic farms, the {{internal}} carbon and nitrogen fluxes are of great importance. They are {{connected with the}} soil fertility (<b>humus</b> <b>contents,</b> biological activity, and soil struc-ture) and yield potential; {{some of them may}} affect the environment. The approach used in the described model software allows quantifying management related and siting dependant C and N fluxes and also the resulting emissions as starting point for an emission inventory from farms...|$|R
30|$|Additionally, due to {{the darker}} color humus rich soils are more {{susceptible}} to warming by sun radiation (Scheffer et al. 2002). As grubs are poikilothermic, all soil characteristics affecting soil temperature are potentially important factors for grub development. Scheerpelz (1950) supposed that the temperature radiation of soils might even direct swarming females of M. melolontha to adequate sites for oviposition. High <b>humus</b> <b>contents</b> might also promote optimal soil structures for the mobility of the larvae and the adults, which deposit their eggs up to 20  cm below the soil surface (Milne 1956).|$|R
50|$|The terrain in {{most areas}} is eroded soils and karst topography, with smooth raised areas, and shallow depressions. The black soil, which derives its color from a high <b>humus</b> <b>content</b> (540 tons/hectare) is unusual for being under {{deciduous}} forest, and reaches a depth of 1.5 m.|$|E
50|$|Chamaelirium luteum prefers moist, well {{drained and}} acidic soil (pH: 4.5 - 6) {{with a high}} <b>humus</b> <b>content.</b> In open fields it should be shaded by a shading structure, {{to protect it from}} the direct {{radiation}} of the sun. For forest cultivation it should be preferably planted in an area with tall hardwood trees.|$|E
50|$|There {{is also a}} {{range of}} abiotic factors that dry grasslands can be found in. The {{following}} comparison example is used to illustrate the range of abiotic factors in dry grasslands. In Vratsa, a city in Bulgaria, there are dry grasslands with a base rich pH of 6.7, ranging from 4.8 to 8.0 and shows a high <b>humus</b> <b>content</b> {{with a mean of}} 23.3%, and a range of 13.4 to 43.9%. Whereas Koprivshtitsa, a smaller town in Bulgaria with a different environment, has a different pH of 5.0, with a range of 4.4 to 6.4 and a low <b>humus</b> <b>content</b> with a mean of 9.1% and a range of 2.3 to 22%. This is proven to match the many other dry grasslands found in other parts of Europe. This contributes to the knowledge that {{there are a variety of}} dry grassland environmental conditions, which are even visible in a single country.|$|E
40|$|The aim of our {{contribution}} was to ascertain an influence of heavy metals on {{quantitative and qualitative}} composition of soil microflora. Our experiment was directed to quantitative isolation of culturable bacteria from individual soil samples and to the comparison of the amounts and colony morphology of the isolates from various soil samples. These soil samples were characteristic by a difference in pH, heavy metals and <b>humus</b> <b>contents.</b> Despite the differences between individual soil samples, the most of bacterial isolates were represented by Bacillus genus (especially Bacillus cereus and Bacillus mycoides) which belongs to the heavy metal resistant bacterial kinds...|$|R
30|$|High <b>humus</b> <b>contents</b> in soil {{can have}} various {{beneficial}} effects on P. horticola populations. Milne (1956) concluded from the grassy natural habitat {{of the species}} that its main food is grass roots. But McQuillan and Webb (1994) found that the larvae of Adoryphorus couloni (Scarabaeidae), which cause increasing damage in southeastern Australian pastures, can selectively feed on concentrated sources of soil organic matter. Kahrer et al. (2011) state, however without references, that young M. melolontha larvae feed on fine roots but also on humus particles, which may be valid for young P. horticola larvae as well. According to Li and Brune (2005, 2007) humivorous Scarabaeidae larvae can utilize the microbial biomass {{as well as the}} nitrogenous components of humus.|$|R
40|$|In organic farms, the {{internal}} carbon fluxes are of great importance. They are connected with soil fertility (<b>humus</b> <b>contents,</b> biological activity, soil structure) and the yield potential; some C pools (C fixation in humus) and C fluxes (CO 2 and CH 4 emissions) {{may affect the}} environment. The approach used in the described model software allows to quantify management related and site dependant C fluxes and also the resulting emissions as starting point for an inventory of emissions from farms. The software was validated {{on the basis of}} intensive investigations made in the Experimental Farm Scheyern over many years. The results corresponded well to the measured values and characterize Scheyern as a farming system of intensive ecological shaping...|$|R
5000|$|Here 20 {{different}} soil {{types are}} distinguished. They differ {{on the degree}} of podsolisation and the <b>humus</b> <b>content.</b> All floors of the Forest on the Vorskla are based on the Russian soil classification from 1977 about the type of gray forest soils. [...] According to the USDA soil classification they belong to the Alfi sols, after the German soil classification if they were classified as Luvisols.|$|E
5000|$|The use of [...] "organic" [...] {{popularized by}} Howard and Rodale, {{on the other}} hand, refers more {{narrowly}} {{to the use of}} organic matter derived from plant compost and animal manures to improve the <b>humus</b> <b>content</b> of soils, grounded in the work of early soil scientists who developed what was then called [...] "humus farming." [...] Since the early 1940s the two camps have tended to merge.|$|E
50|$|Up until 2005, {{the primary}} means of {{prevention}} was a pre-plant treatment of Bromomethane or methyl bromide. The import and production of this fumigation chemical was banned under the Montreal Protocol. A modern organic method of prevention was found by a Japanese study on soil adsorptions role in the adsorption of PMMoV. The study found that increased <b>humus</b> <b>content</b> in a soil will have an inhibitory effect on PMMoV adsorption.|$|E
30|$|The {{results of}} this study {{indicate}} that P. horticola was the dominant species in the top soil layer of the sampled sites and was largely responsible for grub damage in the investigated region, which was situated at 800 – 1, 200  m above sea level and characterized by lime-free, sandy Leptosols or Cambisols over siliceous, gravelly material. The damage threshold for P. horticola lay at 94 grubs/m 2. Also sites which had not shown grub damage revealed significant grub populations, which should be considered when applying control measures. Regression analyses indicated high <b>humus</b> <b>contents</b> in soil to be favorable for the development of high grub densities in the sampling sites, while intensive cutting frequencies might have mitigating effects on grub damage.|$|R
40|$|The {{apparent}} diffusion coefficients, Dp/b+o, of Zn and ZNEDTA were linear {{functions of}} added Zn and {{were related to}} the adsorption and fixation capacities of soils rather than their pH. Lower apparent diffusion coefficient values were found in an Haplustoll soil that had higher clay and <b>humus</b> <b>contents</b> inspite of its lower pH. At comparable rated of added Zn, the apparent diffusion of ZNEDTA was 930 - 1010 (Bakyria), 700 - 1330 (Dirab), and 730 - 1880 (Baha) times that of Zn in the soils. The adsorbed Zn per cm 3 of soil/Zn per cm 3 of the equilibrium solution at the water content existing in the diffusion experiment approximated the capacity factor and was determined by extrapolation. The self-diffusion coefficient of Zn in Baha soil (5 x 10 - 7 Cm 2 sec- 1) of higher clay and water content was higher than in Bakyria or Dirab soil (2 x 10 - 7 cm 2 sec 1). These values were similar to the self-diffusion coefficient of P in soils of similar texture at similar water content...|$|R
40|$|A {{soil survey}} in the Y-polders was {{combined}} with studies of yield of sugarbeet on different soils. Subsoil differences {{were shown to}} be the most important factor. Topsoils in the Y-polders proved to be uniform in composition and to consists of young Ysselmere clay (underwater deposits) with a lutum (clay) content of 35 - 40 %. The thickness of the clay layer proved to be very varied. Sands, peat, peat detritus, peaty silt were the materials of which the subsoil was built up through an intricate history of sedimentation. Therefore soils were classified on clay thickness and subsoil characteristics. To test the agricultural value of this classification, yields of various soil types were compared in the polders and on some soils of the Haarlemmermeer. This data proved that high <b>humus</b> <b>contents</b> caused low contents of sugar. The influence of decalcified topsoils and cat-clay subsoils was not important in 1949 because of the weather. Coarse sandy subsoils and heavy layers had much influence; maximum yields were achieved on soils with 75 cm Y clay. A suitability scheme for sugar- beets was derived from the data. <p/...|$|R
50|$|Pachysandra {{can grow}} in deep-shade areas {{and is thus}} well-suited and popular as ground cover for shade gardens. The most {{commonly}} used species is P. terminalis, the Japanese spurge, which is an aggressively spreading evergreen ground cover. It is very deer-resistant. The form 'Variegata' has leaves attractively variegated green and creamy white, and is slightly less invasive. 'Green Sheen' Pachysandra has extra glossy leaves and slowly spreads. All species in this genus prefer a well-drained soil with a high <b>humus</b> <b>content.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The soil {{remediation}} intervention values indicate when the functional {{properties of the}} soil forhumans, plants and animals is seriously impaired or threatened. They are representative of thelevel of contamination above which a serious case of soil contamination is deemed to exist. The target values for soil are adjusted for the organic matter (<b>humus)</b> <b>content</b> and soil fraction <0.2 µm (lutum - Latin, meaning [...] "mud" [...] or [...] "clay"). The values below are calculated for a 'Standard Soil' with 10% organic matter and 25% lutum.|$|E
50|$|Young dunes {{are called}} yellow dunes and dunes which have high <b>humus</b> <b>content</b> are called grey dunes. Leaching occurs on the dunes, washing humus into the slacks, and the slacks {{may be much}} more {{developed}} than the exposed tops of the dunes. It is usually in the slacks that more rare species are developed {{and there is a}} tendency for the dune slacks soil to be waterlogged and where only marsh plants can survive. These plants would include: creeping willow, cotton grass, yellow iris, reeds, and rushes. As for the species, there is a tendency for natterjack toads to breed here.|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} and physical properties of allophanic and non-allophanic Andosols in Aomori prefecture {{described in a}} Soil Survey Report on Reclaimed Land (SSRRL) are discussed. Volcanic ash soil and non-volcanic ash soil having more than 15 g P 2 O 5 kg - 1 of phosphate absorption coefficient are regarded as Andosols. In this study, 251 soil profiles and 657 soil horizons were classified into two groups based on exchange acidity y 1; into allophanic Andosols (y 1 1 ≥ 6). The physical properties (soil color, texture, gravel, stickiness, consistence (dry), tilth and wetness) in SSRRL were scored into 6 classes from 0 to 5. The mean <b>humus</b> <b>contents</b> of non-allophanic Andosols was 13. 1 % {{at a depth of}} 0 - 15 cm, 11. 0 % at 15 - 30 cm and 7. 7 % at 30 - 50 cm and were slightly higher than those of allophanic Andosols. Non-allophanic Andosols have a relatively high texture score compared with allophanic Andosols. Moreover, non-allophanic Andosols are relatively sticky. As compared with allophanic Andosols, non-allophanic Andosols have higher clay content and are sticky and hard. Thus, the differences of {{chemical and}} physical properties of allophanic Andosols and non-allophanic Andosols described in SSRRL were evaluated...|$|R

30|$|Apart {{from the}} {{possible}} function as food resource for young larvae of P. horticola, high <b>humus</b> <b>contents</b> might provide optimal moisture conditions by {{contributing to the}} water permeability in soils with higher clay or silt content, but retaining enough soil water in sandy soils (Scheffer et al. 2002), which were typical for the investigated grassland sites. On the one hand, Laughlin (1957 b) showed that the eggs are not resistant to desiccation with relative humidities[*]≤[*] 98 % being lethal. On the other hand, moist soils are inadequate for P. horticola grub development (Milne 1964), because of increased pressure by diseases (Milne 1984), difficult hatching conditions (Raw 1951) and the negative effect on soil temperatures. Milne (1964) even considered that:” Apart from proper food, which is provided by grassland, the most important living condition for the garden chafer in the soil appears to be proper soil moisture”. Gaylor and Frankie (1979) showed that Phyllophaga crinita (Scarabaeidae), causing heavy damage to crops and turfs in North- and Central-America, did not oviposit in very wet or very dry soil and egg as well as early larval instar survival were low under extreme conditions. Comparably, Cyclocephala immaculata (Scarabaeidae), a pest in north-american turf grasses, failed to oviposit and introduced 1 st instar larvae did not survive in desiccated turf (Potter and Gordon 1984).|$|R
50|$|Subsoil is {{the layer}} of soil under the topsoil {{on the surface of}} the ground. Like topsoil it is {{composed}} of a variable mixture of small particles such as sand, silt and/or clay, but it lacks the organic matter and <b>humus</b> <b>content</b> of topsoil. Below the subsoil is the substratum, which can be residual bedrock, sediments, or aeolian deposits. As it is lacking in dark humus, subsoil is usually paler in colour than the overlying topsoil. It may contain the deeper roots of some plants, such as trees, but a majority of plant roots lie within the surface topsoil.|$|E

While Mount Hamiguitan is an ultramafic mountain, N. hamiguitanensis does not necessarily grow in an ultramafic substrate, owing to the high <b>humus</b> <b>content</b> of the forest underlayer. At the type locality, N. hamiguitanensis occurs at an average density of around two to three plants per 50 m2, as estimated by eye.

40|$|Many soils of Uzbekistan {{have low}} water and {{nutrient}} holding capacity {{because of their}} sandy texture, low organic matter concentrations and degradation caused by long years of cotton monoculture. Conservation tillage production systems {{have the potential to}} increase the productivity of these soils by increasing soil <b>humus</b> and nitrogen <b>content.</b> As practiced conservation tillage helped to lessen N leaching losses, holding more of these elements within the topsoil as well as increase crop productivity. Conventional tillage cotton/wheat/maize crop rotation has resulted very low <b>humus</b> and nitrogen <b>content</b> in soil by degreasing crop yield. Therefore, the effects of tillage, and crop rotation were examined on growth and yield of crops in three cotton-based rotation systems, (i) cotton/wheat/maize, (ii) cotton/wheat/sorghum and (iii) cotton/wheat/soybean, in Tashkent region in middle east of Uzbekistan. This obtained result suggests that no tillage with inserting legumes in crop rotation is able to improve soil quality and plant productivity...|$|R

By the 1960s, pipelines were laid from Horsley Hills to Rishi Valley. The open wells went dry for four years (1981-1985) due to extensive farming and channel irrigation. As soon as the open wells went dry, borewells were laid in order to satisfy the new water requirements of the school. The introduction of borewells led to groundwater depletion while the open wells were neglected. The introduction of borewells led to farmers changing their old agricultural patterns, shifting from dry land crops to more water-intense crops, causing the groundwater table to be further eroded.|$|E

40|$|Our {{knowledge}} on tree responses to drought is mainly based on short-term manipulation experiments {{which do not}} capture any possible long-term adjustments in this response. Therefore, historical water channels in inner-Alpine dry valleys were used as century-long irrigation experiments to investigate adjustments in tree growth to contrasting water supply. This involved quantifying the tree-ring growth of irrigated and non-irrigated (control) Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in Valais (Switzerland), as well as European larch (Larix decidua Mill.) and black pine (Pinus nigra Arnold) in Vinschgau (Italy). Furthermore, the adjustments in radial growth of Scots pine and European larch to an abrupt stop in irrigation were analyzed. Irrigation promoted the radial growth of all tree species investigated compared to the control: (1) directly through increased soil water availability, and (2) indirectly through increased soil nutrients and <b>humus</b> <b>contents</b> in the irrigated plots. Irrigation led to a full elimination of growth responses to climate for European larch and black pine, but not for Scots pine, which might become more sensitive to drought with increasing tree size in Valais. For the control trees, {{the response of the}} latewood increment to water availability in July/August has decreased in recent decades for all species, but increased in May for Scots pine only. The sudden irrigation stop caused a drop in radial growth to a lower level for Scots pine or similar level for larch compared to the control for up to ten years. However, both tree species were then able to adjust to the new conditions and subsequently grew with similar (Scots pine) or even higher growth rates(larch) than the control. To estimate the impact of climate change on future forest development, the duration of manipulation experiments should be on longer time scales in order to capture adjustment processes and feedback mechanisms of forest ecosystems.

The trial aimed to investigate use possibility of carbocalc (CC) – pressed saturated silt (30 % CaO) and 40 t/ha stable manure in amendment of already determined unfavourable soil properties, increasing number of soil benefit microorganisms, as well as influence of obtained changes in weed control, sugar beet yield and quality. The weeds were controlled once with full-dose herbicides, repeated low-doses and by hoeing. Weed types, their number and weight were determined on 1 m 2 in the July second decade. The investigation results show that carbocalc application (CC) brought about increased pHKCL to 7. 12 – 7. 18 whereas stable manure one resulted in humus increased to 1. 73 – 1. 95 %. It was resulted in increasing of number of bacteria, actinomycetes as well as aerobic asimbiotic nitrogen fixing bacteria – Azotobacter chroococcum. Weed prevailed were as follows : Ambrosia artemisiifolia L., Polygonum persicarie L., Amaranthus retroflexus L. and Echinochloa crus galli L.
