My breast has felt the last four-and-twenty hours as if a ton of <b>kentledge</b> had been stowed in it. You ask me what you ought to do, child, and I {{do not know how}} to advise you, though you are my own sister's daughter!

60|$|They {{began at}} sunrise next day, {{but the work}} was hard. Cayman had been built for speed and when sail was set would not stand up without a large {{quantity}} of ballast. The ballast was iron <b>kentledge,</b> moulded to fit her frames, and when the floors were up the men, crouching in the dark, pulled the heavy blocks out of the bilge-water. Except {{for an hour or}} two at low tide Cayman did not lie quiet; when the water lifted her she rolled. The blocks were sent up in a sling and lowered into the boat, which did not carry much and must be rowed for half a mile across angry waves. Near the beach an anchor was dropped, and when she swung head to sea her crew jumped over and carried the iron through the surf. Sometimes they were forced to wait, and sometimes to haul off the boat.|$|E
6000|$|But how now? in this zoned quest, does Ahab touch no land? {{does his}} crew drink air? Surely, he will stop for water. Nay. For a long time, now, the circus-running sun has raced within his fiery ring, and needs no {{sustenance}} but what's in himself. So Ahab. Mark this, too, in the whaler. While other hulls are {{loaded down with}} alien stuff, {{to be transferred to}} foreign wharves; the world-wandering whale-ship carries no cargo but herself and crew, their weapons and their wants. She has a whole lake's contents bottled in her ample hold. She is ballasted with utilities; not altogether with unusable pig-lead and <b>kentledge.</b> She carries years' water in her. Clear old prime Nantucket water; which, when three years afloat, the Nantucketer, in the Pacific, prefers to drink before the brackish fluid, but yesterday rafted off in casks, from the Peruvian or Indian streams. Hence it is, that, while other ships may have gone to China from New York, and back again, touching at a score of ports, the whale-ship, in all that interval, may not have sighted one grain of soil; her crew having seen no man but floating seamen like themselves. So that did you carry them the news that another flood had come; they would only answer--"Well, boys, here's the ark!" ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Kentledge</b> (fr. ballast), or <b>kentledge</b> weights, are slabs or {{blocks of}} {{concrete}} or iron (commonly scrap iron or pig iron). They are used within ships as permanent, high-density ballast. They {{may also be}} used as counterweights in cranes such as tower cranes or swing bridges as is found in the Victoria Swing Bridge. On construction sites, prior to the erection of a building, static load testing may use a large number of <b>kentledge</b> stacked onto a platform. This platform is used to drive piles into the ground beneath to test the integrity of the foundation.|$|E

50|$|<b>Kentledge</b> {{refers to}} iron weights used as {{permanent}} ship balast, or iron or concrete weights used in load testing. This method involves {{the construction of}} a platform upon which massive weights are placed. These weights bear down on the pile putting it under load. Gauges measure resistance, movement of the pile, and other readings to determine the properties of the ground.|$|E
50|$|Vesuvius {{departed}} Boston, Massachusetts, for the Gulf of Mexico, but, while {{en route}} on 19 October, ran aground in the Gulf of Abaco. The ship lost her rudder and floated free only after her crew had jettisoned {{all of her}} guns and their carriages; her shot and shell; and even part of the <b>kentledge.</b> She finally reached New Orleans, Louisiana, on 27 November.|$|E
50|$|The {{temporary}} access scaffold {{required to}} complete the works had to consider the ancient monument status of the bridge so was unable to be tied into the structure. Suspending a scaffold from the carriageway was also unsuitable because the bridge could not withstand the <b>kentledge</b> weight required. The chosen solution was for the scaffold to be founded on the river bed with tubes secured around piers providing anchorage.|$|E
50|$|The Eamont and Wild Dayrell {{were both}} built by White, of Cowes. The Eamont was {{constructed}} of teak and mahogany, measured {{a little over}} 200 tons and had a mainboom 110 feet long. She was a very powerful vessel and carried 200 tons of iron <b>kentledge</b> fitted into her as a stationary ballast. She was armed with four 18-pounders a side and two pivot guns, like the Zephyr, the two vessels belonging to Dent & Co.|$|E
50|$|It was 212 ft long in total, with a {{clear span}} of 120 ft, and a roadway width of 24 ft. The bridge was {{constructed}} from wrought iron, and weighed 620 t, including 60 t of timber decking and 240 t of <b>kentledge</b> counterweight. The bridge carried two tracks of a dock railway and a road, and there are footpaths on either side outside the truss structure. The tracks and roadway have now been removed, and the bridge has a wooden deck.|$|E
50|$|USF Constellation, {{commanded}} by Captain Charles Stewart, departed Annapolis Roads in a gale, {{and arrived at}} Hampton Roads on February 3, 1813 to find that Royal Navy battleships and frigates had set a blockade. Constellation kedged up toward Norfolk, and when the tide rose ran in and anchored between the forts; {{and a few days}} later dropped down to cover the forts which were being built at Craney Island. Here she was exposed to attacks from the British force still lying in Hampton Roads, and, fearing they would attempt to carry her by surprise, Captain Stewart made preparation for defense. She was anchored {{in the middle of the}} narrow channel, flanked by gun-boats, her lower ports closed, not a rope left hanging over the sides; the boarding nettings, boiled in half-made pitch till they were as hard as wire, were triced outboard toward the yardarms, and loaded with <b>kentledge</b> to fall on the attacking boats when the retaining lines were cut, while the carronades were loaded to the muzzle with musket balls, and depressed so as to sweep the water near the ship.|$|E
40|$|A {{research}} project {{is currently being}} undertaken by Swinburne University of Technology in collaboration with The University of Melbourne to study the stability behaviour of buildings with a soft-storey when displaced laterally in an earthquake. An important feature of the research is experimental field-testing of soft storey bulding with precast reinforced concrete (RC) columns at a demolition site in Melbourne. The columns were weld-connected to the foundation and post-tensioned to the header beam. A four-storey building was partially demolished {{to the first floor}} level. The building was divided into modules each of which was isolated {{from the rest of the}} building and fitted with a steel platform for accommodating a <b>kentledge</b> weighing 50 tonnes. A quasi-static force was then applied to the building by hydraulic jacks via a piled tie-back system, and the force-displacement behaviour measured. A Fortran program was then developed from first principles to predict the force-displacement relationship of the column-portal assemblage. Significantly, the modelled relationship was found to be very consistent with experimental test results...|$|E
40|$|Commisssioned by Frieze Art for the Frieze Sculpture Park The project {{presents}} {{the image of}} a sculpture as a sculpture, installed {{in the form of a}} large scale digital print on vinyl stretched over a 14 x 28 ft (4. 2 x 8. 4 m) stretcher supported by a scaffolding structure. The image itself depicts a futuristic public sculpture, an ‘impossible’ artwork, referencing Ballard’s descriptions in his book ‘Vermillion Sands’. The work also draws upon examples of rococo ornamentation and the compositional conventions of ‘images of sculpture’ (in art magazines, catalogues, publicity photos) including examples sited in Regents park in previous years. Technical details: The image is printed on vinyl, stretched over a 14 x 28 ft (4. 2 x 8. 4 m) wooden stretcher and fixed to a deep buttressed scaffold 8 m long by 6. 23 deep with IBC water tanks on the back edge as <b>kentledge</b> (4 x I tonne IVC water containers - 1 per bay). The structure is constructed from clean silver Layher system scaffold and wrapped by a dense black mesh netting. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} cater for the {{economic}} development of the outlying areas in Hong Kong, the KCRC West Rail project was proposed. This major infrastructure project requires deep foundation along the route, and a more economic and rational design approach was to be justified by conducting full-scale pile load tests. The lateral load tests on three single piles and three pile groups provided a precious opportunity to investigate the analysis of laterally loaded large-diameter bored piles. The design of a laterally loaded pile is usually carried out using elastic continuum method (Poulos 1980) and p-y method (Reese et al. 1974). These two common design methods have their own pros and cons, however, they share the common difficulty of selecting proper soil parameters for reliable prediction. In this research, the test results were thoroughly interpreted using a newly proposed simple technique. They were then compared with predictions using the common design methods, in order to study {{the applicability of the}} common design methods on the large-diameter bored piles and the suitable choice of parameters for soils in Hong Kong. The behaviour of laterally loaded test piles was examined in more details using numerical analysis. Firstly, a laterally loaded single pile was simulated using a 3 D finite difference program (FLAC 3 D) to investigate the effect of the construction sequence and the <b>kentledge</b> loading on the soil and pile behaviour. Secondly, a parametric analysis of a pile group was conducted using a 3 D analytical program (FLPIER) to investigate the effect of the axial soil response and the pile cap effectiveness on the group pile behaviour. In routine design, concrete cracking is usually considered using constant cracked pile stiffness along the whole pile length. This might resulting in overpredicted deflections and underestimated maximum bending moments. Hence, a simple technique, which incorporates the nonlinear concrete behaviour, is proposed to interpret the measured rotations along the pile lengths. The technique involves iterative procedures to make a best-fit to the measured rotation by using a fourth-order polynomial to represent the soil reaction profile and then carrying out integration. This technique can be used to back-analyse the values of angle of shearing resistance (φ') and constant of horizontal subgrade reaction (nh) for the p-y curves suggested by Reese et al. (1974). It is found that the two parameters vary linearly with the SPT 'N' values in logarithmic scale (i. e. φ' = 10 logN+ 27; nh = 40 logN- 28). In addition, the comparisons between the measured test results and the predictions using the cornmon design methods for the single piles show that, both design methods give reasonable prediction for soils in Hong Kong provided that an appropriate choice of parameters is used. For the analysis of the pile groups, it is found that the deduced nh values, based on the experimental results on driven piles (e. g. Elson 1984), can also be applied to bored piles, especially at low loads. According to the numerical results of the single pile, the idealised construction sequence changes the directions of principal soil stresses at {{the upper part of the}} pile, but it does not have obvious effect on the behaviour of the laterally loaded pile. With a 30 MN <b>kentledge</b> loading placed around the pile before the lateral load test, the pile subjected to lateral loads deflects 15 % smaller than the one without <b>kentledge</b> loading. Furthermore, the parametric analysis of the pile group revealed that the soil axial response is found to be important in governing the lateral response of the pile group only when the ultimate shaft resistance is so low that it determines the failure mode of the group pile (i. e. tensile failure), rather than the structural capacity of the pile. Due to the reduction of pile cap effectiveness (in terms of the rotational stiffness and ultimate moment resistance), the lateral deflection increases, both group piles move upward and the location of the maximum bending moment changes from the pile head to some depth below the ground surface...|$|E
40|$|An open-dug caisson shaft {{is a form}} of {{top-down}} {{construction in}} which a concrete shaft is sunk into the ground using the weight of the shaft and additional <b>kentledge,</b> if required. Excavation {{at the base of the}} caisson shaft wall allows the structure to descend through the ground. A thorough understanding of the interaction between the caisson shaft and soil is essential to maintain controlled sinking of the caisson. In this paper, the failure mechanisms developed beneath caisson blades in sand are investigated. A series of laboratory tests were carried out at the University of Oxford to explore how varying blade angles affect the performance of the bearing capacity beneath the caisson. Cutting angles of 30 °, 45 °, 60 °, 75 ° and 90 ° (flat) were penetrated into sand under plane strain conditions; forces were monitored using a Cambridge-type load cell while soil displacements were recorded using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) techniques. The aim of this study is to understand how the soil failure mechanism develops and to determine the optimum cutting angle. The results of the laboratory tests can be scaled to predict the likely behaviour in the field. Results show that the bearing capacity is significantly dependent on the cutting angle; in a dense sand a steep cutting angle may be used to aid sinking of the caisson...|$|E
40|$|Five pile {{tests have}} been performed, {{at the west}} coast of Mexico, in order to {{evaluate}} their pile bearing capacity. The <b>Kentledge</b> system (a test pile loaded in between two tension piles) has been used to execute the pile tests. The soil stratigraphy has been surveyed with standard penetration tests, cone penetration tests and borings, and consists of a ten to twelve meter soft clayey soil on top of a hard clay layer. Three identical pile tests have been performed on bored piles with a pile diameter of 0. 6 m and a pile length of 30 m. In addition, two identical pile tests have been performed on driven piles with a squared cross section of 0. 5 m × 0. 5 m and a pile length of about 21 m. The aims of these tests were, first to evaluate the pile bearing capacity for both the bored and the driven pile types, in order to decide which pile type will be used finally, for the foundation of a factory; and second, to study the influence of the pile installation process on the pile bearing capacity of both pile types. During the testing of the bored piles, load measurements in different sections of the pile suggested that almost all bearing capacity came from the pile section in the upper soft clay layer. Since it is impossible to have such a relative large friction along the pile shaft in the soft soil, and because far more concrete was used for making the pile than expected, it had to be concluded that the liquid concrete has widened the pile diameter just above the hard soil layer, leading to a bulking effect in the pile. Therefore, the pile was leaning on this hard soil layer. For the driven test piles, the measurements showed a normal behaviour of both the pile shaft friction and the pile tip bearing capacity...|$|E
