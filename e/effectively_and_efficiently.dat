But by now the horses were gone and the dog had died. He was eating less and drinking more. One night, he fell down the stairs. He was discovered the next morning on the floor by his housekeeper. He was rushed to the local hospital where pneumonia in one lung was treated <b>effectively</b> <b>and</b> <b>efficiently,</b> a fracture near his hip was repaired and he was diagnosed with brain damage. We were to learn he had Korsakoff's syndrome (an alcohol-related condition) and we decided to keep it private.|$|E

For example, in November 2003, Wotton's letter to the editor praised the decision to dissolve the Palm Island Aboriginal Council, since it would allow Palm Island [...] "to adopt the very principles and practice of good governance and to see it <b>effectively</b> <b>and</b> <b>efficiently</b> discharged for the benefit of all in our community." [...] In March 2004, he wrote an open letter to the recently reelected official Mike Reynolds, requesting an explanation as to why the jetty at Arcadia Bay received part of a massive injection of state money whereas no state funds were allocated for the dilapidated Palm Island jetty, even though 86 per cent of the Palm Island vote went to Reynolds. At the end of March, Wotton was one of eight candidates for the new Palm Island Community Council.|$|E

In particular, the Ryan plan {{tightened}} eligibility requirements for Pell Grants and froze the maximum Pell Grant award at the then-current level. According to an analysis by the Education Trust, this {{would have resulted in}} more than 1 million students losing Pell Grants over the next 10 years. Additionally, under Ryan's plan, student loans would have begun to accrue interest while students were still in school. Ryan stated that his education policy is to [...] "allocate our limited financial resources <b>effectively</b> <b>and</b> <b>efficiently</b> to improve education". Jordan Weissmann of The Atlantic said that Ryan's vision on education policy is to [...] "cut and privatize". National Education Association President Dennis Van Roekel criticized Ryan's positions on education in 2012 saying: [...] "By selecting Ryan, Romney has doubled down on his view that opportunity is only for those who can afford it or are willing to game the system. He’s shown yet again that he is more willing to help the rich get richer than ensuring middle class families get ahead." ...|$|E

Many CSPs can be <b>effectively</b> {{represented}} <b>and</b> <b>efficiently</b> solved using matrix models, {{in which}} the matrices may have symmetry between their rows and/or columns. Eliminating all such symmetry can be very costly as there are in general exponentially many symmetries. Cost-effective methods have been proposed to break much of the symmetry, if not all. In this paper, we continue with this line of research, and propose several symmetry-breaking constraints. Experimental results confirm their value. ...|$|R
