40|$|With the {{continuing}} trend of decreasing feature sizes in <b>flip-chip</b> <b>assemblies,</b> the reliability tolerance to interfacial flaws is also decreasing. Small-scale disbonds {{will become more}} of a concern, pointing to the need for {{a better understanding of the}} initiation stage of interfacial delamination. With most accepted adhesion metric methodologies tailored to predict failure under the prior existence of a disbond, the study of the initiation phenomenon is open to development and standardization of new testing procedures. Traditional fracture mechanics approaches are not suitable, as the mathematics assume failure to originate at a disbond or crack tip. Disbond initiation is believed to first occur at free edges and corners, which act as high stress concentration sites and exhibit singular stresses similar to a crack tip, though less severe in intensity. As such, a 'fracture mechanics-like' approach may be employed which defines a material parameter [...] a critical stress intensity factor (K{sub c}) [...] that can be used to predict when initiation of a disbond at an interface will occur. The factors affecting the adhesion of underfill/polyimide interfaces relevant to <b>flip-chip</b> <b>assemblies</b> were investigated in this study. The study consisted of two distinct parts: a comparison of the initiation and propagation phenomena and a comparison of the relationship between sub-critical and critical initiation of interfacial failure. The initiation of underfill interfacial failure was studied by characterizing failure at a free-edge with a critical stress intensity factor. In comparison with the interfacial fracture toughness testing, it was shown that a good correlation exists between the initiation and propagation of interfacial failures. Such a correlation justifies {{the continuing}} use of fracture mechanics to predict the reliability of flip-chip packages. The second aspect of the research involved fatigue testing of tensile butt joint specimens to determine lifetimes at sub-critical load levels.

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{steadily}} increasing interest in using electrically conductive adhesives as interconnecting materials in electronics manufacturing. Simple processing, low bonding temperature and fine-pitch capability are the major advantages of conducting adhesive technology. Tin/lead soldering technology is widely used in today's electronics manufacturing. Lead is, however, a toxic element, and is a well-known hazard to human health. Lead-free interconnecting materials are urgently needed and polymeric conductive adhesives {{are likely to be}} one of the best alternatives for tin/lead solders. Anisotropic Conductive Adhesives (ACAs) provide both electrical as well as mechanical interconnections. This type of conductive adhesives conducts only in one direction, namely in the vertical direction. The conductive particles used include pure metals such as gold, silver or nickel, or metal-coated particles with plastic or glass cores. The fine pitch and low processing temperature are the primary reason for the growing use of anisotropic conductive adhesives. Flip-chip bonding technology with ACAs has attracted significant interest in the area of microelectronics packaging. It has potential possibilities to offer low processing temperature, low cost, and capability of dealing with fine pitch. However, there is still a large concern about the reliability issues of these materials. One major concern is the poor adhesion strength of the adhesive joint; the other is contact resistance shift. The function of the ACA is to give the mechanical strength and electrical path of the joint. In recent years, extensive studies have been conducted for conductive adhesives in various areas such as joint reliability, electrical properties and microstructure development, and joint residual stress analysis. It is well known that the use of adhesives can increase fatigue life in <b>flip-chip</b> <b>assemblies,</b> hence improve reliability. Unfortunately, the use of adhesives results also in the formation of weak interfaces that tend to delaminate during thermal cycling. Delamination is therefore a major concern in microelectronic package (<b>flip-chip</b> <b>assemblies)</b> when using conductive adhesives.

When micron-sized filler particles are introduced in no-flow underfills to enhance the solder bump reliability, such filler particles could prevent the solder bumps making reliable electrical contacts with the substrate pads during solder reflow, and therefore, the assembly yield would be adversely affected. The use of nano-sized filler particles can potentially improve assembly yield while offering the advantages associated with filled underfill materials. The objective of this thesis is to study the thermo-mechanical reliability of nano-filled epoxy underfills (NFU) through experiments and theoretical modeling. In this work, the thermo-mechanical properties of NFUs with 20 -nm filler particles have been measured. An innovative residual stress test method has been developed to measure the interfacial fracture toughness. Using the developed residual stress method and the single-leg bending test, the mode-mixity-dependent fracture toughness for NFU-SiN interface has been determined. In addition to such monotonic interfacial fracture characterization, the interface crack propagation under thermo-mechanical fatigue loading has been experimentally characterized, and a model for fatigue interface crack propagation has been developed. A test vehicle comprising of several flip chips was assembled using the NFU material and the reliability of the <b>flip-chip</b> <b>assemblies</b> was assessed under thermal shock cycles between - 40 oC and 125 oC. The NFU-SiN interfacial delamination propagation and the solder bump reliability were monitored. In parallel, numerical models were developed to study the interfacial delamination propagation in the flip chip assembly using conventional interfacial fracture mechanics as well as cohesive zone modeling. Predictions for interfacial delamination propagation using the two approaches have been compared. Based on the theoretical models and the experimental data, guidelines for design of NFUs against interfacial delamination have been developed. Ph. D.

The rapid uptake of flip-chip technology within the electronics industry, is placing the reliability of such assemblies under increasing scrutiny. A key feature of the assembly process is the application of underfill to reinforce the attachment of the die to the printed circuit board. This has been identified in numerous studies as one of the major ways in which the reliability of the devices can be improved, by mitigating the coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch between chip and board. However, in order for the underfill to be effective in coupling the die to the circuit board, its adhesion to the passivation layer of the die and the solder mask layer on the PCB must be maximised. There is a growing body of literature that indicates that poor adhesion at either interface (delamination) as a result of contamination can result in premature failure of the assembly through stress fracture of the solder joints. In order to investigate further the effect of delamination on the reliability of <b>flip-chip</b> <b>assemblies,</b> surface chemistry has been used to control the adhesion of the underfill to the die passivation. This paper reports how modification of the die surface by the application of a low surface energy coating, which prevents the strong adhesion of the underfill, has enabled the selective delamination of the device at the chip-to-underfill interface. Using scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) the effectiveness of this treatment in creating controlled delamination before and after thermal cycling has been monitored. The ability to engineer delamination, can enable experimental studies of the mechanics of flip chip assembly failure, which complement current finite element modelling work...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{stress in}} <b>flip-chip</b> (FC) <b>assemblies</b> {{continues}} to be a significant problem both for the reliability of the component and for the assembly of a flat component to the next board-level assembly. The component co-planarity must meet or be below the JEDEC standard. This work describes the combination of unique low-temperature multi-step curing profiles with the use of Variable Frequency Microwaves to produce lower warpage components both on the die side of the package {{as well as on the}} board carrier side. This lower warpage is maintained even after three sequential lead-free solder reflow conditions. Statistical data supports this increased co-planarity by Shadow Moiré measurements at various stages of processing from as-received parts through prebake, cure, and three-times reflow. Typical co-planarity improvements in the 12 to 65 percent range is observed and verified by confirmation sample sizes used for microwave cured parts and conventional box oven cured parts. Thinned die and reduced thickness substrate boards showed the most warpage improvement with VFM. Two under-fill chemistries (anhydride and hybrid) show the same effect despite lower cure temperatures and faster cure cycle times. The mechanisms responsible for the improvements in mechanical properties of the under-fills are discussed...|$|R
