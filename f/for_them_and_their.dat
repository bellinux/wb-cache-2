5|$|Despite the {{circumstances}} of the separation, Holopainen's appreciation of Turunen as an artist remained. He explained that he did not search for a similarly trained singer as a successor for Turunen because he considers her to be extraordinarily good in her genre and therefore irreplaceable. Turunen {{said in an interview that}} she is very proud of her career with Nightwish. She considers the remaining band members extremely talented and wishes all the best <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> subsequent lead singer Anette Olzon.|$|E
5|$|Drugs, devices, surgery, {{and other}} {{interventions}} exist to help men achieve erection and ejaculation. Although male fertility is reduced, many men with SCI can still father children, particularly with medical interventions. Women's fertility {{is not usually}} affected, although precautions must be taken for safe pregnancy and delivery. People with SCI need to take measures during sexual activity to deal with SCI effects such as weakness and movement limitations, and to avoid injuries such as skin damage in areas of reduced sensation. Education and counseling about sexuality {{is an important part}} of SCI rehabilitation but is often missing or insufficient. Rehabilitation for children and adolescents aims to promote healthy development of sexuality and includes education <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> families. Culturally inherited biases and stereotypes negatively affect people with SCI, particularly when held by professional caregivers. Body image and other insecurities affect sexual function, and have profound repercussions on self-esteem and self-concept. SCI causes difficulties in romantic partnerships, due to problems with sexual function and to other stresses introduced by the injury and disability, but many of those with SCI have fulfilling relationships and marriages. Relationships, self-esteem, and reproductive ability are all aspects of sexuality, which encompasses not just sexual practices but a complex array of factors: cultural, social, psychological, and emotional influences.|$|E

25|$|In Guaduas, Policarpa {{was known}} as a revolutionary. Because she was not known in Bogotá, she could move freely and meet with other patriots and spies unsuspected. She could also {{infiltrate}} the homes of the royalists. Offering her services as a seamstress to the wives and daughters of royalists and officers, Policarpa altered and mended <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> families; {{at the same time she}} overheard conversations, collected maps and intelligence on their plans and activities, identified who the major royalists were, and found out who were suspected of being revolutionaries.|$|E
25|$|Dozens of {{petitions}} {{for freedom}} were filled {{on the basis}} that the petitioner was descended from a free woman, and so, by law, was entitled to freedom.

25|$|Blacks cleared land, selling {{timber and}} {{developing}} bottomland to achieve ownership. In 1900, two-thirds of farm owners in Mississippi were blacks, a major achievement <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> families. Due {{to the poor}} economy, low cotton prices and difficulty of getting credit, many of these farmers could not {{make it through the}} extended financial difficulties. Two decades later, the majority of African Americans were sharecroppers. The low prices of cotton into the 1890s meant that more than a generation of African Americans lost the result of their labor when they had to sell their farms to pay off accumulated debts.|$|E
25|$|The key is {{that while}} {{men and women are}} equally {{effective}} foragers, mothers carrying dependent children are not effective hunters. They must thus depend on male hunters. This favors a system in which males have exclusive sexual access to females, and females can predict that their sexual partner will provide food <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> children. In most mammalian species the result is a system of rank or sexual competition that results in either polygyny, or lifelong pair-bonding between two individuals who live relatively independent of other adults of their species; in both cases male aggression {{plays an important role in}} maintaining sexual access to mate(s).|$|E

25|$|Nelson {{emigrated from}} Shanghai to the Dutch East Indies by 1927, {{when he is}} {{recorded}} as a cashier at the Miss Riboet's Orion drama troupe owned by Tio Tek Djien; Wong Siong Tek may have been preaching in the area as well. Tio, later learning that Wong had experience in film, asked him to record the troupe's performances. Nelson did so, using a simple camera. The ability to make films convinced Tio that a feature film would be a profitable venture; the country's first domestically produced film, Loetoeng Kasaroeng, had been released in 1926. Nelson agreed, but only {{on the condition that}} Tio bring his brothers to the Indies. Tio helped the younger Wongs immigrate, spending several thousand gulden for transportation <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> equipment.|$|E
25|$|Chandris Line was a Greece-based {{shipping}} company founded in 1960 by Antony Chandris to operate ocean liners between Greece and Australia. Initially {{the company also}} traded under the names Greek Australian Line, National Greek Australian Line and Europe-Australia Line. Following a period of expansion, in 1974 Chandris Line merged with Chandris Cruises—a separate company founded in 1960 by Anthony Chandris' brother Dimitri Chandris to operate cruises in the Mediterranean—to form Chandris Line Chandris Cruises. After 1977 the company concentrated solely on cruising and was rebranded Chandris Cruises. In 1985 Chandris Cruises acquired Fantasy Cruises, and subsequently their North American operations were rebranded as Chandris Fantasy Cruises. The company ceased trading in 1996. All of the company's ships had a chi, a letter of the Greek alphabet, on their funnels. The chi also acted as a logo <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> subsidiary Celebrity Cruises.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the commissioners}} were {{responsible}} for the regulatory framework within which the Poor Law Unions operated, each union was run by a locally elected board of guardians, comprising representatives from each of the participating parishes, assisted by six ex officio members. The guardians were usually farmers or tradesmen, and as one of their roles was the contracting out of the supply of goods to the workhouse the position could prove lucrative <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> friends.

500|$|During season six production, {{residents}} of Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, complained that noise levels and swearing were unbearable and inappropriate <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> children {{to listen to}} during the night. The residents called local law enforcement agencies {{four or five times}} to deal with the late-night disturbances. Clarissa Keller, a Sherman Oaks resident, complained that she had a six-year-old son and didn't want him to listen to the swearing. She set up a petition calling for a ban on all production companies in the Sherman Oaks hills. Location managers and production crew declined to discuss the neighbors' complaints. The Bad Girls Club permit required the entire production to abide by a [...] "minimum outdoor activity and noise" [...] rule, but local residents claimed that the show did not keep noise levels down. The house for season six was rented for $20,000 a month. The owner said that he would not allow this type of production to rent his home in the future.|$|E
500|$|Wolves bear {{relatively}} large pups in small litters {{compared to other}} canid species. The average litter consists of 5–6 pups, with litter sizes tending to increase in areas where prey is abundant, though exceptionally large litters of 14–17 pups occur only 1% of the time. Pups are usually born in spring, coinciding with a corresponding increase in prey populations. Pups are born blind and deaf, and are covered in short soft grayish-brown fur. They weigh [...] at birth, and begin to see after 9–12 days. The milk canines erupt after one month. Pups first leave the den after 3 weeks. At 1.5 months of age, they are agile enough to flee from danger. Mother wolves do not leave the den {{for the first few}} weeks, relying on the fathers to provide food <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> young. Pups begin to eat solid food at the age of 3–4 weeks. Pups have a fast growth rate during their first four months of life: during this period, a pup's weight can increase nearly 30 times. Wolf pups begin play fighting at the age of 3 weeks, though unlike young foxes and coyotes, their bites are inhibited. Actual fights to establish hierarchy usually occur at 5–8 weeks of age. This is in contrast to young foxes and coyotes, which may begin fighting even before the onset of play behavior. By autumn, the pups are mature enough to accompany adults on hunts for large prey.|$|E
