50|$|Often, catch weight <b>fights</b> <b>are</b> still {{considered}} <b>fights</b> within a formal weight class. For example, when Manny Pacquiao fought Miguel Cotto, the <b>fight</b> <b>was</b> at a catch weight of 145 pounds to accommodate Pacquiao's smaller physique. Boxing has a junior welterweight weight {{class with a}} weight limit of 140 and a welterweight weight class with a weight limit of 147. Since the <b>fight</b> <b>was</b> under the 147 limit and above the 140 limit, the <b>fight</b> <b>was</b> considered a welterweight fight {{as well as being}} considered a catch weight fight. In addition, the World Boxing Organization sanctioned this fight for the welterweight title since the <b>fight</b> <b>was</b> under the welterweight limit.|$|R

5|$|In {{the eastern}} Baltic region of Livonia, people {{designated}} as werewolves went underground {{in the shape}} of dogs to fight against sorcerers who stole the shoots of the grain. If the werewolves failed to wrest the shoots, there would be famine. In Romania, strigoi were people born with a caul, which they donned upon reaching adulthood; this made them invisible. They then travelled in animal form to the meadow {{at the end of the}} world. There they fought each other all night, becoming reconciled in the morning. The reason for the <b>fight</b> <b>is</b> not specified. The Circassians told that, on a certain night of the year, their sorcerers fought with the sorcerers of the Abkhaz people, trying to suck each other's blood.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil 5 (2009) {{is set in}} {{the fictional}} African town of Kijuju in 2009, where a {{biological}} agent has turned local residents into zombies. Valentine has been missing since a fight with her commander-turned-double agent Albert Wesker, years before the game's events. The <b>fight</b> <b>is</b> shown in the game's Lost in Nightmares downloadable content (DLC), in which Redfield and Valentine search for Umbrella's founder, Ozwell E. Spencer, inside a mansion {{on the edge of a}} cliff. Instead they find Wesker, who overpowers them. To save Redfield, Valentine tackles Wesker, and they both crash through a window and over the cliff. Their bodies are not recovered, and Valentine is declared dead. In fact she was injured by the fall and saved by Wesker, who then used her as a test subject in his experiments on mutagenic viruses.|$|E
5|$|The sixth contest was a Tag Team Street Fight pitting {{the team}} of Monty Brown and The Outlaw against the 3Live Kru (Konnan and Ron Killings).

5|$|The thin {{long legs}} of the {{hartebeest}} provide for a quick escape in an open habitat; if attacked, the formidable horns are used {{to ward off the}} predator. The elevated position of the eyes enables the hartebeest to inspect its surroundings continuously even as it is grazing. The muzzle has evolved so as to derive maximum nutrition from even a frugal diet. The horns are also used during fights among males for dominance in the breeding season; the clash of the horns is loud enough that it can be heard from hundreds of metres away. The beginning of a <b>fight</b> <b>is</b> marked with a series of head movements and stances, as well as depositing droppings on dung piles. The opponents drop onto their knees and, after giving a hammer-like blow, begin wrestling, their horns interlocking. One attempts to fling the head of the other to one side to stab the neck and shoulders with his horns. Fights are rarely serious, but can be fatal if they are.|$|E

The camera cuts to a scene of Jackson lying on a bed, revealing he's the one singing contemplating the senseless violence. The singer notices rival gangs and leaves. Michael Jackson dons a red leather J. Parks brand jacket, and dances his way towards the fight through the diner and pool hall. A knife <b>fight</b> <b>is</b> taking place between the two gang leaders in a warehouse. They dance battle for an interlude of music until MJ arrives; the singer breaks up the fight and launches into a dance routine. The video ends with the gang members joining him in the dance, agreeing that violence is not the solution to their problems.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, {{the party}} comes to {{discover}} that the Crystals formed a seal upon Exdeath, an ancient sorcerer; with them destroyed, not only would the dark essence be released, but over time the planet itself would become uninhabitable. The party attempts to save the crystals of Water, Fire, and Earth; but by the machinations of human folly or the influence of the sealed Exdeath, they fail. Having been freed, Exdeath defeats the party and returns to his homeworld. Galuf's granddaughter Krile arrives by meteorite, restoring Galuf's memory completely; he recalls he originated from the same world as Exdeath, pursuing him back home with Krile. Bartz and the others resolve that the <b>fight</b> <b>is</b> not Galuf's alone, together traveling to the distant planet world, where Exdeath is already wreaking havoc in pursuit of that world's Crystals. The trio is captured, but Galuf rescues them and defeats Exdeath's lieutenant, Gilgamesh, in the process. They are blown to a distant continent when a magical barrier is activated during their escape, but make their way to Bal Castle, Galuf's kingdom.|$|E
5|$|His first {{appearance}} outside Final Fantasy VII {{was as a}} selectable character in the fighting game Ehrgeiz. A redesigned Sephiroth also appears in the North American and European versions of Kingdom Hearts as an optional boss character in Olympus Coliseum. Lance Bass voiced Sephiroth in this game, while in subsequent titles he was replaced by George Newbern. In the Japanese re-release of the game, Final Mix, an additional scene was added in which Sephiroth fights Cloud, although {{the result of the}} <b>fight</b> <b>is</b> not revealed. Sephiroth {{was not included in the}} sequel , as director Tetsuya Nomura could not give him a storyline related to Cloud, and he feared negative fan response if Sephiroth did not have a notable role in the story. His third appearance outside Final Fantasy VII is as another optional boss in Kingdom Hearts II, where he is first encountered by the series' protagonist, Sora, and then Cloud, who is pursuing him. When Sephiroth battles Cloud, both of them disappear, with Sora believing that they went somewhere else to continue their fight. Nomura said that in this game, Sephiroth represents Cloud's dark side, in contrast to Tifa Lockhart, who represents his light side. Although Sephiroth does not appear in the prequel Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, he is mentioned as a hero that Zack Fair aspires to be. The staff, however, did not know if they would portray him as a being of darkness as shown in other titles. Sephiroth's fourth outside appearance is in the Itadaki Street games Special and Portable, where he appears as an unlockable playable character. Due to Sephiroth's many appearances as a boss in the Kingdom Hearts series, Square Enix is not sure whether he will return in Kingdom Hearts III as it would be redundant.|$|E
5|$|John Gilchriese {{became friends}} with John Flood, who had been Wyatt Earp‚Äôs secretary, confidante, and best friend for many years. When Earp died, Flood {{inherited}} many of his personal belongings. Flood in turn willed them to Gilchriese, who amassed {{over a number of}} years one of the largest collections of personal items belonging to Wyatt and Virgil Earp, along with many unpublished photos of them and their family. Gilchriese opened the Wyatt Earp Museum in Tombstone in 1966 and commissioned Western artist Don Perceval to paint the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. The oil on masonite painting titled The Street <b>Fight</b> <b>is</b> 6 feet 4 inches by 4 feet (1.93 m by 1.22 m). It was the largest work ever executed by Perceval. He referred to original documents in Gilchriese's collection, including Wyatt Earp's own diagram of the shootout, and unpublished notes made by John Flood, to create what is regarded as the most accurate depiction of the shootout. Gilchreise had 500 lithographic prints reproduced from the original, which Perceval signed. The prints were sold by the museum for $10.|$|E

5|$|The Six Man Tag Team Street Fight {{between the}} team of Jay Lethal and MCMG (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin) and {{the team of}} Johnny Devine and Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray). The {{stipulation}}s were if Lethal and MCMG won then Team 3D {{would be forced to}} work with a weight limit, while if Devine and Team 3D won the TNA X Division would dissemble. Another added stipulation before the contest was whoever gained the pinfall would win the TNA X Division Championship. It lasted twelve minutes and thirty seconds. A Street <b>Fight</b> <b>is</b> fought under no disqualification and no count-out rules, with weapons legal and provided for the match. During the final minutes, both Sabin and Shelley were scripted to appear unconscious at ringside, which caused Lethal to have to fight off Devine and Team 3D alone. Near the end of the match Team 3D set up a table; Lethal followed by sending both out of the ring and laying Devine over the table. Lethal then stood {{on the top of a}} padded turnbuckle and jumped off to perform an elbow drop on Devine through the table to win the match. With the victory, Lethal won the TNA X Division Championship, prevented the X Division from disbanding, and forced Team 3D to work with a weight limit in the company.|$|E
5|$|The Sole Survivor investigates a pre-War {{amusement}} park, Nuka-World, when radio advertisements are broadcast {{into the}} Commonwealth. Porter Gage, a veteran raider, contacts the Sole Survivor after boarding a monorail and tells {{them that they}} are walking into a death trap. Upon arrival, the Sole Survivor must navigate an increasingly-deadly obstacle course called the Gauntlet, which culminates in a fight with the raider leader, Overboss Colter. Gage reveals that the <b>fight</b> <b>is</b> rigged as Colter is wearing invulnerable electrically-charged armor, and that no-one survives the Gauntlet. Gage aids the Sole Survivor by helping them exploit the Achilles heel in Colter's armor, becoming the first person to survive the Gauntlet. Following the death of Colter, Gage explains the leaders of the three raider gangs conspired to usurp him, using the broadcast and the Gauntlet to find possible replacements. The Sole Survivor is offered to become the Overboss, but must balance the competing needs of each gang of raiders while conquering the outlying areas of the park. Once the entire park is under raider control, the Sole Survivor sets about expanding raider influence in the Commonwealth by conquering settlements, restoring power to Nuka-World to make the park self-sufficient, and thwarting attempts by the Gunnersa band of amoral mercenariesto seize control of Nuka-World for themselves.|$|E
