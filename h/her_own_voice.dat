25|$|Nevertheless, {{details of}} how the Pythia {{operated}} are missing as authors from the classical period (6th to 4th centuries BC) treat the process as common knowledge with no need to explain. Those who discussed the oracle in any detail are from 1st century BC to 4th century AD and give conflicting stories. One of the main stories claimed that the Pythia delivered oracles in a frenzied state induced by vapours rising from a chasm in the rock, and that she spoke gibberish which priests interpreted as the enigmatic prophecies and turned them into poetic dactylic hexameters preserved in Greek literature. This idea, however, has been challenged by scholars such as Joseph Fontenrose and Lisa Maurizio, who argue that the ancient sources uniformly represent the Pythia speaking intelligibly, and giving prophecies in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>voice.</b> Herodotus, writing in the fifth century BC describes the Pythia speaking in dactylic hexameters.|$|E

500|$|In {{the context}} of the film, [...] "Listen" [...] is a 1975 song that Deena records on Rainbow Records, a {{recording}} empire established by Curtis. [...] She is actually recording the song in a booth as a track, but the song also reveals Deena's growing disgust at being considered merely Curtis' property. Used in the film as a last-minute recording by Deena before leaving Curtis [...] "to find <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>voice</b> as a newly independent woman", co-writer Anne Preven called [...] "Listen" [...] a song which [...] "Deena is exclaiming, 'You don't know who I am, and I know I do.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The same year, Cardinale portrayed {{a prostitute}} in La ragazza di Bube or Bebo's Girl, {{in which she}} also used <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>voice.</b> For her {{performance}} in the film, she received her first Nastro d'Argento for Best Actress in 1965. Cardinale acted in her first American film (although it was produced in Italy) when she played Princess Dala, a wealthy aristocratic woman who is the love and jewellery interest of David Niven in the Cortina d'Ampezzo-set The Pink Panther. Cardinale's voice in the film was dubbed by Gale Garnett, who went uncredited. Niven raved about working with the actress, telling her, [...] "After spaghetti, you're Italy's happiest invention." ...|$|E
500|$|Since poetry {{was highly}} stylized, it is {{difficult}} to determine when a poet speaking as a woman actually was a woman, or a man speaking as a woman. This adds to the difficulty of attribution, especially of anonymous writers. There is some debate as to whether or not the poems by the trobairitz represent genuine feminine voices, since they worked within the highly circumscribed conventions of the troubadours. Matilda Bruckner suggests that the trobairitz [...] "spoke in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>voice</b> as channeled through the voices of many others". By manipulating the strict constructs of troubadour lyric, the trobairitz were able to create their own [...] "fictions of the female voice".|$|E

Gothic novels also explore the position {{of women in the}} home and family. Laurence incorporates Gothic conventions but modifies them, allowing her heroine, Rachel, to find <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>voice(s)</b> and escape from the guilt, shame, and imprisonment of her past...|$|R
500|$|Until now, Cardinale's {{own voice}} {{had not been}} used in her Italian films, as it was {{considered}} too hoarse, and owing to [...] her French accent, insufficiently Italian. Not until 8½ was she allowed to use <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>voice.</b> Cardinale explained: [...] "When I arrived for my first movie, I couldn't speak a word. I thought I was on the moon. I couldn't understand {{what they were talking}} about. And I was speaking in French; in fact I was dubbed. And Federico Fellini was the first one who used my voice. I think I had a very strange voice." [...] With her portrayal of Angelica in The Leopard and her brief appearance as herself in 8½, Cardinale achieved the definitive status of a top-ranking star.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} of the English version of the anime stated that Naruto {{was the most difficult}} character to cast, adding that Maile Flanagan [...] "has Naruto down, from the mischievous side, that precocious twelve-year-old we learn to love, to the serious side". Flanagan avoided listening to Junko Takeuchi's performance as {{she did not want to}} imitate it, stating she wanted to develop <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>voice</b> for the character. Her performance has been praised as showing Naruto's brashness and later growth in confidence. [...] In a 2014 interview, Flanagan claimed she had never heard of Naruto before her audition. She looked the show up after being chosen and felt the release of the English dub would be popular. She is recognized more for her work voicing Naruto than from other roles she has done in her career, although some fans did not expect that Naruto would be voiced by a woman.|$|E
500|$|Her family made a {{down payment}} on their own home in Humboldt Park, a {{predominantly}} Puerto Rican neighborhood on Chicago's West Side when she was eleven years old. This neighborhood and its characters would later become the inspiration for Cisneros's novel The House on Mango Street. For high school, Cisneros attended Josephinum Academy, a small Catholic all-girls school. Here she found an ally in a high-school teacher who helped her to write poems about the Vietnam War. Although Cisneros had written her first poem around the age of ten, with her teacher's encouragement she became known for her writing throughout her high-school years. In high school she wrote poetry and was the literary magazine editor, but, according to herself, she did not really start writing until her first creative writing class in college in 1974. After that it took a while to find <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>voice.</b> She explains, [...] "I rejected what was at hand and emulated the voices of the poets I admired in books: big male voices like James Wright and Richard Hugo and Theodore Roethke, all wrong for me." ...|$|E

Mario and Luigi then battle Cackletta and defeat her. Cackletta is severely incapacitated from the battle, so Fawful sucks up her essence into his [...] "vacuum helmet" [...] to save her life. Cackletta then commands Fawful to attack, but he is stopped by Prince Peasley. The brothers locate the Beanstar but encounter Popple and Rookie again.

Bowser's arrival and presence at her castle had prevented Peach from revealing the plan to Mario and Luigi. Meanwhile, Fawful imbues a weak Bowser with Cackletta's soul, resulting in the twisted Bowletta.|$|E
500|$|Spence D. of IGN {{stated that}} [...] "the only draw for this album {{are the three}} new tracks and the three remixes." [...] He further commented that Most Wanted is a [...] "filler album" [...] and that [...] "he new songs that are served up still show Duff chasing trends rather than setting them and {{actively}} searching for <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>voice</b> and image." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine was critical of the album writing he [...] "literally laughed out loud when I heard the Duffster was releasing a best-of album titled Most Wanted." [...] He praised the Dead Executives produced tracks and concluded the review by writing that [...] "apparently there aren't even enough bearable moments in Duff's recording career to fill one CD". Gabriel Leong of MTV Southeast Asia started the review by writing [...] "A greatest hits album seems a tad flagrant when you've only had two albums so far. So let's call this one a compilation album instead." [...] Leong noted that the title fitted the album perfectly and that it proves [...] "its innocuous appeal of infectious bubblegum pop." [...] David Hiltbrand of The Philadelphia Inquirer commented that it was [...] "a little early in the career" [...] to release a greatest hits album and that it showcased that [...] "Duff is more product than talent." [...] Aidin Vaziri of San Francisco Chronicle also commented that it was premature as {{it was too early}} in Duff's career to release a greatest hits compilation. He commended the new tracks produced by the Dead Executives writing that they [...] "help alleviate the feeling that this is a total cash grab." [...] In 2006, Rolling Stone included the album in their Lamest Greatest Hits Albums Ever list.|$|E
500|$|Disney had {{originally}} considered casting actress Jodi Benson, who famously voiced Ariel in The Little Mermaid, as Belle, but ultimately {{felt that she}} sounded [...] "too American" [...] and young, opting for a [...] "more classical ... womanly" [...] voice instead. Describing the character as [...] "a woman that was ahead of her time," [...] the filmmakers wanted Belle to sound [...] "more like a woman than a girl." [...] However, Benson voiced Belle in a few episodes of Disney's House of Mouse. Director Kirk Wise was particularly interested in casting an actress capable of [...] "creat a character completely with her voice", envisioning a voice {{similar to that of}} American entertainer Judy Garland. American actress and singer Paige O'Hara was performing on Broadway when she first read about Disney's then-upcoming animated project Beauty and the Beast in an article in The New York Times. Upon discovering that the studio was holding auditions for the lead role of Belle and, at the behest of lyricist Howard Ashman and composer Alan Menken, specifically recruiting Broadway performers, O'Hara immediately insisted that her agent get her an audition. Familiar with O'Hara's Broadway stint as Ellie May Chipley in the musical Show Boat; Ashman had already been eyeing O'Hara for the part. O'Hara auditioned for the role five times, competing against approximately 500 other actresses. First auditioning solely for casting director Albert Taveres, O'Hara's next two auditions simply required the actress to mail audio recordings of her voice to the studio in Los Angeles. Required to perform a song of her choice, O'Hara sang [...] "Heaven Help My Heart" [...] from the musical Chess. At her first legitimate audition, O'Hara spoke and sang in a higher register than her own in an effort to mimic Snow White from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, but the filmmakers insisted that she use <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>voice</b> instead. In addition to Ashman and Menken, O'Hara's last few auditions were attended by directors Wise and Gary Trousdale, and producers Katzenberg and Don Hahn. O'Hara recalled that the songwriters would first close their eyes and listen to her before finally watching her perform. An hour after her fifth and final audition, O'Hara received a telephone call from Disney on her birthday informing her that she had been cast. The actress was fairly confident that the role was hers before she was officially cast, and credits the fact that Ashman enjoyed her performance on the cast recording of the musical Show Boat. O'Hara admitted, [...] "I'm not usually confident about auditions ... but I just understood (Belle) so much." ...|$|E

Super Bowl producers have since admitted that they attempt to have all performers pre-record their vocals.

It {{is known that}} Rebecca Madison found her as a street urchin and offered her food, shelter and fame in {{exchange}} for her services for Maximum. Rebecca had her fitted with retractable mirrors which can focus light to such a strength that looking at the mirrors can overload the minds senses, tricking the publics minds into adoring her and on Maximums orders using them to completely brainwash certain people (it can be assumed that the mirrors are difficult to control with precision, as Vaingloria once accidentally sent a victim into a coma).
