500|$|The nest is {{in a tree}} cavity, {{usually an}} old {{woodpecker}} hole, but sometimes of natural origin. Occasionally the female will enlarge an <b>existing</b> <b>hole</b> in rotten wood. The nest site is typically [...] above the ground and has a deep base of pine bark or chips of other wood, rarely supplemented with dry plant material. If {{the entrance to the}} hole is too large, it is plastered with mud, clay and sometimes dung to make it smaller. A small entrance and large interior, together {{with the use of a}} deep layer of wood chips in which to bury the eggs and small young when the adults leave the nest, may be adaptations to reduce the chance of predation. Nests with small entrance holes are most successful. Locally, a small entrance may make it less likely that the nest will be taken over by common starlings. The female undertakes most of the work, and often plasters the inside of the cavity too, taking up to four weeks to complete the construction. A nest is often re-used in subsequent years.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are various}} types of boring. The boring bar may be {{supported}} on both ends (which only works if the <b>existing</b> <b>hole</b> is a through hole), {{or it may be}} supported at one end (which works for both through holes and blind holes).

50|$|Typically {{the wire}} is {{threaded}} through <b>existing</b> <b>holes</b> in the associated equipment, using a single strand loop, {{and a single}} crossover, such that the closure is secured without impedance to the normal functioning of the equipment. The single crossover provides the appropriate friction such that the wire cannot fall completely free of the equipment when broken. The loose ends of the strand may be twisted in a pigtail fashion, or crimped with a lead seal, securing both strands {{as close to the}} closure as practical. In each case, the loose ends of the strands should be tucked neatly away from inadvertent impact.|$|R
40|$|Animals of {{many species}} tend to target their {{foraging}} attempts toward particular microhabitats within their habitat. Although these preferences are critical determinants of the foraging niche and have important ecological and evolutionary implications, we {{know little about}} how they develop. Here, we use detailed longitudinal data from meerkats (Suricata suricatta) to examine how individual learning {{and the use of}} social information affect the development of foraging microhabitat preferences. Despite living in an open, arid environment, adult meerkats frequently foraged at the base of vegetation. Young pups seldom did so, but their foraging microhabitat choices became increasingly adult-like as they grew older. Learning about profitable microhabitats may have been promoted in part by positive reinforcement from prey capture. Foraging may also have become increasingly targeted toward suitable locations as pups grew older because they spent more time searching before embarking on foraging bouts. The development of microhabitat preferences might also have been influenced by social cues. Foraging in close proximity to adults may increase the probability that pups would dig in similar microhabitats. Also, pups often dug in holes created by older individuals, whereas adults never dug in <b>existing</b> <b>holes.</b> Foraging in <b>existing</b> <b>holes</b> was no more profitable to pups than creating their own foraging hole but could provide pups with important informational benefits. The integration of personal and social information {{is likely to be a}} common feature in the development of the foraging niche in generalist species.

40|$|AbstractThe {{behavior}} of a fluid supported membrane during hydrolysis by phospholipase A 2 is {{for the first time}} visualized by time-resolved fluorescence imaging. After a lag phase, hydrolysis proceeds from the boundary of <b>existing</b> <b>holes</b> and via nucleation of new holes. During subsequent hydrolysis, the shape of the membrane boundary is determined both by hydrolysis and by shape relaxations due to the action of line tension. This is manifested by the appearance of Rayleigh instabilities in membrane rims and by an effect analogous to domain coarsening in phase transitions in which membrane holes decay when they are within a certain distance from larger and expanding holes...|$|R

50|$|Lathe boring usually {{requires}} that the workpiece {{be held in the}} chuck and rotated. As the workpiece is rotated, a boring bar with an insert attached to the tip of the bar is fed into an <b>existing</b> <b>hole.</b> When the cutting tool engages the workpiece, a chip is formed.

50|$|A {{transfer}} punch is a punch (usually in {{an index}} set) {{of a specific}} outer diameter that is non-tapered and extends {{the entire length of}} the punch (except for the tip).

In 1925, the purchase of additional property prompted the club to recommission Tillinghast to incorporate the new land into the existing course. The course has remained relatively unchanged since its construction. A few outdated bunkers were replaced in 1965. Between 1991 and 1993 all the bunkers were restored and several tees were added. Among its many noted features, the course has distinctly narrow fairways.|$|R

5000|$|A back countersink, {{also known}} as an {{inserted}} countersink, is a two piece countersink used on tough to reach areas.

This is comparable to other types of [...] "back-" [...] machining, such as back-spotfacing, back-boring, back-counterboring, back-milling, and back-deburring. The common theme is accomplishing machining operations {{on the far side of}} the workpiece from the spindle face, which obviates a [...] "second operation" [...] setup. This reduces setup time and frustration in several ways. Not only does it obviate the flipping over, cleaning, reclamping, etc., but it also can allow effortless high concentricity, parallelism, and squareness with the first setup's datum without the hassle of reestablishing it on another setup (via indicating painstakingly).|$|E

It is in competition with other birds and animals for burrows. It can excavate its own hole or move into a pre-existing system dug by a rabbit and has been known to peck and drive off the original occupant. Manx shearwaters also nest underground and often live in their own burrows alongside puffins, and their burrowing activities may break through into the puffin's living quarters resulting in the loss of the egg. They are monogamous (they mate for life) and give biparental care to their young. The male spends more time guarding and maintaining the nest while the female is more involved in incubation and feeding the chick.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} a critical load for a nonuniform circular steel tube under eccentrically axial load. The circular tube has variable cross section at flattened ends with <b>existing</b> <b>holes</b> used for connection between members. Three different cases of eccentricities are studied with the drilled holes either on the same side or on the opposite side of column axis. The critical load is calculated from the differential equation of deflection curve which is solved by the power series and Runge-Kutta method. In addition, the loading tests were performed on a total of 180 specimens with different diameters, slenderness, and connection. The calculated results are compared and shown in a good agreement with those obtained from the experimental results. The results also show that the critical load decreases rapidly even at a small value of eccentricity and thus may have a significant effect on the load-carrying capacity...|$|R
