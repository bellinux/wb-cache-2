Because {{of the importance of}} solar energy as a renewable energy source, an accurate determination of significant covariates and their relationships with the amount of <b>global</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> reaching the Earth is a critical research problem. There are numerous meteorological and terrestrial covariates {{that can be used in}} the analysis of horizontal <b>global</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation.</b> Some of these covariates are highly correlated with each other. It is possible to find a large variety of linear or non-linear models to explain the amount of horizontal <b>global</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation.</b> However, models that explain the amount of <b>global</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> with the smallest set of covariates should be obtained.
