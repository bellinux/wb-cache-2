5|$|In a 2011 {{study by}} Nicolás Campione and David Evans, the authors {{conducted}} {{the first ever}} morphometric analysis to compare the various specimens assigned to Edmontosaurus. They concluded that only two species are valid: E. regalis, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> Campanian, and E. annectens, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> Maastrichtian. Their study provided further evidence that Anatotitan copei is a synonym of E. annectens; specifically, that the long, low skull of A. copei {{is the result of}} ontogenetic change and represents mature E. annectens individuals.|$|E

5|$|Struthiosaurinae {{is one of}} the longest-lasting {{groups of}} ankylosaurians. They range from Europelta at 112 Ma to Struthiosaurus, which lived until the {{uppermost}} Cretaceous, or 66 Ma. In between those two early and late struthiosaurines are the genera Anoplosaurus and Hungarosaurus. Hungarosaurus is younger, at about 85 Ma, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> Santonian of the Csehbánya Formation. Anoplosaurus is a fair amount older, at about 100 Ma, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> Albian Cambridge Greensand.|$|E

5|$|According to Lucas and Sobus, {{the type}} species P. bugtiense <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> Oligocene of Pakistan {{includes}} junior synonyms such as B. osborni and P. zhajremensis. P. transouralicum, formerly Indricotherium, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> Oligocene of Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and northern China includes B. grangeri and I. minus. P. orgosensis, formerly Dzungariotherium, {{from the middle}} and late Oligocene of northwest China includes D. turfanensis and P. lipidus. P. orgosensis may be distinct enough to warrant its original genus name, but its exact position requires evaluation. P. prohorovi <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> Oligocene of Kazakhstan may be too incomplete for its position to be resolved {{in relation to the}} other species; the same applies to proposed species such as I. intermedium and P. tienshanensis, as well as genera like Benaratherium and Caucasotherium. Though the genus name Indricotherium is now a junior synonym of Paraceratherium, the subfamily name Indricotheriinae is still in use because genus name synonymy does not affect the names of higher level taxa that are derived from these. Members of the subfamily are therefore still commonly referred to as indricotheres.|$|E

5|$|Dermotherium is a genus {{of fossil}} mammals {{closely related to}} the living colugos, a small group of gliding mammals from Southeast Asia. Two species are recognized: D.major <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Late</b> Eocene of Thailand, based on a single {{fragment}} of the lower jaw, and D.chimaera <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Late</b> Oligocene of Thailand, known from three fragments of the lower jaw and two isolated upper molars. In addition, a single isolated upper molar from the Early Oligocene of Pakistan has been tentatively assigned to D.chimaera. All sites where fossils of Dermotherium have been found probably developed in forested environments and the fossil species probably were forest dwellers like living colugos, but whether they already had the gliding adaptations of the living species is unknown.|$|E
