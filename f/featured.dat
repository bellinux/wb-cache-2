50|$|<b>Feature</b> {{selection}} techniques {{should be}} distinguished from <b>feature</b> extraction. <b>Feature</b> extraction creates new <b>features</b> from functions of the original <b>features,</b> whereas <b>feature</b> selection returns {{a subset of the}} <b>features.</b> <b>Feature</b> selection techniques are often used in domains where there are many <b>features</b> and comparatively few samples (or data points). Archetypal cases for the application of <b>feature</b> selection include the analysis of written texts and DNA microarray data, where there are many thousands of <b>features,</b> and a few tens to hundreds of samples.|$|R
30|$|SIFT <b>features</b> are {{invariant}} in rotation, scale, translation, viewing angle, and {{brightness and}} have good robustness to parameter adjustment. The algorithm can effectively express the target <b>feature</b> information. The extraction of local <b>feature</b> points by SIFT algorithm mainly includes four steps: suspected <b>feature</b> points detection, removal of pseudo-feature points, matching of <b>feature</b> points’ gradient and direction, and <b>feature</b> description vector generation. SURF description operator and ORB <b>feature</b> description operator are the improvements of SITF description operator, especially the ORB <b>feature</b> description operator, {{which makes the}} running time of target detection and recognition algorithm take a qualitative leap. The HOG <b>feature</b> description operator implements the object <b>feature</b> description by calculating and counting the gradient histogram of the local region of the image. Haar <b>features</b> {{can be divided into}} four categories: edge <b>features,</b> linear <b>features,</b> central <b>features,</b> and diagonal <b>features.</b> These <b>features</b> can be combined into <b>feature</b> templates to extract invariant <b>features,</b> which were first used in face detection by Papageorgiou et al. [10].|$|R

This is an important requirement in a distributed and concurrent design environment, where data of part geometry has to be shared between different task domains. Associativity between <b>feature</b> models implies the automatic updating of different <b>feature</b> models of a part after changes are made {{in one of its}} <b>feature</b> models. The proposed algorithm takes multiple <b>feature</b> models of a part as input and modifies other <b>feature</b> models to reflect the changes made to a <b>feature</b> in a <b>feature</b> model. The proposed algorithm updates <b>feature</b> volumes in other <b>feature</b> models and then classifies the updated volumes to obtain the updated <b>feature</b> model. The spatial arrangement of <b>feature</b> faces and adjacency relationship between <b>features</b> are used to isolate <b>features</b> in a view that are affected by the modification. <b>Feature</b> volumes are updated based on the classification of the <b>feature</b> volume of the modified <b>feature</b> with respect to <b>feature</b> volumes of the model being updated. The algorithm is capable of handling all types of <b>feature</b> modifications namely, <b>feature</b> deletion, <b>feature</b> creation, and changes to <b>feature</b> location and parameters. In contrast to current art in automatic updating of <b>feature</b> models, the proposed algorithm does not use an intermediate representation, does not re-interpret the <b>feature</b> model from a low level representation and handles interacting <b>features.</b> The present work considers modifications to form <b>features</b> only.

50|$|Techniques to {{transform}} the raw <b>feature</b> vectors (<b>feature</b> extraction) are sometimes used prior to application of the pattern-matching algorithm.

The distinction between <b>feature</b> selection and <b>feature</b> extraction is that the resulting <b>features</b> after <b>feature</b> extraction has taken place are of a different sort than the original <b>features</b> and may not easily be interpretable, while the <b>features</b> left after <b>feature</b> selection are simply a subset of the original <b>features.</b>|$|R
