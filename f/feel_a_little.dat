5|$|The 2009 {{film was}} {{originally}} conceived as an origin story, but the project {{evolved into a}} re-imagining of the first four Friday the 13th films. The character Jason Voorhees was redesigned as a lean, quick killer with a backstory that allows the viewer to <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sympathy for him, but not enough that he would lose his menace. In keeping with {{the tone of the}} film, Jason's mask was recreated from a mold of the original mask used for Part III; though there were subtle changes. Friday the 13th includes some of Harry Manfredini's musical score from the previous Friday the 13th films because the producers recognized its iconic status.|$|E

500|$|IGN's Eric Goldman {{rated the}} episode 8.5/10. He commented that in {{resetting}} {{the events of}} [...] "Sectionals", it [...] "felt a bit rushed", but concluded: [...] "Glee continues to work because it has its cake and eats it too. It's an over the top, overly cheerful musical – but also a biting comedy that always winks at the audience and acknowledges how cheesy musical theater can be, even while also proving how fun it is." [...] The Daily News David Hinckley shared Goldman's concerns about resetting the characters, and while he believed that doing so was the right long-term move, he commented that: [...] "the immediate effect {{is to make the}} episode <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> jerky." [...] Hinckley felt that the episode's greatest problems were its pace and execution, observing: [...] "Too many twists and turns <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too sudden, leaving us not quite sure how we got from here to there." ...|$|E

500|$|The A.V. Club ranked Doctor Who the 25th best show of 2010, {{saying that}} it [...] "lacked a truly weak episode" [...] and {{highlighting}} [...] "The Time of Angels"/"Flesh and Stone", [...] "Vincent and the Doctor", and [...] "The Lodger" [...] as the best episodes. Digital Spy ranked the programme the third best of 2010, commenting that it [...] "gave us some terrific episodes— the beautifully tragic 'Vincent and the Doctor', the wonderfully-paced opener and the well-imagined finale ... but also the multi-colored monstrosity 'Victory of the Daleks'. Overall, a decent enough start for the new team, but with such a strong pedigree, we couldn't help but <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> underwhelmed." ...|$|E
500|$|After the Yankees won Game 2 at the Polo Grounds, the Series {{returned}} to Yankee Stadium for Game 3. Stengel won it, 1–0, {{on a home}} run into the right field bleachers. As the Yankee fans booed Stengel, he thumbed his nose at the crowd and blew a kiss toward the Yankee players, outraging the team's principal owner, Jacob Ruppert, who demanded that Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis fine or suspend Stengel. Judge Landis declined, [...] "a man who wins two games with home runs may <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> playful, especially if he's a Stengel". The Yankees won the next three games to take the Series; Stengel batted [...]417 in the six games, completing his World Series career as a player with a [...]393 batting average.|$|E
500|$|A [...] "working mom", as {{described}} by Paltrow, Elizabeth is the central figure in the detective process. Despite being among the virus' first victims, Paltrow believed that Elizabeth was [...] "lucky", as she thought the disease's survivors were being left {{to deal with the}} newly difficult conditions of everyday life, such as finding food and potable water. When on location in Hong Kong, Paltrow was instructed by Soderbergh to take photographs {{to be used in the}} film, and admitted she was apprehensive about the assignment. [...] "I was just another tourist taking pictures", she said, and added, [...] "I did <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> pressure.

500|$|Edge {{wrote that}} the game [...] "can <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> insubstantial" [...] in its lack of {{gameplay}} variety, though its [...] "charm and craft" [...] will make players return. They {{wrote that the}} soundtrack is cheerful and memorable with an [...] "indie romcom feel". TouchArcade added that the soundtrack [...] "fits the game perfectly" [...] and recommended playing the game with sound activated so as to hear the tiles' personalities. CNET thought the music became repetitive, but that the tile voices were [...] "a little creepy" [...] without the soundtrack. Garrett Martin of Paste wrote that he heard the influence of Jon Brion and alluded to Paul Thomas Anderson's early films. Comparing Threes to Hundreds as the [...] "quirky American cousin" [...] to Hundreds [...] "European art film", Martin found Threes more whimsical in nature and extended Ian Bogost's statements in The Atlantic about video games as [...] "haute couture ... design objects" [...] to Threes.|$|E
500|$|Travis Fickett of IGN {{said the}} episode {{included}} some good laughs but [...] "never kicks into high gear" [...] {{and said the}} themes might have worked better as subplots than a full episode: [...] "'Fishsticks' {{is one of those}} episodes that typically occur around now in the South Park season. It's not great, not bad – hovering somewhere around amusing towards forgettable." [...] Sean O'Neal of The A.V. Club said he was disappointed by the episode and thought the message about celebrity self-delusion might have been better if it focused on only West or Mencia, rather than both. Although O'Neal liked the West song in the episode's final scene, O'Neal said [...] "cramming (West and Mencia) together — even mixed in with Cartman's very funny fantasy sequences — felt too cobbled to me, and the time limits imposed by cutting back and forth between it all made the respective digs start to <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too one-note." ...|$|E
500|$|Millar did {{not like}} the first draft of the screenplay, {{considering}} that the approach was [...] "too tame" [...] and [...] "a little bit Americanized" [...] given he wanted [...] "basically be the opposite of the Spider-Man movie, the idea of someone getting powers and realizing they can do what they want, then choosing the dark path." [...] The author only started to support the direction the project was taking once Bekmambetov [...] "came in with his Eastern European madness" [...] and the intention of coming closer to the spirit of the book. Bekmambetov said that he would take liberty in adapting the comic book's world: [...] "It’s difficult for me to just follow. It’s interesting for me to create. I <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit different how this world has to be executed". In July 2006, screenwriter Chris Morgan was hired to revise the third act of the Wanted script written by Haas and Brandt.|$|E

500|$|The game's stylistic {{changes from}} past Final Fantasy titles sparked {{negative}} comments, with some perceiving it as {{a change in}} the spirit of the franchise. Among these were the game's status as Final Fantasys first direct sequel and the change from a tragic atmosphere in Final Fantasy X to a dominantly lighthearted tone in Final Fantasy X-2. In their review, gaming website GameSpot commented that [...] "Some of the missions ... come off as downright silly and a bit tacked on". Additionally, they felt that the game's non-linear style makes it [...] " [...] the singular narrative thrust of Final Fantasy X or other typical RPGs, and the storyline can <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> nebulous and disjointed as a result". Moreover, GameSpot commented that [...] "trivial minigames have been creeping into the Final Fantasy games at an alarming rate over the last few years, and in this regard, X-2 is definitely the most egregious offender in the series". Despite these comments, they praised the battle system as a [...] "welcome addition", while regarding its voice-overs and localizations as [...] "outstanding".|$|E
500|$|The {{reception}} of Scream has been mixed. Arthur Levine of About.com gives the ride 4 out of 5 stars. He states [...] "it's remarkably smooth, loaded with airtime, and {{has plenty of}} surprises to warrant its name". Levine did criticise the lack of theming and landscaping around the ride noting the immediate area surrounding the ride [...] "includes a bone yard of coaster seats and parts". Robert Niles of the Los Angeles Times shared a similar sentiment, stating [...] "Scream creates an effective illusion that you are alone, flying above the track" [...] but questions the ride's location on a former parking lot. He highlights [...] "a good story can elicit extreme thoughts and emotions. [...] Why ignore those opportunities when building a thrill ride?". Niles concluded by stating [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> neglected as I shuffle off the otherwise exciting ride", referring {{to the lack of}} theming or storyline. Lynn Arave of the Deseret News praised the ride, rating it alongside the Riddler's Revenge for the best rides in the park.|$|E
500|$|When portraying Ellie, Johnson faced {{challenges}} in performing scenes {{that made her}} feel uncomfortable. [...] "There were some days when we would shoot things that even at my age made me <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> uncomfortable," [...] Johnson described. Johnson feels that video games rarely feature strong female characters such as Ellie, and expressed her excitement to portray the role for this reason. When questioned about the inspiration for Ellie as a gameplay feature, Druckmann recalled when he and Straley were brainstorming ideas for Uncharted 2: Among Thieves and created a mute character who would summon the player to follow them, creating a [...] "beautiful" [...] relationship through gameplay alone. Though this concept was never {{included in the final}} game, the idea was raised when the team were discussing a new project, ultimately inspiring Ellie. Druckmann also felt inspired by the wars that took place in Syria and Afghanistan when creating Ellie; he felt that conflict was a familiarity to the children in those countries, which is similar to Ellie's view.|$|E

5000|$|RPGFan criticised the simplistic {{nature of}} the game, saying [...] "the game {{currently}} <b>feels</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bare-bones", adding, however, that [...] "with almost no downtime, a true sense of cooperation, and constant challenge, RMG is an MMO that never grows stale" [...] scoring the game 78% overall.|$|R
500|$|During early development, Rocksteady {{placed a}} {{prototype}} Batmobile {{in the existing}} Arkham City map, and learned that the claustrophobic city designed for Batman to glide and grapple did not work well for driving a vehicle. Gotham City was thus redesigned with wider streets to allow space for the Batmobile and other street traffic to drive without colliding into walls, and buildings were made taller to accommodate the vehicle's ejection ability. To redesign Gotham City, the designers attempted {{to build on the}} previous games' gothic architecture while making a more believable and dense city. Alongside minor elements like neon lights, billboard advertising, and American-style cars, the team developed ideas for shops that could be found in the city, while retaining a grimy, dystopian theme. Describing the design, Hego said: [...] "every kind of element we've added in there ... makes the entire experience <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> out of time. You couldn't pinpoint whether it's twenty years ago, now or in ten years time." [...] The designers valued making an open world that was [...] "rich, vibrant, dense...and full of interesting things to do" [...] over it just being large.|$|E
500|$|On November 2, 2002, Jay-Z and Beyoncé {{performed}} the song together at Saturday Night Live (SNL). Later, on November 21, 2002 they appeared on MTV's TRL for Spankin' New Music Week where they also {{performed the}} song. In 2009, Beyoncé performed an abbreviated version of [...] "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" [...] during her I Am... Yours revue, {{held at the}} Encore Las Vegas Theatre in July and August. The song was later included on the 2009 live album [...] which was chronicling the revue. In August 2011, Beyoncé performed [...] "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" [...] again during her revue 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé and included the song on the DVD [...] released in November 2011. During the concerts, Beyoncé announced the song by saying, [...] "It's 2002… I started to <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> lonely till one day…". [...] "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" [...] was included on Jay-Z's live album Live in Brooklyn released on October 11, 2012 after he performed the song during eight shows in Brooklyn. In 2013, Jay-Z included the song on the set list of his Legends of the Summer Stadium Tour.|$|E
500|$|On the {{negative}} side, Marty Racine of the Houston Chronicle said that [...] "I Don't Wanna Know" [...] and [...] "Take Me Home" [...] {{were the only}} songs to [...] "rise above the crowd", and that Collins focused too much on his singing and less on his drumming, [...] "which can be captivating". Racine also added that the album makes the listener <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> [...] "cold", but admired that the singer was [...] "playing the game as well as anyone". Writing an article in defence of Collins in 2010, Gary Mills of The Quietus described the album as [...] "determined dross" [...] which Collins did not deserve to have his career judged by. In 2013, music critic Tom Service of The Guardian was similarly scathing, saying the album had not {{stood the test of}} time and was [...] "unlistenable to today", singling out [...] "Sussudio" [...] for particular criticism, arguing: [...] "the production, the drum machine, the inane sincerity of the lyrics; there's no colder or more superficial sound in popular music, precisely because it takes itself so seriously." [...] He also compared it unfavourably with the enduring appeal of Collins's 1980s contemporaries such as the Human League and—in particular—the Pet Shop Boys, saying the latter were [...] "geniuses by comparison".|$|E

5000|$|The {{school of}} journalism at the University of Canberra commented, [...] "The format at times <b>feels</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> disjointed and uneven with some {{segments}} falling flat.

500|$|Bosworth {{was cast}} as {{reporter}} Lois Lane in Bryan Singer's superhero film Superman Returns (2006). She starred {{along with her}} Beyond the Sea co-star Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, as well as newcomer Brandon Routh as Superman. The film was a box office success and received mostly positive reviews. Bosworth's performance however, was not well received among critics; Anthony Lane of The New Yorker noted, [...] "The new Lois Lane, Kate Bosworth, is not a patch on Margot Kidder, or, for that matter, on Teri Hatcher, in the [...]" [...] San Francisco Chronicle film critic Mick LaSalle felt that Bosworth, {{at the age of}} 22 years, was too young to portray Lois Lane, and the climax did not [...] "match the potential of the tiring 154 minute long film". Although Bosworth's performance was ambivalently received, she herself loved the experience of working on the movie. As she told Teen Vogue in August 2006, [...] "You know how you have an experience, a time in your life when you feel you've come into your own? When you grow up a bit, and think, Now I get it? [...] That's how I feel. I <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit more complete." [...] The movie grossed $52million during its opening weekend in North America and went on to earn $391million worldwide.|$|E
500|$|Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club {{called the}} episode [...] "an {{adequate}} hour of action-adventure television, {{but the first}} 59 minutes are missing the spark of the final post-credits scene", seeing room for improvement for all the cast members, and concluding that the show falls [...] "somewhere between Firefly and Dollhouse on the spectrum of Whedon TV influences". [...] Graeme Virtue of The Guardian called Gregg [...] "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.s greatest asset", finding the Jackson cameo to be a [...] "thrill", but that [...] "plot-wise, things perhaps still <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> inconsequential". The Hollywood Reporters Marc Bernardin praised {{the scale of the}} episode, describing it as coming [...] "out of the gate like a blockbuster", but criticized its ambitions, asking [...] "Shouldn't this show be, well, nuttier? ... Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. needs to unhinge itself, but good, and not just be a procedural." [...] He also singled out Skye and May as being unfocused and underdeveloped, respectively, as characters, and he felt the Jackson cameo [...] "gave the whole thing a charge that, in truth, it didn't really earn." [...] Jim Steranko, known for his work on Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., found the episode to be [...] "smoother , although more formulaic". He criticized the plot and characters, but praised Jackson's cameo as [...] "an electrifying reminder of what the series could and should be." ...|$|E
500|$|SFX {{reviewer}} Ian Berriman gave [...] "A Town Called Mercy" [...] {{three and}} a half out of five stars. He commented that the ethical debate made it [...] "a surprisingly mature story", but otherwise the Western tropes made it [...] "occasionally <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> over-familiar". He also felt it was missing [...] "another twist or two", as most of the episode was dedicated to figuring {{out what to do with}} Jex rather than discovering more about him. Berriman also had two [...] "nitpicks" [...] that arose with the plot; the Gunslinger could just walk into the town and take Jex away, or the Doctor could take Jex away in the TARDIS. Dave Golder of the magazine labelled [...] "A Town Called Mercy" [...] as a [...] "disappointing" [...] science fiction Western episode, writing, [...] "There are some great things about this episode ... But in a show that usually has a lot of fun reinventing TV tropes, too much of [...] "A Town Called Mercy" [...] feels a bit been-there, done that." [...] Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times was more critical, writing that he did not [...] "believe" [...] or [...] "feel" [...] it. He felt that Westerns and Doctor Who were two things that [...] "never quite gelled" [...] and also criticised the [...] "languorous pace" [...] the fact that Rory had little to do. However, he did praise the [...] "gorgeous" [...] set and the [...] "cleverly constructed a morality play".|$|E
