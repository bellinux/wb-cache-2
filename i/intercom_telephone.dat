50|$|An <b>intercom</b> <b>{{telephone}}</b> is {{a special}} kind of telephone that controls a school or an office buildings intercom system. For example, with that telephone, the employers make the school announcements and can call each classroom's intercom by dialing the room number of that classroom. It can be interfaced with the building's access control system.|$|E
5000|$|The {{name and}} assets of Hallicrafters were traded over the {{following}} years, {{even though there were}} no products bearing the name. Since around 1988, the remaining assets and rights to the 'Hallicrafters' name and logos have been held by court-appointed trustees. (Note: one known 1980s product bearing the Hallicrafters name does exist - a 4-line plus <b>intercom</b> <b>telephone.)</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|The firm S. H. Couch, often {{known as}} simply Couch, was a Quincy, Massachusetts, {{manufacturing}} company founded circa 1901 in Boston after {{the dissolution of}} Whitman & Couch, a partnership, and a second entity known as Couch & Seeley. [...] S. H. Couch launched during and participated in {{the turn of the}} century Independent Telephone Movement which ensued after the expiration of the foundational Bell telephone patents in 1894. The company specialized in electrical devices including <b>telephones,</b> <b>intercoms,</b> and fire alarm systems. S. H. Couch had offices in Boston and in Chicago by 1907.|$|R
50|$|A single device can add {{intercom}} functionality {{to multiple}} standard telephones {{on a common}} phone line, even of different makes and models. Installation effort is minimal, and is not vulnerable to the radio interference and security issues of wireless systems. The Add-A-Com Whole House <b>Intercom</b> for Standard <b>Telephone</b> Systems is such a device. Intercom paging is accomplished by sounding a distinctive ring from all telephones after any phone is taken briefly off hook. After paging, any number of phones may converse. The device temporarily disconnects the external phone line during intercom use, and reconnects when all phones are again on hook. During intercom use, an external call’s ringing signal {{can be heard in}} the earpiece.|$|R
5000|$|The play {{takes place}} in [...] "A room" [...] in a house {{during the course of}} one day ("Morning", [...] "Afternoon", and [...] "Night"), but the {{location}} of the room is unspecified. The furniture in the room, a [...] "desk" [...] and a [...] "machine" [...] used as a <b>telephone</b> <b>intercom,</b> and the bars on the windows, as illustrated by the premiere production photographs, suggests that the room in a domestic house has been converted into an office and that the house functions as a prison [...] The use of some common English colloquial expressions (e.g., the titular [...] "One for the Road" [...] repeated by Nicolas regarding having another drink) implies that the action could take place in Great Britain or America, or another English-speaking country among [...] "civilised" [...] people.|$|R
2500|$|There follows Serling's {{voice-over}} descriptive narration with {{combination of}} shots {{of an air}} control tower inside and out, <b>telephones,</b> <b>intercoms,</b> voice-over communications, an enacted moving-camera photographic view through the tower window of an empty airfield, live shots of two jets taking off, a moving pan shot of a painted impressionistic illustration of three discs (approaching), close-up enacted live shots of photographic cameras turning and focusing (on empty desert), a live shot of emergency vehicles racing over the landing apron, followed by a painted impressionistic illustration (same style) of a landed UFO craft and two oddly dressed individuals: one just outside the craft {{and one in the}} foreground near what could be two Air Force officers of indeterminate rank. Then a live shot of the side of a corrugated steel building through a chainlink gate with chain and padlock is shown, with Rod Serling's voice-over words: ...|$|R
40|$|A new simulator, the Surface Development and Test Facility (SDTF) {{is under}} {{construction}} at the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California. Jointly funded by the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) and NASA, the SDTF will be a testbed for airport surface automation technologies of the future. The SDTF will be operational {{in the third quarter}} of 1998. The SDTF will combine a virtual tower with simulated ground operations to allow evaluation of new technologies for safety, effectiveness, reliability, and cost benefit. The full-scale level V tower will provide a seamless 360 degree high resolution out-the-window view, and a full complement of ATC (air traffic control) controller positions. The imaging system will be generated by two fully-configured Silicon Graphics Onyx Infinite Reality computers, and will support surface movement of up to 200 aircraft and ground vehicles. The controller positions, displays and consoles can be completely reconfigured to match the unique layout of any individual airport tower. Dedicated areas will accommodate pseudo-airport ramp controllers, pseudo-airport operators, and pseudo-pilots. Up to 33 total personnel positions will be able to participate in simultaneous operational scenarios. A realistic voice communication infrastructure will emulate the <b>intercom</b> and <b>telephone</b> communications of a real airport tower. Multi-channel audio and video recording and a sophisticated data acquisition system will support a wide variety of research and development areas, such as evaluation of automation tools for surface operations, human factors studies, integration of terminal area and airport technologies, and studies of potential airport physical and procedural modifications...|$|R
40|$|This master’s thesis {{purpose is}} to find {{opportunities}} for mobile solutions within the process industry and describe the specific requirements on the equipment that arises {{in this type of}} industry. Another objective is to study business opportunities with respect to mobile solutions. The communication devices that are used at SSAB are cell phones, computers, short-range radios, <b>intercoms</b> and ordinary <b>telephones.</b> These different communication systems create confusion and inefficient communication. If a Push-to-Talk solution is used the number of different communication systems needed would be far less but the same services would still be provided. Furthermore, the maintenance personnel as well as SSAB’s documentation could benefit from a Smart Phone solution from which the enterprise resource planning system can be accessed. The work tasks as well as the rough environment at SSAB create a need for an all-in-one device that can withstand heavy abuse but nevertheless fit into the pocket of the working clothes. Business opportunities with these solutions arise from a more efficient communication due to a fewer number of systems as well as from a more appropriate system. Better documentation and more efficient repairs are also benefits which can occur from a Smart Phone solution. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{critical}} problems facing the telecommunications industry {{is the extent to which}} competition will be introduced into what has been, for the most part, a regulated industry. In the forefront of the competitive environment has been the telephone interconnection industry. The genesis of this industry was the Carterfone decision by the Federal Communications Commission which allowed competition in the interconnection field. It is the thesis of this project that the most significant factor affecting the telephone interconnection industry today is the continued impact of competition on the industry. To insure that the project stayed within manageable limits the authors chose to examine the issues dealing with that part of the interconnect industry providing for the connection of answering devices, acoustic couplers, personal custom <b>telephones,</b> <b>intercom</b> systems, key business systems, or private branch exchanges (PBX) to the telephone system. Issues surrounding the competitive interconnect services of microwave and satellite links provided by the specialized common carriers are beyond the scope of this project. The specialized common carrier area is a critical issue on its own right and should be the subject of investigation by future participants in the Telecommunications Program. An analysis of present, past and potential interconnect manufacturers is provided to show how the lure and promise of competition has affected the industry. Because there are hundreds of companies involved in the manufacture and marketing of interconnect devices, only a limited cross section has been chosen for this project...|$|R
