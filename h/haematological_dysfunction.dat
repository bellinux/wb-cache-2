40|$|Coexistence of {{neuropathy}} and paraproteinemia (monoclonal gammopathy) is {{a common}} and complex problem seen in clinical practice and requires the distinction of specific syndromes. The clinical courses of these neuropathies are typically chronic and progressive. A precise distinction {{of the type of}} haematologic disorder associated (benign or malignant), investigation of other organs manifestations, and assessment of specific markers are mandatory. These steps are important to initiate an appropriate therapy that may include chemotherapy and/or immunosuppressive treatment targeting the neuropathy and the <b>haematological</b> <b>dysfunction...</b>|$|E
40|$|Sepsis is a {{systemic}} inflammatory response to infection {{in which the}} balance of pro- andanti-inflammatory mediators, which normally isolate and eliminate infection, is disrupted[1]. Gram negative sepsis is initiated by bacterial endotoxin release which activatesmacrophages and circulating monocytes to release TNF and IL- 1 β followed by IL- 6 andother inflammatory cytokines [2]. As the disease progresses, an unregulatedinflammatory response results in, tissue injury, <b>haematological</b> <b>dysfunction</b> and organdysfunction. Severe sepsis, involving organ hypoperfusion may be further complicatedby hypotension that is unresponsive to adequate fluid replacement, resulting in septicshock and finally death [3]. Despite improvements in anti-microbial and supportive therapies, sepsis remains asignificant cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} in ICUs worldwide [4]. The complexity ofprocesses mediating the progression of sepsis suggests that an extracorporeal devicecombining blood filtration with adsorption {{of a wide range of}} toxins, and inflammatorymediators offers the most comprehensive treatment strategy. However, no such deviceexists at present. A novel, uncoated, polymer pyrolysed synthetic carbon device isproposed which combines the superior adsorption properties of uncoated activatedcarbons with the capacity to manipulate porous structure for controlled adsorption oftarget plasma proteins and polypeptides [5]. Preliminary haemocompatibility andadsorptive capacity was assessed using a carbon matrix prototype...|$|E
30|$|Our {{work does}} not answer the {{question}} of which contamination levels can be considered acceptable. It does however provide contamination level benchmarks with regard to clinical studies already published. In a recent systematic review, we described the clinical consequences of drug incompatibilities [1] through case reports and randomised controlled trials. Pulmonary toxicity was reported particularly during prolonged total parenteral nutrition [17] and related to the occurrence of a micro-emboli of crystal precipitates obstructing pulmonary vessels and generating granulomatous pulmonary arteritis and granulomatous interstitial pneumonitis [18]. In critically ill children, in-line filtration reduced the incidence of organ dysfunctions (respiratory, renal and <b>haematological</b> <b>dysfunctions)</b> and sepsis and so demonstrated indirectly the negative effects of particles [2]. Our results may explain the differences in those observed in randomised controlled trials that assess the effect of in-line filtration on the development of sepsis and organ failure. In-line filtration seems an effective strategy for preventing sepsis in children but contrasts with the negative results in adults shown by Gradwolh-Matis et al. [5]. The discrepancies in results between clinical trials in a paediatric ICU and an adult ICU suggest that particulate contamination is more important in critically ill paediatric patients than in critically ill adult patients and could confirm the advantage of in-line filtration in the latter. However, clinicians must take into account that all drugs cannot be filtered and that the use of filters may sometimes lead to drug retention [19].|$|R
40|$|Maintenance of {{physiologic}} phosphate {{balance is}} important for essential cellular functions [1]. Dysregulation of the phosphate balance {{in the form of}} hypophosphataemia can lead to the development of myopathy, cardiac <b>dysfunction,</b> <b>haematological</b> abnormalities and bone mineralization defects [1]. In contrast, hyperphosphataemia can cause vascular and soft tissue calcification [2, 3]. Studies have convincingly demonstrated that FGF 23 is a master regulator of systemic phosphate homeostasis [4 – 9]. FGF 23 is a 30 kDa protein that is proteolytically processed to generate smaller N-terminal (∼ 18 kDa) and C-terminal (∼ 12 kDa) fragments. The N-terminal fragment of FGF 23 contains the FGF receptor-binding domain, while the C-terminal fragment is proposed to be necessary for interaction with Klotho (a type 1 membrane protein wit...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Plasma {{concentrations}} of sFlt- 1, the soluble {{form of the}} vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGF), markedly increase during {{coronary artery bypass graft}} (CABG) surgery with extracorporeal circulation (ECC). We investigated if plasma sFlt- 1 values might be related to the occurrence of surgical complications after CABG. Methods Plasma samples were collected from the radial artery catheter before vascular cannulation and after opening the chest, at the end of ECC just before clamp release, after cross release, after weaning from ECC, at the 6 th and 24 th post-operative hour. Thirty one patients were investigated. The presence of cardiovascular, <b>haematological</b> and respiratory <b>dysfunctions</b> was prospectively assessed. Plasma sFlt- 1 levels were measured with commercially ELISA kits. Results Among the 31 investigated patients, 15 had uneventful surgery. Patients with and without complications had similar pre-operative plasma sFlt- 1 levels. Lowered plasma sFlt- 1 levels were observed at the end of ECC in patients with haematological (p = 0. 001, ANOVA) or cardiovascular (p = 0. 006) impairments, but not with respiratory ones (p = 0. 053), as compared to patients with uneventful surgery. Conclusion These results identify an association between specific post-CABG complication and the lower release of sFlt- 1 during ECC. sFlt- 1 -induced VEGF neutralisation might, thus, be beneficial to reduce the development of post-operative adverse effects after CABG. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Observational and interventional {{studies in}} {{patients}} with both acute medical conditions and long-standing diabetes have shown that improved blood glucose control confers a survival advantage or reduces complication rates. Policies of “tight” glycaemic control was rapidly adopted by many general ICUs worldwide in the mid 00 ’s, even though {{the results of the}} study were not generalisable to mixed medical/surgical ICUs with different intravenous feeding policies. Methods/Design: This protocol summarizes the rationale and design of a randomised, controlled single centre trial investigating the effect of mandatory insulin therapy versus usual care insulin therapy for those patients admitted for a stay of longer than 48 hours. In total, 109 critically ill adults predicted to stay in intensive care for longer than 48 hours were consented. The primary outcome is to determine the safety of mandatory insulin therapy in critically ill patients using the number of episodes of hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia per unit length of stay in intensive care. Secondary outcomes include duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of ICU and hospital stay, hospital mortality, and measures of renal, hepatic and <b>haematological</b> <b>dysfunction.</b> The primary analysis will be intention to treat. Recruitment started in July 2005 and completed in April 2007. Discussion: This protocol for a randomised controlled trial investigating the effect of mandatory insulin therapy should provide an answer to a key question for the management of patients in the intensive care unit and ultimately improving outcome...|$|E
40|$|Visceral {{leishmaniasis}} (VL) {{in humans}} and in animal models is associated with, among other factors, parasite persistence {{in the bone}} marrow (BM) and significant changes in haematological function. However, the mechanisms underlying haematologic dysregulation are largely unknown. Using a panel of stem cell markers, we characterized murine haematopoietic stem and precursor cells in the BM {{over the course of}} L. donovani-infection in C 57 BL/ 6 (B 6) mice. In steady-state, the majority of LT-HSCs (Long-term haematopoietic stem cells) (LSK CD 150 + CD 34 - CD 48 - cells) were found in a quiescent state, representing cells with the highest degree of reconstitution potential. In contrast, during chronic infection, most LT-HSCs were found to have progressed to cell-cycle and this correlated with a reduced potential to engraft into syngeneic recipients. The loss of quiescent LT-HSCs was associated with expansion of cells displaying a phenotype attributed to early, and uncommitted progenitors. However this increase in uncommitted progenitors did not result in an increase in effective haematopoiesis, but rather chronically infected mice displayed signs of anaemia and thrombocytopenia. The loss of quiescent HSCs and other alterations in the haematopoietic compartment were absent in infected RAG 2 KO mice, but adoptive transfer of CD 4 + T cells restored this phenotype. In subsequent experiments, we transferred IFNγ-deficient CD 4 + T cells into RAG KO recipients and established that this pro-inflammatory cytokines was pivotal for the depletion of the reservoir of LT-HSCs in quiescence, {{as well as for the}} establishment of anaemia and thrombocytopenia. Subsequently, using mixed BM chimeras, we established that IFNγ signalling and TNF signalling pathways converge to induce an expansion of BM T cells, suggesting that both cytokines are required to drive the development of CD 4 + T cells with the potential to cause alterations in haematopoiesis and <b>haematological</b> <b>dysfunction</b> in the periphery. These data suggest new avenues for clinical research into the pathogenesis of VL and have relevance for the development of new therapeutic strategies and clinical follow-up. ...|$|E
40|$|To {{describe}} the incidence, characteristics and {{risk factors for}} critical care admission with severe maternal sepsis in the UK. National cohort study. 198 critical care units in the UK. 646 pregnant and recently pregnant women who had severe sepsis within the first 24  hours of admission in 2008 - 2010. Septic shock, mortality. Of all maternal critical care admissions, 14. 4 % (n= 646) had severe sepsis; 10. 6 % (n= 474) had septic shock. The absolute risk of maternal critical care admission with severe sepsis was 4. 1 / 10   000 maternities. Pneumonia/respiratory infection (irrespective of the H 1 N 1 pandemic influenza strain) and genital tract infection were the most common sources of sepsis (40 % and 24 %, respectively). We identified a significant gradient {{in the risk of}} severe maternal sepsis associated with increasing deprivation (RR= 6. 5; 95 % CI 4. 9 to 8. 5 most deprived compared with most affluent women). The absolute risk of mortality was 1. 8 / 100   000 maternities. The most common source of infection among women who died was pneumonia/respiratory infection (41 %). Known risk factors for morbidity supported by this study were: younger age, multiple gestation birth and caesarean section. Significant risk factors for mortality in unadjusted analysis were: age ≥ 35  years (unadjusted OR (uOR) = 3. 5; 95 % CI 1. 1 to 10. 6), ≥ 3 organ system dysfunctions (uOR= 12. 7; 95 % CI 2. 9 to 55. 1), respiratory dysfunction (uOR= 6. 5; 95 % CI 1. 9 to 21. 6), renal dysfunction (uOR= 5. 6; 95 % CI 2. 3 to 13. 4) and <b>haematological</b> <b>dysfunction</b> (uOR= 6. 5; 95 % CI 2. 9 to 14. 6). This study suggests a need to improve timely recognition of severe respiratory tract and genital tract infection in the obstetric population. The social gradient associated with the risk of severe sepsis morbidity and mortality raises important questions regarding maternal health service provision and usage...|$|E
40|$|Background: Immunodeficiency, centromeric {{instability}} and facial dysmorphism (ICF syndrome) {{is a rare}} autosomal recessive disease characterised by facial dysmorphism, immunoglobulin deficiency and branching of chromosomes 1, 9 and 16 after PHA stimulation of lymphocytes. Hypomethylation of DNA of {{a small fraction of}} the genome is an unusual feature of ICF patients which is explained by mutations in the DNA methyltransferase gene DNMT 3 B in some, but not all, ICF patients. Objective: To obtain a comprehensive description of the clinical features of this syndrome as well as genotype phenotype correlations in ICF patients. Methods: Data on ICF patients were obtained by literature search and additional information by means of questionnaires to corresponding authors. Results and conclusions: 45 patients all with proven centromeric instability were included in this study. Facial dysmorphism was found to be a common characteristic (n = 41 / 42), especially epicanthic folds, hypertelorism, flat nasal bridge and low set ears. Hypo- or agammaglobulinaemia was demonstrated in nearly all patients (n = 39 / 44). Opportunistic infections were seen in several patients, pointing to a T cell <b>dysfunction.</b> <b>Haematological</b> malignancy was documented in two patients. Life expectancy of ICF patients is poor, especially those with severe infections in infancy or chronic gastrointestinal problems and failure to thrive. Early diagnosis of ICF is important since early introduction of immunoglobulin supplementation can improve the course of the disease. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation should be considered as a therapeutic option in patients with severe infections or failure to thrive. Only 19 of 34 patients showed mutations in DNMT 3 B, suggesting genetic heterogeneity. No genotype-phenotype correlation was found between patients with and without DNMT 3 B mutations. ...|$|R
