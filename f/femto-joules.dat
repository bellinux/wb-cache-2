40|$|A novel optical {{pulse width}} {{management}} device is proposed and demonstrated. The device requires very slow switching energy, {{on the order}} of a few tens of <b>femto-joules.</b> It can perform stretching of a RZ to a much broader pulse, and conversion of RZ data streams to NRZ format for bit rates greater than 20 Gbit/s...|$|E
40|$|A {{receiver}} {{for digital}} optical inputs is presented {{which is based}} on a differential pair of optical thyristors, Modification of the conventional differential pair allows the electrical readout of its ON and OFF states. Optical input pulses with an energy of about 3 <b>femto-Joule</b> (at a wavelength of 830 nm) are sufficiently large for detection. In its present size, the receiver works up to 155 Mbit/s.

40|$|Continuous-wave laser driven Kerr-nonlinear, optical microresonators {{have enabled}} {{a variety of}} novel {{applications}} and phenomena including the generation of optical frequency combs, ultra-low noise microwaves, as well as, ultra-short optical pulses. In this work we break with the paradigm of the continuous-wave optical drive and use instead periodic, pico-second optical pulses. We observe the deterministic generation of stable femtosecond dissipative cavity solitons on-top of the resonantly enhanced driving pulse. Surprisingly, the soliton pulse locks to the driving pulse enabling direct all-optical control of both the soliton's repetition rate and carrier-envelope offset frequency {{without the need for}} any actuation on the microresonator. When compared to both continuous-wave driven microresonators and non-resonant pulsed supercontinuum generation, this new approach is substantially more efficient and can yield broadband frequency combs at <b>femto-Joule</b> driving pulse energies and average laser powers significantly below the parametric threshold power of continuous-wave driven microresonators. The presented results bridge the fields of continuous-wave driven resonant and pulse-driven non-resonant nonlinear optics. They enables micro-photonic pulse compression, ultra-efficient low noise frequency comb and resonant supercontinuum generation for applications including optical data transfer and optical spectroscopy. From a scientific perspective the results open a new horizon for nonlinear photonics driven by temporally and spectrally structured light...|$|R
