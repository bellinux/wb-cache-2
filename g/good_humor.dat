5|$|On April 6, {{the cannon}} {{appeared}} {{in front of}} the Green Building sporting a giant 21-pound gold-plated aluminum Brass Rat around its barrel, which was positioned to point towards Pasadena, and female MIT students mockingly posted pictures of themselves posing in bikinis with the cannon. It was revealed that preparations for the heist had been underway since December. MIT was softly criticized for not leaving a note explaining that the theft was a prank, as required by Caltech's pranking ethics, which were said to be more stringent than MIT's, but the prank was largely taken in <b>good</b> <b>humor</b> at both campuses.|$|E
5|$|Custine's {{leadership}} and character, although impugned by the Tribunal, proved fundamentally {{sound in the}} field. As an admirer of the Prussian style of drill and discipline, he was a strict disciplinarian, but his soldiers actually liked him, and felt inspired by him. Custine liked to make speeches and reportedly knew the names of his soldiers. He visited men in the hospital, demonstrated blunt <b>good</b> <b>humor,</b> and was the master of repartee. His ready wit was quoted throughout his command. He did not tolerate disorder or insubordination however; when encountering a troop of volunteers in 1792, who bragged {{that they were going}} to teach the army the right step (make it Republican), he ordered his cavalry to surround and disarm them.|$|E
5|$|David Schwimmer portrays Ross Geller, Monica Geller's older brother, a {{paleontologist}} {{working at}} the Museum of Natural History, and later a tenured professor of paleontology at New York University. Ross is a sweet-natured man of <b>good</b> <b>humor,</b> although he is often clumsy and socially awkward. Ross is involved in an on-again-off-again relationship with Rachel throughout the series. He has three failed marriages during the series: Carol Willick, a lesbian {{who is also the}} mother of his son, Ben; Emily Waltham, who divorces Ross after he accidentally says Rachel's name instead of hers during their wedding vows; and Rachel, as the two drunkenly marry in Las Vegas. His failed love life is potentially due to his paranoia and jealousy in relationships, and his divorces become a running joke within the series. Following a one-night stand, he and Rachel have a daughter, Emma, by the end of season eight. They finally confess that they are still in love with each other in the series finale.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1922, Burt {{applied for}} patents, {{which were not}} granted until October 1923 because the patent office thought <b>Good</b> <b>Humors</b> were too similar to Eskimo Pies. The patents were [...] granted only when Burt Jr. {{traveled}} to Washington, D.C. with samples to demonstrate the difference. When granted, <b>Good</b> <b>Humor's</b> patents were for the equipment and process to manufacture frozen novelties on a stick, {{but not for the}} product itself.|$|R

60|$|The {{little man}} looked {{up with a}} charming smile of <b>good</b> <b>humored</b> raillery. His keen gray eyes sparkled as mischievously as a schoolboy's. Softly he rubbed the palms of his hands together, as if enjoying the situation.|$|R
5|$|Extensive {{coverage}} of Youngstown's economic challenges has overshadowed the city's long entrepreneurial tradition. A number {{of products and}} enterprises introduced in Youngstown later became national household names. Among these is Youngstown-based Schwebel's Bakery, which was established in neighboring Campbell in the 20th century. The company now distributes bread products nationally. In the 1920s, Youngstown was {{the birthplace of the}} <b>Good</b> <b>Humor</b> brand of ice cream novelties, and the popular franchise of Handel's Homemade Ice Cream & Yogurt was established there in the 1940s. In the 1950s, Youngstown-born developer Edward J. DeBartolo, Sr. established one of the country's first modern shopping plazas in the suburb of Boardman. The fast-food chain, Arby's, opened the first of its restaurants in Boardman in 1964, and Arthur Treacher's Fish & Chips was headquartered in Youngstown in the late 1970s. More recently, the city's downtown hosted the corporate headquarters of the now-defunct pharmacy chain store Phar-Mor, which had been established by Youngstown native Mickey Monus.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his return}} to Jableh, al-Qassam {{commenced}} a program of Islamic revival based on moral reforms which included the encouragement of maintaining regular salaah (prayer) and the sawm (fasting) during Ramadan as well as advocating an end to gambling and alcohol consumption. Al-Qassam's campaign highly influenced Jableh's residents who increasingly adopted his reforms. He developed amiable relations with the local Ottoman police who he would call upon to enforce Sharia law on rare cases of major violations. In some occasions, he would send disciples as vigilantes to intercept caravans transporting alcohol which would then be disposed of. Despite the support for Arab nationalism from some of his fellow alumni at al-Azhar and among Syrian notables, al-Qassam's loyalties most likely laid with the Ottoman Empire as {{his relationship with the}} authorities would indicate. He was well-regarded among much of Jableh's population where he gained a reputation for piety, simple manners and <b>good</b> <b>humor.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Meehan family’s <b>Good</b> <b>Humor</b> Corporation of America {{operated}} in New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Detroit, and Chicago. There were also three major franchises: <b>Good</b> <b>Humor</b> of Baltimore/Washington (operated by the Brimer family), Burt’s <b>Good</b> <b>Humor</b> (operated by Harry Burt Jr. in Tulsa, Oklahoma), and <b>Good</b> <b>Humor</b> of California. In addition, distributors served Cleveland, Philadelphia, Albany, Dallas and Miami. In 1931, <b>Good</b> <b>Humor</b> reported a net profit of $452,105, {{almost as much}} as Meehan paid for the company.|$|E

5000|$|The Boston Arts Festival is {{an annual}} event {{designed}} to showcase the visual and performing arts in Boston. It is also called [...] "ähts" [...] — a <b>good</b> <b>humored</b> poke at the Boston accent. The festival {{is also used to}} promote Boston's Open Studios program.|$|R
5000|$|... "BJ and Rosie {{were the}} ringleaders on court, close friends, doubles {{partners}} frequent final-round foes, super saleswomen for the emerging tour.

25|$|The Meehan family faced estate {{planning}} issues because Mrs. Elizabeth H. Meehan was advancing in years. In 1961, {{they agreed to}} sell <b>Good</b> <b>Humor</b> of America to Thomas J. Lipton, a subsidiary of Unilever. Lipton also purchased <b>Good</b> <b>Humor</b> of Baltimore/Washington from the Brimer family. In a separate transaction, the other franchises agreed to stop using the <b>Good</b> <b>Humor</b> name. Of the distributors, only Philadelphia survived as a company branch. Lipton quickly created a grocery division to sell <b>Good</b> <b>Humor</b> products in supermarkets.|$|E
25|$|During this period, Frank Epperston started {{marketing}} frozen ice on a {{stick and}} formed the Popsicle Corporation. Six months after Popsicle received its patent in August 1924, <b>Good</b> <b>Humor</b> sued Popsicle Corporation, and by October 1925 the parties settled out of court. Popsicle agreed to pay <b>Good</b> <b>Humor</b> a licence fee to manufacture what was called frozen suckers from ice and sherbet products. <b>Good</b> <b>Humor</b> reserved the right to manufacture these products from ice cream, frozen custard, and the like.|$|E
25|$|<b>Good</b> <b>Humor</b> was {{not able}} to solve its labor problems. The company was unionized early in its history and was struck on several occasions. For example, in 1950 the Teamsters shut down Good Humor's New York {{operations}} for three weeks during the critical month of June. Beginning in the 1950s, the labor pool dried up and <b>Good</b> <b>Humor</b> operated over half of its fleet with seasonal employees, mostly college students. On average, new employees lasted only two to three weeks because of the long hours. The entire industry, except <b>Good</b> <b>Humor,</b> stopped using commissioned employees and became distributors who leased trucks to the drivers and sold them their products wholesale. <b>Good</b> <b>Humor</b> adopted this system wherever possible but was prevented from converting most branches because of union contracts.|$|E
5000|$|The tempo is {{lively and}} upbeat. The song {{tells a story}} of a small, {{hard-working}} Italian village. Every Saturday night they have a dance in the town square and they wait for Manuelo to show up for the party to begin. According to the <b>good</b> <b>humored</b> lyrics: [...] "He won't dance with a single girl, only the married ones".|$|R
5000|$|Millard was a Sinophile. In 1906 Millard [...] "admitted to once {{holding an}} [...] "adverse disposition" [...] toward the Chinese {{but the more}} he became acquainted with them the more he {{developed}} [...] "a sincere liking and admiration of the Chinese people." [...] He recognized that one could not easily identify social characteristics with a race, but he considered the Chinese [...] "industrious, reliable, law-abiding, <b>good</b> <b>humored,</b> capable, and tolerant." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1914, after {{a journalistic}} {{apprenticeship}} in Chicago {{as a reporter}} for the Chicago Record Herald, he began writing a sports column for the Philadelphia Public Ledger. Two years later Maxwell became sports editor of the Public Ledger, a position he held until his death. Maxwell's column was reported as being stylish and <b>good</b> <b>humored.</b> In friendly bet between Record Herald and a rival newspaper, Maxwell defeated his colleague in an eating contest.|$|R
25|$|After World War II, {{the company}} {{moved into the}} {{expanding}} suburbs to serve the baby boomers. Fifty-five percent of Good Humor's customers were age twelve or younger, and trucks now accounted for 90% of the company's sales. By 1956, the company's fleet grew to 2,000 trucks, all purchased since the war. That year, Meehan hired 32-year-old David J. Mahoney (1923–2000) as president of <b>Good</b> <b>Humor.</b> Mahoney {{was the head of}} the advertising firm serving <b>Good</b> <b>Humor</b> and later became the president of the large Norton Simon conglomerate. In his five years at <b>Good</b> <b>Humor,</b> his sales increased by 36%.|$|E
25|$|The company's history also {{includes}} many stories, {{such as one}} about a <b>Good</b> <b>Humor</b> vendor rushing a baby to a hospital for treatment and one about the company's helping {{to break up a}} counterfeit money operation on Long Island. During World War II, a <b>Good</b> <b>Humor</b> truck was assigned to follow one of the armies during maneuvers. The commander could not understand how the opposing artillery was quickly locating his position until he realized that the spotters were using the white <b>Good</b> <b>Humor</b> truck as a guide. Rather than deny his troops ice cream, that night he ordered the truck to be painted army green. After the war, a <b>Good</b> <b>Humor</b> vendor took pity on a youngster who was a nickel short and accepted a new magazine in place of the missing five cents. When he returned the next day, the street was lined with stacks of magazines piled by children eager to exchange periodicals for Good Humors.|$|E
25|$|Harry Burt died in 1926, and {{two years}} later his widow sold her {{interest}} to the Midland Food Products Company, owned by a group of Cleveland businessmen. They changed the company's name to the <b>Good</b> <b>Humor</b> Corporation of America and started selling franchises with a $100 down payment. Cora Burt retained the license agreement with Popsicle. Thomas J. Brimer (1900–1978) purchased the <b>Good</b> <b>Humor</b> franchise for the Detroit territory and by 1929 opened his second plant in Chicago. The mob demanded $5,000 protection money and destroyed part of the Chicago fleet when Brimer refused. The resulting publicity helped put <b>Good</b> <b>Humor</b> on the map.|$|E
500|$|The {{nickname}} for Smith was the U.S.S. Northampton. Captain H. W. Underwood, USN (Retired) was recalled {{to active duty}} and ordered {{to serve as the}} commanding officer of the United States Naval Reserve Midshipmen's School at Smith College, 13 August 1942. [...] Underwood had a distinguished naval career and received the Navy Cross during World War I. In Lady in the Navy, Joy Bright Hancock described Underwood as intelligent, enthusiastic, and <b>good</b> <b>humored,</b> and serious of purpose.|$|R
5000|$|Television critic James Poniewozik has {{disagreed}} with this assessment, writing, [...] "for {{all the talk}} about 'humiliation TV,' what's striking about most reality shows is how <b>good</b> <b>humored</b> and resilient most of the participants are: the American Idol rejectees stubbornly convinced of their own talent, the Fear Factor players walking away from vats of insects like Olympic champions. What finally bothers their detractors is, perhaps, not that these people are humiliated but that they are not." ...|$|R
60|$|Often {{on these}} evenings, {{the company was}} entertained by stories from the wild, roving lives of its own members. Tales of adventure, love, war and death in every known corner of the world; and the ten captains told, each, his story of {{how he came to}} be of Torn; and thus, with {{fighting}} enough by day to keep them <b>good</b> <b>humored,</b> the winter passed, and spring came with the ever wondrous miracle of awakening life, with soft zephyrs, warm rain, and sunny skies.|$|R
25|$|In 1961, <b>Good</b> <b>Humor</b> was {{acquired}} by Thomas J. Lipton, the U.S. subsidiary of the international Unilever conglomerate. Profits declined when the baby boomers aged and costs increased because of labor issues, gasoline, and insurance. The company sold its fleet in 1978 but continued to distribute its products through grocery stores and independent street vendors. By 1984, <b>Good</b> <b>Humor</b> returned to profitability. Starting in 1989, Unilever expanded <b>Good</b> <b>Humor</b> through its acquisition of Gold Bond Ice Cream that included the Popsicle brand. Four years later, Unilever bought Isaly Klondike and the Breyers Ice Cream Company. As a result, Good Humor-Breyers is now a large producer of branded ice cream and frozen novelties, {{as part of the}} Unilever Heartbrand.|$|E
25|$|In {{civilian}} life, Echols {{continued to}} help strengthen the nation's airpower potential. As {{president of the}} Aircraft Industries Association (AIA) from 1947 to 1949, his reputation for vision, decisiveness and <b>good</b> <b>humor</b> became even more widely appreciated.|$|E
25|$|Mark Twain {{had better}} stick to his last. He is a capital humorist {{but when he}} poses as a {{publicist}} he gets into trouble straightway. His article in the North American Review is not <b>good</b> <b>humor,</b> and is very bad politics. Some of it, moreover, seems to be recklessly and even libellously untrue....|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} we analyze utterances {{collected}} from the food section in the newspaper O Estado de São Paulo. Such utterances are marked by intertextuality and the assumption that {{they are part of}} the collective memory of men who cook. Their <b>good</b> <b>humored</b> nature, on the one hand, and assorted cultural references, on the other, create a representation of the masculine that both seems to move toward the territory of the feminine but also preserves the disjunction by distinguishing cooking from culinary, i. e., fun from work...|$|R
50|$|Kåta's {{father died}} {{while she was}} at school. After she left school she went home {{to live with her}} mother. Hofgaard visited her {{regularly}} until a biking accident made travel impossible in 1904. Elias Hofgaard died in 1906. After her mother died, Kåta moved in with one of her sisters, and the last ten years of her life she lived at “Døves Vel” at Hamar. She died in February 1947 after a bout with bronchitis. She was described as almost always smiling and <b>good</b> <b>humored,</b> talkative, and with an unshakable faith in God.|$|R
5000|$|During the 1950s, Diaz became {{resident}} photographer at Chicago's famous cultural hub The Tavern Club. The {{club was}} founded in 1927 [...] "to encourage the arts, intellectual recreation and <b>good</b> <b>humored</b> interest in life." [...] Diaz captured images of patrons, dancers and many Jazz greats including the Ramsey Lewis Trio. She also produced pictorial yearbooks for The Tavern Club in 1957 and 1958. While at the Tavern Club, Diaz was mentor to young dancer Dallas Kinney—now Pulitzer prize-winning photojournalist. Dallas Kinney thanked Diaz for her part in launching his photo journalism career on YouTube.|$|R
25|$|In 1937, Michael Meehan {{became the}} first broker banned by the Securities and Exchange Commission for stock {{manipulation}} and transferred his enterprises to his sons.

Radcliffe would travel widely to ballgames and became known for his lively <b>good</b> <b>humor</b> and gentle clowning.|$|E
25|$|Brimer's {{father-in-law}} was {{a friend}} of Michael J. Meehan (1891–1948), a controversial New York stock speculator who made a small investment in Brimer's operation. When Brimer paid a 25% dividend in 1929, Meehan financed the acquisition of 75% of <b>Good</b> <b>Humor</b> of America for $500,000. Meehan's wife, Elizabeth Higgins Meehan, was the registered owner of the stock along with Mrs. John J. Raskob, the wife of another New York stock speculator.|$|E
60|$|The party under Father Ignacio soon {{turned off}} from the main road, and, with the six wagons which fell to their share, journeyed along a. rough country road {{until they reached the}} village. Father Ignacio sat on the leading wagon, and Jack rode {{alongside}} chatting with him. The priest was a stout built man, with a <b>good</b> <b>humored</b> countenance and merry twinkle of the eye, and Jack wondered what could have been the special wrong that induced him to take up a musket and lead his flock to the attack of a French convoy.|$|R
60|$|Three other {{additions}} to the rescue party were made the next morning, {{just as they were}} setting out upon their journey. The first was a little boy called Button Bright, because he had no other name that anyone could remember. He was a fine, manly little fellow, well mannered and <b>good</b> <b>humored,</b> who had only one bad fault. He was continually getting lost. To be sure, Button Bright got found as often as he got lost, but when he was missing his friends could not help being anxious about him.|$|R
