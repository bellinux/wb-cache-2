Phase-contrast synchrotron X-ray microtomography imaging of two deciduous tooth crowns and microfocus CT measurements of the right hemimandible of the Ostuni 1 b fetus were performed at the SYRMEP beamline and at the TomoLab station of the Elettra - Sincrotrone laboratory (Trieste, Italy) in order to refine age at death and to report the enamel developmental history and dental tissue volumes for this fetal individual. The virtual histology allowed to estimate the age at death of the fetus at 31 - 33 gestational weeks. Three severe physiological stress episodes were also identified in the prenatal <b>enamel.</b> These <b>stress</b> episodes occurred during the last two months and half of pregnancy and may relate to the death of both individuals.

40|$|A {{mesoscopic}} {{simulation of}} the process of human enamel laser ablation by Er:YAG and CO 2 lasers is being developed using the finite element method, taking into account the complex structure and chemical composition of this material. A geometric model that allows studying in detail the temperature, stress and displacement distribution within a few enamel rods is presented. The heat generation that takes place inside the enamel at the centre of the laser spot, caused by a non-ablative laser pulse emitted by CO 2 and Er:YAG lasers, was simulated. The sensitivity of our model to the estimated material parameters was studied. Temperature, displacement and stress distribution maps obtained for both lasers are presented.

40|$|Human mothers wean their {{children}} from breast milk at an earlier developmental stage than do ape mothers, resulting in human children chewing solid and semi-solid foods using the deciduous dentition. Mechanical forces generated by chewing solid foods during the post-weaning period travel through not only the deciduous teeth, but also the enamel caps of the developing permanent teeth within the maxilla and mandible, which are not present in the adult face. The effects of mechanical stress propagating through these very stiff structures {{have yet to be}} examined. Based on a heuristic model, we predicted that the enamel of the embedded developing teeth would act to reduce stresses in the surrounding bony elements of the juvenile face. We tested this hypothesis by simulating occlusal loading in a finite element (FE) model of a child’s cranium with a complete set of deciduous teeth and the first permanent molars embedded in the bony crypt in the maxilla. We modeled bone and enamel with appropriate material properties and assessed the effect of embedding high-stiffness <b>enamel</b> structures on <b>stress</b> distribution in the juvenile face.

40|$|Objective In a {{previous}} study on of polymerization contraction stress determinations of adhesives bonded to dentin a continuous decline of stress was observed after the adhesives had been light-cured. The decline was ascribed to stress relief caused by diffusion into the adhesive layer of water and/or solvents, left in the impregnated dentin surface after drying and/or evaporation in the application procedure. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to test the hypothesis that the contraction stress of adhesives bonded to enamel will not decline after light-curing, based on the assumption that water and/or solvents are more efficiently removed from impregnated enamel surfaces in the drying and/or evaporation step. Materials and methods Contraction stress was determined in a tensilometer for three total-etching adhesives Scotchbond multi-purpose, Single bond and One-step plus and four self-etching adhesives Clearfil SE Bond, Clearfil Protect Bond, AdheSE, and Xeno III. The adhesives were placed in a thin layer between a glass plate and a flat dentin or enamel surface pre-treated with phosphoric acid or self-etching primer and light-cured under constrained conditions. Results All adhesives bonded to <b>enamel</b> showed a <b>stress</b> decline, but significantly less than for dentin with the exception of two self-etching adhesives. The greatest decline was found for the total-etching adhesive systems bonded to dentin. The presence of hydrophobic monomers in the adhesives had a significant influence on the decline. Significance The experiments indicate that fluids are withdrawn from the resin impregnated tooth structures, which may result in small defects in the tooth-resin interfaces...|$|R

Under optimal conditions, the zooarchaeology, paleoethnobotany, coprolitic material, and bioarchaeology of an area should be analyzed to determine paleonutrition. This study presents the information gained through a paleonutritional analysis of the Archaic populations of the Lower Pecos Region of the Chihuahuan Desert. It incorporates all four dietary disciplines, and shows that an integrative approach is essential for such analyses. The analysis reveals that the Lower Pecos populations {{had access to the}} nutrients required for a healthy existence. The staples of the population: agave, prickly pear, mesquite, nuts, rabbits, rodents, deer, and fish, were excellent sources of carbohydrates, protein, and fat. The high frequency of dental caries, abscessing, and antemortem tooth loss also indicates that the diet had a high carbohydrate content. The large variety of supplementary dietary items provided essential amino acids, trace elements, vitamins, and minerals. Stress was present in the population, as indicated by the presence of growth arrest lines: Harris lines and <b>enamel</b> hypoplasias. This <b>stress</b> may have been nutritionally related. The diet of the Lower Pecos populations may have been nutritionally unstable during the lean, winter months when only a few dietary staples were available. These staples would not provide all of the nutrients necessary, resulting in nutritional stress in the population. This type of stress was evident in specific individuals who did not have access to a balance of dietary items observed in the general dietary array of the Lower Pecos...|$|R
40|$|Enamel is {{the hardest}} and the stiffest tissue in the human body. The <b>enamel</b> {{undergoes}} multidirectional <b>stresses,</b> withstands multimillion chewing cycles, all while protecting the internal dentin and pulp from damage due to mechanical overload and exposure to the harsh chemical environment of the mouth. Raman spectroscopy allows to study enamel mineral content in a non-destructive and site-specific way. While Raman spectroscopy has been applied in other studies to assess tooth mineralization, there are no studies that {{examine the relationship between}} micro-hardness and mineral content of the untreated enamel. An understanding of this relationship is extremely important in a clinical context. The effect of various agents on enamel hardness was investigated, though the relationship between healthy enamel mineral content and micro-hardness remains obscure. Twenty human incisor teeth were obtained in compliance with the NIH guidelines and imaged site-specifically with a Raman microscope and evaluated with a Brinell hardness measurement device. The front portion of each tooth was divided into apical, medium and cervical regions and subsequently imaged with a Raman microscope in these three locations. The results demonstrated that enamel mineral content varies significantly between individuals and is correlated with the hardness of the enamel. Non-invasive, sample preparation free Raman spectroscopy was successfully employed to measure the mineral content of healthy enamel and it correlated the mineralization score to the hardness measurements of the selected cervical location. The overall level of enamel mineral content may serve as a robust predictor of patients? susceptibility to developing caries, and overall enamels wear resistance, thus allowing for the prevention of caries via clinically available methods of remineralization, fluoride treatment and frequent cleaning...|$|R
40|$|Through the {{analysis}} of human skeletal remains and mortuary practice in Yinxu, this study investigates the impact of early urbanization on the commoners during the Late Shang dynasty (ca. 1250 - 1046 B. C.). A total of 347 individuals {{examined in this study}} represent non-elites who were recovered from two different burial contexts (formally buried in lineage cemeteries and randomly scattered in refuse pits). Frequencies of <b>enamel</b> hypoplasia (childhood <b>stress),</b> cribra orbitalia (childhood stress and frailty) and osteoperiostitis (adult stress) were examined to assess systemic stress exposure. Our results reveal that {{there was no significant difference}} in the frequency of enamel hypoplasia between two burial groups and between sexes, suggesting these urban commoners experienced similar stresses during childhood, but significantly elevated levels of cribra orbitalia and osteoperiostitis were observed in the refuse pit female cohort. Theoretically, urbanization would have resulted in increased population density in the urban centre, declining sanitary conditions, and increased risk of resource shortage. Biologically, children would be more vulnerable to such physiological disturbance; as a result, high percentages of enamel hypoplasia (80. 9 % overall) and cribra orbitalia (30. 3 % overall) are observed in Yin commoners. Adults continued to suffer from stress, resulting in high frequencies of osteoperiostitis (40. 0 % total adults); in particular, in the refuse pit females who may also reflect a compound impact of gender inequality. Our data show that the non-elite urban population in the capital city of Late Shang Dynasty had experienced extensive stress exposure due to early urbanization with further social stratification only worsening the situation, and eventually contributing to collapse of the Shang Dynasty...|$|R

Through the use of SEM - EDS it was determined that (SnL a /FeK a) Y 2 X -ray line intensities arc proportional to the tin coating weight on tinplate. The method was applied to a rapid detinning problem in canned grapefruit sections. The cause of the early corrosion failure was found to be reversed tinplate. An early pining corrosion failure in apple sauce packed in plain tinplate cans was re lated to use of tinplate sensitive to pin ing corrosion in combination with a product contain ing oxygen and nickel as corrosion accelerators. An internal rust ing cosmetic corrosion problem present on the inside tinplate ends of canned mushrooms was caused by exposed steel at lightly tinned surface ridges of tinplate reacting with moisture and oxygen in the product. An early pitting corrosion problem in carrots packed in enamelled cans was related to excessive metal exposure at the side seam weld and at various a reason the can body.

40|$|The δδ 13 C and δ 15 N {{composition}} of incremental segments of tooth dentine {{was used to}} infer infant and childhood diet in a post-medieval London population, and a hunting and gathering Mesolithic/Neolithic group from Latvia. Health was analysed using defects on the tooth <b>enamel</b> caused by <b>stress,</b> termed <b>enamel</b> hypoplasia. The populations, which differ markedly in their economy, diet and health, were selected because {{of the difference in}} childhood experiences between the two groups. The results were used to consider questions about childhood, including how early diet may have been influenced by social factors such as class or status, the effect this could have on population dynamics and how childhood diet and health are related. The results show that the London individuals were rarely breastfed beyond 6 months and in some instances not at all. A small isotopic difference between males and females was observed which could be caused by dietary or physiological differences. The peak incidence of hypoplasia may be related to developmental patterns, rather than stress caused by weaning. The Zvejnieki individuals had a slightly longer breastfeeding duration. Those buried with pendants consumed a different diet in childhood to those without pendants, suggesting a complex social system, possibly indicating that diet was related to the role a person had within the community. There is a suggestion diet may have shifted between the Middle Mesolithic and Late Neolithic, although not dramatically. Neither population have elevated δ 13 C often associated with breastfeeding. The early life histories of the groups are not compared directly, but general observations concerning the children’s lives are considered. It is concluded that economy is not a reliable predictor of infant feeding strategies, as hunter-gatherers provide children with solid foods at a similar time to industrial groups. Intra-population variability was found to be a feature of all socio-economic groups. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|R
40|$|This study {{considers}} {{the effects that}} variations in living conditions have on animals, in particular pigs, and how these differences can be examined using the archaeological record. A wider theme examines whether changes in the husbandry of animals can be understood more clearly and recognised more accurately by employing recently developing techniques and whether any of these could be beneficial to use as standard practice. It investigates how, using a much wider than normal range of approaches zooarchaeological evidence at archaeological sites {{can be used to}} answer questions about husbandry in a much better way than any of the approaches in isolation. This research used six key faunal assemblages from sites in Western Flanders as case studies to investigate these questions, with a particular focus reserved for pigs. The sites used for the primary research comprised Raversijde (15 th century AD), Koekelare (15 th century AD), Ename (14 th century AD), Londerzeel (13 th- 14 th centuries AD), Veurne (10 th- 11 th centuries AD) and Oudenberg (4 th century AD), all sites from Western Flanders and predominantly dating to the medieval period. The sites exhibited differences in both physical location and social context which were believed likely to explain any variations husbandry strategies should they exist. Rsults showed that, as population pressures increased during the early modern period, a nuanced change in pig-keeping from pannage to stall-keeping occurred. It has been practically impossible to identify this change from the archaeological record through traditional means. At Raversijde, in particular the type of pig-keeping being employed was clearly determined as stall-keeping, especially seen through the high frequency of <b>enamel</b> hypoplasias, indicating <b>stress,</b> but the spacing of teeth in the jaws indicated good nourishment in general. The techniques utilised in this project include dental microwear, linear enamel hypoplasia, and identification of pathologies or anomalies in both teeth and post-cranial elements, set alongside more traditional examinations of both mandibular and post-cranial elements. This provided an in-depth consideration of how recent scientific developments and established standard zooarchaeological techniques could be integrated, and also showed the potential in exploring further methodologies as standard for such sites. As well as successfully differentiating husbandry practices in the various sites examined, the research also highlighted the necessity to explore further what is meant by a ‘typical’ domestic pig. ...|$|R
40|$|There are {{two main}} issues that pose a problem with {{inferring}} health from the skeletons of past populations. Selective mortality refers {{to the fact that}} we can only research individuals who died and that they might not be representative of all individuals that existed at that age. Heterogeneity in frailty refers to the possibility that not all individuals are equal in terms of their risk of getting sick or dying and the factors that contribute to this difference might be hidden. This study addresses these two problems by looking at tooth crown sizes between individuals who died in childhood versus adulthood, as well as looking at the tooth crown sizes between teeth that show signs of physiological <b>stress</b> (<b>enamel</b> hypoplasia) and teeth that do not. Teeth might turn out smaller than their maximum genetic potential under developmental stress. It is researched if this same developmental stress caused individuals to be frailer than their peers, which might be reflected in reduced longevity and vulnerability to physiological stress episodes. The mesiodistal and buccolingual tooth crown sizes are measured for the entire dentition of 115 individuals between seven and 50 + years of age from the predominately 19 th century Middenbeemster cemetery (the Netherlands). The results show that four buccolingual tooth crown dimensions (maxillary first molar, mandibular canine, first premolar and second molar) were significantly smaller for subadults than for adults, with all buccolingual dimensions having a tendency to be at least a bit smaller. For three of these dimensions, the significantly reduced tooth crown size is wholly attributed to the juveniles having smaller tooth crowns. Six dimensions of four teeth (maxillary second premolar and first molar, mandibular second premolar and first molar) were significantly smaller for teeth with and without enamel hypoplasia. These results indicate that increased frailty, which is reflected in a reduced tooth crown size, does affect mortality, more so for the juveniles than for adolescents. Besides a higher mortality risk, a higher risk of undergoing physiological stressors during early childhood, reflected in enamel hypoplasia presence, is also shown for individuals with reduced tooth crown sizes. Enamel hypoplasia lesions, thus, more likely reflect a weaker individual rather than a stronger individual. This study shows that selective mortality and hidden heterogeneity in frailty are issues that need to be considered in reconstructions of the health of past populations, however teeth are an excellent means to compare circumstances during the period of growth between survivors and non-survivors and to identify if these might account for the differences in longevity...|$|R
