5|$|Schlosberg's contribution, is, in many ways, a {{response}} to challenges made to his Defining <b>Environmental</b> <b>Justice</b> (2007). Schlosberg aims to step beyond previous accounts of animal rights or environmentalism as requirements of justice by deploying a mixed capabilities/deliberation approach applicable to both ecosystems and nonhuman animals. Schlosberg challenges criticisms of his capabilities approach (specifically, a capabilities approach which moves beyond humans) grounded {{in the existence of}} conflicts of capabilities, claiming that a form of deliberative democracy can overcome the problem posed by these conflicts. His mixed account, he claims, provides a form of justice appropriate for thinking about human and nonhuman individuals and collectives in the Anthropocene.|$|E

Drawing on an emerging literature on critical making, this paper explains what has been learned about the material geographies of web 2. 0 and commodity activism through this making process...|$|R

To answer this question this perspective outlines the origins, successes and failures of the <b>environmental</b> and climate <b>justice</b> concepts, {{with a view to}} both distinguishing the energy justice field, and providing cautionary tales for it.
