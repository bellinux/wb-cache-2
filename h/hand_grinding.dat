50|$|Seventy years ago, life in San Pedro Atocpan {{was similar}} to just about any other rural {{community}} growing corn and beans. At that time only four neighborhoods prepared mole for town festivals: Panchimalco, Ocotitla, Nuztla and Tula, but those who prepared it were generally prominent women in their communities. In the 1940s, one family had {{the idea of making}} the long trek to Mexico City proper to sell some of their mole at the La Merced market. It was successful, but they brought with them only two kilos, since it was made by <b>hand</b> <b>grinding</b> the ingredients. With the paving of the main road (now the Mexico City-Oaxtepec highway) and the introduction of electricity in 1947, it became easier to make and transport mole to the city. Since then, a sauce that was traditionally made for family use became a commodity for the town. The town now produces 60% of the mole made in Mexico and 89% of the mole consumed in Mexico City, adding up to between 28,000 and 30,000 tons of mole produced each year.|$|E
50|$|Until the mid-20th century, San Pedro Atocpan, {{located in}} the {{mountains}} south of Mexico City proper (but still part of the Federal District) {{was similar to the}} other agricultural communities surrounding it, growing corn, fava beans and nopales (prickly pear cactus). Electricity and other modern conveniences arrived late, allowing the community to retain more of its traditions later.In 1940, Father Damian Sartes San Roman came to the parish of San Pedro Atocpan and saw the potential in marketing the product to raise living standards in the area. At that time, only four neighborhoods prepared mole for town festivals: Panchimalco, Ocotitla, Nuztla and Tula, but those who prepared it were generally prominent women in their communities.

The arrival of electricity in the late 1940s made the use of a powered mill possible, and better roads made the trek to the city easier. Some of these mills were bought or financed by Father Sartes, but the mole was still cooked in a clay pot over a wood fire. In the 1970s, he was part of a small group which became a cooperative, which constructed the Las Cazuelas restaurant. This is where the first Mole Exhibition was held in 1978.|$|E

40|$|This study {{provides}} {{a systematic analysis}} {{of the effect of}} common acid sulfate soil (ASS) sample pre-treatments (namely freezing, oven drying, and grinding) on chromium-reducible sulfur (SCR) and water-soluble sulfate determinations. The results show that oven drying and <b>hand</b> <b>grinding</b> of the samples prior to analysis resulted in a decrease in SCR (i. e. up to 20 % compared to those of frozen samples). This lower SCR value was partly due to the oxidation of sulfides in the oven. For oven-dried ASS materials, more intensive grinding in a ring mill increased SCR values, most likely by abrading coatings from pyrite grains. For oven-dried mineral ASS materials the highest SCR values were obtained with 1 min of ring mill grinding, but for soils with appreciable organic matter (such as peat), 5 min of ring mill grinding gave the highest values. The results indicate that for some ASS materials, oven drying, regardless of the ensuing grinding procedure, results in underestimated SCR values. This study also demonstrates that an artifact of oven drying ASS materials can be greatly increased water-soluble sulfate contents...|$|E
