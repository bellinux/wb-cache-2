When it could do so, the Ordnance Department removed its property to the Washington Arsenal, now Fort McNair, or transferred it to a still-garrisoned fort, though with post-war budget cuts, these were becoming <b>few</b> <b>and</b> <b>far</b> between.|$|E

Skirmishes were <b>few</b> <b>and</b> <b>far</b> between, but some French units suffered heavy losses. For the attack, the Germans had used the new C-250 Flammbombe (Flame Bomb) which had only been cleared for use 24 hours earlier. The incendiary bomb did some damage to hangars and parked aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Adult dusky sharks have a {{broad and}} varied diet, {{consisting}} mostly of bony fishes, sharks and rays, and cephalopods, but also occasionally crustaceans, sea stars, bryozoans, sea turtles, marine mammals, carrion, and garbage. This species is viviparous with a three-year reproductive cycle; females bear litters of 314 young after a gestation period of 2224 months, after {{which there is a}} year of rest before they become pregnant again. Females are capable of storing sperm for long periods, as their encounters with suitable mates may be <b>few</b> <b>and</b> <b>far</b> between due to their nomadic lifestyle and low overall abundance. Dusky sharks are one of the slowest-growing and latest-maturing sharks, not reaching adulthood until around 20 years of age.|$|E

5|$|Although {{this was}} a good start, Hastings was not a {{particularly}} well-known barrister, and cases were <b>few</b> <b>and</b> <b>far</b> between. To get around the lack of funds Hastings accepted a pupil, and for the next year Hastings lived almost exclusively off the fees that the pupil paid him. To maintain the appearance of an active and busy chamber Hastings had his clerk borrow papers from other barristers and give them to the pupil to work on, claiming that they were cases of Hastings.|$|E
5|$|Political {{parties had}} {{developed}} in the United States before Kentucky became a state. Because most early Kentuckians were Virginians, they naturally allied with the Democratic-Republicans, the party of Thomas Jefferson and James Madison; the latter was a cousin of George Madison, the state's sixth governor. Political victories were <b>few</b> <b>and</b> <b>far</b> between for Federalists in Kentucky, and none of Kentucky's governors {{were members of the}} Federalist Party. Military service was the most important consideration for voters in Kentucky's early gubernatorial elections. John Breathitt, elected Kentucky's eleventh governor in 1832, was the first Kentucky governor not to have served in the military.|$|E
5|$|The communists {{moved out}} to take the Plain of Jars again in 1967. Laotian {{victories}} were <b>few</b> <b>and</b> <b>far</b> between {{and by the end}} of the year the situation had become critical, even with the support provided by the American and Laotian Air Forces. PAVN, having a complete understanding of the American military system, began to attack TACAN facilities. U.S. intelligence indicated that between December 1967 and August 1968, the combined strength of PAVN and Pathet Lao forces increased from about 51,000 to over 110,000. The PAVN contingent comprised an estimated 34,000 combat troops, 6,000 advisors, and 18,000 support troops. On 6 December Lima Site 44 was overrun and on the 25th PAVN forces captured Lima Site 61, the site of a mobile facility. All of these attacks were part of a coordinated effort to reduce the ability of the Americans to strike the communist logistical system during the Tet Offensive.|$|E

25|$|As {{the losses}} piled {{up and the}} team was seen as playing uninspired football, the Rams' already dwindling fan base was reduced even further. By 1994, support for the Rams had {{withered}} {{to the point where}} they were barely part of the Los Angeles sports landscape. With sellouts becoming <b>fewer</b> <b>and</b> <b>far</b> between, the Rams saw more of their games blacked out in Southern California. One of the few bright spots during this time was Jerome Bettis, a bruising running back from Notre Dame. Bettis flourished in Knox' offense, running for 1,429 yards as a rookie, and 1,025 in his sophomore effort.|$|R

5|$|The {{image of}} a Wild West filled with countless gunfights was a myth {{generated}} primarily by dime-novel authors in the late 19th century. An estimate of 20,000 men in the American West were killed by gunshot between 1866 and 1900, and over 21,586 total casualties during the American Indian Wars from 1850 to 1890. The most notable and well-known {{took place in the}} states/territories of Arizona, New Mexico, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. Actual gunfights in the Old West were very rare, very <b>few</b> <b>and</b> <b>far</b> between, but when gunfights did occur, the cause for each varied. Some were simply the result of the heat of the moment, while others were longstanding feuds, or between bandits and lawmen. Lawless violence such as range wars like the Lincoln County War and clashes with Indians were also a cause. Some of these shootouts became famous, while others faded into history with only a few accounts surviving. To prevent gunfights from happening, many cities in the American frontier, such as Dodge City and Tombstone, put up a local ordinance to prohibit firearms in the area.|$|E

However, N'Diaye's first-team {{appearances}} decreased {{over the course of}} the 2009-10 season, and they were even <b>fewer</b> <b>and</b> <b>far</b> between the following year. He finished the 2010-11 season on loan at Swindon Town, suffering relegation from League One, before moving to League Two side Southend United on a season-long loan in the 2011-12 season. However, this loan was cancelled after a bust-up with a team-mate, and his contract at Palace was also cancelled 10 months early at this time.|$|R
5000|$|Annuals {{published}} by DC and particularly Marvel became <b>fewer</b> <b>and</b> <b>far</b> between {{in the late}} 1990s, mainly due to the near-collapse of the comic book industry {{in the wake of}} the speculator boom; annuals were seen as an unnecessary risk in a climate where many monthly publications were in danger of cancellation for lack of sales (especially at Marvel, which filed for bankruptcy during this time). When the industry began to recover from the [...] "bust", annuals began re-appearing on occasion, but by no means as regularly as before the [...] "bust", when numbered series of annuals had reached the teens or twenties, indicating over a decade of regular publication.|$|R

30|$|A new, more {{clinically}} applicable, model {{identification method}} {{has been developed}} to replace the old approach [17 – 20]. The new method only requires a minimal set of discrete measurements, such as stroke volume and mean aortic pressure, that are easily obtainable in the ICU. Whereas the previous method required measurements of continuous waveforms, including the highly invasive (or expensive) measures of the time varying ventricular volume traces, which {{require a lot of}} computation processing. The measurements used by the new approach are <b>far</b> <b>fewer</b> <b>and</b> <b>far</b> less intensive to obtain and utilize. Thus, this study shows a significant step forward in making this type of model-based approach more clinically applicable and accessible without added clinical effort or burden to the patient.|$|R
