However, the high dimensionality of parameter space is a serious modeling challenge for emerging VLSI technologies, where the models are increasingly more complex. In this paper, we propose and validate a feature selection method to reduce the <b>circuit</b> <b>modeling</b> complexity associated with high parameter dimensionality. Despite the commonly used methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), this method is capable of dealing with mixed Gaussian and non-Gaussian parameters, and performs a parameter selection in the input space rather than creating a new space. By considering non-linear dependencies among input parameters and outputs, the method results in an effective parameter selection.

40|$|High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMT 2 ̆ 7 s) {{have emerged}} as the device of choice for high {{frequency}} and low-noise amplifier applications. To design superior low-noise amplifier circuits at high frequencies, accurate small signal and noise model of the device must be extracted. ^ Traditionally, test-amplifiers and wafer probe measurements {{have been used to}} perform HEMT modeling. A critical study of the two techniques resulted in the design and construction of a new test fixture that attempts to combine the advantages of these two techniques. In this new fixture, a device is probed by a matched test amplifier circuit. It was found that the calibration accuracy of such a fixture was limited due to coupling between the probes and the difficulty in fabricating appropriate calibration standards. A new type of calibration standards made of micro-coaxial lines was used to calibrate the fixture. To correct for the coupling between probes, a form of a new technique called 11 -term calibration was used. ^ The effect of coupling between conventional wafer-probes on the accuracy of S-parameter measurement of a discrete HEMT was studied. A second form of the 11 -term calibration technique was used to calibrate the coupled wafer-probes. This procedure uses calibration standards that are readily available on a commercial wafer-probe calibration-substrate. ^ A critical study of HotFET/ColdFET equivalent-circuit extraction procedure revealed certain errors that can adversely affect high frequency HEMT modeling. A modified HotFET/ColdFET technique has been demonstrated, which eliminates this error, and in fact, simplifies the procedure. The new procedure uses just one forward bias measurement at low gate-current (as opposed to several high gate-current measurements required in the original procedure). ^ A low noise HEMT modeling is incomplete without extracting its noise model. The Pospieszalski noise model, which involves the determination of equivalent temperature of the drain-to-source resistance in the <b>device</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>model,</b> simplifies the task of noise model extraction.

An automatic model parameter extraction system that simultaneously integrates evolutionary and numerical optimization techniques for optimal characterization of very large scale integration (VLSI) devices has recently been advanced [1]. In this paper, to accelerate the extraction process, a parallelization of the genetic algorithm (GA) for VLSI <b>device</b> equivalent <b>circuit</b> <b>model</b> parameter extraction is developed. The GA implemented in the extraction system is mainly parallelized with a diffusion scheme on a PCbased Linux cluster with message passing interface libraries.
