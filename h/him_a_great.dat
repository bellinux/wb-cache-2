5|$|Alexander was erudite and patronized both {{arts and}} sciences. However, {{he had little}} {{interest}} in sports or the Olympic games (unlike his father), seeking only the Homeric ideals of honour (timê) and glory (kudos). He had great charisma and force of personality, characteristics which made <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> leader. His unique abilities were further demonstrated by the inability of any of his generals to unite Macedonia and retain the Empire after his death—only Alexander had the ability to do so.|$|E
5|$|For Reyner Banham, Tange was a prime {{exemplar of}} the use of Brutalist architecture. His use of Béton brut {{concrete}} finishes in a raw and undecorated way combined with his civic projects such as the redevelopment of Tokyo Bay made <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> influence on British architects during the 1960s. Brutalist architecture has been criticised for being soulless and for promoting the exclusive use of a material that is poor at withstanding long exposures to natural weather.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} work with {{scheduled}} psychoactive chemicals, Shulgin obtained a DEA Schedule I license for an analytical laboratory, which allowed him to synthesize and possess any otherwise illicit drug. Shulgin set up a chemical synthesis laboratory in a small building behind his house, which gave <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal of career autonomy. Shulgin used this freedom to synthesize and test the effects of potentially psychoactive drugs.|$|E

5|$|Mabel Tolkien {{taught her}} two {{children}} at home. Ronald, as he was known in the family, was a keen pupil. She taught <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal of botany and awakened in him the enjoyment of {{the look and feel}} of plants. Young Tolkien liked to draw landscapes and trees, but his favourite lessons were those concerning languages, and his mother taught him the rudiments of Latin very early.|$|E
5|$|With the Matabele wars over, Burnham {{decided it}} was time to leave Africa and move on to other adventures. The family {{returned}} to California. Soon after, Fred traveled to Alaska and the Yukon to prospect in the Klondike Gold Rush, taking with him his eldest son Roderick, who was then 12 years old. On hearing of the Spanish–American War, Burnham rushed home to volunteer his services, but the war had ended before he could get to the fighting. Burnham returned to the Klondike having played no part in the war. Colonel Theodore Roosevelt regretted this as much as Burnham and paid <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> tribute in his book.|$|E
5|$|During 655, Æthelhere {{joined with}} Penda in {{an assault on}} Northumbria. Steven Plunkett asserts that Æthelhere's motive for {{changing}} sides was to deflect Penda's attention from East Anglia {{and the destruction of}} his kingdom that would have ensued. Penda invaded Northumbria with a force of thirty duces regii (or royal commanders) under his command that included a large contingent of Britons. He laid siege to Oswiu at Maes Gai, in the district of Loidis, which was probably at that time within the sphere of influence of the British kingdom of Rheged. Oswiu offered <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> ransom of treasure which, according to Bede, was refused (or according to the Historia Brittonum, was accepted and distributed)— in either case Penda resolved on battle and the destruction of the Northumbrians. Oswiu had a much smaller force, but in the event the Welsh armies of King Cadfæl of Gwynedd decamped on the eve of battle and Penda's ally Œthelwald of Deira stood aside to await the outcome.|$|E

Duffy then went on to work as the musical director for Williams' Close Encounters World Tour.|$|E
25|$|He is {{the founder}} of Sakigake, and he can hear the voices of the little people. He is also the father of Fuka-Eri, and his real name is Tamotsu Fukada. He acts as a prophet for Sakigake.

25|$|In 1722, he {{returned}} to Paris for good, and here he published his most important work of music theory, Traité de l'harmonie (Treatise on Harmony). This soon won <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> reputation, and it was followed in 1726 by his Nouveau système de musique théorique. In 1724 and 1729 (or 1730), he also published two more collections of harpsichord pieces.|$|E
50|$|Potter {{was from}} Richmond, Virginia, {{and seems to}} have come from a middle-class background. Before the Great War, he {{attended}} Yale, leaving <b>him</b> with <b>a</b> permanent half-Yankee accent that sometimes earned him suspicious looks from other Confederates. Potter's time there also gave <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> understanding of the United States than most of his compatriots.|$|R

25|$|His {{religious}} legacy {{has become}} a source of considerable controversy in India, with some groups proclaiming <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> warrior for the faith or Ghazi, while others revile him as a bigot who allegedly massacred Hindus, the accounts of which come from colonial British sources that have been criticized by some historians as unreliable or fabricated, intended to present Sultan as a tyrant and the British as liberators.|$|E
25|$|Sikorsky's mother, Mariya Stefanovna Sikorskaya (née Temryuk-Cherkasova), was a {{physician}} who did not work professionally. She is sometimes called Zinaida Sikorsky. While homeschooling young Igor, she gave <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> love for art, especially in the life and work of Leonardo da Vinci, and the stories of Jules Verne. In 1900, at age 11, he accompanied his father to Germany and through conversations with his father, became interested in natural sciences. After returning home, Sikorsky began to experiment with model flying machines, and by age 12, {{he had made a}} small rubber band-powered helicopter.|$|E
25|$|Bhindranwale {{has been}} noted for {{strongly}} opposing prime minister Indira Gandhi for alleged policies against Punjab during Dharam Yudh Morcha (battle for righteousness). Later that year she ordered the attack on Golden Temple, Sikhism's most sacred Gurdwara, in Amritsar on the martyrdom anniversary of 5th Sikh Guru, Guru Arjan Dev ji when the complex had pilgrims. Since his death, Bhindranwale has remained a controversial figure in Indian history. While the Sikhs' highest temporal authority Akal Takht describe <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> martyr of the Sikh Nation, who made supreme sacrifice {{for the sake of}} faith, the Indian government views him as an extremist.|$|E

25|$|The House of Braganza {{originated}} with Afonso I, an illegitimate son of King John I of Portugal, {{founder of the}} House of Aviz, and Inês Pires. Though Afonso was illegitimate, his father valued and cared for <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal, demonstrated by his arrangement of Afonso's marriage to Beatriz Pereira de Alvim, daughter of Nuno Álvares Pereira, Portugal's most important general and a personal friend of King John I. As well as increasing his social status by his marriage into a well-established house, Afonso also became the eighth Count of Barcelos, an honour ceded {{to him by his}} father-in-law, who had been made the seventh count by John I.|$|E
25|$|The Third Symphony was a {{transitional}} work. Glazunov admitted its composition caused <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal of trouble. With the Fourth Symphony, {{he came into}} his mature style. Dedicated to Anton Rubinstein, the Fourth was written as a deliberately cosmopolitan work by a Russian looking outward to the West, yet it remained unmistakably Russian in tone. He continued to synthesize nationalist tradition and Western technique in the Fifth Symphony. By the time Glazunov wrote his Seventh Symphony, his duties at the Conservatory had slowed his rate of composition. After his Eighth Symphony, his heavy drinking may have started taking a toll on his creativity, as well. He sketched one movement of a Ninth Symphony but left the work unfinished.|$|E
25|$|At {{the inauguration}} of the UN in 1945, no {{delegation}} from Poland had been invited. The Polish pianist Artur Rubinstein, who was to perform the opening concert at the inauguration, began the concert by stating his deep disappointment that the conference {{did not have a}} delegation from Poland. Rubinstein later described becoming overwhelmed by a blind fury and angrily pointing out to the public the absence of the Polish flag. He then sat down to the piano and played Poland Is Not Yet Lost loudly and slowly, repeating the final part in a great thunderous forte. When he had finished, the public rose to their feet and gave <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> ovation.|$|E

In 1897 he married (Florence) Elizabeth Gertrude, daughter of Colonel James Theodore Griffin, of the United States army; there was one child, Audrey, of the marriage. Elizabeth Lucas was a writer, and husband and wife collaborated on several children's books.|$|E
25|$|Snorri also relates that Aðils loved good {{horses and}} had the best horses in his days (interestingly, the {{contemporary}} Gothic scholar Jordanes noted that the Swedes were famed for their good horses). One horse was named Slöngvi and another one Raven, which he had taken from Áli. From this horse he had bred a horse also named Raven which he sent to king Godgest of Hålogaland, but Godgest could not manage it and fell from it and died, in Omd {{on the island of}} Andøya. Aðils himself died in a similar way at the Dísablót. Aðils was riding around the Disa shrine when Raven stumbled and fell, and the king was thrown forward and hit his skull on a stone. The Swedes called <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> king and buried him at Uppsala. He was succeeded by Eysteinn.|$|E
25|$|Natural talent {{combined}} with aggression and passion made Qadir {{one of the}} most successful spinners of his era. He had a distinct run-up, bounding in to the crease, and a great variety of deliveries: there was the orthodox leg-break, the topspinner, two googlies and the flipper. He was unique for bowling leg spin at a time when it was not only rare but considered obsolete, and he kept the torch alight for a generation of leg spinners. His fervent appeals made <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> favourite with the spectators but sometimes got him into trouble with umpires. Qadir played 67 Test matches during 1977–90 and took 236 wickets, with an average of 32.80, including 15 five-wicket hauls. His best bowling performance was against England at the Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore in 1987. He also scored 1,029 runs including three fifties.|$|E
