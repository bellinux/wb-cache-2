40|$|AbstractPurpose: Patients with {{cardiovascular}} disorders frequently need anticoagulation for diagnostic studies, surgical procedures, and therapy. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is {{a relatively}} common complication of heparin therapy that can result in thrombosis and subsequent limb loss or death, necessitating use of alternative anticoagulants. Methods: Two patients who needed cardiac surgery had thrombocytopenia induced by exposure to heparin and heparin-coated tubing. Several assays were examined {{for their ability to}} monitor intraoperative anticoagulation of a factor Xa inhibitor, <b>danaparoid</b> <b>sodium.</b> Results: In vitro, celite and kaolin activated clotting times and activated partial thromboplastin time were prolonged linearly in the presence of increasing concentrations of <b>danaparoid</b> <b>sodium.</b> Aprotinin did not alter the linearity of the response but did alter its slope. In vivo, activated clotting times and activated partial thromboplastin time were insensitive to clinically significant changes in <b>danaparoid</b> <b>sodium</b> plasma levels during cardiopulmonary bypass. Correction in activated partial thromboplastin time lagged 2 hours behind clinically important changes in anti-factor Xa levels. Only anti-factor Xa levels were adequate to monitor intraoperative <b>danaparoid</b> <b>sodium</b> levels. Conclusion: Anticoagulation for cardiopulmonary bypass can be successfully performed with <b>danaparoid</b> <b>sodium</b> and intraoperative anti-factor Xa monitoring.

40|$|A 60 -year-old {{woman with}} a 17 -year-old {{prosthetic}} tiltingdisc mitral valve (MV) and chronic atrial fibrillation underwent emergency redo MV replacement for a stuck valve with a bioprosthetic valve (Medtronic Mosaic 27). Trans-esophageal echocardiography (TEE) on the fourth postoper-ative day showed a normal bioprosthetic valve. On the sixth postoperative day while the patient was still on intravenous heparin, her platelet count dropped to 63 000 /L and a heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) antibody assay was positive. Heparin was stopped, and the patient was treated with intravenous <b>danaparoid</b> <b>sodium,</b> a factor Xa inhibitor. Oral warfarin was started when thrombocytopenia resolved.

40|$|We {{report a}} case of heparin-induced {{thrombocytopenia}} thrombosis (HITT) syndrome in a patient prophylactically treated with low molecular weight heparin. A 66 -year-old men underwent radiofrequency-assisted partial liver resection for colorectal carcinoma liver metastases a year-and-ahalf {{after he had been}} operated for rectal cancer. In the postoperative period, patient was prophilactically treated with reviparin sodium. On the 8 th postoperative day, the platelet count decreased by more than 50 % without clinical signs of thrombosis. HITT syndrome was suspected on the 19 th postoperative day, after iliacofemoropopliteal thrombosis had developed, and related diagnosis was supported by the strongly positive particle gel agglutination technique immunoassay. Heparin was withdrawn and alternative anticoagulant, <b>danaparoid</b> <b>sodium,</b> was introduced in therapeutic doses. Despite delayed recognition, favorable clinical outcome was achieved. HITT syndrome should be considered with priority among the possible causes of thrombocytopenia in a surgical patient on heparin...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Emphysematous {{cystitis}} (EC) is {{a comparatively}} rare {{urinary tract infection}} characterized by air within the bladder wall and lumen and is usually associated with immunosuppression or poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. Case presentation We report a case of EC in a 70 -year-old man who recently underwent transrectal ultrasound needle-guided prostate biopsy, after which he underwent pylorogastrectomy. He {{did not have any}} history of diabetes mellitus or any immunosuppressive disease. The patient developed severe sepsis, requiring intravenous antibiotics and urinary catheterization. Despite therapy, the patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Therefore, he was admitted to the intensive care unit, antibiotic coverage was broadened, and <b>danaparoid</b> <b>sodium</b> and sivelestat sodium hydrate was administered. After 20 [*]days, the patient’s condition improved, and on the 28 th day, the patient was discharged to home in a good condition without any sequelae. Conclusion Prompt diagnosis and treatment are warranted to prevent potential morbidity of and mortality in cases of EC. </p...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo deste relato é fazer uma revisão a fim de obter informações atualizadas sobre trombocitopenia induzida por heparina, suas manifestações clínicas, seu diagnóstico e seu manejo terapêutico. Após, concluímos que a trombocitopenia induzida por heparina é uma complicação comum em pacientes submetidos a tratamento com heparina, indiferentemente da doença de base. Complicações trombóticas potencialmente fatais têm sido descritas. Por essa razão, se houver suspeita de trombocitopenia induzida por heparina, uma abordagem adequada incluindo suspensão precoce da heparina é mandatória. Produtos que substituem a heparina incluem hirudina e danaparóide sódico. Heparina de baixo peso {{molecular}} é contra-indicada. The aim of {{this paper}} is to review current information about the clinical manifestations, diagnosis and management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. This was achieved by a bibliographic review using Public Medline and consulting Hematology textbooks. From this study we concluded that heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is a common complication of patients exposed to heparin therapy regardless of underlying conditions. Potentially fatal thrombotic complications have been reported. Therefore, if heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is suspected, an adequate approach including early heparin discontinuation is mandatory. Alternative products for heparin include hirudin and <b>danaparoid</b> <b>sodium.</b> Low-molecular-weight heparin is contraindicated...|$|E
40|$|International audienceINDICATIONS: Direct inhibitors of thrombin, such as hirudin, are {{directed}} against the active site and the recognition site of thrombin. Because of their low-molecular-weight, they can inactivate thrombin bound to fibrin. Prevention of thromboembolic complications in patients undergoing primary total hip or knee replacement is now an authorized indication of desirudin in France. The recommended treatment for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is lepirudin {{when there is a}} clinically evident thrombosis and <b>danaparoid</b> <b>sodium,</b> a mixture of anticoagulant glycosaminoglycans in an antithrombotic prophylaxis setting. LMWH: Low-molecular weight heparins are not yet authorized in France for the treatment of pulmonary embolism. However, deep venous thrombosis can be securely treated with one daily fixed dose of nadroparin or tinzaparin. ORAL ANTICOAGULATION: The duration of anticoagulation therapy in patients with venous thromboembolism remains controversial. Three to six months of therapy is recommended after a first episode of venous thromboembolism; the shorter regimen may be chosen when there is an identifiable and transient risk factor, and the longer when the thrombosis is idiopathic. In the context of primary prevention of ischaemic heart disease low intensity oral anticoagulation could be recommended in men at high risk...|$|E
40|$|Heparin binds to {{platelets}} and {{can cause}} platelet proaggregating and potentiating effects, possibly causing thrombocytopenia, particularly in patients in intensive care with hyperaggregable platelets. In this study we compared the platelet proaggregating and potentiating effects of unfractionated heparin (UH), 2 low molecular weight (LMW) heparins, enoxaparin and dalteparin, and a heparinoid, <b>danaparoid</b> <b>sodium</b> (orgaran), to platelets of an ICU patient population and a normal control group. In both populations UH caused platelet aggregation in a dose-dependent manner. This occurred in the therapeutic range of the drug, with as little as 0. 5 U/ml UH. The LMW heparins caused less and the heparinoid least platelet aggregation. Generally, the aggregation observed in ICU patients was greater than in the normal population. The potentiating effects of the 4 drugs in association with physiological agonists was examined. Similar patterns of potentiation were observed in both populations, with UH causing significant enhancement of platelet aggregation, the LMW heparins intermediate and heparinoid least enhancement. There was substantial variability in the individuals' platelets' reactions to the drugs, in particular to UH. Our findings suggest that UH has the greatest effect, the low molecular weight heparins an intermediate effect and the heparinoid the least propensity to cause platelet activation...|$|E
30|$|A 69 -year-old female was {{transported to}} the {{emergency}} room with symptoms relating to polymyalgia and polyarthralgia. On first presentation, she reported no notable past medical history, including MM. Clinical course: She was alert and oriented, with vital signs as follows: blood pressure, 99 / 59 mmHg; heart rate, 102 bpm; respiratory rate, 34 /min; SpO 2 92 % (room air); and body temperature, 38.9 °C. Hematological investigations indicated anemia, a low platelet and leukocyte count, an elevated D-dimer value and an elevated C-reactive protein level. Based on these results, she was diagnosed with sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and admitted into the intensive care unit for general management. Meropenem were initially administrated for sepsis and <b>Danaparoid</b> <b>sodium</b> was administered to treat the DIC. A blood cultivation test grew PM and the antibiotic prescription was tailored to Cefazolin. Electrophoresis was performed and showed IgG κ type M-protein during hospitalization. Because her fever recurred, the antibiotics were tailored to Ceftriaxone. Her vital signs gradually normalized and her general condition, including the polymyalgia and polyarthralgia, gradually improved. On hospital day 29, she had resumed activities of daily living and was discharged, with anemia and M-proteinemia remaining. Post-discharge, bone marrow aspiration was performed at follow-up showing more than 35 % of plasma cells and symptomatic MM was diagnosed.|$|E
40|$|Aim: To compare {{clinical}} outcomes in a randomised comparison of treatment with <b>danaparoid</b> <b>sodium</b> (a heparinoid), or dextran 70, for heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia (HIT) plus thrombosis. Methods: Forty-two patients with recent thrombosis and a clinical diagnosis of probable HIT who presented at ten Australian hospitals during a study period of six and one half years {{were randomly assigned}} to open-label treatment with intravenous danaparoid or dextran 70, each combined with oral warfarin. Thirty-four patients (83 %) had a positive platelet aggregation or 14 C-serotonin release test for HIT antibody. Twenty-five received danaparoid as a bolus injection of 2400 anti-Xa units followed by 400 units per hour for 2 h, 300 units per hour for 2 h, and then 200 units per hour for five days. Seventeen received 1000 mL dextran 70 on day one and then 500 mL on days 2 - 5. Patients were reviewed daily for clinical evidence of thrombus progression or resolution, fresh thrombosis or embolism, bleeding or other complications. The primary trial endpoint was the proportion of thromboembolic events with complete clinical resolution by the time of discharge from hospital. Results: With danaparoid, there was complete clinical recovery from 56 % of thromboembolic events compared to 14 % after dextran 70 (Odds Ratio 10. 53, 95 % Confidence Interval 1. 6 - 71. 4; p = 0. 02). Clinical recovery with danaparoid was complete or partial in 86 % of thromboembolic events compared with 53 % after dextran 70 (Odds Ratio 4. 55, 95 % Confidence Interval 1. 2 - 16. 7; p = 0. 03). Overall clinical effectiveness of danaparoid was rated as high or moderate in 88 % of patients compared with 47 % for dextran 70 (p = 0. 01). One patient given danaparoid died of thrombosis compared with three patients given dextran 70. The platelet count returned to normal after a mean of 6. 7 days with danaparoid and 7. 3 days with dextran 70. There was no major bleeding with either treatment. Conclusion: danaparoid plus warfarin treatment for HIT with thrombosis is effective, safe, and superior to dextran 70 plus warfarin...|$|E
40|$|Heparin-induced {{thrombocytopenia}} (HIT) Management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) {{and treatment}} options have significantly changed recently. Heparin may induce {{two types of}} thrombocytopenia. Type I, occurring earlier with a much higher rate of incidence (5 - 30 %), is characterized by mild thrombocytopenia without significant clinical manifestations. Type II is less frequent (0. 5 - 2 %), life threatening immune type, develops following a period of minimum 5 - 7 days upon introduction of heparin therapy (patients earlier treated with heparin are excluded). Type II heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with severely reduced platelet count may be clinically manifested by thrombosis in 20 - 50 % cases within the period of 30 days. HIT is suspected in persons resistant to heparin with relatively reduced platelet count, though HIT is described in person with normal platelet counts, as well. None of available assays used for HIT detection is completely reliable Sensitivity of a highly specific platelet aggregation assay is only 36 % sensitivity and specificity of 14 C-serotonin release assays amounts to 95 % while ELISA using a heparin/platelet factor- 4 target has a sensitivity of 85 %. Thus, it is sometimes necessary to combine functional and antigen assays. Furthermore, new classes of antigen assays, like antibody detection tests of complexes between heparin and neutrophil-activating peptide- 2 {{as well as those}} between heparin and interleukin- 8, have been used. Current therapy options Current therapy options exclude formerly applied low-molecular-weight heparins due to the existing cross-reactivity of 80 – 100 %. <b>Danaparoid</b> <b>sodium</b> exhibits in vitro cross-reactivity of 10 – 61 %, clinically manifested in less than 5 % of patients. Two drugs are drugs of choice in HIT type II treatment: lepirudin, especially in patients without renal failure and argatroban, particularly in patients with renal failure. The following procedures and agents are also efficient: asmapheresis in the first four days, high-dose intravenous gammaglobulin, antiagregans, especially ADP antagonists, aspirin, dipirydamole, dextran, prostacyclin analogues thrombolytic therapy as well as thromboembolectomy. Oral anticoagulants are not administered in active HIT type II, in deep vein thrombosis with high international normalized ratio (INR) and thrombin-antithrombin complexes, and low protein C levels to avoid the possibility of venous limb gangrene development. They can be administered in a stable phase, when the thrombin generation is controlled by previous administration of one of the above-mentioned alternative anticoagulants...|$|E
