500|$|UPN {{requested}} a modified ending to the episode, {{as the original}} version had Phlox and Archer disagreeing {{over what to do}} with the Valakians. Archer would have wanted to save the race, while Phlox would have wanted evolution to take its course. John Billingsley, who played Doctor Phlox in Enterprise, didn't agree with the changed version, saying [...] "the ending that had initially been created I was fairly comfortable with. But the head of the studio suggested some revisions on the ending. What do you do? I wasn't as happy with the revisions, but it's not my show, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> of adjust, even if sometimes it does seem a bit of a contradiction in terms for what your character is supposed to be about." ...|$|E
2500|$|On November 26, 1998, Pioneer LDC {{released}} {{a video game}} with the same name as the anime for the PlayStation. It was designed by Konaka and Yasuyuki, and made to be a [...] "network simulator" [...] in which the player would navigate to explore Lain's story. The creators themselves did not call it a game, but [...] "Psycho-Stretch-Ware", {{and it has been}} described as being a kind of graphic novel: the gameplay is limited to unlocking pieces of information, and then reading/viewing/listening to them, with little or no puzzle needed to unlock. Lain distances itself even more from classical games by the random order in which information is collected. The aim of the authors was to let the player get the feeling that there are myriads of informations that they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> through, and {{that they would have to}} do with less than what exists to understand. As with the anime, the creative team's main goal was to let the player [...] "feel" [...] Lain, and [...] "to understand her problems, and to love her". A guidebook to the game called Serial Experiments Lain Official Guide (...) was released the same month by MediaWorks.|$|E

5000|$|However, many welfare-maximizing reallocations {{are often}} forgone {{because of the}} {{transaction}} costs involved in bargaining.

50|$|One {{extreme example}} is ZIP Code 85254; it was {{assigned}} the place name Scottsdale, Arizona {{because it is}} served by the Scottsdale post office, but 85% of its territory is inside the city limits of neighboring Phoenix.
