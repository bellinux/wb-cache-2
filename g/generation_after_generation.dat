25|$|Current {{research}} regarding EEC {{syndrome is}} focused on the genetic components contributing to the presented traits found in patients with EEC. A normal human karyotype includes 22 pairs of autosomal or non-sex chromosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes, constituting a total of 46 chromosomes. During reproduction, each parent contributes 23 chromosomes; 22 autosomal chromosomes and one sex chromosome. As stated above, EEC syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder. This means that there is an abnormal gene on one of the autosomal (non-sex) chromosomes from either parent. Because the gene is dominant, only one parent must contribute the abnormal gene for the child to inherit the disease and the contributing parent will usually have the disease, due to the expression of the dominant gene in the parent. Some characteristics of autosomal dominant inheritance patterns include a vertical transmission pattern, meaning that the disease phenotype is seen in <b>generation</b> <b>after</b> <b>generation.</b> Also, the recurrence risk is 50% and there are an equal number of affected males and females. Though we can calculate the chance of inheritance of the gene, the degree of expression cannot be calculated.|$|E
25|$|Oftentimes in {{the natural}} history of a species, large body size confers {{reproductive}} advantage. This raises the question in Hemipepsis ustulata: why do smaller wasps persist? <b>Generation</b> <b>after</b> <b>generation,</b> there is a wide size variation among these tarantula hawks. Wasps do not grow after metamorphosis, so smaller animals are at a permanent disadvantage competing against their larger fellows. John Alcock’s studies emphasize the importance of size variation in claiming desirable territories among male Hemipepsis ustulata wasps. It is hypothesized that female provisioning behavior {{may play a role in}} the maintenance of size variation in this species. In tarantula hawks, the size of the offspring is determined by the mother’s decision on how much to invest in each offspring. The size of the tarantula captured by the mother wasp is a function of how big the larva will become when fully grown. The subduing of a larger tarantula requires a greater energy investment and poses a greater risk to the mother wasp. If the offspring is a large male, it would have to be twice as fit as a smaller male offspring in order to repay the investment of the mother wasp. Thus, in some cases, it may be advantageous for the mother wasp to produce many small male offspring. This would enable them to enjoy the same level of fitness as a female, but with fewer, larger progeny.|$|E

Compared to land animals, domestication of fish species has started recently. This implies that most farmed marine fish species have only changed slightly from their wild counterparts, and production is based partly or completely on wild inputs. In the past decades, global marine fish production has increased tremendously, particularly since the 1990 s, to reach more than 2. 2 million tons in 2013. Among the 100 marine fish species listed in the FAO’s database in 2013, 35 are no longer produced, and only six have a production higher than 100, 000 tons. The top ten farmed marine species accounted for nearly 90 % of global production. The future growth and sustainability of mariculture will depend partly on our ability to domesticate (i. e., control the life cycle in captivity) of both currently farmed and new species...|$|R
