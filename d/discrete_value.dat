40|$|AbstractIn {{real-time}} data mining applications <b>discrete</b> <b>values</b> play {{vital role in}} knowledge representation as {{they are easy to}} handle and very close to knowledge level representation than continuous attributes. Discretization is a major step in data mining process where continuous attributes are transformed into <b>discrete</b> <b>values.</b> However, most of the classifications algorithms are require <b>discrete</b> <b>values</b> as the input. Even though some data mining algorithms directly contract with continuous attributes, the learning process yields low quality results. In this paper, we introduce a new discretization method based on standard deviation technique called ‘z-score’ for continuous attributes on biomedical datasets. We compare performance of the proposed algorithm with the state-of- the-art discretization techniques. The experiment results show the efficiency in terms of accuracy and also minimize the classifier confusion for decision making process...|$|R
