25|$|In 200 CE, emperor Septimius Severus {{elevated}} {{the town to}} the status of a city, calling it Colonia Lucia Septimia Severa Diospolis. The name Diospolis ("City of Zeus") may have been bestowed earlier, possibly by Hadrian. At that point, most of its inhabitants were Christian. The earliest known bishop is Aëtius, a friend of Arius. In December 415, the Council of Diospolis was held <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> Pelagius; he was acquitted. In the sixth century, the city was renamed Georgiopolis after St. George, a soldier in the guard of the emperor Diocletian, who was born there between 256 and 285 CE. The Church of St. George is named for him.|$|E

He appears {{to be aware of}} the perception, making no apologies for it stating that he is [...] "not <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to please people. I'm here to do my best" [...] and, in a post-race interview after winning the 2012 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, [...] "Last time you guys was [...] giving me shit because I didn't really smile enough [...] ". Apart from his on-track driving, off-track instances demonstrating this calm demeanour include being asleep 30 minutes before his first Formula One race and eating an ice cream during the temporarily-suspended 2009 Malaysian Grand Prix.|$|E

6000|$|... "Silence!" [...] he said. [...] "We are {{assembled}} <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> the Englishman, Silas Croft, by court-martial. The {{charges against}} him are that by word and deed, notably by continuing to fly the British flag after the country had been surrendered to the Republic, he has traitorously rebelled against the Government of this country. Further, that he has attempted to murder a burgher of the Republic by shooting {{at him with a}} loaded rifle. If these charges are proved against him he will be liable to death, by martial law. Prisoner Croft, what do you answer to the charges against you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{has come}} here to seek that {{beautiful}} stranger I have been hunting for," [...] thought Lightfoot. [...] "He has come <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to steal her away from me.

60|$|And {{then she}} began to wonder {{what they had to}} say, and, gradually, the {{conviction}} grew upon her that Mr Croft was a very, very honorable man. Of course it was wrong that he should have come <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to win a lady who, if one looked at it in the proper light, really belonged to another. But it now came into her mind that Mr Croft must, by degrees, have seen this, for himself, and that it was the subject of his long conference with Junius, and also, most probably, of this letter. The conference certainly ended amicably, and, in that case, it was scarcely possible that Junius had given up his claim. He was not that kind of a man.|$|E
