In this article, two practical cases are described: (1) a program for optimizing administrative and logistic processes for the export chain of agricultural goods from the Netherlands to non-EU-countries and (2) a program for optimizing the chain of soil-monitoring for potato <b>eelworm</b> <b>disease.</b> These cases show examples of the way chain-collaboration is established in practice and governance and financial issues that arise. In the conclusion, based on the cases, we present several guidelines that might help to avoid/overcome the governance and financial issues in a chain-optimization project or program.

"The <b>eelworm</b> <b>disease</b> of wheat, {{long known}} in Europe, {{has been found}} {{during the past year}} causing {{considerable}} damage in Virginia and in isolated localities in West Virginia, Maryland, Georgia, and California.

The disease may be recognized on young and old plants and in the thrashed wheat by the descriptions given in this bulletin. The trouble may be controlled by use of clean seed, by crop rotation, and by sanitation. If clean seed cannot be procured from uninfested localities, diseased seed can be made safe for planting by the salt-brine treatment here described. " [...] p. ...|$|E
