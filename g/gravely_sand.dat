The wind farm would be located at water depths of 16 to 22 m and consist of somewhere between 45 and 108 turbines. Benefits of the site included low shipping and trawling intensities; lack of any dredging, dumping, oil/gas, or MoD practice areas, and of cables or pipelines; as well as low visual impact from the coast, and outside any nature conservation areas. The seabed at the windfarm and offshore cable route consisted of mainly <b>gravely</b> <b>sand,</b> overlying chalk. The electrical power export cable was to be connected to a switching station near Muckleburgh Collection, via landfall near Weybourne Hope. Two routes were considered for the export cable, one avoiding the sand bank atSheringham shoal. The connection to the National Grid was planned to be made at an electrical substation near Salle, Norfolk via a 132kV 21.3 km underground cable.|$|E

A southern Arizona USA greenhouse experiment evaluated the impact of rainfall, common amendments, and three soil types on grassland revegetation. Based on rainfall data from a nearby semi-arid site, three irrigation levels were used to simulate the rainfall of a dry (275 mm), average (320 mm), and wet (555 mm) year. The three amendments were bare soil, straw (4. 5 Mg/ha with a tackifier), and straw plus slow-release fertilizer (7 – 2 – 3 NPK, 3. 4 Mg/ha). Three field-collected soil types were used: a very <b>gravely</b> <b>sand,</b> a very gravelly loamy sand, and a gravelly sandy loam. Four seed mixes were used as a blocking factor. There was a significant interaction between amendment and soil type, soil type and rainfall scenario, as well as amendment and rainfall scenario. Straw alone or with fertilizer increased aboveground biomass (72 – 177 % increase) on the gravelly sandy loam, and very gravelly loamy sand soils but decreased biomass on the very <b>gravely</b> <b>sand</b> (13 % and 54 %). Straw with fertilizer did not change species richness and diversity significantly, but it resulted in a greater than 50 % decline in establishment for all soil types. Straw alone significantly increased the aboveground biomass only in low (205 %) and average rainfall scenarios (40 %), but not when rainfall was high (11 %).

To calibrate a hypoplastic model for granular materials a large number of laboratory tests was needed and a part of the testing constitutes the present thesis. The hypoplastic model by von Wolffersdorff (1996) has eight materials parameters. The critical state fiction angle φc', which was obtained directly by the measurement of the angle of repose, is one of the eight parameters. Other parameters are determined form the results of experiments and empirically. Aim of this thesis was to carry out field and laboratory tests, to determine selected soil properties and to interpret them with regard to the variability of the soil in the selected face of the sand pit. The material for investigation comes from the south part of the Cretaceous Třeboň Basin in the South Bohemia from the Kolný sand pit. The pit is located in the upper part of the Klikov layers.

In the present study, a series of conventional triaxial compression tests were conducted on a cemented poorly graded sand–gravel mixture containing 30 % gravel and 70 % sand in both consolidated drained and undrained conditions.

Comparison of the results with other studies on well graded <b>gravely</b> <b>sands</b> indicated more dilation or negative pore pressure in poorly graded samples. Undrained failure envelopes determined using zero Skempton's pore pressure coefficient (A¯= 0) criterion were consistent with the drained ones.

40|$|By {{means of}} 11 new echographic lines and 100 surface {{sediment}} samples {{it has been}} possible to individualize on the continental shelf of Cagliari Gulf several depositional facies associations between foreshore and shelf edge. These associations document a suite of peculiar environments that diversified and stabilized during the Holocene eustatic rise. From shore to shelfbreak we first encounter a shoreface, gently sloped and distally sea-grass covered which ends in a trough parallel to the coast. Toward the open shelf is a relief, topping at - 12 - 15 meters, site of the Posidonia oceanica main bank, followed by a wide foreslope. At a depth of 30 m the vegetation becomes rare, and starting from - 35 - 40 m a large belt of sand waves appears. At the depth of 50 m a flat bottom prevails, followed by submerged shoreline relieves at - 55 m. Externally to such structures a narrow outer shelf occurs and the shelf edge is observed {{at a depth of}} 115 - 125 m. The inner shelf trough can be interpreted as a paleo-river valley during the MIS 4 - 2 and previous lowstands, combined with terrigenous inputs insufficient to fill the accommodation space produced by the Holocene sea-level rise. Towards the middle shelf the trough is bounded by paleo-reliefs where the Posidonia oceanica bank at present overgrows, weakly aggrading and prograding landward and seaward. Compositional and grain-size analysis of samples allowed us to identify eight depositional facies related to present day environments. Shoreface sediments are represented by terrigenous coarse to medium sands in the eastern sector of the gulf, and mixed terrigenous-bioclastic medium to fine sands on the western sector. Two distinct groups of lithic facies are present near Cape S. Elia and near Zavorra Point, due to sediment dispersion from the limestone and andesite outcrops along the cliffed coast. The western inner-shelf trough is characterized by mixed quartzose-bioclastic sandy muds with bivalves and peloidal grains. Mixed facies of biogenic production and relict terrigenous sediments are present on the Posidonia bank, while through the sand wave belt a transition is observed to bioclastic, poorly sorted <b>gravely</b> <b>sands</b> with red algae and foraminifers. Rare breakthroughs of mixed sediments are present in proximity of the - 55 m paleo-shores. Starting from depths of 75 m, sediments are represented by fine bioclastic-quartzose sands with bivalves and foraminifers. The depositional facies described document this sedimentation as of a mid-latitude mixed carbonate-terrigenous shelf. The present day sedimentation is highly siliciclastic in the inner shelf from fluvial-continental feeding, and bioclastic {{in the rest of the}} shelf with a maximum productivity along the middle-shelf Posidonia bank and its foreslope. In the middle and outer shelf the siliciclastic component is related to previous eustatic phases. The sequential analysis of 3. 5 kHz lines show the Holocenic trasgressive systems tract blanking over a maximum flooding surface, or over a trasgressive ravinement surface or lowstand erosional truncations. The Holocenic TST, except for the siliciclastic shoreface, is mostly carbonatic, owing to the highstand-related terrigenous starvation and to a good bioclastic productivity of molluscs, red algae, briozoans, foraminifers and echinoids. Analogous depositional contexts should be attributed to the preceding highstand phases of the Middle-Upper Pleistocene. Otherwise, during glacio-eustatic phases of falling, lowstand and rising sea-level, the shelf has been mostly interested by terrigenous continental or shoreface deposits that are currently resedimented in the middle and outer shelf. In summary, the depositional model of this shelf is characterised by alternated phases of carbonate-terrigenous mid-latitude sedimentation with poorly rainy, warm Mediterranean climate during highstand conditions, and terrigenous phases during lowstands with rainy, cold Mediterranean climate...|$|R

The aim of this study was to investigate the hydrogeological condition at the area under investigation. Three geoelectric sections are prepared; each of them is composed of four units. The first layer has resistivity ranging from 58 to 2029  ohm. m and thicknesses from 0. 46 to 10. 7  m characterizing a <b>gravely</b> <b>sand</b> facies of Quaternary age (Pleistocene to Holocene).

40|$|The {{sedimentary}} {{response of}} deep shelf sediments to {{the interplay of}} tides and waves, based on {{the example of the}} Celtic Sea sand banks is described. Grab samples and 1500 km of multibeam and side scan data have been collected from the 300 km 2 densely surveyed Kaiser bank area. The bank is 140 – 170 m deep, 30 m high and 60 km long, oriented perpendicular to the shelf edge and nearly parallel to the major axis of the tidal ellipse. Surficial sediments of the bank consist of medium to <b>gravely</b> biolithoclastic <b>sands.</b> They are swept by tidal currents that reach 0. 9 m/s 1 m above the seabed, and under the occasional influence of waves. The mobile sands are commonly bedformed and rest on a highly backscattering lag. The flanks below − 140 m mainly exhibit transverse tidal dunes and sand ribbons, whereas the top of the bank mostly displays discontinuous sand patches and wave ripples. The sand patches are interpreted as the remnants of tidal bedforms reworked by waves. Calculations of the threshold of motion of four modal grain sizes under various conditions at the seabed show that tidal bedforms are active during spring tides sometimes associated with waves, whereas only the largest annual waves may explain the observed wave ripples. As in active tidal banks, there is a reversal of tidal bedload transport from one bank side to the other. The sedimentation rate is very low on the Kaiser bank. In addition, there is a loss of sediment at both bank extremities and the tidal bedload cross-bank transfer is very small, probably controlled by shelf residual currents and long-term drift of sediment resuspended by waves. However, the present-day action of waves at the bank top is less intense than it was at lower sea levels during the Holocene, as evidenced by seismic studies...|$|R
40|$|Sedimentological and oceanographic {{characteristics}} in the Gulf of Corinth are examined, to define modern sedimentation processes over its central part; {{this is a}} restricted deep water body (depths > 900 m), with a sill depth of 65 m. CTD data collected in May 1983 indicate {{the presence of a}} thermocline layer (0 – 60 m) associated with a rapid temperature decrease. This layer is separated from an almost uniform bottom water mass (> 100 m) by a transitional zone (60 – 100 m), in which temperature decreases gradually with depth. The salinity remains almost constant (38. 5 ± 0. 1 psu) throughout the whole of the water column. Dissolved oxygen levels vary from 1. 9 to 2. 6 ml/l; in water depths > 600 m, these indicate the absence of anoxic conditions. Near-bed currents are < 8 cm/s, which are not capable of resuspending bottom sediments. These currents relate to atmospheric pressure changes. The modern sedimentary cover of the Gulf is mainly terrigenous in origin. Generally, coarser-grained (<b>gravely</b> muddy <b>sand)</b> material is present along the narrow and steep southern continental shelf and slope. Mud deposits dominate the deeper parts of the Gulf, whilst a bauxitic red-mud slurry (discharged by an aluminium processing factory) is accumulating over the gently-sloping northern shelf (Antikyra Bay). Some of this artificially-induced fine-grained material reaches the abyssal plain, up to 18 km from its depocentre. Depositional processes are dominated by gravity-driven mass flows (i. e. turbidites, debris flows, and slides), for which the main triggering mechanism appears to be earthquake activity. In some cases, slope steeping through structural control and flood events associated with high sediment inputs (from ephemeral rivers and streams) contribute to the process...|$|R
40|$|Echographic and sedimentological {{investigations}} were undertaken on {{the shelf}} of Cagliari {{with the purpose of}} underlining the relationships between modern terrigenous and bioclastic sediments and the behaviour of the sedimentary system during the Holocene eustatic rising. The Gulf of Cagliari is a sub-tropical, semi-arid Mediterranean area located {{in the southern part of}} the NW striking Oligo- Miocene Sardinian Rift, within which the Pliocene Campidano Graben is superimposed. The Quaternary continental shelf developed transversally to this tectonic trough, being fed by terrigenous sediments derived from the Palaeozoic metamorphic basement and from Tertiary sedimentary and volcanic rocks. The new echographic survey, consisting of 11 lines performed transversally from the coast to the shelfbreak, integrated previously available data and allowed us to divide the shelf into different sedimentary environments. From shore to shelfbreak we first encounter a shoreface, gently sloped and distally seagrass-covered (close to the fair-weather wave base), which ends in a wide trough parallel to the coast. Toward the open shelf is a relief, site of the Posidonia oceanica main bank, reaching a minimum depth of 13 meters under the sea level, followed by its external slope. At a depth of about 30 meters the vegetation becomes rare, as less luminosity limits the growth of Posidonia, and starting from depths of 35 ÷ 40 meters a large belt of sand waves appears, with gradually decreasing heigths and increasing frequencies basinward. At the depth of 50 m a flat bottom prevails, followed by several reliefs stretching roughly NE–SW at 55 m depth, interpreted as submerged shore lines. Externally to such structures a narrow outer shelf occurs and the shelf break is observed at a depth of 115 ÷ 125 m. Sampling sites were located along the echographic lines and on the foreshore; 98 samples were taken with a 2 dm_ grab-sampler. Compositional and grain size analysis allowed us to identify 8 groups of facies related to present day depositional environments. Shoreface sediments are represented by almost completely terrigenous coarse to medium sands in the eastern sector, and finer mixed terrigenous-bioclastic sands on the S. Gilla shoreface. Two distinct groups of lithic facies are present near Capo S. Elia and near P. ta Zavorra, due to sediment dispersal from the limestone and andesite outcrops along the cliffed coast. The western inner-shelf depression is characterized by mixed quartzose-bioclastic sandy muds with bivalves. Mixed facies of relict terrigenous sediments and present day biogenic production (mollusks, bryozoans, red algae, echinoids and foraminifers) are on the Posidonia oceanica bank’s fore slope, where the siliciclastic component is found between - 30 and - 50 meters with decreasing importance seaward. Through the sand-wave belt a transition is observed to bioclastic, poorly sorted <b>gravely</b> <b>sands</b> of red algae and foraminifers. Here the sediment is completely bioclastic with rare breakthroughs of mixed sediments in proximity to the – 55 m paleo-shores. From a depth of 75 meters, sediments are represented by fine bioclastic-quartzose sands with bivalves and foraminifers. A peculiar feature of this shelf is the depression in the inner shelf that can be interpreted as the product of paleo-river erosions produced during the “Würmian” low stand (MIS 4 - 2), associated with terrigenous inputs insufficient to fill up the available space during the post-glacial sea level rise. Towards the middle shelf the trough is bounded by paleo-reliefs where the Posidonia bank at present overgrows, weakly aggrading and prograding. The depositional facies described document the present day sedimentary system as of a temperate water mixed terrigenous-carbonate shelf. The sedimentation is highly siliciclastic in the inner shelf from fluvial-continental feeding, and bioclastic in the rest of the shelf with a maximum productivity along the intermediate shelf’s Posidonia bank and its foreslope. In the middle and outer shelf the siliciclastic component is related to previous eustatic phases and attributable to continental and nearshore deposits lying underneath the middle-shelf Posidonia bank. Analogous depositional contexts must be attributed to the preceding high stand phases of the Middle-Upper Pleistocene. Otherwise, during glacio-eustatic phases of falling, low-stand and rising sea level, the shelf has been affected by terrigenous continental sedimentation or shoreface sequences that are currently resedimented in the middle and outer shelf. In summary, the depositional model of this shelf is characterised by alternating phases of terrigenous-carbonate sedimentation of middle latitude, with a poorly rainy, warm Mediterranean climate during highstanding sea-level conditions, and terrigenous phases during low stands with rather rainy, cooler Mediterranean climate...|$|R
40|$|Genesis, {{classification}} {{and agricultural}} potentials of the soils derived from Kerrikerri sandstone formation in Bauchi State, Nigeria were investigated. Field and laboratory observations with the soils from five pedons, one each at crest, lower slope and valley floor, and two from middle slope positions, revealed {{that they were}} deep (> 150 cm), brown (7. 5 YR 5 / 3) to very pale brown (10 YR 7 / 3) and sandy loam to sandy clay loam in the upper horizon underlain by yellowish red (5 RY 4 / 8) to brownish yellow (10 YR 6 / 8) and <b>gravely</b> <b>sand</b> clay to clay horizons, with moderately well-developed sub-angular blocky structure and friable to very friable consistence. The soils were strongly to moderately acidic (pH. 5. 1 - 5. 9 in H 2 O, 3. 8 - 5. 3 in CaCl 2), low in exchangeable bases (1. 04 – 1. 40 cmol (+) kg- 1 as well as exchange acidity (0. 54 - 1. 90 cmol (+) kg – 1) with cation exchange capacity ranging between 4. 4 and 27. 6 cmol (+) kg- 1 soil. The dominant pedogenic processes influencing the rate of soil development {{were found to be}} clay lessivation, colluvial-fluvial deposition and neoformation of minerals in the lower horizons as a result of downward leaching of the bases and likely better moisture condition at depth. The soils were classified according to the USDA Soil Taxonomy System (2003) /FAO-UNESCO Soil Map of the World Legend (1988) as Pedon 1 (Crest) : Aquic Haplustult fine loamy, isomesic/Gleyic Acrisol, Pedons 2, 3 and 4 (Middle slopes 1 and 2 as well as Lower slope) : Orthic Paleustults fine loamy kaolinitic, isohyperthermic/Orthic Acrisol, and Pedon 5 (Valley floor) : Aquic Plinthic Haplustaults clayey, isohyperthermic/ Plinthic Acrisol...|$|E
40|$|Livingston Island, {{located at}} the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, is characterised by an oceanic polar climate with {{temperatures}} above 0 °C during the austral summer and a mean annual precipitation between 400 and 500 mm. Under these conditions a soil formation can be observed and lichens, mosses and some higher plants are able to grow in this environment. With cultivation-independent methods, it is possible to analyse complex microbial networks in the face of diversity, abundance, ecology and their reaction on climate change. Here, we investigated the bacterial community structure of different habitats located on Livingston Island by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) to get a first insight in the diversity of bacteria existing under these conditions. The aim of these studies is to identify the main microbial players in nutrient turnover within periglacial ecosystems of Antarctica. One transect and four separate profiles were sampled near the Bulgarian station St. Kliment Ohridski (62 ° 38 `S/ 60 ° 21 `W). Two soil profiles were characterised by permafrost. The investigated mineral soils showed mostly <b>gravely</b> <b>sand</b> texture. Moisture content of the soils ranged from 2. 6 % up to 15. 6 % and was partly quite variable within the different profiles. The values of total carbon and nitrogen were extremely low with < 0. 10 to 0. 46 % and < 0. 10 %, respectively, except for the upper layers of the profiles T 1 - 1 and T 1 - 4 that were covered by mosses. PLFA concentration decreased with increasing depth, which correlates well with the TC values. DGGE patterns from amplification of DNA showed large varieties in the vertical profiles and between the different sites. Most sequences recovered from Antarctic soil profiles belong to the Bacteriodetes and to the Acidobacteria phylum. DGGE pictures showed a high diversity in most of the samples. The main influence on heterotrophic microbial growth and activity in low-nutrient habitats is probably the availability of organic compounds. Water can also be a limiting factor, but microorganisms seem to be well adapted to these conditions as it can be derived from the DGGE pattern. It is conceivable that the ways of C and N cycling in cold Antarctic habitats are short and that cold-adapted microorganisms might play a major role for the ecosystem development. To compare arctic and antarctic microbial communities phylogenetic investigations will be done using clone libraries for both Bacteria and Archaea...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of incised valleys on continental shelves is generally attributed to fluvial erosion under low sea level conditions. However, there are exceptions. A multibeam sonar survey {{at the northern}} end of Australia's Great Barrier Reef, adjacent to the southern edge of the Gulf of Papua, mapped a shelf valley system up to 220 m deep that extends for more than 90 km across the continental shelf. This is the deepest shelf valley yet found in the Great Barrier Reef and is well below the maximum depth of fluvial incision that could have occurred under a − 120 m, eustatic sea level low-stand, as what occurred on this margin during the last ice age. These valleys appear to have formed by a combination of reef growth and tidal current scour, probably in relation to a sea level at around 30 – 50 m below its present position. Tidally incised depressions in the valley floor exhibit closed bathymetric contours at both ends. Valley floor sediments are mainly calcareous muddy, gravelly sand on the middle shelf, giving way to well-sorted, <b>gravely</b> <b>sand</b> containing a large relict fraction on the outer shelf. The valley extends between broad platform reefs and framework coral growth, which accumulated through the late Quaternary, coincides with tidal current scour to produce steep-sided (locally vertical) valley walls. The deepest segments of the valley were probably the sites of lakes during the last ice age, when Torres Strait formed an emergent land-bridge between Australia and Papua New Guinea. Numerical modeling predicts that the strongest tidal currents occur over the deepest, outer-shelf segment of the valley when sea level is about 40 – 50 m below its present position. These results are consistent with a Pleistocene age and relict origin of the valley. Based on these observations, we propose a new conceptual model for the {{formation of}} tidally incised shelf valleys. Tidal erosion on meso- to macro-tidal, rimmed carbonate shelves is enhanced during sea level rise and fall when a tidal, hydraulic pressure gradient is established between the shelf-lagoon and the adjacent ocean basin. Tidal flows attain a maximum, and channel incision is greatest, when a large hydraulic pressure gradient coincides with small channel cross sections. Our tidal-incision model may explain the observation of other workers, that sediment is exported from the Great Barrier Reef shelf to the adjacent ocean basins during intermediate (rather than last glacial maximum) low-stand, sea level positions. The model may apply to other rimmed shelves, both modern and ancient...|$|E
40|$|An {{acoustic}} and sedimentological {{survey was}} performed on the shelf of Cagliari, Southern Sardinia, to describe morphology, modern sediments and depositional processes of the shelf from the last post glacial sea level rise. The Gulf of Cagliari is a sub-tropical, semi-arid Mediterranean area located {{in the southern part of}} the NW striking Oligo-Miocene Sardinian Rift, over which the Pliocenic Campidano Graben is superimposed. The Quaternary continental shelf developed transversally to this tectonic trough, fed by terrigenous sediments derived from the Palaeozoic metamorphic basement and from Tertiary sedimentary and volcanic rocks. The paleo-morphology influenced the depositional processes and the modern configuration of depositional environments. The shelf is at present characterized by a structural relief in the intermediate shelf, overgrown by a bioclastic bank that shelters the inner sector and can be considered similar in function to a tropical carbonate barrier. The echographic survey, consisting of 20 lines performed transversally to the coast, integrated previous acoustic and seismic data (lines and mosaic SSS, lines SBP and Sparker) and allowed, together with sedimentary data, to identify several morphological/sedimentological features. From the shore to the shelfbreak a suite of environments was detected, each characterized by distinct sedimentation and processes. The shoreface, weakly sloped and distally seagrass-covered, that ends in a wide depression (10 x 2 Km) roughly parallel to the coast. A relief in the middle shelf, overgrown by the Posidonia oceanica main bank, reaching a minimum depth of 13 meters under the sea level. A middle shelf slope (depth > 30 m) where a transition is observed to bare bottoms, (light limit for the growth of Posidonia). A large sand wave belt, from depths of 35 ÷ 40 meters, with gradually decreasing heigths and increasing frequencies seaward. Flat bottoms at the depth of 55 m, for the reaching of the Storm Wave Base (SWB) and vanishing of the structures. Several reliefs, stretching roughly NE–SW at 55 m depth, interpreted as submerged paleo-shorelines. Finally, a narrow outer-shelf, externally to these structures, and the shelfbrake at a depth of 115 ÷ 125 m. Sampling sites were positioned to the aid of the echographic dataset and 201 samples were taken with a 5 dm³ grab-sampler. Compositional and grain size analysis allowed to identify 9 groups of facies related to present day depositional environments. Shoreface sediments are represented by almost completely terrigenous, coarse to medium sands in the eastern sector, and finer mixed terrigenous-bioclastic sands on the western shoreface (see figure). Two groups of lithic facies are present near distinct outcrops of limestone and andesite along the cliffed coast. The inner-shelf below the fair-weather wave base is characterized by mixed quartzose-bioclastic sandy muds with bivalves while the depression is filled by a 40 m thick Holocenic sequence of organic-carbonate mud and fine sands (grey on the map). Mixed facies of relict shoreface terrigenous sediments along with a present-day biogenic component (mollusks, bryozoans, red algae, echinoids and foraminifers) are found in the Posidonia oceanica bank (- 15 ÷ 35 m). Seaward, a coarser, different siliciclastic component is found between - 35 and - 50 meters, related to depositional processes precedent to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Through the sand-wave belt a transition is observed to more bioclastic, poorly sorted <b>gravely</b> <b>sands</b> of red algae and benthic foraminifera, below the SWB. The sediment is completely bioclastic but rare breakthroughs of terrigenous material in proximity to the – 55 m paleo-shores show the presence of relict sediments underneath a limited surface cover. From a depth of 75 meters fine bioclastic-quartzose sands with bivalves and foraminifers are present due to and open marine reduced sedimentation during the last phases of the post-LGM sea level rise. The interpretation of these morphological and sedimentological context was based on the present-day knowledge of Pleistocene sea-level fluctuations. High-amplitude variations controlled by 20 Ky precession cycles are known to have taken place in the Glacial Pleistocene (800 Ky), while smaller amplitude 40 Ky obliquity cycles variations were dominant during the Lower and Middle Pleistocene. During this early time the actual inner shelf was probably mostly emerged and continental processes prevailed while the sea level oscillated around a mean value of - 60 m ca. (external paleo-shores). Only during the Middle-Late Pleistocene were the oscillations wide enough to submerge the inner shelf during highstands. An important feature attributable to these continental processes is the inner shelf depression, that can be interpreted as the product of paleo-river erosions, lastly reactivated during the “Würmian” lowstand (MIS 4 - 2). The terrigenous input was then insufficient to fill up the available space during the post-glacial sea-level rise. The middle-shelf paleo-relief (under the Posidonia bank) is interpreted as the result of the highstands most often reached during the obliquity dominant transgressive cycles of the Lower Pleistocene. The climatic-geomorphologic context determines the present day sedimentation, that is of a temperate water, mixed terrigenous-carbonate shelf. The sedimentation is highly siliciclastic in the inner shelf from fluvial-continental feeding, and bioclastic in the rest of the shelf with a maximum productivity along the Posidonia bank and its foreslope. A second important productivity is present at greater depths (50 - 65 m) with the rhodalgal biocenosys. In the middle and outer shelf the relict siliciclastic component is related to previous eustatic phases and attributable to continental and nearshore deposits lying underneath the actual shelf’s buildup. Analogous depositional contexts must be attributed to the precedent highstand phases of the Middle-Upper Pleistocene. Otherwise, during glacio-eustatic phases of falling, lowstand and rising sea level, the shelf was characterized by terrigenous continental sedimentation or shoreface sequences that are currently resedimented in the middle and outer shelf. Finally, the depositional model of this shelf alternates between phases of terrigenous-carbonate sedimentation of middle latitude, with a poorly rainy, warm Mediterranean climate during highstands, and terrigenous phases during lowstands with rather rainy, cooler Mediterranean climate. ...|$|R
