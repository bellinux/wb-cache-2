5|$|Arrowmen are {{identified}} {{by a white}} sash bearing a red arrow that is worn over their right shoulder. An Ordeal member wears a sash with a lone arrow. The Brotherhood member wears a sash bearing an arrow with a red bar at <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the arrow. A Vigil Honor member wears a sash with the same bars of as the Brotherhood sash at <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the arrow, and a Vigil Honor triangle {{on the center of}} the shaft. Members wear the sash at Order of the Arrow functions and special Scouting activities when members need to be identified as Arrowmen rendering special services. The OA sash is not worn {{at the same time as}} the merit badge sash, nor worn folded in the belt. The sash as a form of recognition dates to the founding of the Order and has a long history of changes in usage and design.|$|E
5|$|Because of the hilly terrain, {{the station}} was built in a deep cutting {{excavated}} from Highgate Hill adjacent to Archway Road. Tunnels penetrated the hillside at <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the station, leading towards East Finchley {{to the north and}} Crouch End to the south. When built, the station had two side platforms, with three tracks between them, and a station building on the south side. A footbridge linked the two platforms.|$|E

5|$|Greathead had {{originally}} {{planned for the}} trains to be hauled {{by a pair of}} small electric locomotives, one at <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a train, but the Board of Trade rejected this proposal and a larger locomotive was designed which was able to pull up to seven carriages on its own. Twenty-eight locomotives were manufactured in America by the General Electric Company (of which syndicate member Darius Ogden Mills was a director) and assembled in the Wood Lane depot. A fleet of 168 carriages was manufactured by the Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Company and the Brush Electrical Engineering Company. Passengers boarded and left the trains through folding lattice gates at <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the carriages; these gates were operated by guards who rode on an outside platform. The CLR {{had originally}} intended to have two classes of travel, but dropped the plan before opening, although its carriages were built with different qualities of interior fittings for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, roundabouts were {{constructed}} at <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> The Causeway, {{to improve the}} flow of traffic on the bridges {{and the distribution of}} traffic back into the road network. The roundabout at the eastern end, connecting with Great Eastern Highway, opened in 1952. In 1973 construction began on upgrading that intersection to a grade-separated partial cloverleaf interchange. The interchange opened on 8 March 1974, having cost AUS$1.3 million.|$|E
5|$|Irwin {{developed}} and patented a football scoreboard, {{which was in}} use in the Ivy League by the 1890s. The large scoreboard featured a miniature representation of a football field, and the ball moved along the board to report each play. By 1915, Irwin's scoreboards were featured at <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> {{the field for the}} Army-Navy game at the Polo Grounds.|$|E

25|$|The Jelapang and Ipoh South toll plazas were {{demolished}} in 2009 {{to make a}} non-stop route across Ipoh. This {{is achieved}} {{through the construction of}} two local-express lanes for each side, which are only accessible via Exit 138 Ipoh South Exit (for northbound traffic) and Exit 141 Ipoh North Exit (for southbound traffic). The toll plazas in Ipoh are therefore relocated at <b>each</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the local-express lanes.|$|R
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{additions}} to the DRR occurred in March 1956 when new covered shelters were built on <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Frontierland Station's depot building. The shelters were added after the DRR's track on {{the western edge of}} its route, and the depot building standing next to it, were moved outwards.|$|E
5|$|The Alban Goldsmith House was {{constructed}} sometime prior to 1820. The story-and-a-half brick edifice is laid in common bond with a Flemish bond facade on the front. Three gabled windows {{were added to}} the facade many years after its construction. Interior chimneys with corbels on top adorn <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the house. It faces west onto Second Street, away from Constitution Square, and opposite the Ephraim McDowell House across the street.|$|E
5|$|There {{are flat}} {{junctions}} at <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the station: Herne Hill North Junction, where the lines to Loughborough Junction and Brixton diverge; and Herne Hill South Junction, where the lines to West Dulwich and Tulse Hill diverge. Thameslink and Southeastern services cross each other's paths at the junctions, constraining capacity on both routes. The station {{also has a}} turnback siding on its eastern side, adjacent to Milkwood Road.|$|E

5|$|Unusually for a Thames bridge, {{only three}} of Chiswick Bridge's five spans cross the river; the shorter spans at <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the bridge cross the former towpaths. To allow {{sufficient}} clearance for shipping without steep inclines, the approach roads to the bridge are elevated from some distance back from the river.|$|E
5|$|A change {{occurred}} {{in the game and}} the role of the goalkeeper in the 1880s, when the Scottish reduced the size of the scoring area by placing rugby posts, spaced about 10 feet apart, at <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the pool. At the same time, the rules were changed to allow goalkeepers to stand on the pool deck and leap onto the head of an opposing player who approached the goal. This change in the rules was brief. To prevent the serious injuries that resulted from this method of goalkeeping, the rules were revised again to require the goalie to remain in the water.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the large}} pendentives {{that support the}} vault are windows, six {{on each side of}} the chapel. There were two more windows in <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the chapel, now closed, and those above the High Altar covered by the Last Judgement. Above each window is an arched shape, {{referred}} to as a lunette and above eight of the lunettes at the sides of the chapel are triangular spandrels filling the spaces between the side pendentives and the vault, the other eight lunettes each being below one of the corner pendentives.|$|E

5|$|By 9:00am it was {{apparent}} that the two gunmen possessed superior weapons and ample ammunition. The police officers in charge on the scene, Superintendent Mulvaney and Chief Superintendent Stark, contacted Assistant Commissioner Major Frederick Wodehouse at Scotland Yard. He telephoned the Home Office and obtained permission from Churchill to bring in a detachment of Scots Guards, who were stationed at the Tower of London. It {{was the first time that}} the police had requested military assistance in London to deal with an armed siege. Twenty-one volunteer marksmen from the Guards arrived at about 10:00am and took firing positions at <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the street and in the houses opposite. The shooting continued without either side gaining any advantage.|$|E
5|$|Each train {{consists}} of six cars, {{from front to}} back: IM, CM, TTC, TT, CM and IM. The IM class carriages at <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the train are powered and fitted with a driver's compartment. The CM class is a powered passenger car. Class TTC is unpowered, it {{is equipped with a}} pantograph and a restaurant. The TT class is an unpowered passenger car which has also a pantograph on its roof. Each of the powered carriages is fitted with one motor on each of the two bogies. If needed, two trains can be coupled together.|$|E
5|$|Election {{days for}} the Bundestag and the European Parliament are also flag days in some states, in {{addition}} to other state-specific flag days. The public display of flags to mark other events, such as the election of the president or the death of a prominent politician (whereupon flags would be at half-staff), can be declared at the discretion of the Federal Ministry of the Interior. When flags are required to be flown at half-staff, vertical flags are not lowered. A black mourning ribbon is instead attached, either atop the staff (if hung from a pole) or to <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the flag's supporting cross-beams (if flown like a banner).|$|E

5|$|Except for its two stations—one at <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the tunnel—the line ran entirely underground. The {{line was}} built {{in less than three}} months, and on its {{completion}} in 1936 was one of the shortest independent railway lines in the country. It was open for only three years before being converted to a major air-raid shelter during World War II. After the war's end, it {{was not included in the}} 1948 nationalisation of British railways but remained in private hands.|$|E
5|$|Following the 15th century Reformation when {{clerical}} {{marriage was}} permitted, larger households {{would have been}} required {{and as a result}} some of the houses were altered and combined by knocking through walls, into larger dwellings. Others had extensions built to the rear. Water supply was originally from two wells, one at <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the close. By 1468 lead pipes had been installed to bring water into the houses, although the wells continued to function until the 19th century. Number 22 is the house which still has most of its original medieval structure as it was originally built.|$|E
5|$|On 6 July 1950, the Queen Mother {{travelled}} {{the line}} {{as far as}} Cranbrook when she visited the National Sanatorium at Benenden. The five-coach Royal Train was pulled by a Maunsell E1 class 4-4-0 No. 31067, Her Majesty using a Pullman car named Malaga, which was flanked by two corridor composites; there was a corridor third brake at <b>each</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the train. Malaga was one of six twelve-wheel first-class kitchen cars which had been built in 1920–1; and following an extensive refit in late 1949, was occasionally used in the Royal Train. It was withdrawn in 1961, and is preserved close to Shepperton railway station.|$|E
