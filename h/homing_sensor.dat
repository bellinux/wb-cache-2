50|$|The P-15M {{was fitted}} with an L band active radar <b>homing</b> <b>sensor</b> {{and a new}} radar {{altimeter}} both developed for the 'Siren', {{but there was no}} room for a datalink in the smaller 'Styx'. Folding wings were added to reduce the size of the missile, and the missile can be launched at a maximum depth of 30 m.|$|E
50|$|It was {{possible}} to adapt the Martel ARM to be used against different wavelength radars. It was an improvement compared to the early Standard ARM missiles, that had only one narrow-band <b>homing</b> <b>sensor.</b> But the ARM sensor was only selectable on the ground, not in flight and so before taking-off {{it was necessary to}} know what kind of radar should be attacked.|$|E

50|$|All {{versions}} of the missile would use inertial navigation aided by Global Positioning System (GPS). The Navy and one Air Force version were to use an imaging infrared <b>homing</b> terminal <b>sensor</b> to recognize the target and terminal homing, and would be fitted with a unitary warhead. A second version Army missile would be launched by two booster rockets and carry the Combined Effects Bomblet (CEB) submunition against land targets.|$|R

His most noticeable work includes bioinspired tissue adhesives to augment or replace sutures and staples, engineered stem cell <b>homing,</b> cell surface <b>sensors,</b> a needle that automatically stops {{when it gets to}} the right location, and inflammation responsive drug release.|$|R
5000|$|Air-to-air {{missiles}} are broadly put in two groups. Those designed to engage opposing aircraft at ranges {{of less than}} 30 km are known as short-range or [...] "within visual range" [...] missiles (SRAAMs or WVRAAMs) and are sometimes called [...] "dogfight" [...] missiles because {{they are designed to}} optimize their agility rather than range. Most use infrared guidance and are called heat-seeking missiles. In contrast, medium- or long-range missiles (MRAAMs or LRAAMs), which both fall under the category of beyond visual range missiles (BVRAAMs), tend to rely upon radar guidance, of which there are many forms. Some modern ones use inertial guidance and/or [...] "mid-course updates" [...] to get the missile close enough to use an active <b>homing</b> <b>sensor.</b>|$|E
50|$|Being the {{successor}} of the DM2A3, it features an advanced electrical propulsion {{system and a}} fiber optic cable for torpedo guidance and communication, which, in conjunction with advanced signals processing and mission logic, makes the torpedo largely countermeasure resistant. The DM2A4/SeaHake mod 4 is the first torpedo ever to be guided by a fiber optic wire. With a fully digital system architecture, increased range and speed and its new conformal array sonar with a very wide panoramic sensor angle {{as well as the}} additional wake <b>homing</b> <b>sensor,</b> the DM2A4/SeaHake mod 4 provides greatly advanced performance over its predecessor. The homing head shell is a hydrodynamic optimised parabolic shape which aims to reduce torpedo self-noise and cavitation to an absolute minimum. The homing head's conformal transducer array permits detection angles of +/-100° in the horizontal and +/-24° in the vertical, therefore supporting larger acquisition angles in comparison to traditional flat arrays. The wide angle array is designed to reduce maneuvering when in search and reconnaissance stages, therefore also reducing self-noise and preserving battery power.|$|E
40|$|Camouflage, decoy and {{deception}} techniques {{can play a}} decisive role on the modern battlefield. The rapid advance of surveillance, targeting and weapons <b>homing</b> <b>sensor</b> technology now makes every ele-ment which is detected almost assured of being destroyed. Camouflage, decoy {{and deception}} equipment and techniques are a low cost way to increase survivability and shift this balance by reducing the signa-ture of targets (camouflage), increasing the signature level of the background (clutter), creating false targets (decoy), and distorting the perceived target value (disguise). eL-decoy and deception concept presently being considered is to remotely create the perception of noise in the heads of personnel by exposing them to low power, pulsed microwaves. When people are illuminated with properly modulated low power microwaves the sensa-tion is reported as a buzzing, clicking, or hissing which seems to originate (regardless of the person's position in the field) within or just behind the head * 1 - The phenomena occurs at average power densities as low as microwatts per square centimeter with carrier frequencies from 0. 4 to 3. 0 GHz. By proper choice of pulse charac-S teristics, intelligible speech may be created. Before this technique may be extended and used for military applications, an understanding D of the basic principles must be developed. Such an understanding is C [...] .) not only required to optimize {{the use of the}} concept for camouflage, Sdecoy and deception operations but is required to properly assess _j safety factors of such microwave exposure...|$|E
50|$|Two {{versions}} of the missile were developed: one that had a booster-rocket engine with seven rockets {{and the other with}} four. Additionally, the experimental samples used liquid fuel rocket engine that has been developed for a rocket-powered torpedo, but it was planned that operational production missiles would use a solid-fueled engine with twice the thrust. Development launcher and radar system were that of Japanese Kappa sounding rocket that was imported in Yugoslavia. Target detection and information collection would be carried out by Yugoslav-made M 61 Fruška Gora radar, and in-course guidance supplied by a US-made 3-M-7 aiming radar. For operational use there existed the possibility of using more sophisticated radar equipment. For terminal guidance the missile would switch to independent <b>homing</b> by infrared <b>sensors</b> in its nose. The advanced guidance system of the R-25 was automatic after launch with no further operator input.|$|R
