5000|$|The name peach basket hat became popularly used around 1908 in the United States. An {{advertisement}} in the Pittsburgh Gazette describes [...] "the new Peach Basket Hats", also {{showing an}} illustration of a flower-decorated straw hat {{in the shape of}} a basket. While the term peach basket does not appear to have been used in the British fashion press, descriptions involving fruit baskets were. A 1908 comment piece in The Guardian by Evelyn Sharp described a variety of oversized designs, including one similar to Roundhead headgear, noting that they were: [...] "hideously popular" [...] and came trimmed with a variety of flower, fruit and bird motifs. Sharp added: [...] "A basket of market produce pinned on the head would have much the same effect. For next to the difficulty of finding the head of the wearer underneath the hat of to-day comes the difficulty of finding <b>hat</b> <b>shape</b> under the trimming of to-day".|$|E

40|$|Lasers are {{currently}} {{used in many}} processes in which materials are manipulated, including abalation of polymers, cutting of both metals and nonmetals, and annealing of semiconductors. In many applications, the processes include not only changing the material properties but patterning them as well. Computer-generated holograms are diffractive optical elements (DOE) that permit very general changes in phase and amplitude of an incoming wave. By adjusting the local phase function, one can create the desired target intensity in the image plane. The DOE responsible for the phase shifts is called a phase mask.

40|$|Groups of {{starlings}} {{can form}} impressive shapes as they travel northward {{together in the}} springtime. This is {{among a group of}} natural phenomena based on swarm behaviour. The research field of artificial intelligence in computer science, particularly the areas of robotics and image processing, has in recent decades given increasing attention to the underlying structures. The behaviour of these intelligent swarms has opened new approaches for face detection as well. G. Beni and J. Wang coined the term “swarm intelligence” to describe this type of group behaviour. In this context, intelligence describes the ability to solve complex problems. The objective of this project is to automatically find exactly one face on a photo or video material by means of swarm intelligence. The process developed for this purpose consists of a combination of various known structures, which are then adapted to the task of face detection. To illustrate the result, a 3 D <b>hat</b> <b>shape</b> is placed on top of the face using an example application program...|$|E

40|$|In {{sheet metal}} forming process, {{springback}} is a critical problem for die makers, particularly in case of advanced high strength steels. Therefore, FE simulations were often used to calculate materials deformation behavior and the springback occurrence of formed sheet metals. Recently, the Yoshida–Uemori model, a kinematic hardening model, has shown great capability for describing the elastic recovery of a material. Nevertheless, determination of model parameters is sophisticated for industrial applications. In this work, an AHS steel grade JIS JSC 780 Y was investigated, in which tension–compression tests were carried out and the procedure of parameter identification was analyzed. Different fitting methods were examined and verified by evaluation of cyclic stress–strain responses obtained from simulations of 1 –element model and experiments. The most appropriate parameter set was determined. Finally, <b>hat</b> <b>shape</b> forming test was performed and springback obtained by calculation and experiment was compared.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} {{a study on the}} production of Finnish prosody. The effect of word order and the tonal shape in the production of Finnish prosody was studied as produced by 8 native Finnish speakers. Predictions formulated with regard to {{results from a}}n earlier study pertaining to the perception of promi- nence were tested. These predictions {{had to do with the}} tonal shape of the utterances in the form of a flat hat pattern and the effect of word order on the so called top-line declination within an adver- bial phrase in the utterances. The results from the experiment give support to the following claims: the temporal domain of prosodic focus is the whole utterance, word order reversal from unmarked to marked has an effect on the production of prosody, and the pro- duction of the tonal aspects of focus in Finnish follows a basic flat hat pattern. That is the prominence of a word can be produced by an f 0 rise or a fall, depending on the location of the word in an utterance. The basic accentual shape of a Finnish word is then not a pointed rise/fall <b>hat</b> <b>shape</b> as claimed before since it can vary depending on the syllable structure and the position within an ut- terance...|$|E
