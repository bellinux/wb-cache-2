In 1993, Ferretti of America, Inc. was founded to market motoryachts in the USA, Canada, Mexico, Venezuela and the Caribbean.

25|$|The Monash University Prato Centre {{is located}} in the 18th-century palace, Palazzo Vaj, in the {{historic}} centre of Prato, a city near Florence in Italy. Primarily, it hosts staff and students from Monash's other campuses for semesters in Law, Art Design & Architecture, History, Music, and Criminology as well as various international conferences. It was officially opened on 17 September 2001 as part of the university's vigorous <b>internationalisation</b> policy.|$|E
25|$|From the {{beginning}} of the 1980s, against a backdrop of deregulation and technological change, <b>internationalisation</b> of the markets and the emergence of new financial instruments, Société Générale set itself two commercial objectives. It focused increasingly on private customers via its network of branches and by acquiring specialised subsidiaries. It pursued and expanded its activities in the capital markets in France, and then, on a selective basis, in the different international financial centres.|$|E
25|$|Tertiary {{education}} in Italy is divided between public universities, private universities and the prestigious and selective superior graduate schools, {{such as the}} Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa. The university system in Italy is generally regarded as poor for a world cultural powerhouse, with no universities ranked among the 100 world best and only 20 among the top 500. However, the current government has scheduled major reforms and investments {{in order to improve}} the overall <b>internationalisation</b> and quality of the system.|$|E
25|$|DLSU is also {{a member}} of several {{international}} university associations, namely: the ASEAN University Network, Association of Christian Universities and Colleges in Asia, Association of Southeast and East Asian Catholic Colleges and Universities, Association of Southeast Asian Institutions of Higher Learning, International Association of Lasallian Universities, International Association of Universities, International Federation of Catholic Universities, United Board for Christian Higher Education in Asia and University Cooperation for <b>Internationalisation.</b> The university {{is also a}} member of local organizations, including the Philippine Association for Technological and the South Manila Inter-Institutional Consortium.|$|E
25|$|In {{the twenty-first}} century, {{a number of}} new factors have {{facilitated}} the comparison of spiritual traditions – and the place of women within them – to an unprecedented level. These include: (i) a fresh wave of technological globalisation, which has obliterated communicational borders; (ii) the advent of cheap mass international air travel, which has hugely increased people's exposure to other cultures; and (iii) the <b>internationalisation</b> of higher education, whereby students and scholars alike are spending ever-increasing amounts of time in countries with different religious demographic compositions to their own.|$|E
25|$|In the 16th {{century the}} changes in the wealth and culture of the upper social orders caused tastes in music to diverge. There was an <b>internationalisation</b> of courtly music in terms of both instruments, such as the lute, dulcimer and early forms of the harpsichord, and in form with the {{development}} of madrigals, pavanes and galliards. For other social orders, instruments like the pipe, tabor, bagpipe, shawm, hurdy-gurdy, and crumhorn accompanied traditional music and community dance. The fiddle, well established in England by the 1660s, was unusual in being a key element in both the art music that developed in the baroque, and in popular song and dance.|$|E
25|$|When Monash University {{expanded}} in the 1990s, the Law School {{chose not to}} extend itself to other campuses. Instead, it chose to selectively use the University's <b>internationalisation</b> to create new opportunities for international study and research. The result was the establishment and expansion of international collaboration and exchange programs with law schools around the world. Additionally, the Law School established the Prato Program and the Malaysia Program, allowing its students to complete part of their degrees at the University's campuses in Malaysia and Tuscany. In 2008, Monash Law School {{announced that it would}} begin offering a dual Master of Laws with the Washington College of Law - the first such program by an Australian law school.|$|E
25|$|The Government of India {{is aware}} of the plight of higher {{education}} sector and has been trying to bring reforms, however, 15 bills are still awaiting discussion and approval in the Parliament. One of the most talked about bill is Foreign Universities Bill, which is supposed to facilitate entry of foreign universities to establish campuses in India. The bill is still under discussion and even if it gets passed, its feasibility and effectiveness is questionable as it misses the context, diversity and segment of international foreign institutions interested in India. One of the approaches to make <b>internationalisation</b> of Indian higher education effective is to develop a coherent and comprehensive policy which aims at infusing excellence, bringing institutional diversity and aids in capacity building.|$|E

There will also be a new facade that blends in with the contemporary looks of Hullett block with new windows and new exterior coat of paint. The tiles along the common areas like the staircase and corridors will also be changed to new ones. There will also be new lifts installed at every block. The current games rooms in the four blocks will be shifted into the current reception lobby and in its place, the Buckley block will have a new mini-mart, Bayley a new gym cum dance studio (only for RIB boarders), Morrison and Moor will have new offices for ORA/RPA and the <b>Internationalisation</b> Office.

Queen's {{is also part of}} the Utrecht Network which works towards the <b>internationalisation</b> of higher education. The university also has exchange programmes with Fordham University School of Law in New York, USA, the University of Newcastle and the University of Tasmania in Australia, and two universities in Canada: Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, and the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta. Ching Yun University in Zhongli District, Taoyuan City, Taiwan, lists Queen's as a 'sister institution'. The university {{is also a member of}} the Top Industrial Managers for Europe (T.I.M.E.) Association.|$|E
500|$|This Anglo-French {{treaty was}} {{negotiated}} in late 1915 and early 1916 between Sir Mark Sykes and François Georges-Picot, {{with the primary}} arrangements being set out in draft form in a joint memorandum on 5 January 1916. Sykes was a British Conservative MP who had risen {{to a position of}} significant influence on Britain's Middle East policy, beginning with his seat on the 1915 De Bunsen Committee and his initiative to create the Arab Bureau. Picot was a French diplomat and former consul-general in Beirut. Their agreement defined the proposed spheres of influence and control in Western Asia should the Triple Entente succeed in defeating the Ottoman Empire during World WarI, dividing many Arab territories into British- and French-administered areas. In Palestine, <b>internationalisation</b> was proposed, with the form of administration to be confirmed after consultation with both Russia and Hussein; the January draft noted Christian and Muslim interests, and that [...] "members of the Jewish community throughout the world have a conscientious and sentimental interest in the future of the country." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tokyo {{emerged as}} a leading {{international}} financial center (IFC) in the 1960s and {{has been described as}} one of the three [...] "command centers" [...] for the world economy, along with New York City and London. In the 2017 Global Financial Centres Index, Tokyo was ranked as having the fifth most competitive financial center in the world (alongside cities such as London, New York City, San Francisco, Chicago, Sydney, Boston, and Toronto in the top 10), and third most competitive in Asia (after Singapore and Hong Kong). The Japanese financial market opened up slowly in 1984 and accelerated its <b>internationalisation</b> with the [...] "Japanese Big Bang" [...] in 1998. Despite the emergence of Singapore and Hong Kong as competing financial centers, the Tokyo IFC manages to keep a prominent position in Asia, for now. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is Japan's largest stock exchange, and third largest in the world by market capitalization and fourth largest by share turnover. In 1990 {{at the end of the}} Japanese asset price bubble, it accounted for more than 60% of the world stock market value.|$|E
60|$|Of {{course this}} {{generalisation}} about America, like other historical things, {{is subject to}} all sorts of cross divisions and exceptions, to be considered in their place. The negroes are a special problem, because of what white men in the past did to them. The Japanese are a special problem, because of what men fear that they in the future may do to white men. The Jews are a special problem, because of what they and the Gentiles, in the past, present, and future, seem to have the habit of doing to each other. But the point is not that nothing exists in America except this idea; it is that nothing like this idea exists anywhere except in America. This idea is not internationalism; on the contrary it is decidedly nationalism. The Americans are very patriotic, and wish to make their new citizens patriotic Americans. But it is the idea of making a new nation literally out of any old nation that comes along. In a word, what is unique is not America but what is called Americanisation. We understand nothing till we understand the amazing ambition to Americanise the Kamskatkan and the Hairy Ainu. We are not trying to Anglicise thousands of French cooks or Italian organ-grinders. France is not trying to Gallicise thousands of English trippers or German prisoners of war. America is the one place in the world where this process, healthy or unhealthy, possible or impossible, is going on. And the process, as I have pointed out, is not <b>internationalisation.</b> It would be truer to say it is the nationalisation of the internationalised. It is making a home out of vagabonds and a nation out of exiles. This is what at once illuminates and softens the moral regulations which we may really think faddist or fanatical. They are abnormal; but in one sense this experiment of a home for the homeless is abnormal. In short, it has long been recognised that America was an asylum. It is only since Prohibition that it has looked a little like a lunatic asylum.|$|E
6000|$|But {{there is}} another cause for my being content for the moment, with this mere chaos of contrasts. There {{is a very real}} reason for emphasising those contrasts, and for shunning the temptation to shut our eyes to them even {{considered}} as contrasts. It is necessary to insist that the contrasts are not easy to turn into combinations; that the red robes of Rome and the green scarves of Islam will not very easily fade into a dingy russet; that the gold of Byzantium and the brass of Babylon will require a hot furnace to melt them into any kind of amalgam. The reason for this is akin to what has already been said about Jerusalem as a knot of realities. It is especially a knot of popular realities. Although it is so small a place, or rather because it is so small a place, it is a domain and a dominion for the masses. Democracy is never quite democratic except when it is quite direct; and it is never quite direct except when it is quite small. So soon as a mob has grown large enough to have delegates it has grown large enough to have despots; indeed the despots are often much the more representative of the two. Now in a place so small as Jerusalem, what we call the rank and file really counts. And it is generally true, in religions especially, that the real enthusiasm or even fanaticism {{is to be found in}} the rank and file. In all intense religions it is the poor who are more religious and the rich who are more irreligious. It is certainly so with the creeds and causes that come to a collision in Jerusalem. The great Jewish population throughout the world did hail Mr. Balfour's declaration with something almost of the tribal triumph they might have shown when the Persian conqueror broke the Babylonian bondage. It was rather the plutocratic princes of Jewry who long hung back and hesitated about Zionism. The mass of Mahometans really are ready to combine against the Zionists as they might have combined against the Crusades. It is rather the responsible Mahometan leaders who will naturally be found more moderate and diplomatic. This popular spirit may take a good or a bad form; and a mob may cry out many things, right and wrong. But a mob cries out [...] "No Popery"; it does not cry out [...] "Not so much Popery," [...] still less [...] "Only a moderate admixture of Popery." [...] It shouts [...] "Three cheers for Gladstone," [...] it does not shout [...] "A gradual and evolutionary social tendency towards some ideal similar to that of Gladstone." [...] It would find it quite a difficult thing to shout; and it would find exactly the same difficulty with all the advanced formulae about nationalisation and <b>internationalisation</b> and class-conscious solidarity. No rabble could roar at the top of its voice the collectivist formula of [...] "The nationalisation of all the means of production, distribution, and exchange." [...] The mob of Jerusalem is no exception to the rule, but rather an extreme example of it. The mob of Jerusalem has cried some remarkable things in its time; but they were not pedantic and they were not evasive. There was a day when it cried a single word; [...] "Crucify." [...] It was a thing to darken the sun and rend the veil of the temple; but there was no doubt about what it meant.|$|E
