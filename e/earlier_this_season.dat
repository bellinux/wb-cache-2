500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN {{gave the}} season an 8.3 out of 10, praising Atwell's performance, {{as well as}} the return of Dottie in the season and the {{additions}} of Ana Jarvis and Whitney Frost. Conversely, he felt Reggie Austin as Jason Wilkes was likable, but ultimately the [...] "character felt a bit bland" [...] and that the humor in the season was pushed [...] "a bit too far". He concluded, [...] "I don't think [...] was quite as tightly-constructed as Season 1 and tonally, it sometimes wrestled with finding the right balance between the cool spy-action elements and the likable comedic aspect... But overall, it was another fun season filled with compelling characters—including a strong villain—and 1940s, Marvel-flavored spy heroics, which benefitted from the new visuals the Los Angeles setting gave it." [...] Molly Freeman, reviewing the season finale for Screen Rant, called the season as a whole [...] "Excellent", particularly praising the character development given to the character of Whitney Frost, but criticized the way that the season ended that character's storyline, stating that the finale [...] "does a disservice to all the character development of Whitney throughout season 2....for the sake of sweeping her aside as easily as possible and giving the other cast members more development and screen time. After watching Agent Carter develop Whitney as such a powerful and sympathetic villain <b>earlier</b> <b>this</b> <b>season,</b> the way the show wrapped up her storyline is a disappointment." ...|$|E
500|$|Lisa {{references}} Nixon's dog Checkers. In addition, the veterinarian is {{a reference}} to Vince Edwards, who played Ben Casey on the 1960s drama of the same name. Also, among the books that {{end up in the}} Simpsons' fireplace are The Lottery by Shirley Jackson, Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, Fatherhood by Bill Cosby, and a book entitled Canine Surgery. Fatherhood was heavily referenced in the episode [...] "Saturdays of Thunder" [...] <b>earlier</b> <b>this</b> <b>season.</b> The scene in which Mr. Burns and Smithers brainwash Santa's Little Helper is a parody of A Clockwork Orange with Beethoven's [...] "Ode to Joy". The film uses footage of a kind that would aggravate a dog: a dog being hit with a rolled-up newspaper, a shoe kicking a water dish, a kitten playing with a ball of string, a tank running over a doghouse, a dog being hit on the head by a falling toilet seat, and finally [...] "footage" [...] of Lyndon Johnson holding his dog up in the air by the ears, which actually occurred. Music from Peter and the Wolf, a children's story composed by Sergei Prokofiev, is played over the wanderings of Santa's Little Helper through Springfield's outer domains. This episode also references several controversies about Michael Jackson; for example, Kent Brockman's butler tells Kent that his pet llama bit Ted Kennedy, and Mr. Burns is sleeping in an iron lung as part of his longevity treatment. This episode shows the first time where someone other than Homer says [...] "Doh!". Lisa exclaims it when she is assigned to do a book report on Copernicus and she realizes she does not have any reference books. In addition, the doctor, who was played by Hank Azaria, and the music that plays when he desperately attempts to save the hamster, is {{a reference to}} Ben Casey. One of the places to where Santa's Little Helper voyages, Swartzwelder County, where he rescues a baby from a burning house, is a reference to the writer of this episode, John Swartzwelder.|$|E
500|$|The {{first song}} was [...] "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin, which Bell said [...] "was a fun homage to Michael Jackson, and it {{set the tone}} for the rest of the episode". Futterman said that Blaine's [...] "slick showmanship" [...] made him a [...] "natural for lead vocals", and Slezak called it [...] "the best use of Darren Criss' voice on Glee in quite some time" [...] and gave it an [...] "A−". Lynch also gave it an [...] "A−", and said Criss [...] "captured the {{excitement}} and the spunky bravado of the original". Sullivan was another fan of [...] "the sheer awesomeness of Darren Criss" [...] on the song, and characterized it as [...] "a tribute that's more respectful than any other in the episode". Chaney dissented from the general approval; she gave it a [...] "C+" [...] and wrote that [...] "the number was appropriately big and splashy, but musically, it sounded like all the funk had been drained right out of it". She described [...] "Bad" [...] similarly as she gave it a [...] "C−": [...] "this tune also sounded noticeably defunkified". Sullivan was also unimpressed; he wrote that the performance let [...] "the world know what 'Bad' sounds like after it's drained of every ounce of danger". Lynch gave it a [...] "B" [...] and wrote that [...] "as silly as a choreographed gang fight between teenagers in a parking lot sounds (and was), the choreography was crisp and the attitude was a lot of fun". Slezak also praised the fight choreography, and stated that he [...] "got chills" [...] when Santana sang the chorus, and gave the song a [...] "B+". Futterman noted the [...] "interesting twist" [...] in the song's arrangement [...] "thanks to the Warblers' penchant for a cappella", and said that [...] "Artie and Santana" [...] began their battle for [...] "vocal MVP of the episode" [...] with [...] "Bad". Votta described the number as [...] "up there with the Dreamgirls performance from <b>earlier</b> <b>this</b> <b>season</b> as one of the strangest and best things Glee has done".|$|E
5000|$|Episode 12Discussing {{the matchup}} between coaches Gary Kubiak and Mike Shanahan, the gang anticipates some [...] "Shanahanagiens" [...] and notes that Kubiak will not call time out {{immediately}} before a kicker like Shanahan did <b>early</b> <b>this</b> <b>season</b> {{to win a}} game.|$|R

2500|$|Following Joshuah's eviction, HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "More...or Less" [...] Head of Household competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were given false {{statements}} that revolved around numbers, and had {{to determine whether the}} correct answer was more or less than the given answer; the first HouseGuest to reach seven points would be the winner. Adam was the winner. On Day 57, HouseGuests {{competed in the}} [...] "A True Big Brother Mash" [...] food competition. For this competition, HouseGuests had to make pathways out of mashed potatoes and gravy in an attempt to fill up containers to earn food for the week. Later that day, Adam chose to nominate Sharon and Sheila for eviction. On Day 58, HouseGuests competed in [...] "The Rainmaker" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were given an event from <b>earlier</b> <b>this</b> <b>season,</b> and were required to find rocks in the backyard stating when the event happened. The last HouseGuest to bring the correct answer each round was eliminated. Ryan was the winner of the Power of Veto. Following this, the other members of Team Christ began to become suspicious of Natalie, feeling she was aligned with almost everyone in the house. On Day 60, Ryan chose to use the Power of Veto to remove Sheila from the block, with James being nominated in her place. On Day 63, James became the eleventh HouseGuest to be evicted from the house in a unanimous vote of three to zero. He became the fourth member of the Jury of Seven.|$|E

5000|$|Billy Grifter from Den of Geek gave a good {{review to}} the episode {{saying that the}} second season of the show gets better and better and that the episode was both {{entertaining}} and divisive in equal measure. [...] "It might seem early to cook up an end-of-season storm, but those behind Defiance are obviously planning something big to start so <b>early.</b> <b>This</b> <b>season</b> of defiance just gets better, and I can’t {{wait to see what}} crazy places it will take us next." ...|$|R

[...] The Cariboo Sentinel of Barkerville commented on October 13, 1869: [...] "About forty Chinamen are working the bench by shooting the gravel down to the Clearwater River, and are making from $4 to $9 a day. With proper water works this bench would yield a large amount of gold, and its extent offers employment to hundreds of miners." [...] Neither of these reports suggests the specific location of the activities on the Clearwater River and, as mileage calculated in those days was generally inaccurate, the figure given by the B.C. Tribune is practically meaningless. Later reports about hydraulic mining, however, indicate that the Chinese miners were probably working upstream from Hobson Lake.|$|R
