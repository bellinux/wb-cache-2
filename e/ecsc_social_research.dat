During the Schuman Plan debates, SPD leaders argued that they had higher chances of enacting a program of full employment and socialization at the national level, rather than within a supranational community, while the SFIO leaders concluded that the High Authority would strengthen the influence of workers in the coal and steel industries. After ECSC ratification, the SFIO and SPD criticized the paucity of the <b>ECSC’s</b> <b>social</b> achievements, and consistently pressured the High Authority to enforce the social provisions of the Treaty of Paris...|$|R

40|$|Within {{the last}} two decades {{qualitative}} <b>social</b> <b>research</b> has established itself in most, if not all, of the social sciences. But this emergence has proceeded very differently in institutional and in socio-cognitive aspects. From the beginnings of qualitative <b>social</b> <b>research,</b> critical stances toward science, the sociology of science, and methodological reflexivity organized self-observation. For a long time qualitative <b>social</b> <b>research</b> compared itself primarily to quantitative <b>social</b> <b>research.</b> But in the last years, qualitative <b>social</b> <b>research</b> began focusing more on its own processes and evaluative criteria. The concept of performativity is suitable to ground a theoretical reflection on this new focus in self-observation. This concept has proved useful in analyzing the practices of science, especially in approaches as Actor-Network-Theory and Social Studies of Finance. The article introduces the concept of performativity and describes those dimensions most relevant for the field of qualitative <b>social</b> <b>research.</b> An extended perspective for a sociology of <b>social</b> <b>research</b> is developed.

40|$|From the {{standpoint}} of performativity theory and French epistemology the article offers {{a new perspective on}} the field of <b>social</b> <b>research.</b> The methods and methodologies of empirical <b>social</b> <b>research</b> are regarded as constituting not only the object of <b>social</b> <b>research</b> but sociology as a scientific discipline itself. Research methods and techniques have become socio-cognitive schemes of sociological scientific perception. Since the 1960 s educational training in empirical <b>social</b> <b>research</b> has been forming an empirical disciplinary habitus. The contribution sketches out a social historical perspective on the contribution of <b>social</b> <b>research</b> to the co-construction of modern societies.

40|$|What makes {{scraping}} methodologically {{interesting for}} <b>social</b> and cultural <b>research?</b> This paper {{seeks to contribute}} to debates about digital <b>social</b> <b>research</b> by exploring how a ‘medium-specific’ technique for online data capture may be rendered analytically productive for <b>social</b> <b>research.</b> As a device that is currently being imported into <b>social</b> <b>research,</b> scraping {{has the capacity to}} re-structure <b>social</b> <b>research,</b> and this in at least two ways. Firstly, as a technique that is not native to <b>social</b> <b>research,</b> scraping risks to introduce ‘alien’ methodological assumptions into <b>social</b> <b>research</b> (such as an pre-occupation with freshness). Secondly, to scrape is to risk importing into our inquiry categories that are prevalent in the social practices enabled by the media: scraping makes available already formatted data for <b>social</b> <b>research.</b> Scraped data, and online social data more generally, tend to come with ‘external’ analytics already built-in. This circumstance is often approached as a ‘problem’ with online data capture, but we propose it may be turned into virtue, insofar as data formats that have currency in the areas under scrutiny may serve as a source of social data themselves. Scraping, we propose, makes it possible to render traffic between the object and process of <b>social</b> <b>research</b> analytically productive. It enables a form of ‘real-time’ <b>social</b> <b>research,</b> in which the formats and life cycles of online data may lend structure to the analytic objects and findings of <b>social</b> <b>research.</b> By way of a conclusion, we demonstrate this point in an exercise of online issue profiling, and more particularly, by relying on Twitter to profile the issue of ‘austerity’. Here we distinguish between two forms of real-time research, those dedicated to monitoring live content (which terms are current?) and those concerned with analysing the liveliness of issues (which topics are happening?) ...|$|R
40|$|Is <b>social</b> <b>research</b> political? Should it be political? What are the {{implications}} of the politicization of <b>social</b> <b>research?</b> Recent years have seen a growing range of challenges to the idea that research should be governed by the principle of value neutrality. Critical, feminist, antiracist and postmodernist analyses have argued that <b>social</b> <b>research</b> is intrinsically political. In this stimulating and often controversial book, Martyn Hammersley weighs the arguments offered in support of these positions. He considers the fundamental issues that the debate raises about the nature of <b>social</b> <b>research,</b> its political dimensions and its contemporary relevance. At the same time he provides a robust defence of value neutrality as a constitutive principle of <b>social</b> <b>research,</b> and makes a reassessment of the role of research in modern societies...|$|R
