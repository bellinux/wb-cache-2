This proposal had a degree of flexibility, which the European Committee for Banking Standards (ECBS) believed would make it unworkable, and they produced a [...] "slimmed down" [...] version of the standard which, amongst other things, permitted only upper-case letters and required that the IBAN for each country have a fixed length. ISO 13616:1997 was subsequently withdrawn and replaced by ISO 13616:2003. The standard was revised again in 2007 when it was split into two parts. ISO 13616-1:2007 [...] "specifies the elements of an international bank account number (IBAN) used to facilitate the processing of data internationally in data interchange, in financial environments as well as within and between other industries" [...] but [...] "does not specify internal procedures, <b>file</b> <b>organization</b> techniques, storage media, languages, etc. {{to be used in}} its implementation". ISO 13616-2:2007 describes [...] "the Registration Authority (RA) responsible for the registry of IBAN formats that are compliant with ISO 13616-1 [...] the procedures for registering ISO 13616-compliant IBAN formats". The official IBAN registrar under ISO 13616-2:2007 is SWIFT.|$|E

40|$|Increasingly {{demanding}} computation {{requirements and}} tighter energy constraints have motivated distributed and/or hierarchical register <b>file</b> (dhrf) <b>organizations</b> {{as a mean to}} efficiently sustain a sufficient alu utilization in processors targeting embedded applications with many alus. Compared to conventional centralized register <b>file</b> <b>organizations,</b> dhrfs lead to tighter coupling between register allocation and instruction scheduling: since latencies to register files are non-uniform, register allocation affects access latencies, thus in turn affects instruction scheduling. To avoid this phase order- 1 ing problem, researchers have proposed performing instruction scheduling and register allocation simultaneously. While these unified register allocation and instruction scheduling algorithms address the phase ordering problem, {{they can be}} susceptible to scheduling deadlocks: the scheduling algorithm cannot make any forward progress due to its previous decisions. Previous unified algorithms either ignore the scheduling deadlock issue or rely on architectural assumptions with respect to connectivity between register files and functiona...|$|R

50|$|Coding {{conventions}} are a set {{of guidelines}} for a specific programming language that recommend programming style, practices, and methods for each aspect of a program written in that language. These conventions usually cover <b>file</b> <b>organization,</b> indentation, comments, declarations, statements, white space, naming conventions, programming practices, , , architectural best practices, etc. These are guidelines for software structural quality. Software programmers are highly recommended to follow these guidelines to help improve the readability of their source code and make software maintenance easier. Coding conventions are only applicable to the human maintainers and peer reviewers of a software project. Conventions may be formalized in a documented set of rules that an entire team or company follows, or may be as informal as the habitual coding practices of an individual. Coding conventions are not enforced by compilers.|$|E
50|$|A record {{may have}} zero or more keys. A key {{is a field}} or set of fields in the record that serves as an identifier. A unique key is often called the primary key, or simply the record key. For example an {{employee}} file might contain employee number, name, department, and salary. The employee number will be unique in the organization and would be the primary key. Depending on the storage medium and <b>file</b> <b>organization</b> the employee number might be indexed—that is also stored in a separate file to make lookup faster. The department code may not be unique; {{it may also be}} indexed, in which case it would be considered a secondary key, or alternate key. If it is not indexed the entire employee file would have to be scanned to produce a listing of all employees in a specific department. The salary field would not normally be considered usable as a key. Indexing is one factor considered when designing a file.|$|E
