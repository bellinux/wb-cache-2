The payment device allows merchants to accept both chip and pin payments from a mobile device - meaning it accepts all credit and debit cards that are widely used across Europe. The Adyen Shuttle offers <b>face-to-face</b> <b>payment</b> solutions, with payment terminals that work directly with a mobile device to receive payments on the go.|$|E
40|$|With {{technological}} developments, and {{the changing}} needs of global and on-line businesses, innovations in retail payment methods have evolved progressively. The retail business has undergone a transformation from main street business to on-line business {{in the last decade}} due to globalisation, technological developments, application of the Internet and innovative business models. When commerce goes electronic, the means of paying for goods and services must also go electronic. Paper-based payment systems cannot support the speed, security, privacy and internationalisation necessary for electronic commerce. This chapter is an appraisal of retail payment innovations and changes in payment instruments in Australia in the last decade. It highlights continued primacy of cash for <b>face-to-face</b> <b>payments,</b> growth in payment by cards and other new developments to support evolving e-business models. The need for e-payment systems in e-business, an understanding of payment systems, market developments, payment risks and technological applications to payment methods are also discussed...|$|R

Indeed, the more partners from different organizations {{involved in the process}} there are, the more complex the studies are and, accordingly, its protection. As well as the current solutions applied to studying the electronic payment security chain (Common Criteria, ISO 27005, etc), the James Reason model has pointed out the specific risks implied by the interaction between the different links in a complex chain. His theory has been applied to various fields (airplanes, nuclear power plants, health, etc) and various ways of studying it have been proposed. In this article we will attempt to apply his model to the complex electronic payment chain required by the NFC payment process...|$|R
