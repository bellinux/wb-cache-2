40|$|ABSTRACT: The PV-watchdog is {{a highly}} {{accurate}} monitoring device, which gives a visual warning {{by means of a}} red visible LED when (fore example) more than 10 % of the available power is not taken from the PV-module. Since the PV-watchdog is integrated in the PV-laminate, the <b>irradiation,</b> <b>cell</b> temperature and module voltage can be measured very accurately. Based on these measurements and data obtained during the factory flash test of the PV-module, the PV-watchdog continuously calculates the relative power that is lost because the module is not loaded at its maximum power point voltage. When the power loss is higher than the programmed threshold (for example 10 %) and the irradiation is more than 50 W/m 2, a red LED will be turned on by the micro-controller. Besides powerful and simple monitoring, the PV-watchdog offers many advantages, which will lead to a further reduction of PV system costs...|$|E

40|$|Summary Mutations in {{the human}} XPG gene cause Cockayne {{syndrome}} (CS) and xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). Transcription defects have been suggested as the fundamental cause of CS; however, defining CS as a transcription syndrome is inconclusive. In particular, the function of XPG in transcription has not been clearly demonstrated. Here, we provide evidence for the involvement of RAD 2, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae counterpart of XPG, in cell cycle regulation and efficient actin assembly following ultraviolet irradiation. RAD 2 C-terminal deletion, which resembles the XPG mutation found in XPG/CS cells, caused cell growth arrest, the cell cycle stalling, a defective α-factor response, shortened lifespan, cell polarity defect, and misregulated actin-dynamics after DNA damage. Overexpression of the C-terminal 65 amino acids of Rad 2 p was sufficient to induce hyper-cell polarization. In addition, RAD 2 genetically interacts with TPM 1 during cell polarization.
