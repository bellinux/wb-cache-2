25|$|Bravo and Charlie {{companies}} of 1st Battalion 5th SFG crossed the Kuwait border at H-Hour with ODA 531 using breaching demolition charges {{to clear a}} path through the sand berms. Charlie company's seven ODAs in 35 vehicles took the southeastern operation box of the western desert heading towards the towns of Nukyab, Habbariya and Mudyasis, ODA 534 split off to head for the area surrounding Nukyab serching for mobile SCUB-B TEL launch sites. Bravo company set out for the central town of Ar Rutba and H-3 Air Base with six ODAs and a support ODB (Operational Detachment Bravo). ODAs 523 and 524 searched a suspected Scud-B storage facility while ODAs 521 and 525 were tasked with clearing several abandoned airfields, with no sign of Scud launchers, ODA 525 deployed a Special Reconnaissance team to conduct pattern of life surveillance on the town of Ar Rutba. A two-man team called in a pair of nearby F-16C Fighting Falcons to destroy an Iraqi Army radio direction-finding facility they had identified. A second reconnaissance team from ODA 525 deployed to cover the two highways leading to Ar Rutbah, however as the team was compromised by roving Bedouins who informed the Iraqi Army garrison at Ar Rutbah of the teams presence and location, armed Iraqi technicals crewed by the Fedayeen <b>drove</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> search for them, so the Green Berets mounted their GMVs, left their hide and found a position to ambush the Fedayeen, under the weight of fire the Fedayeen retreated. ODA 525 attempted to link up with the two-man reconnaissance team and extract it to safety but large numbers of Iraqi vehicles began driving out of the town to them, the ODAs called in immediate air support. whilst waiting, the reconnaissance team fired on the Fedayeen leaders with their suppressed MK12 sniper rifle and contacted ODA 521 (whom were clearing suspected east of the town) and they reinforced ODA 525. Within minutes, F-16Cs arrived and engaged the Fedayeen vehicles, another Fedayeen convoy attempted to outflank ODA 525 but ran into the guns of ODA 524, after 4 hours of constant and punishing airstrikes on the encircling Fedayeen, eight GMVs of ODA 521 and 525 managed to extract the exposed reconnaissance team under the cover of a B-1B strategic bomber, the vehicles withdrew to ODB 520s staging area south of Ar Rutbah. Over 100 Fedayeen fighters were killed and four armed technicals were destroyed. To the west ODA 523 reinforced ODA 524, but ran into a pair of armed technicals on the highway, both were destroyed by the GMVs, the Green Berets ceased fire when a civilian station wagon full of Iraqi children drove {{into the middle of the}} firefight. ODA 522 also identified two Fedayeen armed technicals proceeding down the highway toward ODA 523, they set an ambush for them, destroying the vehicles and killing 15 Fedayeen.|$|E
500|$|Weeks later, on 30 May, Marseille {{performed}} another mercy mission after witnessing his 65th victory—Pilot Officer [...] of No. 250 Squadron RAF—strike {{the tail}} plane of his fighter and fall {{to his death}} when the parachute did not open. After landing he <b>drove</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the crash site. The P-40 had landed over Allied lines but they found the dead pilot within German territory. Marseille marked his grave, collected his papers and verified his identity, then flew to Buckland's airfield to deliver a letter of regret. Buckland died two days before his 21st birthday.|$|E
500|$|... }} At {{one point}} he <b>drove</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Ohio State University {{hoping to find a}} tenure track {{position}}. The position had already been filled, but the professor of chemistry there, W. L. Evans, knew that Winfred F. (Buck) Coover at Iowa State College in Ames, Iowa, had a position. [...] "I wouldn't normally have chosen the place," [...] Spedding later recalled, [...] "but I was desperate. I thought: I can go there and build up physical chemistry and when jobs really open up I can go to another school." ...|$|E

500|$|In May 1968, John Lennon and {{his wife}} Cynthia Lennon {{separated}} after John's affair with Yoko Ono. The following month, Paul McCartney <b>drove</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> visit Cynthia and John's son, Julian, at Kenwood, the family's home in Weybridge. Cynthia {{had been part of}} the Beatles' social circle since before the band's rise to fame in 1963; McCartney later said he found it [...] "a bit much for them suddenly to be personae non gratae and out of my life." [...] Cynthia Lennon recalled of McCartney's surprise visit: [...] "I was touched by his obvious concern for our welfare ... On the journey down he composed 'Hey Jude' in the car. I will never forget Paul's gesture of care and concern in coming to see us." ...|$|E
500|$|The gods {{declare that}} Loki would deserve a horrible death {{if he could}} not find a scheme that would cause the builder to forfeit his payment, and {{threatened}} to attack him. Loki, afraid, swore oaths that he would devise a scheme to cause the builder to forfeit the payment, whatever it would cost himself. That night, the builder <b>drove</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> fetch stone with his stallion Svaðilfari, and out from a wood ran a mare. The mare neighed at Svaðilfari, and [...] "realizing what kind of horse it was," [...] Svaðilfari became frantic, neighed, tore apart his tackle, and ran towards the mare. The mare ran to the wood, Svaðilfari followed, and the builder chased after. The two horses ran around all night, causing the building work to be held up for the night, and the previous momentum of building work that the builder had been able to maintain was not continued.|$|E
500|$|McMillan heard {{disturbing}} news in April 1944, and <b>drove</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Pajarito Canyon {{to confer}} with Segrè. Segrè's group had tested samples of plutonium bred in the Manhattan Project's nuclear reactors {{and found that it}} contained [...] quantities of plutonium-240, an isotope that caused spontaneous fission, making Thin Man impractical. In July 1944, Oppenheimer reorganised the laboratory to make an all-out effort on implosion. McMillan remained in charge of the gun-type weapon, which would now be used only with uranium-235. This being the case, Thin Man was replaced by a new, scaled-back design called Little Boy. McMillan was also involved with the implosion {{as the head of the}} G-3 Group within the G (Gadget) Division, which was responsible for obtaining measurements and timings on implosion, and served as the laboratory's liaison with Project Camel, the aerial test program being carried out by Caltech. On July 16, 1945, he was present at the Trinity nuclear test, when the first implosion bomb was successfully detonated.|$|E

60|$|Then {{he shook}} hands with Grant {{and got into the}} wagon. Edgar cracked the whip and the team plunged forward.

Flora stood {{watching}} them for a while; and then walked back to the house in the gathering dusk with her face set hard and a pain at her heart.|$|R
500|$|The Gadget was hoisted {{to the top}} of a [...] steel tower. The height {{would give}} a better {{indication}} of how the weapon would behave when dropped from a bomber, as detonation in the air would maximize the amount of energy applied directly to the target (as the explosion expanded in a spherical shape) and would generate less nuclear fallout. The tower stood on four legs that went [...] into the ground, with concrete footings. Atop it was an oak platform, and a shack made of corrugated iron that was open on the western side. The Gadget was hauled up with an electric winch. A truckload of mattresses was placed underneath in case the cable broke and the Gadget fell. The seven man arming party, consisting of Bainbridge, Kistiakowsky, Joseph McKibben and four soldiers including Lieutenant Bush, <b>drove</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the tower to perform the final arming shortly after 22:00 on July 15.|$|E
500|$|On 14 October 1943, Pechersky's escape plan began. During the day, several German SS {{men were}} lured to {{workshops}} {{on a variety}} of pretexts, such as being fitted for new boots or expensive clothes. The SS men were then stabbed to death with carpenters' axes, awls, and chisels discreetly recovered from property left by gassed Jews; with other tradesmen's sharp tools; or with crude knives and axes made in the camp's machine shop. The blood was covered up with sawdust on the floor. The escapees were armed with a number of hand grenades, a rifle, a submachine gun and several pistols that the prisoners stole from the German living quarters, as well as the sidearms captured from the dead SS men. Earlier in the day, SS-Oberscharführer Erich Bauer, {{at the top of the}} death list created by Pechersky, unexpectedly <b>drove</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Chełm for supplies. The uprising was almost postponed since the prisoners believed that Bauer's death was necessary for the success of the escape. Bauer came back early from Chełm, discovered that SS-Scharführer Rudolf Beckmann had been assassinated, and began shooting at the Jewish prisoners. The sound of the gunfire prompted Alexander Pechersky to begin the revolt earlier than planned. Pechersky screamed the preplanned code-words: [...] "Hurrah, the revolt has begun!" ...|$|E
500|$|On September 9, 1939, Selznick, his wife, Irene, {{investor}} John [...] "Jock" [...] Whitney {{and film}} editor Hal Kern <b>drove</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Riverside, California to preview {{it at the}} Fox Theatre. The film was still a rough cut at this stage, missing completed titles and lacking special optical effects. It ran for four hours and twenty-five minutes, but would later be cut down to under four hours for its proper release. A double bill of Hawaiian Nights and Beau Geste was playing, and after the first feature {{it was announced that}} the theater would be screening a preview; the audience were informed they could leave but would not be readmitted once the film had begun, nor would phone calls be allowed once the theater had been sealed. When the title appeared on the screen the audience cheered, and after it had finished it received a standing ovation. In his biography of Selznick, David Thomson wrote that the audience's response before the film had even started [...] "was the greatest moment of [...] life, the greatest victory and redemption of all his failings", with Selznick describing the preview cards as [...] "probably the most amazing any picture has ever had." [...] When Selznick was asked by the press in early September how he felt about the film, he said: [...] "At noon I think it's divine, at midnight I think it's lousy. Sometimes I think it's the greatest picture ever made. But if it's only a great picture, I'll still be satisfied." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, Ulfang's Easterlings {{were also}} betrayed by their lord Morgoth, who had promised them vast lands in Beleriand, {{but now he}} {{commanded}} them to settle in the cold land of Hithlum and forbade them to leave it. There they plundered and harassed the remnant of the House of Hador, mostly old, women and children; those able to work they enslaved, others they <b>drove</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> starve. And many married women of the Folk of Hador by force, because there were few women in their following and [...] "none to compare with {{the daughters of the}} Edain". The Easterlings called the Folk of Hador Strawheads, and were met with such names as Incomers or Wolf-folk.|$|E
2500|$|Down the dial, Dallas' CBS Radio {{affiliate}} KRLD {{concluded the}} coverage of the presidential party's arrival at Love Field and switched to reporter Bob Huffaker who was standing at the corner of Main and Akard Streets in the downtown area, just 1/2 mile east of Dealey Plaza where the shooting occurred. [...] After the president's car passed him, Huffaker continued reporting for several more minutes and was said to have been on the air as the shooting took place (although shots cannot be heard in the audio coverage). [...] Shortly after returning to regular programming with the nationally syndicated religious program Back To The Bible, the first reports of the shooting came through CBS Radio.
