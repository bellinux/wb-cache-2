2500|$|One {{question}} is why the Italians did not send their two operational battleships of [...] at Taranto, both almost ready for action {{and only a few}} hours from the scene. Both capital ships were still undergoing trials, and [...] had suffered an electrical mishap on one of her main turrets. Littorio and [...] would have tipped the balance of <b>fire</b> <b>well</b> onto the Italian side.|$|E
2500|$|Enduring {{questions}} remained after [...] "La Noche Triste" [...] (the Sad Night) {{that have}} taken the Mexican government over 30 years to answer. Eventually in 2001, President Vicente Fox, the president who ended the 70-year reign of the PRI, attempted to resolve {{the question of who}} had orchestrated the massacre. President Fox ordered the release of previously classified documents concerning the 1968 massacre. The documents revealed that Elena Poniatowska's synthesis of the events that October night was accurate, as Kate Doyle uncovered, Thousands of students gathered in the square and, as you say, the government version is that the students opened <b>fire.</b> <b>Well,</b> there's been pretty clear evidence now that there was a unit that was called the Brigada Olympica, or the Olympic Brigade, that was made up of special forces of the presidential guard, who opened fire from the buildings that surrounded the square, and that that was the thing that provoked the massacre.|$|E
60|$|Then, {{the lamp}} being trimmed, the <b>fire</b> <b>well</b> stirred and burning brightly, the hearth clean swept, the {{curtains}} closely drawn, the clock wound up, we entered on our new story.|$|E

6000|$|Graff {{leaned against}} the filing-cabinet, {{his hands in his}} pockets, and laughed. [...] "So I'm <b>fired!</b> <b>Well,</b> old Vision and Ethics, I'm tickled to death! But I don't want you to think {{you can get away with}} any holier-than-thou stuff. Sure I've pulled some raw stuff--a little of it--but how could I help it, in this office?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look, lady," [...] he said. [...] "Do you {{see that}} peak among the {{mountains}} which has a point like a spear, the one that seems {{as though it were}} on <b>fire?</b> <b>Well,</b> behind it lies Bull-Head's kraal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{quite the}} opposite," [...] said he. [...] "But {{do not let}} us joke. I {{think that would be}} the grandest thing of this age. Think of a <b>fire</b> <b>well,</b> with the flames {{shooting}} up perhaps a hundred feet into the air!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{asked me}} last night," [...] he said quietly, [...] "whether I would {{undertake}} {{a mission to}} that people of whom you were telling me--the Sons of <b>Fire.</b> <b>Well,</b> I have been thinking it over, {{and come to the}} conclusion that I will do so----" ...|$|E

50|$|On November 6, 1961 a gas <b>well</b> <b>fire</b> {{broke out}} at Gassi Touil, {{becoming}} {{known as the}} Devil's Cigarette Lighter. It was finally extinguished on April 28, 1962 by <b>well</b> <b>fire</b> specialist Red Adair.|$|R
6000|$|By {{the time}} I dragged my last load in, Nuflo had got his <b>fire</b> <b>well</b> alight, and was heaping on wood {{in a most}} lavish way. [...] "No fear of burning our house down tonight," [...] he remarked, with a chuckle--the first sound of that {{description}} he had emitted for a long time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Monotonous? Exactly," [...] {{supplied}} Mrs. Rachel. [...] "Like a book {{where every}} page is the same, that's what. Dora {{will make a}} good, reliable woman but she'll never set the pond on <b>fire.</b> <b>Well,</b> that sort of folks are comfortable to have round, even if they're not as interesting as the other kind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought they}} were on <b>fire.</b> <b>Well,</b> I'll tell you what's happened." [...] She rose, and then fell back in her chair. [...] "Lock the door!"

50|$|Fire {{struck again}} {{in the early hours}} of February 27, 1919, {{destroying}} Aurora's tiny business district between the old post office and the Aurora Inn. When the south cornices of the Inn caught <b>fire,</b> <b>Wells</b> College President Kerr Duncan McMillan climbed onto the roof and doused the fire with buckets of water handed to him by the village brigade. Today charred beams remain under the roof as a reminder of the Aurora Inn's narrow escape.|$|R
5000|$|Fire Departament of Mińsk County - quite new <b>fire</b> engines (<b>well</b> {{equipped}} after big fire {{in industry}} area {{a few years}} ago) ...|$|R
6000|$|... “6. The Spanish vessels, upon {{clearing}} the harbour, {{turned to the}} westward in column, increasing their speed to the full power of their engines. The heavy blockading vessels, which had closed in toward the Morro, at the instant of the enemy’s appearance, and at their best speed, delivered a rapid <b>fire,</b> <b>well</b> sustained and destructive, which speedily overwhelmed and silenced the Spanish fire.|$|E
60|$|The rain kept on falling, {{though it}} {{appeared}} to grow softer as night settled down black. The wind died away and the forest was still, except for the steady roar of the stream. A folded tarpaulin was laid between the pine and the <b>fire,</b> <b>well</b> in the light and warmth, and upon it the men set steaming pots and plates and cups, the fragrance from which was strong and inviting.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was hired}} by Rancher Niven to help him at Gaspard's Trail, and {{remember}} {{the night of the}} <b>fire</b> <b>well.</b> Guess anybody who'd been trod on by a horse and left with broken bones to roast would," [...] he said; and proceeded to confirm Niven's testimony. This was nothing new, and the interest slackened, but revived again when the witness approached the essential part of his story, and I could hear my own heart thumping more plainly than the slow drawling voice.|$|E
5000|$|Some firefighter's helmets have visors which {{protect the}} eyes from {{infrared}} rays and the radiant heat of <b>fire</b> as <b>well</b> as from impact.|$|R
50|$|Oil <b>well</b> <b>fires</b> are oil or gas wells {{that have}} caught {{on fire and}} burn. Oil <b>well</b> <b>fires</b> can {{be the result of}} human actions, such as {{accidents}} or arson, or natural events, such as lightning. They can exist on a small scale, such as an oil field spill catching fire, or on a huge scale, as in geyser-like jets of flames from ignited high pressure wells. A frequent cause of a <b>well</b> <b>fire</b> is a high-pressure blowout during drilling operations.|$|R
50|$|Before the team's {{appearance}} in the Kraft Fight Hunger Bowl, nearly all of their assistant coaches were <b>fired,</b> as <b>well</b> as head coach Ron Zook.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, Doctor," [...] {{said the}} grave-digger, laughing; [...] "it would crack better teeth than mine, old and crumbly as it is. And yet I {{meant to do}} {{something}} with it that is akin to eating; for my oven needs a new floor, and I thought to take this stone, which would stand the <b>fire</b> <b>well.</b> But here," [...] continued he, scraping away the snow with his shovel, a task in which little Ned gave his assistance,--"here is the headstone, just as I have always seen it, and as my father saw it before me." ...|$|E
6000|$|And now new Prussian force, its Saxons {{being well}} abolished, is {{pressing}} down upon Prince Karl's naked left flank. Yes;--Prince Karl too {{will have to}} go. His cavalry is, for most part, shaken into ragged clouds; infantry, steady enough men, cannot stand everything. [...] "I have observed," [...] says Friedrich, [...] "if you step sharply up to an Austrian battalion [within fifty paces or so], and pour in your <b>fire</b> <b>well,</b> in {{about a quarter of}} an hour you see the ranks beginning to shake, and jumble towards indistinctness;" [...] [Military Instructions. ] a very hopeful symptom to you! ...|$|E
60|$|The man was shocked. It was {{as though}} he had just heard his own {{sentence}} of death. For a moment he sat and stared at the spot where the fire had been. Then he grew very calm. Perhaps the old-timer on Sulphur Creek was right. If he had only had a trail-mate he would have been in no danger now. The trail-mate could have built the <b>fire.</b> <b>Well,</b> it was up to him to build the fire over again, and this second time there must be no failure. Even if he succeeded, he would most likely lose some toes. His feet must be badly frozen by now, and there would be some time before the second fire was ready.|$|E
50|$|Jeonbuk had {{the first}} attempt on target after four minutes when Eninho saw a dipping shot from 25 yards punched away by Saqr. Mamadou Niang <b>fired</b> <b>well</b> over the top six minutes later before Park's cross from the left was glanced into Saqr's arms by Jeon Kwang-Hwan. Jeonbuk then {{took the lead in}} the 17th minute. Eninho was brought down on the left edge of the box but the Brazilian picked himself to fire a {{brilliant}} free-kick into the far side of Saqr's net.|$|R

60|$|She found, {{just before}} dark, an open meadow-like {{break in the}} almost interminable bush. There was a small clump of trees near the center and here she decided to camp. The grass was high and thick, affording feed for her horse and a bed for herself, {{and there was more}} than enough dead wood lying about the trees to furnish a good <b>fire</b> <b>well</b> through the night. Removing the saddle and bridle from her mount she placed them {{at the foot of a}} tree and then picketed the animal close by. Then she busied herself {{collecting}} firewood and by the time darkness had fallen she had a good fire and enough wood to last until morning.|$|E
60|$|While {{the leaders}} of the {{expedition}} were actively engaged in preparing for the approaching journey, those who had accompanied it for curiosity or amusement, found ample matter for observation in the village and its inhabitants. Wherever they went they were kindly entertained. If they entered a lodge, the buffalo robe was spread before the fire for them to sit down; the pipe was brought, and while the master of the lodge conversed with his guests, the squaw put the earthen vessel over the <b>fire</b> <b>well</b> filled with dried buffalo-meat and pounded corn; for the Indian in his native state, before he has mingled much with white men, and acquired their sordid habits, has the hospitality of the Arab: never does a stranger enter his door without having food placed before him; and never is the food thus furnished made a matter of traffic.|$|E
6000|$|One of {{the things}} he could not in any wise but rebuild was the great Altar, aloft on which stood the Shrine itself; the great Altar, which had been damaged by fire, by the {{careless}} rubbish and careless candle of two somnolent Monks, one night,--the Shrine escaping almost as if by miracle! Abbot Samson read his Monks a severe lecture: [...] "A Dream one of us had, that he saw St. Edmund naked and in lamentable plight. Know ye the interpretation of that Dream? St. Edmund proclaims himself naked, because ye defraud the naked Poor of your old clothes, and give with reluctance 'what ye are bound to give them of meat and drink: the idleness moreover and negligence of the Sacristan and his people is too evident from the late misfortune by <b>fire.</b> <b>Well</b> might our Holy Martyr seem to lie cast out from his Shrine, and say with groans that he was stript of his garments, and wasted with hunger and thirst!" ...|$|E
60|$|It took fully {{a minute}} to obtain another rocket, and some red <b>fire</b> as <b>well.</b> The red <b>fire</b> made quite an illumination, {{in spite of the}} storm.|$|R
2500|$|Warspite, {{not aware}} of the Italian firing patterns, split her guns between the two ships. During the {{exchange}} one of Giulio Cesares rounds fell long and caused splinter damage to Warspites escorting destroyers [...] and , which had formed up {{on the far side of}} the action. At 15:54 Malaya started <b>firing,</b> <b>well</b> out of range, hoping to cause some confusion on the Italian ships. Meanwhile, the Italian heavy cruisers came into action and started firing on Warspite at 15:55 but had to break off as the Allied cruisers returned.|$|R
50|$|The {{behavior}} of the Iraqi army has a destructive effect on the soil of the Persian Gulf region. Oil leak from <b>fire</b> <b>wells</b> mixed with gravel result in a new layer {{on the surface of}} the desert called “tarcrete” with depth of nine feet. All the plant life under these layers died and it is impossible for flora to grow there. However, scientists suggest refraining from eliminating these layers, because when removed, the dunes under the tarcrete will cause massive dunes to travel, destroying everything in their way.|$|R
