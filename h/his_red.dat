5|$|From 1901 {{the first}} body {{excavated}} {{has remained on}} display in the British Museum. This body was originally nicknamed 'Ginger' due to <b>his</b> <b>red</b> hair; this nickname is no longer officially used as part of recent ethical policies for human remains.|$|E

60|$|He {{emphasized}} {{his speech}} by gestures. He thrust out one rather large ill-shaped hand {{at her with}} two vibrating fingers extended. <b>His</b> ears became <b>red,</b> <b>his</b> nose <b>red,</b> <b>his</b> eyes seemed <b>red</b> and all about these points his face was wrathful white. His hair rose up into stiff scared listening ends. He had his rights, he had some little claim to consideration surely, he might be just nobody but he wasn't going to stand this much anyhow. He gave her fair warning. What was she, what did she know of the world into which she wanted to rush? He lapsed into views of Lady Beach-Mandarin--unfavourable views. I wish Lady Beach-Mandarin could have heard him....|$|R

5|$|After serving <b>his</b> <b>red</b> card suspension, Diaby {{featured}} {{in only one}} match {{in the final two}} months of the season. The match was the second leg of the club's quarter-final Champions League tie against Liverpool. In the match, Diaby netted the opening goal to give Arsenal, who drew 1–1 in the first leg, a 2–1 advantage. Arsenal, however, conceded four goals from Liverpool and lost the tie 5–3 on aggregate. Following the match against Liverpool, Diaby began struggling with a thigh injury. After the injury relapsed in a reserve match in late April, Diaby was ruled out {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|Carpenter faced many {{problems}} associated with this, including {{the possibility of the}} Indians being rescued by their followers or being lynched by angry settlers, during their transport to the civilian court. During transport, Satank hid himself under <b>his</b> <b>red</b> blanket in his wagon while he gnawed the base of his thumb to the bone. This allowed him to slip the manacle from his wrist while he sang his death chant. With a small hidden knife that was not found during two separate searches, he stabbed the driver (who survived), both falling out of the wagon, grabbed a soldier's unloaded carbine and was mortally wounded in his escape attempt.|$|E
50|$|In {{the last}} season of <b>his</b> <b>Reds</b> {{contract}} in 2005, the 31-year-old Stiles was still playing strongly {{enough to be}} the starting loosehead. However, he wasn't offered a new contract and played his final Queensland game against New Zealand A in June 2005, finishing with 93 state caps.|$|R

5|$|Due to <b>his</b> <b>red</b> card {{suspension}} in the World Cup, Gourcuff missed two call-ups to {{the national}} team in August and September. In October 2010, he was called back into the team by his former manager at Bordeaux Laurent Blanc for UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying matches against Romania and Luxembourg. In the match against Romania, Gourcuff appeared as a substitute and scored the final goal in the team's 2–0 victory. He was inserted into the starting lineup against Luxembourg and responded by assisting on the opening goal scored by Karim Benzema and scoring the second goal in another 2–0 win.|$|E
5|$|Elaine holds a baby shower for {{her friend}} Leslie at Jerry's apartment, while Jerry is {{performing}} in Buffalo. George is excited, as {{he expects the}} baby shower {{to be the perfect}} opportunity to confront the woman who gave him the worst date of his life by pouring Bosco chocolate sauce on <b>his</b> <b>red</b> collared shirt while doing performance art. Jerry is frustrated by his television's bad reception, and is convinced by Kramer to have cable illegally installed by two Russians (Vic Polizos and James Lashly).|$|E
5|$|UT lost to Texas Tech {{with one}} second {{remaining}} in the game. McCoy gave a good performance but came up short as <b>his</b> <b>Red</b> Raider counterpart, Graham Harrell had an outstanding day. Following that loss, UT fell to #4 in the BCS rankings. They climbed to #3 the following week as the Horns beat Baylor and former #3 Penn State lost. The win over Baylor was the 829th win for the UT football program, which tied Notre Dame for 2nd {{in the list of}} college football's ten most victorious programs.|$|E
50|$|Kluszewski's {{injuries}} {{had begun}} taking their toll; Kluszewski {{was limited to}} playing just four full seasons in his fifteen-year career and would eventually spend his last four major league seasons {{after he left the}} Reds as a part-time player. <b>His</b> <b>Reds</b> uniform number 18 was retired by the Reds in 1998.|$|R
50|$|He made <b>his</b> <b>Reds</b> {{debut on}} 31 August 1982 in a 0-0 league draw with Birmingham City at St Andrews {{and made a}} further three league {{appearances}} that season.

5|$|Ermac {{was played}} by actor John Turk in the {{digitized}} games Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 and the 1996 compilation title Mortal Kombat Trilogy. As a palette-swapped character, he was physically {{identical to the}} Mortal Kombat games' other male ninjas, save for <b>his</b> <b>red</b> coloring. For Mortal Kombat: Deception, which marked Ermac's return to the series as a playable character after an eight-year absence, {{he was given a}} distinct redesign by Steve Beran, the series' lead character designer and art director. Beran explained that his objective of remaking old characters was to greatly differentiate them from their previous incarnations. His Deception design was maintained for the 2011 reboot game, but with an increased black palette.|$|E
5|$|For {{the second}} time in three years, Žigić was chosen as {{domestic}} player {{of the year in the}} captains' poll, and was also honoured by the Red Star Sport Association as best male athlete of 2005, an award open to athletes representing the club in any sport, not just in football. After Pantelić's departure for Hertha BSC, Red Star's goals were spread more evenly among the remaining forward players. In the league, Žigić and Boško Janković were joint-top scorers with 12, and Purović contributed one fewer, as the club won their 24th title. They completed the double with a defeat of city rivals OFK in the cup final, coming back from 2–0 down via Žigić's 67th-minute free kick under the defensive wall and Purović's equaliser to take the match into extra time, during which Žigić gave Red Star the lead with a header and Dušan Basta made the final score 4–2. After the match, Žigić refused to answer questions about <b>his</b> <b>Red</b> Star future.|$|E
5|$|Félix Trinidad {{was born}} in Fajardo, Puerto Rico, to a Puerto Rican family. During his {{childhood}} {{the family moved to}} Cupey Alto, a subdivision of San Juan, Puerto Rico, where he grew up. His future wife, Sharon Santiago, lived in Cupey and first met Trinidad in the home of her neighborhood friend, a classmate of Trinidad's. Trinidad pursued a relationship with Santiago, including an attempt to impress her with <b>his</b> <b>red</b> Ford Mustang. He continued to press for her affection and, with the help of Santiago's neighbor, Trinidad was able to win her over. Early on, Santiago's mother thought that Trinidad was related to her daughter's friend, but she realized the true situation when she visited the friend's house and he acted nervous in her presence. Santiago's father objected to the relationship because Trinidad was an athlete; at the time many athletes had a negative public image. Santiago became rebellious, but Trinidad eventually won her family's trust. The couple was married four years after they began dating and have had four daughters. Trinidad has a fifth daughter, named Alondra Nicole, from another relationship.|$|E

5|$|Glencross {{established}} himself as an NHL regular in 2007–08. He appeared in 36games for the Blue Jackets before being traded to the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for Dick Tarnstrom on February 1, 2008. Glencross appeared in 26games for the Oilers, scoring 15goals and 25points in 61games combined between Columbus and Edmonton. Though he played well with Edmonton, the Oilers {{did not make a}} contract offer, making him an unrestricted free agent. Glencross hoped to remain in Edmonton as it was close to <b>his</b> <b>Red</b> Deer home. But after the Oilers made little effort to negotiate with him, he chose to sign a three-year, $3.6million deal with Edmonton's provincial rival, the Calgary Flames.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant du Plooy led his {{men around}} the bend, {{carefully}} keeping them behind cover, then sent Coey {{out into the}} open riverbed to give treatment. With <b>his</b> <b>Red</b> Cross flag clearly visible, Coey came out from cover and made for the bodies on the ground. The concealed cadres immediately opened fire and fatally shot him through the head. His lifeless body fell at du Plooy's feet. Coey was the first American fatality of the Rhodesian Bush War. The contact in which he died eventually ended with du Plooy and two other Rhodesians being wounded and a further Rhodesian soldier, Corporal Jannie de Beer, being killed. The insurgents escaped without any further loss to their number.|$|E
5|$|Mooney was {{recalled}} {{from his}} loan at Alfreton {{as a result}} of the one-match suspension Olejnik received for <b>his</b> <b>red</b> card. Winfield scored a 73rd-minute header from a Summerfield corner as York beat their relegation rivals Cheltenham 1–0 at home. York moved six points of the relegation zone after drawing 0–0 away to Oxford. Winfield was sent off in the first half of York's 1–0 home win over relegation-threatened Hartlepool, Summerfield scoring the winning goal during the second half with a deflected 30-yard shot. York ensured their safety from relegation after beating Morecambe 2–1 at home, moving 11 points clear of the relegation zone in 18th-place. Morecambe took the lead through Paul Mullin before Zubar converted Summerfield's corner with a far post header, and Penn scored the winning goal with a long-range strike into the top left-hand corner.|$|E
