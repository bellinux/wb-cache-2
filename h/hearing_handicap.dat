50|$|Hearing loss is {{typically}} quantified by results from an audiogram; however, {{the degree of}} loss of hearing does not predict the impact on one’s quality of life. The impact that NIHL can have on daily life and psychosocial function can be assessed and quantified using a validated questionnaire tool, such as the <b>Hearing</b> <b>Handicap</b> Inventory for the Elderly (HHIE). The HHIE is considered a “useful tool for quantifying the perceived emotional and social/situational consequences of hearing loss.” The original tool was designed to test adults 65 {{years of age and}} older; however, modified versions exist. For adults the <b>Hearing</b> <b>Handicap</b> Inventory for Adults (HHIA) can be used and for adolescents the modified 28-item Hearing Environments And Reflection on Quality of Life (HEAR-QL-28) can be used. The HHIA, for example, is a 25-item questionnaire that asks both social and emotional-specific questions such as: Does a hearing problem cause you to avoid groups of people?” (social) and “Does a hearing problem cause you to feel frustrated when talking to members of your family?” (emotional). Response options are yes, no and sometimes.|$|E

The shortened {{version of the}} <b>hearing</b> <b>handicap</b> inventory (HHIE-S) was administered, scores ≥ 8 defined <b>hearing</b> <b>handicap.</b> Results: baseline hearing impairment was strongly associated with 7 of the 10 HHIE-S questions, 5 years later. Individuals with and without hearing impairment at baseline reported that they felt embarrassed and/or frustrated by their hearing problem, and that it hampered their personal/social life, multivariable-adjusted OR: 11. 5 (CI: 3. 5 - 38. 1), OR: 6. 3 (CI: 2. 5 - 15. 7) and OR: 6. 0 (CI: 2. 1 - 17. 5), respectively, 5 years later.

40|$|Objective: The {{current study}} aimed to {{evaluate}} <b>hearing</b> <b>handicap</b> and its correlates in a Filipino population utilizing either the <b>Hearing</b> <b>Handicap</b> Inventory for the Elderly (screening version) (HHIE-S) or <b>Hearing</b> <b>Handicap</b> Inventory for Adults (screening version) (HHIA-S) (dependent on age). An {{investigation of the}} psychometric properties of the questionnaires, including factor analysis to evaluate the subscales was also conducted. Study sample: Three hundred and nine participants (18 – 86 years) were recruited from a population attending a hearing aid donation program in Manila, Philippines. Results: The average <b>hearing</b> <b>handicap</b> (HHIE-S/HHIA-S) total score was high (26. 28) consistent with the high mean hearing threshold (85. 7  dB HL); however, simple correlation and regression analysis revealed no relationship between hearing threshold and HHIE-S/HHIA-S score. Subsequently, mild-to-severe and profound subgroups were delineated. In the mild-to-severe group, <b>hearing</b> <b>handicap</b> score correlated positively with hearing threshold and negatively with SES. This relationship was not seen in the profound group. MANOVA suggested different response patterns on the HHIE-S/HHIA-S for the two subgroups. Principal component analysis revealed two factors in the HHIE-S/HHIA-S that varied somewhat from the emotional and social subscales intended in the original questionnaire. Conclusions: This study suggests that the HHIE-S and HHIA-S questionnaires are not sensitive to the handicap caused by profound hearing loss. The cause of this lack of sensitivity is not clear but may reflect a ceiling effect. Alternatively, self-rated <b>hearing</b> <b>handicap</b> may be reduced in those exposed to manual communication, or in those who have a congenital hearing loss but who have received minimal intervention. 9 page(s...|$|E

METHODS: this cross-sectional study analyzed 35 participants of the projects: Enriquecimento Cultural e Processos de Envelhecimento and Nucleação, both of Pólo Interdisciplinar na Área do Envelhecimento of the Federal University of Juiz de Fora. Two instruments were used for data collection: an inventory the social-demographic features, general health and hearing perception and a tool reffered to as The <b>Hearing</b> <b>Handicap</b> Inventory for the Elderly, HHIE (adapted by Wieselberg, 1997). We performed the descriptive analysis of the variables under study and, in order to check the association among the occurrence of <b>hearing</b> <b>handicap</b> with the others variables, bivariate analyzes were carried out, by using the X² test, considering p < 0. 05.

40|$|Background: We {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the prospective association between measured hearing impairment, self-reported <b>hearing</b> <b>handicap</b> and hearing aid use with quality of life.

The shortened version of the <b>hearing</b> <b>handicap</b> inventory was administered. Hearing levels were measured using pure-tone audiometry. Quality of life was assessed using the 36 -Item Short-Form Survey (SF- 36); higher scores reflect better quality of life. Results: Hearing impairment at baseline compared with no impairment was associated with lower mean SF- 36 mental composite score 10 years later (multivariable-adjusted p = 0. 03). Physical composite score and mean scores for seven of the eight SF- 36 domains after 10 -year follow-up were significantl y lower among participants who self-reported <b>hearing</b> <b>handicap</b> at baseline. Differences in the adjusted means between participants with and without <b>hearing</b> <b>handicap</b> ranged from 2. 7 (physical composite score) to 10. 4 units ('role limitations due to physical problems' domain). Individuals who developed incident hearing impairment {{compared to those who}} did not, had adjusted mean scores 9. 5 - and 7. 7 -units lower in the 'role limitation due to physical problems', and 'bodily pain' domains, respectively, at the 10 -year follow-up.

Objective: we assessed the association between dual sensory impairment (DSI) and incidence of falls. We examined the influence of self-perceived <b>hearing</b> <b>handicap</b> and hearing aid use and risk of falls. Design: a population-based, cohort study of participants followed over 5 years. Setting: Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, Australia. Subjects: one thousand four hundred and seventy-eight participants aged 55 and older at baseline were included in longitudinal analyses. Methods: visual impairment was defined as presenting or best-corrected visual acuity less than 20 / 40 (better eye), and hearing impairment as average pure-tone air conduction threshold > 25 dB HL (500 – 4, 000 Hz, better ear). The shortened version of the <b>hearing</b> <b>handicap</b> inventory for the elderly was administered. Incident falls were assessed over the 12 months before each visit. Cognitive impairment was determined using the Mini-Mental State Examination. Results: five-year incidence of falls was 10. 4 %. Participants with severe self-perceived <b>hearing</b> <b>handicap</b> versus no <b>hearing</b> <b>handicap</b> had increased risk of incident falls, multivariable-adjusted OR 1. 93 (95 % confidence intervals, CI, 1. 02 – 3. 64).
