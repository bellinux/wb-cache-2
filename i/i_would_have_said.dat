500|$|The Max Weinberg 7 {{released}} a self-titled album in 2000 on Hip-O Records; Weinberg said {{he waited until}} then because [...] "I wanted to change my style of playing and hone my style before I committed to a record." [...] He was especially proud that the band had successfully backed Tony Bennett during a late 1990s appearance on Late Night: [...] "Two years ago if you'd asked me if I could play with Tony Bennett, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> absolutely not. I'm not in his league. But we played with him the other night, and it was wonderful. We swung." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{exclusive}} written interview with The Westmorland Gazette nine months into his sentence, Park talked {{of how he}} had struggled with prison, saying: [...] "They [...] may smoke incessantly, play loud music, the TV or video games, rifle your drawers, steal, lie etc. There {{is not a lot}} you can do about it... I watched a guy [...] "chasing the dragon". It frightened me to death. I had never seen that before." [...] He refused to answer detailed questions about the trial or case, but protested his innocence, saying [...] "If I knew who killed my wife, how, where, why, then <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> so. I did not know then. I do not know now." ...|$|E
500|$|After he had cut Blakelock, Hill said, Silcott {{told him}} he was cool and asked what he had seen. Hill said he replied, [...] "Nothing," [...] and that Silcott said, [...] "Well, you can go." [...] He said the aim of the attack had been to decapitate Blakelock and put his head on a stick. In 1991, he told Rose that, {{throughout}} the interview, the police were saying, [...] "Go on, admit it, you had a stab," [...] and [...] "It was Sticks, wasn't it?" [...] He said they threatened to keep him in the station for two weeks and said he would never see his family again. [...] "They could have told me it was Prince Charles and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> it was him." ...|$|E

500|$|John Kerr as Francis Barnard. [...] The Tony Award-winning actor (for Tea and Sympathy (1955)) {{had been}} a once-promising leading man in the 1950s, {{featured}} in major roles in the theatrical film versions of Tea and Sympathy (1956) and Rodgers and Hammerstein's South Pacific (1958). His role as the nominal hero in Pit {{would prove to be}} the last notable film appearance of his career. [...] Years later, Kerr expressed surprise that Pit seemed to be his best remembered role, [...] "If you had told me years ago that Pit and the Pendulum would be The One out of all the stuff I've done, if you had told me that this would be the cult-type movie that people would be collecting memorabilia on, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> 'You're out of your gourd.' Just ... no way. Noooo way!" ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the 2008–09 season, Myrie-Williams was {{released}} by Bristol City. In June 2009, he joined Dundee United on a free transfer, signing a two-year deal with the Scottish Premier League club. Dundee United manager Craig Levein stated [...] "I am excited about the signing and I am sure he will develop into a real talent. Jennison is a player I've known about and admired for some time and up to about two years ago <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> {{he was one of the}} brightest prospects in the country. He is a player who will not only excite the fans with his direct, quick running at defences, but he will also add pace to the team and strengthen our options going forward". Myrie-Williams made his Dundee United debut on 22 August 2009, coming on as an 88th-minute substitute in a 0–0 draw at St Mirren. He made a further two appearances as a late substitute, before starting his first game for Dundee United in the club's 2–0 away win against Ross County in the League Cup on 22 September 2009. He made his first league start on 17 October 2009, playing 84 minutes in a 1–1 home draw against Hamilton Academical, earning the 'Man of the Match' award for his performance. Myrie-Williams was again named as the 'Man of the Match' for his performance in a 2–1 win against Celtic at Tannadice on 22 November 2009— the club's website reported that he made [...] "the most creative impact during the game" [...] and that he [...] "continued his fine form of late and in doing so gave Celtic left back Danny Fox a torrid 90 minutes". He scored his first competitive goal for Dundee United in a 3–2 home win against St Mirren on 5 December 2009, scoring the club's third with a neat finish. He was on the scoresheet again in January 2010, scoring in a game against St Johnstone, Myrie-Williams' goal gave Dundee United the lead after trailing 2–0 at half-time, although the game ended 3–3. Myrie-Williams received the first red card of his career when he was sent-off for two bookable offences in the side's 2–0 home loss against Celtic on 25 April 2010. He played in the club's 2–0 win over Raith Rovers in the Scottish Cup semi-final, but was not selected for the Hampden Park final itself. He made 27 appearances for the [...] "Tangerines" [...] in his first season at the club, scoring twice.|$|E
2500|$|Following the (then) record low of {{the arctic}} sea ice extend in 2007, Mark Serreze, the {{director}} of US National Snow and Ice Data Center, stated [...] "If you asked {{me a couple of}} years ago when the Arctic could lose all of its ice then <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> 2100, or 2070 maybe. But now I think that 2030 is a reasonable estimate." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{signing of}} Andre Rison by Green Bay {{late in the}} season had been a {{surprise}} to the league. [...] Rison had been released by two different teams {{over the past two years}} and was known as a serious disciplinary problem for skipping team meetings. [...] The previous year, the Packers had tried to sign Rison and Favre had spoken positively when a deal was not reached, stating [...] "We saved a lot of money, and a lot of heartache because he was a problem internally." [...] Rison later replied that if he were a defensive player, [...] "I'd try to break his face." [...] He also added [...] "maybe a couple of years ago, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> he's a hillbilly jealous of a black man making money. But now I'm at this age. No comment." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the lead}} authors, Dennis L. Hartmann, {{subsequently}} said; [...] "Going into the IPCC this time, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> that, well, the trend over a 15-year record is not really very meaningful, because of the natural interannual variability of the climate system. But as the IPCC evolved, it {{became more and more}} of a public issue, so we felt we had to say something about it, even though from an observational perspective, it's not a very reliable measure of long-term warming." [...] He said [...] "the apparent reduction in the observed warming rate" [...] was [...] "interesting on purely scientific grounds, but it does not have a huge impact on the scientific assessment and does not alter the basic facts." [...] Research cited in the report had to be published by 15 March, excluding work such as a paper by NCAR scientists including Kevin E. Trenberth indicating that increased heat was going into ocean depths.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2009, the Government {{requested}} {{approval from}} President S. R. Nathan to draw $4.9 billion from past financial reserves to meet current budget expenditure, {{the first time}} it had done so. The sum was used to fund the Government's Resilience Package consisting of two schemes aimed at preserving jobs and businesses during the financial downturn: the Jobs Credit scheme, which provided employers with financial assistance to pay employees' salaries; and the Special Risk-Sharing Initiative, which helped mid-sized companies to obtain credit. The President gave in-principle approval 11 days later on 21 January. During this time, the Government briefed him and the Council of Presidential Advisers (CPA), and the CPA considered the request and provided the President with its recommendation. Subsequently, at a press conference on 17 February, the President explained that when the Prime Minister had broached the subject informally on 10 January, he had agreed at that stage to give every consideration to the proposal as he and the CPA were already aware of the prevailing financial crisis and how it was impacting the country. He commented that he was not an Executive President and that the Executive was really the Government. It was for them to find solutions to the nation's problems and come out with proposals: [...] "As to whether the proposals were right or wrong, we don't micro-manage Government. And it's for the Government in power to determine what is to be done." [...] However, [...] "f they came with scatterbrained proposals <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> no." ...|$|E
60|$|MARCHBANKS. Oh, yes: I've {{got that}} far. Heroics are infectious: I caught the disease from you. I swore {{not to say}} a word in your absence that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>said</b> a month ago in your presence.|$|R
6000|$|... "Assuredly," [...] she said, with a {{smile and}} a sudden {{lighting}} of the eyes, [...] "it was a gallant fight and gallantly didst thou overthrow that black brute. I saw the fray and, though I knew thee not, I greatly feared for one so brave. But I paid him for my fright, for it was I who put it into the mind of Cleopatra to bid the guards strike off his hand--now, knowing who thou art, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> his head." [...] And she looked up shooting a glance at me and then smiled.|$|R
60|$|Why Madam, says I, and look'd very gravely and serious, I {{thought you}} had known that I knew it, or else <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>said</b> so, for <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not offend you; but you may depend I shall never {{discover}} it, unless you order me {{to do so for}} your particular Service.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{know what}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done," [...] <b>said</b> Mrs. Crowder, her eyes very bright; [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> let her kill me. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> never <b>have</b> consented for thee {{to marry the}} wretch." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Nay, but, Rachel, {{you shall}} speak, or I {{will stay with}} you here till your mother comes, and she shall answer for you. If you had disliked me <b>I</b> think you <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> so." ...|$|R
6000|$|Poor Brinsley! if {{they were}} tears of pleasure, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>have</b> <b>said</b> these few, but most sincere, words than have written the Iliad or made his own celebrated Philippic.

60|$|As usual, I communed {{with myself}} {{before going to}} bed. Wherefore this feeling of disappointment?

5000|$|I {{believe the}} models are now remarkably good at {{simulating}} {{most of the}} essential climate forming processes in the atmosphere and the ocean and even the behaviour of the total climate system at the global scale.
