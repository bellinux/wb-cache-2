The agriculture around the town mainly depends on the rivers Koraiyaru, Mullaiyar and Pamaniyar, while the other sources of irrigation are bore-wells. There are no big industries around the town, while there are a few small scale industries like a sugarcane factory, a fertilizer industry, a beer factory and a chemical factory in and around the town.

40|$|ABSTRACT Investigation of Microalgae Growth Kinetics using Coal-Fired Flue Gas as a Carbon Source Bryan Daniel Brooker Energy related {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) {{emissions}} {{make up the}} majority of the United States’ greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions must be alleviated to reduce the effects of global climate change. Microalgae cultivation sequesters CO 2 while producing biomass. Algal biomass can provide a renewable feedstock for biofuel and electricity production, and ingredients for pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, pigments and cosmetics. Utilizing microalgae to mitigate CO 2 emissions encourages energy independence by providing a feedstock for biofuels and offers other potentially profitable avenues for the uses of biomass. This study focused on investigating the algal growth kinetics of microalgae cultivated with artificial coal-fired flue gas. Two algal strains, Chlorella vulgaris and Tetraselmis sp. were cultivated in lab scale photobioreactors to assess the feasibility of using flue gas as a carbon source for microalgae growth. The microalgae growth kinetics were compared between flue gas and pure CO 2 treatments for each algal strain. Both microalgae species were able to grow under flue gas dosing. The differences in growth characteristics for Chlorella were statistically insignificant between the two <b>gas</b> dosing <b>treatments.</b> Tetraselmis yielded identical maximum specific growth rates among the two <b>gas</b> <b>treatments,</b> while the biomass production was greater using CO 2. At a 95 % confidence interval, the difference in biomass production between the <b>gas</b> <b>treatments</b> ranged from 45 to 225 mg/L. The decrease in biomass production for Tetraselmis was the only sign of growth inhibition from flue gas. Overall, Chlorella vulgaris and Tetraselmis sp. are capable of fixating CO 2 from coal-fired flue gas...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{selected}} <b>gas</b> perfusion <b>treatments</b> on the spinlattice relaxation times (T 1) of the soybean (Glycine max) nodule cortex and inner nodule tissue were studied with 1 H high resolution magnetic resonance microscopy. Three <b>gas</b> <b>treatments</b> were used: (a) perfusion with O 2 followed by N 2; (b) O 2 followed by O 2; and (c) air followed by N 2. Soybean plants with intact attached nodules were placed into the bore of a superconducting magnet and a selected root with nodules was perfused with the gas of interest. Magnetic resonance images were acquired with repetition times from 50 to 3200 ms. The method of partial saturation {{was used to}} calculate T 1 times on selected regions of the image. Calculated images based on T 1 showed longer T 1 values in the cortex than in the inner nodule during all of the gas perfusions. When nodules were perfused with O 2 -O 2, {{there was no significant}} change in the T 1 of the nodule between the two <b>gas</b> <b>treatments.</b> When the nodule was perfused with O 2 -N 2 or air-N 2, however, the T 1 of both the cortex and inner nodule increased. In these experiments, the increase in T 1 of the cortex was 2 - to 3 -fold greater than the increase observed in the inner nodule. A similar change in T 1 was found in detached live nodules, but there was no change in T 1 with selective gas perfusion of detached dead nodules. These observations suggest that cortical cells respond differently to selected gas perfusion than the inner nodule, with the boundary of T 1 change sharply delineated at the interface of the inner nodule and the inner cortex...|$|R
