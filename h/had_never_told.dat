5|$|When she {{had reached}} her Clapham Junction flat, {{she began to}} write immediately. In December, Rowling's mother Anne died after ten years {{suffering}} from multiple sclerosis. Rowling was writing Harry Potter {{at the time and}} <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> her mother about it. Her mother's death heavily affected Rowling's writing, and she channelled her own feelings of loss by writing about Harry's own feelings of loss in greater detail in the first book.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the key}} {{elements}} in this hearing was Oppenheimer's earliest testimony about George Eltenton's approach to various Los Alamos scientists, a story that Oppenheimer confessed he had fabricated to protect his friend Haakon Chevalier. Unknown to Oppenheimer, both versions were recorded during his interrogations of a decade before. He was surprised {{on the witness stand}} with transcripts of these, which he had not been given a chance to review. In fact, Oppenheimer <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> Chevalier that he had finally named him, and the testimony had cost Chevalier his job. Both Chevalier and Eltenton confirmed mentioning that they had a way to get information to the Soviets, Eltenton admitting he said this to Chevalier and Chevalier admitting he mentioned it to Oppenheimer, but both put the matter in terms of gossip and denied any thought or suggestion of treason or thoughts of espionage, either in planning or in deed. Neither was ever convicted of any crime.|$|E
500|$|On October 18 the New York Post {{accurately}} {{reported that}} her father had been arrested for possession of numbers slips in Newburgh shortly before his death, and inaccurately speculated that something mysterious had been covered up about that death. Ferraro's mother <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> her about his arrest; she had been also arrested as an accomplice but released after her husband's death. The printing of the story led Ferraro to state that Post publisher Rupert Murdoch [...] "does not have the worth to wipe the dirt under [...] shoes." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh;--everywhere. I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> them. It <b>has</b> {{been a kind}} {{of family}} affair and thought to be fit for general discussions." ...|$|R
500|$|King {{states the}} cover was odd; [...] "It {{took me a}} minute and a half to find a spot in the song where I knew where she was. It's so weird. If she <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> us, we would have never known. You could have played it for us and we'd have been like, 'What's that?' Like {{a minute and a}} half through I heard a line and was like, 'I know where she's at!" [...] In response, Slayer sent some T-shirts to Amos, which she said was appreciated. Hanneman echoed similar sentiments as King, but noted that a few years later when Slayer was playing a festival before Amos, Amos would allow Slayer to play a full set when the band was late.|$|E
500|$|Hastert {{also ran}} an Explorers group of which Steve Reinboldt was a member, {{and led the}} group on a diving trip to the Bahamas. In the interview, Burdge stated that in 1979 (eight years after Reinboldt's high school {{graduation}} in 1971), her brother {{had told her that}} he had been sexually abused by Hastert throughout his four years of high school. Burdge said that she was [...] "stunned" [...] by this news and that her brother said that he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> anyone before, because he did not think he would be believed. A message from Hastert appears in Steve Reinboldt's 1970 high school yearbook. In the interview, Burdge said that she believes the abuse stopped when her brother moved away after graduation. [...] Jolene said that Hastert [...] "damaged Steve I think more than any of us will ever know." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Raining Blood" [...] {{was covered}} by Tori Amos on her 2001 album Strange Little Girls. King has {{admitted}} that he thought the cover was odd: [...] "It took me {{a minute and a}} half to find a spot in the song where I knew where she was. It's so weird. If she <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> us, we would have never known. You could have played it for us and we'd have been like, 'What's that?' Like {{a minute and a half}} through I heard a line and was like, 'I know where she's at!'". The band, however, liked the cover enough to send Slayer T-shirts to her. The song was also covered by Malevolent Creation, Chimaira, Vader, Dokaka, Reggie and the Full Effect and Killick Erik Hinds, who covered the entire album on a H'arpeggione. [...] "Raining Blood" [...] was also covered by the New Zealand drum and bass band Concord Dawn on their 2003 album Uprising, and by Nashville, Tennessee band Asschapel on their 7" [...] "Satanation". A medley of [...] "Raining Blood" [...] and [...] "Postmortem" [...] appears on Body Count's 2016 album Bloodlust, preceded by a short monologue by lead singer Ice-T where he names Slayer as both a major influence on Body Count and as one of his favorite bands of all time [...] "and always will be"; a video for Body Count's version was released in August of 2017.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1877, Alice {{returned}} from India and removed the children from Lorne Lodge. Kipling remembers, [...] "Often and often afterwards, the beloved Aunt would ask me why I <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> any one how I was being treated. Children tell little more than animals, for what comes to them they accept as eternally established. Also, badly-treated children have a clear notion {{of what they are}} likely to get if they betray the secrets of a prison-house before they are clear of it".|$|E
2500|$|On 13 May 1917, the {{children}} reported seeing a woman [...] "brighter than the sun, shedding rays of light clearer {{and stronger than}} a crystal goblet filled with the most sparkling water and pierced by the burning rays of the sun." [...] The woman wore a white mantle edged with gold and held a rosary in her hand. She asked them to devote themselves to the Holy Trinity and to pray [...] "the Rosary every day, {{to bring peace to}} the world and an end to the war". While {{the children}} <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> anyone about seeing the angel, Jacinta told her family about seeing the brightly lit woman. Lúcia had earlier said that the three should keep this experience private. Jacinta's disbelieving mother told neighbors about it as a joke, and within a day the whole village knew of the children's vision.|$|E
2500|$|Waltzer {{had been}} {{interviewing}} survivors {{for a new}} book, {{and he had been}} told that the story was probably false. In November 2008 Waltzer contacted forensic genealogists Sharon Sergeant and Colleen Fitzpatrick and started investigating the matter. He found out that the prisoners of that concentration camp were prohibited from approaching a camp's fence on pain of death, nor was anyone allowed to approach a fence from the outside. Such perimeter fences were electrified and watched 24/7 by armed guards stationed on guard towers, ready to shoot anyone who approached the fence from either side. The SS barracks were near to the only fence that faced outwards, and prisoners approaching the barracks would have been executed. Waltzer also discovered that Herman's future wife Roma was never in the town of Schlieben, but that she lived throughout that period in a German farm [...] away, near Breslau. Another survivor of the same camp, Ben Helfgott, told him that Rosenblat <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> the story before the mid-1990s. Waltzer started questioning the publisher and the agent about the authenticity of the story, with little success. Some people actively resisted and tried to shut down his investigation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, you have," [...] he answered, smiling, [...] "you <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> me what {{happened}} to you when you were locked up with the ghost." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That," [...] he said, [...] "must be why I {{tell you}} what I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> to another human being. How mysterious are the {{workings}} of the heart!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all, not at all; but you <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> {{me how you}} got on with Lady Bellamy--that is, {{except what}} she told you about Mr. Heigham." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{came to my}} feet, scarce believing what I heard. Galeotto was Giovanni d'Anguissola--my father! And {{my heart}} <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> me so! ...|$|E
60|$|Mary Louise {{stared at}} this {{inscription}} {{for a long}} while. For the first time, ugly doubts began to creep into her heart. The officer was right {{when he said that}} James Hathaway was masquerading under the false name of Colonel Weatherby. Gran'pa Jim <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> even Mary Louise that his real name was Hathaway; Mamma Bee <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> her, either. With a deep sigh she snapped the case of the watch in place and then began to dress.|$|E
60|$|She was {{overcome}} by an intense desire to tell Mrs. Dalloway things she <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> any one--things she had not realised herself until this moment.|$|E
6000|$|... "No. I can't let {{you out of}} my sight. I {{have seen}} you. You have told me your story. You are honest. You <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> me you loved me." ...|$|R
6000|$|The exultation {{he might}} have felt at what that implied, or seemed to imply, was nullified by his intention, and he rested rigid till he began: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> you--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And you <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> {{any of your}} comrades {{that you}} have killed your man? Or that Dalboy proclaimed you in his salle {{to be one of}} the finest blades in Europe?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Dolefully {{coming into}} the hall, she saw Arthur's black travelling-bag. Was {{it for more than}} the day? The evenings were bad enough--but a desolate night! And he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> her!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{what is it}} he has said?" [...] she at last asked. Caroline <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> {{her aunt}} that that letter had been shown to Mr. Harcourt, and had no {{intention}} of telling her so now.|$|E
60|$|Dan was a {{young man}} who took life and himself very seriously. He seldom smiled, never joked, and had a Washingtonian {{reputation}} for veracity. Dan <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> a conscious falsehood in his life; he never even exaggerated.|$|E
6000|$|... "I never asked. I hate gossiping, and I make a rule {{to inquire}} into no secrets but such as are voluntarily confided to me; and I {{know that she}} <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> Sabina." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There, Aura, 'tis {{my turn to}} blush!" [...] {{cried the}} Major, comically hiding his face behind Betty's fan. [...] "But all this time you <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> me who was this young spark." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Well, I don’t care if she ain’t. He <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> me {{anything}} about her; never {{a word about}} any of his own belongings. If I wished I might believe he’s ashamed of them.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{my money}} alone. Then {{he told me}} that he was engaged to you. He <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> me before, but yet I knew it. It all came out then. Lucy, though he is engaged to you, it is me that he loves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She blamed me, of course," [...] he said slowly, [...] "because I <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> her. It {{was his own}} desire, and I {{think that}} he was right. I have telegraphed for him to come over. He will be here to-night or to-morrow." ...|$|E
60|$|If the {{impression}} from Naldo's command {{had been much}} more recent than it was, the constraining effect of Romola's mysterious authority would have overcome it. But the sense that she was telling what she <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> before made her begin with a lowered voice.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, that you, a gazelle, {{should be}} able to speak, for, from the beginning, my father and mother and all the people that are in the world <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> me of a talking gazelle.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose that}} is the case," [...] she said sympathetically, in answer to his last remark. [...] "You <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> me {{anything}} about your last campaign. You were injured in it, were you not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} you to know--that is why I spoke of it. You <b>have</b> <b>never</b> asked me, and I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> you that the {{convictions}} I formerly held I lost. And with them, for a while, went everything. At least so I believed." ...|$|R
