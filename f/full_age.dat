5|$|The {{position}} and rights of Scottish peers {{in relation to}} the House of Lords remained unclear during most of the eighteenth century. In 1711, The 4th Duke of Hamilton, a peer of Scotland, was made Duke of Brandon in the Peerage of Great Britain. When he sought to sit in the House of Lords, he was denied admittance, the Lords ruling that a peer of Scotland could not sit in the House of Lords unless he was a representative peer, even if he also held a British peerage dignity. They reasoned that the Act of Union 1707 had established the number of Scots peers in the House of Lords at no more and no less than sixteen. In 1782, however, the House of Lords reversed the decision, holding that the Crown could admit anyone it pleases to the House of Lords, whether a Scottish peer or not, subject only to qualifications such as being of <b>full</b> <b>age.</b>|$|E
25|$|By custom, all {{males of}} <b>full</b> <b>age</b> {{have a right}} to {{petition}} the king directly through the traditional tribal meeting known as the majlis. In many ways the approach to government differs little from the traditional system of tribal rule. Tribal identity remains strong and, outside of the royal family, political influence is frequently determined by tribal affiliation, with tribal sheikhs maintaining a considerable degree of influence over local and national events. As mentioned earlier, in recent years there have been limited steps to widen political participation such as the establishment of the Consultative Council in the early 1990s and the National Dialogue Forum in 2003.|$|E

His mother became his regent. His parents were second cousins. In 1893, King Alexander, aged sixteen, arbitrarily proclaimed himself of <b>full</b> <b>age,</b> dismissed the regents and their government, {{and took the}} royal authority into his own hands. His action won popular support, as did his appointment of a radical ministry. In May 1894 King Alexander arbitrarily abolished King Milan's liberal constitution of 1888 and restored the conservative one of 1869. His attitude during the Greco-Turkish War (1897) was one of strict neutrality.|$|E

As explained by his alternate timeline counterpart Black Zero and shown when Superboy himself was aged to an adult by Klarion, Superboy gained new powers such as heat vision and super hearing when he matured to <b>full</b> <b>age</b> as well as gained a higher form of increased telekinesis, strength and greater invulnerability.|$|E
25|$|Possibly {{the most}} {{important}} aspect of good trust management is to have good trustees. In virtually all cases, a settlor will have identified who trustees will be, but even if not or the chosen trustees refuse a court will, in the last resort appoint one under the Public Trustee Act 1906. A court may also replace trustees who are acting detrimentally to the trusts. Once a trust is running, Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996 section 19 allow beneficiaries of full capacity to determine who the new trustees are, if other replacement procedures are not in the trust document. This is, however, simply an articulation of the general principle from Saunders v Vautier that beneficiaries of <b>full</b> <b>age</b> and sound mind may by consensus dissolve the trust, or do with the property as they wish. According to the Trustee Act 2000 sections 11 and 15, a trustee may not delegate their power to distribute trust property without liability, but they may delegate administrative functions, and the power to manage assets if accompanied with a policy statement. If they do, they can be exempt from negligence claims. For the trust terms, these may be varied in any unforeseen emergency, but only in relation to the trustee's management powers, not a beneficiary's rights. The Variation of Trusts Act 1958 allows courts to vary trust terms, particularly on behalf of minors, people not yet entitled, or with remoter interests under a discretionary trust. For the latter group of people, who may have highly restricted rights, or know very little about a trust terms, the Privy Council affirmed in Schmidt v Rosewood Trust Ltd that courts have an inherent jurisdiction to administer trusts, and this goes especially to a requirement for information about a trust to be disclosed.|$|E

5000|$|The actual {{amount of}} {{benefits}} provided to the recipient depends on {{the age at which}} they claim their social security benefits, relative to their <b>full</b> retirement <b>age.</b> <b>Full</b> retirement <b>age</b> (FRA) is a function of year of birth and is defined by the Social Security Administration as follows:Eligible individuals can begin collecting old-age insurance benefits as early as age 62, which {{is referred to as the}} Early Entitlement Age (EEA). Accordingly, individuals born between 1/02/1955 and 1/01/1956 are eligible to accept retirement benefits when they turn 62 in 2017. However, there exists a penalty for collecting benefits before full retirement age: the recipient's monthly benefits are permanently reduced. For instance, if a recipient turns age 62 in 2017, their benefit will be approximately 25.8 percent lower than it would have been at <b>full</b> retirement <b>age</b> of 66 and 2 months. In contrast, recipients are rewarded through delayed retirement credits if Social Security benefits are claimed after full retirement. For recipients born in 1943 or later, 8 percent is added to the yearly benefit amount for each year the recipient delays receiving Social Security benefits beyond their <b>full</b> retirement <b>age.</b> No delayed credit is given after age 69. Eligible individuals who collect their benefits at <b>full</b> retirement <b>age</b> will receive their calculated PIA. More specifically, in 2017, beneficiaries who retire at <b>age</b> 62, <b>full</b> retirement <b>age,</b> or age 70 receive $2153, $2687, or $3538, respectively, in benefits.|$|R

2500|$|When Baron Walter died in 1198, Fitzwalter succeeded to his estates, being already {{more than}} of <b>full</b> <b>age</b> and {{married to his}} first wife, Gunnor.

Francisque Xavier Michel said that Fitzwalter came to be [...] "one of the greatest men in England, {{and one of the}} most powerful".

2500|$|In {{its essence}} the word [...] "trust" [...] applies to any {{situation}} where one person holds property {{on behalf of}} another, and the law recognises obligations to use the property for the other's benefit. The primary situation in which a trust is formed is through the express intentions {{of a person who}} [...] "settles" [...] property. The [...] "settlor" [...] will give property to someone he trusts (a [...] "trustee") to use it for someone he cares about (a [...] "beneficiary"). The law's basic requirement is that a trust was truly [...] "intended", and that a gift, bailment or agency relationship was not. In addition to requiring certainty about the settlor's intention, the courts suggest the terms of the trust should be sufficiently certain particularly regarding the property and who is to benefit. The courts also have a rule that a trust must ultimately be for people, and not for a purpose, so that if all beneficiaries are in agreement and of <b>full</b> <b>age</b> they may decide how to use the property themselves. The historical trend of construction of trusts is {{to find a way to}} enforce them. If, however, the trust is construed as being for a charitable purpose, then public policy is to ensure it is always enforced. Charitable trusts are one of a number of specific trust types, which are regulated by the Charities Act 2006. Very detailed rules also exist for pension trusts, for instance under the Pensions Act 1995, particularly to set out the legal duties of pension trustees, and to require a minimum level of funding.|$|E

40|$|Under Social Security, married {{individuals}} {{are entitled to}} a retired worker benefit based on their own earnings and/or to a spousal benefit equal to one half of their spouseâ€™s benefit claimed at the <b>Full</b> Retirement <b>Age</b> (currently 66). If a married individual claims before the <b>Full</b> Retirement <b>Age,</b> the Social Security Administration assumes that the individual is claiming both types of benefits, compares the worker and spousal benefits, and awards the highest. Upon reaching the <b>Full</b> Retirement <b>Age,</b> individuals can choose which benefit to receive. As a result, married individuals can claim a spousal benefit at 66 and switch to their own retired worker benefit at a later date. This approach allows a worker to begin claiming one type of benefit while still building up delayed retirement credits, which will result in a higher worker benefit later. In the past, providing these benefit options for spouses was not particularly valuable, since those who postponed benefits beyond the <b>Full</b> Retirement <b>Age</b> were giving up expected lifetime benefits. With the recent advent of an actuarially fair delayed retirement credit, lifetime benefits are roughly the same whether claimed at the <b>Full</b> Retirement <b>Age</b> or at age 70.
