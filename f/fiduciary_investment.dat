40|$|The nondelegation {{rule has}} been a {{familiar}} feature of the doctrinal landscape of the Anglo-American law of trusts. In the formulation of the Restatement of Trusts (Second) of 1959, the rule places the trustee 2 ̆ 2 under a duty to the beneficiary not to delegate to others the doing of acts which the trustee can reasonably be required personally to perform. 2 ̆ 2 The nondelegation rule was thought to apply with particular force to the trustee 2 ̆ 7 s investment responsibilities. The Restatement (Second) says flatly: 2 ̆ 2 A trustee cannot properly delegate to another power to select investments. 2 ̆ 2 The new Restatement of Trusts (Third) : Prudent Investor Rule, completed in 1992, rejects the nondelegation rule of the 1959 Restatement. The 1992 Restatement-hereafter, Restatement (Third) -is a partial revision of the Restatement (Second), limited to matters bearing on trust-investment law. Not only does the Restatement (Third) approve delegation, it imposes upon the trustee a positive duty to act prudently in considering 2 ̆ 2 whether and how to delegate 2 ̆ 2 investment functions. A projected Uniform Prudent Investor Act (UPIA), scheduled for approval by the Uniform Law Commission in 1994, implements the prodelegation position taken in the Restatement (Third) and articulates standards for effective delegation. The changed attitude toward delegation that characterizes the Restatement (Second) and UPIA was foreshadowed across the previous decades {{in a series of}} influential enactments that endorsed the delegation of <b>fiduciary</b> <b>investment</b> responsibilities: the Uniform Trustees 2 ̆ 7 Powers Act in 1964, the Uniform Institutional Management of Funds Act (UMIFA) in 1972, and ERISA, the federal pension law, in 1974...|$|E

40|$|This paper uses a hedonic {{pricing model}} and National Council of Real Estate <b>Investment</b> <b>Fiduciaries</b> data to {{estimate}} economic depreciation for multi-family real estate. The {{findings indicate that}} investment grade multi-family housing depreciates approximately 2. 7 % per year in real terms based on total property value. This implies a depreciation rate for just the building of about 3. 25 % per year. With 2 % inflation, this suggests a nominal depreciation rate of about 5. 25 % per year. Converted into a straight-line depreciation rate that has the same present value, this suggests a depreciable life of 30. 5 years - as compared to 27. 5 years allowed under the current tax laws. Thus, these laws are slightly favorable to multi-family properties by providing a tax depreciation rate that exceeds economic depreciation, which is {{in part due to}} inflation that has been less than expected during the past decade. ...|$|R

Results demonstrate that while value-added and opportunistic private equity real estate investments have higher returns than core investments, their superior returns are driven by beleaguered market conditions as well as by the use of cheap debt...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{portfolio}} {{theory is}} no longer quite the safe harbor for <b>fiduciaries</b> making <b>investment</b> decisions that it once was (Hawley et al. 2011). One {{reason for this is}} the prolonged uncertainty in the financial markets that was mentioned by chairman Bernanke in 2010 and which still seems to be with us two years (at the time of writing) down the line. In such an environment, the pension fiduciary faces both the external pressures stemming from a prolonged uncertain investment outlook, and the internal pressures stemming from employers and participants reacting to economic uncertainty and voicing their concerns related to the investment of pension assets. Fiduciaries have a duty to balance the interests of their different participant groups, and understanding the perspectives of those beneficiaries is critical to successful implementation of fiduciary obligations (Hawley et al. 2011; Berry and Scanlan 2014). From a practical perspective, unrecognized stakeholder expectations can pose risks to follow-through on implementation of investment strategies. How should the pension fiduciary act when the expected correlations among asset classes fail to materialize? How should the pension fiduciary interpret the apparently mixed signals from plan sponsors whose reactions to the sudden exposure to significant unfunded liabilities range all the way from derisking (by shifting more plan assets into fixed income investments) to seeking higher expected returns (by increasing the plan's exposure to hedge funds and private equities) ?

40|$|In {{this article}} three econometric {{issues related to}} private-equity return indices, such as real estate indices, are {{explored}} (smoothing, nonsynchronous appraisal and cross-sectional aggregation). Under certain assumptions, {{it is found that}} index returns based on appraisals follow an ARFIMA(1, d, 1) (autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average) process, where the long memory parameter (d) explains the level of smoothing and the AR and MA parameters represent the level of persistence in marketwide fundamentals and the nonsynchronous appraisal, respectively. The empirical results show that: (1) the level of smoothing in appraisal-based real estate indices is far less than assumed in many academic studies (2) there is weak evidence of nonsynchronous appraisal in the UK, IPD (Investment Property Databank) index and (3) marketwide fundamentals are highly persistent for the IPD index returns.

Evidence is presented which links superior real estate investment performance to positive excess skewness in the return distribution.

In addition to this, the study finds that inflation and the omission of assets from the market proxy also accounts in part for superior real estate investment performance...|$|R
40|$|Real estate indices {{based on}} appraisals or sale prices of {{properties}} {{are known for}} their slow response to market news. These indices can therefore be represented (in logarithm) as the sum of a latent "true" price index and a lagging error. We show that the latent appreciation return and the lagging error can be jointly estimated in a state-space model, which has two key features. First, it employs exogenous variables known to predict asset returns to predict the latent appreciation return. Second, it incorporates known sources of the lagging error, such as the partial adjustment in observed index to the latent appreciation return and the seasonality in reappraisal quality. We find that, after the estimated lagging errors are removed, the appraisal-based National Council of Real Estate <b>Investment</b> <b>Fiduciaries</b> returns become more informative and hence exhibit (i) greater variance, (ii) weaker auto correlation, (iii) higher correlation with the returns of the securitized real estate and (iv) more timely response to market news.
