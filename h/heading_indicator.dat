5|$|Flight Unlimited II is {{a flight}} {{simulator}} video game: its gameplay is a simulation of piloting real-world planes. Players may control the Piper PA-28R-200, de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver, Beechcraft Baron 58, North American P-51D Mustang or Cessna 172. The interactive cockpit of each plane {{is based on}} its real-world counterpart, and it contains simulated flight instruments such as an airspeed indicator, a <b>heading</b> <b>indicator</b> and a VOR indicator, among others. The player begins by engaging in a Quick Flight or by using the fixed-base operator (FBO) interface. In a Quick Flight, the player selects a plane and the flying conditions before taking off; the FBO interface features additional options, such as lessons, flight plans and adventures. The game's six lessons detail such maneuvers as takeoffs and taxiing. Adventures are pre-built missions, with objectives such as landing on an aircraft carrier, helping a prisoner to escape from Alcatraz Island or dropping turkeys into Candlestick Park. There are 25 adventures in total.|$|E
25|$|Unlike a {{directional}} gyro or <b>heading</b> <b>indicator,</b> a gyrocompass seeks north. It detects {{the rotation of}} the Earth about its axis and seeks the true north, rather than the magnetic north. Gyrocompasses usually have built-in damping to prevent overshoot when re-calibrating from sudden movement.|$|E
25|$|The <b>heading</b> <b>indicator</b> or {{directional}} gyro has an {{axis of rotation}} that is set horizontally, pointing north. Unlike a magnetic compass, it does not seek north. When being used in an airliner, for example, it will slowly drift away from north and {{will need to be}} reoriented periodically, using a magnetic compass as a reference.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Heading</b> <b>indicator,</b> {{also known}} as {{direction}} indicator, a lightweight gyroscope (not a gyrocompass) used on aircraft ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{primary means}} of {{establishing}} the heading in most small aircraft is the magnetic compass, which, however, suffers from several types of errors, including that created by the [...] "dip" [...] or downward slope of the Earth's magnetic field. Dip error causes the magnetic compass to read incorrectly whenever the aircraft is in a bank, or during acceleration or deceleration, {{making it difficult to}} use in any flight condition other than unaccelerated, perfectly straight and level. To remedy this, the pilot will typically manoeuvre the airplane with reference to the <b>heading</b> <b>indicator,</b> as the gyroscopic <b>heading</b> <b>indicator</b> is unaffected by dip and acceleration errors. The pilot will periodically reset the <b>heading</b> <b>indicator</b> to the heading shown on the magnetic compass.|$|E
50|$|The <b>heading</b> <b>indicator</b> (also {{known as}} the {{directional}} gyro, or DG) displays the aircraft's heading with respect to magnetic north when set with a compass. Bearing friction causes drift errors from precession, which must be periodically corrected by calibrating the instrument to the magnetic compass. In many advanced aircraft (including almost all jet aircraft), the <b>heading</b> <b>indicator</b> {{is replaced by a}} horizontal situation indicator (HSI) which provides the same heading information, but also assists with navigation.|$|E
50|$|Since the gyrocompass's north-seeking {{function}} {{depends on}} the rotation around the axis of the Earth that causes torque-induced gyroscopic precession, it will not orient itself correctly to true north if it is moved very fast in an east to west direction, thus negating the Earth's rotation. However, aircraft commonly use <b>heading</b> <b>indicators</b> or directional gyros, which are not gyrocompasses and do not align themselves to north via precession, but are periodically aligned manually to magnetic north.|$|R
25|$|In the 1860s, {{the advent}} of {{electric}} motors {{made it possible for}} a gyroscope to spin indefinitely; this led to the first prototype <b>heading</b> <b>indicators,</b> and a rather more complicated device, the gyrocompass. The first functional gyrocompass was patented in 1904 by German inventor Hermann Anschütz-Kaempfe. American Elmer Sperry followed with his own design later that year, and other nations soon realized the military importance of the inventionin an age in which naval prowess was the most significant measure of military powerand created their own gyroscope industries. The Sperry Gyroscope Company quickly expanded to provide aircraft and naval stabilizers as well, and other gyroscope developers followed suit.|$|R
50|$|Instruments {{are usually}} a basic set given {{the size of}} the panel. It {{consists}} of variometer, altimeter, speed indicator in the top line and two smaller engine instruments below (revolution counter and valve <b>head</b> temperature <b>indicator).</b> Custom upgrades can be of different kind usually providing communication radios, different GPS devices, integrated engine instruments, Hobbs meter, ELT or turn indicators.|$|R
50|$|This {{instrument}} display {{can replace}} {{a magnetic compass}} display in the instrument panel, but not necessarily the gyroscopic <b>Heading</b> <b>Indicator.</b> The <b>Heading</b> <b>Indicator</b> can be combined with information from navigation radios (primarily VOR/ILS) in a similar way, to create the Horizontal Situation Indicator. The HSI, along with the VOR system, has largely replaced use of the RMI, however the HSI's much higher cost keeps the older combination of an RMI and an Omni Bearing Indicator attractive to cost-conscious pilots.|$|E

5000|$|The {{horizontal}} situation indicator (commonly {{called the}} HSI) is an aircraft flight instrument normally mounted below the artificial horizon {{in place of a}} conventional <b>heading</b> <b>indicator.</b> It combines a <b>heading</b> <b>indicator</b> with a VHF omnidirectional range-instrument landing system (VOR-ILS) display. This reduces pilot workload by lessening the number of elements in the pilot's instrument scan to the six basic flight instruments. Among other advantages, the HSI offers freedom from the confusion of reverse sensing on an instrument landing system localizer back course approach. As long as the needle is set to the localizer front course, the instrument will indicate whether to fly left or right, in either direction of travel.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of the attack, the static Sydney Harbour defences {{consisted}} of eight anti-submarine indicator loops— six outside the harbour, one between North Head and South Head, and one between South Head and Middle Head, as well as the partially constructed Sydney Harbour anti-submarine boom net between George's Head on Middle Head and Green Point on Inner South Head. The central section of the net was complete and support piles were in place to the west, but [...] wide gaps remained on either side. Material shortages prevented the completion of the boom net prior to the attack. [...] On the day of the attack, the six outer indicator loops were inactive; two were not functioning and there were not enough trained personnel to man both the inner and outer loop monitoring stations. The North Head– South <b>Head</b> <b>indicator</b> loop had been giving faulty signals since early 1940, and as civilian traffic regularly passed over the loop, readings were often ignored.|$|R

50|$|Bearing to {{the target}} is {{indicated}} by the target's angular position in relation to an imaginary line extending vertically from the sweep origin {{to the top of}} the scope.

30|$|According to Chalmers (1990), {{the basic}} {{objective}} of the academic research consists of the generation, publication, and exploitation of new knowledge about the world. The success of such an objective can only be measured indirectly, which is why different metrics and indicators are proposed and discussed in the literature. To systematize such indicators, Lorenz and Löffler (2015) distinguish between productivity, impact, and esteem <b>indicators.</b> Under the <b>heading</b> of productivity <b>indicators,</b> they subsume those indicators which map the publication output of an academic organizational unit (e.g. number of published journal articles). Impact indicators, in contrast, provide information on the perception of publication output {{in the scientific community}} (e.g. number of citations). The authors summarize surrogates for the quality of research work under the <b>heading</b> of esteem <b>indicators,</b> such as honorary doctorates and memberships of editorial boards of journals. Dyckhoff et al. (2005 a) provide a more extensive structuring of research indicators, the content of which, moreover, is based on the objectives of research performance in business administration. In particular, they distinguish between main effects and desirable and undesirable side effects as the outputs of academic research and expenditure factors as input. In contrast to Lorenz and Löffler, they do not only focus on publication- or citation-based indicators, but also include other research factors such as acquisition of third-party funding and education of young scientists.|$|R

The suggested approach is illustrated {{in the context of}} Mexico’s 1995 stabilization episode. Poverty incidence; IMF monetary model; stabilization policy...|$|R
40|$|Magnetoencephalography (MEG) non-invasively {{measures}} {{the magnetic field}} generated due to the excitatory postsynaptic electrical activity of the apical dendritic pyramidal cells. Such a tiny magnetic field is measured {{with the help of}} the biomagnetometer sensors coupled with the Super Conducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) inside the magnetically shielded room (MSR). The subjects are usually screened for the presence of ferromagnetic materials, and then the <b>head</b> position <b>indicator</b> coils, electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes (if measured simultaneously), and fiducials are digitized using a 3 D digitizer, which aids in movement correction and also in transferring the MEG data from the head coordinates to the device and voxel coordinates, thereby enabling more accurate co-registration and localization. MEG data pre-processing involves filtering the data for environmental and subject interferences, artefact identification, and rejection. Magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI) is processed for correction and identifying fiducials. After choosing and computing for the appropriate head models (spherical or realistic; boundary/finite element model), the interictal/ictal epileptiform discharges are selected and modeled by an appropriate source modeling technique (clinically and commonly used - single equivalent current dipole - ECD model). The equivalent current dipole (ECD) source localization of the modeled interictal epileptiform discharge (IED) is considered physiologically valid or acceptable based on waveform morphology, isofield pattern, and dipole parameters (localization, dipole moment, confidence volume, goodness of fit). Thus, MEG source localization can aid clinicians in sublobar localization, lateralization, and grid placement, by evoking the irritative/seizure onset zone. It also accurately localizes the eloquent cortex-like visual, language areas. MEG also aids in diagnosing and delineating multiple novel findings in other neuropsychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer′s disease, Parkinsonism, Traumatic brain injury, autistic disorders, and so oon...|$|R

40|$|In this {{correlational}} study, {{we investigated}} {{the prediction of}} functional status on discharge from head injury rehabilitation in 64 adults with traumatic closed head injury.

Potential prognostic variables included demographic and social characteristics, severity of injury <b>indicators,</b> <b>head</b> injury deficits present on admission to rehabilitation, and initial Disability Rating Score, and recovery rate. Multiple regression analyses were performed to determine if discharge Disability Rating Score could be predicted from subsets of the potential prognostic variables. Significant contributions were made to the regression equations by initial Disability Rating Score, recovery rate, post-traumatic amnesia and cognitive deficits. A single multiple regression containing the four significant predictors retained initial Disability Rating Score and recovery rate as significant.

Initial Disability Rating Score on admission to rehabilitation emerged as a useful predictor of rehabilitation outcome...|$|R
40|$|The {{assessment}} of the sustainability of agricultural systems is multidimensional in nature and requires holistic measures using indicators with different measurements and units reflecting social, economic, and environmental aspects. To simplify the assessment process, various indicators have different units, and measurements are grouped under broad <b>indicator</b> <b>heads,</b> and normalization and/or transformation processes are carried out in order to aggregate them. In this study, a total of 50 indicators from agricultural sustainability categories of productivity, stability, efficiency, durability, compatibility, and equity are employed to investigate which normalization technique is the most suitable for further mathematical analysis for developing a final composite indicator. To understand the consistency and quality of normalization measurement techniques and compare the benefits and drawbacks of the various selected normalization processes, the indicators of agricultural sustainability are considered. Each of the different techniques for normalization has advantages and drawbacks. This study shows that the proportionate normalization and hybrid aggregation rules of the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean are appropriate for the selected data set, and that this technique has a wider applicability for developing composite indicators for agricultural sustainability assessment...|$|R
40|$|Smallholder {{agriculture}} is {{the mainstay of}} the economy of Tigray, northern Ethiopia. Households located in the food insecure south-eastern zone rely on agriculture for their livelihood. Supplementary income is obtained {{from a range of}} off/non-farm activities. Households in the area consume a restricted diet, dominated by cereals. This study examines smallholder agriculture and food and nutrition security of rural households using mainly survey data collected in the post- and pre-harvest seasons from 400 randomly selected households across four villages in Enderta and Hintalo-Wajerat districts. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were used. Households in the study area own small areas of land (average size only 0. 8 ha), but with important differences across study villages and between gender of household heads, thereby influencing food availability. Ownership of livestock has also similar patterns. Wealthier households (generally correlated with higher income groups) both produce and consume more nutrient-rich food items. Off-farm income comprises 74 % of female-headed households’ income (47 % for male-headed households). A number of food security indicators were calculated by village, season and gender of household <b>head.</b> These <b>indicators</b> generally showed that food insecurity is higher in the preharvest season and amongst female-headed households. Location, livestock ownership and household income were significantly associated with the main food security indicators. Education level of mothers was associated with better food security in the pre-harvest season, supporting women’s empowerment to improved nutrition. Farming practices influence dietary diversity through a combination of production for ownconsumption and income effects. The study concludes {{that there is a need}} to develop policy and specific agricultural interventions to promote more nutrition-sensitive agriculture. This implies a range of actions, including promoting women’s empowerment. There is a need for enhanced promotion of information and knowledge at household level to encourage greater dietary diversity. Multisectoral policy making and implementation need to be strengthened...|$|R
