The identity of these macaws is only likely to be further resolved through fossil finds and examination of contemporary reports and artwork.The Jamaican red macaw (Ara gossei) was named by Walter Rothschild in 1905 on the basis of a description of a specimen shot in 1765. It was described as being similar to the Cuban macaw, mainly differing in having a yellow forehead. Some researchers believe the specimen described may have been a feral Cuban macaw. A stylised 1765 painting of a macaw by Lieutenant L. J. Robins, published in a volume called The Natural History of Jamaica, matches the Cuban macaw, and may show a specimen that had been imported there; however, it has also been claimed that the painting shows the Jamaican red macaw. Rothschild's 1907 book Extinct Birds included a depiction of a specimen in the Liverpool Museum which was presented as a Cuban macaw. In a 1908 review of the book published in The Auk, the reviewer claimed that the picture looked sufficiently dissimilar from known Cuban macaws that the specimen may actually be of one of the largely unknown species of macaw, such as a species from Haiti. The reviewer's objection has not been accepted.|$|R
40|$|Asthma is {{the most}} common {{pulmonary}} condition in childhood affecting as many as five million children in the United States. Traditional medical and nursing protocols rely on asthma education and medications to relieve bronchospasm and control inflammation. Despite these efforts, morbidity and mortality rates have increased, especially in the minority population. With this chronic condition, an interest in complimentary or alternative therapy has grown to control and relieve symptoms. According to Rogers 2 ̆ 7 (1970) nursing framework, a child can experience change from a “pragmatic” wave pattern with asthma patterning to an “imaginative” wave pattern with no asthma patterning. ^ This quasi-experimental study investigated the effects of guided imagery on the perception of dyspnea, medication usage, pulmonary function tests, and human field image in children with asthma. Dyspnea was assessed using a visual analog scale. Medication usage was assessed from data on the home journal. Airway obstruction was assessed by pulmonary function testing. Human field image was assessed using Johnston 2 ̆ 7 s Human Field Image Metaphor Scale (Johnston, 1994). The imagery protocol, consisting of three sessions, elicited perceptions of asthma with either word <b>descriptions</b> <b>or</b> <b>drawings.</b> These data formed the basis of the imagery exercises. Children from 7 to 18 (n = 58) were recruited from two urban clinics. ^ Although not statistically significant with ANOVA testing, of the 31 children in the imagery group, five children reported less medication usage. Those five, an older subset of the sample, experienced changes in pattern from a less restricted and pragmatic human field wave pattern to one more imaginative in nature with increased potential. This is in keeping with Rogers 2 ̆ 7 postulate of resonancy. Scores from the Human Field Image Metaphor Scale increased for both groups. This is in keeping with Rogers 2 ̆ 7 postulate of helicy. Both groups evolved over time and the patterns created and experienced were different than a previous point in time. Results of this study also provide descriptive data regarding the children 2 ̆ 7 s artwork and word descriptions of asthma. Further research is needed to assess the benefits of guided imagery as a complimentary, adjunct therapy for asthma care. ...|$|R
50|$|Later in 2015, Lenoble {{reviewed}} overlooked historical Spanish and French sources, finding {{references to}} mainly red macaws {{consistent with the}} Lesser Antillean macaw. The writings of the French missionary Raymond Breton (on Guadeloupe from 1635 to 1654) were especially illuminating, as they showed that both he and the native Island Caribs clearly distinguished between the red macaws of Guadeloupe and the scarlet macaws from the mainland, which supports {{the idea that the}} Lesser Antillean macaw represents an independent species. As the Lesser Antillean Carib language had different words reserved for men and women, Breton gave the name of the bird as Kínoulou (♂) and Caarou (♀). Lenoble furthermore concluded that the supposed violet macaw (named Anodorhynchus purpurascens based on accounts of blue parrots from Guadeloupe) was based on misidentified references to the also-extinct Guadeloupe amazon (Amazona violacea), and therefore never existed.As many as 13 now-extinct species of macaw have variously been suggested to have lived on the Caribbean islands, but many of these were based on old <b>descriptions</b> <b>or</b> <b>drawings</b> and only represent hypothetical species.

Likewise, written descriptions of an environment also vary in their levels of spatial (e. g., inclusion or exclusion of spatial information) and label-ing (e. g., label addition/removal) detail. Importantly, experience within and memory for an environment may change {{as a function of}} these variations. The present exper-iments examine the interactions of spatial and labeling detail in generating and using mental representations of college campuses. The results of four experiments demon-strate that reducing spatial details through graphic generalization can increase memory for verbally presented information. Results additionally demonstrate the importance of balancing spatial and verbal detail in maps and descriptions in correspondence with human working memory constraints. Accordingly, we present a limited model of appropriate spatial and verbal generalization strategies, with particular regard to implementation in geographical positioning devices...|$|R
40|$|How far can we {{take the}} {{resource}} theoretic approach to explore physics? Resource theories like LOCC, reference frames and quantum thermodynamics have proven a powerful tool to study how agents who are subject to certain constraints can act on physical systems. This approach has advanced our understanding of fundamental physical principles, such as the second law of thermodynamics, and provided operational measures to quantify resources such as entanglement or information content. In this work, we significantly extend the approach and range of applicability of resource theories. Firstly we generalize the notion of resource theories to <b>include</b> any <b>description</b> <b>or</b> knowledge that agents may have of a physical state, beyond the density operator formalism. We show how to relate theories that differ in the language used to describe resources, like micro and macroscopic thermodynamics. Finally, we take a top-down approach to locality, in which a subsystem structure is derived from a global theory rather than assumed. The extended framework introduced here enables us to formalize new tasks {{in the language of}} resource theories, ranging from tomography, cryptography, thermodynamics and foundational questions, both within and beyond quantum theory.

30|$|Related to typological {{guidance}} is {{the technique}} of transfer comparison (cf. Caffarel et al. 2004. Ch. 1). Here, the analyst may identify model descriptions that serve as {{a window into the}} new language. This is often a feasible strategy to manage the enormity of work involved in language description. As discussed in earlier, early SFL descriptions were modelled on Halliday’s description of Chinese and English in the 1950 ’s and 1960 ’s. In recent years, the various editions of IFG (Halliday 1985, 1994; Halliday and Matthiessen 2004, 2014) and Matthiessen’s (1995) LexiCart have provided comprehensive models and guide for the description of languages other than English. As descriptions of many more languages continue to emerge, it is best to work with models from a number of languages {{in order to avoid the}} possibility of imposing the categories of one language upon another, a recurrent albeit unfortunate tendency among linguists, even in contemporary times.
