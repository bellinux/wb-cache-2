40|$|In 2004 the Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI) was {{established}} by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) to quickly identify, secure, remove and/or closely monitor nuclear and radiological materials that pose a high-risk threat to the United States and the international community. Part of GTRI's mission is to convert high performance research reactors and isotope production facilities from their current High Enriched Uranium (HEU) fuel to Low Enriched Uranium (LEU) foil based fuel. In compliance with the conversion portion of the GTRI's mission, the University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR) is currently trying to convert its reactor fuel. The proposed fuel uses a monolithic U- 10 Mo foil meat with a zirconium barrier between the aluminum cladding. This is different than the current HEU fuel meat which is comprised of Uranium dispersed in an aluminum matrix in an aluminum cladding. In addition {{to a change in}} the physical structure of the fuel, the fuel plate thickness has been significantly decreased. The fuel plates in the MURR reactor are subject to high velocity coolant (water) flow. A decreased thickness in the fuel plate suggests that the rigidity of the fuel plate will decrease as well. With concerns about the hydro-mechanical stability of the newly designed fuel plate being exposed to the high velocity flows in the reactor, {{there is a need to}} characterize the structural response of a very thin plate in presence of a velocity flow. Fluid structure interaction (FSI) simulations have been developed to analyze all of the characteristics of a thin fuel plate as the velocity of the water increases across the fuel plate. These models are developed by coupling CFD software, STAR CCM+, with Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software, ABAQUS, to determine the magnitude, location and direction of the deflection of the fuel plate along with other useful metrics to characterize attributes of the flow and movement of the plate. The FSI simulations were designed to replicate the plate thickness, fluid channel geometry and velocities of the experimental set up. The experimental set up consists of a flow loop and curved test section have been constructed for studying plate deflection and channel pressure drop under a variety of fluid flow velocities. The test section consists of two concentric steel cylinders bolted together with spacers between the two to form a fluid channel. The fuel plate inside the test section is clamped at the edges to maintain the axial location of the plate in the fluid channel. The aluminum fuel plate in the test section is 25. 5 inches long, 16 mils (0. 016 inches) thick and has an arc of 45 degrees. The outer cylinder of the test section has five plexi-glass windows that allow deflection data to be collected at various locations by the laser measurement system. The laser measurement system was fixed at the leading edge of the fuel plate because that is where the maximum deflection has been shown to occur. Since the focus of this study is on the maximum deflection of the fuel plate, the laser measurement system was fixed at that point. The FSI simulations were based on seven different geometries. The first consideration was an ideal geometry that the test section was designed to reflect. This consisted of a 130 mils thick inner fluid channel and a 78 mils thick outer fluid channel. Because the test section was assembled at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and then shipped to the University of Missouri, the dimensions of the test section fluid channel geometry was altered during transit. This change in the shape of the fluid channels lead to the need to characterize the shape of the fuel plate and fluid channels again. Since it is physically impossible to characterize the geometry of the entire fuel plate and the azimuthal geometry of the fluid channels of the test section without disassembling it, several geometric options were considered. Three geometries for the shape of the fuel plate were considered. The three fuel plate shapes were based on the distance of the plate based on the distance between the inner radius of the outer cylinder and the location of the fuel plate in the fluid channel. These measurements were obtained by measuring the outer channel gap thickness with a <b>depth</b> <b>micrometer</b> at the pressure tap locations that coincide with the location of the plate. Although this was helpful, it only helped to characterize the shape of the plate between the leading and trailing edges of the plate. This left about eight inches of the fuel plate (4 inches at each end) uncharacterized, leading to the three geometric considerations. The three geometric considerations were combined with two geometric considerations for the fluid channels. An azimuthally constant and varied geometry was considered. This was prompted by the inability to measure the distance of the fluid channels in the azimuthal direction due to the design of the test section. This lead to developing a geometry for the fluid channels that was constant along the azimuthal direction of the fuel plate and another where the fluid channel decreased in thickness as the azimuthal location progressed from the middle of the test section to the edges where the spacers are located. The FSI simulations and the experiments produced deflection results for the 16 mils (0. 016 inches) thick fuel plate at velocities ranging from approximately 2 m/s to 4 m/s. Because the fuel plate is so thin, it has been decided that the velocity in the FSI simulations and experiments should be kept relatively low to avoid permanently damaging the aluminum plate in the test section. The As-Built numeric models have been shown to compare well with the experimental results. The As-Built numeric model results also show that the constant azimuthal fluid channel geometry produces a smaller magnitude of deflection for all three fuel plate shapes considered when compared to the models with a varying azimuthal geometry. the FSI simulations "crashed" for all models ran with a velocity beyond 4 m/s. The experimental results showed that maximum deflection results can be obtained beyond 4 m/s. This provides the opportunity to investigate the differences between the experimental and modeling geometries and recalibrate the model to obtain maximum deflection results through the FSI simulations...|$|E
40|$|Complete sets {{of mineral}} abundances for {{relatively}} unaltered volcanic or volcaniclastic rocks in Gusev Crater have been determined by modeling Mössbauer subspectral areas as mineral weight percentages, and combining those percentages with {{the proportions of}} iron-free minerals not detected by Mössbauer (normative plagioclase, apatite, and chromite, as calculated from Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer (APXS) chemical analyses).

40|$|Heterogeneity effects often {{limit the}} {{accuracy}} of synchrotron X-ray fluorescence microprobe elemental analysis data to ± 30 %. The difference in matrix mass absorption at Kα and Kβ fluorescence energies of a particular element can be exploited to yield information on the average depth-position of the element or account for heterogeneity effects. Using this technique, the heterogeneous distribution of Cu in a simple layered sample could be resolved to a 2 × 2 × 10 (x, y, z, where z is the <b>depth</b> coordinate) <b>micrometer</b> scale; a depth-resolution limit was determined for the first transition metal series and several other elements in calcite and iron oxide matrices.

We used this method to compare solid-state diffusion with sample heterogeneity across the Ni-serpentine/calcite boundary of a rock from Panoche Creek, California. We previously reported that Ni fluorescence data may indicate solid state diffusion; in fact, sample heterogeneity in the depth dimension can also explain the Ni fluorescence data.

Such a relation has been verified by many microindentation experiments (indentation <b>depths</b> in the <b>micrometer</b> range), {{but it does}} not always hold in nanoindentation experiments (indentation depths approaching the nanometer range).

The unified computational model for indentation accounts for various indenter shapes, including a sharp, conical indenter, a spherical indenter, and a conical indenter with a spherical tip. It is based on the conventional theory of mechanism-based strain gradient plasticity established from the Taylor dislocation model to account for the effect of geometrically necessary dislocations.

40|$|AbstractModelling surface {{microstructural}} {{changes is}} a key issue when considering the manufacture of critical metallic parts. During machining, extreme conditions of temperature and deformation appear in the cutting zone. Consequently, surface microstructure is strongly affected with {{a direct impact on}} its integrity and the fatigue resistance of the part. Thus the machining effect on the 15 - 5 PH steel surface has been underlined. To explain and predict the formation of this modified surface layer, the dynamic recrystallization (DRX) has been considered. Firstly, a DRX model has been identified using dynamic compressive tests. The calibrated DRX model is composed of two parts: a criterion of initiation and an evolution law. EBSD maps obtained from compressed samples show recrystallized microstructures comparable with micrographys of machined surface. Then, the DRX model has been implemented in an ALE orthogonal cutting model. Numerical simulation results predict the recrystallized layer at the machined surface.

Herein, we use data from the Cassini spacecraft to derive constraints on the compositional and regional variability of Titan’s dune and interdune regions by combining spectral information from the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) and spatial information from Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) data. Using the combined datasets, we extract pure infrared spectra of dune and interdune regions by extrapolating linear correlations between VIMS reflectance and dune area fraction calculated in each VIMS footprint from SAR images. We applied the same method using the Cassini RADAR Radiometer dataset to extract the microwave surface emissivity of the dune and interdune regions. Globally the dune spectra show little variation, but we find that the interdune spectra exhibit several different behaviors. Similarly, we extract from passive radiometry a mean dune emissivity of 0. 98 ± 0. 01, while interdune emissivity varies from 0. 86 to 0. 98. We find that the interdune regions are often spectrally similar to other Titan terrain units, namely Caladan Planitia, the Adiri Mountains, and Sinlap crater, while the dunes are spectrally distinct from all terrain units. Around Sinlap crater, the interdune regions correspond to the dark blue VIMS unit: the dunes could be forming on top of the ejecta, or the material corresponding to the blue unit could be depositing preferentially in the interdunes areas. There was one region in the Belet sand sea where we were unable to extract the dune and interdune spectra and emissivities in spite of high-quality data, which we interpret to result from a thick sand cover in the interdune regions, implying inactive or saturated dune fields. However, {{the fact that we were}} able to extract distinct dune and interdune spectra and emissivities in most of Titan’s dune fields makes a strong case for sand-free interdune areas of varying composition in these regions, on <b>depths</b> from <b>micrometers</b> to decimeters.

Dry etching has distinct advantages for anisotropic Si processing as compared with wet etching, as it {{does not depend on}} crystallographic effects, and both mono- and polysilicon can be processed in the same way. Reactive ion etching of silicon in RF (13. 56 MHz) parallel plate reactor using SF 6 /O 2 /Ar and SF 6 /CH 4 /O 2 /Ar gas mixtures was studied. Etch rates and anisotropy of etch profiles were examined as functions of gas composition, material of electrode, RF power. As a mask material, thin Al films deposited by evaporation, were used.

The focusing <b>depth</b> of 2 <b>micrometers</b> was aimed to probe the 10 - 15 nm-thick buffer layer where both cubic and hexagonal phases of GaN are coexisting. Typical angular dependency clearly indicated the presence of both isotropic and six-fold contributions. The isotropic I((omega)) (qq) component has a minor one-fold modulation due to a ca. 2 degree(s) disorientation of the top surface {{with respect to the}} hexagonal planes. We attribute the substantial isotropic component to the SHG yield from the bulk of GaN. The occurrence of six-fold I(2 (omega)) (qq) anisotropy, however, indicates a complementary nonlinearities, most likely due to hexagonal phase, which is coexisting with the hexagonal one in the buffer layer region. In general, both surface and bulk nonlinearities are contributing to the reflected SH yield.

Radiative transfer calculations are used with a semi-transparent cloud model {{that is based on}} assumptions of spherical particle shape, a homogeneous underlying surface, and a simple thin cloud parallel to the surface. The model is applied to observed AVHRR data from a 13 -hour old drifting cloud from the August 19, 1992, eruption of Crater Peak/Spurr Volcano, Alaska. The AVHRR data fit in the range of results calculated by the model, which supports its credibility. According to the model results, the average of effective particle radius in the test frame of this cloud is in the range of 2 to 2. 5 <b>micrometer,</b> the optical <b>depth</b> at 12 <b>micrometer</b> is about 0. 60 - 0. 65. The total estimated mass of ash in the air amounts to 0. 24 - 0. 31 x 10 (exp 6) tons, which is about 0. 7 - 0. 9 % of the mass measured in the ashfall blanket. Sensitivity tests show that the mass estimate is more sensitive to the assumed ash size distribution than it is to the ash composition...|$|R
40|$|A {{nondestructive}} {{high energy}} (60 keV) x-ray diffraction method {{to measure the}} internal strain depth-profile in materials was developed using a standard 320 kVp laboratory x-ray source. Traditional x-ray strain measurements are limited to few microns of depth due to the limited penetration of Cu Ka and Mo Ka radiation if a synchrotron or neutron source is not used. The high energy used allows for greater penetration without a synchrotron or neutron facility. Results for aluminum with penetration depths of 1 mm and for titanium with penetration <b>depths</b> of 300 <b>micrometers</b> are demonstrated. The spatial resolution of this depth-profile is 50 micrometers to 125 micrometers depending on the collimation and attenuation of the sample. Sensitivity to a lattice parameter change of 0. 001 A is demonstrated. An energy dispersive HPGe detector is used to perform fixed-angle diffraction measurements. The strain depth-profile measurement is performed by observing {{the change in the}} position of the diffraction peaks in the energy dispersive spectrum. A simulation program of the diffraction system for modeling and validating the experimental setup is developed. A new technique to measure the strain using the natural width of the tungsten Ka 1 line and the diffraction peak normalized intensity is presented. The results of the energy dispersive technique and the tungsten Ka 1 line width technique are compared to the results obtained using high energy angle dispersive XRD technique. Finally we present a preliminary study of the thermal relaxation of residual stress...|$|R
40|$|Interfacial {{reactions}} between {{silica glass}} and tellurite melts were studied under confined {{conditions in the}} temperature regime of 400 - 700 degrees C, applying two different sampling techniques: isothermal heat-treatment of a several micrometer thick tellurite film, confined in a silica/tellurite/silica sandwich, and capillary filling of tellurite melts into silica microcapillaries. The sandwich technique provides detailed ex situ insights on the interface chemistry, microstructure and diffusion after given treatment times and temperatures. Data on dynamic viscosity, surface tension, wetting behaviour and eventual scaling effects {{was obtained from the}} capillary filling technique. For temperatures > 500 degrees C, silica is completely wet by the considered tellurite melts. At T > 600 degrees C and for a treatment time of 20 min or longer, cationic diffusion of Na(+) and Te(4 +) into the silica substrate occurs to a <b>depth</b> of several <b>micrometers.</b> At the same time, the tellurite melt attacks the silica surface, leading to the formation of a stationary silica-tellurite reaction layer and silica dissolution. Dissolved silica was observed to re-precipitate from the tellurite melt by liquid-liquid phase separation. In the early reaction stages, as a result of alkali diffusion into the silica substrate, beta-quartz crystallizes at the interface (what can be avoided by using alkali-free filling glasses). Obtained data set the boundary conditions for the generation of tellurite-silica all-solid fiber waveguides by melt infiltration of silica photonic crystal fibers or microcapillaries.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{facility has}} been developed to investigate single-phase liquid heat transfer and pressure drop {{in a variety of}} microchannel geometries. The facility is capable of accurately measuring the fluid temperatures, heater surface temperatures, heat transfer rates, and differential pressure in a test section. A microchannel test section with a silicon substrate is used to demonstrate the capability of the experimental facility. A copper resistor is fabricated on the backside of the silicon to provide heat input. Several other small copper resistors are used with a four-point measurement technique to acquire the heater temperature and calculate surface temperatures. A transparent pyrex cover is bonded to the chip to form the microchannel flow passages. The details of the experimental facility are presented here. The experimental facility is intended to support the collection of fundamental data in microchannel flows. It has the capability of optical visualization using a traditional microscope to see dyes and particles. It is also capable of performing micro-particle image velocimetry in the microchannels to detect the flow field occurring in the microchannel geometries. The experimental uncertainties have been carefully evaluated in selecting the equipment used in the experimental facility. The thermohydraulic performance of microchannels will be studied as a function of channel geometry, heat flux, and liquid flow rate. Some preliminary results for a test section with a channel width of 100 <b>micrometers,</b> a <b>depth</b> of 200 <b>micrometers,</b> and a fin thickness of 40 micrometers are presented...|$|R
40|$|Alloy steel {{tubes of}} 70 mm length and 20 mm bore {{diameter}} were coated with tantalum of columbium by the wire explosion technique. This process uses {{the energy of}} an electric current pulse to melt or vaporize the coating material {{which is in the}} form of a wire in the center of the tube, and to deposit it on the bore surface. For testing, these tubes were mounted as outlet nozzles on a vented vessel and subjected to propellant gas pulses of 30 ms duration and 2500 K. The pressure buildup inside the vessel was 1000 bar. After each pulse the erosive wear of the test pieces was determined and after testing the reaction zone of the coatings was sputtered to a <b>depth</b> of 2 <b>micrometers</b> and analyzed by AES and SIMS during the process. Both coatingj materials showed excellent adhesion and their erodion resistance proved superior to the unprotected alloy steel. Tantalum, however, exhibited a much better performance than columbium. This was due to the different properties of the gas/metal reaction l ayers formed. In both cases the bore surface was covered with propellant gas residue of 1 micrometer thickness, that was built up and carried out with each pulse. Underneath, a layer consisting of Ta sub 2 O sub 5 or Nb sub 2 O sub 5 was formed. While Ta sub 2 O sub 5 was mechanically stable and therefore, built up to a considerable thickness providing good protection, the Nb sub 2 O sub 5 layer was formed and removed continuously with every round. This pattern exposed the unprotected Nb to the next pulse and caused a much faster wear rate...|$|R
40|$|High-heat-flux removal is {{necessary}} for next-generation microelectronic systems to operate more reliably and efficiently. Extremely high heat removal rates are achieved in this work using a hierarchical manifold microchannel heat sink array. The microchannels are imbedded directly into the heated substrate to reduce the parasitic thermal resistances due to contact and conduction resistances. Discretizing the chip footprint area into multiple smaller heat sink elements with high-aspect-ratio microchannels ensures shortened effective fluid flow lengths. Phase change of high fluid mass fluxes can thus be accommodated in micron-scale channels while keeping pressure drops low compared to traditional, microchannel heat sinks. A thermal test vehicle, with all flow distribution components heterogeneously integrated, is fabricated to demonstrate this enhanced thermal and hydraulic performance. The 5 mm x 5 mm silicon chip area, with resistive heaters and local temperature sensors fabricated directly on the opposite face, is cooled by a 3 x 3 array of microchannel heat sinks that are fed with coolant using a hierarchical manifold distributor. Using the engineered dielectric liquid HFE- 7100 as the working fluid, experimental results are presented for channel mass fluxes of 1300, 2100, and 2900 kg/m 2 s and channel cross sections with nominal widths of 15 <b>micrometers</b> and nominal <b>depths</b> of 35 <b>micrometers,</b> 150 micrometers, and 300 micrometers. Maximum heat flux dissipation is shown to increase with mass flux and channel depth and the heat sink with 15 micrometers x 300 micrometers channels is shown to dissipate base heat fluxes up to 910 W/cm 2 at pressure drops of less than 162 kPa and chip temperature rise under 47 degrees C relative to the fluid inlet temperature...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{drill bit}} buttons with cobalt, nickel and iron binders in {{different}} compositions {{have been tested}} against granite and sandstone and the wear and friction have been measured. Furthermore, the wear and degradation of the buttons have been categorized. Buttons with cobalt binder were tested against granite and sandstone and buttons with alternative binders (Ni, Fe, Co) were tested against granite. Cobalt buttons were used as a reference and the wear and friction of the alternative binders was compared to the reference. The amount of worn rock was also measured. Furthermore, post treated drill bit buttons with a composition of Fe-Ni-Co were compared to buttons with the same composition {{that had not been}} post treated The results show that buttons with an alternative composition of Fe-Co-Ni and Fe- Ni wears less than the cobalt reference. The post treatment process does not decrease the wear of the drill bit but lowers the deviation from the mean wear. The amount of worn rock does not differ between the samples except for between the post treated and not post treated buttons with a composition of Fe-Ni-Co. The post treated buttons produces more rock debris than the not post treated. No apparent difference could be seen {{on the surface of the}} tested buttons after the test. However, composition specific cracks could be found underneath the surface of the samples. EDS-analysis showed signals of oxygen inside of all of the investigated cracks. For some compositions at <b>depths</b> of 20 <b>micrometers.</b> The curves of friction shows similar appearance but the values of the coefficient of friction differs. No apparent correlation was found between the wear and friction of the samples. Furthermore, no apparent correlation was found between the hardness and the wear of the buttons. ...|$|R
40|$|Tissue cells bind to {{extracellular}} matrix (ECM), and this attachment to ECM plays {{an essential role}} in their growth, function, and even survival. Furthermore, the geometry of ECM is known to play an additional role in regulation for these cells to proliferate and differentiate so that tissues with normal morphologies can be formed or maintained. We attempted to culture fibroblast, osteoblast, and bone marrow derived cells in previously described microchannel arrays and newly created micropit arrays, both coated with ECM protein collagen, to examine usefulness of microfabricated structures for elucidating 'what is geometry?' for cells. Cells were inseminated in the well in front of a microchannel array and their movement and stretching behavior against the microchannel array including the entrance and exit terraces were observed using a microscope-TV camera-time lapse video recorder system for 24 hours. Cells entered into the entrance terrace and showed active motions including extending pseudopodia into the channels and whole cell passage through the channels, and fully stretched in the entrance terrace in 8 hours or so. Those cells, however, voluntarily detached themselves from the area in another 8 hours or so probably because of worsening condition of nutrient supply there. Micropit arrays {{used in the present study}} consist of a regular arrangement of circular or square pits of diameter or side length of 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 600 <b>micrometer</b> and <b>depth</b> of 10 <b>micrometer</b> with one size per array or chip. The total area of the pits was designed to be equal to the rest surface area. After four days of incubation of bone marrow derived cells, the total number of cells and the number of cells in the pits were counted. The former and the ratio of the latter to the former appeared to become maximal when the pits of diameter or side length of 100 and 50 micrometer were used, respectively.
