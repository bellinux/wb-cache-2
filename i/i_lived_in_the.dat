Bodley later {{said that his}} talents as a writer lay in non-fiction, adding that of [...] "the many novels (...) and several plays [...] had written, four were {{published}} and two produced, and all failed to arouse any interest." [...] He wrote an essay entitled <b>I</b> <b>Lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Garden of Allah, which was included in Dale Carnegie's 1948 self-help book How to Stop Worrying and Start Living. In 1953 he wrote The Warrior Saint, a biography on Charles de Foucauld. John Cogley from The New York Times said Bodley had [...] "written a clean, poetic and frankly admiring account" [...] of Foucauld's life. In 1955 he wrote the partly-autobiographical self-help book In Search of Serenity. Elsie Robinson from The Index-Journal and Phyllis Battle from the Tipton Tribune gave favourable reviews, with Robinson calling it [...] "a must for every rasped spirit". His next and final book, The Soundless Sahara, was published in 1968; according to the book's back cover he spent part of his years living in Massachusetts, and the rest in either England or France. He provided information for the book The Secret Lives of Lawrence of Arabia, by Phillip Knightley and Colin Simpson, which was published by Thomas Nelson in 1969. He died on 26 May 1970 {{in a nursing home}} in Bramley, Surrey.|$|E
500|$|Little {{is known}} of Coke's early career in Parliament; he spoke {{relatively}} infrequently, and the parliamentary session was dissolved soon after his election. During that summer, however, he struck up a relationship with Charles James Fox, a soon to be famous Whig politician noted for his outspoken and flamboyant lifestyle. Coke later recounted that [...] "When I first went into Parliament I attached myself to Fox and clung to him through life. <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> closest bond of friendship with him." [...] The period was one of economic stability and political calm under Lord North, which ended due to the American Revolution and resulting American Revolutionary War. Coke was noted for his support of the American colonists; as {{a strong supporter of}} the 1688 Glorious Revolution and the resulting Bill of Rights 1689, he felt that the support of the espoused principles of justice and tolerance in Britain and overseas was his duty as a British subject, and saw no conflict between his position as a supporter of the colonists and his patriotism. Following the Battles of Saratoga, it became clear that any victory in America would be long and expensive, and in an attempt to raise funds King George III asked subjects to donate. In Norwich, a meeting was held in January 1778 for this purpose; it raised £4,500 in less than an hour. Windham and Coke attended this meeting, Windham making an impassioned speech pointing out that the campaign had so far resulted only in [...] "disappointment, shame and dishonour", and that [...] "peace and reconciliation with America" [...] was the only option. Windham, Coke and their supporters then withdrew to a nearby pub, where they drafted a petition to the king from [...] "the Nobility, Gentry, Clergy, Freeholders and Inhabitants of the County of Norfolk". This was presented to Parliament by Coke on 17 February 1778, signed by 5,400 people from Norfolk. George III took this as a personal insult, and as a result disliked Coke until his death.|$|E

In his youth, he played minor hockey with the Weston Red Wings. Drake then moved {{to one of the}} city's affluent neighbourhoods, Forest Hill, in 2000. When asked about the move to Forest Hill, Drake replied, [...] " [...] a half of a house we could live in.

2500|$|The attack {{took place}} {{approximately}} {{three weeks before}} the Israeli legislative election of 1981. Opposition leader Shimon Peres criticized the operation as a political ploy, which did not go over well with the electorate. Dan Perry writes that [...] "the Osirak bombing—and Peres's poor political judgement in criticizing it—were crucial in turning the tide of what initially had seemed to be a hopeless election campaign for Likud". Begin responded to Peres's accusation at a Likud rally: [...] "Jews, you have known me for forty years, since <b>I</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hassidoff neighborhood of Petah Tikva to fight for the Jewish people (a reference to Begin's incognito days in the Irgun). Would I send Jewish boys to risk death—or captivity worse than death, because those barbarians would have tortured our boys horribly—for elections?" [...] On 30 June, Likud was reelected over Peres's Alignment party, winning by just one seat in the Knesset.|$|E

[...] Later, at an arranged press meeting, a reporter asked, [...] "Did you kill the President?" [...] and Oswald—who by that time had been advised of the charge of murdering Tippit, but had not yet been arraigned in Kennedy's death—answered, [...] "No, I have not been charged with that. In fact, nobody has said that to me yet. The first thing I heard about it was when the newspaper reporters in the hall asked me that question." [...] As he was led from the room the question was called out, [...] "What did you do in Russia?" [...] and, [...] "How did you hurt your eye?"; Oswald answered, [...] "A policeman hit me." ...|$|E
