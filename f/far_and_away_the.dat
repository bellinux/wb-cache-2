Triceratops fossils are <b>far</b> <b>and</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> most common dinosaur remains found in the latest Cretaceous rocks in the western United States, making up as much as 5/6ths of the large dinosaur fauna in some areas. These facts indicate that some ceratopsians were the dominant herbivores in their environments.|$|E
5|$|With few teams, but a long history, it is {{inevitable}} that intense rivalries have developed in Canadian football. <b>Far</b> <b>and</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> greatest Toronto Argonauts rivalry has been with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and its precursor teams. Fittingly, the Argonauts first game was against a club from Hamilton, while the raucous Eastern Final of 2013—featuring a Tiger-Cat win over the Argos in front of 35,000 at the Rogers Centre—proved the rivalry is alive and well. The two teams meet in Hamilton every year in the Labour Day Classic, a league wide tradition since the late 1940s in which the game's greatest rivalries are showcased.|$|E

5|$|Baltimore was <b>far</b> <b>and</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> most {{successful}} of any American CFL {{team on the}} field and off, averaging crowds of over 37,000 their first year. Knowing that Canadian football was considerably different from the American game, Speros stocked the Stallions mostly with CFL veterans. As coach, he brought in Don Matthews, who had already played in two Grey Cups and won one. The result was a team that eventually finished second in the East with a 12–6 record and became the first American team to qualify for the playoffs. They advanced {{all the way to the}} Grey Cup. In a thrilling match played in BC Place, the BC Lions defeated the Stallions on a last second field goal. Perhaps most remarkably, they were reported to have turned a profit in their first year after an initial US$7 million investment by Speros.|$|E

25|$|Club cricket, by <b>far</b> <b>and</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> widest form of cricket played worldwide, {{is largely}} amateur, but still formal, cricket, with the teams {{organised}} into leagues. The games are sometimes limited-overs, with each innings usually lasting between twenty and fifty overs. Other matches are played to time restrictions. Restrictions in overs or {{time may be}} placed on each side individually, or they may stipulate the total length of the match. The latter more traditional case is often known as declaration cricket.|$|E

Since a great percentage {{of the land of}} Woodford County was tillable, farming was <b>far</b> <b>and</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> most important occupation of the early settlers. Plowing was by means of wooden plows with iron shares; corn was planted by hand and covered using a hoe. Hay, often using wild rather than cultivated grass, was cut with a scythe and taken up with rakes and pitchforks.|$|E

25|$|<b>Far</b> <b>and</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> {{most common}} mode {{by which a}} case reaches the Supreme Court is through an appeal from a {{decision}} rendered by a lower court. Appealed cases generally originate from lawsuits or criminal indictments filed and tried before the trial courts. These decisions of the trial courts may then be elevated on appeal to the Court of Appeals, or more rarely, directly to the Supreme Court if only “questions of law” are involved. Apart from decisions of the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court may also directly review on appeal decisions rendered by the Sandiganbayan and the Court of Tax Appeals. Decisions rendered by administrative agencies are not directly appealable to the Supreme Court, they must be first challenged before the Court of Appeals. However, decisions of the Commission on Elections may be elevated directly for review to the Supreme Court, although the procedure is not, strictly speaking, {{in the nature of}} an appeal.|$|E

Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury also commented on Penry-Jones, saying that he [...] "proved to be just as good a spy in 1914 as he was in Spooks, only more dashing" [...] and Alison Graham of the Radio Times, in her 'pick of the day' piece, said that Penry-Jones is [...] "just perfect as John Buchan's hero" [...] and commented that Victoria (Leonard) was [...] "a splendid suffragette".

500|$|The {{effect on}} the German light tanks was catastrophic. Virtually every French weapon from 25mm upward {{penetrated}} the 7-13mm of the Panzer I. Although the Panzer II fared somewhat better, especially those that had been up-armoured since the Polish Campaign, their losses were high. Such was the sheer frustration of the crews of these light Panzers in [...] face of heavier armoured French machines that some resorted to desperate expedients. One account speaks of a German Panzer commander attempting to climb on a Hotchkiss H-35 with a hammer, presumably to smash the machine's periscopes, but falling off and being crushed by the tank's tracks. Certainly by day's end, Prioux had reason to claim that his tanks had come off best. The battlefield around Hannut was littered with knocked-out tanks–the bulk of which were German Panzers–with by <b>far</b> <b>and</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> bulk of them being Panzer Is and IIs.|$|E

500|$|Labor won {{the seats}} of Glenelg and Barossa at the 1965 election, {{after winning the}} seats of Chaffey and Unley at the 1962 election.

[...] Despite winning 55 percent of the primary vote, the Playmander was still strong enough that Labor won only 21 of 39 seats, a two-seat majority. Dunstan became Attorney-General and Minister of Community Welfare and Aboriginal Affairs. He was <b>far</b> <b>and</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> youngest member of the cabinet; he was the only minister under 50, and only one of three under 60. Dunstan had a major impact on Government policy as Attorney-General.

500|$|As {{a result}} of the debacle of the Jameson Raid in the winter of 1895–1896, the {{imperial}} government determined by order in council to appoint a permanent Resident Commissioner to supervise the affairs of the British South Africa Company in Southern Rhodesia. Joseph Chamberlain, Secretary of State for the Colonies, offered the role to Clarke, whose impressive prior administrative career was an indication of the importance being placed on the role. Graham Bower, the imperial secretary, wrote recommending him for the role: [...] "Clarke is <b>far</b> <b>and</b> <b>away</b> <b>the</b> best man in this country". Clarke was in post from 1898 to 1905, reporting directly to Alfred Milner, the High Commissioner for Southern Africa based in Johannesburg, who in turn reported to the Colonial Office in London. His role was to safeguard the interests of the natives and to call on the High Commissioner for interference where he saw fit. The Aborigines Protection Society in London approved of his appointment, stating in its annual report of 1900 that he had a [...] "rare capacity for dealing justly with native communities".|$|E
