40|$|Abstract This study {{reports on}} the {{performance}} assessment of Chinese airlines from 2006 to 2014 using a stochastic distance function where technical efficiency and a measure of flight delays follow a joint structural autoregressive process. This model is used to investigate whether technical efficiency causes <b>flight</b> <b>punctuality</b> or the other way around. The model, however, yields a non-trivial likelihood function and is not amenable to estimation using least squares or standard maximum likelihood techniques. To estimate the model therefore, we propose and implement maximum simulated likelihood with importance sampling. The results suggest a mutual dependence (feedback) between technical efficiency and delays. Policy implications are derived...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Aiming at {{improving}} the unreasonable situation of flight delay allocation, an optimization model which contains two cases was proposed. One {{of the cases}} is to transfer all the delay to several delayed flights to avoid delay spread, which can increase the <b>flight</b> <b>punctuality</b> rate to ensure {{the departure of the}} majority flights. Oppositely, the other is to balance the delay losses of airlines, as well as the passengers, for realizing the fairness. According to the latest data from an airport in western China, the model was verified with genetic algorithm, which indicates that the model not only decrease the total delay losses, but also optimize the flight delay allocation which achieves the initial goal...|$|E

Shiftwork {{disrupts the}} sleep-wake cycle, leading to sleepiness, fatigue, and performance impairment, with implications for occupational health and safety. Aircraft maintenance crews work a 24 -hour shift rotation and sustain <b>flight</b> <b>punctuality</b> rate of job stress. If an error occurs during the aircraft maintenance process, this error {{may become a}} potential risk factor for flight safety. This paper focuses on optimal work shift scheduling to reduce the fatigue of aircraft maintenance crews. We model fatigue as a dynamic system, and {{the objective is to}} find the optimal shift schedules that minimize the maximum fatigue values. Various constraints such as holidays, company and government regulations are included in our model. This optimization problem is formulated as a mixed-integer program, in which the shift assignments are described by 0 - 1 variables. We take a sample aircraft maintenance crews schedule to demonstrate the proposed methods...|$|E
40|$|Airport {{is a vital}} {{subsystem}} in the {{air transport}} system which has an important and strategic role in smoothening air traffic, so that an airport must be designed to be always ready in all situations and conditions to serve airline flights securely, orderly, smoothly, and quickly. The frequent delay faced by Indonesian domestic scheduled airlines is not fully caused by internal factor of the companies. Instead, it {{can be caused by}} the airport factor. The problems faced by airports in Indonesia which have impacts on the performance of <b>flight</b> <b>punctuality</b> among other things are capacity, slot time, quality of flight navigation devices, accessibility, professionalism of airport and ATC human resources, infrastructure, facilities, equipment, and the human resources handling security and safety of flights in airport. This article recommends that an in-depth study should be carried out to map the interrelations between the airport factor in the flight delay related to facilities integration and the airport authority in the flight activities in Indonesia...|$|E
40|$|A {{flight is}} said to be delayed when an airline flight takes off and/or lands later than its {{scheduled}} time. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) considers a flight to be delayed when it is 15 minutes later than its scheduled time. Punctuality {{is one of the key}} performance indicators in the airline industry and an important service differentiator especially for valuable high-yield customers. In addition, improved on-time performance can help achieve significant cost savings. This is a critical issue in the air transportation industry since it generates lot of problems to the operation and the inconvenience for the passengers. Once a delay is occurred it is totally affected to the entire airline network and it will totally effect to the passengers. Flight delays are an inconvenience to passengers. A delayed flight can be costly to passengers by making them late to their personal scheduled events. A passenger who is delayed on a multi-plane trip could miss a connecting flight. Anger and frustration can occur in delayed passengers. This publishes a postgraduate thesis carried out under the topic “Identification of possible reasons that affect departure flight punctuality” and this is carried out as a case study on the National Carrier of Sri Lanka. This mainly focuses on identification of departure flight delays, identifying critical delay types and finding their reasons and finally identifying areas to develop policies and regulations which can be optimize the departure <b>flight</b> <b>punctuality.</b> The findings of the preliminary analysis represents that out of average total departures per day there are 6 % of Technical delays, 9 % of Unavoidable delays, and 8 % of Airport delays and 5 % of Air Traffic Control delays. The average delay times per departure flight are 1. 22 hrs if Technical delays, 0. 34 hrs if Unavoidable delays, 0. 16 hrs if Airport delays and 0. 10 hrs if Air Traffic Control delays. During the secondary data analysis, some areas were identified as the areas that can be regularized using new policy and regulations or change and develop existing policy and regulations to increase the departure <b>flight</b> <b>punctuality.</b> Some of them are new policy or policy development on A/C rotation, regular and periodic maintenance that can reduce technical errors and failures, scheduled maintenance that will help to manage operation time. Further it is identified that unscheduled maintenance will increase the delay, internal QC and QA on safety and security is a must, policy on recruit maintenance professionals will help to manage emergencies, additional maintenance will reduce engine start up time delays, increasing maintenance will avoid equipment failures, new policy or policy development on intoxicated passengers will reduces delays, new policy on intoxicated passengers will reduces delays, internal organizational policy and regulations can mitigate late reporting and new policy for transfer passenger and baggage timings. Under this study, only the delay data were considered to identify the areas that reduces the departure <b>flight</b> <b>punctuality</b> and any culture, society and the environment of the country were not taken into account. But the factors such as economic, social, environmental and political situation of the country, management changes, joint agreements, code share agreements, aircraft fleet changes, and new governmental policy and regulations also should be considered for the development and the implementation of new policy statements regarding the flight departure delays...|$|E
40|$|Shift work {{disrupts}} the sleep-wake cycle, leading to sleepiness, fatigue, and performance impairment, with implications for occupational health and safety. For example, aircraft maintenance crew work a 24 -hour shift rotation under the job stress of sustaining the <b>flight</b> <b>punctuality</b> rate. If an error occurs during the aircraft maintenance process, this error {{may become a}} potential risk factor for flight safety. This paper focuses on optimal work shift scheduling to reduce the fatigue of shiftworkers. We proposed a conditional exponential mathematical model to represent the fatigue variation of workers. The fatigue model is integrated with the work shift scheduling problem with considerations of workers’ preferences of days off, company or government regulations, and manpower requirements. The combined problem is formulated as a mixed-integer program, in which the shift assignments are described by binary variables. Using the proposed method, {{we can find a}} feasible work shift schedule and also have a schedule that minimizes the peak fatigue of shiftworkers while satisfying their days off demands. Several examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|E
40|$|Dispatch {{reliability}} – {{is one of}} the {{key criteria}} of aircraft technical operation process efficiency which reflects economic efficiency of airline activity. The higher the operational reliability, the better the level of aircraft operation in airline, the higher maintenance quality and safety policy is more effective. Due to the lack of unified procedure of dispatch reliability control both for aircraft manufacturers and Russian Federation aircraft operators and based on international experience it was concluded that there is a need for dispatch reliability specification by introducing a number of parameters, definitions and development, thereby the unified updated methodic of calculation.  In this work six basic and three auxiliary parameters are introduced, the following terms and definitions are established: dispatch reliability, operational reliability, ground operational interruptions, operational interruptions, in-flight  interruptions. A unified actualized methodic of dispatch reliability and operational reliability calculation is developed, which is reasonable and more accurate. Since the aircraft dispatch reliability includes the notion of Regularity and Punctuality, definitions and criteria calculation are given.   The detailed example of criteria calculation is shown: dispatch reliability, dispatch regularity, <b>flight</b> <b>punctuality,</b> operational reliability, flight delays for a hundred landings, aircraft changes for a hundred landings, flight cancellations for a hundred landings...|$|E
