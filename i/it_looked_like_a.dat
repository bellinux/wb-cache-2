5|$|Simultaneously, work progressed on the Mosholu Parkway Extension, and Mosholu Avenue {{within the}} park was being {{modified}} {{so that it would}} be bisected by Henry Hudson Parkway. A bridge was constructed over the railroad in 1940, and a road linking the avenue and the new Mosholu Parkway was opened the next year. Mosholu Parkway was then extended to the Henry Hudson Parkway via a partial cloverleaf interchange built near the park's sole freshwater marsh. When biology teachers who used the marsh for their classes raised concerns about construction, an assistant to Moses said that the marsh would get a landscaping so that <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> series of lagoons surrounded by shrubbery.|$|E

Amid allegations of bribery, Hosokawa argued that the money was a loan and produced a receipt to show that he had paid it back; LDP members passed around a copy remarking that <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> sloppy fake.

25|$|This was {{the first}} major tournament he had led England into.

After beating Sri Lanka, England qualified for the semi-finals against New Zealand. Good death bowling from David Willey and Chris Jordan saw England restrict their opponents to 153–8, and they {{went on to win the}} match by seven wickets.

25|$|Kuchuk Tepe {{settlement}} in Bactria (today Uzbekistan) is {{also related to}} the Yaz I culture. <b>It</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> flattened circular hill with an area of 0.5 hectares and height 8 m. The structures were built on a clay platform surrounded by a defensive wall. At {{the end of the}} first period (10th to mid-8th centuries BCE) the building had twenty-five chambers; apparently it was a large fortified house, while towns start appearing in the region towards the end of that period. Other Bactrian well known sites with Yaz I ceramics are Tillya Tepe in northeastern Afghanistan, and Kyzyl Tepe, Dzharkutan, Kangurt-Tut, and Teguzak in Tajikistan. The single purely Yaz I site in Tajikistan is Karim-berdy which measures 500 x 300 m. Along the Kunduz River are located oasis Naibabad and Farukabad. The settlements at Bandykhan, between Shirabad and Denov in Uzbekistan, show Yaz I (14th-11th century BCE), Yaz II/A (10th-9th/8th century BCE), Yaz II/B (8th-7th/6th century BCE), and Yaz III (6th-4th century BCE).|$|E

25|$|Ricky Ponting {{chose to}} bat {{when he won}} the toss for the visiting Australian cricket team in an {{extremely}} tense and see-sawing match at The County Ground, Bristol. <b>It</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> great decision when Jon Lewis and Darren Gough were smashed about early on, as Australia made their way to 57 for 0 after 11 overs with Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden taking sixes off Lewis over midwicket. However, with the entrance of Steve Harmison, everything changed. In his third over – the 12th of the game, he removed Gilchrist with a bouncy ball that the batsman edged behind, then Ponting with a yorker that he didn't play at – resulting in lbw – then a dot ball, and then Martyn with a slog shot to Pietersen at third man. Australia tried to consolidate, but when Hayden tried to hit out off Harmison four overs later, Paul Collingwood jumped up to pick the ball out of the air with his right hand – a magnificent catch, and Australia had lost four wickets for six runs, reminiscent of their collapse in the Twenty20 match earlier on in the week.|$|E
25|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} 17 May 2004 and lasted six weeks. Arctor's house was located on Eric Circle in Southeast Austin. The previous tenants {{had left a}} month prior to filming and left the place {{in such a state}} that production designer Bruce Curtis had to make few modifications so that <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> run-down home. The filmmakers had looked at 60 houses before settling on this one. Linklater shot a lot of exteriors in Anaheim, California and then composited them into the Austin footage in post-production. Since the live action footage was to be animated over later, makeup, lighting and visible equipment, like boom mics, were less of a concern. However, cinematographer Shane Kelly carefully composed shots and used a color palette with the animators in mind. Sometimes, they would show up to tell Kelly what they needed. Because the movie was being shot digitally and then animated, occasionally actors forgot they would later be animated as they worked through a scene. Robert Downey, Jr. noted that he completely forgot the scene would later be animated as he worked through several takes in order to produce the smoke ring that would be featured in Barris' first closeup shot.|$|E
25|$|The {{first test}} {{was an instant}} classic. Australia made 428 in its first innings. Opening batsman Shane Watson scored a century and Wicket keeper Tim Paine made a 92 to lead the charge. In reply India's top order almost contributed equally with Sachin Tendulkar scoring 98 and Suresh Raina scoring 86. India made 405 in their first innings. Indian bowlers led a surge in the second Innings to rout Australia to 192. India were set a target of 216. Wickets started to fall in the evening of 4th day with Ben Hilfenhaus taking the key wickets of Gambhir, Sehwag and Raina. The score stood at 55/4 {{at the end of}} 4th day's Play with Tendulkar playing with night {{watchman}} Zaheer Khan. Australia started the 5th day well to remove Zaheer Khan first. VVS Laxman who played late down the order because of his back injury joined Tendulkar for the 6th wicket. They improved the scoring rate considerably. However Tendulkar was out for 38 trying to play an upper late cut off Bollinger. MS Dhoni then followed Tendulkar as he was run out following a confusion with Raina who was a by runner for VVS Laxman. The score stood at 122/7. Harbhajan too was out pretty quickly facing just 2 deliveries. It looked all but over for India. India were 124/8 with an injury-ridden VVS Laxman and Ishant sharma at the crease and only Pragyan Ojha to follow. India still needed 92 runs to win with just 2 wickets remaining at lunch. <b>It</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> lost cause to India.|$|E

500|$|Godesburg, a {{fortress}} {{a few kilometers}} from the Elector's capital city of Bonn, was taken by storm in late 1583after a brutal month-long siege; when Bavarian cannonades failed to break the bastions, sappers tunneled under the thick walls and blew up the fortifications from below. The Catholic Archbishop's forces still could not break through {{the remains of the}} fortifications, so they crawled through the garderobe sluices (hence the name, Sewer War). Upon taking the fortress, they killed every defender except three, a Captain of the Guard who could prove he was a citizen of Cologne, and the son of an important Cologne politician, the commander and his wife. The [...] of road between Godesberg and Bonn was filled with so many troops that <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> military camp.

Eurogamer's John Bye called the game [...] "curiously amusing" [...] {{and felt that}} kids would enjoy the game. IGN's Craig Harris noted that the game was surprisingly fun to play, and that the game would appeal to a unique niche in the video game market. He criticized it for failing to introduce the player {{to the point of}} the game, forcing the player {{to figure out how to}} play on their own. Allgame's Jay Semerad commented that the game provided a surprising amount of challenge, which increased the game's replayability. GameSpot's Frank Provo praised the game's visuals and sound effects, noting that they added to the experience of the game. He felt that the game was not as addictive as some other contemporary puzzle games, but he praised the game nonetheless. Bob Tedeschi of The New York Times commented that Toys 'R' Us had originally chosen to not distribute Hot Potato, but began to stock the game after <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> big seller.|$|E
