40|$|An {{integrated}} framework for assessing conservation and development {{changes at the}} scale of a large forest landscape in the Congo Basin is described. The framework allows stakeholders to assess progress in achieving the often conflicting objectives of alleviating poverty and conserving global environmental values. The study shows {{that there was little}} change in either livelihood or conservation indicators over the period 2006 to 2008, and that the activities of conservation organizations had only modest impacts on either. The global economic down-turn in 2008 had immediate negative consequences for both local livelihoods and for biodiversity as people lost their employment in the cash economy and reverted to illegal harvesting of forest products. Weakness of institutions, and corruption were the major obstacles to achieving either conservation or development objectives.

Among the inclusion criteria, the authors ruled out the presence of fatty liver disease by ultrasound sonography (US). 1 No consideration of serum aminotransferases were reported. Fatty liver disease, frequently associated to IR and MS, represents a spectrum of disorders ranging from simple steatosis that generally follows a benign and non-progressive clinical course to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, 2 which sometimes progresses to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. 3 This liver disease is either discovered incidentally during laboratory examination, or workup of hypertension, diabetes, or morbid obesity. 2 Limitations of US, as a diagnostic approach include an 83 % sensitivity, in other terms, the false negative results amount to 17 %. 2 Hence, in order to select a population without fatty liver disease, {{it would be more}} accurate to include also the serum aminotransferases dosage.

Moreover, Cho and Kim in [36] studied a more general non-isentropic incompressible Navier-Stokes system, where the transport coefficients depend on both temperature and mass density. The authors established the local existence and uniqueness of strong solution; see also [37]. For the compressible cases, there are many articles on the global existence of unique classical solution with large initial data for one-dimensional problems; see [38 – 41] for examples.|$|R
