40|$|AbstractMetal {{complexation}} and tandem {{mass spectrometry}} {{were used to}} differentiate C- and O-bonded <b>flavonoid</b> monoglucoside isomers. Electrospray ionization of solutions containing a <b>flavonoid</b> glycoside and a metal salt led to the generation of the key [M(II) (L) (L-H) ]+ complexes, where M is the metal ion and L is the <b>flavonoid</b> glycoside. Thirteen <b>flavonoid</b> monoglucosides were examined in combination with Ca(II), Mg(II), Co(II), Ni(II), and Cu(II). Collisional activated dissociation (CAD) of the [M(II) (L) (L-H) ]+ complexes resulted in diagnostic mass spectra, {{in contrast to the}} CAD mass spectra of the protonated, deprotonated, and sodium-cationized <b>flavonoid</b> glucosides. Five common sites of glycosylation could be predicted based on the fragmentation patterns of the <b>flavonoid</b> glucoside/magnesium complexes, while <b>flavonoid</b> glucoside/calcium complexes also were effective for location of the glycosylation site when MS 3 was employed. Cobalt, nickel and copper complexation had only limited success in this application. The metal complexation methods were also applied for characterization of a <b>flavonoid</b> rhamnoside, and the dissociation pathways of the metal complexes indicate that <b>flavonoid</b> rhamnosides have distinctive dissociation features from <b>flavonoid</b> glucosides...|$|R

Objectives: To estimate dietary total <b>flavonoid</b> intake and intake of <b>flavonoid</b> subclasses in older adults with Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s type dementia and assess the relationship of <b>flavonoid</b> intake with measures of cognition. Design: Cross sectional analysis. Setting: Community dwelling older adults in NSW, Australia. Participants: Older adults (+ 65 y) with mild to moderate dementia (n= 49). Measurements: A 24 h diet recall was collected with help from a carer and used to estimate <b>flavonoid</b> intake.

5|$|Phenolics, {{sometimes}} called phenols, consist of an aromatic 6-carbon ring bonded to a hydroxy group. Some phenols have antiseptic properties, while others disrupt endocrine activity. Phenolics range from simple tannins {{to the more}} complex <b>flavonoids</b> that give plants much of their red, blue, yellow, and white pigments. Complex phenolics called polyphenols are capable of producing {{many different types of}} effects on humans, including antioxidant properties. Some examples of phenolics used for defense in plants are: lignin, silymarin and cannabinoids. Condensed tannins, polymers composed of 2 to 50 (or more) flavonoid molecules, inhibit herbivore digestion by binding to consumed plant proteins and making them more difficult for animals to digest, and by interfering with protein absorption and digestive enzymes.|$|E
