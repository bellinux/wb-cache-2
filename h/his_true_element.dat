6000|$|Seventeen or {{eighteen}} {{centuries ago}} this Coliseum was the theatre of Rome, and Rome was {{mistress of the}} world. Splendid pageants were exhibited here, in presence of the Emperor, the great ministers of State, the nobles, and vast audiences of citizens of smaller consequence. Gladiators fought with gladiators and at times with warrior prisoners from many a distant land. It was the theatre of Rome--of the world--and the man of fashion who could not let fall in a casual and unintentional manner something about [...] "my private box at the Coliseum" [...] could not move in the first circles. When the clothing-store merchant wished to consume the corner grocery man with envy, he bought secured seats {{in the front row}} and let the thing be known. When the irresistible dry goods clerk wished to blight and destroy, according to his native instinct, he got himself up regardless of expense and took some other fellow's young lady to the Coliseum, and then accented the affront by cramming her with ice cream between the acts, or by approaching the cage and stirring up the martyrs with his whalebone cane for her edification. The Roman swell was in <b>his</b> <b>true</b> <b>element</b> only when he stood up against a pillar and fingered his moustache unconscious of the ladies; when he viewed the bloody combats through an opera-glass two inches long; when he excited the envy of provincials by criticisms which showed that he had been to the Coliseum many and many a time and was long ago over the novelty of it; when he turned away with a yawn at last and said, ...|$|E
60|$|When {{he looked}} back at his year of court and camp, he could only marvel at having ever {{preferred}} them. In war his want of bodily strength would make real distinction impossible; here he felt himself excelling; here was absolute enjoyment, and of a kind without drawback. Scholarship must be <b>his</b> <b>true</b> <b>element</b> and study: the deep universal study of the sisterhood of science that the University offered was his veritable vocation. Surely it was not without significance that the ring that shone on his finger betrothed him to Esclairmonde, the Light of the World; for though in person the maiden was never to be his own, she was the emblem to him of the pure virgin light of truth and wisdom that he would be for ever wooing, and winning only to see further lights beyond. Human nature felt a pang at the knowledge that he was bound to deliver up the ring and resign his connection with that fair and stately maiden; but the pain that had been sore at first had diminished under the sense that he stood in a post of generous trust, and that his sacrifice was the passport to her grateful esteem. He knew her to be with Lady Montagu, awaiting a vacancy at St. Katharine's, and this would be the signal for dissolving the contract of marriage, after which his present vision was to bestow Lilias upon Patrick, make over his estates to them, take minor orders, and set forth for Italy, there to pursue those deeper studies in theology and language for which Padua and Bologna were famous. It was many months since he had heard of Lilias; but this did not give him any great uneasiness, for messengers were few, and letter-writing far from being a common practice. He had himself written at every turning-point of his life, and sent his letters when the King communicated with Scotland; but from his sister he had heard nothing.|$|E
50|$|The {{show at the}} Lower Room was {{a pivotal}} show in Jonathan’s career. The sculptures {{represent}} the passion Jonathan has for sculpture, and <b>his</b> <b>true</b> skill. Each <b>element</b> was given space to stand alone, but together the exhibition was haunting. A true theatre production. Jonathan lectured on art history and taught sculpture throughout his career. In the late 1960's he taught at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. He taught at Parsons School of Design from 1983-84. At {{the time of his}} death, he was teaching at both Montclair State College in New Jersey, where he had been an assistant professor of fine arts since 1970, and the New York Studio School.|$|R

6000|$|... "Fancied's {{the very}} word {{to use in}} this connection," [...] I observed, remembering the subtly {{provisional}} character of Marlow's long sojourn amongst us. From year to year he dwelt on land as a bird rests on the branch of a tree, so tense {{with the power of}} brusque flight into its <b>true</b> <b>element</b> that it is incomprehensible why it should sit still minute after minute. The sea is the sailor's <b>true</b> <b>element,</b> and Marlow, lingering on shore, was to me an object of incredulous commiseration like a bird, which, secretly, should have lost its faith in the high virtue of flying.|$|R
60|$|Though {{the author}} {{of some of the}} most {{tremendous}} and far-sounding phrases of an epoch that was only too rich in them, yet phrases had no empire over him; he was their master, not their dupe. Of all the men who succeeded Mirabeau as directors of the unchained forces, we feel that Danton alone was in <b>his</b> <b>true</b> <b>element.</b> Action, which poisoned the blood of such men as Robespierre, and drove such men as Vergniaud out of their senses with exaltation, was to Danton his native sphere. When France was for a moment discouraged, it was he who nerved her to new effort by the electrifying cry, 'We must dare, and again dare, and without end dare!' If his rivals or his friends seemed too intent on trifles, too apt to confound side issues with the central aim of the battle, Danton was ever ready to urge them to take a juster measure:--'When the edifice is all ablaze, I take little heed of the knaves who are pilfering the household goods; I rush to put out the flames.' When base egoism was compromising a cause more priceless than the personality of any man, it was Danton who made them ashamed by the soul-inspiring exclamation, 'Let my name be blotted out and my memory perish, if only France may be free.' The Girondins denounced the popular clubs of Paris as hives of lawlessness and outrage. Danton warned them that it were wiser to go to these seething societies and to guide them, than to waste breath in futile denunciation. 'A nation in revolution,' he cried to them, in a superb figure, 'is like the bronze boiling and foaming and purifying itself in the cauldron. Not yet is the statue of Liberty cast. Fiercely boils the metal; have an eye on the furnace, or the flame will surely scorch you.' If there was murderous work below the hatches, that was all the more reason why the steersman should keep his hand strong and ready on the wheel, with an eye quick for each new drift in the hurricane, and each new set in the raging currents. This is ever the figure under which one conceives Danton--a Titanic shape doing battle with the fury of the seas, yielding while flood upon flood sweeps wildly over him, and then with unshaken foothold and undaunted front once more surveying the waste of waters, and striving with dexterous energy to force the straining vessel over the waters of the bar.|$|E
5000|$|Working in a grocer's shop in Leigh, {{his home}} town, he was spotted by Ronnie Taylor ({{scriptwriter}}), a BBC scriptwriter and producer who {{asked him to}} audition in July 1950. As a result, from early the next year, Platt became the resident comedian on the BBC's popular radio show Variety Fanfare, which made him a household name. It was on radio that Platt was in <b>his</b> <b>true</b> <b>element</b> with his immaculate timing and brilliant ad-libbing. With a flat cap and droll line, he was best remembered by the catchphrase with which he began every performance: [...] "Allo, I won't take me coat off - I'm not stoppin'!"

This proves effective, but not as Blackbeard expected; Underhill proves to be the dragon who stole the {{treasure}} of Pendor, and so <b>his</b> <b>true</b> form is the dragon. Yevaud devours Blackbeard. Birt flees the island, taking his love Palani with him.

With the amount of blood he is allowed to take (1cc, a number set by Kyoji) he can only turn into <b>his</b> <b>true</b> form for about 5 minutes. However, after smelling a perfume created by Kyoji, made from Tonae's blood, he can turn into <b>his</b> <b>true</b> form. However, the perfume has a delayed reaction, so he can never know when the transformation will happen, or what side effects can occur. One major side effect of the perfume is that, every full moon, Guilt-na-Zan changes back to <b>his</b> <b>true</b> form for that night, until the moon sets but he will only have the same powers as he does {{in the form of}} the doll only being able to create flowers and candy.|$|R
