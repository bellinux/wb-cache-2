40|$|Changes in the {{direction}} of the dominant axis from North-South to East-West reflects changes in the dominant social discourse of the city. The situation shifts from pre-modern to modern; the city of Hvar ceases to be a self-sufficient medieval commune, and becomes part of a larger whole, which emerges owing to the expansion of Venice to Otranto. Changes in the urban stratification are noticeable in the context of changes in the function of a free empty space that used to divide Groda from its suburb Burak. This previously empty space is transformed into a dominant urban axis around which there is a concentration of important social and architectural landmarks.

Then the critical re-gions of seven statistical tests are evaluated within each of these models. The uncorrected Pearson s Chi-Square test and Upton's correction {{are found to be}} overly liberal in all three models, particularly for the hyper <b>geometric.</b> A <b>continuity</b> correction, when properly applied, is shown to be an extremely good approximation to Fisher's Exact test, which employs the hypergeo-metric distribution to evaluate outcome probabilities—but is an extremely conservative approximation to the double binomial and multinomial mod-els. Haber's test is recommended for these two cases, but the amount of work required may be prohibitive for many investigators. Despite the long, extensive literature {{on the use of the}} chi-square test of independence in 2 x 2 contingency tables, the argument as to the appropri-ateness of a continuity correction continues (e. g., Yates, 1984).

50|$|The {{basic idea}} behind <b>geometric</b> <b>continuity</b> {{was that the}} five conic {{sections}} were really five {{different versions of the}} same shape. An ellipse tends to a circle as the eccentricity approaches zero, or to a parabola as it approaches one; and a hyperbola tends to a parabola as the eccentricity drops toward one; it can also tend to intersecting lines. Thus, there was continuity between the conic sections. These ideas led to other concepts of continuity. For instance, if a circle and a straight line were two expressions of the same shape, perhaps a line could {{be thought of as a}} circle of infinite radius. For such to be the case, one would have to make the line closed by allowing the point x = ∞ to be a point on the circle, and for x = +∞ and x = −∞ to be identical. Such ideas were useful in crafting the modern, algebraically defined, idea of the continuity of a function and of ∞.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a new {{efficient}} globallocal higher-order {{model is}} {{proposed for the}} thermoelastic analysis of laminated composite and sandwich plates. The proposed model takes into account explicitly the contribution of thermal expansion in the transverse displacement component. To satisfy the transverse displacement continuity along the thickness direction, the continuity condition of transverse displacement at interfaces, which is not satisfied in many other schemes, has been a priori enforced. This model fully satisfies the free surface conditions and the <b>geometric</b> and stress <b>continuity</b> conditions at interfaces. As the number of variables of the proposed model is independent {{of the number of}} layers of laminates, compared to the 1, 23 theory proposed by Li and Liu (1997) [20], the present model offers some significant improvements, and is able to predict accurately thermoelastic response of laminated plates under uniform temperature without a corresponding {{increase in the number of}} unknowns. The governing equations of equilibrium are derived by means of the principle of virtual displacements involving the thermal strain field. Applying Navier's technique, analytical solutions in terms of a double trigonometric series for simply supported laminated plates are presented. Results of benchmark examples are compared with the three-dimensional thermoelastic solutions as well as other published works. Numerical results show that the proposed model is more rigorous and can better predict the thermoelastic response in comparison with the 1, 23 theory and other two-dimensional models. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The Virtual Styling {{prototype}} system SmartSketches {{addresses the}} issue of controlled surface transmissions by realizing a set of continuity constrains allowing both to apply a <b>geometric</b> or parametric <b>continuity</b> constraint {{to a set of}} existing and adjacent NURBS surfaces and to generate adjacent NURBS surfaces constrained during interaction to fulfill a continuity condition. The task of the diploma thesis has been two-fold. Firstly, the work proposes an efficient constraint graph to capture and maintain continuity conditions between adjacent freeform surfaces (shapes). Secondly, strategies have been developed to build a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) for freeform surface continuity problems. Seven different cases to be considered have been identified. Main strategy in building the CSP is to group all sets of shapes that are interrelated with the same type of continuity constraint within one part. The reasons therefore are that on the one hand SmartSketches provides an efficient implementation of deforming a set of adjacent NURBS surfaces according to a specific continuity condition at once. On the other hand it corresponds to a manufacturing view on a model that surfaces build in one part are of a certain consistent internal continuity, e. g. C 1 or C 2 {{depending on the type of}} manufacturing process. Based on this rule the seven cases distinguish between the situations when shapes are merged to parts, when shape relations define inter-part relations, and the case of non-realizable continuity conditions that are in conflict with previously defined continuity constraints on the model...|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of higher order theories for laminated composite plate {{are that the}} number of unknowns are independent of the number of layers. However, they are unable to predict accurately the inter-element stresses and are also unsuitable for laminated plates with a large number of layers. Based on the third-order global - 1, 2 - 3 order local higher order theory proposed by Li and Liu [Li XiaoYu and Liu D. Generalized laminate theories based on double superposition hypothesis. Int. J. Numer. Meth. Eng., 1997; 40 : 1197 - 1212], which can predict accurately the interlaminar stresses, we propose an augmented higher order global-local theory for laminated composite plates and using it to estimate the applicability to the range of number of layers. The displacement field is composed of a mth-order (9 > m > 3) polynomial of global coordinate z in the thickness direction and 1, 2 - 3 order power series of local coordinate ζ k in the thickness direction of each layer. This theory can satisfy the free surface conditions and the <b>geometric</b> and stress <b>continuity</b> conditions at interfaces, and the number of unknowns is independent of the layer numbers of the laminate. Based on this higher order theory, a refined three-node triangular element satisfying the requirement of C 1 weak-continuity is presented. Numerical results show that the proposed higher order global-local theory can predict accurately in-plane stresses and transverse shear stresses from the constitutive equations, and it is still effective when the number of layers in laminated plates is more than five and up to 14. It is also shown that the present refined triangular element possesses higher accuracy compared with known elements. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The Flying V, {{a concept}} {{aircraft}} configuration, {{has been proposed}} by Airbus and TU Berlin. The initial indications of potential improvements in performance over conventional aircraft {{gave rise to a}} continuation of the research. For this, the mass characteristics of the configuration must be explored. A primary structure concept is conceived based on expected load paths. The original dual-tube fuselage configuration is replaced with an oval cabin concept, in which various constant-curvature arcs are adjoined. Residual forces at their connection are carried by straight members. A parametrisation is set up, for which both aerodynamic and structure concept considerations are taken into account. A CAD model for the structure concept is generated in ParaPy, a KBE framework with CAD integration and coupling to various aerodynamic and structure analysis tools. A numerical sizing method is selected due to the complexity of the airframe geometry. A model generatoris developed in ParaPy, a KBE-framework with integration of a meshing algorithm and coupling to aerodynamic and structural analysis tools. A CAD model is obtained from the model generator using a mission parameter set similar to that of an Airbus A 350. The model is meshed using the SALOME algorithm for a finite element analysis. The mesh is exported to Patran for a Nastran analysis. Between ParaPy and Patran, mesh element IDs are altered. This disables a feedback-enabled design loop. Analysis results cannot be interpreted in ParaPy. Automated design is foregone. Patran mesh verification highlights critical and non-critical mesh errors due to the chosen geometry generation procedure. The flawed elements are redefined manually. Point and distributed loads are applied. Aerodynamic loads are obtained from Airbus’ LatticeBeta full-potential 3 D panel method. Uniform material properties are assigned. Due to the thin-shelled nature of the model, out-of-plane element bending stiffness is low. Excessive deformations are observed under transverse load application and in-plane panel compression. A bending stiffness correction is applied. The model is sized for material failure and local buckling by Airbus’ in-house structure sizing tool ZORRO. A validation is set up using outboard wing cross-sections. These are sized using analytical relations given the numerical procedure loads. From this it is concluded individual regions can only be assessed qualitatively due to the bending stiffness correction applied in the numerical model. Wrongly designed structure regions and load path propagation can be interpreted. Quantitative results are not omitted from the result interpretation. An unforeseen load path is identified in the wing transition between the outboard wing front spar and root plane trailing edge. The integration of tapered fuselage within the wing transition is feasible, although the fuselage attracts more loads than anticipated. The fuselage transition behaves as expected. Integration of the oval cabin concept into a the Flying V configuration is shown to be feasible and beneficial to volume efficiency and planform design flexibility. However, the existing implementation of the cabin concept must be altered for better adaptation in existing regulations. The assumed static stability as optimised for by Faggiano shows large discrepancy with respect to the determined static margin. Part of this is caused by the incorrect quantitative sizing results. However, it is expected that the aerodynamic profile may be significantly altered in a multi-disciplinary design procedure. In order to obtain a correct mass estimation, a new model generation procedure is recommended in detail. This takes multiple facets into account. <b>Geometric</b> model <b>continuity</b> is ensured. A straightforward implementation of stiffener elements is enabled by introducing a foundation for this on the top-level fuselage model definition. This also adds more possibilities for designing the aft half of an aerodynamic profile for the fuselage section of the planform. Feasible design automation consequently enables multidisciplinary optimisation. The main hurdles to overcome towards realising design automation are development of a complete model generator, further development of ParaPy ’s geometry generation and Nastran coupling functionalities and feedback between analysis results and model generation. Realising these aspects in future research will finally allow solid conclusions regarding the Flying V performance to be drawn. Flying V Researc...|$|R

A brief historical and architectural description of the evolution of the tightly correlated structure to the historical-cultural vicissitudes, to the advancement of the scientific theories and to the innovation of the tools of observation and of survey, is a deepening of knowledge for the conservation and safeguard of the architectural testimony. The transformations of the underlying Torre Pisana, which developed over a period of almost nine centuries, are closely related with the ancient Palazzo Reale, that today is a precious architectural palimpsest, a witness to the historical vicissitudes of the city of Palermo. The history of the most salient changes of the turreted palace and especially of the tower, which will host the Astronomical Observatory during the eighteenth century, through the testimonies written of researchers, {{brings us back to the}} VI-V century a. C, when, in the highest point of punic Panormo, a military structure was built to defend the western wall of ancient urban settlement. The inside spatial medieval conception of tower’s places is found in setting perfectly centric. The cubic central nucleus is divided in height by the two main areas: the Sala del Tesoro and the Sala del Trono dedicated to real audiences.
