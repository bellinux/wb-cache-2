In this {{paper we propose a}} new composition method for constructing protocols based on existing ones found in the literature that can be <b>fully</b> <b>automatized.</b> The additive properties of the composed protocols are ensured by the composition of protocol preconditions and effects, denoting, respectively, the conditions that must hold for protocols to be executed and the conditions that hold after executing the protocols.

30|$|Generating MR-based {{attenuation}} correction map (μ-map) for quantitative {{reconstruction of}} PET images still remains {{a challenge in}} hybrid PET/MRI systems, mainly because cortical bone structures are indistinguishable from proximal air cavities in conventional MR images. Recently, development of short echo-time (STE) MR imaging sequences, has shown promise in differentiating cortical bone from air. However, on STE-MR images, the bone appears with discontinuous boundaries. Therefore, segmentation techniques based on intensity classification, such as thresholding or fuzzy C-means, fail to homogeneously delineate bone boundaries, especially {{in the presence of}} intrinsic noise and intensity inhomogeneity.
