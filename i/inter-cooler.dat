40|$|This thesis work {{presents}} {{an evaluation of}} various processes for reducing CO 2 emissions from natural-gas-fired combined cycle (NGCC) power plants. The scope of the thesis is to focus mainly on post-combustion chemical absorption for NGCC. For the post-combustion capture plant, an important interface is the steam extraction from the steam turbine in order to supply the heat for solvent regeneration. The steam extraction imposes a power production penalty. The thesis includes analysis and comparison between several chemical absorption processes configurations integrated with NGCC. The objectives of the present work were to use thermodynamic analysis on various chemical absorption process configurations to evaluate, quantify and justify improved design of NGCC with post-combustion CO 2 capture. The thermodynamic evaluation of the processes gave insight to the detailed distribution of process irreversibilities and supports the state-of-the-art process configuration with the lowest energy penalty due to addition of CO 2 capture to the power plant. The reference power plant without CO 2 capture has a power production of 384 MW and a net electric efficiency of 56. 4 % (LHV) with CO 2 emissions of ≈ 362 g CO 2 / net kWh electricity. The power plant design was carried out using the computational tool GTPRO. The aim of the CO 2 capture plant was to remove 90 % of the CO 2 emissions present in the flue gas. To assess and analyse the various chemical absorption process configurations, the UniSim Design software was used, which contains the Amines Property Package. This special property package {{has been designed to}} aid the modelling of alkanolamine treating units in which CO 2 is removed from gaseous streams. The downstream compression of the captured CO 2 was also simulated using UniSim Design. The investigated process configurations were comprised of chemical absorption process with absorber <b>inter-cooling,</b> split-flow process and lean vapour recompression (LVR) process. Several design parameters were modified for each of the process configurations to achieve low energy consumption and consequently low work demand. The <b>inter-cooling</b> of the absorber column led to increased solvent rich loading. Consequently, the solvent circulation rate and reboiler energy requirement was decreased. In the split-flow configuration, due to splitting of the rich solvent into two streams, the amount of rich solvent entering the bottom section of the stripper was reduced. Therefore, less reboiler energy was required to remove CO 2 from the solvent to reach the same solvent lean loading as of the reference chemical absorption process. In the configuration with lean vapour recompression (LVR), the lean solvent stream was utilised as a low temperature heat source in order to add exergy input in the form of steam to the stripper column and thus reduce the reboiler duty. The reboiler duty for the CO 2 capture was decreased from 3. 74 MJ/kgCO 2 in the reference chemical absorption process to 2. 71 MJ/kgCO 2 for the case of LVR with absorber <b>inter-cooling.</b> The net electric efficiency of the reference process with CO 2 capture was calculated to 49. 5 % (LHV). With the improved process design, the highest net power plant efficiency was calculated to 50. 2 % (LHV) for the case of LVR with absorber <b>inter-cooling.</b> Moreover, exergy analysis was performed to identify the irreversibilities associated with the integration of power plant with various CO 2 capture and compression processes. Particularly, the second law of thermodynamics was used as a tool to evaluate and quantify the reduction of energy penalty associated with CO 2 capture for each process modification. Defining the work input for a theoretical reversible CO 2 capture process as the minimum required work was functional step in characterising the difference of the work input of theoretical reversible processes and the real irreversible processes. Exergy efficiency of the reference chemical absorption process was calculated to 21. 3 % versus 25 % for the case of LVR with absorber <b>inter-cooling.</b> Through exergy balance for every CO 2 capture process configuration, the exchange of exergy content of material and energy streams was assessed. Using the combination of power plant efficiency and exergy analysis as tools, a pre-combustion reforming combined cycle (IRCC) process with chemical absorption CO 2 capture process was investigated. A rational efficiency of 43. 8 % was achieved, which indicates the share of input exergy utilised for work production by the power cycle in addition to the exergy of the pure compressed CO 2 stream. The highest amount of irreversibility was contributed by the gas turbine and mainly by the combustor. The irreversibility which is inherent in the combustion process corresponded to a large fraction of original exergy of the fuel. This could be partially compensated by increase the preheating of the fuel supplied to the combustor. Also preheating the inlet streams to auto-thermal reactor (ATR) was found advantageous in decreasing the ATR irreversibilities.

In order to respond to this challenge, nuclear technology is designing a new generation of power plants termed Generation IV, among them high temperature gascooled reactors stand out for their potential capability to achieve an excellent thermal performance. This paper investigates the thermal and economic performance of several direct Brayton cycle configurations {{that could be used in}} future HTGRs, with special attention to the effects of <b>inter-cooling</b> and reheating. Among the hypotheses and assumptions taken, the adoption of the PBMR reactor parameters and settings as a reference is particularly important. All inter-cooled layouts have shown thermal efficiencies near or even higher than 50 %, which means a substantial improvement with respect to non-intercooled baselines with no economic penalties. Reheating has been shown not to affect remarkably the thermal or economic plant performance under base-load operation, but it provides the plant with such a flexibility that allows its operation under the load-follow regime without heavily taxing the thermal or economic performance.

The methods used are numerical, using full viscous 3 D computational fluid dynamics with heat transfer. Three cases were considered, an adiabatic wall baseline, an all-blade cooling at 293 K and a more realistic stator row cooling at 293 K. Results indicate an apparent yet erroneous isentropic efficiency reading increase beyond 100 % - which was to be expected due to the fluid cooling. However the isentropic and polytropic efficiencies could be estimated and were used to more accurately assess the performance of the compressor. Power consumption decreased to approximately 97 % of the original load while the pressure ratio was marginally increased. This alone does not, however, explain the non-physical efficiency readings, which are mainly due to the assumptions and manner under which the efficiency itself is calculated.

This study analyzes the behavior and the performance of a photovoltaic power system that, integrated with an adiabatic CAES (compressed air energy storage) unit, supplies electric power to a small scale off-grid BTS (base transceiver station) using only a renewable resource. The adiabatic condition of the CAES system is assured by realizing a TES (thermal energy storage) unit that recovers the heat from the <b>inter-cooling</b> compression for satisfying the inter-heating expansion without using additional fossil fuels. The power system is also designed to obtain a cooling effect from the cold air (3 C) at the outlet of the turbine, useful for the refrigeration of the telecommunications equipment. The aim {{of this study is to}} assess the optimal plant operating parameters, in terms of average storage pressure and operating pressure range of the air tank, considering the plant installation in three different climatic zones. The analysis has been carried out by introducing some performance parameters such as the system storage efficiency, the energy supply factor and the cooling supply factor. Results have highlighted that the best performance can be obtained by choosing both the lowest average pressure and the highest operating pressure range of the air tank...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- The paper {{analyzes}} the close-circuit Brayton (Joule) cycles for High Temperature Gas (Helium) cooled nuclear Reactors (HTGR). Analyzed cycles are with Regenerative Heat Exchanger (RHE), Fragmented Compression and <b>Inter-Cooling</b> (FC&IC). The HTGR imposes the working agent and hot source’s parameters. The cooling conditions give the cycle’s minimal temperature. In the 1 st paper’s section, for ideal processes cycles, we show that: A) the boundary parameters and design schemes inflict: A 1) the compression ratios (ε), A 2) the specific net work per 1 kg He (wnet), and A 3) the thermal efficiencies (ηth); B) the performances are increasing with the IC’s number. In the 2 nd section {{we are taking}} into consideration the irreversibility’s factors (temperature difference at RHE, revolving machines isentropic efficiencies, and pressure drops) doing sensitivity analyses about their influences on real processes cycle’s performances. We show that: 1) cycle’s performances are not continuous growing with IC’s number, and 2) the main influences on design’s option are given by: 21) the temperature difference at RHE and 22) the pressure drops. In the 3 rd section we adjusted all the quality factors in a similar manner, reducing the irreversibilities, showing the synergic influences. The 4 th section relaxes the hot source’s restrictions. It analyses the influence of HTGR output / input temperatures variation on the main thermodynamic data, showing: α) the benefit of maximal temperature increase and β) the need to correlate HTGR’s temperature increment output vs. input with the maximal temperature. The final section contains the main conclusions of the paper...|$|R
