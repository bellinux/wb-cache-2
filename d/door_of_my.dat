2500|$|In 2004 author Naomi Wolf {{wrote an}} article for New York Magazine accusing Harold Bloom of a sexual [...] "encroachment" [...] {{more than two decades}} earlier, by {{touching}} her thigh. She said that what she alleged Bloom did was not harassment, either legally or emotionally, and she did not think herself a [...] "victim", but that she had harbored this secret for 21 years. Explaining why she had finally gone public with the charges, Wolf wrote, [...] "I began, nearly a year ago, to try—privately—to start a conversation with my alma mater that would reassure me that steps had been taken in the ensuing years to ensure that unwanted sexual advances of this sort weren't still occurring. I expected Yale to be responsive. After nine months and many calls and e-mails, I was shocked to conclude that the atmosphere of collusion that had helped to keep me quiet twenty years ago was still intact—as secretive as a Masonic lodge." [...] When asked about the allegations in 2015, Bloom stated, [...] "I refuse to even use the name of this person. I call her Dracula's daughter, because her father was a Dracula scholar. I have never in my life been indoors with Dracula's daughter. When she came to the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> house unbidden, my youngest son turned her away. Once, I was walking up to campus, and she fell in with me and said, 'May I walk with you, Professor Bloom?' I said nothing." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{had reached}} the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> house. I paused and turned to him.|$|E
60|$|The cab pulled up. I ran up {{the stairs}} and opened the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> apartment.|$|E

6000|$|... "The <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> house!" [...] {{answered}} the Fleming--"do I {{know how long}} I may call that, or any house upon earth, my own? Alas, my daughter, we came hither to fly from the rage of the elements, but who knows how soon we may perish by the wrath of men!" ...|$|R
60|$|Ray nodded abruptly, and I {{heard the}} <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> cottage {{open and close}} behind him.|$|E
60|$|I {{answered}} him incongruously. We went below, and he wished me good-night at the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> cabin.|$|E
60|$|At the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> lodgings I {{was confronted}} by Banks, red with indignation and fidgety from uneasiness.|$|E
6000|$|... "It rather {{remains for}} you to prove your charges," [...] said the old man. [...] "I am a {{stranger}} and a sojourner in the land, and know no one out <b>of</b> the <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> dwelling. I can give nothing in my vindication but the word of a nobleman and a Castilian." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I," [...] said Sir Geoffrey, [...] "know, {{that between}} the <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> father's house and the gates of hell, there steps not such a villain on the ground! And if I wish my hands ever to be unbound again, it is because I hope for one downright blow at a grey head, that has hatched more treason than the whole Long Parliament." ...|$|R
60|$|She followed, and {{snatched}} the <b>door</b> out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> hand; she closed it, and pointed {{back to the}} place that I had left.|$|R
60|$|When all {{was quiet}} in the house, I stole out into the passage and listened at the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> father's room.|$|E
60|$|June 17th.--Just as my {{hand was}} on the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> room, I heard Sir Percival's voice calling to me from below.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's Georgie's fault," [...] replied Mrs. Rindge; [...] "he's been {{standing}} in the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> sitting-room for a whole half-hour talking nonsense." ...|$|E
5000|$|Ethelbert William Bullinger, {{looks at}} the word [...] "and" [...] in Jephthah's vow (Judges 11:31: [...] "whatever comes out <b>of</b> the <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> house to meet me, when I return in peace from the people of Ammon, shall surely be the Lord's, and I will offer it up as a burnt offering"). As he {{explains}} [...] the Hebrew prefix [...] "ו" [...] that is translated in the above passage as [...] "and" [...] is often used as a disjunctive, and means [...] "or", {{when there is a}} second proposition. Indeed, this rendering is suggested in the margin of the A. V. Bullinger goes on to give examples from the Bible where the same word has been translated as [...] "or". According to him, the right translation of this passage is: [...] "whatever comes out <b>of</b> the <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> house to meet me, when I return in peace from the people of Ammon, shall surely be the Lord's, or I will offer it up as a burnt offering." [...] Jephthah's daughter, being the first {{that came out of the}} house, was thus, according to Bullinger, dedicated to God. He also says: ...|$|R
60|$|I dashed back, {{leaped to}} the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> the arbor, <b>my</b> {{hand on my}} gun.|$|R
2500|$|Judges chapter 11 {{features}} a Judge named Jephthah vowing that [...] "whatsoever cometh {{forth from the}} <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> house to meet me shall surely be the Lord's, and I will offer it up as a burnt-offering" [...] in gratitude for God's help with a military battle against the Ammonites. Much to Jephthah's dismay, his only daughter greeted him upon his triumphant return. Judges 11:39 states that Jephthah did as he had vowed, but [...] "shies away from explicitly depicting her sacrifice, which leads some ancient and modern interpreters (e.g., Radak) to suggest {{that she was not}} actually killed." ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{a little}} after five o'clock when I once more turned {{the key in the}} outer <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> rooms in the Rue Daunou.|$|E
60|$|Then {{the three}} of them started, and {{arriving}} at the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> house, which was about a hundred yards away, were of course challenged by the sentries.|$|E
6000|$|I {{was awakened}} at about nine o'clock {{the next morning}} by a loud and {{persistent}} knocking at the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> room. I {{sat up in bed}} and shouted, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You thwarted them in this. Then they concocted {{the scheme}} whereby my {{reputation}} {{was to be}} the price, instead of the count's. When Paulvitch entered my cabin he explained it to me. If I would obtain the information for them he promised to go no farther, otherwise Rokoff, who stood without, was to notify the purser that I was entertaining a man other than my husband behind the locked <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> cabin. He was to tell every one he met on the boat, and when we landed he was to have given the whole story to the newspaper men.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am not a}} coward, as {{you know}} well," [...] she {{answered}} passionately, [...] "for many a deed of magic have we dared together in past days. But this is fearsome, to die that my body may become {{the home of the}} ghost of a dead man, who perchance, having entered it, will abide there, leaving my spirit houseless, or perchance will shut up the <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> heart in such fashion that they never can be opened. Can it not be done by trance as aforetime? Tell me, Hokosa, how often have you thus talked with the dead?" ...|$|R
6000|$|So now, the remedy? Yea, this: [...] I gently {{swing the}} <b>door</b> Here, <b>of</b> <b>my</b> fane--no soul to wis - [...] And cross the {{patterned}} floor [...] To the rood-screen [...] That stands between [...] The nave and inner chore.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do they? I was {{not aware}} of that. I struck my elbow last week so hard against the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> aunt's mansion that I feel the ache now.' ...|$|E
60|$|Before I was up {{the next}} morning I was {{informed}} that Fritz was waiting outside the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> room. I had him shown in, and he stood respectfully by my bedside.|$|E
6000|$|... "True," [...] muttered Hutchinson to himself; [...] "what care these roarers for {{the name}} of king? I must flee, or they will trample me down, on the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own dwelling!" ...|$|E

25|$|Vendyl Jones (1930 - 2010) led digs in Israel {{searching for}} the holy ark. He {{discovered}} items identified as the Temple incense and a clay vessel for holy anointing oil. In his book A <b>Door</b> <b>of</b> Hope: <b>My</b> Search for the Treasures of the Copper Scroll, he discusses the similarities.|$|R
2500|$|In 1998 the Northern Ireland Parades Commission {{banned the}} Orangeman's parade. Every year {{since then the}} parade has been {{prevented}} from parading down the Garvaghy Road. In an attempt to defuse the situation the General Synod of the Church of Ireland has requested the Reverend John Pickering, Rector of Drumcree Church, to refrain from holding the Orangemen's service. The Primate of the Church of Ireland, Dr. Robin Eames, stated that [...] "It {{is a form of}} blasphemy if, following a religious service, those who have attended it engage in behaviour which makes a mockery of such a service." [...] Pickering has, however, refused the request, maintaining that [...] "the <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> church are open to anyone, including Orangemen".|$|R
6000|$|Once {{within my}} little ante-chamber, {{he turned the}} key with his own hands, and {{pointing}} to the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> bedroom--"In there, Monsieur," [...] quoth he, [...] "we shall be safe from listeners." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Those {{dear friends}} and that clear {{atmosphere}} seemed very sweet to me, very fine but remote. My grip was fixing now upon the world. I saw another door opening--the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> career." ...|$|E
60|$|We separated. Ralph {{was unusually}} silent and serious {{on our way}} back. He took leave of me at the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> lodging, very abruptly; without {{referring}} again to our visit to the hospital.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't let me alarm you, sir," [...] {{the woman}} said. [...] "Mrs. Zant {{has been taken}} a little faint, at the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> our house. <b>My</b> master is {{attending}} to her." ...|$|R
5000|$|She {{authored}} {{four books}} {{of poetry and}} two memoirs. Her first book of poems, Vesper Sparrows, won the Delmore Schwartz Memorial Prize for Poetry. In 1997 Digges was awarded the Kingsley Tufts Poetry Award, the largest prize for a single work of poetry, for her book Rough Music. [...] She was also the winner of two Pushcart Prizes. [...] Digges translated the poems of the Cuban poet Maria Elena Cruz Varela. A book of poetry, The Wind Blows Through the <b>Doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>My</b> Heart: Poems, was published by Knopf in 2010. Digges died April 10, 2009, in Amherst, Massachusetts. Her death was reported as a suicide following her fatal fall {{from the top of}} the bleachers of Warren McGuirk Alumni Stadium at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.|$|R
60|$|Stopping only {{sufficiently}} long {{to secure}} the rifles which were near at hand, we four ran to the cabin, the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> which <b>my</b> mother held open; and once we were inside, the dear soul clasped me to her bosom as if I had {{come back from the}} dead, as indeed was very nearly the case.|$|R
