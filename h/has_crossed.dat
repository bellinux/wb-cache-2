5|$|After {{one block}} of Main Street, NY32 and NY212 turn onto Market Street, then east onto Ulster Avenue after another block. As it crosses the {{railroad}} tracks and leaves the village, the road widens and becomes a commercial highway just before reaching a Thruway exit. This, the fourth time NY32 <b>has</b> <b>crossed</b> the Thruway, {{is the first time}} it does so at an exit. Beyond the overpass, the concurrency ends when NY32 turns and heads north once again. A tight nearby on-ramp provides access to the southbound Thruway. NY32 does not enter the Catskills but provides access to them along this stretch.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-10c is the {{outermost}} {{of the two}} known planets of Kepler-10, completing one orbit of the star every 45.29485 days {{at a distance of}} 0.2407 AU. The inner planet, Kepler-10b, is a rocky planet that orbits every ~0.8 days at a distance of 0.01684 AU. Kepler-10c's equilibrium temperature is estimated at 584 K, almost four times hotter than Jupiter's. The planet's orbital inclination is 89.65º, or almost edge-on with respect to Earth and to Kepler-10. Transits have been observed at points where Kepler-10c <b>has</b> <b>crossed</b> in front of its host star.|$|E

5|$|Parasites {{recorded}} on the European nightjar include {{a single species}} of biting louse found on the wings, and a feather mite that occurs only on the white wing markings. Avian malaria has also been recorded. The leucocytozoon blood parasite L. caprimulgi is rare in the European nightjar. Its scarcity {{and the fact that}} it is the only one of its genus found in nightjars support the suggestion that it <b>has</b> <b>crossed</b> over from close relatives that normally infect owls.|$|E
5|$|Published on September 22, 2015, {{the fourth}} book, A Shiloh Christmas, was {{published}} by Atheneum, which printed 200,000 copies. A ferocious drought strikes Marty's community, and a new pastor joins blaming remorseless sinners for instigating it. Looking for a scapegoat, community members lie the responsibility squarely on people like Judd, an alcoholic and animal abuser who has reformed. A fire ravages multiple houses, including Judd's, prompting Marty and his family to help the homeowners reconstruct their homes. One day, Marty and a friend stumble upon Rachel, the pastor's daughter, confined to the pastor's toolshed. The incident forces Marty's parents {{to determine whether the}} disciplinary action <b>has</b> <b>crossed</b> the line from being disciplinary to being abusive. The book ends with characters who have vehemently differing views having a therapeutic Christmas meal together.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{explains}} that crossing the Void causes a traveller to become saturated in Void material. If {{he opens the}} breach and reverses it, anything saturated in Void material will be pulled in. Everyone except Jackie <b>has</b> <b>crossed</b> the breach and is thus vulnerable to being trapped in the Void, so the Doctor sends them all to the parallel universe. Rose decides she would rather be with the Doctor than her family and jumps back to help him. The Cybermen attempt to stop the Doctor but are repelled by a converted Ms. Hartman, who has resisted the effects of her conversion and at least partially retains her sense of self. The Doctor and Rose open the breach and hang on to magnetic clamps as the Cybermen and Daleks are pulled in. The Cult of Skaro use an emergency temporal shift to escape. Rose's lever slips, and in resetting it she loses her grip and plunges toward the Void. At the last second, Pete reappears and grabs her, and together they transport back to the parallel universe. The breach closes, leaving a devastated Rose trapped in the parallel universe. The devices used to travel between the two worlds have also stopped working. The Doctor presses his ear against the wall, as a tearful Rose does {{the same in the}} other universe, as if trying to listen for each other.|$|E
