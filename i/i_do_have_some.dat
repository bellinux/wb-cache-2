At the same time, we didn’t become librarians because we were passionate about Boolean operators!

However, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> problems with certain of his positions. In this brief commentary, let me discuss four matters regarding which I would take a different position than that which seems to be taken by Kreps.

40|$|It is a {{pleasure}} {{to participate in this}} panel at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. I would like to thank Fred Bergsten, Morris Goldstein, Nick Lardy, and Ted Truman for inviting me. My objective is to provide some comments on Ted Truman’s paper that deals with the management of China’s reserves and, more generally, the growing systemic role of sovereign wealth funds (SWFs). At the outset, I would like to thank Ted for his thoughtful work on SWFs—not only this paper but also the August 2007 Policy Brief. 2 While <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> questions about the methodology that Ted uses in the paper, his work is helping to bring some rationality to a topic that, until now, has been overly dominated by incomplete analysis, ill-defined concepts of national security and reciprocity, and monster-like characterizations of motives pertaining to political, military, and/or mercantilist aspects. The importance of more thoughtful and well-researched analyses of the SWF phenomenon cannot be overemphasized. After all, the phenomenon is part of a broader realignment of the global economy that, if well managed, can be part of an orderly solution to current national and international imbalances—a solution that can alleviate th...|$|E
40|$|The {{role of the}} {{transnational}} corporation (TNC) in promoting or impeding the development of countries {{is an issue that}} {{has been the subject of}} intense study in international political economy. From the late 1960 s until the early 1980 s, much was written about the origins, impact, and efforts to regulate TNCs (Vernon, 1971; Moran 1974; Biersteker 1978). Since the 1980 s, however, the turn of many developing countries toward a policy of export oriented industrialization from import substitution industrialization led to a new literature on modes of attracting the TNC and the role of production networks in the global economy (Ernst and Ravenhill 1999). In this sense, the renewed focus of Sergio Vacca and Gianni Cozzi (2002) on how TNCs might be drivers of development is a welcome addition. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> concerns about their arguments, which often mix normative and empirical arguments in a less than optimal manner. I also found that the arguments while provocative, do not fully take into account the extensive literature on the subject. The basic argument of the Vacca and Cozzi paper is that TNCs can be drivers of economic development under certain conditions. Before turning to their arguments, let u...|$|E

40|$|Professor trhler’s paper {{provides}} us with a thought-provoking account of why the project of school reform as envisaged and {{carried out in the}} twentieth century has, in its varied incarnations, so often fallen short of the mark. While I find myself sympathetic to a good deal of what Tröhler has to say by way of explaining this state of affairs, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> questions about his account. Moreover, I would like to join him in raising some critical questions about recent “reform ” efforts as a whole and in considering alternative ways of conceptualizing school reform. Finally, I want to raise the question of what all this means for historical studies of school reform. As a philosopher, I shall confine my commentary primarily to conceptual matters. I do not feel particularly competent to speak to substantive historical issues. Let us begin by considering the title of the paper, “Stability or Stagnation, or Why the School is not the Way Reformers Would Like. ” To whom does the term “reformer ” in the title refer? As Tröhler himself acknowledges, {{there are a number of}} different constituencies, or “stakeholders”, who have an interest in reforming the school and making it into something they would like — including educational re-searchers or policy-makers, the public, and various private-sector groups.

" Then I began to re-member that I really enjoy all of endocri-nology, never paid much heed to the ver-tebrate-invertebrate line anyway, and had students who used their academic freedom to wander all over the animal kingdom. In fact, I can think of at least a half-dozen types, including Don Mykles as a Ph.

I work at a law firm, Pillar Processing LLC, out in Amherst, dealing mostly with foreclosure and bankruptcy. Our clients, however, are not the mortgagers; instead they are the powerful banks (Fannie, Freddie, Wells Fargo, and basically anyone who has made the news). I like to think of us as the criminal defense attorneys of the Real Estate sector. This job is very interesting; I work in the judgments department where I am responsible for all the paper work that goes to the attorneys and judges when they enter court. I also send out all the case information to the defendants so they are prepared for court. Overall, it’s a very repetitive type of work; what keeps it going is that every county and every judge want something tweaked here and there or else they refuse the case in its entirety. Right now we’re doing a huge “blitz” trying to get as many judgments as possible sent to court before the banks get locked out. Because of this I have had to work many hours of over time in the last few weeks.

40|$|The feature {{article for}} this issue, {{entitled}} “(Re) Imagining Teacher Preparation for Conjoint Democratic Inquiry in Complex Classroom Ecologies, ” begins {{to carve out}} {{one aspect of the}} importance of relationship in the context of schooling. For the most part, the institution of schooling has ignored relationship. Instead, blaming teachers and students has become the modus operandi. Zero tolerance, accountability, among the many other sound bites in the politics of education categorically ignore the significance of relationship and its critical role not only in student—teacher dynamics, but also in all aspects of learning and personal growth. In fact, within the current political context, relationship is missing from the equation. Scripted curricula and requirements that teachers sign allegiance to these curricula, intensive teaching to the tests, the push for strict and specific national standards, and the desire to have all students working on the same “thing ” (and not relationships of any kind!) at the same time, are all tremendous obstacles to developing interpersonal relationships in the classroom and to learning relationships. Of course, the notion of relationships is much more extensive than just those connections that exist between people. Relationships should be the material of what we learn and teach (Bateson, 1979 / 2002; Donaldson, 1992). Since we are interested in complex systems, we need to see relationships as the material of systems, as well as to see relationships as systems themselves.
