Mint sauce, which is a blend of mint leaves, water, sugar and vinegar, is very common. Fish (cod, smoked herring) possesses an important place in the British diet. Only vegetables and potatoes are served <b>for</b> <b>garnish.</b> Vegetables assortment is very limited. The most common are turnips, cabbage, onions, carrots...|$|E
