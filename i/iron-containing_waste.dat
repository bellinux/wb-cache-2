30|$|Steel {{industry}} wastes (<b>iron-containing</b> <b>waste)</b> {{could be}} used as a Fenton-catalyst for the decolorization of methyl orange dye. Various reaction conditions were investigated including catalyst concentration, hydrogen peroxide concentration and pH value. The obtained results indicated that the dye degradation rate increases with increasing catalyst and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) concentrations and with decreasing pH value. Over 98  % decolorization of the dye was achieved within 30  min at optimum reaction conditions; 200  mg/L catalyst and 34  mM H 2 O 2 concentrations at pH 2 for 20  mg/L initial dye concentration. Reaction kinetics was also carried out to determine the order of reaction in both catalyst and H 2 O 2 concentrations. Stability and reusability of <b>Iron-containing</b> <b>waste</b> were investigated. The <b>iron-containing</b> <b>waste</b> as catalyst can be reused several times with nearly same efficiency of Fenton-like oxidation of MO.|$|E

A concept of direct synthesis of metallized moulds and ferrous casting alloys from the dispersed <b>iron-containing</b> production <b>waste</b> materials with solid-phase and liquid-phase metallizing of the alloy components has been elaborated; a complex method has been devised to determine the technical parameters of the cupola heat with the combination blast used, and the efficiency of blowing in the hearth of dust-gas mixtures containing dispersed production waste materials as substitutes for fuel, flux and metal portions of the lumpy charge loaded from top.

40|$|The {{dissolution}} of quartz particles {{and the growth}} and {{dissolution of}} crystalline phases during the conversion of batch to glass potentially affects both the glass melting process and product quality. Crystals of spinel exiting the cold cap to molten glass below can be troublesome during the vitrification of <b>iron-containing</b> high-level <b>wastes.</b> To estimate the distribution of quartz and spinel fractions within the cold cap, we used kinetic models that relate fractions of these phases to temperature and heating rate. Fitting the model equations to data showed that the heating rate, apart from affecting quartz and spinel behavior directly, also affects them indirectly via concurrent processes, such as the formation and motion of bubbles. Because of these indirect effects, {{it was necessary to}} allow one kinetic parameter (the pre-exponential factor) to vary with the heating rate. The resulting kinetic equations are sufficiently simple for the detailed modeling of batch-to-glass conversion as it occurs in glass melters. The estimated fractions and sizes of quartz and spinel particles as they leave the cold cap, determined in this study, will provide the source terms needed for modeling the behavior of these solid particles within the flow of molten glass in the melter...|$|R
30|$|This work {{focuses on}} the use of <b>iron-containing</b> <b>waste</b> instead of iron salts as a {{catalyst}} in heterogeneous Fenton process using methyl orange as a model compound for dye wastewater. The effect of different reaction conditions (e.g. pH value, catalyst dose, hydrogen peroxide concentration and initial dye concentration) on degradation of dye was assessed along with catalyst reusability.|$|E
30|$|In this study, <b>iron-containing</b> <b>waste</b> {{was used}} as a {{heterogeneous}} Fenton-catalyst. The <b>iron-containing</b> <b>waste</b> had a high catalytic activity toward the degradation of MO dye in the presence of H 2 O 2 and in acidic pH range. 200  mg/L of waste could catalyze 24  mM H 2 O 2 to achieve 99  % of decolorization efficiency of solution containing 20  mg/L of MO dye in just 30  min at pH 2. Different kinetic models were investigated to determine the exact rate equation that fits the experimental data. First-order kinetics was found to be the best rate equation. Order of reaction in hydrogen peroxide concentration was 0.426, while order of reaction in catalyst concentration was 1.12, respectively. This indicates that rate or reaction was more dependent on catalyst concentration rather than hydrogen peroxide concentration. Results also showed that the catalyst have a good stability and reusability. This study may provide useful information for the use of low cost materials as catalysts in heterogeneous Fenton process catalysts for degradation of organic pollutants.|$|E
40|$|Rational use {{of highly}} {{dispersed}} metal waste {{is an important}} issue of material science and environment protection. The quality of the powdered matallic materials used in industry is steadily increasing: they are especially widely used in the enterprises producing iron powders, in metal sheet production, as well as in abrasive machining. This paper presents an analysis of several kinds of metal waste such as iron and steel powders, mill scales, steel punching, metal shavings and other <b>iron-containing</b> <b>waste</b> from mechanical engineering and metallurgy industries, and the possibility of their use in the manufacturing of concrete products like fillers...|$|E
30|$|To {{exclude the}} {{possibility}} of homogeneous Fenton reaction by the leached iron, the concentration of leached iron was measured using atomic absorption spectrometer and {{was found to be}} 0.15  mg/L. Then, homogeneous Fenton process was carried out using the same concentration of iron that was leached out from the catalyst. Under the same operating conditions, the decolorization efficiency of homogeneous Fenton process after 2  h was only 8  % which was much less than that in case of heterogeneous system using <b>iron-containing</b> <b>waste.</b> Therefore, the catalytic activity has been primarily attributed to the steel industry waste catalyst and not to the dissolved iron ions.|$|E
30|$|In this study, {{the waste}} {{produced}} from steel industry {{was used as}} a catalyst in heterogeneous Fenton oxidation process. Steel is manufactured by the chemical reduction of iron ore, using an integrated steel manufacturing process or a direct reduction process. In the conventional integrated steel manufacturing process, the iron from the blast furnace is converted to steel in a basic oxygen furnace (BOF). Steel can also be made in an electric arc furnace (EAF) from scrap steel and, in some cases, from direct reduced iron. Three major waste streams are generated during steel manufacturing, air emissions, wastewater and solid waste. The solid waste from the conventional process, including furnace slag and collected dust, is generated at an average rate ranging from 300  kg/t of steel manufactured to 500  kg/t. This waste is rich in iron and {{can be used as a}} catalyst in heterogeneous Fenton process for wastewater treatment. The use of <b>iron-containing</b> <b>waste</b> in the treatment of wastewater will hopefully reduce the cost of wastewater treatment.|$|E
30|$|XRD {{pattern of}} <b>iron-containing</b> <b>waste</b> (catalyst) was {{recorded}} on Bruker diffractometer equipped with graphite monochromatized Cu-Kα radiation (Germany). Amount of leached iron was determined {{with the aid}} of atomic absorption spectrometer (Varian, Spectra AA 220). All experiments were conducted in conical flask (250  mL) placed on orbital shaker (Stuart scientific, UK) with 200  rpm rotation speed and under dark circumstance. The reaction suspension containing specified concentrations of both MO dye and steel waste was prepared, and its initial pH was adjusted by diluted H 2 SO 4. The experiments were initiated by adding the desired amount of H 2 O 2 to the reaction mixture. Five milliliter samples were collected at pre-determined time intervals during the reaction, and then NaOH was immediately added to the sample as reaction inhibitor because at first, H 2 O 2 is not stable in alkaline solution and second, the formation of ferric hydroxide complexes leads to a reduction of ·OH radical (Ji et al. 2011). Samples were allowed to settle for short time before measuring absorbance at λmax of methyl orange by UV–Visible spectrophotometer (Jasco V 530, Japan).|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of hydrogen by the catalytic cracking of methane was investigated. An extensive study was undertaken on {{two categories of}} materials, namely iron-containing wastes and prepared catalysts, which include palladium-based catalysts, nickel-based catalysts and a copper-based catalyst. Three types of <b>iron-containing</b> <b>waste</b> materials were examined as pre-catalysts. The iron waste samples comprised a biogenic sample from a local Landfill site; waste residue sample from an old local nail works site and Red Mud. The resulting waste iron catalysts are environmentally benign and may be “thrown away” following use. The biogenic sample presented an unusual tubular morphology resulting from its biogenesis. All these materials possessed significant peak activity for hydrogen production at 800 °C. Significant carbon deposition occurred on these samples. Calcination of biogenic and waste residue samples at 900 °C enhanced performance. Carbon was deposited {{in the form of}} carbon filaments on the waste residue sample. The addition of Pd promoted the biogenic sample’s activity but poisoned the waste residue sample. Cracking of methane over palladium-containing zeolite catalysts has also been studied. Pd/H-ZSM- 5 exhibited the highest peak hydrogen formation rate at 750 °C and the highest amount of carbon was produced at 900 °C. The addition of Ni, Co, Cu and Fe dopants did not improve performance. The effect of support type (H-ZSM- 5, -Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2) on the Pd catalyst performance was also investigated, with -Al 2 O 3 producing the best activity. All post-reaction Pd catalysts showed the formation of carbon filaments. On comparing the catalytic activity of Pd/H-ZSM- 5, Ni/H-ZSM- 5 and Cu/H-ZSM- 5, it was found that Pd/H-ZSM- 5 catalyst possessed the highest activity, while Ni/H-ZSM- 5 and Cu/H-ZSM- 5 catalysts showed lower activity and similarity to each other in behaviour. Carbon filaments were formed over Pd/H-ZSM- 5 and Cu/H-ZSM- 5 but did not form over Ni/H-ZSM- 5. It was observed that the carbon filaments only grow at higher Ni-loading on the zeolite. The catalytic activities of Ni on different supports were evaluated and SiO 2 was found to be the most effective support...|$|E
