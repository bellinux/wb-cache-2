5|$|The Embraer {{started calling}} on the <b>emergency</b> <b>frequency,</b> 121.5MHz, {{immediately}} after the collision, but as it was later determined in the CENIPA report, the emergency transceivers in the area were not operational and thus the crew was unable to reach ATC on that frequency.|$|E
25|$|Around {{and above}} the map were more tellers who {{controlled}} the communications, connecting incoming reports to the plotter on the floor nearest that location on the map or connecting incoming requests for information to another teller who could read the map. Tellers examined the track markers, whose larger print allowed them to see the information, although this sometimes required opera glasses. Sometimes information {{would have to be}} plotted that came from an external source, not normally part of the reporting chain; a fighter calling an SOS would report this through his radio on an <b>emergency</b> <b>frequency,</b> which would be picked up by the closest listening post. This information would also flow into the filter room but they were not connected to the plotters on the floor. Operators above the map could mark locations of interest using theatrical spotlights and filters allowed them to change the message being projected.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{arriving}} at the station, guests boarded a large, open-air aerial tram vehicle. There, a live guide aboard the tram informed {{them that they were}} being evacuated off of Manhattan Island and over to Roosevelt Island during Kong's attack. The tram's radio was tuned to the police <b>emergency</b> <b>frequency</b> so that guests could be informed of Kong's location in the city. The tram traveled above the streets of downtown New York City where guests could view Kong's path of destruction. There was a water geyser from a broken fire hydrant, broken steam pipes, crashed and overturned cars, and a subway train partly derailed from its elevated track. A police chopper described the scene around the tram over the radio, alerting that Kong was approaching the tramway and that he was grabbing a power pole. Kong's silhouette could briefly be seen as a spotlight shone on a building ahead of the tram. As the tram passed the power pole, it tipped over and its electrical transformer exploded, unleashing a shower of sparks and fire, which ignited the derailed elevated subway train.|$|E
25|$|In a few cases, a {{national}} telecommunication agency may also allow hams to use frequencies {{outside of the}} internationally allocated amateur radio bands. In Trinidad and Tobago, hams are allowed to use a repeater which is located on 148.800MHz. This repeater is used and maintained by the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), but may be used by radio amateurs in times of emergency or during normal times to test their capability and conduct emergency drills. This repeater {{can also be used}} by non-ham NEMA staff and REACT members. In Australia and New Zealand ham operators are authorized to use one of the UHF TV channels. In the U.S., amateur radio operators providing essential communication needs in connection with the immediate safety of human life and immediate protection of property when normal communication systems are not available may use any frequency including those of other radio services such as police and fire and in cases of disaster in Alaska may use the statewide <b>emergency</b> <b>frequency</b> of 5167.5kHz with restrictions upon emissions.|$|E

2500|$|According to the U.S. government, Vincennes mistakenly {{identified}} the Iranian airliner as an attacking military fighter. The officers mis{{identified the}} flight profile being flown by the Airbus A300B2 as being {{similar to that}} of an F-14A Tomcat during an attack run; however, the ship's own Aegis Combat System recorded the flight plan of the Iranian airliner as climbing (not descending as in an attack run) {{at the time of the}} incident. The commercial flight had originated at Bandar Abbas, which served dual roles as a base for Iranian F-14 operations and as a hub for commercial, civilian flights. According to the same reports, Vincennes tried unsuccessfully to contact the approaching aircraft, seven times on the military <b>emergency</b> <b>frequency</b> and three times on the civilian <b>emergency</b> <b>frequency,</b> but never on air traffic control frequencies. This civilian aircraft was not equipped to pick up military frequencies and the messages on the civilian emergency channel could have been directed at any aircraft. [...] More confusion arose as the hailed speed was the ground speed, while the pilot's instruments displayed airspeed, a [...] difference.|$|E
2500|$|Four {{days after}} Powers disappeared, NASA issued a very {{detailed}} press release noting that an aircraft had [...] "gone missing" [...] north of Turkey. The press release {{speculated that the}} pilot might have fallen unconscious while the autopilot was still engaged, even falsely claiming that [...] "the pilot reported over the <b>emergency</b> <b>frequency</b> that he was experiencing oxygen difficulties." [...] To bolster this, a U-2 plane was quickly painted in NASA colors and shown to the media. Under {{the impression that the}} pilot had died and that the plane had been destroyed, the Americans had decided to use the NASA cover-up plan. Nikita Khrushchev used the American misstep to embarrass President Eisenhower and his administration.|$|E

40|$|An {{aircraft}} crash location transmitter tuned to transmit on standard <b>emergency</b> <b>frequencies</b> is reported that is shock mounted {{in a sealed}} circular case atop the tail of an aircraft {{by means of a}} shear pin designed to fail under a G loading associated with a crash situation. The antenna for the transmitter is a metallic spring blade coiled like a spiral spring around the outside of the circular case. A battery within the case for powering the transmitter is kept trickle charged from the electrical system of the aircraft through a break away connector on the case. When a crash occurs, the resultant ejection of the case from the tail due to a failure of the shear pin releases the free end of the antenna which automatically uncoils. The accompanying separation of the connector effects closing of the transmitter key and results in commencement of transmission...|$|R
5000|$|On {{that same}} day, South Vietnamese Air Force Major Buang-Ly loaded {{his wife and}} five {{children}} into a two-seat Cessna O-1 Bird Dog and took off from Con Son Island. After evading enemy ground fire Major Buang headed out to sea and spotted the Midway. The Midways crew attempted to contact the aircraft on <b>emergency</b> <b>frequencies</b> but the pilot continued to circle overhead with his landing lights turned on. When a spotter reported that {{there were at least}} four people in the two-place aircraft, all thoughts of forcing the pilot to ditch alongside were abandoned - it was unlikely the passengers of the overloaded Bird Dog could survive the ditching and safely escape before the plane sank. After three tries, Major Buang managed to drop a note from a low pass over the deck: [...] "Can you move the helicopter to the other side, I can land on your runway, I can fly for one hour more, we have enough time to move. Please rescue me! Major Buang, wife and 5 child." ...|$|R
50|$|Inflight - {{which the}} pilots call “Radio”, activates, cancels, and alters VFR flight plans. They take {{position}} reports and changes of destination for both {{civilian and military}} aircraft. They relay IFR and SVFR clearances to aircraft on the ground either by phone or through their frequencies {{when there is no}} direct method of communication with the air traffic control facility governing the area. At border stations, Radio also takes information from aircraft crossing into the U.S., and issues squawk codes to VFR aircraft which identify them to Homeland Security’s radar. They relay information on forest fires to the U.S. Forest Service. Inflight monitors VHF and UHF frequencies, VOR voices, and <b>emergency</b> <b>frequencies</b> - from 60 to 100 different frequencies per area. The United States FSS radio frequencies are published in several FAA publications, including airport facility directories (AFD), VFR sectional maps, and IFR low and high altitude en route charts. When pilots have an inflight emergency, such as being lost, having smoke in the cockpit, or having low fuel and needing directions to the nearest airport with fuel, they call flight service for assistance.|$|R
50|$|Violating {{prohibited}} airspace {{established for}} national security purposes may result in military interception and/or {{the possibility of an}} attack upon the violating aircraft.

50|$|The {{civilian}} aircraft <b>emergency</b> <b>frequency</b> for voice distress alerting is 121.5 MHz. Military aircraft use 243 MHz (which is a harmonic of 121.5 MHz, {{and therefore}} civilian beacons transmit on this frequency as well). Aircraft can also signal an emergency by setting {{one of several}} special transponder codes, such as 7700.|$|E
50|$|On 16 June, {{as part of}} Russia's {{campaign}} to pressure the US to agree to closer cooperation over Syria, Russian military aircraft bombed, with cluster bombs, a military outpost in al-Tanf that was garrisoned by the New Syrian Army in south east Syria. US and British special forces based in Jordan regularly worked with Syrian rebels at the al-Tanf outpost, the airstrike happened 24 hours after a detachment of 20 British special forces left the outpost. After the airstrike took place, US commanders warned Russia that the garrison {{was part of the}} international coalition against IS and therefore shouldn't be attacked, but 90 minutes later, nearby US warplanes observed Russian jets dropping a second barrage of bombs on the outpost, killing 4 rebel soldiers. A US spy plane overhead tried to contact the Russian pilots on <b>emergency</b> <b>frequencies,</b> but the Russians did not answer. US officials demanded an explanation from Moscow, but they were told the Russian pilots struck the outpost because they thought it was ISIL base, Russian officials then said that Jordan had approved the strikes in advance, but Jordan denied it. Moscow also claimed its air command headquarters in Syria was unable to call off the strikes because the US had not given them the precise position of the outpost.|$|R
