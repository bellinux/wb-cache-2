25|$|Early 1980-1985 models {{featured}} butterfly opening windows, round side indicators, only {{a single}} set of tail lights {{on each side of}} the car, no rear defroster, and usually a black interior with a black dashboard, and many metal trim pieces such as window crank handles and door handles. Since around 1985, the cars received more comfortable seating, a blue or brown dashboard, two-part tail lights on each side, square side signals, rear defroster, redesigned instrument cluster, and butterfly windows that did not open. In 1990, a fuel <b>filler</b> <b>flap</b> was added instead of a twist cap, and some minor interior and instrument cluster changes were implemented. In 1991, the dashboard was redesigned first for the Yugo GVX and then for the European model, side butterfly windows were removed, and a bigger tank was introduced. In 2000, the car received a new front fascia with new bumpers, rear spoiler, a redesigned dashboard, and seats. The latest changes were in 2007, with the introduction of a new instrument cluster.|$|E
50|$|Modern cars often feature remote {{opening of}} the fuel tank fuel <b>filler</b> <b>flap</b> using an {{electric}} motor or cable release. For both convenience and security, many modern fuel tanks cannot be opened by hand or otherwise from {{the outside of the}} car.|$|E
50|$|For 1969, {{the only}} {{exterior}} change was the fuel <b>filler</b> <b>flap</b> {{no longer had}} a finger indentation due to a new interior-mounted fuel door release. For North America, the Beetle received a heated rear window, day/night mirror and the semi-trailing, independent suspension with double jointed swing axles as standard equipment. In other markets, manual transmission models retained a swing axle independent suspension which would continue until the end of German Beetle production.|$|E
5000|$|... 1968 {{was a year}} {{of major}} change. The most {{noticeable}} of which were the new larger, higher mounted C-section bumpers. At the rear, new larger taillamps were adopted {{and were able to}} accommodate backup lamps, which were previously separate bumper-mounted units. Beetles worldwide received the '67 North American style vertical headlamp placement, but with replaceable-bulb headlamps compliant with ECE regulations rather than the US sealed beams. Other improvements were a new outside gas <b>filler</b> with spring-loaded <b>flap,</b> eliminating the need to open the trunk to refuel. The fuel gauge was integrated with the speedometer and was now electrically actuated rather than cable-operated. The windscreen washer was now pressured by the spare tire, which was to be maintained at a pressure of [...] A pressure valve in the connecting hose closed airflow to the fluid reservoir if spare tire pressure fell below , which was above the recommended pressures for the road tires. A ventilation system was introduced, which drew fresh air into the cabin from louvres on the front decklid. For improved shifting, the shift lever was shortened, stiffened and moved rearward by 78 mm.|$|R
50|$|Inside all {{the cars}} came with a bench seat at the front and at the back as {{standard}} apart {{from the top of}} the line Taunus 20M TS which included individual front seats as standard. Individual seats were available at extra cost on the less exalted models, as part of a (by the standards of the time) long list of optional extras. The boot/trunk could be locked from the outside, and when this was done the adjacent fuel <b>filler</b> <b>flap</b> was locked automatically at the same time.|$|E
50|$|The Octavia {{features}} numerous so-called ‘Simply Clever‘ details, i.e. an {{ice scraper}} inside the fuel <b>filler</b> <b>flap,</b> a rubbish bin {{inside the door}} panel, and a double-sided (rubber/textile) floor mat in boot. A tilting/sliding panoramic sunroof is available as an option - single-piece for the Octavia hatchback and two-piece for the Octavia Combi. The Bolero, Amundsen and Columbus car radios are protected against theft by the physical separation of the central display and the multimedia system’s own central unit. The Octavia also offers a Phone Box, a storage compartment for the mobile phone with planar antenna {{in the bottom of}} the compartment, which permits a so-called inductive exterior antenna connection.|$|E
50|$|Cold {{inflation}} pressure is the {{inflation pressure}} of tires before {{the car is}} driven and the tires warmed up. Recommended cold inflation pressure is displayed on the owner's manual and on the placard (or sticker) attached to the vehicle door edge, pillar, glovebox door or fuel <b>filler</b> <b>flap.</b> Drivers are encouraged {{to make sure their}} tires are adequately inflated, as suboptimal tire pressure can greatly reduce fuel economy, increase emissions, increased wear on the edges of the tire surface, and can lead to premature failure of the tire. Excessive pressure, on the other hand, may lead to impact-breaks, decrease braking performance, and cause uneven wear (i.e. greater wear on the center part of the tire surface).|$|E
50|$|The GTV/Spider was {{equipped}} as standard with power steering, driver and passenger airbag, automatic air conditioning, front seatbelt pretensioners, Bosch ABS (with EBD from 1998), electric heated door mirrors, electric frameless windows with one-touch operation for the driver's side, height adjustable headlamps, {{front and rear}} foglights, third brake light, fire prevention system, reach and rake adjustable leather clad steering wheel, stitched leather gear knob, an automatic electric aerial, a stereo radio/cassette with six speakers and central locking with Alfa-CODE immobiliser, internal electric release for the bootlid and <b>filler</b> <b>flap.</b> The additional options were: alarm system, passenger-side airbag removal, electric heated seats (GTV only), metallic paint, iridescent paint (only with Lusso trim), leather MOMO seats (only with Lusso trim) and electric sunroof (GTV only). For the Spider some cars could be equipped with an electric hood folding mechanism.|$|E
