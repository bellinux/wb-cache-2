40|$|Abstract: Double-row {{tapered roller}} bearing 353112 is used in trucks, and the {{external}} load and pressure distribution of the bearing are calculated combining with the specific operating conditions. Tapered roller bearings typically employ roller profile modification to equalize the load distribution, minimize the stress concentration at the roller ends. Doing FEA (finite element analysis) on the contact stress with the changing roller crowning between roller and races, the appropriate roller profile and the crown <b>drop</b> of <b>roller</b> can be achieved. Finally the best control equation of roller crowning is given out. It has important guiding significance {{for the improvement of}} roller crowning design of truck hub bearings...|$|R
