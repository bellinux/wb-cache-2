In fact, since the true exposures depend upon the intricate mechanisms of progeny deposition in the lung, therefore an integrated approach {{for the assessment of}} progeny is essential. In this context, the recently developed deposition based progeny concentration measurement techniques (DTPS: <b>Direct</b> Thoron <b>progeny</b> sensors and DRPS: <b>Direct</b> Radon <b>progeny</b> sensors) appear to be best suited for radiological risk assessments both among occupational workers and general study populations. DTPS and DRPS consist of aluminized mylar mounted LR 115 type passive detectors, which essentially detects the alpha particles emitted from the deposited progeny atoms on the detector surface. It gives <b>direct</b> measure of <b>progeny</b> activity concentrations in air. DTPS has a lower limit of detection limit of 0. 1 Bq/m(3) whereas that for DRPS is 1 Bq/m(3), hence are perfectly suitable for indoor environments. These DTPS and DRPS can be capped with 200 -mesh type wire-screen to measure the coarse fraction of the progeny concentration and the corresponding coarse fraction deposition velocities as well as the time integrated fine fraction. DTPS and DRPS can also be lodged in an integrated sampler wherein the wire-mesh and filter-paper are arranged in an array in flow-mode, to measure the fine and coarse fraction concentration separately and simultaneously.

40|$|During neocortical development, {{excitatory}} neurons {{are produced}} from apical progenitors in the ventricular zone (VZ) or from dividing {{cells in the}} subventricular zone (SVZ). We previously reported that the <b>direct</b> <b>progenies</b> of VZ cells in mice slowly exit the VZ and accumulate just above the VZ (lower SVZ) as multipolar migrating neurons, whereas subsequently dividing cells in the SVZ exit the VZ earlier than the former and become widely distributed in the SVZ. These two populations are named the slowly exiting population (SEP) and the rapidly exiting population (REP), respectively. In mice, REP cells include basal progenitors as the major population and are characterized by a long ascending process; their morphology resembles that of basal radial glial cells (bRGs), which have been observed in {{the inner and outer}} SVZ in primates. The dramatic {{increase in the number of}} bRGs in primates, especially in humans, is thought to underlie the acquisition of a huge cortex during evolution. We previously reported that the REP/SEP production rate in the lateral cortical VZ is higher than that in the dorsomedial VZ in mice. To search for molecules responsible for the higher REP production in the lateral cortical VZ, we conducted microarray analyses and identified genes that were differentially expressed between the lateral and medial VZs in mice. These genes were considered to be among the candidates responsible for the regulation of the REP/SEP production rate. To investigate the selection pressures during primate evolution on these candidate genes, we estimated the synonymous versus non-synonymous base substitution rates. As a result, the negative selection pressures on the Megf 11, Dmrt 3, and Cntn 3 genes were found to be significantly weaker in primates than in non-primates, while those on Jag 1, Ntrk 2, and Pmp 22 were stronger.

40|$|Radon (222 Rn), being a {{radioactive}} gas has {{its parent}} nucleus originated from 238 U. From 238 U {{there is a}} series of 14 decays to form a stable nucleus of 206 Pb. The equilibrium factor in its simple term may be defined as ratio of the amount of progeny nucleus to that of a parent nucleus. Measurement of Equilibrium Factor (F-factor) for radon has been carried out in 24 dwellings in Aizawl City, which were specifically selected according to the site location and materials used for construction of the dwellings. In measuring F-factor for radon we have made use of absorber-mounted nuclear track detectors (LR- 115) which selectively register the tracks due to alpha emissions from 214 Po which is the 222 Rn progeny species. This detector is termed as DRPS (<b>direct</b> radon <b>progeny</b> sensor). DRPS is used for estimating the Equilibrium Equivalent Radon Concentration (EERC). The concentration of 222 Rn is measured by using Solid State Nuclear Track Detector (LR- 115) mounted in a BARC type twin cup dosimeter.

40|$|A {{common problem}} in {{neural stem cell}} {{research}} is the poor generation of neuronal or oligodendroglial descendants. The author takes a developmental perspective to propose solutions to this problem. After a general overview of the recent progress in developmental neurobiology, she highlights the necessity of the sequential and hierarchical specification of CNS precursors toward the generation of specific cell types, for example, neurons. In the developing {{as well as the}} adult CNS, multipotent stem cells do not directly generate neurons but give rise to precursors that are specified and restricted toward the generation of neurons. Some molecular determinants of this fate restriction have been identified during recent years and reveal that progression via this fate-restricted state is a necessary step of neurogenesis. These discoveries also demonstrate that neuronal fate specification is inseparably linked at the molecular level to regionalization of the developing CNS. These fate determinants and their specific action in distinct region-specific contexts are essential to <b>direct</b> the <b>progeny</b> of stem cells more efficiently toward the generation of the desired cell types. Recent data are discussed that demonstrate the common identity of precursors and stem cells in the developing and adult nervous system as radial glia, astroglia, or non-myelinating glia. A novel lineage model is proposed that incorporates these new views and explains why the default pathway of stem cells is astroglia.

It critically {{depends on the}} correct functioning of rare, quiescent haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and more numerous, HSC-derived, highly proliferative and differentiating haematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). Infection is known to affect HSCs, with severe and chronic inflammatory stimuli leading to stem cell pool depletion, while acute, non-lethal infections exert transient and even potentiating effects. Both whether this paradigm applies to all infections and whether the HSC response is the dominant driver of the changes observed during stressed haematopoiesis remain open questions. We use a mouse model of malaria, based on natural, sporozoite-driven Plasmodium berghei infection, as an experimental platform to gain a global view of haematopoietic perturbations during infection progression. We observe coordinated responses by the most primitive HSCs and multiple HPCs, some starting before blood parasitaemia is detected. We show that, despite highly variable inter-host responses, primitive HSCs become highly proliferative, but mathematical modelling suggests that this alone {{is not sufficient to}} significantly impact the whole haematopoietic cascade. We observe that the dramatic expansion of Sca- 1 (+) progenitors results from combined proliferation of <b>direct</b> HSC <b>progeny</b> and phenotypic changes in downstream populations.

The objective was to study the thoron decay product characteristics such as the deposition velocities, spatial variability and dependence on aerosol particle concentrations. Since the deposition velocity is an important characteristic in the calibration of the DTPS, {{it is very important to}} study its dependence on aerosol concentration in a controlled environment. At low aerosol concentration (1500 particles/cm(3)) the mean effective deposition velocity was measured to be 0. 159 +/- 0. 045 m h(- 1); at high aerosol concentration (30 000 particles/cm 3) it decreased to 0. 079 +/- 0. 009 m h(- 1). The deposition velocity for the attached fraction of the thoron decay products did not change with increasing aerosol concentration, showing measurement results of 0. 048 +/- 0. 005 m h(- 1) and 0. 043 +/- 0. 014 m h(- 1), respectively. At low particle concentration, the effective deposition velocity showed large scattering within the room at different distances from center. The attached fraction deposition velocity remained uniform at different distances from the wall. The measurements in the thoron experimental house can be used as a sensitivity test of the DTPS in an indoor environment with changing aerosol concentration. The uniform spatial distribution of thoron decay products was confirmed within the experimental house.

From a patient with chronic ATL, whose leukemic cells proliferated in vitro in response to IL- 2, we repeatedly established leukemic T cell clones having the same rearrangement profile of the T beta chain gene as the leukemic cells.

Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we further investigated this assumption and used massively parallel whole-genome sequencing to compare one drug-susceptible (K- 1) and one multidrug resistant (MDR) isolate (K- 2) of a rapidly spreading M. tuberculosis Beijing genotype clone from a high incidence region (Karakalpakstan, Uzbekistan).

It is conjectured that these deposits will result in higher emissions of radon isotopes (Rn- 222 and Rn- 220) and their daughter products as compared to Normal Background Radiation Areas (NBRAs). While the annual external dose rates contributed by gamma radiations in these areas are about 5 - 10 times higher, the extent of increase in the inhalation dose rates attributable to Rn- 222 and Rn- 220 and their decay products is not well quantified. Towards this, systematic indoor surveys were conducted wherein simultaneous measurements of time integrated Rn- 222 and Rn- 220 gas and their decay product concentrations was carried out in around 800 houses in the HBRAs of Kerala and Odisha to estimate the inhalation doses. All gas measurements were carried out using pin-hole cup dosimeters while the progeny measurements were with samplers and systems based on the <b>Direct</b> radon/thoron <b>Progeny</b> sensors (DRPS/DTPS). To corroborate these passive measurements of decay products concentrations, active sampling was also carried out in a few houses.

Understanding the evolutionary response of diseases in new situations has clear public-health consequences, given the changes in social and movement patterns over recent decades and {{the increased use of}} antibiotics. This paper investigates how a disease may adapt in response to the routes of transmission available between infected and susceptible individuals. The potential transmission routes are defined by a computer-generated contact network, which we describe as either local (highly clustered networks where connected individuals are likely to share common contacts) or global (unclustered networks with a high proportion of long-range connections). Evolution towards stable strategies operates through the gradual random mutation of disease traits (transmission rate and infectious period) whenever new infections occur. In contrast to mean-field models, the use of contact networks greatly constrains the evolutionary dynamics. In the local networks, high transmission rates are selected for, as there is intense competition for susceptible hosts between disease progeny. By contrast, global networks select for moderate transmission rates because <b>direct</b> competition between <b>progeny</b> is minimal and a premium is placed upon persistence. All networks show a very slow but steady rise in the infectious period...|$|R
40|$|Many {{cells in}} mammals {{exist in the}} state of quiescence, which is {{characterized}} by reversible exit from the cell cycle. Quiescent cells are widely reported to exhibit reduced size, nucleotide synthesis, and metabolic activity. Much lower glycolytic rates have been reported in quiescent compared with proliferating lymphocytes. In contrast, we show here that primary human fibroblasts continue to exhibit high metabolic rates when induced into quiescence via contact inhibition. By monitoring isotope labeling through metabolic pathways and quantitatively identifying fluxes from the data, we show that contact-inhibited fibroblasts utilize glucose in all branches of central carbon metabolism at rates similar to those of proliferating cells, with greater overflow flux from the pentose phosphate pathway back to glycolysis. Inhibition of the pentose phosphate pathway resulted in apoptosis preferentially in quiescent fibroblasts. By feeding the cells labeled glutamine, we also detected a "backwards" flux in the tricarboxylic acid cycle from α-ketoglutarate to citrate that was enhanced in contact-inhibited fibroblasts; this flux likely contributes to shuttling of NADPH from the mitochondrion to cytosol for redox defense or fatty acid synthesis. The high metabolic activity of the fibroblasts was directed in part toward breakdown and resynthesis of protein and lipid, and in part toward excretion of extracellular matrix proteins. Thus, reduced metabolic activity is not a hallmark of the quiescent state. Quiescent fibroblasts, relieved of the biosynthetic requirements associated with generating <b>progeny,</b> <b>direct</b> their metabolic activity to preservation of self integrity and alternative functions beneficial to the organism as a whole...|$|R
40|$|The {{stem cell}} niche of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) primary root apical {{meristem}} {{is composed of}} the quiescent (or organizing) center surrounded by stem (initial) cells for the different tissues. Initial cells generate a population of transit-amplifying cells that undergo {{a limited number of}} cell divisions before elongating and differentiating. It is unclear whether these divisions occur stochastically or in an orderly manner. Using the thymidine analog 5 -ethynyl- 2 '-deoxyuridine to monitor DNA replication of cells of Arabidopsis root meristems, we identified a pattern of two, four, and eight neighboring cells with synchronized replication along the cortical, epidermal, and endodermal cell files, suggested to be daughters, granddaughters, and great-granddaughters of the <b>direct</b> <b>progeny</b> of each stem cell. Markers of mitosis and cytokinesis were not present in the region closest to the transition zone where the cells start to elongate, suggesting that great-granddaughter cells switch synchronously from the mitotic cell cycle to endoreduplication. Mutations in the stem cell niche-expressed ASH 1 -RELATED 3 (ASHR 3) gene, encoding a SET-domain protein conferring histone H 3 lysine- 36 methylation, disrupted this pattern of coordinated DNA replication and cell division and increased the cell division rate in the quiescent center. E 2 Fa/E 2 Fb transcription factors controlling the G 1 -to-S-phase transition regulate ASHR 3 expression and bind to the ASHR 3 promoter, substantiating a role for ASHR 3 in cell division control. The reduced length of the root apical meristem and primary root of the mutant ashr 3 - 1 indicate that synchronization of replication and cell divisions is required for normal root growth and development...|$|E
40|$|Tissue {{stem cells}} must be endowed with {{superior}} {{maintenance and repair}} systems to ensure genomic stability over multiple generations, which would be less necessary in more differentiated cells. We previously reported that human keratinocyte stem cells were more resistant to ionizing radiation toxicity than their <b>direct</b> <b>progeny,</b> the keratinocyte progenitor cells. In the present study we addressed the mechanisms underlying this difference. Investigations of DNA repair showed that both single and double DNA strand breaks were repaired more rapidly and more efficiently in stem cells than in progenitors. As cell signaling is a key regulatory step {{in the management of}} DNA damage, a gene profiling study was performed. Data revealed that several genes of the fibroblast growth factor type 2 (FGF 2) signaling pathway were induced by DNA damage in stem cells and not in progenitors. Furthermore, an increased content of the FGF 2 protein was found in irradiated stem cells, both for the secreted and the cellular forms of the protein. To examine the role of endogenous FGF 2 in DNA repair, stem cells were exposed to FGF 2 pathway inhibitors. Blocking the FGF 2 receptor (FGF receptor 1) or the kinase (Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase 1) resulted in a inhibition of single and double DNA strand-break repair in the keratinocyte stem cells. Moreover, supplementing the progenitor cells with exogenous FGF 2 activated their DNA repair. We propose that, apart from its well-known role as a strong mitogen and prosurvival factor, FGF 2 helps to maintain genomic integrity in stem cells by activating stress-induced DNA repair.

40|$|Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} complex (MTBC), the causative {{agent of}} tuberculosis (TB), {{is characterized by}} low sequence diversity making this bacterium one of the classical examples of a genetically monomorphic pathogen. Because of this limited DNA sequence variation, routine genotyping of clinical MTBC isolates for epidemiological purposes relies on highly discriminatory DNA fingerprinting methods based on mobile and repetitive genetic elements. According to the standard view, isolates exhibiting the same fingerprinting pattern are considered <b>direct</b> <b>progeny</b> of the same bacterial clone, and most likely reflect ongoing transmission or disease relapse within individual patients. Here we further investigated this assumption and used massively parallel whole-genome sequencing to compare one drug-susceptible (K- 1) and one multidrug resistant (MDR) isolate (K- 2) of a rapidly spreading M. tuberculosis Beijing genotype clone from a high incidence region (Karakalpakstan, Uzbekistan). Both isolates shared the same IS 6110 RFLP pattern and the same allele at 23 out of 24 MIRU-VNTR loci. We generated 23. 9 million (K- 1) and 33. 0 million (K- 2) paired 50 bp purity filtered reads corresponding to a mean coverage of 483. 5 fold and 656. 1 fold respectively. Compared with the laboratory strain H 37 Rv both Beijing isolates shared 1, 209 SNPs. The two Beijing isolates differed by 130 SNPs and one large deletion. The susceptible isolate had 55 specific SNPs, while the MDR variant had 75 specific SNPs, including the five known resistance-conferring mutations. Our results suggest that M. tuberculosis isolates exhibiting identical DNA fingerprinting patterns can harbour substantial genomic diversity. Because this heterogeneity is not captured by traditional genotyping of MTBC, {{some aspects of the}} transmission dynamics of tuberculosis could be missed or misinterpreted. Furthermore, a valid differentiation between disease relapse and exogenous reinfection might be impossible using standard genotyping tools if the overall diversity of circulating clones is limited. These findings have important implications for clinical trials of new anti-tuberculosis drugs...|$|E
40|$|Radiation-induced {{pancytopenia}} {{proved to}} be a suitable model system in mice and rhesus monkeys for studying thrombopoietin (TPO) target cell range and efficacy. TPO was highly effective in rhesus monkeys exposed to the mid-lethal dose of 5 Gy (300 kV x-rays) TBI, a model in which it alleviated thrombocytopenia, promoted red cell reconstitution, accelerated reconstitution of immature CD 34 + bone marrow cells, and potentiated the response to growth factors such as GM-CSF and G-CSF. In contrast to the results in the 5 Gy TBI model, TPO was ineffective following transplantation of limited numbers of autologous bone marrow or highly purified stem cells in monkeys conditioned with 8 Gy TBI. In the 5 Gy model, a single dose of TPO augmented by GM-CSF 24 h after TBI was effective in preventing thrombocytopenia. The strong erythropoietic stimulation may result in iron depletion, and TPO treatment should be accompanied by monitoring of iron status. This preclinical evaluation thus identified TPO as a potential major therapeutic agent for counteracting radiation-induced pancytopenia and demonstrated pronounced stimulatory effects on the reconstitution of immature CD 34 + hemopoietic cells with multilineage potential. The latter observation explains the potentiation of the hematopoietic responses to G-CSF and GM-CSF when administered concomitantly. It also predicts the effective use of TPO to accelerate reconstitution of immature hematopoietic cells as well as possible synergistic effects in vivo with various other growth factors acting on immature stem cells and their <b>direct</b> lineage-committed <b>progeny.</b> The finding that a single dose of TPO might be sufficient for a clinically significant response emphasizes its potency and is of practical relevance. The heterogeneity of the TPO response encountered in the various models used for evaluation points to multiple mechanisms operating on the TPO response and heterogeneity of its target cells. Mechanistic mouse studies made apparent that the response of multilineage cells shortly after TBI to a single administration of TPO is quantitatively more important for optimal efficacy than the lineage-restricted response obtained at later intervals after TBI and emphasized the importance of a relatively high dose of TPO to overcome initial c-mpl-mediated clearance. Further elucidation of mechanisms determining efficacy might very well result in a further improvement, e. g., following transplantation of limited numbers of stem cells. Adverse effects of TPO administration to myelosuppressed or stem cell transplanted experimental animals were not observed...|$|R

Bacteriol. 88 : 865 – 876. 1964. —Nutritionally {{complementary}} auxotrophic mutants {{derived from}} Nocardia erythropolis did not yield prototrophic recombinants when progeny from mixed cultures or newly mixed strains were inoculated onto minimal medium. Similarly, complementary auxotrophic mutants of N. canicruria {{did not produce}} prototrophic recombinants. When interspecific mating was attempted between complementary mutants of N. erythropolis and N. canicruria, prototrophic recombinants were recovered at frequencies dependent, in part, upon the auxotrophic strains used in the test crosses. Growth of the parental types in mixed cultures was necessary {{for the production of}} recombinant <b>progeny.</b> <b>Direct</b> selection for recombinants by inoculating the selective medium with a mixture of parental types without prior mixed growth did not result in the recovery of recombinants. Varying the medium upon which mixed growth occurred, or varying the ratio of N. erythropolis to N. canicruria cells used as inocula, did not greatly affect the recovery of recombinants. Heat-killing {{one or the other of}} the parental types prevented recombinant production. The lack of recovery of recombinants from crosses of homologously derived strains suggested that a mating factor controls recombination. The mating factor was not eliminated by acriflavine treatment. The recovery of a recombinant strain capable of forming recombinants with either N. erythropolis or N. canicruria, and the recovery of another strain which mated only with N. erythropolis in backcrosses, suggests that the mating factor may be of a multiple nature...|$|R
40|$|Endogenous host topoisomerase II acts upon {{herpes simplex}} virus type 1 (HSV- 1) DNA in {{infected}} cells (S. N. Ebert, S. S. Shtrom, and M. T. Muller, J. Virol. 56 : 4059 - 4066, 1990), and cleavage is <b>directed</b> exclusively at <b>progeny</b> viral DNA while parental DNA is resistant. To evaluate the possibility that HSV- 1 induces topoisomerase II activity which {{could account for the}} preferential cleavage of progeny viral DNA, we assessed topoisomerase II cleavage activity on cellular and viral DNA substrates before and after the initiation of viral DNA replication. We show that cleavage of a host gene in mock-infected cells was similar to that observed in HSV- 1 -infected cells, regardless of whether viral DNA replication had occurred. In addition, quantitative measurements revealed comparable amounts of topoisomerase II activity in infected and mock-infected cells; thus, HSV- 1 neither induces nor encodes its own type II topoisomerase and cleavages in vivo are due to a preexisting host topoisomerase. Human cells contain two isozymes of topoisomerase II (p 170 and p 180), encoded by separate genes. Through the use of isozyme-specific antibodies, we demonstrate that only p 170 was found to be cross-linked to HSV- 1 DNA even though both forms were present at nearly constant levels in HSV- 1 -infected cells. Immunofluorescence revealed that by 6 h postinfection, p 170 becomes redistributed and localized to sites of active viral DNA synthesis. The data suggest that p 170 gains preferential access to replicated viral DNA molecules, which explains why topoisomerase II activity is concentrated on progeny DNA...|$|R
