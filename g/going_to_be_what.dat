He also said he turned down a 10-episode role in EastEnders because it was an [...] "obvious gangster bully" [...] who would be [...] "blown up by Phil Mitchell". Dyer also revealed that he was approached to play Carl White, but turned it down. He said, [...] "if I'd gone down that route, then I wouldn't be playing the role I am now." [...] Dyer confirmed on 19 October 2013 that he had already started filming his role, stating, [...] "I've already got my kit off for the cameras—we had a funny sex scene early on. But I don't get my bollocks out, you'll be glad to hear." [...] Richie, experienced at playing a landlord in the show, mentored Dyer and helped him on the pub set because he [...] "couldn't even open the f***ing till". He was also trained in how to use a beer engine. After Dyer had been filming for a month, he stated that he was [...] "bringing something to soap land that's never been seen before" [...] and said that taking over The Queen Victoria was [...] "a big responsibility" [...] that he was ready for, adding [...] "I don't want to let them down". He said that his character's entrance to the show was [...] "flawless, but it's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> you expect", and felt that he would have the same impact as original landlord Den Watts (Leslie Grantham). He also thought that his role would be controversial, because of the baggage that comes with him as an actor. Inside Soap said that the success of Mick, the Carter family and the pub all rest on Dyer's shoulders, of which Dyer said put pressure on him but he added that [...] "there should be pressure coming into a show like this. I didn't want to come in as some peripheral character". He hoped that people would find Mick believable and loveable.|$|E

A sense of strangeness dawned upon him. His home-coming, so ceaselessly dreamed of by night and longed for by day, was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> his hopes had created. But at that moment his joy was too great to harbor strange misgivings. How {{impossible}} for any one to understand his feelings then, except perhaps the comrades who had survived the same ordeal! ...|$|E

60|$|As Harry Annesley is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> is {{generally}} called {{the hero of}} this story, {{it is necessary that}} something should be said of the particulars of his life and existence up to this period. There will be found to be nothing very heroic about him. He is a young man with more than a fair allowance of a young man's folly;--it may also be said of a young man's weakness. But I myself am inclined to think that there was but little of a young man's selfishness, with nothing of falseness or dishonesty; and I am therefore tempted to tell his story.|$|E

And {{with only a}} little {{difference}} in events {{he might have been}} as important as Grandcourt, nay--her imagination inevitably went into that direction--might have held the very estates which Grandcourt was to have. But now, Deronda would probably some day see her mistress of the Abbey at Topping, see her bearing the title which would have been his own wife's. These obvious, futile thoughts of what might have been, made a new epoch for Gwendolen. She, whose unquestionable habit it had been to take the best that came to her for less than her own claim, had now to see the position which tempted her in a new light, as a hard, unfair exclusion of others. What she had now heard about Deronda seemed to her imagination to throw him into one group with Mrs. Glasher and her children; before whom she felt herself in an attitude of apology--she who had hitherto been surrounded by a group that in her opinion had need be apologetic to her. Perhaps Deronda himself was thinking of these things. Could he know of Mrs. Glasher? If he knew that she knew, he would despise her; but he could have no such knowledge. Would he, without that, despise her for marrying Grandcourt? His possible judgment of her actions was telling on her as importunately as Klesmer's judgment of her powers; but she found larger room for resistance to a disapproval of her marriage, because it is easier to make our conduct seem justifiable to ourselves than to make our ability strike others. [...] "How can I help it?" [...] is not our favorite apology for incompetency. But Gwendolen felt some strength in saying-- ...|$|E

If that is so then his voicing of moral qualms may be dishonest: his behaviour with Rosie (below) is evidence for this; the Narrator's reference to Goya's terrifying [...] "saurian rats", however, suggests that Briggs' impotence may have honest roots.|$|E
