25|$|But in 1951 I {{found myself}} in serious difficulty. I had been {{commissioned}} by the National Broadcasting Company to write an opera for television, with Christmas as deadline, and I simply didn't have one idea in my head. One November afternoon as I was walking rather gloomily through the rooms of the Metropolitan Museum, I chanced to {{stop in front of}} the Adoration of the Kings by Hieronymus Bosch, and as I was looking at it, suddenly I heard again, coming from the distant blue hills, the weird song of the Three Kings. I then realized they <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> me and had brought me a gift.|$|E
25|$|In 1979 {{the crash}} of American Airlines Flight 191 led to a global {{grounding}} of all DC-10s, stranding hundreds of passengers {{on both sides of}} Air New Zealand's Los Angeles–Auckland route. The airline chartered a Pan Am Boeing 747 to transport stranded passengers and to keep a shuttle service open. The airline's two remaining DC-8s maintained a trans-tasman shuttle service along with its single international standard equipped 737-200, ZK-NAR. The decision not to take up NAC's purchase rights of the trans-tasman capable Boeing 727-200 <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> haunt the airline. With no DC-8 replacement in sight Air New Zealand began looking for a mid-sized wide bodied jet and ordered the Boeing 767-200ER in 1983.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{high hopes}} that the Red Sox would finally vanquish their nemesis from the Bronx, the series started disastrously for them. Curt Schilling pitched with the torn tendon sheath in his right ankle he had {{suffered}} in Game 1 of the Division Series against Anaheim, and was routed for six runs in three innings. Yankee starter Mike Mussina had six perfect innings, and held an 8–0 lead. Despite the Sox' best effort to come back (they scored seven runs to make it 8–7), they ended up losing 10–7. In Game 2, already with his Yankees leading 1–0 {{for most of the}} game, John Olerud hit a two-run home run to put the New York team up for good. The Sox were soon down three games to none after a 19–8 loss in Game 3 at home. In that game, the two clubs set the record for most runs scored in a League Championship Series game. At that point in the history of baseball, no team <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> win from a 3–0 series deficit (only the 1998 Atlanta Braves and 1999 New York Mets had ever gotten as far as a Game 6).|$|E
25|$|In September 1609, the Japanese {{survivors}} of the Macau affair of 1608 <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> tell their version of events to their lord Arima Harunobu, and the news was reported to Ieyasu. The ex-shogun reprimanded Hasegawa for trying to hide the matter, and ordered {{him to make a}} full investigation. Hasegawa drew up a lengthy report taking the side of Arima, who wanted revenge for his men, saying the Macau affidavits had been attained by the Portuguese under duress and should be considered void. Both Hasegawa and Arima advocated for the forcible takeover of the Nossa Senhora da Graça and its cargo, but Ieyasu was hesitant on this point since such a move could endanger the annual Nagasaki-Macau trade. The final push Ieyasu needed came unexpectedly, when a Spanish ship sailing from Manila to Mexico was wrecked off the coast of eastern Japan in the same month. When Ieyasu received the Spanish survivors in his court at Sunpu, he asked their leader Rodrigo de Vivero y Aberrucia, the newly replaced governor of the Philippines, if the Spaniards could supply the bulk of silk imports to Japan like the Portuguese. Aberrucia rashly replied that they could easily send three ships to Japan yearly. Ieyasu, now convinced that he could replace the Portuguese merchants with the Spaniards, the Dutch, and his own red seal ships, ordered Hasegawa and Arima to arrest Pessoa at all costs.|$|E
500|$|Reaction to the Rhoads {{scandal and}} {{controversy}} was mixed in the United States, {{in part due}} to the Rockefeller campaign. Starr says (in his 2003 article on the scandal) that Rhoads' colleagues did not believe the researcher's attempt to cast his letter as a [...] "fantastic and playful composition...intended as a parody." [...] Some were worried about Rhoads' mental health at the time. A superior dismissed the incident as a case of local ingratitude. Time magazine headlined the incident as [...] "Porto Ricochet"; Starr suggests they meant that Rhoads's humanitarian work in Puerto Rico <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> bite him.|$|E

When I saw the {{photographs}} (of Lowe's body parts), {{it made me feel}} sick." [...] He maintained that he had killed Lowe after the latter made homosexual advances that caused him to [...] "freak out"; he had previously fended off homosexual attacks twice while imprisoned: in Israel in 1978, and in England in 1994. When Deputy Public Prosecutors Jennifer Marie and Norul Rashid asked him what he did after killing Lowe, he said that he could not remember anything because he had drunk heavily and consumed Valium after Lowe's death until he was arrested. He repeated that he had not killed the Damudes, and that he <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Singapore from Phuket to clear his conscience about Lowe's death.|$|E
500|$|On January 24, 1923 Forbes awarded Hurley-Mason Construction {{a sizable}} {{contract}} of $1,300,000 {{to construct a}} new veterans' hospital at American Lake, near Tacoma. Forbes had resigned his vice presidency at Hurley-Mason Construction upon assuming his federal position under the Harding Administration. By January 1923, rumor was spread by Forbes's close friends that Forbes would resign from the Veterans' Bureau on June 1, 1923. During the summer of 1922 on one of Forbes's [...] "joy rides", Forbes <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Spokane and visited the F. Lewis Clark House while {{he was looking for}} a possible site for a veterans' hospital at Hayden Lake, Idaho. Forbes was accompanied by Dr. Stanley Rhinehart. The F. Lewis Clark House was one of the most prestigious summer homes in the Pacific Northwest; it had been offered to Forbes and the Veterans' Bureau at a low cost. Colonel Forbes stayed there for several days. The Spokane division office of Hurley-Mason Construction had been closed down.|$|E
2500|$|An {{interest}} in Montessori had existed in India since 1913, when an Indian student attended {{the first international}} course in Rome, and students throughout the 1920s and 1930s <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> India to start schools and promote Montessori education. [...] The Montessori Society of India was formed in 1926, and Il Metodo was translated into Gujarati and Hindi in 1927. By 1929, Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore had founded many [...] "Tagore-Montessori" [...] schools in India, and [...] Indian {{interest in}} Montessori education [...] was [...] strongly represented at the International Congress in 1929. Montessori herself had been personally associated with the Theosophical Society since 1907. [...] The Theosophical movement, motivated to educate India's poor, was drawn to Montessori education as one solution.|$|E

2500|$|His {{original}} {{portrayal of}} the character in The Silence of the Lambs has been labelled by the AFI as the number-one film villain. At {{the time he was}} offered the role, Hopkins was making a return to the London stage, performing in M. Butterfly. He <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Britain after living {{for a number of years}} in Hollywood, having all but given up on a career there, saying, [...] "Well that part of my life's over; it's a chapter closed. I suppose I'll just have to settle for being a respectable actor poncing around the West End and doing respectable BBC work for the rest of my life." [...] Hopkins played the iconic villain in adaptations of the first three of the Lecter novels by Thomas Harris. The author was reportedly very pleased with Hopkins' portrayal of his antagonist. However, Hopkins stated that Red Dragon would feature his final performance as the character, and that he would not reprise even a narrative role in the latest addition to the series, Hannibal Rising.|$|E
2500|$|The {{dominant}} {{interpretation of}} the buddha-kami relationship came to be questioned by what modern scholars call the [...] or [...] paradigm, a theology that reversed the original theory and gave the most importance to the kami. Supporters of the theory believed that, while those who have achieved buddhahood have acquired enlightenment, a kami shines of his own light. The doctrine was first developed by Tendai monks, and its first full formulation is attributed to Jihen, a monk tied to the great Ise shrine who was most active around 1340. In the first fascicle of the Kuji hongi gengi he argued that, in the beginning, Japan had only kami and that only later did buddhas take over. He believed that for this reason {{there had been a}} decadence in the country's morals and that a world where kami dominated would soon reappear. In the fifth fascicle of the same work, he compared Japan to a seed, China to a branch and India to a flower or fruit. Just like flowers that fall and return to the roots, India <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> its roots, the kami were the honji and the buddhas their manifestations.|$|E
2500|$|Delhomme {{started out}} Carolina's ensuing drive with a 13-yard {{completion}} to wide receiver Muhsin Muhammad. [...] After committing a false start penalty {{on the next}} play, Delhomme completed a pair of passes to Smith for gains of 18 and 22 yards. Running back DeShaun Foster then scored on a 33-yard touchdown run, cutting the Panthers' deficit to 21–16 after Delhomme's 2-point conversion pass fell incomplete. The Patriots responded on their ensuing possession by driving {{all the way to}} Carolina's 9-yard line, but the drive ended when Panthers defensive back Reggie Howard intercepted a third down pass from Brady in the end zone. Then on 3rd down from his own 15-yard line, Delhomme threw for the longest play from scrimmage in Super Bowl history, an 85-yard touchdown completion to Muhammad. Carolina's 2-point conversion attempt failed again, but they took their first lead of the game, 22–21, with 6:53 remaining. It {{was the first time in}} Super Bowl history a team down 10+ points during the 4th quarter <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> take the lead. Three other times teams have come back to tie the game; the Tennessee Titans against the Rams in Super Bowl XXXIV, the Rams against the Patriots in Super Bowl XXXVI, and the Patriots against the Falcons in Super Bowl LI.|$|E

2500|$|The series started {{very poorly}} for the Red Sox. Schilling, {{pitching}} with an injured ankle, was routed for six runs in three innings. [...] Yankees starter Mike Mussina had six perfect innings, and despite Boston's {{best efforts to}} come back, they ended up losing 10–7. [...] In Game 2, with his Yankees leading 1–0 {{for most of the}} game, John Olerud hit a two-run home run to put New York up for good. Following this, the Red Sox were down three games to none after a crushing 19–8 loss in Game 3 at home. In that game, the two clubs set the record for most runs scored in a League Championship Series game. At that point in the history of baseball, no team <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> win from a 3–0 series deficit. In Game 4, the Red Sox found themselves facing elimination, trailing 4–3 in the ninth with Yankees closer Mariano Rivera on the mound. After Rivera issued a walk to Kevin Millar, Dave Roberts came on to pinch run [...] and promptly stole second base. He then scored on an RBI single by Bill Mueller which sent the game to extra innings. The Red Sox {{went on to win the}} game on a two-run home run by David Ortiz in the 12th inning. In Game 5, the Red Sox were again down late (by the score of 4–2) as a result of Derek Jeter's bases-clearing triple. But the Sox struck back in the eighth, as Ortiz hit a homer over the Green Monster to bring the Sox within a run. Then Jason Varitek hit a sacrifice fly to bring home Dave Roberts, scoring the tying run. The game would go for 14 innings, featuring many squandered opportunities on both sides. In the bottom of the 14th, Ortiz would again seal the win with an RBI single that brought home Damon. The 14-inning game set the record for the longest American League Championship Series game ever played.|$|E
