5|$|Grills {{are made}} of several types of metal (often silver, gold or platinum) that are {{sometimes}} <b>inlaid</b> with precious stones; they are generally removable, though some may be permanently attached to the teeth. Gold grills {{can be made from}} 10-karat, up to 24-karat gold. The gold can be tinted yellow, white and rose color.|$|E
5|$|He {{engaged in}} {{different}} forms of art. In 1891, three of his oil paintings were exhibited at the Marlborough Gallery and in May 1904, a carved <b>inlaid</b> tray Stanley had made was shown at the Stanley Art Exhibition Club. He also enjoyed composing partsongs, painting, playing music and photography.|$|E
5|$|The four-storey {{building}} is externally austere. A freestanding cube, the main façade faces Republic Square and is <b>inlaid</b> with Karst marble, with green Oplotnica granite below each window. The only decorative element is the two storey main portal – four oak doors surrounded by statues by Zdenko Kalin and Karel Putrih which represent working people.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{innovations}} of Felice Beato and Baron Raimund von Stillfried, Farsari {{further developed the}} trade in photograph albums. His studio generally produced sepia monochrome albumen prints that were hand-coloured and mounted on album leaves. These pages were often hand decorated and bound between covers of silk brocade or lacquer boards <b>inlaid</b> with ivory, mother-of-pearl and gold. Like his contemporaries, Farsari usually captioned and numbered his photographs in the images, often in white lettering on a black background.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} was originally <b>inlaid</b> with precious and semi-precious stones. It reflects {{a mixture of}} contemporary traditions {{at the time of}} its construction, with a sloping-roof based on a Bengali style, and a baldachin from Europe, which makes evident the imperial as well as religious function of the pavilion. The marble shades of the pavilion are capped with merlons to hide view from the grounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{types of}} {{clothing}} worn and {{the materials used}} during the Han period depended upon social class. Wealthy folk could afford silk robes, skirts, socks, and mittens, coats made of badger or fox fur, duck plumes, and slippers with <b>inlaid</b> leather, pearls, and silk lining. Peasants commonly wore clothes made of hemp, wool, and ferret skins.|$|E
5|$|Bronze mirrors {{arrived to}} Japan from China {{as early as}} the Yayoi period and {{continued}} to be imported through the Tang Dynasty (618–907). During that period mirrors cast in Japan were imitations of Chinese prototypes and subsequently Japanese designs were established. All of these mirrors were generally circular, with a polished front, and a back decorated with molded or engraved reliefs, sometimes <b>inlaid</b> with gold or silver. Three mirrors or sets of mirrors decorated with floral and animal motifs have been designated as National Treasures.|$|E
5|$|Colt was {{the first}} American {{manufacturer}} to use art as a marketing tool when he hired Catlin to prominently display Colt firearms in his paintings. He was awarded numerous government contracts after making gifts of his highly embellished and engraved revolvers with exotic grips such as ivory or pearl to government officials. On a trip to Constantinople he gave a custom-engraved and gold <b>inlaid</b> revolver to the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire Abdülmecid I, informing him that the Russians were buying his pistols, thus securing a Turkish order for 5,000 pistols; he neglected to tell the Sultan he had used the same tactic with the Russians to elicit an order.|$|E
5|$|For the poor, hemp was {{the common}} item {{used to make}} clothing, while the rich could afford silk clothes. Silk clothes found in Han tombs include padded robes, {{double-layered}} robes, single-layered robes, single-layered skirts, shoes, socks, and mittens. The wealthy also wore fox and badger furs, wild duck plumes, and slippers with <b>inlaid</b> leather or silk lining; those of more modest means could wear wool and ferret skins. Large bamboo-matted suitcases found in Han tombs contained clothes and luxury items such as patterned fabric and embroidery, common silk, damask and brocade, and the leno (or gauze) weave, all with rich colors and designs. The Han also had tools for ironing clothes.|$|E
5|$|Hillsboro's Civic Center is {{a modern}} glass {{building}} with a stone base and brick highlights. There are two main buildings, the Civic Center housing government offices and the Plaza Building housing retail space. The plazas surrounding the structures contain an <b>inlaid</b> quartzite river, basalt planters, and Victorian style benches. Additionally, it was designed with large windows facing the north in order to reflect the giant sequoia trees located {{across the street at}} the Washington County Courthouse, with the trees dating back to the 1880s.|$|E
5|$|Karan Mahal (Public Audience Hall) {{was built}} by Karan Singh in c.1680 to mark his victory over the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. It is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most exquisite palaces built with gardens, which displays the aesthetic sensibilities of the royalty of Rajasthan. It has stained glass windows and intricately carved balconies built in stone and wood fluted columns. Later Rajas, Anup Singh and Surat Singh, also added lot of glitter to this palace with <b>inlaid</b> polychrome glass, intricate mirror patterns, and red and gold paint. In the coronation chamber, there is a shored up alcove, which was used as a throne.|$|E
5|$|Khwabgah was {{the bedroom}} of Shah Jahan. It {{was built by}} Shah Jahan under the {{supervision}} of Wazir Khan in 1634 during his first visit to the city. Five sleeping chambers are aligned in a single row. The chambers feature carved marble screens, and are decorated with <b>inlaid</b> white marble and frescoes, It is the first building built by Shah Jahan in the fort. At present its decorations have vanished except for a trace of the marble which once might have beautified the façade.|$|E
5|$|Mother-of-pearl or nacre is the {{naturally}} occurring lustrous layer that lines some mollusc shells. It {{is used to}} make pearl buttons and in artisan craftwork to make organic jewellery. It has traditionally been <b>inlaid</b> into furniture and boxes, particularly in China. It {{has been used to}} decorate musical instruments, watches, pistols, fans and other products. The import and export of goods made with nacre are controlled in many countries under the International Convention of Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.|$|E
5|$|Sicilian church exteriors {{had been}} {{decorated}} in elaborate styles {{from the first}} quarter of the 17th century, with profuse use of sculpture, stucco, frescoes, and marble (Illustration 14). As the post-earthquake churches were becoming completed in the late 1720s, interiors also began to reflect this external decoration, becoming lighter and less intense (compare illustration 14 to the later interior of illustration 15), with profuse sculpted ornamentation of pillars, cornices, and pediments, often in the form of putti, flora, and fauna. <b>Inlaid</b> coloured marbles on floors and walls in complex patterns are one of the most defining features of the style. These patterns with their roundels of porphyry are often derived from designs found in the Norman cathedrals of Europe, again demonstrating the Norman origins of Sicilian architecture. The high altar is usually the pièce de resistance: in many instances a single block of coloured marble, decorated with gilt scrolls and swags, and frequently inset with other stones such as lapis lazuli and agate. Steps leading to the altar dais are characteristically curving between concave and convex and in many cases decorated with <b>inlaid</b> coloured marbles. One of the finest examples of this is in the church of St Zita in Palermo.|$|E
5|$|The Seri Rambai is a 28-pounder, 127.5 inches (3.25m) {{long with}} a calibre of 6.1 inches; (15cm); the barrel {{measures}} 118.75 inches; (3.02 m). It {{was cast in}} 1603 and is the largest bronze gun in Malaysia. In front of the dolphin handles is a decorative band featuring three pairs of heraldic lions with long, spiralling tails. Each pair faces a vase containing flowers. Between the handles and the Dutch East India Company's seal is a Javi inscription, <b>inlaid</b> with silver, celebrating the gun's capture in 1613. The base ring is incised with the gunsmith's signature and date of manufacture.|$|E
5|$|The {{library is}} on the right of the hall, removed from the other rooms; it once held a billiard table. The walls are lined with tall bookcases {{containing}} rare books; the walls were otherwise covered in large square panel-like pieces of leather. The room has a richly coffered ceiling and had green and brown curtains. The house has bedrooms of various sizes, most large, with Mrs. Shepard's the biggest. Each room has distinct furnishings and from moderate to rich decoration. One particular was the Moorish room, furnished in the Moorish style, with mantel and furniture <b>inlaid</b> with mother of pearl. The third floor had bedrooms, a children's suite and a large playroom.|$|E
5|$|The {{two arms}} of the {{cruciform}} plan contains different thrones for use in different royal functions; these included the Mother-of-Pearl Throne (พระแท่นราชบัลลังก์ประดับมุก) which stands almost at {{the centre of the}} hall between the intersecting points of the four arms. The square-shaped throne is entirely <b>inlaid</b> with mother-of-pearl, dating from the reign of King Rama I. It was saved from the Amarinthara Pisek Maha Prasat, when the throne hall burnt down in 1789. The throne is topped by the Royal Nine-tiered Umbrella.|$|E
5|$|An {{inventory}} {{drawn up}} at the Hôtel de la Reine after Catherine's death shows her {{to have been a}} keen collector. Listed works of art included tapestries, hand-drawn maps, sculptures, rich fabrics, ebony furniture <b>inlaid</b> with ivory, sets of china, and Limoges pottery. There were also hundreds of portraits, for which a vogue had developed during Catherine's lifetime. Many portraits in her collection were by Jean Clouet (1480–1541) and his son François Clouet (1572). François Clouet drew and painted portraits of all Catherine's family and of many members of the court. After Catherine's death, a decline in the quality of French portraiture set in. By 1610, the school patronised by the late Valois court and brought to its pinnacle by François Clouet had all but died out.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Bushka rings, various other decorative rings were commonly incorporated, including various colored plastics (often marbleized), and silver and contrasting wooden rings. For decoration, Balabushka often <b>inlaid</b> small mother-of-pearl dots and notched diamonds. Series of window-shaped maple pieces commonly adorned Balabushka butt sleeves, with each window usually featuring one burl for its aesthetic effect. Some other features common {{to many other}} cuemakers' lines from the same era are notably absent or mostly absent from Balabushka's, including ivory inlays and the signing of his cues. A long-standing controversy exists over what finish Balabushka used. One side argues that he used an oil finish on all his cues, while the other insists that his later cues were coated with a spray lacquer.|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} the Presiding Officers' desk is the {{parliamentary}} mace, which is made from silver and <b>inlaid</b> with gold panned from Scottish rivers and inscribed with the words: Wisdom, Compassion, Justice and Integrity. The words There shall be a Scottish Parliament, which are the first words of the Scotland Act, are inscribed around {{the head of the}} mace, which has a ceremonial role in the meetings of Parliament, representing the authority of the Parliament to make laws. Presented to the Scottish Parliament by the Queen upon Parliament's official opening in July 1999, the mace is displayed in a glass case, suspended from the lid. At the beginning of each sitting in the chamber, the lid of the case is rotated so that the mace is above the glass, to symbolise that a full meeting of the Parliament is taking place.|$|E
5|$|The first {{room from}} the {{corridor}} was the living room, with a wainscot, pilasters, cornice, and door and window frames all of Spanish cedar, and a mantelpiece imported from an Italian chateau. Walls are paneled in green silk, mirroring the rug and furnishings. In its early history, the walls were <b>inlaid</b> with embossed Italian leather. The drawing room, {{sometimes referred to as}} the music room, salon, or parlor was at the center, with paneled walls in ivory white and gold, with gilded moldings and ornaments. There are richly interlaced panels above the doorways with paintings inserted in them. The mantle dates to around 1700, and is of mottled purple and white marble, and has a built-in mirror above it. The room has richly gilt chandeliers hanging from ornamental reliefs in the otherwise plain ceiling. Furniture was of tapestry and gold, with a light rug and yellow and gold curtains at the windows and doors.|$|E
5|$|The {{jewellery}} {{consists of}} three gold pendants, two glass beads, one gold wire bead, and a fragment of a jet hair pin. The pendants and beads all {{seem to have been}} strung together, probably forming a necklace that was in place around the neck of the body. Two of the pieces consist of gold cabochon pendants inset with jewels, while the third is a very elaborate shield-shaped jewel <b>inlaid</b> with 57 red garnets and a larger scallop-shaped gem in the centre. The garnets rest on a thin layer of gold leaf to reflect the light and increase their luminosity. It may have been created from recycled older pieces of jewellery, as the size, shape and thickness of the individuals garnet are all different.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Gedi's structures were domestic residences made of thatched-roofed mud buildings concentrated between the outer and inner walls; however, the only buildings that survived {{to the present}} were constructed using coral stones extracted from the Indian Ocean. Although several of the buildings predate the fourteenth century, coral became a more common construction material for important structures and elite residences during that time period. All of the buildings at Gedi are single-story structures. The walls and other coral structures were constructed {{in a similar manner}} using lime mortar, with most foundations no greater than one foot in depth and filled with stones. Where foundations were used, they tended to be no wider than the wall they supported. There are several examples of non-utilitarian design elements. Doorways for the buildings consist of square framed pointed archways, with tombs and mosques containing spandrels and architraves that have been carved or <b>inlaid</b> with porcelain.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} form of decoration is relief. Relief became more extensive over time, and in late temples, walls, ceilings, columns, and beams were all decorated, as were free-standing stelae erected within the enclosure. Egyptian artists used both bas relief and sunken relief. Bas relief allowed more subtle artistry but involved more carving than sunken relief. Sunken relief was therefore used on harder, more difficult stone {{and when the}} builders wanted to finish quickly. It was also appropriate for exterior surfaces, where the shadows it created made the figures stand out in bright sunlight. Finished reliefs were painted using the basic colors black, white, red, yellow, green, and blue, although the artists often mixed pigments to create other colors. In some cases, gilding or <b>inlaid</b> pieces of colored glass or faience substituted for paint.|$|E
5|$|The only intact public rooms {{remaining}} {{in either the}} stern or bow sections are the First-Class Reception Room and Dining Saloon, both on D-Deck. Most of the Dining Saloon has collapsed because of its proximity to the break-up point midships, but the very forward part is accessible and the rectangular leaded glass windows, table bases, and ceiling lamps are noticeably preserved. The Reception Room with its leaded glass windows and mahogany paneling remains remarkably intact, although the ceiling is sagging {{and there is a}} deep layer of silt obstructing the floor. The Turkish Baths on F-Deck were found to be in excellent condition during their rediscovery in 2005, preserving the blue-green tiles, carved teak woodwork, bronze lamps, and <b>inlaid</b> furniture. The Grand Staircase was very likely destroyed during the sinking, but the surrounding First-Class foyers and elevator entrances preserve many of the ormolu and crystal lamps, oak timbers, and oak-framed stanchions.|$|E
5|$|The {{pavilion}} is rectangular in shape, {{situated in}} the west of Sheesh Mahal, and is prominent because of its centrally arched and extraordinarily curved roof. This unique feature is symbolic of Shajahani architecture. It reflects a mixture of contemporary traditions (at {{the time of its}} construction) of sloping-roof from Bengal, and Baldachin from Europe. This demonstrates the imperial as well as religious image of the subject. The original roof was probably gilded. The inner walls are minutely <b>inlaid</b> with precious and semi-precious stones and silver with delicate parchin kari ornamentation are considered among the finest in the world.Glazed tile mosaics have been used to decorate the spandrels of the arched openings with floral designs and images of angels, genies, and solomonic symbols. The marble screens of the pavilion are crowned with merlons to prevent inmates being seen from the grounds in between the Fort and the river. The overall quadrangle comprises private quarters for royal family and closely resembles Agra fort.|$|E
5|$|White owned {{a number}} of {{antiques}} and pieces of furniture of historical interest. Among these were items once possessed by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron including a pair of andirons with heavy brass heads and a fender, possibly used at Lord Fairfax's Greenway Court estate. White also had a richly <b>inlaid</b> table made of several types of wood, which once belonged to his grandfather, Virginia judge Robert White. Beneath the table's framework was pasted a small slip of paper on which Robert White signed his name and the date, 1789. Historian Hu Maxwell noted the similarity between the handwriting of White, his father John Baker White, and his grandfather Robert White. White also owned a sugar bowl from Switzerland that had originated in China and {{had been in the}} possession of the Streit and White families for over two centuries.|$|E
5|$|Construction resumed in 1879 {{under the}} {{direction}} of Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Lincoln Casey of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Casey redesigned the foundation, strengthening it so it could support a structure that ultimately weighed more than 40,000 tons. The first stone atop the unfinished stump was laid August 7, 1880 in a small ceremony attended by President Rutherford B. Hayes, Casey and a few others. The president placed a small coin on which he had scratched his initials and the date in the bed of wet cement at the 150-foot level before the first stone was laid on top of it. Casey found 92 memorial stones (presented stones) already <b>inlaid</b> into the interior walls of the first phase of construction. Before construction continued he temporarily removed eight stones at the 150-foot level so that the walls at that level could be sloped outward, producing thinner second-phase walls. He inserted those stones and most of the remaining memorial stones stored in the lapidarium into the interior walls during 1885–89. The bottom third of the monument is a slightly lighter shade {{than the rest of the}} construction because the marble was obtained from different quarries.|$|E
5|$|Oregon's House {{chamber floor}} {{is covered with}} a custom carpet; the carpet's pattern {{incorporates}} a depiction of the state tree, Douglas-fir, representative of forestry. The furniture and paneling of the chamber is made of golden oak. A large mural painted by Faulkner, depicting the 1843 Champoeg Meetings at which the provisional government was formed, is behind the desk of the Speaker of the House. The Senate chambers use black walnut for the paneling and furniture. Another custom carpet lines the floor, featuring Chinook salmon and wheat, representative of fishing and agriculture. The Senate's large mural was painted by Schwarz and depicts a street scene showing news of statehood reaching Salem. Lining the walls of both chambers are 158 names, inscribed in friezes, of prominent people in Oregon's history. On {{the second floor of the}} capitol is the Governor's suite, consisting of a ceremonial office and private offices for the state's chief executive. As in the Senate chamber, the paneling is of black walnut. The ceremonial office includes a fireplace with a painting by Faulkner. In the suite's reception area is a table made of 40 tree species. This table is <b>inlaid</b> with a replica of Oregon's second capitol building, the state flower (Oregon-grape), and the state bird (western meadowlark).|$|E
5|$|The HTC One uses a unibody {{aluminum}} frame sourced from custom-grade aluminum; {{the choice of}} material was intended to give the device a solid, premium feel in comparison to smartphones made with a plastic shell. The frame is etched with channels in which the polycarbonate is inset using zero-gap injection molding. The polycarbonate forms a band {{around the edge of}} the device, covers the top and bottom ends, and bisects the back with two lines, one of which flows around the camera below. The two polycarbonate bands across the back are used to insulate its antennas, while the ring around the camera is used as a loop antenna for the One's near field communication (NFC) functionality. Alongside its display are two aluminum endpieces with a tight grid of laser-cut holes forming the speaker grilles behind which sit two stereo sound speakers; the metal volume keys are smoothly <b>inlaid</b> on the left side of the frame. The unibody frame itself takes at least 200 minutes of precision CNC cutting to machine, and the final result is a solid slate of anodized aluminum, white polycarbonate, and tempered glass with chamfered, polished edges.|$|E
