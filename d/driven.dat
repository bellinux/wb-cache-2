5|$|Phreatomagmatic eruptions are eruptions {{that arise}} from {{interactions}} between water and magma.

5|$|Submarine {{volcanism}} is <b>driven</b> {{by various}} processes.

Eruptions associated with subducting zones, meanwhile, are <b>driven</b> by subducting plates that add volatiles to the rising plate, lowering its melting point. Each process generates different rock; mid-ocean ridge volcanics are primarily basaltic, whereas subduction flows are mostly calc-alkaline, and more explosive and viscous.|$|E

5|$|A pond {{is a body}} of {{standing}} water, either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a lake. A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including water gardens designed for aesthetic ornamentation, fish ponds designed for commercial fish breeding, and solar ponds designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via current speed. While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally <b>driven</b> micro-currents and moderate wind <b>driven</b> currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as stream pools and tide pools.|$|E
