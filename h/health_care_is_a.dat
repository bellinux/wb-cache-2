25|$|In Canada, <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{responsibility}} of the provinces. In the province of Ontario, the price of hearing aids is partially reimbursed through the Assistive Devices Program of the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, up to $500 for each hearing aid. Like eye appointments, audiological appointments are no longer covered through the provincial public health plan. Audiometric testing can still easily be obtained, often free of charge, in private sector hearing aid clinics and some ear, nose and throat doctors offices. Hearing aids may be covered to some extent by private insurance {{or in some cases}} through government programs such as Veterans Affairs Canada or Workplace Safety & Insurance Board.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{have argued}} that <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{fundamental}} human right.

2500|$|The left-of-center/liberal-leaning Urban Institute (UI) largely {{agreed with}} Moore {{regarding}} {{the need for}} a universal health care system and failure of the current system.

Overall, Blumberg stated that [...] "Americans as a whole have yet to buy the philosophy that <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> right and not a privilege" [...] and if Moore succeeded in popularizing the idea, he [...] "will have done the country a tremendous service."

2500|$|In {{the history}} of every profession, there is {{a period in which}} a diverse group of {{practitioners}} work in various ways to [...] "consolidate authority". [...] For medicine, this period is best known for the Flexner Report (1910) that rated medical schools and gave a major boost to the AMA leadership and elite physicians who were trying to upgrade and standardize medical education. [...] Educational standards for admission into the profession went along with earlier reorganization of the professional association—the AMA—to incorporate all practicing physicians (grandfathering in those who did not meet current standards), and a previous growth in state licensing that provided the legal authority for professional practice. [...] For some professions consolidation never happens: [...] nursing has spent a century debating educational standards, divided in identity, torn between being a labor force and a profession. [...] In 1984, former Congressman (FL) Paul Rogers noted in his introductory essay to a volume on Advocacy in Health Care, [...] "Advocacy in <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> calling many of us have pursued—one way or another—for many years.
