Lamarck {{beta-carotene}} rich, {{has been}} included in the most vulnerable population’s diet with the purpose of reducing health disturbances associated with <b>hipovitaminosis.</b> Aims:To evaluate a physical and chemical analysis of total carotenes and beta-carotene and to determine the antioxidant potential as well as to carry out a sensorial analysis of the bio-fortified Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lamarck (BDB) in nature and processed. Methods: BDB was processed as sweet (in natura, paste and syrup) and physicochemical characteristics were compared, total carotenoids, beta-carotene, antioxidant activity (DPPH) and microbiological and sensory analyses were performed. Results:The analysis of total carotenoids, beta-carotene and anti-oxidant potential showed the following results: BDB in nature – 11. 81 mg/ 100 g/ 440. 5 mg/ 100 g/ 26. 30...|$|E
40|$|Vitamin D {{deficiency}} {{is present}} even in sunny regions. Ageing decreases pre-vitamin D {{production in the}} skin and is associated with altered cytokine profile. We performed a multivariate analysis considering lifestyle factors, anthropometric, and inflammatory markers according to seasonal variation in Mexican healthy older adults. The same cohort was followed during 12 months. Vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency was found in 91. 3 % of the subjects despite living in appropriate latitude (25 ° 40 ′ 0 ″N). 25 (OH) D levels remained below 74 years) combined with WC (> 88 [*]cm) and BMI (> 32. 7) showed a high probability (90 %) of vitamin D deficiency. Remarkably, an increase in one centimeter in WC decreased 25 (OH) D by 0. 176 [*]ng/mL, while an increase in one point BMI decreased 25 (OH) D by 0. 534 [*]ng/mL. A cutoff point of 74 years of age determined probability of vitamin D <b>hipovitaminosis.</b> Vitamin D deficiency was correlated with TNF-α serum levels, possibly increasing the susceptibility of older adults to a proinflammatory state and its related diseases...|$|E

Objetivos: Analizar los niveles de vitamina D (vit. D) en un colectivo de trabajadores sanitarios. Material y métodos: Estudio descriptivo. Se analizaron mediante un inmunoensayo quimioluminiscente de micropartículas (CLIA), el analito 25 OH vit. D, y la Parathormona (PTH). Para el análisis bivariante se aplicó una chi cuadrado y la t-Student. La significación se consideró p Introduction: In {{recent years}} have {{appeared}} {{a large number of}} scientific evidence of the high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in the general population. Objectives: To analyze the levels of vit. D in a group of health workers. Methods: Descriptive study. Were analyzed by through microparticles chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA), the analyte 25 OH vit. D and Parathormone (PTHi). For the bivariate analysis chi-square an Student's t test was applied. Significance was considered p < 0. 05. Subsequently, it was performed a logistic regression (L. R.) whose measure of association was the odds ratio (OR). It has built two models, one considering deficit vit. D levels below 30 ng / ml, and another to levels, below 20 ng / ml. Results: It has been observed a prevalence of hipoavitaminosis D, of 84. 9 % (80. 8 % - 89. 1 %). Variables sunbathing or UVA in the last month together with PTHi levels, are the variables that are associated with hypovitaminosis Interestingly, when constructing LR model will cut at 20 ng / ml, sun exposure is the only significant variable. Conclusions: There is a very high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in the health worker population studied. PTH has an odd behavior according with vit. D cutoff considered...|$|E

Materiales y métodos: estudio retrospectivo, en donde se detectó, entre los reportes del Laboratorio de Hormonas del Hospital San Juan de Dios, a 17 pacientes con niveles de 25 -hidroxivitamina D (25 (OH) VD) en rangos subnormales (Objective: To {{describe}} for {{the first}} time in Costa Rica, the clinical characteristics of patients with Hypovitaminosis D. Materials and methods: Retrospective study, in which 17 patients with subnormal levels of 25 -hydroxivitamin D 25 (OH) VD (< 75 nmol/L) were identified amongst the reports from the Hormone Laboratory at the San Juan de Dios Hospital. Also, 15 controls with normal levels, and similar age and gender were identified. Results: There was no difference in age (52. 76 ± 20. 88 years in cases vs. 46. 33 ± 12. 50 in controls), gender (58. 85 % in cases vs. 80 % in controls were females). In the group with Hypovitaminosis, mean levels of 25 (OH) VD(59. 2 ± 10. 37 nmol/L) were lower and those of PTH were higher (146. 86 ± 103. 76 vs. 47. 82 ± 13. 77 ng/ml in controls, p= 0. 004). There was no difference in calcium levels (8. 98 cases vs. 9. 38 mg/dl controls p=. 352), phosphorus (4. 09 cases vs. 2. 99 mg/ dl controls p=. 104) nor BMD at hip and lumbar spine. There were no differences in the prevalence of nephrotic syndrome, chronic liver failure, chronic renal disease and of sun block use between both groups. There were no hospitalized patients in either group. Subjects with hypovitaminosis on the cases group indicated an average of 0. 6 hours of sun exposure per week, compared with 1. 46 in the control group (p= 0. 297). In the cases group, we observed a higher prevalence of falls (23. 5 % vs. 6. 7 % p= 0. 039), fractures (17. 6 % vs. 0 %, p= 0. 024), diabetes (17. 6 % vs. 6. 7 % p= 0, 158), fatigue (29. 4 % vs. 13. 3 % p= 0. 012), weakness (41. 2 % vs. 33 % p= 0. 010), and use of inducers of cytochrome P 450 pathway (29. 3 % vs. 0 % p= 0. 009). Body weight was less in cases with deficiency of 25 (OH) VD (26. 6 % with overweight or obesity vs. 66. 7 % p= 0. 009). Conclusions: Hypovitaminosis D may occur in tropical countries, such as Costa Rica. It is characterized by higher levels of PTH, low body weight, a high number off alls and fractures, fatigue, weakness, diabetes and use of inducers of liver enzymatic activity. Both groups had low sun exposur...|$|E
