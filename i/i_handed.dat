500|$|The episode's initial script where Pfaster was a necrophiliac was {{rejected}} by the Fox Broadcasting Company for being [...] "unacceptable for broadcast standards". As series creator Chris Carter described it, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>handed</b> the script in, it was really for a necrophiliac episode, and that just didn't fly. You cannot do the combination of sex and death on network television." [...] Carter was forced to tone down the script by changing Pfaster from a necrophiliac to a death fetishist and diminishing Pfaster's sexual obsession. He considered that the sexual content was [...] "implied and understood by audiences", and that Pfaster still resulted in a creepy character, particularly his [...] "creepy arrogance" [...] in using shampoo on the hair of his victims. The episode's original title was [...] "Fascination".|$|E

He first initiated a deal with NBC to own copyrights to The Walking Dead, but was later declined. [...] "They were very excited about the idea of doing a zombie show until <b>I</b> <b>handed</b> them a zombie script where zombies were actually doing zombie shit," [...] he stated. Darabont credited Hurd with finally getting the series on AMC. [...] "Gale was tremendously instrumental in jump-starting it at a point where it felt like it was languishing, [...] "he asserted. [...] "I'd gotten turned down enough times, which is no reflection on the material, but no matter what you're trying to sell in Hollywood, you're Willy Loman and it's Death of a Salesman. You're out there trying to sell shit that nobody wants. Even if it's good shit." ...|$|E

2500|$|Otis Redding {{recorded}} a rendition of [...] "Satisfaction" [...] for his album Otis Blue/Otis Redding Sings Soul, released in 1965. Redding {{claimed that he}} did not know the lyrics of the song. [...] "I use a lot of words different than the Stones' version," [...] he noted. [...] "That's because I made them up." [...] Of that session, Steve Cropper said, [...] "...if you ever listened to the record you can hardly understand the lyrics, right? I set down to a record player and copied down what I thought the lyrics were and <b>I</b> <b>handed</b> Otis a piece of paper and before we got through with the cut, he threw the paper on the floor and that was it." [...] Music writer Robert Christgau described it as an [...] "anarchic reading" [...] of the Stones' original. Redding's soul-style arrangement featured horns playing the main riff, as Keith Richards had originally intended. In 2003, Ronnie Wood noted that the Rolling Stones' later concert renditions of the number reflect Redding's interpretation.|$|E

We talked for a few minutes about London and things like that and I could soon see {{that it was time for}} me to leave. So I said goodbye and as I left the room <b>I</b> <b>handed</b> over the letter from Laski, and stepped out into the great circular corridor outside. When I was half way round, I heard the sound of someone clapping from the direction I had just come. I turned to see Panditji [...] beckoning me to come back. He had opened the letter as I left his room and read it. [...] "Why didn't you give this to me earlier?" [...] "Well, sir, I am sorry. I thought it would be enough if I just handed it over while leaving." [...] After a few more questions, he asked me to see him again and very soon I found myself entering the Indian Foreign Service.|$|E

2500|$|The {{burning of}} Brody had devoured {{almost half of}} the town – several hundred {{exclusively}} Jewish houses...With its old market place, the unsigned area looked impoverished and dejected. Many stores, especially the bigger one and richer ones, were locked or boarded up…The instant…I entered the market, we were surrounded by whole army of poor, ragged, famished kids, who were begging for a kopek. Most of them were Christian, but three or four were jewish. I gave each child a few kopeks, no matter what is his religion. But the instant <b>I</b> <b>handed</b> a coin to a Jew, all Christian children began shouting at me: [...] "Don’t give him anything! Don’t give him anything! He is a Jew! The children were joined by a Jewish beggar, a strange woman of about sixty. She wore a red dress, her grey hair was powdered, and her movements were nervous. She stood before me, grinning, her nasty, hungry eyes glaring at me, and she sort of danced a little. Then in a hoarse voice, mangling the language, she began warbling a sentimental Russian song, [...] "Ptichka Kanareyka", dearest little canary, about a young man who sends out a canary with a greeting for his beloved. The old beggar woman's screechy voice and outlandish appearance made a terrible impression on me. I gave her some coins and tried to hurry off. But she blocked my way, taring into my eyes and squawking her horrible song. She plainly expected me to be surprised that she could sing in Russian. I was haunted {{for the rest of the}} day by the nightmare of the beggar's appearance and performance.|$|E
