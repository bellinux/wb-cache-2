It then relates this terminology to that in use in the survivability, critical infrastructures, information warfare, and intrusion detection research communities, before describing the European <b>Dependability</b> <b>Initiative,</b> a contribution to the planning of the European Unions Information Society Technologies (IST) Programme. 1.

Analysis is done by using validity and reliability tests, cross tabulation analysis, importance-performance matrix, cluster analysis, and spearman rank correlation coefficient. Overall, although most of the trainees have high job performance, it is also found that most of them are actually dissatisfied with their on-the-job training, which means that there is no correlation between trainee satisfaction and job performance...|$|E
