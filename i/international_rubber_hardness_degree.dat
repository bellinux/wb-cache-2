40|$|Abstract—An {{innovative}} sensor {{is developed}} to evaluate hardness of human soft tissue. This sensor provides easy and accurate hardness measurements {{based on a}} unique sensing mechanism. Hardness of soft materials is often evaluated by using international standards of hardness such as IRHD (<b>International</b> <b>Rubber</b> <b>Hardness</b> <b>Degree)</b> and durometer hardness. However the conventional scales based on these standards requires a stable pressuring condition to the target. Therefore, these scales cannot be used for targets that are in motion or targets that require quick measurement such as human muscles during exercises and a liver exposed at a surgery. The prototyped sensor has a compact body and allows continuous hardness measurement with an arbitrary pressing force. This sensor always monitors the force exerted on the sensor and automatically eliminates the unintended effect from the fluctuation of the pressing force. Therefore, continuous time series of the hardness data is real-timely available.

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} the {{approach}} and {{results for the}} estimation of uncertainty in measurements of rubber and plastics are presented. The developed uncertainty guidelines are based on "Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement " (ISO GUM). As {{the most important and}} widely used hardness measuring methods for rubber and plastics the methods according to Durometer (A and D) and to the <b>International</b> <b>Rubber</b> <b>Hardness</b> <b>Degree</b> (IRHD), scales N, M and L are dealt with. Additionally a new hardness measuring method for soft silicones, called Hardness Very Low (HVL), which is {{still in the process of}} standardization, is considered. According to the calibration methods direct calibration of test force, indentation depth and geometrical deviations of indenters must be carried out. Correspondingly the uncertainty of these direct calibrations have to be determined. In order to indicate the uncertainty based on these direct calibration expressed in hardness units, it is necessary to summarize the uncertainties of the direct calibration with the aid of sensitivity coefficients. Further, indirect calibrations with reference test blocks also require to indicate the uncertainty in hardness units...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Methods for {{hardness}} measurement on elastomers {{are characterized by}} a set-up where indenters with various defined geometries are pressed under defined test forces into the surface of testing material. The hardness value represents {{the resistance of the}} material to the rigid indenter and is calculated from the indentation depth of the indenter in the to be tested material. The test methods IRHD and Shore are the most common methods used in the field of <b>rubber</b> <b>hardness</b> measurements. Appropriate hardness measuring instruments are spread world wide. A periodic verification has to be carried out to assure the accuracy of these measuring instruments. Direct and indirect verification methods are recommended to be used. For the indirect method <b>rubber</b> <b>hardness</b> reference blocks are used. This indirect verification method is especially appropriate for the daily check of hand held <b>rubber</b> <b>hardness</b> testers. On the other side the direct verification of test force, depth measuring system and indenter geometry is suited for the periodic calibration of <b>rubber</b> <b>hardness</b> testers. For the <b>rubber</b> <b>hardness</b> reference blocks their accurate hardness reference value and the long-term stability are the most important characteristics. In this paper the long-term behaviour of <b>hardness</b> of <b>rubber</b> blocks which at present are available on the market and are made by different producers is presented. For the measurements the Shore and IRHD hardness standard devices in the PTB have been used. In order to determine the relationship between hardness and time under the specified conditions a regression analysis of the obtained measurement results was carried out. The results of this analysis can be used for the improvement of quality assurance systems in the field of <b>rubber</b> <b>hardness</b> measurements...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDemand for {{diminishing}} {{edge roll}} off of workpiece has rapidly increased, particularly in polishing silicon wafers as the substrates of the semiconductor devices and glass disks as the substrates of magnetic media disks. In general, {{the usage of}} harder polishing pads {{is thought to be}} very effective in achieving the high surface flatness of the workpiece edge. Then the <b>hardness,</b> especially the <b>rubber</b> <b>hardness</b> of the polishing pads is widely measured {{as one of the most}} important pad specifications in practical processes. However, it has not been clarified whether the edge surface flatness can be estimated by the current <b>rubber</b> <b>hardness</b> tests. Then, based on the elastic contact theory, the polishing pad property which influences the surface profile near the edge was investigated and, as a result, it was found that the usage of the indenter with a diameter of 20 mm or above could estimate the obtained edge surface flatness appropriately in indentation tests such as <b>rubber</b> <b>hardness</b> tests...|$|R

40|$|Various uncompounded ethylene–propylene–diene (EPDM) {{elastomers}} were photo-oxidized using standard Weather-O-Meter (WOM) {{aging and}} oxygen absorption measurements during UV irradiation. The {{influence of the}} type and amount of diene on the UV stability was investigated. FTIR (ATR) measurements of the carbonyl absorbance after WOM aging were comparable with {{the outcome of the}} oxygen absorption tests. Both techniques showed a decrease in UV stability with increasing diene content. In addition, EPDM containing 5 -ethylidene- 2 -norbornene (ENB) as the third monomer showed a higher UV stability compared to EPDM containing dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) as the third monomer. Furthermore, a linear relation was found between the carbonyl absorbance after WOM aging and the third monomer content for DCPD- and ENB-containing EPDM samples with comparable ethylene/propylene (C 2 /C 3) ratio. The microhardness (<b>International</b> <b>Rubber</b> <b>Hardness</b> <b>Degree)</b> and the Young's modulus of the various EPDMs as function of the WOM irradiation time showed a maximum. This maximum is the result of parallel photo-crosslinking and chain-scission reactions, the latter being dominant in the later stages of the oxidation process. Combining the results from the FTIR measurements with the Young's modulus showed that DCPD-containing EPDM has a higher propensity to crosslinking reactions compared to ENB-containing EPDM...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the failure {{probability}} of rubber sealing rings in reciprocating dynamic seal, a new structure of sealing ring based on bionics was designed. The biomimetic ring has three concave ridges and convex bulges on each side which are very similar to earthworms. Bulges were circularly designed and sealing performances of the biomimetic ring in both static seal and dynamic seal were simulated by FEM. In addition, effects of precompression, medium pressure, speed, friction coefficient, and material parameters on sealing performances were discussed. The results show that von Mises stress of the biomimetic sealing ring distributed symmetrically in no-pressure static sealing. The maximum von Mises stress appears on the second bulge of the inner side. High contact stress concentrates on left bulges. Von Mises stress distribution becomes uneven under medium pressure. Both von Mises stress and contact stress increase when precompression, medium pressure, and <b>rubber</b> <b>hardness</b> increase in static sealing. Biomimetic ring can avoid rolling and distortion in reciprocating dynamic seal, and its working life is much longer than O-ring and rectangular ring. The maximum von Mises stress and contact stress increase with the precompression, medium pressure, <b>rubber</b> <b>hardness,</b> and friction coefficient in reciprocating dynamic seal...|$|R
