5|$|Asked {{what impact}} {{the money would}} have on him, Kinsler said: I'm {{going to play the}} same {{regardless}} of whether I'm making five dollars or $1 trillion. It really doesn't make a difference to me. I'm {{going to go out there}} and play hard, and money doesn't bring respect. The way you play the game brings respect. When I finish playing the game, it's not how much money I made that is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> legacy. It's how I played the game, and what I did on the field.|$|E
500|$|Melua's fifth studio album, Secret Symphony was {{released}} on 5 March 2012. The album was recorded in collaboration with orchestrator and conductor Mike Batt. Melua said in a statement: [...] "This album was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> 'singer's album'. I {{had always wanted to}} do this one day; singing other people's songs brings something out of you and your voice that isn't perhaps where you would have gone vocally with your own material." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Kennedy {{sat down}} for an {{interview}} with entertainer Jack Paar. The senator was in a grave mood; when asked how he thought the White House might accommodate a family as large as his, he responded, [...] "Do you think that is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> biggest problem?" [...] When Paar more seriously asked if jobs would solve the problems of urban ghettos, Kennedy replied that while job opportunity was important, it needed to be accompanied by [...] "compassion for one's fellow human beings." [...] Paar then asked, [...] "What {{did you think when you}} heard that Dr. King had been assassinated?" [...] Kennedy answered, [...] "That more and more people are turning to violence. And in the last analysis it's going to destroy our country." ...|$|E

60|$|No, it ain't. I've done it myself. It's {{like a high}} dive. When {{you look}} down at the water it fairly takes your breath away, but after you've done it--it's not so bad as you think. You're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> married, <b>my</b> boy.|$|R
500|$|While {{developing}} the series, Desperate Housewives creator Marc Cherry envisioned Susan {{as a girl}} next door and chose her to convey this image. In the original pilot, the character's surname was spelled [...] "Meyer" [...] but had to be changed to [...] "Mayer" [...] for clearance purposes. Cherry commented, [...] "I knew Susan was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> anchor character, and I didn't really know my take on her at first. And then {{it occurred to me}} that one of these women should be divorced... I thought there was something so real about a woman saying, 'I don't have much time left,' and when this available hunky guy moves onto the street, something in her saying 'Let me at him'". The character is a compendium of single mothers in Cherry's life [...] "desperate to land a man". He also drew upon his own personal experiences while creating the character.|$|E

Access Hollywood reported that a single sprinkler was used to produce rain in the music video. The concept of the music video was conceived by Clarkson. She explained, [...] "The whole thing is a metaphor about a broken fairy tale [...] You think everything is going well, and then reality kicks your butt.

[...] Clarkson also added that after {{the production of the}} music video was completed, she had bruises and a green-and-yellow splotch on her left biceps. The music video premiered online on May 9, 2005, on MTV. On May 16, 2005, it premiered on Total Request Live where it debuted at number five on the chart the following day.|$|E
500|$|Azaria did {{not expect}} to hear from the show again, but they {{continued}} to call him back, first to perform the voice of Chief Wiggum and then Apu Nahasapeemapetilon. He felt that, initially, [...] " [...] didn't seem too pleased with what I had done... was very exacting... was kind of impatiently directing me on the ABCs of comedy. But then, much to my surprise, he would still keep having me back every week. But each week, I thought it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> last week because I really didn't think I had done that well." [...] Nevertheless, by the show's second season he was performing multiple recurring voices and so was given a contract and made a permanent member of the main cast. Since he joined later {{than the rest of the}} cast, Groening still considered Azaria the [...] "new guy".

His co-star in The Simpsons, Nancy Cartwright, wrote that: [...] "The thing about Hank that I most remember is that he started out so unassuming and then, little by little, his abilities were revealed and his contributions to the show escalated. I realized Hank was going to be our breakaway star." ...|$|E
5000|$|Before singing [...] "All the Man That I Need", Whitney said, [...] "this song <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on <b>my</b> new album, {{which should}} be {{released}} very soon, we don't know when but we'll see."

2500|$|Spike Lee {{was soon}} named the director, {{and he made}} {{substantial}} changes to the script. [...] "I'm directing this movie and I rewrote the script, and I'm an artist and there's just no two ways around it: this film about Malcolm X is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> vision of Malcolm X. But it's not like I'm sitting atop a mountain saying, 'Screw everyone, this is the Malcolm I see.' I've done the research, I've talked {{to the people who}} were there." ...|$|E
2500|$|The son of {{an estate}} agent from a working-class background, Robert Fripp was born in Wimborne Minster, Dorset, England. On Christmas Day 1957, aged 11, he got a [...] "very cheap" [...] guitar from his parents, saying [...] "almost {{immediately}} I knew that this guitar was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> life". Fripp took guitar lessons with teachers Kathleen Gartell and Don Strike, which quickly advanced his skills: at 11 years of age, he was playing rock, moving on to traditional jazz at 13 and modern jazz at 15. At {{this time he was}} influenced by such modern jazz players and composers as Charlie Parker and Charlie Mingus.|$|E

[...] He holds {{the distinction of being}} the only player to win Little Brown Jug games playing for both Minnesota and Michigan. [...] Asked at the time about having the opportunity to battle for the Little Brown Jug {{from the other side of}} the fence, Daley denied having qualms about playing his former teammates: [...] "It will have to be just another game. [...] I look at it just as though it were an intrasquad scrimmage. [...] There won't be any qualms about how hard I hit my teammates or how hard they hit me."

6000|$|... "In fact, if you weren't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> father-in-law, I {{doubt if}} I could {{bring myself to}} forgive you. As it is, I {{overlook}} it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Describing her experience, Ramírez said, [...] "I couldn’t {{stand the}} pain anymore. If <b>my</b> baby <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> die, then I decided I {{would have to}} die, too. But if he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> grow up, I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> see him grow up, and I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> with <b>my</b> child.
