25|$|There {{are some}} {{exceptions}} for very {{high or low}} rolls, deemed criticals. No matter {{the level of the}} skill, a <b>die</b> <b>roll</b> of 18 is always a critical failure, and a roll of 3 or 4 is always a critical success (a roll of 17 is a critical failure as well, unless the character relevant skill level is 16 or more). The Game Master may decide in such cases that, in first case (a roll of 18, or 10+ over the modified skill level), the character has failed miserably and caused something disastrous to happen or, in the other case, that he or she succeeds incredibly well and gains some benefit as a result.|$|E
25|$|Dungeons & Dragons co-creator Dave Arneson {{described}} {{the origin of}} hit points in a 2002 interview. When Arneson was adapting the medieval wargame Chainmail (1971) to a fantasy setting, a process that with Gary Gygax would lead to Dungeons & Dragons, {{he saw that the}} emphasis of the gameplay was moving from large armies to small groups of heroes and eventually to the identification of one player and one character that is essential to role-playing as it was originally conceived. Players became attached to their heroes and did not want them to die every time they lost a <b>die</b> <b>roll.</b> Players were thus given multiple hit points which were incrementally decreased as they took damage. Arneson took the concept, along with armor class, from a set of a naval American Civil War game's rules.|$|E

500|$|In combat, {{players have}} access to a variety of {{abilities}} and magic spells, based on the makeup of the party. [...] Storm of Zehir uses the dice-based d20 System of Dungeons & Dragons and each action requires a random number generated by a <b>die</b> <b>roll.</b> [...] The player can control a character individually by selecting specific actions to be taken against enemies, or allow the game's artificial intelligence to fight by using a pre-selected set of behaviors for each character. [...] Defeating monsters and completing quests bestows experience points on the party, which are used to gain levels and become more powerful.|$|E
500|$|Neverwinter Nights 2 {{is played}} in the third-person from a {{top-down}} perspective, where the player controls a hero {{and his or her}} attendant party. As a role-playing video game based on the Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 edition ruleset, players build a player character in accordance with the character creation rules of Dungeons & Dragons, which includes selecting a race and class, then assigning skill points. There are sixteen races and twelve classes available, including the rogue and the wizard, as well as an additional seventeen unlockable classes. [...] Neverwinter Nights 2 makes use of the d20 system introduced in Dungeons & Dragons, where a <b>die</b> <b>roll</b> or random number is used to determine the probability and effectiveness of every action, including attacks and saving throws. The player character can recruit companions during the campaign, and may form a party with up to three of them. Party members can be controlled directly by the player or given orders dictating how to behave in combat.|$|E
2500|$|When {{all of a}} player's {{checkers}} are in that player's home board, that player {{may start}} removing them; this is called [...] "bearing off". A roll of 1 {{may be used to}} bear off a checker from the 1-point, a 2 from the 2-point, and so on. If all of a player's checkers are on points lower than the number showing on a particular die, the player may use that die to bear off one checker from the highest occupied point. For example, if a player rolls a 6 and a 5, but has no checkers on the 6-point and two on the 5-point, then the 6 and the 5 must be used to bear off the two checkers from the 5-point. When bearing off, a player may also move a lower <b>die</b> <b>roll</b> before the higher even if that means the full value of the higher die is not fully utilized. For example, if a player has exactly one checker remaining on the 6-point, and rolls a 6 and a 1, the player may move the 6-point checker one place to the 5-point with the lower <b>die</b> <b>roll</b> of 1, and then bear that checker off the 5-point using the <b>die</b> <b>roll</b> of 6; this is sometimes useful tactically. As before, if {{there is a way to}} use all moves showing on the dice, by moving checkers within the home board or bearing them off, the player must do so.|$|E

2500|$|Making {{statistic}} {{and skill}} checks in GURPS is {{the reverse of}} the mechanics of most other RPGs, where the higher the total of the <b>die</b> <b>roll,</b> the better. GURPS players hope to roll {{as low as possible}} under the tested statistic's rating or skill's level. If the roll is {{less than or equal to}} that number, the check succeeds. There is no [...] "target number" [...] or [...] "difficulty rating" [...] set by the Game Master, as would be the case in many other RPG systems. Instead the GM will apply various modifiers to add or subtract to the skill level. In this way, positive modifiers increase the chance for success by adding to the stat or skill level you must roll under while negative modifiers deduct from it, making things more difficult.|$|E
5000|$|DOUBLE THE NEXT <b>DIE</b> <b>ROLL!</b> The next <b>die</b> <b>roll</b> is doubled. Importantly, a '1' {{becomes a}} '2' so no {{fireball}} is rolled. It is unclear {{what happens if}} {{a player in the}} caves must double his <b>die</b> <b>roll</b> and rolls above 3.|$|E

When {{an action}} is opposed by another character or two characters are competing {{to complete the}} same action, the formula becomes Stat + Skill + <b>Die</b> <b>Roll</b> vs. Stat + Skill + (<b>Die</b> <b>Roll</b> or +X). Combat resolution is similar to an opposed skill check. If a character's Stat + Skill already meets or exceeds the DV, it is usually considered an automatic success without making a <b>die</b> <b>roll.</b>|$|E
