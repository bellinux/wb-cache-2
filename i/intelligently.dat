If an actual conflict of interest is present, and that conflict results in any adverse effect on the representation, the result is automatic reversal. The general rule is that conflicts can be knowingly and <b>intelligently</b> waived, but some conflicts are un-waiveable.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses offer many {{possibilities}} in biological research, including {{their ability to}} regenerate limbs, change the colour of their skin, behave <b>intelligently</b> with a distributed nervous system, and make use of 168 kinds of protocadherins (humans have 58), the proteins that guide the connections neurons make with each other. The California two-spot octopus has had its genome sequenced, allowing exploration of its molecular adaptations. Having independently evolved mammal-like intelligence, octopuses have been compared to hypothetical intelligent extraterrestrials. Their problem-solving skills, along with their mobility and lack of rigid structure enable them to escape from supposedly secure tanks in laboratories and public aquariums.|$|E
5|$|Reception {{towards the}} {{introduction}} of Takedowns was highly positive. Reviewers admired the impact that Takedowns had in transforming the boost mechanic and shifting the game's focus to a more aggressive style of driving. GamesTM {{pointed out that the}} hostile behaviour of AI rivals supplemented the system by presenting more opportunities to perform Takedowns, culminating in an intense and dramatic racing experience. Lopez explained that Burnout 3 had <b>intelligently</b> integrated elements of vehicular combat games by introducing Takedowns. Gerstmann commended the game's use of Impact Time and Aftertouch mechanics, which he believed made crashing an entertaining aspect of the game unlike other racers. IGN's Fran Mirabella III was amazed by the crash system; he considered it to be far ahead of anything that had been done before.|$|E
5|$|Yardley {{had a good}} {{technique}} for batting. He possessed a fluent, attractive style, and his height allowed him to reach the ball and drive more comfortably than most. His best shots were on the leg side, using his strong wrists to turn the ball away when it was aimed towards his legs. Yardley performed best when his side was in difficulty, and he could play attacking or defensive innings depending on the situation. He bowled <b>intelligently,</b> leading to greater rewards than his gentle style led opponents to expect, but remained a reluctant bowler who was surprised by his own success. He was a good fielder in positions close to the batsmen.|$|E
5|$|Its {{writing was}} {{consistently}} praised by reviewers. The narrative was considered deep, successfully using White Wolf's Vampire: The Masquerade content. Eurogamer {{said that it}} had the best script the website had ever seen in a video game, and others {{described it as a}} superbly crafted tale of conspiracies, underworld subterfuge, fun and intrigue. Reviewers appreciated the use of adult themes, such as sex and death, in the storyline of a contemporary video game, which no other games had tackled with similar effectiveness. The mature themes succeeded without being gratuitous or exploitative, and were explored honestly and <b>intelligently</b> by a knowledgeable writer. The game's characters were praised for their memorable, developed personalities, with most major characters possessing their own backstory and presented as living people instead of ciphers. Its ending had a mixed response, with some reviewers appreciating their ability to choose one of the game's four endings (adding an incentive to replay the game) and others considering the ending anti-climatic.|$|E

25|$|Victory in a {{match is}} {{normally}} gained {{either by the}} judges' decision after an allotted amount of time has elapsed, a stoppage by the referee (for example if a competitor can not defend himself <b>intelligently)</b> or the fight doctor (due to an injury), a submission, by a competitor's cornerman throwing in the towel, or by knockout.|$|E

25|$|Tension {{developed}} between the trio, with Foster seeing his long-desired place as CPUSA chief foiled {{by a man}} who had formerly been his lieutenant at the Trade Union Educational League; both the midwesterners distrusted the ambitious, college-educated New Yorker Weinstone.

25|$|On July 8, 2006, at UFC 61, the rematch between Shamrock and Ortiz took place. Shamrock {{lost the}} rematch with Ortiz in 1:18 {{of the first}} round by a {{technical}} knockout.

25|$|Pele {{played the}} ball well ahead of Alberto, using space <b>intelligently,</b> so that the fast fullback ran on and shot without pausing, in full stride, smashing {{the ball into the}} Italian net. So {{effective}} was Brazil's use of width, that no Italian defender is even within reasonable striking distance of Alberto until the last moment. The principle of width stretched and drew the Italian defence. The principle of depth—fresh men moving up from the rear—allowed Brazil to exploit the gaps created by width.|$|E
25|$|As {{the ability}} to {{compromise}} and attain full remote control of business servers became more developed, the warez groups would hack a server and install an IRC bot on the compromised systems alongside the FTP service, or the IRC bot would provide file sharing directly by itself.

25|$|In November 2013, Donaire fought Vic Darchinyan in non-title {{fight that}} was a rematch of their 2007 fight. The bout was on the undercard of a Martinez vs Garcia fight. Donaire started strong, but Darchinyan mounted a {{comeback}} in the middle rounds {{to take the lead}} on two of the official scorecards. However, in the ninth round, Donaire was able to drop Darchinyan with a left hook. Although he was able to beat the count, Darchinyan wasn't able to <b>intelligently</b> defend himself and this prompted the referee to stop the fight (2:06).|$|E

The Award of Valor is normally the highest decoration for bravery given to Auxiliary Police Officers.|$|E
25|$|If {{the bond}} angles, bond lengths and torsion angles of the {{components}} are not modified at any stage of complex generation, it is known as rigid body docking. A subject of speculation {{is whether or not}} rigid-body docking is sufficiently good for most docking. When substantial conformational change occurs within the components at the time of complex formation, rigid-body docking is inadequate. However, scoring all possible conformational changes is prohibitively expensive in computer time. Docking procedures which permit conformational change, or flexible docking procedures, must <b>intelligently</b> select small subset of possible conformational changes for consideration.|$|E
25|$|Many {{problems}} in AI {{can be solved}} in theory by <b>intelligently</b> searching through many possible solutions: Reasoning {{can be reduced to}} performing a search. For example, logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from premises to conclusions, where each step is the application of an inference rule. Planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis. Robotics algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use local searches in configuration space. Many learning algorithms use search algorithms based on optimization.|$|E
25|$|One common {{challenge}} in developing action RPGs is including content {{beyond that of}} killing enemies. With {{the sheer number of}} items, locations and monsters found in many such games, {{it can be difficult to}} create the needed depth to offer players a unique experience tailored to his or her beliefs, choices or actions. This is doubly true if a game makes use of randomization, as is common. One notable example of a game which went beyond this is Deus Ex (2000) which offered multiple solutions to problems using intricately layered story options and individually constructed environments. Instead of simply bashing their way through levels, players were challenged to act in character by choosing dialog options appropriately, and by using the surrounding environment <b>intelligently.</b> This produced an experience that was unique and tailored to each situation as opposed to one that repeated itself endlessly.|$|E
25|$|Vainio ran <b>intelligently</b> in the 1978 European Championships 10,000 metres race, {{spending}} most of the distance among the lead group's last runners. He only joined the lead group after 8,500 metres. Due to the fast and steady pace, the other runners – some of them presumably better kickers than Vainio – had exhausted themselves, and Vainio only needed to sprint the last lap in 58.4 seconds to win the race. Especially notable was Brendan Foster falling from the lead to the fourth place in the last 130 metres. His winning time 27:30.99 was fifth on the all-time list of that time, and Vainio improved his personal best by 28.7 seconds. Later at the same championships Vainio was sixth in the 5,000 metres race. At the Track & Field News annual world ranking Vainio was second in 10,000 metres after world record breaker Henry Rono, and tenth in 5000 metres.|$|E
25|$|In {{any given}} Shooting Dog Stake, {{it may be}} very {{difficult}} to place a dog which totally meets the exalted standard. Therefore, out of necessity, there will frequently be a need to accept a dog whose qualities and character can only begin to approximate this standard. The standard when applied should seek out a dog which displays superior bird dog characteristics in the form of natural qualities such as pace, range, bird sense, nose, stamina and style. The contender sought after should render a balanced, biddable performance, search <b>intelligently</b> and exhibit bird finding ability with quality always superseding quantity, manifest accuracy of location, loftiness and intensity on point. Subservience to the handler and proper handling response without the benefit of scouting and excessive handling are the “sine qua non” of a shooting dog. Excessive range {{on the part of a}} shooting dog is not considered desirable. When considering bird work, the judges should be swayed not by the frequency of occurrence but rather the quality of the performance.|$|E
25|$|The Pandyas in {{the south}} had risen {{to the rank of}} a great power who {{ultimately}} banished the Hoysalas from Malanadu or Kannada country, who were allies of the Cholas from Tamil country and the demise of the Cholas themselves ultimately was caused by the Pandyas in 1279. The Pandyas first steadily gained control of the Tamil country as well as territories in Sri Lanka, Chera country, Telugu country under Maravarman Sundara PandiyanII and his able successor Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan before inflicting several defeats on the joint forces of the Cholas under Rajaraja CholaIII, his successor Rajendra CholaIII and the Hoysalas under Someshwara, his son Ramanatha RajendraIII tried to survive by aligning with the Kadava Pallavas and the Hoysalas in turn in order to counter the constantly rising power of the Pandyans who were the major players in the Tamil country from 1215 and had <b>intelligently</b> consolidated their position in Madurai-Rameswaram-Ilam-Cheranadu and Kanniyakumari belt, and had been steadily increasing their territories in the Kaveri belt between Dindigul-Tiruchy-Karur-Satyamangalam {{as well as in the}} Kaveri Delta i.e., Thanjavur-Mayuram-Chidambaram-Vriddhachalam-Kanchi, finally marching all the way up to Arcot—Tirumalai-Nellore-Visayawadai-Vengi-Kalingam belt by 1250.|$|E
25|$|Odie is a yellow, long-eared beagle with a large, slobbering tongue, {{who walks}} {{on all four}} legs, though {{occasionally}} he will walk on two like Garfield. He was originally owned by Jon's friend Lyman, though Jon adopted him after Lyman was written out of the strip. The book Garfield: His 9 Lives (1984) retcons Odie's origin: {{there is no mention}} of Lyman, and Odie was a puppy when he was acquired by Jon as company for Garfield (when Garfield was a kitten). Odie is usually portrayed as naïve, happy, affectionate and blissfully unaware of Garfield's cynical, sadistic nature, despite the physical abuse Garfield exhibits toward him, including regularly kicking him off the kitchen table or tricking him into going over the edge himself. On some occasions, however, he is depicted more <b>intelligently,</b> as one strip, in which he holds a heavy rock to prevent Garfield from doing this, and actually hurts Garfield's foot. In one strip when Garfield and Jon are out of the house, Odie is seen reading War and Peace and watching a television program, An Evening With Mozart. Odie has only talked once. In another strip, published on January 28, 2010, he is seen solving Jon's sudoku puzzle.|$|E
25|$|Before each mission {{the player}} {{is taken to}} an upgrade screen, where they can spend their honor in three sections: Techniques (passive {{upgrades}} and skills such as new one-hit executions), Distraction Items (such as smoke bombs and firecrackers) and Attack Items (such as caltrops and poison-tipped darts). The next screen allows the player to select any unlocked costumes and equip items. Each costume (except the starting one) gives special bonuses, but also a side effect in order to balance its power, and must be unlocked by completing a number of seals {{in the form of}} optional goals related to the specialty of that costume (for instance, optionally terrorizing enemies in specific ways to unlock a costume which improves the ability to terrorize). Completing the game once unlocks a New Game Plus mode where the enemies behave more <b>intelligently</b> and can kill the player with only a single bullet or hand-to-hand strike, the player's line of sight is limited to a cone aimed in whatever direction the player is facing (preventing players from seeing what is behind, above, or below them unless they turn to look), the player is unable to see the enemy's line of sight and must intuit it from the direction an enemy's face is pointed, and the player can no longer detect the radius at which their actions will be heard by enemies.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, the EIC {{squadron}} under Commodore Charles Mitchell passed Singapore on 2 January 1794, sailing eastwards {{in search}} of French raiders. As the British squadron travelled along the northern coast of Sumatra, two French privateers attacked Bencoolen on the southern coast. The privateers were the 30-gun Vengeur and the 26-gun Résolu. On 17 January they approached the mouth of Rat Island Basin close to Bencoolen where Pigot lay at anchor, completely unprepared for action. At 08:15 Vengeur opened fire at , maintaining the battle {{for an hour and}} 45 minutes before hauling off so that Résolu could continue the combat. Ballantyne defended his vessel <b>intelligently,</b> positioning Pigot so that the French could only approach one at a time through the narrow mouth of the bay. This allowed him to drive off each ship in turn, the privateers falling back together at 10:20 with damaged rigging. Pigot too had suffered, with one man mortally wounded and sufficient damage to the rigging to require several weeks of repairs. After immediate repairs had been completed, next day Corosin abandoned Bencoolen and retreated to the Sunda Strait {{in search of}} weaker targets. The governor at Bencoolen sent over reinforcements to Pigot {{in the form of a}} lieutenant, 40 sepoys, and two 18-pounder guns. They arrived too late to assist, and Ballantayne sent them to Rat Island to establish a battery as he could not use the guns.|$|E
25|$|Minor success came in 2008 when Ricardo Gareca led Universitario to an Apertura tournament. The {{last time}} they won an Apertura title was in 2002. They won the tournament on their twenty-second game 10 points ahead of Sporting Cristal and four games away {{from the end of}} the Apertura. They {{defeated}} Cienciano 3–1 to secure first place and accumulated 50 points to win the title. They qualified for the 2009 Copa Libertadores but did not finish in the top seven of the Clausura and consequently could not contest the season final for the national title against Universidad San Martín. In 2009, following the resignation of Ricardo Gareca the club hired Juan Reynoso as the new manager, a former player of the club in the 90s and with a long history in the Mexican football. Much of the 2008 squad remained for the 2009 season, but with the departure of some notable players like Héctor Hurtado, Mayer Candelo and Donny Neyra. The most important signing prior to the 2009 season was Nolberto Solano. Other players to arrive were Carlos Orejuela, John Galliquio, Piero Alva, Francisco Bazán, Rodolfo Espinoza, and Ronaille Calheira. Reynoso <b>intelligently</b> led Universitario to the season final which would be a repeat of the 1987 final in which they would face arch-rival Alianza Lima. Universitario won both legs; in the first leg they won 1–0 with a goal from Piero Alva in and in the second leg Nolberto Solano scored the defining goal from the penalty mark in the tenth minute of play. As of 2009, Universitario has twenty-five Primera División titles. The first seven titles won by Universitario were during the amateur era. The remaining eighteen titles were won during the professional era, the most any Peruvian club has.|$|E

Koolhaas argued that reactions like Gibson's imply that the positive legacy of modernity can only be <b>intelligently</b> used by Westerners, and that attempts such as Singapore's at embracing the [...] "newness" [...] of modernity without understanding its history {{would result in a}} far-reaching and deplorable eradication.|$|E
500|$|Sport {{events and}} betting were usual between the warrior societies, {{and a great}} many {{contests}} of all kinds took place.

Carl Kimlinger described {{the characterization of}} the adult Jun as a [...] "highly believable mixture of bruised pride, desperate loneliness, and downtrodden numbness" [...] and praised how relatable the character is compared to his younger self. He also praised the scripting for Jun's life and the scene where Jun's personality is being dissected by his boss to be <b>intelligently</b> written. Bamboo Dong praised Zurückspulens introduction for revitalizing the series. Both reviewers praised the art and dolls' designs and expressed concerns about the confusing plot.|$|E
500|$|In {{the fourth}} round, Arsenal faced Everton at Highbury.
