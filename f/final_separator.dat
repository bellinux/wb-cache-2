40|$|This paper {{presents}} the performance analysis of {{geothermal power plant}} which consist of some main components such as <b>final</b> <b>separator,</b> steam turbine, condensor, cooling tower and others. Observed geothermal power plant {{is the one that}} is dominated by working fluid, which vapour-dominated system. Based on the result of the performance analysis using exergy analysis method, the irreversibility at <b>final</b> <b>separator,</b> steam turbin, condensor and cooling tower consecutively is 12. 80 MW, 24. 65 MW, 3. 084 MW and 3. 823 MW...|$|E
