25|$|After {{earning the}} championship, Clay {{converted}} his religion to Islam, which instigated conflict with his boxing career. He also abandoned his name {{that was given}} to his slave ancestors and adopted Muhammad Ali. On April 28, 1967, he refused to serve in the Army during the Vietnam War, stating religious reasons that <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>against</b> the Qur'an's teaching.|$|E
25|$|We {{question}} ourselves {{how such}} a law can claim to guarantee human rights when <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>against</b> the rights of association, expression, religion and conscience; when it puts in danger the right of minorities and maintains prejudices that are so incompatible {{with the concept of}} tolerance intrinsic to that of human rights. France must deal with its responsibilities and obligations as a signatory for the International Conventions and respect the European laws and its interpretation by the Court of Strasbourg, before one of its citizens become a victim of discrimination due to the law which you propose.|$|E
25|$|Non-constituency Member of Parliament Sylvia Lim {{has stated}} {{that it is the}} Workers' Party's {{position}} that the NMP scheme cannot be improved as <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>against</b> the most fundamental democratic ideals of fair representation and elections. Despite such calls to do away entirely with the NMP system, there are also those who believe in the scheme and have raised points for its improvement. NMP Viswa Sadasivan has expressed the view that the scheme serves a function and purpose in the current socio-political climate, though it should not be viewed as a permanent solution for Singapore. The scheme could evolve into a selection–election hybrid, or the selection process itself could become more transparent with clearer criteria on which candidates and selected NMPs alike could be assessed.|$|E

25|$|The main {{argument}} against the concept of reservation is that <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>against</b> the idea of merit and would dilute the IITs {{as one of the}} basic reasons behind their success is the excellent students they get via IIT-JEE. It is also being argued by the opposers that the irreparable damage caused during the childhood of the individual, cannot be rectified at a later stage. Also, the primary education provided by the government to the economically poor is highly inadequate, and this negligence by the government is the root cause of the problem. Statistics across the IIT's reveal that while about 4–5% of general category students do not complete their degree program, the number goes up to about 20% for reserved category students. This is used as an {{argument against}} reservations claiming that the reserved class candidates are not adequately prepared to face the challenging academic life in IITs.|$|E
500|$|The cover mode was {{designed}} to enhance the stealth aspect {{of the game and}} the third-person perspective was needed to allow players to see the character they were playing. The idea of bringing the game into a total third-person perspective was rejected as the shooting [...] "works better" [...] in first-person view, explained Tilston. Developers decided not to include a jumping function since they felt <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>against</b> the nature of the genre. Botwood pointed out that it can [...] "look damn stupid when you see other players doing it". For this reason, the team implemmented moves such as climbing obstacles or, more specifically, the combat roll, which makes players harder to hit since it breaks the game's auto-aim lock. The transition between first and third-person view with some moves took a lot of work so that they did not become disorientating. A first-person roll was implemented at one time, but it was ultimately dropped.|$|E
2500|$|Emanuel and Fuchs {{reject a}} single-payer system, because <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>against</b> American values of individualism. [...] "The biggest problem with single-payer is {{its failure to}} cohere with core American values. Single-payer puts {{everyone}} into the same system with the same coverage and makes it virtually impossible to add amenities and services through the private market." ...|$|E

2500|$|In November 2009, the South Park episode [...] "The F Word" [...] {{dealt with}} the overuse of the word fag. [...] The boys use the word to insult a group of bikers, saying that their loud {{motorcycles}} ruin everyone else's nice time. [...] Officials from the dictionary, including Emmanuel Lewis attend in the town and agree that {{the meaning of the}} word should no longer insult homosexuals but instead be used to describe loud motorcycle riders who ruin others' nice times. The episode is a satire on the taboo of using the term, as <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>against</b> political correctness.|$|E
2500|$|Itagaki {{has also}} spoken of his {{handheld}} philosophy which goes for responsiveness and physical interaction, instead of raw hardware power. As such, Itagaki refuses {{to make a}} handheld game for the PlayStation Portable (PSP), stating <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>against</b> the design philosophy of being a handheld device. He says a game created, {{based on the specifications}} of the PSP, would be more suited for a true home console. This view is reflected in his statements on why [...] as a handheld game has to be designed {{to take advantage of the}} Nintendo DS' touchpad rather than conventional inputs which would have rendered it a typical game.|$|E
2500|$|It was Buñuel's {{intention}} to shock and insult the intellectual bourgeoisie of his youth, later saying: [...] "Historically the film represents a violent reaction against what {{in those days}} was called 'avant-garde,' which was aimed exclusively at artistic sensibility and the audience's reason." [...] Against his hopes and expectations, the film was a huge success amongst the French bourgeoisie, leading Buñuel to exclaim in exasperation, [...] "What can I do about the people who adore all that is new, even when <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>against</b> their deepest convictions, or about the insincere, corrupt press, and the inane herd that saw beauty or poetry in something which was basically no more than a desperate impassioned call for murder?" ...|$|E

To give a fair sketch would be absolutely impossible, for every proposition requires such an array of facts. If I were to do anything it could only refer to the main agency of change, selection,—& perhaps point out a {{very few of the}} leading features which countenance such a view, & some few of the main difficulties. But I do not know what to think: I rather hate the idea of writing for priority, yet I certainly shd be vexed if any one were to publish my doctrines before me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{stated that}} the {{observance}} of the laws that he prescribed {{should be subject to}} [...] "tact and wisdom", and that they do not cause [...] "disturbance and dissension." [...] Bahá'u'lláh thus provided for the progressive application of his laws; for example certain Bahá'í laws are only applicable to Middle Eastern Bahá'ís such as the limit to the period of engagement, while any Bahá'í may practice the laws if they so decide. Other Bahá'í laws such as the prohibition to drink alcohol have also been applied gradually in countries where <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>against</b> social norms, and for which most Bahá'ís are new to the religion. Shoghi Effendi also stated that certain other laws, such as criminal laws, that are dependent upon the existence of a predominantly Bahá'í society would only be applicable in a possible future Bahá'í society. [...] He also stated that if the laws were in conflict with the civil law of the country where a Bahá'í [...] lives the laws could not be practiced. Furthermore some laws and teachings are, according to Bahá'í teaching, not meant to be applied at the present time and their application depends on decisions by the Universal House of Justice.|$|E
2500|$|Dennis {{was told}} the {{identity}} of the culprit minutes before he filmed the scene in which Paul was pushed. He was initially the only cast member who knew for [...] "quite a while." [...] The actor was sworn to secrecy and was not allowed to tell any of his co-stars. Dennis admitted that he was forced to lie {{that he did not know}} the identity of Paul's attacker when he was asked. He also said that he was not surprised when the culprit was revealed to him. When asked if he was surprised at who the culprit was, Dennis stated that he was not because it was explained to him why it was that person. The other cast members did not find out who the culprit was until a couple of weeks after the 6000th episode. Jane Hall later revealed that she had known her character, Rebecca, would be the culprit from the start. She was told by the writers it what was what they had planned. Hall admitted to thinking that the storyline would be [...] "really tricky" [...] as <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>against</b> her character's nature.|$|E

25|$|In {{his letter}} to Carlo Goldoni from the book Illustrissimi, Luciani took a {{critical}} perspective of abortion and argued that it violated God's law and that <b>it</b> <b>went</b> <b>against</b> the deepest aspirations of women, profoundly disturbing them.|$|R
2500|$|Hubie {{is picked}} up by humans and caged on their ship called [...] "Misery", {{transports}} penguins to a zoo and meets a tough, grumpy, streetwise and somewhat arrogant but good-hearted rockhopper penguin named Rocko (James Belushi). After seeing in a vision Marina having a dilemma, Hubie decides to escape with Rocko and flees, before laying low on a beach. Rocko reluctantly tells Hubie about his desire to fly and live in tropical climate. He convinces him to help him return to Antarctica by making up a lie about a flying penguin named Waldo. They have a short fight after Rocko tries to fly off [...] "an authentic, ancient aviarial airstrip" [...] and another after Rocko saved Hubie from a killer whale. Back in Antarctica, Drake begins to threaten Marina for her hand in mating. If Marina refuses, she {{will be forced to}} leave, as <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>against</b> tradition. Hubie and Rocko attempt to depart, but Rocko discovers Hubie lied to him and attempts to attack Hubie, but soon starts laughing, praising Hubie's determination to get back to Marina. Back in Antarctica, Marina becomes worried about Hubie. Hubie and Rocko run into the hungry and persistent leopard seal but are able to escape it. With that they become true friends (though it takes prodding from Hubie for Rocko to admit it). Their joy is short-lived as three killer whales attack them causing Hubie's pebble to get lost in the scuffle and Rocko to go missing, leaving Hubie to think he perished.|$|E
