5|$|Stichometry {{refers to}} the {{practice}} of counting lines in texts: Ancient Greeks and Romans measured the length of their books in lines, just as modern books are measured in pages. This practice was rediscovered by German and French scholars in the 19th century. Stichos is the <b>Greek</b> <b>word</b> for a 'line' of prose or poetry and the suffix '-metry' is derived from the <b>Greek</b> <b>word</b> for measurement.|$|E

50|$|Eustoma {{is named}} after the <b>Greek</b> <b>words</b> eu, which means good, and stoma, which means mouth. Lisianthus {{on the other hand}} comes from the <b>Greek</b> <b>words</b> lissos, meaning smooth, and anthos, which means flower.|$|R
5|$|The {{specific}} epithet agathosmus {{is derived}} from the <b>Greek</b> <b>word</b> agathos meaning “good”, and osme meaning “scent”. Hygrophorus agathosmus is commonly known as the gray almond waxy cap, or the almond woodwax.|$|E
5|$|Chromium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Cr and atomic number 24. It {{is the first}} element in group 6. It is a steely-grey, lustrous, hard and brittle metal which takes a high polish, resists tarnishing, and has a high melting point. The name of the element {{is derived from the}} <b>Greek</b> <b>word</b> χρῶμα, chrōma, meaning color, because many chromium compounds are intensely colored.|$|E
5|$|Early on the {{community}} tried several names, rejecting Albion, All Saints, Lowell, Brooklyn, Addiseville and Winona. The twenty four small lakes that are now within the city limits led Charles Hoag, Minneapolis's first schoolmaster, to suggest Minnehapolis, derived from Minnehaha and mni, the Dakota word for water, and polis, the <b>Greek</b> <b>word</b> for city.|$|E
5000|$|The term {{is derived}} from the Ancient <b>Greek</b> <b>words</b> gnosis ("knowledge", γνῶσις) and logos ("word" [...] or [...] "discourse", λόγος). Linguistically, one might compare it to epistemology, which {{is derived from}} the <b>Greek</b> <b>words</b> episteme ("certain knowledge") and logos.|$|R
5000|$|The genus name Astronotus {{comes from}} the <b>Greek</b> <b>words</b> [...] "Astra" [...] which means ray and [...] "Noton" [...] means back. The species name crassipinnis {{comes from the}} <b>Greek</b> <b>words</b> [...] "Crassus" [...] came from the word fat and [...] "Pinna" [...] means fish.|$|R
5000|$|The genus name Gymnarrhena {{may be a}} {{contraction}} of two <b>Greek</b> <b>words,</b> γυμνός (gymnos) meaning [...] "naked" [...] and ἄῤῥην (arrhēn), [...] "male", while the species epithet micrantha is a {{contraction of}} the <b>Greek</b> <b>words</b> μικρός (mikrós), [...] "small" [...] and ἄνθος (ánthos), [...] "flower".|$|R
5|$|Paleontologists Jose Bonaparte and Fernando Novas {{coined the}} name Abelisauridae in 1985 when they {{described}} the eponymous Abelisaurus. The name is formed {{from the family}} name of Roberto Abel, who discovered Abelisaurus, {{as well as from}} the <b>Greek</b> <b>word</b> σαυρος/sauros meaning 'lizard'. The very common suffix -idae is usually applied to zoological family names and is derived from the Greek suffix -ιδαι/-idai, which indicates a plural noun.|$|E
5|$|Telescopium {{is a minor}} {{constellation}} in {{the southern}} celestial hemisphere, one of twelve named in the 18th century by French astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille and one of several depicting scientific instruments. Its name is a Latinized form of the <b>Greek</b> <b>word</b> for telescope. Telescopium was later much reduced in size by Francis Baily and Benjamin Gould.|$|E
5|$|According to David Potter, Vaballathus {{inherited}} his father's exact titles. Hartmann {{points that}} there have been cases where a <b>Greek</b> <b>word</b> was translated directly to Palmyrene and a Palmyrene equivalent was also used to mean the same thing. The dedication to Odaenathus would be the using of a Palmyrene equivalent, while the inscription of Vaballathus would be the direct translation. Despite all the arguments, it cannot be certain without doubt that Odaenathus was a corrector.|$|E

5|$|In 1500 polymath Leonardo da Vinci {{provides}} the first {{illustration of the}} thyroid. In 1543 Anatomist Andreas Vesalius gave the first anatomic description and illustration of the gland. In 1656 the thyroid received its name, by the anatomist Thomas Wharton. The gland was named thyroid, meaning shield, as its shape resembled the shields commonly used in Ancient Greece. The English name thyroid gland {{is derived from the}} medical Latin used by Wharton – glandula thyreoidea. Glandula means gland in Latin, and thyreoidea {{can be traced back to}} the Ancient <b>Greek</b> <b>word</b> θυρεοειδής, meaning shield-like/shield-shaped.|$|E
5|$|The {{cattle egret}} was first {{described}} in 1758 by Linnaeus in his Systema naturae as Ardea ibis, but {{was moved to}} its current genus by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1855. Its genus name Bubulcus is Latin for herdsman, referring, like the English name, to this species' association with cattle. Ibis is a Latin and <b>Greek</b> <b>word</b> which originally referred to another white wading bird, the sacred ibis, but was applied to this species in error.|$|E
5|$|The {{specific}} epithet, tigris, {{as well as}} {{the common}} name, tiger, come from the Middle English tigre and the Old English tigras (a plural word), both used for the animal. These derive from the Old French tigre, itself a derivative of the Latin word tigris and the <b>Greek</b> <b>word</b> tigris. The original source may have been the Persian tigra meaning pointed or sharp and the Avestan tigrhi meaning an arrow, perhaps referring to the speed with which a tiger launches itself at its prey. It is worth mentioning that Mesopotamia, where the Caspian tiger had occurred, has a river called 'Tigris'.|$|E

5|$|The first {{evidence}} of helium was observed on August 18, 1868, as {{a bright yellow}} line with a wavelength of 587.49 nanometers in the spectrum of the chromosphere of the Sun. The line was detected by French astronomer Jules Janssen during a total solar eclipse in Guntur, India. This line was initially assumed to be sodium. On October 20 of the same year, English astronomer Norman Lockyer observed a yellow line in the solar spectrum, which he named the D3 Fraunhofer line because it was near the known D1 and D2 lines of sodium. He concluded that it was caused by an element in the Sun unknown on Earth. Lockyer and English chemist Edward Frankland named the element with the <b>Greek</b> <b>word</b> for the Sun, ἥλιος (helios).|$|E
5|$|There was a {{movement}} {{in the late nineteenth}} century to interpret all the Boeotian heroes as merely personifications of the constellations; there has since come to be wide agreement that the myth of Orion existed before there was a constellation named for him. Homer, for example, mentions Orion, the Hunter, and Orion, the constellation, but never confuses the two. Once Orion was recognized as a constellation, astronomy in turn affected the myth. The story of Side may well be a piece of astronomical mythology. The <b>Greek</b> <b>word</b> side means pomegranate, which bears fruit while Orion, the constellation, can be seen in the night sky. Rose suggests she is connected with Sidae in Boeotia, and that the pomegranate, as a sign of the Underworld, is connected with her descent there.|$|E
5|$|From the <b>Greek</b> <b>word</b> for pan pipes, σύριγξ, it is {{the vocal}} organ of birds. Located {{at the base of}} a bird's trachea, it {{produces}} sounds without the vocal folds of mammals. The sound is produced by vibrations of some or all of the membrana tympaniformis (the walls of the syrinx) and the pessulus, caused by air flowing through the syrinx. This sets up a self-oscillating system that modulates the airflow creating the sound. The muscles modulate the sound shape by changing the tension of the membranes and the bronchial openings. The syrinx enables some species of birds (such as parrots, crows, and mynas) to mimic human speech. Unlike the larynx of mammals, the syrinx is located where the trachea forks into the lungs. Thus, lateralization of bird song is possible and some songbirds can produce more than one sound at a time.|$|E
