5|$|Ellsworth M. Toohey, {{who writes}} a popular {{architecture}} {{column in the}} Banner, is an outspoken socialist who shapes public opinion through his column and a circle of influential associates. Toohey sets out to destroy Roark through a smear campaign. He recommends Roark to Hopton Stoddard, a wealthy acquaintance who {{wants to build a}} Temple of the Human Spirit. Roark's unusual design includes a nude statue modeled on Dominique; Toohey convinces Stoddard to sue Roark for malpractice. Toohey and several architects (including Keating) testify at the trial that Roark is incompetent as an architect due to his rejection of historical styles. Dominique speaks in Roark's defense, but he loses the case. Dominique decides that since she cannot <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> she wants, in which men like Roark are recognized for their greatness, she will live entirely in the world she has, which shuns Roark and praises Keating. She marries Keating and turns herself over to him, doing and saying whatever he wants, such as persuading potential clients to hire him instead of Roark.|$|E
25|$|After the All-Star Game, NBC was {{scheduled}} to televise six regular season games on Fridays or Saturdays in prime time. The networks had exclusive rights for the twelve regular season dates, in that no regional or national cable service or over-the-air broadcaster may telecast a Major League Baseball game on those dates. In even-numbered years, NBC would have {{the rights to the}} All-Star Game and both League Championship Series, while ABC would <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Series and newly created Division Series. In odd-numbered years, the postseason and All-Star Game television rights were supposed to alternate.|$|E
25|$|In {{supporting}} an Austrian {{war with}} Serbia, Germany's leaders knew {{the risks of}} a general war. As the historian Fritz Fischer pointed out, this could be proven by Jagow's request to know the full itinerary of Wilhelm's North Sea cruise before the Austrian ultimatum was presented because:"Since we want to localize the conflict between Austria and Serbia, we must not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> alarmed by His Majesty’s returning prematurely; on the other hand, His Majesty must be within reach, in case unpredictable developments should force us to take important decisions, such as mobilization. His Majesty might perhaps spend {{the last days of}} his cruise in the Baltic".|$|E

500|$|Although Gay {{had been}} bullish in victory on the track, the {{achievement}} {{did not change}} him—he remained humble and appreciative to his rivals. In November he {{was chosen as the}} IAAF Male World Athlete of the Year for 2007 and in his acceptance speech he paid tribute to his peers, encouraging Powell to remain focused and saying that he highly regarded the Jamaican. He also dismissed comparisons to his forebears, commenting: [...] "I honestly believe that I need to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> record like some of the other great sprinters like Carl Lewis, Maurice Greene. I think that sets you apart, having medals and having the World record." [...] At {{the end of the season}} Gay was elected 2007 Men's Athlete of the Year by Track and Field News (topping the year's list as the fastest 100m and 200m sprinter), and he won the USATF's Harrison Dillard award as the top US male sprinter.|$|E
500|$|Trademark controversies arose for [...] "Chicago2016.com" [...] and [...] "Tokyo2016.com", {{when both}} were {{registered}} in 2004 by entrepreneur Stephen Frayne Jr., an MBA {{student at the}} Kellogg School of Management; he also claimed around 40 other domain names whose city/year format mimicked the way Olympic Games are marketed. Frayne's stated intent for the site was a [...] "comprehensive, balanced discussion" [...] of the benefits and pitfalls of holding the Olympics in Chicago; the Chicago 2016 committee contended that his real intent was to profit from cybersquatting. The Chicago Olympic bid organization, which had been using Chicago2016.org as its official web site, sought control of Chicago2016.com through a complaint filed with an international arbitration organization. Attempts by the USOC to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) release the names failed. [...] Frayne sued in the U.S. District Court in Chicago, seeking an injunction against the arbitration proceedings. [...] On September 25, 2008, the WIPO arbitration panel granted Frayne's motion to suspend and terminate proceedings setting up a battle in the federal court in the Northern District of Illinois.|$|E

500|$|To {{design the}} missions, the {{designers}} {{began with a}} cohesive area, which they filled with activities for the player. They defined paths to the target areas, and developed and expanded them. They then populated the areas with NPCs, which they assigned to patrol routes and functions. The designers would then observe how players interacted with the level, using their abilities and powers to test whether the area provided a suitable challenge for the available powers, and then redesigned the level as needed. At first, the levels featured little directional information to emphasize the player's ability to traverse them as they choose, but in testing, players became lost or obeyed NPC commands to not enter an area, leaving them unable to proceed. In response, the developers introduced more visual cues and verbal hints to direct players. Some features and ideas were removed during the design process, including a mental institution where Corvo would have faced sound-sensitive patients. Discussing {{the use of violence}} and the consequences of in-game freedom, developer Joe Houston recounted his experience while watching a tester play a mission to infiltrate a masquerade ball; Houston determined that not killing the NPCs opened up more objectives and interactions, but the tester systematically killed every NPC in the level, which Houston found disconcerting. The team came under pressure to excise a scene {{from the end of the}} game where Samuel, in response to a player killing indiscriminately throughout the game, can betray Corvo by alerting enemies to his presence. Smith explained [...] "Everybody just wants to be told in a video game that you’re great, no matter what you do. If you slaughter everybody – you killed the maids, you killed the old people, you killed the beggars – you’re great, here’s a medal, you’re a hero... We decided that sounds psychotic. It doesn’t match our values... What we wanted was to let you express yourself in the game, but to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> react to that, at least in some way. , betraying you and firing off that flare, was something we had to fight for." ...|$|E

2500|$|Eve and Fred {{arrive with}} Mrs. Van Brugh, {{and the young}} couple {{go out to the}} garden together. Mrs. Van Brugh confesses to Smailey that she {{believes}} that a flaw in the will may have left her penniless. Smailey reveals that he knows this and accuses her of being part of wilful bigamy with her [...] "husband", as his first wife died after Mrs. Van Brugh married him. She tearfully confesses that she had never married him, but merely lived with him as his wife. Smailey is shocked at this and leaps to the attack, insisting, despite her pleas for mercy, that he [...] "will spare her nothing" [...] and that she must confess all, even to her own daughter. She pleads with him, offering to sign any deed he asks, to spare her the shame, but he holds a public announcement of her acts over her head if she does not submit to his will. She pleads further, holding up all her good deeds as evidence of her atonement. Smailey retorts that all her good works spring from her desire for forgiveness and taunts her with her previous criticisms of his own hard-heartedness. She cries [...] "enough", and, rallying, takes the shame onto herself in her own terms: [...] "So let it be. You are strong – for you <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> on your side. I am weak – for I am alone. If I am to die this moral death, it shall be by my own hand." [...] She calls everyone to her, asks Eve to kiss her once more before the truth is revealed, then confesses all. Eve faints into Ted's arms. Ruth recoils, and Smailey and Fred watch, emotionless.|$|E
2500|$|The Stems, {{with new}} drummer David Shaw on board, {{spent most of}} 1986 touring to promote their EP. This {{included}} national tours supporting Flamin' Groovies and the Hoodoo Gurus. They also sought a label deal. Mushroom Records signed the band, and The Stems booked into Platinum Studios with producer Alan Thorne {{at the end of}} 1986. The recording process didn’t go smoothly, and stretched from the planned one month to three, with a new producer brought in to complete the record. At First Sight, Violets Are Blue was released in 1987, their first recording for The White Label. [...] The album debuted at No. 1 on the Australian alternative charts and 34 on the mainstream charts. [...] It also received national and international critical acclaim and {{would be one of the}} best selling Australian albums of that year, despite the lack of commercial airplay in the corporate FM dominated '80s. Leaning toward a stronger pop sensibility, the album highlighed the talents of Dom Mariani and Richard Lane as skilled tunesmiths of the guitar pop genre. The album was nominated in the top 100 Australian albums of all time by Rolling Stone magazine and the title track [...] "At First Sight" [...] remains a bona fide Australian classic. 1987 also saw the band embark on another national tour and make appearances on national television, including playing the final episode of Countdown. In the same year, the lead single [...] "At First Sight" [...] also made the Young Einstein soundtrack. The band seemed to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> at their feet, an album which went on to become the third top Australian album of 1987. Following the success of the album, there was an increase in interest in the band from overseas, particularly in Europe.|$|E
