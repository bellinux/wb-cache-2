To prepare for her part, Kapoor interacted with students, attended workshops and practiced with theatre groups associated with Jawaharlal Nehru University. She also studied Jaya Bachchan's work in Guddi (1971), which she felt was [...] "perfect" [...] for her role.

[...] "Sometimes you feel the song's the star, but it's not like that here– it's the act," [...] he said. [...] "It's a real moment. Social media has become the new radio, it's never broken an act globally like this before." [...] Will Bloomfield, the group's manager, added, [...] "These guys live online, and so do their fans."

One Direction's Twitter account had amassed 10 million followers by February 2013, with the account gaining followers at an average of 21,000 per day. In an approach pioneered by The Beatles, each member is known for his feature; Horan is [...] "the cute one", Malik is [...] "the quiet and mysterious one", Payne is [...] "the sensible one", Styles is [...] "the charming one" [...] and Tomlinson is [...] "the funny one". Each member's individual identity is reinforced by their intentionally different personal styles. Caroline Watson, the band's original stylist, spoke about styling the band, [...] "At the beginning I didn't want them all in black or all in leather—that whole stereotypical boy band thing." [...] Instead, her original idea was for them to be the [...] "male equivalent to the Spice Girls", with each member being a part of the group but still having his own individual style. Horan commented on One Direction as a boy band, [...] "People think that a boy band is air-grabs and [...] dressed in all one colour. We're boys in a band. We're trying to do something different from what people would think is the typical kind of boy band. We're trying to <b>do</b> <b>different</b> kinds of music and we're just trying to be ourselves, not squeaky clean." [...] Leah Collins, writing for the National Post, remarked that One Direction had succeeded on the latter front, [...] "For the most part, that just means the group presents themselves as typical, goofy and uncensored teenage boys– posting jokey YouTube videos, for instance, or boozing at awards shows." [...] Writing for The Observer, Kitty Empire opined, [...] "One Direction fulfill a great many boy band prerequisites (looks, soppy lyrics, tune-grasp, fame-lust) but their lack of routines points to the subtle digressions afoot here".|$|E

Much of the humour comes from Basil's overly aggressive manner, engaging in angry but witty arguments with guests, staff and, in particular, Sybil, whom he addresses (in a faux-romantic way) with insults such as [...] "that golfing puff adder", [...] "my little piranha fish" [...] and [...] "my little nest of vipers". Despite this, he frequently feels intimidated, she being able to stop him in his tracks at any time, usually with a short, sharp cry of [...] "Basil!" [...] At the end of some episodes, Basil succeeds in annoying (or at least bemusing) the guests and frequently gets his comeuppance. Basil occasionally longs for a touch of class, sometimes by playing recordings of classical music.
