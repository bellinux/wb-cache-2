25|$|Before the Doha ministerial, WTO members {{resolved}} a {{small number}} of these implementation issues. At the Doha meeting, the Ministerial Declaration directed a two-path approach for the large number of remaining issues: (a) where a specific negotiating mandate is provided, the relevant implementation <b>issues</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> addressed under that mandate; and (b) the other outstanding implementation <b>issues</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> addressed as a matter of priority by the relevant WTO bodies. Outstanding implementation issues are found in the area of market access, investment measures, safeguards, rules of origin, and subsidies and countervailing measures, among others.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the reserve}} covers {{a large portion}} of Honduras, very little is {{recorded}} about the biological diversity within it. While previous management plans have proven successful, a continued investigation into ongoing management plans and future conservation <b>issues</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> necessary to keep this valuable reserve safe. Currently there are threats to the conservation of the reserve which include illegal hunting, logging and clearing of land to graze cattle. Recent rafting expeditions from the Rio Plátano headwaters through all three zones of the reserve (cultural, buffer and core) have documented cattle grazing in the core zone, commercial fishing and hunting camps along the river and clear cutting of forest near Las Marias.|$|E

Some claim that caste discrimination is non-existent. Some have rejected the government's right to interfere in the community. The Hindu Forum of Britain conducted their own research, concluding that caste discrimination was [...] "not endemic in British society", that reports to the contrary aimed to increase discrimination by legislating expression and behaviour and that barriers should instead be removed through education.|$|E

2500|$|Pope Francis, even as {{the bishops}} at Vatican II, {{prioritized}} the teaching of Jesus over scholastic theologies (see below: Sexual morality as Good News). He made an {{option for the poor}} the most visible priority of his papacy, Few would disagree that this option has enjoyed a special primacy throughout Christian history. Francis concludes that the church should be [...] "poor and for the poor" [...] (EG 198), with [...] "creative concern and effective cooperation in helping the poor to live with dignity and reaching out to everyone". Without this all the religious practices and talk of social <b>issues</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> just a camouflage (EG 207).

2500|$|GameSpy's William Abner scored it 75 out of 100, {{writing that}} the game [...] "isn't a {{complete}} product. It's close. And parts of it are just as fun, if not more so, than the earlier games, but {{a laundry list of}} bugs, hardware glitches, and severe multiplayer issues keep the game from reaching its potential." [...] He praised the single-player campaign and the storyline. However, he cited numerous bugs, including no support for Windows 95, despite the box claiming otherwise, and compatibility issues with Windows XP. He was also critical of the absence of Vengeance, despite the box stating it was included, and the fact that multiplayer mode had only five maps and no TCP/IP support. He concluded [...] "If you need your new Myth fix and can't wait for a patch, then the best option is to buy the game from a store that accepts returns in case the game doesn't like your particular system setup. If you can play it, focus your efforts on the campaign - it's fun, {{and for the most part}} works as advertised. Hopefully, by the time you are finished with Connacht's tale, a patch to fix the many multiplayer <b>issues</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> ready." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first story}} arc of The Fearless Defenders {{came to a}} close with issue #6 in July 2013. Bunn said, [...] "The first arc has {{definitely}} been very Asgardian. That's just the nature of doing a story about Valkyrie. As we go into the next arc, I take the opportunity to show that there are stories for this team in any number of environments... Issues #7-#12, while they tell a complete story, we're going to do a series of done-in-one stories with those issues. Each of those <b>issues</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> pretty good jumping-on points for anybody." [...] Issue #6 also featured the death of Annabelle Riggs, who Newsarama called [...] "one of Marvel's few prominent lesbian characters", which drew a strong reaction from fans. In response Bunn wrote, [...] "the fact that she was a lesbian didn’t even enter the equation for me, except that it was part of what made her who she was — just one part of many" [...] with Pyle adding, [...] "I feel very strongly that her sacrifice was very true to everything we love about her. As to whether {{the fact that she is}} a lesbian should have kept us from telling a story in which she died… in this particular case, not having this specific character sacrifice herself would have made for a story in which we were less emotionally invested." ...|$|E

Never will the ground be more favourable; never will the issues be more clearly or more vividly defined. Those <b>issues</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> whether the new taxation, which is admitted on all sides to be necessary, shall be imposed upon luxuries, superfluities, and monopolies, or upon the prime necessaries of life; whether you shall put your tax upon the unearned increment on land or upon the daily bread of labour; whether the policy of constructive social reform on which we are embarked, and which expands and deepens as we advance, shall be carried through and given a fair chance, or whether it shall be brought to a dead stop and all the energies and attention of the State devoted to Jingo armaments and senseless foreign adventure. And, lastly, the issue will be whether the British people in the year of grace 1909 are going to be ruled through a representative Assembly, elected by six or seven millions of voters, about which almost every one in the country, man or woman, has a chance of being consulted, or whether they are going to allow themselves to be dictated to and domineered over by a minute minority of titled persons, who represent nobody, who are answerable to nobody, and who only scurry up to London to vote in their party interests, in their class interests, and in their own interests.|$|E
