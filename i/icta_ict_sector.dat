This paper looks at the way creativity itself is being transformed in <b>ICT</b> <b>sector.</b> Creativity researchers tend to refer to creativity as an attribute of a person. But it may be a set of multiple attributes. How those multiple attributes might be arrayed in <b>ICT</b> <b>sector</b> is, as yet, an open question. Paper also describes an importance of creative thinking and the place of ICT in creative industries. People might show consistent individual differences in processes, domains, and styles of creative thinking. To be effective in innovation efforts, <b>ICT</b> <b>sector</b> has {{to take into account the}} nature of the strategy and organizational processes of innovation as a mixture of creativity, irrationality and feasibility. Innovation is not similar to performing regular 2 ̆ 01 ebusiness as usual". Innovation is to a large extent unpredictable, complex, dynamic, non-routine-based, and involves creativity and risk. Innovation is difficult to control and is extentialy an entrepreneurial process as such. People within a highly technical area have their ideas formed by technical possibilities, difference is important. Nevertheless, the idea can be used as a provocation from which to move forward. Without some emphasis on 'difference' there is the danger that all new ideas will immediately drain back to the traditional ideas. It is important to keep all the above points in mind. Otherwise people in a highly technical area will not accept that the basic tools of creativity can indeed be applied in their area. <b>ICT</b> <b>sector</b> is a rapidly changing sector.

In addition, recent studies of the European countries indicate that the region is now facing a weakening effect regarding the contribution of the knowledge economy, which slows economic growth. This study aims at investigating the contribution of the <b>ICT</b> <b>sectors</b> in driving economic performance in the European economies with a sectoral approach using the Input-Output (IO) methodology. The method measures the contribution of <b>ICT</b> <b>sectors</b> based on the OECD's definition (2009) and decomposing it into several variables. In addition, the study focuses on investigating one decomposition factor related to technological change effects. The results indicate that the growth of ICT sectors' output declined considerably during 2000 - 2005 compared to 1995 - 2000. The decomposition analysis found that the <b>ICT</b> <b>sectors</b> have lost the advantage of export and technological change effects. It has also been ascertained that the smaller impact of technological change effects is due to the lack of connection between the <b>ICT</b> <b>sectors</b> and other sectors on the production side.

40|$|The study {{set out to}} {{understand}} and demonstrate the role the <b>ICT</b> <b>sector</b> could play as a critical enabler in the transition and progress towards an energy– efficient, low carbon economy. More specifically, the study of sustaining ICT for sustainability has twofold intent: (2) to investigate the direct footprint of <b>ICT</b> <b>sector</b> and explore {{how it can be}} tackled through adopting sustainable design–based solutions; and (2) to highlight the enabling potential of <b>ICT</b> <b>sector</b> to mitigate climate change and massively improve energy efficiency across the economy, identifying and quantifying the global ICT impacts and opportunities in the context of energy and carbon emissions savings. To achieve the aim of this study, a pertinent and extensive literature review covering theoretical, empirical, and critical scholarship was performed to investigate the phenomenon. The study draws on a variety of sources to survey the unsustainability of <b>ICT</b> <b>sector</b> pertaining to energy–intensive consumption and explore potential solutions through espousing environmental design practice, and also to examine the role of ICT in delivering energy–efficient solutions through its products and services. Validity was ensured through using quality academic and industry literature as well as relevant studies carried out by a range of eminent researchers, experts, and stakeholders (i. e. NGOs, research centers). Findings highlight the unsustainability of <b>ICT</b> <b>sector</b> regarding energy– intensive consumption and concomitant GHG emissions associated with its products and services. Of the whole lifecycle, the use phase of ICT is the most critical. Data centers and telecom networks devour energy. Planned obsolescence entrenched in software design shorten upgrade cycle, which makes software utilities a planet killer as to energy consumption. Alternative sustainable design–based solutions entail using renewable energy and most efficient energy required over ICT’s life cycle – de–carbonization strategy. Also, digitization is an effective strategy for <b>ICT</b> <b>sector</b> to slash energy use per unit. To reduce the footprint of data centers and telecom networks, design solutions vary from hardware and software to technological improvements. Designing out built–in obsolescence in software technology is a key factor in the energy equation. As for the enabling role of ICT, the findings are highly illuminating. The <b>ICT</b> <b>sector</b> must step up its efforts in reducing its direct footprint in order to claim a leadership role in an energy–efficient, low carbon economy. Although the <b>ICT</b> <b>sector’s</b> own emissions will increase because of global growing demand for its products and services, the real gains will come from its enabling potential to yield substantial energy efficiency improvements and emissions reductions across the economy. The sheer scale of the climate change challenge presents smart development mitigation opportunities for <b>ICT</b> <b>sector</b> to deliver environmentally sustainable solutions. The largest identified opportunities are: dematerialization; intelligent transport and logistics; intelligent buildings; smart power supply; and efficient industrial processes and systems. This study provides a novel approach into sustainable design in ICT, underlining unsustainable design practices in <b>ICT</b> <b>sector.</b> Review of the literature makes an advance on extant reviews by highlighting the synergic relationship between ICT design, sustainability, and the economy. + 46 704 35 21 3...|$|R
