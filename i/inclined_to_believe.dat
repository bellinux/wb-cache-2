5|$|Traditionally {{the work}} was {{ascribed}} to either Thomas or Richard, two monks of Ely mentioned in the text. The historian Antonia Gransden is <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that the work is by Richard, who is usually identified with the Richard who was recorded as sub-prior and prior of Ely, holding the latter office from 1177 until some time between 1189 and 1194. Blake thinks that Richard was the author, but he considers the evidence to be inconclusive. Janet Fairweather, a classicist and a recent translator of the Liber, suggests {{that it may have}} been written by someone other than the traditional candidates. Whoever the author, the Liber specifically states that it was written at the bidding of some members of the monastic community at Ely.|$|E

Weart's {{history of}} The Discovery of Global Warming states that: While neither {{scientists}} nor the public {{could be sure}} in the 1970s whether the world was warming or cooling, people were increasingly <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that global climate was on the move, and in no small way.|$|E

After some soul-searching, he decides to remain in Naples and study under Guido, holding off on revenge until after Carlo and his mother (also Carlo's lover and later wife) have children to ensure the family line.|$|E

25|$|On 24 November 1793, {{the arrest}} of all the former tax farmers was ordered. Lavoisier and the other Farmers General faced nine accusations of defrauding the state of money owed to it, and of adding water to tobacco before selling it. Lavoisier drafted their defence, refuting the {{financial}} accusations, reminding the court of how they had maintained a consistently high quality of tobacco. The court was however <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that by condemning them and seizing their goods, it would recover huge sums for the state. Lavoisier was convicted and guillotined on 8 May 1794 in Paris, {{at the age of}} 50, along with his 27 co-defendants.|$|E
500|$|According {{to early}} {{versions}} of punctuated equilibrium, [...] "peripheral isolates" [...] {{are considered to}} be of critical importance for speciation. However, Darwin wrote, [...] "I can by no means agree ... that immigration and isolation are necessary elements.... Although isolation is of great importance in the production of new species, on the whole I am <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that largeness of area is still more important, especially for the production of species which shall prove capable of enduring for a long period, and of spreading widely." ...|$|E

No oxygen was evolved at the positive electrode, but a brown solution formed there. For the reasons given when speaking of the chlorides (766.), and because a fused cyanide of potassium evolves cyanogen at the positive electrode[A], I <b>incline</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that the cyanide in solution is directly decomposed.|$|R

500|$|Whig {{politicians}} believed Parliament had {{the right}} to determine the succession, and bestow it on the nearest Protestant relative of the Queen, while many Tories were more <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> in the hereditary right of the Catholic Stuarts, who were nearer relations. In 1710, George announced that he would succeed in Britain by hereditary right, as the right had been removed from the Stuarts, and he retained it. [...] "This declaration was meant to scotch any Whig interpretation that parliament had given him the kingdom ...convince the Tories that he was no usurper." ...|$|E
500|$|The poem {{most likely}} {{originated}} in the poetry that Gray composed in 1742. William Mason, in Memoirs, discussed his friend Gray and the origins of Elegy: [...] "I am <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that the Elegy in a Country Church-yard was begun, if not concluded, at this time [...] also: Though I am aware that as it stands at present, the conclusion is of a later date; how that was originally I shall show in my notes on the poem." [...] Mason's argument was a guess, but he argued that one of Gray's poems from the Eton Manuscript, a copy of Gray's handwritten poems owned by Eton College, was a 22-stanza rough draft of the Elegy called [...] "Stanza's Wrote in a Country Church-Yard". The manuscript copy contained many ideas which were reworked and revised as he attempted {{to work out the}} ideas that would later form the Elegy. A later copy was entered into Gray's commonplace book and a third version, included in an 18 December 1750 letter, was sent to Thomas Wharton. The draft sent to Walpole was subsequently lost.|$|E
500|$|Historians {{disagree}} as to {{the strength}} of the evidence against Blackburn, and many of the federal and Confederate records relating to the case have been lost. Writing in the journal America's Civil War, U.S. Navy physician J. D. Haines notes that the Confederate agents who testified against Blackburn were of dubious reputation. Hyams in particular received immunity from prosecution and was paid for his testimony. Haines also points out that Blackburn's previous reputation as a humanitarian was ignored; in the hysteria following Lincoln's assassination, conspiracy theories abounded and Northerners were <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> the worst about anyone with Confederate sympathies. The New York Times vilified Blackburn as [...] "The Yellow Fever Fiend" [...] and [...] "a hideous devil". Historian Edward Steers concedes that the evidence against Blackburn was circumstantial, but in his book Blood on the Moon, he contends that enough evidence survives not only to prove Blackburn's involvement in the plot, but to show that high-ranking Confederate officials up to and including President Jefferson Davis were aware of, condoned, and financed it. If true, Blackburn's plot would have represented one of the earliest attempts at biological warfare.|$|E

500|$|In {{the episodes}} prior to [...] "Beyond the Sea", the protagonists of The X-Files are firmly {{established}} in the roles of believer (Mulder) and rational scientist/skeptic (Scully). [...] "Beyond the Sea" [...] is the first episode in which these roles are reversed. Scully, vulnerable {{after the death of}} her father, is persuaded by Boggs' apparent psychic ability. Meanwhile, Mulder refuses to believe the serial killer, discounts any evidence in Boggs' favor and will only consider rational explanations. According to Jan Delsara, Scully is <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> Boggs because she identifies with him: they both understand the pressure of high family expectations. Scully strongly desired to make her father proud, despite not fulfilling his expectation that she became a doctor, and Boggs, in killing his family, had hoped to kill their expectations and judgment of him. In contrast, Mulder's relationship with his parents, based on resentment of them for their failure to protect his sister (themes developed later in the series), makes him unwilling to identify with Boggs. While Scully follows her instinct and solves the case, Mulder gets shot and ends up in the hospital because of his doubts and skepticism. According to Joe Bellon, as the episode progresses, even Scully's personality becomes like Mulder's and [...] "for all narrative purposes, she becames Mulder for almost an entire episode." [...] According to Dean A. Kowalski, this role reversal of the partners represents a [...] "blending" [...] of Mulder and Scully's characters that is present throughout the series.|$|E
500|$|Francis {{expresses a}} resentment {{of all forms}} of authority, {{particularly}} during the end of the frame story, when he feels he has been institutionalized because of the madness of the authorities, not because there is anything wrong with him. Francis can be seen, at least within the main narrative, as a symbol of reason and enlightenment triumphing over the irrational tyrant and unmasking the absurdity of social authority. But Kracauer contended the frame story undermines that premise. He argues if not for the frame story, the tale of Francis's efforts against Dr. Caligari would have been a praiseworthy example of independence and rebellion against authority. However, with the addition of the frame story, which places the veracity of Francis's claims into question, Kracauer argues the film glorifies authority and turns a reactionary story into an authoritarian film: [...] "The result of these modifications was to falsify the action and to ultimately reduce it to the ravings of a madman." [...] Kracauer believed these changes were not necessarily intentional, but rather an [...] "instinctive submission to the necessities of the screen" [...] because commercial films had to [...] "answer to mass desires". Fritz Lang disagreed with Kracaucer's argument, and instead believes the frame story makes the film's revolutionary inclinations more convincing, not less. David Robinson said, as time passed, filmgoers have been less inclined to interpret the film as a vindication of authority because modern audiences have grown more skeptical of authority in general, and are more <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> Francis's story and interpret the asylum director as wrongly committing Francis to silence him.|$|E

5|$|As Ukrainian {{psychiatrist}} Ada Korotenko notes, {{the use of}} punitive psychiatry allowed {{of avoiding}} the judicial procedure during which the accused might declare the impossibility to speak publicly and the violation of their civil rights. Making a psychiatric diagnosis is insecure and can {{be based on a}} preconception. Moreover, while diagnosing mental illness, subjective fuzzy diagnostic criteria are involved as arguments. The lack of clear diagnostic criteria and clearly defined standards of diagnostics contributes to applying punitive psychiatry to vigorous and gifted citizens who disagree with authorities. At the same time, most psychiatrists <b>incline</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that such a misdiagnosis is less dangerous than not diagnosing mental illness.|$|R

6000|$|... 765. In the dilute acid (761.), I {{conclude}} that {{a part of}} the water is electro-chemically decomposed, giving origin to the oxygen, which appears mingled with the chlorine at the anode. The oxygen may be viewed as a secondary result; but I <b>incline</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that it is not so; for, if it were, it might be expected in largest proportion from the stronger acid, whereas the reverse is the fact. This consideration, with others, also leads me to {{conclude that}} muriatic acid is more easily decomposed by the electric current than water; since, even when diluted with eight or nine times its quantity of the latter fluid, it alone gives way, the water remaining unaffected.|$|R

So Annette, who had pined and drooped under {{the loss of}} the twin-like companionship of her sister, was sent out as on an adventure, in much trepidation and mysterious dread of Captain Martindale, by no means consistent with the easy good nature of his days of courtship.
