25|$|The <b>down</b> <b>tube</b> {{connects the}} head tube {{to the bottom}} bracket shell. On racing {{bicycles}} and some mountain and hybrid bikes, the derailleur cables run along the <b>down</b> <b>tube,</b> or inside the <b>down</b> <b>tube.</b> On older racing bicycles, the shift levers were mounted on the <b>down</b> <b>tube.</b> On newer ones, they are mounted with the brake levers on the handlebars.|$|E

5000|$|A manual planter is {{sometimes}} called a bell planter, which may have two farm hands sitting on the back whilst taking potatoes from a hopper. The length between potatoes is tolled by a bell, {{at the sound of}} which potatoes are thrown <b>down</b> <b>tubes.</b>|$|R
25|$|In a {{cantilever}} {{bicycle frame}} the seat stays continue past the seat post and curve downwards {{to meet with}} the <b>down</b> <b>tube.</b> Cantilever frames are popular on the cruiser bicycle, the lowrider bicycle, and the wheelie bike. In many cantilever frames the only straight tubes are the seat tube and the head tube.|$|E
25|$|The great {{majority}} of modern bicycles have a frame with upright seating that looks much like the first chain-driven bike. These upright bicycles almost always feature the diamond frame, a truss consisting of two triangles: the front triangle and the rear triangle. The front triangle consists of the head tube, top tube, <b>down</b> <b>tube,</b> and seat tube. The head tube contains the headset, the set of bearings that allows the fork to turn smoothly for steering and balance. The top tube connects the head tube to the seat tube at the top, and the <b>down</b> <b>tube</b> connects the head tube to the bottom bracket. The rear triangle consists of the seat tube and paired chain stays and seat stays. The chain stays run parallel to the chain, connecting the bottom bracket to the rear dropout, where the axle for the rear wheel is held. The seat stays connect {{the top of the}} seat tube (at or near the same point as the top tube) to the rear fork ends.|$|E
25|$|Combining {{different}} {{materials can}} provide the desired stiffness, compliance, or damping in different areas better than can be accomplished with a single material. The combined materials are usually carbon fiber and a metal, either steel, aluminum, or titanium. One implementation of this approach includes a metal <b>down</b> <b>tube</b> and chain stays with carbon top tube, seat tube, and seat stays. Another is a metal main triangle and chain stays with just carbon seat stays.|$|E
50|$|After some hours, the {{continuous}} region of precipitation {{is followed by}} a clear region with no sensible precipitate, followed by a short region of precipitate further <b>down</b> the <b>tube.</b> This process continues <b>down</b> the <b>tube</b> forming several, perhaps a couple of dozen regions of clearing, then precipitation rings.|$|R
50|$|March 1986 saw {{a largely}} {{cosmetic}} reworking of the H100-S, {{to form the}} H100-SII. This model received bolted-on frame <b>down</b> <b>tubes</b> which gave {{the appearance of a}} conventional cradle-frame motorcycle. The ignition system was reverted to CDI, and all other changes were in terms of paint and graphics.|$|R
5000|$|Tecnos; Colnago's lightest steel racing frame {{made from}} 1995-2000. Custom Tecnos tubeset made with Columbus Nivachrom steel, {{oversize}} top and <b>down</b> <b>tubes</b> with five-leaf-clover shaping. Chromed three point crown-tip lugs on head tube and Precisa steel fork (when not {{used with a}} carbon fork). Last iteration was labeled 'Tecnos 2000' including the tubing label.|$|R
25|$|The chain stays run {{parallel}} to the chain, connecting the bottom bracket shell to the rear fork ends or dropouts. When the rear derailleur cable is routed partially along the <b>down</b> <b>tube,</b> it is also routed along the chain stay. Occasionally (principally on frames made since the late 1990s) mountings for disc brakes will {{be attached to the}} chain stays. There may be a small brace that connects the chain stays in front of the rear wheel and behind the bottom bracket shell.|$|E
25|$|The {{bottom bracket}} shell is a short and large {{diameter}} tube, relative to the other tubes in the frame, that runs side to side and holds the bottom bracket. It is usually threaded, often left-hand threaded on the right (drive) side of the bike to prevent loosening by fretting induced precession, and right-hand threaded on the left (non-drive) side. There are many variations, such as an eccentric bottom bracket, which allows for adjustment in tension of the bicycle's chain. It is typically larger, unthreaded, and sometimes split. The chain stays, seat tube, and <b>down</b> <b>tube</b> all typically connect to the {{bottom bracket shell}}.|$|E
25|$|The cyclist battalions were {{organised}} {{like the}} infantry, and were mainly used as despatch riders. Later, during the periods of semi-open warfare in 1917 and 1918 they operated {{in a manner}} similar to cavalry, conducting reconnaissance and patrolling. However, the nature of trench warfare and the mud and rubble that was often encountered on the battlefield meant that they were mostly unsuited to this role. Other tasks performed included laying communications cabling, traffic control, unloading stores from railway wagons, harvesting crops, and burial of the dead. The soldiers were equipped with a variety of bicycle models made by the Birmingham Small Arms Company, ranging from the Mark I to the Mark IV, and were issued the standard Short Magazine Lee Enfield (SMLE) rifle, which was either attached to the bicycle's <b>down</b> <b>tube,</b> or slung across their back. Lewis guns were also used.|$|E

500|$|Klein held {{a patent}} (...) for an {{improved}} {{method of routing}} cables through the frame of a bicycle, that reduced aerodynamic drag and stress on the frame. The front and rear derailleur cables were routed through the <b>down</b> <b>tube,</b> and the rear brake cable through the top tube, although some models changed in 2002 to top tube cable routing for greater harmonisation with Shimano components.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the diamond}} frame, the main [...] "triangle" [...] is not {{actually}} a triangle because {{it consists of}} four tubes: the head tube, top tube, <b>down</b> <b>tube</b> and seat tube. The rear triangle consists of the seat tube joined by paired chain stays and seat stays.|$|E
2500|$|The {{head tube}} {{contains}} the headset, the interface with the fork. The top tube connects the head tube {{to the seat}} tube at the top. [...] The top tube may be positioned horizontally (parallel to the ground), or it may slope downwards towards the seat tube for additional stand-over clearance. [...] The <b>down</b> <b>tube</b> connects the head tube to the bottom bracket shell.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{discusses}} {{the concept and}} benefits of the MaglevTube Puckpodcar rapid personal transportation system (the MLT system), for which provisional patents were filed early in 2011. The track for the MLT system runs <b>down</b> a <b>tube</b> {{to protect it from}} atmospheric conditions such as rain and snow, while wind is generated <b>down</b> the <b>tubes</b> to limit wind resistance. The Puckpodcar uses only rare earth permanent magnets, making it very cost effective to construct and operate, and up to 8 maglev tracks run <b>down</b> the <b>tubes</b> to ensure utmost safety and performance. The MLT solution was designed to provide highly reliable, low cost, high speed mass transportation at a low cost in urban areas and between cities...|$|R

2500|$|In Belgium, the Minerva company, later {{known for}} luxury cars, started out {{manufacturing}} standard safety bicycles in 1897, before expanding into light cars and [...] "motocyclettes" [...] from 1900. They produced lightweight clip-on engines that mounted below the front <b>down</b> <b>tube,</b> specifically for Minerva bicycles, but {{also available in}} kit form suitable for almost any bicycle. The engine drove a belt turning a large gear wheel attached {{to the opposite side}} of the rear wheel as the chain. By 1901 the kit engine was a 211cc unit developing 1.5hp, comfortably cruising at [...] at 1,500rpm, capable of a top speed of , and getting fuel consumption in the range of [...] These kits were exported around the world to countries including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Australia, and other British territories of the time.|$|E
2500|$|External gearing is {{so called}} {{because all the}} {{sprockets}} involved are readily visible. There may be up to 4 chainrings attached to the crankset and pedals, and typically between 5 and 11 sprockets making up the cogset attached to the rear wheel. Modern front and rear derailleurs typically consist of a moveable chain-guide that is operated remotely by a Bowden cable attached to a shifter mounted on the <b>down</b> <b>tube,</b> handlebar stem, or handlebar. A shifter may be a single lever, or a pair of levers, or a twist grip; some shifters may be incorporated with brake levers into a single unit. When a rider operates the shifter while pedalling, the change in cable tension moves the chain-guide from side to side, [...] "derailing" [...] the chain onto different sprockets. The rear derailleur also has spring-mounted jockey wheels which take up any slack in the chain.|$|E
