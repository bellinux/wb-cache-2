5|$|During the series' fifty-year history {{only a few}} of {{the films}} have {{remained}} substantially true to their source material; Dr. No has many similarities to the novel and follows its basic plot, but there are a few notable omissions. Major elements from the novel that are missing from the film include Bond's fight with a giant squid, and the escape from Dr. No's complex using the dragon-disguised swamp buggy. Elements of the novel that were significantly changed for the film include the use of a (non-venomous) tarantula spider instead of a centipede; Dr. No's secret complex being disguised as a bauxite mine instead of a guano quarry; Dr. No's plot to disrupt NASA space launches from Cape Canaveral using a radio beam instead of disrupting US missile testing on Turks Island; the method of Dr. No's death by boiling in overheating reactor coolant rather than a burial under a chute of guano, and the introduction of SPECTRE, an organisation absent from the book. Components absent from the novel but added to the film include the introduction of the Bond character in a <b>gambling</b> <b>casino,</b> the introduction of Bond's semi-regular girlfriend Sylvia Trench, a fight scene with an enemy chauffeur, a fight scene to introduce Quarrel, the seduction of Miss Taro, Bond's recurring CIA ally Felix Leiter, Dr. No's partner in crime Professor Dent and Bond's controversial cold-blooded killing of this character.|$|E

40|$|Personal {{bankruptcies}} {{soared in}} the United States between 1994 and 1998. One activity that can precipitate personal financial crises {{and that has}} also experienced dramatic growth is commercial <b>gambling,</b> especially <b>casino</b> <b>gambling.</b> This article builds a simple model of bankruptcy choice and empirically tests the model using unique county-level data on debt, income, household age, population density, and <b>casino</b> <b>gambling</b> as well as state measures of employment and marital stability, health insurance coverage, and garnishment restrictions. The authors find that the proximity of <b>casino</b> <b>gambling</b> appears {{to be associated with}} higher bankruptcy rates, but that the local impact is far more pronounced than the influence of <b>casino</b> <b>gambling</b> on the national filing rate. To quantify the magnitude of the impact, the analysis predicts over a 5 % decline in 1998 filing rates for counties surrounding a casino, and a 1 % decline in the nationwide filing rate if one were to eliminate <b>casino</b> <b>gambling.</b> Consequently, although <b>casino</b> <b>gambling</b> exerts important local effects, nationwide the incidence and growth of <b>casino</b> <b>gambling</b> does not explain much of the rise in bankruptcies during the past decade.

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the influence of the}} business cycle on expenditures of three major types of legalized <b>gambling</b> activities: <b>Casino</b> <b>gambling,</b> lottery, and pari-mutuel wagering. Empirical results are obtained using monthly aggregated US per capita consumption time series for the period 1959. 01 - 2010. 08. Among the three gambling activities only lottery consumption appears to be recession-proof. This series is characterized by a vast and solid growth that exceeds the growth in income and the growth in other <b>gambling</b> sectors. <b>Casino</b> <b>gambling</b> expenditures show a positive growth during expansions and no growth during recessions. Hence, the loss in income during recessions affects <b>casino</b> <b>gambling.</b> However, income shocks which are not directly related to the business cycle do not influence <b>casino</b> <b>gambling</b> expenditures. Pari-mutuel wagering displays an overall negative trend and its average growth rate is smaller than the growth in income, especially during recessions. The findings of this article provide important implications for the gambling industry and for local governments...|$|R
