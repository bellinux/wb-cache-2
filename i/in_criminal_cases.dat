5|$|In United States v. More (1805), the Court {{held that}} the {{ordinary}} means of appeal, the writ of error, could not be utilized <b>in</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>cases</b> from the circuit courts. This contributed {{to the importance of}} the certificate of division <b>in</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>cases.</b> The Marshall Court (18011835) heard thirty-one criminal cases arising from certificates of division; the Taney Court (1836–1864), fifteen; the Chase Court (1864–1873), seventeen; the Waite Court (18741888), thirty-eight; and the Fuller Court (18881910), fourteen.|$|E
5|$|We {{take this}} {{opportunity}} of expressing our anxiety, least, by too great indulgence to the wishes of counsel, questions of this sort should be frequently brought before this Court, and thus, in effect, an appeal <b>in</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>cases</b> become an ordinary proceeding to the manifest obstruction of public justice, and against the plain intendment of the acts of Congress.|$|E
5|$|The Marshall Court possessed {{jurisdiction}} <b>in</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>cases</b> only via writs {{of error}} from state courts, original writs of habeas corpus, and certificates of division from the circuit courts. In three cases involving certificates of division, the Marshall Court decided issues of double jeopardy, {{but did not}} clearly rely on the Double Jeopardy Clause. Similarly, the Marshall Court discussed the level of detail required for a sufficient indictment without explicitly citing the Information Clause of the Sixth Amendment.|$|E

Parties have a right to discovery <b>in</b> a <b>criminal</b> <b>case,</b> but discovery is not as extensive <b>in</b> a <b>criminal</b> <b>case</b> as <b>in</b> a civil case because the state must have completed most of its investigation before bringing criminal charges.|$|R
5|$|By the 1284 Statute of Rhuddlan, the Principality of Wales was {{incorporated}} into England and was given an administrative system like the English, with counties policed by sheriffs. English law was introduced <b>in</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>cases,</b> though the Welsh were allowed to maintain their own customary laws in some cases of property disputes. After 1277, and increasingly after 1283, Edward embarked on a full-scale project of English settlement of Wales, creating new towns like Flint, Aberystwyth and Rhuddlan. Their new residents were English migrants, with the local Welsh banned from living inside them, and many were protected by extensive walls.|$|E
5|$|During Marshall's tenure, the Supreme Court had no general appellate {{jurisdiction}} <b>in</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>cases.</b> The Court could review criminal convictions {{from the state}} courts, but not the lower federal courts, via writs of error. It only did so twice. The Court could hear original habeas petitions, but disclaimed the authority to grant the writ post-conviction unless the sentence had already been completed. Thus, {{the majority of the}} Marshall Court's opinions on criminal law were issued in response to questions certified by divided panels of the circuit courts by a certificate of division.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court had other, limited {{sources of}} appellate {{jurisdiction}} <b>in</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>cases.</b> The Court could hear criminal appeals {{from the state}} courts by writ of error, as authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1789. The Court could hear federal criminal appeals by certificate of division, as authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1802, original habeas petition, as authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1789, and mandamus, as authorized by the same act. Between 1867 and 1868, and after 1885, the Court had jurisdiction to hear writs of error from habeas petitions (a civil action) in the circuit courts. Beginning in 1850, the Court also entertained such appeals from the territorial courts. Attempts to utilize other prerogative writs as sources of jurisdiction were unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|As {{the seat}} of the Government of West Bengal, Kolkata is home to not only the offices of the local {{governing}} agencies, but also the West Bengal Legislative Assembly; the state secretariat, which is housed in the Writers' Building; and the Calcutta High Court. Most government establishments and institutions are housed in the centre of the city in B. B. D. Bagh (formerly known as Dalhousie Square). The Calcutta High Court is the oldest High Court in India. It was preceded by the Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort William which was established in 1774. The Calcutta High Court has jurisdiction over the state of West Bengal and the Union Territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Kolkata has lower courts: the Court of Small Causes and the City Civil Court decide civil matters; the Sessions Court rules <b>in</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>cases.</b> The Kolkata Police, headed by a police commissioner, is overseen by the West Bengal Ministry of Home Affairs. The Kolkata district elects two representatives to India's lower house, the Lok Sabha, and 11representatives to the state legislative assembly.|$|E
5|$|The Hale Commission was {{established}} by the Commonwealth of England on 30 January 1652 and led by Sir Matthew Hale to investigate law reform. Consisting of eight lawyers and thirteen laymen, the Commission met approximately {{three times a week}} and proposed changes as radical (at the time) as reducing the use of the death penalty, allowing witnesses, legal aid and lawyers for defendants <b>in</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>cases</b> and creating County Courts and a Court of Appeal for criminal cases. Though the Commission was unsuccessful at passing any of its measures under the Rump Parliament, two of its measures were put into law by the subsequent Barebone's Parliament, and, {{by the middle of the}} 20th century, most of the others were as well. Debate has occurred over the effectiveness and strife within the Commission between its more moderate and radical members; the general conclusion is that with the sheer volume of work produced and the vast proportion of moderate to radical members, it is unlikely such strife existed.|$|E
5|$|Two {{parallel}} investigations were undertaken, one by HSL {{and one by}} Namdal Police District. The latter criticized the former because there were not given access to the cockpit voice recorder (CVR). Since 1989 both {{the police and the}} prosecuting authority had not been represented in the accident investigations. HSL emphasized that they had no legal obligation to submit the tapes to the police, that the police had not asked for the tapes after Widerøe Flight 839 in 1990 and that the Ministry of Transport and Communications supported this line. The reason for the rules was that the Norwegian Airline Pilots Association did not want the records from the CVR to be used <b>in</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>cases</b> against pilots. The investigation board stated that they would forward any information which supported criminal violations, while Namdal Police District stated that it was necessary for an independent police investigation to identify any criminal violations. The Norwegian Data Inspectorate's director Georg Apenes supported the police in their request for the tapes.|$|E
