5|$|In November 1888, Karim {{was given}} four months' leave {{to return to}} India, during which time he visited his father. Karim wrote to Victoria that his father, who was due to retire, had hopes of a pension and that his former employer, John Tyler, was angling for promotion. As a result, {{throughout}} {{the first six months}} of 1889, Victoria wrote to the Viceroy of India, Lord Lansdowne, demanding action on Waziruddin's pension and Tyler's promotion. The Viceroy was reluctant to pursue the issues because Waziruddin had told the local governor, Sir Auckland Colvin, that he desired only <b>gratitude</b> <b>and</b> also because Tyler had a reputation for tactless behaviour and bad-tempered remarks.|$|E
5|$|In the Reformed confessions, the Lord's Supper is a {{meal that}} {{provides}} spiritual nourishment. Eating {{the body and}} drinking the blood of Christ in the sacrament is believed to spiritually strengthen Christians. Believers are already believed to be united with Christ, but the Supper serves to deepen and strengthen this union. The Supper is also a way to commemorate and proclaim the death and resurrection of Christ. Partakers are to express <b>gratitude</b> <b>and</b> praise to God in thanks for his death and the benefits it provides. The Supper is believed to assure Christians of their salvation and union with Christ, which has been communicated {{to them in the}} preaching of the gospel. The Supper is also believed to enhance Christians' union with one another. It calls Christians to love and obey Christ, and to live in harmony with other Christians.|$|E

25|$|Contrary to {{the common}} pejorative {{doctrine}} pertaining to the Old Testament held in some Christian groups that Jewish korbanot were for sins, which is a well known fallacy, their use was far more complex—only some korbanot in mostly one rare restrictive circumstance were used to atone for unintentional sins, and these sacrifices only accompanied the important required core means of atonement to be ever considered legitimate. Besides this one exception, there were {{the overwhelming majority of}} other purposes for bringing korbanot, and the expiatory effect is often incidental, and is subject to significant limitations. Korbanot are brought purely for the purpose of communing with God and becoming closer to him.
