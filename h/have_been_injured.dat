Over 230,000 civilians have been confirmed dead by the Haitian government because of the disaster and around 300,000 <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>injured.</b> Approximately 1.2 million people are homeless and {{it has been reported that}} the lack of temporary shelter may lead to the outbreak of disease.|$|E

5|$|In Moscow, around 6,000 {{police were}} on duty {{to prevent a}} repeat of the 2008 UEFA Cup Final riots a week earlier, but police {{reported}} that none of the 40,000 visiting fans were arrested, due in part to public safety measures such as a ban on public drinking and no large screens being set up for members of the public to watch the game outdoors. In London, violence escalated outside Fulham Broadway tube station, near Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground; police arrested 12 people on public order offences, while one man was arrested for grievous bodily harm, drink driving and dangerous driving, after he hit a 31-year-old while attempting to drive down Fulham Broadway.

5|$|In early 1612, {{the year}} of the trials, every justice of the peace (JP) in Lancashire was ordered to compile a list of recusants in their area, i.e. those who refused to attend the English Church and to take communion, a {{criminal}} offence at that time. Roger Nowell of Read Hall, on the edge of Pendle Forest, was the JP for Pendle. It was against this background of seeking out religious nonconformists that, in March 1612, Nowell investigated a complaint made to him by the family of John Law, a pedlar, who claimed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>injured</b> by witchcraft. Many of those who subsequently became implicated as the investigation progressed did indeed consider themselves to be witches, in the sense of being village healers who practised magic, probably in return for payment, but such men and women were common in 16th-century rural England, an accepted part of village life.|$|E
5|$|On 14 February (referred to as Day of Rage by protest organisers), about 6,000 {{people took}} part in many protests around Bahrain {{demanding}} the release of previously detained protesters, socio-economic justice, political reform and a constitutional monarchy.

In the evening, Ali Mushaima died from police shotgun wounds to his back at close range. The next day, thousands of mourners attended his funeral. During the ceremony police shot Fadhel Al-Matrook in the back at close range; he died from his wounds within an hour. People were then allowed to march to and occupy Pearl Roundabout, where they began to set up tents; the number of demonstrators had swelled to 10,000 people by nightfall.
