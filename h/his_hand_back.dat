5|$|The TNA World Tag Team Championship was {{defended by}} the team of A.J. Styles and Tomko against the team of Kevin Nash and Samoa Joe in the seventh encounter, lasting twelve minutes and ten seconds. Near the end, Joe went to tag in Nash, who instead pulled <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>back,</b> flipped Joe off, and left the ring. With Joe having to defend for himself, he fought off both Styles and Tomko before {{performing}} his signature Muscle Buster maneuver on Styles, gaining a near-fall that was broken up by Tomko. Tomko and Styles then performed their signature tag team TornadoPlex maneuver forcing Joe into the mat to retain the TNA World Tag Team Championship.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1992, a special balcony was {{constructed}} on the upper level of the synagogue at 770 Eastern Parkway overlooking the main sanctuary to allow Schneerson to participate at the daily prayers. It soon became customary for many chassidim to recite the Yechi after prayer to which Schneerson made encouraging motions {{with his left hand}} (his right side had been paralyzed by the stroke). On certain occasions; the Rebbe made increasingly big signs of either encouragement or displeasure such as on Rosh Chodesh Kislev 1992 (5753); when the Rebbe moved <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>back</b> and forth with extreme energy.|$|E
6000|$|Purdy {{snatched}} <b>his</b> thin <b>hands</b> from <b>his</b> pockets, {{pulled up}} his trousers, thrust <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>back</b> into <b>his</b> pockets, tilted {{in the heavy}} oak chair, and tried to look amused, as he struggled: ...|$|R
60|$|I do {{not know}} how long a time passed by. I lying where I was upon the deck, {{overcome}} with terror and remorse and shame: he standing with the stay in <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>backed</b> against the bulwarks, and regarding me with an expression singularly mingled. At last he spoke.|$|R
60|$|He left her. <b>His</b> <b>hands</b> went <b>back</b> into <b>his</b> pockets, and his {{monotonous}} march up {{and down}} the room began again.|$|R
2500|$|Though he mostly fielded {{close to}} the wicket, Sobers was an {{exceptional}} outfielder who was seen on one occasion, when he had fielded {{the ball on the}} boundary, to [...] "bend <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>back</b> almost parallel with his arm before flipping the ball a full seventy yards to the wicketkeeper".|$|E
2500|$|Chow {{emerges from}} the limo and kills Marshall, {{allowing}} the Wolfpack to live because Alan saved his life. He offers Alan a bar of gold as a gift, but Alan turns him down and trolls Chow by pretending to end their friendship because of Chow's unhealthy influence on the group (but pulls a fast one on Chow when he takes <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>back</b> from a handshake) and Chow tells Alan he is [...] "...cold as ice". As Chow sadly watches them leave, they go to retrieve Phil's minivan from the pawnshop and Alan makes a date with Cassie. Six months later, the two marry. Vowing to stop with his antics, Alan regretfully resigns from the Wolfpack but would still like for the gang to hang out on occasion. As the four walk to the ceremony, a montage of clips from the previous films play.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fifth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), God {{directed}} Moses to tell Israel's elders what God had promised, and predicted {{that they would}} heed Moses and go with him to tell Pharaoh that God had met with them and request that Pharaoh allow them to go three days' journey into the wilderness to sacrifice to God. God knew that Pharaoh would not let them go unless forced by a mighty hand, so God would strike Egypt with wonders, and then Pharaoh would let them go. God would make the Egyptians view the Israelites favorably, so that the Israelites would not leave empty handed, but every woman would ask her neighbor for jewels and clothing and the Israelites would strip the Egyptians. Moses predicted {{that they would not}} believe him, so God told him to cast his rod on the ground, and it became a serpent, and Moses fled from it. God told Moses to take it by the tail, he did so, and it became a rod again. God explained that this was so that they might believe that God had appeared to Moses. Then God told Moses to put his hand into his bosom, he did, and when he took it out, his hand was leprous, as white as snow. God told him to put <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>back</b> into his bosom, he did, and when he took it out, it had returned to normal. God predicted that if they would not heed the first sign, then they would believe the second sign, and if they would not believe those two signs, then Moses was to take water from the river and pour it on the land, and the water would become blood. Moses protested that he was not a man of words but was slow of speech, but God asked him who had made man's mouth, so Moses should go, and God would teach him what to say. Moses pleaded with God to send someone else, and God became angry with Moses. God said that Moses' well-spoken brother Aaron was coming to meet him, Moses would tell him the words that God would teach them, he would be Moses' spokesman, and Moses would be like God to him. And God told Moses to take his staff with him to perform signs. The fifth reading ( [...] , aliyah) and the fourth open portion ( [...] , petuchah) end here.|$|E

60|$|Tying the Thumbs.--To {{secure a}} {{prisoner}} {{with the least}} amount of string, place <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>back</b> to back, behind him, then tie the thumbs together, and also the little fingers. Two bits of thin string, each a foot long, will thoroughly do this. But if you have not any string at hand, cut a thong from his leathern apron, or tear a strip from you own linen.|$|R

60|$|The bell clanged and the {{car pulled}} out, leaving Martin {{wondering}} as {{to the nature of}} the crinkly, greasy wad he clutched in <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b> <b>Back</b> in his room he unrolled it and found a hundred-dollar bill.|$|E

60|$|As soon as {{the first}} man had {{recovered}} the breath knocked out of him by the irresistible charge, a scream of mad cursing issued from the stern-sheets. With a rigid, angular crooking of the elbow, {{the man at the}} tiller put <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>back</b> to his hip.|$|E

It was my doing--it was all my doing!" ...|$|E

6000|$|The Pere had got {{upon his}} feet, toward the last, {{and now he}} stood there passing <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>back</b> and forth across his {{forehead}} like {{a person who is}} dazed and troubled; then he turned and wandered toward the door of his little workroom, and as he passed through it I heard him murmur sorrowfully: ...|$|E
60|$|He {{had half}} {{intended}} {{to put out}} his hand again, under some mistaken idea that the tunnel afforded him an opportunity. The whole journey was one long opportunity, had he desired it; but his wife hated tunnels, and so he drew <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>back</b> again. Lily's little fingers would have been ready for his touch. He thought of this, and could not help thinking of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look'ee, fellow," [...] {{he called}} to Blunt, [...] "thou art he who struck me whilst I was down some while since. Wilt thou let this quarrel stand between thee and me, and meet me man to man without weapon? See, I throw me down mine own, and will meet thee with bare hands."

60|$|I {{turned my}} eyes {{down to the}} peep-hole. Bud had moved over {{squarely}} {{into the light of}} the door. He was bending over something. Then he extended <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>back</b> uppermost, toward Buell. On the back of that broad brown hand were pieces of leaf and bits of pine-needles. The trembling of my body had shaken these from the brush on the rickety loft. More than that, in the yellow bar of sunlight which streamed in at the door there floated particles of dust.|$|E
6000|$|How {{often had}} {{he heard it}} in the old days: [...] "Josiah!--you!" [...] A shiver went through him. Involuntarily, automatically, with a guilty start, he turned <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>back</b> upward so that the cigar was hidden. He felt himself {{shrinking}} and shrivelling as she stepped out on the stoop. It was his unchanged wife, the same shrew wrinkles, with the same sour-drooping corners to the thin-lipped mouth. But there was more sourness, an added droop, the lips were thinner, and the shrew wrinkles were deeper. She swept Josiah with a hostile, withering stare.|$|E
6000|$|Then Kipps made {{to bring}} <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>back,</b> {{and felt the}} keen touch of {{the edge of the}} broken glass at his wrist. He turned dolefully. [...] "I'm tremendously sorry," [...] he said in answer to the {{accusation}} in Miss Walshingham's eyes. [...] "I didn't think it would break like that,"--as if he had expected it to break in some quite different and entirely more satisfactory manner.

60|$|John turned colour a little, then he drew {{himself up}} {{deliberately}} and put <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> behind <b>his</b> <b>back.</b>|$|R
60|$|Valentine, {{in a blue}} serge suit, with a {{straw hat}} in <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> comes <b>back</b> in high spirits, out of breath with the haste he has made. Gloria turns {{from the window and}} studies him with {{freezing}} attention.|$|R
