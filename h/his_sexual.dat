The illegitimate son of the evil patriarch Alistair Crane, Chad is {{introduced}} as a music producer from Los Angeles who is searching for his biological family.

5|$|Robinson {{is widely}} {{known for being}} the first priest in an openly gay {{relationship}} to be consecrated a bishop in a major Christian denomination believing in the historic episcopate. <b>His</b> <b>sexual</b> orientation was privately acknowledged in the 1970s, when he studied in seminary, was ordained, married, and started a family. He went public with <b>his</b> <b>sexual</b> identity and divorced in 1986. He entered a formal relationship with his second partner, Mark Andrew, in 1988. When delegates to the Episcopal convention were voting on the ratification of his election, it became an issue of controversy. His election was ratified 62 to 45. After his election, many theologically conservative Episcopalians in the United States abandoned the Episcopal Church, formed the Anglican Church in North America (ACNA) and aligned themselves with bishops outside the Episcopal Church in the United States, a process called the Anglican realignment. His story has appeared in print and film.|$|E

He separated from his wife when she learned of the affair in 1965, and they divorced three years later.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{during his}} college tour, Chapman {{mentioned}} that a television audience member {{had written to}} the Pythons to complain about them having a gay member, adding that the Bible said any man who lies with a man should be taken out and stoned. With other Pythons already aware of <b>his</b> <b>sexual</b> orientation, Idle jokingly replied that they had found the perpetrator and killed him. Both Sherlock and Tomiczek remained a constant in Chapman's life. In the mid-1980s, having resettled in Britain, the three moved to Maidstone, Kent.|$|E

Rockslide apologizes, swearing that he did not know. Later, in a misguided attempt at group bonding, Rockslide voices his acceptance of Anole's sexuality, outing him to some of the other students, though Loa states that she was already aware and that everyone already knew.|$|E

5|$|After Driberg {{had risen}} to {{responsible}} positions within the school (deputy head boy, head librarian, and chief sacristan, among others), his Lancing career ended suddenly {{in the autumn of}} 1923, when two boys complained about <b>his</b> <b>sexual</b> overtures. To avoid distressing the widowed Amy Driberg (John Driberg had died in 1919), the headmaster allowed him to remain in the school {{for the remainder of the}} term, stripped of his offices and segregated from all social contact with other boys. At the end of the term he was required to leave, on the pretext that he needed private tuition to pass his Oxford entrance examination which he had failed the previous summer. Back in Crowborough, after several months' hard application under the guidance of his tutor, the future Lord Justice Pearson, Driberg won a classics scholarship to Christ Church, Oxford.|$|E

Both Barry and Jerry are stunned but fascinated by Cary's sordid and evil story. When Barry tries to persuade Jerry to reveal <b>his</b> best <b>sexual</b> experience, Jerry refuses.

5|$|As {{an adult}} Reich wrote extensively, in his diary, about <b>his</b> <b>sexual</b> precocity. He {{maintained}} {{that his first}} sexual experience was {{at the age of}} four when he tried to have sex with the family maid (with whom he shared a bed), that he would regularly watch the farm animals have sex, that he used a whip handle sexually on the horses while masturbating, and that he had almost daily sexual intercourse from the age of 11 with another of the servants. He wrote of regular visits to brothels, the first when he was 15, and said he was visiting them daily from the age of around 17. He also developed sexual fantasies about his mother, writing when he was 22 that he masturbated while thinking about her.|$|E

5|$|Because he {{is prone}} to bouts of {{clinical}} depression, after a fainting spell (triggered by a panic attack), Tony's physician refers him for treatment from psychiatrist Dr. Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco), in the show's first episode. She treats Tony {{to the best of}} her ability {{despite the fact that they}} routinely clash over various issues. Melfi is usually thoughtful, rational and humane—a stark contrast to Tony's personality. Tony, a serial womanizer, occasionally divulges <b>his</b> <b>sexual</b> attraction to Dr. Melfi; Melfi harbors some degree of attraction to Tony, too, but never admits or acts on it. Melfi is far more attracted to Tony's dangerousness and power. She is drawn to the challenge of helping such an unusual client, and naively assumes that their doctor-patient relationship will not affect her personal life in any way.|$|E

When Andy hears about this, he realizes that many people have thought this {{about him in the}} past and gets increasingly insecure as he begins to question <b>his</b> <b>sexual</b> orientation. Jim and Pam, who were trying to keep Pam's pregnancy a secret, think they have been found out. The couple then notice that there have been various absurd rumors about office employees being spread. When Jim brings it to everyone's attention, they trace one particular rumor back to Michael, who then tries to slip out of the office.|$|E
