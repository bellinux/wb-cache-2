5|$|He {{also wrote}} an <b>insensitive</b> letter to Queen Mary, {{which has since}} been lost.|$|E
5|$|The name Adolph has {{subsequently}} been retired by the World Meteorological Association, amid {{concern that}} future {{use of the}} name would be politically <b>insensitive.</b>|$|E
5|$|Barium {{hydroxide}} ("baryta") {{was known}} to alchemists, who produced it by heating barium carbonate. Unlike calcium hydroxide, it absorbs very little CO2 in aqueous solutions and is therefore <b>insensitive</b> to atmospheric fluctuations. This property is used in calibrating pH equipment.|$|E
5|$|In 2017, Gone {{with the}} Wind was {{pulled from the}} {{schedule}} at the Orpheum Theatre in Memphis, Tennessee after a 34-year run of annual showings due to its perceived racially <b>insensitive</b> content.|$|E
5|$|Free-speech advocates {{condemned}} {{the seizure of}} the painting, while the aldermen maintained that the painting was an insult to Washington {{and should have been}} taken down. Some students at the SAIC showed their support for free speech by holding rallies in front of the school and at the Richard J. Daley Plaza, while other students criticized Nelson for poor timing in showing a racially <b>insensitive</b> image.|$|E
5|$|Holographic {{interferometry}} {{was discovered}} by accident {{as a result of}} mistakes committed during the making of holograms. Early lasers were relatively weak and photographic plates were <b>insensitive,</b> necessitating long exposures during which vibrations or minute shifts might occur in the optical system. The resultant holograms, which showed the holographic subject covered with fringes, were considered ruined.|$|E
5|$|Medical {{conditions}} that commonly cause a high-androgen state, such as polycystic ovary syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and androgen-secreting tumors, can cause acne in affected individuals. Conversely, people who lack androgenic hormones or are <b>insensitive</b> {{to the effects}} of androgens rarely have acne. An increase in androgen and oily sebum synthesis can be seen during pregnancy. Acne can be a side effect of testosterone replacement therapy or of anabolic steroid use. Over-the-counter bodybuilding and dietary supplements are commonly found to contain illegally added anabolic steroids.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} {{anniversary of the}} crash, a plaque on the Charles Landley Bridge was unveiled. The bridge crosses the rail tracks {{at the site of}} the accident, and a {{makeshift}} memorial had been maintained there by victims' families. NTSB chairwoman Deborah Hersman attended the unveiling along with Mayor Gray. Another memorial plaque was also installed, by Metro officials, at Fort Totten station; it was subject to complaints from relatives of the dead, who claimed that it was <b>insensitive.</b>|$|E
5|$|Public opinion, {{based upon}} the {{immediate}} media furore resulted in (according to one BBC poll) 90% of respondents believing Hoddle should not continue as English coach. However, the BBC survey showed that while many considered his comments <b>insensitive</b> to the disabled, others defended his right to express his religious beliefs by claiming that to sack him would constitute religious discrimination.|$|E
5|$|The {{analysis}} of relative concentrations of samarium and neodymium isotopes 147Sm, 144Nd, and 143Nd allows {{the determination of}} the age and origin of rocks and meteorites in samarium–neodymium dating. Both elements are lanthanides and have very similar physical and chemical properties. Therefore, Sm–Nd dating is either <b>insensitive</b> to partitioning of the marker elements during various geological processes, or such partitioning can well be understood and modeled from the ionic radii of the involved elements.|$|E
5|$|The black dragonfish (also {{called the}} {{northern}} stoplight loosejaw) Malacosteus niger {{is believed to}} be one of the only fish to produce a red glow. Its eyes, however, are <b>insensitive</b> to this wavelength; it has an additional retinal pigment which fluoresces blue-green when illuminated. This alerts the fish to the presence of its prey. The additional pigment is thought to be assimilated from chlorophyll derivatives found in the copepods which form part of its diet.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, Tombalbaye banned {{opposition}} parties {{and established a}} one-party system. Tombalbaye's autocratic rule and <b>insensitive</b> mismanagement exacerbated inter-ethnic tensions. In 1965, Muslims in the north, led by the National Liberation Front of Chad (FROLINAT), began a civil war. Tombalbaye was overthrown and killed in 1975, but the insurgency continued. In 1979 the rebel factions led by Hissène Habré took the capital, and all central authority in the country collapsed. Armed factions, many from the north's rebellion, contended for power.|$|E
5|$|As a {{resident}} of Switzerland, Prince Sadruddin {{was concerned about the}} impact of <b>insensitive</b> tourist development and deforestation on the European Alps. At the World Economic Forum in 1990, he launched Alp Action to protect the mountain ecosystem and preserve the Alps' cultural diversity and vitality. The Bellerive Foundation program encouraged eco-tourism, aiming to reduce the impact of outdoor adventure sports on the fragile alpine habitat. During its years of operation, Alp Action successfully launched over 140 projects in seven countries. It found inspiration in the system of national parks of the Canadian Rockies.|$|E
5|$|Attachments between {{infants and}} {{caregivers}} form {{even if this}} caregiver is not sensitive and responsive in social interactions with them. This has important implications. Infants cannot exit unpredictable or <b>insensitive</b> caregiving relationships. Instead they must manage themselves {{as best they can}} within such relationships. Based on her established Strange Situation Protocol, research by developmental psychologist Mary Ainsworth in the 1960s and 1970s found that children will have different patterns of attachment depending primarily on how they experienced their early caregiving environment. Early patterns of attachment, in turn, shape — but do not determine — the individual's expectations in later relationships.|$|E
5|$|Coach's (Nicholas Colasanto) daughter, Lisa, (Allyce Beasley) {{arrives with}} her fiancé, Roy (Philip Charles MacKenzie), a {{door-to-door}} salesman who {{turns out to}} be abrasive and <b>insensitive.</b> Repulsed by Roy's obnoxious, boorish personality and insults toward people, including Lisa, Coach finds Roy not good enough for her. However, Coach is too reluctant to tell her about Roy because she appears to like him and wants her father's blessings. To make matters worse, at Melville's restaurant, Roy forces her to pay for dinner herself, which makes Coach angrier. Therefore, witnessing Roy's treatment on her, Coach's friends convince him to tell Lisa about Roy before it is too late.|$|E
5|$|However, {{when the}} German coordinators {{discovered}} how extensively the game dealt with Neo-Nazism, they informed LucasArts {{about the difficulty}} of marketing the game in their country. As Germany was an important overseas market for adventure games, LucasArts feared that the lower revenues would not recoup development costs, and subsequently canceled the game. The plot was later adapted into a four-part Dark Horse Comics series by Lee Marrs, published monthly from December 1994 to March 1995. In an interview, Barwood commented that the development team should have thought about the story more thoroughly beforehand, calling it <b>insensitive</b> and not regretting the cancellation of the title.|$|E
5|$|Individuals with AS {{often have}} {{excellent}} auditory and visual perception. Children with ASD often demonstrate enhanced perception of {{small changes in}} patterns such as arrangements of objects or well-known images; typically this is domain-specific and involves processing of fine-grained features. Conversely, compared with individuals with high-functioning autism, individuals with AS have deficits in some tasks involving visual-spatial perception, auditory perception, or visual memory. Many accounts of individuals with AS and ASD report other unusual sensory and perceptual skills and experiences. They may be unusually sensitive or <b>insensitive</b> to sound, light, and other stimuli; these sensory responses are found in other developmental disorders and are not specific to AS or to ASD. There is little support for increased fight-or-flight response or failure of habituation in autism; there is more evidence of decreased responsiveness to sensory stimuli, although several studies show no differences.|$|E
5|$|It {{became the}} largest film {{production}} ever in New York State. The decision to film in Williamsburg, Brooklyn near the Passover holiday caused some controversy, as critics {{believed that this}} was culturally <b>insensitive,</b> and would cause problems with parking. The filming company decided {{to work with the}} community and then agreed to adjust its production activities for Passover. The producers had assembled a 200-person crew for the 10-day shoot in Rochester, with a total number of 250 local crew members and 150 local extras. The prominent scenes were shot mostly on Main Street of Rochester and were digitally remastered to look like New York City.|$|E
5|$|Nanako is {{an extreme}} tomboy with an <b>insensitive</b> personality. Like Akira Uehara, she becomes popular with the {{students}} and Akira's parents after the exchange due to her personality and Akira's masculine appearance. Initially Nanako intended {{to return to her}} body after having fun as a male and was very strict on how Akira treated her body. She resolves to stay in Akira's body and relents her body's ownership to Akira after she falls completely in love with her friend, Makoto Shiina. Her parents learn about the exchange and are supportive of the statusquo as they accept Nanako's hopelessness as a female. She is voiced by Miyuki Sawashiro in the three radio dramas and is portrayed by Mai Takahashi in the live action film.|$|E
5|$|Neptunocene, Np(C8H8)2, was {{synthesized}} in 1970 by reacting neptunium(IV) chloride with K2(C8H8). It is isomorphous to uranocene and plutonocene, {{and they}} behave chemically identically: all three compounds are <b>insensitive</b> to water or dilute bases but {{are sensitive to}} air, reacting quickly to form oxides, and are only slightly soluble in benzene and toluene. Other known neptunium cyclooctatetraenyl derivatives include Np(RC8H7)2 (R = ethanol, butanol) and KNp(C8H8)·2THF, which is isostructural to the corresponding plutonium compound. In addition, neptunium hydrocarbyls have been prepared, and solvated triiodide complexes of neptunium are a precursor to many organoneptunium and inorganic neptunium compounds.|$|E
5|$|Northeast Pacific {{resident}} groups {{tend to be}} {{much more}} vocal than transient groups in the same waters. Residents feed primarily on Chinook and chum salmon, species that are <b>insensitive</b> to killer whale calls (inferred from the audio-gram of Atlantic salmon). In contrast, the marine mammal prey of transients hear well underwater at the frequencies used in killer whale calls. As such, transients are typically silent, probably to avoid alerting their mammalian prey. They sometimes use a single click (called a cryptic click) rather than the long train of clicks observed in other populations. Residents are only silent when resting.|$|E
5|$|Pete Gifford is Jenny's {{husband and}} has been Adam's best friend since {{childhood}}. Bullen based Pete on his own childhood friend, with whom he went through university. Pete is often deliberately <b>insensitive</b> towards Adam, which Thomson attributes to Pete thinking Adam is jealous of his achievements. In Series 2, Pete has an affair with co-worker Amy. It upsets his marriage to Jenny and by Series 3 they are separated. At the beginning of Series 4, they are back together and expecting a second child. After Jenny miscarries, she leaves Pete and takes little Adam with her. Pete has a rebound relationship with Jo, and marries her {{at the end of}} Series 4. They break {{up at the end of}} Series 5.|$|E
5|$|Shoe polish {{products}} are low-value {{items that are}} infrequently purchased, as a single can might last several months {{for even the most}} frequent user. Consumer demand is inelastic and largely <b>insensitive</b> to price change, while sales volumes are generally low. In the shoe polish market as a whole, some 26% of turnover is accounted for by pastes, 24% by creams, 23% by aerosols, and 13% by liquids. In recent years, the demand for shoe polish products has either been static or declined; one reason is the gradual replacement of formal footwear with sneakers for everyday use.|$|E
5|$|The Montreal Laboratory {{had been}} a {{fruitful}} and successful international venture, although the Canadians had on occasion been resentful of British actions that were perceived as high-handed and <b>insensitive.</b> One such action came in November 1945 when the British government suddenly announced that Cockcroft {{had been a}}ppointed {{the head of the}} new Atomic Energy Research Establishment in Britain without any prior consultation {{and at a time when}} the NRX reactor was still under construction. Cockcroft did not depart Canada until September 1946, but it was a sure sign of waning British interest in collaboration with Canada. The British suggested he be replaced by the British physicist Bennett Lewis, who was eventually appointed, but only after the Canadian-born Walter Zinn turned the job down.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{generated}} further {{controversy in}} September 2005, when Channel 4 in the United Kingdom decided to air the episode {{a week after}} Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans. Arguing that the episode was an <b>insensitive</b> choice, given recent events, several viewers filed complaints with Ofcom. Two days later, Channel 4 apologized on-air and directly contacted all those who had complained. Channel 4 had screened the episode for offensive content, but the reviews focused on the main content of the episode, and the song was not considered {{a key part of}} the plot. Channel 4 promised to update their review process to ensure that similar incidents would not occur. The New Orleans song was edited out of all future showings, and remains absent from all Channel 4 airings as of March 2017.|$|E
5|$|With <b>insensitive</b> or unresponsive caregivers, or {{frequent}} changes, {{an infant}} may have few experiences that encourage proximity seeking to a familiar person. An infant who experiences fear but who cannot find comforting information in an adult's face and voice may develop atypical ways {{of coping with}} fearfulness such as the maintenance of distance from adults, or the seeking of proximity to all adults. These symptoms accord with the DSM criteria for reactive attachment disorder. Either of these behavior patterns may create a developmental trajectory leading ever farther from typical attachment processes such as {{the development of an}} internal working model of social relationships that facilitates both the giving and the receiving of care from others.|$|E
5|$|Amatoxins {{consist of}} at least eight {{compounds}} with a similar structure, that of eight amino-acid rings; they were isolated in 1941 by Heinrich O. Wieland and Rudolf Hallermayer of the University of Munich. Of the amatoxins, α-amanitin is the chief component and along with β-amanitin is likely responsible for the toxic effects. Their major toxic mechanism is the inhibition of RNA polymerase II, a vital enzyme in the synthesis of messenger RNA (mRNA), microRNA, and small nuclear RNA (snRNA). Without mRNA, essential protein synthesis and hence cell metabolism grind {{to a halt and}} the cell dies. The liver is the principal organ affected, as it is the organ which is first encountered after absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, though other organs, especially the kidneys, are susceptible. The RNA polymerase of Amanita phalloides is <b>insensitive</b> to the effects of amatoxins, so the mushroom does not poison itself.|$|E
5|$|Buffer {{solutions}} {{also play}} a key role in analytical chemistry. They are used whenever there is a need to fix the pH of a solution at a particular value. Compared with an aqueous solution, the pH of a buffer solution is relatively <b>insensitive</b> to the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base. The buffer capacity of a simple buffer solution is largest when pH=pKa. In acid–base extraction, the efficiency of extraction of a compound into an organic phase, such as an ether, can be optimised by adjusting the pH of the aqueous phase using an appropriate buffer. At the optimum pH, the concentration of the electrically neutral species is maximised; such a species is more soluble in organic solvents having a low dielectric constant than it is in water. This technique is used for the purification of weak acids and bases.|$|E
5|$|Caroline's main rival for Mac's {{affections}} is Sue White (Michelle Gomez), the Scottish staff {{liaison officer}} employed {{to listen and}} respond to the problems of East Hampton's staff. However, Sue is perhaps the least suited person for the job; she is mean-spirited, <b>insensitive,</b> unsympathetic, controlling and vain. Her office is a place where the impossible tends to happen, and anyone who enters is normally treated with a mixture of verbal abuse and psychological torture, so she can get back to doing nothing, or thinking about how to upset the next visitor. The only person she treats with any affection is Mac, whom she loves to the point of madness, but Mac, like almost everyone else, tries his best to avoid her. Anyone who attempts to get involved with Mac is treated with contempt and hatred by Sue, in particular Caroline, whom Sue attempts several times to murder.|$|E
25|$|Human {{prolactin}} receptors are <b>insensitive</b> to mouse prolactin.|$|E
25|$|Berlusconi has {{developed}} a reputation for making gaffes or <b>insensitive</b> remarks.|$|E
25|$|Strain-beam accelerometers {{constructed}} as integrated circuits are too <b>insensitive</b> for geologic seismographs (2002), but {{are widely used}} in geophones.|$|E
25|$|Another {{friend of}} Alice. She also harasses Lain, {{but not as}} {{severely}} as Reika does. She is sometimes <b>insensitive</b> to other people's feelings.|$|E
25|$|In 1982 SAE {{members at}} the University of Cincinnati were {{suspended}} for a racially <b>insensitive</b> party corresponding with Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday.|$|E
25|$|In March 2015, The University of Oklahoma chapter was {{suspended}} due to allegations of racism, after {{a video of}} a member performing a racially <b>insensitive</b> chant surfaced.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to thrombelastography with its pendulum-like principle, {{the design of}} the TEM viscoelastic detection system (figure 1) makes it quite robust and <b>insensitive</b> against mechanical shocks or vibrations.|$|E
