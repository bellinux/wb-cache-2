It is therefore necessary to build computer systems that offer essential services even in the presence of a successful attack. Such systems are called intrusion <b>tolerant.</b> Intrusion <b>tolerant</b> <b>systems</b> differ from <b>fault</b> <b>tolerant</b> <b>systems</b> by their threat models. <b>Fault</b> <b>tolerant</b> <b>systems</b> are designed to survive spontaneous errors (due to natural physical processes), whereas intrusion <b>tolerant</b> <b>systems</b> should withstand attacks from skilled, well informed and resourceful adversaries who would launch multi-stage attacks on the system, where also the detection and recovery mechanisms are targeted.

40|$|In the thesis, a {{methodology}} alternative to existing methods of digital systems design with increased dependability implemented into FPGA is presented, new features {{which can be}} used in the implementation and testing of these systems are demonstrated. The research is based on the use of FPGA partial dynamic reconfiguration for the design of <b>fault</b> <b>tolerant</b> <b>systems.</b> In these applications, the partial dynamic reconfiguration {{can be used as a}} mechanism to correct the fault and recover the system after the fault occurrence. First, the general principles of diagnostics, testing and digital systems dependability are presented including a brief description of FPGA components and their architectures. Next, a survey of currently used methods and techniques used for the design and implementation of <b>fault</b> <b>tolerant</b> <b>systems</b> into FPGA is described, especially the methods used for fault detection and localization, their correction, together with the principles of evaluating <b>fault</b> <b>tolerant</b> <b>systems</b> design quality.   The most important part of the thesis is seen in the description of the design methodology, implementation and testing of <b>fault</b> <b>tolerant</b> <b>systems</b> implemented into FPGAs which uses SRAMs as the configuration memory. First, the methodology of developing and automated checker components design for digital systems and communication protocols is presented. Then, a reference architecture of a dependable system implemented into FPGA is demonstrated including several <b>fault</b> <b>tolerant</b> architectures based on the use of partial dynamic reconfiguration as the mechanism of fault correction and the recovery from it.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the reinitialization of <b>fault</b> <b>tolerant</b> <b>systems</b> in which detection and isolation (FDI) techniques are used, on-line, to identify and compensate for system failures. Specifically, it will focus on FDI techniques which utilize analytic redundancy, arising from a knowledge of the plant dynamics, by analyzing the residuals of a no-fail filter designed on the assumption of no failures. In these types of <b>fault</b> <b>tolerant</b> <b>systems,</b> system failures have to propagate through the no-fail filter dynamics in order to get detected. Therefore, the no-fail filter must be reinitialized after the isolation of a failure so that the accumulated effects of the failure are removed. In this paper, various approaches to this reinitialization problem will be discussed...|$|R

Basic reliability engineering covers all failures, including those that might not result in system failure, but do result in additional cost due to: maintenance repair actions; logistics; spare parts etc. For example, replacement or repair of 1 faulty channel in a 2oo3 voting system, (the system is still operating, although with one failed channel it has actually become a 2oo2 system) is contributing to basic unreliability but not mission unreliability. As an example, {{the failure of the}} tail-light of an aircraft will not prevent the plane from flying (and so is not considered a mission failure), but it does need to be remedied (with a related cost, and so does contribute to the basic unreliability levels).|$|E
