5|$|After a Ministry of Supply {{security}} officer {{working at the}} project is shot dead, M assigns Bond to replace him and also to investigate what has been <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>at</b> the missile-building base, located between Dover and Deal on the south coast of England. All the rocket scientists working on the project are German. At his post on the complex, Bond meets Gala Brand, a beautiful police Special Branch officer working undercover as Drax's personal assistant. Bond also uncovers clues concerning his predecessor's death, concluding that the man may have been killed for witnessing a submarine off the coast.|$|E
5|$|Other bands {{during that}} part of the '80's, both major and not-so-major acts, were really getting on the {{political}} bandwagon for one stupid reason or another. They were all so fucking serious, trying to be a voice for a generation or some shit like that, but worst of all they remained within the parameters of social acceptability. There was also a big censorship flap <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>at</b> the time. We looked at it as a chance to catch up with our obscenity quota.|$|E
5|$|With 35 shotgun pellets {{still in}} his body, {{including}} three in the lining of his heart and five more embedded in his liver, LeMond attempted to return to racing in 1988. His comeback was hampered by over-training which resulted in tendonitis in his right shin requiring surgery. He missed the Tour {{for the second year}} running. Tensions in the relationship between LeMond and PDM were aggravated when LeMond discovered that doping was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>at</b> the PDM squad. The result was that LeMond moved from PDM, one of the strongest teams in the peloton, to ADR, a team based in Belgium. The team was co-sponsored by Coors Light for American races. The deal was completed on New Year's Eve, just hours before LeMond would have been legally obligated to ride another season for the Dutch team. Joining the Belgian ADR squad allowed LeMond to continue to compete, but with teammates like Johan Museeuw who were better suited to riding Classics than Grand Tours.|$|E

25|$|The more {{permanent}} English settlers emigrated from the colony of Massachusetts Bay, {{most of them}} Puritans who were unhappy with the reforms <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>at</b> the time.

Rose called on a counter-attack with a search and clearance operation using Centurion tanks of the B Squadron, 5th Royal Inniskilling Dragoons; one tank was knocked out but the Black Watch started to clear the Hook of the Chinese and the fighting was still <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>at</b> dawn.|$|E

Employees are evacuated from unit 3, but no changes in radiation measurements or reactor status are seen. No work was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>at</b> the time (such as restoring power) which might have accounted for the fire. White smoke, probably steam, is also seen coming from unit 2 at 18:22 JST, accompanied by a temporary rise in radiation levels. A new power line is laid to unit 4 and unit 5 is transferred to its own external power from a transmission line instead of sharing the unit 6 diesel generators.|$|E

25|$|Eventually, {{due to a}} {{perceived}} need for Circassian ports and a view that an independent Circassia would impede their plans to extend into the Middle East (plans which were never achieved), Russia soon moved to annex Circassia. Tensions culminated in the devastating Russian-Circassian War, which in its later stages was eclipsed by the Crimean War. Despite {{the fact that a}} similar war was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>at</b> {{the other side of the}} Caucasus (Chechnya, Ingushetia, and Dagestan fighting against Russia to preserve their states' existence), as well as the attempts of some (ranging from Circassian princes to Imam Shamil to Britain) to connect the two struggles, connections between the Circassians and their allies with their Eastern Caucasian counterparts were quashed by an Ossetian alliance with Russia.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{weapons were}} {{imported}} from Japan and the United States in 1883. The first military factories were established and new military uniforms {{were created in}} 1884. Under joint patronage of Gojong & his Queen Consort, a request was made to the United States for more American military instructors {{to speed up the}} military modernization of Korea. Out of all the projects that were going on simultaneously, the military project took the longest. To manage these simultaneous projects was in itself was a major accomplishment for any nation. Not even Japan had modernized at the rate of Joseon, and not with as many projects <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>at</b> once, a precursor to modern Korea as one of East Asia's Tigers in rapid development into a first class nation during the 1960s–1980s.|$|E
25|$|Expanding his horizons he {{went into}} {{producing}} his own shows and often {{had more than one}} tour <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>at</b> the same time. He wanted to move on from his circus clowning and reinvented himself as a gentleman. He started to take up politics and would often have Democratic undertones in his shows. He was then regarded as not only a multi-talented performer, but a smart and noble man who was to be looked up to. He won the affection of many newspapers and publicists including that of a then unknown Mark Twain and Walt Whitman. Mark Twain paid him homage in his description of a circus in Huckleberry Finn, and it is likely a boyhood Twain actually saw Rice perform when his circus came to Hannibal for a show.|$|E

25|$|Discovered near Tranomaro in 1912 (though it can {{be found}} in {{crystalline}} schists from Fort Dauphin up to Ihosy), within 6 years 18 tons/yr of phlogopite mica was exported, with over 500 tons/yr by 1928. By 1947 there were 50 different companies mining mica, though the majority of the mining was done by just 10 of them. There were still 15 mines operating in 1962, with active exploration <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>at</b> 20 other sites. Mining companies included the Etablissements W. Boetschi, Les Fils de O. Jenny, the Societe des Minerals de la Grande Isle at Benato and the Union des Micas. However, in 1963 the US stopped purchasing mica, resulting in the closure of several mines and the production being cut by 2/3rds. The biggest mine was and still is at Ampandandrava, about 250km from Tolagnaro, which currently is being mined by Groupe Akesson, exporting 1,000 tons/yr.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, fashion had {{moved away from}} the unkempt hippie look and overdressed disco style of the late 1970s. Athletic clothes were more popular than jeans during this period, as were more subdued colors. Popular colors were black, white, indigo, forest green, burgundy, and {{different}} shades of browns, tans, and oranges. Velour, velvet, and polyester were popular fabrics used in clothes, especially button-up and v-neck shirts. Looser pants remained popular during this time, being fairly wide but straight, and tighter shirts were especially popular. The general public, at this time, wanted to wear low-maintenance clothing with more basic colors, as the global recession <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>at</b> the time kept extravagant clothes out of reach. Also worn were striped tube socks sometimes worn with the top folded over worn with shorts. It was not uncommon to see parents especially fathers wearing these along with their kids.|$|E
