40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} whether custom modification {{resulting in an}} anatomically shaped post and whether the span/diameter ratio (L/D) would affect the mechanical properties of fiber-reinforced composite posts. Methods: Preformed glass-fiber posts (Group 1) and modified glass-fiber posts (Group 2) and glass-fiber rods (<b>Groups</b> <b>3</b> and 4) (n = 20) were loaded to failure in a three-point bending test to determine the maximum load (N), flexural strength (MPa) and flexural modulus (GPa). The span distance tested <b>for</b> <b>Group</b> <b>3</b> was 10. 0 mm, while <b>for</b> <b>Group</b> 4 was 22. 0 mm. Data were subjected to different statistical analysis with significance levels of P < 0. 05. Results: The maximum load recorded <b>for</b> <b>Groups</b> 1 and 2 was 72. 5 ± 5. 9 N and 73. 4 ± 6. 4 N respectively, while <b>for</b> <b>Groups</b> <b>3</b> and 4 was 215. 3 ± 7 N and 156. 6 ± 3. 6 N respectively. The flexural strength <b>for</b> <b>Groups</b> 1 and 2 was 914. 6 ± 53. 1 MPa and 1069. 2 ± 115. 6 MPa, while <b>for</b> <b>Groups</b> <b>3</b> and 4 was 685. 4 ± 22. 2 MPa and 899. 6 ± 46. 1 MPa. The flexural modulus recorded <b>for</b> <b>Groups</b> 1 and 2 was 32. 6 ± 3. 2 GPa and 33. 4 ± 2. 2 GPa respectively, while <b>for</b> <b>Groups</b> <b>3</b> and 4 was 13. 7 ± 0. 3 GPa and 34. 4 ± 0. 3 GPa respectively. Conclusions: The flexural properties of an anatomically custom modified fiber post were not affected by the modification procedure and the span-diameter ratio is an important parameter for the interpretation of flexural strength and flexural modulus values. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Sweet potato, Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam., is an {{important}} food crop that is cultivated worldwide. However, no genome-wide assessment of the genetic diversity of sweet potato {{has been reported to}} date. In the present study, the population structure and genetic diversity of 197 sweet potato accessions most of which were from China were assessed using 62, 363 SNPs. A model-based structure analysis divided the accessions into three groups: group 1, group 2 and <b>group</b> <b>3.</b> The genetic relationships among the accessions were evaluated using a phylogenetic tree, which clustered all the accessions into three major groups. A principal component analysis (PCA) showed that the accessions were distributed according to their population structure. The mean genetic distance among accessions ranged from 0. 290 <b>for</b> <b>group</b> 1 to 0. 311 <b>for</b> <b>group</b> <b>3,</b> and the mean polymorphic information content (PIC) ranged from 0. 232 <b>for</b> <b>group</b> 1 to 0. 251 <b>for</b> <b>group</b> <b>3.</b> The mean minor allele frequency (MAF) ranged from 0. 207 <b>for</b> <b>group</b> 1 to 0. 222 <b>for</b> <b>group</b> <b>3.</b> Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed that the maximum diversity was within accessions (89. 569 %).

40|$|ObjectiveAmong {{individuals}} with peripheral artery disease (PAD), we compared annual change in 6 -minute walk performance between participants who neither underwent lower extremity revascularization nor walked <b>for</b> exercise (<b>group</b> 1, reference), those who walked regularly <b>for</b> exercise (<b>group</b> 2), {{and those who}} underwent lower extremity revascularization (<b>group</b> <b>3).</b> MethodsParticipants were recruited from Chicago-area vascular laboratories and followed annually. Change in 6 -minute walk was calculated beginning at the study visit preceding lower extremity revascularization or exercise behavior and continuing for 1 additional year after the therapy was reported. Results are adjusted for age, sex, race, comorbidities, and other confounders. ResultsOf 348 PAD participants, 43 underwent revascularization during median follow-up of 84 months. Adjusted annual declines in 6 -minute walk were − 96. 6 feet/year <b>for</b> <b>group</b> 1, − 49. 9 feet/year <b>for</b> <b>group</b> 2, and − 32. 6 feet/year <b>for</b> <b>group</b> <b>3</b> (P <. 001). Forty-one percent of revascularizations were not associated with ankle-brachial index (ABI) improvement. When <b>group</b> <b>3</b> was limited to participants with ABI improvement ≥ 0. 15 after revascularization, annual adjusted changes in 6 -minute walk were − 97. 7 feet/year <b>for</b> <b>group</b> 1, − 46. 5 feet/year <b>for</b> <b>group</b> 2, and + 68. 1 feet/year <b>for</b> <b>group</b> <b>3</b> (P <. 001). When <b>group</b> <b>3</b> was limited to participants without ABI improvement ≥ 0. 15 after revascularization, annual adjusted changes in 6 -minute walk were − 99. 2 feet/year <b>for</b> <b>group</b> 1, − 48. 0 feet/year <b>for</b> <b>group</b> 2, and − 61. 7 feet/year <b>for</b> <b>group</b> <b>3</b> (P <. 001). ConclusionsA large proportion of PAD participants did not have ABI improvement of at least 0. 15 at follow-up study visit after revascularization. The benefits of lower extremity revascularization in patients with PAD appear closely tied to improvements in the ABI after revascularization...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study is to test the {{hypothesis}} that a subset of conjunctival melanocytic proliferations exists that cannot be reproducibly classified as benign, malignant, or indeterminate. METHODS: Three groups of excisional biopsy specimens of conjunctival melanocytic proliferations were evaluated by 5 ophthalmic pathologists. These groups included lesions that were considered by the authors to represent benign (Group 1, n = 5), malignant (Group 2, n = 5) and indeterminate melanocytic proliferations (<b>Group</b> <b>3,</b> n = 5). The panel classified the same sections in all <b>3</b> <b>groups</b> in a randomized, masked fashion, first without and then with a clinical history of patient age, sex and race. The kappa statistic (k) was used to quantify the degree of agreement among observers. RESULTS: There was strong concordance among the panel <b>for</b> both <b>Group</b> 1 (benign, k = 0. 76) and Group 2 (malignant, k = 0. 70) melanocytic proliferations.

The overall aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} in vitro development ability of oocytes recovered from 56 Holstein Frisian heifers with low [group 1 (G 1) : 16 mg /dl] plasma urea nitrogen (PUN) concentrations, to determine whether PUN concentrations affect the competence of oocytes to progress to blastocysts after in vitro fertilization. In vitro oocyte and embryo development was assessed by blastocyst rates, embryo total cell numbers and apoptosis. Blood samples for the determination of PUN were collected 24 h prior to collection of the ovaries at the slaughter. A total of 112 ovaries were collected at a local abattoir and oocytes (n = 697) were aspirated, in vitro matured and fertilized. On day 8, blastocysts were assigned to the terminal dUTP nick end labelling assay. Cleavage rates were significantly higher (p < 0. 001) <b>for</b> <b>groups</b> 1 and 2 than <b>for</b> <b>group</b> <b>3</b> (i. e. 72. 5 % and 72. 2 % vs 61. 7 %, respectively). The proportion of fertilized oocytes that developed into blastocysts was higher (p < 0. 05) <b>for</b> <b>group</b> 1 than <b>for</b> <b>group</b> <b>3</b> (34. 0 % vs 23. 0 %, respectively). Day 8 blastocysts showed higher total cell counts (p < 0. 05) <b>for</b> <b>group</b> 1 than <b>for</b> <b>group</b> <b>3</b> (123. 7 vs 76. 3), and a higher (p < 0. 05) total apoptotic cell rate was found in <b>group</b> <b>3</b> (25. 9 and 19. 0 vs 43. 2 for G 1, G 2 and G 3, respectively). In conclusion, the ability of oocytes from heifers with increased levels of PUN to develop to the blastocyst stage was significantly reduced when standard routines for in vitro maturation, fertilization and culture were followed. These detrimental effects can be mediated in part through direct effect of urea and/or by the metabolic products on the process of follicle-enclosed oocyte nuclear and cytoplasmic development...|$|R
