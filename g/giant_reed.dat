5|$|With the {{introduction}} of non-native species, predominantly <b>giant</b> <b>reed,</b> castor bean and tobacco tree, native plant species in the watershed began to die out. As <b>giant</b> <b>reed</b> is not suitable habitat for many species, areas infested by <b>giant</b> <b>reed</b> are biologically dead in comparison with unaffected areas. It can grow extremely fast, removing too much water from the creek, and during flood events, {{many parts of the}} <b>giant</b> <b>reed</b> can wash downstream and re-establish themselves as a new colony, increasing the problem. Along with increasing concentrations of nutrients from fertilizer and other substances contained in runoff, algal blooms began to hurt the water quality of the creek, especially above Sulphur Creek Reservoir. The historically seasonal creek was replaced with a constant flow of polluted water from several large storm drains and many smaller ones.|$|E
5|$|Since {{urbanization}} {{began in}} the 1960s, sudden high and sediment-lacking flows of polluted water began to destroy the native riparian vegetation once found along much of the creek. Exotic plants, including tobacco tree, castor bean, pampas grass, periwinkle, and Artichoke thistle, but most notably the <b>giant</b> <b>reed,</b> then replaced the historic live oaks, sycamores and alders as riparian vegetation. These plants have crowded out native vegetation, {{and in the case}} of <b>giant</b> <b>reed,</b> crowded out native animals—giant reed does not provide habitat for any native Southern California animals. These invasive species are most prevalent along upper Sulphur Creek (Sulphur Creek Reservoir prevents these plants from spreading downstream), much of the Aliso Creek mainstem, and some parts of Wood Canyon Creek.|$|E
5|$|There are sixteen {{prominent}} vegetation {{zones in}} the San Juan watershed, which include riparian vegetation, montane woodlands, coastal sage scrub and chaparral. Riparian vegetation is found {{along the banks}} of free-flowing streams with a measurable flow for at least several months out of the year. These include most of San Juan Creek, upper Trabuco Creek, Cañada Gobernadora, Bell Canyon, and other headwater streams, as well as scattered patches along Oso and El Horno creeks. Forests are present at high elevations, and also occur in close proximity to waterways. Coastal sage scrub is found on south-facing hillsides, while chaparral is found on higher-elevation hillsides and mesas. There are also a number of rare plant communities along rock outcroppings and vernal pools. However, introduced plant species, such as <b>giant</b> <b>reed,</b> castor bean, and tobacco tree, are rapidly spreading along streams. <b>Giant</b> <b>reed</b> has taken over huge areas of wetlands, swamps and riparian zones along the creek and its tributaries, although in recent years the county has taken steps toward eradicating it from San Juan Creek and other nearby streams.|$|E
5000|$|Out of the 110 {{acres of}} the West Wetlands Park, {{approximately}} 30 percent is restored riparian habitat, known as the [...] "Lower Bench". Prior to restoring the lower bench the area was deteriorated and overrun with trash and opportunist vegetation, in particular salt cedar and <b>giant</b> <b>reeds.</b>|$|R

When the humidity starts to diminish in barren {{areas of the}} Ebro valley, the Levante and the southern half of the peninsula, the dryness is often accompanied by an increase of salts in the ground; under such conditions one can find formations of tamarisk shrubs, oleanders and <b>giant</b> <b>reeds</b> (Saccharum ravenae), sometimes accompanied by heather. In soils rich in silica but not in salts, {{such as those of}} the Sierra Morena and the Montes de Toledo, spurge appears, accompanied, in the warmest places, by oleanders and tamarisks.|$|R
500|$|Invasive species—those {{that are}} not native to the region—have caused {{problems}} in the watershed for many years. One of the most troublesome invasive species is the <b>giant</b> <b>reed,</b> which plagues many coastal Southern California waterways. The <b>giant</b> <b>reed</b> {{is similar to a}} tall grass or thin bamboo, but grows quickly and can take over native stands of vegetation, block the streambed, hurts the habitat of native animals, and increases the hazard of wildfires. Perhaps the largest effect that <b>giant</b> <b>reed</b> has is its usage of water. To support its fast growth rate, the <b>giant</b> <b>reed</b> population in the Santa Ana River watershed can consume [...] of water per year.|$|E
500|$|Other {{invasive}} species also {{have affected the}} Santa Ana River. One {{of the most prominent}} is the brown-headed cowbird, which feeds off parasites and insects identified with cattle, which were brought to Southern California during the Spanish Rancho period. The brown-headed cowbird is a [...] "brood parasite", or a bird that lays its eggs in another bird's nest. One of the most afflicted birds is the least Bell's vireo, whose population also suffers from the loss of riparian habitat. The least Bell's vireo is considered an endangered species, as is the southwestern willow flycatcher, whose habitat is often shared with the other bird. The saltcedar is another invasive large weed that also, like the <b>giant</b> <b>reed,</b> uses large amounts of water. Unlike <b>giant</b> <b>reed,</b> the saltcedar has deeper roots, not only making it more difficult to remove but allowing it to access and use up deep groundwater. However, the saltcedar is similar in that it also provides little usable habitat for native animals.|$|E

5000|$|The corsets of the 16th through 18th centuries (called [...] "stays", [...] "bodies" [...] or [...] "corps") were {{intended}} to mold the upper torso into a rigid cone like shape. The earliest corsets had a wooden busk placed down the center fronts of the corsets. (These early busks were different from the newer, steel busks which have clasps to open and close.) Corsets of the 17th and 18th centuries were most often heavily boned {{with little or no}} space between the bone channels. This was necessary to force the body to conform to the desired shape of the era. At the time, the most popular materials used for the boning were <b>Giant</b> <b>reeds</b> or whalebone.|$|R

But to Leonard's fancy all these various voices of nature were as one voice that spoke from the piles of skeletons gleaming faintly in the uncertain starlight and cried, [...] "Oh!

50|$|<b>Giant</b> <b>reed</b> (Arundo donax), {{also known}} as wild cane is an {{invasive}} species that has greatly compromised the lower Colorado River riparian. The United States Department of Agriculture describes it as a perennial grass that grows from nine to thirty feet in height. Successful establishment of <b>giant</b> <b>reed</b> within a riparian area results in a decline of the native plant species. It does not provide shelter or food for the native wildlife species, so large areas invaded by <b>giant</b> <b>reed</b> {{have little or no}} wildlife living amongst it. It dominates the river bank and does not provide the necessary shading for river edge habitats, resulting in warmer water and a lower diversity of aquatic animals. The <b>giant</b> <b>reed</b> along with the salt cedar, have greatly devastated and degraded the lower Colorado River riparian.|$|E

50|$|In {{most areas}} where <b>giant</b> <b>reed</b> grows (Mediterranean area and US), viable seeds are not produced. On the other hand, {{sterility}} is an obstacle for breeding programs which aim {{to increase the}} productivity and biomass quality for energy conversion. Asexual reproduction drastically reduces genetic variability. It is reported that sterility of <b>giant</b> <b>reed</b> is {{as a result of}} a failure of the megaspore mother cell to divide.A total of 185 clones of A. donax were collected from California to South Carolina and genetically fingerprinted with the SRAP and TE-based markers. <b>Giant</b> <b>reed</b> exhibited no molecular genetic variation despite the wide genomic coverage of the markers used in this study. The molecular data strongly point to a single genetic clone of A. donax in the United States, although multiple introductions of this plant into the United States have been documented. Another study was conducted in the Mediterranean area on sampling <b>giant</b> <b>reed</b> from 80 different sites, and a low gene diversity was detected. Results indicate the occurrence of post-meiotic alterations in the ovule and pollen developmental pathway. AFLP data support a monophyletic origin of <b>giant</b> <b>reed</b> and suggest that it originated in Asia and began to spread into the Mediterranean Basin.|$|E

30|$|However, the {{production}} of commercially available activated carbon that is widely used for adsorptive purposes entails high manufacturing costs (Ajmal et al. 2005; Ahmad and Hameed 2009; Mahvi 2009; Pajooheshfar and Saeedi 2009; Demiral and Gündüzog 2010). The precursor materials such as coal, wood and coconut shells that are widely used for {{the production}} of activated carbon are expensive and often need to be imported (Baccar et al. 2009). As a result, several studies have been undertaken that investigated the potential of using agricultural and household wastes such as olive stones (Shalaby et al. 2006; Ubago-Pérez et al. 2006; Kula et al. 2008), spent grains (Li et al. 2010), rice husks (Khan et al. 2010), almond shells (Plaza et al. 2010), herb residues (Yang and Qiu 2011), cotton stalks (Deng et al. 2009), bamboo (Ahmad and Hameed 2009), macadamia nutshells (Ahmadpour and Do 1997), durian shells (Chandra et al. 2009), <b>giant</b> <b>reeds</b> (Yue et al. 2010) and coffee husks (Oliveira et al. 2009) as AC precursors for the treatment of wastewater. Furthermore in recent times, the usage of dead biomass such as fertilizer husk (Srivastava et al. 1997), rice husks (Srinivasan et al. 1988), mustard oil cake (Ajmal et al. 2005), green algae (Nuhoglu et al. 2002; Malkoç and Nuhoglu 2003), pine bark and almond shell (Rossner and Snyder 2009) for the removal of pollutants from wastewater has shown increasing promise. One particular area of interest revolved around the usage of waste tea leaves for the adsorptive purposes due to the comparatively easier availability. Tea is obtained from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis L Camellia assamica and Cambodiensis plants (Kazmi et al. 2013). Although there exists a wide variety of tea in the commercial realm, those derived from the leaves of the plants mentioned above can be divided into six main categories: black, oolong, green, white, pure and dark. The differences among the varieties arise from the variations in the withering and oxidation processes.|$|R

40|$|A {{computational}} {{model of the}} flow inside a saxophone mouthpiece is built using finite element analysis coupled with computation fluid dynamics to mimic {{the behavior of the}} reed in playing conditions. Most of the previous work focuses on mathematical models of steady flows or experimental models using various imaging strategies or speed and pressure gauging methods. However, these methods use the quasi-stationary approximation and fail to realize the complex interactions between the air and the structure during the dynamic flows. In this work, an effort has been made to reproduce a realistic model of a saxophone mouthpiece and a vibrating reed to study the velocity and the pressure contours inside the saxophone, and the frequency response of the reed. ^ An Arundo Donax (<b>giant</b> cane) <b>reed</b> is used for these simulations.

Around the world, several regions are subjected to a decline of fertility due to an increasing degradation of soils, loss of organic matter and increasing desertification. Recently research was carried out to evaluate, in the same pedological and climatic conditions, the impact of three long-term (14 years) agricultural systems, continuous <b>giant</b> <b>reed,</b> natural grassland, and cropping sequence, on the organic-matter characteristics and microbial biomass size in soil. The study pointed out that a long term <b>Giant</b> <b>reed</b> cropping system, characterized by low tillage intensity, positively affect the amount and quality of soil organic matter. Arundo donax showed greater values than tilled management system for total soil organic carbon, light fraction carbon, dissolved organic carbon, and microbial biomass carbon.

50|$|<b>Giant</b> <b>reed</b> {{is adapted}} {{to a wide variety}} of {{ecological}} conditions, but is generally associated with riparian and wetland systems. It is distributed across the southern United States from Maryland to California. Plants can grow in a variety of soils, from heavy clays to loose sands and gravelly soils, but prefer wet drained soils, where they produce monotypic dense stands. In soil contaminated with arsenic, cadmium and lead, <b>giant</b> <b>reed</b> was found to grow rapidly, showing a strong metal-tolerance, with a limited metal translocation from roots to shoots. In this study, it is underlined that accumulation of As, Cd and Pb in shoots of <b>giant</b> <b>reed</b> is low, while metal concentration in roots is high, and the anatomical characteristics of stem tissues are thick and homogeneous according to SEM image. In Pakistan, where the detection of arsenic in ground waters has threatened the use of groundwater as major source of drinking water, a research highlighted the phytoremediation potential of A. donax when grown in hydroponics cultures containing arsenic concentrations up to 1000 µg l−1. <b>Giant</b> <b>reed</b> was able to translocate the metals absorbed into the shoot and to accumulate metals in the stalk and leaves above the root concentration without showing any toxic effects up to As concentration of 600 µg l−1. Furthermore, the plant is not consumed by herbivores, a positive trait in phytoremediation plants.|$|E
