40|$|Adversaries with {{physical}} {{access to a}} target platform can perform cold boot or DMA attacks to extract sensitive data from the RAM. In response, several main-memory encryption schemes have been proposed to prevent such attacks. Also hardware vendors have acknowledged the threat and already announced respective hardware extensions. Intel's SGX and AMD's SME will provide means to encrypt parts of the RAM to protect security-relevant assets that reside there. Encrypting the RAM will protect the user's content against passive eavesdropping. However, the level of protection it provides in scenarios that involve an adversary who is not only able to read from RAM but can also change content in RAM is less clear. Obviously, encryption offers some protection against such an "active" adversary: from the ciphertext the adversary cannot see what value is changed in the plaintext, nor predict the system behaviour based on the changes. But is this enough to prevent an active adversary from performing malicious tasks? This paper addresses the open research question whether encryption alone is a <b>dependable</b> <b>protection</b> mechanism in practice when considering an active adversary. To this end, we first build a software based memory encryption solution on a desktop system which mimics AMD's SME. Subsequently, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept fault attack on this system, by which {{we are able to}} extract the private RSA key of a GnuPG user. Our work suggests that transparent memory encryption is not enough to prevent active attacks...|$|E

30|$|A Dynamic State Estimation (DSE) based {{algorithm}} [16 – 18] {{is proposed}} {{in this paper}} to solve the above protection and control problems. The algorithm estimates {{the states of the}} components of interest using available sampled measurements and a high-fidelity dynamic model, so that the electrical transients can be accurately captured. This feature of the DSE algorithm enables more <b>dependable</b> and secure <b>protection</b> and control of μGrid components. Specifically, for protection application, the estimated states are utilized to check consistency between the measurements and the model, and a trip signal is issued if any inconsistency is detected. For control application, the estimated states are utilized to first calculate the remote side frequency information and then this information is adopted to provide a supplementary feedback control to the CIG controller.|$|R
30|$|A <b>dependable</b> DC line <b>protection</b> scheme {{should be}} capable of {{detecting}} a fault at any point on the protected line regardless of the fault resistance. The faults must be detected and discriminated very quickly because if the fault current rises above the maximum breaker current, fault current cannot be interrupted subsequently. Furthermore, a secure protection scheme should not unnecessarily trip a circuit breaker. The setting of the ROCOV based DC line protection scheme in [9] is a compromise between these two aspects. When the threshold value of peak dv/dt is set higher, the operation is more secure, but fails to detect high resistance faults, especially when they are far from the relay. In the following sections, it is shown through simulations of the test MT-HVDC grid in Fig.  1 that a purely ROCOV based DC line protection strategy can fail for certain line faults.|$|R
30|$|Converter Interfaced Generations (CIGs) bring {{significant}} {{challenges in}} μGrid protection and CIG control. This paper proposes a Dynamic State Estimation (DSE) based algorithm using high-fidelity dynamic models and sampled value measurements for <b>dependable</b> and secure <b>protection</b> {{and control of}} μGrid systems. For the protection application, the DSE based protection algorithm detects internal faults by checking any inconsistency between the measurements and the model. The advantages of the proposed protection scheme include: (a) detection of internal faults faster than legacy schemes; (b) improved sensitivity towards high impedance faults; (c) satisfactory performance in μGrid protection in both grid-connected mode and islanded mode; and (d) working correctly during non-ideal conditions such as measurements with added 1 % random error. For CIG control application, the DSE provides accurate estimation of the remote side frequency {{as well as the}} rate of frequency change from local information only, which can then be used to provide supplementary feedback control to the converters of the CIG. The advantages of the proposed control scheme include: (a) no need for communication from remote sides; (b) accurate estimation of the remote side frequency and rate of frequency change based on local information; and (c) minimizing the CIG output oscillation during system disturbances.|$|R
40|$|The X- 33 Advantage Technology Demonstrator {{offers a}} rare and {{exciting}} opportunity in Thermal Protection System development. The experimental program incorporates the latest design innovation in re-useable, low life cycle cost, and highly <b>dependable</b> Thermal <b>Protection</b> materials and constructions into both ground based and flight test vehicle validations. The unique attributes of the X- 33 demonstrator for design application validation for the full scale Reusable Launch Vehicle, (RLV), are represented by both {{the configuration of the}} stand-off aeroshell, and the extreme exposures of sub-orbital hypersonic re-entry simulation. There are several challenges of producing a sub-orbital prototype demonstrator of Single Stage to Orbit/Reusable Launch Vehicle (SSTO/RLV) operations. An aggressive schedule with budgetary constraints precludes the opportunity for an extensive verification and qualification program of vehicle flight hardware. However, taking advantage of off the shelf components with proven technologies reduces some of the requirements for additional testing. The effects of scale on thermal heating rates must also be taken into account during trajectory design and analysis. Described in this document are the unique Thermal Protection System (TPS) design opportunities that are available with the lifting body configuration of the X- 33. The two principal objectives for the TPS are to shield the primary airframe structure from excessive thermal loads and to provide an aerodynamic mold line surface. With the relatively benign aeroheating capability of the lifting body, an integrated stand-off aeroshell design with minimal weight and reduced procurement and operational costs is allowed. This paper summarizes the design objectives of the X- 33 TPS, the flight test requirements driven configuration, and design benefits. Comparisons are made of the X- 33 flight profiles and Space Shuttle Orbiter, and lifting body Reusable Launch Vehicle aerothermal environments. The X- 33 TPS is based on a design to cost configuration concept. Only RLV critical technologies are verified to conform to cost and schedule restrictions. The one-off prototype vehicle configuration has evolved to minimize the tooling costs by reducing the number of unique components. Low cost approaches such as a composite/blanket leeward aeroshell and the use of Shuttle technology are implemented where applicable. The success of the X- 33 will overcome the ballistic re-entry TPS mindset. The X- 33 TPS is tailored to an aircraft type mission while maintaining sufficient operational margins. The flight test program for the X- 33 will demonstrate that TPS for the RLV is not simply a surface insulation but rather an integrated aeroshell system...|$|R
40|$|Substation cyber {{assets are}} mission {{critical}} for {{protection and control}} of substations. Managing and ensuring their secure operation is of paramount importance. A known vulnerability is hidden failures which are responsible for about 10 % of mis-operations and their detrimental effects on system reliability. The paper presents an integrated centralized substation protection approach {{that is based on}} the recently developed setting-less relays which are integrated into a centralized substation protection scheme with the following features: (a) fast, <b>dependable</b> and secure <b>protection</b> of each substation protection zone by a settingless relay, (b) supervision of each settingless relay by validating relay input data by a substation wide state estimator, (c) self-healing against hidden failures by detecting and identifying compromised data and replacing them with estimated values, thus ensuring that the settingless relays will always operate on validated data. The paper provides a summary review of the settingless protective relay and introduces the Integrated Centralized Substation Protection Scheme (ICSP) which uses the data from all settingless relays in the substation to perform a substation wide state estimation. The state estimator uses a hypothesis testing algorithm to determine whether (a) data are valid with no faults or hidden failures, (b) data are valid and a fault exists in the system, or (c) some data are invalid due to hidden failures. In the last case, the state estimator uses the substation state and model to replace the compromised data with estimated values and thus enabling self-immunization against hidden failures. A byproduct of the method is the substation state estimate which is transmitted to the control center where it is used with the state from all substations to synthesize the system wide state estimate and model. Architectural issues are addressed as well as migration issues of existing systems into the proposed ICSP...|$|R
40|$|Unsound Minds {{is a short}} {{novel about}} a young girl, Clara, who has {{suffered}} emotional trauma. She arrived in Hindpark Township from a place that she never discloses. She {{has been living in}} the loft of a block of flats for a while, isolated from the community, only corning out at night to scrounge for food in the rubbish bins belonging to a restaurant situated opposite the flats. The community believes her to be mentally disturbed and {{want nothing to do with}} her. One night, while looking through her window, she witnesses the murder of the restaurateur, Samson. A young police officer, Wanda, is assigned the duty of protecting her from the murderers before they find out that she is a witness. He places her under the care of Matrida, a formidable spinster, who lives a short distance away from the scene of the crime. It is, however, this precautionary act that actually exposes Clara to the killers as a witness. As part of the novel's tapestry, the story explores the workings of the township's corrupt and incompetent police force which is headed by an authoritarian bully, Inspector Bedson. Hindpark's social dynamics, beliefs and superstitions, and sense of community, despite some conflict between residents, play an integral role in creating the sort of environment that Clara finds herself in. Wanda, the only policeman with any notable integrity, starts off as her reluctant protector; Matrida assumes the role of a reluctant mother figure; Anabel is the obnoxious neighbour; and limbo is the neighbourhood's aggressive hell-raiser. Like Clara, they have each experienced some form of trauma in their lives. They become a more <b>dependable</b> unit of <b>protection</b> to Clara than the entire Hindpark police force. Without being scientific or philosophical, Unsound Minds looks at the question of sanity. It is a story about how no one human being is exempt from some form of madness and how that madness drives each individual differently. The supposedly insane Clara is placed in the care of Matrida whom the community believes is herself not completely sane. But even in her madness, she is instrumental in bringing back some stability into Clara's life. At the other extreme, Bedson's madness is destructive. Because of his inept leadership skills, he drives the entire police force into disrepute. Given this human dynamic. the story seeks to reveal how everyone uses their madness in the way that suits them best - for good or for bad. The theme of madness was not planned at the time of beginning this short novel, but developed as the narrative progressed. However, just as writing is subjective, so is reading. I expect each reader to read into Unsound Minds what s/he sees in it. The story is entirely my own, influenced partly by my perceptions of the different environments that I have lived in throughout my life, although it is purely imaginative. Pointers which I received from my supervisor, Professor Geoffrey Haresnape, helped in moulding it into a narrative that will hopefully be a worthwhile read...|$|R
