40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether the technique of fractional moving blood volume (FMBV) is applicable to Virtual Organ Computer-aided AnaLysis II (VOCAL II™) -based indices to quantify three-dimensional power Doppler ultrasound (3 D-PDU) by investigating the effect of <b>gain</b> <b>level</b> on the indices measured at a possible reference point for standardization. METHODS: Ten women with singleton pregnancy between 33 + 3 and 37 + 5 weeks' gestation were recruited. The optimal position for 3 D acquisition of cord insertion into the placenta was identified and static 3 D-PDU volumes were acquired using consistent machine configurations. Without moving the probe or the participant changing position, successive 3 D volumes were stored at - 3, - 5, - 7 and - 9 [*]dB and at the individualized sub-noise <b>gain</b> (SNG) <b>level.</b> Volumes were excluded if flash artifact was present, in which case all five volumes were reacquired. Using 4 D View software, the cord insertion was magnified and the smallest sphere possible {{was used to measure}} vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI) and vascularization flow index (VFI). The associations between VOCAL indices and <b>gain</b> <b>level</b> were assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficient. RESULTS: VOCAL indices for cord insertion correlated poorly with <b>gain</b> <b>level,</b> whether fundamental or relative to SNG level (R(2) = 0. 07 and 0. 04, respectively). VI was consistently 100 % and mean FI and VFI were 99. 5 (SD, 0. 57), with all values > 97 irrespective of <b>gain</b> <b>level.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Whilst previous work has shown that gain correlates well with placental tissue VOCAL indices, the correlation between <b>gain</b> <b>level</b> and VOCAL indices in an area of 100 % vascularity at the cord insertion is poor. Regions of 100 % vascularity appear to be artificially assigned a value approaching 100 % for all VOCAL indices irrespective of <b>gain</b> <b>level.</b> This precludes using the technique of VOCAL indices from large vessels to standardize power Doppler measurements and the FMBV index is therefore not applicable to image analysis using VOCAL...|$|R
50|$|In the {{beginning}} of a game, player's fighter is AXION 001. A fighter can <b>gain</b> <b>levels</b> by buzzing of destroying enemy units or buzzing. Once the fighter <b>gains</b> sufficient <b>level,</b> it changes form and its firing patterns are altered. Fighter's level is maintained between stages, lives, and credits.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{importance}} of heterogeneous <b>gain</b> <b>levels</b> in generating realistic time series mimicking well known time series features. The methodology takes a very strong stand on learning and evolution. Most forecasting rules involve dynamically adaptive parameters adjusted using a standard recursive least squares framework. Also, agents forecast both expected returns and risk as inputs to their portfolio choices. A population of agents using multiple <b>gain</b> <b>levels</b> in their learning are converged to a single “representative gain ” for a small set of heterogeneous forecast strategies. Simulation results show that this dramatically alters the time series outcomes away from the realistic features generated in the heterogeneous gain model. It is therefore an early suggestion that in this class of models heterogeneity in <b>gain</b> <b>levels</b> is necessary for realistic time series replication...|$|R

In addition to leveling up, Aya's stats can be customized using Over Energy (OE) clips found during missions or acquired during Overdive attacks. Using a 3x3 grid accessed in the hub area, certain OE clips grand different stat boosts and abilities. Creating a new grid automatically deletes {{the effects of the}} original.|$|R

25|$|Unlike {{the games}} in SSI's Gold Box series, {{character}} generation is greatly simplified. The player chooses a name, by which they are known throughout the game. There is no race, class or skill selection, and play begins immediately. The single-player character begins the game as a second-level corsair, whose statistics are predetermined; the player cannot upgrade the character's weapons and armor. The character earns experience points by solving puzzles and finishing quests, some of which do not involve combat. The character <b>gains</b> <b>levels</b> in exchange for experience points; <b>gaining</b> <b>levels</b> increases hit points, and grants {{the opportunity to learn}} new skills for combat.|$|R
50|$|A unit can <b>gain</b> <b>levels</b> in {{the game}} through killing enemy units and so gather {{experience}} points. By <b>gaining</b> a <b>level</b> a unit becomes stronger.

The Empire and The Beast units level individually and The Fallen as collective by gathering experience points in their Soul Trap.|$|R

It performance at a wide frequency band (DC- 80 KHz), dynamic range up to 120 dB, and precision pulse width discrimination has made possible to build fast hopping PFLL based coherent timemultiplex PM-PM system with only few tenths of a degree of radians spacing between channels.
