25|$|Unemployment in Poland {{appeared}} in the 19th century, {{during the process of}} industrialization, and was particularly severe during the Great Depression. During communist rule officially Poland had close to full employment although <b>hidden</b> <b>unemployment</b> existed. After Poland's transition to a market economy the unemployment rate sharply increased, peaking at above 16% in 1993, then dropped afterwards, but remained well above pre-1993 levels. Another period of high unemployment occurred in the early 2000s when the rate reached 20%. As Poland entered European Union (EU) in 2004 and its job market, mass emigration due to unemployment took place lowering the figure. Since then the rate had fallen until the onset of the 2008 Great Recession. Recent years have seen an increase in the unemployment rate from below 8% to above 10% (Eurostat) or from below 10% to 13% (GUS). The rate began dropping again in late 2013. Polish government (GUS) reported 9.6% registered unemployment in November 2015, while European Union's Eurostat gave 7.2%. According to Eurostat data, since 2008, unemployment in Poland has been constantly below the EU average. Significant regional differences in the unemployment rate exist across Poland.|$|E

50|$|Since 1947, {{and with}} reforms in 1975, cash {{benefits}} are also provided as shock absorbers to those {{workers who are}} suspended or who work only for reduced time due to temporary difficulties of their factories. This institute, the Redundancy Fund (Cassa integrazione guadagni, CIG), aims to help the factories in financial difficulties, by relieving them from the costs of unused workforce, supporting as well those workers that might lose part of their income. In fact, it might also <b>hide</b> <b>unemployment</b> and {{have been used as}} a form of occult financing for company reorganizations between the 1960s and 1980s. The workers entitled to Redundancy Fund receive the 50% of their previous wages (80% before 1988), under a maximum level established by the law, and their contributions for pensions are taken for paid, even if they are not (contributi figurativi). The Ordinary Redundancy Fund applies for temporary events not attributable to the employer or to the workers, like a temporary market crisis. It can apply for a maximum of twelve months in two years, for a maximum period of three months continuously. The Extraordinary Redundancy Fund applies, at the contrary, to other cases in which the production completely stops, also for a long period and also due to the employer’s decisions, after the authorization of the Ministry of Labour, such as industrial reorganizations, technological unemployment, crisis of the sector, bankruptcy, etc. It applies only to companies with more than 15 employees, and only to employees with more than ninety days of previous employment; it needs a preventive communication to trade unions, with which the employer has to make a common examination of the situation and to create a project to face the consequences for workers. The period of application of the Extraordinary Redundancy Fund varies according to its causes, but cannot be more than 36 months in a period of five years.|$|R

50|$|There {{are also}} many controversies about <b>hidden</b> <b>unemployment.</b> <b>Hidden</b> <b>unemployment</b> means {{that people are}} not counted or {{considered}} as unemployed, although in reality they are unemployed. For example, young people will stay in the family home, in schooling, or in some make-work scheme, because they can't find a paid job. People might also have a job, but they might be under-employed, because they cannot get more working hours or they cannot get a job for which they are qualified. People might also drop out of the official labour force, because they are discouraged, and no longer actively looking for work - they are no longer counted as unemployed, although they are. Governments can also subsidize employment of people who would otherwise be unemployed, or put people on benefits even although they could be working. It may be that workers are hired, but that they do nothing while at work.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{availability}} of mortality data, a lack of annually accessible morbidity information for small geographical areas in England and Wales means that health studies are often restricted to using decennial, self-reported Census measures. Whilst the dissemination of census information has enabled much research, the self-assessment of health can be affected by subjective factors. Administrative data on health related benefit claims, {{in the form of}} Incapacity Benefit (IB) data, are more regularly available and claimants are professionally diagnosed. This source may have potential to be an annual small area indicator of population health. In this paper, we examine IB as an indicator of population health at local government district and sub-district levels by investigating distributions and relationships between IB and other health measures from the census and from mortality statistics. We found that relationships in 2001 between IB, census measures and mortality suggest that using IB as an indicator of population health will give similar results, especially with those reporting themselves ‘permanently sick or disabled’ and especially in more urban areas. Time series analysis also suggested that IB was a useful and updateable source of data on population health. However, although IB should be an objective measure as it is professionally diagnosed, willingness to take time off work due to sickness, to consult a doctor or to claim benefits may be affected by cultural and socio-economic factors. On the other hand, IB may be an incomplete count of ill people because some may be unable to claim benefits. Furthermore, strong relationships exist between poor health, mortality and unemployment. We recognise that IB may be <b>hiding</b> <b>unemployment</b> and have inferred an estimate using census data on economic activity to explore the relationship between IB and those reporting themselves to be permanently sick or disabled. This estimate suggests that previous assertions about the relationship between IB and unemployment may have been over zealous. On balance, IB is a useful indicator of relative health for small areas. However, the utility of Incapacity Benefit as an ongoing updatable indicator of population health depends {{on the future of the}} benefit system in view of pending reforms...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a labour market matching model {{in order to}} address the problem of the persistence of the hidden sector and of its regional concentration, as in Italy and in the enlarged Europe. The main novel features of the model are that entrepreneurial ability affects job productivity, and that regular firms receive negative externalities from the hidden sector, which may capture the pressure typically exerted by corruption and organised crime, and positive externalities from the other regular firms. At least one interior equilibrium emerges, thus providing an explanation for the so-called 'shadow puzzle', with the possibility that tougher monitoring may reduce both the <b>hidden</b> sector and <b>unemployment.</b> If externalities are non-linear, two equilibria may emerge, thus accounting for regional dualism. The 'better' equilibrium is in fact characterised by a smaller hidden sector, higher levels of overall productivity, output, entrepreneurial ability used, extra-profits, relative wages, and more favourable externalities.

40|$|Since {{the end of}} World War Two, the US {{unemployment}} rate has remained constant while the EU {{unemployment rate}} started to increase {{at the beginning of}} the 1970 s. This increase in aggregate <b>unemployment</b> <b>hides</b> dramatic differences across skill groups: the increase has remained fairly small for high-skilled workers, while it is usually considerable for the least skilled workers. What caused these developments still remains a debated issue. A possible explanation is the size of the labor market institutions, much more developed on this side of the Atlantic. To study this question, we construct an intertemporal general equilibrium model. We start from the standard Real Business Cycle (RBC) model and we extend it by adding labor market frictions and institutions (minimum wage, employment protection and unemployment benefits). We also further develop the model along the skill dimension, by assuming that the population is composed of low- and high-skilled workers. The main conclusion is that rigid institutions, and especially rigid wages, may well play an important role, direct or indirect through the interactions with exogenous shocks, to explain the relative rise in the European unemployment rate, and especially the low-skilled unemployment rate. We also show that reductions in employer's contributions, targeted at the minimum wage, lead to a fall in the destruction of the less productive jobs and therefore strongly stimulate low-skilled employment, while increasing the welfare of all individuals.

40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted {{to the study of the}} {{phenomenon}} of precarious employment in Russian regions. Today, the socio-economic sciences lack a single concept of precarious employment applicable to Russian conditions. Despite the considerable amount of scientific and practical works of domestic and foreign authors on the issue of precarious employment, the criteria of its statistical evaluation as applied to Russian conditions have not been determined. At the same time, the development of precarious employment threatens the country’s socio-economic welfare, because it creates the risk of unwanted effects such as poor employment, <b>hidden</b> and open <b>unemployment,</b> lower labor productivity, degradation of human capital, etc. The paper provides a brief review of research on the problem stated, and defines precarious employment. The author makes an attempt to determine and substantiate the list of indicators available in official statistics for assessing precarious employment in the region. The study allocates three blocks of indicators: indicators of institutional regulation, conditions of employment and functioning of the labor market. Based on these indicators, the author analyzes the status and trends of precarious work in the Vologda Oblast in the period from 2001 to 2015. In some cases, the author presents a comparative analysis of the data for the Russian Federation and Northwestern Federal District. The analysis has helped identify positive and negative changes in the field of precarious employment in the Vologda Oblast. In particular, the author identifies the following problems: an increase in the share of those employed in the informal sector, a relative increase in the number of the working poor, an almost three-fold growth of overdue debts on wages in comparable prices per worker. On the basis of this analysis, the author identifies the directions of the state policy that can help reduce precarious employment: development of information interaction between authorities and population, strengthening of control over the dynamics of overdue debt on wages in troubled sectors – agriculture, manufacturing and construction...|$|R

40|$|Extended {{abstract}} 1 -IntroductionOver {{the last}} few decades, urban marginalization {{has been a major}} challenge in the metropolitan and large cities. After various experiences of forcible contact, what is recommended by international organizations is an empowerment approach which focuses on the empowerment of squatters instead of financial support. In this study, Ahar squatters were identified and investigated in 4 neighborhoods. Using Cochran formula, 320 samples were chosen randomly and their economic, social, physical and spatial characteristics of neighborhoods were collected by questionnaires and then analyzed by SPSS software. Besides, using SWOT approach and identifying problems, strategies of Empowerment in different dimensions was presented. Results showed that Shileboran and Nirugah neighborhoods have more problems regarding socio-economic and physical status, whereas Chalabverdi neighborhood has better situation than other neighborhoods. Ownership issue, poor housing conditions, access problems and poor sewage system were serious problems for residents of these neighborhoods. 2 - Theoretical basesIn the second decades of 1980 s, empowerment strategies along with improvement in informal habitat settings are recommended to overlook the poor economic condition of families and also the inability to use the collective power. Therefore, a great leap was created in modern approach which is based on the improvement of local communities and macro policies. The entity of the empowerment approach is based on the reduction of poverty and in human-oriented sustainable development {{it is based on the}} citizen participation. 3 – DiscussionThe problem of informal settlements in Ahar city because of its geographical location as a city in northeast of Azerbaijan province and its situation in the middle of bundles of small and big villages has been accelerated to the extent that solving the problem has been a real challenge. Investigation of the situation of these districts shows that economic, social and physical situation of these districts aren’t in a good condition. Due to poor sanitary condition and free flow of sewages, keeping animals in some residential units, the possibility of infectious diseases and their development to other parts of the city are increasing. 4 – ConclusionThe results show that more than 90 % of the residents of these neighborhoods immigrated from near villages which in Shileh-boran involves nearly 95 % of residents. Furthermore, more than 80 % of the immigrations are of familial form and individual immigration is rare in these areas. Considering the occupational status of these immigrants, 45 % are workers with the average salary of 100 - 150 thousands tomans. In addition, results show that Shileh-boran and Nirougah neighborhoods have poorer economic, social and physical conditions. The problems of ownership, poor housing situation, sewage system and access can be regarded as the important problems in these areas. The analysis of the results of the SWOT show that despite the serious threats and fundamental weaknesses such as high percentage of workers in primary jobs, <b>hidden</b> and seasonal <b>unemployment,</b> high dependency ratio, limited role of women in economy of the family, poor intensity, lack of financial facilities in improving neighborhoods, disorder of streets margin space, lack of balance in void and solid spaces, narrow passages, compression of texture, inefficiency of network access, weak and inappropriate studding, facade and form, low educated ratio, migration of majority of residents, bad sanitary condition, high rate of crime between young people, there are some opportunities for empowerment of the residents and improvement in neighborhood. These opportunities can be the inclination of the municipality in improving neighborhood, government's attention to organizing the informal habitat, international aids for empowerment activities, the existence of the sense of public participation of the residents for improvement and support of the government in creating local loan boxes, can be one of the solutions for neighborhoods problems.

The paper concludes that the claimant and International Labour Organization measures of unemployment both appear deeply flawed in the UK context because of the diversion from unemployment to sickness benefits. </p...|$|E
40|$|In an {{important}} paper, Dempster, Laird and Rubin (1977) showed how the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm {{could be used}} to obtain maximum likelihood estimates of parameters in a multinomial probability model with missing information. This article extends Dempster, Laird and Rubin's work on the EM algorithm to the estimation of a multinomial logit model with missing information on category membership. We call this new model the latent multinomial logit (LMNL) model. A constrained version of the LMNL model is used to examine the issue of <b>hidden</b> <b>unemployment</b> in transition economies following the approach of Earle and Sakova (2000). We found an additional 0. 5 % <b>hidden</b> <b>unemployment</b> among workers describing themselves as self-employed in the transition economies of Central and Eastern Europe.

40|$|We {{estimate}} {{the fraction of}} <b>hidden</b> <b>unemployment</b> in the disability insurance (DI) inflow rate {{on the basis of}} a longitudinal administrative data set of Dutch employers for the period 1994 - 2003. This fraction can be identified by imposing so-called exclusion restrictions on variables that are thought to impact the layoff rate but not disability risk. We find that the fraction of <b>hidden</b> <b>unemployment</b> in DI inflow amounts to 11 per cent. This implies that 2. 6 per cent of all layoffs took place via the DI scheme. In addition, we find that this share has declined substantially over time, suggesting that various policy measures taken have been effective. Copyright 2007 The Authors.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to analyse two {{components}} of <b>hidden</b> <b>unemployment</b> in Estonia – underemployment and discouraged persons in 1997 - 2000. This is important for giving an adequate overview of the situation on the labour market in Estonia and the scope of <b>hidden</b> <b>unemployment</b> and its development in the period where strong macroeconomic shocks influenced the economy. The following tasks are set for achieving this purpose – to estimate two components of <b>hidden</b> <b>unemployment</b> and to analyse the factors that influence them. In the analysis the models are created for 1997 (the year before crises) and for 2000 (the strongest effect of the crises on the labour market) and respective Estonian Labour Force Surveys (ELFS 97 and ELFS 00) are used. The most important findings were that the steady growth of discouragement seems to have no connection with the crisis in Russia. No connection with the economic decline can be also seen in patterns of underemployment, where the number of underemployed has been decreased significantly. So, the crisis has increased only the open unemployment level. There are no general factors found, what would influence all observed categories in year before crisis and in year 2000 where the ope...|$|E
30|$|When {{economic}} reform began in China, the Chinese economy {{was a typical}} dual economy characterized by a sharp rural–urban dichotomy and high rates of <b>hidden</b> <b>unemployment</b> in both spheres. At the same time, both natural unemployment and cyclical unemployment have existed in China. The former {{is due to a}} combination of pervasive underdevelopment, inadequate public employment services, and the prevalence of mismatch between job skills and requirements. The latter is due to macroeconomic fluctuations, which happened throughout the reform period. In {{order to be able to}} focus our analytical attention on how the transition away from a dual economy reduced <b>hidden</b> <b>unemployment,</b> the effects of urban employment policy reform, and the breakup of the ‘iron rice bowl’ at SOEs, we shall assume that cyclical unemployment and natural unemployment stay relatively constant.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{regional}} utilisation of labour resources in Finland {{over the period}} 1972 - 89 is analysed. According to the results, underutilisation has increased in Southern Finland (excluding Uusimaa), while elsewhere the upward trend is not so apparent. Even though <b>hidden</b> <b>unemployment</b> has decreased {{at the expense of}} open unemployment, the <b>hidden</b> <b>unemployment</b> component remains the largest of the three components of regional underutilisation. The econometric analysis showed that regional differences in utilisation of labour resources tend to grow during upturns and diminish during downturns. Market conditions, however, seem to have no effect on regional underutilisation in the long run. The results concerning the effects of migration and regional policy were less clear. Some support was obtainedfor the hypothesis that underutilisation grows if barriers to migration increase. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{construct}} and estimate a (semi-) structural model, {{so as to}} uncover the fraction of <b>hidden</b> <b>unemployment</b> in the Disability Insurance (DI) enrolment rate. For this purpose, we use longitudinal administrative data of Dutch employers for 1994 - 2003. We find the (average) fraction of <b>hidden</b> <b>unemployment</b> in DI enrolment to amount to about 11 %. This corresponds to 2. 6 % of the `true¿ unemployment insurance (UI) enrolment rate of employers. Over the years, we observe a strong decrease in this fraction, from 5. 4 % in 1995, to 0. 7 % in 2003. In addition, our estimates suggest that most of correlation that is observed between the UI and DI enrolment rates {{can be explained by}} substitution effects, and not by `true¿ correlation between the schemes that is exogenous to the firm.

40|$|A {{number of}} policy reforms have {{recently}} been announced by the Commonwealth government to encourage greater labour force participation by older people {{in the context of}} an ageing society. These policy reforms are generally supply side in orientation such as the removal of the Mature Age Allowance, or restrictions to the Disability Support Pension. In this paper it is argued that these pensions have historically been used to accommodate otherwise unemployed older male workers. A number of methods are used to quantify the level of <b>hidden</b> <b>unemployment</b> within the older male population over recent decades. Estimates of adjusted unemployment rates, which include hidden as well as official unemployment, reveal a very dramatic picture of unutilised older male labour beneath relatively modest official unemployment rates. It is argued that without complementary employment policy addressing the labour demand side these policy reforms will achieve little except to reveal the previously high levels of <b>hidden</b> <b>unemployment</b> in official unemployment statistic...|$|E
