40|$|Abstract: In {{anorexia}} which classically {{shows the}} difficulty in adolescence to link bodily transformations and sexuality, psychic suffering is undeniable and is embodied in the body while taking into account contemporary social data. Building on some elements of the psychoanalysis of a young anorexic girl, the article attempts {{to break through the}} wall of pain and <b>get</b> <b>to</b> perceive <b>that</b> <b>in</b> an order <b>that</b> is no longer governed by the paternal instance, which allows the representation, the subject can no longer support a phallusized image and the body is reduced to its reality. This results in a particularly painful female transmission in the clinic of anorexia, in which the contemporary world is not innocent. Pain is not the goal for the anorexic; it shows a willingness to feel the existence of the body. She seeks this nothing through which she attempts to capture the rift in the Other. But to achieve this nothing she must feel the pain of its absence. Pain is thus a claimed effect. The article ends with a reflection on the therapeutic work with the anorexic subject, which would be to allow the dis-completeness of the discourse concerning it, to reintroduce a relationship to its own image marked with a lack and offer the conditions of its own enunciation...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{observational}} studies (Franx and Illingworth 1987; Jedrzejewski and Schechter 1988; Bender 1988; Illingworth and Franx 1989) {{have shown}} that some elliptical galaxies have a small region near the center <b>that</b> rotates <b>in</b> the opposite direction from the outer parts of the galaxy.

No strong color variations have been reported. The puzzle is to learn what we can about elliptical galaxies in general, and about galaxies with strange central regions in particular, from these observational facts. The authors' approach is experimental. They make a guess about the form of the dynamically distinct subsystem, and then build a galaxy model to test experimental consequences such as the amount of matter required to produce observable effects and the length of time over which these effects would remain observable.

40|$|Law is, of course, {{always a}} product of its history. But for some regimes, history matters both more and {{differently}} than for others. In some instances, the requirements and scope of a regulatory regime’s coverage are sufficiently attenuated from statutory text and purpose that they can only be explained or understood by reference to history. At its (perhaps caricatured) extreme, such a regime {{is one in which}} regulated parties expend significant efforts attempting to comply with the law and often succeed in complying at the most minimal level possible, <b>to</b> the point <b>that</b> compliance is perceived as optional and, to some non-trivial extent, is indeed so. Some set of activities the regime manages to sanction or constrain is perceived as, and to some non-trivial extent is, unanchored to any reasonable conception of the regime’s purpose. Indeed, under such a regime, activities <b>that</b> might seem <b>to</b> warrant the same treatment are sometimes treated differently, and activities <b>that</b> might seem <b>to</b> warrant different treatment are treated the same. This happens frequently enough that the regime’s coverage is difficult to justify in any principled manner, compromising its efficacy and legitimacy. What does a regime that is so importantly shaped by its trajectory look like, and how does a regime <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> state? <b>In</b> articulating its requirements and prohibitions, law often starts with a prototype, a paradigmatic case of what it wants to regulate. Ideally, where it is unclear whether particular actions resemble the prototype sufficiently to warrant sanction, the interactions between regulated parties, regulators, and other interested parties would not only resolve those cases but also refine and elaborate the regime’s goals and means for achieving them. Sometimes, however, the trajectory goes awry, and the similarity assessment yields results that depart appreciably from any reasonable conception of the regime’s text or purpose. Compounding the difficulty further, law often emphasizes certainty and encourages planning by providing detailed roadmaps of necessary and sufficient conditions for achieving particular legal consequences. Such rules are susceptible to formalistic interpretation. Law typically seeks to avoid the potentially absurd extremes of rules or formalistic interpretations of statutory text through the use of ex post standards, which often take the form of what we call goal-derived categories. Yet, given the role of precedent and predictability, at a certain point, we may just be stuck with unintended, spirit-violative results. <b>In</b> a regime <b>that</b> relies strongly on its trajectory in articulating its requirements, many rules will permit considerable spirit-violative behavior, the standards ostensibly available to address such behavior will find themselves foreclosed, and the overall coverage of the regime will reflect its history far better than its substance and purpose. In our Article, we describe a basic theory by which minimalist compliance and regulator reactions thereto may lead <b>to</b> a regime <b>that</b> is far better explained by its trajectory than by statutory or regulatory text or purpose, establishing a foundation for future work in which we will elaborate the theory in more detail and apply it comparatively across a broad range of regulatory regimes such as tax, campaign finance, antitrust, environmental law, and securities law...|$|R
30|$|For {{the problem}} type {{described}} in this research {{it is important to}} find ways to reduce noise in the data and to cope with volatility. We can derive three types of methods {{that can be used to}} reduce noise and cope with volatility in the data: aggregation, using domain knowledge and combined forecasting. Aggregation can be applied over the three dimensions of the described problem: time, outlets and products. Aggregation is heavily used in the currently used forecasting method at the case company. Domain knowledge can be used in two ways: during model building and to adjust statistical forecasts. Using domain knowledge during model building means to use domain knowledge about the structure and causal relationships of the problem to prescribe the elementary building blocks of the model used for forecasting. There are in principle two ways to model the underlying concepts: first, to know the structure and interrelationships of the underlying concept through domain knowledge and theoretical knowledge and second, to leave the detection of underlying concepts of the problem to the learning algorithm in a data mining approach. The learning algorithm in turn can only detect those concepts that are not superimposed by noise. When the noise is large, fewer concepts can be detected by the learning algorithm. Thus, if concepts are known through domain knowledge they might be of more detail than any of the concepts a learning algorithm could possibly learn when noise level is large. Therefore the concepts known already should be implemented in the forecasting model manually. An example for such a concept known from domain knowledge is the concept of the price effect on demand. We know from other research that demand is almost always increased when the price is lowered. There are only very few special cases in which this relationship does not hold. With the domain knowledge about the products offered by the case company we can exclude these special cases and <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the conclusion <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the problem domain the demand is always increased or at least unchanged if the price is lowered and vice versa.|$|R

AndresenThe growing {{needs of}} {{different}} products is only being increased {{from day to}} day and among these numerous products that each person plan to purchase, it has become a tedious task to keep track of all the products that should be purchased. One such important thing is <b>that,</b> everyone wish <b>to</b> keep track of an item when the location associated with the item is nearby. We have many To-Do applications where we can just note down our day to day needs and things <b>to</b> <b>get.</b> But we might face situations like forgetting to keep track of what we have in our To Do list related to buying an item and when the location associated to the item is nearby, there are high possibilities that we overlook and just forget about purchasing these items. These situations occurred most of the times when I did a small survey among my friends. This difficulty has lead me to rethink and find a solution. The usage of smart phones has become very common these days. Android market which is an open source has helped many people to develop their own applications and these could easily be run on Android smart phones. I thought of developing an android application <b>that</b> helps <b>in</b> tracking not only the To-Do list of the items that a person tracks down to purchase but also stores the location where that item can be purchased. This To-Do app then provide notifications when a person is nearby the location associated with the item. It also triggers an alarm so that the user can easily remember what item he has planned <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> particular location. The proposed app tries to solve most of the problems by providing an intuitive interface to the user where the user can note down all their planned purchases with location of the products and get reminders about it when passing through that location. The Near Me application is about tracking the items to be purchased or the tasks <b>that</b> are <b>to</b> be done specific to the location. Each to-do item is associated with a date, location and notes. Storing the locations in the application helps the user with timely notifications and alarms according to the location the user is in and the tasks that should be done <b>in</b> <b>that</b> location. Also these To-Do items can also be synced with online storage application like Dropbox...|$|R
