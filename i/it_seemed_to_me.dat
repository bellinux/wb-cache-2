25|$|The {{beauty and}} variety of tone, the {{impeccable}} mechanism, and the noble, architectonic conception were great pianism and great musicianship. It is not customary to compare the work of local artists favorably {{with that of the}} foreign-born great, but I cannot refrain from doing so in this case, because <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that Mr. Kirkpatrick was playing the piano as it is not often played by anybody.|$|E
25|$|Madison Square {{was then}} at the parting of the ways; had a double personality, half commercial, half social, with shops {{to the south and}} residences to the north. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> so neat, after the raggedness of our Western cities; so {{protected}} by good manners and courtesy—like an open-air drawing-room.

25|$|Of this {{head and}} two other pieces of {{sculpture}} exhibited by Brâncuși in July, 1913, at the Allied Artists' Exhibition in London, Roger Fry said in The Nation, August 2: Constantin Brâncuși's sculptures have not, I think, been seen before in England. His three heads are the most remarkable works of sculpture at the Albert Hall. Two are in brass and one in stone. They show a technical skill which is almost disquieting, a skill which might lead him, in default of any overpowering imaginative purpose, to become a brilliant pasticheur. But <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> there was evidence of passionate conviction; that the simplification of forms was no mere exercise in plastic design, but a real interpretation of the rhythm of life. These abstract vivid forms into which he compresses his heads give a vivid presentment of character; they are not empty abstractions, but filled with a content which has been clearly, and passionately apprehended.|$|E
25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E
500|$|In May 1890 Van Gogh {{left the}} clinic in Saint-Rémy to move nearer to both Dr Paul Gachet in Auvers-sur-Oise and to Theo. Gachet was an amateur painter and had treated several other artists – Camille Pissarro had {{recommended}} him. Van Gogh's first impression was that Gachet was [...] "iller than I am, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> or let's say just as much." ...|$|E

This image of a fourth traveller—echoed in the accounts of Worsley and Crean—was taken up by T. S. Eliot in his poem The Waste Land.|$|E
500|$|... what is {{interesting}} about this film, perhaps, is the moment when it was made. It was shot between Munich and the war, and I shot it absolutely impressed, absolutely disturbed {{by the state of}} mind of a part of French society, a part of English society, a part of world society. And <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that a way of interpreting this state of mind, to the world hopefully, was not to talk of that situation, but tell a frivolous story. I looked for inspiration to Beaumarchais, to Marivaux, to the classical authors of comedy.|$|E

500|$|... "During {{many years}} I {{collected}} {{notes on the}} origin or descent of man, without any intention of publishing on the subject, but rather with the determination not to publish, as I thought that I should thus only add to the prejudices against my views. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> sufficient to indicate, in {{the first edition of}} my 'Origin of Species,' that by this work 'light would be thrown on the origin of man and his history;' and this implies that man must be included with other organic beings in any general conclusion respecting his manner of appearance on this earth." [...] In a preface to the 1874 second edition, he added a reference to the second point: [...] "it has been said by several critics, that when I found that many details of structure in man could not be explained through natural selection, I invented sexual selection; I gave, however, a tolerably clear sketch of this principle in the first edition of the 'Origin of Species,' and I there stated that it was applicable to man." ...|$|E
500|$|After more behind-the-scenes {{contract}} wrangling, Smith {{became a}} St. Louis Cardinal on February 11, 1982. Herzog believed Smith could improve his offensive production by hitting more ground balls, and subsequently created a motivational tool {{designed to help}} Smith concentrate on that task. Approaching Smith one day during spring training, Herzog said, [...] "Every time you hit a fly ball, you owe me a buck. Every time you hit a ground ball, I owe you a buck. We'll keep that going all year." [...] Smith agreed to the wager, {{and by the end}} of the season had won close to $300 from Herzog. As the 1982 season got underway, Herzog's newly assembled team won 12 games in a row during the month of April, and finished the season atop the National League East division. Herzog would later say of Smith's contributions that, [...] "If he saved two runs a game on defense, which he did many a night, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that was just as valuable to the team as a player who drove in two runs a game on offense." ...|$|E
500|$|Two Swedish {{models were}} {{cast as the}} Bond girls, Britt Ekland and Maud Adams. Ekland had been {{interested}} in playing a Bond girl since she had seen Dr. No, and contacted the producers about the main role of Mary Goodnight. Hamilton met Adams in New York, and cast her because [...] "she was elegant and beautiful that <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> she was the perfect Bond girl". When Ekland read the news that Adams had been cast for The Man with the Golden Gun, she became upset, thinking Adams had been selected to play Goodnight. Broccoli then called Ekland to invite her for the main role, as after seeing her in a film, Broccoli thought Ekland's [...] "generous looks" [...] made her a good contrast to Adams. Hamilton decided to put Marc Lawrence, whom he had worked with on Diamonds Are Forever, to play a gangster shot dead by Scaramanga {{at the start of}} the film, because he found it an interesting idea to [...] "put sort of a Chicago gangster in the middle of Thailand".|$|E

500|$|Also in 1908, Jack London {{broke his}} silence on his {{condemnation}} during the controversy by publishing {{an essay in}} Collier's Weekly entitled [...] "The Other Animals". Directly addressing Roosevelt's past criticism of his novels, London called the President [...] "homocentric" [...] and [...] "amateur". He further wrote: [...] "I have been guilty of writing two animal—two books about dogs. The writing of these two stories, on my part, was in truth a protest against the 'humanizing' of animals, of which <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> several 'animal writers' had been profoundly guilty. Time and again, and many times, in my narratives, I wrote, speaking of my dog-heroes: 'He did not think these things; he merely did them,' etc. And I did this repeatedly, to the clogging of my narrative and in violation of my artistic canons; and I did {{it in order to}} hammer into the average human understanding that these dog-heroes of mine were not directed by abstract reasoning, but by instinct, sensation, and emotion, and by simple reasoning. Also, I endeavored to make my stories in line with the facts of evolution; I hewed them to the mark set by scientific research, and awoke, one day, to find myself bundled neck and crop into the camp of the nature-fakers." ...|$|E
500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{thought that}} the episode [...] "was 30 Rocks best episode of the season , if not the best episode ever from this young series." [...] Canning also said that [...] "this was just a fantastic, funny episode of 30 Rock. It was also an episode that once again proved the {{character}} of Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski), who was completely absent from this half-hour, simply isn't necessary when you've got Tracy Jordan talking to a pigeon on a trash can." [...] Canning rated this episode [...] "9.5 out of 10." [...] Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide wrote that [...] "it's not surprising that – in my opinion, at least – it fell juuuuuuust a bit short. It's {{almost as if the}} funniest parts of the Edie Falco story were played by [...] Wiig in the Lifetime movie." [...] He thought that [...] "the 'Liz suspects the neighbor is a terrorist' story played out rather well." [...] Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Overall, [...] another splendid [...] My only beef was with the Verizon bit. 30 Rock normally does a splendid job of balancing the corporate elements of television, often utilizing it for comic fodder. But the winking cell phone banter lacked subtlety, and <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like the show was trying to have its cake and eat it, too." ...|$|E
