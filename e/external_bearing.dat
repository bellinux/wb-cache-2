There is nothing that so apes the <b>external</b> <b>bearing</b> of free will as that unconscious bustle, obscurely following liquid laws, with which a river contends among obstructions. It seems the very play of man and destiny, and as Otto pored on these recurrent changes, he grew, by equal steps, the sleepier and the more profound.

50|$|With the {{development}} of <b>external</b> <b>bearing</b> designs, the standard shell diameter has become a considerable constraint, limiting both {{the diameter of the}} bottom bracket spindle {{and the size of the}} actual bearing balls in the races. Consequently, these <b>external</b> <b>bearing</b> designs can be less durable than older internal bearing designs. To address this problem several designers have recently promoted proposed standards for a larger diameter bottom bracket shell, the best known of which is the BB30 standard promoted by Cannondale. The name BB30 refers to the 30mm diameter of the spindle, not of the shell.|$|E
50|$|Truvativ's {{approach}} is an {{evolution of the}} ISIS Drive bottom bracket. The spindle is made longer, and the bearings sit outside the bottom bracket shell. The spindle is permanently pressed into the right crank. The left side spline interface looks similar, but is different so as to prevent installation of older ISIS Drive crankarms—which are no longer compatible because Q-factor and chainline can not be maintained using these older cranks with an <b>external</b> <b>bearing</b> BB. They refer to this design as 'Giga-X-Pipe' or 'GXP.' They also make a heavier duty <b>external</b> <b>bearing</b> bottom bracket called 'Howitzer.' The Howitzer BB {{is more like a}} traditional BB in that the spindle is not permanently pressed into the right crank. Again, the Howitzer spline looks similar to the ISIS Drive standard spline but is actually different, so as to prevent the usage of ISIS Drive cranks on the <b>external</b> <b>bearing</b> BB, which would affect chainline and Q-factor.|$|E

The terms 'X-Type' and 'Hollowtech II' are both used to refer to any design of this type, but are in fact trademarks of the corporations marketing the systems. These <b>external</b> <b>bearings</b> are compatible with those from other manufacturers.

In late 2006, Campagnolo {{announced that it was}} abandoning the square taper interface for double chainsets in favor of an outboard bearing design called Ultra-Torque, which uses a splined interface between spindle halves.|$|E
5000|$|Cannondale {{developed}} a proprietary bottom bracket and crankset technology called Hollowgram {{which has been}} featured in its high-end bikes since 2001. The crank and bottom bracket set weigh 80 grams less and are 10% stiffer than Dura-Ace (FC-7800). [...] The hollowgram bottom bracket shell can accept standard 68 mm English-threaded bottom bracket cartridges and <b>external</b> <b>bearing</b> cranksets {{through the use of}} an adapter. The aluminum Hollowgram crank is a two piece hollow shell that is bonded with aluminum glue. The Hollowgram bottom bracket axle is also hollow aluminum and oversized.|$|E
50|$|Cannondale {{has brought}} a few {{concepts}} to market that have since become accepted industry standards. Cannondale {{was the first to}} produce a crankset that uses externally mounted bottom bracket bearings, though they later discontinued this design. <b>External</b> <b>bearings</b> are now {{the most common type of}} bottom bracket for mid-level and higher bicycles. In 1992, Cannondale introduced the Headshok and the accompanying oversized headtube.In 2001, the OnePointFive standard emerged using similar headtube dimensions as the Headshok headtube.|$|R
50|$|If {{the sea was}} calm, it was {{sometimes}} possible {{to make out the}} wake of a submerged submarine's periscope poking above the surface, or even the faint outline of the submarine itself it was running just below the surface.

5000|$|Many current {{designs are}} now using an {{integrated}} bottom bracket with outboard bearings. This {{is an attempt to}} address several issues associated with weight and stiffness. Because of the relatively small 1.37" [...] (36 mm for shells threaded to the Italian standard) diameter shell, designs that place the bearings inside the shell can either have large bearings and a thinner spindle, which lacks stiffness, or smaller bearings and a thicker spindle (such as the original Shimano Octalink), which lacks durability. <b>External</b> <b>bearings</b> allow for a large diameter (hence stiff) and hollow (hence light) spindle. They also offer more distance between the two bearing surfaces, which contributes to stiffness while allowing lighter components. A different approach would be to standardise on the larger BMX shell for all bicycles, or the BB30 standard originally introduced by Cannondale.|$|R
50|$|Magic Motorcycle, a small USA {{component}} manufacturer {{that was later}} purchased by Cannondale, and re-formed into Cannondale's CODA brand (Coda Magic 900 cranks), made a proprietary <b>external</b> <b>bearing</b> bottom bracket, oversized spindle and crank system in the early 1990s. This design {{is similar to the}} external Bottom Bracket designs that are currently being marketed by FSA, RaceFace and Shimano. The modern versions are using the same bearing size (6805-RS) and even the original mounting tool fits but the bearings are sitting closer to the frame now. The crank had intricately CNC machined wide hollow crank arms made of two halves glued together. However, Cannondale moved on and developed the SI cranks and the new BB30 bottom bracket standard. Their special frames have a larger bottom bracket shell allowing the bearings to be inside again while their top level SI crankarms are still two machined aluminum halves glued together.|$|E

Two stories broke about former SS-Aufseherin ("Overseer") Ingeborg Schimming-Assmuss {{who was accused of}} killing four prisoners at the camp and on the death march into Czechoslovakia. One article began [...] "DEATH FORSTALLED the LAW." [...] "The camp called her 'the Terrible Inge'- Inge Assmuss, earlier Schimming, one of 27 guards inside the <b>external</b> <b>bearing</b> Helmbrechts." [...] She was hidden from prosecution by the State Security Service in Berlin for over 50 years. The first record of murder was done by Ingeborg, {{as well as the other}} female guards in Helmbrechts on February 24, 1945. She and the other overseers flogged a female inmate, Dr. Alexandra Samoylenko to death for escaping. The act was tolerated and ordered by camp commandant Alois Doerr. Another former prisoner related, [...] "...on the first day after the march began an Aufseherin-she was called Inge-tore my completely weakened friend Bassia from my arms with a switch and dragged her into the forest. I heard a shot. Subsequently, the Aufseherin returned alone." [...] Two other inmates also related to Allied forces that the Aufseherin killed other internees. In 1951 a warrant was issued for Ingeborg's arrest to the GDR. Authorities in East Berlin refused to hand over the former SS employee, saying that 'she works for us.' In 1989 the Berlin Wall fell and Inge was still living in East Berlin, scarcely fifty meters from the former wall. In 1994 she was discovered living in Berlin-Pankow. In 1996 Ingeborg Schimming-Assmuss died, a free woman. The German government was in the process of prosecuting the former female guard, but as the title of the article stated, death stopped all proceedings. She was seventy-four years old.|$|E

60|$|An {{extraordinary}} and unforeseen circumstance changed the <b>external</b> <b>bearings</b> of this critical conflict of ideas. The {{conception of the}} duties of the temporal authority in the spiritual sphere had been associated hitherto with Catholic doctrine. The decay of that doctrine was rapidly discrediting the conception allied with it. But the movement was interrupted. And it was interrupted by a man who suddenly stepped out from the ranks of the Encyclopædists themselves. Rousseau from his solitary cottage at Montmorency (1758) fulminated the celebrated letter to D'Alembert on Stage Plays. The article on Geneva in the seventh volume of the Encyclopædia had not only praised the pastors for their unbelief; it also assailed the time-honoured doctrine of the churches that the theatre is an institution from hell and an invention of devils. D'Alembert paid a compliment to his patriarch and master at Ferney, as well as shot a bolt at his ecclesiastical foes in Paris, by urging the people of Geneva to shake off irrational prejudices and straightway to set up a playhouse. Rousseau had long been brooding over certain private grievances of his own against Diderot; the dreary story has been told by me before, and happily need not be repeated.[146] He took the occasion of D'Alembert's mischievous suggestion to his native Geneva, not merely to denounce the drama with all the force and eloquence at his command, but formally to declare the breach between himself and Diderot. From this moment he treated the Holbachians--so he contemptuously styled the Encyclopædists--as enemies of the human race and disseminators of the deadliest poisons.|$|R

Visual and inertial sensing are two sensory modalities that can be explored to give robust solutions on image segmentation and recovery of 3 D structure from images, increasing the capabilities of autonomous robots and enlarging the application potential of vision systems. In biological systems, the {{information provided by the}} vestibular system is fused at a very early processing stage with vision, playing a key role on the execution of visual movements such as gaze holding and tracking, and the visual cues aid the spatial orientation and body equilibrium. In this paper, we set a framework for using inertial sensor data in vision systems, and describe some results obtained. The unit sphere projection camera model is used, providing a simple model for inertial data integration. Using the vertical reference provided by the inertial sensors, the image horizon line can be determined. Using just one vanishing point and the vertical, we can recover the camera’s focal distance and provide an <b>external</b> <b>bearing</b> for the system’s navigation frame of reference. Knowing the geometry of a stereo rig and its pose from the inertial sensors, the collineation of level planes can be recovered, providing enough restrictions to segment and reconstruct vertical features and leveled planar patches.

Researches on finding discrepancies in operation of support for this purpose have been executed. The reasons of occurrence the fatigue crumbling on <b>external</b> <b>bearing</b> races at different stages development of working surface damage have been investigated. The basic constructions of support of shaft for the aviation gas turbine engine and methods of their lubrication have been considered.

40|$|The {{testing of}} a rocket engine oxygen {{turbopump}} using high pressure ambient temperature nitrogen and oxygen as the turbine drive gas in separate test series is discussed. The pumped fluid was liquid nitrogen or liquid oxygen. The turbopump (TPA) {{is designed to}} operate with 400 F oxygen turbine drive gas which will be demonstrated in a subsequent test series. Following bearing tests, the TPA was finish machined (impeller blading and inlet/outlet ports). Testing started on 15 February 1989 and was successfully concluded on 21 March 1989. Testing started using nitrogen to reduce the ignition hazard during initial TPA checkout. The Hydrostatic Bearing System requires a Bearing Pressurization System. Initial testing used a separate bearing supply to prevent a rubbing start. Two test series were successfully completed with the bearing assist supplied only by the pump second stage output which entailed a rubbing start until pump pressure builds up. The final test series used ambient oxygen drive and no <b>external</b> <b>bearing</b> assist. Total operating time was 2268 seconds. There were 14 starts without bearing assist and operating speeds up to 80, 000 rpm were logged.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) planar motor under closed loop control, which can be applied as an ultra precision multi-axis manipulator. In papers presented so far on this topic, a SAW motor is driven in open loop. The slider is manipulated by inducing a repetitive small number of wave periods. In this way a slow slider motion can be generated, which however, is not constant during the cycle time. Although very small steps have been reported for SAW actuators operating in open loop (in the order of 2 nm), the reproducibility of such open loop steering is low in an environment with disturbances. Therefore, one of our focus points is closed loop control of the SAW actuator. To investigate the open- and closed-loop behaviour, two linear SAW motor demonstrators have been developed. Measurements have shown that for conventional actuation a dead band appears in the response of the input signal to the speed of the motor. To overcome this phenomenon, a different way of continuous actuation is presented in this paper, on which a patent has been filed. As a result of the investigations of the linear demonstrators, a closed loop controlled planar SAW motor has been designed, which is under construction and is scheduled to be operational in the spring of 2002. This planar motor concept features a simple and compact construction with low moving mass, since the drive- and guiding-systems are combined, without the need for <b>external</b> <b>bearings,</b> transmissions or guiding systems. Compared to stacked linear systems, a high stiffness and good dynamic behaviour can be achieved. Further experiments are planned to establish the potential benefits of a planar SAW motor in applications of precision engineering and nanotechnology...|$|R
