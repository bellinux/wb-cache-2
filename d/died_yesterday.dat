2500|$|On {{behalf of}} the Emperor, Prime Minister Count Eduard Taaffe issued a {{statement}} at noon that Rudolf had died [...] "due to a rupture of an aneurism of the heart". The Imperial family and court were still {{under the impression that}} he had been poisoned and it appears that even Mary's mother, Baroness Helene Vetsera, initially believed this. It was only when the court medical commission headed by Dr. Widerhofer arrived in Mayerling that afternoon that a more accurate cause of death was established, and not until 6 a.m. the following morning, when Widerhofer made his report to the Emperor, that the true state of affairs became known. The official gazette of Vienna still reported the original story that day: [...] "His Royal and Imperial Highness, Crown Prince Archduke Rudolf, <b>died</b> <b>yesterday</b> at his hunting lodge of Mayerling, near Baden, from the rupture of an aneurism of the heart." ...|$|E

60|$|For, as {{one word}} is {{frequently}} not a name, but {{only part of}} a name, so a number of words often compose one single name, and no more. These words, “The place which the wisdom or policy of antiquity had destined for the residence of the Abyssinian princes,” form in the estimation of the logician only one name; one Categorematic term. A mode of determining whether any set of words makes only one name, or more than one, is by predicating something of it, and observing whether, by this predication, we make only one assertion or several. Thus, when we say, John Nokes, who was {{the mayor of the}} town, died yesterday—by this predication we make but one assertion; whence it appears that “John Nokes, who was the mayor of the town,” is no more than one name. It is true that in this proposition, besides the assertion that John Nokes <b>died</b> <b>yesterday,</b> there is included another assertion, namely, that John Nokes was mayor of the town. But this last assertion was already made: we did not make it by adding the predicate, “died yesterday.” Suppose, however, that the words had been, John Nokes and the mayor of the town, they would have formed two names instead of one. For when we say, John Nokes and the mayor of the town <b>died</b> <b>yesterday,</b> we make two assertions: one, that John Nokes died yesterday; the other, that the mayor of the town <b>died</b> <b>yesterday.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore the logic of now, yesterday, today and {{tomorrow}} by combining the semantic approach to indexicality pioneered by Hans Kamp [9] and refined by David Kaplan [10] with hybrid tense logic. We first introduce a special now nominal (our @now corresponds to Kamp’s original now operator N) and prove completeness results for both logical and contextual validity. We then add propositional constants to handle yesterday, today and tomorrow; our system correctly treats sentences like “Niels will <b>die</b> <b>yesterday</b> ” as contextually unsatisfiable. Building on our completeness results for now, we prove completeness for the richer language, again for both logical and contextual validity. Keywords: Hybrid logic, two-dimensional logic, nominals, indexicals, now Human languages are rife with indexicals. Words like now, here, and I are context sensitive: when uttered at different times and places by different speakers they denote different times, places and people, and they do so in...|$|R

60|$|In the United Kingdom, {{on the rim}} of the Western Ocean, {{live the}} English folk. They are a consummately civilised people. Their capital amounts to at least 300 pounds per head. They gain their food, not by hunting and fishing, but by toil at colossal artifices. For the most part, they suffer from lack of shelter. The greater number of them are vilely housed, do not have enough fuel to keep them warm, and are insufficiently clothed. A {{constant}} number never have any houses at all, and sleep shelterless under the stars. Many are to be found, winter and summer, shivering on the streets in their rags. They have good times and bad. In good times most of them manage to get enough to eat, in bad times they die of starvation. They are dying now, they were <b>dying</b> <b>yesterday</b> and last year, they will die to-morrow and next year, of starvation; for they, unlike the Innuit, suffer from a chronic condition of starvation. There are 40,000,000 of the English folk, and 939 out of every 1000 of them die in poverty, while a constant army of 8,000,000 struggles on the ragged edge of starvation. Further, each babe that is born, is born in debt to the sum of 22 pounds. This is because of an artifice called the National Debt.|$|R
