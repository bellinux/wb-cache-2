While foreign doctors did assist with the Chernobyl incident, the Soviet relief effort after the earthquake was augmented by the largest foreign cooperation since World War II. That deluge of western aid was a byproduct of the disaster that {{may have had a}} positive effect on Soviet Union–United States relations. The cost of rebuilding would be a severe obstacle for Perestroika, Gorbachev's plan for economic restructuring. Another adverse effect of the disaster was that the Armenians were already distrustful of Gorbachev's dismissal of their claims to the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, which the Armenians had been contesting with neighboring Azerbaijan.|$|E
5|$|The First Test at Brisbane was {{dominated}} by Australia, a pattern {{that was to be}} a feature of the series, although Barnes contributed only 31 to the total of 645 which brought an innings victory. Barnes displayed his liking for slightly aggressive practical jokes in this match: during a break for a particularly ferocious thunderstorm, he got a huge block of ice out of the tub in which our drinks were kept, staggered {{to the side of the}} dressing-room and tossed it on to the roof over the English dressing-room. It caused a noise <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>start</b> that brought all the Englishmen running and then it came over the side of the gutter, crashed on to the lawn and slithered down the grass.

25|$|Perhaps {{the best}} known of these topics is Evolution and Ethics, which deals with the {{question}} of whether biology has anything particular to say about moral philosophy.

Next, he believes the mental characteristics of man are as much a product of evolution as the physical aspects. Thus, our emotions, our intellect, our tendency to prefer living in groups and spend resources on raising our young are part and parcel of our evolution, and therefore inherited.|$|E

Though he was initially supposed to be making a rehab start in Double-A for the Reading Fightin' Phils that day, an 18-inning game the previous night caused the Phillies to have a shortage of pitchers and as such, Halladay returned to the major leagues on August 25 <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>start</b> against the Arizona Diamondbacks in which he threw six innings, allowing two runs on four hits with two walks and two strikeouts.|$|E
25|$|The Nationals {{started their}} season by taking {{two out of}} three in a series at home against the Miami Marlins, a {{division}} rival in the National League East. The team began their 2017 campaign with an unusual roster configuration of 14 position players and 11 pitchers, but they reverted to a more typical 13-and-12 split by purchasing the contract of right-handed pitcher Jeremy Guthrie <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>start</b> on April 8 at Citizens Bank Park against the rival Philadelphia Phillies and optioning outfielder Michael A. Taylor to Class-AAA Syracuse of the International League. After Guthrie gave up 10 earned runs and got just two outs — statistically the worst start in Montreal–Washington franchise history, and only the fourth time in the past 100 years a pitcher had allowed double-digit earned runs without recording at least three outs — en route to a 17–3 loss, the spot starter was designated for assignment the next morning, and the Nationals selected the contract of minor league reliever Matt Albers.|$|E

500|$|Holloman {{made his}} major league debut on April 14 in a relief appearance.

They have to work hard to resolve their differences and there is a big transition. I can see why she behaves the way she does—you do become over-protective with a baby.
