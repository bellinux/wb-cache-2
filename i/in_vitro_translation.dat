50|$|The {{synthesis}} of an mRNA display library starts from the {{synthesis of}} a DNA library. A DNA library for any protein or small peptide of interest can be synthesized by solid-phase synthesis followed by PCR amplification. Usually, each member of this DNA library has a T7 RNA polymerase transcription site and a ribosomal binding site at the 5’ end. The T7 promoter region allows large-scale in vitro T7 transcription to transcribe the DNA library into an mRNA library, which provides templates for the <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>translation</b> reaction later. The ribosomal binding site in the 5’-untranslated region (5’ UTR) is designed according to the <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>translation</b> system to be used. There are two popular commercially available <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>translation</b> systems. One is E. Coli S30 Extract System (Promega) that requires a Shine-Dalgarno sequence in the 5’ UTR as a ribosomal binding site; {{the other one is}} Red Nova Lysate (Novagen), which needs a ΔTMV ribosomal binding site.|$|E

50|$|A {{variation}} of the MerIP-seq method was coined by Benjamin Delatte and colleagues in 2016.

Antibodies directed against bacterial fusion proteins encoding amino acid sequences from a highly conserved region of the NS- 1 polypeptides of two other parvoviruses, minute virus of mice and the human virus B 19, gave specific nuclear fluorescence with BPV-infected cells, although the antibodies failed to immunoprecipitate any viral proteins.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to determine the role of acidic ribosomal protein (ARP) phosphorylation in translation. Ribosomes (Rbs) from germinated maize (Zea mays L.) axes had four ARP bands within 4. 2 to 4. 5 isoelectric points when analyzed by isoelectric focusing. Two of these bands disappeared after alkaline phosphatase hydrolysis. During germination a progressive change from nonphosphorylated (0 h) to phosphorylated ARP (24 h) forms was observed in the Rbs; a free cytoplasmic pool of nonphosphorylated ARPs was also identified by immunoblot and isoelectric focusing experiments. De novo ARP synthesis initiated very slowly early in germination, whereas ARP phosphorylation occurred rapidly within this period.
