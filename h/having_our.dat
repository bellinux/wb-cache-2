In the fourth Crystal Habit podcast which premiered at the Tomb Raider blog on 17 October 2011, Marie spoke to Wilmer and lead {{sound designer}} Jack Grillo about their collaboration(s) with the unannounced composer.

500|$|By {{the time}} David Scarpa started writing {{a draft of}} the script in 2005, Thomas Rothman was in charge of Fox and felt a {{responsibility}} to remake the film. Scarpa felt everything about the original film was still relevant, but changed the allegory from nuclear war to environmental damage because [...] "the specifics of [...] we now have the capability to destroy ourselves have changed." [...] Scarpa noted the recent events of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 informed his mindset when writing the screenplay. He scrapped Klaatu's speech {{at the conclusion of the}} story because [...] "audiences today are willing to tolerate that. People don't want to be preached to about the environment.

500|$|In June 2015, it was {{revealed}} that the season would include the Secret Warriors team by introducing Inhuman characters inspired by the comic of the same name. The episode [...] "Emancipation" [...] is set in the aftermath of Civil War, and deals with how the Secret Warriors and other Inhumans are affected by the Sokovia Accords, with some members of the S.H.I.E.L.D. team feeling [...] "Inhumans should be registered and [...] who feel that's a first step to them being sequestered, imprisoned, exterminated." [...] Wen noted that [...] "The connection is there, but it’s also very tenuous at this point, because S.H.I.E.L.D. has become so isolated with what’s going on with the Avengers and them not knowing still that Coulson is alive." [...] On how the themes of Civil War allowed the series to make more of a philosophical tie-in than with previous films, Whedon stated that [...] "we do have people across the globe who have powers on our show and there would be varying reactions to that. A lot of fear, some excitement, some people wanting to use it for good, some people wanting to use it for evil. So, a lot of those same themes [...] will be addressed on our show." [...] Bennet added, [...] "we've been dealing with the bigger issues of Civil War on a smaller, more personal scale for a while now. It's been building.

500|$|... "Pyramids" [...] was {{received}} with universal acclaim from music critics. Complex Magazine named it track [...] "song of the week" [...] upon release. Complex later named the song the fourth best song of 2012. Siân Rowe of NME compared the track to Prince’s [...] "Purple Rain" [...] {{and reported that}} the song [...] "is the kind of track you’ll lose hours and hours of your life to. This week alone, NME has spent at least two days <b>having</b> <b>our</b> minds freaked on by its space funk swirl." [...] Pitchforks Evan Minsker labeled it a [...] "Best New Track" [...] and wrote that [...] "the song's a 10-minute R event, traveling from club banger ancient Egypt ('send the cheetahs to the tomb') to the slow jam strip club('she's workin' at the Pyramid tonight'). It's a journey well-suited to Ocean's smooth croon." [...] The publication's Ryan Dombal commented, [...] "essentially reincarnates {{one of the most}} storied female rulers in history as a six-inch-heeled woman of the night. However, the song doesn't read as an indictment of the last 2,000 years as much as yet another attempt to cleverly level the playing field." [...] The Telegraphs Neil McCormick stated that the track was the [...] "real miracle of the album", noting that while Ocean [...] "can embark on something as flamboyant as Pyramids - a 10-minute, tempo-shifting, minor-chord narrative of Egyptian queens and Las Vegas strippers, marrying Tangerine Dream sequencers and a jazzy John Mayer guitar solo to a rapturous slow jam – and make it all seem to make sense." ...|$|E
500|$|Justice Scalia {{also criticized}} the majority's {{conclusion}} that the tip provided reasonable suspicion that Lorenzo and Jose Prado Navarette were driving while drunk, because [...] "the truck might have swerved to avoid an animal, a pothole, or a jaywalking pedestrian .... Or, indeed, he might have intentionally forced the tipster off the road because of some personal animus, or hostility to her 'Make Love, Not War' bumper sticker." [...] Furthermore, Justice Scalia argued that one discrete instance of irregular driving does not give rise to the reasonable suspicion of an ongoing threat of an intoxicated driver on the road. Justice Scalia also argued that the anonymous tip's claims of reckless driving were ultimately discredited {{by the fact that}} officers followed Lorenzo and Jose for five minutes, but observed nothing suspicious. He wrote, [...] "I take it as a fundamental premise of our intoxicated-driving laws that a driver soused enough to swerve once can be expected to swerve again — and soon. If he does not, and if the only evidence of his first episode of irregular driving is a mere inference from an uncorroborated, vague, and nameless tip, then the Fourth Amendment requires that he be left alone." [...] In his concluding remarks, Justice Scalia wrote [...] "runken driving is a serious matter, but so is the loss of our freedom to come and go as we please without police interference .... After today’s opinion all of us on the road, and not just drug dealers, are at risk of <b>having</b> <b>our</b> freedom of movement curtailed on suspicion of drunkenness, based upon a phone tip, true or false, of a single instance of careless driving." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gloria Foster, {{instead of}} searching for fame by trying to be in many {{different}} productions, searched for roles in which {{she would be able}} to perform at the best of her ability. [...] She once said, [...] "Young people today, I think, are thinking in terms of stepping stones.…I don't know that I ever thought that way. [...] It sounds ridiculous, but I was always thinking in terms of a more difficult role". [...] She won fame by performing her roles magnificently, not by performing the maximum number of roles that she could. [...] She read many scripts, but only chose the ones that spoke truly to her. [...] By the end of her acting career, she was rewarded with three Obie awards, for In White America (1963) and A Raisin In the Sun, and was in the Broadway production of <b>Having</b> <b>Our</b> Say (1995).|$|E
2500|$|Early on, his {{temperament}} {{affected his}} performance in the court. For example, he deemed John Clarke, another Wilson appointee to the court, to be [...] "too liberal" [...] and refused to speak with him. Clarke made an early decision to leave the Court, and McReynolds's antipathy was a factor given by Clarke. However, another possible reason was his hope of an appointment by President Wilson as his representative to the nascent League of Nations, and writing to the President that {{he felt it was}} his [...] "duty to devote what might remain to me of life and health and strength to doing what I could to cultivate public opinion in our country to <b>having</b> <b>our</b> government take some share in the effort which many other nations are making to devise some rational substitute for irrational war".

2500|$|In 2015 Rice {{expressed}} his indebtedness to the journalist Angus McGill as “the {{man responsible for}} Andrew Lloyd Webber and I <b>having</b> <b>our</b> first song recorded”. Speaking at McGill’s funeral, Rice told a tale from his days at EMI about trying to rig {{the results of the}} London Evening Standard Girl of the Year competition in 1967. As “glorified office boy”, Rice was writing songs with Lloyd Webber and desperate to find anybody to record one of their songs. Rice and colleagues filled in 5,000 entry forms overnight voting for the contestant who was a singer, and delivered them to McGill, who supervised the competition. Rice said it was “a disgraceful act of dishonesty on my part... without actually breaking the rules”. As a result, the Standard proclaimed two Girls of the Year and Rice’s choice was signed to EMI where she made her first record. Rice said at the funeral: “I owe [...] an awful lot, which {{is just one of the}} reasons why I’m here today.” ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the federal}} {{political}} level, {{there was a}} debate on the privatization of food inspection. A cabinet document leaked {{earlier in the year}} outlined a plan to save money at the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) by shifting federal meat inspectors into an oversight role and leaving companies to implement their own methods. Liberal leader Stéphane Dion was harshly critical and drew comparisons to the 2000 Walkerton tainted water tragedy and the privatization of propane inspection, which he blamed for the 2008 Toronto explosions. Gerry Ritz responded that the CFIA had added 200 inspectors since the Conservatives came to power, adding, [...] "As opposed to <b>having</b> <b>our</b> inspectors standing line by line, they'll have a more oversight role within the plant itself [...] We're trying to build a better mousetrap here." [...] New Democratic Party agriculture critic Alex Atamanenko said he strongly opposed the apparent privatization plans.

Discussing del Toro, Miller stated: [...] "We worked out a system {{for him to come}} in once every few months or whenever we had something new to show him. If we needed someone to bounce ideas off of, he was always there, and if we had a problem we were tackling, we'd get Guillermo on the red phone – our emergency phone – and ask him advice on what we should do with a certain character or scene. It was like <b>having</b> <b>our</b> own film school." [...] Miller stated that del Toro was particularly involved in Humpty's character design. [...] "Guillermo loved the dreamy quality of Humpty Dumpty. He suggested we push that further, make him more like da Vinci." [...] It was del Toro's idea to make Humpty [...] "an ingenious freak of nature" [...] who builds contraptions such as a flying machine. Del Toro rewrote the ending to redeem the character and deepen his relationship with Puss – an unconventional conclusion for a children's film. He helped design the fantasy elements of the giant's castle, as well as the architecture of the town, which he conceived as [...] "an amalgam of Spain and Mexico".|$|E
2500|$|Eliseo Medina was {{considered}} by many to be a successor to César Chávez. In 1977, Medina was elected Second Vice President of the UFW (replacing Philip Vera Cruz), which added credence to these assumptions. He was also probably the only member of the UFW who could have successfully challenged Chávez for the presidency of the union. UFW co-founded Dolores Huerta said, [...] "He would have been president if he'd stayed." [...] But Medina did not stay. [...] For the past several years, Medina had been having serious disagreements with Chávez about the low level of worker input into the union's direction. Additionally, Medina felt Chávez was trying to turn the union into a poor people's social movement, a policy change Medina also disagreed with. [...] "We were so close, and then it began to fall apart... At the time we were <b>having</b> <b>our</b> greatest success, Cesar got sidetracked. Cesar was more interested in leading a social movement than a union per se," [...] he later said. Medina was also frustrated by Chávez's insistence that all UFW staff be unpaid volunteers, a policy not conducive to building a professional, long-lasting union. At a UFW executive board meeting shortly before he resigned, Chávez publicly criticized Medina for proposing that the union hire full-time organizers. Medina later said: ...|$|E
2500|$|The 14th century saw {{a wave of}} {{travelers}} who left records of their travels. [...] In 1323 the Anglo-Irish friar Simon Fitzsimon (Symon Semeonis) visited the area with his friend Hugh (who died in Cairo) and observed [...] "the granaries (...) of Joseph mentioned in Genesis. [...] They are three in number, of which two are of such size and height that at a distance they look more like the summits of mountains than repositories of corn." [...] In 1349 the Tuscan monk Niccolò Poggibonsi noted that [...] "three miles outside Babylon there are granaries, which are called Pharaoh's granaries. [...] Joseph, the son of Jacob, had them built." [...] He continues: [...] "three are outside Babylon, which are so big that coming from Alexandria they can be seen 60 miles away. [...] The said seven granaries are diamond shaped and within is a large house, above and below of porphyry; and within there is a deep pit. [...] And many a time we threw in stones and did not hear them strike the bottom and it looked very dark, and we left at once through fear, <b>having</b> <b>our</b> little torch quenched from the wind, which came from there." [...] The year 1374 saw thirteen Tuscan travelers make the pilgrimage to the Holy Land, three of which left accounts: Leonardo Frescobaldi, Simone Sigoli, and Giorgio Gucci. [...] Frescobaldi makes a brief mention of [...] "the granaries which Joseph had made {{at the time of}} Pharaoh king of Egypt, {{in the days of the}} famine." [...] Sigoli offers a fuller and more literary account, noting that [...] "Joseph found means to have from every side as much corn as he could, and quickly he collected a very great number of bushels, and this grain he put in these granaries. [...] And they are among the biggest edifices to be seen: and they are three and distant one from another a stones throw; and they are built of very great long thick stones and in shape like a diamond; the base is very wide and the summit pointed ... and each has four sides, and the corn was placed inside: just imagine the very great amount amount that inside would take." [...] Gucci appears to have reflected a bit more on what he saw: [...] "These granaries, which are of giant structure, are said to have been made by Pharaoh at the time of the great famine at the time of Joseph, though to see them they appear to be works for perpetual memory rather than granaries. [...] In 1392 Thomas Brygg, an Englishman who later became mayor of Bordeaux, noted the [...] "famous granaries of wondrous size which Joseph, the son of Jacob, had built in the days of Pharaoh." [...] In 1395 the French lord Ogier d'Anglure described the challenges of getting to the foot of the Pyramids and the commotion of workers stripping the smooth facing: [...] "the great stones falling like so many vine plants that these masons were chopping down." [...] "It should be explained," [...] he continues, [...] "that these granaries are called Pharaoh's Granaries; and the pharaoh had them built in the time when Joseph, the son of Jacob, was governor over all the kingdom of Egypt ... As for describing the inside of these granaries, we could hardly speak of it, since the entrance from above is walled up and there are enormous tombs in front of it ... the entrances were closed up because people had been using the places to make counterfeit money." ...|$|E
