However, Joseph's $8 million USD per year contract made him hard to move. After {{a stint in the}} minors, he returned to the Red Wings lineup while Hašek was nursing a groin injury. The Red Wings plan was to attract him to other teams until Hašek returned to the lineup. But in February, Hašek decided to call <b>it</b> <b>quits</b> for the season, which once again solidified Joseph's position as the Red Wings starting goaltender. The Wings finished first overall in the league.

25|$|In March, {{three models}} with the world's first {{electric}} power steering (CGPF/CGPL/CGPJ) {{were added to the}} lineup, at a juicy ¥150,000 surcharge. Actress and pop idol Yuka Ōnishi (大西結花) was the spokesperson for the ad campaign, while an all female motorcycle racing team (Team Angela) raced a Turbocharged Cervo in the Safari Rally. However, it was all to no avail: The rivals, Daihatsu's new Leeza and Mazda's Autozam Carol both sold much better. Combined with the removal of certain tax breaks for small cargo vehicles, this meant that the Cervo's already narrow slot in the market had essentially disappeared. When the new 660cc Kei regulations were introduced, Suzuki decided to call <b>it</b> <b>quits</b> rather than {{spend a lot of money}} to update such a slow-selling vehicle and Cervo production ended in May 1990.|$|E

25|$|According to the biography, {{the group}} had almost called <b>it</b> <b>quits</b> during {{the writing of the}} album. The band had written about 16 songs in the 3 years spent on the road touring and had {{expected}} to cut the list to 10 after settling down to record in their New Orleans home studio. Weeks of working with old ideas and bickering between the bandmates led the group to begin searching for an outside producer to help focus the group and stabilize the tension. During this search, the group met producer Dennis Herring and after hearing his input, decided to scrap all the previously written material and start from scratch, bringing Herring on board as producer of the album. The band worked over the next three months writing almost 20 new songs that would shape Armistice. The band then spent time at Herring's studio in Oxford, Mississippi recording the final touches of the album.|$|E
25|$|Morey {{demonstrated}} his {{engine in}} New York and Philadelphia {{and there are}} eyewitness reports for both. In Philadelphia, he demonstrated it powering a boat and a wagon. Unfortunately, {{when he decided to}} demonstrate the car on the street, he fell off after starting the engine and the vehicle powered across Market Street into a ditch. This was the second car ride in the world, and the first in the United States. Despite these mostly successful demonstrations, Morey could not find a buyer, and became frustrated. A letter from Reverend Dana of Orford written in October 1829 tells of Morey’s trip to Baltimore, “I am told, the Capt. Is determined to make one more vigorous effort, to sell his patent right for some of his modern inventions , and if he does not now succeed, he will give the matter up, and return to Orford, to spend his days in quiet.” Morey did not find a buyer, and as he was then in his late 60s, it made sense to stop traveling {{up and down the east}} coast and call <b>it</b> <b>quits.</b>|$|E

25|$|Following the season, Tom Renney {{replaced}} Quinn as the Oilers head coach. The {{one advantage}} {{to such a}} bad season was that the Oilers {{were able to make}} the first pick in the 2010 NHL Entry Draft. The Oilers selected two-time Stafford Smythe Memorial Trophy winner Taylor Hall, from the Windsor Spitfires with their pick. They used the off-season to begin the rebuild of the club around their young talent. Patrick O'Sullivan was traded to Phoenix, in exchange for Jim Vandermeer, Robert Nilsson was bought out of his contract and Oilers captain Ethan Moreau was placed on waivers and claimed by the Columbus Blue Jackets. Along with these players, several others were allowed to enter free agency including Mike Comrie, Marc-Antoine Pouliot and Ryan Potulny. Also during the off-season, radio announcer Rod Phillips announced his retirement. Phillips had been the Oilers' play-by-play announcer since 1973–74. Phillips would call ten specific games in 2010–11 before calling <b>it</b> <b>quits.</b> The 2010–11 Oilers season would be documented in the series Oil Change.|$|E
500|$|Because Never Say Never Again {{is not an}} Eon-produced film, it has {{not been}} {{included}} in a number of subsequent reviews. Norman Wilner of MSN said that 1967's Casino Royale and Never Say Never Again [...] "exist outside the 'official' continuity, [...] are excluded from this list, just as they're absent from MGM's megabox. But take my word for it; they're both pretty awful". Of the more recent reviews, opinion on Never Say Never Again is still mixed: film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes lists the film with a 63% rating from 46 reviews. The score is still more positive than some of the Eon films, with Rotten Tomatoes ranking Never Say Never Again 16th among all Bond films in 2008. Empire gives the film three of a possible five stars, observing that [...] "Connery was perhaps wise to call <b>it</b> <b>quits</b> the first time round". IGN gave Never Say Never Again a score of 5 out of 10, claiming that the film [...] "is more miss than hit". The review also thought that the film was [...] "marred with too many clunky exposition scenes and not enough moments of Bond being Bond".|$|E
