40|$|The {{main goal}} of ultrarelativistic heavy-ion {{collisions}} {{is the study}} of the properties of the matter at very high temperatures and energy densities. Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) predicts in these conditions the existence of a new phase of the matter whose components are deconfined in a Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). Heavy quarks (charm e bottom) are produced in the first stages of the collisions, before to interact with the medium. Therefore, the measurement of the quarkonia (cc and bb mesons) is of particular interest {{for the study of the}} QGP: their dissociation mainly due to the colour screening is sensible to the initial temperature of the medium. Previous measurements at the SPS and RHIC allowed to understand some characteristics of the system produced, but they also opened many questions. With an energy 14 times higher than RHIC, the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) at CERN opened a new era for the study of the QGP properties. ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is the LHC experiment fully dedicated to the study of the Quark-Gluon Plasma produced in Pb-Pb collisions at an energy of 2. 76 TeV per nucleon. The experiment also participates to the proton-proton data taking in order to obtain the fundamental reference for the study of ion-ion and proton-ion collisions and for testing the predictions at very small Bjorken-x values of the perturbative QCD. Quarkonia, D and B mesons and light vector mesons are measured at forward rapidity by a Muon Spectrometer exploiting their (di) muonic decay. This detector is composed of a <b>front</b> <b>absorber,</b> a dipole magnet, five stations of tracking (Muon Tracking) and two stations of trigger (Muon Trigger). The work presented in this thesis has been carried out from 2011 to 2013 during the first period of data taking of ALICE. After a detailed introduction of the heavy-ion physics and a description of the experimental setup, the performance of the Muon Trigger in Pb-Pb collisions are shown. A particular attention is devoted to the stability of the detector during the time and to the trigger effectiveness. Moreover, the cluster size, corresponding to the number of adjacent strips hit by a particle, is studied as a function of different variables. The experimental results will be compared to simulations in order to obtain a good parametrization of this phenomenon. Finally, the Ç production in Pb-Pb collisions is carefully analysed and compared to that in pp collisions at the same energy. The results are then compared to the J/ψ measurements obtained by ALICE, to the CMS results and to some theoretical predictions...|$|E

40|$|Dynamic simulation, {{based on}} modeling, has a {{significant}} role {{during the process of}} vehicle development. It is especially important in the first stages of vehicle design, when relevant vehicle parameters are to be defined. Shock absorbers as executive parts of vehicle semi-active suspension systems suffer thermal loads, which may result in damage and degradation of ther characteristics. Therefore,this paper shows an attempt to analyze converting of mechanical work into heat by using the dynamic simulation method. Introduction Shock absorbers are integral elements of semi-active suspension systems for vehicles (hereinafter SASS). They directly affect the active vehicle safety. The role of shock absorbers is to absorb mechanical vibrations transferred from the road and {{to ensure the safety of}} passengers in a vehicle. The kinetic energy of vehicle vibrations transforms into mechanical work or heat in shock absorbers. In practice, in the first stage of vehicle development, the shock absorber parameters are chosen from the condition of damping vibrations of vehicles, but their thermal shock loads should be also taken into account. Motor vehicles have complex dynamic characteristics manifested by spatial movement, parameters change during operation, a number of disturbing influences, backlash, friction, hysteresis, etc. The above-mentioned dynamic phenomena, especially vibration, lead to fatigue of driver and users, reduce the life of the vehicle and its systems, etc. The main objective of the system is to reduce the reliance of the above-mentioned negative effects, improving the vehicle behavior on the road and allow the exploitation of vehicles in a wide range of service conditions. Classical systems cannot satisfiy these conditions, so there was a need to introduce new suspension systems with controlled characteristics (briefly called "semi-active", or "active" systems). Oscillatory model of vehicle The differential equations of vibratory motion of the given vehicle model  have been written using the "NEWEUL. " software package. The data input has been done in accordance with the program requirements, and 24 coordinate systems (including inertial-OI 1 I 2 I 3 global coordinate system) have been used to define the dynamic vehicle model with seven degrees of freedom. Thermal load on the shock absorbers of the semi-active suspension system Due to the relative motion between sprunged and unsprunged masses, mechanical work in the absorbers is equivalent to the amount of heat Q, J. As the heat flux is of a random size, it was assessed as appropriate to calculate the average power (flux) for each buffer separately, and the data are given in Table 1 Table 1 Medium heat flux during a movement of  20, s Medium flux, W <b>Front</b> left <b>absorber</b> <b>Front</b> right <b>absorber</b> Rear left absorber Rear right absorber Speed 30,m/s, Mass 100 % 2. 330434 E- 006   5. 569178 E- 006 5. 358273 E- 006 2. 944404 E- 006 Speed  5, m/s Mass 100 % 2. 435122 E- 006   5. 673833 E- 006 5. 477176 E- 006 2. 968751 E- 006 Mass 75 %, Speed 5, m/s 2. 431798 E- 006   4. 518553 E- 006 4. 263119 E- 006 2. 748116 E- 006 For  illustration, Fig. 1 shows the work converted to heat amount in the  shock absorbers of the semi-active suspension system, for a vehicle speed of  5 m/s. The analysis of the heat amount data for a speed of 5 and 30, m/s,for an illustrative example of a speed of 5, m / s, given in Fig. 1 shows that the amount of heat production increases with the covered distance (time). If the vehicle speed increases, the amount of heat decreases. The example in  Fig. 2 shows the effect of the vehicle load on the heat amount generated in the semi-active suspension system absorbers. Namely, the figure shows mechanical work (converted into heat) in the shock absorbers of a partially loaded vehicle (75 %) while moving at a speed of 5, m / s. It can be determined that the reduced load on a vehicle leads to reduced thermal shock loading of vehicles, which is in accordance with heat flux. Conclusion Based on the study,the following can be concluded: Models of vehicles with semi-active suspension systems can be used for calculating thermal load on the suspension, speed increase during vehicle movement along the path of identical properties, decreases the production of heat in shock absorbers, and increase in load of the vehicle leads to the increase in the production of heat in shock absorbers. <br /...|$|R

50|$|Historically, {{the first}} mass {{production}} car with {{front to rear}} mechanical interconnected suspension was the 1948 Citroën 2CV. The suspension of the 2CV was extremely soft—the longitudinal link was making pitch softer instead of making roll stiffer. It relied on extreme antidive and antisquat geometries to compensate for that. This redunded into a softer axle crossing stiffness that anti-roll bars would have otherwise compromised. The leading arm / trailing arm swinging arm, fore-aft linked suspension system together with inboard front brakes had a much smaller unsprung weight than existing coil spring or leaf designs. The interconnection transmitted some of the force deflecting a front wheel up over a bump, to push the rear wheel down on the same side. When the rear wheel met that bump a moment later, it did the same in reverse, keeping the car level front to rear. The 2CV had a design brief {{to be able to}} be driven at speed over a ploughed field. It originally featured friction dampers and tuned mass dampers.

At design luminosity approximately 2 x 103 bunch crossings will suffice for a 1 percent luminosity measurement. In this paper we report the first experimental results of the ionization chamber and analog electronics. Single 450 GeV protons from the SPS at CERN are used to simulate the hadronic/electromagnetic showers produced by the forward collision products from the interaction regions of the LHC...|$|R
40|$|The {{layout of}} the CBM muon {{detection}} system has been improved and optimized in 2007 with respect to background suppression and a more realistic detector response. The modifications include: • compact absorber system {{in order to reduce}} the number of muons from weak pion decays; • realistic detector segmentation according to an occupancy of 5 %; • additional shielding {{in order to reduce the}} background of secondary electrons produced in the beam pipe; • additional ToF detector to suppress the background due to punch-through kaons and protons. The present design of the muon detection system consists of several hadron absorber layers (iron with variable thickness) and 15 - 18 tracking detectors based on GEM technology. For the measurement of muons from low mass vector mesons (ρ, ω, φ) the total iron absorber thickness is 125 cm (corresponding 7. 5 λI) whereas for muons from charmonia 1 m of iron is added (corresponding total thickness of 13. 4 λI). For Au+Au collisions at 25 AGeV about 0. 3 background tracks per event are reconstructed. These background tracks consist of muons (60 %), kaons (25 %), pions (7 %), protons (3 %), and ghosts (5 %). About 80 % of the muons originate from weak pion decays which happen inside the absorber, 20 % of the muons originate from weak pion decays in <b>front</b> of the <b>absorbers.</b> These numbers refer to the iron absorber of 125 cm thickness...|$|R
