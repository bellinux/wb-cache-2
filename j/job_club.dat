40|$|Over {{the past}} several decades, job search support groups, {{commonly}} referred to as “job clubs,” have evolved into one of several important activities used by the public workforce system and faith- and community-based organizations to enhance worker readiness and employability, as well as to provide ongoing support to unemployed and underemployed individuals as they search for jobs. The U. S. Department of Labor 2 ̆ 7 s (DOL) Chief Evaluation Office (CEO) contracted in September 2012 with Capital Research Corporation, Inc. and George Washington University to conduct an assessment of <b>job</b> <b>clubs</b> sponsored by faith-based and community-based organizations (FBOs/CBOs). The overall purpose of this evaluation effort was to systematically describe the key characteristics of <b>job</b> <b>clubs</b> being offered by a range of faith- and community- based organizations, document how they differ from and are similar to the <b>job</b> <b>clubs</b> operated by publicly-funded workforce agencies (such as at American Job Centers [AJCs]), and identify potential approaches that might be used for more rigorous formal evaluation of impacts and effectiveness. Findings from the telephone interviews with stakeholders and in-person interviews with facilitators during the site visits indicate that <b>job</b> <b>clubs</b> operated by FBOs, CBOs and public workforce agencies are alike in many ways, with all of them emphasizing the critical importance of: (1) networking during the job search; (2) offering ongoing peer support and sharing of similar experiences among participants; and (3) providing instruction and guidance on the basics of the job search process (e. g., elevator pitches, resume development, job interview practice). Noteworthy differences between the FBO/CBO <b>job</b> <b>clubs</b> and those operated by public workforce agencies are related to staffing patterns and available resources for program operations and services. While public workforce agency <b>job</b> <b>clubs</b> are led by paid professional staff, supported by the full complement of workshops, activities, and other services typically available through AJCs/One-Stop Centers, FBO/CBO <b>job</b> <b>clubs,</b> in most cases, operate with limited budgets or no funding whatsoever. Additionally, compared with public sector agencies, FBOs/CBOs typically collect {{little in the way of}} participant-level data, such as participant identifiers, demographic characteristics, service receipt, or outcomes. Finally, although this report suggests several approaches to future rigorous experimental/non-experimental and process/implementation evaluation of FBO/CBO-sponsored <b>job</b> <b>clubs,</b> there are likely to be formidable challenges to implementation of rigorous evaluation methods because these <b>job</b> <b>clubs</b> rarely collect identifying information on participants, such as Social Security numbers, and are generally opposed to random assignment for their programs...|$|R

One insight from his research with his colleagues was that people on welfare or with disabilities do not possess the family and friends networks that others have to help them with finding jobs. Azrin created The <b>Job</b> <b>Club</b> Counselor’s Manual (1981) which showed how to employ a system utilizing {{a small group of people}} who assisted each other in their job search by having the leader provide job search information and using positive behavioral leadership by recording member’s positive actions such as number of employer contacts made, applications submitted, and interviews obtained. Participants take ownership of the quest as they share information and encourage each other.

30|$|Replications of {{workforce}} {{programs have}} proven {{a valuable tool}} in developing workforce policy. In several cases, the original findings were not sustained and the interventions have been discontinued. (However, sometimes the lack of significant outcomes results {{from a lack of}} fidelity in the replications.) In other instances, such as for <b>job</b> <b>clubs</b> and <b>job</b> search experiments, the replications have demonstrated that a particular type of intervention is worthwhile and the standard mix of services for job seekers has been changed.|$|R

30|$|When {{evaluating}} a pilot or demonstration program, {{there are}} risks from drawing inferences from a single test. This paper reviews the experiences of replication efforts from demonstrations using randomized controlled trials in the initial evaluation and the replications. Although replications of promising programs are primarily gathered to increase sample size, replications are also used to learn if the intervention is successful for other target groups and geographic locations, and to vary some of the intervention’s features. In many cases, replications fail {{to achieve the same}} success as the original evaluation, and the paper reviews reasons that have been suggested for such failures. The paper reviews what has been learned from replications where random assignment was used in six instances: income maintenance experiments, unemployment insurance bonus experiments, the Center for Employment Training program, <b>job</b> <b>clubs,</b> <b>job</b> search experiments, and the Quantum Opportunity Program. The paper concludes by summarizing lessons learned from the review and areas where more research is needed.|$|R

By July 2006 the college had reached its fund raising target of £3.2 million and a further £370,000 for equipment and technology. In May 2004 the official ground breaking ceremony took place performed by HRH Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex. Just as his mother, the Queen, had laid the foundation stone for the college in 1949, Prince Edward carried out the unveiling of the foundation stone for the new centre almost 60 years later. The buildings Architects were Patel Taylor of London. The main construction contract was given to a local company Clegg Construction of Lace Market in Nottingham. Work commenced in May 2005 and the finished building was handed over in June 2006. The new building has ten teaching spaces.
