40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the variables hypothesized to influence the outcome of prereferral <b>intervention</b> <b>teams</b> operating in public schools. Specifically, it was {{the purpose of this study}} to identify significant predictors of prereferral <b>intervention</b> <b>team</b> outcome when assessed on the basis of team problem solving skills. Secondarily, this study was intended to derive a descriptive analysis of the organization and operation of prereferral <b>intervention</b> <b>teams.</b> Subjects included 351 individuals (members n = 267, leaders n = 84) comprising 84 prereferral <b>intervention</b> <b>teams.</b> Each subject completed the Prereferral <b>Intervention</b> <b>Team</b> Survey, a self-report instrument comprised of items measuring the variables (e. g., organizational climate, team structure, implementation procedures, consultant skills and training) hypothesized to influence team effectiveness. At a scheduled prereferral <b>intervention</b> <b>team</b> meeting, the entire team membership was asked to read a vignette describing a fictitious student exhibiting behavior problems and then, to address the case as if it were a referral being presented to their team. ^ Descriptive analyses of prereferral <b>intervention</b> <b>teams</b> were conducted relative to: (a) demographic characteristics of teams and team members, (b) team structure and composition, (c) team meetings, (d) team training, and (e) resources available to support team process. In addition, factor analyses were conducted for the purpose of both reducing the number of and identifying common factors from among the items on the Prereferral <b>Intervention</b> <b>Team</b> Surveys. Results generated a six factor solution for the team member sample and eight factors for the team leader sample; both were consistent with the constructs hypothesized to predict team effectiveness. Stepwise multiple regression procedures were performed with factors for team member, team leaders, and team average samples considered separately, as independent variables and prereferral <b>intervention</b> <b>team</b> problem solving skills as the dependent variable. Results failed to identify any of the derived variables as significant predictors of team effectiveness (i. e., problem solving skill). Theoretical and practical implications of these findings were discussed. Most importantly, results from this study call into question many prevailing beliefs regarding the variables that influence prereferral <b>intervention</b> <b>team</b> effectiveness. Limitations of the study and suggestions for future research were discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Early <b>intervention</b> <b>teams</b> {{attempt to}} improve outcome in {{schizophrenia}} through earlier detection {{and the provision}} of phase-specific treatments. Whilst the number of early <b>intervention</b> <b>teams</b> is growing, {{there is a lack of}} clarity over their essential structural and functional elements. Methods A 'Delphi' exercise was carried out to identify how far there was consensus on the essential elements of early <b>intervention</b> <b>teams</b> in a group of 21 UK expert clinicians. Using published guidelines, an initial list was constructed containing 151 elements from ten categories of team structure and function. Results Overall there was expert consensus on the importance of 136 (90 %) of these elements. Of the items on which there was consensus, 106 (70. 2 %) were rated essential, meaning that in their absence the functioning of the team would be severely impaired. Conclusion This degree of consensus over essential elements suggests that it is reasonable to define a model for UK early <b>intervention</b> <b>teams,</b> from which a measure of fidelity could be derived. </p...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine Behavioral <b>Intervention</b> <b>Teams</b> from the {{perspective}} of twelve team members at four regional universities in Oklahoma. This study strengthened the knowledge base regarding team-member perceptions of Behavioral <b>Intervention</b> <b>Team</b> effectiveness, functioning, resources, needs, state factors, and campus impacts, and added qualitative data to the existing body of literature. Behavioral <b>Intervention</b> <b>Teams</b> were designed to be a tool for preventing campus violence and addressing behaviors of concern through information gathering, analysis, and intervention. While it may never be known how many acts of violence, suicides, or other student issues have been prevented or ameliorated by these teams, this research allowed for a better understanding of team functioning, team member experiences, and of the value of having these teams on college campuses. This research may be used by teams, administrators, and other decision makers to assist in maximizing student success, safety, and retention...|$|R

MethodsA paired cross-sectional birth observation study was conducted with a convenience sample of 18 clinics (nine pairs of intervention and control clinics) from June 28 to August 7, 2013. Outcomes included implementation of practices known to decrease maternal and/or neonatal mortality and improve patient care. ResultsOverall, 25 and 17 births occurred in intervention and control clinics, respectively. Active management of the third stage of labor was appropriately performed by 20 (83 %) of 24 <b>intervention</b> <b>teams</b> versus 7 (50 %) of 14 control teams (P= 0. 015). <b>Intervention</b> <b>teams</b> implemented more practices to decrease neonatal mortality than did control teams (P< 0. 001). <b>Intervention</b> <b>teams</b> ensured patient privacy in 23 (92 %) of 25 births versus 11 (65 %) of 17 births for control teams (P= 0. 014). All 15 applicable <b>intervention</b> <b>teams</b> kept patients informed versus 6 (55 %) of 11 control teams (P= 0. 001). Differences were also noted in teamwork; in particular, skill-based tools were used more often at intervention sites than control sites (P= 0. 012). ConclusionUse of PRONTO enhanced non-emergency delivery care by increasing evidence-based practice, patient-centered care, and teamwork...|$|R
