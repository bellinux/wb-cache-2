40|$|A {{successful}} scaffold {{for use in}} tendon {{tissue engineering}} requires a high affinity for living organisms {{and the ability to}} maintain its mechanical strength until maturation of the regenerated tissue. We compared two types of poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) scaffolds for use in tendon regeneration, a plain-woven PLLA fabric (fabric P) with a smooth surface only and a double layered PLLA fabric (fabric D) with a smooth surface {{on one side and a}} rough (pile-finished) surface on the other side. These two types of fabric were implanted into the back muscles of rabbits and evaluated at three and six weeks after implantation. Histological examination showed collagen tissues were highly regenerated on the rough surface of fabric D. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>liner</b> cell attachment was seen in the smooth surface of fabric P and fabric D. The total DNA amount was significantly higher in fabric D. Additionally, mechanical examination showed fabric P had lost its mechanical strength by six weeks after implantation, while the strength of fabric D was maintained. Fabric D had more cell migration on one side and less cell adhesion on the other side and maintained its initial strength. Thus, a novel form of double-layered PLLA fabric has the potential to be used as a scaffold in tendon regeneration...|$|E

40|$|Our {{analysis}} on the two magnitude-limited samples of LINERs suggests a correlation between L FIR/L B or f(25 µm) /f(60 µm), and Hubble-type index at> 99. 99 % significance level. As L FIR/L B and f(25 µm) /f(60 µm) are considered as the indicators of star-formation activity and AGN activity, respectively, our result suggests that LINERs with higher AGN activity may have a lower star-formation contribution. The ones with highest AGN activity and lowest star-formation contributions are ellipticals. All well-studied LINER 1 s belong to this group. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>LINERs</b> with higher star-formation activity present lower AGN contributions. We find all well-studied LINER 2 s in this parameter space. Most of LINERs having inner ring structures belong to this group. Statistics with other indicators of starformation or AGN activity (nulear mass-to-light ratio at H band, and the ratio of X-ray-to-UV power) provide further evidence for such a trend. We have seen that along with the evolution of galaxies from late-type spirals to early-type ones, and up to ellipticals, the intensity of AGN activity increases with decreasing star-formation contributions, The above analyses may suggest a possible connection between the host galaxies and nuclear activities, and it might also indicate a possible evolutionary connection between AGN and starburst in LINERs...|$|R
50|$|An EFP, on {{the other}} <b>hand,</b> has a <b>liner</b> face {{in the shape of}} a shallow dish. The force of the blast moulds the liner into any of a number of shapes, {{depending}} on the shape of the plate and how the explosive is detonated. Some sophisticated EFP warheads have multiple detonators that can be fired in different arrangements causing different types of waveform in the explosive, resulting in either a long-rod penetrator, an aerodynamic slug projectile, or multiple high-velocity fragments. A less sophisticated approach for changing the formation of an EFP is the use of wire-mesh in front of the liner: with the mesh in place the liner fragments into multiple penetrators.|$|R

Although the album version {{was just over}} seven minutes long, it was widely requested for radio play, so a single version was edited to under three minutes with nearly all the instrumental break removed for airplay on AM radio. Manzarek played the song's bass line {{with his left hand}} on a Fender Rhodes Piano Bass, while performing the other keyboard parts on a Vox Continental using his right <b>hand.</b> In the <b>liner</b> notes to the 1997 Doors retrospective Box Set, Krieger claims that it was Morrison who encouraged the others to write songs when they realized they did not have enough original material.|$|R

[...] "Knock Me Down" [...] reached number six on the U.S. Modern Rock Tracks whereas [...] "Higher Ground" [...] charted at number eleven; {{the latter of}} the two {{ultimately}} {{proved to be more}} successful, however, by influencing foreign charts at number fifty-four in the UK and forty-five in Australia and France. While [...] "Taste the Pain" [...] did not chart in the U.S., the single reached number twenty-six in the UK—the group's first Top 40 single in the region. The success the Red Hot Chili Peppers achieved with Mother's Milk was something the group had been working towards since the release of their debut album; Apter notes, [...] "After five hard years, several departures, sackings and one tragic death, the Peppers were now much more than a hometown sensation." [...] The band had played numerous concerts before the album's release and aired new songs weekly to generate interest in it. Mother's Milk was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in late March 1990—it is now certified platinum—and was the first Chili Peppers album to ship in excess of 500,000 units. In 2003 the album was re-released through EMI; all tracks were completely remastered and an additional six songs were included as well as <b>hand</b> written <b>liner</b> notes from Flea.|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 258 bovine-associated Staphylococcus aureus {{isolates}} from the United States, Chile, and the United Kingdom, plus the reference isolate S. aureus Newbould 305 (NCIMB 702892), {{were analyzed by}} multilocus sequence typing (MLST).

The results demonstrated that MLST is suitable for the differentiation of bovine S. aureus isolates from various sites (milk, teat skin, milking machine unit <b>liners,</b> <b>hands,</b> and bedding) and countries. The theory of the host specificity of S. aureus is supported by the detection of a previously undescribed clonal complex that comprised 87. 4 % of the isolates studied, with representatives from all geographic locations investigated. This suggests that a single clonal group has achieved a widespread distribution and is responsible for the majority of infections. Some sequence types (STs; ST 25, ST 115, ST 124, and ST 126) demonstrated site specificity, as they were significantly (P &# 60; 0. 05) associated with milk or teat skin...|$|R
40|$|The liner of a {{gas turbine}} {{combustor}} is a very flexible structure that is exposed to the pressure oscillations {{that occur in the}} combustor. These pressure oscillations can be of very high amplitude due to thermoacoustic instability, when the fluctuations of the rate of heat release and the acoustic pressure waves amplify each other. The liner structure is a dynamic mechanical system that vibrates at its eigenfrequencies and at the frequencies by which it is forced by the pressure oscillations to which it is exposed. On the other <b>hand</b> the <b>liner</b> vibrations force a displacement of the flue gas near the wall in the combustor. The displacement is very small but this acts like a distributed acoustic source which is proportional to the liner wall acceleration. Hence liner and combustor are a coupled elasto-acoustic system. When this is exposed to a limit cycle oscillation the liner may fail due to fatigue. In this paper the method and the results will be presented of the partitioned simulation of the coupled acousto-elastic system composed of the liner and the flue gas domain in the combustor. The partitioned simulation uses separate solvers for the flow domain and the structural domain, that operate in a coupled way. In this work 2 -way fluid structure interaction is studied for the case of a model combustor for the operating conditions 40 - 60 kW with equivalence ratio of 0. 625. This is done in the framework of the LIMOUSINE project. Computational fluid dynamics analysis is performed to obtain the thermal loading of the combustor liner and finite element analysis renders the temperature, stress distribution and deformation in the liner. The software used is ANSY...|$|R
40|$|Globalization, liberalization, {{competition}} and spatial interaction are significant factors affecting {{the transformation of}} manufacturing industries worldwide. In the transportation and logistics industry, however, cooperation is becoming even more critical than competition in determining firms’ efficiency. Cooperation has always characterized the liner sector in which strategic alliances, mergers and acquisitions have generated twin effects: notable increases in ship size and falls in freight rates. Meanwhile, the stevedoring industry is undergoing privatizationdriven consolidation {{and the emergence of}} global pure terminal operators. This article focuses on vertical integration between global carriers and terminal operators. We address the following key current issues:. dedicated terminals as a strategy for cutting costs and controlling integrated transport chains;. the struggle for supply chain control, involving global carriers versus global terminal operators, driven by financial power and technical and managerial capability. We close analysing one of the core problems of the market, namely the evolving role of the dedicated terminals. For the pure stevedores they represent an opportunity to secure a cargo, while in the <b>hands</b> of the <b>liners</b> they enable cost stability and the possibility to put pressure on pure terminal operators...|$|R

40|$|A {{conventional}} shaped charge comprises a conical {{metal liner}} projecting a hyper velocity jet of metal that {{is able to}} penetrate to great depths into steel armour. However, misalignment problems exist in tandem with jet break up and spewing particles that greatly diminish its penetration power. An EFP, on the other <b>hand,</b> has a <b>liner</b> {{in the shape of}} a geometrical recess. The force of the blast molds the liner into a number of configurations, depending on the geometry and the explosive detonation characteristics. This paper presents comparative parametric numerical simulations of materials used as liners in the explosively formed projectiles EFPs. Numerical simulations are carried out using AUTODYN 2 D hydrocode to study effects of liner’s materials on the shape, velocity, traveled distance, time, pressure, internal energy, temperature, yield stress, divergence or stability, density, compression, and length to diameter (L/D) ratio of EFPs. These parameters are estimated at the instants of maximum as well as at stable velocities. The parametric study reveals that aluminum has maximum velocity in shortest time among the liner materials. From this reason, it was concluded effective standoff was greater for aluminum than more denser metals. Maximum velocity and traveled distance of Tantalum EFP is found to be minimum which may be due to low thermal softening exponent and larger hardening exponent. The simulated yield stress and pressure developed in the Fe EFP reaches at maximum. The L/D ratio for Copper is found to be maximum which supports maximum penetration. From the stability point of view, 1006 MS is found to be the most reliable liner material due to minimum divergence. Generally all liner materials hav...|$|R
