5|$|Gaudí's {{personal}} appearance—Nordic features, blond <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> eyes—changed radically {{over the}} course of time. As a young man, he dressed like a dandy in costly suits, sporting well-groomed hair and beard, indulging gourmet taste, making frequent visits to the theatre and the opera and visiting his project sites in a horse carriage. The older Gaudí ate frugally, dressed in old, worn-out suits, and neglected his appearance to the extent that sometimes he was taken for a beggar, such as after the accident that caused his death.|$|E

25|$|By the 1880s {{a number}} of {{linguists}} and anthropologists argued that the Aryans themselves had originated somewhere in northern Europe. Theodor Poesche proposed that the Aryans originated in the vast Rokitno, or Pinsk Marshes, then in the Russian Empire, now covering much of {{the southern part of}} Belarus and the north-west of the Ukraine, but it was Karl Penka who popularised the idea that the Aryans had emerged in Scandinavia and could be identified by the distinctive Nordic characteristics of blond <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> eyes.|$|E
25|$|Lantos joined Wallenberg's network; {{his fair}} <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> eyes, which to the Nazis were {{physical}} signs of Aryanism, {{enabled him to}} serve as a courier and deliver food and medicine to Jews living in other safe houses. In January 1945, less than a year later, Russian military forces fought door-to-door battles and liberated Hungary from Nazi occupation. However, Lantos, then 17, returned home only to discover that his mother and other family members had all been killed by the Germans, along with 440,000 other Hungarian Jews, during the preceding 10 months of their occupation.|$|E

25|$|Turtledove depicts his {{nations as}} being {{analogous}} to real European nations, including {{as far as}} possible actual linguistic relationships. For example, the Derlavaian analogs of the Germanic nations are the Algarvic nations of Algarve, Sibiu, and Lagoas, but to confuse things somewhat, each uses names drawn from a different Romance language. In addition, {{the vast majority of the}} individuals belonging to each language group share the same hair and eye color; Algarvic peoples have red hair and green eyes, Kaunian peoples have blond <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> eyes, and the Unkerlantic peoples and most others have dark hair and eyes.|$|E
25|$|From {{the early}} 17th {{century to the}} middle 18th century, European colonists {{reported}} encounters with gray-eyed American Indians who claimed descent from the colonists (although at least one, {{a story of a}} Welsh priest who met a Doeg warrior who spoke the Welsh language, {{is likely to be a}} hoax). Records from French Huguenots who settled along the Tar River in 1696 tell of meeting Tuscaroras with blond <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> eyes not long after their arrival. As Jamestown was the nearest English settlement, and they had no record of being attacked by Tuscarora, the likelihood that the origin of those fair-skinned natives was the Lost Colony is high.|$|E
