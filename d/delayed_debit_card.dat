40|$|This paper investigates <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> {{usage and}} its impact on {{household}} debts, using the 2004 Survey of Consumer Finances. By conducting simultaneous equation modeling, we examine how <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> users are different from non-users, and whether <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> usage influences household debt. We find that, after controlling for selection bias, the use of <b>debit</b> <b>cards</b> is negatively associated with household debt. We also find that those with revolving debt tendencies (i. e., carrying outstanding balances on credit cards) are more likely to use <b>debit</b> <b>cards</b> than those without a revolving debt tendency. We conclude that <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> usage discourages the accumulation of household debt rather than that <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> users tend to be financially conscientious. © 2007 Academy of Financial Services.

Questionnaires were used for data collection by purposive sampling and equally distributed to 303 consumers who held at least 1 <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> and used it 3 months before the study. The collected data was analyzed using the descriptive statistics; frequency and percentage, and the inferential statistics; Pearson chi-square at the. 05 level of statistics significance.             This research found that the demographic characters of the consumers were female, between 21 - 30 years old, and held bachelor degree. Two-third of consumers were students, government and company officers. More {{than half of them}} earned 5, 001 – 15, 000 baht per month. The research also found that the consumers had only 1 <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> and most of them were Visa type. Most of their <b>debit</b> <b>cards</b> were issued by Bangkok Bank. They owned <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> for 1 - 2 years. Ratio of withdraw to payment is 40 : 60. They used <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> for withdrawing 2 - 3 times a month and 1, 001 – 3, 000 baht each time. They used <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> for expense 2 - 3 times a month and 500 – 1, 000 baht each time.

This brief analyzes the potential effects of an increase in <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> fees or in bank account fees by using the results of the 2008 and 2009 Survey of Consumer Payment Choice (SCPC). The main findings are that: 1) consumers with the least amount of education (less than a high school diploma), the lowest annual income (below $ 25, 000), and the youngest age (under 25 years) consider cost {{to be the most important}} payment characteristic. It is probable that these consumers would be most affected by an increase in <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> fees, and most likely to change their payment behavior in response; 2) the cost of debit seems to be an important factor affecting consumer payment decisions: consumers who rated the cost of <b>debit</b> <b>cards</b> as low relative to the cost of other payment methods were significantly more likely to adopt and to use debit cards; 3) credit cards were viewed as the closest substitute for <b>debit</b> <b>cards.</b> If the cost of using <b>debit</b> <b>cards</b> rises, consumers are more likely to substitute credit cards for some of their <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> transactions; 4) consumer reaction depends on the type of fee increases: an increase in the cost of <b>debit</b> <b>cards</b> specifically is expected to have a greater effect on <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> use than a broader increase in the cost of maintaining bank accounts; and 5) an increase in the one-time cost of <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> setup could lead to a substantial decrease in the rate of <b>debit</b> adoption. <b>Debit</b> <b>cards...</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{exclusion}} {{restrictions that}} identify Eq. (1)—where the acquirer change in transaction volume per POS terminal with <b>debit</b> <b>cards</b> (ACTVPOS) is the dependent variable—are the merchant <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> discount fee and the <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> annual fee—which {{are expected to}} be negatively related to merchant transaction volumes- and an interaction term of the merchant acceptance and the total number of <b>debit</b> <b>cards</b> in that network. This interaction captures the network effects as ACTVPOS is expected to increase when the number of merchants served by the acquirer increases or the number of total <b>debit</b> <b>cards</b> increases. The exclusion restriction for ICTVDC corresponds to the annual <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> fee and the network effects shown by the interaction term of the merchant acceptance in the network and the number of cards issued by the bank. It {{is important to note that}} only 6  % of banks in the sample charge an annual fee for <b>debit</b> <b>cards.</b> 6 Even so, we exploit such variation to infer the impact of <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> fees on acquirer (Eq.  1) and issuer (Eq.  2) volumes. As for Eq. (3) the exclusion restrictions also include a price for that side of the market—the <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> ATM fees- and the interaction of the number of <b>debit</b> <b>cards</b> in the network and the number of ATMs by issuer, which is expected to show ATM network effects.|$|R

From a policy point of view, the use of <b>debit</b> <b>cards</b> has been identified as one of the main examples of the transition from paper-based to electronic-based systems. 18 However, ATM transactions and POS transactions have opposite effects since the use of <b>debit</b> <b>cards</b> at ATMs increases cash withdrawals while the use of <b>debit</b> <b>cards</b> at POS reduces cash holdings for purchasing purposes. In this paper, we use a unique bank-level database for Spain that allows us to identify the issuer (consumer) and acquirer (merchant) sides of the use of <b>debit</b> <b>cards</b> at POS as well as the number of <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> withdrawals at a bank.|$|R

The results show that newspaper articles that somehow make mention of the phenomenon of skimming fraud significantly affect the number of <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> payments. The direction of the effect depends {{on the type of}} skimming fraud addressed. Newspaper articles on fraud at points-of-sale (POS) and ticket machines depress the number of <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> payments.

This indicates that the temporarily created fear for using the <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> at the ATM is not automatically translated into fear for using the <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> at the POS. Instead, ATMs and POS terminals are perceived as substitutes. Although significant, all media effects found are relatively small in comparison with other factors such as calendar and holiday effects and daily rainfall. Moreover, the effects only last for one day, with consumers immediately reverting back to their regular payment behaviour. This corresponds to earlier results found in other research fields and suggests that consumers 2 ̆ 019 confidence in the <b>debit</b> <b>card</b> is relatively sturdy and not easily affected.
