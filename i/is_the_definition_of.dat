5|$|One of {{the main}} sources of {{confusion}} and ambiguity in the creation–evolution debate <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> evolution itself. In the context of biology, evolution is genetic changes in populations of organisms over successive generations. The word also {{has a number of}} different meanings in different fields, from evolutionary computation to molecular evolution to sociocultural evolution to stellar and galactic evolution. When biological evolution is conflated with other evolutionary processes, this can cause errors such as the claim that modern evolutionary theory says anything about abiogenesis or the Big Bang.|$|E

25|$|In 1908, Hermann Minkowski—once one of {{the math}} professors of a young Einstein in Zurich—presented a {{geometric}} interpretation of special relativity that fused time and the three spatial dimensions of space into a single four-dimensional continuum now known as Minkowski space. A key feature of this interpretation <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> a spacetime interval that combines distance and time.

500|$|A {{first point}} of Euler’s musical theory <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> [...] "genres", i.e. of {{possible}} {{divisions of the}} octave using the prime numbers 3 and 5. Euler describes 18 such genres, with the general definition 2mA, where A is the [...] "exponent" [...] of the genre (i.e. {{the sum of the}} exponents of 3 and 5) and 2m (where [...] "m is an indefinite number, small or large, so long as the sounds are perceptible"), expresses that the relation holds independently of the number of octaves concerned. The first genre, with A = 1, is the octave itself (or its duplicates); the second genre, 2m.3, is the octave divided by the fifth (fifth + fourth, C–G–C); the third genre is 2m.5, major third + minor sixth (C–E–C); the fourth is 2m.32, two fourths and a tone (C–F–B–C); the fifth is 2m.3.5 (C–E–G–B–C); etc. Genres 12 (2m.33.5), 13 (2m.32.52) and 14 (2m.3.53) are corrected versions of the diatonic, chromatic and enharmonic, respectively, of the Ancients. Genre 18 (2m.33.52) is the [...] "diatonico-chromatic", [...] "used generally in all compositions", and which turns out to be identical with the system described by Johann Mattheson. Euler later envisaged the possibility of describing genres including the prime number 7.|$|E

Whedon went on to write a five page treatment of his plan for the film, and created the tagline [...] "Avengers: Some Assembly Required", riffing on the [...] "Avengers Assemble" [...] slogan from the comic books. Marvel quickly began working to sign Whedon to write and direct, only stipulating that he include the Avengers against Loki, a battle among the heroes in the middle, a battle against the villains at the end, and he get the movie done for its May 2012 release. On the hiring, Arad stated: [...] "My personal opinion is that Joss will do a fantastic job. He loves these characters and is a fantastic writer... It's {{part of his life}} so you know he is going to protect it... I expect someone like him is going to make the script even better". Feige added, [...] "I've known Joss for many years. We were looking for the right thing and he came in and met on it... we want to find a director that’s on the verge of doing something great, as we think Joss is."
