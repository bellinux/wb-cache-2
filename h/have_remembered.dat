5|$|Beginning in 1877, {{residents}} of Ridgefield <b>have</b> <b>remembered</b> {{the battle with}} some form of anniversary ceremony every twenty-five years. A full day tribute was hosted at former Connecticut Governor Phineas C. Lounsbury's Town Street mansion {{in conjunction with the}} town's bicentennial celebration in 1908. The 150th anniversary affair in 1927 featured the publication of George Lounsbury Rockwell's History of Ridgefield, and the 200th anniversary was held a year early to tie in with America's bicentennial celebration in 1976. The bicentennial and 225th anniversary celebrations included re-enactments of the battle, for which portions of Town Street (now Main Street) were covered with dirt for sake of authenticity.|$|E

25|$|Gates {{consistently}} {{testified that}} he first heard on October 1, 1986, from Charles E. Allen, the national intelligence officer who was closest to the Iran initiative, that proceeds from the Iran arms sales may have been diverted to support the Contras. Other evidence proves, however, that Gates received {{a report on the}} diversion during the summer of 1986 from DDI Richard Kerr. The issue was whether the Independent Counsel could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Gates was deliberately not telling the truth when he later claimed not to <b>have</b> <b>remembered</b> any reference to the diversion before meeting with Allen in October.|$|E

Yet {{he did not know}} where he was--what part of France--how far north or south on the front line--in what sector. Could not that account for the sense of feeling lost? ...|$|R

25|$|The defense {{strategy}} was to impeach {{the testimony of the}} key prosecution witnesses: Lloyd and Weichmann. It also wished to show that she was loyal to the Union, her trips to Surrattsville were of an innocent nature, and she had not been aware of Booth's plans. There were 31 witnesses who testified for the defense. George H. Calvert testified that he had pressed Surratt to pay a debt, Bennett Gwynn said Surratt had sought payment from John Nothey to satisfy the Calvert debt, and Nothey agreed that he had received a letter from Surratt for him to appear at the tavern on April 11 to pay what was owed. Several witnesses impugned Lloyd's character by testifying about his alcoholism. Several eyewitnesses said he appeared completely intoxicated on the day of Lincoln's death (April 14) and implied that he could not <b>have</b> <b>remembered</b> that day clearly. (However, Lloyd had testified that he repaired a broken spring on Surratt's wagon, which rebutted the claims.) Augustus Howell, a Confederate agent, testified that Surratt's eyesight was poor and that Weichmann was an untrustworthy witness, as he had sought to become a Confederate spy himself. (The prosecution had attempted to show that Howell was a Confederate spy and should not be trusted.) Anna Surratt testified that it was Weichmann who had brought Atzerodt into the boarding house, that the photograph of Booth was hers (given to her by her father in 1862), and that she owned photographs of Union political and military leaders. Anna denied ever overhearing any discussions of disloyal activities or ideas in the boarding house, and she said that while Booth visited the house many times, his stays were always short. Anna explained her mother's failure to recognize Powell by asserting she could not see well. Honora Fitzpatrick was called back to the stand and testified to Mary's poor eysight as well. A former servant and a former slave both said her eyesight was failing and that she had given Union soldiers food. Numerous witnesses were called {{at the end of the}} defense's case to testify to her loyalty to the Union, her deep Christian faith, and her kindness. A number of Catholic priests were called to the stand to testify about Surratt's faith, good character, and incorruptibility. Portraying Surratt as a good Christian woman incapable of committing the crimes for which she was accused was a large part of the {{defense strategy}}. During the prosecution's rebuttal, government lawyers called four witnesses (P.T. Ransford, John Ryan, Frank Stith, and James Young) to the stand, who testified as to Weichmann's unimpeachable character.|$|E

500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of April 21 the Texian army attacked Santa Anna's camp near Lynchburg Ferry. The Mexican army was taken by surprise, and the Battle of San Jacinto was essentially over after 18minutes. During the fighting, many of the Texian soldiers repeatedly cried [...] "Remember the Alamo!" [...] as they slaughtered fleeing Mexican troops. Santa Anna was captured the following day, and reportedly told Houston: [...] "That man may consider himself born to no common destiny who has conquered the Napoleon of the West. And now it remains {{for him to be}} generous to the vanquished." [...] Houston replied, [...] "You should <b>have</b> <b>remembered</b> that at the Alamo". Santa Anna's life was spared, and he was forced to order his troops out of Texas, ending Mexican control of the province and bestowing some legitimacy on the new republic.|$|E
500|$|Gwen brings Nikki {{in to see}} Jonah {{under the}} {{supervision}} of a facility staff member. [...] At first Nikki is horrified, believing it to be a cruel joke, but Jonah starts reminiscing on his childhood. [...] Nikki calms and thinks about taking Jonah home to care for him herself. However, Jonah starts screaming horribly, necessitating that everyone leave his company. In a voiceover, Gwen reveals that the scream lasts for 20 hours every day because Jonah looked into the heart of a dark star, which had the effect of driving him insane. Gwen visits Nikki a week later, who implores her not to show the island to anyone else. Nikki states {{that it would have been}} better for her to <b>have</b> <b>remembered</b> her son as he was, rather than to know of his true fate. Nikki packs up Jonah's belongings and knowing he can never return home, breaks down into sobs. [...] At home that night Gwen prepares a romantic candle-lit dinner for Rhys who, realising that she is upset, insists that Gwen shares her burden.|$|E

[...] Alyssa Rosenberg of The Atlantic agreed, calling the clip [...] "dopey ... with guys who forgot to wash the home dye out of their hair" [...] (sic) and the dancing was on-par with sci-fi film The Matrix Reloaded. However she did say that [...] "It's a high-concept understanding of the dance floor, even if it's not my preferred interpretation of that space. If love and shaking it are war, Kelly seems like she'd be a pretty decent person to have boss you around in both." [...] Meanwhile Sound Savvy said [...] "There's some nice moves and Kelly sports some sexy looks for the clip. 'Commander' has received CRAZY airplay and the reception has been overwhelmingly positive for this track. I kinda dig the video, but I would've liked more choreography." ...|$|E
500|$|Art {{historian}} Cornelius Vermeule {{deemed the}} obverse {{of the half}} dollar [...] "a halfway point between the designs on French silver pieces early in the new century and A. A. Weinman's 'Walking Liberty' for the half dollar". The fifty-cent piece bears the motto [...] "In God We Trust", as do the $50 pieces, the first commemorative coins to display it. That motto was first used on U.S. coins in 1864. In the 19th century, it was not mandatory that the motto be used, but it nevertheless appeared on most denominations of U.S. coins {{by the turn of}} the 20th century. In 1907 and 1908, there had been many objections to the motto's omission on the gold ten dollar and twenty dollar pieces designed by Augustus Saint-Gaudens. [...] In response to the public outcry, Congress in 1908 passed legislation requiring its presence on any circulating coin which had previously borne it, as both gold pieces had until 1907. [...] The wording on the Panama–Pacific pieces was left to the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury, but officials may <b>have</b> <b>remembered</b> the fracas. Swiatek and Breen suggested that those involved in creating or approving the design may have moved to head off controversy.|$|E

The kids would not have been born because Homer would <b>have</b> <b>remembered</b> to use protection before sex (apparently, Marge is confused by this).|$|E
2500|$|In June 2011, Kidman {{was cast}} in Lee Daniels' {{adaptation}} of the Pete Dexter novel, The Paperboy; she began filming on the thriller on 1 August 2011, and The Paperboy was released in 2012. In the film, she portrayed death row groupie Charlotte Bless, and performed sex scenes that she claims not to <b>have</b> <b>remembered</b> until seeing the finished film. [...] "I was like okay, so that's what I did," [...] she said. The film competed in the 2012 Cannes Film Festival, and Kidman's performance drew critical acclaim and among nominations for the SAG and the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress, gave Kidman her second Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress and her tenth nomination overall. In 2012, Kidman's audiobook recording of Virginia Woolf's To the Lighthouse was released at Audible.com. Kidman also co-starred in Park Chan-wook's Stoker (2013) to positive critical response and a Saturn Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. In April 2013 she was selected {{as a member of}} the main competition jury at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival.|$|E
2500|$|Reading the words, [...] "And I {{appeared}} to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob," [...] in [...] a Midrash taught that God thus told Moses that God longed {{for those who}} were gone and could not be replaced – the three Patriarchs. The Midrash said that God told Moses that many times, God had revealed God's Self to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as God Almighty ( [...] , El Shadai), and God had not made known to them that God's name is the Lord ( [...] , the Tetragrammaton). But still they did not criticize God's ways. To Abraham, God said in [...] "Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it, for to you will I give it," [...] yet when Abraham wanted to bury Sarah, he found no plot of ground until he had purchased one; still, he did not murmur at God's ways. God said to Isaac in [...] "Sojourn in this land [...] [...] [...] for to you, and to your seed, I will give all these lands." [...] Yet when Isaac sought water to drink, he found none; instead (as [...] reports), [...] "The herdsmen of Gerar strove with Isaac's herdsmen, saying: ‘The water is ours.'" [...] Still Isaac did not murmur at God's ways. God said to Jacob in [...] "The land on which you lie, to you will I give it, and to your seed." [...] Yet when he sought a place to pitch his tent, he found none until he purchased one for a hundred kesitah (as reported in [...] ). And still Jacob did not complain at God's ways. The Patriarchs did not ask God, as Moses did in [...] what God's name was. In contrast, at the commencement of God's commission of Moses, Moses inquired of God's name. And in [...] Moses told God, [...] "For since I came to Pharaoh [...] [...] [...] he has dealt ill with this people; neither have You delivered Your people." [...] On this account, the Midrash taught, God said in [...] "And I have also established my covenant with them," [...] the Patriarchs, to give them the land, and they never complained of God's ways. And God said in [...] "I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel," [...] because they did not complain against God. Although the Israelites of that generation did not conduct themselves righteously, yet God heard their cry on account of the covenant that God had made with the Patriarchs. Hence, it says in [...] "And I <b>have</b> <b>remembered</b> My covenant. Therefore, say to the children of Israel." [...] The Midrash taught that the word [...] "therefore" [...] ( [...] , lachein) in [...] implies an oath, as it does in [...] where God says, [...] "And therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli." [...] Thus, the Midrash taught that God swore to Moses that God would redeem the Israelites, so that Moses would have no reason to fear that the Attribute of Justice would retard their redemption.|$|E
