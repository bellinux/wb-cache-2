25|$|Most {{historians and}} medical experts {{now believe that}} Garfield {{probably}} would have survived his wound had the doctors attending him been more capable. Unfortunately for Garfield, most American doctors of the day {{did not believe in}} anti-sepsis measures or the need for cleanliness to prevent infection. Several inserted their unsterilized <b>fingers</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wound to probe for the bullet, and one doctor punctured Garfield's liver in doing so. Also, self-appointed chief physician D. Willard Bliss had supplanted Garfield's usual physician, Jedediah Hyde Baxter. Bliss and the other doctors who attended Garfield had guessed wrong about the path of the bullet in Garfield's body. They had erroneously probed rightward into Garfield's back instead of leftward, missing the location of the bullet but creating a new channel which filled with pus. The autopsy not only discovered this error but revealed pneumonia in both lungs and a body that was filled with pus due to uncontrolled septicemia.|$|E
25|$|Goya depicts Saturn feasting {{upon one}} of his sons. His child's head {{and part of the}} left arm have already been consumed. The right arm has {{probably}} been eaten too, though it could be folded in front of the body and held in place by Saturn's thumbs. The titan is on the point of taking another bite from the left arm; as he looms from the darkness, his mouth gapes and his eyes bulge whitely. The only other brightness in the picture comes from the white flesh, the red blood of the corpse, the white knuckles of Saturn as he digs his <b>fingers</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> back of the body. There is evidence that the picture may have originally portrayed the titan with a partially erect penis, but, if ever present, this addition was lost due to the deterioration of the mural over time or during the transfer to canvas; in the picture today the area around his groin is indistinct. It may even have been overpainted deliberately before the picture was put on public display.|$|E

500|$|According to {{some historians}} and medical experts, Garfield might have survived his wounds had the doctors {{attending}} him had {{at their disposal}} today's medical research, techniques, and equipment. Standard medical practice at the time dictated that priority be given to locating {{the path of the}} bullet. Several of his doctors inserted their unsterilized <b>fingers</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wound to probe for the bullet, a common practice in the 1880s. Historians agree that massive infection was a significant factor in President Garfield's demise. Biographer Peskin stated that medical malpractice did not contribute to Garfield's death; the inevitable infection and blood poisoning that would ensue from a deep bullet wound resulted in damage to multiple organs and spinal bone fragmentation. Rutkow, a professor of surgery at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, has argued that starvation also played a role. Rutkow suggests that [...] "Garfield had such a nonlethal wound. In today's world, he would have gone home in a matter of two or three days." ...|$|E

2500|$|On July 2, 1881, President James Garfield {{was shot}} by Charles J. Guiteau. One bullet was thought later to have {{possibly}} lodged near his liver but could not be found. Standard medical practice at the time called for physicians to insert their unsterilized <b>fingers</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wound to probe and locate {{the path of the}} bullet. Surgically opening abdominal cavities to repair gunshot wounds, Germ theory, and Dr. Joseph Lister's technique for [...] "antisepsis surgery" [...] using dilute carbolic acid, which had been first demonstrated in 1865, had not yet been accepted as standard practice by prevailing medical authorities. Sixteen doctors attended to Garfield and most probed the wound with their fingers or dirty instruments. Historians agree that massive infection was a significant factor in President Garfield's death.|$|E

2500|$|A no-thumb {{delivery}} involves inserting {{only two}} <b>fingers</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bowling ball, leaving the thumb {{on the outside}} of the ball, in an effort to create more revolutions and greater hook. Due to similar ball roll and revolutions to the cranker style, it is sometimes considered a variation of cranking. As the bowler does not use the opposite hand to support the ball, the wrist is often severely cupped and/or the ball is balanced on the forearm and delivered using a bent elbow throughout the shot. [...] Another variation of this delivery is to palm the ball forcing the thumb to the side of the ball while forcing the elbow to lock so as to keep the arm straight and generate a back-swing. [...] This variation leads to far greater consistency and straightens the ball out when needed. It also may require bowlers to use lighter bowling balls, resulting in less power and pin carry upon reaching the pin deck.|$|E
2500|$|It is a {{hot summer}} day. Pelléas has led Mélisande {{to one of his}} {{favourite}} spots, the [...] "Blind Men's Well". People used to believe it possessed miraculous powers to cure blindness but since the old king's eyesight started to fail, they no longer come there. Mélisande lies down on the marble rim of the well and tries to see to the bottom. Her hair loosens and falls into the water. Pelléas notices how extraordinarily long it is. He remembers that Golaud first met Mélisande beside a spring and asks if he tried to kiss her at that time but she does not answer. Mélisande plays with the ring Golaud gave her, throwing it up into the air until it slips from her <b>fingers</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> well. Pelléas tells her not to be concerned but she is not reassured. He also notes that the clock was striking twelve as the ring dropped into the well. Mélisande asks him what she should tell Golaud. He replies, [...] "the truth." ...|$|E
