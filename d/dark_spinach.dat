2500|$|It is more cost {{effective}} to prevent stone formation during a mission than {{is it to}} treat it. [...] Increased fluid intake will increase urine volume and dilute the stone-forming salts to below the upper risk levels. [...] Avoiding foods that are high in fat and high in oxalate (nuts, pepper, chocolate, rhubarb, <b>spinach,</b> <b>dark</b> green vegetables, fruits) can help reduce hyperoxaluria (excessive urinary excretion of oxalate). [...] Reducing the amount of meats and other purine-containing foods suppresses hyperuricosuria (increased amounts of uric acid in the urine).|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Study of Chlorophyll Characteristic on the Leaves As Photodetector Organic Material By Ar Rohmah M 0202017 The aim of {{research}} was studied the optically and the electrically chlorophyll on the leaves such as spinach of Amaranthus sp, morinda citrifolia and cassava leaves. Measurement of the optic is absorbance with Uv-Vis Spechtrophotometer and the electric is conductivity with two point probe methods. Absorbance of spinach {{are higher than}} the others. I-V data showed the conductivity on the <b>dark</b> of <b>spinach,</b> morinda citrifolia and cassava leaves are (3, 8133 ± 0, 0007) x 10 - 3 (Ωm) - 1, (3, 2761 ± 0, 0006) x 10 - 3 (Ωm) - 1 dan (1, 893 ± 0, 001) x 10 - 3 (Ωm) - 1, while the conductivity on the lighted of spinach, morinda citrifolia and cassava leaves are (4, 1947 ± 0, 0007) x 10 - 3 (Ωm) - 1, (3, 4061 ± 0, 0007) x 10 - 3 (Ωm) - 1 and (2, 0973 ± 0. 0006) x 10 - 3 (Ωm) - 1. The increasing of conductivity on the lighted spinach are higher than the others, are (0, 38 ± 0, 06) x 10 - 3 (Ωm) - 1. The total chlorophyll of spinach are 27 mg/l, morinda citrifolia are 22 mg/l and cassava leaves are 16 mg/l. The reducing of total chlorophyll happened by degradation of chlorophyll molecules become its generation molecules...|$|R
40|$|Site-directed {{mutagenesis}} of spinach sucrose-phosphate synthase (SPS) {{was performed}} to investigate the role of Ser 158 in the modulation of spinach leaf SPS. Tobacco plants expressing the spinach wild-type (WT), S 158 A, S 158 T and S 157 F/S 158 E SPS transgenes were produced. Expression of transgenes appeared not to reduce expression of the tobacco host SPS. SPS activity in the WT and the S 158 T SPS transgenics showed light/dark modulation, whereas the S 158 A and S 157 F/S 158 E mutants were not similarly light/dark modulated: the S 158 A mutant enzyme was not inactivated in the dark, and the S 157 F/S 158 E was not activated in the light. The inability to modulate {{the activity of the}} S 158 A mutant enzyme by protein phosphorylation was demonstrated in vitro. The WT spinach enzyme immunopurified from dark transgenic tobacco leaves had a low initial activation state, and could be activated by PP 2 A and subsequently inactivated by SPS-kinase plus ATP. Rapid purification of the S 158 A mutant enzyme from dark leaves of transgenic plants using spinach-specific monoclonal antibodies yielded enzyme that had a high initial activation state, and pre-incubation with leaf PP 2 A or ATP plus SPS-kinase (the PKIII enzyme) caused little modulation of activity. The results demonstrate the regulatory significance of Ser 158 as the major site responsible for <b>dark</b> inactivation of <b>spinach</b> SPS in vivo, and indicate that the significance of phosphorylation is the introduction of a negative charge at the Ser 158 position...|$|R
