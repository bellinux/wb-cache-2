25|$|In a <b>European</b> <b>cooperation</b> project between 2008 and 2012 in {{comparison}} 4 hospital {{waste water treatment}} facilities were developed in Switzerland, Germany, The Netherlands and Luxembourg to investigate the elimination rates of concentrated waste water with pharmaceutical “cocktails” by using different and combined advanced treatment technologies. Especially the German STP at Marienhospital Gelsenkirchen showed {{the effects of a}} combination of membranes, ozone, powdered activated carbon and sand filtration. But even a maximum of installed technologies could not eliminate 100% of all substances and especially radiocontrast agents are nearly impossible to eliminate. The investigations showed that depending on the installed technologies the treatment costs for such a hospital treatment facility may be up to 5.50 € per m2. Other studies and comparisons expect the treatment costs to increase up to 10%, mainly due to energy demand.|$|E

Today, the heritage, cultural and economic exploitation of woad is still topical. Amiens is indeed the leader of the <b>European</b> <b>cooperation</b> project [...] "beyond the blue - Woad: heritage and creation".|$|E

2500|$|In [...] {{there is}} a {{discussion}} of the <b>European</b> <b>cooperation</b> proposed by Otto Struve, namely that the Triangulations of Russia, Prussia, Belgium, France and Britain be connected so that arc along the parallel at 52°N could be measured. This large arc, of 75° of longitude, would provide a very valuable constraint on attempts to calculate the figure of the Earth. The Ordnance Survey had completed a cross-channel survey over 50 years previously and, as part of the Principal Triangulation in 1858, had measured the distance from Valentia Island (51°28′N, 10°20′W) to Greenwich (51°55′N). The accuracy of the cross-channel survey was poor by the standards of 1860, and there were also doubts about the Triangulation in Valentia, so it was decided to repeat both sets of measurements.|$|E
