500|$|Finally, while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>visiting</b> Andrew at {{his country}} estate in Berkshire to play him the tracks we had recorded, he {{suddenly}} {{sat down at}} the piano and played the most beautiful melody, which he suggested could be our new song. Needless to say, I grabbed it. However, we still needed lyrics and Tim dutifully began to put words to the music. The vast majority of the original Evita score had been done this way: music first, lyrics afterwards. After many weeks of nail biting, Tim was finally cajoled into writing the lyrics that now accompany the music to [...] "You Must Love Me".|$|E
500|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>visiting</b> {{my friend}} and generous benefactor, Prof. Edward C. Pickering. With {{characteristic}} kindness, he had volunteered to have the spectra observed for all the stars—including comparison stars—which had been observed in the observations for stellar parallax which Hinks and I made at Cambridge, and I discussed. This piece of apparently routine work proved very fruitful—it led to the discovery that all the stars of very faint absolute magnitude were of spectral class M. In conversation on this subject (as I recall it), I asked Pickering about certain other faint stars, not on my list, mentioning in particular 40 Eridani B. Characteristically, he sent a note to the Observatory office and before long the answer came (I think from Mrs Fleming) that the spectrum of this star was A. I knew enough about it, even in these paleozoic days, to realize at once {{that there was an}} extreme inconsistency between what we would then have called [...] "possible" [...] values of the surface brightness and density. I must have shown that I was not only puzzled but crestfallen, at this exception to what looked like a very pretty rule of stellar characteristics; but Pickering smiled upon me, and said: [...] "It is just these exceptions that lead to an advance in our knowledge", and so the white dwarfs entered the realm of study! ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{as a boy}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>visiting</b> the old Proud-Katrina, I {{was afraid}} of {{lightning}} like all boys in those days. When the sheet lightning flared at the night, Katrina said: [...] "Don't be afraid little child, it is only Freyja who is out making fire with steel and flintstone {{to see if the}} rye is ripe. She is kind to people and she is only doing it to be of service, she is not like Thor, he slays both people and livestock, when he is in the mood" [...] I later heard several old folks talk of the same thing in the same way.|$|E
2500|$|In another interview, Amos explained, [...] " [...] {{said to me}} in March when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>visiting</b> him in New York, 'I’ve {{always wanted}} to know what you would do with a {{seasonal}} album. You’re a minister’s daughter so you grew up with this stuff, but you’re also a feminist.' A lot of this music was written when things were really puritanical and women didn’t have any rights, and so there isn’t a lot of embracing of the feminine except with the Virgin Mary, if that makes any sense. Because he and I were talking about music that goes back, a more pagan style of music where {{there seems to be a}} place where goddesses were honoured if you go back into antiquity. And he said, 'I’d really like to see you have a perspective on the carols and write some of your own.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{recounted in}} his 1952 memoir Witness, Whittaker Chambers {{came to know}} Lore because they both {{reported}} to rezident Markin: [...] He described him as follows: [...] Lore was an old Bolshevik. He had been a Socialist before the Russian Revolution. In those pre-revolutionary days, {{he had been the}} friend of Trotsky, then a New York Socialist journalist. After the Revolution, Lore had managed an American speaking trip for Alexandra Kollontai, the author of Red Love, later the Soviet ambassador to Sweden. [...] Bukharin, in his New York days, had eaten and slept in the apartment on 55th Street in Brooklyn, where Lore, his outspokenly anti-Communist wife and three wholly American sons still lived. [...] He describes the Lore family with some detail: [...] I was introduced to Lillian Lore, Ludwig's remarkable wife, who in large part provided those meals, and, by some economic miracle, had kept that amazing household together during the long, lean years, had fed the endless procession of guests. [...] "Die unvergessliche Lores-the unforgettable Lores," [...] a German friend had called them... I have seldom seen a happy family life so explicit in the characters of all who shared it... I soon came to regard the Lores' house as a kind of second home. [...] For Ludwig I developed an almost filial feeling as of a younger for an older revolutionist. [...] The kindness of all the Lores to me was personal, and in spite of politics, for all {{the other members of the}} family, except Ludwig, were outspoken in their detestation of the Communist Party. [...] Chambers also describes a defector's fear of retribution from the Soviet Underground, which Lore and he shared: [...] I did not know that at the very time <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>visiting</b> him most frequently, Lore was under surveillance. [...] He was being watched, not by the American authorities, but by the Russian secret police... I discovered that he was afraid to walk alone with me on the street at night and that he was terrified to get into an automobile alone with me. Then I knew that there was something seriously amiss. But I had been out of the Communist Party six or seven years, and Lore was dead, before I discovered that the old Bolshevik, in whom, as a younger man, I respected the older revolutionist, had denounced me (around 1941) to the F.B.I. I learned it not from the FBI, but from another security agency of the Government. [...] I respected Lore all the more for that act. My feeling for him and for all the Lores remained unchanged.|$|E

6000|$|And in January <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>visited</b> by Vasquez, {{who brought}} me {{a letter from the}} King, not, indeed, {{addressed}} to me and in the terms I had suggested, but to Vasquez himself, and it ran: ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I met her a {{good while}} ago, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>visiting</b> a chum of mine at his father's house here. I didn't suppose she'd know me; but she did at once, and began to ask me if I was at the Hallecks'--as if I had never gone away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is three}} years," [...] said Mara. [...] "I {{scarcely}} {{know what he}} is like now. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>visiting</b> in Boston {{when he came home}} from his three-years' voyage, and he was gone into the lumbering country when I came back.

6000|$|... "At {{any rate}} we will try, you and <b>I.</b> While <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>visiting</b> the Kennedys, {{you can be}} finding out people who were at Limerick during the siege, and gather all they can {{remember}} about the Kennedys there." ...|$|R
6000|$|When they pressed me further, I said: [...] "I {{am really}} the questioner. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>visiting</b> your country, {{and you have}} to tell me things. It is not right that I should do all the telling. Tell me all about Romain Rolland." ...|$|R

60|$|I yawned as if {{weary of}} {{the subject of this}} chief, and indeed of the whole business. Then the Induna said that I must come to the King and repeat to him all the words that I had spoken. I replied that I could not {{possibly}} do so as, having finished my trading, I had arranged to go north to shoot elephants. He answered that elephants lived a long while and would not die while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>visiting</b> the King.|$|E
60|$|On the {{following}} morning I went with the friend <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>visiting</b> at Willersey to Saintbury, and the story heard overnight was confirmed. The owl had been hooting in the daytime in the same old horse-chestnut tree from which it had {{a short time ago}} foretold the young woman's death. One of the villagers, who was engaged in repairing the thatch of a cottage close to the tree, informed us that the owl's hooting had not troubled him in the least. Owls, he truly said, often hoot in the daytime during the autumn months, and he did not believe that it meant death for some one.|$|E
6000|$|Without my diary, I doubt--pray let me {{express it}} in the grossest terms!--if I could have {{honestly}} earned my money. With my diary, the poor labourer (who forgives Mr. Blake for insulting her) is worthy of her hire. Nothing escaped {{me at the time}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>visiting</b> dear Aunt Verinder. Everything was entered (thanks to my early training) day by day as it happened; and everything down to the smallest particular, shall be told here. My sacred regard for truth is (thank God) far above my respect for persons. It will be easy for Mr. Blake to suppress what may not prove to be sufficiently flattering in these pages to the person chiefly concerned in them. He has purchased my time, but not even HIS wealth can purchase my conscience too.* ...|$|E

6000|$|... "'Well, {{some years}} ago <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>visited</b> by a {{grinning}} son-of-a-gun from New York--no other than the great T.R. I took him around.

6000|$|I {{made up my}} {{mind that}} if this man was not a liar he only missed it by the skin of his teeth. This episode reminds me of an {{incident}} of my brief sojourn in Siam, years afterward. The European citizens of a town in the neighborhood of Bangkok had a prodigy among them by the name of Eckert, an Englishman--a person famous for the number, ingenuity and imposing magnitude of his lies. They were always repeating his most celebrated falsehoods, and always trying to [...] "draw him out" [...] before strangers; but they seldom succeeded. Twice he was invited to the house where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>visiting,</b> but nothing could seduce him into a specimen lie. One day a planter named Bascom, an influential man, and a proud and sometimes irascible one, invited me to ride over with him and call on Eckert. As we jogged along, said he: ...|$|E
6000|$|I can {{not tell}} how I really {{suffered}} in many ways for my improvidence and heedlessness, in going to sea so ill provided with every thing calculated to make my situation at all comfortable, or even tolerable. In time, my wretched [...] "long togs" [...] began to drop off my back, and I looked like a Sam Patch, shambling round the deck in my rags and the wreck of my gaff-topsail-boots. I often thought what my friends at home would have said, if they could but get one peep at me. But I hugged myself in my miserable shooting-jacket, when I considered that that degradation and shame never could overtake me; yet, I thought it a galling mockery, when I remembered that my sisters had promised to tell all inquiring friends, that Wellingborough had gone [...] "abroad" [...] just as if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>visiting</b> Europe on a tour with my tutor, as poor simple Mr. Jones had hinted to the captain.|$|E
60|$|The {{rest of the}} winter, {{after the}} {{departure}} of the peace commissioners, passed off quietly and uneventfully, except for two or three little incidents. On one occasion during this period, while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>visiting</b> Washington City for the purpose of conferring with the administration, the enemy's cavalry under General Wade Hampton, passing our extreme left and then going to the south, got in east of us. Before their presence was known, they had driven off a large number of beef cattle that were grazing in that section. It was a fair capture, and they were sufficiently needed by the Confederates. It was only retaliating for what we had done, sometimes for many weeks at a time, when out of supplies taking what the Confederate army otherwise would have gotten. As appears in this book, on one single occasion we captured five thousand head of cattle which were crossing the Mississippi River near Port Hudson on their way from Texas to supply the Confederate army in the East.|$|E
5000|$|Mount Salak {{offers several}} routes for climbing. The route most often climbed is Curug Nangka, in the {{northern}} part of the range. Peak <b>I</b> <b>is</b> <b>visited</b> via easier routes from the east, through Cimelati and Cicurug. Peak <b>I</b> also can <b>be</b> reached by more challenging routes, from Peak II via Sukamantri and Ciapus. An additional alternate route is [...] "the back way" [...] through Cidahu, Sukabumi, and Kawah Ratu near Bunder Mount.|$|R
5000|$|The trauma {{from the}} bombing and the air-raids stayed {{with him for a}} lifetime, Moffat wrote: [...] "At the time, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> somehow able to {{suppress}} the horror of our experiences during the war, and carry on day by day. However, about a year after the bombings in Bristol and Weston-super-Mare, I began suffering from what is now called post-traumatic stress disorder. I began getting severe nightmares and panic attacks. Even today I still occasionally experience panic attacks, generally when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>visiting</b> Europe." ...|$|R

6000|$|Now {{while he}} was {{preparing}} to draw his map in the ashes, or afterwards, I forget which, Zikali {{had told me that}} when we drew near to the great river we should come to a place on the edge of bush-veld that ran down to the river, where a white man lived, adding, after casting his bones and reading from them, that he thought this white man was a [...] "trek-Boer." [...] This, I should explain, means a Dutchman who has travelled away from wherever he lived and made a home for himself in the wilderness, as some wandering spirit and the desire to be free of authority often prompt these people to do. Also, after another inspection of his enchanted knuckle-bones, he had declared that something remarkable would happen to this man or his family, while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>visiting</b> him. Lastly in that map he drew in the ashes, the details of which were impressed so indelibly upon my memory, he had shown me where I should find the dwelling of this white man, of whom and of whose habitation doubtless he knew through the many spies who seemed to be at the service of all witch-doctors, and more especially of Zikali, the greatest among them.|$|E
6000|$|... 21. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>visiting</b> {{all this}} morning, {{and then went}} to the Secretary's office, and found Mr. Harley, with whom I dined; and Secretary St. John, etc., and Harley promised in a very few days to finish what remains of my business. Prior was of the company, and we all dine at the Secretary's to-morrow. I saw Stella's mother this morning: she came early, and we talked an hour. I wish you would propose to Lady Giffard to take the three hundred pounds out of her hands, and give her common {{interest}} for life, and security that you will pay her: the Bishop of Clogher, or any friend, would be security for you, if you gave them counter-security; and it may be argued that it will pass better to be in your hands than hers, in case of mortality, etc. Your mother says, if you write, she will second it; and you may write to your mother, and then it will come from her. She tells me Lady Giffard has a mind to see me, by her discourse; but I told her what to say, with a vengeance. She told Lady Giffard she was going to see me: she looks extremely well. I am writing(16) in my bed like a tiger; and so good-night, etc.|$|E

[...] "He is a {{striking}} person--and I noticed him when he shook hands with you. That was quite enough for me. I have just introduced myself to him as your mother. He was a little stately and stiff, but most charming when he knew who I was. I volunteered to find you. He was quite astonished. I think he took me for your elder sister. Not the least like each other--are we, Lady Loring? She takes after her poor dear father. He was constitutionally indolent. My sweet child, rouse yourself. You have drawn a prize in the great lottery at last. If ever a man was in love, Mr. Romayne is that man. I am a physiognomist, Lady Loring, and I see the passions in the face. Oh, Stella, what a property! Vange Abbey. I once drove that way when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>visiting</b> in the neighborhood. Superb! And another fortune (twelve thousand {{a year and a}} villa at Highgate) since the death of his aunt. And my daughter may be mistress of this if she only plays her cards properly. What a compensation after all that we suffered through that monster, Winterfield!" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{main road}} from Ilam to Wallanchoon, which I quitted on Sakkiazung, descends steeply on the {{opposite}} bank of the river, which I crossed in a canoe formed of a hollow trunk (of Toon), thirty feet long.
