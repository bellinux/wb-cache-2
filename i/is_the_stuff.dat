The free-will of Shiva is {{manifested}} as energy, called Shakti, which emanates from Shiva himself and <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> from which the world is created, thus, being ontologically anterior to the world, it is beyond any obstacles. When Shakti begins the process of manifestation it subdivides {{into a number of}} ontological categories or substances called tattvas, 36 in number. Thus, the world is considered real (not illusory, as in other monistic idealistic spiritual schools).|$|E

500|$|Commentary on the beheadings varied widely. One {{column in}} The West Australia found humour in them, {{referring}} to the head as a [...] "bonce" [...] and a [...] "noggin", and finished with a pun on [...] "skullduggery". Stephen Muecke calls this the [...] "satirical trivialising of Aboriginal concerns"; and Adam Shoemaker writes [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> of light humour and comic relief. There is no sense of the decapitation as being an act of vandalism, even less {{that it could have}} been motivated by malevolence... he piece has a definite authorising function". On the other hand, academic analysis has treated the act with much more gravity. In 2007, for example, David Martin described the decapitation as [...] "an act which speaks not only to the continuance of white settler racism, but also to the power of mimesis to invigorate our modern memorials and monuments with a life of their own." ...|$|E

[...] Bruna Nessif of E! Online shortly commented that Bieber [...] "is not a little boy anymore" [...] in the music video for the song. Upon release, the video broke the VEVO record for having the most views in a 24-hour period with 8.00 million.

Assis criticized the fact that several directors like to [...] "glamorize poverty," [...] and as such, he characterized his characters to show the people's vice. José Geraldo Couto of Folha de S.

Deborah Young of Variety opined that the mango yellow color represents both [...] "the jaundiced shade of their broken dreams" [...] and their sense [...] "of nonconformity and feeling alive." ...|$|E
500|$|Fiasco {{is noted}} for his anti-establishment views. In an {{interview}} with Stephen Colbert on the satirical news show The Colbert Report, Fiasco stated his credo on political philosophy: [...] "You should criticize power even if you agree with it." [...] In another interview in June 2011 on the CBS program What's Trending, Fiasco discussed the political content of his music, stating, [...] "My fight against terrorism, to me, the biggest terrorist is Obama and the United States of America. I'm trying to fight the terrorism that's actually causing the other forms of terrorism. You know, {{the root cause of}} terrorism <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> the U.S. government allows to happen. The foreign policies that we have in place in different countries that inspire people to become terrorists." [...] He additionally criticized Obama for his stance on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. [...] In keeping with his anti-establishment views, Fiasco does not vote in U.S. elections. On January 20, 2013, he was removed from the stage by the security for refusing to move onto the next song after performing a 30-minute version of [...] "Words I Never Said", which contains anti-Obama lyrics, in Washington D.C., during Obama's second presidential inauguration.

500|$|The Orange County Registers {{film critic}} Michael Sragow gave the film grade [...] "A" [...] and commented on three lead characters, [...] "A trio of terrific {{performers}} imbues a riveting AIDS drama with {{heart and mind}} as well as pertinence." [...] Film critic Ty Burr reviewed the film for The Boston Globe and criticized, [...] "The movie's often touching and very watchable, but what gets you past the script's sincere calculation is the growing sense of rage toward a medical-industrial complex that saw AIDS sufferers as guinea pigs and sources of profit." [...] The Chicago Tribunes film critic Michael Phillips talked about [...] "How Woodroof became his own brand of AIDS activist <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> of Dallas Buyers Club, which does a few things wrong but a lot right, starting {{right at the top}} with McConaughey." [...] Bob Mondello criticized the film's character for the NPR in these words: [...] "Dallas Buyers Club is just about a selfish boor who arguably gets a pass in terms of posterity, because while looking out for No. 1, he paved the way for change for everyone else." [...] Dana Stevens of Slate magazine praised McConaughey's performance, highlighting that the movie [...] "traffics in deep hindbrain emotions: fear and rage and lust and, above all, the pure animal drive to go on living." ...|$|E

500|$|Giving a {{partially}} negative {{review of the}} film was Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out New York, who said the [...] "movie has a centerfold sheen to it—and some lesbianic soft-core flirtation to match—as its plot dives deeply into Twilight-esque heavy-melo meltdown in the last act" [...] and that [...] "Cody throws one too many losses at Needy; the screenwriter loses her satiric way about halfway through. But for a while, this has real fangs". Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post said, [...] "There's a certain kooky, kinky fun to be had with Jennifer's Body" [...] but that [...] "dmittedly, this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> of lurid adolescent distraction, not great cinema" [...] and [...] "is strictly a niche item but provides a goofy, campy bookend to Drag Me to Hell on the B-movie shelf. Watch it, forget it, move on". San Francisco Chronicle Peter Hartlaub stated, [...] "Enjoy the film for its witty dialogue and fun performances, but know that there isn't a single good scare. An episode of Murder, She Wrote has more thrills." [...] Hartlaub felt the film is not bad, is [...] "almost always pleasing" [...] and that Fox [...] "proves that she has some [...] range" [...] but [...] "the chances {{that it will be}} somebody else's pop culture reference 27 years from now are slim to none". Joe Neumaier of New York Daily News said, [...] "Fox merely needs to look either vacant or evil, which the Transformers boy-toy does spookily well" [...] but [...] "ords and story are still the lifeblood of a movie, and Jennifer's Body is filled like a Twinkie with half-fleshed-out ideas". Disagreeing with Fox's performance, Chicago Tribune's Michael Phillips called Fox [...] "a pretty bad actress" [...] who [...] "doesn't seem to get Cody's sense of humor. At all". He reasoned the [...] "movie's partially redeemed by Seyfried, who makes her character more than a repository for audience sympathy" [...] and [...] "her make-out scene with Fox is handled with more suspense and care than anything else in the movie".|$|E

During the period of Soviet rule in Bessarabia (the Moldavian SSR), references to Romanian cultural assets were usually shunned; this changed in the late 1980s, when Bessarabian cultural magazines were allowed to republish samples of classical Romanian literature. Nistru journal inaugurated the trend in 1988, choosing Pogor as the first contributor to revive.
