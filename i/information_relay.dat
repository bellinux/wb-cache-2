40|$|Abstract — Cooperative {{control in}} the {{presence}} of a limited communication range poses significant theoretical and practical challenges. Some control strategies in this area rely on <b>information</b> <b>relay</b> where all information received by any vehicle is passed to all other vehicles that it communicates with. Some other control strategies in this area are based on local neighbor-to-neighbor information exchange where each vehicle only communicates directly with all other vehicles in its communication range without <b>information</b> <b>relay</b> involved. Both <b>information</b> <b>relay</b> and local information based strategies have their strengths and limitations. In this paper, we investigate the two control strategies in the context of a multi-vehicle rendezvous application. Various aspects of the two strategies are compared in relation to convergence time and overall system performance. Strengths and limitations of both control strategies will be discussed and approaches for overcoming these limitations will be proposed. I...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{classify}} relay forwarding schemes on {{the basis}} of soft and hard information. While soft information is highly beneficial, it may also incur additional expenditure of network resources such as power and bandwidth. The relay functionality optimization problem is therefore related to optimizing soft information. With SNR as a metric, we show that the optimal soft <b>information</b> <b>relay</b> mechanism for uncoded communication is the estimate and forward (EF) policy. We demonstrate that EF is well suited to both parallel and serial relay networks due to its optimized soft information content. We also provide an example of a hybrid network where the performance gain from EF is significant. I...|$|E
40|$|Auditory <b>information</b> <b>relayed</b> by {{auditory}} nerve fibers and somatosensory <b>information</b> <b>relayed</b> by granule cell parallel fibers converge on the fusiform cells (FCs) of the dorsal cochlear nucleus, the first brain station of the auditory pathway. In vitro, parallel fiber synapses on FCs exhibit spike-timing-dependent plasticity with Hebbian learning rules, partially {{mediated by the}} NMDA receptor (NMDAr). Well-timed bimodal auditory-somatosensory stimulation, in vivo equivalent of spike-timing-dependent plasticity, can induce stimulus-timing-dependent plasticity (StTDP) of the FCs spontaneous and tone-evoked firing rates. In healthy guinea pigs, the resulting distribution of StTDP learning rules across a FC neural population is dominated by a Hebbian profile while anti-Hebbian, suppressive and enhancing LRs are less frequent. In this study, we investigate in vivo, the NMDAr contribution to FC baseline activity and long term plasticity. We find that blocking the NMDAr decreases the synchronization of FC- spontaneous activity and mediates differential modulation of FC rate-level functions such that low, and high threshold units {{are more likely to}} increase, and decrease, respectively, their maximum amplitudes. Three significant alterations in mean learning-rule profiles were identified...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{practical}} {{large scale}} relay networks, {{it is often}} an unfeasible task to adapt the strategy of the relays to each source/sink pair communicating through the network. In this paper we consider the strategy of the relays as fixed and chosen in advance. In this context, it is a crucial problem for the source node transmitting information, to know the strategy of the relays in the network. Therefore we optimize the transmit strategy of the source node, assuming only partial <b>relay</b> <b>information</b> knowledge, i. e., channel state <b>information</b> and <b>relay</b> strategies. We also study the impact of getting complete <b>relay</b> <b>information</b> from certain <b>relays</b> only, derive {{the reduction in the}} problem uncertainty due to this knowledge and evaluate numerically the performance of the network.

As <b>information</b> is further <b>relayed</b> to subsequent visual areas, it is coded as increasingly non-local frequency/phase signals. Note that, at these early stages of cortical visual processing, spatial location of visual information is well preserved amid the local contrast encoding (edge detection).|$|R
