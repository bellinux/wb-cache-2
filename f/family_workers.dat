25|$|Pupils, {{students}} {{and children in}} kindergartens were incorporated into the accident insurance scheme, which benefited 11 million children. Free medical checkups were introduced that same year, while the Farmers' Sickness Insurance Law (1972) introduced compulsory sickness insurance for independent farmers, <b>family</b> <b>workers</b> in agriculture, and pensioners under the farmers' pension scheme, medical benefits for all covered groups, and cash benefits for <b>family</b> <b>workers</b> under compulsory coverage for pension insurance. Participation in employer's health insurance was extended to four million employees. A Development Law of December 1970 {{made it possible for}} all employees voluntarily to become members of the statutory sickness insurance. The level of income for compulsory sickness insurance was indexed to 75% of the respective assessment level for pension insurance, while voluntarily insured employees were granted a claim to an allowance towards their sickness insurance from their employer. This law also introduced a new type of sickness insurance benefit, namely facilities for the early diagnosis of disease. Apart from the discretionary service of disease prevention which had existed since 1923, insured persons now had a right in certain circumstances to medical examinations aimed at the early diagnosis of disease. According to one study, this marked a change in the concept of sickness insurance: it now aimed at securing good health.|$|E

25|$|The Current Population Survey (aka Household Survey) {{measures}} {{the percentage of}} the population that is employed and unemployed. The result can be multiplied by population estimates to get total employment estimates. This survey has the advantage over the payroll survey in that it includes self-employed. The Household Survey is less accurate in producing total numbers since it requires population estimates and in that it samples many fewer people (60,000 households versus 400,000 business establishments). For better or worse, the Household Survey counts multiple jobs held by one person only once, and it includes government workers, farm workers, unpaid <b>family</b> <b>workers,</b> and workers absent without pay. The Household Survey indicates that {{the percentage of the}} population employed decreased from 64.4% in December 2000 and January 2001 to 62.1% in August and September 2003. By August 2005, it had recovered only to 62.9%. In absolute numbers, this corresponds to a drop of 1.6 million jobs but an eventual net gain of 4.7 million jobs during the Bush administration.|$|E
25|$|Gender {{inequality}} both {{leads to}} {{and is a}} result of food insecurity. According to estimates women and girls make up 60% of the world's chronically hungry and little {{progress has been made in}} ensuring the equal right to food for women enshrined in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Women face discrimination both in education and employment opportunities and within the household, where their bargaining power is lower. On the other hand, gender equality is described as instrumental to ending malnutrition and hunger. Women tend to be responsible for food preparation and childcare within the family and are more likely to spend their income on food and their children's needs. Women also play an important role in food production, processing, distribution and marketing. They often work as unpaid <b>family</b> <b>workers,</b> are involved in subsistence farming and represent about 43% of the agricultural labor force in developing countries, varying from 20% in Latin America to 50% in Eastern and Southeastern Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. However, women face discrimination in access to land, credit, technologies, finance and other services. Empirical studies suggest that if women had the same access to productive resources as men, women could boost their yields by 20–30%; raising the overall agricultural output in developing countries by 2.5 to 4%. While those are rough estimates, the significant benefit of closing the gender gap on agricultural productivity cannot be denied. The gendered aspects of food security are visible along the four pillars of food security: availability, access, utilization and stability, as defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the main determinants of self-employment in Turkey. For this aim, we utilized from {{the definition of}} self-employment in TURKSTAT’s Household Labor Force Surveys (HLFS), where self-employment covers three groups of individuals, namely, employer, own-account worker and unpaid-family workers. The data set is obtained from the raw data of Household Labor Force Surveys of 2006 - 2007 and 2008. In order to analyze the data, the multinomial-logit model is used and estimated by maximum likelihood estimation method. Main findings of this analysis are as the following. We find that living in the urban areas {{increases the likelihood of}} being employer, but decreases the likelihood of being own-account worker as well as unpaid <b>family</b> <b>worker,</b> as compared to the base category of wage-employed individuals. Also, being female declines the likelihood of being in the self-employment types. Further, being married increases the probability of being employer and own-account worker, while it declines the probability of being unpaid <b>family</b> <b>worker.</b> In addition, being head of household increases the likelihood of being employer, but it declines the likelihood of being own-account <b>worker</b> and unpaid <b>family</b> <b>worker,</b> as compared to the base group. Furthermore, increases in age continuously increase the probability of being employer, while there is a U-shaped relation between age and being unpaid <b>family</b> <b>worker,</b> compared to the base group of wage-employed. As compared to non-graduates the probability of being employer is lower for vocational high school and university graduates, while the same probability is higher for B. Darıcı & H. M.
