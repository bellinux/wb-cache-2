40|$|In a {{franchising}} relationship, the franchisor {{is responsible}} for arranging initial and ongoing training for the franchise owners. However, most of the young or smaller size franchisors {{do not have enough}} resources to arrange versatile and in-depth training for their franchisees. The Finnish <b>franchisee</b> <b>training</b> program is an answer to this need. It is a unique training given to prospective franchisees by a third party. The program aims to find people interested in franchising and to give them the essential skills and knowledge a franchisee needs. Additional goal is to help the trainees to choose a franchise. The organizing parties behind the programs are the government owned Employment and Economic Development Centres and a private consultation company specialised in franchising. The training program enables franchisors to concentrate on system specific training, while it strives for providing the participants with a realistic view of the time, financial and skills demands of franchise ownership and self-employment. Therefore, the program serves both franchisors and prospective franchisees. The first program was organised in 1999 in Helsinki. Subsequently, the programs have also been arranged in two other major cities, Tampere and Turku. In total, more than 200 trainees graduated from the first ten programs held in 1999 - 2001. The graduates comprise the samples of the current study. The data were collected in two separate phases. Mailed questionnaires and phone interviews were used to gather quantitative an...|$|E

Metlink's ownership was then {{handed over to the}} two remaining major metropolitan operators - Yarra Trams and Connex Melbourne - the latter replaced by new <b>train</b> <b>franchisee</b> Metro <b>Trains</b> Melbourne in 2009. Representatives of the Bus Association of Victoria and V/Line had input into Metlink, but they did not have a controlling interest.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{seeks to}} focus on the {{education}} of the franchisee and specifically to detect whether and how information is being transferred from franchisor to franchisee. Franchising enterprises are organized and managed differently related to other enterprises. To find out who is responsible for the <b>training</b> of the <b>franchisee</b> and whether franchising enterprises highlight the significance of education, {{in order to keep the}} organization culture and the brand of the firm. To observe whether there is education on a regular basis and what kind of education is suggested. Is there education on general topics or in specific ones? Are <b>franchisees</b> <b>trained</b> to understand the values and the goals of the whole firm?The statistical analysis of the obtained data, deriving from a structured questionnaire survey, provided interesting insights on the above matters, revealing that franchising enterprises give great emphasis on the <b>training</b> of their <b>franchisees,</b> because they want to keep and augment their goodwill and reputation. The success of franchising is based on regular training...|$|R

The former {{regional}} <b>franchisee</b> Arriva <b>Trains</b> Northern initiated a twice daily Leeds–Glasgow Central service in 1999 (calling at Settle, Appleby, Carlisle, Lockerbie and Motherwell).

The company met this challenge by being the first to entice retirees back into the workforce. Focusing on off-site training, it opened its Hamburger University in 1961 to <b>train</b> <b>franchisees</b> and corporate decision-makers. By 1990, more than 40,000 people had received [...] "Bachelor of Hamburgerology" [...] degrees from the 80 acre Oak Brook, Illinois, facility.

5|$|Most Noodles & Company {{restaurants}} are {{owned and operated}} by Noodles & Company Incorporated, but some are operated in a franchise model. Franchise locations are operated by an independent <b>franchisee</b> that is <b>trained</b> by Noodles & Company and uses the same menu, pricing and branding as corporate-owned stores. As of 2010, the average Noodles & Company store generated more than $1 million in annual revenue, with a profit of 21 percent. Takeout orders account for approximately 25 percent of revenues. According to Inc. Magazine, Noodles & Company is more selective in franchise partners than other franchise-based restaurants, and has a higher ratio of corporate-owned stores than most franchising restaurants.|$|R

In a carefully staged set piece, the first Class 395 train and two Eurostar trains arrived through a cloud of dry ice in adjacent platforms within seconds of each other. During the ceremony, Paul Day's large bronze statue The Meeting Place was also unveiled. At a much smaller ceremony on 12 November 2007, the bronze statue of John Betjeman by sculptor Martin Jennings was unveiled by Betjeman's daughter, the author Candida Lycett Green. Public service by Eurostar train via High Speed 1 started on 14 November 2007. In a small ceremony, station staff cut a ribbon leading to the Eurostar platforms.

50|$|Stafford {{railway station}} {{was once a}} major hub on the railway network, but the {{suspension}} of passenger services on the Stafford to Uttoxeter line in 1939 and Beeching's closure of the Stafford to Shrewsbury Line in 1964 completely halted east-west traffic through Stafford. The years up to 2008 saw cross-country trains stopping at Stafford less frequently. Since the CrossCountry <b>trains</b> <b>franchisee</b> change, more CrossCountry trains are now stopping at Stafford railway station. Stafford railway station is still a stop {{for a number of}} Virgin Trains services on the West Coast Main Line enabling easy commuting to London (Euston) and Liverpool. CrossCountry trains operate a regular service to Stoke-on-trent and Manchester Piccadilly normally every 30 Mins during the weekdays; Since December 2008 London Midland have operated a service stopping at Stafford which also serves Crewe and London and also a Birmingham - Liverpool Lime Street service which departs Stafford Station normally every 30 mins during the weekdays. At least one train each way between Birmingham New Street and Crewe is operated by Arriva Trains Wales.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} operational {{differences between}} mobile franchising arrangements and fixed-site franchises from an agency-theoretic perspective. Almost 40 per cent of all franchised units in Australia operate as mobile or home-based businesses, predominantly in service industries where {{products or services}} are provided directly to consumers. A two-stage methodology is reported in this paper, incorporating quantitative and qualitative research methods. In stage one, data obtained from {{a survey of the}} population of Australian franchisors in 1998 are analysed to compare operational variables of mobile and fixed-site franchise units. The second stage of the research employs in-depth interviews with a sample of mobile franchisors and franchisees to further explore relevant issues. The results confirm the agency theory perspective that start-up investment risk is lower in mobile units and mobile operations exhibit a higher level of repeat customers than fixed-site franchises. No {{significant differences between the two}} arrangements are revealed in relation to the levels of <b>franchisee</b> monitoring, initial <b>training</b> or essential <b>franchisee</b> experience. This study indicates that agency theory contributes to our understanding of mobile franchising arrangements, yet also suggests the findings are not completely explained by agency theory. The results imply that both monitoring and alignment of incentives have complimentary effects and that both forms of contract are necessary in a franchisor's control system. No Full Tex...|$|R
