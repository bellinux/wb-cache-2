40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} {{nonlinear}} robust controller for steam <b>governor</b> <b>control</b> in power systems. Based on dissipation theory, an innovative recursive design method {{is presented to}} construct the storage function of single machine infinite bus (SMIB) and multi-machine power systems. Furthermore, the nonlinear L 2 -gain disturbance attenuation control strategy is achieved for speed <b>governor</b> <b>control</b> of turbo-generators without requiring the solution of an HJI inequality. With multi-machine power system control, all the variables in the control law are only relevant to the state variables of the local generator, thus a decentralized control strategy is achieved. Simulation results of a 4 -machine system show that the controller can enhance power transient stability and dynamic performance. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Due to {{the differing}} {{electromechanical}} characteristics of modern variable speed wind turbines to conventional generators, {{the provision of}} ancillary services from wind generation is likely to {{change the nature of}} the frequency response of power systems to contingency events. This paper explores the aggregate contribution from wind turbines to the frequency response of future power systems, considering both emulated inertial and <b>governor</b> <b>controls.</b> In particular, the potential issues that may arise {{as a result of the}} changing nature of the system frequency response due to the uncertainty over the distribution of ancillary services from embedded generation on the network, are examined in the context of future power system requirements.

A software application developed in LabVIEW simulation of a radio <b>control</b> <b>link</b> for light sources and used for evaluating the radio <b>control</b> <b>link's</b> range of various combinations of polarization of transmitting and receiving antennas has been discussed. It was established and experimentally verified that the received energy was able to be computed using the two-ray model: a line-of-sight ray and the reflected one.

30|$|Topology {{package is}} a program {{collection}} {{which is responsible for}} network topology corresponding to the real world, whose main capability is conveniently to manage and use the network topology. A modular function includes two parts, namely topology establishment and user deployment. In order to establish the network topology in a simulation architecture, we proposed an applicable for multi-hop relay network topology architecture (AMRNTA). In AMRNTA, we use tree structure to establish the network topology, in which all nodes have two types of <b>links,</b> i.e., <b>control</b> <b>link</b> and data <b>link.</b> <b>Control</b> <b>link</b> and data link are responsible for delivering the management messages and data, respectively, and each link has both uplink and downlink directions. Before establishing network topology, each son node needs to define a parent node, and then, the son node first establishes a UL data link to his parent node, meanwhile the parent node adds this son node to his DL data link queue. Next, the son node sets his parent node as a <b>control</b> <b>link</b> target node (CLTN). If the CLTN has the wireless resource allocation ability, the son node establishes a UL <b>control</b> <b>link</b> to this CLTN, meanwhile the CLTN adds the son node to his DL <b>control</b> <b>link</b> queue; otherwise, the son node sets the CLTN parent node as a new CLTN if it does not have the wireless resource allocation ability and repeat the foregoing procedure until the new CTLN has the ability to allocate wireless resource. The establishment of network topology is in a point-to-multipoint (PMP) manner and has broadcast function, because a son node only has a parent node but the parent node may possibly have many son nodes. With this architecture, the procedure of establishing network topology can be simplified.|$|R

40|$|A novel {{nonlinear}} decentralized robust <b>governor</b> <b>control</b> for hydroturbine-generator sets in multi-machine {{power systems}} is suggested in this paper. The nonelastic water hammer effect and disturbances are {{considered in the}} modeling. The advanced differential geometry theory, nonlinear robust control theory and the dynamic feedback method are combined to solve the problem. The nonlinear decentralized robust control law for the speed governor of hydroturbine-generators has been derived. The input signals to the proposed controller are all local measurements and independent to the system parameters. The derived control law guarantees the integrated system stability with disturbance attenuation, which is significant to the real power system application. Computer tests on an 8 -machine, 36 -bus power system show clearly {{the effectiveness of the}} new control strategy in transient stability enhancement and disturbance attenuation. The computer test results based on the suggested controller are compared favorably with those based on the conventional linear <b>governor</b> <b>control.</b> © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
