5|$|The Wrights issued {{their own}} factual {{statement}} to the press in January. Nevertheless, the flights did not create public excitement—if people <b>even</b> <b>knew</b> about them—and the news soon faded. In Paris, however, Aero Club of France members, already stimulated by Chanute's reports of Wright gliding successes, took the news more seriously and increased their efforts {{to catch up to}} the brothers.|$|E
5|$|Thus {{the natives}} gave overt clues {{that they were}} displeased with the {{settlement}} being formed there. The property had supposedly been secured by {{an agent of the}} Dutch West India Company in 1640, but the negotiation was transacted with members of the Siwanoy people in distant Norwalk, and the local natives likely {{had little to do with}} that transaction, if they <b>even</b> <b>knew</b> of it at all. Hutchinson was therefore taking a considerable risk in putting a permanent dwelling at this site.|$|E
5|$|Ritter leaves Scully {{staking out}} Fellig's apartment, but Scully is unnerved {{when she sees}} Fellig {{shooting}} photos of her out his window and bangs on his door, demanding to know how he took photos {{at a crime scene}} before the police <b>even</b> <b>knew</b> the crime had been committed. He invites her to take a ride with him so he can show her. After driving, he sees a prostitute who appears to be gray to him. Fellig tells Scully that the woman will be dead very soon. A pimp approaches the woman and begins to harass her. Scully leaps out of the car with her gun, announcing that she is an FBI agent and handcuffing the pimp, but when the prostitute tries to flee, she is hit by a truck and killed.|$|E

His eldest son survived the war, but succumbed to illness in a nearby DP camp before his father <b>even</b> <b>knew</b> that he had survived.

He spent much time listening to and comforting people of all ages, and brought hundreds of people back to religious observance through his passionate public speeches.|$|E
25|$|Joseph Monier, a French {{gardener}} {{and known}} {{to be one of}} the principal inventors of reinforced concrete, was granted a patent for reinforced flowerpots by means of mixing a wire mesh to a mortar shell. In 1877, Monier was granted another patent for a more advanced technique of reinforcing concrete columns and girders with iron rods placed in a grid pattern. Though Monier undoubtedly knew reinforcing concrete would improve its inner cohesion, it is less known if he <b>even</b> <b>knew</b> how much reinforcing actually improved concrete's tensile strength.|$|E
25|$|As McGruder's spaceship, Justice 4, {{began to}} leave the planet Hestia the flight crew were murdered, and the ship crashed.

Since no distress message had been sent, nobody <b>even</b> <b>knew</b> that they had crashed. McGruder received a head injury in the crash, and went into a life-threatening coma. Even though Dredd was a prisoner he assumed command, since none of the ship crew (who now all technically outranked him) were competent or experienced {{enough to keep the}} survivors alive.|$|E

25|$|One Ranger, seventeen-year-old , {{who wanted}} to be in on the action, also died in the fighting. He was the son of camp cook, D. R. Smith and the {{youngest}} Ranger ever to die in the line of duty. Smith was apparently too inexperienced to fully appreciate McNelly's terse orders because he got too close to a wounded Mexican bandit; the bandit killed the boy before Smith <b>even</b> <b>knew</b> what was happening. Berry Smith was buried in the northwest corner of the Brownsville cemetery on June 16 with full military honors. The funeral was recorded as one of the finest the city had ever seen.|$|E
25|$|After the war, Yamashita {{was tried}} {{for war crimes}} {{committed}} by troops under his command during the Japanese defense of the occupied Philippines in 1944. In a controversial trial, Yamashita {{was found guilty of}} his troops' atrocities even though {{there was no evidence that}} he approved or <b>even</b> <b>knew</b> of them, and indeed many of the atrocities were committed by troops not actually under Yamashita's command. This ruling – holding the commander responsible for his or her subordinates' war crimes as long as the commander did not attempt to discover and stop them from occurring – came to be known as the Yamashita standard. Yamashita was sentenced to death, and executed by hanging in 1946.|$|E
25|$|The port {{was under}} the control of the Haitian {{government}} of Toussaint Louverture, which threw the crew of the privateer into prison. The men from Bordelais spent four months in prison but were well treated, with Gordon and the midshipman being permitted to move freely on parole. Eventually all were released to a cartel under the command of Captain Kelpoisson, the commander of the port of Aux Cayes, and the only Frenchman in a position of authority. The British arrived at Port Royal (except for one man who had died), where they found out that the war was over. They returned to Bordelais, where Gordon was able to sit down in the officers' mess before any of his fellow officers <b>even</b> <b>knew</b> that he had returned.|$|E

25|$|Before the {{announcement}} of the sale of Knight Ridder, Brian Tierney, the founder and former CEO of the public relations and advertising firm Tierney Communications, had expressed interest in purchasing the Philadelphia papers. After {{the announcement}} of McClathcy's plan to sell the papers, Tierney began to assemble a group of advisers and investors to purchase the papers with. Tierney formed a group of Philadelphia area investors and businesspeople to form Philadelphia Media Holdings. Almost all of the investors were either former clients of Tierney's or were with him {{on the board of directors}} of The Episcopal Academy. While Tierney found investors, Citizens Financial Group's president Stephen Steinour arranged financing. Working with Tierney a month before they <b>even</b> <b>knew</b> if the Philadelphia papers would be for sale, Steinour arranged US$450 million in financing from Citizens Financial Group's owner, the Royal Bank of Scotland.|$|E
25|$|He {{earned his}} Pilotenabzeichen (Pilot's Badge) and in 1939 was {{assigned}} to Jagdgeschwader (fighter wing) 433, where he was Adolf Galland's adjutant. As the youngest officer, he was also made the Staffel Nachrichtenoffizier (communications officer), a job no one else wanted (or <b>even</b> <b>knew</b> much about). Steinhilper learned that {{he was supposed to}} provide pilots with ground-to-ground and ground-to-air communications using two 1.5 kilowatt radio stations and two field telephone units. He tried hard to promote the use of radios, but most pilots were against the idea, among them Galland, considering the equipment an unnecessary additional weight and the concept a waste of their time. Steinhilper managed to demonstrate its advantages during a large training exercise commanded by General Hugo Sperrle involving a simulated bombing attack on Stuttgart, only to have the results dismissed by Galland and ignored by the rest.|$|E
25|$|The first {{official}} breed standard {{was written in}} 1933. This standard attempted to differentiate the Estrela as a distinct breed. This led to the hooked tail and double dew claws becoming a requirement. All colors were allowed. The standard has undergone small refinements since then. For example, dew claws became optional by 1955, and the allowed colors have been limited {{a few times to}} achieve today’s current set.Prior to World War II, the Estrela breeders were still primarily the shepherds and farmers of the region. Since they were mostly illiterate, they did not make any attempt to follow the official breed standard, if they <b>even</b> <b>knew</b> one existed. But by the early 1950s, interest in the breed returned, and the annual concursos were reinstated. Again the intent was to stimulate interest among the Serra residents and to encourage them to adhere to the official standard. During this period, the long-haired variety was most popular at shows, but “show dogs” represented (and still do) {{only a small portion of}} the Estrela population in Portugal. Many of the working dogs were (and are) short-haired.|$|E
