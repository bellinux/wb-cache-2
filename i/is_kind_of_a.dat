The website Slipcue.com reviewed the release and commented that Love Never Fails, [...] "is probably too rowdy for most Southern Gospel fans (who really like tinkly pianos and less-twangy vocals), and while it probably won't wow many country listeners, for folks who are fans any of these three singers, this <b>is</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> treat.|$|E

Fincher recalled of the encounter: [...] "The ballistic, ripping-yarn thriller aspect of it <b>is</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> red herring in a weird way. It is the thing that throws Salander and Blomkvist together, but it is their relationship you keep coming back to. I was just wondering what 350 pages Zaillian would get rid of." [...] Because Zaillian was already cultivating the screenplay, the director avoided interfering. After a conversation, Fincher was comfortable [...] "they were headed in the same direction".|$|E
500|$|In an interview, Coldplay vocalist Chris Martin {{revealed}} that the song was written in mid-2004 and was inspired by Martin's daughter, Apple, and English alternative rock singer Kate Bush: [...] "That's a song where we were listening {{to a lot of}} Kate Bush last summer, and we wanted a song which had a lot of tom-toms in it. I just had my daughter up also, and was kind of feeling in a sense of awe and wonderment, so the song <b>is</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Kate Bush song about miracles." [...] The drumbeat of the song was inspired by Bush's 1985 song [...] "Running Up that Hill". In a separate interview, bassist Guy Berryman said: [...] "We were really trying to recreate the drums on that song for this song, and the chords. Some bands are reluctant to admit that they take things from other artists and bands that they listen to and we're shameless in that respect, we don't mind telling." ...|$|E
500|$|Lead singer Bono was {{influenced}} by the work of Delmore Schwartz when writing the lyrics of [...] "Acrobat", to whom the song is dedicated. The title of one of his short stories, In Dreams Begin Responsibilities, is quoted in the final verse. Bono noted the book [...] "was on my mind when I was writing the words...

I'm in the mud as a writer, so I could do with a bit of , and that's why I enjoy him." [...] The song was developed from a riff guitarist The Edge developed during a soundcheck in Auckland, New Zealand, on the Lovetown Tour in 1989.

500|$|The Coens have {{acknowledged}} several cinematic inspirations for Barton Fink. Chief {{among these are}} three movies by Polish-French filmmaker Roman Polanski: Repulsion (1965), Cul-de-Sac (1966), and The Tenant (1976). These movies employ a mood of psychological uncertainty coupled with eerie environments that compound the mental instability of the characters. Barton's isolation in his room at the Hotel Earle is frequently {{compared to that of}} Trelkovsky in his apartment in The Tenant. Ethan said regarding the genre of Barton Fink: [...] "t <b>is</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Polanski movie. It is closer to that than anything else." [...] By coincidence, Polanski {{was the head of the}} jury at the Cannes Film Festival in 1991, where Barton Fink premiered. This created an awkward situation. [...] "Obviously", Joel Coen said later, [...] "we have been influenced by his films, but at this time we were very hesitant to speak to him about it because we did not want to give the impression we were sucking up".|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} support Cyrus' then newly launched, joint apparel line with Max Azria, sold {{exclusively}} by Walmart stores, an EP was chosen for release. [...] "I feel it goes perfect {{for that kind of}} look", she commented. For Cyrus, The Time of Our Lives was a transitional EP and a method of re-introducing herself to new audiences. Speaking about the EP's sound, she said, [...] "I kind of kept it in the lines of what I usually do, which <b>is</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pop rock sound — I don’t even like using the word 'rock,' because I feel like it’s an honor to be put in that title. This is kind of my transition. The next record, I definitely {{want to be able to}} step it up a bit." [...] Cyrus originally planned for her succeeding album to be edgier and more predominant in rock music. She said that, after completing promotion for The Time of Our Lives, she wanted to [...] "step out and maybe take a break" [...] for some time in order to compose music that inspires her. Cyrus' next album, Can't Be Tamed was released approximately ten months later, on June 18, 2010.|$|E
500|$|MTV {{columnist}} Josh Wigler {{was disappointed}} with the presumed alien storyline and believed {{it to be a}} [...] "weak episode". Despite liking actor Lance Reddick, Wigler was displeased with his character's increased screentime, believing Broyles works better as an [...] "enigmatic figure". Wigler did however praise the villain's [...] "murderous method of choice", writing [...] "Those who've read my Fringe reviews know that I'm not big on the mystery-of-the-week element, but I have to give this episode some credit for at least making it look good." [...] IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 8.0/10, noting the [...] "great work" [...] done with the CGI and props {{while at the same time}} acknowledging the opening was not [...] "particularly exciting". Isler praised Reddick's performance, but continued [...] "besides the Broyles characterization, this episode kind of fell flat. The plot unfolds slowly, and the first sixty percent of this episode <b>is</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> yawner. The only things that really spice up the story are Walter's antics (which are very amusing, as usual). The monster of the week, an alien stowing away in a Russian cosmonaut's body, isn't all that scary or even malevolent (it's just trying to stay alive by feeding on radiation)." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{asked what}} {{originally}} drew {{her to the}} role of Terri in an interview with TheTVChick, Gilsig said: [...] "Well, first of all, Ryan Murphy. Because I had worked with him on Nip/Tuck. And {{that was one of the}} best experiences as an actor I’ve ever had in my career. He really challenges you as an actor, and he really pushes you, and he really puts a lot of faith in actors to be able to — I think go further than they’ve ever gone before. Certainly for me on Nip/Tuck. You know, for obvious reasons…things I never thought I’d do. (laughs) But also just emotionally and character-wise and comedically. Every script was just this amazing emotional gymnastics. So that first of all: I was like great, I’d love to work with Ryan. And for me, the opportunity to do a comedy is something that I’ve been itching to do for many years now and also if I was going to do that–which <b>is</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> big risk for me–to be able to do that with Ryan, who I know so well, and then so much of the crew that I was familiar with from Nip/Tuck was kind of a dream scenario I would say." ...|$|E

He revealed in letters to fan Jerry Bails that he kept large troves of reference material, mentioning during 1971, [...] "I maintain two file cabinets chock full of stuff.

2500|$|After its {{instrumental}} linking passage, the key ascends to {{its fourth}} interval. According to author Jim Fusilli: [...] "Brian came {{pretty close to}} writing himself into a dead end. There's really nowhere to go {{coming out of the}} bridge, which modulates to G major from D major but ends with a D major–A major–B minor pattern. Thus, when the song returns to D Major, it must do so from B minor, which <b>is</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> static change, particularly when the next chord is a B minor with only a slight variation in the bass." [...] Along with the 8+4 measure verse/chorus scheme, Downes called the idea of a [...] "bridge section in a related key" [...] standard for rock/pop music, but adds: [...] "What is different here, however, is how the move to the subdominant in the bridge conditions the tonal behavior of the entire song, which, though nominally in E Major, is characterized throughout by a tension between it and A major." [...] The [...] "choral fantasy" [...] during this key change eventually concludes that [...] "a clear sense has eluded us for the entire experience–that in fact, the idea of 'key' has itself been challenged and subverted", in Lambert's opinion.|$|E

[...] "Also, because he had so much power and unquestioned authority, I {{thought it would be}} an interesting contrast to play him as a gentle man, unlike Al Capone, who beat up people with baseball bats." [...] Duvall later marveled to A's Biography, [...] "He minimized the sense of beginning. In other words he, like, deemphasized the word action. He would go in front of that camera just like he was before. Cut! It was all the same. There was really no beginning. I learned a lot from watching that." [...] Brando won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance, but he declined it, becoming the second actor to refuse a Best Actor award (after George C. Scott for Patton). He boycotted the award ceremony, instead sending American Indian rights activist Sacheen Littlefeather, who appeared in full Apache attire, to state Brando's reasons, which were based on his objection to the depiction of American Indians by Hollywood and television.|$|E
