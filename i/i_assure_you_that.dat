500|$|Despite Joyce's revolutionary techniques, {{the author}} {{repeatedly}} {{emphasized that the}} book was neither random nor meaningless; with Ellmann quoting the author as having stated: [...] "I can justify every line of my book." [...] To Sisley Huddleston he stated [...] "critics who were most appreciative of Ulysses are complaining about my new work. They cannot understand it. Therefore {{they say it is}} meaningless. Now if it were meaningless it could be written quickly without thought, without pains, without erudition; but <b>I</b> <b>assure</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> these 20 pages now before us [...] cost me twelve hundred hours and an enormous expense of spirit." [...] When the editor of Vanity Fair asked Joyce if the sketches in Work in Progress were consecutive and interrelated, Joyce replied [...] "It is all consecutive and interrelated." ...|$|E
500|$|Ernest's {{support of}} the Prussians in the Austro-Prussian War and later Franco Prussian War meant {{he was no longer}} the {{potential}} leader of a political movement; although it was true that {{he had been able to}} retain his duchies, it had come at a price. According to historian Charlotte Zeepvat, Ernest [...] "was increasingly lost in a whirl of private amusements which earned only contempt from outside". Ernest funneled his political thoughts into the private sphere, preferring to write covertly sponsored articles in the Coburg press that became increasingly embittered against England. In 1886, Ernest published Co-Regents and Foreign Influence in Germany, a pamphlet that greatly angered his family; though produced anonymously, no one doubted that it was written by Ernest. It attacked Vicky as a disloyal German that was too dependent on her mother, and declared that she had been too indiscreet in passing along confidential information during both war and peacetime. Queen Victoria was furious, writing to Vicky, [...] "What you told me of Uncle E and that pamphlet is simply monstrous. <b>I</b> <b>assure</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I felt great difficulty in writing to him for his birthday, but I wrote it as short and cool as I could consistently with civility". [...] "Dear Uncle Ernest does us all a great deal of harm by his odd ways and uncontrollable tongue with his very lively imagination".|$|E

[...] As all men are subject to wrong, I cannot but say that the principle is likewise inherent in me. [...] I acknowledge myself guilty in regard of many of my slaves, but I call God to witness to my innocence in respect to the murder of Prosper. [...] I am sensible that the country thirsts for my blood, and I am ready to sacrifice it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the match, Willard {{was quoted}} as saying, [...] "Dempsey is a {{remarkable}} hitter. It {{was the first time}} that I had ever been knocked off my feet. I have sent many birds home in the same bruised condition that I am in, and now I know how they felt. I sincerely wish Dempsey all the luck possible and hope that he garnishes all the riches that comes with the championship. I have had my fling with the title. I was champion for four years and <b>I</b> <b>assure</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> they'll never have to give a benefit for me. I have invested the money I have made". [...] Willard later claimed to have been defeated by [...] "gangsterism".|$|E

2500|$|During {{the siege}} of Nan Commandery, Zhou Yu ordered Gan Ning to lead a {{detachment}} {{to take control of}} Yiling (夷陵; present-day Yichang, Hubei), but Gan Ning came under attack by a separate enemy force led by Cao Ren's subordinates. When Gan Ning sent a messenger to Zhou Yu's camp to request for relief forces, most of Sun Quan's officers saw {{that they did not have}} enough men to spare, so they refused to help Gan Ning. Lü Meng, however, insisted on saving Gan Ning. He told Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu, [...] "I suggest we leave Ling Tong behind while I follow you to help Gan Ning. It's imperative that we lift the siege (on Gan Ning) because he may not be able to hold out for long. <b>I</b> <b>assure</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> Ling Tong can defend our current position for at least ten days." ...|$|E
2500|$|Guan Yu {{claimed he}} had 30,000 troops. He {{selected}} 5,000 elite soldiers, headed to the upstream shallows located some 10 li away from Yiyang, and planned to cross the shallows at night. Lu Su held a discussion with his subordinates {{on how to deal}} with Guan Yu. At the time, Gan Ning had only 300 men under him and he told Lu Su, [...] "If you give me another 500 troops, I'll go to confront Guan Yu. <b>I</b> <b>assure</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> Guan Yu will not dare to cross the waters when he hears of my approach. But if he does, I'll capture him." [...] Lu Su then chose 1,000 troops and put them under Gan Ning's command. Gan Ning headed towards Guan Yu's position at night. As Gan Ning expected, Guan Yu did not cross the shallows and instead set up camps there. That place was thus named 'Guan Yu's Shallows' (關羽瀨).|$|E
2500|$|As soon as {{the victory}} of the Popular Front in the {{elections}} became known I, already an elect member of Parliament, showed up at the prison of Oviedo the next morning, went {{to the office of the}} Director, who had fled in a mad panic because he had behaved like a genuine criminal toward the Asturian prisoners interned after the revolution of October 1934, and there I found the Administrator to whom I said, [...] "Give me the keys because the prisoners must be released this very day." [...] He replied, [...] "I have not received any orders", and I answered, [...] "I am a member of the Republic's Parliament, and I demand that you hand over the keys immediately to set the prisoners free." [...] He handed them over and <b>I</b> <b>assure</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> it was the most thrilling day of my activist life, opening the cells and shouting, [...] "Comrades, everyone get out!"
