5|$|Braille {{had always}} been a sickly child, and <b>his</b> <b>condition</b> worsened in adulthood. A {{persistent}} respiratory illness, long believed to be tuberculosis, dogged him, and by the age of forty, he was forced to relinquish his position as a teacher. Despite the lack of a cure at the time, Braille lived with the illness for 16 years. When <b>his</b> <b>condition</b> reached mortal danger, he was admitted to the infirmary at the Royal Institution, where he died in 1852, two days after he had reached the age of forty-three.|$|E

5|$|In 1937, Ravel {{began to}} suffer pain from <b>his</b> <b>condition,</b> and was {{examined}} by Clovis Vincent, a well-known Paris neurosurgeon. Vincent advised surgical treatment. He thought a tumour unlikely, {{and expected to}} find ventricular dilatation that surgery might prevent from progressing. Ravel's brother Edouard accepted this advice; as Henson comments, the patient was in no state to express a considered view. After the operation {{there seemed to be}} an improvement in <b>his</b> <b>condition,</b> but it was short-lived, and he soon lapsed into a coma. He died on 28 December, at the age of 62.|$|E

5|$|Wilson {{was kept}} secluded {{by his wife}} and {{personal}} physician and only his close advisers were allowed to see him; none would divulge official information on <b>his</b> <b>condition.</b> Although Marshall sought to meet with Wilson to personally determine <b>his</b> <b>condition,</b> {{he was unable to}} do so, and relied on vague updates he received through a few bulletins published by Wilson's physician. Believing that Wilson and his advisers would not voluntarily transfer power to the vice president, a group of Congressional leaders initiated Marshall's requested joint resolution. The senators opposed to the League of Nations treaty, however, believed that as president Marshall would make several key concessions that would allow the treaty to win ratification. Wilson, in his present condition, was either unwilling or unable to make the concessions, and debate on the bill had resulted in a deadlock. In order to prevent the treaty's ratification, the anti-League senators blocked the joint resolution.|$|E

Major Jason Johnston, a Marine Corps spokesman at The Pentagon, was unable to comment on Gale's discharge.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the campaign, Galland {{claimed to}} be {{suffering}} from rheumatism and therefore unfit for flying in open-cockpit aircraft, such as the Hs 123. He tactfully suggested a transfer to a single-engine aircraft type with a closed cockpit would improve <b>his</b> <b>condition.</b> His request was accepted on medical grounds. Galland was removed from his post as a direct ground support pilot. Galland never explained whether open cockpits had caused the complaint or some other cause; given his performance with eye specialists, a certain amount of suspicion is reasonable. He was transferred to Jagdgeschwader 27 (JG 27—Fighter Wing 27) on 10 February 1940 as the adjutant, restricting him from flying.|$|E

5|$|By 1588, Gebhard's {{joint pain}} (Gelenkenschmerz) {{prevented}} him from riding a horse; the climate of Cologne, damp and cold, made <b>his</b> <b>condition</b> worse, so he relinquished his claim on the Electorate {{to the protection of}} Adolf von Neuenahr and Martin Schenck, which they pursued until their deaths later that year. In the summer 1588, Gebhard established his residence at Strassburg, where he had held the office of dean of the cathedral since 1574and had maintained it concurrently with his position in Cologne.|$|E
