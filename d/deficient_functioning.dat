40|$|The {{content of}} this thesis {{can be divided}} into two broad topics. The first half investigates the {{deficient}} values and <b>deficient</b> <b>functions</b> of certain classes of meromorphic functions. Here a value is called <b>deficient</b> if a <b>function</b> takes that value less often than it takes most other values. It is shown that the derivative of a periodic meromorphic function has no finite non-zero deficient values, provided that the function satisfies a necessary growth condition. The classes B and S consist of those meromorphic functions for which the finite critical and asymptotic values form a bounded or finite set. A number of results are obtained about the conditions under which members of the classes B and S and their derivatives may admit rational, or slowly-growing transcendental, <b>deficient</b> <b>functions.</b> The second major topic is a study of real functions [...] those functions which are real on the real axis. Some generalisations are given of a theorem due to Hinkkanen and Rossi that characterizes a class of real meromorphic functions having only real zeroes, poles and critical points. In particular, the assumption that the zeroes are real is discarded, although this condition reappears as a conclusion in one result. Real entire functions are the subject of the final chapter, which builds upon the recent resolution of a long-standing conjecture attributed to Wiman. In this direction, several conditions are established under which a real entire function must belong to the classical Laguerre-Polya class LP. These conditions typically involve the non-real zeroes of the function and its derivatives...|$|R

40|$|Musician's {{dystonia}} (MD) is a task-specific {{movement disorder}} {{characterized by a}} loss of voluntary motor control in highly trained movements like piano playing. Its underlying pathophysiology is defined by <b>deficient</b> <b>functioning</b> of neural pathways {{at different levels of}} the central nervous system.

We recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) in professional pianists during the performance of memorized music sequences at fast tempi. Event-related potentials (ERPs) locked to pitch errors were investigated in MD and a control group. In MD patients, significantly larger error-related brain responses before and following errors were observed as compared with healthy pianists.

40|$|The {{effects of}} in vitro {{recombinant}} interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) treatment on lymphocyte proliferation and Natural Killer (NK) cell activity inhibited by cocaine were examined. In lymphocytes activated by PHA (2 mug/ml), cocaine induced {{a decrease of}} [H- 3]-thymidine incorporation at the drug concentrations presented {{in the blood of}} addicts (0. 1 mug/ml).

Indeed fast spectral activity derived during numerous experimental paradigms has been interpreted as providing support for the functional importance of these signals. The present review provides an overview of findings demonstrating direct or indirect associations between GBA and behavioral measures of task performance or perceptual experience in humans. While the majority of papers have focused on perception and awareness, relationships between GBA and behavior have also been observed during insightful problem solving, short- or long-term memory, and motor tasks. In these studies, GBA was reported to predict behavioral measures such as correct response rates or reaction times both in healthy subjects and patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. The review demonstrates that there is increasingly strong evidence for a close association between GBA during both perceptual and cognitive tasks and behavioral outcome measures. With this in mind, the investigation of GBA might help elucidate the mechanisms underlying <b>deficient</b> <b>functioning</b> in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders...|$|E

40|$|Background: Although the {{overwhelming}} majority of Iranian adolescents are well-adjusted, a substantial group exhibits high levels of maladjustment and <b>deficient</b> <b>functioning.</b> Escalation of criminal violence among the youth population has become a major public policy issue and a serious public health problem. In reviewing a 10 -year literature, this article aimed to describe and propose primary assumptions regarding the correlates of aggressive and violent behaviors in Iranian adolescents and youth. Methods: Bibliographic databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar along with Iranian databases including PubMed, IranMedex, Magiran, Irandoc, Psychoinfo, and Emrofor Scientific Information Database, and Magiran constituted the databases which we searched for the relevant literature. Overall 98 articles met the inclusion criteria, allowing us to initiate the discussion. Results: Reportedly, prevalence of violence and aggression among the Iranian adolescents and youth ranged from 30 % to 65. 5 % while males being 2 ΍ times more affected than females. The role of gender, family environment, family size, socioeconomic status, and victimization in perpetuating the circumstances was apparent. Conclusions: Relatively high prevalence of violence and aggression among Iranian youth and adolescents is a warning sign and a great challenge to the social system.

We recorded magnetoencephalography (MEG) during a somatosensory Go/NoGo task in 6 -year-old children born EPT (n = 22) and in children born full term (FT; n = 21). The children received tactile stimuli randomly to their left little (target) and index (non-target) finger and {{were instructed to}} squeeze a soft toy with the opposite hand every time they felt a stimulus on the little finger. Behaviorally, the EPT children performed worse than the FT children, both {{in responding to the}} target finger stimulation and in refraining from responding to the non-target finger stimulation. In MEG, after the non-target finger stimulation (i. e., during the response inhibition), the sensorimotor alpha oscillation levels in the contralateral-to-squeeze hemisphere were elevated in the FT children when compared with a condition with corresponding stimulation but no task (instead the children were listening to a story and not attending to the fingers). This NoGo task effect was absent in the EPT children. Further, in the sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the tactile stimulation, the post stimulus suppression was less pronounced in the EPT than FT children. We suggest that the missing NoGo task effect and lower suppression of sensorimotor oscillations are markers of <b>deficient</b> <b>functioning</b> of the sensorimotor networks in the EPT children.

Twelve dyslexic and 13 nondyslexic adults performed a lexical decision task while stimuli were presented unimodally (either aurally or visually) or bimodally (audiovisually simultaneously). The behavioral data collected during the experiment evidenced more accurate processing for bimodally than for unimodally presented stimuli irrespective of group. Words were processed faster than pseudowords. Notably, no group differences have been found for either accuracy or for reaction times. With respect to brain responses, nondyslexic compared to dyslexic adults elicited stronger hemodynamic responses in the leftward supramarginal gyrus (SMG), {{as well as in the}} right hemispheric superior temporal sulcus (STS). Furthermore, dyslexic compared to nondyslexic adults showed reduced responses to only aurally presented signals and enhanced hemodynamic responses to audiovisual, as well as visual stimulation in the right anterior insula. Our behavioral results evidence that the two groups easily identified the two-syllabic proper nouns that we provided them with. Our fMRI results indicate that dyslexics show less neuronal involvement of heteromodal and extrasylvian regions, namely, the STS, SMG, and insula when decoding phonological information. We posit that dyslexic adults evidence <b>deficient</b> <b>functioning</b> of word processing, which could possibly be attributed to deficits in phoneme to grapheme mapping.

40|$|AIM: To date, the {{understanding}} {{and development of}} novel treatments for mental illness is hampered by inadequate animal models. For instance, it is unclear to what extent commonly used behavioural tests in animals can inform us on the mental and affective aspects of schizophrenia. METHODS: To link pathophysiological processes in an animal model to clinical findings, we have here utilized the recently developed Df(h 15 q 13) /+ mouse model for detailed investigations of cortical neuronal engagement during pre-attentive processing of auditory information from two back-translational auditory paradigms. We also investigate if compromised putative fast-spiking interneurone (FSI) function can be restored through pharmacological intervention using the Kv 3. 1 channel opener RE 1. Chronic multi-array electrodes in primary auditory cortex were used to record single cell firing from putative pyramidal and FSI in awake animals during processing of auditory sensory information. RESULTS: We find a decreased amplitude in the response to auditory stimuli and reduced recruitment of neurones to fast steady-state gamma oscillatory activity. These results resemble encephalography recordings in patients with schizophrenia. Furthermore, the probability of interneurones to fire with low interspike intervals during 80 Hz auditory stimulation was reduced in Df(h 15 q 13) /+ mice, an effect that was partially reversed by the Kv 3. 1 channel modulator, RE 1. CONCLUSIONS: This study offers insight into the consequences on a neuronal level of carrying the 15 q 13. 3 microdeletion. Furthermore, it points to <b>deficient</b> <b>functioning</b> of interneurones as a potential pathophysiological mechanism in schizophrenia and suggests a therapeutic potential of Kv 3. 1 channel openers...|$|E
40|$|The gold {{standard}} {{of a successful}} amblyopia treatment is full recovery of visual acuity (VA) in the amblyopic eye, {{but there has been}} no systematic study on both monocular and binocular visual functions. In this research, we aimed to quantify visual qualities with a variety of perceptual tasks in subjects with treated amblyopia. We found near stereoacuity and pAE dominance in binocular rivalry in "treated" amblyopia were largely comparable to those of normal subjects. CSF of the pAE remained deficient in high spatial frequencies. The binocular contrast summation ratio is significantly lower than normal standard. The interocular balance point is 34 %, indicating that contrast in pAE is much less effective as the same contrast in pFE in binocular phase combination. Although VA, stereoacuity and binocular rivalry at low spatial frequency in treated amblyopes were normal or nearly normal, the pAE remained "lazy" in high frequency domain, binocular contrast summation, and interocular phase combination.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Major {{depression}} {{is a common}} disorder but the pathophysiology is poorly understood. Current hypotheses implicate <b>deficient</b> <b>function</b> of brain serotonin pathways because drugs that selectively increase brain serotonin activity are effective antidepressants. However, {{there is no direct}} evidence that lowered serotonin function causes major depression. We aimed to assess whether lowering of brain serotonin activity by depletion of its amino acid precursor, tryptophan, could provoke a short-term relapse of clinically significant symptoms in women vulnerable to major depressive disorder. METHODS: We studied 15 women who had suffered recurrent episodes of major depression but had recovered and were no longer on drug treatment. Patients received two amino acid mixtures in a double-blind crossover design. One of the mixtures was nutritionally balanced and contained tryptophan and the other was identical except it contained no tryptophan. Participants were scored on the Hamilton rating scale for depression (HAMD) before and 7 h after drinking each mixture. They also completed hourly self-rated measures of mood during this period. Blood samples were also taken at baseline and 7 h for measurement of plasma tryptophan. FINDINGS: The tryptophan-free mixture produced a 75 % reduction in plasma tryptophan concentration. After drinking the tryptophan-free mixture, ten of the 15 women experienced temporary but clinically significant depressive symptoms. The mean difference in total HAMD scores (7 h minus baseline) were significantly higher after the tryptophan-free mixture than after the nutritionally balanced mixture (7. 3 vs 0. 15 [95 % CI 4. 5 - 9. 9]; p < 0. 001). No changes in mood were seen after taking the nutritionally balanced mixture. INTERPRETATION: We conclude that rapid lowering of brain serotonin function can precipitate clinical depressive symptoms in well, untreated individuals who are vulnerable to major depressive disorder. The findings support a key role for <b>deficient</b> serotonin <b>function</b> in the aetiology of depression...|$|R

40|$|Fabry disease (FD) {{is one of}} the X-linked {{lysosomal}} storage disorders {{caused by}} <b>deficient</b> <b>functioning</b> of the alpha-galactosidase A (a-GalA) enzyme. The a-GalA deficiency leads to multi-systemic clinical manifestations caused by the preferential accumulation of globotriaosylceramide in the endothelium and vascular smooth muscles. A hallmark symptom of FD patients is peripheral pain that appears in the early stage of the disease. Pain in FD patients is a peripheral small-fiber idiopathic neuropathy, with intra-epidermal fiber density and integrity being used for diagnosing FD in humans. However, the molecular correlates underlying pain sensation in FD remain elusive. Here, we have employed the a-GalA gene KO mouse as a model of FD in rodents to investigate molecular changes in their peripheral nervous system that may account for their algesic symptoms. The a-GalA null mice display neuropathic pain as evidenced by thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia, with histological analyses showing alterations in cutaneous innervation. Additionally, KO mice showed a decreased and scattered pattern of neuronal terminations consistent with the reduction in neuronal terminations in skin biopsies of patients with small fiber neuropathies. At the molecular level KO animals showed an increase in the expression of TRPV 1 and Nav 1. 8, and a decrease in the expression of TRPM 8. Notably, these alterations are observed in young animals. Taken together, our findings imply that the a-GalA KO mouse is a good model in which to study the peripheral small fiber neuropathy exhibited by FD patients, and provides molecular evidence for a hyperexcitability of smal...|$|E

Mitochondrial {{diseases}} (MD) are a wide {{group of}} disorders which recognize at their origin a <b>deficient</b> <b>function</b> of the respiratory chain and secondary energy reduction in cells. Aim {{of this study}} was to evaluate, in 8 patients affected by different forms of MD, the levels of human mitochondrial transcription factor A (h-mtTFA) in skeletal muscle. H-mtTFA is a 25 -KDa nuclear-encoded polypeptide, which plays a relevant role in both replication and transcription of mitochondrial DNA genes. Materials and methods. Eight patients with different forms of MD underwent complete neurological assessment, along with determination of exercise lactate anerobic threshold (LT). Muscle biopsy was performed for histological and histochemical analysis and h-mtTFA level assessment by Western blot. Results. Muscle h-mtTFA levels were significantly reduced in the patients in comparison with a group of controls. The degree of h-mtTFA reduction was related to the LT and the percentage of type 1 fibers with oxidative defects at histochemistry. No correlation between h-mtTFA levels and RRF or COX negative fibers was observed. Conclusions. These results suggest that alterations of the h-mtTFA turnover may be implicated in the pathogenesis of mitochondrial dysfunction in MD patients...|$|R
30|$|A common ongoing {{cause of}} {{suffering}} and disability in bipolar disorder is residual symptoms, usually either minor or subsyndromal depression (Strakowski 2007); it is for these symptoms that augmentation with another agent such an AAP is often attempted but {{for which there is}} virtually no data. Aripiprazole has a unique pharmacological mode of action that differs from current antipsychotics. It is a partial agonist that modulates dopamine activity (Yatham et al. 2005). Aripiprazole acts as a functional antagonist in a hyperdopaminergic environment and a functional agonist in a hypodopaminergic environment (Keck and McElroy 2003). There is evidence that bipolar disorder is associated with an alteration of the dopaminergic system, with increased dopamine function in mania and <b>deficient</b> <b>function</b> in depression (Keck and McElroy 2003). As a partial D 2 receptor agonist, aripiprazole may therefore be well placed to correct both a functional deficiency and overactivity. Moreover, aripiprazole is also an antagonist at serotonin 5 -HT 2 A receptors, a partial agonist at 5 -HT 1 A receptors and an inhibitor of the 5 -HT transporter (Yatham et al. 2005). These properties of aripiprazole have been hypothesised to mediate its putative antidepressant effects.|$|R

However, the {{mechanisms by which}} transplanted cells engraft, proliferate, and function remain unknown. To investigate whether host liver sinusoidal endothelium could be replaced with transplanted liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, we developed an animal model of tissue replacement that utilized a genetic system to identify transplanted cells and induced host-cell perturbations to confer a proliferative advantage to transplanted cells. Under these experimental conditions, transplanted cells engrafted efficiently and proliferated to replace substantial portions of the liver endothelium. Tissue studies demonstrated that transplanted cells became integral to the liver structure and reacquired characteristic endothelial morphology. Characterization of transplanted endothelial cells by membrane markers and studies of cellular function, including synthesis and release of coagulation factor VIII, demonstrated that transplanted cells were functionally intact. Further analysis showed that repopulation of the livers of mice that model hemophilia A with healthy endothelial cells restored plasma factor VIII activity and corrected their bleeding phenotype. Our studies therefore suggest that transplantation of healthy endothelial cells should be considered for cell therapy of relevant disorders and that endothelial reconstitution with transplanted cells may offer an excellent paradigm for defining organ-specific pathophysiological mechanisms...|$|R
