Malek said of Halloween Returns: [...] "Although, I have to say, and this is somewhat new news, but unfortunately things happen in Hollywood where you have issues with studios and different variables. We've had {{to take a step back}} and now we’re trying to re-figure this beast that is the new Halloween. So there is a bit of a delay, but this new Halloween isn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> what has been announced and what people are expecting, so we're making some changes there as well." ...|$|E
500|$|As the Bosnian War {{ended in}} 1995 and the Siege of Sarajevo in 1996, the {{stability}} of the region began to improve. Realizing this, U2 began to plan a concert for Sarajevo that would take place on their 1997 PopMart Tour. Although they were the first major musical artist to perform in the city following the war, China Drum had played a concert in July 1996. Music journalist Andrew Mueller described China Drum's experience in a single van as a [...] "logistical and administrative nightmare". Muhamed Sacirbey, the Bosnian Ambassador to the United Nations, helped U2 make arrangements, playing an informal role as promoter and organizer. McGuinness said, [...] "We thought it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> difficult. But it's been quite straightforward. People have just wanted to help. We've blagged a lot of equipment, forklifts and so on, from the military, and the local crew have been incredibly supportive." ...|$|E
500|$|Mercedes and Riley reunite {{but when}} she discovers Riley does not love her she kidnaps Bobby in revenge and blames it on a Mitzeee, who has {{recently}} escaped from prison. Metcalfe said Mercedes does not have [...] "any regrets whatsoever. I think she does what she does at {{the time for a}} reason and she'll deal with the consequences later". Mercedes is arrested when Myra reports her to the police. Riley is shortly after shot dead. Mercedes is put on trial for two counts of perverting the course of justice, one for the kidnap and one for stabbing herself. Digital Spy's Kilkelly reported that Mercedes lawyer Jim McGinn (Dan Tetsell) would advise Mercedes to blame Riley for the crimes as he can not defend himself. Mercedes reluctantly agrees and tells the courtroom that Riley stabbed her and was abusive towards her. Metcalfe felt the scenes were [...] "great to film", adding that [...] "the writers came up with some brilliant material". However, she felt the scenes were [...] "challenging" [...] to film as Mercedes [...] "completely breaks down and says how bad Riley was. From the audience's point of view, it's really <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> shocking". The actress added that Mercedes [...] "does feel guilty about it, but only as guilty as Mercedes can ever feel. So she gets over it very quickly!" [...] During the trial Jim suggests that Riley killed Lynsey and that Doctor Browning is innocent. Doctor Browning appears at the trial to give evidence, which Metcalfe revealed is [...] "a total surprise. I don't think she knows how she'll react until she actually sees him, and when she does they're back in that moment when he was dragged away from her. She really did fall for him hook, line and sinker".|$|E

2500|$|On July 19, Manson {{announced}} that the band's tenth studio album had the working title SAY10, and predicted a release date of Valentine's Day 2017. In September, Manson confirmed that the band were [...] "putting the finishing touches" [...] on the album, and said: [...] "It's not very much in any way like The Pale Emperor. It's pretty violent in its nature for some reason, and it's not emotional in the same way. It's got a chip on its shoulder. I can't wait for people to hear it. I think they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> surprised." [...] On November 8 – {{the day of the}} 2016 US presidential election – Manson released a teaser clip of a new music video, which featured scenes of Manson brandishing a knife while standing over a decapitated corpse, which is dressed to resemble Donald Trump. The video was created alongside Final Girl director Tyler Shields.|$|E
2500|$|Series {{executive}} {{producers and}} co-creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk stated that, {{as with the}} second season, [...] "many actors" [...] would return for the third season in different roles. Jessica Lange, Evan Peters and Sarah Paulson all confirmed their returns. Murphy added that Lange would portray a [...] "real glamour-cat lady", whose name was later revealed to be Fiona Goode. Paulson {{said in an interview}} that her character would [...] "definitely [...] different [...]" [...] She added, [...] "Basically, she's going to look different, and my relationship to Lange is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> different this time. At the beginning of last season, no one knew that Lana would be the hero, so it's possible I could end up the evil one this year. As of right now, there will be some of Lana Winters' qualities in my character, but I don't know for sure." [...] Taissa Farmiga, who played a lead role in the first season, starred as Zoe Benson, a character involved in a prominent romance with Peters' character. Lily Rabe and Frances Conroy portrayed series regulars Misty Day and Myrtle Snow, respectively. Kathy Bates co-starred as Delphine LaLaurie, an evil woman from the past who tortures her slaves. Murphy stated that Bates' character would be [...] "five times worse than [...] Misery character" [...] and is also inspired by a [...] "true event". It was reported on May 22, 2013 that Emma Roberts would co-star as Madison Montgomery, a difficult Hollywood starlet.|$|E

2500|$|Like SN2 {{reaction}}s, {{there are}} quite a few factors that affect the reaction rate of SN1 reactions. [...] Instead of having two concentrations that affect the reaction rate, there is only one, substrate. [...] The rate equation for this would be Rate=k. [...] Since the rate of a reaction is only determined by its slowest step, the rate at which the leaving group [...] "leaves" [...] determines the speed of the reaction. [...] This means that the better the leaving group, the faster the reaction rate. [...] A general rule for what makes a good leaving group is the weaker the conjugate base, the better the leaving group. [...] In this case, halogens are going to be the best leaving groups, while compounds such as amines, hydrogen, and alkanes are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> poor leaving groups. [...] As SN2 reactions were affected by sterics, SN1 reactions are determined by bulky groups attached to the carbocation. [...] Since there is an intermediate that actually contains a positive charge, bulky groups attached are going to help stabilize the charge on the carbocation through resonance and distribution of charge. [...] In this case, tertiary carbocation will react faster than a secondary which will react much faster than a primary. [...] It is also due to this carbocation intermediate that the product does not have to have inversion. [...] The nucleophile can attack from the top or the bottom and therefore create a racemic product. [...] It is important to use a protic solvent, water and alcohols, since an aprotic solvent could attack the intermediate and cause unwanted product. [...] It does not matter if the hydrogens from the protic solvent react with the nucleophile since the nucleophile is not involved in the rate determining step.|$|E

40|$|Urban {{wind power}} is not too {{developed}} yet. Only some years ago some countries started <b>to</b> <b>be</b> aware of the important source of energy {{that can be used}} within built-up areas. The U. K., the Netherland, France and Italy are already working on it, but they are still far away to reach models and equations that can be useful for any situation. An urban turbine <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> installed in Gävle, Sweden, in the roof of Polhemsskolan. Therefore, the wind velocity should <b>be</b> found out <b>to</b> come up with some results about the energy yield. But some problems appear when try to estimate that velocity. To calculate this velocity three different ways can be used. They are Mathematical models, Measurements and Simulations or Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) calculations. All of them <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> difficult <b>to</b> use. Both mathematical models and CFD are very expensive as well as they need too much time to give a result. In addition, the area where the rotor <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> installed <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> strange and therefore, it is even more difficult to put all the data in the mathematical model or CFD. On the other hand, measurements <b>were</b> almost impossible <b>to</b> carry on. The measurement of the wind velocity should be done during one year due to the big differences in that value depending on the season; winter, summer [...] . depending on the weather; cloudy, sunny and so on.
