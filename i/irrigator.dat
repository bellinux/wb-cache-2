40|$|In Australia {{there is}} a growing {{awareness}} that the over-allocation of water entitlements to <b>irrigators</b> needs to be reduced so that environmental flow allocations can be increased. This means that some water will need to be acquired from <b>irrigators</b> and returned to the environment. Most current water reform policies assume that <b>irrigators</b> are solely motivated by profit and will be willing sellers of water, but this might be an untenable approach. Authorities will need to consider new ways of encouraging the participation of <b>irrigators</b> in water reform. The main aim of this research was to identify the non-commercial influences acting on irrigators' behaviour, especially the influence of the values that they hold toward family, land, water, community and lifestyle. The study also aimed to investigate whether it is possible to group <b>irrigators</b> according to these values and then use the groupings to describe how these might affect their willingness to participate in environmental reforms. We clustered the <b>irrigators</b> into three groups with differing orientations; (i) Investors [25 %]—profit oriented, (ii) Lifestylers [25 %]–lifestyle oriented, (iii) Providers [50 %]–family-succession oriented.

25|$|The center-pivot {{irrigation}} system {{is considered to}} be a highly efficient system which helps conserve water. However, by 2013, as the water consumption efficiency of the center-pivot <b>irrigator</b> improved over the years, farmers chose to plant more intensively, irrigate more land, and grow thirstier crops rather than reduce water consumption. One approach to reducing the amount of groundwater used is to employ treated recycled water for irrigation; another approach is to change to crops that require less water, such as sunflowers.|$|E

The findings, allowing for state-based differentials, suggest <b>irrigators</b> marginally prefer infrastructure expenditure above the sum {{of a set of}} market-based options (namely water entitlement purchasing, temporary water market products and exit-based packages). However, their infrastructure preference weighting is less than current budget expenditure, and use of market-based options has higher support from <b>irrigators</b> than current policy recognises. Further, analysis of past and current infrastructure and market-based water recovery expenditures reveals large price-per-megalitre disparities, which may be explained by diminishing marginal returns.

The first birth and the body abound in inevitable things; for example, features, gestures aptitudes, complexions, and colours, are inherited beyond any power of perversion; but the second birth is the unfolding not of shaped and settled things but of possibilities, of extraordinarily plastic mental faculties. No doubt there are in each developing individual dispositions towards this or that--tendencies, a bias in the texture this way or that--but the form of it all is extraordinarily a matter of suggestion and the influence of deliberate and accidental moulding forces. The universal Will to live is there, peeping out at first in little curiosities, inquiries, sudden disgusts, sudden fancies, the stumbling, slow realization that for this in a mysteriously predominant way we live, and growing stronger, growing presently, in the great multitude of cases, to passionate preferences and powerful desires. This flow of sex comes like a great river athwart the plain of our personal and egoistic schemes, a great river with its rapids, with its deep and silent places, a river of uncertain droughts, a river of overwhelming floods, a river no one who would escape drowning may afford to ignore. Moreover, it is the very axis and creator of our world valley, the source of all our power in life, and the <b>irrigator</b> of all things. In the microcosm of each individual, as in the microcosm of the race, this flood is a cardinal problem.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{applied the}} social network approach to unveil the social structure underlying the members of two traditional irrigation systems (TISs) in Sonora. This research used two TIS case studies representing rural communities located in arid and semiarid lands in the Sonoran Desert region, in the northwestern part of Mexico. The <b>irrigators</b> represented a subset of rural villages where everyone knew everyone else. The theoretical framework in this study suggested that social embeddedness of the economic activities of TIS <b>irrigators</b> {{is an important factor}} supporting their local institutions. <b>Irrigators</b> who are socially embedded posses more social capital that help them in overcoming social dilemmas. Evidence of social embeddedness is theoretically incomplete when not related to a tangible dimension of the TIS's performance. This research also dealt with the difficulty of assessing the sustainability or successfulness of a TIS. The results showed that the <b>irrigators</b> sharing a rural village are entangled in a mesh of social ties developed in different social settings. The most salient variable was family; cooperative ties within the irrigation system tend to overlap more than the expected by chance with kinship relationships. Likewise, <b>irrigators</b> had a strong preference for peers geographically close or those within the same irrigation subsector.
