60|$|What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>happened?</b> Why, he was {{rolled over}} {{on to his}} feet so gently that he just gasped with surprise. It didn't seem {{possible}} that such a great paw could be so gentle.|$|E
60|$|Oh, dear! what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>happened?</b> A wasp {{flew out}} and stung her lips; then both wasp and box vanished, and May {{was left to}} cry alone, with a sharp pain in the lips that said the unkind words.|$|E
6000|$|How {{the fellow}} {{came to be}} a {{shipowner}} {{at the same time}} was quite a tale. He came out third in a home ship nearly fifteen years ago, Captain Eliott remembered, and got paid off after a bad sort of row both with his skipper and his chief. Anyway, they seemed jolly glad {{to get rid of him}} at all costs. Clearly a mutinous sort of chap. Well, he remained out here, a perfect nuisance, everlastingly shipped and unshipped, unable to keep a berth very long; pretty nigh went through every engine-room afloat belonging to the colony. Then suddenly, [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>happened,</b> Harry?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Why?' I says. 'Never you mind,' says he. 'Well, who is he?' I asks. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>happens</b> then? He <b>thinks</b> {{hard for}} a spell, rolls his eyes, and says: 'Search me. I've forgotten.' 'Know where he lives?' I asks him. 'Nope,' he says.|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> ladies?" [...] {{and she sat}} herself down, filling an arm-chair {{with her}} goodly person. [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> has <b>happened</b> to me to-day?" ...|$|R
6000|$|ALICE. 'Take care, Amy, or I shall {{begin to}} believe that your father was right. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> would <b>happen</b> if I were to leave you to him!' ...|$|R
60|$|Not {{knowing what}} to do the poor magpie had to agree, and flying back, with a heavy heart, he threw one of his young ones out of the nest. The fox seized it in his mouth and ran off in triumph, while the magpie, though deeply grieved for the loss of his little one, found some comfort in the thought that only a bird of {{extraordinary}} wisdom would have dreamed of saving the rest by the sacrifice of the one. But what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>happened?</b> Why, a few days later, Michael the fox might have been seen sitting under the very same tree, and a dreadful pang shot through the heart of the magpie as he peeped at him from a hole in the nest.|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, if you haven't {{taken any}} of Gumley's pills you don't know what you've missed," [...] went on Spud, {{with a wink}} at the others. [...] "Why, {{there was a man}} over in Rottenberg who was flat on his back with half a dozen fatal diseases. The doctors gave him just three days to live,--three days, think of it! His wife nearly cried her eyes out. Then along came this Gumley man with a trunk full of his Red Pills for Red-Blooded People. He didn't exactly know if the dying man was red-blooded or not, but he took a chance and gave the fellow sixteen pills, four after breakfast, four after dinner, four after supper and four on retiring, and the next day, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>happened?</b> That man {{got up and went to}} work, and he's been at his Job ever since." ...|$|E
60|$|What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>happened</b> this morning? Two wedding-presents arrived. The {{first was}} a very nice fish slice and fork in a case. It was from dear old Mrs. Jones Beyrick, on whom we really had no claim whatever. We all think it so kind of her, and such a nice fish-slice. The other was a {{beautiful}} travelling-bag from Uncle Arthur. Stamped in gold upon it were the letters M.C., I said, 'Oh, what a pity! They have put the wrong initials.' That made mamma laugh. I suppose one soon gets used to it. Fancy how you would feel if it were the other way about, and you changed your name to mine. They might call you Selby, but you would continue to feel Crosse. I didn't mean that for a joke, but women make jokes without intending it. The other day the curate drove up in his donkey-cart, and mother said, 'Oh, what a nice tandem!' I think that she meant to say 'turn- out'; but papa said it was the neatest thing he had heard for a long time, so mamma is very pleased, but I am sure that she does not know even now why it should be so funny.|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> has <b>happened?</b> The ground {{looks very}} much cut up," [...] {{she said in a}} {{confidential}} tone, as new to her as her previous observation of him.|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> has <b>happened</b> to Basil?" [...] asked Dorian, {{holding up}} his Burgundy against the light, and {{wondering}} how {{it was that he}} could discuss the matter so calmly.|$|R
6000|$|MRS. TWYMLEY. 'Sitting {{here by the}} fire, you and me, as one to another, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> will <b>happen</b> {{after the}} war? Are we {{to go back to}} being as we were?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{occasion}} {{seems to}} bring that something out," [...] the lawyer remarked. [...] "When I proposed the separation, and mentioned my reasons, I expected to find some difficulty in persuading Mrs. Presty {{to give up the}} adventurous journey with her daughter and her grandchild. I reminded her that she had friends in London who would receive her, and got snubbed for taking the liberty. 'I know that as well as you do. Come along--I'm ready to go with you.' It isn't agreeable to my self-esteem to own it, but I expected to hear her say that she would consent to any sacrifice for the sake of her dear daughter. No such clap-trap as that passed her lips. She owned the true motive with a superiority to cant which won my sincerest respect. 'I'll do anything,' she said, 'to baffle Herbert Linley and the spies he has set to watch us.' I can't tell you how glad I was that she had her reward on the same day. We were too late at the station, and we had to wait for the next train. And what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>happened?</b> The two scoundrels followed us instead of following Mrs. Linley! They had inquired no doubt at the livery stables where we hired the carriage--had recognized the description of us--and had taken the long journey to London for nothing. Mrs. Presty and I shook hands at the terminus the best friends that ever traveled together with the best of motives. After that, I think I deserve another glass of wine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Shot at us!" [...] {{burst out}} the ruffled Kid. [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think's</b> been <b>happening?</b> <b>Think</b> an {{aeroplane}} ran into my ear and took {{half of it}} off? Think the noise was somebody opening bottles of pop? Think those guys that sneaked off down the road was just training for a Marathon?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Thomasin here broke in, still weeping: [...] "He said he {{was only}} going on a sudden short journey; but if so why did he want so much money? O, Clym, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> will <b>happen?</b> I am afraid that you, my poor baby, will soon have no father left to you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Jimmy,' {{cried the}} Boy Novelist, 'what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> has <b>happened!</b> A black cat {{has just come}} into my apartment. I heard him mewing outside the door, and opened it, and he {{streaked}} in. And I started my new novel last night! Say, <b>you</b> <b>do</b> believe this thing of black cats bringing luck, don't you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{would have}} <b>happened</b> to me, Gracie, if I had lost belief when your mother died? I have never lost belief. Pray God I never shall!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Sean has {{deteriorated}} {{to the point}} of dementia. David is helping with his writing and deceiving the studio into thinking that Sean is still able to work. Fuzzy tries to get Howard a movie role but the producer refuses to cast him because of the rumor that he has AIDS. The same rumor got him fired from his role on Other People. Paul is back in the hospital following a seizure. David takes Sean for a walk but has to take him home when Sean urinates in a fountain at a park in front of a woman with her two young children. That night Willy catches Fuzzy checking himself for swollen glands and they talk about their fear of dying. [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>happens</b> when we die?" [...] Fuzzy asks. [...] "We get to have sex again" [...] is Willy's reply.|$|R
40|$|What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>happens</b> when we die? “Hecate is {{the goddess}} of death…” “Either you are reborn or you {{dissolve}} into nothingness…” “Maggot food!” “They go to heaven. ” These {{are only a few}} of the answers provided by CB’s friends as he mourns the death of his pet beagle. In “Dog Sees God: Confessions of a Teenage Blockhead,” an unauthorized parody of the Peanuts comic strip by Charles Schulz, playwright Bert V. Royal continues Charlie Brown’s (CB’s) story into adolescence where the beloved blockhead – an icon of American youth – encounters modern threats to childhood’s innocence. Loss of Innocence jumps into Royal’s world and explores how teenage students address alcohol, drugs, sexual activity, and prejudice on a daily basis. The project looks into our generations’ views of morality, insignificance, and rejection – hoping to bridge gaps based on religion, gender, and social differences. This poster presentation outlines Royal’s play, the SIUC staged performance, and the director’s vision that inspired the production...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do like pretty {{clothes and}} think I'd {{like to meet}} smart people. The trouble is, they would know I didn't belong where they belonged and might leave me out. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that would <b>happen,</b> Jim?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do not, I beg," [...] said Mr. Lavender, [...] "remind {{me of that}} episode. I {{sometimes}} think," [...] he went on as dreamily as his hunger would permit, [...] "that {{being forced}} to deprive oneself awakens one's worst passions; that is, of course, speaking rather as a man than a public man. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> will <b>happen,</b> Joe, when {{we are no longer}} obliged to sacrifice ourselves? ...|$|R
6000|$|While {{the family}} {{were in this}} confusion, Charlotte Lucas came {{to spend the day}} with them. She was met in the {{vestibule}} by Lydia, who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, [...] "I am glad you are come, for there is such fun here! What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> has <b>happened</b> this morning? Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> had <b>{{happened}}?</b> Why, Mr. Man's boy Tommy's dog Towser {{had happened}} along {{just in the}} nick of time, so far as I was concerned, and dear me! how he was jumping into Mr. Foxy Fox! Talk about fighting! I never heard such a row. As I afterward learned, nearly every member of our club was awakened by the racket, and you might have searched them all without finding anything like pity for Foxy.|$|R
3000|$|... ‘The lesson I {{have planned}} {{will help the}} {{children}} to use {{a wide range of}} Tough’s language functions. The Picture talk activity, which is similar to Newstelling, encourages the children to report on past and present experiences, and also projecting and predicting (e.g. ‘How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> the shells feel when they get washed up on the beach?’ ‘What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> would <b>happen</b> if there were a creature living in the shell and it got washed up on the beach?’). Through questioning the children they may use many of Tough’s language functions.|$|R
60|$|When {{he reached}} the tall hickory tree, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> was <b>happening?</b> Why, those big, fat nuts were {{rattling}} {{down to the ground}} on every side, just as if Old Mother West Wind was shaking the tree as hard as she could. But Old Mother West Wind wasn't there at all. No, Sir, there wasn't even one of the Merry Little Breezes up in the tree-tops. The big fat nuts were rattling down just on account of the dreadful quarrel of Striped Chipmunk's two foolish cousins, Happy Jack and Chatterer.|$|R

40|$|We {{covered the}} {{following}} in class: • www shows a power law degree distribution • The exponential vs polynomial drop makes a large difference: Number of hubs. • Log-log plots {{are useful in}} seeing power law, but should be used with care • The mean of power law is finite iff α> 2. • Preferential attachment mechanism and model • power law can arise from other types of optimization and heuristics There are two ways of writing the power law (see [Kempe, 2011]). Suppose X is the variable in question, then: • Pr[X ≥ x] = cx−α OR • Pr[X = x] = c′x−α′ Exercise 0. 1. Express (c′, α′) in terms of (c, α) and vice versa. * Exercise 0. 2. Show that preferential attachment networks have small diameter. (Take all edges as undirected.) * Exercise 0. 3. Do preferential attachment networks have expansion above a constant? (Take all edges as undirected.) * Exercise 0. 4. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>happens</b> to diameter and expansion in real world power law networks? Exercise 0. 5. It is the in-degrees of nodes in www that are expected of have power law distribu-tion. The code we tried in class took all degrees. Write your version to plot the in-degrees...|$|R
6000|$|On {{the last}} {{afternoon}} of their stay, she strolled {{out with him}} {{through one of the}} long woods that stretched away behind their hotel. Excited by the coming end of her self-inflicted penance, moved by the beauty among those sunlit trees, she found it difficult to talk. But Winton, about to lose her, was quite loquacious. Starting from the sinister change in the racing-world--so plutocratic now, with the American seat, the increase of bookmaking owners, and other tragic occurrences--he launched forth into a jeremiad on the condition of things in general. Parliament, he thought, especially now that members were paid, had lost its self-respect; the towns had eaten up the country; hunting was threatened; the power and vulgarity of the press were appalling; women had lost their heads; and everybody seemed afraid of having any [...] "breeding." [...] By the time little Gyp was Gyp's age, they would all be under the thumb of Watch Committees, live in Garden Cities, and have to account for every half-crown they spent, and every half-hour of their time; the horse, too, would be an extinct animal, brought out once a year at the lord-mayor's show. He hoped--the deuce--he might not be alive to see it. And suddenly he added: [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>happens</b> after death, Gyp?" ...|$|R
30|$|Personality was {{assessed}} among 79 adolescents {{at one point}} in time using the NEO Personality Inventory—Revised (NEO-PI-R) and the temperament and character inventory (TCI). Six months later, adolescents were asked to write down the most positive or the most negative event that had happened to them in the last 3  months. Adolescents were explicitly instructed to answer the following questions within their narratives: What happened? Who were involved? Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> it <b>happened?</b> How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> feel when it <b>happened?</b> How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> the involved persons felt? The descriptions were quantified using a computational method in which the latent semantic analysis algorithm generates a semantic representation of the narratives.|$|R

[...] "I feel it give a little," [...] said he; [...] "but, though I am exceptionally {{strong in the}} fingers, {{it would take me}} all my time to break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> would <b>happen</b> if I did break it, Mr. Holder?

6000|$|Robert's journey was, however, fixed {{for that}} day, {{and on this}} plea, licence was given for the walk. Phoebe smiled congratulation, but Maria was slow in cheering up; and when, on {{returning}} to the schoolroom, the three sisters were left alone together for a few moments, she pressed up to Phoebe's side, and said, 'Phoebe, I've not said my prayers. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> anything will <b>happen</b> to me?' ...|$|R
5000|$|In October 2007 Final Fantasy {{released}} a vinyl 7" [...] on Tomlab's Alphabet Single series ( [...] The Letter [...] "X" [...] ). The two tracks on [...] "X", recorded in Montreal with Zach Condon, {{of the band}} Beirut; predate the album He Poos Clouds. The tracks - [...] "Hey Dad" [...] and [...] "What <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Think</b> Will <b>Happen</b> Next?" [...] are both played regularly at live shows. The song [...] "Hey Dad" [...] contains a melody borrowed from the Nintendo video game [...] "Super Mario Bros. 3"; specifically it is the music from the [...] "Coin Heaven" [...] bonus/hidden stages. Also, the song is quite similar in melody, lyrics and tone to another of Pallett's songs - [...] "→".|$|R

5000|$|According {{to several}} accounts, Prudence Bushnell, U.S. Ambassador to Kenya, {{repeatedly}} asked Washington for additional {{security at the}} embassy in Nairobi, including in an April 1998 letter directly to Albright. Bushnell was ignored. She later stated that when she spoke to Albright about the letter, she told her {{that it had not}} been shown to her. In Against All Enemies, Richard Clarke writes about an exchange with Albright several months after the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were bombed in August 1998. [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> will <b>happen</b> if <b>you</b> lose another embassy?" [...] Clarke asked. [...] "The Republicans in Congress will go after you."

I couldn't go home and take it easy--you bet not. I just want to shake hands with myself when I think that I've got a home, and a job like this. I know a feller--a hard worker he was, too who walked the pavements for three months when the Colvers failed, and couldn't get nothing, and took to drink, and the last I heard of him he was sleeping in police stations and walking the ties, and his wife's a waitress at a cheap hotel.

3000|$|Description {{of a life}} event The affect, intentionality, {{effort and}} {{adaptation}} to a life event measure (Garcia 2012 b; Garcia and Sikström 2013) was used to ask participants to recollect and then write down at random either the most positive or the most negative event in their life during the last 3  months (see Suh et al. 1996, who show that only writing about life events within the last 3  months influence happiness and well-being significantly). In the positive condition, participants are specifically asked to describe the most positive event during the last 3  months that to the greatest degree has enhanced their happiness. In contrast, in the negative condition, participants are asked for the most negative event in their life during the last 3  months that to the greatest degree had decreased their happiness. Both conditions instruct participants {{to answer the following}} questions when describing the event: What happened? Who were involved? Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> it <b>happened?</b> How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> feel when it <b>happened?</b> How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> the involved persons felt? [...]...|$|R
