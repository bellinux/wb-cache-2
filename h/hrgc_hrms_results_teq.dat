40|$|A proper {{understanding}} of physiological mechanisms for the propulsion of ingested food within the gastrointestinal canal is mandatory for {{the diagnosis of}} pathologies affecting its motility. One of the most discussed regions within the digestive system is the esophagus, as a tubular structure whose function pertains to bring food from mouth to stomach {{by means of a}} precise sequence of longitudinal and circumferential muscular contractions, called peristalsis. Pathologies and degenerative phenomena may influence this mechanism, leading to chest pain, acid reflux, cancer development and/or inability to swallow. As a growing number of subjects suffer from esophageal motility disorders, it represent a relevant social-health problem. The diagnosis of esophageal motility disorders is actually performed by analyzing results from High Resolution Manometry (HRM), the gold standard in esophageal diagnostics. HRM consists in a clinical test designed to measure the pressure evolution over time at different positions within a duct by means of a special probe. A number of models have been proposed in literature to interpret data from <b>HRM,</b> but <b>results</b> are often inadequate because of an improper evaluation of the complex esophageal conformation and the corresponding heterogeneous distribution of physio-mechanical properties. Furthermore, an inadequate effort was made to identify relationships between model parameters and esophageal properties, and their identification was usually performed accounting for limited sets of experimental data. The guidelines in diagnosis of esophageal motility disorders are currently defined by the Chicago Classification: a hierarchical algorithm that accounts for specific parameters evaluated by analyzing <b>HRM</b> <b>results.</b> The main drawback in this procedure pertains to the requirement of specialized experts for the evaluation of such parameters, inducing intra- and inter-operator variabilities with regard to the final diagnosis. The esophageal motility was investigated with the goal of providing a physiological model able to interpret <b>results</b> from <b>HRM,</b> accounting for parameters related to specific physio-mechanical properties of the esophagus and their heterogeneous distribution. Activities were focused on the implementation of a procedure for the autonomic detection of esophageal motility dysfunctions based on HRM measurements processing. As a result, objective criteria were defined to support the medical staff during the traditional diagnostic activity of esophageal motility disorders. The physiological model was developed to this purpose to evaluate the pressure distribution due to the transit of a generic pressure wave. The corresponding optimal sets of model parameters were identified accounting for the <b>HRM</b> <b>results</b> of each subject of a training set composed by 229 patients and 35 healthy volunteers. Patients and volunteers were classified into groups according to their specific healthy or pathological conditions, as non-pathological (73 patients and 35 volunteers), Achalasia pattern I (34 subjects), Achalasia pattern II (44 subjects), Achalasia pattern III (7 subjects), Esophago-Gastric Junction (EGJ) outflow obstruction (39 subjects), hypertensive LES (9 subjects), Nutcracker esophagus (14 subjects) and Diffuse Esophageal Spasm (9 subjects). The identified model parameters were analyzed, and their distributions were assessed for each group of subjects, as basis for the implementation of the autonomic diagnosis procedure. Thus, the condition of a generic patient could be determined through the evaluation of a similarity index designed to correlate the model parameters of the patient to the parameters distributions of the training set. As a result, a preliminary set of HRMs of healthy and pathological subjects was collected for a proper design and testing of the autonomic diagnosis software. The suitability of the developed physiological model was assessed by evaluating the coefficient of determination R 2 between clinical data and model results, ranging from 83...|$|R

We examined clinical correlations and CALR mutation frequency in our myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) cases, and introduce an effective test method for use in clinical practice. Methods We examined 177 samples previously investigated for the JAK 2 mutation for differential diagnosis of MPN. JAK 2 and CALR mutations were analyzed using melting curve analysis and microchip electrophoresis, respectively. Next, we constructed a test for simultaneous screening of the JAK 2 and CALR mutations utilizing high resolution melting (<b>HRM).</b> <b>Results</b> Among 99 MPN cases, 60 possessed the JAK 2 mutation alone. Of the 39 MPN cases without the JAK 2 mutation, 14 were positive for the CALR mutation, {{all of which were}} ET. Using our novel screening test for the JAK 2 and CALR mutations by HRM, the concordance rate of conventional analysis with HRM was 96 % for the JAK 2 mutation and 95 % for the CALR mutation.

However, there is no universally acceptable consensus on how to efficiently identify mutations in the target TKD. Recently, high-resolution melting (HRM) technology was developed, which allows gene scanning using an inexpensive generic heteroduplex-detecting dsDNA-binding dye. This study aimed to validate the introduction of HRM in a practical clinical setting for screening of mutations in sporadic sites of the chimerical bcr-abl TKD. All chimerical and wild-type abl TKD regions selectively amplified were used for HRM assays and direct sequencing. The HRM test had approximately 5 - 90 % detection sensitivity for mutations. In contrast to mixture samples with mutant and wild-type cells, all mutant cell samples had indeterminate melting curves equivalent to those of the wild-type due to formation of only a homodulex. This issue was improved by the addition of exogenous wild-type DNA after PCR. Subsequently, <b>HRM</b> <b>results</b> gave a high accordance rate of 97. 8 % (44 / 45 samples) compared to the sequencing data. The discordant results in one appear to be due to unsuccessful amplification.

The exon 14 analysis included 163 patients with polycythemia vera, secondary erythrocytoses, essential thrombocythemia, or secondary thrombocytoses, and 126 healthy subjects. The study of exon 12 included 40 JAK 2 V 617 F-negative patients (nine of which had polycythemia vera, and 31 with splanchnic vein thrombosis) and 30 healthy subjects. HRM analyses of JAK 2 exons 14 and 12 gave analytical sensitivities near 1 % and both intra- and interday coefficients of variation of less than 1 %. For HRM analysis of JAK 2 exon 14 in polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia, clinical sensitivities were 93. 5 % and 67. 9 %, clinical specificities were 98. 8 % and 97. 0 %, positive predictive values were 93. 5 % and 79. 2 %, and negative predictive values were 98. 8 % and 94. 6, respectively.

A factor analysis of 80 different <b>HRM</b> practices <b>resulted</b> in 15 bundles of HRM practices which were then further categorized as being either 'calculative', 'collaborative' or 'intermediary'. While controlling for contingency factors, firm strategy, firm size, market conditions and degree of unionization, as well as controlling for industry and country, the resulting analysis indicates that while {{five of the six}} calculative practices and two of the three intermediary practices {{have a significant impact on}} performance none of the six collaborative practices has.

40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{primarily}} about personnel {{management in the}} National Health Service (NHS). It uses managerial strategy theory to examine the arguments about the changing style of personnel management {{and the emergence of}} human resource management (HRN). Some scholars have argued that the adoption of <b>HRM</b> <b>results</b> in an increasing role of line managers in the formulation and implementation of personnel issues. It is further argued that HIM results in increased ambiguity in personnel issues, and consequently poses a threat to personnel management. Using a case study qualitative approach involving the analysis of documents and in-depth, semi-structured interviews, the thesis examined the implications of the integration of the personnel strategy of quality circles into the organizational strategy of quality assurance in two English district health authorities in the Post-Griffiths period. The research revealed that both quality assurance and quality circles initiatives are responses to the potential deterioration in health service delivery {{as a result of the}} cuts in health care expenditure. They are, thus, opportunistic and reactive approaches for managing under financial constraints and as such cannot be considered as HRK The empirical evidence indicates that personnel managers did not play any significant role in the quality initiative programmes; as such both programmes did not pose any major threat to personnel management although they encourage line management involvement in personnel issues. This heightens the ambiguity between line and staff functions and relationships in personnel. This research is significant in showing how higher level managerial decisions, a response to environmental pressures provide a link between organizational policies and the employment practices at the lower levels within an organization. It has shed some light also on the supposed effects of employees commitment programmes on personnel management thus contributing to the debate on the supposed 'transformation' of personnel management into HRM...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{elements}} Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Mo, Cd, Sb, Tl, Pb and Hg {{and selected}} persistent organochlorinated compounds (dioxins, marker and dioxin-like PCBs, DDT and metabolites {{as well as}} other chlorinated pesticides) were analysed in Belgian free-range eggs obtained from hens of private owners (PO) and of commercial farms (CF). It was found that PO eggs were more contaminated than CF eggs. The ratios of levels in PO eggs to levels in CF eggs range from 2 to 8 for the toxic contaminants Pb, Hg, Tl, dioxins, PCBs and the group of DDT. The DDT contamination was marked by substantial presence of p,p'-DDT in PO eggs in addition to p,p-DDE and p,p'-DDD. It is postulated that environmental pollution is at the origin of the higher contamination of PO eggs. Extensive consumption of PO eggs is likely to <b>result</b> in <b>TEQ</b> intake levels exceeding the tolerable weekly intake.

40|$|Abstract Background p 53 is {{commonly}} inactivated by mutations in the DNA-binding domain {{in a wide}} range of cancers. As mutant p 53 often influences response to therapy, effective and rapid methods to scan for mutations in TP 53 are likely to be of clinical value. We therefore evaluated the use of high resolution melting (HRM) as a rapid mutation scanning tool for TP 53 in tumour samples. Methods We designed PCR amplicons for HRM mutation scanning of TP 53 exons 5 to 8 and tested them with DNA from cell lines hemizygous or homozygous for known mutations. We assessed the sensitivity of each PCR amplicon using dilutions of cell line DNA in normal wild-type DNA. We then performed a blinded assessment on ovarian tumour DNA samples that had been previously sequenced for mutations in TP 53 to assess the sensitivity and positive predictive value of the HRM technique. We also performed HRM analysis on breast tumour DNA samples with unknown TP 53 mutation status. Results One cell line mutation was not readily observed when exon 5 was amplified. As exon 5 contained multiple melting domains, we divided the exon into two amplicons for further screening. Sequence changes were also introduced into some of the primers to improve the melting characteristics of the amplicon. Aberrant HRM curves indicative of TP 53 mutations were observed for each of the samples in the ovarian tumour DNA panel. Comparison of the <b>HRM</b> <b>results</b> with the sequencing results revealed that each mutation was detected by HRM in the correct exon. For the breast tumour panel, we detected seven aberrant melt profiles by HRM and subsequent sequencing confirmed the presence of these and no other mutations in the predicted exons. Conclusion HRM is an effective technique for simple and rapid scanning of TP 53 mutations that can markedly reduce the amount of sequencing required in mutational studies of TP 53. </p...|$|R
40|$|Non-reproducible {{sequence}} artefacts {{are frequently}} detected in DNA from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. However, no rational {{strategy has been}} developed for reduction of sequence artefacts from FFPE DNA as {{the underlying causes of}} the artefacts are poorly understood. As cytosine deamination to uracil is a common form of DNA damage in ancient DNA, we set out to examine whether treatment of FFPE DNA with uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) would lead to the reduction of C>T (and G>A) sequence artefacts. Heteroduplex formation in high resolution melting (HRM) -based assays was used for the detection of sequence variants in FFPE DNA samples. A set of samples that gave false positive <b>HRM</b> <b>results</b> for screening of the E 17 K mutation in exon 4 of the AKT 1 gene were chosen for analysis. Sequencing of these samples showed multiple non-reproducible C:G>T:A artefacts. Treatment of the FFPE DNA with UDG prior to PCR amplification led to a very marked reduction of the sequence artefacts as indicated by both HRM and sequencing analysis. Similar results were shown for the BRAFV 600 region in the same sample set and EGFR exon 19 in another sample set. UDG treatment specifically suppressed the formation of artefacts in FFPE DNA as it did not affect the detection of true KRAS codon 12 and true EGFR exon 19 and 20 mutations. We conclude that uracil in FFPE DNA leads to a significant proportion of sequence artefacts. These can be minimised by a simple UDG pre-treatment, which can be readily carried out in the same tube as the PCR, immediately prior to commencing thermal cycling. HRM is a convenient way of monitoring both the degree of damage and the effectiveness of the UDG treatment. These findings have immediate and important implications for cancer diagnostics where FFPE DNA is used as the primary genetic material for mutational studies guiding personalised medicine strategies and where simple effective strategies to detect mutations are required...|$|R

40|$|Background & objectives: Studies {{have shown}} that {{immunohistochemical}} (IHC) staining using epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation specific antibodies, is an easy and cost-effective, screening method compared with molecular techniques. The purpose of {{present study was to}} assess the percentage positivity of IHC using EGFR mutation specific antibodies in lung biopsy samples from patients with primary lung adenocarcinoma (ADC). Methods: Two hundred and six biopsies of primary lung ADC were subjected to EGFR mutation specific antibodies against del E 746 -A 750 and L 858 R. Detection of EGFR mutation done by high resolution melting analysis (HRM) was used as gold standard. A concordance was established between molecular and IHC results. Frequency of IHC positivity was assessed. Results: Of the 206 patients, 129 were male and 77 were female patients, {{with a mean age of}} 54. 1 yr. Fifty five (26. 6 %) patients (36 men; 19 women) showed positivity for IHC of del E 746 -A 750 (33) and L 858 R (22). <b>HRM</b> <b>results</b> were available in 14 patients which showed EGFR mutations in correspondence with del E 746 - 750 or L 858 R in 64. 2 per cent cases. Positive cases on HRM were further confirmed by DNA sequencing and fragment analysis. Three patients showed exon[20] variation. Two cases were negative for mutation. The genotype of del E 746 - 750 mutation was more common than L 858 R. A concordance was established between molecular mutation and IHC in 85. 7 per cent cases. Interpretation & conclusions: In this preliminary study from India mutation specific IHC was used for assessment of mutation status of EGFR. Although the number tested was small, a good concordance was observed between molecular EGFR mutation and IHC expression. IHC methodology is a potentially useful tool to guide clinicians for personalized treatment in lung ADC, especially where facilities for molecular analysis are not readily available and for use in small biopsies where material is scant for molecular tests...|$|R
40|$|Gastrointestinal {{involvement}} affects 30 - 40 % of {{the patients}} with chronic Chagas disease. Esophageal symptoms appear once the structural damage is established. Little {{is known about the}} usefulness of high resolution manometry to early identification of esophageal involvement. We performed a cross-sectional study at the Vall d'Hebron University Hospital (Barcelona, Spain) between May 2011 and April 2012. Consecutive patients diagnosed with Chagas disease in the chronic phase were offered to participate. All patients underwent a structured questionnaire about digestive symptoms, a barium esophagogram (Rezende classification) and an esophageal high resolution manometry (HRM). A control group of patients with heartburn who underwent an esophageal HRM in our hospital was selected. 62 out of 73 patients that were included in the study fulfilled the study protocol. The median age of the Chagas disease group (CG) was 37 (IQR 32 - 45) years, and 42 (67. 7 %) patients were female. Twenty-seven (43. 5 %) patients had esophageal symptoms, heartburn being the most frequent. Esophagogram was abnormal in 5 (8. 77 %). The esophageal HRM in the CG showed a pathological motility pattern in 14 patients (22. 6 %). All of them had minor disorders of the peristalsis (13 with ineffective esophageal motility and 1 with fragmented peristalsis). Hypotonic lower esophageal sphincter was found more frequently in the CG than in the control group (21 % vs 3. 3 %; p< 0. 01). Upper esophageal sphincter was hypertonic in 22 (35. 5 %) and hypotonic in 1 patient. When comparing specific manometric parameters or patterns in the CG according to the presence of symptoms or esophagogram no statistically significant association were seen, except for distal latency. The esophageal involvement measured by HRM in patients with chronic Chagas disease in our cohort is 22. 6 %. All the patients with esophageal alterations had minor disorders of the peristalsis.
