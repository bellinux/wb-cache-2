A distinctive characteristic of Uttarakhand cuisine is the sparing use of tomatoes, milk, and milk based products. Coarse grain with <b>high</b> <b>fibre</b> content {{is very common}} in Uttarakhand due to the harsh terrain. Another crop which is associated with Uttarakhand is Buckwheat (locally called Madua or Jhingora), particularly in the interior regions of Kumaon and Garhwal. Generally, either Desi Ghee or Mustard oil {{is used for the}} purpose of cooking food. Simple recipes are made interesting with the use of hash seeds [...] "Jakhiya" [...] as spice. Bal Mithai is a popular fudge-like sweet. Other popular dishes include Dubuk, Chains, Kap, Chutkani, Sei, and Gulgula. A regional variation of Kadhi called Jhoi or Jholi is also popular.|$|E

Rats were fed a low fibre diet (17 g/kg non-starch polysaccharides NSP) or the stock diet (133 g/kg NSP). The <b>higher</b> <b>fibre</b> fed rats had increased caecal and colonic total contents (p < 0. 001) and SCFAs than the low fibre fed rats (caecal SCFAs: <b>higher</b> <b>fibre</b> rats 96. 4 (6. 8) mumol/g wet weight v low fibre 22. 7 (3. 0) : p < 0. 001, colonic SCFAs: <b>higher</b> <b>fibre</b> 52. 3 (3. 1) mumol/g wet weight v low fibre 6. 9 (2. 2) mumol/g wet weight: p < 0. 001).

There {{was no significant difference in}} the percentage of cells in S phase in the distal colon of rats in both diet groups. The proliferative zone, however, was expanded in the distal colon of the <b>higher</b> <b>fibre</b> diet fed rats.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Changes in the {{structure}} and integrity of the colon dependent on collagen content and crosslinkage occur with age. AIMS [...] This study using an animal model examines colonic collagen content and crosslinkage over the lifetime of rats on <b>fibre</b> deficient and <b>higher</b> <b>fibre</b> diets. METHODS [...] Two groups of 20 rats were fed either a fibre deficient diet (1. 7 g NSP (non-starch polysaccharide) / 100 g) or a <b>higher</b> <b>fibre</b> diet (13. 3 g NSP/ 100 g) for 18 months. Diverticula were identified by postmortem examination. Caecal and colonic contents were weighed and assayed for short chain fatty acids. Collagen solubility in weak acid was measured to give {{an indication of the}} nature and amount of crosslinks in the collagen of the bowel wall. RESULTS [...] The incidence of colonic diverticula was greater (42. 1 % fibre deficient rats; 0 % <b>higher</b> <b>fibre</b> rats). Colonic collagen solubility index in fibre deficient rats was significantly lower than <b>higher</b> <b>fibre</b> diet fed rats (p < 0. 001 in all four sections of the large bowel). Rats with diverticula had the lowest solubility index (p < 0. 001 in all four sections of the large bowel). <b>Higher</b> <b>fibre</b> diet rats had increased caecal and colonic contents, caecal and colonic tissue wet weights, and greater caecal short chain fatty acids. Fibre deficient diet fed rats had more pathological abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS [...] This animal model permits a study of the relation between collagen crosslinkage and the development of colonic diverticulosis. A <b>higher</b> <b>fibre</b> diet protects against collagen crosslinking and this is related to a decreased incidence of diverticula...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} behaviour of glass fibre-reinforced epoxy composites with introduced layers {{of materials and}} with fibre coating is studied. The role of aerosil powder as a filler material is investigated, and the fracture mode is analysed by scanning electron microscopy. The investigation shows a considerable drop in interlaminar shear stress for the <b>higher</b> <b>fibre</b> volume fraction, whereas the introduction of filler materials to the composite causes no change. Surface mat-reinforced samples show a marginal increase in shear stress. Exposure to moisture reduces the interlaminar shear stress value faster for the <b>higher</b> <b>fibre</b> volume fraction, thereby highlighting {{the role of the}} interracial area. Impact values for coated and uncoated fibres show an identical trend with exposure to dry heat, the former always recording lower values.

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Maternal diet {{may have}} an effect on the health of the {{offspring}} in middle and later life. This study used the laboratory rat as an animal model to examine whether the fibre content of the maternal diet during pregnancy affected subsequent development of colonic diverticula in the offspring fed lifelong <b>fibre</b> deficient or <b>higher</b> <b>fibre</b> diets. METHODS: The parents of experimental animals were fed either a diet that was known to predispose to colonic diverticulosis or a control diet for one month prior to mating. The offspring were fed one of these diets for 18 months. The incidence of colonic diverticulosis, submucosal collagen content, collagen solubility in weak acid, and the composition of intestinal contents were then measured. RESULTS: Offspring of rats fed a <b>higher</b> <b>fibre</b> diet from <b>higher</b> <b>fibre</b> diet fed parents had 0 % incidence of colonic diverticulosis. When offspring (regardless of parental diet) were fed a low fibre diet for life the acid solubility was lowered compared with rats fed lifelong <b>higher</b> <b>fibre</b> diet mean (SD) (0. 044 (0. 0007) v 0. 073 (0. 0015) sigmoid colon (ratio of soluble:insoluble collagen)); 21. 1 % had diverticulosis and there was reduced fibre fermentation. However, when the diet of the parents of the fibre deficient diet fed rats was considered, the animals whose mothers had a fibre deficient diet had lower acid solubility (0. 032 (0. 0007)) and an increased incidence of colonic diverticulosis (42. 1 %) than the animals fed a fibre deficient diet from <b>higher</b> <b>fibre</b> diet fed parents (p < 0. 01 in all instances). CONCLUSION: Maternal diet and the subsequent nutrition of the progeny seem to be of importance in the development of colonic diverticulosis in the rat...|$|R

The Sunnhemp Research Station of Uttar Pradesh further researched Crotalaria juncea’s genotypic impact on fibre yield. Four different genotypes of Crotalaria juncea were observed for three years to determine which genotype would yield in a <b>high</b> <b>fibre</b> yield. Important data that was collected across the plant genotypes include height (cm), basal diameter (mm), green biomass weight (q/ha), fibre weight (q/ha), and stick weight (q/ha). Out of the four genotypes, namely SUIN-029, SUIN-080, SUIN-037, and SUIN-043, SUIN-029 was superior in resulting in a <b>high</b> <b>fibre</b> yield.
