5|$|However, once {{he learned}} that a betrothal had <b>finally</b> <b>been</b> arranged, the Emperor ended his {{relationship}} to Domitila. She returned to her native province of São Paulo on 27 August, where she remained. Days earlier, on 2 August, the Emperor had been married by proxy to Amélie of Leuchtenberg. He was stunned by her beauty after meeting her in person. The vows previously made by proxy were ratified in a Nuptial Mass on 17 October. Amélie was kind and loving to his children and provided a much needed sense of normality to both his family and the general public. After Domitila's banishment from court, the vow the Emperor made to alter his behavior proved to be sincere. He had no more affairs and remained faithful to his spouse. In an attempt to mitigate and move beyond other past misdeeds, he made peace with José Bonifácio, his former minister and mentor.|$|E

Their chief rivals, the Yomiuri Giants, lost their star player Hideki Matsui to the New York Yankees, while the Tigers saw {{the return of}} pitcher Hideki Irabu back to NPB after playing with the Texas Rangers. The Tigers won the Central League {{to qualify for the}} Japan Series, and many newspapers speculated that the Curse of the Colonel had <b>finally</b> <b>been</b> broken. The Tigers lost the Japan Series, this time to the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks, so the curse is presumably intact.|$|E
5|$|On {{the weekend}} of Jack Donaghy's (Alec Baldwin) 51st birthday, his {{advances}} with CNBC host Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) are called into question when he learns that his high school sweetheart, Nancy Donovan (Julianne Moore), has <b>finally</b> <b>been</b> divorced from her husband. Jack spends evenings having dinner and wine with both, against Liz Lemon's (Tina Fey) suggestion {{that it is a}} bad idea. He compares Nancy to actor Lee Marvin, after watching a movie marathon starring Marvin, and Avery to baseball player Derek Jeter, after he spends time with Avery at Jeter's home. He is moved by the thoughtful birthday gifts both women give him. Jack is torn between the easygoing, middle-class Nancy and his successful, wealthy counterpart Avery, and does not know whom to choose.|$|E
5|$|A {{friend of}} Eberhardt's {{gave her a}} letter of {{introduction}} to playwright Eugène Brieux, who opposed French rule in North Africa and supported Arab emancipation. He sent her a several-hundred-franc advance and tried to have her stories published, but could not find anyone willing to publish pro-Arab writing. Eberhardt, unfazed, continued writing; her morale lifted when Ehnni was transferred to a spahi regiment near Marseille in late August to complete his final months of service. He did not require permission from his military superiors to marry in France, and he and Eberhardt were married in October 1901. Shortly before they were married, Eberhardt and Augustin received the news that Trophimowsky's estate had <b>finally</b> <b>been</b> sold, though due to the mounting legal costs {{there was no money}} left for them to inherit. With this news, Eberhardt abandoned any hope of having a financially secure future. In February 1902 Ehnni was discharged, and the couple returned to Bône to live with his family.|$|E

5|$|Doggett {{goes off}} alone {{to see the}} woman who guarded the {{creature}} in the woods. The woman implies that Mulder, feeling sorry for the creature, was trying to euthanize the creature, not save Hangemuhl. Doggett hears a noise and finds a trap door leading into the tunnels. Underground, he finds Hangemuhl and takes her to the hospital. Skinner checks in with Doggett who reports that Hangemuhl's kidneys have healed spontaneously. Doggett returns to {{the woman in the}} woods who watches over the creature; after recoiling at its ugliness, the woman explains that it looks the way it does because it takes the sickness of others into itself, while healing them in the process. Doggett decides to take the creature away from the society, which only uses it. However, Doggett is shot and killed in a scuffle with the sheriff and is promptly buried. Later, Doggett awakens in the tunnels. In the dark corner of the cavern, the woman kneels beside the dead soul eater. She weeps over it, revealing that, by eating Doggett's death, it has <b>finally</b> <b>been</b> allowed to die.|$|E
5|$|Following {{her return}} from Cape Town, Schwalbe {{returned}} to supporting operations to pacify the coastal area in southern German East Africa {{carried out by}} Wissmann. During this period, several artillery pieces were captured, {{one of which was}} taken aboard Schwalbe before eventually being given to the Training Inspection for the colonial troops. By mid-May, the uprising had <b>finally</b> <b>been</b> suppressed. Schwalbe thereafter conducted the normal peacetime routine of cruising the coast to show the German flag. Hirschberg contracted malaria and became severely ill, prompting his return to Germany on 24 June to recover; KK Rüdiger arrived on 13 July to take over command of the ship. On 9 October, Rüdiger presided over a ceremony to dedicate a memorial in Tanga to the naval personnel who had been killed in the Abushiri revolt. Meanwhile, on 1 July, Wituland had been ceded to Britain as part of the Heligoland–Zanzibar Treaty; this development upset the Sultan of Wituland, who ordered the killing of several Europeans in the colony, mostly Germans. The British launched a punitive expedition, and Schwalbe remained in the area as an observer until the end of October.|$|E
5|$|The large {{diversity}} of the flora around Adams is even more apparent in the herbage and, including the tree and shrub species previously mentioned, totals at least 843 species. This is {{more than any other}} mountain in the Pacific Northwest. The first extensive list of flora from the area around Mount Adams was published in 1896 by William Suksdorf and Thomas Howell and listed 480 species. Suksdorf had taken it upon himself to catalogue as many species around Adams as he could and the list was the result of his extraordinary collection efforts. This was the most complete list for over a century and has <b>finally</b> <b>been</b> updated by David Beik and Susan McDougall to the current 843 species with hundreds of additional species listed. Adams is home to many rare plants including tall bugbane, Suksdorf’s monkeyflower, northern microseris (Microceris borealis), Brewer’s potentilla (Potentilla breweri), and mountain blue-eyed grass. The plant diversity is most evident in the many meadows and wetlands on the flanks of Adams. The notable Bird Creek Meadows includes in its famous display, magenta paintbrush, arrowleaf ragwort, penstemons, lupines, monkeyflowers, mountain heathers, and many others. In wetlands, generally at lower elevations, one can find bog blueberry, highbush cranberry, sundew, purple cinquefoil, and flatleaf bladderwort, in addition to many sedges and rushes. Subalpine and alpine meadows and parklands, while not as prolific as the meadows and wetlands of lower elevations, have a beautiful display as well with partrigefoot, Cascade rockcress, subalpine buttercup, Sitka valerian, alpine false candytuft, elegant Jacob’s ladder, and various buckwheats as prominent players.|$|E
