500|$|Rihanna first {{performed}} [...] "Rockstar 101" [...] on American Idol on April 7, 2010. She {{wore a black}} PVC catsuit and {{was accompanied}} on stage by guitarist Nuno Bettencourt; the set design included flame throwers and a video screen which showed guitars, lightning bolts and skulls. At one point, the singer picked and played up a black Gibson Flying V guitar. Larry Carroll for MTV wrote that the extent of Rihanna's ability to play the guitar was limited to playing it with one finger {{on one of the}} strings. However, he complimented Rihanna's overall performance, writing that her shoulder pads were [...] "nearly as huge as her presence". He went on to write that she [...] "half-sung, half-spoke" [...] the song. A reviewer for MTV UK agreed with Carroll, writing that [...] "halfway through the performance [...] donned a 'black flying v guitar' although we're not sure you could say she 'played' it!" [...] Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone praised Rihanna's performance, writing [...] "if the <b>introductory</b> <b>rules</b> of rock stardom are 'teach thyself to pick slide,' 'tight clothes' and 'pyro!' then Rihanna has been paying attention in her 'Rockstar 101' classes after all".|$|E

40|$|After an {{introductory}} discussion on Martin-Löf's Intuitionistic Theory of Types (ITT), the paper introduces {{the notion of}} assumption of high-arity variable. Then the original theory is extended (HITT) in a very uniform way {{by means of the}} new assumptions. Some improvements allowed by high-arity variables are shown. The main result of the paper is a normal form theorem for HITT. The detailed proof follows a computability method ‘a la Tait’. The main consequences of the normal form theorem are: the consistency of HITT, which also implies the consistency of ITT, and the computability of any judgement derived within HITT. Besides that, a canonical form theorem is shown: to any derivable judgement we can associate a canonical one whose derivation ends with an <b>introductory</b> <b>rule.</b> The standard disjunction and existential properties follow. Moreover, by using the computational interpretation of types it immediately follows that the execution of any proved correct program terminates...|$|R
50|$|The module's <b>introductory</b> section details <b>rules</b> {{for events}} and {{underwater}} encounters. The next section introduces the adventure and informs the player characters that their reward for completing the adventure {{is that they}} will be awarded their own tropical island, but also warns that many have tried and failed. The players must discover who or what is responsible for raiding vessels on the High Seas, causing distress to shipping and capturing a local princess. They will travel under the waters of the monster infested Sea of Dread.|$|R

40|$|AbstractContract {{for work}} is {{probably}} the second most widely used type of contract (next to the purchase contract). Therefore it's complex regal regulation {{is very important for}} the unambiguous definition of the rights and obligations of the parties to the contract. By the contract for work, the contractor undertakes to perform certain work and the employer undertakes to pay the price for its performance. Work as defined by the law manufacture specified products (provided the manufacture does not fall under the notion of a purchase contract), the maintenance, repair or modification of certain items or the result of other activities. Fabrication, repair or modification of buildings or parts thereof shall be always covered by contracts for work. The new legislation, given by the Civil Code, Law No. 89 / 2012 Coll. and effective from 1 January 2014, replaced the regulation of the contract for work, as contained in the abolished Civil Code of 1964, as well as the in the Czech Commercial Code of 1991 that was also cancelled by the new Civil Code of 2012. The paper describes the most important provisions of the new shape the of contract for work. The basis for the draft new legislation was taken from the former regulation of this contract by the Commercial Code and having taken regard to certain legal regulations by other countries, because the concept of contract work as contained in the former Civil Code was strongly influenced by its original design from 1964 and the by patterns of the Civil Code of 1950. In some respect certain provisions of former Code of International Trade were also take into account, the normative structure of which was “borrowed” by the later Commercial Code. The new Civil Code regulation, however, should be more precise and clearer than the previous arrangements. In the interest of clarity, the draft legislation is structured so that the <b>introductory</b> <b>rules</b> cover contracts for work in general and thereafter follow rules for deviation from the price of the work according to the agreed budget, for the work carried out on real estate and works concerning intangible assets...|$|E
