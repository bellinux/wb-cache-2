40|$|This paper {{examines}} <b>exclusionary</b> <b>practices</b> allegedly used by Intel {{to maintain}} its dominant position in sales of microprocessors for IBM-compatible personal computers (PCs), focusing primarily on the preferential allocation of scarce product among customers. The paper considers the period 1991 - 93, which encompasses {{the transition from the}} 386 to the 486 microprocessor generation and the entry of several competitors. We test for two conditions that are necessary for <b>exclusionary</b> <b>practices</b> to be successful. First, using the market definition approach that is common to antitrust analyses in the US, we demonstrate that, at the upstream microprocessor level, Intel had monopoly power in a distinct market for high-end microprocessors. In particular, pricing data show that the effects of entry were localized {{at the low end of}} Intel's product line. Secondly, we identify four conditions that are sufficient for <b>exclusionary</b> <b>practices</b> to be successful, and show that the downstream PC manufacturing stage has these characteristics. Finally, we consider potential explanations for preferential allocation that are based on efficiencies, and outline a methodology for calculating the effect of <b>exclusionary</b> <b>practices</b> on the prices received by two of Intel's competitorsexclusionary practices; allocation; microprocessor industry; market definition; monopoly power; damages, JEL classifications: L 12, L 41, L 42, L 63, O 31,...|$|R

40|$|Mapping is {{inherently}} a subjective and <b>exclusionary</b> <b>practice</b> as the cartographer decides which {{elements of the}} world are included and which can safely be ignored. Similarly, when an international relations theorist describes a new theory it is necessary to define the elements which are essential to understanding the complexities of an international political system, explain why other elements have been excluded and justify why those decisions were made. The subjective nature of theorizing international affairs and the necessary exclusionary practices in which the theorist engages mean that the arguments supporting a new theory of international relations must be rather stronger than the arguments behind the scribbled directions one might offer a friend. This article explains why existing realist and liberal “maps” of the international system are insufficient to describe the system’s complexities and offers guidelines and a basic structure for mapping an alternative chaotic theory of international politics...|$|E

Two examples of this bilateral preference are the 1996 Ganges (India and Bangladesh) and Mahakhali (India and Nepal) Treaties. These bilateral practices created “ample water, ample poverty” (Bandyopadhyay and Ghosh 2009 : 51) because of the river ecological resource failures. The Joint River Commission fails to address the ecological issues in Bangladesh because of complex hydropolitics over the Ganges Basin management.|$|E

Second, for many antitrust practices positive innovation effects are difficult to foresee even on Schumpeter 2 ̆ 7 s own expansive and nonmathematical terms.

On the one hand, the factionalism in the party provided for an alternation of leadership not possible through formal elections; and perhaps not desirable at this time. Further, the emergence of Congress of the People (COPE) promises a more meaningful party pluralism, taking the pressure for democratic competition off ANC internal processes into the future. On the other hand, the renaissance of the ANC as alliance provides better access to government by organisations, especially COSATU, who have a proven record in mobilising working and poor people around key social issues from land to HIV-AIDS and Zimbabwe.

This paper examines the role of state and local agencies (education, health, families, communities, and criminal justice) in documenting but not altering student trajectories towards life failure. When the most marginalised and disadvantaged youth in our communities are the primary target for <b>exclusionary</b> <b>practice</b> in education around the western world, then there has been little impetus to coordinate service delivery between school systems and other services in order to provide stable ongoing supports for progress through education. A detailed investigation of the socioeducational trajectories of 300 individuals excluded from Queensland primary schools between 1973 and 2004 examined data gathered on these children before and after a period spent in a special school setting for intervention in behaviour and learning. This study has revealed extensive record keeping of a downward spiral in the lives of these children but little sharing of this information. Case-by-case treatment of information from child to child, from time to time, and from setting to setting has been a barrier to effective decision-making and to systemic support for a better trajectory towards social inclusion.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{theoretical}} analysis of organisational identity, community and belonging. I use a debate concerning transgender inclusion/exclusion to exemplify the identity {{work of the}} Council members of Morton Hall, a UK based public sector LGB organisation. I draw {{on a range of}} queer, feminist and post-structural theorists in explicating the processes of dis/identification that I have observed. I elucidate the complex, and often contradictory, relationship between gender and sexuality by employing discourse/narrative analysis on the transcripts of interviews and meetings of the organisation. The reasons given by Council members for either including or excluding transgender from the organisation give insights into the identity constructions of the individuals themselves, and of the organisation as a whole. This is combined with a diverse and distinctive theoretical approach which aims to utilise contemporary queer and gender theory as well as less obvious thinkers such as Nietzsche, Durkheim, Hegel, Bataille and Deleuze and Guattari. Using these theorists I develop the argument that the transgression of normative gender codes is central {{to the creation of a}} boundary between gender and sexuality which instigates the <b>exclusionary</b> <b>practice</b> adopted by the organisation at the conclusion of the debate. Whilst the research site specifically relates to sexual and gender identity, the theoretical conclusions regarding the construction of collective identity and the formation of community are widely applicable...|$|E
40|$|It {{was in the}} {{developed}} countries that the increase in the aging of the population began, though it has evolved most markedly in the developing countries in recent years. It is estimated that global aging in the 21 st century will result in a substantial increase in demand for social, economic and health solutions all over the world, at unsustainable costs for future generations. Active aging emerges today as a concept that, according to the World Health Organisation, reflects the importance of psychological, psychosocial and social factors when devising intervention to foster adaptation to aging. WHO considers the word active to mean ongoing participation in social, economic, cultural, spiritual and civic issues and not just a person's ability to be physically active or continue to work. Social, demographic, financial and political incentives to bear the costs of longevity have sanctioned and consolidated the paradigm of active aging, which, anchored in its social utility, has gradually become compulsory. The discussion of the assumptions underlying this paradigm brings us to this analysis, which conducts critical reflection on the current concept of active aging {{and the way in which}} this concept is understood and implemented in the political, economic and social sphere. The conclusion is that the ideology of people's obligation and implicit responsibility makes active aging compulsory and an <b>exclusionary</b> <b>practice</b> to which only a few have access.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{psychological}} wellbeing of adolescents with physical disabilities living in inclusive community settings in Zimbabwe. An inclusive community is one that aims to remove <b>exclusionary</b> <b>practice</b> within the community and promote community's systems that accept all people, regardless of their differences. A constructivist lived experience perspective underpinned this research, in which the researcher used multiple case studies to interact with the participants about their inclusion and psychological wellbeing as adolescents with physical disabilities. The 14 participants (nine males and five females) were purposively sampled. Data was collected through face-to-face interviews. Four themes emerged from the inductive thematic analysis of data sources. It was found that participants in this study were involved in various inclusive community activities available within their communities. The study also found that parent, the government, the community and donor communities were working together towards improving the lives of adolescents with physical disabilities in the communities in which they live. These stakeholders assumed different roles, such as providing disability awareness education, vocational counselling, and inclusive infrastructure and resources. The study also found that the participants encountered environmental restrictions in choosing inclusion activities in which to participate in their communities. The findings of this study have the potential to help the policy makers and researchers in inclusive communities to better understand the needs of adolescents with physical disabilities living in these communities. Furthermore, the current research has the potential to guide future research and develop future initiatives to improve the psychological wellbeing of adolescents with physical disabilities, thus improving their outcomes and quality of life.
