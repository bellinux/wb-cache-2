5|$|In the 1990s South Stoneham House was {{merged into}} the Wessex Lane Halls complex of residences, {{although}} each individual hall maintained an <b>individual</b> <b>character.</b> Residents were catered for and ate originally in South Stoneham's own dining hall, {{part of the}} 1960s extension, {{and later in the}} Galley Restaurant in the neighbouring Connaught Hall. Residents shared small kitchen and bathroom facilities.|$|E
5|$|Ian McCormick diagnoses the {{pamphlet}} as representing a gradual change in European {{discourse on the}} character of the sodomite: previous publications had discussed sexual deviance (conceived in contemporary terms) as a general evil; with Satan's Harvest Home a new attention was brought to the <b>individual</b> <b>character</b> of persons who committed sodomy. He argues that 'before the seventeenth century, sodomy was not even precisely differentiated from its demonic associations with werewolves, heretics, sorcerers, and the like. Increasingly, however, it came to be linked with pride, excess of diet, idleness, and contempt of the poor.' The pamphlet's equation of effeminacy with homosexuality is identified by Michael Kimmel as distinctive for the period.|$|E

5|$|Sculpturally, Rodin {{possessed a}} unique ability to model a complex, turbulent, deeply {{pocketed}} surface in clay. Many {{of his most}} notable sculptures were roundly criticized during his lifetime. They clashed with predominant figurative sculpture traditions, in which works were decorative, formulaic, or highly thematic. Rodin's most original work departed from traditional themes of mythology and allegory, modeled the human body with realism, and celebrated <b>individual</b> <b>character</b> and physicality. Rodin was sensitive to the controversy surrounding his work, but refused to change his style. Successive works brought increasing favor {{from the government and}} the artistic community.|$|E

It is a recap {{of the original}} Shuffle! anime, rearranging scenes from the original series into <b>individual</b> <b>character</b> specific episodes, and contains very little original content aside from the last episode. It features 13 pieces of theme music performed by Yuria, Miyuki Hashimoto, and the respective voice actors for the five heroines of Shuffle!. It was released across seven region 2 DVD compilation volumes in Japan.|$|E
5|$|In 1969 {{the large}} Allied Breweries combine {{initiated}} a {{hostile takeover bid}} for Boddingtons, which valued the company at Â£5million. Charles Boddington took {{the unusual step of}} issuing a spirited defence of the company to the shareholders: You will be only too aware that present-day pressures bear heavily towards the elimination of individuality and character in many consumer goods. There is an inexorable progression towards the mass-produced nationwide product of standardised quality. You, however, are still, at this moment in time, a shareholder in one of the remaining independent brewery companies whose traditional draught beers have a reputation for quality and <b>individual</b> <b>character</b> beyond the immediate area of the North of England in which we operate... The takeover of Boddingtons and its consequent elimination can achieve very little. It will do nothing for the national economy, add nothing to the nation's exports, and contribute nothing at all to the quality of life that we are all used to enjoy.|$|E

5|$|The {{first hint}} of its {{existence}} became public when Square Enix trademarked the name in May 2013. The game was first announced in the second September issue of Famitsu Weekly, and was demoed during TGS 2013.
