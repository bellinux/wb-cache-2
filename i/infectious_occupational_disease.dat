40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{spectrum}} of <b>occupational</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>disease</b> is staggering. <b>Occupational</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>disease</b> continues {{to pose a}} significant public health challenge {{in many parts of}} the world. In other areas, the majority of these diseases have been virtually eliminated or are well under control. A potential consequence of control is that as the burden of suffering caused by many occupationally acquired diseases decreases, the likelihood of accurately diagnosing occupationally acquired disease when it does occur also decreases. Although many of these diseases are uncommon enough that a health care provider may never see a particular infection, the potential morbidity and mortality associated with some diseases requires an awareness of possible work-related infections. For the purposes of this chapter, an <b>occupational</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>disease</b> is defined as any infectious disease or illness for which occupation places a worker at increased risk of infection.

Svoja iskustva prikazuje u statističkim pregledima Opće bolnice u Splitu. U vrijeme od 1937. do 1947. godine liječena je na očnom odjelu splitske bolnice 17. 988 bolesnika, a od njih 3. 257 zbog profesionalnih oboljenja i ozljeda oka (18, 11 % svih bolesnika). Za regionalnu patologiju okoline Splita karakteristične su ozljede radnika u brodogradilištu, kamenolomima, tvornicama cementa i cijanamida. Opisana je naročito oboljenje, opaženo u Dalmaciji 1946. i 1947. godine, kad su gusjenice borova prelca u velikoj množini napale i brstile primorske borove. Radnici, koji su skidali gnijezda gusjenica s borova, zadobili su ozljede na očima uzrokovane dlačicama gusjenica (ophthalmia nodosai). Autor ističe, da treba posvuda provesti zaštitne mjere za očnu higijenu i sistematske preglede radnika prije uposlenja zbog pravilnog izbora zvanja. The author {{describes}} {{all kinds}} of <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> of the eye, namely: contusions, foreign bodies, perforations, burns, injuries caused by dust, steam and irritant gases, intoxications, actinic traumae, parasitic and <b>infectious</b> <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> of the eye, and damage caused generally by overstrain and fatigue. The author sets forth his personal experience and describes cases from the neighbourhood of Split where shipbuilding yards, cement and other industrial plants are situated. He corroborates h:s views by statistics from the Ophthalmic Department of the general Hospital, Split, covering the period from 1937 to 1947. There were 3257 <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> and injuries of the eye, from a total of 17988 cases treated in the period, or 18, 11 % of all eye patients. He emphasises that the most characteristic injuries for the regional pathology of the Split district are those in shipbuilding yards, quarries, cement and cyanamide factories. Injuries are also frequent among builders. A special disease noted in Dalmatia in 1946 and 1947 is also dealt with. This disease was noticed when a particular caterpillar (chnetocampa - pityocampa) attacked pines in great numbers along the Dalmatian littoral. Workers who were employed in removing the caterpillar nests from trees suffered eye injuries caused by fine hairs coming off from, these parasites, resulting in ophthalmia nodosa. The author concludes by asking tor protective measures or eye hygiene, especially for industrial workers, for systematic preliminary examinations and for expert advice on chaise of vocation. All these measures will contribute to protect the health o-r the workers, and raise the productivity {{and quality of the}} work...|$|R
40|$|Agriculture {{and health}} are intimately linked. Many {{diseases}} have agricultural roots—food-borne diseases, water-associated diseases, many zoonoses, most emerging <b>infectious</b> <b>diseases,</b> and <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> associated with agrifood chains. These diseases create an especially heavy burden for poor countries, with far-reaching impacts. This brief views agriculture-associated disease as {{the dimension of}} public health shaped by the interaction between humans, animals and agroecoystems. This conceptual approach presents new opportunities for shaping agriculture to improve health outcomes, in both the short and long terms. Understanding the multiple burdens of disease {{is a first step}} in its rational management. As agriculture-associated diseases occur at the interface of human health, animal health, agriculture and ecosystems, addressing them often requires systems-based thinking and multi-disciplinary approaches. These approaches, in turn, require new ways of working and institutional arrangements. Several promising initiatives demonstrate convincing benefits of new ways of working across disciplines, despite the considerable barriers to cooperation...|$|R

Increased risk from infectious diseases appeared to be concentrated in specific professions. Healthcare workers, workers in contact with animals, laboratory workers and refuse workers seem to have the highest risk of infection by a variety of pathogens. However, pathogens reported to be associated with closely related professions were different, indicating qualitative under-reporting.

40|$|Objectives: <b>Occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> {{are common}} {{and result in}} a {{substantial}} disease burden and high sickness absence. Reliable data on the incidence and {{a better understanding of}} the risk factors will help to develop preventive measures. Methods: Several sources of measuring <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> were analysed and compared: 1) Surveillance Project for Intensive Notification (diagnosed by an occupational physician, Netherlands Center for <b>Occupational</b> <b>Diseases</b> 2015); 2) National Working Condition Surveys and 3) Morbidity and mortality data from the National Institute for Public health and the Environment. Results: The incidence of <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> in the Netherlands ranges from 0. 19 % (diagnosed by an occupational physician, workers) to 1. 6 % (self-reported, diagnosed by a medical doctor, self-employed) to 3. 2 % (self-reported, diagnosed by a medical doctor, employees). In 2013 an estimated 4, 100 people died in the Netherlands as the result of an <b>occupational</b> <b>disease</b> (900 employees and 3, 200 pensioners). The most common self-reported <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> among employees are musculoskeletal disorders (1. 7 %) and mental disorder (1. 4 %). The most common <b>occupational</b> <b>disease</b> diagnosed by <b>occupational</b> physicians is common mental disorders (0. 8 %). The risk of an <b>occupational</b> <b>disease</b> for employees is highest in the healthcare (4. 0 %), industry (3. 7 %) and construction (3. 6 %) sectors. Multivariate analyses show that occupational risks that contribute most to musculoskeletal <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> are repetitive movements (OR= 2. 25; PAF= 40 %), uncomfortable work posture (OR= 1. 62; PAF= 18 %) and high workload (OR= 1. 57; PAF= 18 %).

Methods The data of the compensation board that covers HCWs of non-governmental healthcare providers in Germany was analysed for a five-year period. For hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, the period analysed was extended to the last 15 years. The annual rate of <b>occupational</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>diseases</b> (OIDs) per 100, 000 employees was calculated. For needlestick injuries (NSI) a rate per 1, 000 employees was calculated. Results Within the five years from 2005 to 2009 a total of 384 HCV infections were recognised as OIDs (1. 5 / 100, 000 employees). Active TB was the second most frequent cause of an OID. While the numbers of HBV and HCV infections decreased, the numbers for active TB did not follow a clear pattern. Needlestick injuries (NSIs) were reported especially often at hospitals (29. 9 / 1, 000 versus 7. 4 / 1, 000 employees for all other HCWs). Conclusion Although they are declining, HCV infections remain frequent in HCWs, as do NSIs. Whether the reinforcement of the recommendations for the use of safety devices in Germany will prevent NSIs and therefore HCV infections should be closely observed. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{vaccination}} {{of general}} practitioners represents significant problems for two reasons: {{they can be}} a reservoir of infectious diseases for the patients they are in contact with and their attitudes towards vaccination can influence their preventative acts and consequently the vaccination coverage of the population. The anti-influenza vaccination of the care providers is associated with a decrease of mortality amongst patients. Hepatitis B {{is one of the most}} frequent professional <b>occupational</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>diseases</b> and vaccination is necessary for all the professionals at risk. Concerning the whooping-cough we can observe at the present time an increase in the number of cases. The "Conseil Supérieur" d'Hygiène "advises to propose vaccination of the people in contact with infants and people who have not HAD vaccination supplements in childhood. The rubella vaccination for unprotected women is also recommended for the care providers, to avoid the risk of infection and the possible implications for the foetus. The existing data in Belgium on the vaccination coverage of general practitioners is poor, but leads us to believe there is an insufficient vaccination coverage against these diseases. A study will shortly be undertaken to analyze the vaccination status of the Belgian French-speaking doctors and to further analyse their reasoning for any possible non-vaccination.

Targeted {{education}} of occupational physicians (OPs) may improve their rate of reporting <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases.</b> Aim: To study {{the effectiveness of}} an active multifaceted workshop aimed at improving OPs' reporting of <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases.</b> Methods: We undertook a comparative study with 112 OPs in the intervention group and 571 OPs as comparisons. The intervention was a 1 -day workshop. Measurements of <b>occupational</b> <b>disease</b> reporting activity in both groups in 6 -month periods {{before and after the}} intervention were collected via the national registration system. Measurements of OPs' knowledge, self-efficacy and satisfaction were made in the intervention group. Differences between the groups and predictive factors for reporting were subsequently analysed statistically. Results: The percentage of reporting OPs after the intervention was significantly higher in the intervention group compared to the comparison group at 19 versus 11 % (P < 0. 01). No differences were found in the average number of reported <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> per reporting physician after the intervention: 3. 7 (SD 5. 37) versus 3. 4 (SD 4. 56) (not significant). The self-efficacy score was a predictive factor for reporting <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> (P < 0. 05).

The {{objective of}} the thesis is to examine the occurrence of <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> in the Czech Republic as well as in the South Bohemia region within a specific time period. Expressed in focused literature, there are two hypotheses related to occupational healthcare: H 1 "The occurrence of <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> has a declining trend" and H 2 "The most common <b>occupational</b> <b>disease</b> in health care in the South Bohemia region is scabies for the years 2002, 2012 and 2013 ". A secondary analysis of data shows the occurrence of <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases,</b> which reflects the employees' level of healthcare. The National register of <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> is available on the official web site of The National Institute of Public Health in Prague, where single year data is available for further examination. Further data is provided by The Centre of occupational Health at The National Institute of Public Health in Prague. A point of discussion is "monitoring knowledgeability of employees in public healthcare regarding prevention against occupational diseases". Another issue is "the instruction of the medical workforce about prevention against occupational diseases". The focus group is the medical workforce of The Hospital of Czech Budweis, a. s. and The Hospital of T. Bati, a. s. in Zlín. The featured questionnaire research had twenty questions, with twelve focused on knowledge of prevention that minimised contraction of associated diseases. The research has discovered that the <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> in the health and social care field has a declining trend. The largest percentage of the population that has had scabies occurred in 2002. 139 cases were reported which was 53 % of all <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> that year. Scabies occurred in 72 cases in the year 2012, which was 55 % of all <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> in that year. In South Moravia, there were 44 cases of <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> in 2002, but only 6 in the year 2012. The statistics of 2012 imply a significant decline. In 2002, the region of Ústí and Labem had the greatest number of <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> cases 42 cases. But no case of <b>occupational</b> <b>disease</b> was found in 2002 in the region of Olomouc and in 2012 in the region of Zlín. This statistical data proves the hypothesis of a declining trend. The most significant occurrence of <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> was found in the nurse population of the South Bohemia region. The most common <b>occupational</b> <b>disease</b> was scabies. Nine cases were recorded which accounted for 30 % of all <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> in 2002, 2012 and 2013 in the South Bohemia region. The most <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> were found in 2002 17 cases. 2012 showed a decline of only 3 cases. In 2013, the occurrence of <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> increased to 10 cases compared to 2012. The hypothesis was statistically confirmed. The thesis could be used as a informative document for teaching occupational hygiene and also as document of reference for healthcare personnel to study common workplace diseases. This thesis can assist in prevention of <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases,</b> in particular <b>infectious</b> diseases...|$|R
40|$|Several {{recently}} published critical reviews conclude {{that there is}} strong epidemiological evidence for a relationship between occupational exposure to whole-body vibration (WBV), low back pain (LBP) and back disorders. Whether this exposure is only a modest or a substantial risk factor for the onset and recurrence of LBP is still a matter of debate. In spite of this controversy, four European Union countries have decided to recognize and compensate LBP and certain spinal disorders as an <b>occupational</b> <b>disease.</b> In this paper, we review the criteria currently in use for the recognition of this <b>occupational</b> <b>disease.</b> A search of the literature was performed; additional information was obtained in work visits to national <b>occupational</b> <b>disease</b> institutes in Germany, France and Belgium, in annual reports and national statistics on <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases.</b> Belgium was the "rst country to add WBV injury to the o$cial list of <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> (1978), followed by Germany (1993), the Netherlands (1997), and France (1999). The incidence of newly recognized cases in 199...|$|R
40|$|Background: In medical terms, <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> {{are defined}} as health {{disorders}} specifically associated with the working environment of people and their occupational activity. From the medical and legal perspectives, {{the vast majority of}} European countries consider particular diseases to be of occupational origin if they are mentioned in the current list of <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> and caused by exposure to factors in the working environment that are harmful to health. Objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the occurrence of cases of viral hepatitis certified as an <b>occupational</b> <b>disease</b> in Poland during 1979 – 2009. This article presents the medical, economic, and legal aspects of the epidemiology of hepatitis as an <b>occupational</b> <b>disease</b> in Poland. Materials and Methods: Publically available statistical data on certified <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> in Poland and data contained in individual “occupational disease diagnosis cards ” (based on data used in Poland statistical form), regarding certified cases of hepatitis among health care professionals, which were collected by the Department o...|$|R

40|$|Background: The aim of {{the annual}} {{analysis}} of the incidence of <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> in Poland is to evaluate {{the extent of the}} incidence and to identify its causes as well as activities involving factors that are harmful or annoying {{to such an extent that}} they result in <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases.</b> Material and Methods: <b>Occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> reporting forms supplied to the Central Register of <b>Occupational</b> <b>Diseases</b> were used as the study material. Results: In 2014, there were 2351 cases of <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> recorded, i. e., 16. 5 cases per 100 thousand of employees. The most numerous categories comprised infectious or parasitic diseases (borreliosis), pneumoconiosis, voice disorders and hearing loss (in total 79. 7 % of cases). The main causative factors of <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> were as follows: industrial dust containing free silica, tick-transmitted Borrelia spirochete, and the way the work is done, including excessive vocal effort, and noise. The highest incidence per 100 thousand workers were recorded in mining and quarrying (296), manufacturing (24. 9), education (24. 6), agriculture and forestry (24. 2) sectors. Conclusions: Compared with the previous year, there was a slight increase in the number of cases of certified <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> (6. 2 %), primarily due to the increased incidence of Lyme disease. The incidence of voice disorders among teachers continues to vary considerably in individual provinces (0 – 11. 3 / 10 000), reflecting the use of non-uniform diagnostic and certification methods.
