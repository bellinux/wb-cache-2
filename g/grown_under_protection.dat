40|$|The {{effects of}} temperature, {{photosynthetic}} photon flux density (PPFD) and photoperiod on vegetative growth and flowering of the raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) 'Autumn Bliss' were investigated. Increased temperature resulted in an increased rate of vegetative growth and a greater rate of progress to flowering. Optimum temperatures lay in the low to mid 20 degreesC range. Above this the rate of plant development declined. Increased PPFD also advanced flowering. While photoperiod did not significantly affect the rate of vegetative growth, flowering occurred earliest at intermediate photoperiods and was delayed by extreme photoperiods.

OBJECTIVE: Identification of a new bacterial disease on strawberry. METHOD: Identification and characterization {{was based on the}} requirements of EPPO (European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization), followed by a pathogenicity test on strawberry plants for verification of the virulence. RESULTS: The isolates exhibited biochemical profiles closely related to Erwinia pyrifoliae reference strain LMG 25888. The isolates were further identified as E. pyrifoliae based on the real time PCR assay. Pathogenicity of several isolates was tested and confirmed on potted strawberry plants (cvs. Elsanta and Selva). CONCLUSION: Erwinia pyrifoliae is a pathogen on strawberry. Thus far occurrence of this pathogen on strawberry has not been reported nor its presence outside Asia...|$|E

40|$|Working Trees {{help make}} {{agricultural}} systems more sustainable by protecting crops and livestock, conserving natural resources, improving human environments, and providing sources of income. Putting trees {{to work in}} conservation and production systems for farms, ranches, and nearby communities means planting the right trees, in the right places, and in the correct design to achieve desired objectives. Agroforestry is a unique land management approach for landowners and anyone who cares about working lands and natural resources. Agroforestry practices provide opportunities to integrate productivity and profitability with environmental stewardship and result in healthy and sustainable agricultural systems that can {{be passed on to}} future generations. Agroforestry practices include field, farmstead, and livestock windbreaks; riparian forest buffers along waterways; silvopasture systems with trees and forage growing together for livestock grazing; alley cropping annual crops with high-value trees; forest farming operations where high-value specialty crops are <b>grown</b> <b>under</b> the <b>protection</b> of a managed forest canopy; and a variety of special applications to help manage natural resource issues. Within a landscape-scale management approach, agroforestry can help to reduce the zone of conflict between rural and urban land uses.

The vast majority is under very little - if any - management. Agroforestry, specifically forest farming, has the potential to provide producers an opportunity to put these acres under management. In forest farming, high-value specialty crops that require some degree of shade are <b>grown</b> <b>under</b> the <b>protection</b> of the surrounding forest's canopy. The canopy is judiciously modified and managed to provide the proper amount of shade necessary for the specialty crop. Overstory trees are managed for high-value timber or veneer logs. Ferns may be an option to forest farmers as a high-value understory crop. The purpose of this research is to quantify the effects of various levels of light intensity on selected fern species believed to have potential use in the floral green and landscape industries and, to determine the feasibility of commercially grown ferns in Missouri...|$|R

A randomized block design was used in a factorial 3 x 3 + 1 with four replications, and 36 plants per plot, with the first factor of color of plastic used in mulching (black, silver and white) and the second factor nonwoven textile with different times of use (first and third crop nonwoven under textile and without nonwoven) and an absolute control (no mulching and without nonwoven). The production variables evaluated were: yield (commercial, noncommercial, and total fruit yield), and fruit quality (soluble solids - SS, titratable acidity - TA and SS/TA). The use of mulching and protection of plants with nonwoven textile provided a higher yield of watermelon fruits in relation to bare soil with and without nonwoven textile protection.

We compared the effects of a light-diffusing plastic film and a clear plastic film on growth of Batavia lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) in two greenhouses during five growth periods. Lettuce <b>grown</b> <b>under</b> the light-diffusing film were smaller (up to 36 %) than control plants <b>grown</b> <b>under</b> the clear film, due to the fewer leaves per plant (up to 22 %) and lower mean values of individual leaf area (up to 29 %). The photosynthetically active radiations use efficiency was sometimes lower (up to 23 %) in lettuces <b>grown</b> <b>under</b> the light-diffusing film. The pigment contents tended to be lower in plants <b>grown</b> <b>under</b> the light-diffusing plastic. The total macroelement contents of the lettuces <b>grown</b> <b>under</b> the light-diffusing plastic were up to 10 % higher than in the lettuces <b>grown</b> <b>under</b> clear plastic, mainly {{as a result of}} higher leaf K contents (up to 19 % higher). In addition, use of the light-diffusing plastic tended to increase leaf nitrate contents (by up to 23 %). The leaf solid soluble content and acidity values were higher in the lettuces <b>grown</b> <b>under</b> the light-diffusing plastic, while leaf pH values were lower than in the control plants.

In the case of E. coli, changing the conditions of growth from anaerobic to 5 atm of O 2 caused a 25 -fold {{increase in the level}} of {{superoxide dismutase}}. Induction of this enzyme was a response to O 2 rather than to pressure, since 20 atm of N 2 was without effect.

S. faecalis did not contain perceptible levels of catalase under any of the growth conditions investigated by Stanier, Doudoroff, and Adelberg (23), and the concentration of catalase in E. coli was not affected by the presence of O 2 during growth. S. faecalis, which had been <b>grown</b> <b>under</b> 100 % O 2 and which therefore contained an elevated level of superoxide dismutase, was more resistant of 46 atm of O 2 than were cells which had been <b>grown</b> <b>under</b> N 2.

Cells <b>grown</b> <b>under</b> noncontrolled pH were more resistant to both drying and heating than cells <b>grown</b> <b>under</b> controlled pH but no significant differences were observed during storage. The intracellular proteins profile of cells <b>grown</b> <b>under</b> both conditions was studied by two-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Eight proteins were identified using automated mass spectrometry (MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data acquisition. Of the identified proteins, only cochaperonin GroES corresponded to a known heat shock protein (HSP). The other proteins identified are proteins involved in glycolysis. For cells <b>grown</b> <b>under</b> noncontrolled pH the expression of the Hsp 70, GroES and GroEL, measured by Western blotting, was enhanced. Conclusions: The higher resistance of cells <b>grown</b> <b>under</b> noncontrolled pH correlates with the enhanced production of heat shock proteins.

These results indicate that wheat, {{and to a lesser extent}} Arabidopsis, can be successfully <b>grown</b> <b>under</b> red LED's alone, but supplemental blue light is required with red LED's to sufficiently match the growth characteristics and seed yield associated with plants <b>grown</b> <b>under</b> white light...|$|R
