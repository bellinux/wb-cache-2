40|$|An {{inertial}} confinement fusion implosion {{driven by the}} OMEGA laser takes place over a span of approximately one nanosecond. To study the physics of the implosion on OMEGA, a streak camera with subnanosecond time resolution, good spatial resolution, and high dynamic range is necessary. The Rochester Optical Streak System (ROSS) is able to make measurements with 1 % accuracy using its Optical Calibration Module (OCM). Software scripts have been written to optimize the alignment and focus of the camera using the OCM. Because the P 510 streak tube has a slot accelerator and a single electrostatic lens, it will have optimal temporal and spatial foci at different focus voltages. A common mode voltage (CMV) added to the deflection plate voltage allows the plates {{to act as an}} additional electrostatic lens, while still retaining deflection capabilities. This technique focuses a P 510 tube simultaneously in both the temporal and spatial dimensions.

Apart from the continuous improvement in resolution of the classical high resolution electron microscopes (HREM), new possibilities emerge, such as, correction of the spherical aberration both in transmission and {{scanning transmission electron microscopy}} (TEM and STEM, respectively), combination of TEM with high angle annular dark field (HAADF) STEM, monochromators, and offaxis holography.

40|$|The {{electron}} beams {{produced by}} two different welders were examined using computer assisted tomographic (CT) analysis. The machines used are Hamilton Standard welders with 150 kV/ 50 mA maximum. One machine uses a ribbon filament {{while the other}} uses a hairpin filament. The objective {{of this study was}} to characterize the beam power distribution on each machine to see if weld parameters could easily be transferred between machines. Beam <b>focus,</b> <b>voltage,</b> and current settings were pre-selected to duplicate the welding conditions used in LLNL program applications. The results show that the actual beam currents measured by Faraday cup are 5 to 10 % higher for the first machine and 30 % lower for the second. The CT analysis of the beam shapes shows that the hairpin filament welder produces an elliptical beam shape in the sharp focus condition that defocuses to a diamond shape. The ribbon filament welder produced less of an elliptical beam shape in the sharp focus condition, but when defocused, acquires an elliptical shape. CT analysis of the effects of defocus on the peak power density shows that the hairpin filament drops in peak power density much more quickly than the ribbon filament for a given amount of defocus. Furthermore, it was more difficult to find and repeat the sharp focus condition for the hairpin filament, particularly at higher beam currents...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} study of field emitter arrays with or without an integrated focus electrode. The former configuration {{is referred to as}} field emitter with integrated focus (IFE-FEA) or double-gate FEA (DG-FEA). The main application of IFE-FEA is to improve the resolution of field emission displays (FEDs). We developed the first analytical model of conical field emitters that captures all details of device geometry and produces quantitatively accurate closed-form expressions for the FN coefficients. A novel CMP-based process for making IFE-FEA is presented. We obtained devices with gate and focus apertures of 0. 8 and 1. 2 gm diameter, respectively, which is 1. 5 times smaller than in any previously reported IFE-FEA. Single-gate FEAs whose gate was identical to the lower gate of the IFE-FEA were also fabricated. Their emission current was 100 nA/tip at 45 V; for IFE-FEAs with the gate and focus biased at the same potential (VG=VF) this figure was 100 nA/tip at 42 V, in agreement with the analytical model. It was deduced that the tip radius of curvature (ROC) is 2. 4 - 3. 6 nm. Analytical model, numerical simulation, and TEM micrographs all gave tip ROC values in this range. We generalized the FN equation to IFE-FEA and used 4 -terminal measurements to determine gate and focus field factors, [3 G and 13 F. Their ratio was found to vary from 0. 15 (emission current independent of <b>focus</b> <b>voltage)</b> to 2. 7. We demonstrated via numerical simulation that this ratio is probably determined by the degree of gate shielding of the tip. (cont.) We studied electron beam collimation with lowering VF at different values of VG. It was observed that the optimal VF is about 0. 25 VG. Beam collimation was also studied as a function of cathode-anode separation - a novel experiment. From these measurements we deduced horizontal velocity of electrons and determined that it is practically equal to zero when the beam is optimally collimated. Under optimal collimation, diameter of the spot size produced by a 5 x 5 array with a 40 x 40 ptm 2 footprint on the phosphor screen biased at 5 kV and located 15 mm away was at most 50 tm. by Leonard Dvorson.

40|$|Direct Analysis in Real Time (DART) ionization/mass {{spectrometry}} {{allows for}} the high throughput analysis {{of a wide range}} of materials including but not limited to: solids, liquids, powders, tablets, and plant materials. The ability to detect cocaine was established in a reproducible manner with the use of a DART ionization source (IonSense Inc., Saugus, MA) interfaced to a modified single quadrupole mass spectrometer. Development of a methodology for the detection of cocaine within contrived street quality drug mixtures involved the optimization of the ionization source, sample introduction mechanism, ion guide, and mass analysis parameters. An analytical method was created that utilized ionized helium carrier gas heated to 300 °C and an automated sample introduction apparatus consisting of a Linear Rail Enclosure that holds consumable QuickStrip^TM sample cards. Ionized molecules were then fragmented by manipulation of voltage levels within the ion guide to gain more structural information prior to detection by a single quadrupole mass spectrometer. Cocaine was detected by the modified DART/MS analytical platform and gave two peaks within the mass spectrum at m/z 304 and 182. Optimization of in-source fragmentation by manual adjustment of the skimmer <b>focus</b> <b>voltage</b> allowed for the reproducible fragmentation of cocaine and the ability to increase or decrease the amount of fragmentation seen between the two peaks detected for cocaine. With the use of fragmentation, this analytical platform can be classified as a Category A technique as defined by the Scientific Working Group for the Analysis of Seized Drugs. The robust detection of cocaine was demonstrated for reference samples at concentrations as low as 10 ng/μL (50 ng) with high signal abundance greater than ten times the signal to noise ratio. Furthermore, the detection of cocaine at 10 ng/μL was demonstrated for multi component mixtures of up to 14 additional components containing common adulterants and diluents found within street quality samples. In total, 25 common excipients were tested using the same method parameters as optimized for cocaine analysis. Of these 25 excipients tested, five were not detected in positive ion mode (one could be detected in negative ion mode). Of the twenty excipients that could be detected by mass spectrometry, two pairs of excipients (levamisole/tetramisole and creatine/creatinine) could not be differentiated from each other. There were no excipients tested that had equivalent m/z values as those of cocaine. Experimentation into the effects of various excipients at multiple concentrations on the abundance of the two cocaine peaks was performed. Regardless of excipient amount (up to 10 times more concentrated than cocaine) and the number of components (up to 15 total components) the ratio of abundance between the m/z 304 to 182 peaks did not vary greater than 22 % relative standard deviation. A match criteria protocol was developed for the ability of an analyst to confirm the presence of cocaine within unknown forensic case samples that have previously tested positive for the presumptive identification of cocaine. The identification of cocaine was based on various factors such as the signal to noise ratio at m/z 304 and 182, the ratio of abundance between those two peaks as well as positive and negative controls. This match criteria protocol was utilized for 25 double blind mock forensic casework samples was performed. Determination for the presence of cocaine within these unknown samples gave an analyst error rate of 0 %, with no false positives or false negatives predicted. To further aid human interpretation and identification of compounds within mixtures, the advanced chemometric software, Analyze IQ, was utilized. Development of predictive classification models using a combination of pre-processing steps, principle component analysis and machine learning techniques was achieved. Models were built using 381 unique samples for the purposes of identifying the presence of cocaine within unknown samples. Of all methods available within the Analyze IQ software, the optimization of a model using principle component analysis with support vector machine regression with a radial basis function kernel yielded an initial error rate of 0 % for 72 samples tested. Furthermore, of the samples tested against the model, 20 samples were comprised of excipients that were not incorporated into the initial model development process. The inclusion of these samples (10 spiked with cocaine, 10 absent of cocaine), shows that predictive modeling based software can provide an accurate, robust, and evolving approach to the identification of cocaine within sample compositions that have not previously been tested and stored in a database of known reference samples. Predictive modeling has advantages over current mass spectral libraries, which are limited to the identification of pure compounds. To further test the abilities of predictive models, optimized machine learning models were applied to 25 double blind mock forensic casework samples. The predictive modeling error rate was identical to the human interpretation rate for the double blind mock casework samples with a 0 % error rate. Using the DART/MS analytical platform, 25 mock forensic casework samples along with positive and negative controls were analyzed and identified for the presence of cocaine within 30 minutes. On the order of 15 to 30 times faster than modern GC/MS and LC/MS methods, the ability to analyze and identify samples faster would allow for an increase in samples being processed on a daily basis and allow for the reduction of case backlogs that currently plague controlled substances sections of forensic science laboratories throughout the United States...|$|E

LC/polymer composites, consisting of LC and monomer, are an important extension of pure LC systems, which offer more flexibility and much richer functionality than LC alone.
