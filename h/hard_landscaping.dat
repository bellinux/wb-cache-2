Since 2000, both City Square and Millennium Square have been redeveloped with <b>hard</b> <b>landscaping.</b> In an interview with Martin Wainwright, the northern editor of The Guardian, architect Irena Bauman, praised City Square for being a well designed and well used public space, however she criticised The Plaza Tower development for its lack of public space, stating that the only space made available was for service vehicles.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hard</b> <b>landscaping</b> {{involves}} {{projects that}} cover {{the entirety of the}} yard and that are necessary before soft landscaping features come into play. <b>Hard</b> <b>landscaping</b> is very much altering the foundation of the yard, the “bricks and mortar”, and so only once this is completed can you begin to focus on the more beautiful features of the yard, hard-soft landscaping such as the floral arrangements, trees and shrubs and perfecting your color schemes. One key feature of <b>hard</b> <b>landscaping</b> is to do with the absorption of water - something that is of great importance given the climate. <b>Hard</b> <b>landscaping</b> ensures that worrying about water after heavy rain or snowfall isn’t an issue. The right water absorption and irrigation system installed through <b>hard</b> <b>landscaping,</b> coupled with hard materials that safely move water away from the property can ensure that soil movement is never a problem and that your yard stays a drier, enjoyable living space rather than a wet and muddy bog. There are soft landscaping options that can help to achieve this, but the bulk of this is definitely achieved through <b>hard</b> <b>landscaping.</b>|$|E

50|$|As {{the primary}} {{gardening}} programme on BBC Television, the programme attracts vocal {{opinion on the}} merits of the presenters and the content of each episode. The 2009 season introduced several new features, many of which were not well received. Criticism was especially harsh regarding the high cost of certain features such as the <b>hard</b> <b>landscaping</b> and raised-beds and what was widely regarded as the dumbed-down and derivative content. The 'Cool Wall' which mimicked Top Gear, a competition for training places which aped The Apprentice, children from CBeebies and content such as a feature on garden gnomes annoyed many viewers. Much of the widespread criticism was also directed at the fact that the show no longer came from a real garden.|$|E
