5|$|The shock {{from the}} Japanese sleeper ray is strong but not {{life-threatening}} to humans. There is an observation of a ray that reacted to being touched {{with a camera}} by rubbing its back against the camera port, suggesting that it may actively defend itself if disturbed. The Japanese sleeper ray adapts poorly to captivity. This and other species of <b>electric</b> <b>rays</b> are used in biomedical research because their electric organs have an abundance of ion channels and acetylcholine receptors, and {{can serve as a}} model for the human nervous system.|$|E
5|$|Though little {{specific}} data are available, the Japanese sleeper ray {{is believed to}} be caught incidentally in shrimp trawls and other demersal fishing gear throughout its range. It is not utilized economically; however, <b>electric</b> <b>rays</b> tend not to survive being caught and discarded, and shrimp trawling is known to have caused marked population declines in other electric ray species elsewhere. Given the high intensity of fishing activity off East Asia, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific {{electric}} ray {{was described by}} American ichthyologist William Orville Ayres, the first Curator of Ichthyology at the California Academy of Sciences, who named it after the U.S. state where it was first discovered by science. Ayers published his account in 1855, in the inaugural volume of the Academy's Proceedings; no type specimens were designated. In 1861, Theodore Gill placed this species in his newly created genus Tetronarce, {{on the basis of}} its smooth-rimmed spiracles. Later authors have generally regarded Tetronarce as a subgenus of Torpedo. Closely similar <b>electric</b> <b>rays</b> found off Peru, Chile, and Japan may be the same as this species. Other common names used for this ray include California torpedo ray, Pacific torpedo, or simply {{electric ray}} or torpedo ray. This species is placed in the genus Tetronarce.|$|E
50|$|The Gulf torpedo, marbled <b>electric</b> <b>ray,</b> or {{variable}} <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> (Torpedo sinuspersici) is {{a species of}} <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> in the family Torpedinidae. It {{is found in the}} Indian Ocean, but may represent a species flock of several local endemic species. It is distinguishable from other Torpedo species in its range by its ornate dorsal coloration.|$|R
50|$|The blackspotted {{numbfish}} (Narcine timlei), {{also known}} as the black-spotted <b>electric</b> <b>ray,</b> Indian <b>electric</b> <b>ray,</b> largespotted numbfish, and spotted numbfish, is a species of numbfish in the family Narcinidae.|$|R
50|$|The Brazilian <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> (Narcine brasiliensis) is {{a species}} of <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> in the family Narcinidae. It inhabits reefs along the western coast of the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico from North Carolina to {{northern}} Argentina.|$|R
5|$|The shock {{generated}} by the Pacific electric ray can be enough to knock down an adult human. It should be treated with caution, especially at night when it is active, and {{has been known to}} charge at divers with its mouth agape if harassed. It is not known to be responsible for any fatalities, but may have been involved in several unexplained, fatal diving accidents. This species fares poorly in captivity, as it usually refuses to feed when first introduced into an aquarium. Since 2000, the Aquarium of the Bay and the Monterey Bay Aquarium have had some success keeping Pacific <b>electric</b> <b>rays</b> by offering them moving food.|$|E
5|$|Solitary and nocturnal, the Pacific {{electric}} ray can generate up to 45 volts of electricity {{for the purposes}} of subduing prey or self-defense. It feeds mainly on bony fishes, ambushing them from the substrate during the day and actively hunting for them at night. Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, meaning that the embryos are initially nourished by yolk, later supplemented by histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Females bear litters of 17–20 pups, probably once every other year. Care should be exercised around the Pacific {{electric ray}}, as it has been known to act aggressively if provoked and its electric shock can potentially incapacitate a diver. It and other <b>electric</b> <b>rays</b> are used as model organisms for biomedical research. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern, as it is not fished in any significant numbers.|$|E
5|$|The shock {{from the}} ocellated {{electric}} ray is not dangerous to humans. It occasionally {{appears in the}} home aquarium trade, but is difficult to keep because it requires live invertebrates for food. The ocellated electric ray and other <b>electric</b> <b>rays</b> are used as model organisms in biomedical research because their electric organs are rich in ion channels and acetylcholine receptors, which play important roles in the human nervous system. The protein agrin, which concentrates acetylcholine receptors during human embryonic development, was first isolated from this species. Though the ocellated electric ray is not utilized economically, it is caught incidentally by shrimp trawlers. Its mortality from fishing has not been quantified but {{is thought to be}} high, considering that trawling operations in the Atlantic are known to take Diplobatis species in large numbers. The catch rate is also probably underestimated due to problematic identification. Given the restricted range of this species and the intensity of trawling within its habitat, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Vulnerable.|$|E
5000|$|The giant <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> or Cortez <b>electric</b> <b>ray,</b> Narcine entemedor, is {{a species}} of numbfish, family Narcinidae, native to the eastern Pacific Ocean from the Gulf of California to Panama. It is found in shallow water on sandy bottoms and {{sometimes}} adjacent to reefs. This species {{is closely related to}} the lesser <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> (Narcine bancroftii) from the western Atlantic, and may represent the same species. The specific epithet entemedor seems to be the Spanish equivalent of [...] "intimidator".|$|R
5|$|The {{electric}} shock delivered by a marbled <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> can be severe {{but is not}} directly life-threatening. Its electrogenic properties have been known since classical antiquity, when live rays were used to treat conditions such as chronic headaches. This and other <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> species are used as model organisms in biomedical research. Various coastal demersal fisheries take the marbled <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> as bycatch; captured rays are usually discarded as they have little commercial value. The impact of fishing on its population is uncertain, and thus International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this ray under Data Deficient. In the Mediterranean Sea, it remains the most common <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> and in some areas may be increasing in number.|$|R
50|$|The shortlip <b>electric</b> <b>ray,</b> Narcine brevilabiata is {{a species}} of <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> in the {{numbfish}} family, Narcinidae. It may be synonymous with the blackspotted numbfish, Narcine maculata. The shortlip <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> is found in shallow continental shelf waters offshore of China, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam, {{at a depth of}} 41 to 70 meters. It is assessed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, as it is caught as by-catch in large numbers by shrimp trawling fisheries operating throughout its range.|$|R
5|$|The Pacific {{electric}} ray and its relatives {{are used as}} model organisms for biomedical research, because their electric organs contain an abundance of important nervous system proteins such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and acetylcholinesterase. In the 1970s and 1980s, acetylcholine receptors from this species and the marbled {{electric ray}} (T.marmorata) became the first neurotransmitter receptors to be isolated and sequenced, in what {{is considered to be}} a landmark success in the field of neurobiology. This led to a number of further advances, one of the most significant being the elucidation of the pathophysiology underlying the disease myasthenia gravis. A small commercial fishery in southern California supplies Pacific <b>electric</b> <b>rays</b> for research purposes; as of 2005 this fishery may have employed as few as two fishers. Otherwise, this ray has no economic value. It is caught incidentally by commercial trawl and gillnet fisheries, and on hook-and-line by sport anglers. These activities appear to have little impact on its population, leading it to be listed under Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Fishing for this ray is not managed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council.|$|E

500|$|The {{common torpedo}} and other <b>electric</b> <b>rays</b> were {{familiar}} to the peoples of classical antiquity. Torpedo was the Roman name for <b>electric</b> <b>rays,</b> derived from Latin torpere meaning [...] "to be numb". Carl Linnaeus, known as the [...] "father of taxonomy", scientifically described the common torpedo as Raja torpedo in the 1758 tenth edition of his Systema Naturae. However, the common torpedo also appeared in at least 52 pre-Linnaean sources under various names such as Torpedo, Raja tota lævis, Torpedo maculosa, and Torpedo Sinûs Persici. These early accounts, including Linnaeus's, confounded the common torpedo with other electric ray species. As Linnaeus did not indicate any type specimens, the designation of a lectotype or neotype is warranted {{in the interest of}} taxonomic stability. This measure has yet to be taken.|$|E

500|$|The ocellated <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> or {{bullseye}} <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> (Diplobatis ommata) is {{a species}} of <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> in the family Narcinidae, native to the shallow inshore waters of the eastern central Pacific from the Gulf of California to Ecuador. Reaching [...] in length, this species has a rounded pectoral fin disc and pelvic fins with convex margins. Its short and thick tail bears two dorsal fins and terminates in a triangular caudal fin. The ocellated <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> is named for the distinctive large eyespot on the middle of its disc, consisting of a black or yellow center surrounded by concentric rings. Its dorsal coloration is otherwise highly variable, ranging from plain to ornately patterned on a light to dark brown background. The front part of its disc is darker brown.|$|R

500|$|Relative to {{its small}} size, the onefin {{electric}} ray can deliver an extremely powerful electric shock {{to defend itself}} against predators, which include the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus). It propels itself using its muscular tail rather than its pectoral fins. The diet of this species consists mainly of polychaete worms. The reproductive biology of the onefin electric ray has not been documented; presumably it is viviparous like other <b>electric</b> <b>rays.</b> Males mature sexually at somewhere between [...] long, while females mature at around [...] long.|$|E
500|$|The finless sleeper ray was {{described}} as a new species and genus by English zoologist John Edward Gray in an 1831 issue of the scientific journal Zoological Miscellany. His account was based on two specimens collected from Penang in Malaysia by General Thomas Hardwicke and presented to the British Museum. Hence, Gray named the ray Temera hardwickii, or [...] "Hardwicke's Temera". He noted that the new genus was most closely affiliated to the genus Narke, because it has no dorsal fins while Narke has only one and other <b>electric</b> <b>rays</b> have two. A 2012 phylogenetic study, based on morphology, corroborated the close relationship between Temera and Narke.|$|E
500|$|The pelvic fins {{are only}} {{slightly}} overlapped by the disc; each is long, wide, and roughly triangular, with trailing margins {{that are more}} concave in males than in females. The tail is stout and much shorter than the disc. Unique amongst <b>electric</b> <b>rays,</b> there are no dorsal fins. The tail terminates in a fairly large, triangular caudal fin {{about as long as}} wide, with rounded corners. The skin entirely lacks dermal denticles. This species is plain light brown dorsally, sometimes with darker markings and whitish spots, and pale ventrally, with broad darker margins on the pectoral and pelvic fins. Possibly the smallest cartilaginous fish, the smallest known adult finless sleeper ray measured only [...] long and weighed [...] Few individuals exceed [...] and the maximum length is thought to be , though there is a dubious old record of a specimen [...] long.|$|E

500|$|Like {{the rest}} of its family, the ocellated {{electric}} ray can defend itself by producing a moderate electric shock. During the day, this solitary ray spends most of its time lying partially buried in sand, often near rocky reefs. It becomes more active at night, using its pelvic fins to [...] "hop" [...] along the sea floor. It feeds on small crustaceans such as amphipods and shrimp, as well as polychaete worms. Parasites documented from this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium dollyae, A. maryanskii, and A. royi, and the fluke Anaporrhutum euzeti. Though reproductive details are unknown, the ocellated electric ray is presumably viviparous, with the developing embryos sustained first by yolk and later by maternally produced histotroph ("uterine milk"), as in other <b>electric</b> <b>rays.</b> Females mature sexually at under [...] long; the maturation size for males is unknown.|$|E
500|$|The onefin {{electric}} ray {{was described by}} German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1789, in the 13th edition of Systema Naturae. Gmelin's name for the species was printed as Raja capensis in some copies of the book, and as Raja rapensis in others. The original spelling was probably rapensis, which modern taxonomists regard as a typesetting error as the etymology of capensis ("of the Cape [...] ") is far more reasonable. Later sources have consistently used capensis, though to officially fix the specific epithet under that spelling would require {{a decision by the}} International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN). Gmelin did not refer to any type specimens. In 1826, German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup created the new genus Narke for this species, separating it from the other <b>electric</b> <b>rays</b> known at the time {{on the basis of its}} curved back and single dorsal fin. Later, more species were assigned to Narke.|$|E
500|$|At night, {{when many}} diurnal fishes descend {{from the water}} column and become {{inactive}} a short distance above the bottom, the Pacific electric ray switches to an active hunting strategy. It stalks fish by slowly swimming or simply drifting through the water; when it closes to [...] of the prey, it lunges forward and again envelops the prey within its disc while delivering shocks. To better secure the fish within its disc, the ray will make short kicks with its tail that sometimes send it into barrel rolls or somersaults. Finally, the stunned prey is maneuvered to the mouth with ripples of the disc. In one recorded case, a [...] long female captured and consumed a [...] long jack mackerel (Trachurus symmetricus) in under ten seconds. Nighttime seine net sampling at the surface of Monterey Bay has captured Pacific <b>electric</b> <b>rays</b> in surprising numbers, suggesting that they rise upward from the bottom to feed on small fishes.|$|E

500|$|The coffin ray is a {{slow and}} weak swimmer that moves forward with a jerky, fluttery motion. It is nocturnal and spends {{most of the day}} buried in {{sediment}} with only its spiracles showing. When disturbed, it has been observed performing a possible defense behavior, wherein it erupts from the bottom and swims in a loop with its mouth agape. This species is sometimes stranded on land by the ebbing tide, but can survive out of water for hours. Like in other <b>electric</b> <b>rays,</b> the coffin ray's electric organs are derived from muscle tissue and consist of numerous vertical columns, each formed from a stack of jelly-filled [...] "electric plates" [...] that essentially acts as a battery. It is capable of generating up to 200 volts of electricity and delivering 50 shocks over span of ten minutes, with each successive shock weakening. The coffin ray employs electricity both to subdue prey and deter predators.|$|E
500|$|The pelvic fins are rounded and {{slightly}} overlapped by the disc at the front. The first dorsal fin is triangular with a rounded apex, originating {{in front of}} the pelvic fin insertions. The second dorsal fin is only one-half to two-thirds as large as the first; the distance between the dorsal fins is less than the length of the first dorsal fin base. The stout tail comprises about one-third of the total length, terminating in a caudal fin shaped like an equilateral triangle with slightly convex margins. The skin is soft and completely devoid of dermal denticles (scales). The dorsal coloration is a plain dark brown to gray, sometimes with a few diffuse spots, and darkening at the fin margins. The underside is white, with dark fin margins. The largest of the <b>electric</b> <b>rays,</b> the Atlantic torpedo can measure [...] long and weigh [...] However, a length of [...] and weight of [...] is more typical. Females attain a larger size than males.|$|E
500|$|Long {{before any}} {{knowledge}} of electricity existed, people were aware of shocks from electric fish. Ancient Egyptian texts dating from 2750 BCE referred to these fish as the [...] "Thunderer of the Nile", and described them as the [...] "protectors" [...] of all other fish. Electric fish were again reported millennia later by ancient Greek, Roman and Arabic naturalists and physicians. Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks delivered by catfish and <b>electric</b> <b>rays,</b> and knew that such shocks could travel along conducting objects. Patients suffering from ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish {{in the hope that}} the powerful jolt might cure them. Possibly the earliest and nearest approach to the discovery of the identity of lightning, and electricity from any other source, is to be attributed to the Arabs, who before the 15th century had the Arabic word for lightning ra‘ad (...) applied to the electric ray.|$|E
