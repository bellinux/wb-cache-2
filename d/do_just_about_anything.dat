500|$|During the strike, the NFLPA {{promoted}} two [...] "AFC-NFC 'all-star' games." [...] One {{was held}} at RFK Stadium in Washington D.C. on October 17, 1982, and the second {{was held at}} the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum a day later. One of the few stars who did play, future Hall of Fame running back John Riggins, explained [...] "I guess I'll <b>do</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> for money." [...] Despite a local TV blackout and ticket prices starting at six dollars, neither game drew well; only 8,760 fans attended in Washington, D.C., and just 5,331 attended in Los Angeles. With no NFL games to air, CBS replayed the previous Super Bowl and aired Division III football; Pat Summerall and John Madden, for example, covered a game between Baldwin Wallace and Wittenberg. NBC acquired the rights to Canadian Football League games from ESPN, and aired them with NFL-like production values; the first four games it showed were all blowouts, however, with poor ratings, and the network gave up.|$|E
500|$|Adam Buckman of the New York Post did {{not enjoy}} Madonna's guest appearance, observing that she [...] "proves she'll <b>do</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> for attention, {{including}} going on a dumb show like Will & Grace [...] Madonna did herself no favors by agreeing {{to participate in a}} cheap, desperate ratings stunt." [...] Nonetheless, Buckman said that in the episode [...] "she delivered her lines capably" [...] and that her role as Liz was with [...] "admirable gusto." [...] Entertainment Weekly writer Ken Tucker noted that the singer's appearance was [...] "one of the worst, if most fascinating, celebrity cameos I've ever witnessed." [...] Tucker said that [...] "Madonna-as-TV-actress" [...] defeated [...] "Madonna-as-movie-actress" [...] primarily because [...] "she was paired with a pro like [...] Mullally and had less screen time than she did in her most recent movie dud, Swept Away. According to David Kronke for the Whittier Daily News, [...] "Madonna may have put the kibosh on her video, but not on her guest appearance as Karen's... new best bosom buddy." [...] While Charleston Daily Mails Kevin McDonough reported that Madonna appearing on Will & Grace was [...] "clearly a reprise" [...] of singer Cher's guest stints on the episodes [...] "Gypsies, Tramps and Weed" [...] and [...] "A.I.: Artificial Insemination". McDonough wrote that the cameos made by Cher [...] "made sense", and that the latter [...] "has an ability to laugh at herself that Madonna has never exhibited." [...] Mark A. Perigard of the Boston Herald said Will & Grace had been [...] "guilty of some pretty poor stunt casting" [...] and included Madonna as a primary example. Writing for The Times publication, Lisa Verrico noted that Will & Grace was becoming the [...] "new" [...] Friends opining with all the guest stars in season five—Demi Moore, Minnie Driver, and Madonna—that have been featured on the show.|$|E

500|$|As {{production}} continued, Tom Hall {{dubbed the}} game's scripting language [...] "APE" [...] (Anachronox Programming Language). Hall explained, [...] "I call it my new Apple II because it's {{so much fun}} to program in and it takes all the drudgery out of it. It's sort of if you mushed together C, Basic and Java in a way—for programming people it's sort of Windows based. It began as a defined dialogue window, but provided variables so that you could position and move a picture. So from there it grew like UNIX with little bits and pieces, and you have things that initialize data to the window, things that constantly update the window, and things that happen after the window, in little code chunks and with that you can do any little thing." [...] Hall wrote and coded the mini-game Bugaboo for Anachronox in 15 hours to demonstrate the environment's simplicity. Other tools developed for the game were B.E.D. (a battle editor), ION Radiant (for level design, based on QERadiant), NoxDrop (for item and character placement), and Planet (a spline-based camera system coded by Joey Liaw). Ion Storm worked with QuakeEd developer Robert Duffy to create QERadiant, later adapted to ION Radiant. Hall lauded Planet: [...] "you can control entities on paths, trigger events, manipulate particles, and <b>do</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> you please. One of the more common team beliefs is that the only true limit to Planet is the person controlling it." [...] Hall aimed to provide several end-user modification tools, such as one to allow gamers to create their own MysTech elements. Other programs would allow implementation of new dialogue, voice-acting, and camera work. Ion Storm developed tutorials and documentation for each tool.|$|E

In 2008, Ashanti, along with others celebrities, taped a PSA to help stop violence and discrimination towards the LGBT community in response to the death of Lawrence King, an eighth-grader at E.O. Green Junior High School who was shot because of his sexual orientation and gender expression. That same year, she launched a special on-line campaign called [...] "I Declare Me..." [...] with Wal-Mart. The campaign's core is a very personal focus on the self-definition and empowerment of women across the United States, with its home base at Ashanti's official website. The campaign creates a safe and inclusive on-line space to for women to share testimonies on the site. Participants are able to openly declare their own breakthroughs, revelations, struggles and victories in every life area they choose: career, birth, death, relationships, and personal situations. [...] "I Declare Me..." [...] also invites women to a virtual discussion with Ashanti on such issues as voter registration, teen obesity, and other concerns facing women today.|$|E

5000|$|Vince Leo from Qwipster's Movie Reviews {{gave the}} film {{one and a}} half out of five stars. He was very {{critical}} about the movie and didn't find any good aspect in the production. [...] "Unless you are a young child who is obsessed with unicorns, there is just nothing here at all to recommend.

Endy doubted that biocomputers would ever be as fast as traditional computers, but added {{that is not the}} goal of his research. [...] "We're building computers that will operate in a place where your cellphone isn't going to work", he said. [...] Medical devices with built-in biological computers could monitor, or even alter, cell behavior from inside a patient's body. [...] ExtremeTech writes: Moving forward, though, the potential for real biological computers is immense. We are essentially talking about functional computers that can sense their surroundings, and then manipulate their host cells into <b>doing</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything.</b> Biological computers might be used as an early-warning system for disease, or simply as a diagnostic tool ... Biological computers could tell their host cells to stop producing insulin, to pump out more adrenaline, to reproduce some healthy cells to combat disease, or to stop reproducing if cancer is detected. Biological computers will probably obviate the use of many pharmaceutical drugs.|$|R
40|$|In the {{software}} industry, designers are forever trying to " their products by adding ever more features to them, producing bloated software {{systems that are}} capable of <b>doing</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything.</b> However, these systems often make it increasingly di±cult for their users to perform their tasks as they are forced to wade through a mess of unwanted features to ¯nd the few that they actually need. We believe that a fruitful area of research is in building intelligent systems for particular tasks and then having the systems actively try to assist their users in performing these tasks. Such a system knows the plans (and the problems associated with those plans) that their users are likely to pursue. These competent assistants can use their expertise on their particular tasks to guide their users through their tasks, provide better help, or perhaps even volunteer to take over some part of the task. Such an assis-tive agent is able to helpful because, through its task knowledge, it is able to limit what it needs to consider in cooperating with its user. In this paper we look at the implementation of a competent assistant that func-tions in a physical domain. The Intelligent Classroom is a prototype automated lecture facility that serves as its own audio/visual assistant. We focus on the representations and algorithms to use task knowledge to produce cooperative behavior, arguing these tech-niques could easily to be extended for use {{in a wide range of}} domains (i. e. both physical and purely elec-tronic domains). ...|$|R
