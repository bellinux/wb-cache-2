However, little is known about how membrane signaling events in ductular reactive cells (DRCs) are transduced into nuclear transcriptional changes to drive cholangiocyte maturation and matrix deposition. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate potential mechanistic links between cell signaling events and epigenetic regulators in DRCs. Using directed differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), isolated DRCs, and in vivo models, we examine the mechanisms whereby sonic hedgehog (Shh) overcomes an epigenetic barrier in biliary precursors and promotes both cholangiocyte maturation and deposition of fibronectin (FN). We demonstrate, for the first time, that Gli 1 influences the differentiation state and <b>fibrogenic</b> <b>capacity</b> of iPSC-derived hepatic progenitors and isolated DRCs. We outline a novel pathway wherein Shh-mediated Gli 1 binding in key cholangiocyte gene promoters overcomes an epigenetic barrier conferred by the polycomb protein, enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH 2) and initiates the transcriptional program of cholangiocyte maturation. We also define previously unknown functional Gli 1 binding sites in the promoters of cytokeratin (CK) 7, CK 19, and FN. Our in vivo results show that EZH 2 KO mice fed the choline-deficient, ethanolamine supplemented (CDE) diet have an exaggerated cholangiocyte expansion associated with more robust ductular reaction and increased peri-portal fibrosis. We conclude that Shh/Gli 1 signaling plays an integral role in cholangiocyte maturation in vitro by overcoming an EZH 2 -dependent epigenetic barrier and this mechanism also promotes biliary expansion in vivo...|$|E
40|$|The hepatic stellate (Ito) cell {{lies within}} {{the space of}} Disse and {{has a variety of}} functions. Stellate cells store vitamin A in {{characteristic}} lipid droplets. In the normal human liver, the cells can be identified by the presence of these lipid droplets; in addition, many stellate cells in the normal liver express alpha-smooth muscle actin. In acute liver injury, there is an expansion of the stellate cell population with increased alpha-smooth muscle actin expression; stellate cells appear {{to play a role in}} extracellular matrix remodelling after recovery from injury. In chronic liver injury, the stellate cell differentiates into a myofibroblast-like cell with marked expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin and occasional expression of desmin. Myofibroblast-like cells have a high <b>fibrogenic</b> <b>capacity</b> in the chronically diseased liver and are also involved in matrix degradation. In vitamin A intoxication, hypertrophy and proliferation of the stellate and myofibroblast-like cells may lead to non-cirrhotic portal hypertension, fibrosis and cirrhosis. In liver tumours, myofibroblast-like cells are involved in the capsule formation around the tumour and in the production of extracellular matrix within it. The transition of stellate cells into myofibroblast-like cells is regulated by an intricate network of intercellular communication between stellate cells and activated Kupffer cells, damaged hepatocytes, platelets, endothelial and inflammatory cells, involving cytokines and nonpeptide mediators such as reactive oxygen species, eicosanoids and acetaldehyde. The findings suggest that the stellate cell plays an active role in a number of human liver diseases, with a particular reactivity pattern in fibrotic liver disorders...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction Stimulating the {{commitment}} of implanted dystrophin+ muscle-derived stem cells (MDSCs) into myogenic, as opposed to lipofibrogenic lineages, is a promising therapeutic strategy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Methods To examine whether counteracting myostatin, a negative regulator of muscle mass and a pro-lipofibrotic factor, would help this process, we compared the in vitro myogenic and <b>fibrogenic</b> <b>capacity</b> of MDSCs from wild-type (WT) and myostatin knockout (Mst KO) mice under various modulators, the expression of key stem cell and myogenic genes, and the capacity of these MDSCs to repair the injured gastrocnemius in aged dystrophic mdx mice with exacerbated lipofibrosis. Results Surprisingly, the potent in vitro myotube formation by WT MDSCs was refractory to modulators of myostatin expression or activity, and the Mst KO MDSCs failed to form myotubes under various conditions, despite both MDSC expressing Oct 4 and various stem cell genes and differentiating into nonmyogenic lineages. The genetic inactivation of myostatin in MDSCs was associated with silencing of critical genes for early myogenesis (Actc 1, Acta 1, and MyoD). WT MDSCs implanted into the injured gastrocnemius of aged mdx mice significantly improved myofiber repair and reduced fat deposition and, to a lesser extent, fibrosis. In contrast to their in vitro behavior, Mst KO MDSCs in vivo also significantly improved myofiber repair, but had few effects on lipofibrotic degeneration. Conclusions Although WT MDSCs are very myogenic in culture and stimulate muscle repair after injury in the aged mdx mouse, myostatin genetic inactivation blocks myotube formation in vitro, but the myogenic capacity is recovered in vivo {{under the influence of}} the myostatin+ host-tissue environment, presumably by reactivation of key genes originally silenced in the Mst KO MDSCs...|$|E
40|$|During peritoneal {{dialysis}} (PD), mesothelial cells undergo mesothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (MMT), a process associated with peritoneal-membrane dysfunction. Because TGF- 1 can induce MMT, we evaluated {{the efficacy of}} TGF- 1 -blocking peptides in modulating MMT and ameliorating peritoneal damage in a mouse model of PD. Exposure of the peritoneum to PD fluid induced fibrosis, angiogenesis, functional impairment, and the accumulation of fibroblasts. In addition to expressing fibroblast-specific protein- 1 (FSP- 1), some fibroblasts co-expressed cytokeratin, indicating their mesothelial origin. These intermediatephenotype (Cyto /FSP- 1) fibroblasts had features of myofibroblasts with <b>fibrogenic</b> <b>capacity.</b> PD fluid treatment triggered the appearance of CD 31 /FSP- 1 and CD 45 /FSP- 1 cells, suggesting that fibroblasts also originate from endothelial cells and from cells recruited from bone marrow. Administration of blocking peptides significantly ameliorated fibrosis and angiogenesis, improved peritoneal function, and {{reduced the number of}} FSP- 1 cells, especially in the Cyto /FSP- 1 subpopulation. Conversely, overexpression of TGF- 1 in the peritoneum by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer led to a marked accumulation of fibroblasts, most of which derived from the mesothelium. Taken together, these results demonstrate that TGF- 1 drives the peritoneal deterioration induced by dialysis fluid and highlights a role of TGF- 1 -mediated MMT in the pathophysiology of peritoneal-membrane dysfunctionThis work was supported by grants SAF 2010 - 21249 and SAF 2007 - 61201 from the Ministerio de Ciencia e InnovacioÂ´n to M.
