2500|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, some Deadheads began to sell tie-dye T-shirts, veggie burritos, or other items at Grateful Dead concerts. [...] This allowed many Deadheads {{a way to}} follow the band on its tours. During the early 1980s, the number of Deadheads taping shows increased, and the band created a special section for fans who wished to record the show. These tapes are still shared and {{circulated}} today via websites such as the Live Music Archive and bt.etree.org. In the earlier days of the Grateful Dead, there were questions {{as to whether or}} not it was in the best interest of the band for fans to tape concerts. [...] In 1982, Garcia himself was asked what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and he replied, [...] "When we are done with it , they can have it." [...] The practice of taping has evolved with the digital age, and the rise of the Internet has made it extremely easy to share concerts through unofficial channels.|$|E
2500|$|On June 3, 2011, Against Me! {{announced}} that they started their own record label, Total Treble Music. [...] In November 2011, the band started working on [...] "new material" [...] for the next album. It {{turned out to be}} a false start, they scrapped it and went on tour. They started recording the album again in February 2012 at Total Treble Studio, with Grace taking complete creative control, acting as both recording engineer and record producer for the album. In May 2012, Grace publicly came out as transgender. Bowman recalled that [...] "he wasn't really surprised" [...] when Grace came out, because when <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "the signs had always been there, especially if you listen to the lyrics". In June 2012, Bowman threw the first pitch at a Ray's baseball game. Weinberg left the band in December 2012. [...] He was eventually replaced by Atom Willard. Seward left the band in 2013, he was replaced by Inge Johansson.|$|E
2500|$|The Tom Leykis Show had {{its last}} regular {{terrestrial}} broadcast on Friday, February 20, 2009, and ended at 5 p.m., {{the middle of}} its usual time slot. Leykis took calls until the last five minutes. At that point, the host mentioned that people had {{asked him how he}} was going to end the show. Saying [...] "Let's tell the truth", Leykis commented that he knew since the previous summer that it was possible the flagship station (KLSX, which originated the broadcast of the show) would switch format. Saying he [...] "tossed and turned", <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and asked himself: [...] "What could I say that would wrap this all up? And then I one day heard this song … and I realized – the lyrics of this song … are about me." [...] With that, Leykis rolled into Joe Jackson's [...] "I'm the Man" [...] (the title track of Jackson's 1979 album). By the time the song was over, the studio was filled with people—as could be seen by the live online video broadcast on the station website. The host thanked his producers, the program director, the crowd in the studio, and everyone in southern California who made it [...] "12 great years", and he finished with [...] "Let's do this thing one more time..." [...] The crowd yelled [...] "Blow me up, Tom" [...] one last time to end the show and mark the end of KLSX as [...] "The FM Talk Station" [...] in what coincidentally became a strikingly appropriate catch phrase to be had: The phrase [...] "blow up the station" [...] is a radio term for ending a particular format or station run. After a much longer than usual explosion sound effect, the crowd cheered and KLSX changed format from hot talk to CHR/Top 40.|$|E
50|$|In a 2012 interview, he {{mentioned}} that he read Dr. Seuss books {{as a child and}} this influenced his work with films such as The Lorax. When asked if he would shift towards live-action movies, he said that <b>he</b> has <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and it may happen in the future but he feels comfortable with animation for now.|$|R
50|$|After being {{released}} by the Argonauts, he was approached by Rogers Sportsnet {{to work as a}} football analyst for their broadcasts. Steinauer says that, as a player, football reporters told him he'd make a good broadcaster but <b>he</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> until the opportunity presented itself. In 2009, he did analysis for Sportsnet's television broadcasts and the radio Fan 590.|$|R
5000|$|Anderson stated that, [...] "As a kid, I loved formula fiction," [...] and, {{during a}} {{conversation}} with his editor, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> how <b>it</b> would be {{to write a book}} in that style. [...] "I guess part of the whole thing with the post-modern age is not only did I write a book like that, but I wrote a book about books," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hurrah!" [...] said Moody Spurgeon. Moody Spurgeon {{had never}} been so carried away by his {{feelings}} before, and he blushed uncomfortably every time <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> for a week.|$|E
60|$|Much startled, {{the king}} looked about him. He could see nothing, and somehow, when <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> the voice {{seemed as if}} it were part of himself. Suddenly his eyes fell on the ring, and he understood.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> for {{a little}} while with a highly {{agreeable}} and whimsical expression of face, then quite gave it up and said in his most engaging manner, [...] "You know what a child I am. Why surprised?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Bill {{would move}} up to become [...] "Special Events Director" [...] for WMBI, he would also branch out and start doing interviews. One morning, he was chatting with a morning {{announcer}}, and the announcer happened to {{ask him if he}} sang, to which Bill replied <b>he</b> hadn't <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> [...] "Well, why don't you do a solo for us sometime one morning?" [...] the announcer asked.|$|R
60|$|But Dickory's {{gratitude}} and joy {{had nothing to}} found itself upon. The sea might far better have been his enemy than his friend, for if <b>he</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> the sandy beach {{would have been the}} road by which a portion of the pirate's men would have marched to cut off his flight, or they would have accomplished the same end in boats.|$|R
25|$|On 7 September, Bader claimed two Bf 109s shot down, {{followed}} by a Junkers Ju 88. On 9 September, Bader claimed another Dornier. During the same mission, he attacked a He 111 only to discover {{he was out of}} ammunition. Enraged, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> ramming <b>it</b> and slicing off the rudder with his propeller, but turned away when he regained his composure. On 14 September, Bader was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his combat leadership.|$|R
60|$|Putting {{down his}} pipe, {{he got into}} bed. He was tired {{and in the morning}} the gravel cars must be pulled out of the muskeg. The job was awkward, and while <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> he went to sleep.|$|E
60|$|When Peter awoke, {{the first}} thing he thought of was the terrible {{creature}} he had seen in the Green Forest. The more <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> the more impossible it seemed, and he didn't wonder that Mrs. Peter had advised him not to repeat it.|$|E
6000|$|But foolish Johnny Chuck {{really thought}} that old Whitetail was afraid of him. The more <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> the more tickled he felt and the more puffed up he felt. He began to talk to himself and to brag. Yes, Sir, Johnny Chuck began to brag: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{video for}} the song was filmed in July and was also {{directed}} by Joe Hahn. According to bassist Phoenix, the video contains references to the Bhagavad Gita and J. Robert Oppenheimer {{as well as the}} Christian apocalypse, which are three themes that are also used in the album. When coming up with the idea for the video, Hahn said <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> what <b>it</b> would be like if mankind had to accept their fate in a time of despair.|$|R
6000|$|... "But, nevertheless, {{she ought}} to {{know better than to}} speak disparagingly of me to my servants. She should have more respect for herself." [...] And the squire showed by the tone of his voice that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> very much <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
50|$|That {{was just}} sort of the way Penny was. He was nonchalant. He sort of didn’t realise—I don’t think he’s ever {{realised}} the impact he’s had on skateboarding. <b>He</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Everything was just natural. Were his lines thought out before? Probably to an extent based on what he’d been doing in practice. But none of it was premeditated like, “Right, I’m gonna do this here, then hit the hip, then hit the pyramid.” It was just flow.|$|R
60|$|The longer <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> {{the more}} repugnant became {{the thought of}} taking human life needlessly; and thus it {{happened}} {{that while he was}} trying to decide just what to do, they had come to a little clearing, at the far side of which lay a palisaded village of beehive huts.|$|E
60|$|Every {{little while}} Unc' Billy Possum {{would sit down}} to rest, for he wasn't used to so much real work. But finally he got his house clean and made as {{comfortable}} as possible, and about that time be began to think how good an egg would taste. The more <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> the more he wanted that egg.|$|E
60|$|Gos {{gave the}} plan {{considerable}} {{thought in the}} next five minutes, and the more <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> the more clever and reasonable it seemed. So he agreed to do as Queen Cor suggested and at once hurried away to the mines, where he arrived before Prince Inga did. The next morning he carried King Kitticut back to Regos.|$|E
6000|$|Now when Sammy {{had asked}} the {{question}} <b>he</b> had <b>thought</b> nothing <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> It had just popped into his head by way of something to say. But Sammy Jay is sharp, and he noticed right away that Peter didn't answer but {{began to talk about}} other things, ...|$|R
60|$|He {{had been}} {{thinking}} of this possibility {{for the last few}} weeks almost continuously, and yet now that it had come to him he felt that <b>he</b> had never <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> before, that <b>he</b> must go off alone by himself to envisage this monstrous and terrible fact, without distraction or interruption.|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} make out whether Mr. Makely {{approved}} of his wife's philosophy or not; I do not believe <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> much <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> The money probably came easily with him, and he let it go easily, as an American likes to do. There is nothing penurious or sordid about this curious people, so fierce in the pursuit of riches. When these are once gained, they seem to have no value to the man who has won them, and he has generally no object in life but to see his womankind spend them.|$|R
6000|$|He had {{received}} the rank of colonel on the general staff of the school. He was plumply pleased by salutes on the street from unknown small boys; his ears were tickled to ruddy ecstasy by hearing himself called [...] "Colonel;" [...] {{and if he did}} not attend Sunday School merely to be thus exalted, certainly <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> all the way there.|$|E
60|$|The moonbeam {{had moved}} some {{distance}} {{when he opened}} his eyes and straightened his body with a jerk. The room was nearly dark, and when <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> afterwards, he imagined he was only half awake, for his heart beat and he was conscious of an enervating fear. A dark object, indistinct but like a man, stood beside the coffin.|$|E
60|$|Duveen {{said nothing}} {{for a moment or}} two, but he looked thoughtful, and Lister {{imagined}} Miss Duveen studied him quietly. He did not belong to the Duveens' circle; he was ruder. In fact, it was rather strange to see these people sitting with him, engaged in friendly talk, although, now <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> Miss Duveen had not said much.|$|E
5000|$|The XGF's The Ex-Girlfriends, a {{collective}} term {{for all the}} women who Norm has dated {{in the past and}} broken up with. Usually the breakups are due to his own foibles. These ladies frequently come back to haunt him, sometimes even as a group. They include Marta, Greta, Rita (the [...] "Über-ex-GF") and also Maria Elena who Norm never dated but was once interested in. Reine was also technically a member long before she and Norm began dating, since <b>he</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> but never asked her since {{he did not want to}} lose her as a friend.|$|R
40|$|Bohr {{explains}} {{that he has not}} yet answered Pauli's letters and cards {{because of a lack of}} interest in Pauli's questions concerning his calculations of scattering of high frequent radiation from bound electrons. During the last week <b>he</b> has <b>thought</b> much <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and discussed it with Bloch. He also has some remarks <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and he would like to know Pauli's opinion...|$|R
5000|$|Wordsworth wrote [...] "My Heart Leaps Up" [...] on {{the night}} of March 26, 1802. Earlier that day, he had written [...] "To The Cuckoo". He was in Dove Cottage, Grasmere with his sister, Dorothy. After he wrote <b>it</b> <b>he</b> often <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> {{altering}} <b>it,</b> but decided to leave it as it was originally written. It was published as part of Poems, in Two Volumes in 1807.|$|R
6000|$|Twice Bill Isbel {{came through}} the kitchen to whisper to Jean. The strain in the large room, from which the rustlers could not be seen, must have been great. Jean told him all he had seen and what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> [...] "Eatin' an' drinkin'!" [...] ejaculated Bill. [...] "Well, I'll be--! That 'll jar the old man. He wants to get the fight over.|$|E
60|$|Blondell was silenced, but not convinced. A penniless {{son-in-law}} {{was not to}} his liking. Fan was {{his only}} child, and the big ranch over which he presided was worth sixty thousand dollars. What right had this lazy Englishman {{to come in and}} marry its heiress? The more <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> the angrier he grew, and when he came in the following night he broke forth.|$|E
60|$|Now the {{trackless}} wilderness was in front, and he {{must get}} across before his food was gone. He did get across, but he imagined the Indian's inherited talents accounted for his doing so. Jimmy himself did not {{know much about the}} journey. When <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> afterwards, he dully pictured the fatigue and strain, the sharpening pinch of hunger and the stern effort to push on.|$|E
5000|$|.....Gilder is a {{nice man}} - and in person he was curiously undogmatic about immigration. <b>He</b> just hadn't <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> much. All <b>he</b> wanted, he told an {{investment}} conference I was moderating in mid-2000, was an assured supply of cheap computer programmers - other than that, he didn't care. And <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> all immigrants {{ought to be able}} to speak English. At this last remark, the entire audience of fat cats, obviously uneasy about our argument, burst into loud applause.|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{after joining}} GCHQ in September 1973, after {{studying}} Mathematics at Cambridge University, Clifford Cocks was told of Ellis' proof {{and that no}} one had been able {{to figure out a way}} to implement <b>it.</b> <b>He</b> went home, <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and returned with the basic idea for what has become known as the RSA asymmetric key encryption algorithm. Because any new and potentially beneficial/harmful technique developed by GCHQ is by definition classified information, the discovery was kept secret.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the trial}} of Manfred Ewald, leader of the East German sports program and {{president}} of his East Germany's Olympic committee and Manfred Hoeppner, East German medical director in Berlin in 2000, Krieger testified that the drugs {{he had been given}} had contributed to his trans-sexuality; <b>he</b> already had <b>thoughts</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> but in his words the effects of the doping deprived him of the right to [...] "find out for myself which sex I wanted to be." ...|$|R
