5|$|The {{stone that}} was quarried is arkose of the Famennian stage. Approximately 360 million years ago, {{the thrust of}} forming Gondwana plates raised the seabed. Meanwhile, an ice age {{occurred}} in regions near the poles. Marine regression allowed sedimentation of <b>detrital</b> sand and clays which left large shoals of hard sandstone with ripple marks, alternating with levels more or less shaley according to their clay's content.|$|E
5|$|Probably {{the most}} {{important}} ecological characteristic of abyssal ecosystems is energy limitation. Abyssal seafloor communities {{are considered to be}} food limited because benthic production depends on the input of <b>detrital</b> organic material produced in the euphotic zone, thousands of meters above. Most of the organic flux arrives as an attenuated rain of small particles (typically, only 0.5–2% of net primary production in the euphotic zone), which decreases inversely with water depth. The small particle flux can be augmented by the fall of larger carcasses and downslope transport of organic material near continental margins.|$|E
5|$|The stones used to {{backfill}} the quarry are those which underlie the Givetian limestone extracted in the Bellignies quarry. There is , a coarse shelly limestone, deep gray, yellowish when it outcrops, <b>detrital</b> ferruginous dated to the Lower Cenomanian epoch, {{a hundred million}} years ago. There is clay and very glauconitic marl of the Upper Cenomanian stage, enriched by a pebble conglomerate paléozoïc stones. These rocks contain Praeactinocamax plenus, Chlamys asper, Ostrea diluviana and radiated fossils: Janira quadricostata, Cyprina ligeriensis, Arca mailleana. There is also bluish marl of the Turonian.|$|E
25|$|The {{redirection}} {{of carbon}} by C. amurensis to the benthos {{has created a}} limited chain, leaving the pelagic web depauperate. <b>Detrital</b> production from clam excretion and death may fuel bacterial production, which may be circulated into the <b>detrital</b> food web, or microbial loop.|$|E
25|$|Likewise, {{the large}} {{variation}} of deposition {{has led to}} four different types of carbonate cores in the structure: biothermal, biomorphic <b>detrital,</b> organo-clastic, and biochemogenic. Of these biomorphic <b>detrital</b> {{are the most common}} followed by biothermal rock types. However, estimates of their volumes range from 30-90% for the former and 10-60% for the latter.|$|E
25|$|Detritivores {{capitalize}} {{upon this}} energy source, creating an alternate and parallel food web of potentially large importance. This is because carbon fixation into the <b>detrital</b> food web {{is not limited}} by stratification, turbidity or day length, all of which limit photosynthesis. <b>Detrital</b> production occurs continuously, limited only by inputs and advection out of the Delta system.|$|E
25|$|<b>Detrital</b> zircons in the Jumperding Gneiss Complex {{range in}} age from 3267 ± 30Ma to 3341 ± 100Ma, with {{metamorphic}} overgrowth dated at 3180Ma.|$|E
25|$|In dry climate, {{the rocks}} exposed are mostly {{subjected}} to mechanical disintegration which produces coarse <b>detrital</b> materials: this {{is referred to}} as rhexistasy.|$|E
25|$|This model {{predicts that}} all three units–namely, the Lesser Himalayan, Greater Himalayan, and Tethyan Himalayan–must have a nearly {{identical}} depositional age and depositional setting, and are derived from similar sources. Immediately, primary evidence from <b>detrital</b> zircon ages, paleocurrent recorded in the units, and animal similarities supports these predictions. Firstly, the <b>detrital</b> zircon data for the Lesser Himalaya and Tethyan Himalaya sequence yield similar age spectra when similar aged samples were used. Furthermore, when samarium–neodymium dating of the entire North Indian sequence was made, significant overlap of Nd isotopic signatures between the different rocks units indicates a sharing of similar sources.|$|E
25|$|Glaciation {{caused the}} {{depression}} and tipping phenomena which created the gulfs at {{the north and east}} of the archipelago. Erosion caused by the glacial and fluvial activity carved out the valleys and fjords; erosion also created conglomerate <b>detrital</b> complexes, and the plain of the Courbet Peninsula.|$|E
25|$|Pine pollen {{may play}} an {{important}} role in the functioning of <b>detrital</b> food webs. Nutrients from pollen aid detritivores in development, growth and maturation, and may enable fungi to decompose nutritionally scarce litter. Pine pollen is also involved in moving plant matter between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.|$|E
25|$|The Yilgarn Craton {{is a large}} craton that {{constitutes}} {{the bulk of the}} Western Australian land mass. It is bounded by a mixture of sedimentary basins and Proterozoic fold and thrust belts. Zircon grains in the Jack Hills, Narryer Terrane have been dated at ~4.27 Ga, with one <b>detrital</b> zircon dated as old as 4.4 Ga.|$|E
25|$|Vannay et al. {{explains}} that the missing strata in Lesser Himalaya could {{be a result of}} glaciation in late Carboniferous. Similar to the passive margin model, this model also implies that all the zones within the North Indian sequence share the same source; however, the εNd value and <b>detrital</b> zircon ages are currently controversial and may not favor this interpretation.|$|E
25|$|The {{remnants}} of the Archean crust in the region can be found within various granitic complexes in the Eastern Pilbara. Xenoliths of 3.58 Ga gabbroic anorthosite were found within the Shaw Granitic Complex. The Warrawagine Granitic Complex contains 3.66–3.58 Ga biotite tonalite gneiss. Presence of 3.8–3.6 Ga <b>detrital</b> zircons also suggests crustal erosion 300 Ma prior to the oldest rocks found.|$|E
25|$|Notably, {{the high}} {{clearance}} {{rate of the}} introduced Amur River clam Potamocorbula amurensis population has produced a ten-fold decline in plankton density, resulting in a carbon trap in the benthos and an assumed increase in waste <b>detrital</b> production. This waste is hypothesized to fuel the microbial loop, resulting {{in an increase in}} microzooplankton such as the copepod Limnoithona tetraspina, which utilize rotifers and ciliates.|$|E
25|$|Zircon is {{ubiquitous}} in the crust of Earth. It occurs {{as a common}} accessory mineral in igneous rocks (as primary crystallization products), in metamorphic rocks and as <b>detrital</b> grains in sedimentary rocks. Large zircon crystals are rare. Their average size in granite rocks is about 0.1–0.3mm, {{but they can also}} grow to sizes of several centimeters, especially in mafic pegmatites and carbonatites. Zircon is also very resistant to heat and corrosion.|$|E
25|$|The {{fossil record}} of centipedes extends back to , during the Late Silurian. They {{belong to the}} subphylum Myriapoda which {{includes}} Diplopoda, Symphyla, and Pauropoda. The oldest known fossil land animal, Pneumodesmus newmani, is a myriapod. Being among the earliest terrestrial animals, centipedes {{were one of the}} first to fill a fundamental niche as ground level generalist predators in <b>detrital</b> food webs. Today, centipedes are abundant and exist in many harsh habitats.|$|E
25|$|Benthic, or bottom-dwelling, fishes include white {{sturgeon}} (Acipenser transmontanus), white catfish (Ameiurus catus), and starry flounder (Platichthys stellatus). Because of their habitat orientation, they feed primarily on epibenthic organisms such as amphipods, bay shrimp, and bivalves. These fish {{are known to}} feed at least occasionally on the Amur River clam, which would represent {{one of the few}} channels for energy flow from that species, except for <b>detrital</b> production.|$|E
25|$|In many cases, {{sedimentation}} occurs slowly. In a desert, for example, {{the wind}} deposits siliciclastic material (sand or silt) in some spots, or catastrophic flooding of a wadi may cause sudden deposits of {{large quantities of}} <b>detrital</b> material, but in most places eolian erosion dominates. The amount of sedimentary rock that forms is not only dependent {{on the amount of}} supplied material, but also on how well the material consolidates. Erosion removes most deposited sediment shortly after deposition.|$|E
25|$|From crater {{counts on}} other {{celestial}} bodies, it is inferred that {{a period of}} intense meteorite impacts, called the Late Heavy Bombardment, began about 4.1Ga, and concluded around 3.8Ga, {{at the end of}} the Hadean. In addition, volcanism was severe due to the large heat flow and geothermal gradient. Nevertheless, <b>detrital</b> zircon crystals dated to 4.4Ga show evidence of having undergone contact with liquid water, suggesting that the Earth already had oceans or seas at that time.|$|E
25|$|Arapiles {{today is}} {{preserved}} {{due to a}} granitic intrusion that was emplaced below the sandstone and conglomerate approx 400 Ma, or 20 million years post sedimentation. This intrusion advected heat from lower in the crust, facilitating pervasive quartz cementation of the <b>detrital</b> grains. The granite also contained some highly siliceous fluids that were driven off as it cooled. These fluids likely {{also contributed to the}} cementation of the sediments. This process of direct heating due to magma transport is known as contact metamorphism.|$|E
25|$|Within these categories, food webs can {{be further}} {{organized}} according to {{the different kinds of}} ecosystems being investigated. For example, human food webs, agricultural food webs, <b>detrital</b> food webs, marine food webs, aquatic food webs, soil food webs, Arctic (or polar) food webs, terrestrial food webs, and microbial food webs. These characterizations stem from the ecosystem concept, which assumes that the phenomena under investigation (interactions and feedback loops) are sufﬁcient to explain patterns within boundaries, such as the edge of a forest, an island, a shoreline, or some other pronounced physical characteristic.|$|E
25|$|Primary {{consumers}} {{rely upon}} primary production {{as a main}} food source. The most important consumers of the pelagic web of the LSZ are copepods, along with the rotifers, flagellates and ciliates mentioned above. All species of calanoid copepods have declined under high predation pressure from the recently introduced Amur River clam (Corbula amurensis). Because of this, and because copepods rely upon both photosynthetic and <b>detrital</b> food sources, copepods in the LSZ have limited feedback on primary production, unlike marine and lentic systems where copepods can graze down blooms {{in a matter of}} days.|$|E
25|$|This model {{fails to}} {{reconcile}} with <b>detrital</b> zircon ages, and paleontological evidence {{with respect to}} the similarities between Tethyan and Lesser Himalaya. Similar to the crystalline axis model, this model faces the same challenges {{with respect to the}} evidence that supports the passive margin model. Trilobite fauna, paleocurrent and lithological similarities would be unlikely if the rock units were formed in separate terranes as explained by Myrow et al. Earlier predictions that suggest a thrust/ shortening event in Tethyan Himalaya in the early Paleozoic, and the simultaneous formation of granitic intrusions under the sequence, were also undermined by the apparent rifting isotopic signatures in the granites.|$|E
25|$|The {{maximum age}} of the Unkar Group is also {{established}} by uranium-lead (U-Pb) dating of zircons from an ash bed from the Bass Formation in the basal Unkar Group of 1254 Ma near river Mile 78 (List of Colorado River rapids and features). The dating of <b>detrital</b> zircons from the Bass Formation have yielded dates of about 1200 Ma. These dates suggest that the 1254 Ma age {{may be a bit}} too old. However, these zircons likely underwent some lead loss, and, as a result these apparent dates are younger than their actual ages. As a result, the 1254 Ma dates remain the best estimate for the age of initial deposition of the Unkar Group.|$|E
25|$|Results of the zircon {{ages and}} {{possible}} protolith lithologies and their corresponding first-order {{similarities between the}} rock units from Myrow et al. have generally discredited this model. To begin with, the Greater Himalaya yields younger <b>detrital</b> zircon ages than that of Lesser and Tethyan Himalaya, which makes it very unlikely for Greater Himalaya to be a topographic high that separates two depositional basins. All the evidence that supports the passive margin model is also problematic for this model, since the strong paleontological, lithological, and sedimentological relationships between Lesser and Tethyan Himalaya basically rejects the connotation that they were once separated. Missing suture zone rocks in the Main Central Thrust also {{makes it difficult to}} explain this model.|$|E
25|$|The Ordovician turbidites, {{consisting}} of greywacke, feldspathic sandstone, micaceous siltstone, micaceous shale, chert, and phyllite, {{are very similar}} {{in all parts of}} the Tasman Orogen, including New Zealand and the Transantarctic Mountains. <b>Detrital</b> zircons from the turbidites have been isotopically dated with age ranges of 0.46 and 0.60 Gya, 1.0 and 1.2 Gya, and at ~1.8 Gya, ~2.2 Gya and ~2.7 Gya. These do not match the age of zircons from the interior of the Australian Shield, so the source of the sediments is from another continent. The other evidence from the Ordovician sediments are chemical composition indicates granitic source, with the absence of feldspar. Secondly the fine grained nature shows the sediments have been transported a long way from their ultimate, source, and could have been second cycle, derived from sedimentary rocks.|$|E
25|$|The {{basement}} {{is thought}} to be Older North American basement, especially in the North, and a number of different accreted terranes, which are mostly covered by Cenozoic volcanism. The northern extent of the Sierra Madre is the Cortés Terrane, although the northern extreme of this contains {{a small portion of the}} Carborca Terrane. Some of the northern end may also be underlain by a Precambrian basement placed around the same time as the Grenville Orogeny. Some of this area has a series of Paleozoic sedimentary sequences from a deep marine environment underlying it, which considered by some to be part of the Cotes Terrane and by others to be transported. In some areas distinct sedimentary rocks can be identified by shallow-water Silurian and Mississippian sedimentary rocks underlying deep-water Pennsylvanian and Permian, which are divided by Mississippian rhyolite. The Permian clastics contain some <b>detrital</b> rock that sit alongside low-grade metamorphosed sedimentary and volcanic rocks with serpentinite.|$|E
25|$|This {{reconstruction}} {{predicts that}} the Greater Himalaya thrust over Lesser Himalayan rocks during early Paleozoic. As such. {{it is able to}} more successfully explain the age relationship between the strata across the main central thrust. Other models would require greater slip along the main central thrust during the Cenozoic orogeny to achieve the present stratigraphical arrangement. Deformation produced by Paleozoic tectonics may have been overprinted by the Cenozoic reactivation of the main central thrust, which result in the lack of old suture zone rocks. Moreover, aligned with this model, sediments in northern India have experienced a transition from turbidites to syn-collision sediments in Cambrian to Ordovician. Additional evidence with regard to isotopic signatures and <b>detrital</b> zircon ages may also increase the credibility of this model. Further investigation is required to support more predictions of this model, since metamorphism of the Greater Himalayan strata in early Paleozoic, and Cambrian to Ordovician syn-tectonic sediments in Tethyan Himalaya, are lacking.|$|E
25|$|Indirect dating of mica grains {{from the}} Dox Formation {{indicate}} that it was deposited over {{a relatively short time}} span, between 1140 and 1104 Ma. Individual mica grains from the Escalante Creek Member of the Dox, were collected and dated by 40Ar/39Ar mass spectrometry. This dating of mica grains yielded a distribution of ages ranging from ca. 1260-1120 Ma, with a well-defined peak at 1140 Ma. Although it was suspected that these dates recorded the age at which the mineral cooled through a critical temperature window of ~300°C, the dating of additional samples from other members, and petrographic and microprobe examination of the mica, indicated the ages of source rocks from which the micas were eroded, and support the interpretation that the Dox Formation is younger than 1140 Ma. Additional dating of <b>detrital</b> zircons from the Dox Formation, corroborated the dating of mica grains, and showed that much of the Unkar Group (excluding the Bass Formation) was deposited between 1170 and 1100 Ma, and that the Dox formation was deposited after 1140 Ma. The age of the overlying Cardenas Basalt demonstrates that the Dox Formation accumulated before 1104 Ma.|$|E
25|$|Many of the Earth's {{elements}} and minerals (or mineral nutrients) are {{contained within the}} tissues and diets of organisms. Hence, mineral and nutrient cycles trace food web energy pathways. Ecologists employ stoichiometry to analyze the ratios {{of the main elements}} found in all organisms: carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P). There is a large transitional difference between many terrestrial and aquatic systems as C:P and C:N ratios are much higher in terrestrial systems while N:P ratios are equal between the two systems. Mineral nutrients are the material resources that organisms need for growth, development, and vitality. Food webs depict the pathways of mineral nutrient cycling as they flow through organisms. Most of the primary production in an ecosystem is not consumed, but is recycled by detritus back into useful nutrients. Many of the Earth's microorganisms are involved in the formation of minerals in a process called biomineralization. Bacteria that live in <b>detrital</b> sediments create and cycle nutrients and biominerals. Food web models and nutrient cycles have traditionally been treated separately, but there is a strong functional connection between the two in terms of stability, flux, sources, sinks, and recycling of mineral nutrients.|$|E
500|$|The past {{magnetic}} field is recorded mostly by strongly magnetic minerals, particularly iron oxides such as magnetite, that {{can carry a}} permanent magnetic moment. This remanent magnetization, or remanence, can be acquired {{in more than one}} way. In lava flows, the direction of the field is [...] "frozen" [...] in small minerals as they cool, giving rise to a thermoremanent magnetization. In sediments, the orientation of magnetic particles acquires a slight bias towards the {{magnetic field}} as they are deposited on an ocean floor or lake bottom. This is called <b>detrital</b> remanent magnetization.|$|E
500|$|Oil shale geology is {{a branch}} of {{geologic}} sciences which studies the formation and composition of oil shalesfine-grained sedimentary rocks containing significant amounts of kerogen, and belonging {{to the group of}} sapropel fuels. [...] Oil shale formation takes place in a number of depositional settings and has considerable compositional variation. Oil shales can be classified by their composition (carbonate minerals such as calcite or <b>detrital</b> minerals such as quartz and clays) or by their depositional environment (large lakes, shallow marine, and lagoon/small lake settings). Much of the organic matter in oil shale is of algal origin, but may also include remains of vascular land plants. Three major type of organic matter (macerals) in oil shale are telalginite, lamalginite, and bituminite. Some oil-shale deposits also contain metals which include vanadium, zinc, copper, uranium.|$|E
500|$|Across the park, {{different}} ages of exposed rocks are seen. Stoneyfell quartzite, composed mostly of quartzite with sandstone and some siltstone, is the youngest. Woolshed flat shale is older and {{is composed of}} siltstone, dolomite and some sandstone. The oldest regular exposure is Montacute dolomite, which is a blue-grey dolomite with magnesite, siltstone and sandstone. Quarries {{in the south of}} the park have been mined for Stoneyfell Quartzite. This type of quartzite is a clean, white, feldsparthic quartzite with interbedded thin siltstone layers up to [...] thick occurring at gaps of [...] Ripple marks in this rock clearly indicate its shallow water origin. Next to Newman's Nursery is a quarry with grey to blue silicaceous dolomite used for road material. It contains traces of pyrite and is overlain by phyllite. Tea Tree Gully freestone, as found in the largest quarry in the park, is a feldsparthic sandstone bedded with quartzite. Decay of the feldspar has enabled it to be cut and dressed as a quality building stone. The Tea Tree Gully iron (or silver) mine lies in an iron-rich fault zone. The ore body is ironstone, 150m long, 50m wide and 30m thick (490ft by 160ft by 100ft). It is primarily limonite, <b>detrital</b> quartz and silica. It is thought to have been chemically deposited during the Paleogene and Neogene periods, 2mya to 66mya.|$|E
2500|$|In a <b>detrital</b> web, {{plant and}} animal matter is broken down by decomposers, e.g., {{bacteria}} and fungi, and moves to detritivores and then carnivores.
