40|$|As modern {{passenger}} cars become increasingly quieter and comfort, automotive <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> {{noise and vibration}} become more noticeable. As {{a result of the}} market information survey, most complaints about the wiper concern operation noise. Wiper vibration and noise is classified into three main categories namely, squeal noise, chattering, and reversal noise. Squeal noise is a high-frequency vibration of about 1000 Hz. Chattering noise is a lowfrequency vibration of 100 Hz or less and reversal noise is an impact sound with a frequency of 500 Hz or less produced when the wiper reverses. Typically, noise and vibration study of the automotive <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> has been carried out by experimental, analytical and numerical approaches. This report describes evaluation of noise and vibration that generated by an automotive <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> using numerical approach via finite element method. In doing so, two types of test are conducted i. e. modal testing for individual wiper components and noise and vibration test to identify noise category for a selected passenger car <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper.</b> Later, a 3 -dimensional (3 D) finite element (FE) model of the <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> assembly is developed. This FE model is then validated at the component level using modal analysis {{in order to ensure that}} dynamic characteristics of the FE model close to a real <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper.</b> In order to evaluate characteristics of noise and vibration of the <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper,</b> complex eigenvalue analysis that made available in ABAQUS is employed. It is found that the <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> generates noise at frequency around 11 Hz which is identified as chatter and the predicted frequency is fairly close with measured frequency obtained in the experiment. This chatter noise is dominated by bending mode of the wiper blade. Having found the characteristics of the <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> noise, several structural modifications are proposed to the rubber blade and simulated once again. There are three modifications that capable of preventing noise and vibration in the <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper.</b> This finding could help car makers to design quiet and effective <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> and in turn to produce quieter and comfort {{passenger cars}}...|$|R
50|$|The first {{designs for}} the <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> are {{credited}} to Polish concert pianist Józef Hofmann, and Mills Munitions, Birmingham who also {{claimed to have been}} the first to patent <b>windscreen</b> <b>wipers</b> in England.At least three inventors patented windscreen cleaning devices at around the same time in 1903; Mary Anderson, Robert Douglass, and John Apjohn. In April 1911, a patent for <b>windscreen</b> <b>wipers</b> was registered by Sloan & Lloyd Barnes, patent agents of Liverpool, England, for Gladstone Adams of Whitley Bay.|$|R

40|$|Today both car {{drivers and}} car {{passengers}} cannot imagine {{this kind of}} vehicle without a <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper.</b> There {{are only a few}} who know its history and evolution. A <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> is a device used to remove rain and debris from a windscreen or windshield. A wiper generally consists of an arm, pivoting at one end and with a long rubber blade attached to the other. The blade is swung {{back and forth over the}} glass, pushing water from its surface...|$|R
50|$|In April 1908, {{he drove}} down to Crystal Palace Park in a 1904 Darracq-Charron {{motorcar}} to see Newcastle United play against Wolverhampton Wanderers in the FA Cup final. It was such a novelty to see a car in those days that it was put into a car showroom window while he was there, {{because so many people}} wanted to see it. On the way back from the cup final, snow kept getting on the windscreen and Gladstone had to keep {{getting out of the car}} to clear it. This experience led to his invention of the <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper.</b> In April 1911, Gladstone patented the design of a <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> with Sloan & Lloyd Barnes, patent agents of Liverpool. Gladstone's version of the <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> was never manufactured, however. His original prototype can be seen in Newcastle's Discovery Museum.|$|R

50|$|Where {{a supply}} of vacuum is available, but not {{pneumatic}} power, rotary actuators have even been made to work from vacuum power. The only common instance of these was for early automatic <b>windscreen</b> <b>wipers</b> on cars up until around 1960. These used the manifold vacuum of a petrol engine to work a quarter-turn oscillating vane actuator. Such <b>windscreen</b> <b>wipers</b> worked adequately when the engine was running under light load, but they were notorious that when working hard at top speed or climbing a hill, the manifold vacuum was reduced and the wipers slowed to a crawl.|$|R

The infrared diode of high luminance is used as the lamp-source to irradiate the windscreen of automobile. The optical signal is received by the infrared receiver and will be changed into voltage. After shaping and filting, the voltage will be sampled and manipulated by the MCU, and then the MCU will send out different duty cycles, {{which is used to}} control the intermittence of the motor of <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper.</b> Experiment has been done; results show that the system designed in this paper is sensitive and reliable...|$|R
50|$|It shared many {{attributes}} {{with its}} sibling model, however, body panels and interior were done {{to a much}} higher specification.
