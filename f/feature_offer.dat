40|$|The virtual {{exhibition}} and its <b>feature</b> <b>offer</b> {{a journey through}} the history of books for children seen through a very rich iconography. What has been the relationship between children and books since the Middle Ages? How have books grown with children over the years? What issues are facing this sort of literature? Alongside the material that is provided for adults to consider and the numerous works for browsing which have been selected from the books of our grand-mothers, {{a large part of}} the site is devoted to children: interactive alphabet books such as Babar, games for putting pages together using different alphabet books from the collections of the BnF. There’s a snakes and ladders game which is a light-hearted tour through the literature of youth, in partnership with publishers of children’s’ books...|$|E
40|$|The shared {{features}} {{that characterize the}} noun categories that young children learn first are a formative basis of the human category system. To investigate the potential categorical information contained in the features of early-learned nouns, we examine the graph-theoretic properties of noun–feature networks. The networks are built from the overlap of words normatively acquired by children prior to 2 ½ {{years of age and}} perceptual and conceptual (functional) features acquired from adult feature generation norms. The resulting networks have small-world structure, indicative of a high degree of feature overlap in local clusters. However, perceptual features – due to their abundance and redundancy – generate networks more robust to feature omissions, while conceptual features are more discriminating and, per <b>feature,</b> <b>offer</b> more categorical information than perceptual features. Using a network specific cluster identification algorithm (the clique percolation method) we also show that shared features among these early-learned nouns create higher-order groupings common to adult taxonomic designations. Again, perceptual and conceptual features play distinct roles among different categories, typically with perceptual features being more inclusive and conceptual features being more exclusive of category memberships. The results offer new and testable hypotheses about the role of shared features in human category knowledge...|$|E
