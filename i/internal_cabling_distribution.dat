40|$|The {{legal and}} {{regulatory}} framework for business operation of companies for the <b>cable</b> <b>distribution</b> of radio and television programmes has been established {{as part of the}} telecommunication market liberalisation in the Republic of Serbia. This framework has encouraged the economic activity, demonstrating, however, certain weaknesses, primarily in respect of providing the service quality and consumer protection. Efficient operation of <b>cable</b> <b>distribution</b> systems is creating opportunities for regional cooperation in the overall sphere of telecommunications. Therefore, it needs to be addressed with adequate attention. <b>cable</b> <b>distribution</b> system, business operation, media, radio and television programmes...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{character}} of the original source materials and the nature of batch digitization, quality control issues may be present in this document. Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Weaknesses associated with <b>cable</b> <b>distribution</b> systems suggest a lack of design consideration in the planning stage of a building. The primary question to be addressed in this study is do relationships between design considerations and building performance exist for <b>cable</b> <b>distribution</b> in multi-story, speculatively built office buildings? The objective {{of this study is to}} explore the qualitative relationships among design emphasis, design priority, and building performance for <b>cable</b> <b>distribution</b> for multi-story speculatively built office buildings. This study will establish qualitative relationships between owner expectations for <b>cable</b> <b>distribution</b> and design emphasis. If utilized by the Architect in the planning stage of a building, these relationships can be used to estimate design time, improve the interaction among other cabling professionals, and determine the effort required by the Architect to accomplish the owner's expectations for the performance of the <b>cable</b> <b>distribution</b> means in his building...|$|R

50|$|A {{receiver}} {{required to}} operate in a single <b>cable</b> <b>distribution</b> installation can be essentially conventional. It {{should be able to}} tune to the user channel (within the normal IF tuning range) and modulate the LNB power voltage with the 22 kHz signal required for issuing DiSEqC commands.

A second F- 18 FDG PET/CT performed after 3 months of antibiotic treatment showed minimal residual hypermetabolism around the proximal and cervical <b>internal</b> <b>cable.</b> The pedestal was then replaced and a third PET/CT scan 3 months {{after the completion of}} antibiotic treatment was entirely normal.

A brief recall of the mathematical {{formulation of the}} problem is reported in the first section. In the second section, results of some numerical applications are shown. With reference to the external prestressing, the importance of the number of saddle points to increase the safe prestressing level of the beam is shown. Finally, when prestressing in performed by unbonded <b>internal</b> <b>cables,</b> the different behaviour of beams having the same loading capacity, obtained by modifying the cross section geometry according to the different concrete strength, is shown...|$|R

Results of these analyses are valid partially for digital <b>cable</b> <b>distribution</b> too. There is no need to pursue the dynamic range of signal in that case, because digital signals are very resistant to the nonlinear distortions...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cable</b> <b>distribution</b> plays a {{vital role}} in Cable Driven Parallel Manipulators (CDPMs) {{regarding}} tension and workspace quality, especially in fully restrained CDPMs. This paper focuses on three typical configurations of fully restrained CDPMs with 7 cables in order to introduce an approach for configuration synthesis. Firstly, the kinematic models of three types of CDPMs with 7 cables are set up. Then, in order to evaluate workspace quality, two new indices are proposed by using tensions along each cable, which are the All <b>Cable</b> Tension <b>Distribution</b> Index (ACTDI) and Global Tension Distribution Index (GTDI). Next, the three types of CDPMs with 7 cables are analysed with the two indices. At the end, according to different performance requirements, the configurations of <b>cable</b> <b>distribution</b> are discussed and selected...|$|R

40|$|The {{long-term}} behaviour {{of continuous}} steel-concrete composite beams is investigated {{to evaluate the}} effectiveness of the principal prestressing systems generally used to prevent concrete cracking in the regions of the internal supports. Four prestressing techniques are considered: the first with imposed support settlements, the second with <b>internal</b> <b>cables</b> in cast-in-situ slab, the third with <b>internal</b> <b>cables</b> in precast concrete slab and the fourth with external cables. The time-evolution of the compressive stress on the slab is studied evaluating the magnitude of the stress loss due to the concrete creep. The study is carried out on a composite beam model with flexible shear connection which permits taking into account the slip at the beam-slab interface and calculating the longitudinal shear force distribution which is particularly important at the cable anchorage sections...|$|R

Although the <b>cable</b> <b>distribution</b> of radio and TV broadcasts/output is getting incorporated into the sphere of legal economy, the insufficiencies of related legislation, deviations from the technical/technological standards and non-transparent business prac­tices indicate the incompleteness of the regularization in this area of telecommunica­tions.
