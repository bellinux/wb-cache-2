40|$|Abstract Background Middle {{cerebral}} artery occlusion (MCAo) in mice {{results in a}} brain infarct, the volume of which depends {{on the length of}} occlusion. Following permanent occlusion, neuropathological changes – including a robust glial inflammatory response – also occur downstream of the infarct in the spinal cord. Methods We have performed short, transient MCAo in mice to induce penumbral damage spanning the motor cortex. A 30 minute MCAo using a poly-L-lysine-coated intraluminal suture introduced through a common carotid artery incision was performed in 17 female C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Five sham-operated mice received common carotid artery ligation without insertion of the suture. Neurobehavioural assessments were performed during occlusion, immediately following reperfusion, and at 24 and 72 hours post-reperfusion. Routine histological and immunohistochemical studies were performed at 24 and 72 hours. Results In 11 of the surviving 16 mice subjected to MCAo, we observed a focal, subcortical necrotic lesion and a reproducible, <b>diffuse</b> <b>cortical</b> <b>lesion</b> with accompanying upper motor neuron involvement. This was associated with contralateral ventral spinal cord microglial priming without significant reactive astrocytosis or lower motor neuron degeneration. Conclusion The advantages to this method are that it yields a reproducible cortical lesion, the extent of which is predictable using behavioural testing during the period of ischemia, with upper motor neuron involvement and downstream priming, but not full activation, of microglia in the lumbar spinal cord. In addition, survival is excellent following the 30 minutes of occlusion, rendering this a novel and useful model for examining the effects of microglial priming in the spinal motor neuron pool. </p...|$|E

40|$|A clinicopathological {{study is}} {{presented}} {{of a case}} of Marchiafava-Bignami disease with a hemispheric disconnection syndrome, an association that {{does not appear to}} have been reported previously. Gross and microscopic examination of the brain revealed necrosis of the corpus callosum (sparing a small area in front of the splenium) and of the anterior commissure, cortical and subcortical infarction of the right lingual gyrus, <b>diffuse</b> <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions</b> of the laminar sclerosis type, and lacunae in the basal ganglia and the pons. The patient was unable to grasp objects presented to the right visual half-field with the left hand, or to respond to contralateral somaesthetic stimuli with either of the upper limbs. This motor inhibition, with the associated extended posture, is described as a "crossed avoiding reaction", and attributed to the inability of one hemisphere to respond to visual or somaesthetic stimuli projected to the other hemisphere. Clinicopathological correlations and visuomotor coordination mechanisms are discussed in the light of previous clinical and experimental studies. Anomia to pictures projected tachistoscopically to the left visual field, disturbances in the transfer of somaesthetic information, left sided ideomotor apraxia with agraphia, right sided dyscopia, and ideational apraxia especially marked in the right visual field were observed...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: We {{describe}} 2 {{cases of}} diffusion-weighted (DW) MR imaging in hypoglycemic coma. One patient, with <b>diffuse</b> <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions,</b> had a poor outcome, but the other, with transient white matter abnormalities, made a complete recovery. The distinctive patterns of DWMR imaging abnormalities in hypoglycemic {{patients should be}} recognized and may be a predictor of clinical outcome. The effects of hypoglycemic coma, especially when severeand prolonged, can be catastrophic. 1 Neurologic signs of hypoglycemia are nonspecific and include weakness, confu-sion, seizures, and coma, and delayed diagnosis {{can result in a}} poor outcome or death. On MR imaging, lesions in the cere-bral cortex, particularly the temporal lobe and/or hippocam-pus, 2 and the basal ganglia 3 have been described. There have only been 2 previous case reports of diffusion-weighted (DW) MR imaging findings in hypoglycemia, with hyperintense sig-nal intensity and reduced apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) involving the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and basal ganglia. 4 Recently, however, a different pattern of DWMR finding, involving the internal capsules, corona radiate, and frontopa-rietal cortex, was reported in a patient who later recovered from hypoglycemic coma without neurologic deficit. 5 We de-scribe DWMR imaging in 2 patients with different patterns of brain involvement and different clinical outcomes, thus illus-trating its potential use for diagnosis and prognosis in hypo-glycemic coma...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{clinical}} {{manifestations of}} nervous system involvement in {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} (neuropsychiatric SLE [NPSLE]) are highly diverse, and their etiology is incompletely understood. The {{aim of this study}} was to provide an inventory of abnormalities on conventional brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in NPSLE and to interpret the findings in relation to possible underlying pathogenetic mechanisms. METHODS: MR images of the first episode of active NPSLE in 74 patients were retrospectively reviewed. All patients fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1982 revised criteria for the classification of SLE and were classified according to the 1999 ACR case definitions for NPSLE syndromes. We excluded patients with a history of brain disease and patients in whom other mechanisms unrelated to SLE caused the neuropsychiatric symptoms. RESULTS: The principal findings were: 1) focal hyperintensities in white matter (WM) (49 % of all patients) or both WM and gray matter (GM) (5 % of all patients), suggestive of vasculopathy or vasculitis; 2) more widespread, confluent hyperintensities in the WM, suggestive of chronic hypoperfusion due to the same mechanisms; 3) <b>diffuse</b> <b>cortical</b> GM <b>lesions</b> (12 % of all patients), compatible with an immune response to neuronal components or postseizure changes; and 4) absence of MRI abnormalities, despite signs and symptoms of active disease (42 % of all patients). CONCLUSION: Several distinct brain MRI patterns were observed in patients with active NPSLE, suggestive of different pathogenetic mechanisms. To advance our understanding of the various processes leading to NPSLE, the radiographic manifestations may be a good starting point and useful for categorization of patients in further research...|$|R

We investigated the relative frequency and subtypes of <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions</b> and their relationships to white matter lesions and cognitive and physical disability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: <b>Cortical</b> <b>lesions</b> were identified and classified {{on the basis of}} concurrent review of 3 D FLAIR and 3 D T 1 -weighted IR-SPGR 3 T MR images in 26 patients with MS. Twenty-five patients completed the MACFIMS battery. White matter <b>lesion</b> volume, <b>cortical</b> <b>lesion</b> number, and <b>cortical</b> <b>lesion</b> volume were assessed. RESULTS: Overall, 249 <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions</b> were detected. <b>Cortical</b> <b>lesions</b> were present in 24 / 26 patients (92. 3 %) (range per patient, 0 – 30; mean, 9. 6 8. 8). Most (94. 4 %, n 235) <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions</b> were classified as mixed cortical-subcortical (type I); the remaining 5. 6 % (n 14) were classified as purely intracortical (type II). Subpial <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions</b> (type III) were not detected. White matter lesion volume correlated with <b>cortical</b> <b>lesion</b> number and <b>cortical</b> <b>lesion</b> volume (rS 0. 652, rS 0. 705, respectively; both P. 001). After controlling for age, depression, and premorbid intelligence, we found that all MR imaging variables (<b>cortical</b> <b>lesion</b> number, <b>cortical</b> <b>lesion</b> volume, white matter lesion volume) corre-lated with the SDMT score (R 2 0. 513, R 2 0. 449, R 2 0. 418, respectively; P. 014); <b>cortical</b> <b>lesion</b> number also correlated with the CVLT-II scores (R 2 0. 542 – 0. 461, P. 043).

Among them is the low contrast between small <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions</b> and surrounding <b>cortical</b> gray matter offered by present techniques. METHODS: T 1 -weighted 3 D spoiled gradient-recalled-echo (SPGR) volumes and 2 D fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences of 22 patients with MS who had 12 monthly brain MR imaging examinations at 1. 5 T, using a quadrature head coil, were retrospectively analyzed. These serial studies were coregistered and averaged to generate a single high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) mean image, which was used to identify <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions.</b> The means of 12 FLAIRs and SPGRs from 14 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers were analyzed as well.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent {{studies suggest}} that <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions</b> in {{multiple}} sclerosis (MS) substantially contribute to clinical disease severity. The present study aimed at investigating clinical, neuroanatomical, and cognitive correlates of these <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions</b> with a novel approach, i. e. by comparing two samples of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients, one group with and the other without <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions.</b> METHODS: High-resolution structural MRI was acquired from 42 RRMS patients and 43 controls (HC). The patient group was dichotomized based on the presence versus absence of DIR-hyperintense cortex-involving lesions, resulting in a <b>cortical</b> <b>lesion</b> group (CL, n[*]=[*] 32) and a non-cortical lesion group (nCL, n = 10). Cognitive functioning was assessed in all participants with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery, covering mnestic, executive, and attentional functions. RESULTS: Highest densities of <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions</b> in the CL group were observed in the bilateral parahippocampal gyrus. Relative to HC, patients with <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions</b> - but not those without - showed significant global cortical thinning and mnestic deficits.

40|$|Abstract Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) {{is typically}} {{considered to be}} a chronic inflammatory-demyelinating disease of CNS white matter. In the past decade, however, pathological and MRI studies have shown that lesions are often located in the gray matter, especially in the cerebral cortex. The histopathological characteristics of these <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions</b> differ substantially from lesions located in the white matter, which suggests location-dependent expression of the MS immunopathological process. Double inversion recovery imaging [...] an MRI technique that selectively images gray matter and lesions [...] has enabled researchers to image <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions</b> in vivo. Double inversion recovery studies have shown that <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions</b> can be detected at the earliest clinical stages of MS, and <b>cortical</b> <b>lesion</b> burden positively correlates with the severity of physical and cognitive impairments.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to determine the possible relation between deficits in spatial representation capability and vestibular function following <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions.</b> We thus investigated vestibulo-ocular behaviour in a group of 14 patients with unilateral cortical damage involving the occipito-temporo-parietal junction. Patients were divided in three sub-groups: (1) Group R+: five patients with right sided <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions</b> associated with a left hemi-neglect, (2) Group R−: four patients with right sided <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions</b> with no hemi-neglect and (3) Group L: five patients with left-sided <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions.</b> The patient groups were compared to a group of eight healthy age-matched subjects. The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) was tested in complete darkness by rotating the subject around the vertical axis by sinusoidal rotation at different frequencies, and by steps of acceleration or deceleration. The nystagmus slow phase velocity was measured and plotted {{as a function of the}} head velocity and the VOR parameters including gain, bias, time constant and phase were calculated. The <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions</b> induced a significant VOR asymmetry in terms of: a directional preponderance of the VOR gain to the contralesion side, only during sinusoidal rotation, and, in contrast, a VOR bias and a directional preponderance of the VOR time constant and of the nystagmus frequency to the side of the <b>cortical</b> <b>lesion.</b> These latter VOR deficits were the most significant in the R+ group, i. e. in right <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions</b> with hemi-neglect syndrome.

40|$|Objective: <b>Cortical</b> <b>lesions</b> in {{multiple}} sclerosis (MS) are notoriously difficult to visualize with standard MR imaging (MRI) techniques. However, {{the use of}} higher field-strengths with intrinsically higher signal-to-noise, which can partly be used to increase spatial resolution, may improve <b>cortical</b> <b>lesion</b> detection. Therefore, in this post mortem study, the sensitivity of high fieldstrength MRI (4. 7 T) for <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions</b> was investigated, and {{compared to that of}} standard field-strength (1. 5 T). Methods: At 1. 5 T, dual-echo T 2 -weighted spin-echo, as well as 3 D-FLAIR images of seventeen formalin-fixed coronal MS and four control hemispheres were acquired. At 4. 7 T, the same specimens were imaged with a mainly proton-density (PD) - weighted sequence. Proteolipid protein (PLP) -stained tissue sections (10 μm) of the same brain slices were matched to the corresponding MR images, and <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions</b> were scored on all three MR sequences (blinded to histology) and in tissue sections (blinded to MRI). Sensitivity of the sequences for four <b>cortical</b> <b>lesion</b> types was calculated. Additionally, an unblinded, retrospective MR scoring was performed. Results: Sensitivity for purely intracortical lesions (histological lesion types II, III, and IV; n = 128) was below 10 % for both 1. 5 T and 4. 7 T MRI, while mixed gray matter-white matter (type I) lesions (n = 5) were detected in four out of five cases. All lesion counts increased upon retrospective (unblinded) scoring. However, up to 80 % of the intracortical lesions still remained undetected.

We therefore compared the cortical effects of homonymous lesions {{of the central}} retina with effects of <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions.</b> All in vivo experiments were performed in anaesthetized, adult cats. Retinal lesions were made with a Xenon-light photocoagulator, and <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions</b> were induced by focal application of heat or ibotenic acid injection. Both, in cortical regions representing the retinal scotoma and at the border of small focal <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions</b> single neuron activity was initially suppressed and accompanied by a narrow area of increased activity adjacent to the region of functional loss during the first 1 - 2 weeks. At the same time an increased glutamatergic NMDA response and a reduction of GABA(A) and GABA(B) responses was observed around the <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions</b> in vitro. At an early stage long-term potentiation (LTP) is facilitated in those regions that were characterized by local upregulation of excitation and downregulation of inhibition after <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions.</b> Similarly, at the border of cortical scotomas in area 17 an increased glutamate level was found while inside the scotoma GAD levels were reduced. Shifts in topography of retinal representation as well as increases of receptive field size were detected as signs of lesion-induced neuronal reorganization after retinal and <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions</b> with longer survival times. A common cascade of events is triggered in the visual cortex by retinal as well as cortical lesions: reduced GABAergic inhibition and increased glutamatergic excitation, leading to increased spontaneous activity and visual excitability that is accompanied by facilitated LTP, and appears to initiate local cortical reorganization after functional disturbances in the visual system. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|In {{subjects}} with multiple sclerosis (MS), pathology is more frequent near {{the inner and}} outer surfaces of the brain. Here, we sought to explore if in {{subjects with}} primary progressive MS (PPMS) <b>cortical</b> <b>lesion</b> load is selectively associated with the severity of periventricular normal appearing white matter (NAWM) damage, as assessed with diffusion weighted imaging. To this aim, twenty-four subjects with PPMS and twenty healthy controls were included in the study. Using diffusion data, skeletonized mean diffusivity (MD) NAWM maps were computed excluding WM lesions and a 2  mm-thick peri-lesional rim. The supra-tentorial voxels between 2 and 6  mm of distance from the lateral ventricles were included in the periventricular NAWM mask while the voxels between 6 and 10  mm from the lateral ventricles were included in the deep NAWM mask; mean MD values were then computed separately for these two masks. Lastly, <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions</b> were assessed on phase-sensitive inversion recovery (PSIR) images and cortical thickness was quantified on volumetric T 1 images. Our main result was the observation in the PPMS group of a significant correlation between periventricular NAWM MD values and <b>cortical</b> <b>lesion</b> load, with a greater <b>cortical</b> <b>lesion</b> burden being associated with more abnormal periventricular NAWM MD. Conversely, there was no correlation between <b>cortical</b> <b>lesion</b> load and deep NAWM MD values or periventricular WM lesions.

The {{extent to which}} <b>cortical</b> <b>lesion</b> load is associated with longer-term physical and cognitive disability in different multiple sclerosis phenotypes {{has not yet been}} investigated. Thus, a 5 -year prospective longitudinal study was carried on in a large group of patients with multiple sclerosis. Three hundred and twelve consecutive patients suffering from multiple sclerosis (157 relapsing remitting, 35 paediatric, 45 benign, 44 primary progressive and 31 secondary progressive) were enrolled in a 5 -year prospective clinical and neuroimaging study. Several magnetic resonance parameters (including <b>cortical</b> <b>lesion</b> number and volume, contrast-enhancing <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions</b> and grey matter atrophy) were analysed to find associations with clinical and cognitive outcomes. Patients with high <b>cortical</b> <b>lesion</b> load had higher Expanded Disability Status Scale increase (median = 1. 5; range = 0 - 3) during the study than both patients with low <b>cortical</b> <b>lesion</b> load (median = 1. 0; range = 1 - 3, P < 0. 001) and without <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions</b> (median = 0. 5; range = - 1 to 2, P < 0. 001). Compared with clinically stable patients, 101 (32. 4 %) patients showing clinical progression at 5 years had the highest rate of <b>cortical</b> <b>lesion</b> accumulation (P < 0. 001). Stepwise regression analysis revealed significant and independent contributions from age (β = 0. 55), <b>cortical</b> <b>lesion</b> volume (β = 0. 58), T(2) white matter lesion volume (β = 0. 34) and grey matter fraction (β = 0. 42) as predictors (final model with r(2) = 0. 657, P < 0. 001) of Expanded Disability Status Scale change. Disease duration (β = 0. 52, P < 0. 001), <b>cortical</b> <b>lesion</b> volume (β = 0. 67, P < 0. 001), grey matter fraction (β = 0. 56, P < 0. 001) and T(2) white matter lesion volume (β = 0. 31, P = 0. 040) at baseline were found to be independent predictors of cognitive status {{at the end of the}} study. While confirming the relevance of cortical pathology in all multiple sclerosis phenotypes, but benign, our study suggests that grey matter and white matter changes in multiple sclerosis occur, at least, partly independently, and that grey matter, more than white matter, damage is associated with physical and cognitive disability progression. Thus, the combination of grey and white matter parameters gives a more comprehensive view of multiple sclerosis pathology and allows a better understanding of the progressive phase of the disease, which, however, seems more related to cortical damage than to subcortical white matter changes...|$|R

50|$|Palinopsia necessitates a full {{ophthalmologic}} and neurologic {{history and}} physical exam. Hallucinatory palinopsia warrants automated visual field testing and neuroimaging since {{the majority of}} hallucinatory palinopsia is caused by posterior <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions</b> and seizures. It is generally easy to diagnose the underlying cause of hallucinatory palinopsia. The medical history typically includes concerning symptoms, and neuroimaging usually reveals <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions.</b> In patients with hallucinatory palinopsia and unremarkable neuroimaging, blood tests or clinical history often hints at the cause. The practitioner should be considering visual seizures in these cases.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Although {{historically}} {{considered a}} disease primarily affecting the white {{matter of the}} central nervous system, recent pathological and imaging studies have established that cortical demyelination is common in multiple sclerosis and more extensive than previously appreciated. Subpial, intracortical and leukocortical lesions are the three <b>cortical</b> <b>lesion</b> types described in the cerebral and cerebellar cortices of patients with multiple sclerosis. Cortical demyelination may be the pathological substrate of progression, and an important pathologic correlate of irreversible disability, epilepsy and cognitive impairment. <b>Cortical</b> <b>lesions</b> of chronic progressive multiple sclerosis patients are characterized by a dominant effector cell population of microglia, {{by the absence of}} macrophagic and leukocytic inflammatory infiltrates, and may be driven in part by organized meningeal inflammatory infiltrates. Cortical demyelination is also present and common in early MS, is topographically associated with prominent meningeal inflammation and may even precede the appearance of classic white matter plaques in some MS patients. However, the pathology of early <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions</b> is different than that of chronic MS in the sense that early <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions</b> are highly inflammatory, suggesting that neurodegeneration in MS occurs on an inflammatory background and raising interesting questions regarding the role of cortical demyelination and meningeal inflammation in initiating and perpetuating the disease process in early MS. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{relevance}} of cortical grey matter pathology in multiple sclerosis {{has become increasingly}} recognized over the past decade. Unfortunately, {{a large part of}} <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions</b> remain undetected on magnetic resonance imaging using standard field strength. In vivo studies have shown improved detection by using higher magnetic field strengths up to 7 T. So far, a systematic histopathological verification of ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging pulse sequences has been lacking. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the sensitivity of 7 T versus 3 T magnetic resonance imaging pulse sequences for the detection of <b>cortical</b> multiple sclerosis <b>lesions</b> by directly comparing them to histopathology. We obtained hemispheric coronally cut brain sections of 19 patients with multiple sclerosis and four control subjects after rapid autopsy and formalin fixation, and scanned them using 3 T and 7 T magnetic resonance imaging systems. Pulse sequences included T 1 -weighted, T 2 -weighted, fluid attenuated inversion recovery, double inversion recovery and T 2 *. <b>Cortical</b> <b>lesions</b> (type I-IV) were scored on all sequences by an experienced rater blinded to histopathology and clinical data. Staining was performed with antibodies against proteolipid protein and scored by a second reader blinded to magnetic resonance imaging and clinical data. Subsequently, magnetic resonance imaging images were matched to histopathology and sensitivity of pulse sequences was calculated. Additionally, a second unblinded (retrospective) scoring of magnetic resonance images was performed. Regardless of pulse sequence, 7 T magnetic resonance imaging detected more <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions</b> than 3 T. Fluid attenuated inversion recovery (7 T) detected 225 % more <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions</b> than 3 T fluid attenuated inversion recovery (Z = 2. 22, P < 0. 05) and 7 T T 2 * detected 200 % more <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions</b> than 3 T T 2 * (Z = 2. 05, P < 0. 05). Sensitivity of 7 T magnetic resonance imaging was influenced by <b>cortical</b> <b>lesion</b> type: 100 % for type I (T 2), 11 % for type II (FLAIR/T 2), 32 % for type III (T 2 *), and 68 % for type IV (T 2). We conclude that ultra-high field 7 T magnetic resonance imaging more than doubles detection of <b>cortical</b> multiple sclerosis <b>lesions,</b> compared to 3 T magnetic resonance imaging.

In a previous study, patients with <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions</b> were shown to recover more rapidly than patients with subcortical lesions, yet recovery was used in terms of motor function only [20]. Proprioception deficit seems to be different as it is more linked to cortical sensory integrating regions. Right supramarginal gyrus was proved {{to play a major role}} in proprioception loss in stroke patients [21] thus may be explaining prolonged recovery of proprioception in patients with <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions.</b> On the other hand, relation between lesion site (right or left) and proprioceptive deficit was rejected by Dukelow et al. [8], which support our results where no difference was found between site or bilaterality of the lesion and proprioception deficit.

In this study, 6 -hydroxydopamine was injected into the right medial forebrain bundle to induce dopamine depletion, and/or ibotenic acid was injected into the M 1 cortex to induce motor cortex lesions. Immunohistochemistry and western blot assay showed that dopaminergic depletion results in significant loss of striatal projection neurons marked by dopamine- and cyclic adenosine monophosphate-regulated phosphoprotein, molecular weight 32 kDa, calbindin, and μ-opioid receptor, while <b>cortical</b> <b>lesions</b> reversed these pathological changes. After dopaminergic deletion, the number of neuropeptide Y-positive striatal interneurons markedly increased, which was also inhibited by <b>cortical</b> <b>lesioning.</b> No noticeable change {{in the number of}} parvalbumin-positive interneurons was found in 6 -hydroxydopamine-treated rats.
