While several wind turbine designs are available in the industry, developing a wind turbine for continuous commercial electricity production is one of the challenging engineering problems in todays world. This work involves design, analysis and development of a nacelle main load frame for a 500 kw wind turbine as part of the national wind turbine development project (MILRES) of Turkey. Starting from conceptual design stage complete static and dynamic analyses were conducted including the crane loads on the nacelle bedplate. Conceptual and detail design work were conducted using commercially available 3 D solid modeling code SOLIDWORKS. Structural analyses such as stress and strain calculations and modal analyses of the main load frame were performed using the finite element method. A hybrid (cast iron main base and weld formed <b>steel</b> <b>extension)</b> structure has been developed to improve stiffness while controlling overall weight.

40|$|A major {{environmental}} issue for hydro-electric power generation is passage of fish through turbines, or entrainment onto trash racks. At Yarrawonga Weir, {{on the upper}} Murray River in south-eastern Australia, the positioning of a fish lock resulted in the potential for upstream migrating fish to be swept back into the adjacent power station by cross flows.

In 2005 (power station inflows 12 000 ML day(- 1)), fish again exited successfully (26 of 27) but with a higher proportion entrained (5 of 27; 18 %).

40|$|In 2014, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Kennedy Space Center (KSC) funded {{a project}} titled "Familiarization and Detection of Green Monopropellants" {{utilizing}} Independent Research and Technology Development (IR&TD) and Center Innovation Fund (CIF) funding. The {{purpose of the}} project was to evaluate methods of detection for ammonium dinitramide (ADN) and hydroxylammonium nitrate (HAN). An Engineering Services Contract (ESC) task order was created with the scope of evaluation of several methods of detecting ADN- and HAN-based propellants, as well as development of methods for detection. Detection methods include developed methods such as colorimetric indicating absorbent socks, and commercial-off-the- shelf (COTS) units for ammonia detection. An additional goal of the task order was for ESC to become familiar with ADN's and HAN's material properties and material compatibility. Two approaches were initially investigated as possible methods for the detection of HAN (or AFM 315 E) and ADN (or LMP- 103 S). These approaches were colorimetric analysis and instrumentation-based COTS vapor sensors utilization. Initial testing showed that the relatively non-existent vapor pressure of the AF-M 315 E (of which HAN is a major component) propellant would make the use of COTS sensors difficult for real-time area monitoring of HAN; a small response was detected through the use of active COTS sensors, including the RAE Systems MultiRAE Lite and Drager X-act (registered) 5000, but the levels detected were below the threshold limit value for the toxic gas ammonia. Therefore, a detection system ased upon a colorimetric indicator impregnated into an absorbent material was developed. Preliminary analysis (ESC- 245 -FDG- 001) identified a particularly outstanding candidate as a colorimetric indicator for the detection of the presence of AF-M 315 E {{in the form of a}} Methyl Red (Basic) indicator. Materials impregnated with this indicator exhibit significant color change and the materials are not susceptible to interference from exposure to water or carbon dioxide. The completed detection system for HAN/AF-M 315 E consists of absorbent socks packed with Fisher Universal Spill Absorbent capable of absorbing and containing any propellant spills that they come into contact with along with indicating wipes. The absorbent socks are also chemically treated with a Methyl Red (Basic) indicator solution to provide the end user with a visual indication that a leak has occurred and proper protective precautions must be undertaken. An added benefit of this detection system is that the absorbent socks should neutralize/absorb any commodity that it comes into contact with (until saturation is reached). Additional adsorbent socks can be deployed until a color change is not seen, indicating that the HAN/AF-M 315 E contamination has been contained. The indicating wipes provide the user the opportunity to wipe surfaces to determine if there is any HAN/AF-M 315 E or HAN/AFM 315 E residue present. The wipes should allow the detection of fuel levels that may be too small to detect with the absorbent socks. The development of a detection system for the ADN/LMP- 103 S focused on the use of various COTS sensors used as real-time area monitoring devices and personal dosimeters. These COTS based sensor systems were of several different types, including both actively pumped and diffusion-based passive systems, as well as a "rope"-type chemical sensing cable. The results highlighted some of the major differences between the two monopropellants undergoing evaluation. Unlike HAN, ADN (which is the major constituent of LMP- 103 S) exhibits a much more volatile nature in comparison to AF-M 315 E. In fact, testing showed that a large percentage of the fuel was lost during the sampling measurement (greater than 10 percent by mass); although this testing cannot tell if the volatile component is the ADN itself or another component of the monopropellant solution. Not surprisingly, all four of the procured vapor-based COTS sensors showed positive results when exposed to solutions of the LMP- 103 S (ESC- 245 -FDG- 002). The completed detection system for ADN/LMP- 103 S consists of a combination of two of the tested COTS sensor systems, the RAE Systems MultiRAE Lite and the BW Technologies GasAlert Extreme. These systems are meant to be used in conjunction with one another, which allows for the end-user to have both real-time area monitoring (MultiRAE Lite) as well as a personal dosimeter device (GasAlert Extreme) which can be worn as additional personal protective equipment. An stainless <b>steel</b> <b>extension</b> wand was fabricated and included in the detection system for the MultiRAE Lite to allow for more remote sensing, and connects via the active pumping inlet of the sensor. As stated, the final results of this testing resulted in the production of two "kits" which can be used for the detection of HAN/AF-M 315 E and ADN/LMP- 103 s (ESC- 245 -FDG- 003) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} {{life for}} a concrete structure located {{in an environment where}} corrosion is promoted by humidity or chlorides from sea or de-icing salt could in general be described in the following manner. The structure is manufactured and is at that point considered to be intact. Corrosion is assumed to attack the steel reinforcement, and at a certain corrosion level the structure has to be repaired. The cover concrete is removed and the corroded steel reinforcement is cleaned from corrosion products. A repair system consisting of primer and repair mortar is used to refill the cavity left after the removed concrete. The structure is now considered repaired {{in the sense that the}} degradation rate is decreased and the signs of corrosion are taken away. The corrosion attack and repair procedure could affect the load carrying capacity of the repaired beam in terms of decreased steel content and changed interface conditions between the steel and repair mortar. Strengthening could be applied to fulfil a possible lack of load carrying capacity. The life cycle described above has been simulated in a laboratory environment. The test program and the results provided from the monitoring of beam specimens are presented in the thesis. A probabilistic approach is employed in this thesis to calculate the change in probability of failure for the different stages of the life cycle. First, all relevant parameters were considered as stochastic and given appropriate statistical properties. With this information the increase in probability of failure is estimated for the corroded, repaired and strengthened beams compared to the intact beam. It has been found that the accelerated corrosion setup provided a steel mass content loss of 12 % in the corroded region, corresponding to an average decrease in steel bar diameter by 6 %. This corrosion damage was obtained after 75 days of accelerated corrosion at a corrosion current density of 0, 10 mA/cm 2. Both evenly distributed corrosion as well as pitting corrosion attack was observed. The concrete beam stiffness was recorded to 2980 kNm 2 before the corrosion process and decreased by 15 % to 2530 kNm 2 after corrosion of tensile steel reinforcement. This is verified both by measuring stiffness globally using displacement gauges and locally using strain sensors. The result indicates that there is a strong relation between the deterioration process and the change in curvature and stiffness, suggesting that this is a method to measure the status of the structure. The status could for instance be defined by a performance factor, which equals 1 for the intact structure and then decrease to represent the relation between the stiffness of the deteriorated and the intact structure. If the structure is strengthened, the performance factor could be larger than 1. The ductility of the corroded steel reinforcing bars decreased with 55 % due to corrosion compared to the undamaged steel reinforcing bars. The ultimate strain for the corroded bars was recorded to 10 %, while the ultimate strain for the undamaged bars was 22 %. This reduction is caused by pitting corrosion, which produces local stress concentrations along the bar. The failure occurs when the ultimate strain capacity is exceeded in one cross section, leading to an early failure of the steel bar specimen. The global <b>extension</b> of the <b>steel</b> specimen remains small as the failure strain acts on a small region of the total length. For the structural element this will lead to a failure at a particular corrosion level, since the local pits will dramatically decrease the load carrying capacity in one section. A failure of a structural member which is attacked by pitting corrosion could be unnoticed in terms of visual evidence, since the elongation of the steel reinforcement is be kept at a moderate level at failure of steel reinforcement because of the local damages that pitting may create. The strain at yielding is recorded to 0, 39 % for the intact steel bar and 0, 43 % for the corroded. Failure was defined as yielding of steel reinforcement for unstrengthened beams, and as debonding of CFRP plate for the strengthened beam. The load carrying capacity for the intact beam was 79, 8 kN. The load carrying capacity was decreased by 15 % after corrosion of steel reinforcement to 69 kN. For the beam where the cover concrete was removed the load carrying capacity was decreased another 18 % down to 60 kN in comparison to the intact beam. Yielding of steel reinforcement for the repaired beam occurred at 64, 8 kN, and debonding of CFRP plate for the repaired & strengthened beam occurred at 82, 7 kN. These results show that a 12 % reduction of steel content in the cross section occurred during the corrosion phase, at the same time as the stiffness was reduced by 15 %. An analytical model indicates that the 12 % reduction of steel content should decrease the stiffness by 9 %. The remaining stiffness decrease may be coupled to creep. Another important fact is that the particular strengthening design upgraded the repaired & strengthened beam to reach a load carrying capacity which exceeds the intact beam. The life cycle behaviour for the concrete beams used in the study shows the same general results in comparison to an FE-analysis. It should be mentioned that the FE-analysis performed has not been done on the tested beams in this study. An analysis of these will however be conducted at a later stage. The probabilistic approach of the studied life cycle shows that the probability of failure increased two times for the corroded beam compared to the intact beam, and further up to seven times for the repaired beam. The increase in probability of failure for the corroded beam is related to steel mass loss. The repaired beam has an even higher probability of failure than the corroded beam since the effective height is reduced during removal of cover concrete of the loaded beam. By strengthening the repaired beam by bonding a CFRP plate, the probability of failure is decreased beyond the intact beam for the particular strengthening operation performed in the study.
