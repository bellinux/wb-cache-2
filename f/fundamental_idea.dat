5|$|In {{the field}} of {{statistics}} and applied probability, John Graunt published Natural and Political Observations Made upon the Bills of Mortality also in 1662, initiating the discipline of demography. This work, among other things, gave a statistical estimate {{of the population of}} London, produced the first life table, gave probabilities of survival of different age groups, examined the different causes of death, noting that the annual rate of suicide and accident is constant, and commented on the level and stability of sex ratio. The usefulness and interpretation of Graunt's tables were discussed in a series of correspondences by brothers Ludwig and Christiaan Huygens in 1667, where they realized the difference between mean and median estimates and Christian even interpolated Graunt's life table by a smooth curve, creating the first continuous probability distribution; but their correspondences were not published. Later, Johan de Witt, the then prime minister of the Dutch Republic, published similar material in his 1671 work Waerdye van Lyf-Renten (A Treatise on Life Annuities), which used statistical concepts to determine life expectancy for practical political purposes; a demonstration of the fact that this sapling branch of mathematics had significant pragmatic applications. De Witt's work was not widely distributed beyond the Dutch Republic, perhaps due to his fall from power and execution by mob in 1672. Apart from the practical contributions of these two work, they also exposed a <b>fundamental</b> <b>idea</b> that probability can be assigned to events that do not have inherent physical symmetry, such as the chances of dying at certain age, unlike say the rolling of a dice or flipping of a coin, simply by counting the frequency of occurrence. Thus probability could be more than mere combinatorics.|$|E
25|$|Although the <b>fundamental</b> <b>idea</b> {{behind the}} {{analytic}} tableau method {{is derived from}} the cut-elimination theorem of structural proof theory, the origins of tableau calculi lie in the meaning (or semantics) of the logical connectives, as the connection with proof theory was made only in recent decades.|$|E
25|$|Schleiermacher's own moral {{system is}} an attempt to supply these deficiencies. It connects the moral world by a {{deductive}} process with the <b>fundamental</b> <b>idea</b> of knowledge and being; it offers a view of the entire world of human action which at all events aims at being exhaustive; it presents an arrangement of the matter of the science which tabulates its constituents after the model of the physical sciences; and it supplies a sharply defined treatment of specific moral phenomena in their relation to the <b>fundamental</b> <b>idea</b> of human life as a whole. Schleiermacher defines ethics as the theory {{of the nature of the}} reason, or as the scientific treatment of the effects produced by human reason in the world of nature and man.|$|E

25|$|The neuron {{doctrine}} is the now <b>fundamental</b> <b>idea</b> that neurons {{are the basic}} structural and functional units of the nervous system.

25|$|It {{was only}} {{the first of the}} three {{sections}} of the science of ethics — the doctrine of moral ends — that Schleiermacher handled with approximate completeness; the other two sections were treated very summarily. In his Christian Ethics he dealt with the subject from the basis of the Christian consciousness instead of from that of reason generally; the ethical phenomena dealt with are the same in both systems, and they throw light on each other, while the Christian system treats more at length and less aphoristically the principal ethical realities — church, state, family, art, science and society. Rothe, amongst other moral philosophers, bases his system substantially, with important departures, on Schleiermacher's. In Beneke's moral system his <b>fundamental</b> <b>idea</b> was worked out in its psychological relations.|$|E
25|$|While {{a public}} {{authority}} may have fulfilled {{the legal and}} factual conditions {{required in order to}} properly exercise its statutory power, it may be deemed to have acted illegally if it makes its decision in a manner that contravenes administrative law rules. Under this category of judicial review, the courts' basic approach is to inquire if a decision-maker has taken into account all relevant considerations that it is required to take into account, and disregarded the irrelevant ones in making its decision. If it is satisfied that the decision-maker has done so, then the decision will stand, subject to other administrative law rules having been satisfied. The emphasis here is not on the body's decision itself, but on certain aspects of the reasoning process by which the decision was reached. Such an approach is consistent with the <b>fundamental</b> <b>idea</b> of judicial review that courts should not be concerned about the merits of a decision, but instead, only with its legality.|$|E

25|$|How Xenocrates {{tried to}} {{establish}} and connect scientifically these assumptions, which appear to be taken chiefly from his books {{on the nature of}} the gods, we do not learn, and can only discover the one <b>fundamental</b> <b>idea</b> at the basis of them, that all grades of existence are penetrated by divine power, and that this grows less and less energetic in proportion as it descends to the perishable and individual. Hence he also appears to have maintained that as far as consciousness extends, so far also extends an intuition of that all-ruling divine power, of which he represented even irrational animals as partaking. But neither the thick nor the thin, to the different combinations of which he appears to have tried to refer the various grades of material existence, were regarded by him as in themselves partaking of soul; doubtless because he referred them immediately to the divine activity, and was far from attempting to reconcile the duality of the principia, or to resolve them into an original unity. Hence too he was for proving the incorporeality of the soul by the fact that it is not nourished as the body is.|$|E

Taoism differs from Confucianism by not emphasizing rigid rituals and social order. Taoist ethics vary depending on the particular school, but in general tend to emphasize wu wei (effortless action), [...] "naturalness", simplicity, spontaneity, and the Three Treasures: 慈 [...] "compassion", 儉 [...] "frugality", and 不敢為天下先 [...] "humility".|$|E

500|$|Critics {{praised the}} core {{morphing}} concept but criticized its repetitive gameplay, awkward controls, easy combat, disorganized introduction, and overemphasis on tutorial. Bramwell (Eurogamer) wrote that though the <b>fundamental</b> <b>idea</b> was good, the repetitious combinations of elemental attacks were rarely novel and often laborious. The excitement of realizing a puzzle's solution, Bramwell said, was often ruined by the player's struggle {{to perform the}} task correctly. He wrote that the game's design constrained players and [...] "bred apathy". For example, tutorials followed the scenes {{in which they would}} have been useful, cutscenes left no puzzle solution to imagination, puzzle solutions were rarely revisited after their first use, and character dialogue overstated the importance of simple puzzles. Bramwell was [...] "desperate" [...] for the freedom to experiment without forced guidance. [...] "The game", he wrote, [...] "hardly ever stops telling you what to do." [...] Clayman (IGN) agreed that there was too much help but alternatively appreciated the continual challenge and activity density of Kameo level design, with townspeople interspersed within the level's action. He also liked to experiment in the Badlands as a break from the puzzles. Clayman found the game's combat easy but fun. He especially enjoyed the slowed time combat. Bramwell (Eurogamer) said that the [...] "relative pleasure" [...] of Kameo combat was ultimately worth little, as the player could use basic attacks and avoid most major upgrades throughout the whole game. Phil Theobald (GameSpy) added that character upgrades were required for maintaining interest in the gameplay, but that the game does not incentivize finding such combinations. Pfister (1UP.com) too found the gameplay balance and puzzle design insipid.|$|E
500|$|The <b>fundamental</b> <b>idea</b> of [...] "restoration" [...] or [...] "Christian Primitivism" [...] is that {{problems}} or {{deficiencies in the}} church can be corrected by using the primitive church as a [...] "normative model." [...] The call for restoration is often justified {{on the basis of}} a [...] "falling away" [...] that corrupted the original purity of the church. [...] This falling away is identified with the development of Catholicism and denominationalism. [...] New Testament verses that discuss future apostasy (...) and heresy (e.g., , , [...] ) are understood to predict this falling away. [...] The logic of [...] "restoration" [...] could imply that the [...] "true" [...] church completely disappeared and thus lead towards exclusivism. [...] Another view of restoration is that the [...] "true Church ... has always existed by grace and not by human engineering" [...] (italics in the original). [...] In this view the goal is to [...] "help Christians realize the ideal of the church in the New Testament– to restore the church as conceived in the mind of Christ" [...] (italics in the original). [...] Early Restoration Movement leaders did not believe that the church had ceased to exist, but instead sought to reform and reunite the church. [...] A number of congregations' web sites explicitly state that the true church never disappeared. [...] The belief in a general falling away is not seen as inconsistent with the idea that a faithful remnant of the church never entirely disappeared. Some have attempted to trace this remnant through the intervening centuries between the New Testament and the beginning of the Restoration Movement in the early 1800s.|$|E

2500|$|Modern logic {{begins with}} {{what is known as}} the [...] "algebraic school", {{originating}} with Boole and including Peirce, Jevons, Schröder, and Venn. Their objective was to develop a calculus to formalise reasoning in the area of classes, propositions, and probabilities. [...] The school begins with Boole's seminal work Mathematical Analysis of Logic which appeared in 1847, although De Morgan (1847) is its immediate precursor. The <b>fundamental</b> <b>idea</b> of Boole's system is that algebraic formulae can be used to express logical relations. [...] This idea occurred to Boole in his teenage years, working as an usher in a private school in Lincoln, Lincolnshire. [...] For example, let x and y stand for classes let the symbol = signify that the classes have the same members, xy stand for the class containing all and only the members of x and y and so on. [...] Boole calls these elective symbols, i.e. symbols which select certain objects for consideration. [...] An expression in which elective symbols are used is called an elective function, and an equation of which the members are elective functions, is an elective equation. The theory of elective functions and their [...] "development" [...] is essentially the modern idea of truth-functions and their expression in disjunctive normal form.|$|E
2500|$|... "Naomi": Or rather [...] "No-o-mi." [...] The precise {{import of}} the word is not {{absolutely}} ascertained; but {{it is probable that}} it is somewhat abbreviated, and means [...] "God is sweet," [...] or, very literally, [...] "Jah is sweetness." [...] It had been originally imposed as a name by some grateful and happy mother, who, by gracious providences, or by other gracious revelations, had been led to think that [...] "sweet are the ways, sweet are the dealings, and sweet is the character of God." [...] The word does not mean [...] "beautiful", as some suppose; nor [...] "gracious", as others suppose; nor [...] "my delight", as others still suppose. It was not intended to describe the character of the person who was to bear the name. It was intended to signalize, in the spirit of a manifesto, a much-prized feature in the Divine character - that feature, namely, that is displayed when [...] "he deals sweetly with men." [...] Gesenius is doubtless right when he makes sweetness the <b>fundamental</b> <b>idea</b> of the whole group of affiliated words (see his 'Thesaurus,' in voc.). The cognate Hebrew adjective is rendered [...] "sweet" [...] in [...] and [...] (compare [...] and the margin of [...] ).
