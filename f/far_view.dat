500|$|Between 750 and 800, Mesa Verdeans began {{constructing}} {{two large}} water containment structures in canyon bottoms– the Morefield and Box Elder reservoirs. Soon afterward, work began on two more: the <b>Far</b> <b>View</b> and Sagebrush reservoirs, which were approximately [...] across and constructed on the mesa top. The reservoirs lie on an east-west line that runs for approximately , which suggests builders followed a centralized {{plan for the}} system. In 2004, the American Society of Civil Engineers designated these four structures as National Civil Engineering Historic Landmarks. A 2014 geospatial analyses suggested that neither collection nor retention of water was possible in the <b>Far</b> <b>View</b> Reservoir. This interpretation views the structure as a ceremonial space with procession roads in an adaptation of Chacoan culture.|$|E

500|$|The {{expansion}} of Chacoan {{influence in the}} Mesa Verde area left its most visible mark {{in the form of}} Chaco-style masonry great houses that became the focal point of many Mesa Verdean villages after 1075. <b>Far</b> <b>View</b> House, the largest of these, is considered a classic Chaco [...] "outlier," [...] on which construction likely began between 1075 and 1125, although some archaeologists argue that it was begun as early as 1020. The era's timber and earth unit pueblos were typically inhabited for about twenty years. During the early 12th century, the locus of regional control shifted away from Chaco to Aztec, New Mexico, in the southern Mesa Verde region. By 1150, drought had once again stressed the region's inhabitants, leading to a temporary cessation of great house construction at Mesa Verde.|$|E

Great gray and black gulls screamed against the jackdaws; the heavy-scented acres of bloom round them were alive with low-nesting birds, singing or silent as the shadow of the {{wheeling}} hawks passed and returned; and on the naked turf across the combe rabbits thumped and frolicked.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{describes}} {{differences in}} {{horizontal and vertical}} disconjugate saccades under <b>far</b> and close <b>viewing</b> conditions of two dichoptically presented aniseikonic random checkerboard patterns. At <b>far</b> <b>viewing,</b> disconjugacy of horizontal saccades requiring divergence was accomplished intrasaccadically after several minutes; for convergence the intrasaccadic disconjugacy was limited. Size differences partially persisted in open-loop trials. At close viewing intrasaccadic divergent changes in conjugacy were instantaneous, but motor storage during open-loop was absent. It is concluded that disconjugate saccades to targets at far distance lead to an adaptation process, whereas at close viewing distance horizontal disparity is a visual compensation process used directly to scale the relative amplitudes of both eyes, not leading to adaptation. The time-course of disconjugate vertical saccades was much slower, with mostly postsaccadic vergence. Nearby viewing enhanced the disconjugacy of vertical saccades...|$|R

40|$|Global shape judgements were {{employed}} to examine the combination of stereopsis and shape-from-texture in the determination of three-dimensional shape. Adding textural variations to stereograms increased perceived depth. Thus, texture was not simply vetoed by the strong stereo cue. In experiments where the depth specified by texture was incongruent with that specified by stereo, the data were well described by a weighted linear combination rule. Although only a small weight was assigned to texture, this weight was somewhat greater at a farther viewing distance. This could be {{a consequence of the}} decreased reliability of stereopsis at <b>far</b> <b>viewing</b> distances.
