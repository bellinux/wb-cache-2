40|$|Nitrophenols {{are present}} in the {{atmospheric}} gas phase and in cloud and rainwater. Their formation via aqueous-phase reactions of phenol with the nitronium ion, NO 2 +, arising from N 2 O 5 and ClNO 2 partitioning into the aqueous phase, has been proposed but not verified experimentally. Here we demonstrate {{for the first time that}} gaseous N 2 O 5 and ClNO 2 partitioning into dilute aqueous solutions of phenol yields 2 - and 4 -nitrophenol (and 4 -nitrosophenol), but no <b>dinitrophenol</b> <b>isomers.</b> The rate of nitration does not vary significantly between 5 and 20 degrees C, presumably because of opposing temperature dependences in Henryâ€™s law partitioning and reaction rate coefficients. The rate coefficient for reaction of NO 2 + with phenol could not be directly quantified but is evidently large enough for this reaction to compete effectively with the reaction between NO 2 + and water and to provide a feasible route to nitrophenol production in the atmosphere...|$|E
