Heavily based on aspects of Japanese popular culture, it {{tells the story of}} a Japanese office worker who aspires to appear on television variety show Kasou Taishou where guests perform silly stunts. He envisions a billiards-based routine, where he and others portray living balls on an enormous pool table. At the beginning of the video, scenes are of his unsupportive environment; his wife is annoyed at him, his manager scolds him for reading a billiards magazine at work, and his coworkers tease him at lunch. At the end of the video however, he and his team perform their routine successfully on the show and win top ranking. The story footage is intercut with fake Japanese-style television commercials where the Pet Shop Boys offer various products such as an automatic <b>ironing</b> <b>machine</b> and a car called Boxy (Nissan Micra).|$|E

The results illustrate that the reliability and efficiency of existing drive system are lower. Therefore, improvement measures are proposed: use high-quality bush roller chain that shall be regularly maintained and changed; the chain drive shall be replaced with gear drive. <b>Ironing</b> <b>machine</b> is a washing machine. The traditional <b>ironing</b> <b>machine</b> is mainly equipped {{with one or two}} rollers; modern <b>ironing</b> <b>machine</b> consists 3 ~ 6 rollers for high efficiency, so which is called multi-roller <b>ironing</b> <b>machine.</b> Chain drive in the machine has simple structure, costs low and is easy to maintain, but gear and chain slippage even chain scission accident can happen after wear [1]. Multi-roller <b>ironing</b> <b>machine</b> is a continuous-working machine, so serious accident due to poor quality can be caused by failure in the drive system.

40|$|The present {{paper is}} focused on the {{analysis}} of a typical small size electric steam generator (3. 45 kWe) installed in machines operating in laundries for ironing activities. A mathematical model has been developed to study the dynamic behavior of the steam generator in different operating conditions, in order to evaluate the main thermodynamic and physical quantities (pressure, temperature, flow rate, etc.) which describe its operation, as a function of time. The mathematical model has been implemented by using the software Matlab/Simulink. The present paper describes both the mathematical model and the simulator, focusing on the analysis of the control system and reporting the most significant results of the study, that has been carried out also taking into account data from experimental tests. The simulator permits to analyze how different ironing cycles influence the water level and the pressure within the steam generator. Furthermore, the analysis aims also to quantify the electricity and water consumptions, for different operating conditions, in order to give some suggestions on how to optimize ironing cycles. For the aforementioned reasons, the simulator can be considered a useful tool for both users and manufacturers that operate in the <b>ironing</b> <b>machine</b> sector...|$|E
40|$|The {{classical}} ironing {{process by}} which walls of cups (or cans, etc.) are thinned is hereby replaced by a new fluid-pressure assisted process. This "hydrostatic ironing process " {{has the advantage of}} providing, under some restrictions, an unlimited amount of wall-thickness reduction. The analysis offered here is intended to explain why and how this can be achieved and to provide guidelines for designing such a process. Essentially, the analysis relates the governing variables of the process (geometrical variables, material variables, operating speed, and various friction parameters) with the applied fluid pressure via lower and upper bounds solutions. Based on these solutions, the technological advantages (and limitations) of this process are shown. Some generality is obtained by allowing the material to behave, not only as ideally perfect, but also as visco-plastic (to simulate warm temperature conditions) and as a power-law hardening material. The dynamic response to high speeds is predicted, showing that operating at high speeds is not recommended if the fluid pressure source is limited in its power. The two bounds of the solution, presented here, are relatively close to each other and coincide at small die angles. They provide, subsequently, a useful engineering tool for predetermining the operating fluid pressure for a given situation. The solutions match satisfactorily preliminary tests generated by a semi-industrial hy-drostatic <b>ironing</b> <b>machine</b> with fluid pressure drive of 600 MPa. Presently, the process proves its capabilities by ironing wall-thickness of steel cups to 60 percent of its initial thickness, at relatively slow speeds (few centimeters per second) ...|$|E
