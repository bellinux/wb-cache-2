The use of multicasting means that interconnections are independent of IP machine addresses.

Such environments combine graphics, haptics, animations and networking to create interactive multimodal worlds that allows participants to collaborate in realtime. Massively Multiplayer Online Gaming (MMOG), perhaps the most widely deployed practical application of distributed virtual environments, allows players to act together concurrently in a virtual world over the Internet. <b>IP</b> <b>Multicasting</b> would be an optimal solution for the dissemination of updates among participants, but <b>IP</b> <b>multicasting</b> is not available to home users on the Internet, due to a number of technological, practical, and business reasons.
