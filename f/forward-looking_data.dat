The Þrst is a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) sensor of acoustically induced soil vibrations {{developed by the}} University of Mississippi. The second is a wideband, forward-looking, synthetic aperture groundpenetrating radar developed by SRI. We demonstrate {{the performance of the}} individual sensors and fusion algorithms over a data set acquired at Yuma Proving Grounds, AZ. During that collection the LDV sensor was operating in a down-looking mode, but its ability to collect <b>forward-looking</b> <b>data</b> has been conÞrmed in other tests. The amount of fusible data available for these sensors is small, which limits the sophistication and performance of fusion algorithms used with these data. We observed that the GPR and LDV sensors are complementary to a degree. The GPR sensor is signiÞcantly better at detecting metal mines, while the LDV sensor is somewhat better at detecting plastic mines. A classical decision-level “OR ” fusion algorithm is shown to be effective for this sensor suite. 1...|$|E
40|$|The most {{difficult}} problem facing monetary policymakers {{results from the}} long and variable lags in monetary policy's impact on the economy. The full effect of an interest rate change today is not realized for several quarters, so monetary policymakers must be forward-looking. Yet, it is difficult enough to interpret how {{the economy is doing}} now, let alone forecast how it will be performing one year hence. This uncertainty hinders the ability of policymakers to offset future fluctuations with current actions. Even so, the lags leave central bankers no choice but to react to their expectations about the future. > This article examines {{the extent to which the}} Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) reacts to <b>forward-looking</b> <b>data.</b> It is shown that the FOMC does look into the future, basing its decisions on expectations about the economy at least as far as a year away.

40|$|Data is {{the lifeblood}} of science. Scientists produce data and analyse data, and service {{providers}} including research infrastructures (and e-infrastructures) provide facilities for data production and/or storage, sharing and reuse. There is increasing pressure for research infrastructures to have a clear, <b>forward-looking</b> <b>data</b> strategy: from funders during the forming process of new research infrastructures, {{as a result of}} technical developments (“explosion” of data coming from new instrumentation), and from the open access/open data movements, where the scientific community, journal publishers, and policymakers push for increasing amounts of data to be made available via various repositories.

In particular, observed disclosures are presented through an original framework that purports to combine strategic and stakeholder reporting. This framework is based on seven perspectives that highlight information addressed to key stakeholders categories and information concerning business effectiveness and efficiency. Finally, an index attempts to measure the disclosure’s quality and it provides a first analysis of differences amongst industries and countries. A limited, but strategic, use of the non-mandatory information seems to influence the observed companies’ disclosure policies. Furthermore, cultural effects are likely to affect forms, quality and types of information released.

40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze {{different}} value drivers and their capability of explaining future stock returns. The value drivers are evaluated based on their performance using backward- and <b>forward-looking</b> <b>data.</b> The forward-looking value drivers are tested both with perfect foresight, i. e. actual future fundamentals, and with analyst forecasts. The main objective is to find the best value drivers that can be used to create automatic stock recommendations based on future forecasts. Finally, the performance of these auto-recommendations is compared against the performance of analysts’ own consensus stock recommendations. DATA In this study, the US stock market data is used as the primary source of data. The data is gathered from Compustat and CRSP databases and it covers years 1975 - 2007. In total, the sample consists of 98, 688 company-year combinations. The average number of stocks in a single year is 2, 990. This data is complemented with equity analyst forecasts and recommendations gathered from I/B/E/S database. RESULTS The main finding of this study is that the P/E ratio and to some extent the PEG ratio are good forward-looking value drivers that provide significant stock screening potential when applied to earnings forecasts of good quality. However, when applying analyst consensus forecasts these value drivers do no result in significantly better performance than using only backward-looking value drivers with historical financial figures. Despite the relatively low performance in absolute terms the auto-recommendations made with the value driver approach outperform significantly the consensus recommendations of the analysts. As a conclusion, investors and analysts would be better off making recommendations based on systematic value drivers rather than the current ad-hoc methods...|$|E

Finally, the optimization objective function is established based on the improved velocity obstacle method, and a UUV motion characteristic {{is used to calculate}} the reachable velocity sets. The optimal collision speed of UUV is searched in velocity space. The corresponding heading and speed commands are calculated, and outputted to the motion control module. The above is the complete dynamic obstacle avoidance process.

The methodology consists of calibrating models to closely replicate Greenbook forecasts, and then applying them to international real-time datasets. The results show that the U. S. output gap series is well described by quadratic detrending, while Greenbook inflation forecasts can be closely replicated using Bayesian model averaging over Autoregressive Distributed Lag models in inflation and the GDP growth rate. German and U. S. Taylor rules are characterized by inflation coefficients increasing with the forecast horizon and a positive output gap response. The U. K. and Canada interest rate reaction functions achieve maximum inflation response at middle-term horizons of about 1 / 2 year and the output gap coefficient enters the reaction functions insignificantly. Estimating the U. K. and Canadian Taylor rules as forward-looking is crucial, as backward-looking specifications produce nonsensical estimates. This is not the case for the U. S. and Germany. ...|$|R

40|$|Under-ice Relative Pose Estimation and Ice Anomaly Mapping with an Unmanned Underwater Vehicle Anthony M. Spears 242 Pages Directed by Ayanna M. Howard Under-ice {{regions in}} both the Arctic and Antarctica are of great {{interest}} to many domains of science including biology, climate science, and planetary science. Great environmental and technical challenges face researchers when attempting to gather data from the polar under-ice regions of Earth for these applications. The harsh environments encountered both above and below the polar ice limit the use of human divers and manned submersibles in such data collection efforts. However, recent technological advances have provided the means for data collection using unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) beneath the ice. New challenges are encountered using this unmanned technology including deployment, recovery, risk mitigation, navigation, and mapping. Presented in this dissertation are methods developed to help aid in navigation and mapping tasks in these under-ice environments. Specifically, development of computer vision methods using acoustic and optical imaging sensors (especially through sensor fusion) is used to help aid in under-ice UUV motion estimation. In addition to algorithms which can aid in the navigation problem, additional computer vision methods for ice texture and ice anomaly mapping are also developed and presented herein. The methods presented here utilize low-cost sensors already onboard many UUV platforms, and do not require expensive external infrastructure or setup effort. First, a relative pose estimation method, used to help track a vehicle's position over a trajectory, is presented using a novel combination of optical flow-based computer vision methods with <b>forward-looking</b> sonar <b>data,</b> assuming a rigid motion model between frames. The use of computer vision techniques with sonar data is uncommon due to the high noise levels from this sensor, as well as the changing appearance of objects between frames. In addition to the use of a sonar sensor to aid in vehicle motion estimation, the use of camera sensors, also commonly onboard UUVs, is presented to provide additional independent relative vehicle pose estimates. While monocular camera relative pose methods are commonly applied in feature-rich environments such as terrestrial urban and underwater coral reef locations, such methods are not common in featureless environments such as that found under the ice. In order to overcome these challenges, a novel adaptation of this approach is presented here using contrast enhancement and low feature detection thresholds, along with robust feature matching to eliminate outliers during motion model estimation. While relative pose estimation using either a sonar or camera sensor provides valuable information for autonomous navigation in a UUV, fusion of these two complementary sensors can result in a much stronger and more robust trajectory estimate. A novel sonar and camera sensor fusion approach is presented here using a factor graph framework to combine estimates from these noisy but partially redundant sensors. In this case, the camera estimates provide additional degrees of motion not possible using a sonar sensor, but the translational camera estimates contain a scale factor ambiguity inherent to the camera sensor. While the sonar estimates are limited to only three degrees of motion, no scale factor ambiguity is encountered, and absolute translational motion can be estimated. Fusion of these two sensors can be used to leverage the strengths of each sensor to overcome the individual weaknesses and provide much more robust overall vehicle motion estimates. Finally, it is not only useful to provide an estimate of the location of a UUV during data collection, but also to automatically estimate ice texture and to flag frames with possible anomalies of interest present against the ice background. This can help aid human vehicle operators and scientists in data collection and post analysis of these large, mostly featureless, datasets. A method for estimating ice texture using point features is presented here, along with point feature- and hue-based methods for anomaly detection and mapping. Methods such as those developed in this dissertation can help aid vehicle operators and scientists in the difficult tasks of navigation and mapping for under-ice exploration, and can eventually provide an autonomous means for such data collection. The algorithms developed here can further the mission capabilities of current under-ice vehicle platforms to enable further exploration of these remote areas of the planet. Ph. D...|$|R
