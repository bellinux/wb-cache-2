40|$|Objective. This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine whether there is rapid solvent accessibility to the active site in the enzyme myeloperoxidase and whether these effects are dependent upon pH and ligand binding near the heme. Background. The enzyme myeloperoxidase, which is found in mammalian neutrophils, plays an important beneficial role in phagocytosis because of its antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities. These activities proceed via peroxidation of chloride ion to <b>hypochlorite,</b> <b>chlorination</b> of amino acids by hypochlorite, and by decarboxylation of the resulting amino acid chloramines. Deleterious effects in human cardiovascular disease have also been attributed to chlorotyrosine, nitrotyrosine, and tyrosyl radical products which can be generated by myeloperoxidase reactions. The kinetics and mechanisms of some of these reactions have been clarified although not all details of the reaction mechanisms are known. Methods. In this study, solvent proton spin relaxation enhancement properties of the enzyme solutions are explored as a means of probing accessibility of the heme site. Longitudinal (spin-lattice) relaxation times were measured for the enzyme solutions under various conditions. Conclusion. The heme site is accessible, and there is solvent exchange with water bound near the heme iron. The solvent proton relaxation rate depends upon electronic state of the heme iron, exchange rate of bulk solvent with that bound near the heme, temperature, magnetic resonance frequency, pH and chloride concentratio...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Preparing of cool wool from {{coarse wool}} fiber is a {{feasible}} and effective method. The preparation principle, process and properties of cool wool fiber was studied during chlorination treatment with sodium <b>hypochlorite.</b> The optimum <b>chlorination</b> treatment process was as follows: concentration of sodium hypochlorite at 4 g/L, concentration of sulphuric acid at 20 g/L, time 15 min, temperature 20 ℃ to 25 ℃, ratio {{of water and}} wool fiber was 50 : 1. Compared with original wool fiber，the surface of cool wool only retained scales roots and the cuticle becomes thinner. Handle, softness, whiteness, luster and the anti-shrinkage properties were improved, the breaking strength is decreased about 5 % to 8 %...|$|R
40|$|Almost {{a billion}} persons lack access to {{improved}} drinking water, and diarrheal diseases cause an estimated 1. 87 million deaths per year. Sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC) tablets are widely recommended for household water treatment to reduce diarrhea. Because NaDCC is directly added to untreated water sources, concerns {{have been raised}} about the potential health impact of disinfection by-products. This study investigated trihalomethane (THM) production in water from six sources used for drinking (0. 6 – 888. 5 nephelometric turbidity units) near Arusha, Tanzania. No sample collected at 1, 8, and 24 hours after NaDCC addition exceeded the World Health Organization guideline values for either individual or total THMs. Ceramic filtration, sand filtration, cloth filtration, and settling and decanting were not effective mitigation strategies to reduce THM formation. Chlorine residual and THM formation {{were not significantly different}} in NaDCC and sodium <b>hypochlorite</b> treatment. Household <b>chlorination</b> of turbid and non-turbid waters did not create THM concentrations that exceeded health risk guidelines...|$|R
