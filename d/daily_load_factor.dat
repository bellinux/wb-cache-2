40|$|An {{effective}} forecasting {{model for}} short-term load plays {{a significant role}} in promoting the management efficiency of an electric power system. This paper proposes a new forecasting model based on the improved neural networks with random weights (INNRW). The key is to introduce a weighting technique to the inputs of the model and use a novel neural network to forecast the <b>daily</b> maximum <b>load.</b> Eight <b>factors</b> are selected as the inputs. A mutual information weighting algorithm is then used to allocate different weights to the inputs. The neural networks with random weights and kernels (KNNRW) is applied to approximate the nonlinear function between the selected inputs and the <b>daily</b> maximum <b>load</b> due to the fast learning speed and good generalization performance. In the application of the <b>daily</b> <b>load</b> in Dalian, the result of the proposed INNRW is compared with several previously developed forecasting models.

40|$|Successful {{cogeneration}} {{system performance}} depends critically upon the correct estimation of load variation and {{the accuracy of}} demand prediction. We need not only aggregated annual heat and electricity demands, but also hourly and monthly patterns in order to evaluate a cogeneration system's performance by computer simulation. These data are usually obtained from the actual measurements of energy demand in existing buildings. However, it is extremely expensive to collect actual energy demand data and store it {{over a long period}} for many buildings. Here we face the question of whether it is really necessary to survey hourly demands. This paper provides a sensitivity analysis of the influence of demand-prediction error upon the efficiency of cogeneration systems, so as to evaluate the relative importance of various demand components. These components are annual energy demand, annual heat-to-electricity ratio, <b>daily</b> <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> and so forth. Our approach employs the concept of information theory to construct a mathematical model. This analysis provides an indication of the relative importances of demand indices, and identifies what may become a good measure for assessing the efficiency of the cogeneration system for planning purposes. ...|$|E
40|$|Electrical load {{management}} {{is used to}} reduce peak electrical demand from two or more electrical loads. The success of on-farm electrical {{load management}} depends on its technical feasibility and its potential for reducing peak demand without disrupting critical farm opertions. ^ A computer simulation model was developed for studying potential on-farm electrical load management systems. The model was used for fine tuning parameters and for comparing alternative strategies. ^ Model inputs included the frequency and duration of all simulated farm operations. Model output consisted of the daily electrical demand profile for the farm and the operation history for each electrical load. ^ A load management system was developed for the feed processing and grain handling loads at a University farm near Mead, Nebraska. Field experiments demonstrated the technical feasibility of a computer-based load management system and provided data for validating the model. Simulations of the University farm system using input data from the field experiments were used to fine tune electrical load management parameters and logic. Sensitivity analyses showed that success of the electrical load management system depended on careful selection of parameters used in sophisticated load priority schemes. ^ Statistical distributions governing the behavior of each load at the feed and grain center were used for obtaining random samples of service and interarrival times in stochastic simulation experiments. These experiments tested the effects of five demand setpoints (12 to 24 kW) at three levels of task frequency. Experiments were performed both with and without the generation of miscellaneous, uncontrolled electrical loads. Simulation results indicated several tradeoffs when selecting an electrical demand setpoint. Low setpoints improved <b>daily</b> <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> with greater peak reductions but also increased the risk of not satisfactorily completing all farm tasks. ^ The approach used in evaluating on-farm electrical load management systems was illustrated. Several simulations of a potential load management system at a commercial grain and livestock farm were conducted for a typical high demand day. ...|$|E
