5|$|While {{trying to}} close the doors, the player must avoid certain hazards. Mario will lose a life if <b>he</b> <b>touches</b> an enemy, runs out of time, runs {{off the edge of}} the floor he is on, or if all the doors are open. Enemies in the game are mostly regular Mario series creatures, such as Goombas, Koopas, Boos and their variations. The {{opponent}} on the last stage of each hotel is one of the Koopalings, who each use different methods to attack Mario.|$|E

The game contains 100 missions (including boss battles) {{over the course of}} eight levels. New missions, cutscenes, and sometimes new levels are unlocked by completing missions. Successful missions earn Sonic experience points, which advance him levels.|$|E
5|$|Midas is a verse {{drama in}} blank verse by the Romantic writers Mary Shelley and Percy Bysshe Shelley. Mary wrote the drama and Percy contributed two lyric poems to it. Written in 1820 while the Shelleys {{were living in}} Italy, Mary Shelley tried unsuccessfully to have the play {{published}} by children's magazines in England in the 1830s; however, it was not published until A. Koszul's 1922 scholarly edition. Whether or not the drama was ever meant to be staged {{is a point of}} debate among scholars. The play combines the stories of the musical contest between Apollo and Pan and that of King Midas and his ability to turn everything <b>he</b> <b>touches</b> to gold.|$|E

5|$|Bart and Milhouse {{convince}} Comic Book Guy {{to publish}} a comic book he wrote titled Everyman, in which the title character can absorb superpowers from the characters of comic book <b>he</b> <b>touches.</b> The comic becomes an instant hit, and many Hollywood studios become interested in making it into a movie. Comic Book Guy agrees to let Everyman become a movie, but only if he can pick the star. When Comic Book Guy sees Homer, he considers Homer perfect for the role, as he wants Everyman to be played by a middle-aged fat man. But the studio executives realize that audiences want a physically fit actor for the role, so they hire celebrity fitness trainer Lyle McCarthy to get Homer into shape. After a month, Homer becomes fit and the movie begins production.|$|E
5|$|Bruce is {{kept under}} {{observation}} at a secret desert base, while Talbot intends to weaponize the Hulk's powers. David tries to recreate Bruce's failed experiment, {{but instead of}} turning into another Hulk he finds himself able to absorb any material <b>he</b> <b>touches</b> or energy to which he is exposed. He hands himself over to the military after telling Betty that he had murdered his wife {{in front of the}} child Bruce. Bruce has a nightmare about the event, leading to a more powerful transformation of the Hulk.

5|$|Nine power-ups each supply Mario with {{a special}} costume that grants him {{temporary}} abilities. For example, special mushrooms bestow the player with a Bee, Boo, or Spring Suit. The Bee Suit allows Mario to temporarily hover through the air, climb special walls, and walk on clouds and flowers; the Boo Suit allows him to float through the air, as well as become transparent and move through certain obstacles; and the Spring Suit allows him to jump to high areas that would be otherwise inaccessible, yet lowering his mobility. The recurring Fire Flower allows Mario to throw fireballs at enemies, and the newly introduced Ice Flower allows Mario to create hexagonal tiles of ice to cover any liquid surface he walks on. The Rainbow Star grants Mario invincibility, allowing him to destroy any enemies that <b>he</b> <b>touches,</b> {{as well as being}} able to run faster.|$|E

He {{commands}} the Knights, instead, to kill him and end his suffering and the shame he has brought on the Knighthood. At this moment, Parsifal steps forth and says that only one weapon can heal the wound (""). <b>He</b> <b>touches</b> Amfortas' side with the Spear and both heals and absolves him.

5|$|Ripley deciphers {{part of the}} transmission, {{determining}} it's not a distress signal, but {{a warning}} of some kind. In the spacecraft, Kane discovers a chamber containing hundreds of large egg-like objects. When <b>he</b> <b>touches</b> one, it opens and a creature springs out and attaches to his face through the facemask of his spacesuit. Dallas and Lambert carry the unconscious Kane back to the Nostromo. As acting senior officer, Ripley refuses to let them aboard, citing quarantine regulations, but Ash ignores Ripley and lets them in. The crew unsuccessfully attempt to remove the creature from Kane's face, discovering that its blood is an extremely corrosive acid. It later detaches on its own and is found dead. The ship is partly repaired, and the crew lifts off. Kane awakens with some memory loss but otherwise unharmed. During a final crew meal before returning to stasis, he chokes and convulses in pain then dies as a small alien creature bursts from his chest and escapes into the ship. The crew attempts to locate it with a tracking device and capture or kill it with nets, electric prods and flamethrowers.|$|E

25|$|The Devil loves ice cream, but cannot eat it, as it melts {{as soon as}} <b>he</b> <b>touches</b> it. This doesn't {{happen on}} his own volition, but was {{apparently}} a curse given upon him by God shortly before he was cast out of Heaven, knowing how much he loves ice cream. It is later revealed that the devil opposes anthropogenic global warming as anyone who dies of it would be considered an innocent and not be sent to hell.|$|E

25|$|After {{the loss}} of his left hand, Aquaman {{initially}} replaced it with a cybernetic retractable hook, then a cybernetic hand. The mechanical hand was replaced by a magical hand made out of water, given to him by the Lady of the Lake, which grants Aquaman numerous abilities, including, but not limited to, the ability to dehydrate anyone <b>he</b> <b>touches</b> and kill them instantly, the ability to shoot jets of water from his hand, scalding or freezing, healing abilities, the ability to create portals into mystical dimensions acting as spontaneous transport, the ability to control almost any body of water he sets his focuses on and the ability to communicate with the Lady of the Lake through the waterbearer hand. His biological hand was restored when the character was resurrected in Blackest Night #8.|$|E
25|$|The devil, {{dressed in}} a monk's habit and with fearsome teeth, holds out some stones {{in his left hand}} and a globe in his right hand. He teases Jesus asking him to turn the stones into bread and telling Jesus, with {{reference}} to the globe, that he could be the ruler of the entire world if he chose to be so. Between the devil and the second image of Jesus we see Jesus wearing the crown of thorns, his hands bound and held by a soldier. He is appearing before Pontius Pilate who is seated and wears a turban. <b>He</b> <b>touches</b> his thumb with his left index finger to show that he is speaking. Then we see a second image of Jesus but without the crown of thorns. To understand this scene it is best to see the image of the devil and the image of Christ without the crown of thorns as apparitions and speaking across Pontius and that group.|$|E
25|$|Male {{courtship}} {{display is}} similar to that of P. apacheanus, P. clarus, or P. octopunctatus. The male begins his display by holding the carapace very high, shifting the abdomen to one side, and raising the first pair of legs. In this position, he moves before the female, stopping after each few steps. The male advances in a zig-zag pathway, shifting his abdomen to the other side at the end of each oblique approach. Throughout, the dancing male flicks his forelegs up and down, holding them wide apart at first and bringing them closer and closer together as he nears the female. Then, with forelegs held almost parallel before him, <b>he</b> <b>touches</b> the female cautiously once or twice. If the female remains still at this stage, the male climbs over her, and uses the forelegs to help turn her abdomen to the side. When the genital pore, which lies on the ventral abdomen, is thus exposed, the male inserts his palpus. After 2-3 min., the male withdraws this pedipalp, turns the female's abdomen in the other direction, and inserts the other pedipalp.|$|E
