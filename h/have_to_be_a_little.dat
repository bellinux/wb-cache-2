500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] segment {{published}} by HBO {{shortly after the}} airing of the episode, Benioff spoke {{about the relationship between}} Sansa Stark and Jon Snow {{at this point in the}} season, saying [...] "Over the course of this season they've come to really rely upon each other, but she doesn't really trust him completely. She didn't tell him about the meeting with Littlefinger, she didn't tell him that she summoned the Knights of the Vale, there's definitely a little hint of conflict there. So I think there's a little bit of anger about that and a little bit of jealousy, and that relationship will be crucial to watch." [...] Benioff continued by referencing the declaration of Jon Snow as King of the North, noting [...] "We see the second 'King in the North!' scene with Jon and I think it was important to us that it evoked in that first 'King in the North!' scene. Very different circumstances, different environment. In some ways, the evocation of the first one is meant to be a little worrisome because it was a very triumphant moment when Robb is named King in the North but it didn't go so well for the previous King in the North. So I think we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> worried for Jon and at the same time it's a pretty big reversal and, you know, for a character who was dead at the beginning of the season to be declared king at the end of it.

60|$|The {{delicate}} tunic {{lining the}} sack, (a mere duplicature of that thick one, forming {{the outside of}} the capitulum, and generally transformed into valves,) and the integuments of the whole body, are regularly moulted. With these integuments, the membrane lining the oesophagus, the rectum, and the deep olfactory pouches, and the horny apodemes of the maxillæ, are all cast together. I have seen a specimen of Lepas, in which, from some morbid adhesion, the old membrane lining one of the olfactory pouches had not been moulted, but remained projecting from the orifice as a brown shrivelled scroll. The new spines on the cirri (and on the maxillæ) are formed within the old ones; but as they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> longer than the latter, and as they cannot enter these up to their very points, their basal portions are not thus included, but are formed, running obliquely across the segments of the cirri; and what is curious, these same basal portions are turned inside out, like the fingers of a glove when hastily drawn off. After the exuviation of the old spines, the new spines have their inverted basal portions drawn out from within the segments, and turned outside in, so as to assume their proper positions.|$|E

40|$|A famous theorem due to Nash ([1]) assures {{that every}} Riemannian {{manifold}} can be embedded isometrically into some Euclidean space E n. An interesting {{question is whether}} for a complete manifold M {{we can find a}} closed isometric embedding. This note gives the affirmative answer to this question asked to the author by Paolo Piccione. In his famous 1956 article John Nash proved that every Riemannian metric on an n-dimensional manifold M can be constructed as a pullback metric for an embedding of M into some Euclidean space. He gave also an estimate of the smallest possible dimension N of the Euclidean space as N = 1 2 · n · (n + 1) · (3 n + 11). Now one can try to find some stronger derivates of this theorem if strengthening the assumptions. In this note, we want to examine the question whether every complete manifold admits a closed isometric embedding. Although folk wisdom apparently has a positive answer to this question already, there {{does not seem to be}} any proof in the literature up to now. The question is more difficult than it might seem at first sight as there are plenty of non-closed isometric embeddings of complete manifols, e. g. spirals converging to 0 or to a circle as isometric embeddings of R. For a Lipschitz function f on a metric space M, we denote by L(f) : = sup { |f(p) −f(q) d(p,q) p, q ∈ M, p = q} its Lipschitz number. We will need the following nice theorem from [2] about approximation of Lipschitz functions by smooth functions (even on infinite-dimensional Riemannian manifolds) : Theorem 0. 1 Let (M, g) be a separable Riemannian manifold, let f: M → R be a Lipschitz function, let ρ: M → (0, ∞) be a continuous function, and let r> 0. Then there is a C ∞ and Lipschitz function g: M → R with |f(p) − g(p) | ≤ ρ(p) for every p ∈ M, and L(g) ≤ L(f) + r. Now let us state and prove our theorem. The basic idea of the proof is to look at balls of increasing radius and to define an imbedding which lifts the larger and larger balls into an additional direction thereby resolving a possible spiralling. As the distance itself is not differentiable in general, we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit more careful and thus we will need the theorem above. Theorem 0. 2 If (M, g) is a complete n-dimensional Riemannian manifold, then there is a closed isometric C∞-embedding of (M, g) into EN+ 1, where N: =...|$|E
