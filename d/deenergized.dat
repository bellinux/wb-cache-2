The delta pH and delta psi were determined from the transmembrane equilibration of radiolabeled benzoate and tetraphenylphosphonium ions, respectively. Growth conditions of S. mutants Ingbritt were chosen so that the cells had a low apparent phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) -dependent glucose:phosphotransferase activity. Cells energized under different conditions produced transmembrane proton potentials ranging from - 49 to - 103 mV but did not accumulate 6 -deoxyglucose intracellularly. An artificial transmembrane proton potential was generated in <b>deenergized</b> cells by creating a delta psi with a valinomycin-induced K+ diffusion potential and a delta pH by rapid acidification of the medium. Artificial transmembrane proton potentials up to - 83 mV, although producing proton influx, could not accumulate 6 -deoxyglucose in <b>deenergized</b> cells or 2 -deoxyglucose or thiomethylgalactoside in <b>deenergized,</b> PEP-depleted cells. The transmembrane diffusion of glucose in PEP-depleted, KF-treated cells did not exhibit saturation kinetics or competitive inhibition by 6 -deoxyglucose or 2 -deoxyglucose, indicating that diffusion was not facilitated by a membrane carrier.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{influence}} of pH on opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) in both <b>deenergized</b> and energized mitochondria {{in the presence of}} Pi. In <b>deenergized</b> mitochondria from rat brain and heart, we observed the expected inhibition of Ca 2 +-induced PTP opening at increasingly acidic pH values. Unexpectedly, mitochondria energized with either electron transport complex I or complex II substrates displayed the opposite behavior, acidic pH promoting rather than inhibiting PTP opening. We show that the potentiating effect of acidic pH is due to an increased rate of Pi uptake. The data also revealed that brain mitochondria are more heterogeneous than heart or liver mitochondria in relation to onset of a permeability transition, and that this heterogeneity depends on their Pi transport capacity. Taken together, these results indicate that the inhibitory effects of acidic pH on the PTP may be overcome in situ by an increased rate of Pi uptake, and that ischemic and postischemic acidosis may worsen rather than relieve PTP-dependent tissue damage...|$|E

For this purpose the cells had to be <b>deenergized</b> first. Conventional deenergization procedures caused irreversible loss of motility, presumably due to ATP-dependent degradative processes. However, E. coli cells <b>deenergized</b> by incubation with arsenate manifested a slow, reversible depletion of PMF. In this procedure there was a sufficiently long time window, during which a considerable proportion of the cells lost their motility and could be made to rotate again by an artificially-imposed PMF. The motors of these cells rotated in response to any PMF polarity, but positive and negative polarities rotated different sub-populations of cells and the direction was almost exclusively counterclockwise. The reason for the unidirectionality of the rotation was not the intervention of the chemotaxis system. A number of potential reasons are suggested. One is the arsenate effect on the motor function found previously [Margolin, Y., Barak, R. and Eisenbach, M. (1994) J. Bacteriol. 176, 5547 – 5549].

40|$|Multiuser {{transmission}} {{methods for}} {{digital subscriber line}} (DSL) systems have become of interest {{with the potential for}} increased data rate and loop reach. These methods often assume that the set of crosstalk interferers, called the crosstalk profile, and their associated channel responses are known. For DSL systems, the interferers are often uncoordinated, so that in a dynamic environment where DSL transmitters can energize and <b>deenergize,</b> the crosstalk profile cannot be transmitted to the user of interest. While the crosstalk channel estimation problem in a dynamic environment can be intractable for general transmission systems, channel and crosstalk analysis can make use of the specific DSL environment. Namely, the physical channels in a DSL system do not change rapidly, and hence estimates of the crosstalk channel can be saved for future reference. For this reason, we introduce the concept of a channel profile. We develop several algorithms to detect the crosstalk profile and investigate the asymptotic behavior of the new algorithms.

40|$|AbstractReactive {{oxygen species}} (ROS: {{superoxide}} radical, O 2 −; hydrogen peroxide, H 2 O 2; hydroxyl radical, OH), which {{arise from the}} univalent reduction of dioxygen are formed in mitochondria. We summarize here results which indicate that ROS, and also the radical nitrogen monoxide (‘nitric oxide’, NO), act as physiological modulators of some mitochondrial functions, but may also damage mitochondria. Hydrogen peroxide, which originates in mitochondria predominantly from the dismutation of superoxide, causes oxidation of mitochondrial pyridine nucleotides and thereby stimulates a specific Ca 2 + release from intact mitochondria. This release is prevented by cyclosporin A (CSA). Hydrogen peroxide thus contributes {{to the maintenance of}} cellular Ca 2 + homeostasis. A stimulation of mitochondrial ROS production followed by an enhanced Ca 2 + release and re-uptake (Ca 2 + ‘cycling’) by mitochondria causes apoptosis and necrosis, and contributes to hypoxia/reperfusion injury. These kinds of cell injury can be attenuated at the mitochondrial level by CSA. When ROS are produced in excessive amounts in mitochondria nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids are extensively modified by oxidation. Physiological (sub-micromolar) concentrations of NO potently and reversibly <b>deenergize</b> mitochondria at oxygen tensions that prevail in cells by transiently binding to cytochrome oxidase. This is paralleled by mitochondrial Ca 2 + release and uptake. Higher NO concentrations or prolonged exposure of cells to NO causes their death.

40|$|Treatment of rat liver {{mitochondria}} {{with aluminum}} {{in the presence}} of Ca(2 +) results in large amplitude swelling accompanied by loss of endogenous Mg(2 +) and K(+) and oxidation of endogenous pyridine nucleotides. The presence of cyclosporin A, ADP, bongkrekic acid, N-ethylmaleimide and dithioerythritol prevent these effects, indicating that binding of aluminum to the inner mitochondrial membrane, most likely at the level of adenine nucleotide translocase, correlates with the induction of the membrane permeability transition (MPT). Indeed, aluminum binding promotes such a perturbation at the level of ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase, which favors the production of reactive oxygen species. These metabolites generate an oxidative stress involving two previously defined sites in equilibrium with the glutathione and pyridine nucleotides pools, the levels of which correlate with the increase in MPT induction. Although the above-described phenomena are typical of MPT, they are not paralleled by other events normally observed in response to treatment with inducers of MPT (e. g., phosphate), such as the collapse of the electrochemical gradient and the release of accumulated Ca(2 +) and oxidized pyridine nucleotides. Biochemical and ultrastructural observations demonstrate that aluminum induces a pore opening having a conformation intermediate between fully open and closed in a subpopulation of mitochondria. While inorganic phosphate enhances the MPT induced by ruthenium red plus a <b>deenergizing</b> agent, aluminum instead inhibits this phenomenon. This finding suggests the presence of a distinct binding site for aluminum differing from that involved in MPT induction...|$|R

However, <b>deenergized</b> cells which were treated with valinomycin, loaded with potassium, and diluted into sodium or sodium plus potassium to create an artificial electrical gradient (ΔΨ) plus a chemical gradient of sodium (ΔpNa) or ΔpNa alone transported glucose at a rapid rate. Cells which were loaded with potassium plus sodium and diluted into sodium (ΔΨ with sodium, but no ΔpNa) also took up glucose at a rapid rate. Potassium-loaded cells that were diluted into buffers which did not contain sodium (ΔΨ without sodium) could not take up glucose. An artificial ZΔpH which was created by acetate diffusion could not drive glucose transport even if sodium was present.

Succinate was only utilized after growth on lactate had ceased. Although nonenergized and glucose-energized cells had similar proton motive forces and ATP levels, glucose-energized cells were unable to transport succinate.

Since cells which were <b>deenergized</b> with 2 -deoxyglucose or iodoacetate did not transport succinate, it appeared that glycogen metabolism was providing the driving force for succinate uptake. An artificial delta pH drove succinate transport in <b>deenergized</b> cells, but an artificial membrane potential (delta psi) could not serve as a driving force. Because succinate is nearly fully dissociated at pH 7. 0 and the transport process was electroneutral, it appeared that succinate was taken up in symport with two protons.

40|$|In This Chapter [Measuring the gas {{emission}} from the coal Methane {{at the top}} of the silo Methane at the load-out area and Actions taken after a silo explosion] Methane accumulations in coal silos have resulted in the occasional silo explosion. These can be quite violent and dangerous because coal dust adds to the strength of the blast. However, with the appropriate precautionary measures, methane accumulations in silos can be greatly reduced. Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) regulations at 30 CFR 2 77. 201 require that the methane content in the air of any coal silo be maintained below 1. 0 vol %. 3 Also, MSHA requires that methane tests be conducted before any electrical equipment is energized, unless a continuous monitor capable of <b>deenergizing</b> the electrical equipment is used. 4 Measuring the {{gas emission}} from the coal. The first necessary step in dealing with silo methane issues is to measure the gas emission from the coal going into the silo. Such measure-ments allow one to estimate the silo ventilation needs and permit a comparison with the methane controls used at other mines that have similar gas levels. The gassiness of the coal can be measured by taking conveyor belt grab samples. 5 Matta et al. [1978] measured the gas emission from conveyor belt grab samples using a simple desorption test. To conduct the test, they collected several grab samples of coal, weighing a few pounds each, from the conveyor belt entering the silo. 6 They then sealed the coal into an airtight sample container that was equipped with a valve and short hose along with a pressure gauge. Every few hours they opened the valve and bled the emitted gas into a water-filled graduated cylinder that had been inverted and placed in a pan of water (Figure 11 - 1). The results are shown in Figure 11 - 2...|$|R
50|$|To {{extend a}} DC motor’s service life, {{protective}} devices and motor controllers {{are used to}} protect it from mechanical damage, excessive moisture, high dielectric stress and high temperature or thermal overloading. These protective devices sense motor fault conditions and either annunciate an alarm to notify the operator or automatically de-energize the motor when a faulty condition occurs. For overloaded conditions, motors are protected with thermal overload relays. Bi-metal thermal overload protectors are embedded in the motor's windings and made from two dissimilar metals. They are designed such that the bimetallic strips will bend in opposite directions when a temperature set point is reached to open the control circuit and de-energize the motor. Heaters are external thermal overload protectors connected in series with the motor’s windings and mounted in the motor contactor. Solder pot heaters melt in an overload condition, which cause the motor control circuit to de-energize the motor. Bimetallic heaters function the same way as embedded bimetallic protectors. Fuses and circuit breakers are overcurrent or short circuit protectors. Ground fault relays also provide overcurrent protection. They monitor the electric current between the motor’s windings and earth system ground. In motor-generators, reverse current relays prevent the battery from discharging and motorizing the generator. Since D.C. motor field loss can cause a hazardous runaway or overspeed condition, loss of field relays are connected in parallel with the motor’s field to sense field current. When the field current decreases below a set point, the relay will <b>deenergize</b> the motor’s armature. A locked rotor condition prevents a motor from accelerating after its starting sequence has been initiated. Distance relays protect motors from locked-rotor faults. Undervoltage motor protection is typically incorporated into motor controllers or starters. In addition, motors can be protected from overvoltages or surges with isolation transformers, power conditioning equipment, MOVs, arresters and harmonic filters. Environmental conditions, such as dust, explosive vapors, water, and high ambient temperatures, can adversely affect the operation of a DC motor. To protect a motor from these environmental conditions, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) have standardized motor enclosure designs based upon the environmental protection they provide from contaminants. Modern software can also be used in the design stage, such as Motor-CAD, to help increase the thermal efficiency of a motor.|$|R
