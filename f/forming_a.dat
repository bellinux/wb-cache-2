5|$|Some animals {{including}} cephalopods like squid {{are able}} to vary their colours rapidly for both camouflage and signalling. The mechanisms include reversible proteins which can be switched between two configurations. The configuration of reflectin proteins in chromatophore cells in {{the skin of the}} Doryteuthis pealeii squid is controlled by electric charge. When charge is absent, the proteins stack together tightly, <b>forming</b> <b>a</b> thin, more reflective layer; when charge is present, the molecules stack more loosely, <b>forming</b> <b>a</b> thicker layer. Since chromatophores contain multiple reflectin layers, the switch changes the layer spacing and hence the colour of light that is reflected.|$|E
