5|$|A {{missense}} mutation R174Q, a nonsense mutation R156X, and three single residue deletions DE167, DK175 and DK176, {{all in the}} C-terminal actin-tropomyosin interacting domain, {{have been found in}} patients with <b>distal</b> arthrogryposis.|$|E
5|$|Imaging {{tests of}} the veins {{are used in the}} {{diagnosis}} of DVT, most commonly either proximal compression ultrasound or whole-leg ultrasound. Each technique has drawbacks: a single proximal scan may miss a <b>distal</b> DVT, while whole-leg scanning can lead to <b>distal</b> DVT overtreatment. Doppler ultrasound, CT scan venography, MRI venography, or MRI of the thrombus are also possibilities.|$|E
5|$|Nasodigitoacoustic {{syndrome}} {{is similar to}} several syndromes that share its features. Brachydactyly of the <b>distal</b> phalanges, sensorineural deafness and pulmonary stenosis are common with Keutel syndrome. In Muenke syndrome, developmental delay, <b>distal</b> brachydactyly and sensorineural hearing loss are reported; features of Teunissen-Cremers syndrome include nasal aberrations and broadness of the thumbs and big toes, also with brachydactyly. Broad thumbs and big toes are primary characteristics of Rubinstein syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Several {{anomalies}} {{affecting the}} digits (fingers and toes) {{have been observed}} with the syndrome. A broadening of the thumbs and big toes (halluces) was reported in two brothers. The broadening was apparent in all <b>distal</b> phalanges of the fingers, although the pinkies were unaffected yet appeared to be clinodactylic (warped, or bent toward the other fingers). Additional eports described this broadness of the thumbs and big toes, with brachydactyly (shortness) in the <b>distal</b> phalanges of the other digits except the pinkies in affected individuals. On X-rays of a two-year-old boy with the disorder, the brachydactyly was shown {{to be caused by}} shortening of epiphyses (joint-ends) of the <b>distal</b> phalanges. The broadness and brachydactyly of the big toes in particular may give them a stunted, rounded and stub-like appearance.|$|E
5|$|The median plates (m, m') {{are also}} sclerites {{that are not}} so {{definitely}} differentiated as specific plates as are the three principal axillaries, but nevertheless they are important elements of the flexor apparatus. They lie in the median area of the wing base <b>distal</b> to {{the second and third}} axillaries and are separated from each other by an oblique line (bf) which forms a prominent convex fold during flexion of the wing. The proximal plate (m) is usually attached to the <b>distal</b> arm of the third axillary and perhaps should be regarded {{as a part of the}} latter. The <b>distal</b> plate (m') is less constantly present as a distinct sclerite and may be represented by a general sclerotization of the base of the mediocubital field of the wing. When the veins of this region are distinct at their bases, they are associated with the outer median plate.|$|E
5|$|The next year, Luo {{and colleagues}} {{published}} {{a more thorough}} analysis confirming their previous conclusion and adding the Cretaceous Australian Bishops to Australosphenida. They mentioned {{the condition of the}} hypoconulid, which is inclined forward, rather than backward as in boreosphenidans, as an additional australosphenidan character and noted that Ausktribosphenos and monotremes were united, to the exclusion of Ambondro, by the presence of a V-shaped notch in the <b>distal</b> metacristid. In the same year, Asfaltomylos was described from the Jurassic of Argentina as another australosphenidan. In contrast to Ambondro, this animal lacked a <b>distal</b> metacristid and did not have as well-developed a lingual cingulum.|$|E
5|$|A scapula (shoulder blade), only {{tentatively}} {{assigned to}} Plesiorycteropus, has the acromion, a process, present, but {{the structure is}} probably not as large as in aardvarks or armadillos. Six humeri have been found; the bone is robust and an entepicondylar foramen {{is present in the}} <b>distal</b> (far) end. There are three examples of the radius, a compact and massive bone in Plesiorycteropus which resembles the pangolin radius. The three known ulnae show that the olecranon process at the proximal (near) end is well-developed, but the <b>distal</b> end is narrow; the morphology of the bone suggests that the animal was capable of producing much force with its arms.|$|E
5|$|A single large wing from {{a species}} of Diptera in the Triassic (10mm instead of usual 2–6mm) was found in Australia (Mt. Crosby).This family Tilliardipteridae, despite of the {{numerous}} 'tipuloid' features, {{should be included in}} Psychodomorpha sensu Hennig on account of loss of the convex <b>distal</b> 1A reaching wing margin and formation of the anal loop.|$|E
5|$|Air {{that passes}} through the phonic lips passes into the <b>distal</b> sac, then back down through the left nasal passage. This {{recycling}} of air allows the whale to continuously generate clicks {{for as long as}} it is submerged.|$|E
5|$|Comparison of {{high-resolution}} images {{obtained by}} the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has shown a contemporary crater-production rate significantly higher than previously estimated. A secondary cratering process caused by <b>distal</b> ejecta is thought to churn the top two centimetres of regolith a hundred times more quickly than previous models suggestedon a timescale of 81,000 years.|$|E
5|$|If {{granulation}} tissue grows over the injured site, {{it can cause}} stenosis of the airway, after a week to a month. The {{granulation tissue}} must be surgically excised. Delayed diagnosis of a bronchial rupture increases risk of infection and lengthens hospital stay. People with a narrowed airway may suffer dyspnea, coughing, wheezing, respiratory tract infection, and difficulty with clearing secretions. If the bronchiole is completely obstructed, atelectasis occurs: the alveoli of the lung collapse. Lung tissue <b>distal</b> to a completely obstructed bronchiole often does not become infected. Because {{it is filled with}} mucus, this tissue remains functional. When the secretions are removed, the affected portion of the lung is commonly able to function almost normally. However, infection is common in lungs <b>distal</b> to a partially obstructed bronchiole. Infected lung tissue <b>distal</b> to a stricture can be damaged, and wheezing and coughing may develop due to the narrowing. In addition to pneumonia, the stenosis may cause bronchiectasis, in which bronchi are dilated, to develop. Even after an airway with a stricture is restored to normal, the resulting loss of lung function may be permanent.|$|E
5|$|It {{should be}} noted that convergency is {{considered}} responsible for uniquely tetrapod features found also in other non-elpistostegalian fish from the period like Sauripterus (finger-like jointed <b>distal</b> radial bones) or Tarrasius (tetrapod-like spine with 5 axial regions).|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{features}} found in sauropods that basal sauropodomorphs lack {{are related to the}} change in body size. The greatest regions affected by this are the hind limbs and pelvis. For example, an elongating of the ilium, size reduction of the lesser trochanter shelf, and semiplantigrade posture are some features that indicate the amount and positioning of leg muscles being modified. Vulcanodon possessed these features, the latter of which is seen earliest in it. However, Vulcanodon does not have reduced <b>distal</b> phalanges, which are seen in Shunosaurus and all more derived sauropods. This means that while the muscle positioning of its legs were changing, they had not yet reduced in the <b>distal</b> region of the limb.|$|E
5|$|Personal pronouns {{exist for}} the first and second person, while the old demonstrative pronouns have come to form third person (proximal and <b>distal)</b> pronouns. Other word (sub-)classes include {{interrogative}} pronouns, conjunctions (which take participles), spatials, and particles, the last being rather numerous.|$|E
5|$|Relatively few boletes have an apical pore at the <b>distal</b> end {{of their}} basidiospores. The dark reddish-brown, smooth spores of Porphyrellus amylosporus are {{truncate}} with a thin-walled depression. Some species of Heimioporus have spores with apical pores, but molecular analyses demonstrate that Heimioporus is only distantly related to Spongiforma.|$|E
5|$|The {{constellation}} of anomalies seen with Nasodigitoacoustic syndrome {{result in a}} distinct diagnosis. The diagnostic criteria for the disorder are broad <b>distal</b> phalanges of the thumbs and big toes, accompanied by a broad and shortened nose, sensorineural hearing loss and developmental delay, with predominant occurrence in males.|$|E
5|$|The floral tube {{is formed}} by fusion of the basal {{segments}} of the tepals (proximally connate). Its shape is from an inverted cone (obconic) to funnel-shaped (funneliform) or cylindrical, and is surmounted by the more <b>distal</b> corona. Floral tubes can range from long and narrow in sections Apodanthi and Jonquilla to rudimentary (N. cavanillesii).|$|E
5|$|The holotype FMNH PR1821 is {{the only}} fully {{described}} specimen of Cryolophosaurus. The specimen consists of an incomplete skull and mandibles lacking most of their front half; nine maxillary teeth; a fragmentary sixth cervical centrum; cervical vertebrae 7-10; several posterior cervical ribs; several anterior dorsal vertebrae; most mid and posterior dorsal vertebrae; several dorsal ribs; the fifth sacral vertebrae; three chevrons; many partial and complete caudal vertebrae and centra; two partial humeri; a proximal radius; a proximal ulna; a partial ilium; a proximal pubis; both ischia, but only one distal; two incomplete femora; the <b>distal</b> end of a tibia; the <b>distal</b> end of a fibula, and the astragalus and calcaneum. In 2013, new material of Cryolophosaurus was unearthed in Antarctica. The description of this material {{has not yet been}} published in a non-abstract form.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of subcutaneous emphysema {{in a person}} who appears quite ill and febrile after bout of vomiting followed by left chest pain is very suggestive of the diagnosis of Boerhaave's syndrome, which is a life-threatening emergency caused by rupture of the <b>distal</b> esophagus.|$|E
5|$|The {{skeleton}} of the kakapo differs from other parrots in several features associated with flightlessness. Firstly, {{it has the}} smallest relative wing size of any parrot. Its wing feathers are shorter, more rounded, less asymmetrical, and have fewer <b>distal</b> barbules to lock the feathers together. The sternum is small and has a low, vestigial keel and a shortened spina externa. As in other flightless birds and some flighted parrots, the furcula is not fused but consists {{of a pair of}} clavicles lying in contact with each coracoid. As in other flightless birds, the angle between the coracoid and sternum is enlarged. The kakapo has a larger pelvis than other parrots. The proximal bones of the leg and arm are disproportionately long and the <b>distal</b> elements are disproportionately short.|$|E
5|$|This set of {{characters}} was identified by Le Loeuff in {{his description of}} Ampelosaurus to distinguish it from all other genera: teeth that weakly spatulate; a laterally widening <b>distal</b> extremity of neural spines on the dorsal vertebrae; neural arch of the dorsal vertebrae inclining strongly towards the rear; {{the lack of a}} <b>distal</b> expansion on the scapular blade; the presence of a light, ventral crest on top of the scapula; the presence of plate, bulb, and spine shaped osteoderms; and, in 2005, Le Loeuff added that the constriction of the neural spine on the dorsal and cervical vertebrae was also probably a characteristic of Ampelosaurus.|$|E
25|$|<b>Distal</b> RTA (dRTA) is the {{classical}} form of RTA, {{being the first}} described. <b>Distal</b> RTA {{is characterized by a}} failure of H+ secretion into lumen of nephron by the alpha intercalated cells of the medullary collecting duct of the <b>distal</b> nephron.|$|E
25|$|Freeman–Sheldon {{syndrome}} {{is a type}} of <b>distal</b> arthrogryposis, related to <b>distal</b> arthrogryposis type 1 (DA1). In 1996, more strict criteria for the diagnosis of Freeman–Sheldon syndrome were drawn up, assigning Freeman–Sheldon syndrome as <b>distal</b> arthrogryposis type 2A (DA2A).|$|E
25|$|Certain {{suspected}} conditions require specific projections. For example, skeletal {{signs of}} rickets are seen predominantly at sites of rapid growth, including the proximal humerus, <b>distal</b> radius, <b>distal</b> femur {{and both the}} proximal and the <b>distal</b> tibia. Therefore, a skeletal survey for rickets can be accomplished with anteroposterior radiographs of the knees, wrists, and ankles.|$|E
25|$|In humans, the <b>distal</b> pads are {{wider than}} in other {{primates}} because the soft tissues of the finger tip are attached to a horseshoe-shaped edge on the underlying bone, and, in the grasping hand, the <b>distal</b> pads can therefore conform to uneven surfaces while pressure is distributed more evenly in the finger tips. The <b>distal</b> pad of the human thumb is divided into a proximal and a <b>distal</b> compartment, the former more deformable than the latter, which allows the thumb pad to mold around an object.|$|E
25|$|In March 2006, Stevenson et al. {{published}} strict {{diagnostic criteria}} for <b>distal</b> arthrogryposis type 2A (DA2A) or Freeman–Sheldon syndrome. These included {{two or more}} features of <b>distal</b> arthrogryposis: microstomia, whistling-face, nasolabial creases, and 'H-shaped' chin dimple.|$|E
25|$|A healthy {{fingernail}} has {{the function}} of protecting the <b>distal</b> phalanx, the fingertip, and the surrounding soft tissues from injuries. It also serves to enhance precise delicate movements of the <b>distal</b> digits through counter-pressure exerted on the pulp of the finger.|$|E
25|$|The {{arterial}} cone {{is closed}} by the infundibular cushions. The trunk cones are closed by the forming of an infundibulotroncal septum, {{which is made}} from a straight proximal portion and <b>distal</b> spiral portion. Then, the narrowest portion of the aorta is in the left and dorsal portion. The <b>distal</b> portion of the aorta is pushed forward to the right. The proximal pulmonary artery is right and ventral, and the <b>distal</b> portion of the pulmonary artery is in the left dorsal portion.|$|E
25|$|The left radius {{is damaged}} at its {{proximal}} and <b>distal</b> ends. The radius is gracile, with a midshaft width to length ratio of 0.12. In anterior view, the lateral {{face of the}} shaft is straight, whereas the medial face is concave. The anteroposteriorly expanded proximal end has a prominent ridge on its lateral face. The proximal end has an approximately oval outline with a pointed anterior process and broadly rounded posterior process. The proximomedial margin is nearly straight, whereas the proximolateral margin is concave anteriorly and convex posteriorly. The oval cross-section of the upper shaft gradually transforms into a rounded D-shape at mid-shaft, with the long axis of the cross section extending transversely. This ‘D’ shape becomes more anteriorly compressed towards the <b>distal</b> end, with a transversely rounded anterior face and increasingly flattened posterior face. This {{is associated with the}} strong transverse expansion of the <b>distal</b> shaft and <b>distal</b> end of the bone, as originally described as a twisting of the bone. Strong transverse expansion of the <b>distal</b> radius is normally found only in titanosaurs (e.g., Alamosaurus and Jainosaurus) and is considered a local autapomorphy of Huabeisaurus. Posterolateral ridges are weak to absent along the <b>distal</b> half of the bone and do not extend further proximally.|$|E
25|$|The {{major cause}} for <b>distal</b> tubal {{occlusion}} is {{pelvic inflammatory disease}} (PID), usually {{as a consequence of}} an ascending infection by chlamydia or gonorrhea. However, not all pelvic infections will cause <b>distal</b> tubal occlusion. Tubal tuberculosis is an uncommon cause of hydrosalpinx formation.|$|E
25|$|Fascicle ends {{nearest the}} deep MG {{aponeurosis}} (Achilles tendon) showed {{an increase in}} strain from the proximal to <b>distal</b> portions of the MG muscle. The converse {{was seen in the}} fascicle ends adjacent to the superficial aponeurosis, which decreased in fiber strain from proximal to <b>distal</b> portions of the MG muscle. These trends may have been due to changes in CSA of the muscle at the proximal and <b>distal</b> ends of the MG, resulting in regions of high stress and strain concentration.|$|E
25|$|During {{the phases}} of halokinesis, dated to the Albian to Paleocene, several {{areas of the}} now deep water <b>distal</b> part of the Santos Basin were exposed to subaerial {{conditions}} and suffered erosion. The <b>distal</b> parts of the basin were affected by E-W to NW-SE oriented shortening, sub-perpendicular to the Brazilian margin.|$|E
25|$|Minority status {{leads to}} {{increased}} exposure to <b>distal</b> stressors.|$|E
25|$|Freeman–Sheldon {{syndrome}} (FSS), also termed <b>distal</b> arthrogryposis type 2A (DA2A), craniocarpotarsal dysplasia (or dystrophy), Cranio-carpo-tarsal syndrome, Windmill-Vane-Hand syndrome, or Whistling-face syndrome, {{was originally}} described by Freeman and Sheldon in 1938. Freeman–Sheldon syndrome {{is a rare}} form of multiple congenital contracture (MCC) syndromes (arthrogryposes) and is the most severe form of <b>distal</b> arthrogryposis (DA).|$|E

25|$|Neck: It is the {{smallest}} part (0.03 ×10−6 m), and has a proximal and <b>distal</b> centriole. The proximal centriole enters into the egg during fertilisation and starts the first cleavage division of the egg, which has no centriole. The <b>distal</b> centriole gives rise to axial filament which forms the tail and has (9+2) arrangement. A transitory membrane called Manchette lies in middle piece.|$|E
