25|$|The Hattersley 6 x 1 {{revolving}} skip box: {{this dress}} goods loom, {{used for the}} weaving of suiting fabrics etc., is fitted with a negative V or angle dobby, a development of the original invented by Hattersley's in 1867. Known throughout the textile industry as the <b>Keighley</b> <b>dobby,</b> it has since been copied, modified and manufactured {{in a variety of}} different forms. Hattersley also invented, in 1868, the skip box: a development of the circular or revolving box. This allowed the shuttle box to bypass or skip the next compartment along and pick out the shuttle of the following one.|$|E
25|$|The Sowden worsted coating loom: {{as in all}} {{mechanical}} devices, {{there is}} drive to improve efficiency, and this loom has several patent innovations. For example, the 28 shaft negative square dobby is similar in construction to Hattersley's <b>Keighley</b> <b>dobby.</b> However, to allow the shuttle more time {{to pass through the}} shed the dobby has special curved slots that allow the shafts to dwell or remain open for longer. In addition, the pattern chain or lags controlling the shafts can be set to control all 28 shafts, or set to operate the first sixteen shafts to weave the cloth and the remaining twelve shafts to produce a name list or selvedge. The word selvedge is derived from self-edge, the edge of the cloth where the weft is turned back as it returns through the shed. The selvedge would often have a brand name or the country of origin woven into it. On {{the left side of the}} loom is the patent four-shuttle drop box motion incorporating a foot pedal. This is part of an escape mechanism in case the shuttle becomes trapped.|$|E
