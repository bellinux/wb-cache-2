2500|$|The Multiverse {{hypothesis}} proposes {{the existence}} of many universes with different physical constants, {{some of which are}} hospitable to intelligent life (see [...] ). Because we are intelligent beings, it is unsurprising that we <b>find</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hospitable universe {{if there is such a}} multiverse. The Multiverse hypothesis is therefore thought to provide an elegant explanation of the finding that we exist despite the required fine-tuning. (See [...] for a detailed discussion of the arguments for and against this suggested explanation.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Stephen Hawking, {{along with}} Thomas Hertog of CERN, {{proposed}} that the Universe's initial conditions consisted of a superposition of many possible initial conditions, {{only a small fraction}} of which contributed to the conditions we see today. According to their theory, it is inevitable that we find our Universe's [...] "fine-tuned" [...] physical constants, as the current Universe [...] "selects" [...] only those past histories that led to the present conditions. In this way, top-down cosmology provides an anthropic explanation for why we <b>find</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> universe that allows matter and life, without invoking the ontic existence of the Multiverse.|$|E

[...] Peter Travers, writing for Rolling Stone, commended the film's musical segments, particularly Bret McKenzie's [...] "Man or Muppet". The Boston Globe also gave it {{three out of four}} stars and said, [...] "The result is refreshing on every level, a piece of nostalgia so old it's new again, and a breather from Hollywood's 3-D digital onslaught in favor of fur and fuzz." [...] Christopher Kelly of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram stated that the film was [...] "much more than just an affectionate reimagining of familiar Muppets routines, [...] is rooted in real emotions and characters," [...] and that [...] "they remain as committed as ever to doing what Muppets do best: putting on a grand show." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{three great}} results of {{psychological}} observation are Sensibility, Activity or Liberty, and Reason. [...] These three facts {{are different in}} character, but are not found apart in consciousness. Sensations, or {{the facts of the}} sensibility, are necessary. The facts of reason are also necessary, and reason is no less independent of the will than the sensibility. Voluntary facts alone have the characters of imputability and personality. The will alone is the person or Me. The me is the centre of the intellectual sphere without which consciousness is impossible. We <b>find</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> strange world, between two orders of phenomena which do not belong to us, which we apprehend only on the condition of our distinguishing ourselves from them. Further, we apprehend by means of a light which does not come from ourselves. All light comes from the reason, and it is the reason which apprehends both itself and the sensibility which envelops it, and the will which it obliges but does not constrain. Consciousness, then, is composed of these three integrant and inseparable elements. But Reason is the immediate ground of knowledge and of consciousness itself.|$|E

60|$|There was the {{hot flash}} of a pistol from the keyhole, and a bullet smacked {{against the wall}} between us. We hurled {{ourselves}} against the door. It was massive, but rotten with age.

60|$|We passed on, to <b>find</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> narrow passage, and, {{leaving the}} eunuch to bar the door, {{advanced}} till {{we came to}} a curtain.

The house, with its many quaint windows, across which evergreens spread their open fingers as a child makes believe to shroud his eyes, has a {{literary}} look--at least, so it seems to me, but perhaps this is because I know the authoress who is at this moment advancing down the walk to meet me.|$|R

Today - {{at a time when}} modernity has become a "reflexive modernity" for some, whilst for others it is already over (and for others still "we have never been modern") - it seems that Berman has grasped an important concept: a part of media narration is characterised by a fluctuation between euphoria and fear, triumphalism and rejection, as regards science and technology as well as other areas (the ambivalence of the "Frankenstein effect" discussed by Jon Turney) ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was clear}} {{now that the}} ape-men had in some way marked us down, {{and that we were}} watched on every side. We had not so much to fear from them during the day, but they would be very likely to rush us by night; so the sooner we got away from their {{neighborhood}} the better. On three sides of us was absolute forest, and there we might <b>find</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> ambush. But on the fourth side--that which sloped down {{in the direction of the}} lake--there was only low scrub, with scattered trees and occasional open glades. It was, in fact, the route which I had myself taken in my solitary journey, and it led us straight for the Indian caves. This then must for every reason be our road.|$|R
60|$|Yva {{shook her}} head at him and smiled again. Then she motioned {{to all of us}} to stand close to her, and, stooping, lifted Tommy in her arms.

60|$|A {{glance at}} {{the map of the}} Union will show how very widely our smaller {{literary}} centres are scattered; and perhaps it will be useful in following me to other more populous literary centres. Dropping southward from New York, now, we <b>find</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> literary centre of importance at Philadelphia, since that is the home of Mr. J. B. McMasters, the historian of the American people; of Mr. Owen Wister, whose fresh and vigorous work I have mentioned; and of Dr. Weir Mitchell, a novelist of power long known to the better public, and now recognized by the larger in the immense success of his historical romance, Hugh Wynne.|$|E
60|$|Returning now to {{the problem}} of a priori knowledge, which we left unsolved when we began the {{consideration}} of universals, we <b>find</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> position to deal with it in a much more satisfactory manner than was possible before. Let us revert to the proposition 'two and two are four'. It is fairly obvious, in view of what has been said, that this proposition states a relation between the universal 'two' and the universal 'four'. This suggests a proposition which we shall now endeavour to establish: namely, All a priori knowledge deals exclusively with the relations of universals. This proposition is of great importance, and goes a long way towards solving our previous difficulties concerning a priori knowledge.|$|E

60|$|A {{quarter of}} a mile or so from the gate we came to an inner enclosure, that {{answered}} to the South African cattle kraal, surrounded by a dry ditch and a timber palisade outside of which was planted a green fence of some shrub with long white thorns. Here we passed through more gates, to <b>find</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> oval space, perhaps five acres in extent. Evidently this served as a market ground, but all around it were open sheds where hundreds of horses were stabled. No cattle seemed to be kept there, except a few that with sheep and goats were driven in every day for slaughter purposes at a shambles at the north end, from the great stock kraals built beyond the forest to the south, where they were safe from possible raiding by the White Kendah.|$|R

Indeed, we travellers often <b>find</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> serious dilemma. If we do not draw our landscapes somewhat in pre-Raphaelite fashion, they do not impress the reader; if we do, critics tell us that they are wearisome longueurs, and that the half {{would be better than}} the whole.

Of course they desire to have as much detail about it as possible; hence the reader will probably pardon my 'curiosity.' ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We <b>find</b> <b>ourselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> {{extended}} era of entropy production. Unlike {{most other}} observations, the arrow {{of time is}} usually regarded as a constraint on initial con-ditions. I argue, however, that it primarily constrains the vacuum structure of the theory. I exhibit simple scalar field potentials in which low-entropy initial conditions are not necessary, or not sufficient, for an arrow of time to arise. I argue that the string theory landscape gives rise to an arrow of time independently of the initial entropy, assuming a plausible condition on the lifetime of its metastable vacua. The dynamical resolution of the arrow of time problem arises from the same structural properties of the string landscape that allow it to solve the cosmological constant problem without pro-ducing an empty universe, particularly its high dimensionality and the large difference in vacuum energy between neighboring vacua. ar X i...|$|R
