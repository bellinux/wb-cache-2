40|$|Synchronous languages, such as Signal, {{are best}} suited {{for the design of}} {{dependable}} real-time systems. Synchronous languages enable a very high-level specification and an extremely modular implementation of complex systems by structurally decomposing them into elementary synchronous processes. Separate compilation in reactive languages is however made a difficult issue by global safety requirements. To enable separate compilation of the functional components of reactive systems while preserving their global integrity, we introduce a module system for Signal. Just as data-types describe the invariants of program modules in functional languages, temporal and data-flow invariants <b>interface</b> <b>Signal</b> processes to their environment. In conventional languages, typing is the medium allowing the separate compilation of functions in a program. In Signal, the notion of conditional data-flow graph can similarly be used for separately compiling reactive processes and for assembling them in complex systems.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this work}} the wavy {{interface}} of stratified oil–water flows was investigated using wire conductance probes. The experiments {{were carried out}} in a 38 mm ID acrylic pipe using water and oil (Exxsol D 140 oil: ρo= 830 kgm− 3, μo= 0. 0055 kgm− 1 s− 1) as test fluids. High-speed imaging revealed that almost two-dimensional interfacial waves develop at the inlet junction for input oil-to-water flow rate ratios different from one. Downstream the inlet section, however, the interface has a complex three dimensional structure with very small amplitude contributions. The structure of such interfaces can be properly investigated from the power spectrum of the conductance probe signal. A rigorous and detailed methodology is presented for estimating the power spectrum of the <b>interface</b> <b>signal</b> {{that is based on}} the Wiener–Khinchine theorem and makes extensive use of a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. Interface spectra were studied at two locations, close to the inlet of the test section and at 7 m downstream. The results showed that the waves at the inlet have a unique peak frequency of about 19 Hz and that, at the downstream location, this frequency is still present but has a smaller significance compared to that caused by the mechanical vibrations of the set up. This frequency was independent of the flow rates and could be a characteristic of the pair of the test fluids used rather than of the flow...|$|E

The goal {{of this study was}} to quantitatively evaluate the performance and learning characteristics of EMG-, force- and hand joystick-based interfaces. The human operator abilities were assessed in 8 healthy subjects using a screen-based one-dimensional position-tracking task, where the <b>interface</b> <b>signal</b> was mapped to the velocity of the cursor and the target was moving according to a multi-sine signal with a flat velocity spectrum. The performance of the control interfaces was evaluated in terms of tracking error, human-operator bandwidth, information transmission rate and effort. Results showed significant differences between the control interfaces in all the performance descriptors: the joystick-based interface presented significantly higher tracking error compared to EMG- (p< 0. 001) and force-based (p< 0. 005) interfaces; the EMG-based control interface showed a significantly higher bandwidth (p< 0. 001) than the force- and the joystick-based interfaces; the force- and joystick-based interfaces provided significantly higher information transmission rates (p< 0. 001) than the EMG-based interface; the force-based interface presented significantly lower effort than EMG- (p< 0. 001) and joystick-based (p< 0. 005) interfaces. None of the evaluated interfaces was superior in all four performance descriptors, but the force-based interface presented more positive results than the EMG- and joystick-based interfaces.

40|$|Background: The {{performance}} {{capabilities and}} limitations of control interfaces for the operation of active movement-assistive devices remain unclear. Selecting an optimal interface for an application requires {{a thorough understanding of}} the performance of multiple control interfaces. Methods: In this study the performance of EMG-, force- and joystick-based control interfaces were assessed in healthy volunteers with a screen-based one-dimensional position-tracking task. The participants had to track a target that was moving according to a multisine signal with a bandwidth of 3 Hz. The velocity of the cursor was proportional to the <b>interface</b> <b>signal.</b> The performance of the control interfaces were evaluated in terms of tracking error, gain margin crossover frequency, information transmission rate and effort. Results: None of the evaluated interfaces was superior in all four performance descriptors. The EMG-based interface was superior in tracking error and gain margin crossover frequency compared to the force- and the joystick-based interfaces. The force-based interface provided higher information transmission rate and lower effort than the EMG-based interface. The joystick-based interface did not present any significant difference with the force-based interface for any of the four performance descriptors. We found that significant differences in terms of tracking error and information transmission rate were present beyond 0. 9 and 1. 4 Hz respectively. Conclusions: Despite the fact that the EMG-based interface is far from the natural way of interacting with the environment, while the force-based interface is closer, the EMG-based interface presented very similar and for some descriptors even a better performance than the force-based interface for frequencies below 1. 4 Hz. The classical joystick presented a similar performance to the force-based interface and holds the advantage of being a well established interface for the control of many assistive devices. From these findings we concluded that all the control interfaces considered in this study can be regarded as a candidate interface for the control of an active arm support.
