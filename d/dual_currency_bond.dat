40|$|Many {{official}} {{groups have}} endorsed the wider use by emerging market borrowers of contract clauses which {{allow for a}} qualified majority of bondholders to restructure repayment terms {{in the event of}} financial distress. Some have argued that such clauses will be associated with moral hazard and increased borrowing costs. This paper addresses this question empirically using primary and secondary market yields and finds no evidence that the presence of collective action clauses increases yields for either higher- or lower-rated issuers. By implication, the perceived benefits from easier restructuring are at least as large as any costs from increased moral hazard.

We consider several market frictions that can explain this borrowing behaviour, focussing on potential differences in the market access of two natural counterparties to a swap: residents issuing foreign <b>currency</b> <b>bonds</b> and non-residents issuing local <b>currency</b> <b>bonds.</b> Based on a sample of 13 Asia-Pacific countries, we find that the characteristics of foreign <b>currency</b> <b>bonds</b> issued by residents and local <b>currency</b> <b>bonds</b> issued by non-residents differ in ways that are consistent with these issuers overcoming market limitations and arbitraging cost differentials.

40|$|In our {{paper we}} present how the Hungarian {{credit default swap}} (CDS) market functions, and {{indicate}} {{its position in the}} global credit derivatives markets. Our primary goals are to glean some information from the CDS spreads about Hungary’s credit risk, and to determine the role of the Hungarian sovereign CDS market in different market periods, as well as its long-term relationship with other Hungarian financial markets. Our findings suggest that the Hungarian market has low liquidity compared to the average liquidity of credit derivatives markets. However, relative to the outstanding stock of Hungarian sovereign foreign <b>currency</b> <b>bonds,</b> the daily average turnover of the market and the outstanding stock of Hungarian sovereign CDS contracts at the end of 2007 were substantial, estimated to be around EUR 10 - 20 million and EUR 7 - 20 billion respectively. Even though the Hungarian sovereign CDS spread and foreign <b>currency</b> <b>bond</b> credit spread tend to move in tandem in the long run, the two rates may temporarily deviate from one another due to micro structural factors. Hungary’s credit risk premium is primarily defined in the Hungarian sovereign CDS market, which means that any new information pertaining to Hungary’s credit risk is captured in the CDS spreads first. In contrast, the Hungarian foreign <b>currency</b> <b>bond</b> market is not an effective market, given that foreign <b>currency</b> <b>bond</b> credit spreads merely adjust to the changes of CDS spreads afterwards.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, local {{currency}} emerging market (EM) debt {{has been developing}} to become an attractive and complementary investment category as many EM countries have been successful to reduce currency mismatches and maturity problems by implementing sound fiscal and monetary policies. Analyzing the period from 2002 to July 2009, we show that the local currency EM debt investments provide significant additional alpha and diversification to traditional bond portfolios. In particular, first, EM local <b>currency</b> <b>bond</b> returns are less correlated to the US stock market, treasury and high-yield bond markets, and global risk premia compared to the a case of EM equity and US dollar-denominated bond markets. Second, yields and excess returns on local currency debt depend largely on expected depreciation of the exchange rate against US dollar, while excess returns on dollar-denominated EM debt {{are for the most}} part compensation for bearing the global risk. Third, EM sovereign local <b>currency</b> <b>bond</b> returns beat other emerging and mature market asset classes by providing higher risk adjusted excess returns and diversification.
