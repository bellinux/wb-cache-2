40|$|Bridging fault {{extraction}} {{and analysis}} {{are crucial to}} deriving high quality bridging fault test generation. As state-of-the-art designs integrate millions of logic gates into a VLSI circuit, a run-time and memory efficient bridging fault extraction approach must be developed {{to cope with the}} design complexity. In this paper, a hierarchical bridging <b>fault</b> <b>analyzer</b> - FAULTAN is described. In FAULTAN, the design hierarchy is followed while performing fault extraction resulting in both computation time and memory savings compared to the traditional flat approach. As part of the hierarchical extraction strategy, a cell fault library is built a priori to help accelerate the bridging fault extraction process. Through the fully hierarchical extraction techniques, FAULTAN achieves on the average 5 times speedup and 1 / 10 memory usage as compared with an existing flat fault extractor. The superior accuracy of FAULTAN is also demonstrated in this paper. 1 Introduction As state-of-the-art designs [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The pace of {{progress}} {{in the design of}} integrated circuits continues to amaze observers inside and outside of the industry. Three decades ago, a 50 transistor chip was a technological wonder. Fifteen year later, a 5000 transistor device would 'wow' the crowds. Today, 50, 000 transistor chips will earn a 'not too bad' assessment, but it takes 500, 000 to really leave an impression. In 1975 a typical ASIC device had 1000 transistors, took one year to first samples (and two years to production) and sold for about 5 cents per transistor. Today's 50, 000 transistor gate array takes about 4 months from spec to silicon, works the first time, and sells for about 0. 02 cents per transistor. Fifteen years ago, the single most laborious and error prone step in IC design was the physical layout. Today, most IC's never see the hand of a layout designer: and automatic place and route tool converts the engineer's computer captured schematic to a complete physical design using a gate array or a library of standard cells also created by software rather than by designers. CAD has also been a generous benefactor to the digital design process. The architect of today's digital systems creates the design using an RTL or other high level simulator. Then the designer pushes a button to invoke the logic synthesizer-optimizer tool. A <b>fault</b> <b>analyzer</b> checks the result for testability and suggests where scan based cells will improve test coverage. One obstinate holdout amidst this parade {{of progress}} is the automation of analog design and its reduction to semi-custom techniques. This paper investigates the application of CAD techniques to analog design...|$|E
40|$|Abstractâ€”An {{electric}} power system includes a generating, a transmission, a distribution, and consumers subsystems. An electrical power network in Tanzania keeps growing larger by the day and become more complex so that, most utilities have long wished for real-time monitoring and remote control of electrical power system elements such as substations, intelligent devices, power lines, capacitor banks, feeder switches, <b>fault</b> <b>analyzers</b> and other physical facilities. In this paper, the concept of automation of management of power systems from generation level to end user levels wa...|$|R
40|$|Operating {{processing}} plants is inherently risky due to potential abnormal situations caused by equipment or sensor failures {{or out of}} control process conditions. When serious single or multiple simultaneous faults occur, this situation can directly lead to accidents, releases and injuries. Process <b>Fault</b> <b>Analyzers</b> are computer programs that continuously monitor process sensor data to determine the current operating status of those sensors and the underlying process. Any faults or failures so determined are presented to the process operators in real-time {{in order to maximize}} the time available to effectively respond to those problems. If no problems are discovered those sensor measurements are classified as validated. The fuzzy logic based real-time diagnostic method described here is called the Method of Minimal Evidence. It uses first principle or statistical models, correlations and experiential heuristics to define relationships between particular measured sensor data and assumed unmeasured process variables that describe normal process operation. It continuously evaluates those relationships with real time data to determine which clos...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{gives an}} {{in-depth}} survey about some {{free and open}} source tools for Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), {{which is one of}} the most used techniques in safety and reliability engineering. We have carried out a comparative study for four different tools. Firstly, OpenFTA is an open source fault tree analysis which is based on XFTA calculation engine. Secondly, OpenAltaRica platform which is a free tool that analyzes the risk of complex systems. Thirdly, ALD <b>Fault</b> Tree <b>Analyzer</b> which is a free web-based tool that analyzes static fault trees. Finally, DFTCalc which is an open source tool that analyzes dynamic fault trees based on Stochastic Model Checking techniques. To compare these tools, three representative examples are used. The first one, modeled by OpenFTA and ALD <b>Fault</b> Tree <b>Analyzer,</b> is an Electro Mechanical Actuator (EMA) used to actuate the ailerons of an aircraft, with a static fault tree containing AND gates representing redundancy mechanism. The second, modeled by DFTCalc, is a remotely controlled lawnmower with a dynamic fault tree. The third, modeled by OpenAltaRica, is an example of fault tree generation from AltaRica code. In addition, the same example of EMA system has also been modeled by Isograph Fault Tree++ in order to compare free and open source tools with some commercial tools...|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} about fault {{detection}} and isolation problems for controlled dynamic systems. The sampled dynamic systems are mostly considered. Sensor fault detection {{is a typical}} example. The thesis defines the basic notions and discusses various problems formulations {{with respect to their}} technical appropriateness. It suggests to define an fault detection algorithm as an optimal control problem. In this formulation the detector can control a plant via alarm signals. The detector should emit alarms to maximize the average return gained by the plant per unit time. This is a non-standard formulation. The thesis shows that the optimal detection of the time of change of a noise power observed through a dynamic filter cannot be done recursively but it can be done via a to and fro filtering process. It is a difference from the similar static problem which can be solved via the CUSUM recursive algorithm. The thesis focuses on problems when using the CUSUM algorithm on general dynamic systems is not correct. The ideas are demonstrated with several examples and one industrial application - flue gas <b>analyzers</b> <b>fault</b> detection in a power plant. Except of solved problems and ready-to-use algorithms the work also presents several unfinished conceptional ideas for future research work.
