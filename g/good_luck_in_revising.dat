40|$|The {{current study}} is the first attempt to examine the {{association}} between the Dark Triad of personality (i. e., Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy) and corruption through a mediator – belief <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>luck.</b> Based on Ajzen’s theory of planned behavior, we assumed that individuals with Dark Triad {{would be more likely}} to engage in corruption as a result of belief <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>luck.</b> <b>In</b> Study 1, a set of hypothetical scenarios was used to assess the bribe-offering intention and the corresponding belief <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>luck.</b> Results indicated that while the Dark Triad of personality positively predicted bribe-offering intention, it was mediated by the belief <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>luck</b> <b>in</b> bribe-offering. In Study 2, we presented participants with some hypothetical scenarios of bribe-taking and the corresponding belief <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>luck.</b> Findings revealed that the Dark Triad of personality was positively related to bribe-taking intention; the relationship between narcissism and bribe-taking intention, and that between psychopathy and bribe-taking intention was mediated by the belief <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>luck</b> <b>in</b> penalty-avoidance. However, this belief <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>luck</b> did not mediate the relationship between Machiavellianism and bribe-taking intention. These results hold while controlling for demographic variables, dispositional optimism, and self-efficacy. Taken together, this study extended previous research by providing evidence that belief <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>luck</b> may be one of the reasons explaining why people with Dark Triad are more likely to engage in corruption regardless of the potential outcomes. Theoretical and practical implications were discussed...|$|R
