5|$|Hepatitis C {{is caused}} by an RNA virus. In 80% of people {{infected}}, the disease is chronic, and without treatment, they are infected {{for the remainder of}} their lives. However, there is now an effective treatment that uses the nucleoside analogue drug ribavirin combined with interferon. The treatment of chronic carriers of the <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>virus</b> by using a similar strategy using lamivudine has been developed.|$|E
5|$|Some viruses {{can cause}} lifelong or chronic infections where the viruses {{continue}} to reproduce {{in the body}} despite the host's defence mechanisms.

5|$|Co-evolution {{hypothesis}} : This is {{also called}} the virus-first hypothesis and proposes that viruses may have evolved from complex molecules of protein and nucleic acid {{at the same time}} as cells first appeared on Earth and would have been dependent on cellular life for billions of years. Viroids are molecules of RNA that are not classified as viruses because they lack a protein coat. However, they have characteristics that are common to several viruses and are often called subviral agents. Viroids are important pathogens of plants. They do not code for proteins but interact with the host cell and use the host machinery for their replication. The hepatitis delta virus of humans has an RNA genome similar to viroids but has a protein coat derived from <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>virus</b> and cannot produce one of its own. It is, therefore, a defective virus. Although hepatitis delta virus genome may replicate independently once inside a host cell, it requires the help of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>virus</b> to provide a protein coat so that it can be transmitted to new cells. In similar manner, the sputnik virophage is dependent on mimivirus, which infects the protozoan Acanthamoeba castellanii. These viruses, which are dependent on the presence of other virus species in the host cell, are called satellites and may represent evolutionary intermediates of viroids and viruses.|$|E
5|$|Hepatitis C {{is caused}} by an RNA virus. In 80% of people infected, the disease becomes chronic, and they remain {{infectious}} {{for the rest of}} their lives unless they are treated. There is an effective treatment that uses the nucleoside analogue drug ribavirin combined with interferon. Treatments for chronic carriers of the <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>virus</b> by a similar strategy using lamivudine and other anti-viral drugs have been developed. In both diseases, the drugs stop the virus from reproducing and the interferon kills any remaining infected cells.|$|E
5|$|Viral {{epidemiology}} is {{the branch}} of medical science that deals with the transmission and control of virus infections in humans. Transmission of viruses can be vertical, which means from mother to child, or horizontal, which means from person to person. Examples of vertical transmission include <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>virus</b> and HIV, where the baby is born already infected with the virus. Another, more rare, example is the varicella zoster virus, which, although causing relatively mild infections in humans, can be fatal to the foetus and newborn baby.|$|E

30|$|Only {{eight women}} out of one hundred {{diagnosed}} with ovarian epithelial cancers, which progressed to the clinical stage IV, survive 10  years. First line therapies: surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy inflict very serious iatrogenic consequences. Passive immunotherapy of ovarian cancers offers only low efficacy. Prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines for ovarian cancers are not available. Interestingly, prophylactic vaccines for <b>Hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>Viruses</b> (HBV) are very effective.|$|R
5|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years, the {{development}} of antiviral drugs has increased rapidly, mainly driven by the AIDS pandemic. Antiviral drugs are often nucleoside analogues, which are molecules very similar, but not identical to DNA building blocks. When the replication of virus DNA begins, some of these fake building blocks are incorporated. As soon as that happens, replication stops prematurely—the fake building blocks lack the essential features that allow the addition of further building blocks. Thus, DNA production is halted, and the virus can no longer reproduce. Examples of nucleoside analogues are aciclovir for herpes virus infections and lamivudine for HIV and <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>virus</b> infections. Aciclovir {{is one of the}} oldest and most frequently prescribed antiviral drugs.|$|E
5|$|The {{essential}} oil has displayed antimicrobial properties in vitro, and can {{function as a}} biopesticide, especially regarding Tropidion castaneum beetles and Camponotus maculatus carpenter ants. Several terpenoids isolated from P.atriplicifolia have been investigated for potential inhibitory effects on the <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>virus.</b> Its traditional use as an anti-inflammatory {{has been attributed to}} the ability of the lignan (+)-taxiresinol and five other compounds to act as leukotriene antagonists. The isorinic acid derivative perovskoate may also contribute to an anti-inflammatory effect as an arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor. Interaction with opioid and cannabinoid receptors has been proposed as the mechanism of traditionally reported analgesic effects.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} of time of removal of thiomersal, the CDC and AAP asked doctors to delay the birth dose of {{hepatitis}} B vaccine in children not at risk for hepatitis. This decision, though following the precautionary principle, nevertheless sparked confusion, controversy and some harm. Approximately 10% of hospitals suspended the use of hepatitis B vaccine for all newborns, and one child born to a Michigan mother infected with <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>virus</b> died of it. Similarly, a study found that the number of hospitals who failed to properly vaccinate infants of hepatitis B seropositive mothers rose by over 6 times. This is a potential negative outcome given the high probability that infants who acquire hepatitis B infection at birth will develop the infection in a chronic form and possibly liver cancer.|$|E

5|$|Reverse transcribing viruses: These have ssRNA (Retroviridae, Metaviridae, Pseudoviridae) or dsDNA (Caulimoviridae, and Hepadnaviridae) {{in their}} particles. Reverse transcribing viruses with RNA genomes (retroviruses), use a DNA {{intermediate}} to replicate, whereas those with DNA genomes (pararetroviruses) use an RNA intermediate during genome replication. Both types use a reverse transcriptase, or RNA-dependent DNA polymerase enzyme, {{to carry out}} the nucleic acid conversion. Retroviruses integrate the DNA produced by reverse transcription into the host genome as a provirus {{as a part of the}} replication process; pararetroviruses do not, although integrated genome copies of especially plant pararetroviruses can give rise to infectious virus. They are susceptible to antiviral drugs that inhibit the reverse transcriptase enzyme, e.g. zidovudine and lamivudine. An example of the first type is HIV, which is a retrovirus. Examples of the second type are the Hepadnaviridae, which includes <b>Hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>virus.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{second half}} of the 20th century was the golden age of virus {{discovery}} and most of the over 2,000 recognised species of animal, plant, and bacterial viruses were discovered during these years. In 1957, equine arterivirus and the cause of Bovine virus diarrhoea (a pestivirus) were discovered. In 1963, the <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>virus</b> was discovered by Baruch Blumberg, and in 1965, Howard Temin described the first retrovirus. Reverse transcriptase, the enzyme that retroviruses use to make DNA copies of their RNA, was first described in 1970, independently by Howard Martin Temin and David Baltimore. In 1983 Luc Montagnier's team at the Pasteur Institute in France, first isolated the retrovirus now called HIV. In 1989 Michael Houghton's team at Chiron Corporation discovered Hepatitis C.|$|E
5|$|The genome of HBV {{is made of}} {{circular}} DNA, but it {{is unusual}} because the DNA is not fully double-stranded. One end of the full length strand {{is linked to the}} viral DNA polymerase. The genome is 3020–3320 nucleotides long (for the full-length strand) and 1700–2800 nucleotides long (for the short length-strand). The negative-sense (non-coding) is complementary to the viral mRNA. The viral DNA is found in the nucleus soon after infection of the cell. The partially double-stranded DNA is rendered fully double-stranded by completion of the (+) sense strand and removal of a protein molecule from the (−) sense strand and a short sequence of RNA from the (+) sense strand. Non-coding bases are removed from the ends of the (−) sense strand and the ends are rejoined. There are four known genes encoded by the genome, called C, X, P, and S. The core protein is coded for by gene C (HBcAg), and its start codon is preceded by an upstream in-frame AUG start codon from which the pre-core protein is produced. HBeAg is produced by proteolytic processing of the pre-core protein. In some rare strains of the virus known as <b>Hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>virus</b> precore mutants, no HBeAg is present.|$|E
40|$|The {{lack of an}} {{in vitro}} {{infectivity}} assay for <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>viruses</b> has impeded the analysis of their genetic organization. To examine the feasibility of generating mutant and recombinant viruses after manipulation of cloned viral DNA in vitro, we have tested the infectivity of the cloned genome of ground squirrel hepatitis virus (GSHV) in virus-free Beechey ground squirrels. We demonstrate that cloned GSHV DNA is infectious when injected directly into the liver {{in the form of}} trimeric, head-to-tail recombinant clones and recircularized monomeric molecules but not when injected into the portal vein. Infections established in all four recipients of intrahepatic injections of cloned GSHV DNA exhibited the characteristics observed after administration of virus: GSHV surface antigen and viral DNA appeared in the serum 14 - 22 weeks after inoculation, and both circular and heterogeneous protein-linked forms of viral DNA were found in liver biopsy samples. Furthermore, virus present in the sera of these animals can be transmitted to other ground squirrels. These findings imply that any function of virion proteins in the initiation of infection by <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>viruses</b> can be bypassed with the use of cloned viral DNA and that this animal model is suitable for testing mutant genomes...|$|R
