On September 26 of that year, the General Office of the State Council handed down “Guiding Opinions Regarding Developing the <b>Domestic</b> <b>Services</b> Industry”, {{which stated the}} principle of persisting {{with a combination of}} market operation and government guidance. It stated explicitly that <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> was a focal development industry (zhongdian fazhan yetai), and encouraged all kinds of people to seek and create employment in the <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> industry and support the expansion and bolstering of <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> enterprises. In 2012, the “Notice Regarding Issues Related to the 2012 Launch of Constructing the <b>Domestic</b> <b>Services</b> System” continued the push to launch <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> pilot projects in some cities and supported the training of <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> personnel.|$|R
30|$|From {{approximately}} 2005 onward, {{with the}} conclusion of comprehensive reform of State enterprises, the <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> industry rapidly developed in the urban areas. In Beijing, for example, there were approximately 230, 000 domestic workers in 2006, among whom 40, 000 to 50, 000 were hourly workers. In 2007, live-in domestic workers exceeded 300, 000, and in 2010 {{there were more than}} 400, 000 domestic workers. In 2010, there were nearly 3, 000 <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> enterprises with industrial and commercial registrations, roughly divided into nine main categories providing nearly 100 types of service involving home cleaning, home cooking, home-based care, home decoration and repair, etc. The People’s Republic of China (PRC) (Ministry of Commerce 2015) <b>Domestic</b> <b>Services</b> Industry Development Report states that in 2013, 18 million people were engaged in the <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> industry, with 600, 000 <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> enterprises (Ministry of Commerce 2015). In 2014, the number of people employed in the <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> industry rose to 20.34 million, an increase of 13 % over the year before. The increase was 7.2 percentage points higher than the increase in the overall tertiary (service) sector. Among these domestic workers, 58.3 % were employed in sub-scale enterprises. In 2014, <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> enterprises took in revenues totalling 240 billion Yuan, an increase of 20 %. Calculations indicate that in 2014, profits in the <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> industry totalled 17.3 billion Yuan, an increase of 11.3 %. The annual production value of China’s <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> market is expected to reach 2 trillion Yuan in 2016 or 2017 (Ministry of Commerce 2015). In 2012, according to statistics from the China Home Service Association, China had 24.77 million domestic workers, and in 2011, the <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> industry’s annual production value was nearly 836.6 billion Yuan, comprising 1.77 % of GDP (Gross Domestic Product). 1 The author estimates that at least 25 million domestic workers of various types are currently employed in China’s cities and towns.|$|R

3000|$|In {{order to}} compete, the <b>domestic</b> <b>service</b> company has adopted the {{training}} of domestic workers {{in the position of}} employer’s demands. With the vigorous support of the government, private companies in the domestic sector rapidly increased. There are currently three types of <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> companies: intermediary companies, affiliate companies and staffed companies. The intermediary type is the most common. These companies provide intermediary services, charge an intermediary’s fee, and clients, domestic workers and the intermediary organ have an information service relationship. Staffed companies are also known as service dispatching companies. Here the domestic workers are staff of the <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> company, which sends them to the homes of clients to provide services. In this case the domestic worker and the <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> company have a labour contract relationship. The government encourages staffed companies, because this implements the requirements of the Labour Contract Law; the domestic worker signs a labour contract with the company. But, in fact, very few are able to become staff dispatched by these company. Affiliate companies are a kind of composite organization. Their operational model is a business management model situated between the intermediary <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> organizations and the staffed <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> organization. This kind of company is a market operation cantered on the employer; it provides diversified services and charges different fees based on the varying demands of employers at different economic income levels for <b>domestic</b> <b>service</b> workers. It is an operational model divided off through competition. Market competition and the differentiated demands engendered by social divergence combine to facilitate the diversification of the <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> industry, where high-end services are favoured because of their high return. Maternity services have become a notably high-end service due to the extreme importance society still places on female child-bearing. Following the traditional gender role division of labour, the intrinsic value of caretaker work continues to maintain the same status in the <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> industry, manifested in commercialized methods. The consumer model serving the upper class has been popularized in the market branding of <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> companies. The company Ayi laile (“Aunty’s Here”) strives to provide the “warmest housekeeper community and housekeeping platform”, highlighting the emotional output of the service. 6 [...]...|$|R

40|$|<b>Domestic</b> <b>service</b> {{historically}} in Mexico {{has been}} a major employer of women; in 1980, approximately one of every six working women was a private household worker. Private household employment is largely an urban occupation, and the nation 2 ̆ 7 s capital, Mexico City, has generated much of the demand for <b>domestic</b> <b>service.</b> As elsewhere in Latin America, most private household workers are young, single female migrants women from rural areas. ^ This study examines the history and present conditions of female <b>domestic</b> <b>service</b> in the Mexico City metropolitan area. In so doing, it focuses on various interrelated questions. First, it attempts to establish the role of <b>domestic</b> <b>service</b> in the process of Mexican development; it examines the economic, social, and political significance of this occupation. Secondly, this research addresses the relationship between <b>domestic</b> <b>service</b> and social reproduction. Thirdly, it describes and analyzes female domestic workers 2 ̆ 7 socioeconomic origins and demographic characteristics, as well as their labor and general living conditions. Fourthly, the influence of these combined factors in the configuration of their consciousness and identity is a related area of research. Finally, the different policies and programs concerning <b>domestic</b> <b>service</b> that have been formulated by the government, the Church, and the feminist Left are analyzed in terms of their goals, operation, and importance. ^ Given its objectives, this study draws upon historical and anthropological methodologies. Documentary and field research was carried out in the Mexico City area during various phases between 1977 and 1985. ^ The findings indicate that female <b>domestic</b> <b>service</b> has declined in relative terms over the twentieth century. Concomitantly, the conditions of <b>domestic</b> <b>service</b> themselves have changed; most notably, there have been transformations in the labor process, a shift towards live-out employment, and a trend towards a more contractual relationship. ...|$|R

It was finding <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> for urban families, and it was finding work in the cities for women from impoverished regions. More than 200, 000 rural women from impoverished regions have come to Beijing through Women’s Federations to work, providing caretaker services to more than 600, 000 families since 1983.4 The Women <b>Domestic</b> <b>Services</b> Centre {{plays the role of}} intermediary and bridge. It has a cooperative relationship with local women’s federations, which are responsible for finding women who need to leave their localities to work. The company and the family requiring <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> sign an introduction contract, and the domestic worker is recommended to the client family as a commercial product. The client family pays an intermediary’s fee, and if the worker is considered unsuitable, the family can send the worker back to the organization, which will make a total of three introductions. Domestic workers have an intermediary relationship with the company; they have no labour contract, health insurance, retirement benefits, workers’ compensation or other social security, and can easily be dismissed from their jobs.|$|R

30|$|With the {{increasing}} use of Internet, new <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> supply and demand relations are taking shape. Following the designated gender temperament, use of the O 2 O (online to offline) method to provide services, i.e., carrying out real-time link-up and real-time matching, has expanded the traditional scope of <b>domestic</b> <b>services.</b> This has given rise to products promoted on the pretext of “the good life” (meihao shenghuo). The Yancheng Good Life Professional House-cleaning Company refers to the professional cleaners in its domestic cleaning project as “home beautifiers”. 7 The new type of <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> company incorporates modern concepts to meet a new type of <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> demand; in fact, the market energetically creates services demand with mainly female temperament, such as cosmetics, manicures, therapeutic massage, etc. These services were all but non-existent during the planned economy era, but now have been made available, some even offered in-home. These kinds of “lazy woman can also be beautiful” and “ 58 to Home” beauty services also include all kinds of adornment. Both supply and demand in the <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> market have become the domains of tech-savvy young people, and a traditional female gender temperament has been produced through the push of consumerism.|$|R

30|$|The {{domestic}} sector became a government-led industry, and many <b>domestic</b> <b>service</b> companies were established. Here, the state demonstrates {{the characteristics of}} market paternalism, i.e., using market methods to develop the <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> industry. First, it used the “government project” method to express support for developing the urban <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> industry, and invested in and promoted the development of <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> companies and the training of domestic workers. Second, {{with the needs of}} urban households coming first, it emphasized the needs of households over labour supply. This was manifested in mainly training domestic workers in their domestic abilities. The needs of domestic workers in terms of retirement benefits, medical treatment and workers’ compensation were set aside. Although the government encouraged <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> companies to provide commercial insurance for their workers, it also acknowledged that business interests made this difficult to do. Third, the government directly entered the <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> industry in the form of purchasing services, {{as in the case of}} some local governments purchasing specialized services on an hourly basis for particular families with incapacitated or semi-incapacitated members or particular families who had taken part in family planning and had parents aged 65 or older. Fourth, the government encouraged women’s federations, trade unions, Communist Youth Leagues, etc., to organize and establish schools for training domestic workers. Referring to state market paternalism is to underline that all of the above are built on the foundation of a classed gender ideology, i.e., that women’s natural instinct is to look after others, that it is not of value, and that providing laid-off female workers and rural women with training and job opportunities was the best development for them. This gender ideology suffuses all aspects of government policy relating to the <b>domestic</b> <b>services</b> industry. At the same time that the government provided work mechanism for domestic workers, it decided their marginal status.|$|R
