25|$|After Elvis Presley {{began his}} musical career, he {{purchased}} a $40,000 home {{for himself and}} his family at 1034 Audubon Drive in Memphis, TN. As his fame grew, especially after his appearances on television, the number of fans that would congregate outside the house multiplied. Presley's neighbors, most of whom were <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> celebrity living nearby, soon came to find the constant gathering of fans and journalists a nuisance. After several complaints, Presley decided it was necessary for him to move to a property more suitable.|$|E
25|$|In 2017, for {{the second}} year in a row, Purser participated in the SBL All-Star Game and earned SBL All-Defensive Five honours. Heading into the 2017 season, new Hawks coach Matt Parsons was <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> leader of Purser's quality, character, {{production}} and work ethic at his disposal. On June 10, in his 250th SBL game, Purser scored a team-high 22 points in a 74–69 loss to the Goldfields Giants in Kalgoorlie. On July 8, Purser participated in the first ever SBL match played in Northam, recording 17 points and eight rebounds in the Hawks' 97–76 win over the Kalamunda Eastern Suns. The Hawks finished the regular season in eighth position with a 12–14 record, and faced the first-seeded Willetton Tigers in the quarter-finals. In Game 1 of the series, Purser had 17 points, 12 rebounds and six assists in helping the Hawks claim an unexpected 90–80 win. However, the Hawks went on to lose the series 2–1 to bow out of the quarter-finals for the third straight season. In 27 games for the Hawks in 2017, Purser averaged 14.3 points, 8.0 rebounds and 4.0 assists per game.|$|E

25|$|The {{refugees}} {{were transferred to}} the cruise ship Neuralia, which had been taken into war service. The Czechs looked to smuggle Ant between the two ships by hiding him in a kit bag. This failed as the dog pushed {{his head out of}} the bag just as they were boarding – fortunately for Ant the new crew seemed <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> dog on-board and welcomed him. The facilities on Neuralia were much better than Northmoor, as the cabins remained fitted out as a cruise ship and Ant could stay in the cabin with the men. The remainder of the voyage went smoothly, until Bozděch was informed about the quarantine rules for dogs upon entering the United Kingdom. Having no money with which to pay for the quarantine fees, the Czechs sought once again to smuggle him – this time into the UK. They elected to hide Ant once again in a bag, this time mixed up in those being transferred as cargo by crane. They arrived at the docks in Liverpool on 12 July, where they successfully took Ant ashore. They were nearly found out by a pair of military police as they were at the train station nearby as {{they were on their way}} to Cholmondeley, Cheshire.|$|E

Johnson, Lady Bird Johnson, Congressman John Lyle, and President Truman's military aide Gen. Harry H.

500|$|In June 2010, when Jill's adoptive mother, Liz Foster (Julianna McCarthy), died, it {{was then}} learned that her {{biological}} father was Neil Fenmore. Walton stated: [...] "Liz was the dream mother for Jill. She always could handle Jill." [...] During an interview with On-Air On-Soaps speaking about how her character has been thrown in different directions, Walton said: [...] "It used to bother me. I would try and keep a steady course with it, and now I can’t. Now I just roll with the punches. It’s impossible." [...] Walton noted that Jill was finally <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> blood relative through Neil's other daughter, Lauren Fenmore (Tracey E. Bregman). She said: [...] "Liz dies within a week {{and all of a}} sudden it’s, 'I am a Fenmore'. And we really didn’t have a chance to explore it much, but in real life that happens. My first thought as Jill is, 'I actually know who my blood is, and I have a sister.' And, Jill was very moved and touched and shocked from the death of Liz, but full of love for her sister." [...] On her relationship with Lauren, Walton stated that, [...] "Most people don’t like Jill, and she hasn’t particularly loved Lauren. I have never had that much to do with Lauren, really." [...] Nekeeta Borden of Zap2it noted: [...] "The redhead told Jill in no uncertain terms that she intended to keep her father’s memory, and only child status, firmly in tact [...] and had no interest in a close relationship." [...] Borden also noted that Jill always wanted a sense of belonging, which prompted her to legally change her name to Jill Fenmore. The sisters were initially bitter towards each other having to share half of the Fenmore Boutique, but have since gotten closer. Walton said that, [...] "From my point of view, I think that Lauren has a really big heart; she's a naturally lovely person. Lauren was really awful a few times, and that just came out of her pain. So, it looks like Lauren and Jill are kind of getting along okay, but there's nothing else coming up in the scripts for them yet." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} argued that the effects of {{pupil-teacher}} sexual harassment vary depending on the gender of the student and the harasser. [...] In some states in the U.S., sexual relations between a woman and an underage male did not even constitute statutory rape until the 1970s. [...] Many assert that most boys would be <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> teacher show sexual interest in them. While the effects vary from student to student, evidence shows that both male and female victims exhibit similar psychological effects from pupil-teacher sexual harassment. In the long term, experts have suggested that victims experience issues with depression, addiction, and age-appropriate relationships.|$|E

2500|$|It {{eventually}} became {{too difficult for}} Krasner to support herself as a waitress due to the Great Depression. In order to provide for herself, she joined the Works Progress Administration's Federal Art Project in 1935. She worked on the mural division {{as an assistant to}} Max Spivak. Her job was to enlarge other artists' designs for large-scaled public murals. Since murals were created to be easily understood and appreciated by the general public, the abstract art Krasner produced was undesirable for murals. While Krasner was <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> job, she was dissatisfied since she did not like working with [...] figurative images created by other artists. Throughout the late 1930s and early 1940s, she created gouache sketches in the hopes of one day creating an [...] abstract mural. As soon as one of her proposals for a mural was approved for the WYNC radio station, the Works Progress Administration turned into [...] War Services and all art had to be created for war propaganda. She continued working for War Services by creating collages for the war effort which were displayed in the windows of nineteen department stores in Brooklyn and Manhattan.> She was very involved with the Artists Union during her employment with the WPA but {{was one of the first}} to quit the organization when she realized the communists were taking it over. By being part of this organization, she was able to meet more artists in New York City and enlarge her network.|$|E

Also there is a story that, when one of his friends was taken before the Lord Chief Justice, he went and ordered him to be released and that when the justice refused he drew his sword, upon which the justice sent him to prison; and he went quietly, knowing it was right.

6000|$|When Mrs. Edmonstone came in, {{the doctor}} was a little taken aback.

At dinner, Mr. Edmonstone was in high spirits, delighted at Amy's recovery, <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> young man about the house again, charmed to see two lovers together, pleased that Laura should be mistress of Redclyffe, since it could not belong to Amy's child; altogether, as joyous as ever. His wife, being at ease about Amy, {{did her best to}} smile, and even laugh, though sad at heart all the time, as she missed the father from the christening feast, and thought how happy she had been in that far different reunion last year. It might be the same with Charles; but the outward effect was exhibited in lively nonsense; Charlotte's spirits were rising fast, and only Philip and Laura themselves were grave and silent, she, the more so, because she was disappointed to find that the one walk back from East-hill, much as he had enjoyed it, had greatly tired Philip. However, the others talked enough without them; and Mr. Edmonstone was very happy, drinking the health of Miss Morville, and himself carrying a bit of the christening cake to the mamma in the drawing-room.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Penniman {{immediately}} {{wrote to}} Morris Townsend. The intimacy {{between these two}} was by this time consummate, but I must content myself with noting {{but a few of}} its features. Mrs. Penniman's own share in it was a singular sentiment, which might have been misinterpreted, but which in itself was not discreditable to the poor lady. It was a romantic interest in this attractive and unfortunate young man, and yet it was not such an interest as Catherine might have been jealous of. Mrs. Penniman had not a particle of jealousy of her niece. For herself, {{she felt as if she}} were Morris's mother or sister--a mother or sister of an emotional temperament--and she had an absorbing desire to make him comfortable and happy. She had striven to do so during the year that her brother left her an open field, and her efforts had been attended with the success that has been pointed out. She had never had a child of her own, and Catherine, whom she had done her best to invest with the importance that would naturally belong to a youthful Penniman, had only partly rewarded her zeal. Catherine, as an object of affection and solicitude, had never had that picturesque charm which (as it seemed to her) would have been a natural attribute of her own progeny. Even the maternal passion in Mrs. Penniman would have been romantic and factitious, and Catherine was not constituted to inspire a romantic passion. Mrs. Penniman was as fond of her as ever, but she had grown to feel that with Catherine she lacked opportunity. Sentimentally speaking, therefore, she had (though she had not disinherited her niece) adopted Morris Townsend, who gave her opportunity in abundance. She would have been very <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> handsome and tyrannical son, and would have taken an extreme interest in his love affairs. This was the light in which she had come to regard Morris, who had conciliated her at first, and made his impression by his delicate and calculated deference--a sort of exhibition to which Mrs. Penniman was particularly sensitive. He had largely abated his deference afterwards, for he economised his resources, but the impression was made, and the young man's very brutality came to have a sort of filial value. If Mrs. Penniman had had a son, she would probably have been afraid of him, and at this stage of our narrative she was certainly afraid of Morris Townsend. This was one of the results of his domestication in Washington Square. He took his ease with her--as, for that matter, he would certainly have done with his own mother.|$|E
