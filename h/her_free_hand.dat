60|$|For reply, Saxon reached <b>her</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> over to {{the hand}} that rested on Billy's arm.|$|E
60|$|She raised <b>her</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> to his {{shoulder}} and swayed toward him. He held her a moment, clasped tight, and then released her.|$|E
6000|$|... "None, madam!" [...] gasped Aurelia, trembling, so {{that she}} grasped her chair-back with <b>her</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> for support. [...] "I never saw him till to-night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No she won't," [...] {{declared}} Ross, {{with intent}} to encourage her. [...] "If you give <b>her</b> a <b>free</b> <b>hand,</b> I predict she'll make your place the wonder and boast of the county-side." ...|$|R
60|$|She <b>frees</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> and courtesies to one gentleman and the other.|$|R
60|$|Gabriel <b>freed</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> quietly, {{retired to}} his handle, and the {{grinding}} went on.|$|R
60|$|Holding {{the book}} almost at arm's length, {{for she was}} {{somewhat}} long-sighted, and making suitable gestures with <b>her</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand,</b> she began to read, slowly, dramatically.|$|E
60|$|With <b>her</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> Lucy {{returned}} his clasp. She {{seemed to be}} strong. It was a precious moment for Slone, {{in which he was}} uplifted beyond all dreams.|$|E
60|$|She {{tried to}} run back. I caught her by the arm, and {{detained}} her. With <b>her</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> she held her handkerchief over her face so as to hide it from me.|$|E
60|$|She {{snatched}} <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>free</b> from Alison's, {{and fled}} {{out of the}} room, into the hallway.|$|R
5000|$|Her {{debut album}} was {{released}} in 1994 by Finnish publisher Like, who gave <b>her</b> <b>free</b> <b>hands.</b> The result was Vihreä rapsodia, a wild surreal journey, where the ten-year-old Kiti goes to Hungary to visit her friend Erika. Once upon a time she walks out for a multitude of strange revelations and episodes, including naked Mongols (asking for the ticket), talking dogs and a very strange circus. The main character Kiti recalls in the story a part of Hungary as Kovács himself visited virtually every summer during the youth - grandfather was a youngster. Some autobiography, however, is the series far away - [...] "Well, I was always called Kati!" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{tone was}} {{friendly}} and frank. Sarah stretched {{out her hand}} to meet that of Nan and in a flash a handcuff snapped over her wrist. With a cry she drew back, but a dextrous twist of <b>her</b> opponent's <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> prisoned <b>her</b> other wrist and she at once {{realized that she was}} fairly caught.|$|R
6000|$|... [The MOTHER, still {{hugging her}} BABY, who has stopped crying, [...] gazes at the LITTLE MAN, who sits dazedly looking up. Suddenly [...] she drops on her knees, and with <b>her</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> lifts his booted [...] foot and kisses it.] ...|$|E
60|$|At {{that moment}} {{she heard a}} sound in the court, as of some one approaching, and to avoid letting others know of this {{fascinating}} secret the girl thoughtlessly grasped the adobe door with <b>her</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> and swung it shut behind her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Aw, it's {{only one}} of his cryin' jags," [...] Mary said, with a {{harshness}} that <b>her</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> belied as it caressed his hair with soothing strokes. [...] "Buck up, Bert. Everything's all right. And now it's up to Bill to say something after your dandy spiel." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Freeing</b> <b>her</b> <b>Hands</b> to Clap was the 2000 National Book Development Council/Una Marson Biannual Award. Gauntlett's {{second book}} of poetry, The Watertank Revisited, was {{published}} in 2005.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! You are insufferable!" [...] She tore <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>free</b> {{and backed}} away from him. [...] "I should not have come. Good-bye!" [...] She was {{speeding}} to the door.|$|R
50|$|Unlike manual {{push-to-talk}} (PTT) operation, VOX isautomatic; {{the user}} can keep his or <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> while talking. ButVOX {{also has some}} significant disadvantages that explain why PTT isstill common.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me go. How {{dare you}} touch me!" [...] cried Betty, the hot blood {{coloring}} her face. She struck him a stinging blow with <b>her</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> and struggled {{with all her}} might to free herself; but she was powerless in his iron grasp. Closer he drew her.|$|E
6000|$|She {{held by the}} {{baluster}} with <b>her</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand,</b> {{and controlled}} the sickening sensation which that momentary contact with him produced. He might have detected the outward signs of the struggle, but for an interruption which preserved her from discovery. Mrs. Gallilee {{was standing at the}} open library door. Mrs. Gallilee said, [...] "I am waiting for you, Mr. Le Frank." ...|$|E
60|$|Billy declined, {{being of}} the opinion {{that it would be better}} in the morning. Saxon was troubled, and as she dozed off she knew that he was lying restlessly wide awake. A few minutes afterward, roused by a heavy blast of wind and rain on the canvas, she heard Billy softly groaning. She raised herself on her elbow and with <b>her</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand,</b> in the way she knew, {{manipulating}} his forehead and the surfaces around his eyes, soothed him off to sleep.|$|E
60|$|Raffles Haw {{still stood}} cold and motionless. He was stunned, benumbed, {{by what he}} saw and heard. Laura drew away from Hector, and tried to <b>free</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> from his grasp.|$|R
60|$|But Ursula had got <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>free.</b> She {{turned to}} Birkin with a quick, almost jeering: 'Good-bye,' {{and she was}} opening the door before {{he had time to}} do it for her.|$|R
50|$|She {{wrote her}} second novel, Silver City, to {{coincide}} with the release of the film of the same name. It was Penguin’s first novelisation, and her contract gave <b>her</b> a <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> in developing the film’s story about Polish migrants to Australia. She finished the novel in eight months. Aside from the money, she was interested in learning about the film industry in preparation for her third novel, Schemetime, about an Australian filmmaker in Hollywood.|$|R
60|$|Michael, his forefeet on the gunwale, barked {{to him in}} a puzzled, {{questioning}} sort of way, and Jerry whimpered back incommunicable understanding. The lady-god {{pressed his}} two flanks together reassuringly, and he turned to her, his cool nose touched questioningly to her cheek. She gathered his body close against her breast in one encircling arm, <b>her</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> resting on the rail, half-closed, a pink- and-white heart of flower, fragrant and seducing. Jerry's nose quested the way of it. The aperture invited. With snuggling, budging, and nudging-movements he spread the fingers slightly wider as his nose penetrated into the sheer delight and loveliness of her hand.|$|E
60|$|The {{day before}} Billy's release Saxon {{completed}} her meager preparations to receive him. She was without money, and, {{except for her}} resolve not to offend Billy in that way again, she would have borrowed ferry fare from Maggie Donahue and journeyed to San Francisco to sell some of her personal pretties. As it was, with bread and potatoes and salted sardines in the house, she went out at the afternoon low tide and dug clams for a chowder. Also, she gathered a load of driftwood, and it was nine in the evening when she emerged from the marsh, on her shoulder a bundle of wood and a short-handled spade, in <b>her</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> the pail of clams. She sought {{the darker side of}} the street at the corner and hurried across the zone of electric light to avoid detection by the neighbors. But a woman came toward her, looked sharply and stopped in front of her. It was Mary.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course there's nothing {{very much}} at present, but there will be, I expect, before it's over; divorce suits are beastly, you know. I wanted to tell you, because--because--you ought to know--if--" [...] {{and he began to}} stammer, gazing at her troubled eyes, [...] "if--if you're going to be a darling and love me, Holly. I love you--ever so; and I want to be engaged." [...] He had done it in a manner so {{inadequate}} that he could have punched his own head; and dropping on his knees, he tried to get nearer to that soft, troubled face. [...] "You do love me--don't you? If you don't I...." [...] There was a moment of silence and suspense, so awful that he could hear the sound of a mowing-machine far out on the lawn pretending there was grass to cut. Then she swayed forward; <b>her</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> touched his hair, and he gasped: [...] "Oh, Holly!" ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1870s the American stage mentalist Washington Irving Bishop was {{the manager of}} Fay's spiritualist acts, but in 1876 exposed her trick methods to the media. In 1883 the ex-medium John W. Truesdell {{revealed}} <b>her</b> method of <b>freeing</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> from cotton bandages.|$|R
60|$|Something in {{the agony}} of his appeal, {{something}} in the pathos of Elsa's defiant attitude must have struck a more gentle cord in the Jewess' heart. The tears gathered in her eyes--tears of self-pity at the misery which {{she seemed to be}} strewing all round <b>her</b> with a <b>free</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] whispered Betty, {{standing}} {{still as a}} statue and looking at him with wonderful eyes. Then, as reason returned, a hot flush dyed her face, and wrenching <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> she struck him across the cheek.|$|R
60|$|His arm, like {{a band of}} iron, held her, yet it was {{flexible}} and yielded her to {{the motion of the}} horse. One instant she felt the brawn, the bone, heavy and powerful; the next the stretch and ripple, the elasticity of muscles. He held her as easily {{as if she were a}} child. The roughness of his flannel shirt rubbed her cheek, and beneath that she felt the dampness of the scarf he had used to bathe her arm, and deeper still the regular pound of his heart. Against her ear, filling it with strong, vibrant beat, his heart seemed a mighty engine deep within a great cavern. Her head had never before rested on a man's breast, and she had no liking for it there; but she felt more than the physical contact. The position was mysterious and fascinating, and something natural in it made her think of life. Then as the cool wind blew down from the heights, loosening her tumbled hair, she was compelled to see strands of it curl softly into Stewart's face, before his eyes, across his lips. She was unable to reach it with <b>her</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand,</b> and therefore could not refasten it. And when she shut her eyes she felt those loosened strands playing against his cheeks.|$|E
60|$|When {{she came}} back, Ramona in a {{pleasant}} lather, Saxon rode {{to the rear}} of the house, past the chicken houses and the flourishing berry-rows, to join Billy on the rim of the bench, where he sat on his horse in the shade, smoking a cigarette. Together they looked down through an opening among the trees to the meadow which was a meadow no longer. With mathematical accuracy it was divided into squares, oblongs, and narrow strips, which displayed sharply the thousand hues of green of a truck garden. Gow Yum and Chan Chi, under enormous Chinese grass hats, were planting green onions. Old Hughie, hoe in hand, plodded along the main artery of running water, opening certain laterals, closing others. From the work-shed beyond the barn the strokes of a hammer told Saxon that Carlsen was wire-binding vegetable boxes. Mrs. Paul's cheery soprano, lifted in a hymn, doated through the trees, accompanied by the whirr of an egg-beater. A sharp barking told where Possum still waged hysterical and baffled war on the Douglass squirrels. Billy took a long draw from his cigarette, exhaled the smoke, and continued to look down at the meadow. Saxon divined trouble in his manner. His rein-hand was on the pommel, and <b>her</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> went out and softly rested on his. Billy turned his slow gaze upon her mare's lather, seeming not to note it, and continued on to Saxon's face.|$|E
6000|$|Ariel {{had been}} {{beforehand}} with me. She had raised her master in the chair; she had got one arm around him. In <b>her</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> she brandished an Indian club, torn from a [...] "trophy" [...] of Oriental weapons that ornamented the wall over the fire-place. The creature was transfigured! Her dull eyes glared like {{the eyes of}} a wild animal. She gnashed her teeth in the frenzy that possessed her. [...] "You have done this!" [...] she shouted to me, waving the club furiously around and around over her head. [...] "Come near him, and I'll dash your brains out! I'll mash you till there's not a whole bone left in your skin!" [...] Benjamin, still holding me with one hand opened the door with the other. I let him do with me as he would; Ariel fascinated me; I could look at nothing but Ariel. Her frenzy vanished as she saw us retreating. She dropped the club; she threw both arms around him, and nestled her head on his bosom, and sobbed and wept over him. [...] "Master! master! They shan't vex you any more. Look up again. Laugh at me as you used to do. Say, 'Ariel, you're a fool.' Be like yourself again!" [...] I was forced into the next room. I heard a long, low, wailing cry of misery from the poor creature who loved him with a dog's fidelity and a woman's devotion. The heavy door was closed between us. I was in the quiet antechamber, crying over that piteous sight; clinging to my kind old friend as helpless and as useless as a child.|$|E
6000|$|She <b>freed</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> {{from both}} of those he had closed upon it, and went back from him across {{the room with a}} sinuous spring. [...] "ME!" [...] Whatever {{potential}} complicity had lurked in her heart, his words brought her only immeasurable dismay.|$|R
5000|$|At this time, Laval {{was opposed}} to Germany, the [...] "hereditary enemy" [...] of France, and he pursued anti-German alliances. He met with Mussolini in Rome, and they signed the Franco-Italian Agreement of 1935 on 4 January. The {{agreement}} ceded parts of French Somaliland to Italy and allowed <b>her</b> a <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> in Abyssinia, in exchange for support against any German aggression. Laval denied that he gave Mussolini a <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> in Abyssinia; he even wrote to Il Duce on the subject. [...] In April 1935, Laval persuaded Italy and Great Britain to join France in the Stresa Front against German ambitions in Austria. On 2 May 1935, he likewise signed the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{she said}} promptly, rising and {{arranging}} her wrap across her shoulders, {{so as to}} leave <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>free.</b> She laid one hand in his arm and gathered her skirt with the other, and they swept round together for the start and confronted Hicks.|$|R
