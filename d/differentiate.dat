40|$|Coordination of cell {{proliferation}} and differentiation {{is crucial for}} tissue formation, repair and regeneration. Some tissues, such as skin and blood, depend on differentiation of a pluripotent stem cell population, whereas others depend on the division of <b>differentiated</b> cells. In development and in the hair follicle, pigmented melanocytes are derived from undifferentiated precursor cells or stem cells. However, <b>differentiated</b> melanocytes may also have proliferative capacity in animals, {{and the potential for}} <b>differentiated</b> melanocyte cell division in development and regeneration remains largely unexplored. Here, we use time-lapse imaging of the developing zebrafish to show that while most melanocytes arise from undifferentiated precursor cells, an unexpected subpopulation of <b>differentiated</b> melanocytes arises by cell division. Depletion of the overall melanocyte population triggers a regeneration phase in which <b>differentiated</b> melanocyte division is significantly enhanced, particularly in young <b>differentiated</b> melanocytes. Additionally, we find reduced levels of Mitf activity using an mitfa temperature-sensitive line results in a dramatic increase in <b>differentiated</b> melanocyte cell division. This supports models that in addition to promoting differentiation, Mitf also promotes withdrawal from the cell cycle. We suggest <b>differentiated</b> cell division is relevant to melanoma progression because the human melanoma mutation MITF 4 TΔ 2 B promotes increased and serial <b>differentiated</b> melanocyte division in zebrafish. These results reveal a novel pathway of <b>differentiated</b> melanocyte division in vivo, and that Mitf activity is essential for maintaining cell cycle arrest in <b>differentiated</b> melanocytes...|$|R

40|$|SummaryHuman {{embryonic}} stem cells (hESCs) are highly sensitive to DNA damage and have low survival ability relative to <b>differentiated</b> cells. We investigated {{the source of this}} difference by comparing damage response pathways in hESCs and <b>differentiated</b> cells. We found that hESCs undergo more rapid p 53 -dependent apoptosis after DNA damage than <b>differentiated</b> cells do. However, p 53 localization and function are similar between hESCs and <b>differentiated</b> cells, suggesting that p 53 alone cannot explain the difference in sensitivity. Instead, we show that mitochondrial readiness for apoptosis, known as mitochondrial priming, differs between hESCs and <b>differentiated</b> cells. Specifically, the balance between proapoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins is shifted closer to the apoptotic threshold in hESCs than in <b>differentiated</b> cells. Altering this balance in <b>differentiated</b> cells increases their sensitivity and results in cell death, suggesting that manipulation of mitochondrial priming could potentially alter the sensitivity of other stem cells, including cancer stem cells...|$|R

Ninety female white albino rats were included in the study and divided equally (n= 15 /group) into 6 groups: healthy control, healthy control rats received acellular tissue culture medium, diabetic rats, diabetic rats received acellular tissue culture medium, diabetic rats received undifferentiated MSCs and diabetic rats received <b>differentiated</b> MSCs. Therapeutic efficacy of undifferentiated versus <b>differentiated</b> MSCs was evaluated via assessment of quantitative gene expressions of insulin 1, insulin 2, Smad- 2, Smad- 3, PDX- 1, PAX- 4, neuroD. Blood glucose and insulin hormone levels were also assessed. Results showed that quantitative gene expressions of all studied genes showed significant decrease in diabetic rat groups. Use of undifferentiated and <b>differentiated</b> MSCs led to a significant elevation of expression levels of all genes with more superior effect with <b>differentiated</b> MSCs except smad- 2 gene. As regards insulin hormone levels, use of either undifferentiated or <b>differentiated</b> MSCs led to a significant elevation of its levels with more therapeutic effect with <b>differentiated</b> MSCs. Blood glucose levels were significantly decreased with both undifferentiated and <b>differentiated</b> MSCs in comparison to diabetic groups but its levels were normalized 2 months after injection of <b>differentiated</b> MSCs. In conclusion, use of undifferentiated or <b>differentiated</b> MSCs exhibited significant therapeutic potentials in experimental type I diabetes in rats with more significant therapeutic effect with the use of <b>differentiated</b> MSCs...|$|R

We took advantage of these large <b>differentiated</b> blastomeres, which were amenable to electrophysiological recordings, to compare Na channels in the egg cell and those in the neurally <b>differentiated</b> blastomere. The macroscopic Na current in the <b>differentiated</b> blastomere showed a marked slow-decaying component in addition to a fast one, whereas in the egg the fast-decaying component was predominant. Both the I-V relationship and the steady-state inactivation curve shifted about 8 mV in the positive direction in the neurally <b>differentiated</b> blastomere compared with those in the egg cell. Furthermore, single-channel current recordings revealed that Na channels reopened more frequently in the <b>differentiated</b> blastomere than in the egg cell. This characteristic of the channel corresponded well to the marked slow-decaying component of the macroscopic current in the <b>differentiated</b> blastomere. The single-channel conductance was similar in both types of cells. We conclude that the neurally <b>differentiated</b> blastomere expresses a Na channel that has properties of inactivation kinetics distinct from those of the egg-type Na channel and that no detectable egg-type channel coexists in the neurally <b>differentiated</b> blastomeres...|$|R

Following primary screening by ELISA and secondary screening with immunohistochemistry, three useful antibodies were identified. MoAb 35. 48 binds to all cell layers of the normal urothelium and well <b>differentiated</b> tumours, but not to the majority of poorly <b>differentiated</b> tumours.

Quantitative flow cytometric studies indicate that MoAb 5. 48 binds to a cell-surface antigen which is present on significantly fewer cells of poorly <b>differentiated</b> tumours than on either normal urothelium (P less than 0. 05), or well <b>differentiated</b> tumours (P = 0. 05) ...|$|R

40|$|Background Little {{is known}} about the {{variability}} of the dermoscopic criteria of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) according to the histopathological differentiation grade. Objectives To evaluate whether specific dermoscopic criteria can predict the diagnosis of poorly <b>differentiated</b> SCC compared with well- and moderately <b>differentiated</b> SCC. Methods Clinical and dermoscopic images of SCCs were retrospectively evaluated for the presence of predefined criteria. Univariate and adjusted odds ratios were calculated. Discriminant functions were used to plot receiver-operator characteristic curves. Results Of 143 SCCs included, 48 (33 · 5 %) were well <b>differentiated,</b> 45 (31 · 5 %) were moderately <b>differentiated</b> and 50 (35 · 0 %) were poorly <b>differentiated.</b> Flat tumours had a fourfold increased probability of being poorly <b>differentiated.</b> Dermoscopically, the presence of a predominantly red colour posed a 13 -fold possibility of poor differentiation, whereas a predominantly white and white-yellow colour decreased the odds of poorly <b>differentiated</b> SCC by 97 % each. The presence of vessels in more than 50 % of the tumour's surface, a diffuse distribution of vessels and bleeding were significantly associated with poor differentiation, while scale/keratin was a potent predictor of well- or moderately <b>differentiated</b> tumours. Conclusions Dermoscopy may be regarded as a reliable preoperative tool to distinguish poorly from well- and moderately <b>differentiated</b> SCC. Given that poor differentiation of SCC represents an independent risk factor for recurrence, metastasis and disease-specific death, identifying poorly <b>differentiated</b> tumours in vivo may enhance their appropriate management. What's already known about this topic? While the dermoscopic criteria of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) have been well described, little is currently known about the variability of these criteria with respect to the histopathological grade of differentiation in SCC. What does this study add? Poorly <b>differentiated</b> SCC is dermoscopically typified by a predominantly red colour, attributed to the presence of bleeding and/or dense vascularity. Identifying poorly <b>differentiated</b> tumours in vivo may enhance their appropriate management...|$|R
