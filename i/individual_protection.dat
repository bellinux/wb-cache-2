40|$|This article dissects the {{legality}} {{and purpose of}} diplomatic asylum, an intrinsically controversial area of international law.

Diplomatic asylum appears as a legal concept which persists in providing politically persecuted <b>individuals</b> <b>protection</b> regardless of the criticism grants of diplomatic asylum receive.

[...] did not prevent the lamp-post from being replaced by a concrete one; however, it was given to him for his own garden and his wife Patricia unlocked him.

In 1990, she helped establish a Coastal Zone Management Unit {{as part of}} the Fisheries department. Gibson joined the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and in 1993, their efforts, along with other organizations' support gained a designation as a protected reserve for Belize. Gibson and others working in environmental protection began to realize that <b>individual</b> <b>protection</b> was insufficient as without a management approach that protected the entire barrier zone, external forces, like algae blooms spawned from fruit plantation waste, overfishing in other areas causing collateral damage, or sedimentation caused by development, were having detrimental impacts. Working with water management agencies, forestry representatives, other environmental groups and citizens, in 1993 a plan was adopted to formalize protection of the reef as a natural World Heritage Site in a serial nomination. After several years of planning and work, the designation was granted by UNESCO in November 1996. Gibson {{is the director of the}} Belize Wildlife Conservation Society and has published numerous scientific works.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of trafficking victims are women and girls, who {{are especially vulnerable}} due to limited economic opportunities, illiteracy or low education, and low socioeconomic and cultural status. Women and girls are also more vulnerable to trafficking if {{they are involved in}} marginalized livelihoods, deserted by their husbands or families, victims of abuse and violence, and those from disadvantaged communities and extremely poor families. Victims come from all areas of Nepal, but most targeted are those in traditionally disadvantaged, marginalized groups such as the Dalit caste (untouchables) and ethnic minorities ("janajati", indigenous peoples). Additional vulnerable groups include those of religious minorities, those with disability, those from mid- and far-western development regions, and those residing in an area vulnerable to climate change and natural disasters. The United Nations (2011) classified the most vulnerable groups in Nepal who require the most immediate support through the following three criteria: 1) human development (poverty, economic resources, knowledge and health); 2) exclusion (economic exclusion, political exclusion and civic/cultural exclusion); and 3) weak <b>individual</b> <b>protection</b> (physical protection and legal protection). However, victimization is spreading to advantaged groups and upper caste women as well. The Nepal Human Development Report (2004) estimates approximately 20% who are trafficked to India and other countries in Asia are under the age of 16.|$|E
