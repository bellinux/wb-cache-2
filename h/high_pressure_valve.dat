This work has developed the understanding of how to produce nanoemulsions efficiently using two high pressure devices: the industrially used <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>valve</b> homogeniser (HPH) and the efficient but hard to scale Microfluidizer. A range of different oil to aqueous phase viscosity ratios, emulsifier types, pressure drops and number of passes through the devices were tested.

The geometry of these devices was shown to be the largest influence on homogenisation efficiency. Upon lowering the viscosity ratio, coalescence in the HPH was reduced and for the W/O emulsions produced, the efficiency was matched to the Microfluidizer, with both producing 50 nm minimum droplet diameters.

40|$|When {{operating}} microsystems in harsh environments, many conventionally used {{techniques are}} limiting. Further, depending on if the demands {{arise from the}} environment or the conditions inside the system, different approaches have to be used. This thesis deals with the challenges encountered when microsystems are used at high pressures and high temperatures. For microsystems operating at harsh conditions, many parameters will vary extensively with both temperature and pressure, and to maintain control, these variations needs to be well understood. Covered within this thesis is the to-date strongest membrane micropump, demonstrated to pump against back-pressures up to 13 MPa, and a gas-tight <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>valve</b> that manages pressures beyond 20 MPa. With the ability to manipulate fluids at high pressures in microsystems at elevated temperatures, opportunities are created to use green solvents like supercritical fluids like CO 2. To allow for a reliable and predictable operation in systems using more than one fluid, {{the behavior of the}} multiphase flow needs to be controlled. Therefore, the effect of varying temperature and pressure, as well as flow conditions were investigated for multiphase flows of CO 2 and H 2 O around and above the critical point of CO 2. Also, the influence of channel surface and geometry was investigated. Although supercritical CO 2 only requires moderate temperatures, other supercritical fluids or reactions require much higher temperatures. The study how increasing temperature affects a system, a high-temperature testbed inside an electron microscope was created. One of the challenges for high-temperature systems is the interface towards room temperature components. To circumvent the need of wires, high temperature wireless systems were studied together with a wireless pressure sensing system operating at temperatures up to 1, 000  °C for pressures up to 0. 3 MPa. To further extend the capabilities of microsystems and combine high temperatures and high pressures, it is necessary to consider that the requirements differs fundamentally. Therefore, combining high pressures and high temperatures in microsystems results in great challenges, which requires trade-offs and compromises. Here, steel and HTCC based microsystems may prove interesting alternatives for future high performance microsystems...|$|E
40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis aims to present results regarding the exploration, validation and use of a novel rotor-stator type mixing equipment employing controlled deformation dynamic mixing (CDDM) technology in creating sub-micron emulsions for use in chemical reactions. Emulsification is {{the process by which}} one immiscible liquid (e. g. oil) is finely dispersed throughout another immiscible liquid (e. g. water) and stabilised, commonly through the addition of a surface active agent or emulsifier to the system. Specific focus was given to the emulsification of plant oils (such as sunflower seed oil) as a way of improving their available reactive surface area. The addition of emulsifiers in this case was used to sufficiently reduce the interfacial tensions, allowing for greater droplet break-up, and provide adequate emulsion stability. Further testing of these emulsions was performed within biphasic saponification and transesterification reactions, such as those commonly employed in the production of soap and biodiesel. It was hypothesised that by reducing the dispersed oil phase droplet size in the presence of an emulsifier, and thus increasing the surface area to volume ratio, reaction rates could be manipulated. Testing of this hypothesis showed that despite the presence of surfactant and, {{in the case of the}} transesterification reaction, water, the use of sub-micron oil droplets caused a decrease in the overall reaction time (time spent at reaction temperature and under agitation). In support of this work, high-throughput formulation (HT) and design of experiment (DoE) software was adopted to allow a quick and efficient way of screening which emulsification parameters had the greatest impact on the size of the droplets when emulsifying oil. For this work a standard emulsion containing silicone oil and Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulfate (SLES) was used. Following the identification of the optimum emulsification parameter set, work focused on the scaling up from small scale (50 g) to pilot plant scale mixing devices (10 kg – 300 kg/hour) in order to formulate large quantities of emulsion. It was shown that the HT screening and DoE was sufficiently robust to predict emulsification parameters at scale. For an emulsion system of silicone oil and SLES, the formulation parameters that created an emulsion with the smallest droplet size using the high-throughput platform, also produced an emulsion with the smallest droplet size using the new pilot plant scale Ultra Mixing and Processing Facility (UMPF) fitted with CDDM technology. In order to characterise the emulsions created, laser diffraction measurements were used throughout this work (Malvern Mastersizer X & 2000) and “side by side” emulsification experiments were carried out using commercially available fluid processing units.

40|$|Tutorialpg. 59 This {{tutorial}} {{will present}} {{an overview of}} the operation and design of steam turbines used for driving reactor and boiler feed pumps, called a boiler feed pump turbine (BFPT). Overall, these turbines are designed {{in much the same way}} as other mechanical drive turbines; however, there are characteristics to these units that make them unique to this application. A feed pump turbine must be integrated and completely compatible with the pump and the main turbine generator (TG) unit because these pieces of equipment are so interrelated. One of the most unique features of these turbines is their ability to operate from two separate and very different steam supplies. To accommodate these steam sources, two separate inlets must be used, each with its own special characteristics. The high pressure (HP) inlet has a separate steam chest designed to accept the boiler pressure. This inlet will feed a nozzle block that has an arc of admission of 25 percent or less. The low pressure (LP) inlet generally utilizes approximately 50 percent of the arc and has a much larger flow passing area. This type of turbine varies in output across the operating range of the plant. There are two basic operating cycles. The two pump operating cycle usually runs between 40 percent and 110 percent main unit load (MUL), this operation is achieved by using all LP steam. The one pump operating cycle, startup to approximately 65 percent MUL, uses both steam sources. The percent of each is determined by the load required, as well as the LP steam conditions. As the load increases on the TG main unit, the LP pressure supply to the BFPT increases, the HP steam is used to start up the BFPT unit and supplemented by the LP steam source to achieve the required load. There are numerous other factors beside modes of operation to consider when designing a boiler feed pump turbine. These include the speed and power requirements of the pump, steam characteristics from the main unit and boiler, and exhaust pressure. From a mechanical perspective there are a number of design features available on the style turbine to consider for maintaining reliability. The most obvious design feature is the single flow versus double flow design. The rotating component of the turbine, the rotor, is the key for maintaining reliability. It consists of an integrally forged shaft, blades with various styles of fastening, and shrouds or blade covers. The blades have either an axial or radial entry design root to secure them to the disk portion of the shaft. Shrouding also has multiple variations. It can be riveted, integral, integral with wire, or an integral interlocking design. Stationary elements consist of the diaphragms and labyrinth seals. The diaphragms direct the flow between the rotating blade rows. All boiler feed pump turbines have two journal bearings and a thrust bearing. In most cases tilting pad journal bearings are used because of their inherent stability and damping characteristics. Thrust bearings are mostly the standard double acting type. Controlling the steam flow to the turbine is done with the valve operating gear assembly. This assembly consists of simple linkage arrangement that controls the lift of the diffuser valves feeding the low pressure chest and the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>valve.</b> The entire assembly is raised and lowered by an oil controlled servo motor.

The results show that, the relative angle set as 180 ° can obtain the largest decompression pressure when steam flows through porous shrouded valve core, while the turbulence degree is the lowest. Setting one orifice plate can decrease the turbulent dissipation rate. The plate thickness has less influence on throttling effects. For ensuring the outlet flux, plate holes with smaller diameters should be chosen with a better flowing property on thermodynamic parameters.

40|$|A {{multi-stage}} <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> reducing <b>valve</b> (MSHPRV) is proposed. It {{can achieve}} a multi-stage <b>pressure</b> reducing way. <b>Valve</b> failure mainly occurs under <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> and <b>high</b> temperature conditions, {{thus it is}} necessary to investigate the strength of MSHPRV under those complex conditions. In this paper, the mathematical model of MSHPRV is established and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method is employed to simulate its flow fields and thermo-mechanical stress. Next, the stress of MSHPRV under different opening time and the fatigue damage of MSHPRV under different valve openings are studied. Finally, two changes are provided on geometry of MSHPRV and the geometrical factors are optimized. The results show that, the radial direction from inner wall to outer wall is the main heat transfer direction for valve body. At opening time 50 s, the working condition of MSHPRV is dangerous condition. Meanwhile, the maximum value of thermal stress is 487 MPa, which is located at the upper end face of valve chamber region B 3. There is a lag effect of stress distribution with respect to temperature distribution. The combined stress of valve body is composed of thermal stress and mechanical stress, in which thermal stress holds the dominant position. Moreover, with the increasing of valve opening, the fatigue damage of valve body increases correspondingly. It can be concluded that MSHPRV can cope with complex conditions like <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> and <b>high</b> temperature. In the optimization design of MSHPRV, it can be found that the best strength of MSHPRV is achieved with such geometrical factors as angle 15, diameter 4 mm and 2 stage plates.
