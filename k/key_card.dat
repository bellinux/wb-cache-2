5|$|The multi-coloured Personalised card is {{available}} on registration. The name and, if opted, {{a photo of the}} holder are imprinted on the cards. They can function automatically as a Child, Adult, or Elder card by recognising the cardholder's age stored on the card, hence accounting for different concessionary fares. As of 2003, there were 380,000 holders of Personalised Octopus cards. In addition to all the functions of an ordinary card, this card {{can be used as a}} <b>key</b> <b>card</b> for access to residential and office buildings. If a Personalised card is lost, the holder may report the loss by phone to prevent unauthorised use of the card. A refund would then be issued to the holder of the card for the deposit and the value that remained on the card three hours after the loss is reported, minus a HK$30 card cost and a HK$20 handling fee.|$|E

50|$|Computerized {{authentication}} systems, such as <b>key</b> <b>cards,</b> raise privacy concerns, {{since they}} enable computer surveillance of each entry. RFID <b>cards</b> and <b>key</b> fobs {{are becoming increasingly}} popular due to their ease of use. Many modern households have installed digital locks that make use of <b>key</b> <b>cards,</b> in combination with biometric fingerprint and keypad PIN options. Offices have also slowly installed digital locks that integrate with <b>key</b> <b>cards</b> and biometric technology.|$|R

2500|$|Stallman {{refers to}} mobile phones as [...] "portable {{surveillance}} and tracking devices", {{and says he}} refuses to own a cell phone until there's one that runs entirely on free software. He also avoids using a <b>key</b> <b>card</b> to enter his office building since <b>key</b> <b>card</b> systems track each location and time that someone enters the building using a card. According to Stallman, {{with the exception of}} a few sites, such as his own website or sites related to his work with GNU and the FSF, he usually does not browse the web directly from his personal computer in order to prevent being connected with his browsing history. Instead, he uses GNU Womb's grab-url-from-mail utility, which can run on a separate system, and act as an email-based proxy to web sites - the user sends an e-mail which the script receives, the remote system downloads the web page content, then the script emails the user the web page content. [...] More recently he stated that he accesses all web sites via Tor, except for Wikipedia (which generally disallows editing from Tor).|$|E
2500|$|Leo, {{known as}} [...] is the lively and blundering twin brother of Luna. He plays a [...] "Morphtronic" [...] deck ("D-Former" [...] in the Japanese version), with {{transforming}} monsters that have different abilities in attack and defense position, and his <b>key</b> <b>card</b> is Power Tool Dragon. He idolizes both Yusei and Jack and is always looking after his sister Luna. During a life-or-death battle against Aporia, Leo's desire to protect Luna makes him {{the sixth and}} final Signer, with the Mark of the Crimson Dragon's Heart. He also comes into possession of the true form of Power Tool Dragon, Life Stream Dragon, {{which is also a}} Synchro Tuner monster which Yusei can use to summon out his strongest monster, Shooting Quasar Dragon. At the end of the series, Leo and Luna both leave New Domino City to be with their parents. He also begins his career as a Turbo Duelist and starts to participate in Duel Circuits.|$|E
2500|$|... is a {{young man}} {{who grew up in the}} Satellite. When he travels to New Domino City in order to {{retrieve}} his Stardust Dragon from Jack Atlas, he soon discovers that he is a Signer, a person chosen to bear the mark of the Crimson Dragon. While he initially bears the mark of the Crimson Dragon's tail, it is replaced with the Dragon Head following his battle with Goodwin. Yusei is a cool, attractive, calm and collected duelist who believes no card is useless, and is admired by many people. He values his friends above all. Yusei uses a Junk Deck which focuses on managing small monsters of various levels in order to summon out powerful Synchro Monsters, such as Junk Warrior. His <b>key</b> <b>card</b> is Stardust Dragon and he later obtains two further evolutions: the powerful Majestic Star Dragon and the Accel Synchro monster, Shooting Star Dragon. At the end of the series, he is able to perform a Limit Over Accel Synchro to summon his strongest monster, Shooting Quasar Dragon. At the end of the series, he becomes a scientist and remains in New Domino City to look after the place everyone will return to when they fulfill their dreams. Yusei is the most powerful Duelist/Turbo Duelist in the series of Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's.|$|E

50|$|Roman <b>Key</b> <b>Card</b> Blackwood (RKCB) {{has largely}} {{replaced}} the standard version among tournament players. It {{developed from the}} Roman Blackwood variant (see below). According to RKCB there are five equivalent key cards rather than just the four aces: the trump king is counted as the 5th <b>key</b> <b>card.</b> The <b>key</b> <b>card</b> replies to 4NT are more compressed than standard ones and they also begin to locate the queen of trumps.|$|E

50|$|The enemy base {{consists}} of three different buildings, with multiple floors (including basement levels) within them. The player uses <b>key</b> <b>cards</b> and other items to unlock doors and explore new areas. Each door will only open to its corresponding <b>key</b> <b>cards.</b> Information {{can be obtained by}} rescuing hostages being held within the buildings. After rescuing five hostages, the player's rank will increase by one star (with the maximum rank being four stars), allowing for increased carrying capacity and maximum health. However, if a hostage is killed, the player is demoted to the previous rank.|$|R

5000|$|However, {{some experts}} favour the {{following}} responses, analogous to Roman <b>Key</b> <b>Card</b> Blackwood: ...|$|E
5000|$|Two {{versions}} of Blackwood are common: [...] "standard" [...] Blackwood, developed by Easley in 1933, and [...] "Roman Key Card" [...] Blackwood (RKC or RKCB), {{named for the}} Italian team which invented it. Standard Blackwood enables one partner to count partnership aces and kings in general. <b>Key</b> <b>card</b> variants are defined by a particular [...] "key" [...] suit and enable counting the trump king and queen, as well as aces and kings. Both versions are initiated by a bid of four notrump (4NT), and the entire family of conventions may be called Blackwood 4NT in both versions, or <b>Key</b> <b>Card</b> 4NT in the <b>key</b> <b>card</b> variation.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the <b>key</b> <b>card</b> lock was {{electrified}} with LEDs that detected the holes.|$|E
50|$|A {{half-way house}} between {{standard}} Blackwood and RKCB is Keycard Blackwood. Again {{there are five}} <b>key</b> <b>cards,</b> including the trump king, but unlike RKCB, the queen of trumps is not considered.|$|R
50|$|Uses a red Tri-Dragon Deity/Ultimate Dragon based deck. Unlike other forms, Zero the Ultimate is Rei himself. However, he flashes {{to other}} Zeros, Eris, or Kiriga when playing their <b>key</b> <b>cards.</b>|$|R
50|$|This is {{advocated}} by Bernard Magee as being simpler for club players, as with RKCB players are sometimes unsure whether partner holds 0 or 3 <b>key</b> <b>cards,</b> or 1 or 4.|$|R
5000|$|The {{electronic}} organizer may instead {{announce that}} the new room is locked, and thus ask if the player has a <b>key</b> <b>card.</b> If the player does have one, (s)he can select [...] "Yes" [...] and move into the new room. If not, (s)he cannot enter. As soon as one player has unlocked a locked room with the <b>key</b> <b>card,</b> the furniture is put in and the room remains unlocked {{for the remainder of}} the game.|$|E

50|$|Server {{licensing}} {{on early}} versions of NetWare 286 {{was accomplished by}} using a <b>key</b> <b>card.</b> The <b>key</b> <b>card</b> was designed for an 8-bit ISA bus, and had a serial number encoded on a ROM chip. The serial number had to match the serial number of the NetWare software running on the server. To broaden the hardware base, particularly to machines using the IBM MCA bus, later versions of NetWare 2.x did not require the key card; serialised license floppy disks were used {{in place of the}} key cards.|$|E
