5|$|Following his {{freshman}} college season, McKee {{qualified for the}} 1972 U.S. Olympic team despite recovering from a bout of mononucleosis. At the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany, he represented the United States in three different events. Most memorably, McKee won a silver medal in the men's 400-meter individual medley in the closest swimming decision in Olympic history, losing {{by a margin of}} two one-thousandths (0.002) of a second to Sweden's Gunnar Larsson. Initially, the scoreboard showed that Larsson and McKee had tied with an official time of 4:31.98, but in a controversial decision, the event judges named Larsson the eventual gold medal-winner ten minutes after the race was over—Larsson's <b>electronic</b> <b>clock</b> time was 4:31.981, McKee's 4:31.983. The time difference was variously calculated as one-tenth of the time of a typical blink of a human eye, and the distance as the thickness of a coat of paint, a sheet of paper, or the minor imperfections in the individual lanes of the Olympic pool. As a result of the controversy, the international swimming federation, FINA, subsequently clarified the timing rules for competition swimming; international races are now required to be timed to the hundredth of a second, and timing to the thousandth of a second is prohibited for tie-breakers. It was the first and only Olympic swimming event ever decided on the basis of thousandths of a second. Afterward, McKee attributed his second-place finish to a tactical mistake: he looked over his shoulder to see where Larsson was in the final leg of the race.|$|E
25|$|On 16 April 1979, BBC2 {{adopted the}} world's first computer-generated ident, with the logo being drawn live {{every time it}} was played. This version of the 2 had orange double lines either side and the 2 itself was cream double lined. This stripy 2 had been used on {{promotions}} and holding slides for years prior to its launch, {{and now it was}} part of a bigger branding package. For the first few years of the ident, it would be accompanied by a fanfare as it scrolled onto the screen. There were versions of the ident where the ident scrolled on, scrolled off and remained static. The clock used alongside this high tec 3D ident, was anything but. The old clock filmed from the NODD room survived, with a new 2D logo and sporting black and orange colours.

50|$|The {{mechanical}} {{clock was}} abandoned in December 1981 {{in favour of}} a computerised clock - except in Wales, which retained the mechanical clock until 1985, making it the last BBC1 mechanical clock. A rebranding happened the same year.It was the longest running clock of 1974 and 1985 in Wales and was the last region to adopt the computerised clock and preserved the polo dot. Following BBC2's rebrand to the electronic striped 2 ident, technicians started working on an <b>electronic</b> <b>clock</b> to accompany the new look, and following its completion it was this that replaced the mechanical version. The new clock featured a single uniform line thickness all the way round, except at 12, 3, 6 and 9 where the lines were doubled. The polo mint centre was also removed in favour of a central dot.|$|E

50|$|Before {{the common}} use of <b>electronic</b> <b>clocks</b> in {{automobile}}s, automobile clocks had mechanical movements, powered by an electric remontoire.

Such clocks were, however, notoriously inaccurate, typically being made as cheaply as possible.|$|R
50|$|The clock which {{accompanied}} {{this new}} look {{was located in}} the BBC Two Noddy room and comprised an orange clock face with counters of ever increasing thickness and with a 'polo' mint centre upon a black background. A plain orange and white 2D striped '2' logo was placed below the clock. The use of this old clock {{was due to the}} fact that the technology did not exist for an electronic timepiece, and would not until 1980, when an electronic timepiece was finally obtained for BBC2. This new <b>electronic</b> <b>clock</b> had no second hand judder and had a changed design, featuring two dashes at the quarter hours and single dashes elsewhere. The polo mint centre was abandoned in favour of a simple centre dot, and the 3D striped '2' logo adorned the bottom of the screen, although it was unanimated.|$|E
5000|$|The {{stadium is}} located {{approximately}} 400 m {{from the west}} side of the Lana stream and of former exhibition site [...] "Shqiperia Sot" [...] (now Top-Channel Television headquarters). It was built in 1956 and named Dinamo Stadium until 1991 when it was given its new name. The Football Association of Albania and KF Tirana decided posthumously name the stadium after the eminent KF Tirana player, coach and president, Selman Stërmasi. The stadium has recently ended a long phase of construction, which involved development of the main pitch, central seated area, facilities around the ground and general lineaments. There are still improvements expected to be made, such as side seated areas, an <b>electronic</b> <b>clock</b> and a KF Tirana shopping centre just under the central seated stand. The internal facilities include a press conference room. The main parking area is located at the front of the stadium which leads to the entrance.|$|E

50|$|In {{mechanical}} clocks, the low Q of {{the balance}} wheel or pendulum oscillator made them very sensitive to the disturbing effect of the impulses of the escapement, so the escapement had a great effect on {{the accuracy of the}} clock, and many escapement designs were tried.

50|$|The {{church is}} in the form of a nave and two aisles with a {{transept}} and three apses. It is 40 metres long, 27 metres wide and has a height of 25 metres to the lantern, which is surmounted by a bronze statue of the archangel Gabriel, also interpreted, in spite of the absence of the weaponry with which that archangel is usually represented, as Michael.The initiative for building the great church came from Camillo Francesco Carrara, O.F.M.Cap., titular bishop of Agathopolis, who was the first Apostolic Vicar of Eritrea. A large inscription in the church honours the principal donors who contributed to the cost of the building. They include Benito Mussolini and other leading figures in Italian political life. The painting by Carlo Maratta (1625-1713) behind the high altar, representing the Assumption of Mary, was a gift from King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy.Work on the freestanding 52-metre high bell tower began later and was completed in 1925 after the death (on 15 June 1924) of Bishop Carrara. It contains eight bells (an octave from A to A) cast from Austro-Hungarian guns captured in the First World War. The largest weighs 3.8 tons.

40|$|Economic theory {{suggests}} that different auction systems may lead to different price equilibria under specific conditions. By changing the trading rules, the introduction of <b>electronic</b> <b>clock</b> auction systems (ECAS) on primary fish markets is likely to modify the price formation process. A relationship between the prices of live prawns (Nephrops norvegicus) in two French ports where different ECAS have been successively introduced is estimated through two univariate models and a vector autoregressive model applied to stationary weekly data series. Using a recent multiple break searching procedure (Econometrica, Vol. 66, 1998, 47; Journal of Applied Econometrics, Vol. 18, 2003, 1; Econometrics Journal, Vol. 6, 2003, 72), a single structural change matching the date of implementation is discovered in the two ports and shows a different impact partly explained {{by the type of}} auction system in force.
