However, because it neglects the effect of dissolved gas, which may be released during evaporation process and remains in gaseous state there after, the simulated wake flow pattern deviates slightly from the experimental data. The original model is now revised to account for the effect of <b>incondensable</b> <b>gas</b> that is released from the dissolved condition.

40|$|Vessels {{operating}} under vacuum, such as vacuum pans and final effect evaporators, require a vacuum pump to remove incondensable gasses that accumulate within the vessel. The vacuum pumps {{need to be}} sized to remove incondensable gasses from four possible sources: those that enter with the feed into the vessel, direct leaks from the atmosphere into the vessel, dissolved and entrained gas that is released from injection water used in direct contact condensers, and gas that is contained in steam vented into the vessel body. It is often necessary to discover why a process vessel is unable to maintain the design vacuum. If the condenser is capable of adequately cooling the gas stream entering the vacuum pump, an inability to maintain the design vacuum within the vessel is an indicator of either insufficient pump capacity or excessive quantity of <b>incondensable</b> <b>gas.</b> To diagnose {{the cause of the}} problem, pump performance can be checked by measuring the performance of the vacuum pump, off-line, using a simple test rig, whilst the possibility of excessive quantities of gas are normally investigated only by using a standard vacuum test on an empty vessel to estimate the quantity of the air leakage into the vessel. As an alternative to off-line pump testing and the conventional vacuum test for leaks, a measurement of the quantity of <b>incondensable</b> <b>gas</b> being discharged from the vacuum pump during normal operation provides a very useful diagnostic test. The test provides a direct measure of the load (of <b>incondensable</b> <b>gas)</b> on the pump whilst also providing a single point on the pump curve and thus can give an instantaneous indication of the reason for the inability to maintain the design vacuum. A simple method of performing this measurement is described...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a method to}} {{evaluate}} the expansion of condensing steam in presence of <b>incondensable</b> <b>gases</b> is presented. The expansion of such a mixture involves thermodynamic processes very different from those related {{to the expansion of}} pure steam (as it happens in conventional steam power plants) or to the expansion of a gaseous mixture without steam condensation (as it happens in gas turbine power plants, combined and mixed cycles). In this paper these thermodynamic processes are investigated and an evaluating method is developed. In particular using this method it is possible to evaluate the excess turbine back pressure, that is the pressure increase with respect to the steam saturation pressure, and the specific expansion work of the mixture. The proposed method is then applied in order to evaluate the performance of an hydrogen/oxygen (fuel/oxidiser) cycle, where the presence of <b>incondensable</b> <b>gases</b> into condensing steam is unavoidable owing to the processes that give H 2 from fossil fuels and O 2 from air. The results of the developed investigation confirm that the presence of <b>incondensable</b> <b>gases</b> can not be neglected for a realistic evaluation of H 2 /O 2 cycle performance...|$|R

Bio-oil {{production}} from pyrolysis of 0. 15 - 0. 5 mm and 1 - 2 mm palm kernel shell (PKS) {{has been investigated}} in a fluidized bed reactor under the nitrogen gas flow rate of 25 L(NTP) /min, with reactor temperature of 450 °C.

A diffusive model able to deal with ternary mixtures has been developed. An entire section is devoted to the validation of this model, addressing laminar flow in forced convection and taking as reference analytical solutions. Then, a comparison between air-steam-hydrogen and air-steam-helium mixtures has been performed. Good agreement between the two mixtures properties was found in relation to the total heat flux and the condensing mass flux, showing that the substitution of hydrogen with helium (which is usually made in experimental facilities) grants a really good approximation. Finally, the validation of a turbulent model for the mentioned ternary mixtures was performed. This step allows to compare the code results with reference experimental data, which come from the COPAIN program, selecting the cases in which the forced convection phenomena are dominant. The analysis of the results has shown a good behavior of the diffusive model, pointing out some limitations of the adopted turbulent model...|$|E
40|$|A {{model for}} {{simulating}} {{the process of}} growth, collapse and rebound of a cavitation bubble travelling along the flow through a convergent-divergent nozzle producing a cavitating water jet is established. The model {{is based on the}} Rayleigh-Plesset bubble dynamics equation using as inputs ambient pressure and velocity profiles calculated with the aid of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) flow modelling. A variable time-step technique is applied to solve the highly nonlinear second-order differential equation. This technique successfully solves the Rayleigh-Plesset equation for wide ranges of pressure variation and bubble original size and saves considerable computing time. Inputs for this model are the pressure and velocity data from CFD calculation. To simulate accurately the process of bubble growth, collapse and rebound, a heat transfer model, which includes the effects of conduction plus radiation, is developed to describe the thermodynamics of the <b>incondensable</b> <b>gas</b> inside the bubble. This heat transfer model matches previously published experimental data well. Assuming that single bubble behaviour also applies to bubble clouds, the calculated distance from the nozzle exit travelled by the bubble {{to the point where the}} bubble size becomes invisible is taken to be equal to the bubble cloud length observed. The predictions are compared with experiments carried out in a cavitation cell and show good agreement for different nozzles operating at different pressure conditions...|$|E

Both flashing flows and non- flashing flows of liquid and <b>incondensable</b> <b>gases</b> have been considered. The present paper shows that for flashing flows good predictions are obtained by using the two-phase valve discharge coefficient defined by Lenzing and multiplying it by the critical flow rate in an ideal nozzle evaluated by either Omega Method or the Homogeneous Non-equilibrium Direct Integration.

In relation to safety, accumulators are {{one example of}} vital passive systems strictly needed to mitigate consequences of Large Break LOCA. In relation to design, the configurations of both PWR and BWR primary system is based on natural circulation: the mutual positions of core and steam generators {{in the case of}} PWR and the elevation of the feedwater nozzle in the BWR vessel are determined to ensure (at least) removal of decay heat when active systems – noticeably, centrifugal pumps – are not available. Immediately after the Chernobyl accident in 1986, the passive systems received new attention by industry and scientists.

This pilot unit consisted of six vertical fixed bed reactors in parallel, {{each with a}} capacity of 12 kg GST. Thermolysis proceeded in a normal air atmosphere. The solid (char), liquid (tyre-derived oil [TDO]) and gaseous products generated at each temperature were characterised. The <b>incondensable</b> <b>gas</b> fraction was used to produce electricity via a gas turbine. The yields of the gas, TDO and char fractions were 15 – 22 wt. %, 34 – 46 wt. % and 39 – 44 wt. % respectively, values that represent major recoveries from the GST feedstock. The TDOs were mainly a mixture of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons and had very high GCVs (41 – 43 MJ/kg), {{higher than those of}} conventional liquid fuels. A large increase was seen in the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon content above 550 °C. The non-condensable gases obtained had a high GCV value (64 – 83 MJ/Nm 3), and produced 4. 1 – 6. 5 kWh electricity/g of GST in a gas turbine. The chars had a GCV of 27 – 28 MJ/kg, high ash (17 – 21 wt. %) and zinc contents, and an essentially macroporous texture with a low BET surface area (46 – 78 m 2 /g).

40|$|The sizing of {{emergency}} relief vents to mitigate runaway chemical reactions in batch or semi-batch reactors {{is important for}} the protection of the workers and the process unit. This has been a preoccupation in industry for many years and different design methods have been proposed depending on the type of system (gassy, vapor, or hybrid) and the flow characteristics of the reacting fluid. Industry needs simple, reliable and accurate sizing methods so as not to undersize nor oversize the vent area. In the present work, runaway reactions in two chemical systems were studied experimentally with various apparatuses in volumes from 30 µl up to 10 liters (DSC, PHI-TEC I, ARSST, VSP 2, Vent Sizing Simulator, 800 ml reactor, and the standard 10 liter vessel used for the United Nations test for sizing rupture disks for vessels containing self-reactive materials). The two systems were the decomposition of a solution of DiButylPeroxide in butyrate and the esterification of acetic anhydride by methanol. The first system is virtually purely gassy, meaning that the overpressure in the vessel during runaway is produced by <b>incondensable</b> <b>gas</b> while the second is purely vapor, meaning that the overpressure is due to the vapor pressure of the reaction mass as the temperature rises. The data recorded were used to determine the A/V ratio for the emergency relief vent or rupture disk for a 1 m 3 vessel. Two categories of sizing methods were used. The similarity method was employed, whereby the A/V ratio is directly determined experimentally for a given set of conditions, with three reactors : 0. 11, 0, 8 and 10 liters. The calculation method was based on the DIERS approach and was employed using the data from bench-scale pseudo-adiabatic calorimeters.

When the measured wall temperature increased abruptly and could not hold a steady state, which indicated that a dry-out phenomenon occurred on the wall, the heating power supply was instantly switched off. Then, the run was restarted from the former steady heating power, and the power was then increased in an increment of 1 % of the former power.

40|$|A {{critical}} {{component in the}} assessment of long-term risk from geologic sequestration of CO 2 is the ability to predict mineralogical and geochemical changes within storage reservoirs due to rock-brine-CO 2 reactions. Impurities and/or other constituents selected for co-sequestration can affect both the chemical and physical (e. g. density, viscosity, interfacial tension) behavior of CO 2 in the deep subsurface. These impurities and concentrations are a function of both the industrial source(s) of the CO 2, as well as the carbon capture technology used to extract the CO 2 and produce a concentrated stream for geologic sequestration. This report summarizes the relative concentrations of CO 2 and other constituents in exhaust gases from major non-energy related industrial sources of CO 2.

40|$|Results of an {{experimental}} investigation on {{the feasibility of}} propagating a smoldering front in reaction-trailing mode throughout an oil shale semicoke porous medium are reported. For oil recovery applications, this mode is particularly interesting to avoid low-temperature oxidation reactions, which appear simultaneously with organic matter devolatilization in the reaction-leading mode and are responsible for oxidation of part of the heavy oil. The particularity of this mode is that, contrary to the reaction-leading mode largely studied in the literature, the heat-transfer layer precedes the combustion layer. This leads to two separated high-temperature zones: (i) a devolatilization zone (free of oxygen), where the organic matter is thermally decomposed to <b>incondensable</b> <b>gases,</b> heavy oil, andfixed carbon, also called coke in the literature, without any oxidation, followed by (ii) an oxidation zone, where thefixed carbon left by devolatilization is oxidized. The transition from reaction-leading to reaction-trailing mode was obtained using low oxygen contents in the fed air. It is shown that two distinct layers, the heat-transfer layer and the combustion layer, propagate in a stable and repeatable way. The decrease of the oxygen fraction leads to a decrease of the smoldering temperature and to strongly limit the decarbonation of the mineral matrix. The CO 2 emissions are limited. Regardless of the front temperature, all of the fed oxygen is consumed and all of thefixed carbon is oxidized at {{the passage of the}} smoldering front...|$|R

This water suppression tank (VVPSS) is so aiming at limiting the maximum pressure in the VV to 0. 2. MPa during in-vessel coolant leak events and at maintaining the VV long-term pressure below atmospheric pressure during air or <b>incondensable</b> <b>gases</b> ingress, through the Direct Contact Condensation (DCC).

The main focus {{is to determine the}} properties of the microbubble and relate them to the initiation and dynamics of the observed microplasma. Microplasma in liquid began to draw researchers? attention in recent decades because of its low energy input, micron scale size and nanosecond scale duration. The understanding of plasma discharges in gases has been well established; however, the mechanism of plasma initiation in liquid is still unclear. Several theories were proposed to provide different explanations of this mechanism, but none of them have been proven exclusively correct. Results here show that the generation of a microplasma needs higher energy than the generation of a microbubble from the same discharges. This supports the theory that during the microplasma initiation a lower density gaseous site is generated before the microplasma and the microplasma exists inside a microbubble. The typical form of a plasma and bubbles in liquid reported in literature are branch-like structures. Here we report spherical microplasma and microbubble afforded by relatively lower energy input, and it was found that for branched bubbles increasing the ambient pressure was able to reduce the microbubble size and eliminate its branches. The dynamics of the spherical bubbles could be modeled with a customized Rayleigh-Plesset model considering both condensable and <b>incondensable</b> <b>gases</b> in the bubble, the initial neutral temperature and neutral pressure were estimated to be as high as 550 K and 1. 2 GPa...|$|R
40|$|Synthetic Natural Gas (SNG) from biomass {{gasification}} {{is viewed}} as a promising option for production of transport fuels. A major problem associated is the removal of contaminants derived from the gasification step, such as tars. Tars are aromatic compounds, usually between 1 and 5 rings, which at 350 ˚C already start to condensate, causing clogging and blockage of components. Catalytic tar conversion presents advantages compared to other technologies and in particular it allows thermal integration with the gasification step, lowering the thermodynamic losses, and enables the use of the energy contained in the tars by converting them into usable gases, such as H 2 and CO. Catalyst deactivation can be caused by coke deposits. A novel technique named Chemical-looping reforming (CLR), based on Chemical-looping combustion concept (CLC), is being developed in Chalmers University of Technology to tackle this problem. It is based in a two reactor system, one Fuel reactor (FR) and an Air reactor (AR). In the FR the tars are oxidized due to the reduction of the catalyst. In the AR the catalyst is newly oxidized and the coke deposits are combusted.

40|$|The need of {{producing}} energy from renewable resources {{has brought in}} the course of time to the development of several “clean” technologies. Pyrolysis-based energy densification processes of biomass residues are more and more becoming an interesting route for bio-oil production. Pyrolysis is the chemical decomposition of organic materials, i. e. biomass, by application of heat in the absence of oxygen. During pyrolysis processes, biomass is converted into a solid fraction (char), a liquid phase (tar) and <b>incondensable</b> <b>gases</b> (e. g. hydrogen, methane, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide). The high heating values of these fractions are usually exploited to produce energy. The chemical characterization of the pyrolysis products, and in particular of tar components, is usually a list of very different substances, that usually are more harmful than the biomass feed. Thus, the safety of pyrolysis prcesses may be affected by the possible harm of the products formed. As a matter of facts, accidental conditions occurring in a pyrolysis process may lead to the undesired dispersion of these products, whose effects on humans and environment have to be quantified. Moreover, the actual understanding of the inherent hazards of bio-fuels with respect to conventional fuels should be a core issue for the sustainability assessment of bio-energy processes. The aim of the present study is the development of a specific approach to characterize the hazard of the products formed during pyrolysis processes. Conventional experimental protocols were applied to screen the possible pyrolysis products. A specific methodology based on toxicological, physical and chemical parameters was then applied for the assessment of the hazard due to these products.

40|$|AbstractThe {{next step}} for many CO 2 capture {{technologies}} {{is to move}} to commercial scale [1]. Without the experience {{that can only be}} gained through pilot plants, CCS will not become a commercially viable proposition due to unresolved technical challenges and uncertain cost estimations. Individual demonstration projects need to be at a scale that is sufficiently large to be representative of commercial operation. One of these individual projects was carried out by Fundación Ciudad de la Energía (CIUDEN), who successfully completed the full CO 2 capture process in its Technology Development Centre for CO 2 Capture and Transport using oxycombustion in Circulating Fluidized Bed (CFB) boiler and a cryogenic CO 2 Compression and Purification Unit (CPU). Focused on the CIUDEŃs CPU, this paper describes the unit designed by Air Liquide, their sub-units in which the CO 2 composition is increased to achieve the design value of > 99. 0 % v in the liquefied product stream and a final case study based on an empirical mass balance; considering this data, in addition to the CO 2 purity, a mass balance provides the recovery rate value; this last parameter was lower than the expected value. Studying the specific behaviour of each subunit, it is concluded that the warm-part of the CPU presents a recovery rate higher than 99 % whereas the cold part of the unit (expansion and distillation columns to remove NOx and <b>incondensable</b> <b>gases)</b> obtained an average value of 60 %, generated mainly because the CO 2 composition in the inlet of the CPU was lower than 70 % v w/b (design value). This was due to higher N 2 content in the flue gas. Considering these results, the conclusions are very clear that air infiltration must be minimised. It also demonstrates the necessity of increasing the quantity of operating hours on demonstration plants such as CIUDEN in order to further optimise the technology with the end goal of improving the business case for CCS...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{pyrolysis}} of pine wood sawdust {{was carried}} out by microwave heating at ca. 470 degrees C under dynamic nitrogen atmosphere. Eight inorganic additives (NaOH, Na 2 CO 3, Na 2 SiO 3, NaCl, TiO 2, HZSM- 5, H 3 PO 4, Fe- 2 (SO 4) (3)) were investigated in terms of their catalytic effects on the pyrolysis. All of the eight additives have increased yields of solid products greatly and decreased yields of gaseous products more or less. Yields of liquid products have not subjected to dramatic change. The <b>incondensable</b> <b>gases</b> produced from pyrolysis consist mainly of H- 2, CH 4, CO and CO 2. All of the eight additives have made these gases evolve earlier, among which the four sodium additives have the most marked effect. All the additives have made the amount of CH 4 and CO 2 decrease, while all of them except NaCl, TiO 2 and Fe- 2 (SO 4) (3) have made that of H- 2 increase and all of them except Na 2 SiO 3 and HZSM- 5 have made that of CO decrease. Alkaline sodium compounds NaOH, Na 2 CO 3 and Na 2 SiO 3 favor H- 2 formation most. The most abundant organic component in the liquid products from pyrolysis of untreated sample and samples treated by all the additives except H 3 PO 4 and Fe- 2 (SO 4) (3) is acetol. All the four sodium compounds favor acetol formation reaction and the selection increasing effect follows the order of NaOH > Na 2 CO 3 approximate to Na 2 SiO 3 > NaCl. TiO 2 goes against the formation of acetol, HZSM- 5 has no marked effect on acetol formation. The two dominant organic components identified in the liquid products from pyrolysis of H 3 PO 4 and Fe- 2 (SO 4) (3) treated samples are both fufural and 4 -methyl- 2 -methoxy-phenol. A possible pathway for acetol formation is tentatively proposed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{chemical}} binders {{used to make}} sand molds and cores thermally decompose {{and release}} gas when subjected to the high temperature conditions in sand casting processes. Computational models that predict {{the evolution of the}} binder gas are being introduced into casting simulations in order to better predict and eliminate gas defects in metal castings. These models require knowledge of the evolved binder gas mass and molecular weight as a function of temperature, but available gas evolution data are limited. In the present study, the mass and molecular weight of gas evolved from PUNB bonded sand are measured as a function of temperature for use with binder gas models. Thermogravimetric analysis of bonded sand is employed to measure the binder gas mass evolution as a function of temperature for heating rates experienced in molds and cores during casting. The volume and pressure of gas evolved from bonded sand are measured as a function of temperature in a specially designed quartz manometer during heating and cooling in a furnace. The results from these experiments are combined with the ideal gas law to determine the binder gas molecular weight as a function of temperature. Thermogravimetric analysis reveals that the PUNB binder significantly decomposes when heated to elevated temperatures, and the PUNB binder gas mass evolution is not strongly influenced by heating rate. During heating of PUNB bonded sand at a rate of 2 °C/min, the binder gas molecular weight rapidly decreases from 375 g/mol at 115 °C to 99. 8 g/mol at 200 °C. The molecular weight is relatively constant until 270 °C, after which it decreases to 47. 7 g/mol at 550 °C. The molecular weight then steeply decreases to 30. 3 g/mol at 585 °C and then steeply increases to 47. 2 g/mol at 630 °C, where it remains constant until 750 °C. Above 750 °C, the binder gas molecular weight gradually decreases to 33. 3 g/mol at 898 °C. The present measurements are consistent with the molecular weights calculated using the binder gas composition data from previous studies. The binder gas is composed of <b>incondensable</b> <b>gases</b> above 709 °C, and the binder gas partially condenses during cooling at 165 °C if the bonded sand is previously heated below 507 °C...|$|R
40|$|The {{north-western}} {{sector of}} Caviahue caldera (Argentina), {{close to the}} active volcanic system of Copahue, {{is characterized by the}} presence of several hydrothermal sites that host numerous fumarolic emissions, anomalous soil diffuse degassing of CO 2 and hot soils. In March 2014, measurements of soil CO 2 fluxes in 5 of these sites (namely, Las Máquinas, Las Maquinitas I, Las Maquinitas II, Anfiteatro, and Termas de Copahue) allowed an estimation that ~ 165 t of deeply derived CO 2 is daily released. The gas source is likely related to a relatively shallow geothermal reservoir containing a single vapor phase as also suggested by both the geochemical data from the 3 deep wells drilled in the 1980 s and gas geoindicators applied to the fumarolic discharges. Gas equilibria within the H-C-O gas system indicate the presence of a large, probably unique, single phase vapor zone at 200 - 210 °C feeding the hydrothermal manifestations of Las Máquinas, Las Maquinitas I and II and Termas de Copahue. A natural thermal release of 107 MW was computed by using CO 2 as a tracer of the original vapor phase. The magmatic signature of the <b>incondensable</b> fumarolic <b>gases,</b> the wide expanse of the hydrothermal areas and the remarkable high amount of gas and heat released by fluid expulsion seem to be compatible with an active magmatic intrusion beneath this portion of the Caviahue caldera...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{reports a}} {{fundamental}} {{study of the}} unassisted pyrolysis of wood using microwave energy {{for the production of}} bio-oils. The majority of previous work on the microwave pyrolysis of woody biomass to produce bio-oils has been performed in domestic type multimode cavity based microwaves ovens and has concluded that attaining temperatures required for pyrolysis (500 °C) is not possible due to the microwave transparent nature of the material. To overcome this, many researchers have resorted to adding microwave susceptible doping agents to stimulate heating of the wood through conductive heat transfer. Although this method generates overall process effects, it does not realise the unique heating characteristics that microwave energy may offer, such as volumetric and highly selective heating. An in-depth study of the effect of temperature on the dielectric properties concluded that at room temperature, wood is a relatively good microwave absorber with a loss tangent (tan δ) of 0. 20 at 2. 142 GHz compared to water which has a tan δ of 0. 15 under the same conditions. However, as temperature is increased, wood starts to become microwave transparent as the inherent moisture (the microwave significant material from a microwave heating point of view) evaporates causing a decrease in tan 15. Dielectric property results indicated that wood can be classified as a microwave transparent cellular matrix of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin containing a microwave absorbing phase (water). Selective heating of the bound water before evaporation may be used to heat the remaining bulk to pyrolysis temperatures of circa. 500 °C It has been demonstrated that the rate of heating has a marked effect on the microwave susceptibility of the wood above 300 °C. As heating rate increases, wood remains microwave responsive up to pyrolysis temperatures of 500 °C. At a heating rate of 2 °C/min, tan δ was measured at 0. 03 at 2. 142 GHz, whilst at a heating rate of 15 °C/min, tan δ increased more than six fold to 0. 19 under the same conditions. A TMo 1 n applicator was designed and fabricated for the pyrolysis of wood, based directly upon the dielectric properties of the wood feed. This, coupled with automatic tuning to minimise reflected power and increase energy efficiency, ensured a high bulk power density of ~ 108 W/m 3 with 1 kW of microwave power compared to a domestic microwave oven which would only generate ~ 104 W/m 3 in the wood under the same conditions. Such a high power density leads to a high heating rate which is required to overcome the decrease in tan 0 shown at lower heating rates in the earlier work. As opposed to the majority of literature, this work has categorically shown that the unassisted microwave pyrolysis of wood to produce bio-oil is technically feasible. This could lead to the full utilisation of the benefits of microwave heating and the unique heating gradients generated that may be beneficial for this process. To test the benefits microwave heating may offer, a matrix of batch pyrolysis tests was carried out to determine the effect of power density, particle size, moisture content and residence time on the yield of bio-oil, char and gas produced from pine and spruce samples. An increase in bulk power density from 1. 7 x 107 to 7. 5 x 107 W/m 3 increased bio-oil yield from 29 % to 55 %. A further increase in power density had no effect on the yield of bio-oil. This body of work showed that the dimensions and geometry of the sample are important factors affecting the yields of products produced. Even though microwave energy heats volumetrically, sample cooling is still constrained to conventional heat loss models (conduction, convection and radiation). Results showed that minimising heat loss and maximising bulk power density can lead to higher bio-oil yields. It was demonstrated that as residence time increased (using a constant power of 1 kW), the yield of bio-oil also increased from 13 % at 90 seconds to 39 % at 180 seconds. These results are the opposite to those observed from conventionally heated pyrolysis experiments as the longer residence promotes cracking of the bio-oil into <b>incondensable</b> <b>gases,</b> causing a decrease in bio-oil yield. This may lead to a potential benefit in utilising microwave heating in this process as expensive rapid quenchers need not be designed. From the particle size range tested, an optimum particle size of 25 mm was found to maximise bio-oil yield. This is much greater than the optimum particle size in conventionally heated pyrolysis (< 1 mm) and has major implications for the economics of scale up as projected comminution energy requirements are drastically reduced from around 800 kWhr/tonne to 50 kWhr/tonne.
