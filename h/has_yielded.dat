Howard Spindel, a leading expert on Shield nickels, notes that Shield nickel dies {{produced}} far fewer coins than other coin dies, as the dies wore out so fast that the Mint was continually under great pressure to produce new ones. According to Spindel, many dies were hastily and carelessly produced, producing numerous minor varieties.|$|E
5|$|Few dinosaur remains {{have been}} found in Scandinavia. The {{mainland}} of western Denmark is an unlikely region to find dinosaur remains, since the Mesozoic sediments there are marine Maastrichtian chalk. Fossils of non-dinosaurian marine animals, including mosasaurs and plesiosaurs, {{have been found}} in these deposits. Mesozoic deposits in Scania, Sweden, are much richer in fossils, including those of dinosaurs. The Danish island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea was part of the same land mass as Scania (the Scandinavian-Russian continent), and has a similar geology. The southwestern part of the island is the only place in Denmark which <b>has</b> <b>yielded</b> dinosaur remains.|$|E

5|$|Native Americans {{were present}} in lower Florida 10,000years ago, when ocean levels were low and Biscayne Bay was {{comparatively}} empty of water. Water levels rose from about 4000years ago and inundated the bay. Archeologists believe that any traces left by the peoples of that era are now submerged; none now exist on dry lands in the park. The Cutler Fossil Site, just {{to the west of}} the park, <b>has</b> <b>yielded</b> evidence of human occupation extending to at least 10000years before the present. The earliest evidence of human presence in Biscayne dates to about 2500years before the present, with piles of conch and whelk shells left by the Glades culture. The Glades culture was followed by the Tequesta people, who occupied the shores of Biscayne Bay. The Tequesta were a sedentary community living on fish and other sea life, with no significant agricultural activity. A site on Sands Key <b>has</b> <b>yielded</b> potsherds, worked shells and other artifacts indicating occupation from at latest 1000AD to about 1650, after contact was made with Europeans. A total of fifty significant archaeological sites have been identified in the park.|$|E
5|$|Potassium-argon (K-Ar) dating of the Miri summit <b>has</b> <b>yielded</b> {{an age of}} 200,000 years, and {{an older}} date (5,900,000 ± 2,800,000) has been {{obtained}} from the northwestern centre. Between the two are andesite dates of 5,630,000 ± 90,000 years and 2,390,000 ± 50,000 years. Although the last activity occurred during the Pleistocene (probably a large eruption), volcanism began earlier. The youngest date, obtained from K-Ar dating of pumice, is 90,000 ± 10,000 years. Koh-i-Sultan's Pleistocene activity is probably related {{to the formation of}} travertine deposits, which are mined.|$|E
5|$|Potassium-argon dating <b>has</b> <b>yielded</b> ages of 16,000 {{years ago}} for the Salton Buttes, later {{superseded}} by an age estimate of 33,000 ± 35,000 years ago and finally with a date of 2,480 ± 470 years before present {{on the basis of}} uranium-thorium dating. Despite this age, some of them still release steam. Cerro Prieto appears to be 108,000 ± 46,000 years old based on potassium-argon dating, but legends of native Cucupah people may indicate Holocene activity.|$|E

The older date refers to the Negriales lava field, which has also been dated at 400,000116,000 ± 26,000 years ago. The South Spur is dated at 150,000 ± 50,000 years ago. The main edifice started forming 260,000 ± 20,000 years ago. One {{andesite}} lava flow was dated at 51,000 ± 13,000 years ago by argon–argon dating.|$|E
5|$|Remains of Ferugliotherium {{come from}} two {{formations}} in the Late Cretaceous of southern Argentina, the Los Alamitos and La Colonia Formations. These and the Allen Formation (which <b>has</b> <b>yielded</b> Trapalcotherium) are all dated to the Campanian (84–71 million years ago) and/or Maastrichtian (71–66 million years ago), the penultimate and ultimate {{stages of the}} Cretaceous. The La Colonia Formation may be somewhat younger than the other two, while the Los Alamitos Formation has been considered Campanian, and can be dated to the Campanian or Maastrichtian {{on the basis of}} palynology. The Allen Formation is likely Maastrichtian, but not latest Maastrichtian.|$|E
5|$|The La Colonia Formation {{outcrops}} in north-central Chubut Province, and the mammalian fossils {{come from}} the Mirasol Chico valley. The formation includes fluvial (river), deep-sea, and near-shore deposits, and the mammalian fauna probably comes from an estuary, tidal flat, or coastal plain. The La Colonia Formation also contains dryolestoids, such as Coloniatherium and Reigitherium, {{as well as a}} ferugliotheriid and the putative multituberculate Argentodites. In addition, the La Colonia Formation <b>has</b> <b>yielded</b> fossils of a wide array of other animals, including crocodiles, plesiosaurs, lungfish (Ceratodus), and dinosaurs (including Carnotaurus).|$|E

5|$|Counsel for the {{petitioner}} {{discussed at}} great length from a sociological point of view, of the age-old problem of the gambling instinct in the human being. According to his analysis, gambling pervades our entire economic system; thus insurance contracts are a gamble, stock and grain exchange transactions are gambles, and the farmer's dependence on weather is a gamble. Counsel's attempt to apply this analysis to the present case left us cold and unimpressed. He even reminded us that our great idol, Mr. Chief Justice John Marshall, in his day attended the horse races and wagered with his clergyman. In fact, they ran a book. As indicating how times have changed and how even our coarse nature <b>has</b> <b>yielded</b> to the protecting care of governmental policy, we confess we do not even know a bookmaker, clerical or otherwise, and our passes to the beautiful race tracks around Chicago lie in our desk unused.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th century, paleontological {{exploration}} intensified {{everywhere and}} {{ceased to be}} a largely European and North American activity. In the 135 years between Buckland's first discovery and 1969 a total of 170 dinosaur genera were described. In the 25 years after 1969 that number increased to 315. Much of this increase was due to the examination of new rock exposures, particularly in previously little-explored areas in South America and Africa. Near the end of the 20th century the opening of China to systematic exploration for fossils <b>has</b> <b>yielded</b> a wealth of material on dinosaurs and the origin of birds and mammals. Also study of the Chengjiang fauna, a Cambrian fossil site in China, during the 1990s has provided important clues to the origin of vertebrates.|$|E

In Uruguay and Rio Grande do Sul, the Lujanian (Late Pleistocene to Early Holocene) Sopas Formation <b>has</b> <b>yielded</b> remains of L. molitor, in addition to such other mammals as the extinct saber-toothed cat Smilodon populator and species of Glyptodon, Macrauchenia, and Toxodon. The type locality, Lagoa Santa, lies far northeast of the nearest record of live L. molitor; there, it is known only from three skull fragments from a cave known as Laga da Escrivania Nr.5. This cave also contains numerous remains {{of members of the}} extinct South American megafauna, such as ground sloths, litopternans, gomphotheres, and glyptodonts, in addition to 16species of cricetid rodents, but it is not certain that all remains from this cave are from the same age.|$|E

5|$|The first lower molar (m1) bears {{four main}} crests {{and a smaller}} one between the two crests at the back. An {{additional}} crest (the anterotropid) is present between the two front crests, the anterolophid and the metalophid, in S.alpinus, but not in S.bolligeri. The occlusal pattern of m2 resembles that of m1. S.bolligeri also lacks an anterotropid on m2, but the tooth is not known from Oberdorf. In a worn m2 from Tägernaustrasse, there is a thickened portion in the labial part of the anterolophid, which Prieto interpreted as a remnant of the anterotropid; this led him to identify the Tägernaustrasse population as S. cf. alpinus. Only Oberdorf <b>has</b> <b>yielded</b> the m3 of Seorsumuscardinus. It resembles the m1 and has a short anterotropid, but has more oblique crests. In S.alpinus, the lower molars have two and occasionally three roots. The roots of the m1 of S.bolligeri are not preserved and the m2 has two roots.|$|E
5|$|Thulium is principally {{extracted}} from monazite ores (~0.007% thulium) found in river sands, through ion-exchange. Newer ion-exchange and solvent-extraction techniques {{have led to}} easier separation of the rare earths, which <b>has</b> <b>yielded</b> much lower costs for thulium production. The principal sources today are the ion adsorption clays of southern China. In these, where {{about two-thirds of the}} total rare-earth content is yttrium, thulium is about 0.5% (or about tied with lutetium for rarity). The metal can be isolated through reduction of its oxide with lanthanum metal or by calcium reduction in a closed container. None of thulium's natural compounds are commercially important. Approximately 50 tonnes per year of thulium oxide are produced. In 1996, thulium oxide cost US$20 per gram, and in 2005, 99%-pure thulium metal powder cost US$70 per gram.|$|E
