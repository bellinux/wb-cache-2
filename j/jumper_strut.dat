5000|$|Against Australia II, {{a genuine}} ‘break-through’ design, Liberty won three races and arguably {{should have won}} the series but for two events. Firstly, {{just prior to the}} crucial fifth race, when Liberty was leading Australia II by 3-1 and needed only one more race to win the cup, the US boat broke its jumper struts close {{to the top of the}} mast. Although repairs were made, they weren’t totally {{effective}} and on the first leg of the race, the port <b>jumper</b> <b>strut</b> again collapsed disadvantaging the boat. Australia II went on to win the fifth race by 1:47 secs. [...] Secondly, Liberty was 57 seconds ahead at the start of the fifth leg on the final race. Conner’s tactical mistake of not covering Australia II on the final downwind run allowed Australia II to overtake the US boat and eventually win the race and the America’s Cup.|$|E
50|$|O'Day {{signed an}} {{agreement}} with Phil Rhodes to put his name onto the boat Rhodes had designed, and in 1959 50 of the new Rhodes 19's were sold. The rig was almost an exact knock-off of the Lightning rig, with a single spreader mast and <b>jumper</b> <b>struts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Jumper Stays—These {{additional}} stays {{and their}} associated <b>jumper</b> <b>struts</b> {{limit the amount}} that the upper portion of the mast can bend, and thereby enable tension to be effectively transferred from the backstay to the forestay. Jumper stays were common {{in the first part}} of the 20th century. Their biggest disadvantage is weight and windage aloft.|$|R
