40|$|AbstractGap {{junctional}} {{intercellular communication}} (GJIC), by which glutathione (GSH) and inorganic ions are transmitted to neighboring cells, {{is recognized as}} being largely involved in toxic processes of chemicals. We examined acetaminophen (APAP) -induced hepatotoxicity clinicopathologically using male wild-type mice and mice lacking the gene for connexin 32, a major gap junction protein in the liver [knockout (Cx 32 KO) mice]. When APAP was intraperitoneally administered at doses of 100, 200, or 300 mg/kg, <b>hepatic</b> centrilobular <b>necrosis</b> with elevated plasma aminotransferase activities was observed in wild-type mice receiving 300 mg/kg, and in Cx 32 KO mice given 100 mg/kg or more. At 200 mg/kg or more, hepatic GSH and GSSG contents decreased significantly and the effect was more severe in wild-type mice than in Cx 32 KO mice. On the other hand, markedly decreased GSH staining was observed in the hepatic centrilobular zones of Cx 32 KO mice {{compared to that of}} wild-type mice. These results demonstrate that Cx 32 KO mice are more susceptible to APAP hepatotoxicity than wild-type mice, and indicate that the distribution of GSH of the centrilobular zones in the hepatic lobules, rather than GSH and GSSG contents in the liver, is important in APAP hepatotoxicity. In conclusion, Cx 32 protects against APAP-induced <b>hepatic</b> centrilobular <b>necrosis</b> in mice, which may be through the GSH transmission to neighboring hepatocytes by GJIC...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{investigate}} the hepatotoxicity of zederone isolated from Curcuma elata in mice. Adult male mice were intraperitoneally injected with a single dose of zederone (50 - 300 mg/kg body weight [BW]). Twenty-four hours after the injection, zederone induced liver enlargement with scattered white foci over the organ. The medium lethal dose (LD 50) value at 24 hours of zederone was approximately 223 mg/kg BW. <b>Hepatic</b> centrilobular <b>necrosis</b> with marked increases in plasma alanine transaminase activity and total bilirubin levels was observed. Zederone at a dose of 200 mg/kg BW markedly decreased the activity of superoxide dismutase and the hepatic glutathione content, whereas the activity of catalase was not altered. The compound at this dose also increased the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of Cyp 2 b 10 and Cyp 3 a 11, which are the main drug-metabolizing enzymes in the liver. The mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor a was increased.

The histopathology of massive <b>hepatic</b> centrilobular <b>necrosis</b> {{with an increase in}} the expression of cytochrome P 450 (Cyp) suggests that the possible potentiation of zederone-induced hepatotoxicity implicated the induction of Cyps, which leads to the formation of biological reactive metabolites and that cause the oxidative stress and liver cell injuries...|$|R

30|$|An {{overdose}} of acetaminophen induces acute hepatotoxic and nephrotoxic effects with massive <b>hepatic</b> centrilobular <b>necrosis</b> and acute renal failure, respectively, {{while there is}} evidence to show that the molecular basis of nephrotoxicity may differ from that of hepatotoxicity because NAC protects against hepatotoxicity, but not nephrotoxicity [3]. The present study also revealed dose range differences in acetaminophen-induced reductions in the uptake of 18 F-BCPP-BF between the liver and kidney. Thus, a decrease in the uptake of 8 F-BCPP-BF by the liver was observed, even with the low dose of 100  mg/kg, whereas a reduction in its uptake by the kidney required the administration of acetaminophen at higher doses of 300  mg/kg and more.|$|R
