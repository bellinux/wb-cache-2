40|$|Recent {{advances}} in computer graphics and multimedia technologies {{have contributed to}} the development of interactive media-rich systems that generate media elements dynamically in multiple modalities to present information in an effective and appealing manner to users. Utilizing media elements in an application that requires them to be temporally coordinated in real-time presents synchronization issues because the wrong timing or duration of media elements will be easily detected by the user. Most media-rich systems have solved various aspects of the media <b>element</b> <b>synchronization</b> problem. However, they have done so in an ad hoc manner without providing a generic reusable framework. This thesis proposes a framework for real-time synchronization in intelligent media generators. Our research addresses six primary issues that are essential to creating media-rich systems that do not utilize an ad hoc solution to their media <b>element</b> <b>synchronization</b> problems: synchronization of media elements, decoupling high-level and low-level processing, extensibility, media element sequencing, real-time performance, and domain-independence. The framework has been implemented in an agent-based multimedia generator for an intelligent tutoring system to demonstrate its feasibility...|$|E
40|$|A {{distributed}} {{data structure}} is an object which permits many producers to augment or modify its contents, and many consumers simultaneously to access its component <b>elements.</b> <b>Synchronization</b> {{is implicit in}} data structure access: a process that requests an element which {{has not yet been}} generated blocks until a producer creates it. In this paper, we describe a parallel programming language (called T S) whose fundamental communication device is a significant generalization of the tuple-space distributed data structure found in the Linda coordination language[6]. Our sequential base language is a dialect of Scheme[19]. Beyond the fact that T S is derived by incorporating a tuple-space coordination language into a higher-order computation language (i. e., Scheme), T S differs from other tuple-space languages in two important ways: ffl Tuple-spaces are first-class objects.

For example, both a group of fish swarming together and a flock of birds synchronously flying belong to the synchronization phenomena. Up to now, there exists much literature such as [6 – 27] studying the synchronization control problem of complex networks by using different methods. For instance, [6, 7] study the synchronization control problem of discrete complex dynamical networks with a time varying delay by using the method of partitioning time delay and chief stability function, respectively. For the continuous complex networks with different characters, such as time delayed complex networks [8 – 10], stochastic complex networks [11, 12], complex networks with switching topology [13 – 15], there have existed a great deal of papers to study the synchronization control problem. The control methods mainly include pinning control [16 – 18], impulsive control [19, 20], adaptive control [21 – 27], etc. The adopted theories mainly include Lyapunov stability theory, the chief stability function method, and M-matrix theory.|$|R

30|$|In the RX mode, the FSM is {{composed}} {{out of the}} three super-states. An IDLE state, as in TX mode, denotes the inactive state of the receiver. In this state, the receiver monitors the environment seeking for an incoming signal. Once a signal is detected, through an received signal strength indicator (RSSI) for instance, the receiver switches from the IDLE state to the PRE-SOF state. The PRE-SOF state consists essentially of synchronization tasks as imposed {{by most of the}} standards. Once the system enters the PRE-SOF state, a set of <b>synchronization</b> <b>elements</b> has to be detected and computed within a certain delay. If not, the system returns in the IDLE state. These <b>synchronization</b> <b>element</b> detection and computation are associated to the sof event which is defined in the DSL-based frame specification that was lately introduced. An sof detection makes the system switch from PRE-SOF to POST-SOF where a coherent data decoding is sketched. The POST-SOF state is declined into three parallel sub-states, namely the DECODING state where most of the signal processing is required, the SYNC-TRACK state in which the system keeps on tracking <b>synchronization</b> <b>elements,</b> and finally the BL-RECONF state to handle the run-time block-level reconfiguration like in TX mode.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: {{the main}} goal of the article is to study the {{possibilities}} of increasing the sustainability of world economic development to the crisis fluctuations of national economies and their aggregated groups under conditions when the fluctuations induced in the global crisis by the global crisis manifest coherence features. Methods: the analysis of coherent interaction processes {{of a set of}} discrete macroeconomic cycles is performed to compare the individual data of managed economic systems with the possibilities of regulating the degree of coherence of fluctuations of key processes in the national economy. Results: the necessity of transition from consideration of a separate macroeconomic cycle as a discrete process to a coherent-resonant multicyclic paradigm of economic development under which chaotic crisis phenomena are represented as external manifestations of macroeconomic nonlinear synchronization of quasiharmonic oscillations within the framework of cyclic dynamics of various processes of economic development is substantiated. Stabilization in these conditions is achieved by forming optimal values of the package of investments that form the regions of stabilization synchronization in the economy through the "damping" of the amplitude of destructive cycles and the creation of conditions for their asymmetry, depending on the intensity of crisis fluctuations. The necessity of establishing procedures for the international coordination of the anti-crisis policies of individual states within the framework of international clusters is substantiated using the coherent resonance model arising from the synchronization of cyclical and acyclic crisis fluctuations. Conclusions and Relevance: the influence of the dynamic properties of a multicyclic system on the behavior of its local <b>elements</b> (cycle <b>synchronization,</b> cyclic and acyclic dynamics, etc.) with respect to the dynamics of compound evolutionary (including degrading) subsystems determines the probability of transitions between stationary states of the system as a result of iterative successive losses Sustainability of economic development, etc. As a result, it is possible to maintain the sustainability of economic development at various levels of governance in the world economy.

In {{order to}} execute cognitive functions the brain must bind features and information which occurs at different cortical areas. The most accepted hypothesis to underlie such integration {{of information is}} the binding by synchrony. Accordingly to it: two brain regions {{interact with each other}} whenever they have coherent activity. The mechanism of this phenomenon has been subject of controversial debate for many years: how can two distant dynamical elements synchronize at zero lag even in the presence of non-negligible delays in the transfer of information between them? So far, complex mechanisms and neural architectures have been proposed to answer this question. However, a simple and robust mechanism has been proposed recently. Zero-lag <b>synchronization</b> between two <b>elements</b> is achieved by relaying the dynamics via a third mediating <b>element.</b> The <b>synchronization</b> thus obtained is robust over a considerable parameter range. In this work we study the dynamical relay phenomenon in complex networks of chemically coupled neurons, specifically the capacity to provide the basis for the binding by synchrony process. We show that three identical neuronal populations satisfy the minimum conditions to produce lag-free synchrony among delayed populations reciprocally connected to a central relay population. We also investigate the dynamical behavior of the thalamocortical circuit whose relay station role is played by the thalamus. We found that the thalamocortical circuit supports the dynamical relay mechanism. More importantly, we report the identification of a variable that might be responsible to control the on-off synchronization of the cortical populations depending only on the ratio of dorsal over ventral thalamus external activity. The simplicity of the key controlling element in the model also suggests that both bottom-up and top-down incoming stimulus to thalamic region share responsibilities in the cortical synchronization phenomenon, in contrast to previous hypothesis. This work supports the binding by synchrony theory and helps to establish solid bases for this phenomenon. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Triple Graph Grammars (TGGs) are a {{rule-based}} technique with {{a formal}} background for specifying bidirectional model transformation and, hence, {{can be applied}} to transform a given model into another and vice versa. In practice, models are either created from scratch by using a single input model, or incrementally synchronized by propagating changes between integrated models. The outstanding property of incremental model synchronization is that in average only small portions of the whole model have to be retransformed as mostly only a subset of a model has been changed. Hence, we have the opportunity to (i) improve efficiency of model transformations and (ii) to retain as much information as possible. Regarding information preserving capabilities, this offers the chance to qualitatively improve the results of model transformations. This is because additional model content (e. g., model elements or user specific decision during the actual transformation process), which is not covered by the model transformation itself, will be mostly retained. In practical scenarios, unidirectional rules for incremental forward and incremental backward transformation are automatically derived from the specified TGG rules, and the overall transformation process is governed by a control algorithm. Current incremental approaches either have a runtime complexity that depends on the size of related models and not on the number of changes and their affected elements, or do not pursue formalization to give reliable predictions regarding the expected results, or impose such restrictions on the language of TGGs that the remaining expressiveness is not capable of certain real-world scenarios. For these reasons, the aim of this thesis is to develop a novel approach to incremental model synchronization with TGGs that (i) is efficient regarding the number of changes, (ii) retains as much information as possible, (iii) complies with important formal properties, and (iv) is expressive enough for real-world scenarios. Therefore, we introduce an incremental model synchronization algorithm for TGGs, which employs a static analysis on TGG specifications to efficiently determine the range of influence of model changes at runtime and, thus, to regard only these <b>elements</b> for <b>synchronization.</b> Together with further improvements and critical discussions {{we will be able to}} show that this approach is a suitable means for complex model synchronization tasks...|$|R

We describe and analyze a solution for directory-based routing. We will present an architecture based on a distributed database on the switched circuit network and the IP network. The aim of the solution is to provide efficient service management, close to optimal routing for all calls including calls to 800 - and cellular numbers and personal number portability between both network technologies. The solution is based on similar but differing in detail approaches for each network. In the IP network we use the Telephony Routing over IP (TRIP) protocol developed by IETF. Additionally, the described architecture is open for inclusion of the Telephone Number Mapping (ENUM) protocol that is under development. For the circuit switched network, we suggest a new protocol called Circuit Telephony Routing Information Protocol (CTRIP). The protocol provides a distributed method for synchronizing routing information between databases. Furthermore, we propose numbering gateways for transferring number information between the two network types.
