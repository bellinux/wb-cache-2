This residue is almost pure keratin, which is not easily degradable by common proteolytic enzymes. Eight strains of Bacillus, isolated from decomposing feathers were tested for the hydrolysis of feather wastes in the laboratory. Among these strains, Bacillus cereus KB 043 was the best feather degrading organism when grown on basal medium containing 1 % <b>hen</b> <b>feather</b> as sole source of carbon and nitrogen. It caused 78. 16 ± 0. 4 % degradation with a significant release of soluble protein (1206. 15 ± 14. 7 µg mL- 1) and cysteine (20. 63 ± 0. 4 µg mL- 1) in the cultivation fluid. The strain also showed {{the highest level of}} keratinase activity (39. 10 ± 0. 4 U mL- 1). These data indicates that the Bacillus cereus KB 043 could be useful in management of poultry wastes...|$|E
30|$|Several {{studies have}} {{reported}} different methods for dye removal from aqueous solutions such as photochemical degradation, biological degradation, coagulation–flocculation, chemical oxidation, adsorption, membrane separation process, electrochemical, reverse osmosis, aerobic and anaerobic microbial degradation, but their shortcomings have limited their applications (Majumdar et al. 2015; Das et al. 2013; Sadaf and Bhatti 2014; Sadhukhan et al. 2014; Shen et al. 2015). Adsorption {{has proved to be}} the most effective physicochemical method in removing dye from effluents with activated carbon as the most widely used adsorbent. Activated carbon has been found useful, and effective in dye removal but high cost of preparation and regeneration maintenance have made its use economically burdensome (Tan and Hameed 2010; Giwa et al. 2015; Santhi and Kumar 2015). This has led to the use of effective alternative adsorbents such as <b>hen</b> <b>feather</b> (Mittal et al. 2007), cassava pellets (Okewale et al. 2013), perlite (Vijayakumar et al. 2012), Rhizopus oyrzae biomass (Das et al. 2006, 2008), Mucor rouxii (Majumdar et al. 2015) Raphia hookeri epicarp (Inyinbor et al. 2016 a), Chitosan (Inyinbor et al. 2016 b), silk (Jiwalak et al. 2010), phosphoric acid-modified rice husk (Dada et al. 2012) and sawdust of Parkia biglobosa (Giwa et al. 2015) for the removal of dyes. However, as microparticles, these materials will require long time for maximum adsorption.|$|E
30|$|A few common {{industrial}} wastewater remediation methods include ozonation, membrane filtration, adsorption (Kooh et al. 2016 b), ion-exchange (Naushad et al. 2015) and phytoremediation (Kooh et al. 2016 c). Adsorption {{is the most}} popular water remediation method (Wang et al. 2011) due to its simple remediation process and can be adopted by any textile mill without the need of advanced knowledge. The cost of the water treatment depends on the type of adsorbent and its adsorption efficiency. Examples of low-cost alternatives may include soil materials such as peat (Chieng et al. 2015), abundant weeds (Lim et al. 2016), or wastes derived from agriculture or industries such as walnut shell (Dahri et al. 2014), breadfruit peel (Lim et al. 2014 b), soya waste (Kooh et al. 2015 a; Mital and Kurup 2006), dextrin (Mittal et al. 2016 b), alginate (Mittal et al. 2016 a, c), egg shell (Mittal et al. 2016 e), hibiscus fibre (Sharma et al. 2015) and <b>hen</b> <b>feather</b> (Mittal and Mittal 2015). However, the adsorption capacity of absorbents varied with the type of dyes. Carbonaceous materials such as carbon nanotube (Mittal et al. 2016 d) and activated carbon may be effective for multiple types of dyes, however, treatment may be expensive. Moreover, activated carbon may have higher carbon footprint due to high amount of energy and chemical required to produce it (Al-Degs et al. 2008).|$|E

40|$|Tartrazine, {{a yellow}} menace, is widely {{being used in}} cosmetics, foodstuffs, {{medicines}} and textile. It is carcinogenic and also catalyzes allergic problems. In the present work the ability to remove Tartrazine from aqueous solutions has been studied using waste material—hen feathers, as adsorbent. Effects of pH, concentration of the dye, temperature and adsorbent dosage have been studied. Equilibrium isotherms for the adsorption of the dye were measured experimentally. Results were analyzed by the Freundlich and Langmuir equation at different temperatures and determined the characteristic parameters for each adsorption isotherm. The adsorption process has been found endothermic in nature and thermodynamic parameters, Gibb’s free energy (�G ◦), change in enthalpy (�H ◦) and change in entropy (�S ◦) have been calculated. The paper also includes results on the kinetic measurements of adsorption of the dye on <b>hen</b> <b>feathers</b> at different temperatures.

The feathers were first washed with detergent and rinsed thoroughly with distilled water to remove adhering dirt and any unwanted particles. They were then washed with aqueous ethanol (20  % v/v) to remove organic residues, and then rinsed again with distilled water. The washed feathers were then air dried and the barbs were cut into about 0.5  cm length with the help of scissors, discarding the hard middle rachis. Finally, the prepared biosorbent was stored in sterile, air tight glass bottles and used without any further treatment for dye biosorption.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hen</b> <b>feathering</b> in cocks is {{a genetically}} {{conditioned}} character in domestic fowl (Gallus gallus domesticus). Males with this condition develop a female-type plumage, although otherwise look and respond like virile males. In some breeds, {{one can see}} males that have a plumage completely similar in all aspects to that of females. The trait is controlled by a simple autosomic dominant gene, whose expression {{is limited to the}} male sex. The condition is due to an enhanced activity of the aromatase complex of enzymes responsible for estrogen synthesis. So estrogen formation in the skin is as much as several hundred-fold higher than that of normal chickens.|$|R

30|$|Biosorption {{potential}} of <b>hen</b> <b>feathers</b> (HFs) to remove methylene blue (MB) from aqueous solutions was investigated. Batch experiments {{were carried out}} as function of different process parameters such as pH, initial dye concentration, biosorbent dose and temperature. The optimum conditions for removal of MB {{were found to be}} pH 7.0, biosorbent dose =  1.0  g, and initial dye concentration =  50  mg L− 1. The temperature had a strong influence on the biosorption process. Experimental biosorption data were modeled by Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin–Radushkevich (D–R) isotherms with the Langmuir isotherm showing the best fit at all temperatures studied. The maximum monolayer sorption capacity was determined as 134.76  mg g− 1 at 303  K. According to the mean free energy values of sorption (E) calculated using the D–R isotherm model, biosorption of MB onto HFs was chemisorption. Kinetic studies showed that the biosorption of MB followed pseudo second-order kinetics. The activation energy (Ea) determined using the Arrhenius equation confirmed that the biosorption involved chemical ion-exchange. Thermodynamic studies showed that the biosorption process was spontaneous and exothermic. To conclude, HFs is a promising biosorbent for MB removal from aqueous solutions.|$|R

30|$|In recent years, biosorption {{has been}} {{strongly}} recommended as an economically viable sustainable {{technology for the}} treatment of wastewater streams (Chowdhury et al. 2011 b). The importance and usefulness of biosorption in wastewater treatment is well established (Chowdhury et al. 2011 b). Biosorption in environmental engineering is now an aesthetic attention and consideration in all nations, owing to its low initial cost, simplicity of design, ease of operation, insensitivity to toxic substances and complete removal of pollutants even from dilute solutions (Foo and Hameed 2010). A huge number of low-cost biosorbents based on natural materials or agro-industrial wastes such as rice husk (Saha 2009), tamarind fruit shell (Saha 2010), wheat shell (Bulut and Aydin 2006), orange peel (Annadurai et al. 2002), banana peel (Annadurai et al. 2002), pineapple leaves (Weng et al. 2009), pineapple stem (Hameed et al. 2009), peanut hull (Gong et al. 2005), garlic peel (Hameed and Ahmad 2009), rejected tea (Nasuha et al. 2010), Luffa cylindrical fibers (Demir et al. 2008), yellow passion fruit waste (Pavan et al. 2008), neem leaf powder (Bhattacharyya and Sharma 2005) etc. have been investigated intensively by researchers worldwide for the removal of MB from aqueous solutions. In recent years, researchers have focused on the application of biomaterials that are capable of biosorbing dyes from wastewaters. Biological materials such as peat, chitosan, yeast, fungi and bacterial biomass, have been used as biosorbents to concentrate and remove dyes from solutions (Srinivasan and Viraraghavan 2010). In this paper, we report the biosorption characteristics of <b>hen</b> <b>feathers</b> (HFs)—a waste biomaterial for the removal of MB from aqueous solution.|$|R
30|$|Feathers (chicken/hen) are {{generated}} in huge quantities as waste product at commercial poultry processing plants. Worldwide, nearly 8.5 billion tonnes of feathers {{are generated}} annually as waste by poultry-processing industries, of which India’s contribution alone is 350 million tonnes (Agrahari and Wadhwa 2010). The feathers are either used as animal feed supplement {{in the form}} of feather meal, for land filling, incinerated or buried, which involves storage, handling, emission control and ash disposal problems (Taskin and Kurbanoglu 2011; Agrahari and Wadhwa 2010). Feathers are composed mainly of keratin, a kind of self organized protein with high mechanical stability (Zaghloul et al. 2011). Keratin has a high content of the amino acids glycine, alanine, serine, cysteine and valine (Taskin and Kurbanoglu 2011). These amino acids are responsible for the presence of a number of functional groups (carboxyl, hydroxyl and amine-groups) both on the backbone and the side chain of the polypeptide molecule, thereby rendering it an interesting physicochemical property for the sorption of organic/inorganic compounds (Aguayo-Villarreal et al. 2011). Till date, few studies have proved feathers to be effective and economically feasible to remove several pollutants including dyes from aqueous solutions (Mittal et al. 2007). However, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, no study has been reported on the removal of MB using <b>hen</b> <b>feathers.</b> Thus, our primary aim was to investigate and explore the possibility of using HFs as biosorbent for the removal of MB from aqueous solutions.
