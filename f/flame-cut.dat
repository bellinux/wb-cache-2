50|$|Metal {{counterweights}} are lead, cast iron, or <b>flame-cut</b> steel. Flame cut steel bricks {{are most}} common. In any particular fly system all counterweights typically share a common, standardized footprint {{that matches the}} system's arbors, which in turn are sized to conform to line set spacing. Counterweight systems are most often designed to use either 4 or 6 in wide weights. Weights vary in thickness, typically in half-inch increments ranging from 1/2 to 2 in, with each thickness corresponding to a different mass. 1 in thick weights are most common. Counterweights are sometimes also known as bricks or simply steel. Often a rigging worker {{will be asked to}} load a number of inches of steel, which correlates to a specific mass. Weights are usually loaded from the loading bridge, but can also be loaded from the fly gallery or stage deck in some circumstances.|$|E
5000|$|Frame {{designs are}} the most {{significant}} element of this simple device. For the most part wheels have changed very little since the 19th century. The early English machines (as opposed to the American versions), such as Edwards, Kendrick, Brown, Boggs, and Ranalah, etc., had cast iron frames. These wheels, made during the 19th Century, had Babbitt metal plain bearings, making them difficult to push and pull the metal through when operated at high pressures. Later, when ball bearings came into use, the machines became more suitable for hard and thick material, such as 1/8” steel. Despite the advantages of cast iron, it has {{less than half the}} stiffness (Young's modulus) of steel and sometimes must be replaced by steel when a stiffer frame is needed. Steel frames made of solid <b>flame-cut</b> plate, or frames built-up of cut-and-welded plates, are common designs. Steel tubing, generally of square section, has been used for wheeling machine frames during the past 30 years, in the US particularly, where sheet metal shaping has become a hobby as well as a business. Tube-framed machines are reasonably-priced and are available either as kit-built machines or can be built easily from plans. The stiffest tubular frames have a fully triangulated external bracing truss. They are most effective on thinner or softer materials, such as 20 ga steel or [...]063" [...] aluminum. Cast frame machines, like the one pictured, are still available.|$|E
40|$|Flame cutting is a {{commonly}} used method of thermal cutting, where a controlled flame and oxygen jet {{are applied to}} a thick steel plate to burn it {{and to create a}} cut edge. This heat from the flame causes significant temperature differences, which induce plastic deformation, phase transformations and residual stresses inside the steel plate. Tensile residual stresses are assumed to be a factor in delayed cracking, which happens when the steel plates are put into storage. To thoroughly understand and optimize the <b>flame-cutting</b> process for preventing the cracking, more information about the conditions inside the steel plate, while it is being applied with a large amount of heat, is needed. Temperature history is the defining factor to the phase distribution of steel, and creating an optimal microstructure is the desired outcome of every heat-treatment process. By modelling the process, more information about the stress distribution and the temperature history can be obtained. A model of <b>flame-cutting</b> of low-alloyed steel was made by using a commercial finite element program ABAQUS. First the material was created to resemble the characteristics of the studied low-alloyed steel, and then the austenite and martensite phase transformations were introduced to the model by user subroutines. The cutting flame was created as a time-dependent heat flux to simulate the movement of the flame. The model was used for various applications, such as different cutting speeds, <b>flame-cutting</b> of steel plates with different thicknesses, pre-heating and post-heating. The results of all these applications are presented, but the main subjects of the study are the temperature history and residual stress results from the cutting speeds of 150 and 300 mm/min. The results obtained from these cutting speeds are encouraging and correspond relatively well with the experimental results. Further study is needed to completely verify the model, as the approach to the modelling of the flame is slightly different from earlier studies...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of numerical and experimental investigations to determine the causes of prestressed concrete girder end cracks. The cracks, which develop during the <b>flame-cutting</b> release process, result from the restraining effect of unreleased strands as the girder shortens from the partially transferred prestress and from shear stresses generated by the cutting order of the strands. Researchers examined several methods to elimate the cracks, such as making changes to the strand cutting pattern, debonding some of the strands in the end regions, and increasing the slope of the top surface of the bottom flange. Implementation of the first two of these methods in the field proved successful. Minnesota Department of Transportatio...|$|R

Machining coordinate systems and transformation matrix models were established for the CNC flame processing system considering both geometric errors and thermal deformation effects. Meanwhile, prediction and compensation models were constructed related to the actual cutting situation. Focusing on the thermal deformation elements, finite element {{analysis was used to}} measure the testing data of thermal errors, the grey system theory was applied to optimize the key thermal points, and related thermal dynamics models were carried out to achieve high-precision prediction values. Comparison experiments between the proposed method and the teaching method were conducted on the processing system after performing calibration. The results showed that the proposed method is valid and the cutting quality could be improved by more than 30 % relative to the teaching method. Furthermore, the proposed method can be used under any working condition by making a few adjustments to the prediction and compensation models...|$|R

For all except the silicon steel, the strength and the ductility of the guided flamecut edges were also good. However, for the manual flame-cutting procedure, there was in some cases serious impairment of the physical properties. Even the automatic flame cutting impaired the properties of the silicon steel, but the ductility and strength were restored by subsequent appropriate flame softening of the edge. The sheared edge impaired the ductility of all of the steels tested. The greatest loss in ductility was caused in the semi-killed steel where the maximum strength also was reduced, in some instances falling as low as the yield strength. The harmful effect of the sheared edge on the ductility was apparently eliminated by a subsequent flame softening treatment. The strength and the ductility were increased to practically the same values as those of the same steel with machined edges. Only under the most damaging edge conditions was the strength at a brittle fracture as low as the yield point. With the better methods of edge preparation, the strength was considerably above the yield point and approached the usual ultimate strength of the material.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Numerous highway bridge girders across the United States have experienced fatigue cracking due to repetitive out-of-plane distortion at unstiffened web gaps caused by poorly designed diaphragm connection details. Due to the widespread nature of the problem, effective and economical means of repair and retrofit need to be developed. -Once the source of out-of-plane distortion is removed, such repair and retrofit techniques involve the arrest of fatigue crack growth, either by drilling holes at crack tips, or by completely removing a portion of densely cracked web plate material by flame-cutting. In the process of repairing fatigue cracks, stress concentrations result, affecting the fatigue life of the structure. Currently, no standardized criteria exist for the use of hole-drilling and flame-cutting as repair techniques. The first portion of the study analyzes the effects of spacing and orientation of multiple drilled hole spacing and orientation on stress concentrations using finite element analyses. The findings are then used to derive general guidelines for the use of drilled holes. In addition, safer alternatives to drilling holes are developed and recommended. A study of <b>flame-cut</b> holes is also conducted. Experimental data indicates that <b>flame-cut</b> holes are at worst Category D details based on AASHTO's fatigue criteria. Results of laboratory testing and finite element analyses are used in the development of <b>flame-cut</b> hole guidelines. A finite element model predicts the behavior of both repaired and unrepaired cracks along the longitudinal web-to-flange connection of a plate girder subjected to a linear bending stress to determine if repair by drilling holes is really necessary. The results of the finite element analyses and their correlation with experimental data indicate that arrest of a longitudinal web-to-flange by hole-drilling is necessary...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Cracks have {{occasionally}} {{been found}} after hot-dip galvanizing of <b>flame-cut</b> structural beams. A {{project has been}} completed at CANMET to find the causes of this problem. Experiments {{have been designed to}} measure the time-to-failure of notched samples under near-constant load. Cracking during galvanizing is caused by liquid-metal embrittlement, and occurs for critical combinations of stress and susceptible material. Sources of stress are residual stresses including those from flame cutting, and thermal stresses from thermal gradients during hot dipping. Material susceptibility is related primarily to surface hardness, and correlates well with micro-hardness measured at 100 µm depth. Remedial measures to eliminate cracking require either reduction of the hardness below a critical level (270 Vickers), or reduction of residual and thermal stresses...|$|E
40|$|Thermal cutting methods, are {{commonly}} used {{in the manufacture of}} metal parts. Thermal cutting processes separate materials by using heat. The process can be done with or without a stream of cutting oxygen. Common processes are Oxygen, plasma and laser cutting. It depends on the application and material which cutting method is used. Numerically-controlled thermal cutting is a cost-effective way of prefabricating components. One design aim is to minimize the number of work steps in order to increase competitiveness. This has resulted in the holes and openings in plate parts manufactured today being made using thermal cutting methods. This is a problem from the fatigue life perspective because there is local detail in the as-welded state that causes a rise in stress in a local area of the plate. In a case where the static utilization of a net section is full used, the calculated linear local stresses and stress ranges are often over 2 times the material yield strength. The shakedown criteria are exceeded. Fatigue life assessment of <b>flame-cut</b> details is commonly based on the nominal stress method. For welded details, design standards and instructions provide more accurate and flexible methods, e. g. a hot-spot method, but these methods are not universally applied to flame cut edges. Some of the fatigue tests of flame cut edges in the laboratory indicated that fatigue life estimations based on the standard nominal stress method can give quite a conservative fatigue life estimate in cases where a high notch factor was present. This is an undesirable phenomenon and it limits the potential for minimizing structure size and total costs. A new calculation method is introduced to improve the accuracy of the theoretical fatigue life prediction method of a flame cut edge with a high stress concentration factor. Simple equations were derived by using laboratory fatigue test results, which are published in this work. The proposed method is called the modified FAT method (FATmod). The method takes into account the residual stress state, surface quality, material strength class and true stress ratio in the critical place...|$|E
40|$|PolyU Library Call No. : [THS] LG 51. H 577 P CEE 2015 Lixxviii, 298 pages :illustrations (some color) High-strength {{steel is}} a term usually applied to {{specific}} types of steel that have a design yield strength larger than 460 MPa, distinguishing it from the other types of steel having lower strength. Its adoption has become popular in the past decade, initiating certain benefits in fabrication, construction, cost, and so on. Not only does using high-strength steel dramatically reduce the section sizes of members associated with material consumption and member weight, it also considerably alleviates the difficulties in buildmanship and accelerates construction. This can significantly benefit construction in high density urban areas, such as Hong Kong, Shanghai, and New York, where the labor cost is usually {{more expensive than the}} material cost. Consequentially, high-strength steel can be viewed as environmental friendly because its use reduces material consumption, thereby decreasing carbon dioxide release. Although high-strength steel is mass-produced and is widely used in mechanical engineering, its utilization in building construction is still under exploration {{due to the lack of}} consummate design and analysis approaches. The current design codes for steel columns used worldwide, e. g., ANSI/AISC 360 - 10, Eurocode 3 Part 1 - 1, Hong Kong Code 2011, and China GB 50017 - 2003, mostly provide the formulae and charts for steel with a design yield strength less than 460 MPa, resulting in obstacles in the design and application of high-strength steel members. Eurocode 3 Part 1 - 12 simply extends the use of high-strength steel to grade S 700. This thesis aims to propose a direct analysis and design approach for high-strength steel members, thereby eliminating the use of the tedious charts and formulae associated with linear elastic assumptions. By using high-strength steel, the sectional sizes of members can be dramatically reduced and the stability problems associated with the second-order effects would be dominated, which should be properly reflected in the design. In the present study, the pointwise equilibrium polynomial (PEP) element is employed to model the beam-column members and to simulate the P-δ effects due to initial member curvatures. Adopting the high-order shape function for the PEP element and considering the bowing effects, one element per member is sufficient and accurate for nonlinear elastic analysis. Therefore, member design can be simply executed by checking the section strength at critical locations. For a more accurate representation of the section capacity, the sectional yield surfaces are introduced, which are expressed by a series of strength points in a bi-axial loading space. Two types of surfaces are presented: initial and failure surfaces. These are generated by a cross-sectional analysis technique based on the quasi-Newton algorithm. The sections are automatically meshed into small triangular fibers. This method is valid for arbitrary shapes of the steel sections. The elastic and plastic limit states of a section can be described by the initial yield and failure surfaces, respectively. To explicitly consider the influences of residual stress, the cross-sectional analysis technique is further developed to take this effect into account. The initial stress inherent in a section is reflected by introducing the residual strains applied to each fiber; therefore, the numerical algorithm can be easily modified on the basis of the current available programs. Consequentially, residual stress models are vital for the cross section analysis. In real-time applications, Q 690 high-strength steel shows a non-negligible potential in applications; however, its residual stress distribution patterns are still being explored and they are seldom reported in the available literature. In this thesis, the magnitudes and distributions of six box and H columns, fabricated by Q 690 high-strength steel, will be investigated using the sectioning method. The residual stress patterns on column sections are examined and presented. To simplify the analysis, straight-line models of Q 690 high-strength steel are first proposed on the basis of the experimental investigations, which can be further applied to the analysis of the other sections with ranged width-to-thickness or height-to-thickness ratios. To fulfill the design requirements for simulating the structural behaviors under extreme scenarios, such as progressive collapse analysis, performance-based seismic design, the vital effects inherent to the structural members should be reflected. The P-{ 439 }and P-{ 463 } effects related to the frame out-of-plumpness and initial member curvatures, respectively, are directly considered by employing the curved PEP element with the high-order shape function. The influence of residual stress is reflected by explicitly calculating in the cross-section analysis. In addition, a refined plastic hinge model is introduced in order to consider the gradually yielding behaviors at the critical sections. From the present study, it can be observed that the residual stress exerts certain influences on controlling the sectional elastic limit that might cause the fiber to start yielding at a low stress state. Differing from the conventional method, where the equivalent imperfection is adopted combing initial member curvatures and residual stresses, the proposed method separately considers these two vital effects. Therefore, the design can be more accurate, safe, and economical thereby eliminating the empirical and uncertain considerations found in the conventional design method. To verify the accuracy and versatility of the proposed method, six fabricated box columns and six welded H columns with different slenderness ratios ranging from 30 to 70 are axially-loaded and studied. All of the columns were prepared by the <b>flame-cut</b> Q 690 steel plates with a thickness equal to 16 mm. The numerical simulations of the specimens obtained by the proposed method are presented and compared with the outcomes of the experiments, showing satisfactory results in the comparisons in terms of tracing the load vs. deflection and predicting the ultimate strength. Extensive research studying the overall buckling behavior of the Q 690 columns with different slenderness ratios is conducted, and 132 nos. and 192 nos. columns with box and H sections, respectively, are analyzed by the proposed method. These results are compared with the conventional buckling curves in codes, e. g., GB 50017 - 2003, Eurocode 3, and ANSI/AISC 360 - 10. The comparisons show that the axial strengths of the high-strength columns are underestimated, especially for the members with low slenderness ratios. This further proves the importance and necessity of developing an efficient and practical method for the design of high-strength members; otherwise, the material utilization efficiency could be reduced. To propose an efficient and practical method for the design of high-strength steel members, a second-order design method, based on ANSI/AISC 360 - 10, is proposed by revising the stiffness reduction factor for a more proper reflection of the residual stress. The optimal design formulae for high-strength steel members are proposed on the basis of an extensive study comprised of over 300 columns. In this thesis, an efficient advanced analysis and practical second-order design method for structures with high-strength steel members is proposed. A cross-section analysis technique with an explicit consideration of residual stresses is developed. Strength-line models for describing the residual stress patterns of H and box sections fabricated by Q 690 steel plates are first proposed. The curved PEP element is employed to simulate the initial member curvature and capture the large deflection effect. A refined plastic hinge model using the sectional surfaces is used to model the inelastic behavior at the gradually yielding sections. Twelve columns are experimentally investigated to verify the proposed theory and extensive research on over 300 nos. columns is conducted. A refined second-order design approach, based on ANSI/AISC 360 - 10, for high-strength steel members is proposed. Department of Civil and Environmental EngineeringPh.
