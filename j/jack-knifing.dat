A dynamic stability analysis model of a three-axle tractor semitrailer vehicle is developed using the application tool. The linearized vehicle model is utilized to predict the dynamics state of the tractor semitrailer built in multibody dynamics simulation software. The lateral stability simulation for yaw rate following and anti-rollover has been performed on the dynamic model based on virtual prototyping. The {{results show that the}} lateral stability control based on tractor semitrailer proposed in this paper can stabilize the tractor semitrailer, rollover and <b>jack-knifing</b> can be prevented to a large extent...|$|E
40|$|Rollover and <b>jack-knifing</b> of {{articulated}} heavy {{trucks are}} serious threats for motorists. Active safety technologies {{have been demonstrated}} to have potential to reduce or prevent the occurrence {{of these types of}} accidents. The Vehicle Dynamics Control (VDC) system utilizes differential braking to affect vehicle response and {{has been shown to be}} quite effective in controlling vehicle yaw response. In this paper, a VDC system that improves yaw, lateral, and roll stability is presented. The objectives of this VDC design are to prevent or reduce the likelihood of rollover and <b>jack-knifing</b> and to make the vehicle more closely follow the driver's intended path. A linear root locus study is performed to tune controller gains in a systematic fashion. Nonlinear dynamics simulations of a generic articulated heavy truck are run with the TruckSim and Matlab/Simulink software to study the performance of the proposed VDC algorithm. Human-in-the-loop driver models are used to obtain realistic steering inputs on predetermined test track. The simulation results of maneuvers utilizing these driver models, as well as maneuvers utilizing prescribed steering inputs, are presented. VDC is shown to stabilize the vehicle, rollover and <b>jack-knifing</b> are prevented and the vehicle more accurately follows the driver's intended path. 1...|$|E

40|$|Statistical model {{validation}} {{tools such as}} cross-validation, <b>jack-knifing</b> model parameters and permutation tests are meant to obtain an objective assessment of the performance and stability of a statistical model. However, {{little is known about}} the performance of these tools for megavariate data sets, having, for instance, a number of variables larger than 10 times the number of subjects. The performance is assessed for megavariate metabolomics data, but the conclusions also carry over to proteomics, transcriptomics and many other research areas. Partial least squares discriminant analyses models were built for several LC-MS lipidomic training data sets of various numbers of lean and obese subjects. The training data sets were compared on their modelling performance and their predictability using a 10 -fold cross-validation, a permutation test, and test data sets. A wide range of cross-validation error rates was found (from 7. 5 % to 16. 3 % for the largest trainings set and from 0 % to 60 % for the smallest training set) and the error rate increased when the number of subjects decreased. The test error rates varied from 5 % to 50 %. The smaller the number of subjects compared to the number of variables, the less the outcome of validation tools such as cross-validation, <b>jack-knifing</b> model parameters and permutation tests can be trusted. The result depends crucially on the specific sample of subjects that is used for modelling.

40|$|Crashes {{in which}} lorries or vans are {{involved}} are often serious, {{especially for the}} crash opponent. Lorries are not only involved in crashes because of their drivers' unsafe behaviour (freights falling off, rollovers, <b>jack-knifing),</b> but also because other road users take too little account of them. Many road users do not realize {{that they can be}} positioned in the lorry's blind area or that a lorry can swerve out. Although delivery vans are smaller than lorries, they still are bigger and heavier than cars and their rear view is not as good. That is why the crash causes of delivery vans are often different from those of cars. Infrastructural measures, such as target-group lanes and keeping heavy freight traffic away from urban areas can result in safer lorry and van traffic. In addition, (intelligent) facilities in the vehicle, such as speed limitation devices, can be used. Yet {{it is also important to}} encourage a safety culture in haulage companies...|$|E
