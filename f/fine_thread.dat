25|$|Boris Ermolaev, a Russian psychic, {{was known}} for levitating small objects. His methods were exposed on the World of Discovery {{documentary}} Secrets of the Russian Psychics (1992). Ermolaev would sit on a chair and allegedly move the objects between his knees but due to the lighting conditions a <b>fine</b> <b>thread</b> fixed between his knees suspending the objects was observed by the camera crew.|$|E

The painting has two grounds, one a thick red-brown, the other a thin gray. The figure was initially drawn with brown underpaint left exposed in several places, now abraded. The face and hands are in good condition; extensively damaged areas in the figure and background have been covered with black overpainting, some of which was removed during a 1992 restoration.|$|E
500|$|Almost all ctenophores are predators – {{there are}} no vegetarians and only one genus that is partly parasitic. If food is plentiful, they can eat 10 times their own weight per day. While Beroe preys mainly on other ctenophores, other surface-water species prey on {{zooplankton}} (planktonic animals) {{ranging in size from}} the microscopic, including mollusc and fish larvae, to small adult crustaceans such as copepods, amphipods, and even krill. Members of the genus Haeckelia prey on jellyfish and incorporate their prey's nematocysts (stinging cells) into their own tentacles instead of colloblasts. Ctenophores have been compared to spiders in their wide range of techniques from capturing prey – some hang motionless in the water using their tentacles as [...] "webs", some are ambush predators like Salticid jumping spiders, and some dangle a sticky droplet {{at the end of a}} <b>fine</b> <b>thread,</b> as bolas spiders do. This variety explains the wide range of body forms in a phylum with rather few species. The two-tentacled [...] "cydippid" [...] Lampea feeds exclusively on salps, close relatives of sea-squirts that form large chain-like floating colonies, and juveniles of Lampea attach themselves like parasites to salps that are too large for them to swallow. Members of the cydippid genus Pleurobrachia and the lobate Bolinopsis often reach high population densities at the same place and time because they specialize in different types of prey: Pleurobrachias long tentacles mainly capture relatively strong swimmers such as adult copepods, while Bolinopsis generally feeds on smaller, weaker swimmers such as rotifers and mollusc and crustacean larvae.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to coarse and <b>fine</b> <b>threads,</b> {{there is another}} division of extra <b>fine,</b> or “superfine” <b>threads,</b> with a very <b>fine</b> pitch <b>thread.</b> Superfine pitch metric threads are occasionally used in automotive components, such as suspension struts, and are commonly used in the aviation manufacturing industry. This is because extra <b>fine</b> <b>threads</b> are more resistant to coming loose from vibrations.|$|R

50|$|Coarse threads {{are those}} with larger pitch (fewer threads per axial distance), and <b>fine</b> <b>threads</b> are those with smaller pitch (more threads per axial distance). Coarse threads {{have a larger}} threadform {{relative}} to screw diameter, where <b>fine</b> <b>threads</b> have a smaller threadform relative to screw diameter. This distinction is analogous to that between coarse teeth and fine teeth on a saw or file, or between coarse grit and fine grit on sandpaper.|$|R
2500|$|The Polish medium Stanisława Tomczyk {{active in}} the early 20th century claimed {{to be able to}} perform various acts of telekinesis, such as levitating objects, by way of an entity she called [...] "Little Stasia". A {{photograph}} of her taken in 1909, which shows a pair of scissors [...] "floating" [...] in between her hands, is often found in books and other publications as an example of telekinesis. Scientists suspected Tomczyk performed her feats by the use of a <b>fine</b> <b>thread</b> or hair, running between her hands to lift and suspend the objects in the air. This was confirmed when psychical researchers who tested Tomczyk occasionally observed the thread.|$|E

60|$|In {{the sphere}} of fantasy George Mac Donald has very few equals, and his rare touch of many aspects of life {{invariably}} gives to his stories a deeper meaning of the highest value.

60|$|The women {{went about}} as freely as the men. Instead of the cloaks, they wore mantles of fur or {{gorgeous}} feather work. Beneath these were several skirts or petticoats of different lengths, with highly ornamented borders. Sometimes loose flowing robes were worn over these, reaching to the ankles--those {{of the upper}} classes being of very fine textures, and prettily embroidered. Some of the women wore veils made of <b>fine</b> <b>thread</b> of the aloe, or that spun from the hair of rabbits and other animals. Others had their faces entirely exposed, their dark tresses falling luxuriantly ever their shoulders. These, Roger learned afterwards, were Aztecs, {{the rest of the}} women of Anahuac mostly wearing the veil; which was, however, extremely thin, and scarcely concealed the features.|$|E

60|$|Notwithstanding {{the absence}} of all comfort and {{convenience}} in their habitations, and the general squalidness of their appearance, the Shoshokoes {{do not appear to}} be destitute of ingenuity. They manufacture good ropes, and even a tolerably <b>fine</b> <b>thread,</b> from a sort of weed found in their neighborhood; and construct bowls and jugs out of a kind of basket-work formed from small strips of wood plaited: these, by the aid of a little wax, they render perfectly water tight. Beside the roots on which they mainly depend for subsistence, they collect great quantities of seed, of various kinds, beaten with one hand out of the tops of the plants into wooden bowls held for that purpose. The seed thus collected is winnowed and parched, and ground between two stones into a kind of meal or flour; which, when mixed with water, forms a very palatable paste or gruel.|$|E
60|$|One {{of those}} who stood near handed the Baron a leathern pouch, the Baron opened it and drew out a ball of <b>fine</b> <b>thread,</b> another of twine, a coil of stout rope, and a great bundle that looked, until it was unrolled, like a coarse fish-net. It was a rope ladder. While these were being made ready, Hans Schmidt, a thick-set, low-browed, broad-shouldered archer, strung his stout bow, and {{carefully}} choosing three arrows from those in his quiver, he stuck them point downward in the earth. Unwinding the ball of thread, he laid it loosely in large loops upon the ground so that it might run easily without hitching, then he tied {{the end of the}} thread tightly around one of his arrows. He fitted the arrow to the bow and drew the feather to his ear. Twang! rang the bowstring, and the feathered messenger flew whistling upon its errand to the watch-tower. The very first shaft did the work.|$|E
60|$|Withered grass abounds; and wheat, dhal (Cajanus) and gram (Cicer arietinum), Carthamus, vetches, {{and rice}} are the staple {{products}} of the country. Bushes are few, except the universally prevalent Adhatoda and Calotropis. Trees, also, are rare, and of stunted growth; Figs, the Artocarpus and some Leguminosa prevail most. I saw but two kinds of palm, the fan-palm, and Phoenix: the latter is characteristic of the driest locality. Then, for the animal creation, men, women, and children abound, both on the banks, and plying {{up and down the}} Ganges. The humped cow (of which the ox is used for draught) is common. Camels I occasionally observed, and more rarely the elephant; poneys, goats, and dogs muster strong. Porpoises and alligators infest the river, even above Benares. Flies and mosquitos are terrible pests; and so are the odious flying-bugs,* [Large Hemipterous insects, of the genus Derecteryx.] which insinuate themselves between one's skin and clothes, diffusing a dreadful odour, which is increased by any attempt to touch or remove them. In the evening it was impossible to keep insects out of the boat, or to hinder their putting the lights out; and of these the most intolerable was the abovementioned flying-bug. Saucy crickets, too, swarm, and spring up at one's face, whilst mosquitos maintain a constant guerilla warfare, trying to the patience no less than to the nerves. Thick webs of the gossamer spider float across the river during the heat of the day, as coarse as <b>fine</b> <b>thread,</b> and being inhaled keep tickling the nose and lips.|$|E
50|$|Bobbin lace may be {{made with}} coarse or <b>fine</b> <b>threads.</b> Traditionally it was made with linen, silk, wool, or, later, cotton threads, or with {{precious}} metals. Today it is made {{with a variety of}} natural and synthetic fibers and with wire and other filaments.|$|R

60|$|PINGUICULA VULGARIS.--This plant {{grows in}} moist places, {{generally}} on mountains. It bears {{on an average}} eight, rather thick, oblong, light green leaves, having scarcely any footstalk. A full-sized leaf is about 1 1/2 inch in length and 3/4 inch in breadth. The young central leaves are deeply concave, and project upwards; the older ones towards the outside are flat or convex, and lie close to the ground, forming a rosette from 3 to 4 inches in diameter. The margins of the leaves are incurved. Their upper surfaces are thickly covered with two sets of glandular hairs, differing {{in the size of}} the glands and in the length of their pedicels. The larger glands have a circular outline as seen from above, and are of moderate thickness; they are divided by radiating partitions into sixteen cells, containing light-green, homogeneous fluid. They are supported on elongated, unicellular pedicels (containing a nucleus with a nucleolus) which rest on slight prominences. The small glands differ only in being formed of about half the number of cells, containing much paler fluid, and supported on much shorter pedicels. Near the midrib, towards the base of the leaf, the [page 369] pedicels are multicellular, are longer than elsewhere, and bear smaller glands. All the glands secrete a colourless fluid, which is so viscid that I have seen a <b>fine</b> <b>thread</b> drawn out to a length of 18 inches; but the fluid in this case was secreted by a gland which had been excited. The edge of the leaf is translucent, and does not bear any glands; and here the spiral vessels, proceeding from the midrib, terminate in cells marked by a spiral line, somewhat like those within the glands of Drosera.|$|E
60|$|Considering we have fifty men {{of several}} tribes and tongues onboard, wild, half-savage looking fellows, and {{few of them}} feeling any of the {{restraints}} of morality or education, we get on wonderfully well. There is no fighting or quarrelling, as there would certainly be among {{the same number of}} Europeans with as little restraint upon their actions, and there is scarcely any of that noise and excitement which might be expected. In fine weather the greater part of them are quietly enjoying themselves--some are sleeping under the shadow of the sails; others, in little groups of three or four, are talking or chewing betel; one is making a new handle to his chopping-knife, another is stitching away at a new pair of trousers or a shirt, and all are as quiet and well-conducted as on board the best-ordered English merchantman. Two or three take it by turns to watch in the bows and see after the braces and halyards of the great sails; the two steersmen are below in the steerage; our captain, or the juragan, gives the course, guided partly by the compass and partly by the direction of the wind, and a watch of two or three on the poop look after the trimming of the sails and call out the hours by the water-clock. This is a very ingenious contrivance, which measures time well in both rough weather and fine. It is simply a bucket half filled with water, in which floats the half of a well-scraped cocoa-nut shell. In the bottom of this shell is a very small hole, so that when placed to float in the bucket a <b>fine</b> <b>thread</b> of water squirts up into it. This gradually fills the shell, {{and the size of the}} hole is so adjusted to the capacity of the vessel that, exactly at the end of an hour, plump it goes to the bottom. The watch then cries out the number of hours from sunrise and sets the shell afloat again empty. This is a very good measurer of time. I tested it with my watch and found that it hardly varied a minute from one hour to another, nor did the motion of the vessel have any effect upon it, as the water in the bucket of course kept level. It has a great advantage for a rude people in being easily understood, in being rather bulky and easy to see, and in the final submergence being accompanied with a little bubbling and commotion of the water, which calls the attention to it. It is also quickly replaced if lost while in harbour.|$|E

I lodge over against the house in Little Rider Street, where DD lodged. Don't oo lememble, maram? To-night I must see the Abbe Gaultier,(15) to get some particulars for my History. It was he who was first employed by France in the overtures of peace, and I have not had time this month to see him; he is but a puppy too. Lady Orkney has just sent to invite me to dinner; she has not given me the bed-nightgown;(16) besides, I am come very much off from writing in bed, though I am doing it this minute; but I stay till my fire is burnt up. My grate is very large; two bushels of coals in a week: but I save it in lodgings. Lord Abercorn is come to London, and will plague me, and I can do him no service. The Duke of Shrewsbury goes {{in a day or}} two for France, perhaps to-day. We shall have a peace very soon; the Dutch are almost entirely agreed, and if they stop we shall make it without them; that has been long resolved. One Squire Jones,(17) a scoundrel in my parish, has writ to me to desire I would engage Joe Beaumont to give him his interest for Parliament-man for Trim: pray tell Joe this; and if he designed to vote for him already, then he may tell Jones that I received his letter, and that I writ to Joe to do it. If Joe be engaged for any other, then he may do what he will: and Parvisol may say he spoke to Joe, but Joe's engaged, etc. I received three pair of <b>fine</b> <b>thread</b> stockings from Joe lately. Pray thank him when you see him, and that I say they are very fine and good. (I never looked at them yet, but that's no matter.) This is a fine day. I am ruined with coaches and chairs this twelvepenny weather. I must see my brother Ormond at eleven, and then the Duchess of Hamilton, with whom I doubt I am in disgrace, not having seen her these ten days. I send this to-day, and must finish it now; and perhaps some people may come and hinder me; for it im ten o'clock (but not shaving-day), and I must be abroad at eleven. Abbe Gaultier sends me word I can't see him to-night; pots cake him! I don't value anything but one letter he has of Petecum's,(18) showing the roguery of the Dutch.
