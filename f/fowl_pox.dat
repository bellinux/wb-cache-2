40|$|The diseased {{condition}} of chickens {{resulting from a}} lack of vitamin A in the diet is probably the most important of the nutritional diseases caused by A-avitaminosis in domestic animals. As pointed out by Beach (1) and Seifried and Schaaf (2), it causes serious losses on poultry farms. The clinical and anatomical picture closely resembles that found {{in some of the most}} important infectious diseases of <b>fowls,</b> chicken <b>pox,</b> coryza contagiosa, and infectious bronchitis. Golblatt and Benischek (3), Tyson and Smith (4), and Wolbach and Howe (5) have described the histological changes following a lack of vitamin A in the diet in guinea pigs, rats, and in one human individual. The characteristic changes are the substitution of stratified keratinizing epithelium for normal epithelium in various parts of the respiratory tract, alimentary tract, eyes, paraocular gland s and the genitourinary tract. No studies have been made of the histological changes in A-avitaminosis in fowls. It is the purpose of this paper to report such studies and to compare the changes with those found in certain infectious diseases. Material The material used consisted of 16 cases of A-avitaminosis, of which 12 were produced experimentally and 4 were spontaneous.

Approach: It describes {{the interaction between the}} susceptible and the infected birds which results in a system of ordinary differential equation. Introducing the control which represents the effort in applying chemoprophylaxis control u 1 and treatment control u 2 in birds with <b>fowl</b> <b>pox,</b> the system becomes a system of ordinary differential equations with control. Results: Our optimal control problem involves that in which the number of birds with latent and active <b>fowl</b> <b>pox</b> infections and the cost of treatment controls u 1 (t) and u 2 (t) were minimized subject to the differential Eq. 5 - 8. This involves the number of birds with active and latent <b>fowl</b> <b>pox</b> respectively as well as the cost of applying chemoprophylaxis control u 1 and treatment u 2 in birds with <b>fowl</b> <b>pox.</b> Conclusion: Analysing the model using Pontryaginâs Maximum Principle and optimality conditions, optimal effort necessary to reduce the transmission rate of <b>fowl</b> <b>pox</b> in the poultry has been determined.

40|$|The {{work which}} is here {{reported}} was undertaken {{in part as}} an extension of our previous observations on the behavior of pox viruses in the respiratory tract (1, 2) and in part {{to determine whether or not}} <b>fowl</b> <b>pox</b> virus was capable of simulating the clinical syndrome of chickens referred to as roup. Roup, which is also known by a variety of names as infectious catarrh, infectious rhinitis, and fowl coryza, is defined as a communicable disease of natural occurrence in chickens characterized by nasal and ocular inflammation which may or may not be accompanied by an outward discharge. Even before the etiology of roup was established a number of investigators, Haring and Kofoid (3), Beach (4), Doyle and Minett (5), were agreed that it was a distinct entity and unrelated to <b>fowl</b> <b>pox.</b> Their evidence was incomplete but was nevertheless significant since reciprocal protection was not demonstrable. We began an investigation of the syndrome in 1932 shortly after De Blieck (6) had shown that the influenza-like bacterium now known as Hemophilus gallinarum was of etiological significance. His work and ours (7 - 9), which led to the recognition of three clinical types of the disease, were likewise in agreement with these conclusions and afforded ample evidence that roup may. occur naturally and be reproduced experimentally in the absence of <b>fowl</b> <b>pox.</b> Much of the earlier work was concerned with the skin inoculation of normal birds with nasal exudates from naturally infected chickens, <b>fowl</b> <b>pox</b> virus not infrequently being demonstrable. The actual nasal instillation of virus suspensions or of exudates was only occasionally undertaken, with scant reference to the results even though an ocular-nasal form of <b>fowl</b> <b>pox</b> was recognized.

40|$|ABSTRACT Quail, chickens, and turkeys vaccinated with pigeon and <b>fowl</b> <b>pox</b> viruses {{were not}} {{protected}} against challenge of their immunity with quail pox virus and they developed severe cutaneous lesions of pox. When quail and chickens were vaccinated with quail pox virus and given pigeon and <b>fowl</b> <b>pox</b> challenge viruses, no protection was present. Thus, quail pox virus had no immunologic relationship to pigeon and <b>fowl</b> <b>pox</b> viruses. Psittacine pox virus applied as a vaccine in quail and chickens {{also failed to}} protect against quail pox virus challenge. However, quail, chickens, and turkeys vaccinated with quail pox virus were protected against quail pox virus challenge. An isolate of psittacine pox virus, applied as a vaccine, protected chickens against challenge with the same virus isolate and also against challenge with two other psittacine pox virus isolates, confirming a close or identical antigenic relationship with each other. When combined in a multivalent vaccine, quail, psittacine, and <b>fowl</b> <b>pox</b> viruses induced excellent protection in chickens against challenge with the three respective viruses. The {{presence or absence of}} "takes " or reactions following vaccination by the wing web route did not necessarily correlate with {{the presence or absence of}} immunity noted from challenge by feather follicle virus application.

40|$|An {{outbreak}} of <b>fowl</b> <b>pox,</b> which occurred in south-eastern Ontario between July 1988 and April 1989, {{was investigated in}} the spring of 1989 to determine factors associated with the spread of the disease. Clinical <b>fowl</b> <b>pox</b> was confirmed on five farms (cases). Twenty-seven farms, out of 35 egg producers with quota from Durham region to Northumberland county, provided information as controls. Bivariate analyses were performed on mail survey data using Fisher's exact test and odds ratios. Although the tests of hypotheses lacked statistical power because of the small number of case farms, and barns, a number of significant associations were found. At the farm level, <b>fowl</b> <b>pox</b> infection was associated with pullets purchased from a particular pullet grower. At the barn level, <b>fowl</b> <b>pox</b> infection was associated with pullets from a particular grower, mixing different groups of pullets, and a trend towards having birds early in the laying period, and higher numbers of birds placed. Fowl pox-infected barns had higher mortality and lower egg production postoutbreak. The results may indicate that the virus enters the laying barn at, or near, the time new birds are placed. Better communication among producers, catch-and-fill crews, and others associated with the egg industry, as well as more complete records of dates, sources, and persons involved with pullet placements, are recommended...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the antigenic differences among fowl, pigeon, and canary pox viruses. Also to, determine the cross protection potentials of these viruses and to select one of these viruses' isolates as live vaccine candidates against <b>fowl</b> <b>pox.</b> There was no death following challenge of experimental birds by canary pox virus (CPV). Where as, there was death of some birds followed challenge of experimental birds by fowl (FPV) pox virus and pigeon pox virus (PPV). This result showed that canary pox virus isthe safest of the three viruses for vaccination as a live vaccine. Fowl, pigeon and canary pox antigens were prepared by inoculating 0. 1 ml of 10 - 3 diluted isolates via chorioallantoic membrane of 11 - 12 day old embryonated chicken’s eggs. Inoculation of the CAM by the three viruses showed clear distinguishable pock lesions for each virus. Sera were obtained from experimental chickens. Examination of fowl, pigeon and canary pox antisera against <b>fowl</b> <b>pox,</b> pigeon pox and canary pox antigens respectively by AGPT test showed clear precipitin lines. Examination of fowl, pigeon and canary pox antisera against <b>fowl</b> <b>pox,</b> pigeon pox and canary pox antigens respectively by Passive haemagglutination (PHA) gave positive results. These result indicated that there is serological and antigenic relationship between the three viruses. V Titration of 0. 1 ml of each isolate of the 3 -viruses in embryonated chicken eggs showed that the EID 50 of fowl and pigeonspox viruses' were 10 9. 3 and that of canary pox virus was 10 10. 5. When pigeons were infected by fowl and canary pox viruses no lesions appeared. Also when canaries were infected by fowl and pigeon pox viruses no lesions appeared. But when Chicken were infected by canary, pigeon and <b>fowl</b> <b>pox</b> viruses lesions appeared. Thatmeans chickens are susceptible to both canary and pigeon viruses, so there is pathogenic relationship between chicken, pigeon and canary pox viruses, where as pigeons are resistant to fowl and canary pox viruses, which means thatthere is no pathogenic relationship between pigeons and canary and <b>fowl</b> <b>pox</b> viruses; also canary birds are resistant to fowl and pigeon pox viruses, which means there is no pathogenic relationship between pigeon and <b>fowl</b> <b>pox</b> viruses...|$|E

40|$|Fowl {{poxvirus}} (FPV) infection {{was observed}} in unvaccinated backyard chickens. A total of 15 birds were affected in a flock of 37. Pock lesions were observed on the comb, eyelids, beak and wattles. The birds appeared sick with roughened feathers and stunted growth. No mortality was recorded.

40|$|A {{total of}} 80 {{experimentally}} reared backyard chicks {{with the history}} of non-vaccinated parents to FPV vaccine were used for the determination of persistence of maternally derived antibody in chicks and to compare the efficacy of Poxine ® and DLS-FPV vaccine in protecting the chicks. Chicks were divided into five groups namely group A, B, C, D and E where each group contained 15 chicks except group A contained 20 chicks which was also used to determine the persistence of maternally derived antibody (MDA). Birds of group B and C were vaccinated with DLS-FPV at day 22 and 18 respectively through wing web puncture (WWP), whereas group D and E were vaccinated with Poxine ® at day 36 and 18 respectively. Sera were randomly colleted from 10 chicks of each group at 7, 14 and 21 days of post vaccination for the determination of antibody titre using PHA test. Ten chickens from each group were challenged three weeks post vaccination with 10 6 EID 50 / 0. 1 ml. “Take reaction ” was recorded to assess the better immune response in different groups after vaccination. Birds of group B, C, D and E showed 100, 86. 67, 93 and 86. 67 % “take reaction”, respectively. The highest Mean PHA titre was found 217. 60 ± 19. 55 in the chicks of group B.

Furthermore, the D-ELISA was efficient in de-tecting seroconversion with vectored vaccine, using recombinant Newcastle disease virus (rNDV) expressing glycoprotein D (gD) as the vaccine vector. Infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV), an alphaherpesvirus,causes an acute respiratory disease in chickens known as infec-tious laryngotracheitis (ILT) that leads to significant economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide (1, 2). Currently, live attenuated vaccines are used to control ILTV infections. However, these vaccines are not satisfactory since the vaccine virus can re-vert to virulence after bird-to-bird passage (3) and can induce latent infections (4). Due to these limitations, live virus-vectored vaccines expressing the surface glycoproteins of ILTV have been developed as a safer alternative to attenuated live vac-cines.

Mortality rates varied from 55 to 100 % for 0 – 30 day-old flocks; 30 % for 1 - to 4 -month-old; and 15 % for older turkeys. Next to ND, probable causes of mortality are <b>Fowl</b> <b>pox,</b> Gumboro disease, scabies, coccidiosis, histomonosis, capillariosis and colibacillosis. Only one farmer who fed and vaccinated the poults, and provided clean housing for them got a lower mortality rate of 11 % in turkeys less than 4 -month-old. The question remains why most farmers do not apply these simple practices: are they unaware or are the technologies not profitable...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey of}} some {{predominant}} poultry (exotic breeds) diseases {{was carried out}} in Katsina metropolis, Katsina state, Nigeria using an oral interview and a close ended questionnaire which was issued to 30 selected Poultry Farm Owners within the study area after a thorough consultation of the records at the State Veterinary Clinic. The disease found includes, Coccidiosis (23. 42 %), Infectious Bursal Disease (IBD) (14. 57 %), Newcastle Disease (NCD) (14. 28 %), Chronic Respiratory Disease (CRD) (13. 14 %), Pullorum Disease (10. 57 %), <b>Fowl</b> <b>pox</b> Disease (8. 28 %), fowl typhoid disease (7. 14 %), Marek’s disease (5. 14 %), Heat stroke (2. 57 %), and Fatty Liver Syndrome (0. 85 %) were also recorded in significant percentages across the study area. According to the data obtained from the Respondents, NCD, IBD, Coccidiosis, Pullorum disease, CRD and Marek’s disease have the highest economic impact in their business. As such a complete biosecurity measures should be imposed to the farms and also a proper medication and vaccination schedule should be adhered to as well...|$|E
40|$|Aim: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate the protection induced by different commercial <b>fowl</b> <b>pox</b> (FP) vaccines against local FP virus isolated from Giza governorate in Egypt during 2012. Materials and Methods: Efficacy of FP vaccines against local field isolates was determined in seven groups of (20 birds/group) 6 weeks old specific-pathogen free chicks. Each group was vaccinated via wing web with one of different FP living vaccines and (20) chicks in group (8) did not receive any FP vaccine and served as controls. At the 3 rd, 5 th, 7 th and 10 th-da post-vaccination (DPV), all birds were examined for the presence of takes at the site of vaccination. Three weeks post vaccination, serum samples were collected, and the levels of induced antibodies were detected by passive hemagglutination (PH) test. All birds in Groups (1 - 8 A) were challenged individually via the wing web with EID 50 103. 0 of the Egyptian isolated strain during 2012. Results: Takes detected at the site of vaccination at the 3 rd day were ranging from 45 to 70...|$|E
40|$|THE {{efficacy}} of Enheptin (2 -amino, 5 -nitrothiazole) {{in the treatment}} and prevention of blackhead (infectious entero-hepatitis) of turkeys has been demon-strated by DeVolt et al. (1951), Jungherr and Winn (1950), and Waletzky et al. (1950), and others. These investigators reported that, except {{for a short period}} of retardation in growth due to depressed feed consumption, no toxic effects were noted. At one time blackhead in chickens was considered to be a benign disease and of no economic importance. After vaccina-tion against <b>fowl</b> <b>pox</b> became a common practice, however, a change was noted. It was observed that, though a flock ap-peared to be in good health at the time of vaccination, heavy losses were suffered from blackhead. These losses usually began ten days to two weeks after vacci-nation and continued for ten or more days. This sequence of events can be explained by assuming that the chickens were car-riers of the blackhead parasite. Conse-quently, when the systemic reaction to the vaccine began, the natural defenses of the bird to the blackhead parasite wer...|$|E
40|$|The lesions of <b>fowl</b> <b>pox</b> {{are readily}} {{produced}} experimentally by the inunction of infectious material into the scarified or slightly injured epithelium of susceptible fowls (I). The characteristic eruption which closely {{resembles that of}} the natural disease will then appear {{at the site of}} inoculation in the course of 3 or 4 days. The virus is found to be present in greatest abundance in the local lesions. It has a specific predilection for multiplying within the susceptible epithelial cells which at the sites of infection become hyperplastic and hypertrophied, followed in the later stages of the disease by necrosis and ulceration. The presence of the virus within the susceptible epithelium is morphologically recognizable in the pathognomonic intracytoplasmic inclusions. These structures have been shown by Woodruff and Goodpasture (2) to be composed of a mass of smaller elementary or Borrel bodies which are surrounded by a lipoid capsule. The elementary bodies are now generally considered to represent the actual virus. A generalized distribution of the virus throughout the organism of the infecte...|$|E
