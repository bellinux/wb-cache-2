The {{spindle shaft}} of <b>heavy</b> load {{deflection}} <b>angle</b> milling head {{is an important}} functional component of 5 -axis CNC machine tool, which has characteristics of high torque and high power, used for large and complex free-form surface processing. The spindle shaft is modeled as Timoshenko’s beam by including the centrifugal force and gyroscopic effects. The effects on inherent characteristic of the spindle shaft of <b>heavy</b> load deflection <b>angle</b> milling head are analyzed owing to axial force and spindle shaft speed. Simultaneously, numerical solution of spindle shaft is gotten. And, the numerical results are well agree with the exact modeling, which illustrates that the theoretical modeling of spindle shaft is correct and the exact dynamic characteristics of spindle shaft is obtained. The analytical modeling results of spindle shaft are effective and helpful for design and improvement of spindle shaft of <b>heavy</b> load deflection <b>angle</b> milling head...|$|R

A stock {{had broken}} {{and half a}} sail had fallen shortly before, so the remaining half sail and its partner were removed, along with the stock. The roof was made watertight and the left side bottom side rail was strengthened. This work {{was carried out by}} Frank Farrow, Stanley Freese, Christopher Hullcoop, Vincent Pargeter and Peter Stenning. In 1967, the main post was strengthened with iron bars and steel hoops as it was badly split. The mill was at that time head-sick, and leant to the right. This was attended to, and the mill put back on an even keel. The right hand side girt was found to have broken at the joint with the crown tree. It was reinforced with a <b>heavy</b> <b>angle</b> iron bolted on top. In 1968, the two remaining sails were lowered for repair and the stock was reinforced by fitting a pair of clamps. In 1969, the Brake Wheel was repaired, with two new elm segments being made and fitted. The repaired sails were refitted in March and July. The striking gear was repaired, with the cross from Victoria Mill, Eye replacing that broken when the sail fell. On 7 February 1970, the mill turned by wind again. A lightning conductor was fitted and the Brake Wheel was re-cogged with hornbeam. The Brake Wheel originally had 61 cogs, and was refitted with 78 cogs when the mill was modernised. In 1971, work was done to get the left-hand pair of millstones into working order and repair the fantail carriage. In May 1972, the mill ground wheat {{for the first time in}} preservation.

On January 5, 1951, the Pennsylvania had departed Puget Sound loaded with $1.445 million worth of wheat for Japan. While she was off Cape Flattery, off of {{the northern tip of}} Vancouver Island, Canada, she battled gale winds up to 50 mph and very rough seas. At about 450 miles west of the Cape Flattery, her hull started to crack. The hull crack was 14-foot long on her port side. Her engine room was flooding and she had an <b>heavy</b> <b>angle</b> of list. The 45-foot seas pounded her into the night. Captain George P. Plover send out a SOS distress message and gave the abandon ship order. The 45 man crew lowered the four lifeboats and boarded them. The 40-foot waves now pounded the small 26-foot lifeboats. About 75 miles southwest of the Pennsylvania, the Japanese ship [...] had received the SOS distress message and arrived at about 10 am on January 10, 1951. But she only found some turned over lifeboats and parts of the ship. Planes from McChord Air Force Base, the US Coast Guard, the Whidbey Island Naval Air Station and ships from the Royal Canadian Navy arrived to look for survivors. But all that was found was move turned over lifeboats and more parts of the ship.

40|$|Trout fishing {{has long}} {{dominated}} California's freshwater angling picture. In 1936 {{roughly half of}} the State's 300, 000 angling licensees caught trout. In 1962, with 1, 588, 000 licensees, the proportion remained unchanged. <b>Heavy</b> <b>angling</b> pressure early depleted trout in many roadside waters. The stocking of "catchable-sized" hatchery trout soon followed, beginning in southern California before World War II. It spread rapidly throughout the State after the war, as the Wildlife Conservation Board provided more than $ 4 million for trout hatcheries. Currently, about seven million 7 -to- 8 -inch rainbow trout (Salmo gairdnerii) are stocked annually in California, {{at a cost of}} $ 1, 366, 000 (Fiscal Year 1962 – 63). The 1956 distribution of fish is shown in Figure 1. The same general pattern continues. This program created a need for rapid, inexpensive survey methods to determine if the many new "catchable" fisheries were functioning satisfactorily. Accordingly, a research project, D-J F- 14 -R, "Evaluation of Catchable Trout Stocking," was set up in 1954 to develop such a method, and to evaluate the new program. In 1956, this project was incorporated into the broader "Trout Management Study," D-J F- 8 -R. This project answered many troublesome questions. It quickly developed the desired new survey methods (Butler, 1957; von Geldern, 1961) and used them to inventory a series of widely scattered fisheries in various types of lakes and streams (Jensen, 1958; Delisle, 1959; Jensen and Butler, 1959; Kabel and Butler, 1959; Kabel, 1960; von Geldern and Kabel, 1960; Weidlein, 1960).

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{placement}} of self-tapping implants {{is associated with}} microfractures {{and the formation of}} bone chips along the cutting flutes. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of different cutting edge angles on chip formation during the machining of trabecular and cortical bone using instruments with a rough titanium surface. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mandibular cortical and trabecular bone specimens were obtained from freshly slaughtered domestic pigs. A predefined thrust force was applied to the specimens. Four specially designed cutting instruments that simulated dental implants and had a rough titanium surface were allowed to complete one full revolution at cutting edge angles of 55, 65, 75, and 85 degrees, respectively. Torque and thrust were measured during the cutting process. Bone chips were measured and weighed under a microscope. RESULTS: Different cutting edge angles did not lead to significant differences in torque. The lowest torque values were measured when the cutting edges were positioned at 65 degrees in trabecular bone and at 85 degrees in cortical bone. Bone chips were significantly larger and <b>heavier</b> at <b>angles</b> of 55 and 65 degrees than at angles of 75 and 85 degrees in trabecular bone. CONCLUSION: Instruments with a rough titanium surface show considerable angle-dependent differences in chip formation. In addition to bone density, the angle of the cutting edges should be taken into consideration during the {{placement of}} dental implants. Good results were obtained when the cutting edges were positioned at an angle of 65 degrees. This angle can have positive effects on osseointegration...|$|R
50|$|Johannes Vermeer (1632- 1675) of Delft {{was one of}} Netherlands' most {{prominent}} Dutch painters. Specialising in interior scenes, Vermeer developed a distinct style for his many domestic paintings. Popular with middle-class patrons, Vermeer offered glimpses {{into the lives of}} Holland's cultured citizens. Although little is known and/ or proven about Vermeer’s life, historians do know of his baptism and life in Delft where he was raised by a craftsman father and married a Catholic girl by the name of Catherina Blones. This marriage may have caused him to convert to Catholicism. As an innkeeper and art dealer, Vermeer painted dozens of paintings in which specific attributes can be noted. These attributes include the use of yellow and blue tones, the depiction of women, the use of wall coverings (maps, artworks, etc.), depiction of domestic tools, <b>heavy</b> drapery, light <b>angles</b> from the left, as well as prominent and telling facial expressions, and narrative-like objects. These touches allowed Vermeer to idealize his depiction of Dutch women and their values.

Smith then talked to cartoonists Paul Pope and Frank Miller about the idea and gained support. Smith postponed his idea on RASL as to complete Bone, and came back to it in 2007. He developed an idea of how the story would end and what would happen but needed to organize it into a full-fledged story. He flew out to Arizona, as he knew the story would be set in the desert.

40|$|Purpose of {{the study}} - to {{validate}} the selection algorithm of surgical treatment for patients with advance stage of ankle joint deforming arthrosis based on comparative analysis of risk factors for failed cases of fusion and joint replacements. Material and methods. The authors analyzed poor treatment outcomes and reasons therefore after ankle joints fusion and replacement surgeries performed at Vreden Russian Research Institute of Traumatology and Orthopaedics starting 2003 till 2014. First study group included 63 patients who underwent biarticular fusion of ankle and subtalar joint by intramedullary locked nail; second study group included 71 patients after ankle joint replacement using the following implants: Mobility (DePuy) - 27 patients, Hintegra (NewDeal) - 37 and STAR (Waldemar Link) - 7 patients accordingly. Clinical and radiological examination of patients {{as well as their}} surveying on pain rating scale and AOFAS scale was carried out in the period starting 6 months to 10 years from surgery. Results. Study results proved that severe deformities of ankle joint bones particularly varus or valgus deformities with angle above 100 preclude the possibility to correctly position the implant components and do not promise long term and successful functional recovery. Thus, fusion of affected joint should be recommended as treatment option to patients with abovementioned <b>heavy</b> deformities of <b>angle</b> joint. Reasonable fusion angles for ankle joint around 90950 in sagittal plane could diminish potential rapid arthrosis progression in midfoot joints. Conclusion.

40|$|Every year, nearly 1. 2 million {{persons are}} killed and 50 million are injured in road crashes around the world. Road crashes are {{anticipated}} {{to be among}} three top leading causes of deaths {{in the world by}} 2020. In Australia, almost 1, 400 people are killed and 32, 000 people are severely injured in road crashes annually. Of the different types of vehicles involved in crashes, heavy vehicles are a major traffic safety concern, due to their higher likelihood of involvement with fatal and severe injury accidents. In Australia, heavy vehicles contribute significantly to the nation&# 039;s economy because they are the major means for transporting goods in the country. In addition, it is predicted that heavy vehicle traffic will increase by 50 per cent by 2030. Therefore, {{the increase in the number}} of heavy vehicles will add to safety concerns because the probability of vehicle crashes increases by five per cent when the heavy vehicle percentage is higher than 30 per cent of total traffic volume. On the other hand, although heavy vehicles comprise only a small percentage, roughly 3 % of the total registered vehicles, this type of vehicle is involved in 18 % of total road fatalities. Therefore, the reduction in the number of crashes involving heavy vehicles has been proposed as one of the key performance indicators in the National Road Safety Strategy 2011 - 2020 for Australia. To reduce the trauma of heavy vehicle crashes, more research is needed to provide a better understanding of the factors influencing the frequency and severity of these crashes. The aim of this research is to identify the factors influencing heavy vehicle crashes and injury severity in Victoria, Australia. Therefore, in this research project, three studies were carried out to provide evidence-based recommendations to enhance the safety of heavy vehicles and save lives on Australian roads. In the first study, a crash severity model is developed to determine the variables influencing single-vehicle crashes involving heavy vehicles at intersections and mid-blocks. In the second study, a crash injury severity model is developed to determine the neighbourhood socioeconomic variables that influence injury severity in heavy vehicle collisions. Finally, in the third study, a crash injury severity model is developed to determine the causes contributing to injury severity in <b>heavy</b> vehicle <b>angle</b> collisions. In the first study, the objective was to identify the factors differentiating between single heavy vehicle collisions at intersections and mid-blocks using a binary logit model. The results show that single-vehicle crashes involving heavy vehicles at intersections are more likely to occur on main roads and highways, whereas crashes at mid-blocks are more likely to occur on higher speed roads, divided two-way roads, roads with special facilities or features (e. g. bridges), and roads with higher percentages of heavy vehicle traffic. Intersection crashes are also more likely to involve vehicles that are turning left or right, resulting in angle crashes, whereas mid-block crashes are more likely to involve vehicle overturning. The primary objective of the second study was to identify the neighbourhood socioeconomic characteristics affecting injury severity in heavy vehicle collisions. Specifically, the study explores the influences of the socio-demographic characteristics of the neighbourhoods where road users live and where the crashes occur. This study uses a multinomial logit model. In addition to neighbourhood socioeconomic variables, such as education, English language proficiency, occupation, income, and birthplace, other variables affecting road user injury severity, including environmental, temporal, road user, road, and vehicle characteristics, are considered as control variables. The results show that road users residing in neighbourhoods with more people born in Australia have higher injury severity, while road users living in neighbourhoods with more people with a university education and working in the sales profession have lower injury severity. Furthermore, crashes occurring in neighbourhoods with more people working as professionals are more severe. The findings present mixed results for the variables including technical education, clerical jobs and people born overseas for the neighbourhoods where the road users live, and variables such as people born in Australia, sales jobs and English language use for neighbourhoods where the crashes occur. The socio-demographic characteristics of the neighbourhoods where the road user resides and where the crash occurs contribute significantly to the road user injury severity in collisions involving heavy vehicles. It is important to emphasise that these neighbourhood socio-demographic characteristics should be used as a supplement to the information provided by the standard collision hotspot analysis. Finally, the main objective of the third study was to identify the factors contributing to injury severity in <b>angle</b> crashes involving <b>heavy</b> vehicles, in order to provide insights into improving traffic safety. The secondary objective was to compare the binary logic, skewed logistic (Scobit) and random parameters logit models in terms of their accuracy in identifying the factors contributing to injury severity in heavy-vehicle angle crashes. The findings indicate that the skewed logit model performs slightly better than the standard binary logit and mixed logit models in terms of the goodness of fit. The factors influencing injury severity in <b>angle</b> crashes involving <b>heavy</b> vehicles include occupants&# 039; gender, age, restraint use, and whether occupants are ejected or not, vehicle age, type, movement, fire status, point-of-impact and damage, time-of-day, road classification, posted speed limit and number of occupants involved in the accident. The output of this research will provide evidence-based recommendations to improve the safety of all road users, including heavy vehicle drivers on Australian roads. This study will also contribute to advancing knowledge in the field and will provide road safety professionals with more information and knowledge on the advantages of using statistical models, especially the Scobit model, in traffic safety studies...|$|R
