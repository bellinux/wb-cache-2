50|$|Because of the molecule's spherical {{shape the}} carbon atoms are highly pyramidalized, which has {{far-reaching}} consequences for reactivity. It {{is estimated that}} strain energy constitutes 80% of the heat of formation. The conjugated carbon atoms respond to deviation from planarity by orbital rehybridization of the sp² orbitals and pi orbitals to a sp2.27 orbital with a gain in p-character. The p lobes extend further outside the surface than they do into {{the interior of the}} sphere {{and this is one of}} the reasons a fullerene is electronegative. The other reason is that the empty low-lying pi* orbitals also have a <b>high</b> <b>s</b> character.|$|E
50|$|The plot of v versus S {{above is}} not linear; {{although}} initially linear at low S, it bends over to saturate at <b>high</b> <b>S.</b> Before {{the modern era}} of nonlinear curve-fitting on computers, this nonlinearity could {{make it difficult to}} estimate KM and Vmax accurately. Therefore, several researchers developed linearisations of the Michaelis-Menten equation, such as the Lineweaver-Burk plot, the Eadie-Hofstee diagram and the Hanes-Woolf plot. All of these linear representations can be useful for visualising data, but none should be used to determine kinetic parameters, as computer software is readily available that allows for more accurate determination by nonlinear regression methods.|$|E

50|$|The {{agricultural}} community maintained close {{relations with the}} neighboring Italian villages of the Val Cavargna which were reached by crossing the 1541 m <b>high</b> <b>S.</b> Lucio pass. Throughout most of its history the village was isolated {{from most of the}} rest of the country. This changed in 1854 when the first road was built into the valley. About three decades later, in 1886, another road was completed. The new roads tied the village more closely with the city of Lugano. In the 20th Century, the population dropped sharply because fewer agriculture jobs forced the residents to migrate to Lugano. Many houses have been converted to second homes and vacation homes. The main businesses in the municipality are a carpenter and an inn.|$|E

50|$|Because {{fluorine}} is so {{much more}} electronegative than hydrogen, in fluoromethane the carbon will direct hybrid orbitals <b>higher</b> in <b>s</b> character towards the three hydrogens than towards the fluorine. In difluoromethane, there are only two hydrogens so less s character in total is directed towards them and more is directed towards the two fluorines, which shortens the C—F bond lengths relative to fluoromethane. This trend holds all the way to tetrafluoromethane whose C-F bonds have the <b>highest</b> <b>s</b> character (25%) and the shortest bond lengths in the series.|$|R
