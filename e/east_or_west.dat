5|$|After {{a lengthy}} public {{debate over whether}} to place the station to the <b>east</b> <b>or</b> <b>west</b> of the Wallkill River, {{it was built in}} 1870 on the east bank, within the village of New Paltz. The rail line was {{formally}} opened during a large ceremony on December20, 1870. A decade later the station had become a popular departure point for the Mohonk Mountain House by many vacationers, including two U.S. presidents. In the late 19th century, over a dozen stagecoaches ran between the station and Mohonk daily.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{residents}} geographically {{define themselves}} {{in terms of}} whether they live on the <b>east</b> <b>or</b> <b>west</b> side of the Cuyahoga River. The east side includes the neighborhoods of Buckeye-Shaker, Central, Collinwood, Corlett, Euclid-Green, Fairfax, Forest Hills, Glenville, Payne/Goodrich-Kirtland Park, Hough, Kinsman, Lee Harvard/Seville-Miles, Mount Pleasant, Nottingham, St. Clair-Superior, Union-Miles Park, University, Little Italy, and Woodland Hills. The west side includes the neighborhoods of Brooklyn Centre, Clark-Fulton, Detroit-Shoreway, Cudell, Edgewater, Ohio City, Tremont, Old Brooklyn, Stockyards, West Boulevard, and the four neighborhoods colloquially known as West Park: Kamm's Corners, Jefferson, Puritas-Longmead, and Riverside. Three neighborhoods in the Cuyahoga Valley are sometimes referred to as the south side: Industrial Valley/Duck Island, Slavic Village (North and South Broadway), and Tremont.|$|E
5|$|However, further {{excavations}} {{revealed that}} the 8th-century temple was constructed over the remains of an older brick temple. According to Thirumoorthy, the garbhagriha or sanctum sanctorum of the brick temple was filled with sand and covered with granite slabs upon which the newer temple was constructed. Sathyamurthy, Superintendent, ASI Chennai Circle, said that the brick temple could be dated to the Sangam period as the shrine faced north unlike modern temples which face either <b>east</b> <b>or</b> <b>west.</b> This proved conclusively that the temple was constructed before the 6th or 7th century AD when the shilpa shastras, the canonical texts of temple architecture, were written. Estimates {{of the age of}} the brick shrine range from 1700 to 2200 years.|$|E

5|$|The Mainland is {{the largest}} island of Orkney. Both of Orkney's burghs, Kirkwall and Stromness, are on this island, {{which is also the}} heart of Orkney's {{transportation}} system, with ferry and air connections to the other islands and to the outside world. The island is more densely populated (75% of Orkney's population) than the other islands and has much fertile farmland. The Mainland is split into areas called East and West Mainland. These areas are determined by whether they lie <b>East</b> <b>or</b> <b>West</b> of Kirkwall. The bulk of the mainland lies West of Kirkwall, with comparatively little land lying East of Kirkwall.|$|E
5|$|The extreme {{points of}} India include the {{coordinates}} that are further north, south, <b>east</b> <b>or</b> <b>west</b> {{than any other}} location in India; and the highest and the lowest altitudes in the country. The northern-most and eastern-most points claimed by India are both in territory disputed between India and China. With the exception of Kanyakumari (Cape Comorin), the southern-most location of mainland India, all other extreme locations are uninhabited.But some consider Indira point as the extreme tip {{but it is not}} wrong but is not correct too.|$|E
5|$|When Kentuckian began sailing for American-Hawaiian, {{the company}} shipped cargo from East Coast ports via the Tehuantepec Route to West Coast ports and Hawaii, and vice versa. Shipments on the Tehuantepec Route would arrive at Mexican ports—Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, for {{eastbound}} cargo, and Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, for westbound cargo—and would traverse the Isthmus of Tehuantepec on the Tehuantepec National Railway. Eastbound shipments were primarily sugar and pineapple from Hawaii, while westbound cargoes were more general in nature. Kentuckian sailed in this service {{but it is}} not clear from sources whether on the <b>east</b> <b>or</b> <b>west</b> side of North America.|$|E
25|$|Another unifying {{factor is}} a {{straight}} street grid oriented in the cardinal directions. Most {{streets in the}} center are numbered with indications as to their location vis-à-vis the center, north, <b>east,</b> south <b>or</b> <b>west.</b> Outside the city center street names lose this system.|$|R

50|$|Cardinal marks {{indicate}} {{the direction of}} safety as a cardinal (compass) direction (north, <b>east,</b> south <b>or</b> <b>west)</b> relative to the mark.

5|$|The {{manipulation}} {{of time at}} higher latitudes (for example Iceland, Nunavut or Alaska) has little impact on daily life, because the length of day and night changes more extremely throughout the seasons (in comparison to other latitudes), and thus sunrise and sunset times are significantly out of phase with standard working hours regardless of manipulations of the clock. DST is also of little use for locations near the equator, because these regions see only a small variation in daylight {{in the course of}} the year. The effect also varies according to how far <b>east</b> <b>or</b> <b>west</b> the location is within its time zone, with locations farther east inside the time zone benefiting more from DST than locations farther west in the same time zone.|$|E

50|$|For waters {{where the}} {{direction}} of the related fairway is not obvious, such as where there are fairways leading in several directions or where there is navigable water outside designated fairways, cardinal marks are often used instead of lateral ones.

25|$|The larger energy {{consumption}} by ferries {{as opposed to}} via the fixed link is most clearly seen when comparing short driving distances from areas immediately <b>east</b> <b>or</b> <b>west</b> of the link.
