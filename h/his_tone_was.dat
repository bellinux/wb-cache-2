2500|$|In February, Lansdale {{offered a}} {{comprehensive}} review of all Operation Mongoose activities to date. <b>His</b> <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> urgent, stating that [...] "time is running against us. The Cuban people feel helpless and are losing hope fast. They need symbols of inside resistance and of outside interest soon. They need something they can join with the hope of starting to work surely towards overthrowing the regime." [...] He asked for a ramp up of efforts from all agencies and departments to expedite the execution of the Cuban Project. He laid out a six-part plan targeting the overthrow of the Castro government in October 1962.|$|E
2500|$|Tăgăduința lui Petru, {{believed}} by Mircea Martin to be {{a sample of}} Fondane's debt to André Gide, {{is the first of}} his works to take inspiration from the Bible (in this case, looking beyond the Talmud). Also Biblical in subject, Monologul lui Baltazar has been interpreted by Crohmălniceanu as a negative comment on nihilism and the Übermensch theory, notions embodied by the protagonist Belshazzar, legendary ruler of Babylon during the Jewish captivity. Fondane's progressive focus on Jewish Biblical sources mirrored the Christian interests of his mentor Arghezi. Like Arghezi, Fondane wrote a series of Psalms—although, according to Martin, <b>his</b> <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> [...] "too cadenced and solemn for one to expect a confrontation or a touching confession". However, Martin notes, the Jewish author either adopted or anticipated (depending on the reliability of his manuscripts' dating) Arghezi's poetry of exhortation and curses, in which ugliness, baseness and destitution speak directly to divinity. These sentiments are found in Fondane's Psalmul leprosului, which the same critic identifies as [...] "the series' masterpiece": ...|$|E
60|$|Though {{his words}} were unintelligible, <b>his</b> <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> insulting.|$|E
60|$|<b>His</b> <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> hostile decidedly, {{but that}} shall not prevent my {{making use of}} all his {{corrections}} where just.|$|R
60|$|Bertha {{was still}} {{watching}} Carthew's face. Cheerful as <b>his</b> <b>tones</b> <b>were,</b> {{there was an}} expression of anxiety in it. Three minutes later, he gave an exclamation as of relief, and a shout rose from the men forward.|$|R
60|$|<b>His</b> <b>tones</b> <b>were</b> so fearful, {{and he put}} so much {{emphasis}} on the last sentence, that the watchman burst hurriedly out of the galley.|$|R
60|$|He was {{obviously}} in earnest. <b>His</b> <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> kind and sympathetic.|$|E
60|$|I {{objected to}} his language, but <b>his</b> <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> {{kindness}} itself.|$|E
60|$|Craig {{patted her}} head. <b>His</b> <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> {{filled with the}} deepest despondency.|$|E
60|$|Her husband {{kept his}} place, {{and spoke to}} her as she stopped {{opposite}} to me. <b>His</b> <b>tones</b> <b>were</b> altered, but <b>his</b> manner showed as little feeling as ever.|$|R
60|$|Again {{it seemed}} to me that Ray was troubled by a certain speechlessness. When at last he found words, they and <b>his</b> <b>tone</b> <b>were</b> alike harsh, almost violent.|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Richard S. Ginell stated [...] "this isn't one of Getz's better gigs; <b>his</b> <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> {{not in the}} best of shape, and he sounds bored with some of the tunes".|$|R
60|$|He {{answered}} her without hesitation, but <b>his</b> <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> dull and spiritless.|$|E
60|$|Her heart sank. <b>His</b> <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> almost censorious. Nevertheless, {{she stood}} her ground.|$|E
60|$|<b>His</b> <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> vastly {{discouraging}} {{but it was}} {{too late}} to draw back.|$|E
60|$|Poor Grummidge {{had evidently}} been brought very low, for his once manly voice <b>was</b> weak and <b>his</b> <b>tones</b> <b>were</b> desponding. Never before, perhaps, was prayer offered {{in a more}} {{familiar}} or less perfunctory manner.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Stenson started. <b>His</b> visitor's <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> {{serious and}} convincing.|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Scott Yanow states: [...] "Land shows that hard bop {{was very much}} alive in Los Angeles in the late '50s. <b>His</b> <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> cooler and softer than it would become later on, but it was already pretty distinctive".|$|R
60|$|He bowed {{over her}} fingers. Then he looked up. <b>His</b> <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> impressive.|$|E
60|$|He {{broke off}} abruptly. When he spoke again <b>his</b> <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> as usual.|$|E
60|$|Lessingham turned {{once more}} to Philippa. This time <b>his</b> <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> more serious.|$|E
5000|$|Writing for Allmusic, {{music critic}} Scott Yanow {{wrote of the}} album [...] "The {{relatively}} little-known set finds the guitarist sounding {{very much like a}} self-sufficient orchestra, and although <b>his</b> <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> necessarily softer on acoustic than electric, he swings hard on the uptempo pieces." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Burton," [...] he said, {{speaking}} in a very serious tone--. All <b>his</b> <b>tones</b> <b>were</b> serious, but that which he now adopted was more solemn than usual. [...] "I wish to consult you on a certain matter, if {{you can give me}} five minutes of your time." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "His solos are {{models of}} creative, {{spontaneous}} artistry. <b>His</b> <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> full, rich and consistent; {{he is one}} of those masters who can achieve effortlessly any phrase that comes to his mind. His basic function as a rhythm player is fulfilled no less resourcefully when the others solo..." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was silent}} for a moment. When he spoke again <b>his</b> <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> changed.|$|E
60|$|His {{words were}} almost incoherent, but <b>his</b> <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> convincing. Her fears passed away.|$|E
60|$|Horlock {{laid his}} hand upon his companion's shoulder. <b>His</b> <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> {{suddenly}} grave--amply sympathetic.|$|E
60|$|Professor Porter {{finally broke}} the silence. <b>His</b> <b>tones</b> <b>were</b> no longer {{those of the}} erudite pedant theorizing upon the {{abstract}} and the unknowable; but those of the man of action--determined, but tinged also by a note of indescribable hopelessness and grief which wrung an answering pang from Clayton's heart.|$|R
6000|$|<b>His</b> <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> no less sorrowfully {{echoed by}} his new acquaintance. [...] "Still I am bound to tell you," [...] observes Allan after repeating his former assurance, [...] "that {{the boy is}} deplorably low and reduced and that he may be--I do not say that he is--too far gone to recover." ...|$|R
60|$|The Ensign {{looked at}} Ruth, {{as he had}} once before been seen to gaze on-the sorrowing {{features}} of the woman; but he spoke not. Meek folded his arms on his breast, and seemed to pray inwardly. There was, however, one who broke the silence, though <b>his</b> <b>tones</b> <b>were</b> low and menacing.|$|R
60|$|Wingrave's face fell, if {{possible}} into sterner lines. <b>His</b> <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> cold and hard.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Parker's {{expression}} never changed. Not {{a muscle}} twitched. <b>His</b> <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> even careless.|$|E
60|$|<b>His</b> <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> playful, but his eyes, {{directed}} at her face, were serious. She protested.|$|E
60|$|Not {{once had}} he smiled. <b>His</b> <b>tone</b> had <b>been</b> impersonal. He vaulted {{the fence and}} tramped away.|$|R
2500|$|Rev. I.M Jolly a very downtrodden and pessimistic {{minister}} of the Church of Scotland, presents a fictional show [...] "Last Call" [...] where he has a heart to heart with the audience where he tells them what he has been up to that week. <b>his</b> <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> always low-key and down beat.|$|R
6000|$|Gregory took an even brutal tone. It {{seemed to}} {{him as if he}} were forced to hurt her feelings. But his words, in spite of <b>his</b> <b>tone,</b> <b>were</b> not brutal; they might have even been thought flattering. [...] "The politeness is in the manner, and you don't need {{anything}} but your manner." ...|$|R
