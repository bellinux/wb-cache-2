30|$|Composite or {{laminated}} fabrics offer two advantages. First, they {{eliminate the}} labor involved in sequential upholstering of fabric layers, and second, they prevent exposure of underlying cushioning materials by ‘crack-opening’. When the multi-layered barrier fabric {{is exposed to}} flames, the heat is taken away by the outer coating or layer of the composite fabric, leaving the underlying substrate to which the coating or outer layer is laminated intact and preventing the involvement of underlying cushioning materials in the fire. For example, when a <b>glass</b> fiber <b>fabric</b> coated with polyvinyl chloride is exposed to flames, the polymer does not shrink away from the underlying <b>glass</b> fiber <b>fabric.</b> Instead, it softens and flows into the interstices of the <b>glass</b> fiber <b>fabric.</b> Laminated/coated fabrics eliminate the air space between the layers of barrier fabric and maintain the aesthetics of the exterior fabric while still providing better fire performance ([Schumann & Hartzell 1989]; [Decabromodiphenylether 2005]).|$|R
