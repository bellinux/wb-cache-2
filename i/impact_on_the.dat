5|$|Biological control {{can affect}} {{biodiversity}} through predation, parasitism, pathogenicity, competition, or other attacks on non-target species. An introduced control {{does not always}} target only the intended pest species; it can also target native species. In Hawaii during the 1940s parasitic wasps were introduced to control a lepidopteran pest and the wasps are still found there today. This may have a negative <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> native ecosystem, however, host range and impacts need to be studied before declaring their <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> environment.|$|E
