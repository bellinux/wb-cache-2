[...] In February 2009, Puzo won the suit, with Paramount paying out an undisclosed sum, thought to be in the region of several million dollars.|$|R
5000|$|Probably one of {{the best}} {{descriptions}} in the book is of the author's life as a child growing up in assorted Church of England vicarages,in a kind of social no-man's land, unable to mix with the council estate children opposite because they are socially inferior but also out of place in upper class society since a vicar's stipend was about £700 a year, equal to that of a skilled labourer living on a council <b>estate.</b> Raban <b>sums</b> his family's situation up in his own clinically detached manner: 'We belonged nowhere, We had the money of one lot, the voices of another - and we had an unearthly goodliness which removed us from the social map altogether.' ...|$|R

50|$|By {{effectively}} {{ending the}} practice of subinfeudation, Quia Emptores hastened the end of feudalism in England, which had already been on the decline for quite some time. Direct feudal obligations were increasingly being replaced by cash rents and outright sales of land which gave rise to {{the practice of}} livery and maintenance or bastard feudalism, the retention and control by the nobility of land, money, soldiers and servants via direct salaries, land sales and rent payments. This would later develop into one of the underlying causes of the Wars of the Roses, the English civil wars fought by the House of York and House of Lancaster for control of the English Crown from 1455 to 1485. By the mid-fifteenth century the major nobility, particularly the Houses of York and Lancaster, were able to assemble vast <b>estates,</b> considerable <b>sums</b> of money and large private armies on retainer through post-Quia Emptores land management practices and direct sales of land. The two noble Houses thus grew more powerful than the Crown itself, with the consequent wars between them for control of the realm.|$|R

The {{following}} year, on 4 February 1669, François Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Conti, {{known as}} le Grand Conti, bought the <b>estate</b> for the <b>sum</b> of 140,000 livres. The wealthy prince {{of the blood}} undertook many modifications, which {{are thought to have}} been carried out by Bullet. The Prince had the façades of the château redesigned and also had a small [...] "pavillon des bains" [...] built. By the time of the Prince's death in 1709, the whole estate had been completely updated. The estate remained the property of the Princes of Conti until the Revolution of 1789, when it was confiscated as biens nationaux.|$|R

The Peel family remained its owners until 1954, when they sold most of the estate, and the mansion was brought by the Reverend Max Williams in 1967. The estate was restored by the architect Peter Holden in around 1989. Plas Taliaris is now protected as a Grade I-listed building; this status was conferred on the hall on 7 August 1966.

The major part of Read's Island is in the parish of Winteringham despite the closest village being South Ferriby. It has been {{occupied}} at times in the past, at one point as a farm with cattle roaming along it, and when there are particularly high spring tides, at low water, {{it was possible for}} the cattle to reach solid ground by walking across the mud at low tide. In the 1930s cattle had to be transported by barge. The island then extended to some 600 acre and was used for summer grazing. It was locally famous for wildlife and hares.|$|R

Banning eventually pushed through a plan for a small railroad linking Wilmington/San Pedro with the main city of Los Angeles, effectively halving the time necessary for the trip, but the plan was short-lived. The Southern Pacific Railroad began building track to connect Southern California to the greater national railroad lines, and demanded much of Los Angeles' prime real <b>estate,</b> an enormous <b>sum</b> of money, and Banning's small connector line railroad in exchange for adding Los Angeles as a terminus on the railroad.

60|$|Folk {{who are at}} all {{acquainted with}} the traditions of Stapleford Park will {{not need to be}} told that {{in the middle of the}} last century it was owned by that trump of mortgagees, Timothy Petrick, whose skill in gaining {{possession}} of fair <b>estates</b> by granting <b>sums</b> of money on their title-deeds has seldom if ever been equalled in our part of England. Timothy was a lawyer by profession, and agent to several noblemen, by which means his special line of business became opened to him by a sort of revelation. It is said that a relative of his, a very deep thinker, who afterwards had the misfortune to be transported for life for mistaken notions on the signing of a will, taught him considerable legal lore, which he creditably resolved never to throw away for the benefit of other people, but to reserve it entirely for his own.|$|R
5000|$|After the {{property}} {{fell out of}} the hands of the Catholic Diocese of Newark, it underwent restorations. Placed on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places in 1995, in 1997 the Crocker Mansion was also placed on the National Register. In October 2005, Forbes reported that the mansion was on the market for $25 million, in what it described as a [...] "relative bargain." [...] Although the original estate had included 1,000 acres of land, by the time of the listing, development had pared the size down to 12.5 acres. After the developer-owners Darlington Associates tried to sell the 45,000-square-foot Crocker Mansion and 12.5 acres for $25 million, it was listed $11 million. In 2008, it was sold for $8.88 million to a business-owner in nearby Ramsey.

50|$|Evidently the {{regulations}} preferring male descendants {{may have come}} to be disregarded in some respects, as the Book of Job, which textual scholars date to the fourth century BCE, states in its epilogue that Job's daughters were given equal inheritance rights to his sons, and the Karaites always gave daughters the same rights as sons. By the Middle Ages it came to be a tradition to evade the inequality between daughters and sons via a legal fiction, in which the father claims that he is indebted to his daughter for a certain sum of money, and that this debt is due by him and his heirs, and then makes a formal agreement that this debt is to be paid upon his death, either in cash or as a proportion of his estate equal to half the share of one of the sons; by this legal mechanism, the daughter would either gain a share in her father's <b>estate,</b> or a <b>sum</b> of money equal to its value.|$|R

Andrew's predecessors had also donated royal estates in perpetuity, but mostly those situated in the borderlands. Breaking with this practise, Andrew gave away large domains which were located in the central regions. The new policy of donations, known as novae institutiones ("new arrangements"), significantly reduced the revenues of the ispáns of the counties, because one third of all royal revenues from their counties were due to them. The [...] "new arrangements" [...] also diminished royal revenues.
