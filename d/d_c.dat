40|$|Bivalve shells can {{potentially}} record the carbon isotopic signature of {{dissolved inorganic carbon}} (<b>d</b> 13 <b>C</b> DIC) in estuarine waters, thereby providing information about past estuarine biogeochemical cycles. However, the fluid from which these animals calcify is a ‘pool’ of metabolic CO 2 and external dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). The incorporation of respired 13 C-depleted carbon into the skeletons of aquatic invertebrates is well documented, and may affect the <b>d</b> 13 <b>C</b> record of the skeleton. Typically, less than 10 % of the carbon in the skeleton is metabolic in origin, although higher amounts have been reported. If this small offset {{is more or less}} constant, large biogeochemical gradients in estuaries may be recorded in the <b>d</b> 13 <b>C</b> value of bivalve shells. In this study, it is assessed if the <b>d</b> 13 <b>C</b> values of Mytilus edulis shells {{can be used as a}} proxy of <b>d</b> 13 <b>C</b> DIC as well as providing an indication of salinity. First, the <b>d</b> 13 <b>C</b> values of respired CO 2 (<b>d</b> 13 <b>C</b> R) were considered using the <b>d</b> 13 <b>C</b> values of soft tissues as a proxy for <b>d</b> 13 <b>C</b> R. Along the strong biogeochemical gradient of the Scheldt estuary (The Netherlands–Belgium), <b>d</b> 13 <b>C</b> R was linearly related to <b>d</b> 13 <b>C</b> DIC (r 2  =  0. 87), which in turn was linearly related to salinity (r 2  =  0. 94). The mussels were highly selective, assimilating most of their carbon from phytoplankton out of the total particulate organic carbon (POC) pool. However, on a seasonal basis, tissue <b>d</b> 13 <b>C</b> varied differently than <b>d</b> 13 <b>C</b> DIC and <b>d</b> 13 <b>C</b> POC, most likely due to lipid content of the tissue. All shells contained less than 10 % metabolic carbon, but ranged from near zero to 10 %, thus excluding the use of <b>d</b> 13 <b>C</b> in these shells as a robust <b>d</b> 13 <b>C</b> DIC or salinity proxy. As an example, an error in salinity of about 5 would have been made at one site.

There was considerable seasonal and spatial variation in <b>d</b> 13 <b>C</b> {{of the green}} alga Cladophora glomerata, microalgal-influenced epilithic biofilms, and their her-bivores. Algal and herbivore <b>d</b> 13 <b>C</b> were depleted in 13 C in small, unproductive tributary streams (244 ‰ to 230 ‰) compared with more productive sites downstream (231 ‰ to 223 ‰). The majority of variation in algal <b>d</b> 13 <b>C</b> of Cladophora and epilithic biofilms was determined by dissolved CO 2 (CO 2 aq) via effects on <b>d</b> 13 <b>C</b> of CO 2 aq and photosynthetic fractionation.
