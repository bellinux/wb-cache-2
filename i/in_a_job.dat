5|$|Homer and {{his wife}} Marge have three children: Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. As the family's provider, he works at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant as safety inspector. Homer embodies several American working class stereotypes: he is a crude, bald, obese, short-tempered, neglectful of the rules, clumsy, lazy, heavy drinking, ignorant and idiotic person; however, he is {{essentially}} a decent man and fiercely devoted to his family, often ignoring his own personal interests for those of his family. Examples include working long hours in order to buy Lisa a horse, dealing with Marge's sisters when they come over, moving back to Springfield instead of staying <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> he loves, getting Bart a ride back to Springfield after getting stranded during spring break, going to Lisa's band concerts, and giving up his love of pork chop night {{in order to take}} his family out on town to try something they like. Despite the suburban blue-collar routine of his life, he has had a number of remarkable experiences, including going to space, climbing the tallest mountain in Springfield by himself, making a movie with Mel Gibson, fighting President George H. W. Bush, fighting in professional boxing and earning a shot at the heavyweight title, and winning a Grammy Award.|$|E

25|$|The {{economic}} policy stance currently dominant {{around the world}} uses unemployment as a policy tool to control inflation; when cost pressures rise, the standard monetary policy {{carried out by the}} monetary authority (central bank) tightens interest rates, creating a buffer stock of unemployed people, which reduces wage demands, and ultimately inflation. When inflationary expectations subside, these people will get their jobs back. In Marxian terms, the unemployed serve as a reserve army of labor. By contrast, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> guarantee program, a buffer stock of employed people (employed in the job guarantee program) provides the same protection against inflation without the social costs of unemployment, hence potentially fulfilling the dual mandate of full employment and price stability.|$|E

Now, he studied various experimental and quantitative aspects of the permeability of soils to water and was able to work out some theories to explain the observations. He invented entirely new apparatus for the measurements and put in many long days of work to carry out the measurements himself. In 1924 he published much of it in his Magnum Opus, Erdbaumechanik (Soil Mechanics), which revolutionized the field to great acclaim. That resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> offer from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which he immediately accepted.|$|E

Not only is Charlie stuck <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> which demeans him, but he cannot (at least in Barton's case) have his story told.

Finally he shows himself to be a powerful individual in his own right, capable of extreme forms of destruction and therefore feared and/or respected.|$|E

Previous research showed that starters <b>in</b> <b>a</b> high strain <b>job</b> are indeed less satisfied. They are also not compensated for the high workload they face. In this paper, we raise the question whether this strain (‘high strain job’) is only temporary. The results of our duration analysis show that those starting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> high strain <b>job</b> leave their job significantly sooner than those <b>in</b> <b>an</b> active <b>job.</b> However, this is no guarantee that the strain is only temporarily, since there is a significant probability of still having <b>a</b> high strain <b>job</b> at the age of 26. This finding determines our policy implication: the discussion on work stress should focus on those trapped in high strain jobs. duration analysis, job-demand-control model of Karasek, job mobility...|$|R

Accumulating enough JP results <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> level up; new jobs are unlocked by attaining a certain level in the current job class (for instance, to become a Priest or Wizard, the unit must first attain Job Level 2 as a Chemist), which also allows the character to gain more JP in that class in battles. Once all the abilities of a job class have been learned, the class is [...] "Mastered". A soldier in a specific Job always has its innate skill equipped (Wizards always have [...] "Black Magic," [...] Knights always have [...] "Battle Skill") but a second job-skill slot and several other ability slots (Reaction, Support, and Movement) can be filled with any skill the particular soldier has learned from any job class.
