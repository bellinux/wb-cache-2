50|$|A 2016 study {{commissioned}} by the Transportation Research Board conducted a comprehensive longitudinal analysis of census block groups in Chicago. Block groups were categorized in one of 3 categories: block <b>groups</b> <b>with</b> bike lanes installed, block <b>groups</b> <b>with</b> sharrows only, and block <b>groups</b> <b>with</b> no cycling infrastructure. The authors found that blocks with bike lanes experienced a significantly larger increase in bicycle commuters than block <b>groups</b> <b>with</b> sharrows, which were only a bit better than those without infrastructure. Block <b>groups</b> <b>with</b> only sharrows installed were significantly less effective at reducing injuries per year per commuter than both block <b>groups</b> <b>with</b> bike lanes and even as block <b>groups</b> <b>with</b> no infrastructure. The study concludes that these findings raise concerns {{on the effectiveness of}} sharrows as a safety measure and as an incentive to bicycle commuting.In the discussion on this study it was criticized that block groups were compared instead of streets.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: It is a {{well-known}} result of the covering groups that a subgroup G of the fundamental group at {{the identity of a}} semilocally simply connected topological group determines a covering morphism of topological <b>groups</b> <b>with</b> characteristic <b>group</b> G. In this paper we generalize this result to a large class of algebraic objects called topological <b>groups</b> <b>with</b> operations, including topological groups. We also prove that the crossed modules and internal categories within topological <b>groups</b> <b>with</b> operations are equivalent. This equivalence enables us to introduce the cover of crossed modules within topological <b>groups</b> <b>with</b> operations. Finally, we draw relations between the coverings of an internal groupoid within topological <b>groups</b> <b>with</b> operations and those of the corresponding crossed module...|$|R
