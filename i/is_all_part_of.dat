25|$|The Treehouse Village: The {{people of}} this village believe that strange occurrences will befall them if they don't live high in tree tops. This is {{also a part of}} the green belt that runs through the fairy world. It <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Aeval’s plant network. Though others may doubt it, Aeval always knew that the trees saw and remembered everything. Over time they have been used to hide treasures and secrets. In The Book of Air, someone within the fairy world has turned the trees to gold, keeping them from “speaking” with Aeval. The trees are being used to protect a key – the very key the Clockmaker needs to fix his Time Synchronization Machine. Lyra must help the trees in order for the trees to help Lyra.|$|E

In the ensuing chase, Howard runs into a {{preparations}} room for the parade and is mistaken for a replacement for the actor who will play Turbo-Man on a parade float. As the [...] "real" [...] Turbo-Man, he presents the coveted limited-edition Turbo-Man doll to his awed son. Before he recognizes his father, Jamie is chased by Myron, who has dressed as Turbo-Man's arch enemy Dementor (having caught, tied up and gagged the real actor). As the crowd assumes this <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the show, Howard attempts to rescue his son by utilizing the Turbo-Man suit's equipment.|$|E
500|$|According to The New York Times, Friends with Benefits, a film [...] "about {{love and}} {{sex in the}} age of social networking, gets some of its juice and tang partly by trash-talking its own genre. The setup is familiar, as are the {{essential}} elements: a single man and a single woman, two battered hearts yet a pair of resilient, eager, pretty bodies [...] Friends with Benefits starts from the premise that its characters, and you, are sick of the romantic comedy clichés they may secretly, or not so secretly, adore." [...] Drew Pinsky, an addiction medicine specialist felt that the film's central characters, both of whom were raised by a single parent in the film, [...] "start looking for ways to solve that problem because they were never given the opportunity to grow an emotional landscape from a nurturing, available parent. They were just quickly parentalized and became a caretaker. And the caretaking <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the 'going for a broken person' and trying to fix them." [...] He further added that [...] "love addiction ending in 'happily ever after' is not a great message." ...|$|E

He {{is a fan of}} {{football}} and an ardent supporter of the Nebraska Cornhuskers; he routinely drives six hours to attend their home football games. He also [...] "appreciates the speed and violence of hockey"; conversely, he does not like basketball. During the offseason, he resides in O'Fallon, Missouri, which is barely over [...] from his birthplace of St. Charles, Missouri. According to his MLB.com biography, his hobbies include golfing, fishing, and completing crossword puzzles. In an interview, Asche said his favorite television show was Parks and Recreation, and his favorite food was chicken parmesan. He is close to his family, and noted that he started playing baseball around age five or six, with his first experience being playing in the back yard with his father and brother. When he was first called up to the major leagues, he noted, [...] "Emotions were crazy. Trying to hold back tears seeing your parents in the stands for the first time was tough, then playing on top of that made it a little crazy to start. But that <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> it. I think the phone call I got to make to my parents the day I was called up was the most memorable part ..." ...|$|E

2500|$|As the {{literary}} ambassador of pre-World War II Bermuda, Buechner offers readers a vivid {{guided tour of}} an enchanted time, recounting in exquisite detail its sights and sounds and smells and tastes: [...] cedar-laden, salt-sweet air; houses of sky blue and rose, lemon yellow and lavender, and pastel green; rain moving in curtains across the harbor; pale pink coral beaches; flat, sweet yellow buns; skies full of gulls; rum swizzles on the balcony at Twenty One; miles of coral roads, their chalky smell drying in the rain after a storm; the battered ferry chugging along with its stern nearly awash under a load of bicycles; the clip-clop of horse-drawn carriages, the carriages' fringed roofs, the chime of their bells. [...] For Buechner, this lush detail <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the [...] "sense of another time that I will carry {{with me to the}} end of my time." ...|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "The Beast Below" [...] (2010), a Dalek shadow {{can be seen}} during Prime Minister Winston Churchill's {{telephone}} conversation with the Eleventh Doctor. In [...] "Victory of the Daleks" [...] (2010), it is revealed that a Dalek ship survived its previous encounter with the Doctor, and fell back through time to 1941. The ship appears to be badly damaged, with only three surviving Daleks on board, [...] "at the end of [...] rope". The surviving Daleks discovered that a Progenitor, a small capsule containing pure Dalek DNA, had also fallen back though time. The Daleks retrieved it, planning {{to create a new}} race of Daleks, but were unable to activate the capsule, as it couldn't recognise these Daleks and, according to the Eleventh Doctor, saw them as [...] "impure". To solve this problem, they set a trap for the Doctor. This trap consists of building an android who believes himself to be human working undercover for the war cause. He claims to have invented the Daleks, calling them [...] "Ironsides". With Dalek blueprints and multiple Daleks painted in British Army Khaki, Winston Churchill uses them as war weapons, although they are mostly seen to be carrying around files and asking staff, [...] "Would you care for some tea?" [...] The Eleventh Doctor is surprised as these khaki Daleks appear to have forgotten their own purpose. This <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> their plan, however: he proclaims, [...] "I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks!" [...] which the Daleks back on the ship use as a testimony to activate the progenitor. The five New Paradigm Daleks that appear then exterminate their predecessors with no resistance, as they were deemed inferior. Each Dalek is a different colour and each represents a specific place in Dalek Hierarchy — Drone, Scientist, Strategist, Eternal and Supreme. The Daleks activate a time corridor, and escape into the future, delaying the Doctor by threatening to destroy Earth. Amy Pond doesn't recognise the Daleks when she first meets them, despite the Daleks' invasion of Earth and the planets appearing in Earth's sky, which the Doctor says is not possible. In [...] "Flesh and Stone" [...] (2010), the Eleventh Doctor theorises that the cracks in the universe caused the events to be unwritten.|$|E
