40|$|Abstract: The bio{{sand filter}} (BSF) is an {{intermittently}} operated, household-scale slow sand filter for which little {{data are available}} on the effect of sand composition on treatment performance. Therefore, bench-scale columns were prepared according to the then-current (2006 – 2007) guidance on BSF design and run in parallel to conduct two <b>microbial</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>experiments</b> of eight-week duration. Triplicate columns were loaded with Accusand silica or crushed granite to compare virus and E. coli reduction performance. Bench-scale experiments provided confirmation that increased schmutzdecke growth, as indicated by decline in filtration rate, is the primary factor causing increased E. coli reductions of up to 5 -log 10. However, reductions of challenge viruses improved only modestly with increased schmutzdecke growth. Filter media type (Accusand silica vs. crushed granite) did not influence reduction of E. coli bacteria. The granite media without backwashing yielded superior virus reductions when compared to Accusand. However, fo...|$|R
40|$|Methods for {{improvement}} of shelf-life stability of intermediate moisture foods are considered. It was found that vitamin C is the most limiting vitamin from a nutritional standpoint with its rate of destruction increasing with a sub w. Techniques <b>for</b> <b>microbial</b> <b>challenge</b> studies were developed. It was shown that organisms have a higher growth a sub w limit if the IMF is prepared by the adsorption process and long times are needed for challenge studies. Several alternative antimycotic systems were found. It was {{also found that the}} vegetative cells of pathogens have a maximum heat resistance in the IMF a sub w range. If glycols are in the formula, the IMF should have as high an a sub w as possible. The reverse is true if lipid oxidation occurs. In addition, to prevent rancidity, antioxidants and a low O 2 atmosphere are necessary. The package also must be a good moisture barrier...|$|R

However, reductions of challenge viruses improved only modestly with increased schmutzdecke growth. Filter media type (Accusand silica vs. crushed granite) did not influence reduction of E. coli bacteria. The granite media without backwashing yielded superior virus reductions when compared to Accusand. However, for columns in which the granite media was first backwashed (to yield a more consistent distribution of grains and remove the finest size fraction), virus reductions were not significantly greater than in columns with Accusand media. It was postulated that a decline in surface area with backwashing decreased the sites and surface area available for virus sorption and/or biofilm growth and thus decreased the extent of virus reduction. Additionally, backwashing caused preferential flow paths and deviation from plug flow; backwashing is not part of standard BSF field preparation and is not recommended for BSF column studies. Overall, virus reductions were modest and did not meet the 5 - or 3 -log 10 World Health Organization performance targets...|$|R
40|$|In this research, we {{question}} the straight-forward {{use of the}} classical sum of squared error criterion for identifying the typical parameters of a primary model (like growth rate mu(max) and lag time lambda) when applied to growth curves obtained in and on food products. Firstly, we base our reflections on 62 Listeria monocytogenes laboratory challenge tests collected in various environments (broth, crushed cold-smoked salmon, and surface of cold-smoked salmon slices). Whereas growth data in broth resulted in residual values consistent with a Gaussian distribution, growth data in the crushed product and even more {{on the surface of}} slices appeared different. Secondly, we propose the use of an alternative so-called robust non-linear regression method suitable when experimental error is non-normally distributed, which seems, according to this research, typical <b>for</b> <b>microbial</b> <b>challenge</b> tests in/on food products, and which lead to apparent outliers or leverage points in the experimental data. Properties of the robust regression procedure are illustrated on simulated data first, whereafter its use on the considered challenge tests is illustrated. To conclude, reflections on the assumptions and related realism underlying challenge tests and recommendations for fitting growth curves obtained in and on food products are presented.

40|$|Background. Although {{heat and}} {{moisture}} exchanging filters (HMEF) are recommended for use during anaesthesia, {{the criteria for}} choosing a filter are not clearly defined. Manufacturers offer {{many different types of}} HMEF with various technical characteristics. We compared the technical specifications provided by the manufacturers for different types of HMEF. Methods. Filter manufacturers were asked to provide technical information. Additional informa-tion was obtained fromwebsites. Information about 44 filters (16 mechanical and 28 electrostatic) was collated. Results. Filter performances were estimated with different sizes of microorganism and durations of challenge. Twenty-eight filters had not been tested by independent laboratories. For 12 of the filters, information obtained from websites and from the manufacturers differed. Most filter specifications claimed high efficiency, particularly <b>for</b> filtration, <b>microbial</b> <b>challenge</b> number and test duration. Electrostatic filters used in anaesthesia were claimed to have high filtration efficiency, similar to the efficiency provided by mechanical filters. Excluding moisture output values did not alter the general conclusions. Conclusions. Technical aspects of the tests, international standards, and independent validation should be considered when a filter is chosen...|$|R
40|$|Centralized {{drinking}} water treatment and distribution alone {{may not always}} be the most practical or cost-effective option. Also, some consumers seeking a proactive measure to reduce exposure to pathogens and chemicals not currently monitored or regulated might consider employing a POU/POE system. In addition, mobile POE and POU systems may have a proactive or reactive role in providing short-term treatment during natural disasters and protecting high asset facilities. Four POU and two POE technologies employing combinations of RO, carbon adsorption, and other components were tested to evaluate capabilities <b>for</b> reducing <b>microbial</b> and chemical <b>challenges</b> under varying operating conditions. <b>Microbial</b> <b>challenges</b> included the bacteria B. diminuta and H. psuedoflava, and the coliphage viruses fr, MS 2, and Phi X 174.

40|$|Purpose: Antimicrobial {{peptides}} (AMPs) are {{an essential}} part of innate immunity that evolved in most living organisms over 2. 6 billion years to combat <b>microbial</b> <b>challenge.</b> These small cationic peptides are multifunctional as effectors of innate immunity on skin and mucosal surfaces and have demonstrated direct antimicrobial activity against various bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. This review summarizes their progress to date as commercial antimicrobial drugs for topical and systemic indications. Methods: Literature review. Results: Despite numerous clinical trials, no modified AMP has obtained Food & Drug Administration approval yet for any topical or systemic medical indications. Conclusions: While AMPs are recognized as essential components of natural host innate immunity against <b>microbial</b> <b>challenge,</b> their usefulness as a new class of antimicrobial drugs still remains to be proven...|$|R

40|$|Microbial {{contamination}} of stored diesel/biodiesel fuel {{over time and}} the consequent changes in the fuel chemical composition is of serious concern. The use of biocides {{has also been shown}} to be an effective strategy to address this challenge but in some countries like Brazil, no products have been released and licensed to be used yet. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effectiveness of a multifunctional additive containing a biocide (i. e., 3, 3 -methylenebis(5 -methyloxazolidine); in short MBO) as 50 % of its formulation (AM-MBO 50) <b>for</b> controlling <b>microbial</b> contamination under simulated storage conditions. The experiment was conducted under two conditions: at lab-scale and in the field (real-world condition). In both experiments, B 10 blend treated with AM-MBO 50 as well as the untreated fuel blend were stored under simulated storage conditions for 35 and 90 d, respectively. The additive effectiveness and the changes in oxidative stability, water content, density, and viscosity were monitored. The results showed that the evaluated product was an efficient treatment to control microbial growth at 1000 ppm concentration, presenting a biocide action after 7 d in the tanks containing the treated fuel and with a low <b>microbial</b> <b>challenge</b> and a biostatic action in the tanks containing the treated fuel and with a high <b>microbial</b> <b>challenge.</b> In the tanks containing the fuel treated with AM-MBO 50, no adhesion of biofilm in the oil/water interface nor meaningful changes in the quality parameters such as oxidative stability, water content, viscosity, and density were observed after 90 d. A comparison between the lab-scale and field results showed that the application conditions determined at the lab-scale can only serve as preliminary guidance for the field (real-world) application and that they should be monitored and adjusted for each specific system...|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} {{effectiveness of}} a silver nylon (SN) fabric as an antimicrobial agent was evaluated {{in a series of}} in vitro experiments. The results indicated that silver ions from the SN fabric penetrated 2 mm of agar and killed a challenge of 6. 9 X 10 (7) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4. 1 X 10 (7) Staphylococcus aureus, and 1. 4 X 10 (7) Candida albicans organisms per cm 2 of SN fabric after 24 h of incubation at 37 degrees C.
