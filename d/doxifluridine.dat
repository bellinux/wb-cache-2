40|$|Capecitabine is an orally-administered {{chemotherapeutic}} agent {{used in the}} treatment of a. o. metastatic breast, gastric and colorectal cancer and is commercially available as an immediate release tablet (Xeloda®, Roche). Capecitabine is a pre-pro-drug that is enzymatically converted into 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) in the liver and the tumor. In tumor it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows tumor growth. To form 5 -FU, the activation of capecitabine follows a three-step enzymatic pathway with two intermediary metabolites, 5 '-deoxy- 5 -fluorocytidine (DFCR) and 5 '-deoxy- 5 -fuorouridine (DFUR). The metabolism of capecitabine to 5 -FU is fast (Cmax in 90 minutes) and follows the pharmacokinetic profile of capecitabine. Subsequently, 5 -FU is cleared rapidly and is undetectable in plasma after approximately six hours. Therefore, it is argued that the approved twice daily dosing (morning-evening) schedule of Xeloda® results in an in-between dosing capecitabine-exposure gap of approximately six hours. Clinical studies have shown that, {{as a consequence of the}} prolonged exposure and reduction of the 5 -FU peak plasma concentration, a continuous infusion instead of a bolus injection of 5 -FU increases the anti-cancer response rate and decreases toxicity in terms of a reduced recurrence and grade of some adverse events. The translation of this concept to an oral dosing scheme requires the development of an extended release oral dosage form. In this thesis, steps towards an extended release oral dosage form of capecitabine are described. The extended release dosageform was developed making use of spray dried amorphous capecitabine. Spray dried amorphous capecitabine shows an unexpected and slower dissolution behaviour than its crystalline form. Due to the intrinsic slow dissolution behaviour of the amorphous capecitabine only minor percentages of additional extended release excipients were needed to obtain reasonable and highly reproducible slow release. Stability profiling proofed the amorphous capecitabine to be chemically and physically stable. In addition Thermodynamic analysis capecitabine and <b>doxifluridine</b> revealed that the carbamate carbon chain of capecitabine is responsible for its non-crystalizing behaviour compared to the rapid crystalizing of its structure analogue <b>doxifluridine.</b> The developed extended release formulation making use of amorphous capecitabine and the release-modifier Kollidon® SR is currently tested in a clinical proof-of-concept study...|$|E

Various regimens for small cell lung cancer were administered in the present case, including CDDP + CPT- 11 + radiation (first-line), amrubicin (third-line), CBDCA + ETP (fourth-line), and nogitecan (fifth-line) (Fig.  7). After first-line therapy, a complete response of the metastatic site in the lung was confirmed on chest CT. S- 1 alone or S- 1 + CDDP has been administered as the standard treatment for advanced gastric cancer based on the Japanese gastric cancer treatment guideline [6] and two phase-III trials (SPIRITS trial: S- 1 vs. S- 1 + CDDP [7] and JCOG 9912 trial: fluorouracil vs. CPT- 11 + CDDP vs. S- 1 [8]). Additionally, several case reports documented good clinical effects of S- 1 or S- 1 + CDDP for NEC of the stomach in Japan [9 – 11]. Hainsworth et al. [12] performed a phase-II trial of three anticancer drugs including taxane (PTX, CBDCA, and ETP) in {{patients with}} poorly differentiated NEC of the gastrointestinal tract and reported {{a response rate of}} 53  % and median progression-free survival of 14.5  months. In the present case, no severe adverse effects occurred with the administration of S- 1 + PTX as second-line therapy (nine courses for 10  months) and docetaxel alone as sixth-line therapy (eight courses for 7  months) (Fig.  7). Some case reports have described good clinical responses with multiple combined chemotherapy for NEC of the stomach, such as CDDP + cyclophosphamide + epirubicin + vincristine sulfate, and ETP + CDDP + doxorubicin hydrochloride [13, 14]. However, the adverse effects of these regimens were severe. All six regimens administered in the present case involved one or two drugs, and it was possible to continue the chemoradiation therapy for 43  months (Fig.  7).|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Mistletoe (Viscum album L.) {{extracts}} {{are widely}} used in complementary cancer therapy. Aim {{of this study was}} to evaluate safety and efficacy of a standardized mistletoe extract (abnobaVISCUM® Quercus, aVQ) in patients with gastric cancer. Patients and Methods 32 operated gastric cancer patients (stage Ib or II) who were waiting for oral chemotherapy with the 5 -FU prodrug <b>doxifluridine</b> were randomized 1 : 1 to receive additional therapy with aVQ or no additional therapy. aVQ was injected subcutaneously three times per week from postoperative day 7 to week 24 in increasing doses. EORTC QLQ-C 30 and -STO 22 Quality of Life questionnaire, differential blood count, liver function tests, various cytokine levels (tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha, interleukin (IL) - 2), CD 16 + /CD 56 + and CD 19 + lymphocytes were analyzed at baseline and 8, 16 and 24 weeks later. Results Global health status (p + /CD 56 + and CD 19 + lymphocytes and liver function tests measured by ANOVA. Conclusion Additional treatment with aVQ is safe and was associated with improved QoL of gastric cancer patients. ClinicalTrials. Gov Registration number NCT 01401075. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The safety {{profiles}} of oral fluoropyrimidines {{were compared with}} 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) using adverse event reports (AERs) submitted to the Adverse Event Reporting System, AERS, of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Methods: After a revision of arbitrary drug names and the deletion of duplicated submissions, AERs involving 5 -FU and oral fluoropyrimidines were analyzed. Standardized official pharmacovigilance tools {{were used for the}} quantitative detection of signals, i. e., drug-associated adverse events, including the proportional reporting ratio, the reporting odds ratio, the information component given by a Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, and the empirical Bayes geometric mean. Results: Based on 22, 017, 956 co-occurrences, i. e., drug-adverse event pairs, found in 1, 644, 220 AERs from 2004 to 2009, it was suggested that leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were more frequently accompanied by the use of 5 -FU than capecitabine, whereas diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and hand-foot syndrome were more frequently associated with capecitabine. The total number of co-occurrences was not large enough to compare tegafur, tegafur-uracil (UFT), tegafur-gimeracil-oteracil potassium (S- 1), or <b>doxifluridine</b> to 5 -FU. Conclusion: The results obtained herein were consistent with clinical observations, suggesting the usefulness of the FDA's AERS database and data mining methods used, but the number of co-occurrences {{is an important factor in}} signal detection. </p...|$|E
40|$|Identification of gastric tumor-initiating cells (TICs) is {{essential}} to explore new therapies for gastric cancer patients. There are reports that gastric TICs can be identified using the cell surface marker CD 44 and that they form floating spheres in culture, but we could not obtain consistent results with our patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDTX) cells. We thus searched for another marker for gastric TICs, and found that CD 49 f(high) cells from newly-dissected gastric cancers formed tumors with histological features of parental ones while CD 49 f(low) cells did not when subcutaneously injected into immunodeficient mice. These results indicate that CD 49 f, a subunit of laminin receptors, is a promising marker for human gastric TICs. We established a primary culture system for PDTX cells where only CD 49 f(high) cells could grow on extracellular matrix (ECM) to form ECM-attaching spheres. When injected into immunodeficient mice, these CD 49 f(high) sphere cells formed tumors with histological features of parental ones, indicating that only TICs could grow in the culture system. Using this system, we found that some sphere-forming TICs were more resistant than gastric tumor cell lines to chemotherapeutic agents, including doxorubicin, 5 -fluorouracil and <b>doxifluridine.</b> There was a patient-dependent difference in the tumorigenicity of sphere-forming TICs and their response to anti-tumor drugs. These results suggest that ECM plays an essential role {{for the growth of}} TICs, and that this culture system will be useful to find new drugs targeting gastric TICs...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), {{frequently}} used in contraception and chemotherapy, {{was involved in}} a report of drug-drug interaction (DDI) when co-administrated with phenytoin, <b>doxifluridine</b> and cyclophosphamide. In order to clarify the mechanism of such interaction, an in vitro study was undertaken to evaluate MPA's potential to inhibit cytochrome P 450 (CYP) enzymes. Methods: Inhibitory effects of MPA on seven CYPs, including CYP 1 A 2, CYP 2 A 6, CYP 2 C 8, CYP 2 C 9, CYP 2 D 6, CYP 2 E 1 and CYP 3 A 4, were conducted in human liver microsomes. Time- and NADPH-dependent inhibitions were also tested. DDI potential was predicted according to the [I]/K-i value. Results: MPA was found to inhibit CYP 2 C 9 and CYP 3 A 4; half inhibition concentration (IC 50) was 16. 1 mu M and 31. 5 mu M, respectively. Slight inhibition was observed on CYP 1 A 2, CYP 2 A 6, CYP 2 C 8 and CYP 2 D 6 with IC 50 of more than 100 mu M. MPA exhibited activation rather than inhibition on CYP 2 E 1. Further study revealed that MPA showed a noncompetitive inhibition on CYP 2 C 9 and a competitive inhibition on CYP 3 A 4 with K (i) of 9. 0 mu M and 36 mu M, respectively. In addition, MPA was not a mechanism-based inhibitor to any of seven isoforms tested. By using predicted concentration of MPA in liver, [I]/K (i) was estimated to be 0. 24 and 0. 06 for CYP 2 C 9 and CYP 3 A 4, respectively. The concentration of phenytoin co-administrated with MPA was calculated to increase by 24 %. Conclusions: Based on our results, MPA can possibly cause clinically relevant DDI via the inhibition of CYP 2 C 9...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to test the activity and feasibility of an all-oral regimen of levo-leucovorin and <b>doxifluridine</b> (dFUR) in the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer and to establish whether the pharmacokinetics of dFUR and fluorouracil (FU) are affected by demographic and/or biologic parameters. Materials and Methods: One hundred eight patients with histologically proven colorectal cancer received orally administered levo-leucovorin 25 mg followed 2 hours later by dFUR 1, 200 mg/m 2 on days 1 to 5, with the cycle being repeated every 10 days. Results: Among 62 previously untreated patients, two complete responses (CRs) and 18 partial responses (PRs) were observed (overall response rate, 32 %; 95 % confidence interval, 21 % to 45 %). The median response duration was 4 months (range, 2 to 13) and the median survival time, 14 months. Among 46 pretreated patients, there were three CRs and three PRs (response rate, 13 %; 95 % confidence interval, 5 % to 26 %). In this group of patients, the median response duration was 4 months (range, 1 to 12) and the median survival time, 12 months. No toxic deaths were observed. The only World Health Organization (WHO) grade 3 to 4 side effect was diarrhea (32 patients). Conclusion: This regimen is active in previously untreated colorectal cancer patients and combines good compliance with safety. Limited but definite efficacy was also detected in the patients previously treated with FU, which suggests incomplete cross- resistance between the two drugs. The pharmacokinetic results suggest that the conversion rate of dFUR to FU increases between days 1 and 5, but that FU levels remain low in comparison to those measured after classical FU therapy. Under the experimental conditions used in this study, the interpatient variability of pharmacokinetic parameters remains largely unexplained by the tested variables. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
