5|$|It {{was during}} the filming of this episode that Michelle Trachtenberg, who {{would go on to}} play Buffy's sister <b>Dawn</b> <b>in</b> season five, first visited the set. Sarah Michelle Gellar had worked with her {{previously}} and suggested to Joss Whedon that she read for the part of Dawn.|$|E
5|$|For generations, Skagen's {{economy has}} been based on its fishing {{industry}} which continues to prosper today, facilitated by its fishing harbour, the largest in Denmark. Skagen also has the country's main herring processing facility and the world's largest fish oil factory. The town's evolving fishing industry led to considerable growth in the local population which reached some 11,500 in the 1960s. A fish auction is held at <b>dawn</b> <b>in</b> the harbour, and between May and October the harbour also attracts yachting enthusiasts.|$|E

5|$|In March 2014, Bush {{announced}} a 22-night residency called Before the <b>Dawn</b> <b>in</b> London from 26 August – 1 October 2014 at the Hammersmith Apollo. The BBC reviewed the concert positively. The set list comprised most of Hounds of Love featuring the entire Ninth Wave suite, most of Aerial including the entire second disc, two songs from The Red Shoes, and one song from 50 Words for Snow. Bush's first four albums and The Sensual World were noticeably {{excluded from the}} set list.|$|E
5|$|McFarlane Toys {{produced}} 500 {{units of}} a collectible statue to tie-in with Forward Unto <b>Dawn</b> <b>in</b> December 2012. The statue is a thirty-sixcentimetre (14") tall model of Master Chief fighting a Hunter, {{as depicted in}} Forward Unto Dawn. On November 6, 2012, {{to coincide with the}} release of Halo 4, Mega Bloks released a model of the UNSC spaceship, Forward Unto Dawn. The model is approximately onemetre (3') long and has scenes from both the video game and the web series.|$|E
5|$|On 4 October 1943, Smith {{took off}} from Idku at <b>dawn</b> <b>in</b> a Hurricane Mk IIC to escort a {{shipping}} convoy. Light was extremely poor, and Smith's throttle malfunctioned; he failed to take off quickly enough to clear a blast wall {{at the end of}} the runway. The undercarriage of the aircraft scraped against some sandbags on the wall, causing Smith to lose control of the plane and crash. The shoulder straps on his harness, built to withstand stress of up to , snapped, and his face was smashed against the Hurricane's gyrosight. Smith suffered serious facial injuries, and broke his jaw, a leg and a shoulder. Doctors thought at first that his back had also been broken, but it had only been buckled.|$|E

5|$|On November 31, Smyth tried again, {{ordering}} his men {{to embark}} two hours before <b>dawn</b> <b>in</b> order to avoid enemy fire. This time, the embarkation was so slow that, two hours after daylight, only 1,500 men were on board. Rather than attempt an amphibious landing in broad daylight, Smyth once again postponed the invasion. By this time, morale in Smyth’s command had plummeted: “all discipline had dissolved; the camp was a bedlam”. This, and widespread illness among the troops, persuaded a second council of war called by Smyth to suspend all offensive operations until the army was reinforced.|$|E
5|$|Operation Chronicle, the {{landings}} at Kiriwina and Woodlark Islands, was the VII Amphibious Force's first operation, presented {{no great}} difficulty as the islands {{were known to}} be unoccupied. However half the assault troops experienced seasickness, problems were encountered with clearing the sand bar at the entrance to Guasopa Harbor, and Barbey's decision to land at night and withdraw before <b>dawn</b> <b>in</b> order to avoid encountering Japanese aircraft highlighted the inexperience of his crews and deficiencies in their training. Unloading activities on the coral-fringed Kiriwina dragged on for a fortnight.|$|E
5|$|The Eye's {{importance}} {{extends to}} the afterlife as well. Egyptian funerary texts associate deceased souls with Ra in his nightly travels through the Duat, {{the realm of the}} dead, and with his rebirth at <b>dawn.</b> <b>In</b> these texts the Eye and its various manifestations often appear, protecting and giving birth to the deceased as they do for Ra. A spell in the Coffin Texts states that Bastet, as the Eye, illuminates the Duat like a torch, allowing the deceased to pass safely through its depths.|$|E

5|$|The nilgai is diurnal (active mainly {{during the}} day). A 1991 study {{investigated}} the daily routine of the antelope and found feeding peaks at <b>dawn,</b> <b>in</b> the morning, {{in the afternoon and}} during the evening. Females and juveniles do not interact appreciably with males, except during the mating season. Groups are generally small, with ten or fewer individuals, though groups of 20 to 70 individuals can occur at times. In a 1980 study in the Bardiya National Park (Nepal), the average herd size was of three individuals; In a 1995 study in the Gir National Park (Gujarat, India), herd membership varied with season. However, three distinct groupings are formed: one or two females with young calves, three to six adult and yearling females with calves, and male groups with two to 18 members.|$|E
5|$|The stated {{reason for}} the move was a {{campaign}} promise of Kiribati President Teburoro Tito to eliminate the confusion of Kiribati straddling the Date Line and therefore being constantly in two different days. However, Kiribati officials were not reluctant to attempt {{to capitalize on the}} nation's new status as owners of the first land to see sunrise in 2000. Other Pacific nations, including Tonga and New Zealand's Chatham Islands, protested the move, objecting that it infringed on their claims to be the first land to see <b>dawn</b> <b>in</b> the year 2000.|$|E
5|$|In March 2014, Bush {{announced}} her first live concerts in several decades: a 22-night residency called Before the <b>Dawn</b> <b>in</b> London from 26 August – 1 October 2014 at the Hammersmith Apollo. Tickets {{sold out in}} 15 minutes. The concerts received positive reviews. In August 2014, bolstered by the publicity around her upcoming performances, {{she became the first}} female performer to have eight albums in the Official UK Top 40 Albums Chart simultaneously, putting her at number three for simultaneous UK Top 40 albums (behind Elvis Presley with 12 albums in 1977, and The Beatles in 2009 with 11 albums. Note that in January 2016 following his death, David Bowie joined Elvis in the number one position with 12 albums); altogether she had 11 albums in the top 50. An eponymous three-disc album of recordings from Before the Dawn was released 25 November 2016.|$|E

5|$|On {{the final}} day of b'ak'tun 13, {{residents}} of Yucatán and other regions formerly dominated by the ancient Maya celebrated what they saw as the dawn of a new, better era. According to official figures from Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH), about 50,000 people visited Mexican archaeological sites on 21 December 2012. Of those, 10,000 visited Chichén Itzá in Yucatán, 9,900 visited Tulum in Quintana Roo, and 8,000 visited Palenque in Chiapas. An additional 10,000 people visited Teotihuacan near Mexico City, which is not a Maya site. The main ceremony in Chichén Itzá was held at <b>dawn</b> <b>in</b> the plaza of the Temple of Kukulkán, one of the principal symbols of Maya culture. The archaeological site was opened two hours early to receive thousands of tourists, mostly foreigners who came to participate in events scheduled for the end of b'ak'tun 13.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after <b>dawn,</b> <b>in</b> the air, a Japanese force {{consisting}} of eight dive bombers with 12 Zero fighter escorts attacked the Allied airfield at Gili Gili. One of the attacking aircraft was shot down, while {{only a small}} amount of damage was inflicted. Meanwhile, around the mission as the Japanese reconnoitred Australian positions, the 2/10th Infantry Battalion, {{consisting of}} just 420 men, was ordered to the Gama River by Clowes. This operation was badly planned and did not have a clear purpose; it was launched as both a reconnaissance in force and a counter-attack, but evolved into an attempt to establish a blocking force at KB Mission. Moreover, while the Australians had no knowledge of the strength or intentions of the Japanese, no force would be able to reinforce the battalion once it moved outside the main defensive lines near the airstrips. The 2/10th's forward patrols made contact with the 61st Infantry Battalion at around 10:30am on 27 August and, upon arrival at around 5:00pm, they began to establish their position; with only limited entrenching tools, they found the going difficult. At this point, the troops from the 25th and 61st Battalion were ordered to pull back, having lost 18 men killed and a further 18 wounded, along with an unknown number missing in action.|$|E
5|$|Typically {{operated}} {{from small}} aircraft carriers, large amphibious assault ships and simple forward operating bases, AV-8Bs {{have participated in}} numerous military and humanitarian operations, proving themselves versatile assets. U.S. Army General Norman Schwarzkopf named the USMC Harrier II as one of several important weapons in the Gulf War. The aircraft took part in combat during the Iraq War beginning in 2003. The Harrier II has served in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan since 2001, and was used in Operation Odyssey <b>Dawn</b> <b>in</b> Libya in 2011. Italian and Spanish Harrier IIs have taken part in overseas conflicts in conjunction with NATO coalitions. During its service history, the AV-8B has had a high accident rate, related to the percentage {{of time spent in}} critical take-off and landing phases. USMC and Italian Navy AV-8Bs are to be replaced by the Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning II, with the former expected to operate its Harriers until 2025.|$|E

5|$|A {{recurring}} theme in these myths is {{the effort of}} the gods to maintain maat {{against the forces of}} disorder. They fight vicious battles with the forces of chaos at the start of creation. Ra and Apep, battling each other each night, continue this struggle into the present. Another prominent theme is the gods' death and revival. The clearest instance where a god dies is the myth of Osiris' murder, in which that god is resurrected as ruler of the Duat. The sun god is also said to grow old during his daily journey across the sky, sink into the Duat at night, and emerge as a young child at <b>dawn.</b> <b>In</b> the process he comes into contact with the rejuvenating water of Nun, the primordial chaos. Funerary texts that depict Ra's journey through the Duat also show the corpses of gods who are enlivened along with him. Instead of being changelessly immortal, the gods periodically died and were reborn by repeating the events of creation, thus renewing the whole world. But it was always possible for this cycle to be disrupted and for chaos to return. Some poorly understood Egyptian texts even suggest that this calamity is destined to happen—that the creator god will one day dissolve the order of the world, leaving only himself and Osiris amid the primordial chaos.|$|E
5|$|Hogarth {{replicates}} all {{the features}} of the pastoral scene in an urban landscape. The shepherds and shepherdesses become the beggars and whores, the sun overhead is replaced by the clock on the church, the snow-capped mountains become the snowy rooftops. Even the setting of Covent Garden with piles of fruit and vegetables echoes the country scene. In the centre of the picture the icy goddess of the <b>dawn</b> <b>in</b> the form of the prim churchgoer is followed by her shivering red-nosed pageboy, mirroring Hesperus, the dawn bearer. The woman {{is the only one who}} seems unaffected by the cold, suggesting it may be her element. Although outwardly shocked, the dress of the woman, which is too fashionable for a woman of her age and in the painting is shown to be a striking acid yellow, may suggest she has other thoughts on her mind. She is commonly described as a spinster, and considered to be a hypocrite, ostentatiously attending church and carrying a fashionable ermine muff while displaying no charity to her freezing footboy or the half-seen beggar before her. The figure of the spinster is said to be based on a relative of Hogarth, who, recognising herself in the picture, cut him out of her will. Fielding later used the woman as the model for his character of Bridget Allworthy in Tom Jones.|$|E
