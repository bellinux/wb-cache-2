5|$|A {{downline}} is a rope {{leading from}} the surface down to the underwater workplace. It allows a commercial diver to travel directly {{to and from the}} job site and to control rate of descent and ascent {{in the same way as}} using a shotline. Also sometimes called a <b>jackstay.</b>|$|E
500|$|After Division 13's {{arrival at}} Cat Lo on 22 February 1966, {{operations}} started at nearby Rung Sat Special Zone; {{an area of}} tidal mangrove swamp southeast of Saigon that straddled the Long Tau River, the main shipping channel to the Port of Saigon. [...] was patrolling {{on the night of}} 9 March and intercepted a small junk attempting to smuggle supplies across the Soai Rạp River. After hailing the junk and receiving automatic weapons fire in reply, the cutter returned fire and killed several Viet Cong. They continued to fire on Point White so the skipper ordered the helmsman to ram the junk amidships at full speed. All but four of the crew of the junk were killed. One of the survivors {{turned out to be a}} key leader in the Viet Cong Rung Sat infrastructure. On 15 March [...] engaged and damaged another junk, but shallow water allowed the junk to escape. On 22 March [...] drew fire from another junk on the river. In the battle that followed, an estimated ten Viet Cong were killed. In conjunction with a joint U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps operation designated Operation <b>Jackstay,</b> several Division 13 cutters were ordered to patrol the lower portion of the Soi Rap River in an effort to deny food, water, and ammunition to the Viet Cong operating in the Rung Sat Special Zone. From the start of patrols on 10 March until the ships of the amphibious ready group put the Marines ashore on the Long Thành peninsula on 26 March, Division 13 cutters had taken fire from the shore almost every night during patrol operations. Some of the most intense combat operations that Squadron One encountered occurred during the month of March 1966 in support of Operation <b>Jackstay.</b> The joint operation ended 6 April with the withdrawal of the Marine Amphibious Force but the skipper of Point Partridge decided to continue the patrols after the operation ended. On the night patrols from 1 to 6 May Point Partridge engaged Viet Cong junks or received fire from the shore every night.|$|E

5000|$|The {{procedure}} for a search using two fixed <b>jackstays</b> and a movable search line is described: ...|$|R
50|$|When {{the object}} of the search is large enough and of {{suitable}} form to snag a dragged line, a snag-line may be used to speed up the process. The snag-line may be used with a pair of fixed <b>jackstays</b> or as a distance line for a circular search. It is often a weighted line, though there may be times when this is not required. The snag-line is held taut by the diver or divers, who will then drag it along the bottom as they either follow the <b>jackstays</b> or swim the arc until it hooks on something. When this happens the divers fasten their snag-line ends in position by tying them to the <b>jackstays</b> or pegging to the ground and swim along the snag-line to identify the target, If it is {{the object of}} the search, they will mark it, otherwise they free the line, move it over the target, return to their ends and continue the sweep.|$|R
2500|$|... 2 bells – Go {{out along}} the <b>jackstay</b> or {{distance}} line, or straight out away from tender ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 1966 Operation <b>Jackstay</b> was conceived. The {{operation}} {{was a plan}} to deny food and water to the Viet Cong hidden in the Rung Sat Special Zone by cutting off resupply junks that had to cross the Soài Rạp River. The interdiction efforts depended on using boats that were heavily armed, highly maneuverable and had a shallow draft; all characteristics of the Point Class cutter. Some of the Squadron One cutters were assigned in March 1966 to the operation and began 24-hour patrols on 10 March. The operation ended on 6 April; however, Point Partridge remained on the river patrol and had several contacts with Viet Cong supply junks during April and May 1966. From 1 May to 6 May she was involved every night with enemy junks or attacks from the shoreline. During {{the rest of the}} month she managed to capture two junks; one loaded with weapons and the other containing [...] of rice.|$|E
50|$|An {{underwater}} <b>jackstay</b> {{search is}} a procedure conducted by divers swimming along a search line - the <b>jackstay.</b>|$|E
50|$|If {{a series}} of sweeps does not find the object, one of the fixed <b>jackstays</b> may be lifted and re-laid on the {{opposite}} side of the remaining one, and the process repeated until the target is found or the entire search area has been searched.|$|R
50|$|Also {{known as}} cave lines, {{distance}} lines, penetration lines and <b>jackstays.</b> These are permanent or temporary lines laid by divers to mark a route, particularly in caves, wrecks {{and other areas}} where the way out from an overhead environment may not be obvious. Guidelines are also useful {{in the event of}} silt out.|$|R
50|$|Almost all ships used {{in modern}} times are fitted with steel safety wires (sometimes erroneously called <b>jackstays)</b> along the yards to which sailors attach {{themselves}} using a harness. This is a relatively recent innovation - cargo-carrying and naval sailing ships were not so equipped and falling from the yard represented a real (though less than commonly imagined) risk.|$|R
50|$|The divers {{start at}} {{opposite}} ends of the movable <b>jackstay</b> and swim along it, each diver holding the line with his left hand (or right, but both must use the same hand to keep them {{on opposite sides of the}} line) and searching the bottom visually or by feel on his side of the line until he passes the other diver and reaches the other fixed <b>jackstay,</b> at which point he will signal to the other diver that he has reached this point by a pull signal on the movable <b>jackstay.</b>|$|E
50|$|The divers {{then repeat}} this process until {{they find the}} object or run out of fixed <b>jackstay,</b> time or air. When a diver finds the object he should signal this to the other diver by rope pulls. The second diver can join him to confirm the finding and mark it or {{continue}} the search. If the movable <b>jackstay</b> snags it should be freed by the divers as the pass the snag. The sweep {{may have to be}} repeated after freeing a snag. The method of attaching the movable <b>jackstay</b> should be easily adjustable, but reliable.|$|E
50|$|There {{are various}} {{techniques}} for performing a <b>jackstay</b> search.|$|E
50|$|Recognisable {{topographical}} features may {{be remembered}} or noted and used identify position and direction. This is particularly useful if the visibility {{is sufficient to}} see the next landmark on the route before leaving the last. Landmarks are ordinarily considered permanent or semi-permanent features, such as ridges, boulders, wrecks or clumps of weed, but use can also be made of temporary marks such as anchor cables, shot lines, <b>jackstays</b> and guide lines.|$|R
50|$|According to this account, after {{guessing}} {{that there}} may be some attempt by divers connected with the Ordzhonikidze, the Soviet Navy had arranged for six underwater sentries to watch the bottom of the ship, which had been fitted with wire <b>jackstays</b> on either side to help them hold on to. When Crabb arrived, a struggle ensued in which Crabb's air supply was turned off and he passed out. He was then hauled on board, and taken to the sick bay (having passed out a second time) and given medical treatment.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} set and stow the square sails, the crew must climb aloft {{and spread out}} along the yards. To do this, they stand in footropes {{suspended}} beneath the yard and balance themselves between that and the yard itself. The person working {{on the end of}} the yardarm has a separate footrope known as the flemish horse. <b>Jackstays</b> run along the top of the yard - the sail will be bent on to one of them, but a second one is often provided (particularly on larger yards) for the crew to hold on to. These are usually steel rods, but stiff cordage stretched between the yardarms was used in the past.|$|R

5000|$|Although square sails {{are mostly}} worked from the deck, {{in order to}} be {{properly}} stowed (and released from this stowage) they must be folded by hand and tied to the yard with gaskets. This requires sailors to go aloft, during which time they stand on the footropes. The ropes are made of either fibre or wire, and are almost always protected from wear by being wormed, parcelled and served, so that the visible outer coating is of tarred thin line. They are attached to the yard via the <b>jackstays</b> or [...] "handrails" [...] to which the sails are also fastened, tied on with many turns of thin line. The inner parts of the footrope are held up towards the yard by vertical lines called stirrups; one of these is visible in the picture on the right. Also visible is the flemish horse that the outermost sailor stands on; because this yard is quite small the flemish horse actually extends fairly close to the centre.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>jackstay</b> {{is a line}} laid {{along the}} bottom to guide the diver during a search or {{to and from the}} workplace.|$|E
50|$|If {{the body}} of water is narrow enough, a surface team can lay a single <b>jackstay</b> across {{the width of the}} bottom, and the diver/s swim {{from one side to the}} other. When they reach the end of the line in the water, the surface team advance the <b>jackstay</b> by an {{appropriate}} amount by lifting it, moving it parallel to the original position and laying it down again, at which stage the divers make another sweep. This is repeated as often as necessary.|$|E

5000|$|Task Force 76 was the Amphibious Force, Seventh Fleet. Marines went ashore at Da Nang in March 1965 and patrolled {{throughout}} the I Corps {{area of responsibility}} during operations Starlite, Dagger Thrust, Double Eagle, and <b>Jackstay.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of Operation <b>Jackstay,</b> the Marines handed over responsibility for the zone to the 1st Battalion, 18th Infantry Regiment. [...] Responsibility for security in the zone was then passed to the Mobile Riverine Force and the 9th Infantry Division.|$|E
50|$|When both divers are at {{the fixed}} jackstays they will shift the movable <b>jackstay</b> along the fixed jackstays by an agreed {{distance}} depending on conditions. The distance should {{be large enough to}} reduce excessive overlap, but small enough that there is no risk of missing the target between traverses. This usually means that the distance is between the reach of the divers searching by feel in low visibility, and the distance they can see to the sides plus width of the target in good visibility. Care must be taken to always shift the movable <b>jackstay</b> in the same direction. This can be easily confused in low visibility, so a compass can be used to prevent this problem.|$|E
50|$|Common search {{techniques}} such as the circular search or <b>jackstay</b> search, need preparation and practice {{if they are to}} be used effectively and safely. The spiral box search and compass grid search require less preparation, but probably greater skill, and may be rendered ineffective by currents.|$|E

50|$|Following {{attacks on}} allied {{shipping}} on the Lòng Tàu River, from 27 March to 6 April 1966, 1st Battalion 5th Marines and two Battalions of Vietnamese Marines launched Operation <b>Jackstay,</b> a search and clear operation along the Lòng Tàu shipping channel killing 63 VC and seizing and destroying large supply caches.|$|E
50|$|After hauling cargo to Danang, Chu Lai, Camranh Bay, and Phan Rang, Washoe County {{joined with}} an amphibious ready group whose {{mission was to}} conduct an amphibious raid, Operation <b>Jackstay</b> against Viet Cong {{southeast}} of Saigon. She served in a pioneering role as an advance base providing gunfire support, arms, ammunition, rations, and water to assault boat groups.|$|E
50|$|On most ships, gaskets {{are made}} of rope. They are {{attached}} {{to the top of the}} yard and, left loose, would hang behind the sail. Gaskets should never be left dangling, however, so when the sail is set they are brought around underneath the yard and up the back of it and then tied to the <b>jackstay</b> (metal rod) where they originated. Alternatively, longer gaskets - particularly the clew gaskets described below - can be secured using a gasket coil. When the sail is to be stowed it is first folded and bagged neatly within itself, pulled onto the top of the yard, and then the gaskets are brought round over it and secured to the <b>jackstay</b> to hold it in place. Gaskets should be tied with a slippery hitch to enable them to be let off quickly, though if the yard is large there may only be enough rope to form a clove hitch when the gasket is brought round it.|$|E
50|$|While {{the ships}} can provide some food and stores support, their main cargoes are diesel and {{aviation}} fuel. Oakleaf {{was capable of}} replenishing ships with fuel using a standard <b>jackstay</b> or derrick rig abeam and towed rig for astern replenishment. She was fitted to take containers on her main deck {{for the provision of}} stores and to enhance ship's stores capabilities for long deployments.|$|E
50|$|A ropeway {{is a form}} {{of naval}} lifting device used to {{transport}} light stores and equipment across rivers or ravines. It comprises a <b>jackstay,</b> slung between two sheers or gyns, one at either end, from which is suspended a block and tackle, that is free to travel along the rope and hauled back and forth by inhauls (ropes attached to the pulley from which the block and tackle are suspended).|$|E
