The public body's representation must be clear, unambiguous and devoid of any relevant qualification; induced by the conduct of the decision-maker; made by a person with actual or ostensible authority; and applicable to the applicant, who belongs to the class of persons to whom the representation is reasonably expected to apply.|$|E
5|$|Cabral {{was later}} passed over, {{possibly}} {{as a result}} of a quarrel with Manuel I, when a new fleet was assembled to establish a more robust presence in India. Having lost favor with the King, he retired to a private life of which few records survive. His accomplishments slipped mostly into obscurity for more than 300 years. Decades after Brazil's independence from Portugal in the 19th century, Cabral's reputation began to be rehabilitated by Emperor Pedro II of Brazil. Historians have long argued whether Cabral was Brazil's discoverer, and whether the discovery was accidental or intentional. The <b>first</b> <b>question</b> has been settled by the observation that the few, cursory encounters by explorers before him were barely noticed at the time and contributed nothing to the future development and history of the land which would become Brazil, the sole Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas. On the second question, no definite consensus has been formed, and the intentional discovery hypothesis lacks solid proof. Nevertheless, although he was overshadowed by contemporary explorers, Cabral today is regarded as a major figure of the Age of Discovery.|$|E

25|$|The <b>first</b> <b>question</b> {{required}} {{the court to}} determine which head of power the law falls under.

He challenges theological fatalists to show how the addition of God's knowing some future-tense statement to be true adds anything essential to the problem over and above that statement's being true.|$|E
25|$|The main {{interest}} of the questionnaire was {{to see if a}} participant answered yes to the <b>first</b> <b>question,</b> implying that they believed in the hot-hand fallacy. The results showed that participants over 70 years of age were twice as likely to believe the fallacy than adults 40–49, confirming that the older individuals relied more on heuristic-based processes. Older adults are more likely to remember positive information, making them more sensitive to gains and less to losses than younger adults.|$|E
25|$|The PSFS sign {{has become}} a Philadelphia icon.

Loews briefly considered altering the sign by projecting the Loews name on it, but the idea was soon scrapped.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, Barre {{also sought}} to {{eradicate}} the importance of clan (qabil) affiliation within government and civil society. The inevitable <b>first</b> <b>question</b> that Somalis asked one another when they met was, 'What is your clan?'. When this was considered anathema {{to the purpose of}} a modern state, Somalis began to pointedly ask, 'What is your ex-clan?'. Barre outlawed this question and a broad range of other activities classified as clanism. Informers reported qabilists to the government, leading to arrests and imprisonment.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{catalyst}} for secession was slavery, especially Southern political leaders' resistance to attempts by Northern antislavery political forces {{to block the}} expansion of slavery into the western territories. Another explanation for secession, and the subsequent formation of the Confederacy, was white Southern nationalism. The primary reason for the North to reject secession was to preserve the Union, a cause based on American nationalism. Most of the debate is about the <b>first</b> <b>question,</b> as to why some southern states decided to secede.|$|E

Harry Blackmun wrote the majority opinion, joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, Byron White, John Paul Stevens, and Anthony Kennedy. Scalia wrote for himself and the other three dissenters, William Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, and Sandra Day O'Connor. His opinion exclusively concerned the <b>first</b> <b>question</b> and did not reach the second.|$|E

One {{contestant}} is onstage with the host, while the other is sequestered backstage so that he/she cannot hear the first portion of the round. The first contestant is asked five rapid-fire survey questions and has a set time limit in which to answer them (originally 15 seconds, extended to 20 in 1994). The clock begins to run only after the <b>first</b> <b>question</b> is asked, and the first contestant may pass on a question and return to it after all five have been asked, if time remains.|$|E
25|$|The {{answer to}} the <b>first</b> <b>question</b> is {{provided}} by introducing the Zariski topology, a topology on An whose closed sets are the algebraic sets, and which directly reflects the algebraic structure of k. Then U = V(I(U)) {{if and only if}} U is an algebraic set or equivalently a Zariski-closed set. The {{answer to the}} second question is given by Hilbert's Nullstellensatz. In one of its forms, it says that I(V(S)) is the radical of the ideal generated by S. In more abstract language, there is a Galois connection, giving rise to two closure operators; they can be identified, and naturally play a basic role in the theory; the example is elaborated at Galois connection.|$|E
