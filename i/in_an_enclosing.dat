Beware to not confuse {{this type of}} class with the nested class, which is declared {{in the same way}} with an accompanied usage of the [...] "static" [...] modifier; those have not the desired effect but are instead just classes with no special binding defined <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>enclosing</b> class.|$|E
50|$|The {{problem of}} packing {{multiple}} rectangles of varying widths and heights <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>enclosing</b> rectangle of minimum area (but with no boundaries on the enclosing rectangle's width or height) {{has an important}} application in combining images into a single larger image. A web page that loads a single larger image often renders faster in the browser than the same page loading multiple small images, due to the overhead involved in requesting each image from the web server.|$|E

50|$|The {{primary use}} of a union is {{allowing}} access to a common location by different data types, for example hardware input/output access, bitfield and word sharing, or type punning. Unions can also provide low-level polymorphism. However, there is no checking of types, so {{it is up to}} the programmer to be sure that the proper fields are accessed in different contexts. The relevant field of a union variable is typically determined by the state of other variables, possibly <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>enclosing</b> struct.|$|E
50|$|Function {{scope is}} {{significantly}} more complicated if functions are first-class objects {{and can be}} created locally to a function and then returned. In this case any variables in the nested function that are not local to it (unbound variables in the function definition, that resolve to variables <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>enclosing</b> context) create a closure, as not only the function itself, but also its environment (of variables) must be returned, and then potentially called in a different context. This requires significantly more support from the compiler, and can complicate program analysis.|$|E
50|$|All twelve {{colleges are}} built <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>enclosing</b> {{configuration}} around a central courtyard; {{all but two}} employ revivalist architectural styles popularized at Yale by James Gamble Rogers. Each has a dining hall, library, recreational facilities, a Master's House, apartments for resident fellows and Dean, and 250 to 400 student rooms, with most arranged in suites. Most reside in the colleges after their freshman year, during which they reside on the university's Old Campus. In addition to sharing common residence and dining facilities, students plan events, lectures, and social activities within their college, and compete against other colleges in a yearlong intramural sports championship.|$|E

50|$|In {{programming}} languages, closures (also lexical closures {{or function}} closures) are techniques for implementing lexically scoped name binding in languages with first-class functions. Operationally, a closure {{is a record}} storing a function together with an environment: a mapping associating each free variable of the function (variables that are used locally, but defined <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>enclosing</b> scope) with the value or reference to which the name was bound when the closure was created. A closure—unlike a plain function—allows the function to access those captured variables through the closure's copies of their values or references, even when the function is invoked outside their scope.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} chapel of ease {{was designed}} by C. Hodgson Fowler and built by R. Sanderson. It included a nave and chancel of cavity wall construction and was built of machine-pressed, sulphur-coloured bricks bearing a 'PEASE' stamp. The foundation course was sandstone and the walls were supported with buttresses. The nave was provided with benches for 200 worshipers and a lead-lined font occupied the west end. On the north side, a small connecting vestry led to a porch on the south side. The chancel had three windows <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>enclosing</b> arch and the long wall of the nave was lit by small lancet windows.|$|E
5000|$|The Leonine Wall, which {{defines the}} Leonine City, was {{constructed}} by Pope Leo IV following the sacking by Muslim raiders of Old St. Peter's Basilica in 846. Built from 848 to 852 {{as the only}} extension ever made to the walls of Rome, this three-kilometre wall completely encircled the Vatican Hill {{for the first time}} in its history. [...] An abortive start had been made by Leo III, but disturbances in the city had suspended work, and the Romans dismantled the sections that had been begun and used them in private constructions. Pope Leo IV used his estate workers, inhabitants from the surrounding countryside, Saracens captured after the sea battle of Ostia in 849 and funding from an imperial Frankish donation, to construct the wall, which ran <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>enclosing</b> U-shape from the riverbank at Hadrian's Mausoleum, soon to be Christened the Castel Sant'Angelo, up the slopes of the Vatican hill encircling the basilica and descending again to the river. The walling was constructed of tuff and tiling, forty feet high, with 44 strong towers at bowshot intervals. The massive round corner tower that still crowns the Vatican hill has its origins in this construction campaign.|$|E
