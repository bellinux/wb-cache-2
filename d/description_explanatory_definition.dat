40|$|The {{problem at}} the heart of the Thesis can be formulated, in its {{simplest}} form, as follows: What is (the nature of) state sovereignty? I approach this problem with a view to deploying one of the methodologies developed by analytical jurisprudence in tackling the quaestio vexata : What is (the nature of) law? In particular, I seek to deploy a method of the sort employed by John Finnis in offering an <b>explanatory</b> <b>definition</b> of law. Accordingly, I focus attention on the characteristic features of the paradigm case of state sovereignty. The trajectory drawn by the six Chapters of the Thesis is impelled by the following research question: what are the standing human needs that make sovereignty (despite the risks associated with its exercise) necessary and desirable for a state, both internally and externally? In order to answer this question, I first consider how external and internal (state) sovereignty have been conceptualised in the context of analytical jurisprudence. This allows me to establish that (state) law and (state) sovereignty are co-related, and directs me toward a study of legal discourse. On the basis of this correlation, I show that the concepts of external and internal sovereignty are associated with a (meta-) claim to state legal independence and a (meta-) claim to state legal supremacy. By analysing those claims, in the context of public international law and constitutional law discourse, I demonstrate that two needs in combination, the need for self-determination and the need for autonomy, underpin those claims. I conclude by arguing that state sovereignty, both externally and internally, is made necessary and desirable (despite the risks associated with its exercise) by the state political communityâs standing needs for self-determination and autonomy, which are rooted in the necessity and desirability of protecting a human personâs freedom in practical reasonableness. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{site of the}} Engelbourg ruined {{castle in}} Thann, Alsace, France, has been for some years the object of all the {{attention}} of the city, which is the owner, and also of partners like historians and archaeologists who are in charge of its study. The valuation of the site {{is one of the main}} objective, as well as its conservation and its knowledge. The aim of this project is to use the environment of the virtual tour viewer as new base for an Archaeological Knowledge and Information System (AKIS). With available development tools we add functionalities in particular through diverse scripts that convert the viewer into a real 3 D interface. By beginning with a first virtual tour that contains about fifteen panoramic images, the site of about 150 times 150 meters can be completely documented by offering the user a real interactivity and that makes visualization very concrete, almost lively. After the choice of pertinent points of view, panoramic images were realized. For the documentation, other sets of images were acquired at various seasons and climate conditions, which allow documenting the site in different environments and states of vegetation. The final virtual tour was deducted from them. The initial 3 D model of the castle, which is virtual too, was also joined in the form of panoramic images for completing the understanding of the site. A variety of types of hotspots were used to connect the whole digital documentation to the site, including videos (as reports during the acquisition phases, during the restoration works, during the excavations, etc.), digital georeferenced documents (archaeological reports on the various constituent elements of the castle, interpretation of the excavations and the searches, description of the sets of collected objects, etc.). The completely personalized interface of the system allows either to switch from a panoramic image to another one, which is the classic case of the virtual tours, or to go from a panoramic photographic image to a panoramic virtual image. It also allows visualizing, in inlay, digital data, like ancient or recent plans, cross sections, <b>descriptions,</b> <b>explanatory</b> videos, sound comments, etc. This project has lead to very convincing results, that were validated by the historians and the archaeologists who have now an interactive tool, disseminated through internet, allowing at the same time to visit virtually the castle, but also to query the system which sends back localized information.

40|$|Hate speech {{under the}} {{traditional}} Islamic perspective (Sharia) is ambiguous {{and that in}} turn increases hate speech under the justification of protection of freedom of expression. At the same time, the ambiguity in the definition for the concept of hate speech in Islam has been leading many countries to suppress peaceful political opposition under the justification of the fight against hate speech. Therefore, {{there is a need}} to study the interaction between the freedoms and restrictions to infer the dividing line between freedom of speech and hate speech. Consequently, it is possible to conclude a precise concept of hate speech from a traditional Islamic perspective. To address this issue, this study begins with reviewing provisions on Freedom of Expression and Hate Speech in the perspective of international and regional instruments, some Islamic national laws and some Islamic organizations. The study, then, move on to discuss the main problem thesis; it addresses that concept of hate speech through the provisions of primary sources of Islamic law, which are the Quran and Sunnah, and secondary sources such as consensus, juristic reasoning, preference, and public interest, in order to define this concept in a precise way. Consecutively, the study will examine five elements: forms, promoters, contents, contexts, and effects of speech in order to develop a holistic and <b>explanatory</b> <b>definition</b> of hate speech from the traditional Islamic law. After providing a definition of hate speech, this study will analyze examples of speeches issued by followers of Sunni and Shiite doctrines; the two terrorist groups, Al-Qaeda and ISIS, who ascribe themselves to Islam; and disputing parties in the Arab Spring States. Moreover, the study discusses the issue of freedom to criticize religions, including Islamophobia, from traditional Islamic law and international law. Lastly, in order to reach the real position of traditional Islamic law toward hate speech issued by Islamophobic individuals or groups, the study analyzes examples of their speech based on the definition of hate speech from a traditional Islamic perspective. The inevitable result of the dissertation revealed that the concept of hate speech can be defined based on the provisions of traditional Islamic law. According to this definition, speech issued by Sunni and Shiite doctrines; the two terrorist groups, Al-Qaeda and ISIS, disputing parties in the Arab Spring States and Islamophobic individuals or groups, they all, as the dissertation reveals, are classified as hate speech under the traditional Islamic perspective. The conclusion of this dissertation argues that the legal efforts, including developing a precise definition of hate speech, are not sufficient. Therefore, the dissertation proposes a holistic approach to limit hate speech through several measures, such as political, educational, social, and measures to regulate the media...|$|R
40|$|The global {{financial}} environment is constantly and rapidly shifting. This {{has resulted in}} changes to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). In support of the developments in the global business environment and the swift changes in IFRS, the local financial regulators have had to follow with supporting changes in national regulations. Taking the above factors into consideration, the auditing and accounting professions {{all over the world}} face various challenges, and South Africa (SA) is no exception. Thus, it was imperative for these professions in SA to make the same radical alterations. One of the areas demanding attention was the process of becoming a Chartered Accountant (CA). Inter alia, one focus area was the final examination in the qualifying process. The Chartered Accountant Qualifying Examination Part One (QE Part 1) has been changed from a closed-book assessment to an open-book assessment. This change is relevant because {{of the importance of the}} examination itself and the apparent lack of intensive research on students’ perceptions of this type of assessment. In my research I explored the perceptions of taxation students on open-book assessment in the QE Part 1. My study commenced with a focus group (consisting of students that had no previous open-book assessment exposure). I used Interactive qualitative analysis (IQA) as qualitative research method. During this focus group, the students identified ten perceptions (also referred to as affinities) on open-book assessment. For each affinity the focus group provided a descriptive name and an <b>explanatory</b> <b>definition.</b> These affinities were: good preparation, back-up, encourage, general advantages, improve quality of answers, negative symptoms, negative environment, personal experience and hindrance, different approach and time management. This group of students also identified relationships between these different affinities. These relationships were summarized and reflected in a system interrelationship diagram (SID). Findings from this SID indicated that students perceive good preparation as the strongest driver for successful completion of an open-book assessment. The SID indicates three primary outcomes namely negative symptoms, a different approach and time management. The affinities as identified by the focus group were then used during the interviews (conducted with students who had previous open-book assessment exposure). During the IQA interviews, the students were asked to comment on the posed affinities and the possible relationships between them. These findings were summarized and reflected in an interview SID. This SID indicated that these students perceived the primary driver in the system to be a different approach with two primary outcomes - negative environment and improvement in quality of answers. The IQA method is in essence a theory–generating tool that assisted me in my understanding of a group and individual students’ perceptions, before and after exposure to an open-book assessment.

Annotations represent textual or symbolic <b>descriptions</b> and provide <b>explanatory</b> or thematic information associated with spatial positions.

This technique solves the visibility problem of annotations in an approximate but user-centric way. It operates in real-time and therefore can be applied to interactive virtual landscapes. Additionally, the approach can be configured to fine tune the trade off between placement quality and processing time with a single parameter. ...|$|R
