On the other fourteen locomotives, the boiler was fed by two no. 13 live-steam injectors, one on each side and situated immediately in front of the firebox, mounted low enough to ensure that water could still be drained effectively from the water tender when the engine was on a 1 in 40 (2½%) gradient. The <b>injector</b> feed <b>pipes</b> led to a combined top-feed check valve, situated on the first barrel plate on the top centre-line of the boiler.

40|$|In Multijet Common Rail (C. R.) systems, the {{capability}} to manage multiple injections with full flexibility {{in the choice of}} the dwell time (DT) between consecutive solenoid current pulses {{is one of the most}} relevant design targets. Pressure oscillations triggered by the nozzle closure after each injection event induce disturbances in the amount of fuel injected during subsequent injections. This causes a remarkable dispersion in the mass of fuel delivered by each injection shot when DT is varied. The present works aims at investigating hydraulic circuit design keys to improve multiple injection performance of C. R. systems, by virtually removing the dependence of the injected fuel amount on DT. A Multi-Jet C. R. of the latest solenoid-type generation was experimentally tested at engine-like operating conditions on a high performance test bench. The considerable influence that the <b>injector</b> supplying <b>pipe</b> can exert on induced pressure oscillation frequency and amplitude was widely investigated and a physical explanation of cause-effect relationships was found by energetics considerations, starting from experimental tests. An optimization study was carried out to identify the best geometrical configurations of the <b>injector</b> supplying <b>pipes</b> so as to minimize pressure oscillations. The analysis was carried out with the aid of a previously developed simple zero-dimensional model, allowing the evaluation of pressure wave frequencies as functions of main system geometric data. Purposely designed orifices were introduced into the rail-pipe connectors or at the injector inlet, so as to damp pressure oscillations. Their effects on injection system performance were experimentally analyzed. Hydraulic circuit solutions that apply both optimized injector inlet-pipe sizes and oscillation damping orifices at the rail outlet were thoroughly investigated. Finally, the influence of the rail volume on pressure wave dynamics was studied to evaluate the possibility of severely reducing the rail capacitance. This would lead to a system, not only with reduced overall dimensions, but also with a prompter dynamic response during engine transient...|$|R

40|$|An {{innovative}} hydraulic layout for Common Rail (CR) {{fuel injection}} systems (FIS) without accumulator was further developed and assessed. The rail was removed and replaced by a high-pressure pipe junction to have faster dynamic system response during engine transients, smaller pressure induced stresses and reduced production costs. Compared to a commercial rail, whose internal volume ranges from 20 to 40 cm 3, the junction provided a hydraulic capacitance of about 2 cm 3 with the main function of connecting the pump delivery to the electroinjector feeding pipes. The modified injection system was realized and subjected to experimentation under engine-like working conditions on a high performance Moehwald-Bosch test bench. The injection performance {{of the new system}} with different hydraulic layouts was shown to be generally similar to those of a commercial CR system. Besides, for multiple injections, the new layout dynamics were substantially improved by a reduced dependence of the overall injected fuel amount on dwell-time (DT) during sequential injection events. This was achieved by selecting <b>injector</b> supplying <b>pipes</b> with an internal diameter and length out of the present production range.

When C4 reached the 19 mile it phoned Smithton, but, rather than being informed to wait for Spider, Mr Speers at Smithton was otherwise engaged, so Miss Geale at Smithton, with no knowledge of the agreement, gave C 4 permission to proceed. Spider, still intending to meet C4 at the 19-mile mark, met head on with C4 at the 20-mile mark in a violent collision. C4 only received damage to the cowcatcher, buffer and vacuum brake pipe, but Spider, being the smaller engine, with no momentum from a load behind, was badly damaged, with the head-on collision tearing the boiler from supportings and lifting it up. The water tank ripped from its mountings, the underside of the smokebox being lifted up on the boiler was crunched in, and the whistle and <b>injector</b> steam <b>pipes</b> were ripped from the steam dome.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes an}} {{experimental study of}} the structural and mixing characteristics of transverse jets, or jets in crossﬂow (JICF). Hot-wire anemometry, stereo particle image velocimetry (PIV), and acetone planar laser-induced ﬂuorescence (PLIF) measurements were utilized to illuminate and quantify the wind-ward (upstream) jet shear layer instability characteristics {{and their relationship to}} the velocity ﬁeld evolution, as well as the eﬀect of the overall velocity ﬁeld on the scalar ﬁeld distribution and resulting mixingcharacteristics. Transverse jets of various jet-to-crossﬂow momentum ﬂux ratios in the range 41 ≥ J ≥ 2, and jet-to-crossﬂow density ratios in the range 1. 00 ≥ S ≥ 0. 35, were generated using mixtures of helium and nitrogen in the jet ﬂuid. Jets were injected from one of three diﬀerent injectors explored: a convergent nozzle with circular geometry which was mounted ﬂush with the wind tunnel ﬂoor, another convergent nozzle with circular geometry whose exit plane lies above the crossﬂow boundary layer, and a ﬂush-mounted straight <b>pipe</b> <b>injector</b> with a circular oriﬁce. Jet Reynolds number was kept constant {{for the majority of the}} mixing and structural exploration experiments at Rej = 1900, except when the eﬀect of Reynolds number on cross-sectional jet structure was explored. Previous hot-wire based measurements at UCLA suggest that the upstream jet shear layer transitions from convective instability to absolute instability, giving rise to self-excited nonlinear states, as either the momentum ﬂux ratio is lowered below J ≈ 10, or the density ratio is lowered below S ≈ 0. 45 for the JICF injected from the ﬂush nozzle injector. A similar transition to absolute instability when lowering momentum ﬂux ratio was found in this work for the ﬂush-mounted <b>pipe</b> <b>injector.</b> Cross-sectional PLIF measurements in the present studies suggested clear correspondence between the formation of a symmetric counter-rotating vortex pair (CVP) and the generation of strong upstream shear layer instability. In contrast, weak, convectively unstable upstream shear layers corresponded with asymmetries in the jet cross-sectional shape and/or lack of a CVP structure. While momentum ﬂux ratio J and density ratio S most signiﬁcantly determined the strength of the instabilities and CVP structures, an additional dependence on jet Reynolds number for CVP formation was found, with signiﬁcant increases in jet Reynolds number resulting in enhanced symmetry and CVP generation. The mixing characteristics of Rej = 1900 jets of various J, S, and injector type were explored in detail in the present studies using jet centerplane and cross-sectional PLIF measurements. Various mixing metrics such as the jet ﬂuid centerline concentration decay, Unmixedness, and Probability Density Function (PDF) were applied systematically using a novel method for comparing jets with diﬀerent mass ﬂux characteristics. It was found that when comparing mixing metrics along the jet trajectory, strengthening the upstream shear layer instability by reducing J, and achieving absolutely unstable conditions, enhanced overall mixing. Reducing density ratio S for larger J values, which under equidensity (S = 1. 00) conditions would create a convectively unstable shear layer, was also observed to enhance mixing. On the other hand, reducing S for low J conditions, which are known to produce absolutely unstable upstream shear layers even for equidensity cases, was actually observed to reduce mixing, a result attributed to a reduction in crossﬂow ﬂuid entrainment into shear layer vortex cores as jet density was reduced. Comparing <b>injectors,</b> the ﬂush-mounted <b>pipe</b> was generally the best mixer, whereas the worst mixer was the nozzle that was elevated above the crossﬂow boundary layer due to upstream shear layer co-ﬂow generated by the elevated nozzle contour; this co-ﬂow was observed here and in prior studies to stabilize the shear layer. The eﬀect of the evolution of the velocity and vorticity ﬁelds on the scalar concentrationﬁeld was studied in more detail using simultaneous PLIF/PIV measurements of the jet centerplane. General correspondence between regions of high vorticity/strain and high scalar dissipation rate was found. Moreover, Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) analysis of both scalar and velocity ﬁelds suggested that transition to absolute instability with J reduction dominated the scalar ﬁeld evolution near the jet exit, consistent with the mixing results. However, time-varying and/or three-dimensional eﬀects resulted in scalar diﬀusion layer-normal strain rates extracted from PIV measurements to be consistently higher than that calculated from PLIF-based extraction of scalar dissipation rate data for strained advection-diﬀusion layers in the scalar ﬁeld. Nevertheless, trends in PIV-based strain ﬁeld evolution and PLIF-based scalar dissipation rate evolution along the upstream shear layers were generally consistent with one another, and diﬀerences in the magnitudes of wind-ward and lee-side strain rates provided evidence for associated diﬀerences in jet wind-ward and lee-side ignition processes in the presence of a reaction...|$|R
40|$|The use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) {{has become}} a {{well-established}} approach in the analysis and optimisation of impulse hydro turbines. Recent {{studies have shown that}} modern CFD tools combined with faster computing processors can be used to accurately simulate the operation of impulse turbine runners and injectors in timescales suitable for design optimisation studies and which correlate well with experimental results. This work has however focussed mainly on Pelton turbines and the use of CFD in the analysis and optimisation of Turgo turbines is still in its infancy, with no studies showing a complete simulation of a Turgo runner capturing the torque on the inside and outside blade surfaces and producing a reliable extrapolation of the torque and power at a given operating point. Although there have been some studies carried out in the past where injector geometries (similar for both Pelton and Turgo turbines) have been modified to improve their performance, there has been no thorough investigation of the basic injector design parameters and the influence they have on the injector performance. The aim of this research is to use modern CFD tools to develop models which aid the better understanding of Turgo impulse turbine runners and injectors and facilitate the optimisation of existing designs. CFD is used to model and optimise both the injectors and the runner of a modern commercial Turgo impulse turbine and the accuracy of the models are verified by carrying out experimental tests on the original and optimised designs. The original designs together with experience in the operation of these turbines were provided by the industrial sponsors of this research Gilbert Gilkes and Gordon Ltd. The research described in this thesis can be split into five main parts: 1. Development of a numerical model to analyses the flow through the Turgo runner using modern CFD tools combined with a series of assumptions to reduce the computational time while still retaining the accuracy of the model. Using this model to optimise the design of the Turgo runner provided by Gilkes. 2. Development of a similar numerical model for a simplified 2 D injector design to facilitate a study {{of the impact of the}} basic design parameters on the performance over a range of operating conditions. Applying these optimisations to the existing Gilkes design and taking the numerical analysis further by including the full injector geometry as well as the branch pipe and guide vanes. 3. Manufacture and experimental testing of the original and optimised Turgo runners. 4. Manufacture and experimental testing of the original and optimised injector designs. 5. Verification of the numerical models developed in 1.) and 2.) by comparison with the experimental results. The numerical model developed in 1.) includes several simplifying assumptions in order to reduce the computational time and produce models which could solve in reasonable timescales allowing many design variations to be analysed. As the runner simulations require a transient analysis of complex multi-phase free surface flow with a rotating frame of reference they are already computationally costly and efforts have to be made to reduce this computational cost if the models are to be effective for optimisation purposes. The runner model simplifications were the exclusion of any casing interactions by not modelling the casing and the use of a 2 blade model analysing only a single blade passage in order to reduce the size of the computational domain. Several modelling assumptions were also introduced and attempts are made to quantify the effects of these assumptions through unit tests. For discretisation of the domain two mesh sizes were used, a coarse mesh which slightly under predicts the efficiency but was suitable for comparing designs and a fine mesh which gave mesh independent results. The fine mesh took over 4 times longer to solve rendering it unfeasible for optimisation purposes and it was therefore used only at key points to verify the design changes made using the coarse mesh. The analysis and optimisation of the injectors carried out in 2.) use similar CFD tools as the runner analysis however the geometry (excluding the branch pipe and guide vanes) could be simplified into a 2 D axisymmetric case operating at steady state conditions. This drastically reduces the solve time and allows the use of a mesh independent model and the analysis of hundreds of designs and operating conditions. Once the optimisations had been carried out, the design changes were verified by extending the model to analyse the 3 D case with a straight pipe upstream of the injector and a 3 D full case including the branch pipe and guide vanes. In 3.), following the optimisation of the runner in 1.), a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of the runner was carried out to ensure the optimised runner had sufficient strength for operation at the highest heads recommended for a runner of this size. The design was strengthened based on the results of the FEA and CFD was carried out in conjunction with these changes to ensure minimal loss in hydraulic efficiency. The manufacturing process was also researched and Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DFMA) was applied to the strengthened design identifying two optimised designs (LE 4 and LE 1) which will be tested before and after additional dressing of the leading edges. Both optimised runner designs were manufactured and tested at the Laboratory of Hydraulic Machines, National Technical University of Athens (NTUA). Following the injector analysis and optimisations in 2.), the optimised injectors were manufactured for experimental testing using both the Pelton and the Turgo test rig at NTUA in 4.). As the design changes made were not critical to the strength of the injectors there was no need to carry out a FEA. The CFD model verification in Part 5.) looks initially at the full Turgo system in order to compare the absolute difference between the numerical efficiency and the experimental efficiency of the original Turgo runner at the best efficiency point. The mechanical losses of the test rig are estimated to determine the experimental hydraulic efficiency. The numerical hydraulic efficiency is then determined by calculating the losses upstream of the <b>injector,</b> using standard <b>pipe</b> flow equations and combing these with the losses through the injector, as well as the numerical efficiency of the runner by simulating the runner using the ‘real jet’ profile produced by the full injector simulations. The results showed the numerical model to be over-predicting the efficiency by 1. 26 %. The numerical difference in the performance of the two injectors is then compared to the experimental difference measured during testing. This is done by importing the ‘real jet’ profiles produced by the full 3 D injector simulations into the LE 1 runner simulation. This allows the difference in total efficiency between the injectors combined with the runner to be compared to the experimental differences which also includes the impact of the jet on the runner performance. The comparison between the injectors is less accurate as more uncertainties are introduced when combining these models and the differences are smaller however the CFD was able to predict the improvements to within 0. 4 %. Finally, the numerical differences between the runner designs and the experimental differences are compared showing that the runner model is able to predict differences in hydraulic efficiency to within 0. 1 %. This accuracy is largely down to that fact that many of the systematic experimental and modelling errors are cancelled out when comparing only the runners. The CFD model verification has shown that although the absolute performance of the Turgo system can be modelled numerically to within a good degree of accuracy, it requires combining injector and runner models as well as estimating additional losses in the pipework which can prove time consuming. However for design comparison and optimisations the CFD models have been shown to be far more accurate suggesting that this is where these numerical models are most useful...|$|R
