5|$|The invasions {{brought new}} ethnic groups to Europe, {{although}} some regions received a larger influx of new peoples than others. In Gaul for instance, the invaders settled much more {{extensively in the}} north-east than in the south-west. Slavs settled in Central and Eastern Europe and the Balkan Peninsula. The settlement of peoples was accompanied by changes in languages. The Latin of the Western Roman Empire was gradually replaced by languages based on, but distinct <b>from,</b> <b>Latin,</b> collectively known as Romance languages. These changes <b>from</b> <b>Latin</b> to the new languages took many centuries. Greek remained {{the language of the}} Byzantine Empire, but the migrations of the Slavs added Slavic languages to Eastern Europe.|$|E
