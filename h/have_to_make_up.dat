25|$|It is tolled at two locations, {{one point}} north of Navan and another point between Dunshaughlin and Clonee for 45 years running from 2007. The Government {{have the option}} to buy out this {{contract}} at any time. The price level of tolls is controlled by the Board of the NRA and they can reduce, increase or remove the tolls as they see appropriate (as is the case with every other toll road in Ireland e.g. Dublin Port Tunnel weekend price reduction). Should they lower the tolls on the M3 the government would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> the difference of what is owed yearly to Eurolink M3 Ltd through tax revenue. Thus Eurolink are guaranteed a certain agreed return from their investment and would not suffer from any reduction in toll revenue from either a toll reduction or the planned opening of the Navan rail line. The toll revenue is collected by a private company on behalf of the state as a means to pay the private sector consortium annually for their initial one off investment in constructing the road.|$|E
25|$|Proposition Joe hosts {{a meeting}} with the heads of the New Day Co-Op {{consortium}} of drug dealers. He is in an awkward position, having had an entire shipment of narcotics stolen by Omar. He tries to convince his colleagues that they should pay for a replacement shipment while they work on recovering the stolen drugs. The rest of the Co-Op members are dubious and tell Joe that as the drugs were in the possession of his people when they were stolen, he will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> for the loss. Joe threatens to cut them off from his supplier in the future if they insist on this course and this quiets their protests. Marlo Stanfield quizzes Joe about which of his people was there when the shipment was taken. Joe admits that it was his nephew Cheese but tells Marlo that he will protect Cheese from any retribution. He offers to put Marlo in touch with his connection so he can reassure him that Cheese did not steal the drugs for himself.|$|E

500|$|Milk's most {{successful}} opponent was the quiet and thoughtful lawyer Rick Stokes, who {{was backed by}} the Alice B. Toklas Memorial Democratic Club. Stokes had been open about his homosexuality long before Milk had, and had experienced more severe treatment, once hospitalized and forced to endure electroshock therapy to 'cure' him. Milk, however, was more expressive {{about the role of}} gay people and their issues in San Francisco politics. Stokes was quoted saying, [...] "I'm just a businessman who happens to be gay," [...] and expressed the view that any normal person could also be homosexual. Milk's contrasting populist philosophy was relayed to The New York Times: [...] "We don't want sympathetic liberals, we want gays to represent gays... I represent the gay street people—the 14-year-old runaway from San Antonio. We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> for hundreds of years of persecution.

[...] Unlike most other Chinese students, who {{traveled}} to Europe on work-study programs, Zhou's scholarship and position with Yishi bao {{meant that he}} was well provided for {{and did not have}} to do any work during his stay. Because of his financial position, he was able to devote himself full-time to revolutionary activities. In a letter to his cousin on 30 January 1921, Zhou said that his goals in Europe were to survey the social conditions in foreign countries and their methods of resolving social issues, in order to apply such lessons in China after his return. In the same letter, Zhou told his cousin that, regarding his adoption of a specific ideology, [...] "I still <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> my mind." ...|$|E

Ward and June attended prep school and boarding school, respectively, and both attended college; their sons are expected to do the same. While both boys consider prep-school educations – Wally at the Bellport Military Academy and Beaver at an eastern school called Fallbrook – both remain at home and attend Mayfield High with their friends. School and homework are the bane of Beaver's existence. In [...] "Beaver's Secret Life", the boy decides to become a writer in adulthood because [...] "you don't {{have to go to school}} or know nothing ...
