5|$|The Bill {{has earned}} various awards and {{nominations}} during its run, with the nominations in categories ranging from Best Drama to its camera and <b>editing</b> <b>work</b> to the cast's acting performance. It received nominations for eight awards from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, winning Best Video Cameraman in 1990 and Best Continuing Drama in 2009an award {{for which it}} was unsuccessfully nominated in a further three years. In addition, The Bill enjoyed success at the Inside Soap Awards, where it won Best Drama six times, including four consecutive wins, as well as a nomination in 2010—losing to Waterloo Road. Other awards include a Writers' Guild of Great Britain award for Best Soap/Continuing Drama Series in 2008, Best Serial Drama at the Digital Spy Soap Awards of the same year and a nomination for Most Popular Overseas Drama at the 2005 Logie Awards.

5|$|The camera {{work and}} <b>editing</b> <b>work</b> {{together}} to further heighten the frightening {{qualities of the}} film. Eleanor is often viewed from above, and in one scene the camera closes in so tightly on her that she is forced backward over a railing. Eleanor's viewpoint is often juxtaposed with eerie views of the house, as if both viewpoints were the same. Many of the editing choices in the film are also used to heighten the audience's discomfort. There {{are a number of}} rapid cuts in the film that throw off the viewer's sense of spatial orientation, and Dutch angles are used to imply that reality is off-kilter. Cutting on action—showing the characters exiting a room to the right, only to show them entering the next room from the left—is often violated, so that the viewer cannot get a clear sense of which rooms and hallways are connected to one another. The audience also lacks temporal clues. There are few shots in which they can see out a window to determine whether it's night or day. When Eleanor is rescued by Dr. Markway on the unstable spiral staircase, some of the windows nearby show strong sunlight streaming in, while others show darkness outside.|$|E

25|$|At NYU Schoonmaker {{also met}} filmmaker Michael Wadleigh and later edited his {{influential}} music festival documentary, Woodstock on which Scorsese also worked. Her first major film <b>editing</b> <b>work</b> on Woodstock gained Schoonmaker an Academy Award nomination for Best Editing. Her use of superimpositions and freeze frames brought the {{performances in the}} film to life, and added to the movie's wide appeal, thus helping to raise the artistry and visibility of documentary filmmaking to a new level. Among the most haunting of Woodstock’s brilliantly edited sequences are the relatively sedate, nearly painterly, composition of Joan Baez’s mesmerising rendition of “Joe Hill” and her a cappella “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot”, sung before a raptly silent audience of half-a-million and Joe Cocker’s “With a Little Help from My Friends”, featuring the singer’s falsetto response to his own vocal on {{the other half of}} the split screen….Only infrequently does editing inspiration flag, notably on Jimi Hendrix’s very long guitar solo that concludes the “Director’s Cut”….the Hendrix number evidences the flaccidity of material unmediated by the editing magic of Scorsese and Schoonmaker.|$|E

Although approached to join BBC Films some years before, only in 2007 did she feel it was the time to [...] "concentrate more exclusively on film". She immediately began overseeing <b>editing</b> <b>work</b> on The Other Boleyn Girl, which was already in post-production. She also began developing The Damned United, a film based on David Peace's novel that fictionalised the 44 days Brian Clough managed Leeds United F.C. in 1974. The film was adapted by Peter Morgan, executive produced by Andy Harries, and starred Michael Sheen as Clough. On why she continues to work with the same people on her projects, Langan said, [...] "The reason I return to working with the same people is that you have invested time, energy and thought and care into these relationships and that can pay dividends—The Queen is an example of those relationships paying dividends".|$|E

500|$|Three more {{magazines}} began {{publication in}} 1950, all in digest format. [...] The first was Fantasy Fiction, which produced two issues. [...] It included some respectable reprinted material from 1930s issues of Argosy, {{but none of}} the new stories were memorable. [...] In October 1950, Raymond Palmer, who had left Ziff-Davis to become a publisher in his own right, launched Imagination. [...] A serious accident in the summer forced him to turn most of the <b>editing</b> <b>work</b> over to Bea Mahaffey, and after two issues he sold the magazine to William Hamling, who kept it going until 1958. [...] The final magazine of the decade was Worlds Beyond, edited by Damon Knight, which appeared in December 1950, and lasted for three monthly issues; the publisher, Hillman Periodicals, decided to scrap the magazine only days after the first issue went on sale. [...] All three issues featured quality work, and many of the stories have been reprinted frequently; Willam Tenn's [...] "Null-P" [...] and C.M. Kornbluth's [...] "The Mindworm" [...] being perhaps the best-known. [...] Knight included material by non-genre writers such as Graham Greene and Rudyard Kipling, along with genre names such as Katherine MacLean and Lester del Rey. [...] Ashley suggests that had Knight been allowed to continue, the magazine would have been a significant contribution to 1950s science fiction.|$|E
500|$|Late in October 1970, Gygax {{lost his}} job at the {{insurance}} company after almost nine years. Unemployed and now with a family of five children — Ernest ("Ernie"), Lucion ("Luke"), Heidi, Cindy, and Elise—he tried to use his enthusiasm for games to make a living by designing board games for commercial sale. This clearly proved to be unsustainable when he only grossed $882 in 1971.> He began to cobble shoes in his basement, which did provide him with steady income and gave him more time for pursuing his interest in game development. In 1971, he began doing some <b>editing</b> <b>work</b> at Guidon Games, a publisher of wargames, for which he produced the board games Alexander the Great and [...] Early that same year, Gygax published Chainmail, a miniatures wargame that simulated medieval-era tactical combat, which he had originally written with hobby-shop owner Jeff Perren. The Chainmail medieval miniatures rules were originally published in the Castle & Crusade Society's fanzine The Domesday Book. Guidon Games hired Gygax to produce a [...] "Wargaming with Miniatures" [...] series of games, and a new edition of Chainmail (1971) was the first book in the series. The first edition of Chainmail included a fantasy supplement to the rules. These comprised a system for warriors, wizards, and various monsters of non-human races drawn from the works of J. R. R. Tolkien and other sources. For wizards, Gygax included six spells {{that could be used to}} affect a battle, plus two [...] "missiles" [...] (fire ball and lightning bolt). For a small publisher like Guidon Games, Chainmail was relatively successful, selling 100 copies per month.|$|E
2500|$|He {{wrote the}} short story [...] "Ender's Game" [...] while working at the BYU press, and {{submitted}} it to several publications. The idea for the later novel of the same title came from {{the short story}} about a school where boys can fight in space. It was eventually purchased by Ben Bova at Analog Science Fiction and Fact and published in the August 1977 issue. Meanwhile, he started writing half-hour audioplays on LDS Church history, the New Testament, and other subjects for Living Scriptures in Ogden, Utah; {{on the basis of}} that continuing contract, some freelance <b>editing</b> <b>work,</b> and a novel contract for Hot Sleep and A Planet Called Treason, he left Ensign and began supporting his family as a freelancer.|$|E

That is one very important point that The Aristocrats makes." [...] His friend Paul Provenza, who directed the movie, praised Emery's <b>editing</b> <b>work,</b> crediting it with shaping the style and shape of the film.
