40|$|In this study, {{several new}} cutting edges for removal of ice from the roadway {{were tested in}} a series of closed road tests. These new cutting edges {{consisted}} of a variety of serrated shapes. The study also included measurement of ice scraping forces by in-service trucks. These trucks were instrumented in a similar manner as the truck used in the closed-road tests. Results from the closed-road and <b>in-service</b> <b>tests</b> were analyzed by two parameters. The first parameter is the scraping effectiveness, which is defined as the average horizontal force experienced by a cutting edge. The amount of ice scraped from the roadway is directly proportional to the magnitude of the scraping effectiveness. Thus an increase in scraping effectiveness indicates an increase in the amount of ice being scraped from the roadway. The second parameter is force angle, which is defined as tan to the - 1 power [vertical force/horizontal force]. A combination of a minimal force angle and a maximized scraping effectiveness represents a case in which the maximal amount of ice is being removed from the pavement without an exceptionally large vertical force. Results indicate that each cutting edge produced a maximal scraping effectiveness with a testing configuration of a 15 deg blade angle and a 23, 000 lb. download force. Results also indicate that each cutting edge produced a minimal force angle with a testing configuration of a 15 deg blade angle and a 10, 000 lb. download force. Results from the in-service trucks produced similar data and also similar trends within the data when compared to the results of the closed-road tests. This result is most important, as it suggests that the closed-road tests do provide an accurate measure of ice scraping forces for a given blade and configuration of that blade. Thus if the closed-road tests indicate that certain blades perform well, there is now excellent reason to conduct full scale tests of such blades...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{documents}} {{the results of}} recent tests sponsored by the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and performed by the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). These tests address {{the effectiveness of the}} lubricant used on the threaded portion of the valve stem, where the stem nut turns on the stem. Recent testing indicates that an elevated temperature environment can lead to significant increases in the friction coefficient at the stem/stem-nut interface. Most valve actuator qualification tests are performed at room temperature. Similarly, <b>in-service</b> <b>tests</b> are run at ambient plant temperatures, usually 70 to 100 0;F. Since design conditions can lead to valve operating temperatures in the 200 to 300 0;F range, {{it is important to know}} whether a temperature-induced increase in friction at the stem/stem-nut interface will prevent the required operation of critical valves. Lubricant aging is another phenomenon that might have deleterious effects on the thrust output of a valve actuator. Laboratory experience and field experience both indicate that after long periods in elevated temperature environments, the lubricants may lose their lubrication qualities. The scope of the current test program includes testing of five different lubricants on four different valve stems. Pending completion of the testing, results of the tests conducted using two of the four stems are discussed. The test series included collection of baseline data at room temperature, single step temperature tests where the temperature of the test setup was elevated directly to 250 °F, and step testing where the temperature was elevated in steps to 130, 190, and 250 °F, then returned to 70 °F. All greases tested showed evidence of physical change after elevated temperature tests. Except for one particular lubricant, all of the greases tested showed increased coefficients of friction at elevated temperatures. Numerous other preliminary conclusions are presented. Recommendations for future research in the area of aged valve stem lubricant performance at elevated temperatures are also presented...|$|E

40|$|Reliably {{measuring}} the relevant parameters (like channel power, occupied bandwidth, and carrier frequency) characterizing the signals involved in wireless communications systems {{turns out to}} be the key for their <b>in-service</b> <b>testing</b> at a physical layer. This task, however, would not succeed whenever other signals, generated by different wireless systems, interfere with the useful one both in the time and frequency domains. To overcome this limitation, the authors have recently assessed the suitability of eigenvalue decomposition-based algorithms in accurately estimating the power spectrum of a given number of signals that overlap in the time domain and occupy, fully or partially, the same frequency band. Starting from the promising outcomes of the cited algorithms and taking advantage of some nice features of information theoretical criteria, a new measurement method is designed and implemented hereinafter. Designed directly for the <b>in-service</b> physical layer <b>testing</b> of wireless communications systems, the method allows a blind separation of the power spectrum of the useful signal from those of the interfering ones. The evaluation of the desired parameters of the useful signal as well as the frequency-domain characterization of the interfering ones is thus possible, whatever the number of involved signals.

40|$|The {{unavailability}} of standby {{safety system}} components due to failures in {{nuclear power plants}} is considered to involve a time independent and a time dependent part. The former relates to the component`s unavailability from demand stresses due to usage, and the latter represents the component`s unavailability due to standby time stresses related to the environment. In this paper, data from the nuclear plant reliability data system (NPRDS) were used to partition the component`s unavailability into the contributions from standby time stress (i. e., due to environmental factors) and demand stress (i. e., due to usage). Analyses are presented of motor operated valves (MOVs), motor driven pumps (MDPs), and turbine driven pumps (FDPs).

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the problem of <b>in-service</b> <b>testing</b> of complex systems and {{apparatuses}} (in particular, radio frequency ones) for avionic applications. This is a fundamental step when maintenance and/or monitoring of the system or apparatus have to be carried out without stopping its standard operation condition. Traditional approaches usually work by measuring only the signals at the output of the final stage of the system or apparatus and trying to determine the eventual fault source. Unfortunately, they often fail when complex systems or apparatuses, characterized by several multiple and sequential stages, are taken into account; singling out the specific faulty component turns out to be impossible. Moreover, most of the considered approaches require to turn off or out-of-service the system or apparatus under test. To overcome the considered limitations, the authors suggest the insertion of digital radio frequency memories between each couple of successive stages.

40|$|SRAM-based FPGAs are {{increasingly}} relevant {{in a growing}} number of safety-critical application fields, ranging from automotive to aerospace. These application fields are characterized by a harsh radiation environment that can cause the occurrence of Single Event Upsets (SEUs) in digital devices. These faults have particularly adverse effects on SRAM-based FPGA systems because not only can they temporarily affect the behaviour of the system by changing the contents of flip-flops or memories, but they can also permanently change the functionality implemented by the system itself, by changing the content of the configuration memory. Designing safety-critical applications requires accurate methodologies to evaluate the system’s sensitivity to SEUs as early as possible during the design process. Moreover it is necessary to detect the occurrence of SEUs during the system life-time. To this purpose test patterns should be generated during the design process, and then applied to the inputs of the system during its operation. In this thesis we propose a set of software tools that could be used by designers of SRAM-based FPGA safety-critical applications to assess the sensitivity to SEUs of the system and to generate <b>test</b> patterns for <b>in-service</b> <b>testing.</b> The main feature of these tools is that they implement a model of SEUs affecting the configuration bits controlling the logic and routing resources of an FPGA device that has been demonstrated to be much more accurate than the classical stuck-at and open/short models, that are commonly used in the analysis of faults in digital devices. By keeping this accurate fault model into account, the proposed tools are more accurate than similar academic and commercial tools today available for the analysis of faults in digital circuits, that do {{not take into account the}} features of the FPGA technology [...] In particular three tools have been designed and developed: (i) ASSESS: Accurate Simulator of SEuS affecting the configuration memory of SRAM-based FPGAs, a simulator of SEUs affecting the configuration memory of an SRAM-based FPGA system for the early assessment of the sensitivity to SEUs; (ii) UA 2 TPG: Untestability Analyzer and Automatic Test Pattern Generator for SEUs Affecting the Configuration Memory of SRAM-based FPGAs, a static analysis tool for the identification of the untestable SEUs and for the automatic generation of <b>test</b> patterns for <b>in-service</b> <b>testing</b> of the 100 % of the testable SEUs; and (iii) GABES: Genetic Algorithm Based Environment for SEU Testing in SRAM-FPGAs, a Genetic Algorithm-based Environment for the generation of an optimized set of <b>test</b> patterns for <b>in-service</b> <b>testing</b> of SEUs. The proposed tools have been applied to some circuits from the ITC’ 99 benchmark. The results obtained from these experiments have been compared with results obtained by similar experiments in which we considered the stuck-at fault model, instead of the more accurate model for SEUs. From the comparison of these experiments we have been able to verify that the proposed software tools are actually more accurate than similar tools today available. In particular the comparison between results obtained using ASSESS with those obtained by fault injection has shown that the proposed fault simulator has an average error of 0 : 1 % and a maximum error of 0 : 5 %, while using a stuck-at fault simulator the average error with respect of the fault injection experiment has been 15 : 1 % with a maximum error of 56 : 2 %. Similarly the comparison between the results obtained using UA 2 TPG for the accurate SEU model, with the results obtained for stuck-at faults has shown an average difference of untestability of 7 : 9 % with a maximum of 37 : 4 %. Finally the comparison between fault coverages obtained by test patterns generated for the accurate model of SEUs and the fault coverages obtained by test pattern designed for stuck-at faults, shows that the former detect the 100 % of the testable faults, while the latter reach an average fault coverage of 78 : 9 %, with a minimum of 54 % and a maximum of 93 : 16 %...|$|R

This information together with the concentration map will derive the result to the mass flow rate,which will then provide the quantity of flowing volume in process vessels[1, 6].

40|$|On 9 October 2001 two US oil {{companies}} Chevron and Texaco merged. Their long-term joint venture operation, known as Caltex (formed in 1936 and operating in East and Southern Africa, Middle East, Asia and Australasia), {{was incorporated into}} the one global energy company. This global enterprise will be highly competitive across all energy sectors, as the new company brings together a wealth of talents, shared values and {{a strong commitment to}} developing vital energy resources around the globe. Worldwide, ChevronTexaco is the third largest publicly traded company in terms of oil and gas reserves, with some 11. 8 billion barrels of oil and gas equivalent. It is the fourth largest producer, with daily production of 2. 7 million barrels. The company also has 22 refineries and more than 21, 000 branded service stations worldwide. This paper will review the fundamentals of lubrication as they apply to the components of turbines. It will then look at three turbine types, steam, gas and water, to address the different needs of lubricating oils and the appropriate specifications for each. The significance of oil testing both for product development and in-service oil monitoring will be reviewed, together with the supporting field experience of ChevronTexaco. The environmental emissions controls on turbines and any impact on the lubricants will be discussed. Finally, the trends in specifications for lubricating oils to address the modern turbines designs will be reviewed.

40|$|For {{the past}} several years, {{researchers}} at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, under the sponsorship of the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, have been investigating the ability of motor-operated valves to close or open when subjected to design basis flow and pressure loads. Part of this research addresses the friction that occurs at the interface between the valve disc and the valve body seats during operation of a gate valve. In most gate valves, these surfaces are hardfaced with Stellite 6, a cobalt-based alloy. The nuclear industry has developed methods to analytically predict the thrust needed to operate these valves at specific pressure conditions. To produce accurate valve thrust predictions; the analyst must have a reasonably accurate, though conservative, estimate of the coefficient of friction at the disc-to-seat interface. One {{of the questions that}} remains to be answered is whether, and to what extent, aging of the disc and seat surfaces affects the disc-to-seat coefficient of friction. Specifically, does the accumulation of a surface film due to aging of these surfaces increase the coefficient of friction and if so, how much? This paper presents results of specimen tests addressing this issue with emphasis on the following: • The change in the friction coefficient of Stellite 6 as it ages and whether the friction reaches a plateau. • The effect periodic gate valve cycling due to <b>in-service</b> <b>testing</b> has on the friction coefficient. • The results of an independent review of the test methods, processes, and the results of the research to date. • The status of ongoing aging and friction testing...|$|R
