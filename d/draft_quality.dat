40|$|In {{undergraduate}} {{natural science}} courses, {{two types of}} evaluators are commonly used to assess student writing: graduate-student teaching assistants (TAs) or peers. The current study examines how well these approaches to evaluation support student writing. These {{differences between the two}} possible evaluators are likely to affect multiple aspects of the writing process: first <b>draft</b> <b>quality,</b> amount and types of feedback provided, amount and types of revisions, and final <b>draft</b> <b>quality.</b> Therefore, we examined how these aspects of the writing process were affected when undergraduate students wrote papers to be evaluated by a group of peers versus their TA. Several interesting results were found. First, the quality of the students' first draft was greater when they were writing for their peers than when writing for their TA. In terms of feedback, students provided longer comments, and they also focused more on the prose than the TAs. Finally, more revisions were made if the students received feedback from their peers-especially prose revisions. Despite all of the benefits seen with peers as evaluators, there was only a moderate difference in final <b>draft</b> <b>quality.</b> This result indicates that while peer-review is helpful, there continues to be a need for research regarding how to enhance the benefits...|$|E

Single-cell genomic approaches are typically applied to anonymous microbial cells with only morphology providing clues to their identity.

A de novo assembled, well annotated, reference sequence {{for the water}} buffalo is an important prerequisite for studying the biology of this species, and necessary to manage genetic diversity and to use modern breeding and genomic selection techniques. However, no such genome assembly has been previously reported. There are two species of domestic water buffalo, the river (2 n = 50) and the swamp (2 n = 48) buffalo.

40|$|The draft Fugu rubripes genome was {{released}} in 2002, at which time relatively few cDNAs were available {{to aid in the}} annotation of genes. The data presented here describe the sequencing and analysis of 24, 398 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) generated from 15 different adult and juvenile Fugu tissues, 74 % of which matched protein database entries. Analysis of the EST data compared with the Fugu genome data predicts that approximately 10, 116 gene tags have been generated, covering almost one-third of Fugu predicted genes. This represents a remarkable economy of effort. Comparison with the Washington University zebrafish EST assemblies indicates strong conservation within fish species, but significant differences remain. This potentially represents divergence of sequence in the 5 � terminal exons and UTRs between these two fish species, although clearly, complete EST data sets are not available for either species. This project provides new Fugu resources, and the analysis adds significant weight to the argument that EST programs remain an essential resource for genome exploitation and annotation. This is particularly timely with the increasing availability of draft genome sequence from different organisms and the mounting emphasis on gene function and regulation.

40|$|This article {{highlights}} how {{the complexity}} of EU secondary law (other than self- executing acts) can cause real difficulties at the stage of its transposition at national level. Two practical examples, involving {{the intervention of the}} Commission, illustrate the problem. It is assumed, on the one hand, that the general principles of law (legal certainty, legitimate expectations and transparency) require the EU legislator to ensure intelligibility and <b>drafting</b> <b>quality,</b> {{and on the other hand}} that these features are of the essence not only for citizens and for business, but also to enable the national authorities to adopt domestic implementing measures in an effective and timely manner. In that perspective, the article outlines some tentative methodological suggestions, while addressing, in the light of the ECJ case-law, the methods of interpreting EU law, the role of recitals, the Commission’s use of soft-law instruments to guide national implementing measures, as well as the proactive attitude from Member States within and outside the Council. A practical suggestion is made to establish a close connection at national level between the personnel taking part in the drafting of an EU legal act (upstream phase, i. e. those people contributing to the draft of legislation at the Council level) and the personnel engaged in the process of implementing that act at the domestic level (downstream phase). Linking the two phases so as to rely on the same national staff for advising on both appears to be a quite simple scheme to ensure better understanding of the EU legal texts and to sound a warning wherever there is a risk of an infringement due to inadequate implementation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Epulopiscium sp. type B, a large {{intestinal}} bacterial symbiont of the surgeonfish Naso tonganus, {{does not}} reproduce by binary fission. Instead, it forms multiple intracellular offspring using a process with morphological features {{similar to the}} survival strategy of endospore formation in other Firmicutes. We hypothesize that intracellular offspring formation in Epulopiscium evolved from endospore formation and these two developmental programs share molecular mechanisms {{that are responsible for}} the observed morphological similarities. Results To test this, we sequenced the genome of Epulopiscium sp. type B to <b>draft</b> <b>quality.</b> Comparative analysis with the complete genome of its close, endospore-forming relative, Cellulosilyticum lentocellum, identified homologs of well-known sporulation genes characterized in Bacillus subtilis. Of the 147 highly conserved B. subtilis sporulation genes used in this analysis, we found 57 homologs in the Epulopiscium genome and 87 homologs in the C. lentocellum genome. Conclusions Genes coding for components of the central regulatory network which govern the expression of forespore and mother-cell-specific sporulation genes and the machinery used for engulfment appear best conserved. Low conservation of genes expressed late in endospore formation, particularly those that confer resistance properties and encode germinant receptors, suggest that Epulopiscium has lost the ability to form a mature spore. Our findings provide a framework for understanding the evolution of a novel form of cellular reproduction. </p...|$|E
40|$|To better {{understand}} {{the ways in which}} peer feedback can vary across contexts to shape learning outcomes, the current dissertation examined how student ability levels shapes peer review. Peer review involves opportunities to learn from receiving feedback and providing feedback. Both elements were considered within one larger experiment.

As part of the requirements for class, students wrote a first draft of their paper, reviewed four peers' papers, revised their draft based on peer feedback, and wrote a new paper on a different topic.

40|$|Abstract Background Escherichia coli {{exists in}} {{commensal}} and pathogenic forms. By measuring the variation of individual genes across {{more than a}} hundred sequenced genomes, gene variation can be studied in detail, including the number of mutations found for any given gene. This knowledge will be useful for creating better phylogenies, for determination of molecular clocks and for improved typing techniques. Results We find 3, 051 gene clusters/families present in at least 95 % of the genomes and 1, 702 gene clusters present in 100 % of the genomes. The former 'soft core' of about 3, 000 gene families is perhaps more biologically relevant, especially considering that many of these genome sequences are <b>draft</b> <b>quality.</b> The E. coli pan-genome for this set of isolates contains 16, 373 gene clusters. A core-gene tree, based on alignment and a pan-genome tree based on gene presence/absence, maps the relatedness of the 186 sequenced E. coli genomes. The core-gene tree displays high confidence and divides the E. coli strains into the observed MLST type clades and also separates defined phylotypes. Conclusion The results of comparing a large and diverse E. coli dataset support the theory that reliable and good resolution phylogenies can be inferred from the core-genome. The results further suggest that the resolution at the isolate level may, subsequently be improved by targeting more variable genes. The use of whole genome sequencing will make it possible to eliminate, or at least reduce, the need for several typing steps used in traditional epidemiology. </p...|$|E
