25|$|A 2013 review {{examined}} {{studies from}} five continents and {{the correlation between}} a country's level of gender inequality and rates of domestic violence. The authors found that if one examines who is physically harmed and <b>how</b> <b>seriously,</b> expresses more fear, experience subsequent psychological problems, domestic violence is significantly gendered toward women as victims. Many organizations have made efforts to use gender-neutral terms when referring to perpetration and victimization. For example, using broader terms like family violence rather than violence against women.|$|E

25|$|The error {{would not}} have {{rendered}} his work worthless – each part of Wiles's work was highly significant and innovative by itself, as were the many developments and techniques he had created {{in the course of}} his work, and only one part was affected. However without this part proved, there was no actual proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. Wiles spent almost a year trying to repair his proof, initially by himself and then in collaboration with his former student Richard Taylor, without success. By the end of 1993, rumours had spread that under scrutiny, Wiles's proof had failed, but <b>how</b> <b>seriously</b> was not known. Mathematicians were beginning to pressure Wiles to disclose his work whether or not complete, so that the wider community could explore and use whatever he had managed to accomplish. But instead of being fixed, the problem, which had originally seemed minor, now seemed very significant, far more serious, and less easy to resolve.|$|E

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1824, Mary Shelley moved to Kentish Town in north London to be near Jane Williams. She may have been, {{in the words of}} her biographer Muriel Spark, [...] "a little in love" [...] with Jane.

At around this time, Mary Shelley was working on her novel, The Last Man (1826); and she assisted a series of friends who were writing memoirs of Byron and Percy Shelley—the beginnings of her attempts to immortalise her husband. She also met the American actor John Howard Payne and the American writer Washington Irving, who intrigued her. Payne {{fell in love with her}} and in 1826 asked her to marry him. She refused, saying that after being married to one genius, she could only marry another. Payne accepted the rejection and tried without success to talk his friend Irving into proposing himself. Mary Shelley was aware of Payne's plan, but <b>how</b> <b>seriously</b> she took it is unclear.|$|E
500|$|The Other Hand {{presents}} {{a critique of}} the British asylum system and attitude towards asylum-seekers. Cleave feels there exists a [...] "general lethargy" [...] about the way asylum-seekers are treated in Britain, and though he believes he is not a political writer, the book begins with an extract from a 2005 UK Home Office publication entitled [...] "United Kingdom: A Journey to Citizenship". The extract reads: [...] "Britain is proud of its tradition of providing a safe haven for people fleeting (sic) persecution and conflict." [...] Cleave questioned: [...] "If a government can't even successfully proof-read such a fundamental document, <b>how</b> <b>seriously</b> can we take its asylum procedure?" [...] In writing The Other Hand, Cleave hoped to [...] "humanise" [...] the issue for readers. Despite discussions of political violence and British Colonialism within the novel, Sarah L. Courteau, editor of the Wilson Quarterly commented: [...] "You're almost entirely unaware of its politics because the book doesn't deal in abstractions but in human beings." [...] For this reason, she deemed The Other Hand [...] "the best kind of political novel". Emma Philip of The Courier-Mail has opined that while The Other Hand does make political points, readers should not confuse it with a political book, as the [...] "overwhelming beauty" [...] of the relationship between Sarah, Little Bee and Charlie [...] "far outweighs the political message." ...|$|E

Martindale mentions a concept where the fruits of a phenomenon {{are more important than}} its historical origins. Therefore, it is possible to conceive of a vibrant cultus where the strength of the devotion, shrine, or pilgrimage, can outweigh uncertainties regarding its origin. According to Maunder, Fatima demonstrates not only <b>how</b> <b>seriously</b> Catholics took [...] "the revelations of an enclosed nun remembering visions she had experienced at the age of ten, but also show how difficult it is for the hierarchy to manage a movement of popular piety, despite critics claims of manipulation. Following Fatima, there would be proliferation of apocalyptic manifestations, such as at Necedah.|$|E
