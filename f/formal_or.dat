5|$|Alliteration is the {{repetition}} of letters or letter-sounds {{at the beginning of}} two or more words immediately succeeding each other, or at short intervals; or the recurrence of the same letter in accented parts of words. Alliteration and assonance {{played a key role in}} structuring early Germanic, Norse and Old English forms of poetry.

This can be compared to an ornamental use of alliteration in most Modern European poetry, where alliterative patterns are not <b>formal</b> <b>or</b> carried through full stanzas. Alliteration is particularly useful in languages with less rich rhyming structures.|$|E
