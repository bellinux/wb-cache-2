500|$|The elder Lajoie, {{who worked}} as a {{teamster}} and laborer, died not long into the younger Lajoie's childhood, which forced him and his siblings to work to support the family. Lajoie dropped out of school to work in a textile mill. He also began playing semi-professional baseball for the local Woonsocket team under the alias [...] "Sandy", because his parents did not approve of their son playing baseball. He earned money as a taxi driver with a horse and buggy and locally was called [...] "Slugging Cabby." [...] "When I told my father <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>decided</b> to take the job he was very angry. He shouted that ball players were bums and that nobody respected them, but I was determined {{to give it a try}} at least one season", Lajoie later said. He also received the nickname [...] "Larry" [...] from a teammate who had trouble pronouncing Lajoie. Lajoie admired baseball players such as King Kelly and Charles Radbourn.|$|E
2500|$|In 1987 Powell joined {{other music}} greats for a jazz festival on the cruise ship SS Norway, playing {{alongside}} Benny Carter, Howard Alden, Milt Hinton, and Louie Bellson and others. One performance {{has been documented}} on the CD The Return of Mel Powell (Chiaroscuro Records). The recording includes 20 minutes of Powell discussing {{his life and his}} reasons for leaving jazz. In an interview with The New Yorker magazine jazz critic Whitney Balliett, Powell said: [...] "I have decided that when I retire I will think through my decision to leave jazz – with the help of Freud and Jung. At the moment, I suspect it was this: I had done what I felt I had to do in jazz. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>decided</b> it did not hold the deepest interest for me musically. And <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>decided</b> that it was a young man's music, even a black music. Also, the endless repetition of material in the Goodman band – playing the same tunes day after day and night after night – got to me. That repetition tended to kill spontaneity, which is the heart of jazz and which can give a lifetime's nourishment." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tendulkar's {{allegations}} {{were supported by}} former teammates such as Zaheer Khan, Harbhajan Singh and V. V. S. Laxman. Zaheer called Chappell a [...] "control freak" [...] and said, [...] "After he was appointed {{the coach of the}} Indian team, he once came upto me and told [...] "Zaheer, you will not be playing for India till I remain the coach". He also added that the two-year term under Chappell was [...] "easily the worst and darkest phase" [...] that he could remember. Harbhajan said, [...] "Chappell destroyed Indian cricket {{to such an extent that}} it required at least 3 years to again get back on track. The worst part was some players in that team, who sucked upto the coach and would supply selective misinformation creating bigger rifts". He also talked about the email leak, [...] "Sourav was batting out there in the middle and this man was typing a critical e-mail against Sourav, sitting right there in that dressing room. He had no interest in the proceedings of the match. There were seven guys that he wanted to get rid of. Sourav was his primary target followed by myself, Virender Sehwag, Ashish Nehra, Zaheer Khan and Yuvraj Singh". Laxman was also critical of Chappell in saying that Chappell took Indian cricket [...] "backwards" [...] during his coaching tenure. Laxman also recalled an incident from 2006, [...] "This happened in 2006 at the Wankhede Stadium when India played versus England. Yuvraj Singh was picked ahead of me. We were going to the West Indies for a four-Test series after that and he asked me if I would open. I mentioned in 2000 <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>decided</b> I would not open anymore after it didn't work for me in the first four years. I was consistent in the middle order since 2000. Chappell asked me my age and said - Don't you think 31 is too young an age to sit at home? I was astonished to hear this. I had a very good run under him. I was the second highest run scorer under him." ...|$|E
