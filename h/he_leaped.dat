25|$|Then, {{high on a}} crag jutting {{over the}} river just above the cataract, she saw him! Her lost lover had not forgotten. Even above {{the roar of the}} water she heard him call her name. She stood in the canoe, waved her arms and screamed for help. Though he knew his chances of saving his beloved were slim at best, the young Englishman did not {{hesitate}} for a moment. <b>He</b> <b>leaped</b> from the overhanging bluff and plunged into the whitened water, just as Lillinonah's canoe struck a rock {{in the middle of the}} river and capsized, spilling her into the frothy current. Swiftly as he could, he swam to her side and clasped her body to him. Alas, neither realized that it was already too late. Still wrapped in loving embrace, the doomed pair disappeared into the boiling falls and were crushed to death as they were hurled to the rocks in the broad pool below.|$|E
25|$|Cpl. Gilliland, {{a member}} of Company I, {{distinguished}} himself by conspicuous gallantry and outstanding courage {{above and beyond the}} call of duty in action against the enemy. A numerically superior hostile force launched a coordinated assault against his company perimeter, the brunt of which was directed up a defile covered by his automatic rifle. His assistant was killed by enemy fire but Cpl. Gilliland, facing the full force of the assault, poured a steady fire into the foe which stemmed the onslaught. When 2 enemy soldiers escaped his raking fire and infiltrated the sector, <b>he</b> <b>leaped</b> from his foxhole, overtook and killed them both with his pistol. Sustaining a serious head wound in this daring exploit, he refused medical attention and returned to his emplacement to continue his defense of the vital defile. His unit was ordered back to new defensive positions but Cpl. Gilliland volunteered to remain to cover the withdrawal and hold the enemy at bay. His heroic actions and indomitable devotion to duty prevented the enemy from completely overrunning his company positions. Cpl. Gilliland's incredible valor and supreme sacrifice reflect lasting glory upon himself and are in keeping with the honored traditions of the military service.|$|E
25|$|On 8 June 1944, the 3rd Battalion of the 116th Infantry was {{advancing}} on the strongly held German defenses at Grandcamp-Maisy, France, {{when the}} leading elements were suddenly halted by decimating machine gun fire from a firmly entrenched enemy {{force on the}} high ground overlooking the town. After numerous attempts to neutralize the enemy position by supporting artillery and tank fire had proved ineffective, T/Sgt. Peregory, on his own initiative, advanced up the hill under withering fire, and worked {{his way to the}} crest where he discovered an entrenchment leading to the main enemy fortifications 200 yards away. Without hesitating, <b>he</b> <b>leaped</b> into the trench and moved toward the emplacement. Encountering a squad of enemy riflemen, he fearlessly attacked them with hand grenades and bayonet, killed 8 and forced 3 to surrender. Continuing along the trench, he single-handedly forced the surrender of 32 more riflemen, captured the machine gunners, and opened the way for the leading elements of the battalion to advance and secure its objective. The extraordinary gallantry and aggressiveness displayed by T/Sgt. Peregory are exemplary of the highest tradition of the armed forces.|$|E

500|$|The Rams {{baseball}} {{program is}} among the oldest {{in the nation and}} was the first college baseball team to play the game according to modern rules. The program has launched the careers of 57 Major League Baseball players, including National Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Frankie Frisch (also known as the [...] "Fordham Flash"). In April 2010, a Fordham baserunner made national headlines when <b>he</b> <b>leaped</b> over an opposing team's catcher to score a run during a game. The incident was dubbed the [...] "Fordham Flip." [...] The Rams baseball team holds the record for most NCAA Division I baseball victories in history.|$|E
2500|$|After the battle, {{with many}} {{wounded in the}} retreat, McClary {{immediately}} procured a horse and rode five miles north to Medford and returned with bandages and other supplies for the wounded. He then prepared to go back across Charlestown Neck to observe any further British movement at Bunker Hill. He was cautioned by his son and other men not to embark on such a risky effort, but McClary exclaimed, [...] "The ball is not yet cast that will kill me!". Upon returning while crossing the Neck to rejoin his men, a shot from a frigate passed through his body. [...] <b>He</b> <b>leaped</b> {{a few feet from}} the ground, keeled over and fell dead on his face. Later McClary would be carried to Medford, and interred with military honors.|$|E
2500|$|Jess Neely, a {{brilliant}} half-back and {{a handsome man}} on the campus, is remembered for his popularity {{among members of the}} opposite sex and for an incident that occurred just prior to a football game with Southern Presbyterian in Clarksville. Miles had done an exceptionally good job in mentally preparing his team for the game. He climaxed the pre-game, locker-room exhortation with a soaring call for courage and deathless allegiance to [...] "dear Ol' Normal." [...] Neely was greatly affected by the words of his coach for <b>he</b> <b>leaped</b> to his feet and, roaring like an angry bull, led the team in a rush to the doorway opening to the field. He misjudged the extremely low entrance, and his head received the full impact of the strip of wall above the doorway. He was revived shortly before the kickoff, but he never quite knew where he was, frequently huddling and aligning himself with the enemy.|$|E

2500|$|Promptly upon {{joining the}} Bisons, Smith {{impressed}} observers with his defensive play. [...] In April 1940, during a Florida exhibition {{game against the}} Detroit Tigers, Smith made a catch that Buffalo sports writer Cy Kritzer later called the greatest catch he had ever seen, including [...] "The Catch" [...] made by Willie Mays in 1954. [...] With the bases loaded in the ninth inning, Hank Greenberg hit the ball better than 475 feet into dead center. [...] According to Kritzer, [...] "Smith turned his back to home plate and dashed straight for the fence. [...] No one gave {{him a chance to}} catch the ball. But in the last stride, <b>he</b> <b>leaped</b> and the ball stuck in the web." [...] Bucky Harris, who managed Smith in Buffalo, later said, [...] "My idea of a perfect game would be to have the opposition hit 27 balls into center field [...] [...] [...] with Mayo Smith out there." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{his unit}} {{advanced}} on the German defenses, the leading elements of his unit began receiving fire from German forces. The Germans were firmly entrenched on high ground overlooking {{the town and}} were able to inflict severe damage to allied forces as they approached. Numerous attempts to neutralize the enemy position by supporting artillery and tank fire had proved ineffective until Technical Sergeant Peregory risked his own life by advancing up the hill under heavy enemy fire. He worked his way to {{the crest of the hill}} where he discovered an entrenchment leading to the main enemy fortifications 200 yards away. Without hesitating, <b>he</b> <b>leaped</b> into the trench and moved toward the emplacement. When he encountered a squad of enemy riflemen, he attacked them with hand grenades and his bayonet, killed 8 and forced 3 to surrender. He then continued along the trench, forcing more than 32 German soldiers to surrender, including the machine gunners. This action opened the way for the leading elements of the battalion allowing them to advance and secure its objective. For his actions Peregory was recommended and approved for the Medal of Honor.

2500|$|... "To these {{accounts}} may be added that of Nicolaus Damascenus. This writer states that at Antioch, near Daphne, {{he met with}} ambassadors from the Indians, who were sent to Augustus Caesar. It appeared from the letter that several persons were mentioned in it, but three only survived, whom he says he saw. The rest had died chiefly in consequence {{of the length of}} the journey. The letter was written in Greek upon a skin; the import of it was, that Porus was the writer, that although he was sovereign of six hundred kings, yet that he highly esteemed the friendship of Cæsar; {{that he was willing to}} allow him a passage through his country, in whatever part he pleased, and to assist him in any undertaking that was just. Eight naked servants, with girdles round their waists, and fragrant with perfumes, presented the gifts which were brought. The presents were a Hermes (i. e. a man) born without arms, whom I have seen, large snakes, a serpent ten cubits in length, a river tortoise of three cubits in length, and a partridge larger than a vulture. They were accompanied by the person, it is said, who burnt himself to death at Athens. This is the practice with persons in distress, who seek escape from existing calamities, and with others in prosperous circumstances, as was the case with this man. For as everything hitherto had succeeded with him, he thought it necessary to depart, lest some unexpected calamity should happen to him by continuing to live; with a smile, therefore, naked, anointed, and with the girdle round his waist, <b>he</b> <b>leaped</b> upon the pyre. On his tomb was this inscription: ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1962, Mantle batted [...]321 in 123 games. He was {{selected}} an All-Star for the eleventh consecutive season and {{played in the}} first game, but due to a former injury acting up, he didn't play in the second All-Star game. In 1963, he batted [...]314 in 65 games. On June 5, he tried to prevent a home run by Brooks Robinson in Baltimore and got his shoe spikes caught in the center field chain link fence as <b>he</b> <b>leaped</b> against the fence for the ball and was coming down. He broke his foot and didn't return playing again until August 4 when he hit a pinch-hit home run against the Baltimore Orioles in Yankee Stadium. He returned to the center field position on September 2. On June 29, he had been selected an All-Star as a starting center fielder, {{but for the first}} time, he didn't make the 25-player team due to the foot injury. In 1964, Mantle hit [...]303 with 35 home runs and 111 RBIs, and played center field in the All-Star game. In {{the bottom of the ninth}} inning of Game 3 of the 1964 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, Mantle blasted Barney Schultz's first pitch into the right field stands at Yankee Stadium, which won the game for the Yankees 2–1. The homer, his 16th World Series round tripper, broke the World Series record of 15 set by Babe Ruth. He hit two more homers in the series to set the existing World Series record of 18 home runs. The Cardinals ultimately won the World Series in 7 games.|$|E
