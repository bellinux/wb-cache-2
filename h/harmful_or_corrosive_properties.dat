40|$|Reciprocating pumps with {{self-acting}} valves {{are commonly}} used for fluids with poor lubrication properties, high contamination levels <b>or</b> <b>corrosive</b> <b>properties.</b> A study {{has been made of}} the dynamic performance of these pumps, with particular regard to the self-acting valve characteristics. Using computer simulation, the effects of changes in the spring forces on the self-acting valves were investigated for a commercially available pump. The simulations predicted that modifications to spring forces could result in considerable improvements in performance, with increased volumetric efficiency and reduced valve impact velocity and flow ripple. These improvements were borne out experimentally. Vibration and air-borne noise were also greatly reduced. Results are presented of the measured and simulated valve motion and velocity, flow ripple and overall volumetric efficiency. Measured vibration and sound power level results are also presented and discussed. Correlation between measured and simulated results is shown to be goo...|$|R

40|$|As long {{duration}} manned {{missions are}} {{considered in the}} near future a lot of experiments on life support systems and space environment will be necessary. On the other hand experimenting in manned missions and traditionally large satellites have become virtually impossible due to capacity of existing systems (no more space shuttle flights, ISS experiments too expensive and scarce). This calls for a new approach. Pico and small satellites could fill the gap for doing necessary experiments on life support systems. Research on the physiological and metabolic properties of in zero gravity has its application in the field of prolonged manned space missions. Bacteria can be used for waste recycling and resource recuperation, but can also be hazardous when travelling along in confined spaces, such as the ISS <b>or</b> because of <b>corrosive</b> <b>properties.</b> To investigate the change of conduct due to microgravity and cosmic radiation a lot of tests should be done with a lot of different types of biological loads. This is often not possible to do in the ISS, because waiting lines are long and getting tests on a mission is difficult. Pico-satellites (CubeSats) can be a solution to do more frequent and cost-effective research, if tests can be automated, controlled and monitored from earth. Defining a proper biochemical experiment, is a challenge, as for now recovery of reaction products is not feasible. As the possibilities to use CubeSats in research projects increase, due to ample initiatives to provide easy access and multi-orbiting of pico-satellites, research and educational institutes can take an important role in vital biological research and in spread of this innovative know-how. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{dissertation}} is the synthesis and characterization of sulfonic or, respectively sulfonic and carbonic acid functionalized polysiloxanes for dental self -etching adhesives. The primary aim of dental adhesives {{is to provide a}} strong and long term stable adhesion to both the composite filling and the dental hard tissue. In addition to withstand mechanical forces a good adhesive should be able to prevent microleakage along the margins, possess a low toxicity and should be easy to use. Conventional dental adhesives based on organic monomer systems are not able to fulfill the requirements sufficiently. Currently used self - etching adhesives contain mostly phosphoric and phosphonic acid functionalized monomers, whose main problem is an insufficient <b>corrosive</b> <b>property</b> on dentin.
