They were spurred by the historical resentment shared by members of the former kingdoms of Abomey, Porto Novo, and disorganised tribes from the north. Its result was the creation of three de facto tribal zones: the north, southeast, and southwest. This regionalism permeated into the armed forces, compounded by divisions of officers into cliques based on education. Hachème was a member of what <b>Decalo</b> called the Abomey clique, which also included prominent officers Philippe Aho, Benoit Sinzogan, and Benoit Adandejan.|$|E
500|$|Ten {{years before}} the story told in Voices the city, which has no military, was {{attacked}} by a desert people known as the Alds, who broke into the city looting and raping before being expelled. After a year-long siege, the Alds conquered the city. Memer Galva, the protagonist of the story, is a [...] "siege brat", a child born during the siege to a mother raped by an Ald soldier. Memer's mother <b>Decalo</b> was head housekeeper to the [...] "Waylord" [...] of Ansul, who arranges trade between Ansul and its neighbors; his house of Galvamand is the oldest in the city, and is among the largest and wealthiest as well. <b>Decalo</b> died soon after giving birth to Memer. The Waylord, Sulter Galva, was imprisoned and tortured, and was crippled when released. Under the Alds the city has become greatly impoverished {{and many of its}} residents are enslaved.|$|E

5000|$|Benoît Sinzogan (born July 14, 1930) is a Beninese {{military}} officer and politician, {{best known for}} leading his country's gendarmerie in the late 1960s. He {{was a member of}} the Fon ethnic group, which dominated the Beninese (then known as Dahomeyan) army from 1965 to 1967. After Maurice Kouandété usurped the presidency on December 17, Sinzogan was placed under house arrest until December 19. That day, Sinzogan was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs, his first political post, which he held until July 1968.

50|$|Dacko's {{government}} faced {{a number}} of problems during 1964 and 1965: the economy experienced stagnation, the bureaucracy started to fall apart, and the country's boundaries were constantly breached by Lumumbists from the south and the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army from the east. Under pressure from radicals in MESAN and in an attempt to cultivate alternative sources of support and display his independence in foreign policy, Dacko established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China (PRC) in September 1964. A delegation led by Meng Yieng and agents of the Chinese government toured the country, showing Communist propaganda films. Soon after, the PRC gave the CAR an interest-free loan of one billion CFA francs (20 million French francs); however, the aid failed to prevent the prospect of a financial collapse for the country. Another problem which plagued the government was widespread corruption. Bokassa felt that he needed to take over the CAR government to remove the influence of Communism and solve all the country's problems. According to Samuel <b>Decalo,</b> a scholar on African government, Bokassa's personal ambitions most likely played the most important role in his decision to launch a coup against the government.|$|E
