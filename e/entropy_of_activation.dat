It determines the preexponential factor A of the Arrhenius equation for temperature dependence of reaction rates. The relationship depends on the molecularity of the reaction: for reactions in solution and unimolecular gas reactions A = (ekBT/h) exp(ΔS‡/R), while for bimolecular gas reactions A = (e2kBT/h) (R'T/p) exp(ΔS‡/R). In these equations e is the base of natural logarithms, h is the Planck constant, kB is the Boltzmann constant and T the absolute temperature.

50|$|In {{the first}} {{quantitative}} measurement of kinetic parameters for this reaction, a 1976 study by Isaacs and Laila measured {{the rates of}} addition of sulfur dioxide to butadiene derivatives. Rates of addition were monitored in benzene at 30 °C with an initial twentyfold excess of sulfur dioxide, allowing for a pseudo first-order approximation. The disappearance of SO2 was followed spectrophotometrically at 320 nm. The reaction showed pseudo first-order kinetics. Some interesting results were that electron-withdrawing groups on the diene decreased the rate of reaction. Also, the reaction rate was affected considerably by steric effects of 2-substituents, with more bulky groups increasing the rate of reaction. The authors attribute this to the tendency of bulky groups to favor the cisoid conformation of the diene which {{is essential to the}} reaction (see table below). In addition, the rates at four temperatures were measured for seven of the dienes permitting calculations of the enthalpy of activation (ΔH‡) and <b>entropy</b> <b>of</b> <b>activation</b> (ΔS‡) for these reactions through the Arrhenius equation.|$|E
50|$|Under basic conditions, the {{reaction}} is initiated by deprotonation of the hydroxyl group. Substrates must lack α-hydrogens to prevent competitive reactions involving enolates. Under Brønsted- or Lewis-acidic conditions, coordination to the carbonyl oxygen occurs first, and under thermal conditions, intramolecular proton transfer {{takes place at the}} same time as migration. The reversibility of {{the reaction}} implies that reaction products are more thermodynamically stable than the corresponding starting materials. Starting materials incorporating ring strain, for instance, will rearrange to products lacking strain.(2)When metal salts are used to promote rearrangement, stereoelectronic effects derived from chelation to the metal salt can enhance the speed and selectivity of the reaction. In the conversion of 1 to 2, for instance, coordination of both the hydroxyl and carbonyl groups to aluminum facilitates rapid, selective migration of the bond to the one-carbon bridge. Similar stereoelectronic effects were observed in studies of the rearrangement of 17-hydroxy-20-ketosteroids. In this case, Lewis-acidic conditions switched the sense of stereoselectivity observed for the base-catalyzed process.(3)α-Hydroxy imines may also undergo rearrangement to amino ketones. Hammett analysis and a very negative <b>entropy</b> <b>of</b> <b>activation</b> suggest that the reaction proceeds in a single step through a concerted transition state. As a result, subtle conformational and steric factors can play a role in the speed and extent of these reactions. Allylic transposition has been observed in migrations of allyl groups, but propargyl groups undergo simple alkyl migration.|$|E

50|$|The {{mechanism}} of the Wolff-Kishner reduction has been studied by Szmant and coworkers. According to Szmant's research, {{the first step in}} this reaction is the formation of a hydrazone anion 1 by deprotonation of the terminal nitrogen by MOH. If semicarbazones are used as substrates, initial conversion into the corresponding hydrazone is followed by deprotonation. A range of mechanistic data suggests that the rate-determining step involves formation of a new carbon-hydrogen bond at the carbon terminal in the delocalized hydrazone anion. This proton capture takes place in a concerted fashion with a solvent-induced abstraction of the second proton at the nitrogen terminal. Szmant’s finding that this reaction is first order in both hydroxide ion and ketone hydrazone supports this mechanistic proposal. Several molecules of solvent have to be involved in this process in order to allow for a concerted process. A detailed Hammett analysis of aryl aldehydes, methyl aryl ketones and diaryl ketones showed a non-linear relationship which the authors attribute to the complexity of the rate-determining step. Mildy electron-withdrawing substituents favor carbon-hydrogen bond formation, but highly electron-withdrawing substitutents will decrease the negative charge at the terminal nitrogen and in turn favor a bigger and harder solvation shell that will render breaking of the N-H bond more difficult. The exceptionally high negative <b>entropy</b> <b>of</b> <b>activation</b> values observed {{can be explained by the}} high degree of organization in the proposed transition state.|$|E

Additionally, the interactions help hold the substrate in a reactive conformation, and the enzyme-catalyzed reaction has near-zero <b>entropy</b> <b>of</b> <b>activation,</b> while typical Claisen rearrangements in solution have very negative entropies of activation.The use of cation-pi interactions has also been successfully implemented in reactions with synthetic catalysts. A combination of anion-binding and cation-pi strategies can be used to effect enantioselective cationic polycyclizations. In the transition state, it is proposed that the thiourea group binds chloride, while the aromatic system stabilizes the associated polyene cation. In support of this, increasing the size of the aromatic ring leads to improvements both in yield and stereoselectivity. The enantioselectivity correlates well with both the polarizability and the quadrupole moment of the aryl group.Since such a large number of catalysts and reactions involve binding to electrophiles to stabilize the transition state, many bifunctional catalysts also present a Lewis-basic, hydrogen bond acceptor site. As a representative example, Deng and coworkers have developed a thiourea-amine catalyst capable of promoting stereoselective Michael reactions. In the proposed transition state, one of the thiourea N-H donors is coordinated to the Michael acceptor and will stabilize the negative charge buildup. The basic nitrogen lone pair acts as a hydrogen bond acceptor to coordinate the nucleophile, but in the transition state acts as a general base to promote the nucleophilic enolate addition.This motif of engaging both the nucleophilic and electrophilic partners in a reaction and stabilizing them in the transition state is very common in bifunctional catalysis and many more examples can be found in the article on thiourea organocatalysis.|$|E
50|$|The {{conversion}} of chorismate to prephenate {{is the first}} committed step in the pathway {{to the production of}} the aromatic amino acids: tyrosine and phenylalanine. The presence of chorismate mutase increases the rate of the reaction a million fold. In the absence of enzyme catalysis this mechanism proceeds as a concerted, but asynchronous step and is an exergonic process. The mechanism for this transformation is formally a Claisen rearrangement, supported by the kinetic and isotopic data reported by Knowles, et alE. coli and Yeast chorismate mutase have a limited sequence homology, but their active sites contain similar residues. The active site of the Yeast chorismate mutase contains Arg16, Arg157, Thr242, Glu246, Glu198, Asn194, and Lys168. The E. coli active site contains the same residues with the exception of these noted exchanges: Asp48 for Asn194, Gln88 for Glu248, and Ser84 for Thr242. In the enzyme active site, interactions between these specific residues and the substrate restrict conformational degrees of freedom, such that the <b>entropy</b> <b>of</b> <b>activation</b> is effectively reduced to zero, and thereby promotes catalysis. As a result, there is no formal intermediate, but rather a pseudo-diaxial chair-like transition state. Evidence for this conformation is provided by an inverse secondary kinetic isotope effect at the carbon directly attached to the hydroxyl group. This seemingly unfavorable arrangement is achieved through a series of electrostatic interactions, which rotate the extended chain of chorismate into the conformation required for this concerted mechanism.An additional stabilizing factor in this enzyme-substrate complex is hydrogen bonding between the lone pair of the oxygen in the vinyl ether system and hydrogen bond donor residues. Not only does this stabilize the complex, but disruption of resonance within the vinyl ether destabilizes the ground state and reduces the energy barrier for this transformation. An alternative view is that electrostatic stabilization of the polarized transition state is of great importance in this reaction. In the chorismate mutase active site, the transition-state analog is stabilized by 12 electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions. This is shown in mutants of the native enzyme in which Arg90 is replaced with citrulline to demonstrate the importance of hydrogen bonding to stabilize the transition state. Other work using chorismate mutase from Bacillus subtilis showed evidence that when a cation was aptly placed in the active site, the electrostatic interactions between it and the negatively charged transition state promoted catalysis.|$|E
