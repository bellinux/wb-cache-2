40|$|The {{amount of}} {{available}} groundwater in a catchment changes quickly, {{and the amount}} of water that users can take sustainably depends on where and when it is taken. However, rights to water tend to be fixed, and obtaining rights to water incurs high transaction costs. As a result, water catchments are over-allocated worldwide. In this paper, I show how a catchment manager could match users' rights to the available water, in near real time, despite uncertain future inflows, while making effective use of all available hydrological data. The solution uses the framework of a smart market. A smart market is a periodic auction cleared {{with the help of an}} optimization model. In addition to market clearing, this model allows a convenient means to adjust <b>initial</b> <b>rights,</b> and the auction revenue reflects the available water relative to users' rights.

40|$|Clarification of <b>initial</b> water <b>rights</b> is {{the basis}} and {{prerequisite}} for a water rights trade-off market and also an effective {{solution to the problem}} of water scarcity and water conflicts. According to the new requirements for the most stringent water resources management in China, an <b>initial</b> provincial water <b>rights</b> allocation model is proposed. Firstly, based on analysis of multiple principles for <b>initial</b> provincial water <b>rights</b> allocation including total water use, water use efficiency, water quality of water function zones, regional coordination and sharing, an index system of <b>initial</b> provincial water <b>rights</b> allocation is designed. Secondly, according to dynamic projection pursuit technique, an <b>initial</b> provincial water <b>rights</b> allocation model with the total water use control is set up. Moreover, the self-adaptive chaotic optimization algorithm is applied to tackle the model. Finally, a case study of Taihu Basin is adopted. Considering the multiple scenarios of three different water frequencies (50 %, 75 % and 90 %) and planning year 2030, the empirical results show Jiangsu Province always obtains the most <b>initial</b> water <b>rights.</b> When the developing situation of provinces are given more consideration, Shanghai should acquire more <b>initial</b> water <b>rights</b> than Zhejiang Province; but when the dynamic increment evolving trend of provinces is taken more into account, Shanghai should obtain less <b>initial</b> water <b>rights</b> than Zhejiang Province.

40|$|Regional <b>initial</b> water <b>rights</b> is {{a crucial}} part of <b>initial</b> water <b>rights</b> and {{clarification}} of it is an essential method to improve the efficiency of water use. It also promotes sustainable use of valuable water resources. Consequently, under new circumstances of China’s most stringent water resources management, with water quantity and quality control, we propose a new perspective for a coupled allocation model of regional <b>initial</b> water <b>rights</b> for a typical river basin. Firstly, we design an index system following principles of the “Three Red Lines” considering the real situation of Dalinghe River Basin, China. Then, under the control of total water use, we establish an allocation model of regional <b>initial</b> water quantity <b>rights</b> by the projection pursuit technology. Secondly, under total pollutant discharge control, we established an allocation model of regional <b>initial</b> pollutant discharge <b>rights</b> considering optimized objectives of economy and society. Thirdly, considering both regional <b>initial</b> water quantity <b>rights</b> and the regional pollutant discharge rights above, we provide an incentive function to build a coupled allocation model for regional <b>initial</b> water <b>rights</b> of Dalinghe River Basin. Finally, according to the scenario of the water frequency 50 % and planning year 2030, the research finding shows Chaoyang City obtains the largest quantity of regional <b>initial</b> water <b>rights,</b> followed by Jinzhou, Fuxin, Panjin and Huludao, sequentially, which approximately match the pilot plans of China’s Ministry of Water Resources. The empirical research about Dalinghe River Basin further verifies effectiveness of the model in this paper. It also provides scientific decision support for implementing China’s most stringent water resources management for Dalinghe River Basin...|$|R

40|$|According to {{the newly}} {{introduced}} water resources management in China, {{which is the most}} stringent thus far, pollution limits of water functional zones should be enhanced. In response to this recent change, we propose a provincial <b>initial</b> water <b>rights</b> incentive allocation model with total pollutant discharge constraint. Firstly, three objective functions are set up, namely the maximum comprehensive economic benefits of basin, the optimal fairness and coordination of the provincial pollutant discharge rights, and the minimum losses of basin ecological environment. Based on the objective functions and constraint of total pollutant discharge, we put forward a multiple-objective provincial <b>initial</b> pollutant discharge <b>rights</b> allocation model with a self-adaptive chaotic optimization algorithm. Secondly, according to the incentive mechanism of rewarding excellence and punishing inferiority, we establish a provincial <b>initial</b> water <b>rights</b> allocation model with an incentive function which includes the amount of provincial initial pollutant discharge. Finally, we select the Taihu Basin as a case study to describe the methodology. Under water frequencies of 50 %, 75 %, and 90 %, the empirical results of provincial <b>initial</b> water <b>rights</b> allocation of the Taihu Basin in 2030 show that Jiangsu Province will obtain the most <b>initial</b> water <b>rights,</b> followed by Zhejiang Province and Shanghai city.

The disadvantage of poor visibility is similar in anterior approaches such as the transsternal and hemi-clamshell approaches. However, our approach requires a position change, and there are also disadvantages relative to providing ventilation during airway anastomosis, which is complicated and difficult to address in an emergency.
