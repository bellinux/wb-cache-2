5000|$|Arguably, appellees were {{on notice}} of Walko's claim once {{the motion to}} {{intervene}} was filed. As we have indicated, however, Walko's approach to this case was hardly one of vigilance. The statute of limitations reflects a legislative judgment of what is deemed an adequate {{period of time in}} which “a person of ordinary diligence” should bring his action. Ferrucci v. Jack, 255 Md. 523, 526, 258 A.2d 414 (1969); McMahan v. Dorchester Fert. Co., 184 Md. at 159, 40 A.2d 313. The unexplained delay in bringing a timely action here hardly bespeaks the “ordinary diligence” required of one seeking to toll the statute of limitations. Cromwell v. Ripley, 11 Md.App. at 182, 273 A.2d 218. In a very real sense, Walko has slept on its rights, Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, 421 U.S. 454, 466, 95 S.Ct. 1716, 44 L.Ed.2d 295 (1975), and cannot be heard to complain now for its own tarriance. See Braxton v.

40|$|We {{investigate}} common {{developments that}} can fold into plural incongruent orthogonal boxes. Recently, {{it was shown}} that there are inｆinitely many orthogonal polygons that <b>folds</b> into three <b>boxes</b> of different size. However, the smallest one that <b>folds</b> into three <b>boxes</b> consists of 532 unit squares. From the necessary condition, the smallest possible surface area that can <b>fold</b> into two <b>boxes</b> is 22, which admits to <b>fold</b> into two <b>boxes</b> of size 1 × 1 × 5 and 1 × 2 × 3. On the other hand, the smallest possible surface area for three different boxes is 46, which may admit tofold into three boxes of size 1 × 1 × 11, 1 × 2 × 7, and 1 × 3 × 5. For the area 22, {{it has been shown}} that there are 2, 263 common developments of two boxes by exhaustive search. However, the area 46 is too huge for search. In this paper, we focus on the polygons of area 30, which is the second smallest area of two boxes that admits to <b>fold</b> into two <b>boxes</b> of size 1 × 1 × 7 and 1 × 3 × 3. Moreover, when we admit to fold along diagonal lines of rectangles of size 1 × 2, the area may admit to <b>fold</b> into a <b>box</b> of size √ ×√ ×√. That is, the area 30 is the smallest candidate area for <b>folding</b> three different <b>boxes</b> in this manner. We perform twoalgorithms. The first algorithm is based on ZDDs, zero suppressed binary decision diagrams, and it computes in 10. 2 days on a usual desktop computer. The second algorithm performs exhaustive search, however, straightforward implementation cannot be run even on a supercomputersince it causes memory overflow. Using a hybrid search of DFS and BFS, it completes its computation in 3 months on a supercomputer. As results, we obtain (1) 1, 080 common developments of two boxes of size 1 × 1 × 7 and 1 × 3 × 3, and (2) 9 common developments of three boxes of size 1 × 1 × 7, 1 × 3 × 3, and √ × √ ×√.
