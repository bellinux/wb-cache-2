6000|$|He {{stopped to}} inform Howard Littlefield, his {{scholarly}} neighbor, that though {{the day had}} been springlike the evening might be cold. He went in to shout [...] "Where are you?" [...] at his wife, with no very definite desire to know where she was. He examined the lawn {{to see whether the}} <b>furnace-man</b> had raked it properly. With some satisfaction and a good deal of discussion of the matter with Mrs. Babbitt, Ted, and Howard Littlefield, he concluded that the <b>furnace-man</b> had not raked it properly. He cut two tufts of wild grass with his wife's largest dressmaking-scissors; he informed Ted that it was all nonsense having a furnace-man--"big husky fellow like you ought to do all the work around the house;" [...] and privately he meditated that it was agreeable to have it known throughout the neighborhood that he was so prosperous that his son never worked around the house.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{you look}} here! You may not believe it--Of course all {{you see is}} fat little Georgie Babbitt. Sure! Handy man around the house! Fixes the furnace when the <b>furnace-man</b> doesn't show up, and pays the bills, but dull, awful dull! Well, you may not believe it, but there's some women that think old George Babbitt isn't such a bad scout! They think he's not so bad-looking, not so bad that it hurts anyway, and he's {{got a pretty good}} line of guff, and some even think he shakes a darn wicked Walkover at dancing!" ...|$|E
60|$|When the <b>furnace-man</b> came, the Colonel {{sent him}} out to post it in the box {{at the corner of}} the square. He had {{determined}} not to say anything more about the matter before the girls, not choosing to let them see that he was elated; he tried to give the effect of its being an everyday sort of thing, abruptly closing the discussion with his order to Mrs. Lapham to accept; but he had remained swelling behind his newspaper during her prolonged struggle with her note, and he could no longer hide his elation when Irene followed her sister upstairs.|$|E
60|$|MRS. ROBERTS. [In a soft, slow voice, with {{a slight}} West-country burr.] Roberts will never give up the <b>furnace-men</b> and engineers. 'T wouldn't be right.|$|R
6000|$|Look at this, man! [Holding up his {{sheet of}} paper.] [...] "Demands conceded, with the {{exception}} of those relating to the engineers and <b>furnace-men.</b> Double wages for Saturday's overtime. Night-shifts as they are." [...] These terms have been agreed. The men go back to work again to-morrow. The strike is at an end.|$|R
6000|$|THOMAS. I ton't {{trust the}} Union; they haf treated us like tirt. [...] "Do what we tell you," [...] said they. I haf peen {{captain of the}} <b>furnace-men</b> twenty years, and I say to the Union--[excitedly]--"Can you tell me then, as well as I can tell you, what iss the right wages for the work that these men do?" [...] For fife and twenty years I haf paid my moneys to the Union and--[with great excitement]--for nothings! What iss that but roguery, for all that this Mr. Harness says! ...|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed very}} cramped at first, but she soon {{got used to}} it, and then {{she did not think}} about it; but {{accepted}} it as she did everything else in the life that was all so strange to her. She had never been in a boarding-house before, and she did not know whether it was New York usage or not, that her trunk, which the expressman had managed to leave in the lower hall, should be left standing there for twenty-four hours after his escape, and that then she should be asked to take some things out of it so that it should not be too heavy for the serving-maids to carry up to her room. There was no man-servant in the place; but the landlady said that they expected to have a <b>furnace-man</b> as soon as it came cold weather.|$|E
60|$|Babbitt moaned; turned over; {{struggled}} {{back toward}} his dream. He {{could see only}} her face now, beyond misty waters. The <b>furnace-man</b> slammed the basement door. A dog barked in the next yard. As Babbitt sank blissfully into a dim warm tide, the paper-carrier went by whistling, and the rolled-up Advocate thumped the front door. Babbitt roused, his stomach constricted with alarm. As he relaxed, he was pierced by the familiar and irritating rattle of some one cranking a Ford: snap-ah-ah, snap-ah-ah, snap-ah-ah. Himself a pious motorist, Babbitt cranked with the unseen driver, with him waited through taut hours for {{the roar of the}} starting engine, with him agonized as the roar ceased and again began the infernal patient snap-ah-ah--a round, flat sound, a shivering cold-morning sound, a sound infuriating and inescapable. Not till the rising voice of the motor told him that the Ford was moving was he released from the panting tension. He glanced once at his favorite tree, elm twigs against the gold patina of sky, and fumbled for sleep as for a drug. He who had been a boy very credulous of life was no longer greatly interested in the possible and improbable adventures of each new day.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} {{his playing}} career he married Emily Pitt in Nottingham. They then moved back to Nantwich, living at 22 Mill Street, Nantwich, where he became an {{engineering}} labourer, moving on to be a <b>furnace-man</b> at the local railway works. They had five children between 1907 and 1922: Eric, Doris, Leonard, James and Olive.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} {{protective}} eyewear {{goes back to}} 1880, when P. Johnson invented eye protectors. Johnson’s design used two layers of semi-opaque cloth. He had in mind that firemen, <b>furnace-men</b> and others exposed to intense light would use them to reduce the light intensity. They did not provide impact protection. As early as 1885, Arthur T. Fullicks bonded several pieces of glass together. It seems that another Englishman, John Crane Woods, had safety {{in mind when he}} patented the idea of bonding sheets of transparent cellulose nitrate, using Canadian balsam, between two sheets of glass. The product was unsuccessful due to expense, poor quality and lack of demand.|$|R
40|$|Background: Manganese (Mn) used as raw {{material}} for melting process in the ferrous foundry is considered as hazardous neurotoxic substance because it accumulates in {{the central nervous system}} and may cause neurological disorders. The <b>furnace-men</b> and melting department workers are potentially exposed to manganese particles or fume in the workplace. The objective of the research has been to investigate the sources and levels of manganese exposure in the foundry by correlation of blood-manganese (B-Mn) and air-manganese (air-Mn) measurement. Material and Methods: Air-Mn and Mn of blood serum were measured involving workers who worked in a big-sized foundry during 1 year. The standard method of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) ID- 121 was used for air and blood assessment and atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) was carried out for air and blood sample analysis. Results: The air sampling results have revealed that there is a high exposure to manganese (4. 5 mg/m 3) in the workplace as compared to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health’s (NIOSH) time weighted average (the reference time-weighted average (TWA) = 1 mg/m 3). The average blood serum Mn concentration was 2. 745 μg/l for subjects working for shorter than 3 months and 274. 85 μg/l for subjects working 3 – 12 months. Conclusions: Against the research hypothesis there was no correlation between the air-Mn concentration and the B-Mn (serum) level of manganese in the serum of the exposed subjects. It may be due to short time of air sampling of manganese airborne particles, and a real-time monitoring of airborne manganese particles is suggested for any future study.

5000|$|Daniel {{was born}} at Pontardawe, Glamorganshire, the son of Rees Daniel and his wife Ann. He was educated in Wales and after leaving school worked as a <b>furnace-man</b> in an iron and steel mill. He arrived in Queensland in 1900 where he set up several {{different}} businesses in Rockhampton including a tobacconist and casket agency. On the 22 December 1894 he married Sarah Ann Jenkins and together had three sons and two daughters. Sarah died in 1933 {{and the next year}} Daniel married Elvera Mary Petersen. He died in Rockhampton in January 1936 with his funeral proceeding from his Yaamba Rd residence to the South Rockhampton Cemetery.|$|E
