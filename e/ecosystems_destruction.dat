40|$|Deforestations, {{following}} by landscape fragmentation {{have been}} the main agent of natural <b>ecosystems</b> <b>destruction</b> worldwide. Landscape fragmentation {{can be understood as}} the process of transforming an area of continuous natural vegetation into smaller areas isolated from each other by environments different of the original. The objective {{of this study was to}} analyze the spatial structure of the deforestation polygons inserted into a landscape matrix of native Cerrado vegetation in the northern state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. In order to evaluate the effect of deforestation on the landscape structure we used metrics or landscape ecology indices. The landscape ecology indices were calculated using a free ArcGis 9. 3 software extension called V-Late (Vector-based Landscape Analysis). The results showed the occurrence of 30 deforestation polygons that together represent an area of 670. 86 ha. The largest deforestation polygon had an area of 428. 58 ha which accounts for over 60 % of the total area deforested. In environments where the landscape matrix is the native vegetation, the greater the edge area of the deforestation polygons, the greater the impact on the natural ecosystem. On the other hand, the smaller the edge area and the greater the distance between neighboring deforestation polygons, the lower will be the impact of deforestation on the natural ecosystem.

40|$|During the 1980 s and 1990 s, governments {{discovered}} multistakeholder {{processes as}} an effective tool for dealing with difficult issues such as land-use conflicts. In 1991, {{at the height of}} “the war in the woods ” between environmentalists and logging interests in British Columbia, the provin-cial government organized a multistakeholder process, the Commission on Resources and the Environment (CORE), to bring various interests together in an attempt to resolve land-use conflicts related to logging. This chapter begins by briefly explaining the social context of the CORE process as well as the structure of, and participants in, the process. I then isolate the elements of an effective multistakeholder process. I evaluate CORE by applying these elements to my participant-observer research conducted over a five-year period. The chapter concludes with a series of recommendations for activists to consider before deciding to participate in alternative dispute resolution or multistakeholder processes. The Social and Political Context of CORE Historically, the BC economy has been dependent on the exploitation of natural resources, especially logging, mining, and fishing. Ninety-four percent of the forest land base in the province is publicly owned Crown land. Since the mid- 1940 s, Crown land in British Columbia has been leased to forest companies that are allowed to cut at rates set by the provincial forester (see the discussion of tenure arrangements in the province in Chapter 2). By the 1970 s, public awareness of the amount and type of logging taking place had grown enormously. Damage to the envi-ronment attributed to logging included loss of old-growth <b>ecosystems,</b> <b>destruction</b> of fish habitat from landslides and siltation, and overcutting of timber. These problems were officially recognized by the provincial government’s Royal Commission on Forest Resources in 1976 (Pearse 1976). Furthermore, many believed that government management of fores...|$|E

40|$|The {{climate change}} {{believed}} by anthropogenic emission is not isolated but tightly coupled with other issues including biodiversity loss and ocean acidification etc., {{and in order}} to prevent the potential serious impacts, both political and technological methods are being tried for greenhouse mitigation. Dimming the income sunlight by some &#x 201 c;geoengineering&#x 201 d; approaches currently seem ruinously expensive and technically difficult, and would not prevent the increase of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in atmosphere and ocean acidification, so capturing carbon to reduce the environmental concentration of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and promoting renewable energy development for the reduction of using fossil fuels are very necessary. Biofuels derived from natural and agricultural biomass could be deployed for power production and existing transportation needs. The current economics are more favorable for conversion of edible biomass into biofuels, which could spend plenty of freshwater and farmlands, compete with food supply, and create a &#x 201 c;carbon debt&#x 201 d; with local <b>ecosystem</b> <b>destruction</b> by deforestation to expand biofuel-crop production. So it is vital to develop processes for converting non-edible feedstock such as lignocellulose and microalgae into biofuels. |$|R

In the oceans the radiolarians provide the only detailed record of the fate of planktonic communities and these undergo a phase of stress and final extinction before the marine benthos. The initial phase of the aftermath is characterized by a globally-distributed, low diversity biota and, in shallow, equatorial settings, by the precipitation of Precambrian-like anachronistic carbonates. These are well developed during low points in the δ 13 C record and may be related to super-saturated anoxic waters. Few groups radiate in the Early Triassic and those that did suffered a second mass extinction event late in the Smithian Stage, around 2 million years after the end-Permian event.

These are not future issues: for example, detrimental impacts of climate change (increased wildfires and extreme weather, sea-level rise, ocean acidification), pollution (contaminated drinking water {{in many parts of the}} world), rapid population growth in some areas (contributing to poverty, war, and increasingly frequent migration) and overconsumption in others (a main driver of overexploitation of resources and greenhouse gas emissions), and new disease outbreaks (Ebola, Zika virus) already are apparent today, and if trends of the past half century continue, even more damaging, long-lasting impacts would be locked in within three decades. Solving these problems will require some scientific and technological breakthroughs, but that will not be enough. Even more critical will be effective collaboration of environmental and physical scientists with social scientists and those in the humanities, active exchange of information among practitioners in academics, politics, religion, and business and other stakeholders, and clear communication of relevant issues and solutions to the general public.

Coastal resource management strategies are facing a new challenge: the integration of social, economic and natural sciences in future concepts to reverse the current status of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>destruction</b> and improvement of the people s living conditions. Hence, the primary objective of the coral farm is to provide alternative livelihood to fisher families from their resources on a sustained basis. The second objective is the rehabilitation of degraded reefs. Currently coral colonies of 64 species are taken through fragmentation from the wild. After 6 - 12 weeks (depending on the species) of grow-out in the farm, the fragments were deployed at the rehabilitation site at an average of 2 fragments per square meter (= 12. 5 % cover). The survival of fragments is high at 84 %, despite the fact that some coral colonies were placed in unsuitable substrates by the fisherfolk. More trainings have to be conducted improve their knowledge of coral biology and community structure. The net cost of rehabilitating a one-hectare reef is U$ 2, 100 for 12. 5 % cover. Additional profit from coral marketing is used for community projects identified by the folk.

40|$|Many {{factors such}} as poverty, {{ineffective}} institutions and environmental regulations may prevent developing countries from managing how natural resources are extracted to meet a strong market demand. Extraction for some resources has reached such proportions that evidence is measurable from space. We present recent evidence of the global demand for a single commodity and the <b>ecosystem</b> <b>destruction</b> resulting from commodity extraction, recorded by satellites {{for one of the}} most biodiverse areas of the world. We find that since 2003, recent mining deforestation in Madre de Dios, Peru is increasing nonlinearly alongside a constant annual rate of increase in international gold price (, 18 %/yr). We detect that the new pattern of mining deforestation (1915 ha/year, 2006 – 2009) is outpacing that of nearby settlement deforestation. We show that gold price is linked with exponential increases in Peruvian national mercury imports over time (R 2 = 0. 93, p = 0. 04, 2003 – 2009). Given the past rates of increase we predict that mercury imports may more than double for 2011 (, 500 t/year). Virtually all of Peru’s mercury imports are used in artisanal gold mining. Much of the mining increase is unregulated/ artisanal in nature, lacking environmental impact analysis or miner education. As a result, large quantities of mercury are being released into the atmosphere, sediments and waterways.

40|$|Asteroid and comet {{impacts on}} Earth are {{commonly}} viewed {{as agents of}} <b>ecosystem</b> <b>destruction,</b> be it on local or global scales. However, for some microbial communities, impacts may represent an opportunity for habitat formation as some substrates are rendered more suitable for colonization when processed by impacts. We describe how heavily shocked gneissic crystalline basement rocks exposed at the Haughton impact structure, Devon Island, Nunavut, Arctic Canada, are hosts to endolithic photosynthetic microorganisms in significantly greater abundance than lesser-shocked or unshocked gneisses. Two factors contribute to this enhancement: (a) increased porosity due to impact fracturing and differential mineral vaporization, and (b) increased translucence due to the selective vaporization of opaque mineral phases. Using biological ultraviolet radiation dosimetry, and by measuring the concentrations of photoprotective compounds, we demonstrate that a covering of 0. 8 mm of shocked gneiss can provide substantial protection from ultraviolet radiation, reducing the inactivation of Bacillus subtilis spores by 2 orders of magnitude. The colonisation of the shocked habitat represents a potential mechanism for pioneer microorganisms to invade an impact structure in the earliest stages of post-impact primary succession. The communities are analogous to the endolithic communities associated with sedimentary rocks in Antarctica, but because they occur in shocked crystalline rocks, they illustrate a mechanism {{for the creation of}} microbial habitats on planetary surfaces that do not have exposed sedimentary units.

Thus, it is deemed necessary to modify the existing urban and regional administrative system so as {{to cope with the}} challenges urban planning is being confronted with and realize the purpose of urban sustainability. This paper contributed to proposing a mechanism which helps to make urban planning with full consideration of issues with respect to sustainable development. We suggested that the integration of urban planning, SEA and ecological planning be a multi-win strategy to offset deficiency of each mentioned political tool being individually applied. We also proposed a framework where SEA and ecological planning are fully incorporated into urban planning, which forms a two-way constraint mechanism to ascertain environmental quality of urban planning, although in practice, planning and SEA processes may conditionally be unified. Moreover, as shown in the case study, the integration of the three political tools may be constrained due to slow changes in the contextual factors, in particular the political and cultural dimensions. Currently within the context of China, there may be three major elements which facilitate integration of the three political tools, which are (1) regulatory requirement of PEIA on urban planning, (2) the promotion or strong administrative support from government on eco-district building, and (3) the willingness of urban planners to collaborate with SEA experts or ecologists.

40|$|Martha Nussbaum has {{produced}} a compelling account of how we might do justice to non-human animals, but in doing so {{she seems to have}} committed us to a project of ‘policing nature’, which appears to be at odds with many of the ethical commitments of the contemporary environmental movement. Intervening to make the circumstances of wild animals more conducive to their flourishing may be in accordance with the principles of Nussbaum’s capabilities approach, but it is at odds with the concerns of environmentalists who wish to ensure the functioning of ecosystems and the survival of species as an ethical imperative. Superficially, at least, it appears that one cannot endorse the capabilities approach and simultaneously be an environmentalist. 	In this thesis, I attempt to reconcile these two positions through appeal to the exercise of the virtues. While many of the premises of the capabilities approach and of the environmentalist accounts of ethics that I discuss are mutually exclusive, I suggest that an environmental virtue ethic, such as that described by Ronald Sandler, can justify many of the ethical stances that the environmentalist wishes us to adopt. In particular, characteristics of the virtue of humility can inform the agent as to why extending justice to wild animals is not a warranted course of action. I also apply virtue ethical considerations to the issues of species extinction and <b>ecosystem</b> <b>destruction,</b> areas in which the capabilities approach seems to offer little guidance. Thus, I propose augmenting our capabilities-based account of justice with an environmentally conscious appeal to the virtues in order to produce more consistent moral guidance with regard to the non-human world. ...|$|R
40|$|Problems such as <b>ecosystem</b> <b>destruction,</b> {{resource}} scarcity, {{and global}} climate change {{have been linked to}} the term 2 ̆ 2 sustainability 2 ̆ 2. Problems related to sustainability are difficult because they involve epistemic uncertainty, very long time horizons, and extremely large scales; they invoke deeply-held values; and they affect the central interests of many key groups in society. This dissertation investigates the implications of such problems for decision making [...] i. e. choice in the context of sustainability. Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) is used to examine the case of vehicle fuel choice in the context of sustainability. However, the conventional MCA solution procedure is found to be inappropriate, so a modified, two-stage technique is developed. In the first stage a conjunctive filter is used to screen out alternatives which are unacceptable from a biogeophysical standpoint. In the second stage the conventional MCA solution procedure is used to evaluate the remaining alternatives. The arguments for this two-stage technique strongly imply that sustainability cannot be adequately represented or measured with a single-scaled metric, such as in monetary terms. The most immediate conclusion is that none of the vehicle fuels currently available (including gasoline, natural gas, liquified petroleum gas, methanol and ethanol) are adequate for use in a sustainable society. The overriding energy policy prescription is for the development of vehicle fuels which do not rely on fossil energy sources, do not contribute to {{global climate change}}, and the production of which does not irreversibly degrade the environment. More broadly, risk-averse approaches to decision making, such as the precautionary principle, regret-minimizing decision rules, and the two-stage MCA technique developed in this dissertation are recommended for problems related to sustainability. Research which improves our understanding of biosphere 2 ̆ 7 s structure and function, and thus reduces epistemic uncertainty, is also supported. ...|$|R

Herbivore grazers that eat grass, preferring the shortest grains, the white rhinoceros {{is one of the}} largest pure grazers. It drinks twice a day if water is available, but if conditions are dry it can live four or five days without water. It spends about half of the day eating, one third resting, and the rest of the day doing various other things. White rhinoceroses, like all species of rhinoceros, love wallowing in mudholes to cool down. The white Rhinoceros is thought to have changed the structure and ecology of the savanna's grasslands. Comparatively based on studies of the African elephant, scientists believe the white Rhino is a driving factor in its <b>ecosystem.</b> The <b>destruction</b> of the megaherbivore could have serious cascading effects on the ecosystem and harm other animals.|$|R
40|$|Concrete {{is a type}} of {{construction}} material in which cement, aggregate, and admixture materials are mixed. When cement is produced, large amounts of substances that impact the environment are emitted during limestone extraction and clinker manufacturing. Additionally, the extraction of natural aggregate causes soil erosion and <b>ecosystem</b> <b>destruction.</b> Furthermore, in the process of transporting raw materials such as cement and aggregate to a concrete production company, and producing concrete in a batch plant, substances with an environmental impact are emitted into the air and water system due to energy use. Considering the fact that the process of producing concrete causes various environmental impacts, an assessment of various environmental impact categories is needed. This study used a life cycle assessment (LCA) to evaluate the environmental impacts of concrete in terms of its global warming potential, acidification potential, eutrophication potential, ozone depletion potential, photochemical ozone creation potential, and abiotic depletion potential (GWP, AP, EP, ODP, POCP, ADP). The tendency was that the higher the strength of concrete, the higher the GWP, POCP, and ADP indices became, whereas the AP and EP indices became slightly lower. As the admixture mixing ratio of concrete increased, the GWP, AP, ODP, ADP, and POCP decreased, but EP index showed a tendency to increase slightly. Moreover, as the recycled aggregate mixing ratio of concrete increased, the AP, EP, ODP, and ADP decreased, while GWP and POCP increased. The GWP and POCP per unit compressed strength (1 MPa) of high strength concrete were found to be about 13 % lower than that for its normal strength concrete counterpart. Furthermore, in the case of AP, EP, ODP, and ADP per unit compressed strength (1 MPa), high-strength concrete was found to be about 10 %~ 25 % lower than its normal strength counterpart. Among all the environmental impact categories, ordinary cement was found to have the greatest impact on GWP, POCP, and ADP, while aggregate had the most impact on AP, EP, and ODP...|$|R
40|$|The natural human {{environment}} {{is a source}} not only of resources for development, but also {{of a variety of}} hazards that can hamper this development. Abrupt climate changes, enormous consumption of natural resources, and pollution of the environment inevitably lead to an increase in the probability of making wrong decisions in various aspects of nature management. The paper considers five basic types of anthropogenic impacts on the Earth's <b>ecosystem,</b> namely: <b>destruction</b> of the biosphere, intensification of natural disasters, pollution of natural environments, depletion of natural resources, and land degradation. The features of Siberian nature that create special environmental situation conditions are shown. A scheme for studying the natural-anthropogenic risk at the regional level is suggested. Economic development of new territories in Siberia, including the development of oil and gas fields, and pipelines, power lines, and roads construction, leads to increased natural hazards. Knowledge of natural processes, assessment of hazard and risk of nature management, forecast of environmental hazards development, and proposals development to reduce the natural-anthropogenic risk is required...|$|R
