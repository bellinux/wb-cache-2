A 2008 study concluded that, based on US data from the period 2000–2002, adolescent-onset (defined here as ages 11–17) usage of hallucinogenic drugs (including psilocybin) did not increase the risk of drug dependence in adulthood; this was in contrast to adolescent usage of cannabis, cocaine, inhalants, anxiolytic medicines, and stimulants, all of which were associated with [...] "an <b>excess</b> <b>risk</b> of developing clinical features associated with drug dependence". Likewise, a 2010 Dutch study ranked the relative harm of psilocybin mushrooms compared to a selection of 19 recreational drugs, including alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy, heroin, and tobacco.

The class of compound <b>risk</b> <b>excess</b> measures is obtained for those measures which depend only on the joint law of the random elements (X,Y). Mass transportation gives a natural way to obtain minimal extensions of compound <b>risk</b> <b>excess</b> measures to <b>risk</b> <b>excess</b> measures {{in the space of}} distributions, i.e., which depend only on the marginal laws of X and Y.

Moreover, hydration, the most established prevention measure to prevent contrast induced nephropathy was shown to be ineffective in the POSEIDON trial, raising further doubts {{regarding the}} significance of this disease state. [...] A meta-analysis of 28 studies of AKI after CT with radiocontrast showed no causal relationship between the use of radiocontrast and AKI.|$|E
2500|$|Studies {{have shown}} that the use of {{antidepressants}} is correlated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviour and thinking (suicidality) in those aged under 25. This problem has been serious enough to warrant government intervention by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to warn of the increased risk of suicidality during antidepressant treatment. According to the FDA, the heightened risk of suicidality is within the first one to two months of treatment. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) places the <b>excess</b> <b>risk</b> in the [...] "early stages of treatment". A meta-analysis suggests that the relationship between antidepressant use and suicidal behavior or thoughts is age-dependent. Compared to placebo the use of antidepressants is associated with an increase in suicidal behavior or thoughts among those aged under 25 (OR=1.62). This increase in suicidality approaches that observed in children and adolescents. There is no effect or possibly a mild protective effect among those aged 25 to 64 (OR=0.79). Antidepressant treatment has a protective effect against suicidality among those aged 65 and over (OR=0.37).|$|E
40|$|An {{international}} {{cohort of}} asphalt workers was assembled to study cancer risk after bitumen exposure. This {{article describes the}} combination of the exposure assessment with the exposure-response for a quantitative risk assessment for lung cancer mortality within the Dutch component of the study. We identi ed a retrospective cohort of 3, 709 workers with at least one season of employment. Semi-quantitative exposure to bitumen fume was estimated by a job-exposure matrix. Exposure-response relations were tted by Poisson regression, and <b>excess</b> lifetime <b>risks</b> through age 75 were calculated by a life table method. Working lifetime cumulative exposure to bitumen fume was calculated under different scenarios, representing past and future exposures. For workers with exposures accumulated in the past, <b>excess</b> <b>risks</b> for lung cancer varied from 7. 8 to 14. 3 %. Calculations for future exposures resulted in considerably lower <b>excess</b> <b>risks</b> ranging from 0. 6 to 2. 6 %. The calculated <b>excess</b> <b>risks</b> for lung cancer mortality after working lifetime exposure to bitumen fume depend strongly on when exposure was experienced and to some extent on the exposure-response model chosen, while confounding by smoking cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, the <b>excess</b> lifetime <b>risk</b> for lung cancer in this Dutch cohort of asphalt workers is above benchmark risks as applied by the Dutch Health Council. Current exposure levels have decreased this risk considerably, but further exposure control may be required. Toxicology and Industrial Health 2002...|$|R

2500|$|Impoverished {{workers are}} more likely to hold {{part-time}} jobs, move in and out of work, be migrant workers, or experience stress associated with being unemployed and searching unsuccessfully for unemployment, which all in turn affects health outcomes. According to the WHO, employment and working conditions greatly affect health equity (Kivimaki et al., 2003). [...] This occurs because poor employment conditions exposes individuals to health hazards, which {{are more likely}} for low-status jobs. Evidence confirms that high job demand, low control, and low rewards for effort in these low status jobs are risk factors for mental and physical health problems, such as a 50% <b>excess</b> <b>risk</b> of heart disease (Stansfeld & Candy, 2006). [...] The growing power of massive, conglomerate global corporations and institutions to set labor policy and standards agendas has disempowered workers, unions, and the job-seeking by subjecting these individuals to health-damaging working conditions. (EMCONET, 2007). [...] In high- income countries, there has been a growth in job insecurity and precarious employment arrangements (such as informal work, temporary work, part-time work, and piecework), job losses, and a weakening of regulatory protections. Informal work can threaten health through its precarious job instability, lack of regulation to protect working conditions and occupational health and safety. Evidence from the WHO suggests mortality is greater among temporary workers than permanent workers. (Kivimaki et al., 2003). [...] Since most of the global workforce operates under the informal economy, particularly low- and middle-income countries, impoverished populations are greatly affected by these factors.|$|E

This systematic review aims at synthesizing the recent literature on occupational exposures among HCWs related to fetal death, congenital anomalies, and fertility disorders. Methods: We searched the Medline database from 2000 to 2015 for articles about all potential occupational exposures {{of women and}} men working in this sector. Results: We retained 32 studies, most of them (n = 30) among women HCWs. Studies based on job title reported <b>excess</b> <b>risks</b> of some congenital anomalies (especially nervous and musculoskeletal systems) among HCWs compared to non-HCWs but no evidence about fetal death. <b>Excess</b> <b>risks</b> associated with specific exposures includes reports of some congenital anomalies forwomenexposed to anesthetic gases. Exposure to some sterilizing agents and, with less evidence, to antineoplastic drugs and to ionizing radiation, is associated with increased risks of miscarriage but not stillbirth. Strenuous work schedules appear to be associated with fertility disorders, but the evidence is limited. Only a few studies have been published since 2000 about non-ionizing radiation, or about fertility disorders related to chemical or physical agents, or about male HCWs.

METHODS: We used data from the SYNERGY project including pooled information on lifetime work histories and smoking habits from 16 case-control studies conducted in Europe, Canada, New Zealand, and China. RESULTS: Before adjustment for smoking, we observed {{an increased risk of}} lung cancer in male cooks, but not in female cooks. After adjusting, there was no increased risk and no significant exposure-response relationship. Nevertheless, subgroup analyses highlighted some possible <b>excess</b> <b>risks</b> of squamous cell carcinoma and small cell carcinoma in female cooks.
