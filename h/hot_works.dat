Such balance is particularly important for multiple cavity dies or sections with varying thicknesses {{in order to maintain}} a uniform velocity profile across the face of the die. In this research, surface texturing (called as micro-pits) was embedded on taper die sliding contact surface to explore its effectiveness on finish product of cold extrusion process. Palm oil based lubricants were tested for cold extrusion processes and mineral oils were used for comparison purpose. It was found that taper die with micro-pits (PA) performed a lessened extrusion load than taper die without micro-pits (NA), so as enhanced the performance of other tests parameter. In addition, viscosity of lubricant seems to be very important in ensuring that no material and tribological failures occur during the metal forming process...|$|E

40|$|From a fire {{perspective}} EPS insulation has {{characteristics that}} makes it inflammable and can cause fast fire spread which is aggravating for the fire and rescue services. Reports from fire and rescue operations related to both EPS insulation and construction sites of buildings, show that fires most often are related to faults in protecting combustible materials during <b>hot</b> <b>works</b> such as welding. A case study was performed with the purpose to investigate flaws during handling and installation of EPS insulation at four construction sites. The project consisted of field studies with interviews with respective site managers and a supplier of façade systems. Interviews were also conducted with the fire and rescue services to obtain a deeper understanding for the problems of fire rescue operations during fires with large quantities of EPS insulation and the risks from using combustible insulation in modern building technology. The study showed that fire safety measurements were not taken during handling and installation of EPS insulation in particular. EPS insulation was only looked at from an economical perspective which resulted in large quantities of insulation stored at the construction sites and in scaffolds prior to installation. It was concluded that handling and installation of EPS insulation was inadequate from a construction site fire safety point of view. Furthermore irregularities and lack of thoroughly made inspections of insulation of façade installations show {{that there are a}} lot of uncertainty regarding the fire safety of a façade with combustible insulation. Suggestions to limit fires in combustible insulations, increase quality of the construction of facades as well as raise awareness of fire hazards during planning and construction of buildings were made...|$|E
40|$|Maintenance {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} and critical activities in every high rise commercial building. Maintenance activities often comprised of risk increasing factors and different kinds of potential hazards. Significant numbers of maintenance workers may be exposed to a variety of risks when doing their job. The safety of the maintenance workers should be prioritized in every maintenance work. It is mandatory to provide a safe working environment for their workers. Organisations and maintenance workers are not adhering appropriate safety practices to safeguard their lives and properties. Initiated regulations and standards are not specifically designed for the building maintenance activities. Therefore, this research intended to address this issue by developing a framework to ensure safety of maintenance workers in commercial buildings. Initially, a comprehensive literature review was carried out on the subject matter. Based on the nature of the study, data collection was carried out in two phases. A case study approach was used to gather existing information on maintenance works carried out under different categories, their related hazards. Semi structured interviews were conducted with a professional who is in the management level of the maintenance department in each selected case study. Expert survey was then carried out with three industry professionals to gather information about appropriate suggestions to ensure the safety of maintenance workers. The study highlighted key categories of maintenance works as confined space works, <b>hot</b> <b>works,</b> works at height, works involve with electrical equipment and works involve in using dangerous substance. These activities involve with different kinds of potential hazards such as physical, chemical, biological and psychological.

40|$|This report {{deals with}} the second step in the project GRUVAN: the site {{inventory}} in operational mines. The main purposes of the inventory are: -          To get {{a clear picture of}} the risks in the different mines. -          To get a clear picture of the protective measures of each mine. -          Optimize the choice of design fires for each mine. The site inventories were conducted through actual visits to the two LKAB mines in Sweden and through e-mail correspondence with LKAB personnel responsible for the different sections and areas. During the inventories, predefined forms for each type of item were used in order to facilitate the work. The following items were examined: -          Combustible materials in general, for example large amounts of wood. -          Vehicles -          Cables -          Fire barriers -          Ventilation systems -          Extinguishing systems   Besides the above items, earlier fires and fire incidents were also examined. As the two LKAB mines are tremendously large with a large amount of equipment etc, only the most common vehicles were listed and examined further. Also, only the sites with the largest amount of cables and other combustible materials were listed.   The following conclusions were made based upon the findings of the inventory: -          With respect to earlier fires and fire incidents for the two LKAB mines, the most common causes and the causes to focus on are: electrical cause, flammable liquid or material on hot surface, <b>hot</b> <b>works</b> and equipment running hot. -          Both the production area and the infrastructure part should be regarded in the future studies as fires are almost identically frequent in both areas. -          When it comes to combustible material in general, the amount of combustibles seems to be more frequent in the Malmberget mine. In the Kiruna mine, the places with wood and conveyor belts seems to be interesting enough for further investigation. Even though self extinguishing conveyor belts means a limited fire in size, the amount of smoke emitted can be quite extensive. Also the storage of tyres at the contractor’s depots could be worthwhile investigating due to the sensitive surroundings. -          Regarding the Malmberget mine, the sites with wood combustibles, tyres and conveyor belts are all interesting for further investigation due to the large amount of combustibles and the surroundings. -          With respect to flammable liquids: - The tank stations in the Kiruna and the Malmberget mine should be looked          into with respect to potential pool fires. - The larger workshops and warehouses in the Kiruna mine and the Malmberget     mine should also be investigated with respect to pool fires. - The crusher levels and draw points in the two mines should be investigated          with respect to spray fires. - The diesel tanks in the main ramps and the production areas should be investigated with respect to pool fires. - The media drifts, distribution levels, shaft hoisting levels and pumping stations    should be investigated with respect to pool fires. -          With respect to fire barriers, as the main ramps of each mine does not contain any fire barriers the impact of a vehicle fire in the main ramp would be interesting to investigate. It would also be interesting to validate the ventilation strategy in the Malmberget mine regarding preventing smoke spread to adjacent compartments. -          With respect to vehicles, all the common heavy vehicles listed in this report would be worthwhile to try to reconstruct a possible fire scenario for each type of vehicle. The reason for this is to have better tools when working on possible scenarios of each mine. -          Regarding cables, all listed sites with a high load of electrical cables would be interesting to investigate. Even though the immediate surroundings are not sensitive, an extensive smoke spread would make a large impact on {{a large portion of the}} mine. -          When looking into the ventilation system of the Kiruna mine, both the mine production area and the infrastructure part should be investigated due to the differences in each system and their surroundings. Also, the difference in systems whether you are below or above level 775 should be considered. The function and impact of oversteering should also be included in the investigations. -          The impact of a ventiflex PVC-tube being burned up on the fire behaviour in a production area should be investigated. The different fire scenarios in a production area depending on the position of the fire with respect to the ventilation should also be investigated. -          One scenario should put the fire right at the end of the intake air tube, other scenarios should be at a certain length interval from the end of the intake air tube. The likelihood of the power cables to the intake and exhaust air fans being burned off should be looked into. The impact on the surroundings should also be investigated. The return air fan capacity should be examined with respect to fires, such as vehicle fires. GRUVA...|$|E

40|$|This {{report is}} part of the {{research}} project “Concept for fire and smoke spread prevention inmines”, conducted by a research group at Mälardalen University. The project is aimed at improving fire safety in mines in order to obtain a safer working environment for the people working for the mining companies in Sweden or for visitors in mines open to the public. This report deals with {{the first step in the}} project: the literature survey. The main purposes of the literature survey are: - To investigate and present what has been done in the non-coal underground mine firefield in the past. - To give recommendations on the continued work with regard to fire safety inunderground non-coal mines. A large amount of articles in scientific publications and material on internet were found duringthe literature survey. Most of the material was from USA, Canada, South Africa, Australia, Sweden, India, China, Russia and United Kingdom. The following conclusions were made based upon the findings of the literature survey: Starting with the statistical material, the most common fire cause in underground mines isflammable liquid sprayed onto hot surface, followed by electrical shorting/arcing and <b>hot</b> <b>works.</b> So based upon the statistics, a conclusion would thus be to focus on spray fires, fire caused byflammable liquid ignited by hot surface, vehicles fires (including rubber tires) and cable fires. Continuing on with the interesting locations in underground mines, mobile equipment workingareas would be first priority due to the high risk of fires in mobile equipment. Furthermore the types of mobile equipment to focus on should be: service vehicles, drilling rigsand loaders. There is at the moment no need for any extensive research with respect to the ignitability and flammability of pressurized hydraulic fluids, as an extensive work has already been conducted. Still the type of hydraulic fluid being used in the Swedish mines should be investigated and fire resistant hydraulic fluid should be recommended being used whenever possible. The results from the articles can be used when examining the equipment that is used containinghydraulic fluid (i. e. what potential ignition sources can be found on the equipment), what type ofhydraulic fluid being used and what actions that can be taken to minimize the risk of a spray fire. A major concern is the lack of documented fire experiments in vehicles/mobile equipment. This is essential knowledge when designing new mine sections and overlooking existing sections. Thus there is a great need for HRR curves, also due to for example the fact that a majority of the firesin underground mines involve vehicles/mobile equipment. Taking into account that conveyor belt fires are not a dominating fire cause in non-coal minesand the fact that a very intensive work has dealt with for example ignitability and flammability,HRR curves etc. The focus should not be on this type of design fire during the project. Nevertheless a relatively easy and effortless task would be to investigate and list the principalcauses of belt conveyor fires in underground non-coal mines. Another interesting issue would be to investigate the minimum ventilation velocity for beltsurface-to-roof distances much greater than 0. 22 m, which is applicable for the LKAB mines. Research material so far has mainly dealt with cases where the surface-to-roof distances are equalto or less than 0. 22 m. Taking into account the enormous volume of cables present in an underground mine and the factthat the statistics put cable fires high on the list, some efforts should be made with respect to thistype of fire. Generally there is a demand for investigation of the friction losses of fire gases in a mine drift (asnot all CFD models will be able to take this into account). Further work is needed within thisdiscipline. When performing full scale experiments in an underground mine, models and equationsdescribing the heat exchange between fire/fire gases and rock should be validated at the sametime. The articles Simplified method to calculate the heat transfer between mine air and mine rock / 18 / andModelling of heat exchange between flowing air and tunnel walls / 19 / contain methods for calculating theheat exchange that could be worth looking further into and validating during the future fire experiments. Regarding the movement of fire gases in a mine ventilation network, the earlier work will have tobe supplemented with fire experiments with more complicated and varying geometry (openingarea, inclination, aspect ratio), larger test area, reversing/increasing the ventilation, and larger,non-steady state fires are needed. Besides performing the fire experiments the results should alsobe examined against the results of corresponding CFD/ventilation network simulation program. A practical issue that would greatly affect the fire safety in production areas is the difficulty inpreventing smoke spreading from a fire affected production area, as no fire barriers are possible(the blasting taking place every day would destroy the fire barriers), other methods will have to belooked into. The use of a CFD model together with a ventilation network simulation program would be veryinteresting to investigate. The results should be compared with corresponding fire experiments. Ventilation network simulation programs could at the same time be validated for a non-coalmine. The work on CFD modelling in underground mines has so far been fragmentary; a moreextensive work is needed, where: - The geometry is varied (opening area, inclination, aspect ratio etc.) and made morecomplicated in the vicinity of the fire. - Non-steady state fires and larger fires. - Friction losses/obstacles. - Heat losses to surrounding rock. - Changes in ventilation (non-steady state ventilation). Besides the investigation of the above factors the investigation should also include theimplementation of CFD models and suggestions on improvements should be made. Conveyor belts, cables etc. are regulated with respect to their flammability but others are not. Inorder to get a good picture of the fire risk in Swedish underground an inventory and aninvestigation should be performed. The use of fire suppression systems and rapid fire detection systems should be considered formanned cabs in Swedish mines. The reason for this is the rapid fire behaviour of spray fires. A large part of the earlier mine safety research has been conducted with respect to detecting firesin mines and conveyor belts. No further work is identified at the moment. As organic material stored in abandoned, backfilled parts of mines could be applicable to touristmines, the risk of spontaneous combustion is a subject in these cases. During the search no material related to tourist mines was found. Finally, the three activities with the highest priority are: - Conducting fire experiments with respect to cab/vehicle fires, resulting in HRR curves. - Conducting an extensive work on CFD modelling (validating the results withcorresponding fire experiments), where:o The geometry is varied (opening area, inclination, aspect ratio etc.) and mademore complicated in the vicinity of the fire. o Non-steady state fires and larger fires. o Friction losses/obstacles. o Heat losses to surrounding rock. o Changes in ventilation (non-steady state ventilation). - Investigating the use of a CFD model together with a ventilation network simulationprogram. The results should be compared with corresponding fire experiments. Concept for fire and smoke spread prevention in mine...|$|E

40|$|The National Fire Code of Canada (NFCC) is {{one model}} code which regulates <b>hot</b> <b>work</b> in Canada. The code {{specifies}} that <b>hot</b> <b>work</b> processes need only create heat {{to be considered}} <b>hot</b> <b>work</b> processes, and requires that precautions taken adhere to those in Canadian Standards Association (CSA) W 117. 2, which is intended for welding, cutting and allied processes. CSA W 117. 2 requires a 15 m spherical radius of separation in which combustibles are ideally relocated or, at minimum, be protected with fire blankets. Openings, cracks and other locations in which sparks or hot particles must also be protected within this distance. Additionally CSA W 117. 2 requires a fire watch during, and one hour following {{the completion of the}} work. The NFCC stipulates more stringent requirements on the fire watch than CSA W 117. 2, requiring a check back 4 hours after the work. The code in its current form requires the same precautions be taken when using a soldering iron or epoxy resin as when using an oxyacetylene torch to flame cut steel. The lack of hazard characterization of <b>hot</b> <b>work</b> processes, and the umbrella prescription of required fire safety precautions can result in insufficient measures to prevent fires in some scenarios, and inordinate precautionary measures in others. While not applicable law in all jurisdictions, the NFCC is relied on in various Canadian industries for regulative purposes. Nuclear power generation in Canada is one such industry facing onerous fire protection costs resulting from following these precautions for the smallest of jobs requiring heat producing tools. The literature review highlights the dearth of scientific knowledge regarding the propensity of <b>hot</b> <b>work</b> as an ignition source and how this shortcoming manifests itself in issues across the various standards governing <b>hot</b> <b>work</b> practices. The objective of this research is to assess fire hazards resulting from various processes considered <b>hot</b> <b>work</b> under the National Fire Code of Canada (NFCC). Due to the breadth of processes covered by the NFCC, a spectrum of <b>hot</b> <b>work</b> activities was investigated from processes as innocuous as the application of heated adhesive, to well known sources of ignition such as a variety of welding processes, oxyacetylene cutting and plasma cutting. To streamline the hazard assessment, processes were categorised into three groups based upon expected hazards such that testing could focus on the most prominent ignition danger presented by each. The groups were those processes exhibiting hot surface ignition hazards, processes with hot surface ignition hazards in addition to limited potential to generate hot particles, and those processes in which the generation of significant quantities of spark and hot particles is guaranteed. For the first two process categories, experimentation focused on determining a critical process temperature with which to rank processes and also compare with ignition temperatures of combustibles commonly involved in <b>hot</b> <b>work</b> fires. The critical process temperature was determined as the highest measured temperature of the workpiece or tool during the chosen process and was typically measured with the use of thermocouples and infrared thermography. Characterization of any hot particles in the second category was performed using infrared thermography, and in some cases, thermal paper. Literature sources indicated that sparks and hot particles are the largest factor in <b>hot</b> <b>work</b> fires, so specialised methodology was developed for the third category of processes to characterise the distribution of many thousands of <b>hot</b> <b>work</b> particles generated during welding, thermal cutting and other <b>hot</b> particle producing <b>work.</b> The distributions collected were used to determine the area enveloped by the ignition hazard of hot particles as well as areas encompassing the highest threat to combustibles in relative terms. Several of the processes as studied were found not to exhibit any measurable form of ignition hazard, including forms of manual sanding and filing and rotary filing of steel. Heated adhesive, cutting steel with a reciprocating saw and drilling of steel were shown to exhibit moderate degrees of hazard with temperature rise of 195 C or less, suggesting potential hazard to a limited group of combustibles. Welding and cutting processes were shown to have a relative ignition potential across a wide area. Typical welding procedures produced hot particles which travelled a maximum of approximately 3 - 4 m while thermal cutting processes ejected sparks, slag and hot particles up to 9. 8 m from the work. Incorporated properly into updated standards and codes, the results and findings of this research could drastically improve the Canadian model codes regarding the regulation of <b>hot</b> <b>work</b> by decreasing cost and difficulty for Canadian Industry without increasing the risk of loss...|$|R
