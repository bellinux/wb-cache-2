5|$|Netflix {{required}} the production to shoot with 4K cameras {{to make the}} look of the show <b>future-proof</b> and John Toll who is credited as the main director of photography for overseeing the distinct look of the nine featured locations, made the decision to shoot by using mostly Sony's CineAlta PMW-F55 cameras, paired with Carl Zeiss Ultra Prime and Cooke Optics S4 lenses. During the first season, Toll, once again collaborating with the Wachowskis and Glass after Cloud Atlas and Jupiter Ascending, personally handled the cinematography in San Francisco, Chicago, London, Iceland, and Seoul. Toll's approach to shooting was to use a lot of Steadicam and hand-held partly out of the necessity to follow the faster schedule of a television production compared to the feature films he was used to working on. Additional cinematographers worked {{with the rest of the}} directors in the remaining locations and they used a similar shooting style because they were facing the same scheduling challenges. McTeigue's cinematographer of choice for shooting in Mexico City and Mumbai was Danny Ruhlmann, who previously shot The Raven and Survivor for him. Tykwer worked with Frank Griebe and Christian Almesberger for the Berlin and Nairobi scenes respectively. Griebe had previously shot seven feature films of Tykwer's including Cloud Atlas and Almesberger was the cinematographer of two films Tykwer had produced in Nairobi: Soul Boy and Nairobi Half Life.|$|E

The fifth edition substitutes the mechanism of XML 1.1, which is more <b>future-proof</b> but reduces redundancy. The approach taken in the fifth edition of XML 1.0 and in all editions of XML 1.1 is that only certain characters are forbidden in names, and everything else is allowed to accommodate suitable name characters in future Unicode versions. In the fifth edition, XML names may contain characters in the Balinese, Cham, or Phoenician scripts among many others added to Unicode since Unicode 3.2.|$|E

25|$|A {{sizeable}} bus infrastructure {{which is}} part of the London Buses network operates from a main hub at West Croydon station. The bus station at West Croydon is undergoing a major re-development to make it more modern and <b>future-proof.</b> There are also plans to create a new bus terminal at Park Place if the shopping centre is built. Addington Interchange is a regional bus terminal in Addington Village which has an interchange between route three and bus services in the remote area. Arriva London, part of Arriva, is one of the largest bus operators to serve Croydon along with Metrobus, Selkent, and National Express London. Unlike other places in the country, London's transport infrastructure is regulated and therefore is not subject to price wars between different companies with TfL setting a standard price for bus services which is currently set at 90p with an Oyster card. Services include buses to central London, Purley Way, Bromley, Lewisham and a number of other civic centres in the south. London Buses route X26, the longest route in London, provides services to Heathrow Airport via Richmond and Sutton.|$|E

40|$|Under {{the label}} “future-proofing”, this paper {{examines}} the temporal component of sustainable construction as an unexplored, yet fundamental {{ingredient in the}} delivery of low-energy domestic buildings. The overarching aim is to explore the integration of <b>future-proofed</b> design approaches into current mainstream construction practice in the UK, focusing on the example of the Code for Sustainable Homes (CSH) tool. Regulation has been the most significant driver for achieving the 2016 zero-carbon target; however, there is a gap between the appeal for <b>future-proofing</b> and the lack of effective implementation by building professionals. Even though the CSH was introduced as the leading tool to drive the “step-change” required for achieving zero-carbon new homes by 2016 and the single national standard to encourage energy performance beyond current statutory minima, it lacks assessment criteria that explicitly promote a futures perspective. Based on an established conceptual model of <b>future-proofing,</b> 14 interviews with building practitioners in the UK were conducted to identify the “feasible” and “reasonably feasible” <b>future-proofed</b> design approaches with the potential to enhance the “Energy and CO 2 Emissions” category of the CSH. The findings are categorised under three key aspects; namely: coverage of sustainability issues; adopting lifecycle thinking; and accommodating risks and uncertainties and seek to inform industry practice and policy-making in relation to building energy performance...|$|R
500|$|The line's {{construction}} {{has been described}} as resembling a [...] "basic railway" [...] built to a tight budget and incorporating a number of cost-saving features. This is in contrast to the reopened Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link, which was built as a double-track electrified railway from the outset. The difference between the two lines has been claimed by commentators to reflect scepticism toward the Borders Railway, which has existed since proposals were first made in the 1990s, as well as a reluctance to allow the project to become too ambitious. In particular, a 2011 cost-cutting exercise by Transport Scotland resulted in a new project specification which reduced the dynamic passing loops from their planned length of , and failed to <b>future-proof</b> the line by providing for all eight road bridges to be built to single-track width only, including the five bridges on the section between Tynehead and [...] Stow where there were otherwise no other obstacles to doubling of the line.|$|E

Following the extension to east London, serving areas once poorly connected to the Underground, the line has seen a huge growth in passenger numbers and is the third-busiest on the network, with over 213million passenger journeys in 2011/12.|$|E

It is a <b>future-proof</b> esplanade which {{involves}} {{the development of}} 1.6 kilometers stretch of foreshore area spanning from Sta. Cruz of Barangay Central to Purok Bularan of Barangay Miputak. Equipped with adequate facilities like basketball courts and playground park, the city boulevard serves as a tourist destination for every young and old to enjoy. It is also {{the site of the}} annual [...] "Pagsalabuk Festival" [...] and motor company trade shows. With the construction of two commercial buildings, which are now ready for occupancy, the complex also becomes a host to prospective locators who wish to do business in the area, augmenting the presently existing restaurants, bars, and several food and beverage peddlers. Extension is currently underway to extend the boulevard for another kilometer reaching the seaport of Galas making it a total of 2.6 kilometers. When completed, it is expected to contribute in the expansion of commercial activities and protection of coastal areas of the city against large sea waves during typhoon periods.|$|E

Some of the characteristics of <b>future-proof</b> products that come out of this study include a timeless nature, high durability, aesthetic appearances that capture and hold the interest of buyers.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the concept of}} ‘future-proofing’ the energy design of housing developments so as to achieve low-levels of energy consumption and carbon emissions over their lifecycle. This refers particularly to the selection of fabric energy efficiency measures and on-site low- or zero-carbon technologies (microgeneration or local energy networks) at an early design stage. The research adopts a multiple case study method with data gathered from two ‘best-practice’ housing developments in the UK and Sweden; namely, North West Cambridge (Cambridgeshire) and Välle Broar (Växjö). The research explores the <b>future-proofed</b> approaches used in the two cases {{in relation to a}} pre-established conceptual framework, which involves two aspects; namely; adopting lifecycle thinking and accommodating risks and uncertainties. The cross-case analysis reveals that there is widespread experimentation, which demonstrates that <b>future-proofing</b> is still in its infancy. Drivers for <b>future-proofing</b> mostly prompt strategies to accommodate risks and uncertainties in the UK; whereas in Sweden they lead to the adoption of lifecycle thinking. This is due to unique context-specific governance and institutional factors at both national (country) and local (case study) levels. The chapter concludes with the need to transfer knowledge to mainstream housing construction and inform policy-making in relation to long-term performance over a project’s full lifecycle...|$|R
