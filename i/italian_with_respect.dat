40|$|The {{position}} of wh-items {{is one of}} the most striking features of the syntax of sign languages (SLs). In contrast to spoken languages, where wh-words are generally found either clauseinitially or in situ, SLs allow wh-signs in situ, in clause-final position (preferred for many SLs), or repeated in two different positions of the clause. Moreover, in many cases all these options coexist in the same language (and even within a single signer). Several proposals in the theoretical literature showed how grammars are able to generate such constructions; however, none of the proposals addresses the issue of what factors determine the choice of these options. We present corpus evidence showing that both linguistic and social factors constrain the distribution of wh-signs in LIS (Lingua dei Segni Italiana, Italian Sign Language). The result of multivariate analysis suggests that LIS is undergoing a grammatical change and becoming less like spoken <b>Italian</b> <b>with</b> <b>respect</b> to the {{position of}} wh-signs...|$|E

Lastly, this result could also be due to a selection process of the groups, which may differ by country.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{characteristics}} of unaccusative verbs in <b>Italian</b> <b>with</b> <b>respect</b> to the consistency with which these verbs select the auxiliaries ‘be’ (essere) and ‘have’ (avere) in compound tense forms. The study builds on the gradient approach to split intransitivity (Sorace 2000) by exploring the behaviour of 29 intransitive Italian verbs {{with respect to their}} core-peripheral features: auxiliary selection acceptability ratings and associated variance measures. Although there is clear support for the gradient approach in relation to the general order of semantic categories along the unaccusativity gradient, the results reveal that the ordering of subclasses within the Change group conflict with that currently proposed in the literature. In addition, the findings demonstrate the aspectual and lexical semantic characteristics of internally-caused change-of-state verbs in Italian require further investigation before their auxiliary selection behaviour can be properly understood. Furthermore, contrary to the gradient account, Existence verbs, the most stative and therefore the most peripheral subclass in the unaccusativity hierarchy, exhibit behaviour more characteristic of core unaccusative verbs. This study examines a wider range of semantic subclasses of unaccusative verbs than has hitherto been reported and identifies the core-peripheral boundary for Italian. ...|$|E

The following issues are considered: Current mobility patterns of <b>Italians</b> <b>with</b> <b>respect</b> to walking and motorised transport; state-of-the-Art pedestrian measures; legal and regulatory aspects and citizens' role; accident trends in Italy; the national plan for road safety; pilot pedestrian safety projects in Genoa and Bologna, and schools and road safety strategies for children. The Pilot Projects, even if just started, represent an important step toward the increase of awareness to safety problems, at national level. They are also important because they demonstrate how relevant is the synergy between public administrators and end-users, also the less representative ones, as children and teenagers are normally considered. However, it is important to underline that both projects are aimed at giving autonomy not only to children, but to all the involved areas dwellers, so to create really livable conditions for all. Indeed, habits of aged people will be positively affected from these interventions, too. Participation in both cases has been and will be a key element for the success of these two experiences and it represents the efforts by the administrations to ensure equity in the processes about mobility governance. Both projects will be soon fully operative, according to different priorities: for what concerns Genoa, implementations will start from those districts where safety situations have been considered worse. In Bologna, on the contrary, first positive outcomes from the Pilot Project area are pushing the local Municipality to implement such a test in other districts of the city.

More specifically, since in Italian the post-nominal position of adjectives is more salient than the English pre-nominal position, this might have consequences on the period of their emergence and development in child speech. Moreover, the fact that Italian has overt adjectival morphological markers, although shared with nouns and therefore non-salient per se, may favour a selective attention on the adjectives as object properties. Namely, homogeneous morphological units might facilitate the children in relating the adjective to the noun (provided the noun is already familiar to the children) ...|$|R
