SUMMARY In this diploma thesis I {{have focused}} on the topic of the <b>Commercial</b> <b>Register</b> and other topics related to the <b>Commercial</b> <b>Register.</b> The <b>Commercial</b> <b>Register</b> is {{possible}} to describe as a public register in which certain data about certain persons is recorded in the accordance with the Czech law. The <b>Commercial</b> <b>Register</b> is regulated mainly in the Commercial Code and in the Civil Procedure Code. The main function of the <b>Commercial</b> <b>register</b> is to provide some basic facts about every person (entrepreneur) recorded into the <b>Commercial</b> <b>Register.</b> Another important function is to protect every third person acting in good faith regarding the facts entered in the <b>Commercial</b> <b>Register.</b> Every person can inspect the register and ask for a printout for every recorded person. This principle written above is so-called principle of formal publicity of the <b>Commercial</b> <b>Register.</b> All the records in the <b>Commercial</b> <b>Register</b> are legally effective on everyone from the day of their performance by the Register Court (so-called positive aspect of the principle of material publicity). In the case a third person acts in confidence of the entry in the <b>Commercial</b> <b>Register,</b> a recorded person can not rely {{on the fact that the}} entry does not corresponds with the real fact [...] ...|$|R

An {{introduction}} chapter is being followed by a chapter describing {{the historical development of}} the pledge over a share in a private company limited by shares and the securing ownership transfer on the current territory of the Czech Republic.
