60|$|Little they dreamed, as {{they rode}} down by Ditton Green, off the heathy commons, past the poor, {{scattered}} farms, on to the vast rushy meadows, while upon them was the dull weight of disappointment, shame, all but despair; their race enslaved, their country a prey to strangers, and all its future, like their own, a lurid blank,--little they dreamed of what that vale would be within eight hundred years,--the eye of England, {{and it may be}} of the world; a spot which owns more wealth and peace, more art and civilization, more beauty and more virtue, it may be, than any of God's gardens which make fair this earth. Windsor, on its crowned steep, was to them but a new hunting palace of the old miracle-monger Edward, who had just ruined England. Runnymede, a mile below them down the broad stream, was but a horse-fen <b>fringed</b> with <b>water-lilies,</b> where the men of Wessex had met of old to counsel, and to bring the country to this pass. And as they crossed, by ford or ferry-boat, the shallows of old Windsor, whither they had been tending all along, and struck into the moorlands of Wessex itself, they were as men going into an unknown wilderness: behind them ruin, and before them unknown danger.|$|R
50|$|Around {{the open}} water, and {{in parts of}} the ditch that are silting-up, a tall fen {{vegetation}} occurs. A wide variety of species occur, including water horsetail, Equisetum fluviatile, celery-leaved crowfoot, Ranunculus sceleratus, sharp-flowered rush, Juncus acutiflorus, and great pond sedge, Carex riparia. Great spearwort, Ranunculus lingua, a rarity in north-east England, is still found, but a number of other uncommon species have been lost in recent years, among them narrow-leaved water-parsnip, Berula erecta, water dropwort, Oenanthe fistulosa, and <b>fringed</b> <b>water-lily,</b> Nymphoides peltata.|$|E
50|$|The large pond is {{populated}} with spiked water-milfoil (Myriophylium spicatum), Canadian waterweed (Elodea canadensis), yellow-flowered <b>fringed</b> <b>water-lily</b> (Nymphoides peltata), and beds of bulrush (Typha latifolia), common reed (Phragmites australis), sea club-rush (Scirpus maritimus) and grey club-rush (Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani). The pond provides a habitat and {{breeding ground for}} a variety of waterfowl such as the mute swan, tufted duck, coot and dabchick. Other avians species nesting at the pond include gadwall, water rail, reed warbler, sedge warbler, reed bunting and other passerines. The three smaller ponds are more shallow - one sufficiently so to dry up in times of low rainfall. They host rushes (Juncaceae) and bulrush, water mint (Mentha aquatica), false fox-sedge (Carex otrubae), great willowherb (Epilobium hirsutum), common fleabane (Pulicaria dysenterica), gipsywort (Lyccous europaeus), branched bur-reed (Sparganium erectum), common marsh-bedstraw (Galium palusrre), and water-plantain (Alisma plantago-aquatica). Two species, parsley water-dropwort (Oenanthe lachenalii) and sea club-rush indicate brackish water.|$|E
