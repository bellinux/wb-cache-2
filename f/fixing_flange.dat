40|$|The hose of {{the oxygen}} lancing {{equipment}} in LD shop # 2 has failed at the weld-bellows interface by reverse bending fatigue. The bending stresses were resulted due to inclined fitment of the hose at the <b>fixed</b> <b>flange</b> end. No metallurgical abnormalities or weld defects or mechanical damages {{were responsible for}} the fatigue crack initiation. It is recommended that if inclined fitment of the hose is not a process requirement, the original design be restored to realize the expected life of the component. On the other hand, if inclined fitment cannot be avoided, additional support may be provided for the hose at the <b>fixed</b> <b>flange</b> end to avoid reverse bending at the weld-bellows interface. A detailed analysis of the failure is presented in this report...|$|R
50|$|Heavy {{vehicles}} and some trucks {{may have a}} removable multi-piece rim assembly consisting of a base that mounts to the wheel and axle. They then have either a side ring or a side and lock ring combination. These parts are removable from one side for tire mounting, while the opposite side attached to the base has a <b>fixed</b> <b>flange.</b>|$|R
50|$|The axial {{expansion}} joint absorbs movement in an axial direction. Standard connectors of the {{axial expansion}} joint are welded ends, <b>fixed</b> <b>flanges</b> and loose flanges. Axial expansion joints are often equipped with a guiding tube {{on the inside of}} the metal bellows. This reduces the flow resistance and prevents damage caused by direct contact with the flowing medium. Axial expansion joints, which can absorb large movements, frequently consist of two metal bellows and an inside or outside sleeve that protects against buckling under internal pressure. For small nominal diameters, protective tubes prevent mechanical damage during installation and operation. Axial expansion joints are suitable for internal and external overpressure. If pressure is applied to the outside of the metal bellows of {{axial expansion joint}}s, the expansion joints permit very large axial movements in case of internal pressure in a pipeline. Because there is no danger of buckling when an external overpressure is applied, the creator of the metal expansion joint was by a professor called Joshua Yap.|$|R
50|$|For the Retaining Ring connection, {{a groove}} will be {{machined}} onto the pipe end {{to hold the}} retaining ring. The retaining ring is made of a segmented stainless steel ring covered by a steainless steel spring and is used to <b>fix</b> the <b>flange.</b> For the assembly, the retaining ring flange has to be put onto the machined pipe end. The retaining ring has to be widened for getting it on the pipe end to snap into the before machined groove. The inside contour of the retaining ring flange will cover the retaining ring from the outside.|$|R

Such sophisticated requirements can be completed only {{by means of a}} mechatronic or robotic system. To solve these problems we have created a robotic system consisting of a 6 -DOF industrial robot with a high-speed camera <b>fixed</b> on the <b>flange.</b> In order to ensure precise timing and repeatability of the shooting we have developed a synchronization device and a number of custom automatic dispensers.

40|$|We {{present the}} first micromachined {{double-sided}} contactless WR 03 pin-flange adapter for 220 - 325 GHz based on gap waveguide technology. The pin-flange adapter {{is used to}} avoid leakage at the interface of two waveguides even when a gap between them is present and can be fitted onto any standard WR 03 waveguide flange. Tolerance measurements were performed with gaps ranging from 30 - 100 mu m. The performance of the micromachined pin flange {{has been compared to}} a milled pin flange, a choke flange and to standard waveguide connections. The micromachined pin flange is shown to have better performance than the standard connection and similar performance to the milled pin flange and choke flange. The benefits of micromachining over milling are the possibility to mass produce pin flanges and the better accuracy in the 2 D design. Measurements were performed with and without screws <b>fixing</b> the <b>flanges.</b> The flanges have also been applied to measure two devices, a straight rectangular waveguide of 1. 01 inch and a ridge gap resonator. In all cases, the micromachined pin flange performed flawlessly while the standard flange experienced significant losses at already small gaps...|$|R
50|$|The powered {{rotary hoe}} {{was invented by}} Arthur Clifford Howard who, in 1912, began experimenting with rotary tillage on his father's farm at Gilgandra, New South Wales, Australia. Initially using his father's steam tractor engine as a power source, he found that ground could be {{mechanically}} tilled without soil-packing occurring, {{as was the case}} with normal ploughing. His earliest designs threw the tilled soil sideways, until he improved his invention by designing an L-shaped blade mounted on widely spaced <b>flanges</b> <b>fixed</b> to a small-diameter rotor. With fellow apprentice Everard McCleary, he established a company to make his machine, but plans were interrupted by World War I. In 1919 Howard returned to Australia and resumed his design work, patenting a design with 5 rotary hoe cultivator blades and an internal combustion engine in 1920.|$|R
5000|$|The most {{historic}} - 76 & 276 Series (Amal 'Standard' series) can be spigot or <b>flange</b> <b>fixing</b> with adjustment screws on {{the left}} or right hand sides of the carburetter body. The available bore sizes are 15/16", 1" [...] and 1 1/16" [...] diameters. The 276 type carburettor is, in virtually all aspects, identical to the 76 version, except that the main emulsion air is drawn from inside the air intake (air filter) whilst the 76 carburettor uses unfiltered air. The 76 types are of die-cast zinc construction and were introduced in the early 1930s, replacing the earlier 6 series, which were of bronze construction, although basically the same design. The 276 type was introduced in 1940 in an attempt to improve the carburettor's durability in dusty and dirty operating environments.|$|R
5000|$|The Leica Standard was {{introduced}} {{as a basic}} model by Ernst Leitz, Wetzlar in October 1932. The camera was in production {{at the same time}} as the Leica II and Leica III models that have coupled rangefinders; the latter also has the faster speed of 1/1000 sec. It has a standardised lens mount with distance from film plane to lens <b>flange</b> <b>fixed</b> to 28.8 mm, a Leitz standard. This feature was first seen on late Leica I model C cameras in 1931, and all Leica II, Model D from 1932, identified by a [...] "0" [...] (zero) stamped on the lens mount flange at the top, to indicate the implementation of the standard, a practice that was continued for some time. It is found on early Leica Standards as well. On the back of these models there is a hole covered by a black plug, presumably for back focus calibration. The original lens for the Leica Standard when introduced was the Leitz Elmar 1:3,5 F=50mm in a collapsible nickel-plated focusing mount with infinity catch.|$|R
40|$|Smart adaptronic Elements for Active Vibration ControlThe induced {{vibrations}} of the high-precision machine {{limit the}} achievable required accuracy, such that constrain the performance {{improvement of the}} machine specifications. The main goal {{in the design of}} high precision machines is to enhance the accuracy while increasing productivity. These two design parameters are negatively coupled, as increasing the machine dynamics leads to more induced vibrations, especially with light structure machines. The induced vibrations will limit both the productivity and the accuracy of the machine. Within the scope of this thesis the main motivated question was Could we improve the performance parameters like: precision, accuracy, productivity, and process stability; by design and produce smart adaptronic modules that will be integrated in a modular way within the high precision machines?, This main question has been split to three main tasks (motivated questions to be answered) during the different research activities: 1. When to use active vibration compensation adaptronic modules? 2. How to design the active vibration compensation adaptronic modules? And, 3. How to use the active adaptronic modules? The development of such adaptronic elements is not an easy task, as it requires an extensive knowledge for a number of different scientific fields, which will be discussed at the beginning, followed by a suggested design methodology to develop the adaptronic element. This design methodology is a series of integrated mechatronic concurrent design processes, which will be applied through the different chapters of this thesis. This design approach consists of three main concurrent design phases:· Identification of the adaptronic design problem. · Integrated design of the adaptronic elements within the mechatronic system. · Adaptronic concept validation. As a real practical applications for the different research activities in this thesis, two prototypes of developed adaptronic modules for active vibration compensation will be presented, namely the active 3 DOF stiffness element A 3 DSE (patent no. WO 2011 / 041858 A 2), and the adaptronic smart platform (European project HARCO (FP 7 - 2010 -NMP-ICT-FoF). The first prototype A 3 DSE module is ideally suited for implementing active vibration compensation in the mechanical structure of machine elements, especially struts, that are subjected to axial or/and bending disturbances. According to the used controller strategy, the A 3 DSE is an adaptronic device for active disturbance-rejection and active vibration-damping applications. The design idea of the A 3 DSE is based on the incorporation of three piezoelectric displacement actuators, each equipped with a collocated piezoelectric force sensor, which are assembled in an axisymmetrical configuration within a mechanical holding structure, using suitable mechanical and electronic interfaces. The second module is the adaptronic platform, which has been designed as an adaptronic modular interface between the spindle housing and the machine frame of high-precision milling machine FIDIA DL 155, to compensate the vibrations of the cutting tool, to improve the workpiece final surface quality and to reduce the lead time. The working principle is similar to the A 3 DSE, and is based on the incorporation of three powerful high voltage piezoelectric displacement actuators, each equipped with a collocated, piezoelectric force sensor in preloaded units, which are distributed in axisymmetrical configuration to connect the movable and the <b>fixed</b> <b>flanges</b> of milling machines spindle. The two developed prototypes will be experimentally tested, using suitable developed test benches, besides testing the first prototype of the adaptronic smart platform on the real high precision milling machine FIDIA DL 155. Active feedback control technique will be implemented in simple straightforward way to present it as an industrial product in the future work. For the A 3 DSE; the results proved the capability of compensating the axial and bending vibration of the active struts where the A 3 DSE module is integrated in. The dimension and maximum stroke of the used piezoelectric actuators represent the most important factors which determine the range of the compensated vibrations. The adaptronic smart platform module has been tested within developed test bench; the used control strategy depends on two different types of possible feedback measured signal. Firstly, using the collocated force feedback signals from the piezoelectric force sensors integrated in the actuating unit with the three piezoelectric actuators. Secondly, using the acceleration feedback signals from three accelerometers collocated with the three actuating units. The experimental results revealed that the two tilting modes could be successfully damped, and the stiffness at the low frequency range has been improved. The first prototype of the adaptronic smart platform has been mounted on the real FIDIA DL 155 high precision milling machine at the workshop of FIDIA s. p. a., San Mauro Torinese, Italy. The preliminary test results succeeded to compensate the tool-tip vibrations over a wide range of rotating speeds, up to 60 % tool tip vibration suppression. For future work, this research {{is considered to be a}} road map covers the full path from identification to controller synthesis and validation, where provided an integrated mechatronic design approach for adaptronic modules. This integrated approach includes: the identification of the adaptronic design problem, the integration of the adaptronic modules within the mechatronic system, and the adaptronic concept validation. It is general methodology which is suitable to apply for different adaptronic modules depend on the case study. status: publishe...|$|R
