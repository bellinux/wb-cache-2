500|$|In October 2006, Holden {{introduced}} a bi-fuel {{version of the}} Alloytec V6, available to the Omega and Berlina.

Holden was {{able to take advantage of}} a loophole in government legislation, allowing an A$2,000 rebate on LPG installation because the unit is fitted post-production by Holden's customisation arm HSVi. Normally, people would only be entitled to a A$1,000 rebate for new cars pre-installed with LPG. Due to the possibility that these bi-fuel Commodores may have been fitted with undersized O-rings in the service valve hand tap, Holden issued a recall affecting the first 981 of these models on 10 April 2007. There were also two VE recalls previous to this. The initial 16 October 2006 recall affecting 1,521 V8 Commodore and WM Statesman/Caprice models involved a faulty fuel hose, causing a fuel smell to enter the cabin. A second 10 November 2006 recall affecting 12,830 Commodores and WM models built prior to 11 September 2006 resulted from defective rear seat belt anchors. On 7 December 2007, another recall was issued for over 86,000 VE and WM V6 models. This was due to the possibility that one of the fuel lines in the engine compartment may have a rub condition with a <b>fuel</b> <b>vapour</b> hose clip, possibly causing a fuel smell to become evident.|$|E

40|$|The {{transient}} behaviour {{of the fuel}} spray from an air assisted fuel injector has been investigated both numerically and experimentally in a Constant Volume Chamber (CVC) and an optical engine. This two phase injector is difficult to analyse numerically and experimentally because of the strong coupling between the gas and liquid phases. The gas driven atomization of liquid fuel involves liquid film formation, separation and break up and also liquid droplet coalescence, break up, splashing, bouncing, evaporation and collision. Furthermore, the liquid phase is the dominant phase in many regions within the injector. Experimental results are obtained by using Mie scattering, Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) and Laser Sheet Drop sizing (LSD) techniques. Computational results are obtained by using a mixed Lagrangian/Eulerian approach in a commercial Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) code. Injector rig results show a good atomization of the spray with low spray width and penetration and Sauter Mean Diameters SMD) of droplets of order 10 μm.

50|$|Meanwhile, the ZIM {{navigation}} company Europe Lines {{were approached}} {{to help in}} providing fuel, once the boats had left Cherbourg. Assistance was provided by Edmond Wilhelm Brillant, a retired navy officer and a naval architect. He designated MV Lea to provide fuel at Gibraltar and MV Nahariya as a backup in the Bay of Biscay (both general cargo ships that were available at that time). The main difficulty {{at this stage of}} the plan was the conversion of MV Lea into a fuelling ship carrying 200,000 litres of light diesel fuel. This was solved by conversion of the ballast tank in the ship's bow and bottom into a fuel tank. The pump system was converted to operate as both a fire fighting and fueling pump. Special high pressure hoses were used and a fueling drill was developed prior sailing to the rendezvous point near Gibraltar. According to international maritime regulations, MV Lea could not sail since safety regulations banned ships from carrying fuel in the bow as <b>fuel</b> <b>vapour</b> may cause an explosion. This issue was solved by Brillant with the aid of Kirstine shipyards and a Lloyd's Register surveyor. Additionally, a special filter was needed to make sure no dirt from tanks would contaminate the boat's tanks and engines. This filter was improvised by Brillant. It was capable of fuelling five boats, but only two at a time were fueled at the ship's stern. The overall conversion and drill took twelve hours. Other Zim divisions provided the Dan, a Ro-Ro ship sister of MV Nili which would provide fuel near Lampedusa. Captain of MV Dan was Yosef Dror, a retired Navy officer (Commander) and Shayetet 13 commando frogman. In this case, tanker trailers were loaded in the ship's garage. These Zim ships sailed with additional crew made up of members of the Israeli Navy.|$|E

40|$|From the {{preliminary}} {{results of the}} motor scooter post-crash firing case, first presented at the ICEFA IV in Cambridge (UK) in June 2010, new technical investigations have been performed clarifying the reasons behind the unusual crash-firing accident. As stated in the first presentation, this particular scooter model has a unique frame-gas tank system. Specifically the fuel tank is ‘protected’ inside a type of half-duplex cradle frame (fig. 1). When subjected to a front collision impact with a rigid ‘barrier’ (i. e. the rear wheel of an automobile - fig. 2), at impact {{the frame of the}} motor scooter can, under certain situations, cause the fuel tank collapse. This phenomena occurred in both real cases examined: when the fuel tank collapsed, <b>fuel</b> and <b>fuel</b> <b>vapours</b> sprayed onto the two drivers arms and legs and caught on fire causing severe burning of their clothing and, consequently, their skin. Based on {{the preliminary}} conclusions on the accident reconstruction, additional tests were conducted. The objective was to further understand what contributing causes produced the tank failure and result in the projection of fuel, as had occurred in the two acknowledged cases. The potentiality of such an event occurring again had to be evaluated. A devised crash test campaign was performed to reproduce the conditions of the accident. The tests revealed that when the rear section of the scooter frame collapsed, the compression exerted by the reduction of volume resulted in the fuel spilling out of the tank. The system design of frame plus tank adopted by the manufacturer was shown not to be a safe enough solution to prevent these types of accidents from happening again. While the statistics for this type of accident may be low, the high probability of injuries from this type of accident should be carefully evaluated from a forensic point of view...|$|R

Moreover, fuel distribution and oxidation were studied as well. Liquid <b>fuel</b> and <b>vapour</b> phase, injected around the top dead centre, were analysed.

40|$|Abstract. A {{numerical}} study {{based on}} VOF {{model has been}} carried out to investigate the dynamics of water droplet impact on solid surface in microgravity in comparison with that in normal gravity to discuss the differences of the extinguishing mechanism of water mist in different gravity level. Water droplets with different initial diameters and impact velocities were considered. The simulated results show that the deformation process in microgravity lags behind that in normal gravity. And it was also found that Dmax and spread velocities are smaller in microgravity as the potential energy decreases and the time taken for a liquid droplet to reach its maximum spread has no obvious regularity. Hence, the effect of cooling the fuel surface and diluting <b>fuel</b> <b>vapour</b> with water mist in microgravity may be not as good as that in normal gravity. The critical impact Weber number for water droplet breaking up in microgravity is lower than that in normal gravity as the reduction of the value of Bond number, which may result in diluting <b>fuel</b> <b>vapour</b> with water mist in microgravity being more effective than that in normal gravity in some case...|$|E

One problem is developing materials that can mitigate an event of interplanetary spacecraft fire. A numerical simulation of piloted ignition delay time of solid fuel material for PMMA sample, subjected to various incident radiant heat fluxes and airflows was developed based on thermo-chemical solid phase model. The model incorporates, conduction, convection, surface re-radiation and radiation surface absorption heat transfer modes and solid phase chemical degradation described by first order Arrhenius law chemistry.

40|$|A new {{mechanism}} for the generation of a self-exited oscillation of combustion in a generic combustion chamber typical for aero-engine combustors is described. The cause of the oscillation is the phase change from liquid to vapour which happens when the preheat temperature of the air flowing through the burner exceeds the boiling temperature at the operating pressure and the fuel flow is so low that heat transfer to the liquid fuel causes evaporation within the fuel channels of the burner. Liquid <b>fuel</b> and <b>vapour</b> alternatively enter the airstream of the burner. This leads to an instable situation for the flame. Measurements of chemiluminescence and liquid fuel show nearly complete extinction and reignition for the limit cycle. Prevention of the oscillation is possible by better thermal management on the fuel path...|$|R
