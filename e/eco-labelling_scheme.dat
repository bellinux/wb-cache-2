40|$|Air travel plays a {{vital role}} in today's life because it makes remote {{destinations}} accessible and short getaways possible. Despite its benefits, air transportation contributes heavily to climate change. Behavioral change is seen as a key driver in mitigating the environmental impacts of air travel. One way to encourage behavioral change is to use eco-labels. This study explores how an eco-label could be developed for the airline industry to function as a potential driver for behavioral change. 12 interviews with airline industry experts were conducted and thematically analyzed. Empirical results were then combined with prior research and the following five criteria essential for the development of an airline eco-label were identified: credibility, comparability, clarity, transparency and participation. Out of these five criteria, participation seemed to be the most challenging to realize. Based on these criteria, this paper could be understood as a first step towards the introduction of an industry-wide <b>eco-labelling</b> <b>scheme</b> for the airline industry that could help reduce the environmental impacts of aviation through behavioral change...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{analyze the}} trade and welfare effects of {{eco-labels}} in a domestic market with one domestic firm and one foreign firm. Pollution is production related, and the government can choose between including the product category in an <b>eco-label</b> <b>scheme</b> and setting an environmental standard. The environmental standard will only apply to the domestic firm, while both firms can adopt the eco-label. Given that the environmental damage is not too large, we find that it is optimal {{for the government to}} introduce an <b>eco-label</b> <b>scheme.</b> An <b>eco-label</b> <b>scheme</b> is optimal even though the domestic firm may loose profit and the foreign firm may gain. Hence, the <b>eco-label</b> <b>scheme</b> is not introduced for protectionist purposes. Further, if the government for some reason were prevented from using eco-labels, global, domestic and foreign welfare would be hampered.

We analyse {{the gap between the}} academic design of <b>eco-labelling</b> <b>schemes</b> and their real implementation. We contend that providing information is not enough. We then use recent advances in behavioural economics to inform policy makers on the potential of behavioural interventions in order to design better <b>eco-labelling</b> <b>schemes.</b> Policy relevance Many public policies, including <b>eco-labelling</b> <b>schemes,</b> are still based on an inaccurate description of human decision making, mainly borrowed from standard economics.

Departing from the conventional view that information-based policies such as <b>eco-labelling</b> <b>schemes</b> will quasi-automatically help mitigate issues such as climate change by guiding consumers' and firms decisions, we argue that information provision is necessary but not sufficient. Admitting that consumers' decisions are guided by factors other than price and information, and, taking systematically into account be-havioural biases can offer to policy makers low-cost levers with first-order effects in order to increase the environmental per-formance of eco-labels, or at least decrease the likelihood of counterproductive effects...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} {{sustainability}} {{in the construction}} industry is very prominent, as the industry often causes adverse impacts on the environment through its use of large amounts of natural resources and by clearing large areas of their natural habitats. After the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro proposed the use of eco-labels to attain sustainable development, the growth and use of <b>eco-labelling</b> <b>schemes</b> have increased significantly. This study focuses on <b>eco-labelling</b> <b>schemes,</b> particularly the Singapore Green Labelling Scheme (SGLS) and the Singapore Green Building Product Certification Scheme (SGBPCS), and their contributions to the Singapore construction industry. The effectiveness of the schemes and of their drivers is determined through the analysis of survey results from two groups of samples (suppliers and architects) and interviews with some of the key stakeholders involved. It can be observed that the both the supplier and architect groups have some knowledge and awareness of <b>eco-labelling</b> <b>schemes</b> in the Singapore context. However, in terms of implementation, both schemes are only moderately effective in advocating the use and production of eco-labelled building products. It was also found that, out of several factors, "environmental rating" appears to be the only one that significantly influences the decision to use <b>eco-labelled</b> <b>schemes.</b> Furthermore, the results show that SGBPCS was not as heavily promoted in the architect group as in the supplier group. The architects perceived the SGBC advertisements to be less convincing than did the suppliers, and therefore they considered the SGBC's measures to promote the use of eco-labelled materials to be less effective. From the empirical results, strategies and measures are proposed for industry stakeholders to enhance the effectiveness of the <b>eco-labelling</b> <b>schemes</b> {{in the construction industry}}...|$|R
40|$|Eco-labels {{and ethical}} labels are {{instruments}} used in national product-related {{environmental and social}} policies. Germany was the first country to introduce an <b>eco-labelling</b> <b>scheme,</b> called "Blue Angel", in 1978. Since then, eco-labelling programs have been developed in many other countries of the world. National eco-labelling programs are new instruments covered by policy research studies. After outlining the aims and effects of environmental and ethical labels this study goes on to analyse potential negative impacts of eco-labels for foreign producers {{in the context of}} the world trade treaty and its free trade obligations. A review of the world-wide dissemination (diffusion patterns) of eco-labels and policy-learning processes identifies how policy innovations spread from one country to another. But there is cause to inquire into environmental-policy competence as a precondition for successful implementation. Three case studies are made of the German, European and Indian eco-labelling programs. The key message obtained from this evaluation of the perspectives of eco-labels for environmentally and socially acceptable products: The globalisation of economic, environmental and social policies will lead to a greater dissemination of policy instruments such as eco-labels. However, especially in developing economies that are under high pressure to become competitive on the world market, the introduction of new policy instruments is far too rapid, and does not reflect the need to first improve overall environmental policy competence...|$|E
40|$|This PhD {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} links between foreign direct investment (FDI), pollution and environmental policies in an interdependent world. To tackle the issue of spatial dependence, I propose to apply new spatial estimators. The thesis consists of four papers. The first chapter, entitled Spatial Dynamic Panel and System GMM: a Monte-Carlo Investigation, investigates the finite sample properties of estimators for spatial dynamic panel models {{in the presence of}} several endogenous variables. I show that in order to account for the endogeneity of several covariates and get unbiased estimates, you should apply the system generalized moments method (GMM) estimator instead of traditional spatial dynamic estimators. From a practical point of view, system GMM is computationally less demanding and easier to adapt to unbalanced panel data. In the second paper, Pollution Havens: a Spatial Vector Autoregression Approach (VAR), I investigate the mutual relationship between FDI, pollution and trade openness for 141 countries during the nineties. After applying second generation panel unit root tests, I estimate a trivariate spatial VAR model where a shock occurring in a given country can potentially affect the economic conditions in the neighboring countries. Based on generalized empirical likelihood estimations, the results highlight a reverse causality between FDI and pollution emission, suggesting the existence of a potential endogenous pollution haven effect to low income countries in particular. In addition, spatial spillovers {{play a key role in}} the linkage between FDI, trade openness and SO 2 emission and highlight the strategic nature of these variables. Multilateral and regional cooperation between developed, emerging and developing countries should be extended to capitalize on these spillovers, address potential issues and seize new opportunities. In line with the previous study, in the third paper, entitled Complex FDI and Environmental Regulation: the Role of Spatial Dependence, I investigate if differences in environmental regulations influenced OECD’s FDI allocation during 1981 - 2000 taking into account “third-country” effects in a multi-country setting. The findings, based on system GMM estimates of a spatial dynamic gravity model, confirm the existence of a negative relationship between FDI and environmental stringency, once I correct for endogeneity and spatial dependence. In addition, the evidence of positive “third-country” effects for FDI suggests the prevalence of highly complex vertically integrated FDI from OECD countries to developing economies. Multinationals tend to allocate each part of the production process in different countries to ensure cost minimization. Emerging and developing countries, which might be tempted to use environmental regulation as an instrument to attract FDI, will only attract the most polluting part of the production process. This is not the best way to ensure sustainable economic growth, at least on the long run. In the last chapter called Unequal Diffusion of Eco-labels: a Spatial Econometric Approach, I analyze the decision to introduce an <b>eco-labelling</b> <b>scheme</b> through a heteroskedastic Bayesian spatial probit. This framework allows the government’s decision to introduce an eco-label program to be influenced by the decision of the neighboring countries. I propose to estimate this model by implementing a new algorithm with higher mixing and converge. Based on a sample, including 141 developing and developed economies, I show that the probability for a country to introduce an <b>eco-labelling</b> <b>scheme</b> depends on the eco-label programs adopted by countries which are spatially close or sharing a strong trade intensity relationship with each other. These results explain why developing countries, which are standards takers, have naturally been put at a disadvantage in terms of eco-labelling adoption. Therefore, eco-label programs should be as transparent as possible and rely on standard harmonization and mutual recognition to remove any potential technical trade barriers and encourage the participation of developing countries...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2011. A global {{increase}} in environmental awareness and concern about {{issues such as}} climate change, resource depletion {{and higher levels of}} pollution are having a greater influence on the purchasing decisions and product selection of consumers. In a response to this trend and growing demand for eco-friendly products, manufacturers introduced goods suggested to have a less harmful impact on the environment. A growing number of environmental logos and unsupported claims caused consumer scepticism and created a need for certified environmental logos, which led to the introduction of eco-labels. To date, South Africa does not have a certified eco-label in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) non-food category. The application of eco-labels on products would allow South African consumers to identify eco-friendly options and incentivise producers to develop goods that are less harmful to the environment. In order to establish the requirements for a successful <b>eco-labelling</b> <b>scheme,</b> a literature review was conducted. Based on the findings, a consumer survey was carried out to determine whether there is a demand for eco-labelled goods in South Africa and whether an eco-labelling project will {{have a significant effect on}} consumer behaviour in the FMCG non-food category. Statistical analysis of the data revealed that consumers are concerned about the environment and that they will support eco-friendly goods, if the quality and performance are as good as regular products. The survey, however, revealed that consumers are of the opinion that eco-friendly products are not as effective as regular products. The analysis also found that consumers are price sensitive and not willing to pay a large premium for eco-friendly attributes. These are the two main obstacles hindering South African consumers to move to more sustainable consumption patterns. In the survey, consumers also indicated a need for an independent third party to verify environmental claims, manage eco-labels and audit producers to ensure that eco-friendly goods meet acceptable sustainability and quality standards...|$|E
40|$|The growing {{popularity}} of national efforts to promote eco-labeling raises important questions. In particular, developing countries fear that the eco-label can deliberately impose the environmental concern of (high income) importing countries on their production methods. Yet, empirical studies of the adoption of <b>eco-labelling</b> <b>schemes</b> at the cross-country level are scarce {{due to the lack}} of data availability. In this paper, the decision to introduce an eco-label is analyzed through a heteroskedastic Bayesian spatial probit, which allows the government’s decision to introduce an eco-label to be influenced by the behaviour of the neighbouring countries. The estimation is performed by extending the joint updating approach proposed by Holmes & Held (2006) to a spatial framework. Empirical evidence highlights the importance of a high stage of development, innovation experience and potential scale effects in the implementation of an <b>eco-label</b> <b>scheme.</b> In addition, results confirm the existence of a strategic interdependence in the eco-label decision. ...|$|R

The Rio Earth Summit (1992) was a milestone for these initiatives, having introduced the concept of sustainable development, its major principles and recommendations of implementation. So, the ecological movement grew globally more and more by widely disseminated actions among various bodies as the governments, associations, businesses, academics, NGOs and communities. In European Union <b>eco-labelling</b> <b>scheme,</b> is a voluntary initiative to promote products and services which {{have the potential to}} reduce negative environmental impacts, as compared to the other products and services in the same product or service group, thus contributing to the efficient use of resources and a high level of environmental protection. This shall be pursued through the provision of guidance and accurate, non-deceptive and scientifically based information to consumers on such products and services. In fact this is official approach known as EU-Ecolabel Scheme, launched in 2005. In general, the idea of sustainable development, and eco-attitude of many of the activities carried out in different economic sectors have been encouraged to be certified, and to adopt sustainable practices to improve their environmental practices, and to inform and educate their clients regarding their friendly-environmental policies. The tourism sector adopted all of these. One by one in hospitality industry have emerged new trends, new destinations. Some of these trends are as well connected to environmental policy, eco-initiatives that certify EMS (Environmental Management System) and to use of eco-label in hospitality industry. For years, the tourism sector in Romania was declared a strategic sector. Within this framework, we decided to examine this area, the specific topic of eco-labelling and quality of lodging services in Romania. This paper proposes a short examination by observation of studies dedicated to lodging eco-label services and their quality based on a comparative analysis between Romanian supply of tourism 'green services' and international one. This study has as a result a synthetic perspective on eco-label services and some aspects on the state of art of this topic in Romanian and international context of lodging services...|$|E
40|$|As SMEs {{transformation}} {{to sustainable}} practices in manufacturing, processing and services, is declared {{to be the}} key to a green growth model, the research in this thesis aims to understand in what way eco-labelling can be a part of that. In order to approach this complex issue, the thesis aims to identify the greening potential and the limits of contemporary eco-labelling schemes for SME product within the German coffee-processing sector. With regard to that, the thesis applied the policy evaluation method "Program Theory Evaluation" (PTE), which assesses a policy in place and thus provides information how the introduction and the function of eco-labelling schemes is observed and perceived by German coffee-processing SMEs (GCPS). Hence, based on a policy evaluation from a rational perspective, which has the focus on the policy’s problem-solving process and implementation cycle, the thesis reveals how eco-labelling schemes’ underlying theoretical greening strategy act in practice to German coffee-processing SME (GCPS). Thereby it could be evaluated that eco-labelling schemes imply shortcomings to address and green GCPS high quality coffee products. As the PTE-method aims also on optimizing the policy’s rationalisation, the inappropriate or failed implementation of eco-labelling schemes by GCPS has been further explored. To grasp the eco-labelling schemes extent of limits to green GCPS products, the thesis compares and analyses the policy evaluation results against the backdrop of eco-labelling schemes’ normative theoretical policy conception and in the light of "Environmental Authority of Political Consumerism (Ecological Modernisation Theory) ". With regard to that, the thesis fosters a policy learning process and uncovers that <b>eco-labelling</b> <b>scheme</b> eco-labelling schemes potential to green GCPS products is limited and conditioned to this a lower level of sustainable value as they are focused to supply mainly the demand for mainstream coffee products. Hence, the thesis concludes {{that it is not the}} underlying rationality of eco-labelling schemes, namely being a consumer-oriented and market-based policy instrument that does not apply to green GCPS products. However, this opens up a new perspective as it points out a sustainable quality gap between products using eco-labelling schemes and non-labelled GCPS high quality products. In return this raises considerations in terms of improving eco-labelling schemes’ contribution to sustainable development. Thus the thesis argues to optimize their rationalization with regard to GCPS high quality products as frontrunners of tomorrow’s sustainability...|$|E

This thesis presents a case study of a Nephrops trawl fishery. Despite being a bottom trawl fishery, it has been certified as sustainable and well managed by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), a leading wild capture fisheries certification programme for sustainable seafood. In addition this thesis presents an overview of seafood <b>eco-labelling</b> <b>schemes</b> and discusses how bycatch data obtained through a partnership between science and industry can inform fisheries management. The research on the fished ecosystem comprised an analysis of random sub-samples received from the fleet of certified trawlers. This involved evaluating a self-assessment scheme that was initially implemented to provide additional bycatch data across the whole fleet. Analysis showed that the scheme could produce robust results, conditional on {{the quantity and quality of}} the sub-samples collected by the fishermen being maintained at specified levels. Biological processing of the sub-samples also allowed the establishment of an extensive database, quantitatively detailing the amount of bycatch typically produced by a Nephrops trawl vessel in the region. Overall, the bycatch represented 37 % of the whole catch by weight, with low catch rates of two sensitive species, Atlantic cod and Spurdog being recorded. The results from analyses of these sub-samples compare well with those from previous studies on this fishery in which the entire catch had been analysed. Similarity of the catch compositions found in the sub-samples also suggests a high degree of uniformity in the fishing process across this fleet. Two small studies on spurdog survivability and on fishing gear interactions with the sea pen Funiculina quadrangularis provided biological information relevant to satisfying the conditions of certification. This case study highlights how the MSC approach can be an effective tool for fisheries management and has the potential to generate more benefits than current non-participatory legislation...|$|R

Findings from this study may provide knowledge about predictors of environmentally responsible consumption behavior. Such research may guide environmental labeling efforts to reduce environmental burdens of consumption. In this study consumers differentially endorsed ecolabel criteria. Further, differential importance was significant for gender, ethnicity, and income. Research is needed to explore the relationships between respondent demographics and eco-label criteria importance. It is necessary to consider importance of criteria to consumers. Without consumer interest, <b>eco-labeling</b> <b>schemes</b> are doomed to fail. Thus, {{it is recommended that}} ecolabeling schemes consider the importance of eco-label criteria, particularly, criteria related to social welfare.

40|$|Developments in {{fisheries}} {{governance in}} recent decades—notably the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and its implementing agreements—have established a framework o fprinciples, standards, institutions {{and regulations that}} is broade rand more complex than traditional fisheries management, which has generally focused o nindividual target species. As this framework has evolved, a number of seafood <b>eco-labelling</b> <b>schemes</b> have also developed. These schemes aim to identify well- managed fisheries and give competitive advantage to their products, thus translating the environmental awareness of consumers into direct support for sustainable fishing practices. This paper evaluates {{a number of these}} schemes in the context of international fisheries governance principles and considers the conservation benefits that may result from sustainability certification of Pacific tuna fisheries. The paper briefly summarises developments in eco-labeling of Pacific tuna fisheries in relation to the evolution of fisheries management, where focus has shifted from the maximum sustainable yield of individual tuna species to ecosystem-based approaches that directly consider the broader environmental impacts of fishing. The paper discusses two different ‘Dolphin Safe’ <b>eco-labels,</b> the third-party <b>scheme</b> of the Earth Island Institute and the intergovernmental scheme of the Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Program, and two broader eco-labels offering sustainability certification of fisheries, ‘Friend of the Sea’ and the ‘Marine Stewardship Council’. The role played by seafood-industry associations with sustainability claims, such as the International Seafood Sustainability Foundation, is also considered...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} goal of fisheries management {{is to ensure}} that fish stocks are harvested at sustainable levels of fishing pressure. However, the classical maximum sustainable yield theory and its derivatives have not worked for fisheries management. A number of mitigating measures have been suggested of which eco -labeling is one. An ecolabel on a fish product is a distinctive mark or statement indicating that it has been harvested in compliance with preset sustainability standards. This paper examines eco labeling in fisheries as the new strategy to achieve fisheries conservation and sustainability. It emphasizes the importance of fish as critical food resources and new approach to fisheries management through the use of certification programs. It considers the benefits and problems that may accrue from eco-certification of fish harvesting and trade practices in fisheries. This paper, attention is focused on examining the likely option for development of <b>eco-labeling</b> <b>scheme</b> in Nigeria. The paper concludes that the increase awareness amongst stakeholders of the potential role of eco-labeling in conservation and sustainability tools should be established.   Keywords: Fisheries management, fish, conservation, eco-certificatio...|$|R
40|$|Annually, it is {{estimated}} that about 4 billion units of consumer electronics for mobile communications are produced worldwide. This could lead to various ecological imbalances unless the design and disposal of the products are handled optimally. To illustrate how industry looks at and responds to the increasing social awareness, this article describes how sustainability is successfully implemented in practice at a large Chinese company, developing and producing various kinds of electronic products used for communication. It also describes how a variety of eco-innovations and business models contribute to reducing the environmental impact; for example, through increased recovery and recycling. A new kind of eco-design procedure is presented along with a new methodology which shows how a mobile phone gradually becomes more sustainable {{from one generation to the}} next. The issues with and set-up of new <b>eco-labeling</b> <b>schemes</b> for mobile phones, eco-rating, is described in detail. The conclusion is that due to high competition between companies, the industry acts resourcefully and a lot is done to the save the ecological environment...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{literature}} survey of some relevant issues arising from environmental quality provision and <b>eco-labelling</b> <b>schemes.</b> First of {{all it is}} shown how the two topics are strictly related. Firms adopting a production process (or producing a good) more environmentally friendly than others (environmental quality provision aspect) may {{want to make it}} public (eco-labelling aspect). The survey addresses the question of optimal environmental quality provision (also as a policy tool) and firms compliance. With regard to eco-labelling, its impacts on market structure are analysed. From the empirical evidence it can be concluded that information plays a crucial role both for consumers’ and producers’ decisions. Consumers are willing to pay a higher price to be informed about the greenness of a good, and a label can really be a determinant in their choice of which brand to purchase. On the supply side, disclosing information about the environmental performance of a firm can affect investment decisions and its stock value. environmental quality, eco-labellng, consumer, producers, International Economic Relations, Economics, Environment...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of Community {{policy on the}} environment and business is to contribute to sustainable development. The EU <b>eco-label</b> <b>scheme</b> (as laid down in the new Regulation (EC) No 1980 / 2000) is now part of a wider approach on Integrated Product Policy (IPP) within the new Action Programme. The Commission has published a Green Paper on IPP that will be a key innovative element of future environmental policy and sustainable consumption and production. Strategically, the European ecolabel Scheme is, and will be, in line with the principles, goals and priorities of the 6 th action Programme "Our Future, Our Choice". Following the Rio Summit in 1992, preparations by the EU on the {{overall objective}}s of sustainable development are underway as the year 2002 will be the year of RIO+ 10. 2002 will also see the 10 th anniversary of the Flower label.

40|$|Eco-labels are {{suspected}} to serve protectionist purposes. We analyze {{the choice between}} an environmental standard and a voluntary <b>eco-label</b> <b>scheme</b> in a partial trade model with one domestic firm and one foreign firm. The environmental standard will only apply to the domestic firm, while both firms can adopt the eco-label. Pollution is production related, and domestic consumers demand products that are produced in an “environmentally friendly” way. Our results show {{that it may be}} optimal for the domestic government to introduce an eco-label and get both firms to adopt the label, instead of setting an environmental standard. However, to what extent this policy serves protectionist purposes is ambiguous. In particular, if the willingness to pay for green products is sufficient to cover the pollution abatement costs of the foreign firm, foreign firm profit will increase while domestic firm profit will decrease compared to the outcome with a domestic environmental standard. On the other hand, if the willingness to pay for green products is insufficient, the foreign firm would be better off with a domestic environmental standard.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the green {{marketing}} which incorporates a broad range of activities such as the product modification, changes to the production process, packaging changes, as well as modifying advertising of the environment friendly commodities. Sustainable forest management is the ways and processes of managing forest resources to meet society’s varied needs, today and tomorrow, without compromising the ecological capacity and the renewal potential of the forest resource base. Both the producers and the customers must be conscious about the products whether these are really following <b>eco-labeling</b> <b>schemes.</b> The green economy is not only to produce clean energy but also technologies of cleaner production processes which reduce environmental impact or improve natural resource use. The green chemistry involves designing and using chemical products and processes with the aim of eliminating or reducing their negative impact on human health and the environment which encompasses education, research, and commercial application across the entire supply chain for chemicals. The paper also suggests enhancing the practice of green marketing of products of the company which are presumed to be environmentally safe for the sustainability in the 21 st century. ...|$|R
