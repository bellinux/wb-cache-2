Due to a {{resemblance}} with the women Génessier has kidnapped, she <b>is</b> <b>informed</b> <b>by</b> Parot that the charges against her will be dropped if she checks into Génessier's clinic. She is subsequently released and kidnapped to have her face transplanted, but is saved by Christiane before Génessier is able to perform surgery on her.|$|E
5|$|His mysticism <b>is</b> <b>informed</b> <b>by</b> the {{influences}} of Böhme and Franckenberg {{as well as of}} prominent writers Meister Eckhart (1260–1327), Johannes Tauler (–1361), Heinrich Suso (–1366), and Jan van Ruysbroeck (1293/4–1381). Critic and literary theorist Georg Ellinger surmised in his study of Silesius that his poetry was influenced by loneliness (especially due to the death of his parents and becoming an orphan early in life), ungoverned impulsivity, and lack of personal fulfillment, rendering much of his poetry confessional and exhibiting internal psychological conflict.|$|E

5|$|Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark {{consists}} of twenty-five letters that address an extensive range of contentious political topics, such as prison reform, land rights, and divorce laws, {{as well as}} less controversial subjects, such as gardening, salt works, and sublime vistas. Wollstonecraft's political commentary extends the ideas she had presented in An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution (1794); her discussion of prison reform, for example, <b>is</b> <b>informed</b> <b>by</b> her own experiences in revolutionary France and those of her friends, {{many of whom were}} jailed.|$|E

After he begins hallucinating about Haywire, Mahone accepts heroin from T-Bag to calm himself.|$|E
5|$|Through {{the work}} of {{classical}} writers such as Plutarch, knowledge of the Osiris myth was preserved even after {{the middle of the}} first millennium AD, when Egyptian religion ceased to exist and knowledge of the writing systems that were originally used to record the myth were lost.

In modern times, when understanding of Egyptian beliefs <b>is</b> <b>informed</b> <b>by</b> the original Egyptian sources, the story continues to influence and inspire new ideas, from works of fiction to scholarly speculation and new religious movements.|$|E

The orders are synthesized by the on-board central computer EOS, which also records and relays the player's flight and battle record data back to Hyperion. After {{completion of the}} last objective, the player <b>is</b> <b>informed</b> <b>by</b> Hyperion that the battle pattern of the latest EOS unmanned fighter has been completed {{according to the data}} from their battle record. The player is given the honor of being the target of the last EOS test as reward for their heroic efforts and that upon the player's death, they shall advance two classes and be awarded the Sirius decoration. After surviving the intense barrage of artillery fire of the EOS test, the pilot wonders why they must be terminated by their ally and questions their military leaders' rationale for the war.|$|E
5|$|At {{a border}} {{post on the}} way to Paraguay, Cacambo and Candide speak to the commandant, who turns out to be Cunégonde's unnamed brother. He {{explains}} that after his family was slaughtered, the Jesuits' preparation for his burial revived him, and he has since joined the order. When Candide proclaims he intends to marry Cunégonde, her brother attacks him, and Candide runs him through with his rapier. After lamenting all the people (mainly priests) he has killed, he and Cacambo flee. In their flight, Candide and Cacambo come across two naked women being chased and bitten by a pair of monkeys. Candide, seeking to protect the women, shoots and kills the monkeys, but <b>is</b> <b>informed</b> <b>by</b> Cacambo that the monkeys and women were probably lovers.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) <b>is</b> <b>informed</b> <b>by</b> Don Geiss's (Rip Torn) estate lawyer Thomas (Burke Moses) {{that he is}} in Don Geiss's will. Jack is excited at the idea of owning a piece of Geiss's legacy as Jack {{considered}} Geiss his mentor. At the will reading, Jack inherits Geiss's beloved pet peacock named Argus. When Argus begins acting peculiar, Jack enlists the help of NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer). Kenneth—who knows all the peafowl calls—tells Jack that Argus muttered senpai and kōhai—master and pupil—nicknames that Geiss and Jack had for each other (a ruse conceived by Liz, who knew of the nicknames). Immediately, Jack is convinced that Geiss's soul has inhabited Argus, prompting Jack to release his grief to Argus and finally accepting Geiss's death.|$|E
40|$|This {{project is}} a {{creative}} exploration of the physical and aesthetic properties inherent in painting, sculpture and architecture as applied to model animation. The project focuses {{on a number of}} areas such as the sculptural quality of model animation, the lighting of model animation, the cinematography for animation, the frame by frame nature of animation, model animation environments and alternative methods for creating animation sequences. A range of art forms have been investigated with respect to these themes. The sculptural nature of model animation has <b>been</b> <b>informed</b> <b>by</b> a study of the sculpture of Donatello, Rodin and Brancusi. The analysis of the lighting of model animation has <b>been</b> <b>informed</b> <b>by</b> a study of, amongst other things, baroque painting and Byzantine mosaics. The frame by frame nature of animation has <b>been</b> <b>informed</b> <b>by</b> a study of the painting techniques of Impressionism, Post Impressionism and Futurism. The research into cinematography for model animation has <b>been</b> <b>informed</b> <b>by</b> a study of, amongst other things, the use of ‘point of view’ in Renaissance painters such as Mantegna. The research into methods for creating animation sequences has <b>been</b> <b>informed</b> <b>by</b> an analysis of the use of axis and circles in architecture. As a result the project has not analysed in detail current animation practice...|$|R

5|$|Eusebius' {{understanding}} of the Arab peoples <b>is</b> <b>informed</b> <b>by</b> his reading of the Bible and {{his knowledge of the}} history of imperial Rome. He {{does not appear to have}} personally known any Arabs. In his Chronicon, all the Arabs that appear—save for one reference to Ishmael—figure in the political history of the first three centuries of the Christian era. To Eusebius, the Saracens of the 4th century are direct-line descendants of the biblical Ishmaelites, descendants of the handmaid, Hagar, and the patriarch, Abraham. They are thus outcasts, beyond God's Covenant with the favored son of Abraham, Isaac. The twin images of the Ishmaelite and the Saracen—outcasts and latrones, raiders of the frontiers—reinforce each other and give Eusebius' portrait of the Arab nation an unhappy color. He may have been reluctant to associate the first Christian emperor with a people of such unfortunate ancestry.|$|E
5|$|It is {{revealed}} that Mahone was being blackmailed by Paul Kellerman (Paul Adelstein), a Secret Service agent {{forced to work}} for the Company. Kellerman threatens to reveal that Mahone killed Shales, and forces him to kill all the escapees in exchange for his silence. Although hesitant, Mahone agrees when an operative of the Company, Agent Kim (Reggie Lee), threatens to murder his family. Mahone continues his hunt for the remaining six escapees but is betrayed and shot by Kellerman, who transfers his allegiance to the brothers. He survives and decides to stop chasing the escapees, but is forced to resume his search when his son is injured in a car accident orchestrated by one of Kim's agents. Before returning to work, he murders the agent who arranged the accident. Mahone returns to his FBI field office, where he <b>is</b> <b>informed</b> <b>by</b> Agent Wheeler (Jason Davis) that Internal Affairs is investigating him.|$|E
5|$|Offitt's {{membership}} has tired of endless talk, and plans a general strike, {{a fact of}} which Farnham <b>is</b> <b>informed</b> <b>by</b> Mr. Temple, a salty-talking vice president of a rolling mill. An element among the strikers also plans to loot houses along Algonquin Avenue, including Farnham's. The strike begins, paralyzing Buffland's commerce, though it is initially nonviolent. Neither the mayor nor the chief of police, when approached by Farnham, are willing to guard Algonquin Avenue. Farnham proceeds to organize Civil War veterans, and purchases weapons to arm them. After Farnham's force rescues the mayor from being attacked, he deputizes them as special police—on condition there is no expense to the city.|$|E

5|$|Picard and an away team {{board the}} Stargazer, and he orders a chest of his {{belongings}} {{to be sent}} to the Enterprise. Hidden in the chest is an orb, which glows brighter as Bok activates it, causing Picard to be hit by a wave of pain. Dr. Crusher orders him back to the Enterprise. Data meanwhile finds a discrepancy in the Stargazers logs stating that the Ferengi were attacked under a flag of truce. Upon further investigation, Data and La Forge report to Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) that the logs were certainly faked. Dr. Crusher and Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) discuss the Captain, and Wesley shows them some unusual activity from the Ferengi ship. They head to inform Riker to alert him to the signals, who <b>is</b> <b>informed</b> <b>by</b> the Enterprise computer that Picard has transported to the Stargazer.|$|E

She reviews all of her options with the doctor in-charge of Shepherd's case, before signing the papers to authorize the removal of his life support. Blake tearfully apologizes to a forbearing Grey, who then returns to his hospital room to say a final goodbye to Shepherd. This is accompanied by a montage of the happy moments from their relationship.|$|E

5|$|The art {{historian}} Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson posits that the painting <b>is</b> <b>informed</b> <b>by</b> the progressive style of French realists such as Rosa Bonheur and Gustave Courbet. She concedes {{that there is}} no documentary evidence to suggest Predić was influenced by Courbet's depictions of peasant life, but notes that the latter's work was in the public domain at the time Happy Brothers was created and was quite popular throughout Europe. Filipovitch-Robinson believes that Predić rejected the precision and linearism of both Academic and Biedermeier art, and, as Courbet would have done, used heavily textured brushstrokes to define the roughness of the muddy road. She also draws parallels between the painting and Courbet's Peasants of Flagey, which was shown at the Paris Salon of 1850–51 alongside The Stone Breakers and A Burial At Ornans.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{tells the}} arrival of Merlin (Colin Morgan) {{as a young man}} in Camelot, where magic is banned by King Uther Pendragon (Anthony Head). Taken under the wing of Camelot's physician, Gaius (Richard Wilson), he is warned that he must keep his innate magical ability a secret. In Camelot, he meets Uther's heir, the arrogant Prince Arthur (Bradley James), as well as Lady Morgana (Katie McGrath) and her handmaid, Guinevere (Angel Coulby). As a witch (Eve Myles) plans revenge on the King's heir for the {{execution}} of her son, Merlin <b>is</b> <b>informed</b> <b>by</b> a cryptic dragon (John Hurt) that his destiny is to protect Arthur.|$|E
5|$|These dismal {{business}} efforts—and his misadventures in Sardinia—provided {{an appropriate}} milieu {{in which to}} set the two-volume Illusions perdues (Lost Illusions, 1843). The novel concerns Lucien de Rubempré, a young poet {{trying to make a}} name for himself, who becomes trapped in the morass of society's darkest contradictions. Lucien's journalistic work <b>is</b> <b>informed</b> <b>by</b> Balzac's own failed ventures in the field. Splendeurs et misères des courtisanes (The Harlot High and Low, 1847) continues Lucien's story. He is trapped by the Abbé Herrera (Vautrin) in a convoluted and disastrous plan to regain social status. The book undergoes a massive temporal rift; the first part (of four) covers a span of six years, while the final two sections focus on just three days.|$|E
