500|$|Talking to Nashville Scene, Lewis {{said that}} the songs [...] "weren't written off-the-cuff, but they were {{definitely}} recorded, not carelessly, but with a real effort to capture a live feeling, particularly with the vocals". Lewis continued, [...] "To me, it's a big step in a different direction...and {{to be able to}} sink into the vocal take while the band was playing was a very liberating experience for me." [...] Lewis told The A.V. Club, [...] "We played them on the road 100 times, so we <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could walk into the studio and record them the same way. [...] It wasn't really a studio record, but more of a live record in some ways. It was about getting the band together and creating an atmosphere that lent itself to good chemistry between the band members and trying to capture as much of the record live as we could." [...] As [...] "a child of digital generation", Lewis had generally worked with Pro Tools, but wanted to capture the [...] "not-perfect sound" [...] of some of her favorite records.|$|E

500|$|To {{achieve a}} tone and quality {{that was true}} to the story as well as {{reflected}} {{the period in which}} it is set, Spielberg once again collaborated with cinematographer Janusz Kamiński, saying, [...] "Early on, we both <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> did not want this to look like a Technicolor extravaganza about World War II, but more like color newsreel footage from the 1940s, which is very desaturated and low-tech." [...] Kamiński had the protective coating stripped from the camera lenses, making them closer to those used in the 1940s. He explains that [...] "without the protective coating, the light goes in and starts bouncing around, which makes it slightly more diffused and a bit softer without being out of focus." [...] The cinematographer completed the overall effect by putting the negative through bleach bypass, a process that reduces brightness and color saturation. The shutter timing was set to 90 or 45 degrees for many of the battle sequences, as opposed to the standard of 180-degree timing. Kamiński clarifies, [...] "In this way, we attained a certain staccato in the actors' movements and a certain crispness in the explosions, which makes them slightly more realistic." ...|$|E
500|$|On 25 June 1967, the Beatles {{performed}} their forthcoming single, [...] "All You Need Is Love", to {{an estimated}} 350 million viewers on Our World, the first live global television link. Released a week later, during the Summer of Love, the song was adopted as a flower power anthem. Two months later, the group suffered a loss that threw their career into turmoil. Having been introduced to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi only the previous night in London, on 25 August they travelled to Bangor for his Transcendental Meditation retreat. Two days later, their manager's assistant, Peter Brown, phoned to inform them that Epstein, only thirty-two years old, had died. The coroner ruled the death an accidental carbitol overdose, although it was widely rumoured to be a suicide. Epstein {{had been in a}} fragile emotional state, stressed by personal issues. His death left the group disoriented and fearful about the future. Lennon recalled: [...] "We collapsed. I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were in trouble then. I didn't really have any misconceptions about our ability to do anything other than play music, and I was scared. I thought, 'We've had it now.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The band {{released}} Deja Entendu through Razor & Tie/Triple Crown Records in June 2003, being {{issued in}} Europe and Australia in October 2003. The album's title, Deja Entendu, is French for [...] "already heard." [...] It was explained as [...] "very tongue-in-cheek" [...] by vocalist Jesse Lacey. Elaborating on the title's meaning, he told MTV, [...] "No {{matter who you}} are or what your band is about, you can't put a record out without people saying it's derivative of something else. So by saying the record's already been heard, it's kind of like saying, 'Yeah, you're right. We're doing something that's already been done before.'" [...] He reinforced, [...] "We're not trying to break new ground in music. We're {{just trying to make}} good music." [...] The album was described as a [...] "stylistic leap" [...] from Your Favorite Weapon, with a [...] "decidedly matured" [...] sound. In an interview with Billboard, Lacey said that although Deja Entendu does offer a different sound, the album [...] "doesn't seem like we're departing from anything, really. I think we always <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had a lot of potential and there's a lot of different stuff we were able to do, and a lot of different sounds we wanted to make.

500|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} {{supposed to have}} been shot on film, though a last-minute change by the studio helped introduce a different technology. In 1997, during pre-production on Henry Selick's feature, Monkeybone, the film's cinematographer Pete Kozachik was looking for a type of filming that would streamline the process of integrating stop-motion characters with pre-filmed live actors. After finishing Monkeybone, Kozachik continued to test cameras for a practical means of shooting feature animation digitally. In early 2003, the production unit was not interested in digital capture for stop motion; the team was instead prepping the movie for a film shoot. Two weeks before filming was to begin, Kozachik and visual effects consultant Chris Watts came up with a solution using digital still cameras that was deemed viable by Warner Bros. senior vice president of physical production and visual effects Chris DeFaria. The production then became digital. After testing a dozen different models, Kozachik opted for a basic digital still camera, the Canon EOS-1D Mark II, an off-the-shelf model that was outfitted with adapters to allow the use of Nikon prime lenses (14mm-105mm). Kozachik spoke about why he chose the camera, saying: [...] "One reason I went with this particular camera is that its image chip is just about the same size as Super 35 film negative, so we could use Nikon lenses and treat them like regular 35mm cine lenses and get the same effect—the same depth of field and angle of coverage. I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were going to be fighting to make this look like a 'real' movie because we weren't shooting on film, so I wanted to at least have the optics look like movie optics." ...|$|E

With Return to Base we were really pleased with the album, we thought that it turned out really well, but it didn't sell. Everyone around the band was saying to us that we weren't coming up with as good songs as we used to, but me and Jim <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were, we <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were coming up with strong songs. Some of the songs on Return to Base we thought were some of the best songs that we'd ever written. There only seemed to be me and Jim that had confidence in the songs; people like Chas, Dave and Don said that they didn't think our songs were as strong, some of them they did but some of them they didn't. But we ourselves thought that they were. Thus it was a case of getting the album down; and in our minds it turned out to be a great album." ...|$|E

2500|$|In another Verhoeven film—the erotic thriller Basic Instinct (1992)— {{she took}} on the role that made her a star, playing Catherine Tramell, a brilliant, bisexual, alleged serial killer. Several actresses at the time turned down the role, mostly because of the nudity required. In the film's most notorious scene, Tramell is being {{questioned}} by the police, and she crosses and uncrosses her legs, exposing her vulva, which is not covered by underwear. According to Stone, she agreed to film the flashing scene with no underwear, and although she and Verhoeven had discussed the scene {{from the beginning of}} production, she was unaware just how explicit the infamous shot would be: [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were going to do this leg-crossing thing and I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were going to allude to the concept that I was nude, but I did not think that you would see my vagina in the scene. Later, when I saw it in the screening I was shocked. I think seeing it {{in a room full of}} strangers was so disrespectful and so shocking, so I went into the booth and slapped him and left". Stone claimed in an earlier interview, however, that [...] "it was so fun" [...] watching the film for the first time with strangers. Verhoeven has denied all claims of trickery and said, [...] "As much as I love her, I hate her, too, especially after the lies she told the press about the shot between her legs, which was a straight lie". Screenwriter Joe Eszterhas, who later befriended the actress, also claimed in his memoir, Hollywood Animal, that the actress was fully aware of the level of nudity involved.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2004 Daymond told WHAMMO.com.au [...] "I think [...] <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{were looking}} to do {{something}} a little different.

In an interview for Rolling Stone in May 2011, Thornton told music journalist, Andrew McMillen, that the band's manager at the time [...] "couldn’t be fucked fighting the label for anything that we wanted, and he'd made the decision that we were just going to go with whatever the label reckoned.

I’d been off at Harvard for a while and Brandon was really focusing on painting and for a little while there we didn’t have all that much communication.

[...] "So we <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> didn't want to start doing the Bully sequel instantly at that second with those guys -- even though it is a property that, like Max, we adore and might come back to in the future.

2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1972, Englehart and writers Gerry Conway and Len Wein crafted a metafictional {{unofficial}} crossover spanning titles from both major comics companies. Each comic featured Englehart, Conway, and Wein, as well as Wein's first wife Glynis, interacting with Marvel or DC characters at the Rutland Halloween Parade in Rutland, Vermont. Beginning in Amazing Adventures #16 (by Englehart with art by Bob Brown and Frank McLaughlin), the story continued in Justice League of America #103 (by Wein, Dick Dillin and Dick Giordano), and concluded in Thor #207 (by Conway and penciler John Buscema). As Englehart explained in 2010, [...] "It certainly seemed like a radical concept and we <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had to be subtle (laughs) and each story had to stand on its own, but we really worked it out. It's really worthwhile to read those stories back to back to back — it didn't matter to us that one was at DC and two were at Marvel — I think it was us being creative, thinking what would be really cool to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|The small budget {{dictated}} much of {{the production}} process. According to Hardman, [...] "We <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could not raise enough money to shoot a film {{on a par with}} the classic horror films with which we had all grown up. The best that we could do was to place our cast in a remote spot and then bring the horror to be visited on them in that spot". Scenes were filmed near Evans City, Pennsylvania, [...] north of Pittsburgh in rural Butler County; the opening sequence was shot at the Evans City Cemetery on Franklin Road, south of the borough. The interior upstairs scenes were filmed in a downtown Evans City home that later became the offices of a prominent local physician and family doctor (Allsop). This home is still standing on South Washington St. (locally called Mars-Evans City Road), between the intersecting streets of South Jackson and Van Buren. The cemetery chapel was under warrant for demolition; however, Gary R. Steiner led a successful effort to raise $50,000 to restore the building, and the chapel is currently undergoing renovations.|$|E
