Lack of proper treatment of PCOS may also result in medical complications such as diabetes or heart disease. The rural clinic where this project took place {{did not have a}} mandatory guideline for treatment of PCOS; therefore, no standardized method of diagnosis or treatment of PCOS existed. The purpose of this project, guided by the IOWA evidence-based practice model, was to educate providers on the evidence-based guideline for diagnosis and treatment of PCOS outlined by the Endocrine Society Taskforce. The guideline was selected after a comprehensive literature review and was used to develop an educational program that was provided to 5 nurse practitioners, the medical director and staff. A pre-test post-test design was used to determine if the participants understood the content from the guideline that was presented. Results showed that the researcher-developed test administered to participants yielded scores of 74 on the pre-test and increased after the education program with all participants scoring 100 on the post-test. The guideline used for the education was then presented to the clinic for implementation {{with the assistance of the}} medical director 2 ̆ 7 s support. The project provided an evidence-based guideline for diagnosing and treating PCOS and raised awareness of PCOS among all staff in a rural clinic where many patients with PCOS are treated.

40|$|To {{demonstrate}} {{the flexibility of}} a cloud-based solution for analyzing disparate sets of next-generation sequencing data, we looked at carefully chosen samples across different populations from the 1, 000 Genomes Project (www. 1000 genomes. org) and conducted an extensive analysis on two Chinese populations, the “Chinese in Beijing” (CHB) and the “Chinese in metropolitan Denver” (CHD), each consisting of 28 exomes. Each dataset was uploaded into the system using raw data files acquired from the 1, 000 Genomes Project. Using these data and a cloud-based data analysis pipeline, we performed a nucleotide-level variant analysis combined with a population allele frequency analysis across all samples for the two populations. To identify alleles that are significantly different across the two populations, a Pearson's chi-square test was applied, {{which resulted in a}} total of 1. 5 Mio SNPs, of which 84 were non-synonymous with a p-value of less than 0. 01. Interestingly, the genes associated with non-synonymous variants of the Chinese in metropolitan Denver population were enriched for biological annotations such as <b>endocrine</b> <b>system</b> <b>disorder,</b> metabolic disease, cardiac fibrosis, and inflammation (includes ZNF 264, RPS 6 KA 2, ROBO 2, CRK, MUSK, CBL, CRK, and others).

Opium addiction has a positive association with <b>endocrine</b> <b>system</b> <b>disorders.</b> The relationship between adipokines and opium addiction is unclear. In the present study, we aimed to determine serum adiponectin and leptin levels in opium addicted subjects. Methods: 176 men, 88 opium addicts and 88 non-addicts were randomly selected from subjects who participated in Kerman Coronary Artery Disease Risk factors Study (KERCADRS); a population-based study. Serum adiponectin and leptin levels were measured using ELISA and compared between two groups. We adjusted the effect of some confounding factors such as the patients’ demographic, clinical and medical history in multivariate analysis model. Results: The serum level of adiponectin in opium addicts was significantly lower than control group (6. 5 ± 3. 6 vs. 9. 8 ± 8. 1 μg/ml, P< 0. 001). There was no significant difference in serum leptin level between two groups (11. 8 ± 10. 3 ng/ml in control group vs. 11. 5 ± 10. 8 ng/ml in opium addicts, p = 0. 80). In the multivariate analysis, after adjusting for age, cigarette smoking, body mass index, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cholesterol, triglyceride and high and low density lipoproteins, the negative association between opium addiction and decreased adiponectin level was still present (β = - 0. 144, P value = 0. 005). Conclusions: The results showed that opium addiction reduces serum adiponectin level. Since adiponectin has been shown to have anti-diabetic and anti-atherogenic effects, its reduction may account for increase in the risk of metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance and CVD amongst opium addicted patients...|$|R
50|$|The <b>endocrine</b> <b>system</b> is the {{collection}} of glands of an organism that secrete hormones directly into the circulatory system to be carried towards distant target organs. The phenomenon of biochemical processes' serving to regulate distant tissues by means of secretions directly into the circulatory <b>system</b> is called <b>endocrine</b> signaling. The major endocrine glands include the pineal gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, ovaries, testes, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, and adrenal glands. The <b>endocrine</b> <b>system</b> {{is in contrast to}} the exocrine system, which secretes its hormones to the outside of the body using ducts. The <b>endocrine</b> <b>system</b> is an information signal system like the nervous system, yet its effects and mechanism are classifiably different. The <b>endocrine</b> <b>system's</b> effects are slow to initiate, and prolonged in their response, lasting from a few hours up to weeks.

In vertebrates, the hypothalamus is the neural control center for all <b>endocrine</b> <b>systems.</b> The field of study dealing with the <b>endocrine</b> <b>system</b> and its <b>disorders</b> is endocrinology, a branch of internal medicine.Special features of endocrine glands are, in general, their ductless nature, their vascularity, and commonly the presence of intracellular vacuoles or granules that store their hormones.

40|$|The brain {{occupies}} a special hierarchical {{position in the}} organism. It is separated from the general circulation by the blood-brain barrier, has high energy consumption and a low energy storage capacity, uses only specific substrates, and it can record information from the peripheral organs and control them. Here we present a new paradigm for the regulation of energy supply within the organism. The brain gives priority to regulating its own adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration. In that postulate, the peripheral energy supply is only of secondary importance. The brain has two possibilities to ensure its energy supply: allocation or intake of nutrients. The term 'allocation' refers to the allocation of energy resources between the brain and the periphery. Neocortex and the limbic-hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (LHPA) system control the allocation and intake. In {{order to keep the}} energy concentrations constant, the following mechanisms are available to the brain: (1) high and low-affinity ATP-sensitive potassium channels measure the ATP concentration in neurons of the neocortex and generate a 'glutamate command' signal. This signal affects the brain ATP concentration by locally (via astrocytes) stimulating glucose uptake across the blood-brain barrier and by systemically (via the LHPA system) inhibiting glucose uptake into the muscular and adipose tissue. (2) High-affinity mineralocorticoid and low-affinity glucocorticoid receptors determine the state of balance, i. e. the setpoint, of the LHPA system. This setpoint can permanently and pathologically be displaced by extreme stress situations (chronic metabolic and psychological stress, traumatization, etc.), by starvation, exercise, infectious diseases, hormones, drugs, substances of abuse, or chemicals disrupting the <b>endocrine</b> <b>system.</b> <b>Disorders</b> in the 'energy on demand' process or the LHPA-system can influence the allocation of energy and in so doing alter the body mass of the organism. In summary, the presented model includes a newly discovered 'principle of balance' of how pairs of high and low-affinity receptors can originate setpoints in biological systems. In this 'Selfish Brain Theory', the neocortex and limbic system {{play a central role in}} the pathogenesis of diseases such as anorexia nervosa and obesity...|$|R

While the precise biological functions of sigma receptors have not been elucidated, recent work has {{shed some light on}} to these enigmatic systems. Sigma receptors have recently been a target of drug development related to psychiatric and neurological disorders. Sigma ligands have also been shown to modulate endothelial cell proliferation and can control angiogenesis which makes them a promising target for oncology applications. Other areas currently being investigated include treatment of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, <b>endocrine</b> and immune <b>system</b> <b>disorders.</b> Of interest is that the human sigma- 1 receptor gene contains a steroid binding component, and several gonadal steroids, including progesterone, testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), interact with sigma- 1 receptors.

Indeed, the infection is acquired early in life and induces an intense/moderate local and systemic inflammatory status that lasts for the entire patients’ life. During this time, different organs and systems of infected individuals are exposed to injures exerted by the inflammation and immune responses to the infection, as well as to autoimmune reactions triggered by mechanisms of antigenic mimicry between human tissue cells and H. pylori. The CagA-positive bacterial genotype is mostly involved in extradigestive manifestations of such an infection, due to the increased inflammatory potential of this organism.

Further, the skin has interactions with its own appendages and other organs such as the sebaceous glands and hair follicles, the kidney, and adrenal glands; systems such as the central nervous system; and axes such as the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. These continuous connections give the skin its versatility, and when an injury is caused, some triggers start a cascade of events designed to restore its integrity. Nowadays, {{it is known that}} this psychoneuroimmune–endocrine intercommunication modulates both the homeostatic condition and the healing process. In this sense, the skin conditions before a trauma, whether of endogenous (acne) or exogenous origin (injury or surgical incision), could regulate the process of tissue repair.

In the present study, a method was developed to profile a variety of vertebrate steroids and their conjugates in fish tissues using solid phase extraction (SPE) prior to ultraperformance liquid chromatography linked to electrospray-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-TOF MS). Analysis of tissue extracts spiked with steroids revealed that most analytes could be detected at subnanogram per gram concentrations in liver or testes, but ovarian extracts caused ion supression of estrogens. A comparison of the steroid metabolome of the ovaries and testes using partial least-squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) revealed that the androgens 11 -ketotestosterone, 11 -hydroxyandrostenedione, androstenedione, and two unidentified cortisol-type glucocorticoids were discriminatory steroid markers in testes extracts. In contrast, cortisol was the predominant glucocorticoid marker in ovary extracts, and cortisone was abundant in extracts of both testes and ovaries. A number of other unidentified nonsteroidal metabolites were also differentially expressed between the testes and ovarian tissues.
