5|$|Dopamine {{plays a role}} in pain {{processing}} {{in multiple}} levels of the central nervous system including the spinal cord, periaqueductal gray, thalamus, basal ganglia, and cingulate cortex. Decreased levels of dopamine have been associated with painful symptoms that frequently occur in Parkinson's disease. Abnormalities in dopaminergic neurotransmission also occur in several painful clinical conditions, including burning mouth syndrome, <b>fibromyalgia,</b> and restless legs syndrome.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, {{physicians}} thought low back pain was caused by inflammation of or damage to the nerves, with neuralgia and neuritis frequently mentioned by them in the medical literature of the time. The popularity of such proposed causes decreased during the 20th century. In the early 20th century, American neurosurgeon Harvey Williams Cushing increased the acceptance of surgical treatments for low back pain. In the 1920s and 1930s, new theories of the cause arose, with physicians proposing a combination of nervous system and psychological disorders such as nerve weakness (neurasthenia) and female hysteria. Muscular rheumatism (now called <b>fibromyalgia)</b> was also cited with increasing frequency.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of ways to {{classify}} low back pain with no consensus that any one method is best. There are three general types of low back pain by cause: mechanical back pain (including nonspecific musculoskeletal strains, herniated discs, compressed nerve roots, degenerative discs or joint disease, and broken vertebra), non-mechanical back pain (tumors, inflammatory conditions such as spondyloarthritis, and infections), and referred pain from internal organs (gallbladder disease, kidney stones, kidney infections, and aortic aneurysm, among others). Mechanical or musculoskeletal problems underlie most cases (around 90% or more), and of those, most (around 75%) do not have a specific cause identified, but are thought to be due to muscle strain or injury to ligaments. Rarely, complaints of low back pain result from systemic or psychological problems, such as <b>fibromyalgia</b> and somatoform disorders.|$|E
25|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} that major depression is associated with <b>fibromyalgia</b> (1999), although {{the nature of the}} association is debated. A comprehensive review into the relationship between <b>fibromyalgia</b> and major depressive disorder (MDD) found substantial similarities in neuroendocrine abnormalities, psychological characteristics, physical symptoms and treatments between <b>fibromyalgia</b> and MDD, but currently available findings do not support the assumption that MDD and <b>fibromyalgia</b> refer to the same underlying construct or can be seen as subsidiaries of one disease concept. Indeed, the sensation of pain has at least two dimensions: a sensory dimension which processes the magnitude and location of the pain, and an affective-motivational dimension which processes the unpleasantness. Accordingly, a study that employed functional magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate brain responses to experimental pain among people with <b>fibromyalgia</b> found that depressive symptoms were associated with the magnitude of clinically induced pain response specifically in areas of the brain that participate in affective pain processing, but not in areas involved in sensory processing which indicates that the amplification of the sensory dimension of pain in <b>fibromyalgia</b> occurs independently of mood or emotional processes. <b>Fibromyalgia</b> has also been linked with bipolar disorder, particularly the hypomania component.|$|E
25|$|People with <b>fibromyalgia</b> {{generally}} have higher {{health care costs}} and utilization rates. A study of almost 20,000 Humana members enrolled in Medicare Advantage and commercial plans compared costs and medical utilizations and found that people with <b>fibromyalgia</b> used twice as much pain-related medication as those without <b>fibromyalgia.</b> Furthermore, the use of medications and medical necessities increased markedly across many measures once diagnosis was made.|$|E
25|$|Although {{in itself}} neither {{degenerative}} nor fatal, the chronic pain of <b>fibromyalgia</b> is pervasive and persistent. Most people with <b>fibromyalgia</b> report that their symptoms do not improve over time. An evaluation of 332 consecutive new people with <b>fibromyalgia</b> found that disease-related {{factors such as}} pain and psychological factors such as work status, helplessness, education, and coping ability had an independent and significant relationship to FM symptom severity and function.|$|E
25|$|A mode of {{inheritance}} {{is currently}} unknown, {{but it is}} most probably polygenic. Research has also demonstrated that <b>fibromyalgia</b> is potentially associated with polymorphisms of genes in the serotoninergic, dopaminergic and catecholaminergic systems. However, these polymorphisms are not specific for <b>fibromyalgia</b> and {{are associated with a}} variety of allied disorders (e.g. chronic fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome) and with depression. Individuals with the 5-HT2A receptor 102T/C polymorphism {{have been found to be}} at increased risk of developing <b>fibromyalgia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Persons with <b>fibromyalgia</b> (FM, or <b>fibromyalgia</b> syndrome, FMS), {{like those}} with CFS, have muscle pain, severe fatigue and sleep disturbances. The {{presence}} of allodynia (abnormal pain responses to mild stimulation) and of extensive tender points in specific locations differentiates FM from CFS, {{although the two}} diseases often co-occur.|$|E
25|$|Very {{low quality}} {{evidence}} suggests quetiapine may {{be effective in}} <b>fibromyalgia.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Fibromyalgia</b> {{may not be}} {{diagnosed}} in up to 75% of affected people.|$|E
25|$|Other {{symptoms}} often {{attributed to}} <b>fibromyalgia</b> {{that may be}} due to a comorbid disorder include myofascial pain syndrome, also referred to as chronic myofascial pain, diffuse non-dermatomal paresthesias, functional bowel disturbances and irritable bowel syndrome, genitourinary symptoms and interstitial cystitis, dermatological disorders, headaches, myoclonic twitches, and symptomatic hypoglycemia. Although <b>fibromyalgia</b> is classified based on the presence of chronic widespread pain, pain may also be localized in areas such as the shoulders, neck, low back, hips, or other areas. Many sufferers also experience varying degrees of myofascial pain and have high rates of comorbid temporomandibular joint dysfunction. 20–30% of people with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus may also have <b>fibromyalgia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone {{has been}} {{assessed}} {{in a study}} {{for the treatment of}} <b>fibromyalgia</b> in women.|$|E
25|$|A 2007 review {{concluded}} that a period of nine months of growth hormone was required to reduce <b>fibromyalgia</b> symptoms and normalize IGF-1. A 2014 also found some evidence support its use. Sodium oxybate increases growth hormone production levels through increased slow-wave sleep patterns. However, this medication was not approved by the FDA for the indication for use in people with <b>fibromyalgia</b> due to the concern for abuse.|$|E
25|$|Non-celiac gluten {{sensitivity}} (NCGS) may be {{an underlying}} cause of <b>fibromyalgia</b> symptoms but further research is needed.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{regulators}} {{approved the}} drug {{for the treatment}} of <b>fibromyalgia</b> in June 2008.|$|E
25|$|No {{high quality}} {{evidence}} exists that suggests synthetic cannabinoids help with <b>fibromyalgia,</b> {{and in general}} tolerability is poor.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fibromyalgia</b> is {{a poorly}} {{understood}} pain condition. Lactulose breath testing {{has shown that}} patients with <b>fibromyalgia</b> have a more pronounced degree of abnormal results compared to both IBS patients and the general population. This study also demonstrated positive correlation {{between the amount of}} pain and the degree of abnormality on the breath test. A subsequent study also demonstrated increased prevalence of intestinal hyperpermeability, which some believe occurs commonly with SIBO.|$|E
25|$|During its {{development}} for <b>fibromyalgia,</b> milnacipran was evaluated utilizing a composite responder approach. To {{be considered as}} a responder for the composite ‘treatment of ﬁbromyalgia’ endpoint, each patient had to show concurrent and clinically meaningful improvements in pain, physical function and global impression of disease status. A systematic review in 2015 showed moderate relief for a minority of people with <b>fibromyalgia.</b> Milnacipran was associated with increased adverse events and discontinuing use of the drug.|$|E
25|$|The main uses of {{duloxetine}} are {{in major}} depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, neuropathic pain, chronic musculoskeletal pain, and <b>fibromyalgia.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} indicating that exercise improves fitness and sleep and may reduce pain and fatigue {{in some people}} with <b>fibromyalgia.</b> In particular, there is strong evidence that cardiovascular exercise is effective for some people. Strength training may also be beneficial. Long-term aquatic-based exercise {{has been proven beneficial}} as it combines cardiovascular exercise with resistance training. Further research is required to understand the long term benefits of exercise for people with <b>fibromyalgia.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Fibromyalgia</b> (FM) is {{a medical}} {{condition}} characterised by chronic widespread pain and a heightened pain response to pressure. Other symptoms include tiredness {{to a degree that}} normal activities are affected, sleep problems, and troubles with memory. Some people also report restless legs syndrome, bowel or bladder problems, numbness and tingling, and sensitivity to noise, lights or temperature. <b>Fibromyalgia</b> is frequently associated with depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Other types of chronic pain are also frequently present.|$|E
25|$|Duloxetine, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Cymbalta among others, is a {{medication}} mostly used for major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, <b>fibromyalgia</b> and neuropathic pain.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fibromyalgia</b> is {{estimated}} to affect 2–8% of the population. Female are affected about twice as often as male based on criteria as of 2014.|$|E
25|$|Two {{patients}} initially {{diagnosed with}} <b>fibromyalgia</b> were subsequently {{shown to have}} myotonia congenita. Both patients had been seen by rheumatologists and diagnosed with <b>fibromyalgia.</b> The diagnoses were revised when electromyographic studies revealed myotonic discharges {{in some of the}} muscles. Genetic analysis of the skeletal muscle chloride channel which is the underlying cause of myotonia congenita revealed that both patients had mutations in this gene. Over 130 mutations in this gene have been described and the phenotype is very variable which may account for the difficulty in the initial diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|The {{analgesic}} {{properties of}} duloxetine {{in the treatment}} of diabetic neuropathy and central pain syndromes such as <b>fibromyalgia</b> are believed to be due to sodium ion channel blockade.|$|E
25|$|The only common medical use for GHB {{today are}} in the {{treatment}} of narcolepsy and more rarely alcoholism. It is sometimes used off-label for the treatment of <b>fibromyalgia.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} of <b>fibromyalgia</b> can be difficult. Recommendations often include getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, and eating a healthy diet. Cognitive behavioral therapy {{may also be}} helpful. The medications duloxetine, milnacipran, or pregabalin may be used. Use of opioid pain medication is controversial with some stating their use is poorly supported by evidence and others saying that weak opioids may be reasonable if other medications are not effective. Dietary supplements also lack evidence to support their use. While <b>fibromyalgia</b> can last a long time, it does not result in death or tissue damage.|$|E
25|$|SNRIs are {{sometimes}} {{also used to}} treat anxiety disorders, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} (ADHD), chronic neuropathic pain, and <b>fibromyalgia</b> syndrome (FMS), and for the relief of menopausal symptoms.|$|E
25|$|The anti-convulsant drugs {{gabapentin}} and pregabalin {{may be used}} {{to reduce}} pain. Gabapentin may be of significant benefit for pain relief in about 35% of people with <b>fibromyalgia.</b> It is not possible to predict who will benefit, and a short trial may be recommended to test the effectiveness of this type of medication. Approximately 6/10 people who take gabapentin to treat pain related to <b>fibromyalgia</b> experience unpleasant side effects such as dizziness, abnormal walking, or swelling from fluid accumulation. Pregabalin demonstrates a substantial benefit in about 9% of people. Pregabalin reduced time off work by 0.2 days per week.|$|E
25|$|As of 2015 {{tramadol}} was {{not approved}} in the United States for <b>fibromyalgia.</b> Based on three small trials with weak study design, there is fair evidence for tramadol {{as a second}} line treatment.|$|E
25|$|Some {{authors have}} {{proposed}} that, because exposure to stressful conditions {{can alter the}} function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the development of <b>fibromyalgia</b> may stem from stress-induced disruption of the HPA axis.|$|E
25|$|Health Canada and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have {{approved}} pregabalin and duloxetine, {{for the management}} of <b>fibromyalgia.</b> The FDA also approved milnacipran, but the European Medicines Agency refused marketing authority.|$|E
25|$|The ACR {{criteria}} for the classification of patients were originally established as inclusion {{criteria for}} research purposes and were not intended for clinical diagnosis but have now become the de facto diagnostic criteria in the clinical setting. It {{should be noted that}} the number of tender points that may be active at any one time may vary with time and circumstance. A controversial study was done by a legal team looking to prove their client's disability based primarily on tender points and their widespread presence in non-litigious communities prompted the lead author of the ACR criteria to question now the useful validity of tender points in diagnosis. Use of control points has been used to cast doubt on whether a person has <b>fibromyalgia,</b> and to claim the person is malingering; however, no research has been done for the use of control points to diagnose <b>fibromyalgia,</b> and such diagnostic tests have been advised against, and people complaining of pain all over should still have <b>fibromyalgia</b> considered as a diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|Penta Water was {{a project}} of Bill Holloway who was {{suffering}} from <b>fibromyalgia.</b> In 1996, Holloway began experimenting with purifying water by using energy created by cavitation. He claimed the processed water helped him feel better.|$|E
25|$|SS is {{associated}} with a number of other medical conditions, many of which are autoimmune or rheumatic disorders, such as celiac disease, <b>fibromyalgia,</b> SLE (lupus), autoimmune thyroiditis, multiple sclerosis and spondyloarthropathy, and several malignancies, principally non-Hodgkin lymphoma.|$|E
25|$|Milnacipran (trade names Ixel, Savella, Dalcipran, Toledomin) is a serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake {{inhibitor}} (SNRI) used in {{the clinical}} treatment of <b>fibromyalgia.</b> It is not approved for the clinical treatment of major depressive disorder in the USA, {{but it is in}} other countries.|$|E
