5|$|Herrerasaurus {{displays}} {{traits that}} are found in different groups of dinosaurs, and several traits found in non-dinosaurian archosaurs. Although it shares most {{of the characteristics of}} dinosaurs, there are a few differences, particularly in the shape of its hip and leg bones. Its pelvis is like that of saurischian dinosaurs, but it has a bony acetabulum (where the femur meets the pelvis) that was only partially open. The ilium, the main <b>hip</b> <b>bone,</b> is supported by only two sacrals, a basal trait. However, the pubis points backwards, a derived trait as seen in dromaeosaurids and birds. Additionally, the end of the pubis has a booted shape, like those in avetheropods; and the vertebral centra has an hourglass shape as found in Allosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The summer pelage of {{different}} subspecies varies drastically but is generally dark or cinnamon brown. The back is dull, yellowish, ochre-grey in colour, with dark brown to black {{tips of the}} hairs. The latus (side of the body between therib cageand theuppermost and largest part of the <b>hip</b> <b>bone)</b> is tinged with rust-red, and the underside is pale yellowish ochre. In winter, its pelage turns grey, with a yellowish tinge; the underside becomes greyish brown, and the anterior dorsum and head are tinged with yellow. The incisive foramen (funnel-shaped opening in the bonyplate of theskull, located in {{the roof of the}} mouth,immediately behind theincisor teethwhere blood vessels and nerves pass) are round, small, and are detached from the palatine foramen.|$|E
50|$|The {{right and}} left <b>hip</b> <b>bones</b> of Georgiacetus were {{recovered}} though no hind leg or tail material was preserved. The <b>hip</b> <b>bones</b> were relatively large and showed well developed sockets. This indicates that Georgiacetus had well developed hind legs. Because the <b>hip</b> <b>bones</b> were so much larger than those known from Basilosaurus, and Basilosaurus was a dramatically larger animal than Georgiacetus, it was cautiously assumed that the hind legs of Georgiacetus were much larger, relative to body size, than the tiny hind legs of Basilosaurus. Yet the <b>hip</b> <b>bones</b> were not fused to the spine, (neither are those of Basilosaurus) {{which suggests that the}} Georgia whale probably could not support its own weight out of the water.|$|R

2500|$|The {{pelvic girdle}} {{consists}} of the two <b>hip</b> <b>bones.</b> The <b>hip</b> <b>bones</b> are connected to each other anteriorly at the pubic symphysis, and posteriorly to the sacrum at the sacroiliac joints to form the pelvic ring. [...] The ring is very stable and allows very little mobility, a prerequisite for transmitting loads from the trunk to the lower limbs.|$|R
5|$|All the {{vertebrae}} {{were highly}} pneumatised by invading air sacs, {{except for the}} atlas bone and the hindmost tail vertebrae, and were thereby connected to the respiratory system. The back vertebrae were as pneumatised as those of sauropod dinosaurs, and had an extensive system of depressions. These adaptations may be correlated with gigantism, as they reduce weight. The six vertebrae of the sacrum were also tall and pneumatised, and all but the first one were fused together at the top, their neural spines forming a neural plate. The ilium, the top <b>hip</b> <b>bone,</b> was also partially pneumatised close to the sacral vertebrae. Part of the pelvis was hypertrophied (enlarged) compared to other ornithomimosaurs, to support {{the weight of the}} animal with strong muscle attachments. The front hip bones tilted upwards in life. The tail of Deinocheirus ended in at least two fused vertebrae, which were described as similar to the pygostyle of oviraptorosaurian and therizinosauroid theropods. Ornithomimosaurs are known to have had pennaceous feathers, so this feature suggests that they might have had a fan of feathers at the tail end.|$|E
5|$|On 15 April 1939, he {{returned}} to a muddy Hampden Park with England to claim a 2–1 victory in front of 142,000 rain-soaked supporters; he set up Tommy Lawton for the winner with seconds to spare. That summer {{was the last time}} the England would tour Europe before Hitler's Nazis were defeated. The first game was against Italy, who gave the English a warm reception despite Benito Mussolini's breast-beating and the bad blood of five years previous. Again the World Champions, the Italians managed to salvage a 2–2 draw at the San Siro after scoring with a clear handball; this time Matthews left the field with a chipped <b>hip</b> <b>bone</b> for his efforts. The next game was a 2–1 loss to Yugoslavia, with Matthews and captain Eddie Hapgood passengers in the game after picking up early injuries; this injury forced him to sit out the following encounter with Romania.|$|E
5|$|Allosaurus {{had nine}} {{vertebrae}} in the neck, 14 in the back, and {{five in the}} sacrum supporting the hips. The number of tail vertebrae is unknown and varied with individual size; James Madsen estimated about 50, while Gregory S. Paul considered that to be too many and suggested 45 or less. There were hollow spaces in the neck and anterior back vertebrae. Such spaces, which are also found in modern theropods (that is, the birds), are interpreted as having held air sacs used in respiration. The rib cage was broad, giving it a barrel chest, especially in comparison to less derived theropods like Ceratosaurus. Allosaurus had gastralia (belly ribs), {{but these are not}} common findings, and they may have ossified poorly. In one published case, the gastralia show evidence of injury during life. A furcula (wishbone) was also present, but has only been recognized since 1996; in some cases furculae were confused with gastralia. The ilium, the main <b>hip</b> <b>bone,</b> was massive, and the pubic bone had a prominent foot that may have been used for both muscle attachment and as a prop for resting the body on the ground. Madsen noted that in about half of the individuals from the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry, independent of size, the pubes had not fused to each other at their foot ends. He suggested that this was a sexual characteristic, with females lacking fused bones to make egg-laying easier. This proposal has not attracted further attention, however.|$|E

25|$|Regular, brisk {{exercise}} {{of any kind}} can improve confidence, stamina, energy, weight control and life expectancy and reduce stress. It can also {{reduce the risk of}} coronary heart disease, strokes, diabetes, high blood pressure, bowel cancer and osteoporosis. Scientific studies have also shown that walking, besides its physical benefits, is also beneficial for the mind, improving memory skills, learning ability, concentration and abstract reasoning, as well as ameliorating spirits. Sustained walking sessions for a minimum period of thirty to sixty minutes a day, five days a week, with the correct walking posture, reduce health risks and have various overall health benefits, such as reducing the chances of cancer, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, anxiety disorder and depression. Life expectancy is also increased even for individuals suffering from obesity or high blood pressure. Walking also improves bone health, especially strengthening the <b>hip</b> <b>bone,</b> and lowering the harmful low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and raising the useful high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Studies have found that walking may also help prevent dementia and Alzheimer's.|$|E
25|$|Some paleontologists have {{doubted the}} biplane hypothesis, and have {{proposed}} other configurations. A 2010 study by Alexander et al. described {{the construction of}} a lightweight three-dimensional physical model used to perform glide tests. Using several hindleg configurations for the model, they found that the biplane model, while not unreasonable, was structurally deficient and needed a heavy-headed weight distribution for stable gliding, which they deemed unlikely. The study indicated that a laterally abducted hindwing structure represented the most biologically and aerodynamically consistent configuration for Microraptor. A further analysis by Brougham and Brusatte, however, concluded that Alexander's model reconstruction was not consistent with all of the available data on Microraptor and argued that the study was insufficient for determining a likely flight pattern for Microraptor. Brougham and Brusatte criticized the anatomy of the model used by Alexander and his team, noting that the hip anatomy was not consistent with other dromaeosaurs. In most dromaeosaurids, features of the <b>hip</b> <b>bone</b> prevent the legs from splaying horizontally; instead, they are locked in a vertical position below the body. Alexander's team used a specimen of Microraptor which was crushed flat to make their model, which Brougham and Brusatte argued did not reflect its actual anatomy. Later in 2010, Alexander's team responded to these criticisms, noting that the related dromaeosaur Hesperonychus, which is known from complete hip bones preserved in three dimensions, also shows hip sockets directed partially upward, possibly allowing the legs to splay more than in other dromaeosaurs.|$|E

40|$|Various {{measurements}} of the greater sciatic notch, e. g. width, depth and length of the posterior segment (of width) were measured, and indices I and II calculated, in 200 adult <b>hip</b> <b>bones</b> (120 males and 80 females). Total and posterior angles were measured after construction of a triangle from the above measurements in each case. Demarking points for sexing of <b>hip</b> <b>bones</b> were calculated for the above seven parameters on the lines of Jit & Singh (1966). Width and depth of the greater sciatic notch {{were found to be}} useless criteria for sexing purposes while the posterior angle was found to be the best parameter, which identified 75 % of left and 88 % of right male <b>hip</b> <b>bones</b> and 92 % of left and 100 % of right female bones. Length of the posterior segment and Index II also assigned sex to a high percentage of <b>hip</b> <b>bones,</b> especially to the female ones (95 - 97 %), which suggests that the widening of the greater sciatic notch found in females has occurred primarily in its posterior part. The demarking points identify sex with 100 % accuracy...|$|R
500|$|Marsh named {{a second}} species, Stegosaurus ungulatus, in 1879, and finally gave a more {{detailed}} description of all the Stegosaurus fossils collected to far the following year. In 1881, he named a third species Stegosaurus [...] "affinis", based only on a <b>hip</b> <b>bone.</b> This species is generally agreed to have been inadequately described, and therefore is a nomen nudum (a name lacking a formal description). The specimen was later lost. Marsh continued to collect and examine new Stegosaurus specimens, and in 1887 he named three new species: Stegosaurus stenops, S. duplex, and S. sulcatus. Though it {{had not yet been}} completely prepared, the nearly complete and articulated type specimen of Stegosaurus stenops allowed Marsh to complete the first attempt at a reconstructed Stegosaurus skeleton. This first reconstruction, of S. ungulatus with missing parts filled in from S. stenops, was published by Marsh in 1891. (In 1893, Richard Lydekker mistakenly re-published Marsh's drawing under the label Hypsirhophus).|$|E
500|$|Orville {{followed}} his brother's success by demonstrating another nearly identical Flyer to the United States Army at Fort Myer, Virginia, starting on September 3, 1908. On September 9, {{he made the}} first hour-long flight, lasting 62 minutes and 15 seconds. On September 17, Army lieutenant Thomas Selfridge rode along as his passenger, serving as an official observer. A few minutes into the flight {{at an altitude of}} about , a propeller split and shattered, sending the Flyer out of control. Selfridge suffered a fractured skull in the crash and died that evening in the nearby Army hospital, becoming the first airplane crash fatality. Orville was badly injured, suffering a broken left leg and four broken ribs. Twelve years later, after he suffered increasingly severe pains, X-rays revealed the accident had also caused three <b>hip</b> <b>bone</b> fractures and a dislocated hip. The brothers' sister Katharine, a school teacher, rushed from Dayton to Virginia and stayed by Orville's side for the seven weeks of his hospitalization. She helped negotiate a one-year extension of the Army contract. A friend visiting Orville in the hospital asked, [...] "Has it got your nerve?" [...] "Nerve?" [...] repeated Orville, slightly puzzled. [...] "Oh, do you mean will I be afraid to fly again? The only thing I'm afraid of is that I can't get well soon enough to finish those tests next year." ...|$|E
500|$|The type {{species of}} Amphicoelias, A. altus, was named by {{paleontologist}} Edward Drinker Cope in December 1877 (though not published until 1878) for an incomplete skeleton {{consisting of two}} vertebrae, a pubis (<b>hip</b> <b>bone),</b> and a femur (upper leg bone). Cope also named a second species, A. fragillimus, in the same paper. However, all subsequent researchers have considered A. fragillimus to be a synonym of A. altus. Even by 1881 however, it was recognized that A. altus could not be distinguished from other genera, as the features described by Cope were misinterpreted and are widespread. In 1921, Osborn and Mook assigned additional bones to A. altus—a scapula (shoulder blade), a coracoid (shoulder bone), an ulna (lower arm bone), and a tooth. Henry Fairfield Osborn and Charles Craig Mook noted the overall close similarity between Amphicoelias and Diplodocus, {{as well as a}} few key differences, such as proportionally longer forelimbs in Amphicoelias than in Diplodocus. The dentition of Amphicoelias is homodont. Its teeth are shaped like long slender cylindrical rods, are spaced apart and project forward towards the front of the mouth. The femur of Amphicoelias is unusually long, slender, and round in cross section; while this roundness was once thought to be another distinguishing characteristic of Amphicoelias, it has since been found in some specimens of Diplodocus as well. A. altus was also similar in size to Diplodocus, estimated to be about [...] long. While most scientists have used these details to distinguish Amphicoelias and Diplodocus as separate genera, at least one has suggested that Amphicoelias is probably the senior synonym of Diplodocus.|$|E
