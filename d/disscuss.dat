40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Letter is to {{continue}} {{the study of the}} class of models proposed in the previous paper [1] hep-th/ 0002077. The model corresponds to a system of branes of diverse dimensionalities with Chern-Simons actions for a supergroup, embedded in a background described also by a Chern-Simons action. The model treats the background and the branes on an equal footing, providing a ’brane-target space democracy’. Here we suggest some possible extensions of the original model, and <b>disscuss</b> its equations of motion, as well as the issue of currents and charges carried by the branes. We also <b>disscuss</b> the relationship with M-theory and Superstring theory...|$|E

40|$|Non-perturbative lattice QCD {{calculations}} at non vanishing baryon number density are {{hampered by}} the QCD sign problem. The path integral, that in lattice QCD is calculated numerically, becomes highly oscillating. One possible solution is the Lefschetz thimble approach. It requires a deformation of the original integration domain into a manifold embedded in complex space. For properly chosen integration manifolds ("thimbles") the sign problem is drastically alleviated. For some bosonic and fermionic models this approach {{has been shown to}} work. Here we apply the thimble disretization to (0 + 1) -dimensional QCD with standard staggerd quarks and <b>disscuss</b> issues that may arrise in higher dimensions.
