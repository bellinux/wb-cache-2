5|$|Brushstrokes {{series is}} the name {{for a series of}} {{paintings}} produced in 196566 by Roy Lichtenstein. It also refers to derivative sculptural representations of these paintings that were first made in the 1980s. In the series, the theme <b>is</b> <b>art</b> as a subject, but rather than reproduce masterpieces as he had starting in 1962, Lichtenstein depicted the gestural expressions of the painting brushstroke itself. The works in this series are linked to those produced by artists who use the gestural painting style of abstract expressionism made famous by Jackson Pollock, but differ from them due to their mechanically produced appearance. The series is considered a satire or parody of gestural painting by both Lichtenstein and his critics. After 1966, Lichtenstein incorporated this series into later motifs and themes of his work.|$|E

Overall it <b>is</b> <b>Art</b> Deco in style, and is one of only three state capitols in the United States constructed in that architectural style.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{the best-known}} and most popular {{intervention}} {{of this nature}} was performed when the artist created a projection for Nelson’s column in Trafalgar Square, London in 1985.

Wodiczko turned one of his projectors away from Nelson’s column projecting a swastika onto the tympanum of the temple-like façade of South Africa House, the South African diplomatic mission to the United Kingdom. Though the image remained only two hours before the police suspended the intervention as a “public nuisance” it lingered in public awareness much longer. It is frequently cited at conferences, in classroom discussions, and other forum as an example of successful urban guerrilla cultural tactics – that <b>is,</b> <b>art</b> and/or performance that is waged by unexpected means for the purpose of engaging an active response.|$|E

25|$|Generative art <b>is</b> <b>art</b> {{that has}} been generated, composed, or {{constructed}} in an algorithmic manner {{through the use of}} systems defined by computer software algorithms, or similar mathematical or mechanical or randomised autonomous processes. Sonia Landy Sheridan established Generative Systems as a program at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1970 in response to social change brought about in part by the computer-robot communications revolution. The program, which brought artists and scientists together, was an effort at turning the artist's passive role into an active one by promoting the investigation of contemporary scientific—technological systems and their relationship to art and life. Unlike copier art, which was a simple commercial spin-off, Generative Systems was actually involved in the development of elegant yet simple systems intended for creative use by the general population. Generative Systems artists attempted {{to bridge the gap between}} elite and novice by directing the line of communication between the two, thus bringing first generation information to greater numbers of people and bypassing the entrepreneur.|$|E
