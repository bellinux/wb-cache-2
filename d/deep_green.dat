25|$|With {{attractive}} <b>deep</b> <b>green</b> {{foliage and}} large, brightly coloured flower {{species that are}} held outside the canopy, B.victoriae is a popular garden plant. It requires a sunny aspect in well drained soil, and is sensitive to frost. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 27 to 41 days to germinate. It is easy to propagate from seed, but rather difficult from cuttings. It grows quickly, and flowers in {{three to four years}} from seed. George recommends only light pruning, not below the green foliage.|$|E

50|$|The terms Muzo and Chivor do {{not always}} refer to the {{particular}} mines that carry the same name. Instead, the two terms, originating from the local indigenous language, often describe the quality and color of emeralds. Muzo refers to a warm, grassy-green emerald, with hints of yellow. Chivor, on the other hand, describes a <b>deeper</b> <b>green</b> color.|$|R

25|$|Thallium, the {{heaviest}} stable {{element in the}} boron group, was discovered by William Crookes and Claude-Auguste Lamy in 1861. Unlike gallium and indium, thallium had not been predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev, having been discovered before Mendeleev invented the periodic table. As a result, no one was really looking for it until the 1850s when Crookes and Lamy were examining residues from sulfuric acid production. In the spectra they saw a completely new line, a streak of <b>deep</b> <b>green,</b> which Crookes named after the Greek word θαλλός (thallos), referring to a green shoot or twig. Lamy was able to produce larger amounts of the new metal and determined most of its chemical and physical properties.|$|E
25|$|In {{the role}} of the state personified, the monarch has worn {{clothing}} symbolic of the country and his or her distinct role in it. For instance, the gown worn by Queen Elizabeth II at both her coronation in London and the opening of the Canadian parliament in 1957 was decorated with the floral emblems of her realms, including maple leaves for Canada. During the same 1957 visit to Ottawa, the Queen also wore to a banquet held at Rideau Hall the Maple-Leaf-of-Canada dress; it was a pale green satin gown, edged with a garland consisting of <b>deep</b> <b>green</b> velvet maple leaves appliquéd with crysals and emeralds. Afterwards, the dress was donated to the Crown Collection and is now held at the Canadian Museum of History. Similarly, for a dinner held in July 2010 in Toronto, Elizabeth wore a white gown with silver maple leaves appliquéd on the right sleeve and shoulder.|$|E

50|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, a {{conflict}} between the Fundis and the Realos with the German Green Party arose. While the Realos, the group around Joschka Fischer, were in favour of moderate policies and cabinet cooperation, the Fundis opposed cabinet cooperation. The Fundis were composed of <b>deep</b> <b>greens</b> and eco-socialists. They did not only oppose cabinet cooperation, but were also in favour of strict term limits.|$|R

500|$|Its {{leaves are}} <b>deep</b> <b>green</b> and glossy above, and a pale matte green below. They are roughly oval-shaped, but concave rather than lying flat. There is a sharp {{point at the}} tip, and two to four more such points along each margin. They range in length from , and in width from , with a petiole [...] long. Young leaves have a coating of woolly hairs on both sides, but these are soon lost except in pits in the undersurface.|$|E
500|$|Philips Lighting's {{first shot}} at {{marketing}} a standalone compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulb was Earth Light, at $15 each versus 75 cents for incandescent bulbs. [...] The product had difficulty {{climbing out of}} its <b>deep</b> <b>green</b> niche. The company re-launched the product as [...] "Marathon," [...] underscoring its new [...] "super long life" [...] positioning and promise of saving $26 in energy costs over its five-year lifetime. Finally, with the U.S. EPA's Energy Star label to add credibility {{as well as new}} sensitivity to rising utility costs and electricity shortages, sales climbed 12 percent in an otherwise flat market.|$|E
60|$|Brooks and pools have a {{peculiar}} aspect at this season. One {{knows that the}} water must be cold, and one shivers a little {{at the sight of}} it; and yet the grass about the pool may be of the <b>deepest</b> <b>green,</b> and the sun may be shining into it. The withered leaves which overhanging trees shed upon its surface contribute much to the effect.|$|R
50|$|While {{very pale}} green is the typical colour of {{transparent}} glass, <b>deeper</b> <b>greens</b> {{can be achieved}} by the addition of Iron(II) oxide which results in a bluish-green glass. Together with chromium it gives glass of a richer green colour, typical of the glass used to make wine bottles.The addition of chromium yields dark green glass, suitable for flashed glass. Together with tin oxide and arsenic it yields emerald green glass.|$|R

500|$|Following {{the release}} of their seventh studio album Sweet 7, which was met with poor reviews and low sales, it was {{confirmed}} that the Sugababes had begun work on their eighth album. In February 2011, group member Heidi Range stated that the Sugababes were aiming to finish the album in time for a summer 2011 release. She revealed that the group completed a song which they believed could be the album's lead single. The Sugababes confirmed in May 2011 that they would premiere [...] "Freedom" [...] at the Mawazine Festival in Morocco. In July 2011, the group's management confirmed that the group had left their longtime record company Island Records and signed a three-album deal with Sony's RCA label. The artwork for [...] "Freedom" [...] was revealed in August 2011; it features the Sugababes on a sofa wearing <b>deep</b> <b>green</b> clothing.|$|E
500|$|A {{sense of}} {{movement}} is conveyed throughout. The trailing edges of Gabriel's garment fall outside the pictorial space, indicating his arrival. The Virgin's [...] "serpentine" [...] pose, with attendant angels supporting her, {{adds to the}} sense of flow. Memling's use of color achieves a startling effect. The traditional rays of light are replaced with light color indicators; the white clothes rendered in [...] "icy" [...] blue, the angel to the right in yellow patches seems [...] "bleached by light", the left-hand angel appears to be steeped in shadow, dressed in clothes of lavender and bearing <b>deep</b> <b>green</b> wings. The effect is iridescent, according to Blum, who writes, [...] "this shimmering surface gives [...] an unearthly quality, separating them from the more believable world of the bedchamber." [...] The effect deviates from the pure naturalism and realism which typifies Early Netherlandish art, causing a [...] "startling" [...] juxtaposition, an effect that is [...] "unsteadying" [...] and contradictory.|$|E
500|$|The album {{begins with}} a gentle piano-and-glockenspiel {{instrumental}} before segueing into [...] "Lawn of Dawns", which introduces Nico's harmonium [...] "of undulating motion weaving against her voice". The song is engulfed in [...] "weird clattering and tintinnabulating", while a [...] "dark twangy guitar... stumbles to a subdued halt in [...] final seconds". It features what may be Nico's first lyrics, inspired by her peyote visions with Jim Morrison: [...] "He blesses you, he blesses me/The day the night caresses,/Caresses you, caresses me,/Can you follow me?/I cannot understand the way I feel/Until I rest on lawns of dawns—/Can you follow me?" [...] Nico explained the peyote-induced experience which inspired the lyrics: [...] "The light of the dawn was a very <b>deep</b> <b>green</b> and I believed I was upside down {{and the sky was}} the desert which had become a garden and then the ocean. I do not swim and I was frightened when it was water and more resolved when it was land. I felt embraced by the sky-garden." [...] The lyrics of the next song, [...] "No One Is There", have been described as [...] "in all probability influenced by Jim Morrison" [...] ("Some are calling/Some are sad/Some are calling mad") and are sung over Cale's classical quartet of violas darting in and out of her unusual vocal tempo. [...] "Ari's Song" [...] was dedicated to Nico's young son, Christian Aaron [...] "Ari" [...] Boulogne, her only child with French actor Alain Delon, and has been called [...] "the least-comforting lullaby ever recorded". It begins with the harmonium's clipped, whistling tones as she sings softly, [...] "Sail away/Sail away my little boy". [...] "Facing the Wind" [...] is supported by [...] "Cale-banged piano clusters, scraping of percussion or walls and off-beat tympani"; Nico's voice sounds filtered (possibly through a Leslie speaker), with the [...] "somnambulistic toiling" [...] of her pipe organ accompanied by viola and strident piano.|$|E
25|$|Paris green (copper(II) acetate triarsenite or copper(II) acetoarsenite) is an {{inorganic}} compound.

60|$|A cloud {{began to}} cover the sun slowly, wholly, {{shadowing}} the bay in <b>deeper</b> <b>green.</b> It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters. Fergus' song: I sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords. Her door was open: she wanted to hear my music. Silent with awe and pity I went to her bedside. She was crying in her wretched bed. For those words, Stephen: love's bitter mystery.|$|R
