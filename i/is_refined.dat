High-purity scrap copper is melted in a furnace and then reduced and cast into billets and ingots; lower-purity scrap <b>is</b> <b>refined</b> by electroplating in a bath of sulfuric acid.|$|E
5|$|Zinc is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Zn and atomic number 30. It {{is the first}} element in group 12 of the periodic table. In some respects zinc is chemically similar to magnesium: both elements exhibit only one normal oxidation state (+2), and the Zn2+ and Mg2+ ions are of similar size. Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth's crust and has five stable isotopes. The most common zinc ore is sphalerite (zinc blende), a zinc sulfide mineral. The largest workable lodes are in Australia, Asia, and the United States. Zinc <b>is</b> <b>refined</b> by froth flotation of the ore, roasting, and final extraction using electricity (electrowinning).|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, salt is {{extracted}} from the vast sedimentary deposits which have been laid down over the millennia from the evaporation of seas and lakes. These are either mined directly, producing rock salt, or are extracted in solution by pumping water into the deposit. In either case, the salt may be purified by mechanical evaporation of brine. Traditionally, this was done in shallow open pans which were heated to increase the rate of evaporation. More recently, the process is performed in pans under vacuum. The raw salt <b>is</b> <b>refined</b> to purify it and improve its storage and handling characteristics. This usually involves recrystallization during which a brine solution is treated with chemicals that precipitate most impurities (largely magnesium and calcium salts). Multiple stages of evaporation are then used to collect pure sodium chloride crystals, which are kiln-dried. Some salt is produced using the Alberger process, which involves vacuum pan evaporation combined with the seeding of the solution with cubic crystals, and produces a grainy-type flake. The Ayoreo, an indigenous group from the Paraguayan Chaco, obtain their salt from the ash produced by burning the timber of the Indian salt tree (Maytenus vitis-idaea) and other trees.|$|E

25|$|A modern {{paper mill}} {{is divided into}} several sections, roughly {{corresponding}} to the processes involved in making handmade paper. Pulp <b>is</b> <b>refined</b> and mixed in water with other additives to make a pulp slurry. The head-box of the paper machine (Fourdrinier machine) distributes the slurry onto a moving continuous screen, water drains from the slurry (by gravity or under vacuum), the wet paper sheet goes through presses and dries, and finally rolls into large rolls. The outcome often weighs several tons.|$|E
25|$|Raw opium may {{be sold to}} a {{merchant}} or broker on the black market, but it usually does not travel far from the field before it <b>is</b> <b>refined</b> into morphine base, because pungent, jelly-like raw opium is bulkier and harder to smuggle.

25|$|Casa Salazar-Candal {{is one of}} a {{group of}} stylistically eclectic houses built in Ponce between 1900 and 1915. Designed by {{architect}} Blas C.

The facade is distinctly rendered in roccoco and moorish detailing to emphasize its bifunctional character as a home and an office respectively.

It utilizes a balcony, raised and detached from the street as a transitional zone between the public and the private sphere.|$|E

25|$|Shipping in Shannon estuary was {{developed}} extensively during the 1980s, with over IR£2billion (€2.5billion) investment. A tanker terminal at Foynes and an oil jetty at Shannon Airport were built. In 1982 {{a large scale}} alumina extraction plant was built at Aughinish. 60,000 tonne cargo vessels now carry raw bauxite from West African mines to the plant, where it <b>is</b> <b>refined</b> to alumina. This is then exported to Canada where it is further refined to aluminium. 1985 saw {{the opening of a}} 915 MW coal-fired electricity plant at Moneypoint, fed by regular visits by 150,000 tonne bulk carriers.|$|E
25|$|In Monte Carlo, {{an initial}} {{configuration}} <b>is</b> <b>refined</b> by taking random steps which are accepted or rejected {{based on their}} induced improvement in score (see the Metropolis criterion), until {{a certain number of}} steps have been tried. The assumption is that convergence to the best structure should occur from a large class of initial configurations, only one of which needs to be considered. Initial configurations may be sampled coarsely, and much computation time can be saved. Because of the difficulty of finding a scoring function which is both highly discriminating for the correct configuration and also converges to the correct configuration from a distance, the use of two levels of refinement, with different scoring functions, has been proposed. Torsion can be introduced naturally to Monte Carlo as an additional property of each random move.|$|E
25|$|Mining, refining, and {{recycling}} of rare earths have serious environmental consequences if not properly managed. A particular hazard is mildly radioactive slurry tailings {{resulting from the}} common occurrence of thorium and uranium in rare-earth element ores. Additionally, toxic acids are required during the refining process. Improper handling of these substances can result in extensive environmental damage. In May 2010, China announced a major, five-month crackdown on illegal mining {{in order to protect}} the environment and its resources. This campaign is expected to be concentrated in the South, where mines– commonly small, rural, and illegal operations– are particularly prone to releasing toxic wastes into the general water supply. However, even the major operation in Baotou, in Inner Mongolia, where much of the world's rare-earth supply <b>is</b> <b>refined,</b> has caused major environmental damage.|$|E

25|$|The {{reconstruction}} of the breast(s) with grafts of autologous fat is a non-implant alternative to further surgery after a breast cancer surgery, be it a lumpectomy or a breast removalsimple (total) mastectomy, radical mastectomy, modified radical mastectomy, skin-sparing mastectomy, and subcutaneous (nipple-sparing) mastectomy. The breast is reconstructed by first applying external tissue expansion to the recipient-site tissues (adipose, glandular) to create a breast-tissue matrix that can be injected with autologous fat grafts (adipocyte tissue); the reconstructed breast has a natural form, look, and feel, and is generally sensate throughout and in the nipple-areola complex (NAC). The {{reconstruction of}} breasts with fat grafts requires a three-month treatment periodbegun after 3–5 weeks of external vacuum expansion of the recipient-site tissues. The autologous breast-filler fat is harvested by liposuction from the patient's body (buttocks, thighs, abdomen), <b>is</b> <b>refined</b> and then is injected (grafted) to the breast-tissue matrices (recipient sites), where the fat will thrive.|$|E
25|$|Diesel is {{generally}} simpler to refine from petroleum than gasoline, and contains hydrocarbons having a boiling {{point in the}} range of 180–360°C (360–680°F). The price of diesel traditionally rises during colder months as demand for heating oil rises, which <b>is</b> <b>refined</b> in much the same way. Because of recent changes in fuel quality regulations, additional refining is required to remove sulfur, which contributes to a sometimes higher cost. In many parts of the United States and throughout the United Kingdom and Australia, diesel may be priced higher than petrol. Reasons for higher-priced diesel include the shutdown of some refineries in the Gulf of Mexico, diversion of mass refining capacity to gasoline production, and a recent transfer to ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD), which causes infrastructural complications. In Sweden, a diesel fuel designated as MK-1 (class 1 environmental diesel) is also being sold; this is a ULSD that also has a lower aromatics content, with a limit of 5%. This fuel is slightly more expensive to produce than regular ULSD.|$|E
500|$|The {{technique}} of simulated annealing, by which an existing MSA produced by another method <b>is</b> <b>refined</b> {{by a series}} of rearrangements designed to find better regions of alignment space than the one the input alignment already occupies. Like the genetic algorithm method, simulated annealing maximizes an objective function like the sum-of-pairs function. Simulated annealing uses a metaphorical [...] "temperature factor" [...] that determines the rate at which rearrangements proceed and the likelihood of each rearrangement; typical usage alternates periods of high rearrangement rates with relatively low likelihood (to explore more distant regions of alignment space) with periods of lower rates and higher likelihoods to more thoroughly explore local minima near the newly [...] "colonized" [...] regions. This approach has been implemented in the program MSASA (Multiple Sequence Alignment by Simulated Annealing).|$|E
