5|$|Loaded (also {{known as}} Duff McKagan's Loaded) is an American rock band from Seattle, Washington, formed in 1999. Since 2001, the band's line-up has {{included}} vocalist and rhythm guitarist Duff McKagan (Velvet Revolver and Guns N' Roses), lead guitarist Mike Squires (formerly of Nevada Bachelors and Alien Crime Syndicate) and bassist Jeff Rouse (formerly of Alien Crime Syndicate, Sirens Sister, and Vendetta Red). Since 2009, Isaac Carpenter (formerly of Loudermilk, Gosling, and The Exies) {{has been the}} band's drummer, replacing Geoff Reading (formerly of New American Shame and <b>Green</b> <b>Apple</b> Quick Step).|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} popular {{proposed}} resolutions is to accept the conclusion that the observation of a <b>green</b> <b>apple</b> provides evidence that all ravens are black but to argue that the amount of confirmation provided is very small, due to the large discrepancy between the number of ravens and the number of non-black objects. According to this resolution, the conclusion appears paradoxical because we intuitively estimate the amount of evidence provided by the observation of a <b>green</b> <b>apple</b> to be zero, when it is in fact non-zero but extremely small.|$|E

25|$|Riesling B: {{originates}} from German vineyards (Germany, Alsace, Switzerland). It is a grape {{that can}} be of high quality {{in a variety of}} soils provided that yield is limited and climate tends to a continental climate This type is much lighter in comparison to other white wines and typically has a <b>green</b> <b>apple</b> aroma. Common food dishes that go well with Riesling are fish, chicken, and pork.|$|E
25|$|By {{the same}} reasoning, this {{statement}} is evidence that (2) if something is not black then {{it is not a}} raven. But since (as above) {{this statement is}} logically equivalent to (1) all ravens are black, it follows that the sight of a <b>green</b> <b>apple</b> is evidence supporting the notion that all ravens are black. This conclusion seems paradoxical, because it implies that information has been gained about ravens by looking at an apple.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, McKagan {{reformed}} Loaded, remaining as {{the lead}} vocalist but switching from bass to rhythm guitar, and adding drummer Geoff Reading of <b>Green</b> <b>Apple</b> Quick Step, guitarist Mike Squires of Harvey Danger, and bassist Jeff Rouse of Alien Crime Syndicate. Both Squires and Rouse joined after the recording of the band's debut album, Dark Days, released in 2001. Dave Dederer, formerly of The Presidents of the United States of America, took up recording duties for the album.|$|E

25|$|Acetaldehyde is an {{intermediate}} product of yeast fermentation; however, {{it is more}} commonly associated with ethanol oxidation catalysed by the enzyme ethanol dehydrogenase. Acetaldehyde production is also associated {{with the presence of}} surface film forming yeasts and bacteria, such as acetic acid bacteria, which form the compound by the decarboxylation of pyruvate. The sensory threshold for acetaldehyde is 100-125 mg/L. Beyond this level it imparts a sherry type character to the wine which can also be described as <b>green</b> <b>apple,</b> sour and metallic. Acetaldehyde intoxication is also implicated in hangovers.|$|E
25|$|Over 30 {{different}} grapes {{varieties are}} {{grown in the}} Friuli-Venezia Giulia including international varieties such as Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot {{as well as local}} varieties like Refosco dal peduncolo rosso, Schioppettino, Friulano, Ribolla gialla and Verduzzo. Of the local varieties, Friulano is the most well known and important variety, producing crisp, floral wines that develop notes of nuts and fennel as it ages. The grape was widely known as Tocai Friulano but in 2006 the European Union banned names that have some similarity or association with the Hungarian wine Tokaji. Now Tocai Friulano is called Friulano. The very acidic Ribolla gialla grape was primarily used as a blending component until winemakers started to apply the techniques used with Chardonnay (such as malolactic fermentation) to produce softer, more buttery wines that still retain the crisp, lemon edge of the grape. Wines made from Verduzzo have peach and nutty flavors in their youth but develop more honeyed flavors as the wine ages. The high acidity of the grape works well in sweet production and in regions like Ramandolo it is often dried to make a passito wine. The Picolit grape also does well in sweet wines where it can produce elegant, floral wines that have a dry finish. In contrast to the thin, sometimes bland Pinot grigio produced {{in other parts of the}} Tre-Venezie, well made examples of Friuli Pinot grigio are known for their fuller body and delicate peach, almond and <b>green</b> <b>apple</b> flavors. Sauvignon blancs are made in a style reminiscent of Sancerre with smoke, herbs and elements of honey and hazelnut. Some of the most expensive Friuli wines are made from the Picolit grape which is prone to grape diseases and mutations which cause the vine to lose its flowers and grape clusters. In most years, less than half of a vineyard Picolit crop will survive and be able to make wine. The light, honeyed dessert wine that it can produce is often in high demand because of restricted supply.|$|E

500|$|While Loaded were briefly inactive, guitarist Mike Squires {{performed}} with <b>Green</b> <b>Apple</b> Quick Step {{on a few}} occasions and McKagan began writing and recording with Jane's Addiction. McKagan was confirmed as a permanent member of the group, in April, performing at shows in the United States and Europe. His tenure with the band only lasted five months, with his departure from the group announced on September 6. In a statement, the band commented: [...] "We wanted to thank Duff for helping us write songs for our new record. We love the songs we worked on with him — and the gigs were a blast — but musically we were all headed in different directions. From here Duff is off {{to work on his}} own stuff so we wish him all the best".|$|E
500|$|Originally, the {{intention}} {{had been to}} release [...] "Isn't It a Pity" [...] as the lead single from All Things Must Pass in October 1970, until Spector and others persuaded Harrison that [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] was the most obvious choice. The full, seven-minute [...] "Isn't It a Pity" [...] was therefore issued as a double A-side with [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] on 23 November in the United States and Canada (as Apple 2995), {{four days before the}} album's release there. Reflecting the equal status of the two tracks, both sides of the single's picture sleeve featured the same Barry Feinstein-shot photo of Harrison, the only differences being the song title below Harrison's name {{and the fact that the}} <b>green</b> <b>Apple</b> Records logo and catalogue number appeared only on the side for [...] "My Sweet Lord".|$|E
