A method is explored here based on displacement transducers for the continuous, nondestructive assessment of functional <b>hydraulic</b> <b>connections</b> within the intact plant. The graft union was chosen as a test system. The technique involves repeated application of water {{at some point in}} the system, while simultaneously observing patterns of swelling (increase in water status) at other points. Such patterns will reflect the hydraulic resistance of the intervening pathways. It is demonstrated that the major <b>hydraulic</b> <b>connections</b> within the graft union of tomato become functional over a period of about 48 h from the fifth day after grafting. This is consistent with histological observations on the appearance of wound-xylem bridges at this time.

The fractures provide rapid <b>hydraulic</b> <b>connection</b> but little fluid mass storage, whereas the porous matrix represents high storage but low <b>hydraulic</b> <b>connection.</b> The flow model incorporated in COSFLOW is similar to the conventional flow model; i.e. the flow in the fracture (cleat) system is controlled by the pressure gradient and is described using Darcy’s law, whereas, the desorption (flow in the matrix) is controlled by the concentration gradient and is described using Fick’s law. The relationship between gas concentration and pressure is a non-linear function and is described using Langmuir equations.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{structure}} of groundwater flow {{system is the}} core of study of groundwater system and the base of evaluation of groundwater resources. The control role of aquifer system to groundwater flow system is a key of study of the {{structure of}} groundwater flow system. The groundwater systems of the Ordos basin are analyzed as a case study. The control role of aquifer system to groundwater flow system is studied by comparison of groundwater flow systems under the control of different aquifer structures in 2 -D profile numerical model. The research shows that the groundwater flow systems of the Ordos basin have the multilayer structure characteristics. The groundwater flow systems in the north of the Ordos basin show a cross-formational multi-hierarchy nested flow pattern in the northern aquifer systems without regional impermeable layer where the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>connection</b> between aquifer layers is closely. While, the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>connection</b> is discontinuous in the southern aquifer systems because there are regional impermeable layers in the aquifer systems.

30|$|In the Sanjiang Plain, many wells with depth {{deeper than}} 50  m have been dug for water supply {{due to the}} {{contamination}} of shallow groundwater. It is necessary to identify the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>connections</b> among SW, SG and DG, because extractions of deep groundwater may lead to pollutants transporting vertically from shallow groundwater to deep groundwater, and the contamination of deep groundwater is a more serious problem to be dealt with. In this study, the hydraulic connection is identified by evaluating the hydrochemistry similarity according to discriminant analysis.|$|E
30|$|Another common {{error in}} {{vulnerability}} validation is the ignorance of lateral contaminant fluxes. By definition, aquifer vulnerability {{accounts for the}} vertical susceptibility {{of the system and}} is not considered for any lateral crossflows of contaminant plumes from adjacent hydrogeological units. Hence, practically validation with measured contaminant values at the saturated zone should be only performed at hydrologically “closed” systems, without any <b>hydraulic</b> <b>connections</b> with other units (surface or underground); if not, then potential migrations of contaminant plume(s) have {{to be taken into account}} prior to validation.|$|E
40|$|Cross-borehole flow tests {{provided}} {{insights into}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>connections</b> in fractured and dipping mudstone and sandstone that {{were consistent with}} the lithostratigraphic and structural framework of a VOC-contaminated bedrock research site in west-central New Jersey. Two cross-borehole flow tests were completed. Each test involved measurement and analysis of transient flow in a newly installed deep corehole with a long open interval during short-term pumping and recovery in an adjacent shallow well with a short open interval. The cross-borehole flow test in the mudstone identified a hydraulic connection through a dipping fractured bed between the pumped interval in the well and a flow zone at an intermediate depth in the corehole. The presence of a hydraulic connection between the pumped well and the corehole was not obvious because the water-level response in the corehole was dominated by a shallow zone of high transmissivity, which was hydraulically isolated from the pumped interval. In the sandstone, the cross-borehole flow test identified a hydraulic connection along dipping fractured beds as well as a connection to a deep high-angle fracture that cuts across bedding. These results suggest that application of cross-borehole flow tests at other contaminated fractured-bedrock sites could provide insights into <b>hydraulic</b> <b>connections</b> useful the design and implementation of monitoring and remediation programs...|$|E

40|$|The {{convective}} drying of {{a natural}} porous material, limestone, is investigated in this study, with both experimental and numerical approaches. The first experimental campaign, which focuses {{on the influence of}} samples’ slenderness, suggests the presence of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>connection</b> layer between the porous water and the external environment, in spite of the very fine pore structure of the material. This hydraulic transfer enables the fast water evaporation {{at the beginning of the}} drying test, when external conditions drive the kinetics. Furthermore, the results show that this layer does not exceed 30 mm deep from the external surface, given the drying conditions of the test. A second experimental campaign aims to analyse, by mean of an X-ray tomography tool, the internal water content during the drying. It confirms that water transfer takes place within the limestone in two distinct stages. The first stage being faster than the second one with a homogeneous desaturation along the sample, it is consistent with the hypothesis of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>connection</b> layer.

40|$|Aquifers are {{generally}} composed of highly permeable layers that can conduct {{a considerable amount}} of groundwater. Traditionally, aquifer units are correlated through the concept of lithostratigraphy. For low-permeable aquifers, it is difficult to define the spatial distribution of hydrogeological units, and this study attempts to use geochemical modeling to identify the groundwater flow paths in an area of Taiwan. Multiple geochemical analyses, including groundwater chemistry; stable isotopic compositions of hydrogen, oxygen and carbon; and radiocarbon contents were performed. Using these parameters as the constraints of geochemical models, the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>connection</b> was examined between pairs of possibly interlinked wells along four selected cross sections, and the conceptual groundwater model was accordingly established. The resultant model suggests that the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>connection</b> between aquifers should be correlated with the concept of chronological stratigraphy, especially for low-permeable, unconsolidated aquifers. Using Darcy's law, the hydraulic conductivities of the fine-sand aquifers were estimated to be between 3. 14 x 10 (- 5) and 1. 80 x(- 4) m/s, which are roughly one order of magnitude higher than those derived by in situ pumping tests.

40|$|International audienceThe {{geometry}} and connectivity of fractures exert {{a strong influence}} on the flow and transport properties of fracture networks. We present a novel approach to stochastically generate three-dimensional discrete networks of connected fractures that are conditioned to hydrological and geophysical data. A hierarchical rejection sampling algorithm is used to draw realizations from the posterior probability density function at different conditioning levels. The method is applied to a well-studied granitic formation using data acquired within two boreholes located 6 m apart. The prior models include 27 fractures with their geometry (position and orientation) bounded by information derived from single-hole ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data acquired during saline tracer tests and optical televiewer logs. Eleven cross-hole <b>hydraulic</b> <b>connections</b> between fractures in neighboring boreholes and {{the order in which}} the tracer arrives at different fractures are used for conditioning. Furthermore, the networks are conditioned to the observed relative hydraulic importance of the different <b>hydraulic</b> <b>connections</b> by numerically simulating the flow response. Among the conditioning data considered, constraints on the relative flow contributions were the most effective in determining the variability among the network realizations. Nevertheless, we find that the posterior model space is strongly determined by the imposed prior bounds. Strong prior bounds were derived from GPR measurements and helped to make the approach computationally feasible. We analyze a set of 230 posterior realizations that reproduce all data given their uncertainties assuming the same uniform transmissivity in all fractures. The posterior models provide valuable statistics on length scales and density of connected fractures, as well as their connectivity. In an additional analysis, effective transmissivity estimates of the posterior realizations indicate a strong influence of the DFN structure, in that it induces large variations of equivalent transmissivities between realizations. The transmissivity estimates agree well with previous estimates at the site based on pumping, flowmeter and temperature data...|$|E
40|$|A {{geological}} medium that exhibits two distinct types of flow {{is known as}} dual-permeability medium. Unconsolidated deposits composed of coarse (3 ̆e 2 mm diameter) clasts (gravel, talus, rockslide debris), engineered systems (heap leach piles, capillary barriers, rock fill), and mine/construction waste fall into this category. The large inter-clast pores that are characteristic {{of this type of}} media will drain at near zero matric potentials constraining flow to the interiors of porous clasts and/or the clast surfaces. In either case, water must pass through hydraulic bridges (porous contacts and/or pendular water) that form physical connections between neighboring clasts. Therefore, properties of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>connections</b> place a primary control on flow structure. This dissertation presents three projects designed to study the influence of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>connections</b> on unsaturated flow in dual-permeability media. A numerical experiment performed to examine how the cross-sectional area and hydraulic conductivity of a bridge influence steady-state flow through a spherical clast is presented in the second chapter of the dissertation. The cross-sectional area of the bridges relative to that of the clast (Ar) was varied across six orders of magnitude between simulations. The ratio of hydraulic conductivity between bridges and clasts (Kb/Kc) was varied across 12 orders of magnitude to consider resistive, neutral, and conductive bridges. Results show a non-linear dependency of volumetric flow through the clast on both Ar and Kb/Kc. The intra-clast flow distribution shifts outwards as Ar increases. Conductive bridges promote this process and resistive bridges impede it. The third chapter presents a series of bench-scale experiments performed to evaluate the geometry of a pendular bridge under different flow rates through it and at different inclinations. Results show that bridge size increases in a nonlinear fashion with flow rate and decreases with inclination from vertical. The vertical profile of the bridge closely resembled a parabola in all experiments, in contrast to the profile of a static bridge that resembles the arc of a circle. Bridge geometry was independent of flow history. Flow is active through the entire volume of the bridge and exhibits non-laminar characteristics. The fourth chapter describes a series of bench-scale experiments designed to explore the influence of matrix-to-matrix <b>hydraulic</b> <b>connections</b> on two-dimensional transient wetting of a porous matrix. Cross-sectional area of the connection (Ar) relative to that of the matrix block and location of the connection relative to edges of the block were varied between trials. Results show that the rate of imbibition into the porous block nonlinearly increases with Ar. Moving the connection towards an edge of the block significantly decreases the imbibition rate. Saturation increase of the matrix block before the wetting front reaches all edges remains consistent independent of the connection. The last chapter summarizes results of the research and discusses about future research on this topic...|$|E
