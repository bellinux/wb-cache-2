25|$|A {{borrowed}} chord is {{one from}} a different key than the home key, the key of the piece it is used in. The most common occurrence of this is where a chord from the parallel major or minor key is used. Particularly good examples can be found throughout the works of composers such as Schubert. For instance, for a composer working in the C major key, a major III chord (e.g., an E major chord) would be borrowed, as this chord appears only in the C minor key. Although borrowed chords could theoretically include chords taken from any key other than the home key, this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>how</b> the term is used when a chord is described in formal musical analysis.|$|E
25|$|In {{order for}} the infant {{to feel that the}} {{maternal}} figure is accessible and responsive, a certain amount of interaction must occur. Though the most research has been done on face-to-face interaction, studies have found that bodily interaction is also important in sensitivity and development. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>how</b> often the baby is held that reflects attachment, but how the baby is held and whether or not the baby desires to be held that matters in attachment development. Another factor that is important is sensitivity to the infant's feeding signals. There lies some controversy in whether infants who form insecure attachment relationships with their mothers do so because the mother is particularly insensitive to her child's needs or because of differences in their personality (i.e. their temperament) and due to life situations.|$|E

500|$|According to Tolkien, [...] "the inflections of [...] verbs {{are always}} pretty regular", and Quenya verbs are {{either in a}} {{personal}} form or an impersonal form. Usually in linguistics, an impersonal verb is a verb that cannot take a true subject, {{because it does not}} represent an action, occurrence, or state-of-being of any specific person, place, or thing. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>how</b> Tolkien intended the use of [...] "impersonal." [...] An impersonal verb form is a verb to which no pronoun has been attached, as carë (sg.) or carir (pl.); carin, [...] "I do (habitually)", is a personal form (with -n, a short suffix for [...] "I, me"). As explained by Tolkien, verbs in Quenya are negated by using a [...] "negative verb" [...] ua- in front of the proper verb in the impersonal tense form.|$|E

[...] In contrast to Ciment's reading of a cut to a serene [...] "other extreme of civilization", science fiction novelist Robert Sawyer, speaking in the Canadian documentary 2001 and Beyond, saw it as a cut from a bone to a nuclear weapons platform, explaining that [...] "what we see <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>how</b> far we've leaped ahead, what we see is that today, '2001', and four million years ago on the African veldt, it's exactly the same—the power of mankind is the power of its weapons.

500|$|Unlike the {{previous}} execution of John Albert Taylor in 1996 (or Ronnie Lee Gardner {{that would follow}} in 2010), Parsons' execution attracted little media attention, with representatives from only 12 news organizations. Spokesperson Jack Ford called the level of interest virtually [...] "nonexistent". Deputy attorney general Reed Richards presumed that the media apathy {{was a result of}} Parsons' choice of lethal injection, which was more broadly adopted in the United States than execution by firing squad, which was unique to Utah. Parsons' court-appointed attorney Greg Sanders said that his client called himself [...] "Utah's forgotten inmate". Ernest's widow Beverley, who attended the execution, said that she was grateful for the lack of media scrutiny. Ernest's brother-in-law Jonathan Woods stated, [...] "The world is less for having lost Richard.

500|$|Although {{music and}} sound effects were kept from the {{original}} recording sessions, original master recordings {{have been used to}} update the soundtrack at much higher quality; the original recording size was 16MB, while in the remaster it is over 250MB. Developers also decided to retain the free aim mode because they wanted to be faithful to the original game. According to Rare's Producer Nick Ferguson, [...] "We didn't change the fundamental behavior of the aiming system simply because that <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>how</b> Perfect Dark was played". He also observed that the idea of updating the controls was actually seen as a flaw in Perfect Dark Zero, which tried to [...] "combine the original Perfect Dark system with aspects of Halo". The original diagonal running, which allows players to move faster than by running forwards or sideways alone, did not work the first time they implemented the analog stick, so it was manually rewritten as it was considered essential for speedruns and achieving some of the target times required to unlock cheats.|$|E

Nair {{noted in}} his review for Kerala9.com, [...] "The care with which the script is done, the finesse with which the {{direction}} part is executed and the characterization and performance plus the thoughtful placing of the songs makes Drishyam worth real appreciation. That the film has almost zero-'filmy' humour is also worth noting. It's the logical {{manner in which the}} story unfolds and the very convincing manner in which the characters behave makes it impressive." [...] The critic rated the film three in a scale of five. IndiaGlitz's reviewer rated the film 8/10 and stated, [...] "Drishyam is undoubtedly cladded with exceptional story telling combined with bravura performances. An undoubtedly exceptional film as far the content is concerned, the movie is a must watch for all the audiences of family and thriller movies." [...] In contrast, Gautaman Bhaskaran of Hindustan Times wrote, [...] "Scripted more or less in a convincing manner and mounted with finesse, writer-director Joseph fleshes out his characters. However, Drishyam often seems like a radio play, long dialogues mar its cinematic qualities, and like many other helmers, Joseph too does not know where to end his film. Cinema need not be so explanatory; certainly this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>how</b> contemporary movies are made.|$|E

On June 7, the album was leaked onto the Internet in full; Beyoncé's legal representatives issued warnings to infringing websites and leaked tracks were soon removed from such sites. On June 9, Beyoncé responded to the leak through Facebook, commenting, [...] "My music was leaked and while this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>how</b> I wanted to present my new songs, I appreciate the positive response from my fans. When I record music I always think about my fans singing every note and dancing to every beat. I make music to make people happy and I appreciate that everyone has been so anxious to hear my new songs." [...] Following the leak, reports circulated that Columbia Records executives hoped to cover their assets in fear that the album may be a commercial failure. Rumors had suggested that the label requested from Beyoncé to make changes to the record and reunite Destiny's Child, claims Columbia denied. In August 2013, NME reported that Sony Music were suing a 47-year-old man from Gothenburg for US$233,000 concerning the leak of 4. The deluxe version was released simultaneously with the standard edition in several countries. In the United States, it was available exclusively through Target stores.|$|E

500|$|Friedman {{defended his}} {{activity}} in Chile {{on the grounds}} that, in his opinion, the adoption of free market policies not only improved the economic situation of Chile but {{also contributed to the}} amelioration of Pinochet's rule and to the eventual transition to a democratic government during 1990. That idea is included in Capitalism and Freedom, in which he declared that economic freedom is not only desirable in itself but is also a necessary condition for political freedom. In his 1980 documentary Free to Choose, he said the following: [...] "Chile is not a politically free system, and I do not condone the system. But the people there are freer than the people in Communist societies because government plays a smaller role. ...The conditions {{of the people in the}} past few years has been getting better and not worse. They would be still better to get rid of the junta and to be able to have a free democratic system." [...] In 1984, Friedman stated that he has [...] "never refrained from criticizing the political system in Chile." [...] In 1991 he said: [...] "I have nothing good to say about the political regime that Pinochet imposed. It was a terrible political regime. The real miracle of Chile <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>how</b> well it has done economically; the real miracle of Chile is that a military junta was willing to go against its principles and support a free market regime designed by principled believers in a free market. [...] In Chile, the drive for political freedom, that was generated by economic freedom and the resulting economic success, ultimately resulted in a referendum that introduced political democracy. Now, at long last, Chile has all three things: political freedom, human freedom and economic freedom. Chile will continue to be an interesting experiment to watch to see whether it can keep all three or whether, now that it has political freedom, that political freedom will tend to be used to destroy or reduce economic freedom." [...] He stressed that the lectures he gave in Chile were the same lectures he later gave in China and other socialist states.|$|E
