5000|$|Due to the {{twisting}} or cam {{action of the}} socket on a bolt or nut head, {{nearly all of the}} torque is applied at or near the corners <b>of</b> the <b>nut</b> or bolt. Whether one uses either a twelve or six point socket the same stresses are applied in the same locations. Under load, nearly all <b>of</b> the <b>flats</b> <b>of</b> the <b>nut</b> are not touching the socket at all, it is only a small amount of the surfaces near the fastener corners which bears the torque loads. In nearly all applications over-stressing a bolt or nut will result in stripping the bolt or nut threads or breaking the bolt long before the socket will break. Tougher, thicker impact sockets are made for impact gun use. Occasionally when the corners of a bolt head or nut begin to become worn or damaged, the material the nut is made from can eventually smear or tear under load and create a situation where the corners are effectively [...] "rounded off". Some socket users believe that six point sockets are less likely to damage a fastener head, but tool evaluations and lab tests document that there is no difference in performance. A distorted or corroded fastener head may not fit a six-point socket but a twelve-point socket can be made to fit. When a fastener head is [...] "rounded off" [...] the nut or bolt can often no longer be turned without special repair or extraction tools. These rounded-off heads can incur substantial penalties, both direct and indirect. Deteriorated fasteners often inhibit the routine assembly and disassembly of the host components that rely on them, which can in turn deter users from performing normal maintenance procedures. Addressing the problem may require cost and effort, and potentially sidelining valuable equipment until the component's damaged fasteners have been replaced.|$|R

The development <b>of</b> <b>nut</b> spreads would potentially increase the food uses <b>of</b> <b>nuts</b> and introduce consumers with a healthier, non-animal breakfast snack food. Nut spreads are spreadable products made from nuts that are ground into paste. Roasting and milling (particle size reduction) are two important stages for the production <b>of</b> <b>nut</b> spreads that affected the textural, rheological characteristic and overall quality <b>of</b> the <b>nut</b> spread.

40|$|Nuts, {{inflammation}} and insulin resistanceThe beneficial effects <b>of</b> <b>nut</b> consumption on cardiovascular disease (CVD) {{have been widely}} documented. These protective effects are mainly attributed to the role <b>of</b> <b>nuts</b> in the metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins. As chronic inflammation is a key early stage in the atherosclerotic process that predicts future CVD events and {{is closely related to}} the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, many recent studies have focused on the potential effect <b>of</b> <b>nut</b> consumption on {{inflammation and}} insulin resistance. Through different mechanisms, some components <b>of</b> <b>nuts</b> such as magnesium, fiber, alpha-linolenic acid, L-arginine, antioxidants and MUFA may protect against inflammation and insulin resistance.

40|$|Black rats (Rattus rattus) cause {{extensive}} damage in Hawaiian macadamia (Macadamia integrifolia) orchards. In a previous study, extensive and persistent snap trapping significantly reduced rat populations and depredations on developing macadamia nuts, but {{had little effect}} on subsequent yields <b>of</b> mature <b>nuts.</b> This suggested that macadamia trees may compensate for rat damage, and that commonly used indices based on rodent activity and proportion <b>of</b> <b>nuts</b> damaged may overestimate the impact of rodent depredations and exaggerate the effectiveness of control measures. To clarify the effects of rat feeding on developing macadamia <b>nuts,</b> two levels <b>of</b> damage at two times during nut development and evaluated yields <b>of</b> mature <b>nuts</b> were simulated. Both number <b>of</b> <b>nuts</b> per raceme (P = 0. 0001) and total weight of mature kernels per raceme (P = 0. 0001), but not mean weight per mature kernel (P = 0. 90), varied among treatments.

Time during nut development that damage was simulated had no apparent effect (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) on yields. These results indicate that racemes did not compensate for damage by retaining other nuts on the same raceme that might otherwise have dropped prematurely. A variance component analysis was also conducted to determine how best to sample the orchard in a practical fashion while minimizing potential sources of bias and retaining sensitivity for distinguishing among treatment effects.
