5|$|Bigfin reef squids exhibit strong {{positive}} phototactic behaviour (attraction to light) {{and will}} move readily {{within a certain}} distance of a light source. Studies have proposed {{that this might be}} an involuntary stimulus behaviour, as the squids immediately stop all other movements once a light source is switched on. The colour of the light <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>matter,</b> but {{it has been shown that}} they react more strongly to underwater lights between the intensities of 1.5 to 2.5lx, with peak ranges of 2.5 to 10.0lx.|$|E
5|$|A ring likewise, has {{a set of}} elements, but now has two {{operation}}s. The first operation {{must make}} the set a group, and the second operation is associative and distributive {{with respect to the}} first operation. It {{may or may not be}} commutative; this means that the result of applying the operation to a first and a second element is the same as to the second and first—the order of the elements <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>matter.</b> If every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse (an element x such that ax = xa = 1), the ring is called a division ring. A field is defined as a commutative division ring.|$|E

5|$|In 'Nothing Really Matters' and 'The Power of Good-Bye', I {{want people}} to have a visceral and {{emotional}} reaction to things, rather than to have in their mind where all my stuff comes from. With the songs, I {{wanted to say that}} it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>matter</b> really what you think or do, just think by yourself, and not judge and dissect others. You know if I see a bug crawling across the floor and it inspired me to write the most incredible love poem, I don't {{want people to}} be thinking about their relationship, and then think of my bug crawling across the floor. It's then that the power of good-bye becomes better than the power of acceptance.|$|E
5|$|The Bearded Man {{demands that}} Fassl kill Fain, beating him {{up when he}} doesn't comply. As she tends to Fassl, Fain first sees the Bearded Man in his place. While staking out Fain's house, the agents see the Bearded Man flee. Doggett pursues the Bearded Man while Reyes finds Fain alive. In the pursuit, Reyes falls through into a sewer, where she finds {{the remains of the}} Bearded Man's victims. After a {{struggle}} with the Bearded Man who is holding Doggett at knife point, Reyes shoots. The Bearded Man falls into the water and Doggett goes after him, only to pull up Fassl, much to his confusion. Reyes tries to remind him that it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>matter</b> as long as the case is solved.|$|E
5|$|Yusef first appears when Afia {{introduces}} him to {{her boyfriend}} Tamwar Masood (Himesh Patel). Tamwar feels he {{is not good enough}} for Afia in Yusef's eyes as he is from a poor background, but Yusef says that <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>matter</b> and approves of Tamwar. After Tamwar mentions his mother Zainab Masood's name, Yusef visits the Masood home and finds the door open. When Zainab sees him, she screams and orders him out. It is revealed they were husband and wife from an arranged marriage when Yusef was 17, and Yusef's family had poured oil on her and set her on fire. Yusef says it was his family, not him, and he attempted to save her, revealing bad scarring on his body. Tamwar's father Masood Ahmed, Tamwar and Afia return home, and Masood attacks Yusef, punching him twice. After Yusef returns, Tamwar asks Masood to speak to Yusef, and when he visits, he finds out Tamwar and Afia are still seeing each other. He gives his blessing for them to be married.|$|E
