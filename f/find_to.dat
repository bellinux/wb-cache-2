5|$|On October 10, 2011the {{day before}} Chandler's 65th birthdayFlorida Governor Rick Scott signed Chandler's death warrant. His {{execution}} {{was set for}} November 15, 2011, at 4:00pm. His lawyer, Baya Harrison, said that Chandler asked him not to file any frivolous appeals to keep him alive. Harrison said: He is not {{putting a lot of}} pressure on me to go running around at the end to find some magic way out. He is not going to make a scene. He's not going to bemoan the legal system. What he has told me is this: if there is some legal way that I can <b>find</b> <b>to</b> try to prevent him from being executed, he would like me to do what I reasonably can. Harrison also said that Chandler suffered from high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, problems with his kidneys and arthritis.|$|E

5|$|The helmet was {{discovered}} by 71-year-old Ken Wallace, a retired teacher and amateur archaeologist. He {{and other members of}} the Hallaton Fieldwork Group had found fragments of Roman pottery on a hill near Hallaton in 2000. He visited the site with a second-hand metal detector late one afternoon and found about 200 coins, which had been buried in a series of small pits dug into the clay. He also found another artifact, which he left in the ground overnight. The following day he returned to examine his discovery and found it that it was a silver ear. He reported the <b>find</b> <b>to</b> Leicestershire's county archaeologist, who called in the University of Leicester Archaeological Services (ULAS) to excavate the site. The dig took place in the spring of 2003.|$|E
5|$|While Cagney was in New York, his brother, who had {{effectively}} {{become his}} agent, angled {{for a substantial}} pay raise and more personal freedom for his brother. The success of The Public Enemy and Blonde Crazy forced Warner Bros.' hand. They eventually offered Cagney a contract for $1000 a week. Cagney's first film upon returning from New York was 1932's Taxi!. The film is notable for not only being {{the first time that}} Cagney danced on screen, but it was also the last time he allowed himself to be shot at with live ammunition (a relatively common occurrence at the time, as blank cartridges and squibs were considered too expensive and hard to <b>find</b> <b>to</b> use in most motion picture filming). He had been shot at in The Public Enemy, but during filming for Taxi!, he was almost hit.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous of all Arabian {{breeding}} operations founded in Europe was the Crabbet Park Stud of England, founded 1878. Starting in 1877, Wilfrid Scawen Blunt and Lady Anne Blunt made repeated journeys to the Middle East, including visits to the stud of Ali Pasha Sherif in Egypt and to Bedouin tribes in the Nejd, bringing the best Arabians they could <b>find</b> <b>to</b> England. Lady Anne also purchased and maintained the Sheykh Obeyd stud farm in Egypt, near Cairo. Upon Lady Anne's death in 1917, the Blunts' daughter, Judith, Lady Wentworth, inherited the Wentworth title and Lady Anne's portion of the estate, and obtained the remainder of the Crabbet Stud following a protracted legal battle with her father. Lady Wentworth expanded the stud, added new bloodstock, and exported Arabian horses worldwide. Upon her death in 1957, the stud passed to her manager, Cecil Covey, who ran Crabbet until 1971, when a motorway was cut through the property, forcing the sale of the land and dispersal of the horses. Along with Crabbet, the Hanstead Stud of Lady Yule also produced horses of worldwide significance.|$|E

The brothers applied themselves to that purpose as directed and did not stake a claim.
