25|$|Johanna Beyer {{was born}} in Leipzig, Germany, but very {{little is known about}} her life prior to her move to the United States in 1923. She sang for three years at the Leipziger Singakademie and {{graduated}} from the Deutscher Konservatorien and Musikseminare, having studied piano, <b>harmony,</b> <b>theory,</b> counterpoint, singing, and dancing. Colleagues in New York recalled that her pianism and musicianship were excellent and that her musical training seemed traditional and solid. She spent 1911–1914 in America, though nothing is known of her activities during those years. Returning to the U.S. in 1923 (according to the biographical notes she provided in a Composers' Forum concert program), she studied at the Mannes College of Music, receiving two degrees by 1928. She taught piano to support herself, and may have taught at Greenwich House Music School, but struggled to make ends meet, resorting at times to WPA work and Ladies Home Aid. In the late 1920s or early thirties she began studying with Ruth Crawford, Charles Seeger, and Dane Rudhyar and in 1934 took Henry Cowell's percussion class at the New School for Social Research. Her musical life during these years was intertwined with Seeger, Crawford, Cowell, John Cage, and others in this modernist circle such as Jessie Baetz, a now-forgotten composer and painter who studied with Beyer. Her most intimate friendship was with Cowell; surviving correspondence reveals a tumultuous, and possibly romantic, relationship between the two composers. Beyer acted as Cowell's informal agent and secretary from 1936 to 1941 on a voluntary basis (only receiving partial compensation in 1941).|$|E
500|$|Janáček {{created his}} music theory works, essays and {{articles}} {{over a period}} of fifty years, from 1877 to 1927. He wrote and edited the Hudební listy journal, and contributed to many specialist music journals, such as Cecílie, Hlídka and Dalibor. He also completed several extensive studies, as Úplná nauka o harmonii (The Complete <b>Harmony</b> <b>Theory),</b> O skladbě souzvukův a jejich spojův (On the Construction of Chords and Their Connections) and Základy hudebního sčasování (Basics of Musical Sčasování). In his essays and books, Janáček examined various musical topics, forms, melody and harmony theories, dyad and triad chords, counterpoint (or [...] "opora", meaning [...] "support") and devoted himself {{to the study of the}} mental composition. His theoretical works stress the Czech term [...] "sčasování", Janáček's specific word for rhythm, which has relation to time ("čas" [...] in Czech), and the handling of time in music composition. He distinguished several types of rhythm (sčasovka): [...] "znící" [...] (sounding) – meaning any rhythm, [...] "čítací" [...] (counting) – meaning smaller units measuring the course of rhythm; and [...] "scelovací" [...] (summing) – a long value comprising the length of a rhythmical unit. Janáček used the combination of their mutual action widely in his own works.|$|E
2500|$|Copland {{began writing}} songs {{at the age}} of eight and a half. His {{earliest}} notated music, about seven bars he wrote when age 11, was for an opera scenario he created and called Zenatello. From 1913 to 1917 he took piano lessons with Leopold Wolfsohn, who taught him the standard classical fare. Copland's first public music performance was at a Wanamaker's recital. By the age of 15, after attending a concert by composer-pianist Ignacy Jan Paderewski, Copland decided to become a composer. After attempts to further his music study from a correspondence course, Copland took formal lessons in <b>harmony,</b> <b>theory,</b> and composition from Rubin Goldmark, a noted teacher and composer of American music (who had given George Gershwin three lessons). Goldmark, with whom Copland studied between 1917 and 1921, gave the young Copland a solid foundation, especially in the Germanic tradition. As Copland stated later: [...] "This was a stroke of luck for me. I was spared the floundering that so many musicians have suffered through incompetent teaching." [...] But Copland also commented that the maestro had [...] "little sympathy for the advanced musical idioms of the day" [...] and his [...] "approved" [...] composers ended with Richard Strauss.|$|E

5000|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, Tímea Papp {{growing up}} has been surrounded by inspiration which drew her towards dancing.

Her body awareness in space became very important to her. Rudolf von Laban movement theoretic's space <b>harmony</b> <b>theory</b> {{has been a great}} influence on her work.

The year he graduated from high school, Klemmer was signed by producer Esmond Edwards at Cadet/Chess Records, eventually recording five albums with Cadet/Chess, including his innovative hit album, Blowin Gold (co-produced by ex-Rolling Stones producer Marshall Chess). This album was considered {{by many as the}} first of the jazz/rock fusion genre; follow-up albums introduced innovative rock rhythms, sounds and production techniques and debuted electronic effects with the saxophone that became his now trademark delay sound.|$|E

40|$|The <b>harmony</b> {{restoration}} <b>theory</b> {{of health}} (HRT) is an existential phenomenological theory {{of health and}} ill health from an African perspective. The theory emanated from years of clinical practice of Peter Ebigbo in the mid 90 s has its basic tenet, "he who is at peace with his world does not fall sick" {{and this is the}} root from which all other tenets of the <b>harmony</b> restoration <b>theory</b> stems. The <b>harmony</b> restoration <b>theory</b> of health was borne out of the African concept of illness. In Africa, the mind, the body and the society interact to produce health and ill-health. From clinical practice, it was observed that the African personality has three components, namely: the endocosmos, which is the relationship between the individual and himself; the mesocosmos, the relationship between the individual and the significant others in his environment; and the exocosmos, the relationship between the individual and his God or gods. This paper examines the HRT, traces its origin from the African traditional and contemporary religion, the sociocultural, personological aspect of its derivation, its development and how it is applied in the treatment of psychological disturbances as well as in maintaining positive health. It also examines two case studies where the harmony restoration therapy was used and lastly, makes a case for its further exploration by other health care practitioners...|$|R

A basic mathematical equation for the harmony degree, that is, a quantitative expression of harmony issues, is introduced in the paper: HD=ai[*]−[*]bj, where a is the uniform degree, b is the difference degree, i is the harmony coefficient, and j is the disharmony coefficient.
