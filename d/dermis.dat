5|$|Dermal and {{subcutaneous}} growths {{result from}} (1) reactive or neoplastic proliferation of cellular {{components of the}} <b>dermis</b> or subcutaneous tissue, or (2) neoplasms invading or aberrantly present in the <b>dermis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Conditions of the {{subcutaneous}} fat are those affecting {{the layer of}} adipose tissue that lies between the <b>dermis</b> and underlying fascia.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{another study}} was {{published}} describing the integument and <b>dermis</b> of Psittacosaurus sp., {{from two different}} specimens. The skin remains could be observed by a natural cross-section to compare them to modern animals, showing that dinosaurian dermal layers evolved in parallel to those in many other large vertebrates. The collagen tissue fibres in Psittacosaurus are complex, virtually identical to all other vertebrates in structure but having an exceptional thickness of about forty layers. As the sections of <b>dermis</b> were collected from the abdomen, where the scales were eroded, the tissue may have assisted with the musculature of the stomach and intestines and offered protection against predators.|$|E
5|$|Vascular-related {{cutaneous}} conditions {{result from}} dysfunction {{of the blood}} or {{blood vessels in the}} <b>dermis,</b> or lymphatics in the subcutaneous tissues.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species have}} bony plates {{embedded}} in their skin, a trait {{that appears to}} have evolved independently several times. In certain other species, the skin {{at the top of the}} head is compacted and the connective tissue of the <b>dermis</b> is co-ossified with the bones of the skull (exostosis).|$|E
5|$|The {{outermost}} {{layer of}} the body has no cuticle but consists of a ciliated and glandular epithelium containing rhabdites, which form the mucus in which the cilia glide. Each ciliated cell has many cilia and microvilli. The outermost layer rests on a thickened basement membrane, the <b>dermis.</b> Next to the <b>dermis</b> {{are at least three}} layers of muscles, some circular and some longitudinal. The combinations of muscle types vary between the different classes, but these are not associated with differences in movement. Nemerteans also have dorso-ventral muscles, which flatten the animals, especially in the larger species. Inside the concentric tubes of these layers is mesenchyme, a kind of connective tissue. In pelagic species this tissue is gelatinous and buoyant.|$|E
5|$|Atrophic acne scars {{have lost}} {{collagen}} from the healing response {{and are the}} most common type of acne scar (account for approximately 75% of all acne scars). They may be further classified as ice-pick scars, boxcar scars, and rolling scars. Ice-pick scars are narrow (less than 2mm across), deep scars that extend into the <b>dermis.</b> Boxcar scars are round or ovoid indented scars with sharp borders and vary in size from 1.5–4mm across. Rolling scars are wider than icepick and boxcar scars (4–5mm across) and have a wave-like pattern of depth in the skin.|$|E
5|$|Reptiles {{evolved from}} amphibious {{ancestors}} which left the aquatic lifestyle and became terrestrial. To prevent loss of moisture reptilian skin lost the softness and moisture of amphibian skin {{and developing a}} thick stratum corneum with multiple layers of lipids which served as an impermeable barrier as well as provided protection from the ultraviolet. Over time, reptilian skin cells became highly keratinised, horny, sturdy and desiccated. The surfaces of the <b>dermis</b> and epidermis of all reptilian scales form a single contiguous sheet, {{as can be seen}} when the snake sheds its skin as a whole.|$|E
5|$|This {{inflammatory}} cascade typically {{leads to}} the formation of inflammatory acne lesions, including papules, infected pustules, or nodules. If the inflammatory reaction is severe, the follicle can break into the deeper layers of the <b>dermis</b> and subcutaneous tissue and cause the formation of deep nodules. Involvement of AP-1 in the aforementioned inflammatory cascade leads to activation of matrix metalloproteinases, which contribute to local tissue destruction and scar formation.|$|E
5|$|Turtles are {{notable for}} their {{protective}} shells. They have an inflexible trunk {{encased in a}} horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the <b>dermis</b> which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth {{have been replaced by}} sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.|$|E
5|$|By {{the sixth}} or seventh day, all the skin lesions have become pustules. Between seven and ten days the pustules matured and reached their maximum size. The pustules were sharply raised, {{typically}} round, tense, and {{firm to the}} touch. The pustules were deeply embedded in the <b>dermis,</b> giving them {{the feel of a}} small bead in the skin. Fluid slowly leaked from the pustules, {{and by the end of}} the second week the pustules deflated, and started to dry up, forming crusts (or scabs). By day 16–20 scabs had formed over all the lesions, which have started to flake off, leaving depigmented scars.|$|E
5|$|Chemical peels {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} the {{appearance}} of acne scars. Mild peels include those using glycolic acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, Jessner's solution, or a lower concentrations (20%) of trichloroacetic acid. These peels only affect the epidermal layer of the skin and can be useful in the treatment of superficial acne scars as well as skin pigmentation changes from inflammatory acne. Higher concentrations of trichloroacetic acid (30–40%) are considered to be medium-strength peels and affect skin as deep as the papillary <b>dermis.</b> Formulations of trichloroacetic acid concentrated to 50% or more are considered to be deep chemical peels. Medium-strength and deep-strength chemical peels are more effective for deeper atrophic scars, but are more likely to cause side effects such as skin pigmentation changes, infection, and small white superficial cysts known as milia.|$|E
5|$|Dendritic cells {{bridge the}} {{innate immune system}} and {{adaptive}} immune system. They are increased in psoriatic lesions and induce the proliferation of T cells and type 1 helper T cells (Th1). Targeted immunotherapy as well as psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy can {{reduce the number of}} dendritic cells and favors a Th2 cell cytokine secretion pattern over a Th1/Th17 cell cytokine profile. Psoriatic T cells move from the <b>dermis</b> into the epidermis and secrete interferon-γ and interleukin-17. Interleukin-23 is known to induce the production of interleukin-17 and interleukin-22. Interleukin-22 works in combination with interleukin-17 to induce keratinocytes to secrete neutrophil-attracting cytokines.|$|E
5|$|Sharks and {{rays are}} basal fish with {{numerous}} primitive anatomical features {{similar to those}} of ancient fish, including skeletons composed of cartilage. Their bodies tend to be dorso-ventrally flattened, they usually have five pairs of gill slits and a large mouth set {{on the underside of the}} head. The <b>dermis</b> is covered with separate dermal placoid scales. They have a cloaca into which the urinary and genital passages open, but not a swim bladder. Cartilaginous fish produce a small number of large, yolky eggs. Some species are ovoviviparous and the young develop internally but others are oviparous and the larvae develop externally in egg cases.|$|E
5|$|The bony fish lineage shows more derived {{anatomical}} traits, {{often with}} major evolutionary changes from {{the features of}} ancient fish. They have a bony skeleton, are generally laterally flattened, have five pairs of gills protected by an operculum, and a mouth {{at or near the}} tip of the snout. The <b>dermis</b> is covered with overlapping scales. Bony fish have a swim bladder which helps them maintain a constant depth in the water column, but not a cloaca. They mostly spawn a large number of small eggs with little yolk which they broadcast into the water column.|$|E
5|$|If the {{clinical}} diagnosis is uncertain, a skin biopsy or scraping may be performed {{to rule out}} other disorders and to confirm the diagnosis. Skin from a biopsy will show clubbed epidermal projections that interdigitate with <b>dermis</b> on microscopy. Epidermal thickening is another characteristic histologic finding of psoriasis lesions. The stratum granulosum layer of the epidermis is often missing or significantly decreased in psoriatic lesions; the skin cells from the most superficial layer of skin are also abnormal as they never fully mature. Unlike their mature counterparts, these superficial cells keep their nucleus. Inflammatory infiltrates can typically be visualized on microscopy when examining skin tissue or joint tissue affected by psoriasis. Epidermal skin tissue affected by psoriatic inflammation often has many CD8+ T cells while a predominance of CD4+ T cells makes up the inflammatory infiltrates of the dermal layer of skin and the joints.|$|E
5|$|While a starfish lacks a {{centralized}} brain, {{it has a}} complex nervous system with a nerve ring around the mouth and a radial nerve running along the ambulacral region of each arm parallel to the radial canal. The peripheral nerve system consists of two nerve nets: a sensory system in the epidermis and a motor system in {{the lining of the}} coelomic cavity. Neurons passing through the <b>dermis</b> connect the two. The ring nerves and radial nerves have sensory and motor components and coordinate the starfish's balance and directional systems. The sensory component receives input from the sensory organs while the motor nerves control the tube feet and musculature. The starfish does not have the capacity to plan its actions. If one arm detects an attractive odour, it becomes dominant and temporarily over-rides the other arms to initiate movement towards the prey. The mechanism for this is not fully understood.|$|E
5|$|Hydroquinone lightens {{the skin}} when applied topically by {{inhibiting}} tyrosinase, the enzyme responsible for converting the amino acid tyrosine {{to the skin}} pigment melanin, and is used to treat acne-associated postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. By interfering with new production of melanin in the epidermis, hydroquinone leads to less hyperpigmentation as darkened skin cells are naturally shed over time. Improvement in skin hyperpigmentation is typically seen within six months when used twice daily. Hydroquinone is ineffective for hyperpigmentation affecting deeper layers of skin such as the <b>dermis.</b> The use of a sunscreen with SPF15 or higher {{in the morning with}} reapplication every two hours is recommended when using hydroquinone. Its application only to affected areas lowers the risk of lightening the color of normal skin but can lead to a temporary ring of lightened skin around the hyperpigmented area. Hydroquinone is generally well-tolerated; side effects are typically mild (e.g., skin irritation) and occur with use of a higher than the recommended 4% concentration. Most preparations contain the preservative sodium metabisulfite, which has been linked to rare cases of allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and severe asthma exacerbations in susceptible people. In extremely rare cases, repeated improper topical application of high-dose hydroquinone has been associated with an accumulation of homogentisic acid in connective tissues, a condition known as exogenous ochronosis.|$|E
5|$|The patagium is {{the wing}} membrane. The patagium is {{stretched}} between {{the arm and}} hand bones, down the lateral {{side of the body}} and down to the hind limbs. This skin membrane consists of connective tissue, elastic fibers, nerves, muscles, and blood vessels. The muscles keep the membrane taut during flight. The skin on the body of the bat, which has one layer of epidermis and <b>dermis,</b> as well as the presence of hair follicles, sweat glands and a fatty subcutaneous layer, {{is very different from the}} skin of the wing membrane. The patagium is an extremely thin double layer of epidermis; these layers are separated by a connective tissue center, rich with collagen and elastic fibers. The membrane has no hair follicles or sweat glands, except between the fingers. Unlike birds whose stiff wings deliver bending and torsional stress to the shoulders, bats have a flexible wing membrane which can only resist tension. To achieve flight, a bat exerts force inwards at the points where the membrane meets the skeleton, so that an opposing force balances it on the wing edges perpendicular to the wing surface. However, this adaptation does not permit bats to reduce their wingspan as birds do, which means they cannot travel over long distances like birds can.|$|E
25|$|Tattoo ink {{is held in}} the <b>dermis.</b> Stretch marks {{often from}} {{pregnancy}} and obesity, are also located in the <b>dermis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The skin envelope. The breast skin is {{in three}} (3) layers: (i) the {{epidermis}}, (ii) the <b>dermis,</b> and (iii) the hypodermis. The epidermis is 50–100µm thick, and {{is composed of}} a stratum corneum of flat keratin cells, that is 10–20µm thick; it protects the underlying viable epidermis, which is composed of keratinizing epithelial cells. The <b>dermis</b> is mostly collagen and elastin ﬁbers embedded to a viscous water and glycoprotein medium. The fibers of the upper <b>dermis</b> (“papillary dermis”) are thinner than the fibers of the deep <b>dermis,</b> thus the skin envelope is 1–3mm thick. The thickness of the hypodermis (adipocyte cells) varies from woman to woman, and body part.|$|E
25|$|The <b>dermis</b> is {{the layer}} of skin beneath the {{epidermis}} that consists of epithelial tissue and cushions the body from stress and strain. The <b>dermis</b> is tightly connected to the epidermis by a basement membrane. It also harbors many nerve endings that provide the sense of touch and heat. It contains the hair follicles, sweat glands, sebaceous glands, apocrine glands, lymphatic vessels and blood vessels. The {{blood vessels in the}} <b>dermis</b> provide nourishment and waste removal from its own cells {{as well as from the}} Stratum basale of the epidermis.|$|E
25|$|The skin envelope. The breast skin is {{in three}} (3) layers: (i) the {{epidermis}}, (ii) the <b>dermis,</b> and (iii) the hypodermis.

The thickness of the hypodermis (adipocyte cells) varies from woman to woman, and body part. The skin of the nipple and areola is further composed of a modified and specialized myoepthelium {{that is responsible for}} contraction in response to stimuli.|$|E
25|$|Tattooing {{involves}} {{the placement of}} pigment into the skin's <b>dermis,</b> the layer of dermal tissue underlying the epidermis. After initial injection, pigment is dispersed throughout a homogenized damaged layer down through the epidermis and upper <b>dermis,</b> in both of which the presence of foreign material activates the immune system's phagocytes to engulf the pigment particles. As healing proceeds, the damaged epidermis flakes away (eliminating surface pigment) while deeper in the skin granulation tissue forms, which is later converted to connective tissue by collagen growth. This mends the upper <b>dermis,</b> where pigment remains trapped within fibroblasts, ultimately concentrating in a layer just below the dermis/epidermis boundary. Its presence there is stable, {{but in the long}} term (decades) the pigment tends to migrate deeper into the <b>dermis,</b> accounting for the degraded detail of old tattoos.|$|E
25|$|For {{people with}} very light skin, the skin gets {{most of its}} colour from the bluish-white {{connective}} tissue in the <b>dermis</b> and from the haemoglobin associated blood cells circulating in the capillaries of the <b>dermis.</b> The colour associated with the circulating haemoglobin become more obvious, especially in the face, when arterioles dilate and become tumefied with blood {{as a result of}} prolonged physical exercise or stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system (usually embarrassment or anger). Up to 50% of UVA can penetrate deeply into the <b>dermis</b> in persons with light skin pigmentation with little protective melanin pigment.|$|E
25|$|Skin is {{composed}} of three primary layers: the epidermis, the <b>dermis</b> and the hypodermis.|$|E
25|$|Intradermal nevus: the nevus {{cells are}} located in the <b>dermis</b> only. Intradermal nevi are raised; most are flesh-colored (not pigmented).|$|E
25|$|The <b>dermis</b> is {{the layer}} of skin beneath the {{epidermis}} that consists of connective tissue and cushions the body from stress and strain.|$|E
25|$|The {{epidermis}} and <b>dermis</b> {{are separated}} by a thin sheet of fibers called the basement membrane, and is made through the action of both tissues.|$|E
25|$|Carotene: This pigment is {{yellow to}} orange in color. It {{is present in}} the stratum corneum and fat cells of <b>dermis</b> and {{superficial}} fascia.|$|E
25|$|Asian {{people and}} black {{people have a}} thicker <b>dermis</b> than white people. The skin of Asian people and black people also has more sun {{protection}} than the skin of white people due to Asian people and black people having larger and more numerous melanosomes in their skin than white people. The thicker <b>dermis</b> and the more numerous melanosomes of larger size might be the reasons that Asian people and black people have a lower incidence facial wrinkles than white people.|$|E
25|$|When {{the tumor}} cells start {{to move in}} a {{different}} direction — vertically up into the epidermis and into the papillary <b>dermis</b> — cell behaviour changes dramatically.|$|E
25|$|The {{epidermis}} {{contains no}} blood vessels, and {{cells in the}} deepest layers are nourished by diffusion from blood capillaries extending to the upper layers of the <b>dermis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Junctional nevus: the nevus {{cells are}} located along the {{junction}} of the epidermis and the underlying <b>dermis.</b> A junctional nevus is flat and brown to black.|$|E
25|$|The <b>dermis</b> is {{structurally}} {{divided into}} two areas: a superficial area adjacent to the epidermis, called the papillary region, and a deep thicker area known as the reticular region.|$|E
25|$|Detection {{in other}} {{locations}} such as intercellular and areas below the epidermis (subepidermal), {{as well as}} along the dermoepidermal junction (area that joins the epidermis and <b>dermis),</b> suggests paraneoplastic pemphigus.|$|E
