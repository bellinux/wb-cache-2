5|$|Birt–Hogg–Dubé can be {{difficult}} to diagnose from symptoms alone, because <b>hereditary</b> renal cancers, pneumothorax, and cutaneous tumors occur with other syndromes. <b>Hereditary</b> bilateral, multifocal kidney tumors similar to those seen in BHDcan occur with von Hippel–Lindau disease (clear cell renal cell carcinoma), <b>hereditary</b> papillary renal cancer (papillary renal cell carcinoma), and <b>hereditary</b> leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer syndrome. They are differentiated with examination of the tumors' histology.|$|E

5|$|<b>Hereditary</b> Transmission of Fistulae Auris. This journal article, {{published}} in Der Erbarzt (The Genetic Physician), focuses on fistula auris (an abnormal fissure on the external ear) as a <b>hereditary</b> trait.

5|$|In {{political}} and sociocultural studies, monarchies are normally associated with <b>hereditary</b> rule; most monarchs, in both {{historical and contemporary}} contexts, have been born and raised within a royal family. Succession has been defined {{using a variety of}} distinct formulae, such as proximity of blood, primogeniture, and agnatic seniority. Some monarchies, however, are not <b>hereditary,</b> and the ruler is instead determined through an elective process; a modern example is the throne of Malaysia. These systems defy the model concept of a monarchy, but are commonly considered as such because they retain certain associative characteristics. Many systems use a combination of <b>hereditary</b> and elective elements, where the election or nomination of a successor is restricted to members of a royal bloodline.|$|E
5|$|Lord Randall {{put forward}} {{the idea of}} phasing out the <b>hereditary</b> peers by disqualifying their heirs.|$|E

5|$|Research {{on early}} {{detection}} is ongoing. For instance, the European Registry of <b>Hereditary</b> Pancreatitis and Familial Pancreatic Cancer (EUROPAC) trial is aiming {{to determine whether}} regular screening is appropriate for people with {{a family history of}} the disease, or who have <b>hereditary</b> pancreatitis. The knowledge that new onset of diabetes can be an early sign of the disease could facilitate timely diagnosis and prevention if a workable screening strategy can be developed.|$|E
5|$|The MacIntyres of Rannoch, were <b>hereditary</b> pipers to {{the chiefs}} of Clan Menzies and {{composed}} {{some of that}} clan’s music. They supplied <b>hereditary</b> pipers to the MacDonalds of Clanranald, and a noted pibroch commemorating the battle of Sheriffmuir is attributed {{to one of these}} MacIntyres.|$|E

5|$|A 1999 {{study of}} Cavaliers {{conducted}} by the Canine Eye Registration Foundation showed that an average of 30% of all Cavalier King Charles Spaniels evaluated had eye problems. They include <b>hereditary</b> cataracts, corneal dystrophy, distichiasis, entropion, microphthalmia, progressive retinal atrophy, and retinal dysplasia.|$|E
5|$|A {{nephew of}} the last Emperor, Constantine XI, Andreas Palaiologos claimed to have {{inherited}} the title of Byzantine Emperor. He lived in the Morea until its fall in 1460, then escaped to Rome where he lived {{under the protection of}} the Papal States for the remainder of his life. Since the office of emperor had never been technically <b>hereditary,</b> Andreas' claim would have been without merit under Byzantine law. However, the Empire had vanished, and Western states generally followed the Roman-church-sanctioned principles of <b>hereditary</b> sovereignty. Seeking a life in the west, Andreas styled himself Imperator Constantinopolitanus ("Emperor of Constantinople"), and sold his succession rights to both Charles VIII of France and the Catholic Monarchs.|$|E
5|$|Although the Nanbu clan by {{the time}} of the 24th <b>hereditary</b> {{chieftain}} Nanbu Harumasa controlled seven districts of northern Mutsu province (Nukanobu, Hei, Kazuno, Kuji, Iwate, Shiwa and Tōno), the clan was more of a loose collection of competing branches without strong central authority.|$|E
5|$|Any form {{of muscle}} damage of {{sufficient}} severity can cause rhabdomyolysis. Multiple causes can be present simultaneously in one person. Some have an underlying muscle condition, usually <b>hereditary</b> in nature, {{that makes them}} more prone to rhabdomyolysis.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of dynastic intra-marriage all of Europe's 10 {{currently}} reigning <b>hereditary</b> monarchs since 1939 descend from a common ancestor, Johan Willem Friso, Prince of Orange.|$|E
5|$|Conroy was {{descended from}} the Ó Maolconaire family of Elphin, County Roscommon. The family had been the <b>hereditary</b> Ollamhs to the O'Connor Kings of Connacht. He was descended from Maoilin Ó Maolchonaire who was the last {{recognised}} Chief of the Sept.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hereditary</b> hemorrhagic {{telangiectasia}} (HHT), {{also known}} as Osler–Weber–Rendu disease and Osler–Weber–Rendu syndrome, is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder that leads to abnormal blood vessel formation in the skin, mucous membranes, and often in organs such as the lungs, liver, and brain.|$|E
5|$|His {{descendants}} became {{de facto}} {{heads of state}} of the Dutch Republic during the 16th to 18th centuries, which was an effectively <b>hereditary</b> role. For {{the last half century}} of its existence, it became an officially <b>hereditary</b> role and thus a monarchy (though maintaining republican pretense) under Prince William IV. His son, Prince William V, was the last stadtholder of the republic, whose own son, King William I, became the first king of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, which was established on 16 March 1815 after the Napoleonic Wars. With the independence of Belgium on 21 July 1831, the Netherlands formally became the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The current monarch is Willem-Alexander.|$|E
5|$|Ibrahima Sambeghu, {{who became}} known as Karamokho Alfa, was the <b>hereditary</b> ruler of Timbo {{and one of the}} nine ulama. He was elected leader of the jihad.|$|E

5|$|In other diseases, {{defects in}} nuclear genes lead to {{dysfunction}} of mitochondrial proteins. This {{is the case}} in Friedreich's ataxia, <b>hereditary</b> spastic paraplegia, and Wilson's disease. These diseases are inherited in a dominance relationship, as applies to most other genetic diseases. A variety of disorders can be caused by nuclear mutations of oxidative phosphorylation enzymes, such as coenzyme Q10 deficiency and Barth syndrome. Environmental influences may interact with <b>hereditary</b> predispositions and cause mitochondrial disease. For example, there may be a link between pesticide exposure and the later onset of Parkinson's disease. Other pathologies with etiology involving mitochondrial dysfunction include schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, stroke, cardiovascular disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, retinitis pigmentosa, and diabetes mellitus.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, the Mohave were {{composed}} of three geographical groups; Irataba was the <b>hereditary</b> {{leader of the}} Huttoh Pah group, who lived near the east bank of the Colorado River and occupied the central portion of the Mohave Valley. Mohave government consisted of a loose system of <b>hereditary</b> clan leaders with a head of the entire nation. They were often involved in conflicts with the Chemehuevi, Paiute, and Maricopa peoples. Irataba {{was a member of}} the Mohave warrior society called kwanami, who led groups of warriors in battle and were dedicated to defending their lands and people.|$|E
5|$|Many {{accounts}} relate that at {{some point}} in the 13th century the MacIntyres became foresters to the Lords of Lorne, a <b>hereditary</b> post in which they continued as the territory subsequently passed from the MacDougalls to the control of the Stewarts and finally to the Campbells.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, an individual's tissues are {{resistant}} {{to the effects of}} parathyroid hormone. This is known as pseudohypoparathyroidism. In this case the parathyroid glands are fully functional, and the hormone itself is not able to function, resulting in a decrease in blood calcium levels. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is often associated with the genetic condition Albright's <b>hereditary</b> osteodystrophy. Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism, one of the longest words in the English language, is used to describe an individual with Albright's <b>hereditary</b> osteodystrophy; with normal parathyroid hormone and serum calcium levels.|$|E
5|$|Palmoplantar keratodermas are {{a diverse}} group of <b>hereditary</b> and {{acquired}} keratodermas in which there is hyperkeratosis of the skin of the palms and soles.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare's play {{is adapted}} from Holinshed's Chronicles, {{a history of the}} British Isles written during the late 16th century. In Holinshed, Fleance escapes Macbeth and flees to Wales, where he fathers a son who later becomes the first <b>hereditary</b> steward to the King of Scotland.|$|E
5|$|The House of Lords Act 1999 {{removed the}} {{automatic}} right of <b>hereditary</b> peers {{to a seat}} in the House of Lords. Prior to the passage of this Act, anyone succeeding to a title in the peerage of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom, would prove their succession by a writ of summons to Parliament. All peers receiving such writs were enrolled in the Register of Lords Spiritual and Temporal, a document maintained by the Clerk of the Parliaments. As a result of the Act, the Register of Lords Spiritual and Temporal only records the name of life peers and the 92 <b>hereditary</b> peers left in the House of Lords. This meant that the register was incomplete as it excludes most of the other <b>hereditary</b> peers, who {{are not part of the}} House of Lords.|$|E
5|$|The Privileges Committee {{unanimously}} {{found that}} the Articles of Union would not be breached by the House of Lords Bill if it were enacted. The bill did receive Royal Assent, and from 1999, <b>hereditary</b> peers {{have not had the}} automatic right to sit in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of {{retinopathy of prematurity}} in infants is typically suggested by the clinical setting. Prematurity, low birth weight {{and a history of}} oxygen exposure are the principal indicators, while no <b>hereditary</b> factors have been shown to yield a pattern.|$|E
