500|$|In 1963, Fred <b>Hando,</b> who {{recorded}} {{points of}} interest and history around Monmouthshire {{in a series of}} articles for the South Wales Argus between the 1920s and the 1960s, wrote a description of the gatehouse, referencing the small museum then located in the upstairs room. <b>Hando</b> mentions the [...] "beautifully executed" [...] copies of the patent rolls issued by Edward I in 1296-7 and by Edward II in 1315 which recorded the items on which tolls could be levied to fund the fortifications for Monmouth.|$|E
500|$|In the English Civil War, {{the town}} changed hands several times, and in 1645 {{the bridge was}} seized by Royalist {{soldiers}} from Raglan in a failed attempt to retake the town from the Parliamentarian forces under Colonel Kyrle. Kissack describes the engagement as [...] "the most resolute Royalist attack made (on) Monmouth", which saw eight of Kyrle's opponents killed and five captured. By 1705, the bridge and gatehouse required maintenance: the original battlements were replaced with solid walls, and the building was refitted to form a two-storey dwelling house with timber and lath extensions projecting over the river. The house was then leased to a resident gatekeeper, responsible for repairing and maintaining the building. Part of the gatehouse remained in use as a lock-up. Such multiple uses were not uncommon; the archaeologist C. J. Bond recorded that [...] "gates often included chambers {{which could be used}} for lock-ups, chapels or meeting rooms". Both the bridge and the gatehouse were again repaired between 1771 and 1775. The bill for repairs included the cost of 100 gallons of ale for the workmen employed. Trade continued to be central to the importance of the bridge. The Monmouthshire writer and artist Fred <b>Hando</b> records that, on a single Saturday in the early 18th century, [...] "500 horses each carrying five bushels of corn entered by way of the Monnow gate".|$|E

50|$|Mónika Miczura {{was born}} in Berettyóújfalu, Hungary on 3/11 in 1972. She has four sisters. Very early, {{at the age of}} 5 she lost her father. She spent her {{childhood}} in Békéscsaba. The traditional romani-culture had been part of her daily life, at special family occasions (funerals, mournings, pomanas), there was a long tradition of a cappella (without instruments) singing. That is where her exceptional, deep style of performance stood out by the community, however at that time {{she had no idea what}} performance arts was about. Her first appearance on stage was at the age of 13 in the Jókai Mór theatre in Békéscsaba where she was cast to perform in the musical ‘Twist Oliver’. During these days, she discovered the world of Indian, Arabic, Persian and Chinese music in the music collection of the local library, which had a huge impact on her. For the recommendation of her teachers, she applied and was admitted to the famous Literature-Drama course at Horváth Mihály Grammar School in Szentes. That is where she first performed traditional Romani songs on stage, what she only did in small, family circles before. Those days the Romani folk-traditions were not part of the official Hungarian Folk Music, therefore it was a completely new experience for most non-Romani audience. In the 80’s, the first cultural Romani clubs, camps were organized where Mónika was a regular attendant. They soon discovered her unique, characteristic performing talent, as a result she was invited to be the singer of the Romani-folk band called <b>‘Ando</b> Drom’ at the age of 17. After a year of membership, a 3-year break came because she gave birth to her first daughter, Mónika. In 1994, she went back to stage and the <b>‘Ando</b> Drom’, which then became an internationally acknowledged worldwide band.|$|R

'Tadao AndoThis thesis book documents the process and procedure of a two-year study of how daylight can be manipulated by design to enhance and elevate the experiential qualities of sacred space and then applies those characteristics {{to the design of}} an architectural thesis project. The exploration involved two major points of focus: one was the exploration to identify the principle qualities and characteristics of natural light and the other, to apply those principles of light into built form. This paper is presented in five processes: an introduction, three types of reflection, and a conclusion. Process I, presents the theoretical underpinning on the subject of light and identifies the key qualities and characteristics of light and the daylighting principles applied by Louis I. Kahn and Tadao Ando in the formulation of sacred space. Process II, presents the articulation of the necessary criteria to design a sacred space. Process III, applies the daylighting strategies to the design of a "one-volume" library for displaying Leonardo da Vinci's Codex. Process IV, presents an alternate scenario and an explanation of architecture as meaning.

40|$|Mobility {{support for}} users and devices, such as sensors, {{connecting}} to the Internet is a continuously growing trend. Different types of wireless networking technologies like WiFi, LTE, and ZigBee are available, creating a heterogeneous wireless networking environment. In general, the technology, ranging from network equipment to communications protocols, available today, {{tends to be}} designed with limited exibility {{when it comes to}} supporting heterogeneity. Proprietary technology and highly optimized mechanisms limit the potential use of networking infrastructure for multiple purposes. Supporting mobility for wireless devices between different networking technologies and administrative domains requires secure and scalable mobility management solutions. Current research in the field of mobility management and security in heterogeneous networking environment tends to handle mobility management performance, such as communications characteristics, and security related aspects as separate, and more or less mutually exclusive. The work presented in this thesis serves to challenge this trade-off and proposes solutions that seeks to brigde the gap between the two areas. This thesis proposes using an Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) system based on the RADIUS AAA protocol that enables a common AAA infrastructure to operate in a heterogeneous networking environment, and that enables a hierarchical interconnection structure between service providers. The proposed AAA architecture offers a highly scalable AAA infrastructure with access technology independent support for user and device authentication as well as mobility on a global scale. Further, to support handoffs between networks, a set of methods for facilitating improved handoff decisions for intra- and inter-operator mobility in heterogeneous networks are presented. These methods rely on metrics that include indicators on network load conditions to improve service stability and decrease application down time during handoff. Results show that the proposed AAA infrastructure can be built to scale in order to support {{a very large number of}} entities, more than 1000 user or device authentications per second, using industry standard hardware. Further, an AAA architecture compatible sensor authentication protocol is proposed, implemented, and validated that supports sensor mobility and reduces power consumption, on wireless sensor nodes, with 33 % compared to state-of-the-art protocols by reducing CPU and communications overhead. Using the proposed mechanism for facilitating <b>handos</b> in wireless sensor networks, a reduction of 44 % in packet loss is achived during a mobility session compared to a traditional solution.
