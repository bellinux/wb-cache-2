40|$|During the {{replication}} cycle of vaccinia virus, four {{different forms of}} viral particles are produced. The two extracellular <b>enveloped</b> forms, cell-associated <b>enveloped</b> virus and extracellular <b>enveloped</b> virus, are responsible for cell-to-cell transmission and long-range spread of infection both in vivo and in vitro. Despite the biological importance of the <b>enveloped</b> forms, the mechanism of envelopment and the components involved in this process have been analysed only recently. Therefore the individual steps and the rate-limiting factors of the envelopment process are still unknown. The protein p 37 K, an unglycosylated but acylated envelope protein of molecular mass 37 kDa, {{has been shown to}} be essential for envelopment. However, this study shows that over-expression of p 37 K by vaccinia virus recombinants reduces rather than increases the yield of infectious <b>enveloped</b> virus which is mainly due to the <b>enveloped</b> virions exhibiting a strongly diminished specific infectivity...|$|R

5|$|In April 1943, the German {{leadership}} began {{preparing for}} Operation Citadel, {{with the objective}} of <b>enveloping</b> and destroying the Soviet forces in the Kursk salient, by attacking and breaking through the base of the salient from north and south simultaneously. The German offensive was delayed several times due to the vacillation of the leadership and the addition of more forces and new equipment. The Soviet high command, Stavka, had learned of the German intentions, and therefore used the delay to prepare a series of defensive belts along the routes of the planned German offensive. The Soviet leadership also massed several armies deep behind their defences as the Stavka Reserve. This army group, the Steppe Front, was to launch counteroffensives once the German strength had dissipated. The 5th Guards Tank Army was the primary armoured formation of the Steppe Front.|$|E

5|$|The lower {{respiratory}} tract {{is part of the}} respiratory system, and consists of the trachea and the structures below this including the lungs. The trachea receives air from the pharynx and travels down to a place where it splits (the carina) into a right and left bronchus. These supply air to the right and left lungs, splitting progressively into the secondary and tertiary bronchi for the lobes of the lungs, and into smaller and smaller bronchioles until they become the respiratory bronchioles. These in turn supply air through alveolar ducts into the alveoli, where the exchange of gases take place. Oxygen breathed in, diffuses through the walls of the alveoli into the <b>enveloping</b> capillaries and into the circulation, and carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into the lungs to be breathed out.|$|E
5|$|The main {{structure}} of the fruit body consists primarily of an agglutination (mass) of interwoven skeletal hyphae, which are golden- to rust-brown. The hyphae are unbranched, forming long tubes 2 to 3.6μm in diameter, <b>enveloping</b> a lumen of variable thickness. There are also hyaline generative hyphae. These hyphae have thinner walls than the skeletal hyphae, and are also septate (possessing of septa), but are sometimes branched. They measure 2 to 3μm in diameter. The flesh, again, is primarily made up of skeletal hyphae with some generative hyphae. The thick-walled skeletal hyphae are a yellow-brown to rust brown, and are slightly less agglutinate. The hyphae in the flesh are a little smaller; the skeletal hyphae measure 1.8 to 3.4μm in diameter, while the generative hyphae measure 1.5 to 2.6μm in diameter.|$|E
5|$|The pale brown-skinned ovoid {{tunicate}} bulbs have a membranous {{tunic and}} a corky stem (base or basal) plate from which arise the adventitious root hairs {{in a ring}} around the edge, which grow up to 40mm in length. Above the stem plate is the storage organ consisting of bulb scales, surrounding the previous flower stalk and the terminal bud. The scales are of two types, true storage organs and the bases of the foliage leaves. These have a thicker tip and a scar from where the leaf lamina became detached. The innermost leaf scale is semicircular only partly <b>enveloping</b> the flower stalk (semisheathed).(see Hanks Fig 1.3). The bulb may contain a number of branched bulb units, each with two to three true scales and two to three leaf bases. Each bulb unit has a life of about four years.|$|E

The male corpora cavernosa taper off internally on reaching the spongiosum head. With regard to the Y-shape of the cavernosa– crown, body, and legs– the body accounts for much more of the structure in men, and the legs are stubbier; typically, the cavernosa are longer and thicker in males than in females.|$|E

5|$|As they advanced, the Australians came {{up against}} stiff resistance, as Japanese {{forces in the}} area fought hard to buy time for the forces falling back from Wareo by delaying the Australian advance. Initially, the 22nd's attack was turned back; however, fire support from {{artillery}} and armour helped overcome this opposition, and the advance continued with the 22nd and 29th/46th Infantry Battalions advancing in turns up the coast with the 37th/52nd moving on their left further inland. Lakona was reached on 14 December and, after finding the Japanese forces there to be positioned in strength, the 22nd Battalion worked its way around the town, <b>enveloping</b> the Japanese defenders and pushing {{them back to the}} cliffs, where on 16 December tanks were used to launch the final attack. After this, the 29th/46th took over the coastal advance to Fortification Point, which it reached alongside the 37th/52nd on 20 December, crossing the Masaweng River and gaining the high ground to its north.|$|E

40|$|A {{distinguishing}} {{physical feature}} of many viruses {{is the presence}} of a host-derived lipid bilayer. This feature of the virus particle has important consequences for the assembly and release as well as the entry pathway for a particular virus. Significant advances have been made in our understanding of <b>enveloped</b> viruses. This progress has been due primarily to advances in structural and cell biology. Knowledge of virus structure has been aided in large part by the development of cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) and imaging techniques and their linkage to independently determined atomic structures of virion components. Thus, although no X-ray crystallographic structure of an <b>enveloped</b> animal virus has yet been solved, several <b>enveloped</b> virus structures are now approaching atomic resolution, or perhaps more appropriately, pseudo-atomic resolution. Improvements in techniques as well as reagents in cell biology have also provided insights into the morphogenesis of <b>enveloped</b> viruses. Confocal microscopy and other imaging techniques have been used to elaborate the pathways and interactions that virion components utilize in their path toward assembly and eventually budding. In this review, some of the general features of <b>enveloped</b> virus structure and assembly are discussed and several icosahedral <b>enveloped</b> virus examples are examined...|$|R

5|$|Like all milk-caps (Lactarius and Lactifluus), L.deceptivus is mycorrhizal, {{meaning the}} fungus forms a mutualistic {{association}} with certain trees and shrubs. The subterranean mycelium of the fungus forms an intimate association with tree roots, <b>enveloping</b> {{them in a}} sheath of tissue that allows both organisms to exchange nutrients they would otherwise be unable to obtain. The fruit bodies of the fungus grow solitarily, scattered, or in groups {{on the ground in}} conifer or hardwood forests, often under oak (Quercus) or hemlock (Tsuga). Smith has noted a preference for bogs and the edges of woodland pools in hardwood forests, and in oak stands that have an understory of blueberry bushes (Vaccinium species). It is widely distributed in eastern North America, and has also been reported from southern and western Canada. It is a fairly common species, and fruits from June to October. The mushroom has also been reported from Mexico (in Puebla and in Veracruz) from oak and pine forests, at altitudes slightly over , and from Costa Rica, where it is abundant in oak forests.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Pashtun {{forces had}} {{successfully}} assaulted the camp in three other locations, and the 24th Punjab Infantry's picket lines were quickly overrun.
