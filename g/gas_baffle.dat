40|$|OAK A 271 FINAL REPORT FOR THE DIII-D RADIATIVE DIVERTOR PROJECT. The Radiative Divertor Project {{originated}} in 1993 when the DIII-D Five Year Plan {{for the period}} 1994 [...] 1998 was prepared. The Project Information Sheet described {{the objective of the}} project as ''to demonstrate dispersal of divertor power by a factor of then with sufficient diagnostics and modeling to extend the results to ITER and TPX''. Key divertor components identified were: (1) Carbon-carbon and graphite armor tiles; (2) The divertor structure providing a <b>gas</b> <b>baffle</b> and cooling; and (3) The divertor cryopumps to pump fuel and impurities...|$|E
5000|$|Tanks are {{typically}} equipped with agitators, <b>baffles,</b> <b>gas</b> introduction equipment designed {{to maintain the}} solids in suspension in the slurry, and achieve leaching. Vats usually do not contain much internal equipment, except for agitators.|$|R
40|$|The Advanced Space Propulsion Laboratory (ASPL) of NASAâ€™s Johnson Space Center is {{performing}} research on a Variable Specific Impulse MagnetoPlasma Rocket (VASIMR), a high power, radio frequency (RF) driven magnetoplasma rocket. The experimental {{research focuses on}} three major areas: helicon plasma production, ion cyclotron resonant frequency (ICRF) acceleration and plasma expansion in a magnetic nozzle, with this paper presenting recent experimental results regarding the first two. A flexible four-magnet system, with a 1. 3 Tesla maximum magnetic field strength, is used to study axial magnetic field profile shape effects. Up to 3 kW of 25 MHz power is used for helicon plasma source development, primarily in helium for this work. A 3 MHz RF transmitter is used at powers up to 6 kW for ICRF experiments. Optimization studies have been performed with the magnetic field axial profile shape, gas flow rate, and antenna geometry. Gas efficiencies of near 100 % are achieved with strategic <b>gas</b> <b>baffling.</b> Power efficiency scales favorably with plasma diameter in the 5 to 7 cm range. We measure supersonic flow velocities (> ion sound speed) in the exhaust section. A strong coupling between the neutral gas pressure and the plasma discharge is observed in the source. Axia...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{experimental}} evaluation of velocity and residence time of single bubbles {{of different sizes}} in a <b>gassed</b> oscillatory <b>baffled</b> column (OBC) using a high-speed imaging technique is reported. This work is particularly concentrated {{on the effect of}} oscillatory amplitude. The results show that the instantaneous axial bubble velocities vary up to four times with respect to the mean value at an oscillatory amplitude greater than 2 mm. The ratio of the radial to axial bubble velocity increases beyond unity for the highest oscillation amplitude investigated. The direct measurement of residence time of the bubbles within a baffled cell is also reported...|$|R
40|$|In the {{operation}} of a tubular heat exchanger, or a gas heater, occurred acoustic vibrations, {{which could not be}} suppressed at all by installing baffle plates along the gas flow into the tube bundle of the <b>gas</b> heater. <b>Baffle</b> plates along the gas flow are always very effective in suppression of acoustic vibrations so far. To clarify the cause of the vibration phenomenon, we built a three-dimensional airflow scale model using the similarity method. Accordingly, violent vibrations took place, which have the same characteristic as the gas heater. We conclude that the model test method we conducted is useful to check the normal operation of a gas heater...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomena}} of radiation-affected steady-laminar natural convection in a rectangular enclosure with two incomplete partition s are numerically examined under a large temperature difference. Pure convection, con vection with surface radiation, and convection with surface r gas radiation are considered and compared. To {{examine the effects}} of two incomplete partition s on thermofluid dynamics behavior, they are assumed to be very thin () and adiabatic. The finite- volume method FVM is used for solving the radiati ve transport equation, assuming that partition s are radiati vely opaque. After validating the numerical procedures, the detailed radiation effects were sought. Based on the results of this study, {{it was found that the}} radiation played a significant role in developing the fluid dynamic and thermal distribution s compared with cases without radiation. Once radiation was involved, the surface radiation was dominant over the <b>gas</b> radiation. The <b>baffle</b> configuration was also found to affect the results of radiation...|$|R
