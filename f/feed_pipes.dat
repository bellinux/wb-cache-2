5|$|Maunsell's Chief Locomotive Draughtsman, James Clayton, brought {{functional}} Midland Railway influences to the design, such as {{the shape}} of the cab and the drumhead-type smokebox, which sat on a saddle that was of wider diameter than the fully lagged and clad boiler. Clayton was also responsible for the tender and chimney designs. Snifting valves were provided to prevent vacuum formation in the cylinders when the locomotive was stationary, and the outside Walschaerts valve gear incorporated single slide-bars and piston tail rods. Innovations added by Maunsell's team included steam-powered locomotive brakes, locating the boiler water top feed inside a dome-like cover with external clackboxes and water <b>feed</b> <b>pipes</b> mounted on either side, and a new type of superheater that segregated saturated and superheated steam. Maunsell also incorporated a screw reverser to control valve events, which was easier to maintain than the complex steam reverser configuration of previous SECR designs. All components were standardised for interchange with similar locomotive classes to ease maintenance and reduce production costs.|$|E

40|$|In a stirred vessel {{used as a}} semi-batch reactor, one of the {{reactants}} {{is supplied}} via a <b>feed</b> <b>pipe.</b> In this project. Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence was used for studying how the feed flow from such a <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> {{is influenced by the}} turbulent flow in the vessel (Re ? 9000). The feed flow was visualised by use of a horizontal laser sheet at several vertical positions under the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe.</b> Measurements were performed with different <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> openings and at several impeller speeds. The digital images of the feed flow were corrected for systematic noise. To separate the feed flow structures from the background, an objective threshold grey level was calculated. At the positions under the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe,</b> average values of several parameters characterising the feed flow have been determined. The trends in the relation between an average parameter and the position under the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> are the same for different <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> openings and impeller speeds. These trends are mainly due to the wake behind the head of the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe.</b> At low impeller speeds, the wake is related to the shape of the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe.</b> When the impeller speed is high, the shape of the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> is less important and the effect of the wake is smaller. From the trends for the decay in length scale of the feed flow, it can be concluded that the decaying length scale depends on the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> opening and the impeller speed {{in a way that is}} different from that predicted by theory.

The conditions in an agitated tank are simulated by a loop reactor by which feed point mixing conditions {{can be controlled}} separately from the macroscale circulation rate. Hydrochloric acid is fed into a circulating solution of sodium benzoate and the in#uence of macromixing, mesomixing and micromixing on the product crystal mean size is evaluated. The product mean size increases with increasing circulation rate in the loop, with increasing feed point mixing intensity, with decreasing feed rate and with decreasing <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> diameter. Increased mixing intensity on any level leads to larger product crystals, but especially the rate of mesomixing is of importance. The in#uence of the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> diameter is opposite to predictions by available theories and cannot be explained by backmixing into the <b>feeding</b> <b>pipe.</b> All results can be correlated quite well against a dimensionless mixing e$ciency de"ned as {{the ratio of the}} reactant feeding time to the mixing time.

40|$|The {{demand for}} seafood is {{continuously}} growing throughout the world, {{while the number}} of sheltered locations for fish farming is decreasing. Consequently, the industry is pushed to fin nd new and innovative solutions to this problem. One solution is to move the fish farms in non-sheltered locations, which requires extensive research on all structural parts of a fish farm, including components of the feeding system. The main goal of this thesis is to predict the hydrodynamic loads on <b>feed</b> <b>pipes</b> used by fish farmers in the industry, which is an important aspect of design to assure successful operation. The aquaculture industry has expressed the need for increasing the knowledge on <b>feed</b> <b>pipes</b> for fish farming. The bending of the pipes is of particular concern, especially when introducing non-sheltered locations. The hydrodynamic loads of the feed barge were obtained by generating a finite element model in GeniE and performing hydrodynamic analysis in frequency domain with the potential solver Wadam. The displacement RAOs of the feed barge were imported into OrcaFlex after conducting a sensitivity-and convergence study to verify the results. Dynamic simulations of the <b>feed</b> <b>pipes</b> were carried out in time domain using OrcaFlex, where the design basis was established using typical environmental and design data for Norwegian salmon farming. Analyses were performed under different sea states, investigating different responses of the feed pipe. Due to the limited work available on the force coefficients for floating pipes on the sea surface, a sensitivity study regarding the force coefficients was carried out. It was concluded to implement a variable data set for the drag-and added mass coe cient of the <b>feed</b> <b>pipes.</b> The results obtained for the selected cases resulted in high loads for all feed pipe lengths. The main problem that was found for the <b>feed</b> <b>pipes</b> was the large bending moment at the connection points, i. e. at the fish cage and the feed barge. For this reason, bend stiffeners at the connection points were installed. A reduction of 846 % for the bending moment was observed with the bending stiffener attached to the pipe. To conclude, the dynamic analysis exhibits too large hydrodynamic loads for offshore use. The use of bending stiffeners seems inevitable for the harsh environment in the open sea. More research on the <b>feed</b> <b>pipes</b> must be carried out to secure safe operation offshore...|$|E

40|$|Fire in farm {{buildings}} often starts in rooms {{with a high}} fire load density, for example barns, haylofts or food preparation rooms. It takes about l 0 minutes between ignition and flash over. That is all the time the farmer has got to save the animals. To protect the animals against fire, the stable is made like a fire compartment. The separating elements ought to be sealed against fire and smoke, for at least 60 minutes. Movements of people, feed, animals, air etc. require openings and various penetrations. They have to fulfil the same demands of tightness, about 60 minutes. The Agricultural Fire Protection Committee (Lantbrukets Brandskyddskommitté) and The Swedish Insurance company Länsförsäkringar initiated a project to find practical solutions of penetrations through separating elements in agricultural environments. The project concentrates on the three penetrations: <b>feed</b> <b>pipes,</b> hay openings and rail passages. A literature study deals with the understanding of fire and its development together with laws, rules and regulations. No previous studies {{have been made to}} verify the assumption that rail passages contributes to a huge spread of combustion gas. The airflow around an I-beam was studied through experiments. Discussions with fire experts and field studies show the lack of awareness about the contribution of the combustion gas to the spread of fire. The economical climate and motivation today for improving fire protection are poor. • Flow measurements showed that the air flow through a longitudinal opening in a partly open door is lower than that past an I-beam in a recess when the opening widths are the same. However the beam guides the air flow through the recess resulting in an airflow twice as high as that through a longitudinal opening of the same length as the circumference of the I-beam. • Openings such as doors, main entrances, shutters should be closed when they are not used. If required magnet contacts and fire alarms are available to facilitate the closing of passages. The tightness of fire doors has to be carefully examined. • Well-constructed <b>feed</b> <b>pipes,</b> without any fractures, reduce the contribution to spread of combustion gas. The installation of casing around the <b>feed</b> <b>pipes</b> is good security if the pipe should break. • Folding rails are preferable in new and existing buildings. There are different ways to increase air tightness for existing recesses e. g., fire traps, the construction of door shutters or simply by sealing the insides of door frames. • The continued decimation of information is required to change attitudes and increase the understanding of adequate fire protection and it’s implementation.

40|$|Semi-batch {{crystallization}} {{experiments have}} been performedboth in a loop reactor and in stirred tank reactors. Hydrochloric acid was fed to a stirred solution of sodiumbenzoate, and benzoic acid immediately formed. Benzoic acid isformed {{in excess of}} the solubility making the solutionsupersaturated. The loop reactor is U-shaped. In one leg a propeller stirrerwas placed to circulate the solution and in the other a turbinestirrer was placed in front of the feed point to vary the localmixing intensity. The objective was to analyse the relativeimportance of different levels of mixing on the product sizedistribution. The importance of mixing as well as scaling-upeffects on the product size distribution were studied in threestirred tank reactors of volumes 2. 5 L, 10 L, and 200 L. Thestirred tank reactors had different geometry and were equippedwith either a marine propeller or a pitched blade turbine. The weight mean size generally increases with increasingtotal feeding time and increasing mixing intensity. The weightmean size increases by locating an extra turbine impeller atthe feed point in the 10 L stirred tank reactor. The turbineimpeller provides the desired feed point mixing intensitywithout raising the mixing intensity of the whole tank. The weight mean size increases with decreasing feed pipediameter in the loop reactor and for low feed rates in the 10 Lstirred tank reactor. The weight mean size increasessignificantly by changing the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> opening from circularto rectangular with a constant cross-sectional area at equalfeed rates. Backmixing is visually observed in the largest feedpipe diameter in the loop reactor, thus, reducing the weightmean size. However, backmixing is not considered to be adominant phenomenon in the present work. Mesomixing time constants have been calculated according tothe turbulent dispersion mechanism and the inertial-convectivemechanism. The time constants for mesomixing are generallylonger than the time constant for micromixing. Thus, the ratioof the mesomixing and the micromixing time constants shows aninfluence of mesomixing as is shown by the experimentalresults. The experimental results are best described by theinertial-convective disintegration mechanism showing that thefeed plume mixing increases with decreasing <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> diameterand increased <b>feed</b> point mixing. The weight mean size is not strongly affected by the reactorvolume. However, the mixing conditions in the reactors have astrong influence on the weight mean size. No suggestedscaling-up rule can satisfactorily predict the weight mean sizein the different volumes. No single physical parameter, such asthe local energy dissipation rate, the mean energy dissipationrate or the circulation time, can satisfactorily explain theexperimental results. A new dimensionless mixing parameter, TR,has been defined as the ratio of the total feeding time and themesomixing time constant. The mesomixing time constant isdefined as the shortest dimension of the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> divided bythe resultant bulk velocity passing the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> entrance. Theexperimental results from both the loop reactor and the stirredtank reactors of different volumes can be correlated with TR. The weight mean size increases with increasing TR.
