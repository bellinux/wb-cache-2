5|$|On 1 September 1863, {{twelve days}} after his sixteenth birthday, Prus {{took part in a}} battle against Russian forces at a village called Białka, four {{kilometers}} south of Siedlce. He suffered contusions to the neck and gunpowder injuries to his eyes, and was captured unconscious on the battlefield and taken to hospital in Siedlce. This <b>experience</b> <b>may</b> have caused his subsequent lifelong agoraphobia.|$|E
5|$|Still the Commissioners prevaricated, daunted by the {{potential}} costs, estimated by Robert Stevenson at £63,000. They {{set up a}} special Skerryvore Committee, whose members decided to visit the site by steamer to see for themselves. Just off Skerryvore a fire {{broke out in the}} boiler room crippling the ship. It was extinguished and no harm was done, but the <b>experience</b> <b>may</b> have been persuasive.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the link}} between {{performance}} in chess and general intelligence is often assumed, researchers have largely failed to confirm its existence. For example, a 2006 study found no differences in fluid intelligence, as measured by Raven's Progressive Matrices, between strong adult chess players and regular people. There is some evidence towards a correlation between performance in chess and intelligence among beginning players. However, performance in chess also relies substantially on one's experience playing the game, {{and the role of}} <b>experience</b> <b>may</b> overwhelm the role of intelligence. Chess experts are estimated to have in excess of 10,000 and possibly as many as 300,000 position patterns stored in their memory; long training is necessary to acquire that amount of data.|$|E

5|$|Much {{research}} has been done into erection. By two years post-injury, 80% of men recover at least partial erectile function, though many experience problems with the reliability and duration of their erections if they do not use interventions to enhance them. Studies have found that half or up to 65% of men with SCI have orgasms, although the <b>experience</b> <b>may</b> feel different than it did before the injury. Most men say it feels weaker, and takes longer and more stimulation to achieve.|$|E
5|$|One B-26, {{after being}} seriously damaged by {{anti-aircraft}} fire, made a suicide run on Akagi. Making {{no attempt to}} pull out of its run, the aircraft narrowly missed crashing directly into the carrier's bridge, which could have killed Nagumo and his command staff. This <b>experience</b> <b>may</b> well have contributed to Nagumo's determination to launch another attack on Midway, in direct violation of Yamamoto's order to keep the reserve strike force armed for anti-ship operations.|$|E
5|$|NHL {{broadcaster}} Darren Eliot {{attributes the}} {{apparent lack of}} playoff success to the different style of competition compared to the regular season: instead of playing different teams every night, {{the goal is to}} advance through four best-of-seven playoff series. The Presidents' Trophy winner may have to go through other playoff clubs who might have a hotter goaltender, a better defensive team or other players that pose match-up problems. If the regular-season champion's primary success was merely outscoring others, they may be out of luck facing goaltenders that can shut them out. The lack of playoff <b>experience</b> <b>may</b> have been to blame in the examples of the 1999–2000 St. Louis Blues and 2008–09 San Jose Sharks, as neither team had advanced past the second round for five or more seasons. Teams have often given up pursuit of finishing first in the League in order to avoid injuries and rest key players for the postseason.|$|E

25|$|The {{experiences}} {{of patients who}} have experienced anesthesia awareness vary widely depending on why they became aware, whether they were paralyzed and patient responses and sequelae vary widely as well.

25|$|Carl Sagan (1977) and Barbara Honegger (1983) {{wrote that}} the OBE <b>experience</b> <b>may</b> {{be based on a}} rebirth fantasy or reliving of the birth process based on reports of tunnel-like passageways and a cord-like {{connection}} by some OBErs which they compared to an umbilical cord. Susan Blackmore (1978) {{came to the conclusion that}} the OBE is a hallucinatory fantasy as it has the characteristics of imaginary perceptions, perceptual distortions and fantasy-like perceptions of the self (such as having no body). Ronald Siegel (1980) also wrote that OBEs are hallucinatory fantasies.|$|E

25|$|Treatment of DCS {{utilizing}} the US Navy Treatment Table 6 with oxygen at 18m {{is a standard}} of care. Significant delay to treatment, difficult transport, and facilities with limited <b>experience</b> <b>may</b> lead one to consider on site treatment. Surface oxygen for first aid has been proven to improve the efficacy of recompression and decreased the number of recompression treatments required when administered within four hours post dive. IWR to 9 m breathing oxygen is one option that has shown success over the years IWR is not without risk and should be undertaken with certain precautions. IWR would only be suitable for an organised and disciplined group of divers with suitable equipment and practical training in the procedure.|$|E
25|$|In April 2000, Rose-Tu, {{a female}} {{elephant}} {{born at the}} zoo, was severely abused by her handler, resulting in 176 lacerations including puncture wounds allegedly due to the handler attempting to shove a bullhook into her anus. It's been speculated that the trauma suffered by her {{as a result of}} this <b>experience</b> <b>may</b> have compromised her ability to raise calves. The handler was let off with a minimal sentence, the best that the state laws could do at the time. As a fall out from this incident, Animal Legal Defense Fund authored the Rose-Tu law, signed by Governor Kitzhaber in 2001. The law made Oregon the first state in the country to legally recognize the link between animal abuse and violence toward people, and increased the penalties for animal abuse.|$|E
25|$|On January 6, the 3rd Army {{headquarters}} {{found itself}} under fire. Hafiz Hakki Pasha ordered a total retreat. On January 7, the remaining forces began their march towards Erzurum. The resulting Battle of Sarikamish became a stunning defeat. Only 10% of the Army managed to retreat {{back to its}} starting position. After this, Enver gave up command. The Armenian volunteer units were definitely a factor in their defeat, as they challenged the Ottoman operations during critical times, and his <b>experience</b> <b>may</b> {{have been one of}} the catalysts that led the Three pashas, of which one was Enver, to their decision to conduct the Armenian Genocide only a few months later. Enver blamed this defeat on Armenians living in the region actively siding with the Russians after his return to Constantinople.|$|E
