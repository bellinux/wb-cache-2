2500|$|Saccadic {{suppression}} {{is responsible}} for maintaining a continuous, stable, visual world by reducing visual sensitivity to events occurring before, during and after a saccade. The more complex the background on which the stimulus is presented, the larger the suppression. The increase in saccadic suppression {{can lead to a}} decrease in detection of change in the visual field. Saccadic suppression can be linked to the phenomenon of change blindness, in which individuals lack the ability to detect small or large changes within an environment without the aid of directed attention. [...] There are two types of saccadic suppression, with the first concerning the detection of light spot flashes during saccades. The lower the spatial frequency, meaning less objects in the visual field, of the light flashes the stronger the saccadic suppression. With a less number of items in the visual field it is easier for saccadic suppression to occur. The higher the spatial frequency, which involves more complex objects within the visual field, the less likely there will be saccadic suppression. The second type concerns the detection of <b>image</b> <b>displacement</b> or a change in an image during eye movement. A displacement between saccades would not be detected because the movement of the eye eliminates the signal for the detection of the displacement. The location of the target forms an image feature that is used by the visual system to establish space constancy, which maintains the location of an object in space. Target blanking is used to study visual stability, space constancy and the content of information transferred across saccades. Blanking a target after a saccade eliminates an attempt to make a second saccade, resulting in the visual system failing to find the target information. Stability and constancy across the saccades is broken, as a result, image displacements become easier to detect when blanking occurs during or right after the saccade.|$|E

The required sensor movement (both speed and range) increase with the focal length of the lens being used, making sensor-shift technology less suited for very long telephoto lenses, especially when using slower shutter speeds because the available motion range of the sensor quickly becomes insufficient to cope with the increasing <b>image</b> <b>displacement.</b>|$|E

5000|$|A saccade is a fast eye motion, {{and because}} it is a motion that is {{optimised}} for speed, there is inevitable blurring of the image on the retina, as the retina is sweeping the visual field. Blurred retinal images are not of much use, and the eye has a mechanism that [...] "cuts off" [...] the processing of retinal images when it becomes blurred. Humans become effectively blind during a saccade. This phenomenon is called saccadic masking or saccadic suppression. There are two major types of saccadic masking, flash suppression (the inability to see a flash of light during a saccade) and saccadic suppression of <b>image</b> <b>displacement</b> (characterized by the inability to perceive whether a target has moved or not during a saccade).|$|E
5000|$|E. fasciata is {{a highly}} {{successful}} ambush predator. In the course of evolution, it has specialized in preying on fast flying insects, such as flies and bees. One reason for this preference may be that flying insects serve as nutritious food, which {{is important in the}} spring when there is a limited food supply. Adult females often perch on flowers, where they wait to prey on honeybees. Insect prey can be captured upon landing, or even during flight, due to the fast strike of E. fasciata and its ability to rotate its head and the two powerful raptorial forelegs more than 90° laterally, without moving the rest of its body. E. fasciata shows no evidence of being cannibalistic. Distinct rocking and jerking movements are executed, which not only serve as camouflage in moving vegetation, but also facilitate spatial vision with the aid of motion parallax or retinal <b>image</b> <b>displacement.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Wallach and Kravitz {{devised a}} {{mechanical}} apparatus that enabled head movements to cause displacements {{of an image}} by any desired percentage {{of the extent of}} that head movement, and discovered that subjects could detect deviations of as little as 2% from the normal degree of displacement. This showed that a highly accurate compensating process corrects for the <b>image</b> <b>displacement</b> that normally accompanies a head movement, thus yielding an appearance of stability. Wallach called this process constancy of visual direction (CVD), and he noted with interest that it could be easily modified through perceptual adaptation. To demonstrate this, Wallach & Kravitz set the apparatus so that during head movements the visual image moved by 150% of what would be the normal displacement, and had subjects turn their heads back and forth watching this altered displacement for 10 minutes. After this brief adaptation period, subjects were shown an objectively stationary target as they turned their heads. They reported that it no longer appeared motionless, but swung {{back and forth in the}} direction opposite the movements that had occurred during adaptation, In order to make the target appear stationary, the apparatus had to be set so that the target actually moved by about 14% in the same direction it had moved during the adaptation period. The CVD process that correlates head movements and image shifts had been modified by exposure to an abnormal stimulus condition. (The adaptation of the CVD process was temporary and dissipated after a few minutes.) ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} fully-automatic localization and segmentation of 3 D intervertebral discs (IVDs) from MR images. Our method contains two steps, where we first localize {{the center of each}} IVD, and then segment IVDs by classifying image pixels around each disc center as foreground (disc) or background. The disc localization is done by estimating the <b>image</b> <b>displacements</b> from a set of randomly sampled 3 D image patches to the disc center. The <b>image</b> <b>displacements</b> are estimated by jointly optimizing the training and test displacement values in a data-driven way, where we take into consideration both the training data and the geometric constraint on the test image. After the disc centers are localized, we segment the discs by classifying image pixels around disc centers as background or foreground. The classification is done in a similar data-driven approach as we used for localization, but in this segmentation case we are aiming to estimate the foreground/background probability of each pixel instead of the <b>image</b> <b>displacements.</b> In addition, an extra neighborhood smooth constraint is introduced to enforce the local smoothness of the label field. Our method is validated on 3 D T 2 -weighted turbo spin echo MR images of 35 patients from two different studies. Experiments show that compared to state of the art, our method achieves better or comparable results. Specifically, we achieve for localization a mean error of 1. 6 - 2. 0 mm, and for segmentation a mean Dice metric of 85 %- 88 % and a mean surface distance of 1. 3 - 1. 4 mm...|$|R

40|$|Context. To {{evaluate}} {{site quality}} {{and to develop}} multi-conjugative adaptive optics systems for future large solar telescopes, characterization of contributions to seeing from heights up to at least 12 km above the telescope is needed. Aims. We describe a method for evaluating contributions to seeing from different layers along the line-of-sight to the Sun. The method is based on Shack Hartmann wavefront sensor data recorded over a large field-of-view with solar granulation and uses only measurements of differential <b>image</b> <b>displacements</b> from individual exposures, such that the measurements are not degraded by residual tip-tilt errors. Methods. The covariance of differential <b>image</b> <b>displacements</b> at variable field angles provides {{a natural extension of}} the work of Sarazin and Roddier to include measurements that are also sensitive to the height distribution of seeing. By extending the numerical calculations of Fried to include differential <b>image</b> <b>displacements</b> at distances much smaller and much larger than the subaperture diameter, the wavefront sensor data can be fitted to a well-defined model of seeing. The resulting least-squares fit problem can be solved with conventional methods. The method is tested with simple simulations and applied to wavefront data from the Swedish 1 -m Solar Telescope on La Palma, Spain. Results. We show that good inversions are possible with 9 – 10 layers, three of which are within the first 1. 5 km, and a maximum distance of 16 – 30 km, but with poor height resolution in the range 10 – 30 km. Conclusions. We conclude that the proposed method allows good measurements when Fried's parameter r 0 is larger than about 7. 5 cm for the ground layer and that these measurements should provide valuable information for site selection and multi-conjugate development for the future European Solar Telescope.
