50|$|An {{arboretum}} (plural: arboreta) in {{a narrow}} sense {{is a collection of}} trees only. Related collections include a <b>fruticetum</b> (from the Latin frutex, meaning shrub), and a viticetum, a collection of vines. More commonly, today, an arboretum is a botanical garden containing living collections of woody plants intended at least partly for scientific study. An arboretum specializing in growing conifers is known as a pinetum. Other specialist arboreta include saliceta (willows), populeta, and querceta (oaks).|$|E
50|$|The {{cultivar}} Ulmus ''''Virens'''', the Kidbrook Elm, is an elm {{of unknown}} origin. It was first identified by Masters as U. virens in Hortus Duroverni, {{and later by}} Loudon in Arboretum et <b>Fruticetum</b> Britannicum,, as U. campestris (: minor) virens.

50|$|The hybrid elm Ulmus × hollandica ''''Viscosa'''' is {{probably}} {{one of a number of}} cultivars arising from the crossing of the Wych Elm U. glabra with a variety of Field Elm U. minor. The tree was listed by Loddiges, (Hackney, London) in his catalogue of 1836 and two years later by Loudon in Arboretum et <b>Fruticetum</b> Britannicum, as U. viscosa. An early specimen in the Herbarium Dumortier named U. viscosa Audibert was later sunk by Melville as U. × hollandica.|$|E
5000|$|The Field Elm {{cultivar}} Ulmus minor ''''Viminalis Betulaefolia'''' (:'birch-leaved') is an elm of uncertain origin. An U. campestris var. betulaefolia {{was listed}} by Loddiges of Hackney, London, {{in the catalogue}} of 1836, and later by Loudon in Arboretum et <b>Fruticetum</b> Britannicum (1838). Melville considered the tree so named at Kew a form of his U. × viminalis, while Bean (1988), describing U. 'Betulaefolia', placed it under U. 'Viminalis' as an apparently allied tree. Loudon and Browne had noted that some forms of 'Viminalis' can {{be mistaken for a}} variety of birch.|$|E

5000|$|Arboreta {{are special}} places for the {{cultivation}} and display {{of a wide}} variety of different kinds of trees and shrubs (that is ligneous plants). Many tree collections have been claimed as the first arboretum, in most cases, however, the term has been applied retrospectively as it did not come into use until the later eighteenth century. Arboreta differ from pieces of woodland or plantations because they are botanically significant collections with a variety of examples rather than just a few kinds. Of course there are many tree collections that are much older than the eighteenth century in different parts of the world. Probably the most important early proponent of the arboretum in the English-speaking transatlantic world was the prolific landscape gardener and writer, John Claudius Loudon (1783-1843) who undertook many gardening commissions and published the Gardener's Magazine, Encyclopaedia of Gardening and other major works. Loudon's Arboretum et <b>Fruticetum</b> Britannicum, 8 vols., (1838) is probably the most significant work on the subject in British history and included an account of all trees and shrubs that were hardy in the British climate, an international history of arboriculture, an assessment of the cultural, economic and industrial value of trees and four volumes of plates. Loudon urged that a national arboretum be created and called for arboreta and other systematic collections to be established in public parks, private gardens, country estates and other places. He regarded the Derby Arboretum (1840) as the most important landscape-gardening commission of the latter part of his career because it demonstrated the benefits of a public arboretum (for more details see below). Commenting on Loddiges' famous Hackney Botanic Garden arboretum, begun in 1816, which was a commercial nursery that subsequently opened free to the public, for educational benefit, every Sunday, Loudon wrote: [...] "The arboretum looks better this season than it has ever done since it was planted... The more lofty trees suffered from the late high winds, but not materially. We walked round the two outer spirals of this coil of trees and shrubs; viz. from Acer to Quercus. There is no garden scene about London so interesting". A plan of Loddiges' arboretum was included in The Encyclopaedia of Gardening, 1834 edition. Leaves from Loddiges' arboretum and in some instances entire trees, were studiously drawn to illustrate Loudon's encyclopaedic book Arboretum et <b>Fruticetum</b> Britannicum which also incorporated drawings from other early botanic gardens and parklands throughout the United Kingdom.|$|E
5000|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{significant}} of these, certainly the most time-consuming and costly, was Arboretum et <b>Fruticetum</b> Britannicum. This work was published in three formats: with the plates entirely uncoloured, with botanical details hand-coloured, and fully hand-coloured. Work began in 1830 and it was first issued in sixty-three monthly parts from January 1835 to July 1838. It presented: an exhaustive account of all the trees and shrubs growing in Great Britain and their history; notes on remarkable examples growing in individual gardens; drawings of leaves, twigs, fruits, and the shapes of leafless trees; and entire portraits of trees in their young and mature state. All were drawn from life, many being from the parkland grounds of Syon House, one of {{the homes of the}} Duke of Northumberland to whom the work was dedicated, or from Loddiges' arboretum. [...] "It was on the collection maintained by this firm more than any other that J. C. Loudon relied for living material in the preparation of his great work" [...] W. J. Bean notes, in Trees and Shrubs Hardy in the British Isles. The publication also ruined him financially, as he ended up with many unsold copies of the eight-volume work and went deep into debt.|$|E
50|$|The Derby Arboretum {{opened on}} 16 September 1840. Commissioned and {{presented}} by Joseph Strutt (1766-1844) a wealthy industrialist and major local benefactor, the Derby Arboretum {{was designed by}} John Claudius Loudon and had a major impact upon the development of urban parks. It {{was one of the}} first Victorian public parks and also unusual for the quality of its collection of trees and shrubs. Although established on only quite a small site of 14 acres, the park featured a labelled collection of over 1000 trees and shrubs and was landscaped with mounds, sinuous paths, urns, benches, statues, lodges and other features. Managed by a committee until it was acquired by the Derby Corporation during the 1880s, the Derby Arboretum was only open free to the public for two days of the week for its first four decades, the remaining days being reserved for subscribers and their families and guests. Very popular anniversary festivals were staged annually which drew crowds of tens of thousands and helped to fund the upkeep of the park. The Derby Arboretum is also significant because it was the planted counterpart to Loudon's Arboretum et <b>Fruticetum</b> Britannicum (1838) which detailed all the hardy and semi-hardy trees and shrubs of the British Isles. Within the park, the trees and shrubs were laid out according to the natural system and labelled so that visitors could identify them using the guide.The Derby park had a major impact on park design elsewhere including Europe, the British colonies and North America and other public parks and arboreta were established modelled on Loudon's creation and using his ideas. In 1859 for example, it was visited by Frederick Law Olmsted on his European tour of parks, and it had an influence on the planting in Central Park, New York. Industrial pollution killed most of the original plantings by the 1880s (although a few examples remain), but it has been renovated and replanted with National Lottery Heritage funding closer to Loudon's original layout and with a new cafe and visitor centre, is well worth a visit.|$|E
