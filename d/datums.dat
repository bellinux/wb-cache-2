The datum shift between two particular <b>datums</b> can vary {{from one place to another}} within one country or region, and can be anything from zero to hundreds of meters (or several kilometers for some remote islands).

40|$|The {{unification}} {{of the global}} height <b>datum</b> is a key problem to be solved for geodesy after the {{unification of}} global geodetic coordination system and three-dimension spatial <b>datum,</b> and the basis of global spatial information sharing and exchange. In this paper, the theoretical and practical problems of vertical <b>datum</b> offset between the regional height <b>datum</b> and the global height <b>datum</b> are studied. Based on the classical theory of the height system in physical geodesy, {{the definition of the}} height <b>datum</b> vertical offset is given, and the rigorous formulas for calculating the vertical offset are derived. The formulas can be used to deduce the three methods of the height <b>datum</b> vertical offset determination. On that basis, the influences of different reference system and reference ellipsoid parameters on the calculation of the vertical offset are analyzed. The results show that the reference system and the ellipsoid parameter conversion are very necessary. At the same time, the height anomaly differences method needs to consider the degree zero correction caused by the inconsistency between gravity potential of the global height <b>datum</b> and the one computed by the model. Based on potential difference approach and the height anomaly difference method, the vertical offset between the China 1985 national height <b>datum</b> and the global height <b>datum</b> corresponding to the normal gravity potential U 0 of GRS 80, WGS- 84 and CGCS 2000 reference ellipsoidal from the 152 GPS/leveling points near the origin of Qingdao height origin and the EGM 2008, EIGEN- 6 C 4 and SGG-UGM- 1 model. The regional <b>datum</b> is 23. 1 cm lower than the global <b>datum</b> based on EIGEN- 6 C 4 and WGS- 84. When the Gauss-Listing geoid (mean sea surface) is selected as the global height <b>datum,</b> the China 1985 national height <b>datum</b> is 21. 0 cm higher than the global height <b>datum.</b> The results also show that there are still large differences among the accuracies of the current gravity field models on these GPS/Levelling points around Qingdao, which will lead to big differences in estimating the vertical <b>datum</b> offset between the China 1985 national height <b>datum</b> and the global height <b>datum</b> with respect to different selected data sets. Therefore, the accuracy and reliability of the current global gravity field models needs to be further improved if they were used for the height <b>datum</b> vertical offset determination. The theoretical and practical results of this paper could be used for the realization of the unification of the regional height <b>datum</b> and the global height <b>datum...</b>|$|R
