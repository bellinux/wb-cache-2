Articular cartilage tissue is modeled as a viscoelastic material with a time-independent Poisson's ratio. We study the dynamic indentation stiffness with the aim of formulating criteria for evaluation the quality of articular cartilage in order to be able to discriminate its degenerative state. In particular, evaluating the dynamic indentation stiffness at the turning point of the flat-ended <b>indentation</b> <b>test,</b> we introduce the so-called incomplete storage modulus. Considering the time difference between the time moments when the dynamic stiffness vanishes (contact force reaches its maximum) and the dynamic stiffness becomes infinite (indenter displacement reaches its maximum), we introduce the so-called incomplete loss angle.

40|$|International audienceThe {{determination}} of the tensile properties by spherical indentation {{is based on the}} relation of Tabor, which links the mean pressure and the indent diameter, obtained from <b>indentation</b> <b>tests,</b> to the stress and strain determined from a tensile test, respectively. However, in order to improve the indentation-tensile relationship, an additional correction related to the piling-up or sinking-in formation around the indent {{must be taken into account}} for the calculation of the strain by indentation. The correction factor is expressed as a function of the strain-hardening exponent. As a consequence, to validate such methodology, majority of the authors use the strain-hardening exponent previously determined by a tensile test. Unfortunately, this approach obviously impedes a direct construction of the tensile curve from <b>indentation</b> <b>tests</b> since the strain-hardening exponent will be undetermined. In addition, the tensile stress to mean pressure ratio is not a constant value because it depends on the mechanical properties and on the deformation regime.

According to this theory, the damage is accumulated in the material during the test with voids nucleating and growing, which {{can be divided into}} two stages due to the variation in the degree of constraint. The turning point between two stages can be identified as the failure point where the material beneath the indenter collapses.
