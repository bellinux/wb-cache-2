These challenges provided several key learning points: cost remains the main priority in procurement teams much higher than environmental aspects; committed ‘Champions’ are key to organisational change; and <b>ICT</b> carbon/sustainability <b>tools</b> need to {{be an integral part of}} an organisation’s existing procurement systems.

40|$|Purpose – In general, active {{participation}} increases learning outcomes. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to explore how: information and communication technologies (ICT) can be used to improve the participation of students during lectures and the effect of ICT on the learning outcomes of students. Design/methodology/approach – The authors tested a specific tool, Soapbox, in a compulsory course of a Masters’ program, at VU University, The Netherlands. During half of the lectures the students were invited to participate using their mobile phone or laptop, for the other half of the lectures, taught by the same lecturer, the tool was not used. The authors compared the two groups of lectures. For the evaluation the authors used observations in the classroom, a questionnaire, in-depth interviews, and focus group discussions with students and with the lecturer. Findings – The results show that the <b>ICT</b> <b>tool</b> facilitated and increased the level of communication and interaction among the students and between the students and the lecturers. Students’ scored lectures with the tool consistently higher on the item “engaging. ” Most of the students appreciated the use of the <b>ICT</b> <b>tool</b> and said that they felt more involved. Originality/value – Despite the knowledge about the limited learning effect of lectures on larger groups, most of the teaching at universities is conducted through such lectures. The research shows that the majority of the students felt more involved in the lectures with the <b>ICT</b> <b>tool,</b> and almost half of the students feel that the learning effect of lectures with the tool is higher than the learning effect of lectures without. Although observations could not confirm the perceived enhanced involvement, about 80 percent would recommend using the tool in other classes, providing a case for the use of interactive technology in large-scale lectures...|$|R

40|$|To {{develop an}} {{innovative}} {{information and communication}} technology (<b>ICT)</b> <b>tool</b> intended to help older people {{in their search for}} optimal housing solutions, a first step in the development process is to gain knowledge from the intended users. Thus the aim {{of this study was to}} deepen the knowledge about needs and expectations about housing options as expressed and prioritized by older people, people ageing with disabilities and professionals. A participatory design focus was adopted; 26 people with a range of functional limitations representing the user perspective and 15 professionals with a variety of backgrounds, participated in research circles that were conducted in four European countries. An additional 20 experts were invited as guests to the different research circle meetings. Three themes illustrating cross-national user priorities for housing provision and accessibility were identified: "Information barrier: accessible housing", "Information barrier: housing adaptation benefits", and "Cost barrier: housing adaptations". In conclusion, early user involvement and identification of cross-national differences in priorities and housing options will strengthen the development of a user-friendly <b>ICT</b> <b>tool</b> that can empower older people and people with disabilities to be more active consumers regarding housing provision...|$|R

50|$|ODR {{was born}} from the synergy between ADR and ICT, {{as a method}} for resolving {{disputes}} that were arising online, and for which traditional means of dispute resolution were inefficient or unavailable. The introduction of ICT in dispute resolution is currently growing {{to the extent that}} the difference between off-line dispute resolution and ODR is blurry. It has been observed that it is only possible to distinguish between proceedings that rely heavily on online technology and proceedings that do not. Some commentators have defined ODR exclusively as the use of ADR assisted principally with <b>ICT</b> <b>tools.</b> Although part of the doctrine incorporates a broader approach including online litigation and other sui generis forms of dispute resolution when they are assisted largely by <b>ICT</b> <b>tools</b> designed ad hoc. The latter definition seems more appropriate since it incorporates all methods used to resolve disputes that are conducted mainly through the use of ICT. Moreover, this concept is more consistent with the fact that ODR was born from the distinction with off-line dispute resolution processes.|$|E

Numerous papers ask for a greater consideration of the organization into the analysis of the uses of an <b>ICT</b> <b>tool.</b> In this paper, we suggest to enrich this reflection by paying attention to researches produced in the field of the sociology of organizations. To show the potential of this literature, we present a case study of a Small and Medium Enterprise that uses a software supposed to improve collective decisions. The results produced by this case study allow to validate the relevance of the framework which develop a localized analysis of uses but they also show that it is interesting to interpret those uses from a more global view, especially with regard to the strategic challenges of this firm. This framework allows us to propose a discussion which draws perspectives of research to progress towards a better consideration of the organization in the analysis of the uses of ICT...|$|R
