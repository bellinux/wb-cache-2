[...] This turned out to be Fatboy, who died in a case of mistaken identity in the episode shown on 26 December 2015. This was not well received by fans and many set up petitions to bring the character back.|$|E
500|$|... "We Ride" [...] {{garnered}} {{a generally}} positive response from music critics. David Jeffries of Allmusic praised [...] "We Ride", writing that {{the song is}} [...] "an easy-flowing weekend cruiser". Spence D. of IGN similarly noted that [...] "We Ride" [...] is a song to which someone can listen to whilst driving, writing {{that it is a}} [...] "ubiquitous cruising track that reworks the cliché catch phrase of the new millennium: 'we ride till the <b>day</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> die. Bill Lamb of About.com noted that [...] "We Ride" [...] would appeal most to urban audiences due to its hip-hop composition. However, Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine was critical of [...] "We Ride", writing that although the song is a [...] "hip hop-influenced club banger", it appeared to be too mature for the singer and her [...] "minor vocal talents".|$|E
500|$|Several {{songs from}} the band's third album, Vitalogy, were premiered during this tour. The band's April 3, 1994 concert in Atlanta, Georgia at the Fox Theatre was {{broadcast}} live on the radio in the United States. A few days later, the body of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain was found in his home in Seattle due to an apparent suicide, which deeply affected Vedder. At the band's April 8, 1994 concert in Fairfax, Virginia at the Patriot Center, Vedder proclaimed, [...] "I don't {{think any of us}} would be in this room tonight if it weren't for Kurt Cobain." [...] Vedder later said that [...] "the <b>day</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> found out about Kurt... I was just spinning. I was lost and didn't know if we should play, or if we should just go home, or if we should attend the services. I still have some regrets about that, even though {{in the end it was}} probably better that we played the last two weeks of the tour. I decided I would play those next two weeks and then I'd never have to play again." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{occupation}} of Serbia by the Central Powers pained Bojić {{far more than}} the everyday struggles of the exodus itself. He is said to have slept very little, telling Živadinović: [...] "You don't realize what you are missing by sleeping. In circumstances like these, the entire soul must be kept constantly awake. Whole centuries have never painted such a vast fresco. Never has death been so greedy, nor heroes so indifferent to it." [...] In December 1915, Bojić reached Shëngjin with the others and reunited with his fiancée. Živadinović recalled: [...] "I shall never forget the <b>day</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> saw the sea. Only then did Bojić begin to speak about the future. He was making plans for a vast novel in verse, for comedies, dramas, tragedies, all intended to bring the great events of our history back to life." [...] Upon reaching the coast, Bojić was told that he could not board the ship to Italy because he was of fighting age. His fiancée was allowed to board and his fifteen-year-old brother was judged to be too young for military service and granted passage as well. Unable to go with them, Bojić and his companions continued {{down the length of the}} Albanian coast until they reached Corfu, where the Allies had sent ships to transport the remnants of the Serbian Army to the Greek mainland.|$|E
2500|$|After several {{workshops}} of {{the show}} with co-star Craig Bierko, including a topless scene, Levering said: [...] "It's a very physically draining show. The dance stuff in Thou Shalt Not is very physical. There's a lot of fighting. There's a big love ballet on this bed and kind of a rape scene. Every <b>day</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> did that workshop, I left with bruises." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 1875, the French conquest was complete. The war {{had killed}} {{approximately}} 825,000 indigenous Algerians since 1830. A long shadow of genocidal hatred persisted, provoking a French author to protest in 1882 that in Algeria, [...] "we hear it repeated every <b>day</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> must expel the native and if necessary destroy him." [...] As a French statistical journal urged five years later, [...] "the system of extermination must {{give way to}} a policy of penetration." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By your leave, Caesar," [...] {{said the}} blunt soldier, [...] "good swordsmen are too rare in these <b>days</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should let them slay {{each other for}} sport. Perhaps if the Barbarian would wrestle a fall--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{suppose we}} shall {{want to stay}} there many days, Harry, for we shall be eager to start {{the search for the}} enchanted castle Dias has told us of. We saw quite enough of Lima during the ten <b>days</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were there." ...|$|R

2500|$|At the time, Vallance was {{primarily}} {{known as a}} songwriter, having written most frequently (and successfully) with Bryan Adams. [...] He also had some previous production experience, having produced one album apiece by Adams, Doug and the Slugs and CANO in the early 1980s. The band's lead vocalist Alan Frew recalled: [...] "It worked out great because we were {{all at the same}} stage of development. He didn't change the sound of the band at all. He let us experiment but wasn't afraid to get heavy-handed when he had to." [...] Vallance composed [...] "Don't Forget Me (When I'm Gone)" [...] with the band, while Adams provided backing vocals. Frew - [...] "On the very first <b>day</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> met Jim Vallance, he picked us up at the airport and to break the ice asked us what we were listening to. One was Tears For Fears. We went to his house and drank tea and listened to some tunes. 'Everybody Wants to Rule the World' came on and we really liked the shuffle beat. So we went into the studio and based on this shuffle beat, we wrote 'Don't Forget Me (When I'm Gone)'. First day, first song." ...|$|E
2500|$|As Marla Heasley recounts in Bring Back... The A-Team (May 18, 2006), {{although}} sexism was not prevalent {{on the set}} per se, {{there was}} a sense that a female character was not necessary on the show. On her first day on set George Peppard took her aside and told her [...] "We don't want you on the show. None of the guys want you here. The only reason you're here is because the network and the producers want you. For some reason they think they need a girl." [...] The interview continues with Heasley noting that on her last day of work Peppard took her aside again, saying: [...] "I'm sorry that this is your last day, but remember what I said the very first <b>day,</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> didn't want a girl, has nothing to do with you. You were very professional, but no reason to have a girl." [...] In Bring Back... the A-Team, Dirk Benedict also remarked that: [...] "It was a guy's show. It was male driven. It was written by guys. It was directed by guys. It was acted by guys. It's about what guys do. We talked the way guys talked. We were the boss. We were the God. We smoked when we wanted. We shot guns when we wanted. We kissed the girls and made them cry... when we wanted. It was the last truly masculine show." ...|$|E

5000|$|To avoid {{interrupting}} Achievement Hunter's online video schedule, Free and Jones pre-recorded {{content for}} a month prior to filming.
