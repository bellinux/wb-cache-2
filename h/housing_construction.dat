5|$|In 1983 the Rocky Mountain Peace and Justice Center {{was founded}} {{with a goal}} of closing the Rocky Flats plant. The Center has since set goals of keeping the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge closed to the public, {{preventing}} construction of highways {{in or near the}} site of the former plant, and preventing new <b>housing</b> <b>construction</b> in the area. The Center is a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation an, as of 2014, has one full-time employee.|$|E
5|$|The {{light rail}} {{is now under}} {{construction}} from Lagunen via Kokstad to Bergen Airport, Flesland. Both Sørås and Indre Steinsvik have experienced rapid <b>housing</b> <b>construction</b> without a corresponding increase of public transport. Further out is a large corporate center with many of Bergen's largest employers, such as Telenor, Statoil and BKK. The area was built without sufficient roads or public transport, and has among the worst road congestion in the urban area. Building the light rail line to Flesland will supplement the airport shuttles and offer cheaper service for locals and employees at the airport. Another incentive to build to Flesland {{was that there was}} sufficient available land which allows a large depot to be constructed. After the line was opened to Lagunen, there was insufficient space at Kronstad to house additional trams. The line to the airport is scheduled to open in 2016.|$|E
5|$|The twin {{impacts of}} hurricanes Ingrid and Manuel {{prompted}} officials in Mexico {{to declare a}} state of emergency in 155municipalities in Veracruz, Tamaulipas, Chiapas, Oaxaca, Guerrero, and Chihuahua. The nation's Health Ministry sent medical crews across the country to affected areas in an effort {{to prevent the spread of}} disease; the agency also suggested residents boil their water. Officials opened shelters in Tamaulipas for residents whose houses were damaged, housing about 2,000people in the weeks following the storm. The Mexican food bank sent about 800tons of food to the hardest-hit parts of the country in Guerrero, Veracruz, and Sinaloa. In addition, the Mexican Red Cross delivered 186tons of food to Veracruz alone. Volunteers delivered about 600blankets and various cleaning supplies to the town of Pánuco. Following the storms, the National Civil Protection Coordination received the authority to prevent <b>housing</b> <b>construction</b> in areas at risk for mudslides and flooding; the law had passed in 2012, but initially lacked the authority to enforce it. Some residents in Tamaulipas complained at the slow pace of receiving aid. In response, the Gulf Cartel brought relief items to Aldama, with one columnist for El Universal suggesting that this was to gain favor with local residents.|$|E

25|$|In {{the field}} of housing, Brandt stated that {{the aims of the}} SPD-FDP {{government}} were improving housing benefit, developing a long-term programme of social <b>housing</b> <b>construction,</b> and to increase owner-occupation.

40|$|Malay {{houses have}} a great {{variation}} in construction systems despite their consistencies. With the coding method shown in this study, construction elements and their relations are presented in both words and symbols. In this study there are 95 house cases that have been coded and studied according to their construction processes. The study shows that the construction systems of Malay houses are composed {{of the house and}} its encroachment, and each house is composed of supports and a roof. The two major systems of support are the “bridge” and “box”. Their roof variation generates five sub-systems of <b>house</b> <b>construction.</b> Encroachments can be divided into encroached semi-house (Es), encroached house (Eh), and encroached selang (Esg). There are 15 Es, 3 Eh, and 2 Esg in the 95 cases studied. The completion of <b>house</b> <b>construction</b> coding facilitates the description of the <b>house</b> <b>construction,</b> comprehension of uniqueness and limitation of house forms, along with the establishment of Malay <b>house</b> <b>construction</b> systems. The evolution and adaptability of the Malay <b>house</b> <b>construction</b> system can thus be understood more precisely...|$|R
