40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of pen flooring-type in front of the feed-bunk, the slipperiness and the flooring-type in the holding pen on gait of Alberta free-stall housed dairy cattle. Fifty-one dairy <b>farms</b> <b>with</b> at least 70 Holstein milking cows and no access to pasture were selected from a list provided by the hoof trimmers from the Alberta Hoof Health Project. On these farms slipperiness and flooring type in the feeding alley and in the holding pen was recorded. Forty focal cows were gait scored (limping, head bob, asymmetric steps and tracking-up). In order to calculate odds ratios, farms were divided in groups: <b>Farms</b> <b>with</b> < 15 % of lame cows and <b>farms</b> <b>with</b> ≥ 15 % lame cows. <b>Farms</b> <b>with</b> < 25 % asymmetric cows and <b>farms</b> <b>with</b> ≥ 25 % asymmetric cows. <b>Farms</b> <b>with</b> < 60 % under-tracking cows and <b>farms</b> <b>with</b> ≥ 60 % under-tracking cows. Because of the small number of <b>farms</b> <b>with</b> other flooring than grooved concrete in the feeding area of the pen and in the holding pen, odds ratios could not be calculated. Slipperiness did not have a significant effect on gait of dairy cows...|$|R

30|$|The {{results from}} the {{analysis}} suggested four major farm types in the study areas – (i) capital-intensive large diversified <b>farms</b> <b>with</b> high economic efficiency, (ii) management-intensive, medium, diversified <b>farms</b> <b>with</b> moderate economic efficiency, (iii) small, subsistence <b>farms</b> <b>with</b> high off-farm income and high economic efficiency, and (iv) large diversified owner-cultivated <b>farms</b> <b>with</b> relatively lower economic efficiency. Smaller farms have inclined towards non-farm income more than the medium and large farms. On the other hand, medium and large farms have diversified more than smaller <b>farms</b> <b>with</b> a departure from grain-based systems to vegetable-based farming systems. This asks for a holistic farm planning and extension intervention than confining efforts to technology transfer alone. India, along {{with a large number}} of countries having agrarian society, has entered the open economy regime and need to establish economic efficiency for their smallholder system (Birner et al. [2009]). The extension system must precisely target agricultural inputs, advisory services, credit access and critical information for identified farm. The selection of beneficiaries for many public extension programs may also be guided by such farm typology.|$|R

40|$|In <b>Farming</b> <b>with</b> a Future (FwF) farmers, {{together}} with extension officers and researchers, work towards sustainable production systems for arable crops, open air vegetables, flower bulbs and ornamental trees. Systematic measurements of water quality on the participating farms are conducted by RIVM; {{for the first}} time in 2002. The results of these measurements are presented and discussed in this report. Special attention is paid to the concentration of several forms of nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P), and the relationships with land use and the physical environment. The groundwater of 15 of the 37 farms investigated presented nitrate concentrations (farm averages) below the boundary value of 50 mg/l (as NO 3). Groundwater of the <b>farms</b> <b>with</b> arable crops on clay soils and of those with flower bulbs presented the lowest nitrate concentrations as compared to groundwater of the other farm sectors. The highest concentrations were found in groundwater of <b>farms</b> <b>with</b> open air vegetables, followed by the <b>farms</b> <b>with</b> ornamental trees. These differences are partly explained by differences in the physical environment. Farms on 'wet' soils, including all flower bulb farms and arable farms on clay, present lower concentrations than farms on naturally well-drained soils with a deep groundwater table. However, when physical environments appear to be comparable (sandy soils), <b>farms</b> <b>with</b> open air vegetables generally present higher groundwater nitrate concentrations than <b>farms</b> <b>with</b> arable crops. With respect to groundwater P-concentrations, among the participating <b>farms,</b> the ones <b>with</b> flower bulbs clearly present the highest values, (average farm average total-P = 7, 4 mg/l), followed by those with arable crops on clay soils (average 0, 61 mg/l) and a few <b>farms</b> <b>with</b> arable crops on sandy soils. The most important factors determining the high groundwater P-concentrations on the <b>farms</b> <b>with</b> flower bulbs seem to be the small phosphate retention capacity of the sandy dune soils where flower bulbs are produced; heavy applications of manure and fertilisers (especially in the past); the shallow groundwater level and the practice of deep tillage. Ditch water samples were taken on 5 <b>farms</b> <b>with</b> arable crops on clay and 3 <b>farms</b> <b>with</b> flower bulbs. In all cases, farm average total-N concentrations exceeded the FwF goal for surface water (2, 2 mg/l). With respect to total-P, farm average concentrations where within the FwF goal (0, 15 mg/l) on 3 of the <b>farms</b> <b>with</b> arable crops on clay, but exceeded this goal on all flower bulb farms investigated. It is questioned however, to which extent the FwF goals for surface water may be applied to each farm individually. Differences between the quality of groundwater, drain water and ditch water seem to be primarily related to the period of sampling, as well as to the residence time of the water in the soil...|$|R

40|$|Sensor {{systems for}} oestrus and disease {{detection}} are increasingly used on dairy farms. It is, however, not known whether using sensor systems also improves production, health, reproduction and economic {{performance of the}} farm. The first objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the effect of sensor systems on milk production, days to first service and somatic cell count of the herd. The second objective is to investigate the impact of investment in sensor systems on several cost components and revenues. Data on production, health and reproduction over the years 2003 - 2013 was available for 414 Dutch dairy <b>farms</b> <b>with</b> sensor systems on an automatic milking system (n= 103), with sensor systems on a conventional milking system (n= 49) and without (n= 262) sensor systems. In addition, farm accounting data of 217 dairy <b>farms</b> <b>with</b> sensor systems on an automatic milking system (n= 54), with sensor systems on a conventional milking system (n= 36) and without (n= 127) sensor systems was available for the years 2008 - 2013. Having sensor systems was associated with a higher average production per cow on <b>farms</b> <b>with</b> an automatic milking system, and with a lower average production per cow on <b>farms</b> <b>with</b> a conventional milking system in the years after investment. <b>Farms</b> <b>with</b> an automatic milking system had on average 12, 000 cells/ml higher somatic cell count after adoption of the sensor system whereas <b>farms</b> <b>with</b> a conventional milking system had on average 10, 000 cells/ml lower somatic cell count. Total capital costs and milk revenues increased after investment in sensor systems on <b>farms</b> <b>with</b> an automatic milking system.

He then turned to highway robbery and was moderately successful for a time. He shot Sir Zachary Wilmott during a robbery on the road between Wellington and Taunton. The proceeds from his crimes supported him for a time but in the long term he was unable to clear his debts. In 1694, following a row with his wife, he went to visit his uncle. His uncle was not at home and he killed his aunt and her five children and took around £60 from the house. On returning home he was asked about the bloodstains on his clothes by his wife.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the characteristics of the dairy farms that installed an automatic milking system (AMS). A survey of 38 dairy <b>farms</b> <b>with</b> AMS, in Galicia (Spain), collected information on quantitative and qualitative variables. Following elimination of redundant variables, categorical principal component analysis identified 4 factors accounting for 43. 7 % of the total variance. Using these factors, the farms studied were subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis which differentiated 4 types of farms: (A) <b>farms</b> <b>with</b> more leisure and quality of life where the AMS covered the expectations of farmers (29 %); (B) farms that removed cows more often due to AMS and farmers with more stress (34 %); (C) <b>farms</b> <b>with</b> little leisure and farmers with no successor (21 %); (D) large <b>farms</b> <b>with</b> many fulltime employees (FTE) where the AMS had covered farmer’s expectations the least (11 %). Generally the farms were based on a family structure with a high percentage of FTE. With the adoption of AMS these farms sought to increase milk production, save labour and have more flexibility. With 87 % of <b>farms</b> <b>with</b> free cow traffic the activity that took the most of the farmer’s time was fetching cows for milking (1 h/day).
