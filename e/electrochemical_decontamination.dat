40|$|Based on the {{principles}} of the technique of electroremediation (<b>electrochemical</b> <b>decontamination),</b> experiments were carried out with the purpose to determine the buffer capacity of two soils from the region of Antioquia, Colombia, using a new method. These studies included the analysis of variation of the conductivity and residual pH in selected soils, after application of an electric field. From the different obtained parameters a function was defined combining the values of pH in zones close to the cathodic chamber with the corresponding one to the blank. This function allows obtaining a measurement of the buffer capacity of the soils. In this case the function represents the easiness for changing the pH when the electric field is applied and therefore it would not only have agricultural utility, but also to evaluate the behaviour {{in the case of a}} <b>electrochemical</b> <b>decontamination</b> treatment. The observed variations in the function are in agreement with those obtained when acid or bases solutions are added to soils...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the method of}} regeneration of spent <b>electrochemical</b> <b>decontamination</b> solution. The proposed method allows separation of radionuclides and stable metals from spent decontamination solution in a form suitable for final disposal and repeated use of the remaining solution for <b>electrochemical</b> <b>decontamination.</b> Development of this method {{was based on the}} results of the speciation studies which showed that Fe(III) can be precipitated in the presence of organic complexing agents, in a form of iron hydroxide, and Ag- 110 m, Co- 60, Mn- 54 radionuclides can be coprecipitated on it. In order to verify the conclusions made as a result of the speciation studies, the experiments with electrochemically prepared simulant solution and real solution were carried out. The test results proved that the proposed method can be applied in practice. Treatment of the ultimately spent decontamination solutions can be also made applying iron precipitation, which allows for removal of the bulk amount of contaminants, as the first step. Then, if necessary the remaining radionuclides can be removed by sorption. A series of novel absorbers has been tested for their potential for the sorption removal of the remaining radionuclides from the supernate. The test results showed that most of them were more effective in neutral or alkaline range of pH, however, the high efficiency of the sorption removal can be achieved only after the removal of the oxalic and citric acids from solution...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. One of ABB Atom's methods under development, ELDECON, is an <b>electrochemical</b> process for <b>decontamination</b> of components used in nuclear power plants. ELDECON removes radioactive species while producing small amounts of waste. However, the waste sludge that is produced in the ELDECON process contains chromate (Cr 6 +), which makes it a mixed waste problem (Cr 6 + and radioactivity). According to 40 CFR 261, if a process in any step creates chromate, the final waste has to be tested in a toxicity characteristic leachate procedure. In order to pass the test, the chromate have to be reduced to chromium (Cr 3 +). Electrochemistry {{has proven to be a}} valuable tool. When incorporating indirect electrolysis into the ELDECON concept, the chromate (Cr 6 +) ions are being reduced. This is done by the use of an electrochemical cell (reactor bed). The method involves ferric nitrate as a reagent, which besides converting the chromate completely, also decreases the reaction time. The experiment showed a linear relationship to reduce varying amounts of solution. This makes the test cell feasible to scale up and use in the industry. Ion exchange was also studied as an alternative method of reducing chromate. However, the ion exchange resins investigated were not efficient enough to effectively reduce and exchange the chromate ions...|$|R
40|$|Many {{decontamination}} {{methods have}} been developed for the decommissioning of the NPP A- 1. In the last few years, the activities have been directed mainly at trials and applications of the developed methods in dismantling tasks. Decontaminated are steel for free release, also tanks and circuits containing sludge and deposits with high contents of radionuclides. The combination of decontamination methods, such as chemical and electrochemical bath decontamination, ultrasound, solid particles blasting, and <b>electrochemical</b> <b>decontamination</b> in situ, are often used. Soil decontamination by phytoextraction is under development. INTRODUCTION The NPP A- 1 Jaslovske Bohunice with a 150 MW gascooled reactor moderated by the heavy water was shut down after an accident in 1977, and it is under decommissioning now. Many primary circuit installations, auxiliary loops, and other objects of the NPP are heavily contaminated. This requires laboratory preparation and development (Majersky 1993) followed [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL) {{conducted}} an comprehensive literature review of actual reactor decontamination {{processes that are}} currently available. In general, any decontamination process {{should be based on}} the following criteria: effectiveness, efficiency, safety, and waste production. The information that was collected and analyzed has been divided into three major categories of decontamination: chemical, mechanical, and electrochemical. Chemical methods can be further classified as either low-concentration, singlestep processes or high-concentration, single- or multistep processes. Numerous chemical decontamination methods are detailed. Mechanical decontamination methods are usually restricted to the removal of a contaminated surface layer, whlch limits their versatility; several mechanical decontamination methods are described. <b>Electrochemical</b> <b>decontamination.</b> is both fast and easily controlled, and numerous processes that have been used in industry for many years are discussed. Information obtained from this work is tabulated in Appendix A for easy access, and a bibliography and a glossary have been provided...|$|E
40|$|AbstractElectrokinetics is a developping {{technology}} that is intended to separate and extract heavy metals, radionuclides, and organic contaminants from saturated or unsaturated soils, sludges and sediments, and groundwater. The goal of electrokinetic remediation is to effect the migration of subsurface contaminants in an imposed electric field. This technique is known as electrokinetic remediation, electroreclamation, <b>electrochemical</b> <b>decontamination,</b> electrorestoration, electromigration or electrochemical soil processing. Electrokinetics involves the installation of electrodes into the subsurface surrounding the contaminated region. After the electrodes are in place, a low electrical potential is applied across the anode(s) (positively charged electrode) and the cathode(s) (negatively charged electrode). As {{a result of the}} electrical gradient, different physico-chemical reactions occur and contaminant transport occurs due to various mechanisms within the soil and groundwater. Generally, for the migration to be significant, the contaminants should be in a soluble form. If they are not soluble, they need to be desorbed, dissolved, and/or solubilized into the pore solution before they can be adequately transported from the soil to an electrode wells/reservoirs. Different types of contaminants have been investigated and research has been conducted to optimize the electrokinetic variables. The present study was undertaken to systematically investigate the effect of initial sludge water content, and heating on the electrokinetic remediation of alumium-contaminated sludge. A total of four laboratory experiments were conducted using drinking water sludge. The first two tests studied the effect of variation of initial sludge water content under an ambient temperature, and the last two tests studied the effect of heating on electrokinetic remediation under conditions of both constant saturation and applied voltage...|$|E
40|$|Currently in {{the nuclear}} industry, surface {{contamination}} {{in the form of}} radioactive metal or metal oxide deposits is most commonly removed by chemical decontamination, <b>electrochemical</b> <b>decontamination</b> or physical attrition. Physical attrition techniques are generally used on structural materials (concrete, plaster), with (electro) chemical methods being used to decontaminate metallic or painted surfaces. The most common types of (electro) chemical decontamination are the use of simple mineral acids such as nitric acid or cerium (IV) oxidation (MEDOC). Use of both of these reagents frequently results in the dissolution of a layer of the substrate surface increasing the percentage of secondary waste which leads to burdens on downstream effluent treatment and waste management plants. In this context, both mineral acids and MEDOC can be indiscriminate in the surfaces attacked during deployment, e. g. attacking in transit through a pipe system to the site of contamination resulting in both diminished effect of the decontaminating reagent upon arrival at its target site and an increased secondary waste management requirement. This provides two main requirements for a more ideal decontamination reagent: Improved area specificity and a dissolution power equal to or greater than the previously mentioned current decontaminants. Photochemically promoted processes may provide such a decontamination technique. Photochemical reduction of metal ion valence states to aid in heavy metal deposition has already been extensively studied [I], with reductive manipulation also being achieved with uranium and plutonium simulants (Ce) [2]. Importantly photooxidation of a variety of metals, including neptunium [3], has also been achieved. Here we report on the potential application of this technology to metal dissolution...|$|E
