5|$|Stone's tears first roll <b>down</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> in micro-gravity, and are later seen {{floating}} off her face. After being pushed from her eye by her eyelid, the surface tension {{is not sufficient}} for the tears to continue adhering to her jawline. However, the movie correctly portrays the spherical nature of drops of liquid in a micro-gravity environment.|$|E
25|$|The {{music video}} {{is set in}} three {{different}} locations: a hotel lobby, a bedroom, and on the beach. Although it was originally reported that both winners would appear in the video, only one was finally chosen to star. The others {{can be seen in}} minor roles as guests and workers in the lobby. The video chronicles the romance and conflict between the singer and his love interest, while making heavy use of visual art, with each scene presented as a watercolour painting, while in the intervals close-ups of Rouvas singing in front of a black background are shown. Additional artwork is shown of the surrounding environment, including buildings, the night sky, and birds flying across the sky. Throughout the video a live action/animation effect called rotoscoping is utilized, a first in Greek cinematography. It begins with Rouvas asleep and moves to him and his love interest sitting in a hotel lobby while the assistant brings over their luggage. They appear to be in a conflict, facing different directions. They then appear on the beach on better terms, while advertisements for the song's sponsor, Trident, are shown when the two characters each take a stick of gum. Snippets of love scenes are also played, while in some parts they are each shown separately and close-up shots show the woman's make-up smeared from crying, while animated tears also run <b>down</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> During the bridge the two finally face each other in the lobby scene and as they lean in to kiss the rotoscoping animation momentarily smooths out. This is followed by another love scene and ends with the two walking out of the room.|$|E
500|$|Gaga {{performed}} the song at the 2013 YouTube Music Awards on November 3, 2013. She {{arrived on the}} red carpet of the event wearing the same pair of rotten, yellow teeth she wore on the cover art. John Walker from MTV News analyzed Gaga's look to be a combination of the snake from Tim Burton's 1988 fantasy film, Beetlejuice, the Scarecrow character from DC Comics and the rocker Marilyn Manson. During the performance, the singer wore a flannel shirt, her natural hair and a snapback with the NASA symbol altered to read DOPE and her face was devoid of any make-up. She performed a piano only version of [...] "Dope", without any other instrumentation and with tears falling <b>down</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> Gaga exited the stage while shaking hands and hugging the members of the audience.|$|E

500|$|Amy Odell of New York {{magazine}} {{praised the}} video and noted that [...] "the crazy twitchy behavior she exhibited in 'Telephone' returns to much delight, but with a wardrobe that's pure housewife instead of cold-blooded drag-queen murderer." [...] Odell also praised the playsuits in the video, which according to here were [...] "a classier, more mature version of 'tards." [...] In another review, Odell concluded [...] "It {{would be easy to}} credit the look of Beyoncé's new video to Lady Gaga's influence." [...] Francesca Stabile of The Village Voice gave a positive review for the video, writing, [...] "The retro-glam outfits, the oversized martini glass, the rolling around on the bed sobbing with eye makeup running <b>down</b> <b>her</b> <b>face...</b> this is our favorite Bey video ever. No one else can make doing household chores (dusting Grammys!) simultaneously look this good and this sad." [...] Gordon Smart of The Sun praised Knowles' [...] "strong look" [...] completed by lumberjack shirt, bandana and denim hotpants in the video further comparing it with Amy Winehouse's. Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone magazine described the video as a [...] "Douglas Sirk film through the eyes of David LaChapelle" [...] and noted that several scenes looked like Knowles was being photographed for Vogue magazine on the set of The Brady Bunch. He concluded that [...] "If Beyoncé was lobbying for a temptress role on Mad Men, 'Why Don't You Love Me,'... would make the perfect audition reel." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} pilot {{script was}} darker in tone {{than the one}} filmed. Thomas intended to take the script to FX, HBO or Showtime, but gave UPN [...] "credit" [...] as they only wanted it a bit lighter to match their standards and practices. There was also a lengthy debate as to whether Veronica could be a rape victim; UPN eventually consented. In the aired version of the episode, Lilly Kane was found by the pool {{in the same spot}} where she was murdered. However, Thomas stated that Lilly's body was originally going {{to be found in the}} ocean, and he had a plan for events which led to Lilly's body being dumped. When Thomas pitched the idea to UPN, the network felt that it was [...] "too dark and creepy" [...] for Jake Kane to dispose of his daughter's body to protect his son, and the idea was changed. Much of the series' scenes were filmed at Stu Segall Productions in San Diego. During the filming of the pilot, producer Paul Kurta said that much of the filming would take place in Oceanside, California. Kurta liked that it was [...] "a seaside town that still feels like middle-class people live there ... Most of the seaside towns feel resort driven." [...] The setting of Neptune High, which was featured in the first two seasons, was also located in Oceanside. The school, Oceanside High School, was paid $7,750 by Stu Segall Productions for the use of the campus and extras. When Thomas watched the final cut of the scene in which Veronica realizes that she has been raped, Thomas thought that he had cast the role correctly. [...] "I’m watching her from the monitor, and tears start streaming <b>down</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> and I’m just like, 'Holy shit! We have a star!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Gloria Foster died on September 29, 2001, at age 67. The {{cause of}} her death was diabetes. Though {{she was no longer}} married, her ex-husband, Clarence Williams III, was the one to {{announce}} her death. [...] A memorial was held at Cypress Hills Cemetery in Brooklyn on October 15, 2001. Many of her close friends and actors and actresses who had performed with her came to attend the funeral. [...] Judith Rutherford James, a well-known producer and good friend who worked with Foster on In White America and Having Our Say played a huge part in the memorial service and helped to oversee that it ran smoothly. [...] Many of the speeches given at the service showed and spoke about how Gloria Foster not only played her part, but also embodied the character, both emotionally and physically. [...] Martin Duberman, the author of In White America, told the audience that, [...] "she embodied it. [...] At the end of the scene each night, there were tears streaming <b>down</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> her body was trembling, but her dignity was intact...Foster had to be covered with blankets in order to calm her shaking".|$|E
