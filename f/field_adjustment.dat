ETC manufactures five interchangeable glass lenses for this fixture (four come included, while the fifth, the XWFL, is a separate purchase.) This interchangeability of the lenses is often considered an advantage, since traditional PAR fixtures require a stock of different lamps to achieve various beam angles.

50|$|Although {{there were}} many imitators, none could match {{the quality of the}} {{original}} Rolleiflex - that is, until the Mamiya C-Series from Japan appeared in 1956. Mamiya initially offered three sets of interchangeable double lenses for it: normal, telephoto and wide-angle. Later on, additional double lenses with focal lengths of 55 mm and 250 mm were introduced; one even had a dimmable viewfinder lens, which enabled depth of <b>field</b> <b>adjustment</b> through the viewfinder. By comparison, the Rolleiflex only had a single, fixed normal lens, although the Rollei Magnar tele-converter lens with 4x magnification was available as an accessory. This could be attached {{to the front of the}} primary lens while a mask (which did not magnify the image) was placed over the focusing screen. In addition, Zeiss offered two double lens converters which attached to the viewfinder filter bayonet and the primary lens bayonet. The 5-element Mutar tele-converter magnified 1.5×, weighed 327 g and could render an image accurately in the viewfinder up to a distance of 4m from the object. The 4-element Mutar wide-angle converter magnified 0.7×, weighed 437 g and could render an object accurately from a distance of 1 meter. In all cases, for the best image quality, closing down the aperture two stops was recommended. This explains why conversion lenses of this type were only regarded as a makeshift solution in comparison to fully interchangeable lenses.|$|E

The use of sunscreen adjuvants to overcome photodegradation has presented some limitations so far. Raw hydroalcoholic plant extracts have been recently proposed {{to be used}} as photoprotecting adjuvants; on a model system they significantly decreased the photodegradation of pesticide.

Sulcotrione, a selective herbicide for use in maize, was tested in a growth chamber equipped with simulated solar light against a typical weed in maize. Sprayed weeds were monitored by biometrical and physiological parameters. Sulcotrione minimum dose required for a good herbicidal efficacy (ED(50), corresponding to 50 % of chlorophyll content decay) was estimated to be 55 g ha(- 1). In the presence of grape extract added in a 3 -fold excess compared to the herbicide, the ED(50) decreased to 34 g ha(- 1).

40|$|International audienceThe AC {{electromagnetic}} field effects in molten metal are investigated {{to account for}} the mixing of particles (grain refiners, micro/nano additives, impurities, broken metal dendrite agglomerates, bubbles) during the full melting/solidification cycle. The particles travel due to the hydrodynamic drag, buoyancy, turbulent fluctuations and the electromagnetic force action via the local pressure distribution around the particle. The time average effects are investigated previously using approximation derived for a uniform electric and magnetic fields. In the presence of AC field the force distribution is non-uniform, confined to an exponential skin-layer near the outer surface of liquid. This typically results in high mixing rates and an intense turbulence in the bulk of molten metal, additionally contributing to the particle dispersion. The paper attempts to demonstrate the importance of each of the mentioned effects to the organized particle ‘swarm’ like transport and the eventual distribution. Three different examples of the mixing flows generated by AC fields are presented: a travelling field stirring during directional solidification, the semi-levitation dynamic melting and the contactless top coil ‘immersion’ mixing involving the dynamic AC <b>field</b> <b>adjustment.</b> The Lagrangian particle tracking in the presence of strong AC electromagnetic force field gives new perspectives {{to the understanding of the}} melting and casting processes...|$|E

We also observe that the reconstruction error in RACS has a complex relation to the current coherence time of the field and factors like the position of targets, their velocity, etc. Thus, by making the algorithm depend on the detection and localization of targets, we ensure that the rate adjustment is tied in to our actual objective.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{efficiency}} of a finite element mass consistent model for wind <b>field</b> <b>adjustment</b> {{depends on the}} stability parameter α which allows adjustment from a strictly horizontal wind to a pure vertical one. Each simulation with the wind model leads to the resolution of a linear system of equations, the matrix of which depends on a function ε(α), i. e., (M+εN) xε=bε, where M and N are constant, symmetric and positive definite matrices with the same sparsity pattern for a given level of discretization. The estimation of this parameter may {{be carried out by}} using genetic algorithms. This procedure requires the evaluation of a fitness function for each individual of the population defined in the searching space of α, that is, the resolution of one linear system of equations for each value of α. Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient algorithm (PCG) is usually applied for the resolution of these types of linear systems due to its good convergence results. In order to solve this set of linear systems, we could either construct a different preconditioner for each of them or use a single preconditioner constructed from the first value of ε to solve all the systems. In this paper, an intermediate approach is proposed. An incomplete Cholesky factorization of matrix Aε is constructed for the first linear system and it is updated for each ε at a low computational cost. Numerical experiments related to realistic wind field are presented in order to show the performance of the proposed preconditioning strategy...|$|E
