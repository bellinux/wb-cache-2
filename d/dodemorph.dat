40|$|On 18 farms for rose {{culture in}} {{greenhouses}} in The Netherlands dermal exposure of hands and forearms to abamectin, <b>dodemorph</b> and bupirimate during crop activities has been measured. Furthermore, dermal exposure of hands and forearms to abamectin and <b>dodemorph</b> during application by high-volume spraying has been measured. Dermal exposure to abamectin, <b>dodemorph</b> and bupirimate during cutting by 75 workers in total is respectively 13 microg/h, 1. 8 mg/h and 2. 2 mg/h (geometric mean; activity ingredient). During sorting and bundling of roses by respectively 21 and 30 workers, dermal exposure to abamectin and <b>dodemorph</b> is 18 microg/h and 1. 9 mg/h. An indicative prevalence of handeczema of 14 % {{was found in}} 50 workers using a validated questionnaire and an additional interview. A health risk evaluation of the observed levels of dermal exposure after re-entry of greenhouses leads {{to the conclusion that}} a health risk may exist, especially after high application doses of relatively toxic pesticides with good skin penetrating properties...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{prevalence}} of pesticide contamination {{and the risk of}} floristsâ€™ exposure when handling cut flowers, sampling and analysis of 90 bouquets of the most commonly sold cut flowers in Belgium (50 bouquets of roses; 20 of gerberas, and 20 of chrysanthemums) were carried out. The bouquets were collected from 50 florists located in the seven largest cities of Belgium (Antwerp, Brussels, Charleroi, Ghent, Leuven, Liege, and Namur) and from five supermarkets located in the different regions. To {{have a better understanding of}} the route of exposure and professional practices a questionnaire was also addressed to a group of 25 florists who volunteered to take part in the survey. All florists were interviewed individually when collecting the questionnaire. The residual pesticide deposit values on cut flowers were determined in an accredited laboratory using a multi-residue (QuEChERS Quick Easy Cheap Effective Rugged Safe) method and a combination of gas chromatography (GC) and liquid chormatograhphy (LC) analysis. A total of 107 active substances were detected from all samples; i. e., an average of about 10 active substances per bouquet. The most severely contaminated bouquet accumulated a total concentration of residues up to 97 mg/kg. Results show that roses are the most contaminated cut flowers; with an average of 14 substances detected per sample and a total concentration per rose sample of 26 mg/kg. Some active substances present an acute toxicity (acephate, methiocarb, monocrotophos, methomyl, deltamethrin, etc.) and exposure can generate a direct effect on the nervous system of florists. Nevertheless, fungicides (<b>dodemorph,</b> propamocarb, and procymidone) were the most frequently detected in samples and had the highest maximum concentrations out of all the active substances analysed. <b>Dodemorph</b> was the most frequently detected substance with the highest maximum concentration (41. 9 mg/kg) measured in the rose samples. It appears from the survey that, despite being exposed to high deposits of residues, florists usually do not protect themselves from contact with residues even if they spend several hours handling cut flowers and preparing bouquets (from 2 to 6 h/day, depending on the time of year and/or selling periods) daily. Bad habits (eating, drinking, or smoking at work) and absence of personal protective equipment of most florists also increase the risk of contact with pesticide residues. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Fenpropimorph-resistant mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were {{isolated}} by a gradient selection procedure. The mutants were cross-resistant to other morpholines (fenpropidin, <b>dodemorph,</b> tridemorph) and 15 -azasterol, but were susceptible to azoles (miconazole, clotrimazole, ketoconazole) and nystatin. In {{the absence of}} fenpropimorph, the major sterol produced by the mutants and the parental strain was ergosterol. In the presence of fenpropimorph, ignosterol (ergosta- 8, 14 -dien- 3 beta-ol) was the major sterol produced by the mutants and the parental strain. The resistance to fenpropimorph involves two recessive genes, each of which allows a semiresistance, when they are isolated apart from one another. Strain JR 4 (erg 3 erg 11), which produces 14 -methylfecosterol [14 alpha-methyl-ergosta- 8, 24 (28) -dien- 3 -beta-ol) as the major sterol in {{the presence or absence}} of fenpropimorph, was also found to be resistant to the drug. The growth inhibitory effect of fenpropimorph on wild-type cells appears to be linked to the production of ignosterol. The uptake of exogenous sterol by wild-type cells was greatly enhanced in the presence of fenpropimorph. The growth inhibition caused by fenpropimorph could only be overcome with bulk levels of exogenous C- 5, 6 -unsaturated sterols...|$|E
40|$|As in any {{intensive}} culture, flowers {{require the}} use {{of a wide range of}} pesticides to control diseases and pests which can damage production and marketability. In order to evaluate the average levels of contamination of the cut flowers and to assess the risk for professionals exposed to pesticide residues when handling cut flowers, a survey was carried out with a group of florists from the Belgian largest cities. Fifty samples of roses (5 stems per bouquet) were collected: 45 bouquets were sampled in the 7 largest cities of Belgium (Antwerp, Brussels, Charleroi, Ghent, Leuven, Liege and Namur) and 5 were sampled from 5 supermarkets. Analysis of residual pesticide deposit is made by combining two multi-residue methods (GC-MS-MS and LC-MS-MS) in a laboratory accredited for pesticide residues. For all the samples analysed, a total of 97 active substances were detected, i. e. an average of 14 active substances per bouquet and a total average pesticide load of 26, 03 mg/kg per flower sample. Most active substances (a. s.) reached high levels of residues, with concentrations between 10 and 50 mg/kg. Samples from Belgium and The Netherlands have a lower average number of a. s. /sample, but the amount of residues is about the same in all samples (20 - 30 mg/kg) whatever the country of origin, except for the sample from Germany who is the worst case (22 a. s. with a total amount of 92 mg/kg). Most of the detected active substances are fungicides (<b>dodemorph,</b> spiroxamine, cyprodinil, fluopyram, pyrimethanil, benomyl (carbendazim), propamocarb, boscalid and iprodione) which are present on more than 20 of the 50 samples. All of them have a dermal acute toxicity. Consequently, florists who handle a large number of flowers are exposed daily with a potential effect on their health. Peer reviewe...|$|E
