50|$|Eleanor Roosevelt, who {{screened}} {{the area}} {{off from the}} Central Hall, particularly enjoyed it. In the subsequent Truman reconstruction, architects enclosed the hall with solid partitions and created a living room. At that time, the <b>kitchen</b> <b>elevator</b> was extended to this floor, and the door opened into this room; the Kennedy restoration rerouted it into the little hall when {{the room to the}} north was converted into the Family Kitchen. During the Truman reconstruction the east wall was rebuilt to include framed double doors allowing the room more privacy.|$|E
50|$|Nilfisk {{was founded}} in Denmark in 1906 by Peder Andersen Fisker (1875-1975) and Hans Marius Nielsen (1870-1954) as Fisker & Nielsen. Originally the company {{produced}} electrical engines as the basic component in ventilators, <b>kitchen</b> <b>elevators,</b> drilling machines and, later on, the Nimbus motorcycle. The Nilfisk vacuum cleaner of 1910, weighed 17.5 kilos. Fisker took out a patent on this invention and later bought out Nielsen. The vacuum cleaner outsold the other products, and the other engine products were gradually phased out. By 1954, the company had sold 1 million vacuum cleaners.|$|R
50|$|In 1996, the Van Horne store {{location}} {{was closed and}} all operations were transferred to the Cavendish Mall location, which was expanded to include two-floors, a full <b>kitchen,</b> an <b>elevator,</b> a smokehouse, and three coolers over 10,000 square feet.|$|R

5000|$|With much of Saddam Hussein's palace {{complexes}} shrouded behind stone walls, few knew {{much about}} the facilities inside. The Flintstone House received notoriety with US soldiers due to its unique appearance and was thus named since little else was known about the facility prior to the US occupation of the site. The facility is best described as an elaborate playhouse for children, in its prime having running water, operable <b>kitchen</b> and <b>elevators.</b> The name [...] "Flintstone" [...] conveys a comparison to the animated sitcom [...] "The Flintstones", due to the facilities stone-age appearance.|$|R
50|$|In 2008 {{the college}} {{undertook}} an extensive renovation project on Boone Tavern {{at an estimated}} cost of $9.6 million, {{with the aim of}} converting it into Kentucky's first LEED-certified hotel while preserving its historic character. The renovation was projected to be completed in May 2009. Planned changes included replacing the hotel's <b>kitchen</b> and service <b>elevator,</b> increasing the number of guest rooms from 58 to 64, restoring skylights in the dining room, and adding a new two-story portico entrance on the east facade.|$|R
40|$|On your one-minute {{walk from}} the coffee machine to your desk each morning, you pass by dozens of scenes – a <b>kitchen,</b> an <b>elevator,</b> your office – and you {{effortlessly}} recognize them and perceive their 3 D structure. But this one-minute scene-understanding problem has been an open challenge in computer vision since the field was first established 50 years ago. In this dissertation, we aim to rethink the path researchers took over these years, challenge the standard practices and implicit assumptions in the current research, and redefine several basic principles in computational scene understanding. The key idea of this dissertation is that learning from rich data under natural setting is crucial for finding the right representation for scene understanding. First of all, to overcome the limitations of object-centric datasets, we built the Scene Understanding (SUN) Database, a large collection of real-world images that exhaustively spans all scene categories. This scene-centric dataset provides a more natural sample of human visual world, and establishes a realistic benchmark for standard 2 D recognition tasks. However, while an image is a 2 D array, the world is 3 D and our eyes see it from a viewpoint, but this is no...|$|R
5000|$|Mary H. Donlon Hall, or DONLON Hall, is a {{residence}} hall {{located at the}} center of North Campus and has a gross area of 133594 sq ft and net area of 116094 sq ft. Built in 1961, it houses 472 first-year students arranged in double rooms (with a few singles and two [...] "quads," [...] three room suites for four students, per floor), typically sized 12' x 18'. It has a unique triangular structure separated onto 6 floors. Facilities include a TV/social lounge, piano, laundry, <b>elevator,</b> <b>kitchen,</b> computer networking, study lounge, lofting furniture, and library. The study lounge located on the first floor is nicknamed 'The Morgue' due to its notoriously dim lighting, silence, and freezing temperatures for most of the year.|$|R
40|$|Embedded systems {{permeate}} {{our everyday}} lives. From automobiles to <b>elevators,</b> <b>kitchen</b> appliances to televisions, and water heaters to cell phones, we increasingly depend upon embedded systems {{to operate as}} expected. An embedded system is a computer system with various application domains, such as aviation, have traditionally benefited from extraordinary care during development to ensure that everything is done correctly. But increasingly, everyday embedded applications are becoming “mission critical,” with little fanfare and perhaps without the full attention to dependability properties that they truly deserve. Typically embedded systems have low computing power and finite energy supply based on a battery, and these factors {{are at odds with}} the computationally intensive nature of thecryptographic algorithms underlying many security protocols. In addition, secure embedded systems are vulnerable to attacks, like physical tampering, malware and side-channel attacks...|$|R
50|$|They get to Carlisle's suite only to {{discover}} that Ronnie has made this his home, complete with an exercise studio, set of <b>elevators,</b> <b>kitchen,</b> and movie theatre. They discover that Ronnie has a video system all about the Paragon and has been spying on them all the time. Then Ronnie himself appears on the screen and waves to them while welding the door they got in from shut. Seemingly trapped, the elevator starts to come up. Balenger aims his gun at it, but when the doors open Rick steps out, still barely alive and impaled by a piece of furniture. An ecstatic Cora runs toward him, only for Rick to die again in her arms. She begins to cry, but is suddenly shot from under the floor. Ronnie has made a system under the floor and could hear Cora and shoot at her. Vinnie begins to weep for the now dead Cora but Balenger stops him, insisting that Ronnie can hear them from underneath. In the confusion, Tod disappears.|$|R
50|$|Originally, a suite {{was planned}} for the Disney family and executives, but since Walt Disney died nearly five years before the park opened, it {{remained}} unfinished, and eventually was turned successively into a telephone call center, a dressing room, and is currently a lavish Dream Suite hotel room for specially selected guests. There are three elevators inside the castle. One is for guest use and goes between the lobby of Cinderella's Royal Table, and the second floor where the restaurant is. The second is for restaurant staff use, and is located in tower 2 {{to the left of}} the drawbridge. It has landings in the Utilidors, the mezzanine level in a break room, and on the second floor in the <b>kitchen.</b> The third <b>elevator</b> is in tower 20, and services the Utilidors, the breezeway, the kitchen of Cinderella's Royal Table, and the Cinderella Castle Suite. The suite is about 30 ft below the level where the cable is attached to tower 20. Access to the cable is by ladder. From January 2007 to December 2009 the suite was used as a prize for the Disney Dreams Giveaway at the Walt Disney World Resort during the Year of a Million Dreams celebration.|$|R

This scene-centric dataset provides a more natural sample of human visual world, and establishes a realistic benchmark for standard 2 D recognition tasks. However, while an image is a 2 D array, the world is 3 D and our eyes see it from a viewpoint, {{but this is not}} traditionally modeled. To obtain a 3 D understanding at high-level, we reintroduce geometric figures using modern machinery. To model scene viewpoint, we propose a panoramic place representation to go beyond aperture computer vision and use data that is close to natural input for human visual system. This paradigm shift toward rich representation also opens up new challenges that require a new kind of big data - data with extra descriptions, namely rich data. Specifically, we focus on a highly valuable kind of rich data - multiple viewpoints in 3 D - and we build the SUN 3 D database to obtain an integrated place-centric representation of scenes. We argue for the great importance of modeling the computer's role as an agent in a 3 D scene, and demonstrate the power of place-centric scene representation. by Jianxiong Xiao. Thesis (Ph. D.)
