500|$|Urey and Washburn {{attempted}} to use electrolysis to create pure heavy water. Their technique was sound, {{but they were}} beaten to it in 1933 by Lewis, who had {{the resources of the}} University of California at his disposal. Using the Born–Oppenheimer approximation, Urey and David Rittenberg calculated the properties of gases containing hydrogen and deuterium. They extended this to enriching compounds of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. These could be used as tracers in biochemistry, resulting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> way of examining chemical reactions.

500|$|He later {{decided that}} this could be done by using the Arabian Nights—a {{compilation}} of Middle-Eastern fables—as the game's setting. This inspired the use of Sonic characters as figures from Arabian Nights. Sega removed [...] "some of the extraneous elements" [...] of recent Sonic games to [...] "get ... back to basics". [...] Storyboard director Zachary G. Brown stated that, [...] "This game could put Sonic the Hedgehog <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> light. He could reach {{the top of the charts}} once more." [...] The game's art and setting were heavily influenced by the games Shadow of the Colossus, Prince of Persia, and God of War. Its cutscenes consistently feature hand-painted, static imagery resembling classic art through paint on parchment. On a technical level, Secret Rings uses the PhysX engine. Sega improved the game's camera system to address criticisms of prior Sonic games.|$|E
500|$|The Way I See It {{also earned}} Saadiq the highest {{international}} profile of his career.

It also continued his partnership with Charles Brungart, who assisted Saadiq in recording Stone Rollin.|$|E

2500|$|The {{basic concept}} of Pyst {{was to show}} what Myst Island (from the best-selling game) would look like after four million people (players) had visited and [...] "explored".

However, a spokesman from Broderbund said the company was unfazed with the project, commenting [...] "We've seen imitators and they usually just give us a good chuckle". Bergman discovered that the sense of comic timing he had become accustomed to in his live shows couldn't be replicated in the digital realm, and had to adapt accordingly.

50|$|Heavy {{destruction}} in World War II {{as well as}} post-war demolition to erect a truly socialist city centre left the city with a vast open space around its town hall where once a vibrant city heart had been.

Comparable to Potsdamer Platz <b>in</b> Berlin, <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> quarter of the city was constructed in recent years.
