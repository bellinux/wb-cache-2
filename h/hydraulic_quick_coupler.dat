50|$|The {{market for}} <b>quick</b> <b>couplers</b> is mainly {{supplied}} {{by a large}} number of small and medium-sized enterprises. Many of the manufacturers of <b>quick</b> <b>couplers</b> are small, flexible and innovative, leading to the wide variation in design concepts. Many Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) of construction equipment market a range of <b>quick</b> <b>couplers.</b> Some of these are designed and manufactured by the OEM but more often they are the products of one of the <b>quick</b> <b>coupler</b> manufacturers branded by the OEM and sold through the OEM's distribution chain or installed by the OEM in their factory.In addition to the supply route from the OEMs many distributors of construction machinery will install <b>quick</b> <b>couplers</b> onto machines before delivery at the request of a customer. <b>Quick</b> <b>coupler</b> manufacturers will also sell direct to end-users and usually complete the installation as part of the sale.|$|R

5000|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} {{in the design of}} <b>quick</b> <b>couplers.</b> The initial divergence is between those that can pick up any of a range of buckets and attachments by clamping onto the mounting pins for the attachment (known as [...] "pin grabbers" [...] or [...] "pin couplers") and those that work only with buckets and attachments designed to suit that <b>quick</b> <b>coupler</b> (known as [...] "dedicated"). The claimed advantage of pin-grabbers is flexibility in use in that a machine owner can use a variety of buckets and attachments without changing the <b>quick</b> <b>coupler</b> or buying an adaptor. The claimed advantages of dedicated couplers depend on their individual design but often include better performance and smaller size.|$|R
50|$|<b>Quick</b> <b>couplers</b> are devices {{installed}} at the outer end of the work equipment of various types of construction and earth-moving machines. They facilitate the rapid exchange of working tools or buckets. <b>Quick</b> <b>couplers</b> are most common on hydraulic excavators and compact excavators and on the backhoe equipment of backhoe loaders, but are also installed on telescopic handlers, wheel loaders (loading shovels), skid-steer loaders and the loader equipment of backhoe-loaders. They are also occasionally installed on attachments installed on agricultural tractors.Quick couplers do not normally have a specific function themselves in {{that they do not}} carry out handling or digging operations, but when installed on a machine they {{become a part of the}} overall system. They are usually mounted on the machine by means of the pins that would otherwise be the mountings for the bucket or attachment.This article concentrates on <b>quick</b> <b>couplers</b> installed on excavators and similar equipment.|$|R

The safety device is intended to prevent the release of the bucket or attachment in the event of the failure of the hydraulic system, or other major failure of the attachment mechanism. The safety device is most commonly a pin that must be inserted to prevent one of the components in the <b>quick</b> <b>coupler</b> moving to release the bucket or attachment but some designs require the manual operation of a lever on the <b>quick</b> <b>coupler.</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based upon the work done at Westinghouse {{electric}} company (WEC) in Västerås during the spring semester of 2015 and describes the development of a <b>quick</b> <b>coupler</b> with associated blade changing tool. These are meant to be used together with a sawing tool that the company uses for the dismantling of nuclear reactors, which is performed under water. The aim of the thesis was to develop a complete manufacturing documentation with drawings and related CAD models which Westinghouse later can use to manufacture the tool and the <b>quick</b> <b>coupler.</b> It was also included in the assignment to, if necessary, modify parts of the saw tool to adapt these to the intended blade changing tool. A number of visits to the company's workshop was made during the time to study the saw that the thesis {{is based upon}}. The purpose of these visits was to get a better idea of the dimensions, construction and the field of use of the saw. On three of those occasions various engineers and consultants accompanied us to discuss possible problems with different ideas. This was interspersed with information in the form of literature studies on <b>quick</b> <b>couplers</b> to create a clearer picture {{of the nature of the}} task. When enough information had been gathered a functional analysis was made to divide the main problem into sub this phase the idea and concept generating process took place. The methods used for this was mainly brain writing and brainstorming. When enough ideas and concepts had been generated the most promising ideas was selected by using an evaluation matrix, in which the various suggestions were weighted against the parameters that our supervisor thought mattered the most. The next step was to create a computer model of the best concept and finding suitable components in worm gear, electric motor, planetary gears, screws, etc. During the modeling phase further developed of the concept was made until the tool and <b>quick</b> <b>coupler</b> received its final shape whereupon the manufacturing documentation was created...|$|R

40|$|As a way {{to reduce}} water losses in furrow {{irrigation}} systems, used in fresh market tomato production, farmers are improperly distributing water into the field using plastic hose. The objective of this work was to study the suitability of using <b>quick</b> <b>coupler</b> sprinkler as hose connectors for water distribution in tomato plantation. The first step {{of the study was}} to assess the current hose field operation for tomato growers. Subsequently, four models of <b>quick</b> <b>couplers</b> sprinklers available in the market were tested in laboratory to determine the coefficient of resistance, the equivalent tube length, the head loss curve and the linking efficiency. As result, a structural design for hose connectors was presented using the model of coupling with the best hydraulic performance. Additionally, some technical recommendations on its use in irrigation water distribution are highlighted. Despite the requirement for additional field trials, the proposed system has potential to optimize the water use efficiency, to improve workers ergonomic conditions, and ensure good profitability to the producer...|$|R
50|$|Fatalities have {{occurred}} due to buckets being accidentally released from work equipment during operation. Released buckets have hit bystanders causing fatal injuries. These {{have been reported}} in most detail in the UK, but there are reports of fatalities in Australia, the Republic of Ireland and the USA (reference required).The causes of the fatal accidents are not always the same and the views of safety authorities in different countries differ on how to reduce risk. In the UK the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) analysed the accident data and concluded that all of the known fatalities were caused by the operator not inserting the safety pin in semi-automatic couplers. Even without the safety pin inserted the buckets would not have been released unless there had been a failure of some part of the mechanism, or some error in operation by the operator. The HSE concluded that {{the most effective way to}} reduce the risk of further accidents was for semi-automatic couplers to be withdrawn from sale. The suppliers of these couplers agreed to this voluntarily so semi-automatic couplers were withdrawn from sale in the UK by around October 2008.Safety authorities in other countries have taken a different approach. In Australia the authorities took the view that the problems were caused by designs of <b>quick</b> <b>couplers</b> that did not incorporate a safety pin. That is, they believe that semi-automatics are fundamentally safe. The Australian standard for <b>quick</b> <b>couplers</b> published by Standards Australia, AS 4774 - 2008 therefore does not exclude this design option. It is therefore obvious that the views of the safety authorities of the UK and Australia on what constitutes a safe design are very divergent.In the UK some major construction contractors have written their own specifications for <b>quick</b> <b>couplers</b> allowed on sites under their control. That is, they have pursued site safety via a procurement policy. An alternative approach has been put forward by the Strategic Forum Plant Safety Group. A working party under this group has drawn up a best practice guide that has been endorsed, inter alia, by the HSE. This provides an alternative route to site safety: adhering to best practice in the use of <b>quick</b> <b>couplers.</b>|$|R

5000|$|A European {{standard}} {{in place since}} 1996 gives some guidance on the safety of <b>quick</b> <b>couplers</b> (EN474-1). However, this standard is unclear in many aspects leading to uncertainty as to whether semi-automatic couplers comply with it or not. Because of this the UK government launched a [...] "safeguard action" [...] under the Machinery Safety Directive (98/37/EC) challenging {{the validity of the}} standard and demanding that it be improved. The European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) have therefore undertaken to revise the relevant section of the standard.Because of the divergence in design concepts and in opinions on how to manage the associated risks the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has undertaken to draft an International Standard on the safety of <b>quick</b> <b>couplers.</b> This project is being undertaken by Technical Committee 127 (ISO TC/127). A Working Group was set up to draft the standard, which will be reviewed internationally through normal ISO procedures and will be published as ISO 13031. This work will probably be completed in 2013. The intention in Europe is that, subject to the standard being suitable, the ISO standard would then be adopted as the standard for Europe.|$|R
5000|$|A {{tiltrotator}} (known under {{a number}} of trade names) is an hydraulic attachment/tool used on most excavators, and backhoes between 3-30 tons in the Nordic countries (Sweden, Finland, and Norway). A tiltrotator is mounted on the excavator such that the excavator bucket can be rotated through 360 degrees and one tilts +/- 45 degrees, {{in order to increase}} the flexibility and precision of the excavator. A tiltrotator can best be described as a wrist between the arm of the excavator and bucket, (or whatever other tool is fitted to the tiltrotator's <b>quick</b> <b>coupler).</b> With its integral <b>quick</b> <b>coupler</b> and rotary swivel, the tiltrotator can also use extra hydraulic functions to power and manipulate other worktools below it such as a breaker, grapple or an auger, which can be attached to the quickcoupler on the tiltrotator, for simplified attachment mounting, dramatically increasing the excavator's utilization on the jobsite. control systems which allows the operator to operate the machine fully through the joysticks. Recognized control systems are SVAB, ICS by Indexator, Engcon Microprop DC2 and Steelwrist XControl G2. The tiltrotator is nowadays controlled through machines two or four electro-proportionally controlled hydraulic lines.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} the fatigue life of two components in different <b>hydraulic</b> <b>quick</b> couplings. The crack which initiates the fatigue failure usually occurs {{in the bottom of}} one of the threads. Thus, the threads in the coupling are carefully investigated. A few different approaches for determining the fatigue life are studied for each component. CAD (Computer Aided Design) models for both components are created and analyzed with FEM (Finite Element Method). By analyzing these components with FEM the stresses and the strains are calculated. These values for stress and strain are used to determine the fatigue life for the different components. The first component is suffering from high cycle fatigue. Four different approaches for high cycle fatigue are investigated. These four are Wöhler-curve, Haigh-diagram, von Mises fatigue criterion and Mises-Sines fatigue criterion. It was found that all of them but the von Mises fatigue criterion give a good approximation of the fatigue life. von Mises fatigue criterion does not consider the midstress, which can be a reason for this. The three other approaches indicate that the component will be suffering from fatigue, but will be relatively close to infinite life. The Wöhler-curve indicates that the component will withstand about 470 000 loading cycles. Compared to the experimental tests where the component withstands about 700 000 loading cycles, {{it can be said that}} the approach is a good estimation of the fatigue life. Approximated material data are used. For further work it is essential to obtain experimental material data for better approximation of the fatigue life. The second component is suffering from low cycle fatigue, which means that different approaches are needed. The approaches are originally from Coffin-Manson and Morrow. A total of four low cycle fatigue criterion have been studied. The first one is made by CoffinManson and takes the plastic strain in to account, the second is made by Morrow and takes both the elastic and the plastic strain in to account.  The third is a modification of Morrow’s criterion, and will consider the midstresses as well. The fourth is a simplification of Morrow’s criterion where more common material parameters are used. These four have been compared and it can be seen that the CoffinManson criterion gives the best approximation of the reality. The Coffin-Manson criterion gives an approximation of 50 000 loading cycles to fatigue failure which, compared to that the experimental tests suffered from fatigue failure after about 40 000 loading cycles, is a good estimation of the fatigue life...|$|R

On Sunday morning however Vettel's car developed a hydraulic problem {{which had to be}} rectified quickly before the race began. As the race began it was apparent that Ferrari had the quickest car on circuit however Vettel's pace started dropping after the initial stint. This was due to a steering wheel issues which occurred before the race began (media suspecting it was due to the <b>quick</b> <b>hydraulic</b> fix Ferrari did) which meant that Vettel was holding up Räikkönen but was allowing the Mercedes to close in on the Ferraris. Despite this however Vettel won the race from Räikkönen and was 12.462 seconds ahead of Bottas in 3rd place. As a result of this, Ferrari are 2nd in the Constructors' Championship, 39 points behind Mercedes, but Vettel is leading the Drivers' Championship by 14 points ahead of Hamilton going into the summer break with Bottas 33 points behind in 3rd and Räikkönen in 5th place 86 points behind Vettel.|$|R
40|$|Multibarrier {{systems are}} {{commonly}} proposed for effective isolation of highly radioactive waste (HLW). Presently considered concepts take the host rock {{as a barrier}} claiming it to retard migration of possibly released radionuclides from HLW containers to the biosphere. This capacity is small unless water-bearing fracture zones intersecting the blasted waste-containing tunnels and excavation-disturbance zones around them can be sealed by grouting and construction of bulkheads, but this is effective only for a very limited period of time as explained in the paper. The disturbed zones thence make the entire repository serve as a continuous <b>hydraulic</b> conductor causing <b>quick</b> transport of released radionuclides up to the biosphere. The dilemma can be solved by accepting the short-circuiting function of the disturbed zones along the tunnels {{on the condition that}} totally tight waste containers be used. Deep holes bored in the site selection phase through the forthcoming repository can be effective pathways for radionuclides unless they are properly sealed. They are small-scale equivalents of tunnels but do not have any ex-cavation damage and can be effectively sealed by using clay and concrete of new types. Applying this principle to very deep boreholes with a diameter of a few decimeters would make it possible to safely store slim, tight HLW canisters for any period of time.
