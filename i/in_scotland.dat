5|$|In August 2012, the Scottish {{population}} {{reached an}} all-time high of 5.25 million people.

5|$|Landscape {{painting}} <b>in</b> <b>Scotland</b> {{includes all}} forms of painting of landscapes <b>in</b> <b>Scotland</b> since its origins {{in the sixteenth century}} to the present day.

5|$|Scottish art in {{the nineteenth}} century is the body of visual art made <b>in</b> <b>Scotland,</b> by Scots, or about {{scottish}} subjects. This period saw the increasing professionalisation and organisation of art <b>in</b> <b>Scotland.</b> Major institutions founded in this period included the Institution for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts <b>in</b> <b>Scotland,</b> the Royal Scottish Academy of Art, the National Gallery of Scotland, the Scottish National Portrait Gallery and the Glasgow Institute. Art education in Edinburgh focused on the Trustees Drawing Academy of Edinburgh. Glasgow School of Art was founded in 1845 and Grays School of Art in Aberdeen in 1885.|$|E

5|$|Sculpture was pioneered <b>in</b> <b>Scotland</b> by Lawrence Macdonald and George Combe. John Steell was {{the first}} {{significant}} Scottish sculptor to pursue their career <b>in</b> <b>Scotland,</b> gaining attention for his Alexander and Bucephasus and his design for a statue of Sir Walter Scott incorporated into the author's memorial in Edinburgh. The tradition of Scottish sculpture was boosted by the statues made for the Wallace Monument and by the centenary of Robert Burns' death in 1896. Photography was pioneered <b>in</b> <b>Scotland</b> by Robert Adamson and David Octavius Hill. As Hill & Adamson they formed the first photographic studio <b>in</b> <b>Scotland</b> in 1843 and produced work that is among the first and finest artistic uses of photography. It was subsequently pursued by Thomas Annan, George Washington Wilson and Clementina Hawarden.|$|E

5|$|The Scandinavian {{influence}} <b>in</b> <b>Scotland</b> {{was probably}} {{at its height}} in the mid eleventh century {{during the time of}} Thorfinn Sigurdsson, who attempted to create a single political and ecclesiastical domain stretching from Shetland to Man.

5|$|The {{developments}} {{spread to}} Anglo-Norman possessions in Ireland where this English style of castles dominated throughout the 13th century, although the deteriorating Irish {{economy of the}} 14th century brought this wave of building to an end. <b>In</b> <b>Scotland</b> Alexander II and Alexander III undertook a number of castle building projects in the modern style, although Alexander III's early death sparked conflict <b>in</b> <b>Scotland</b> and English intervention under Edward I in 1296. In the ensuing wars of Scottish Independence castle building <b>in</b> <b>Scotland</b> altered path, turning away from building larger, more conventional castles with curtain walls. The Scots instead adopted the policy of slighting, or deliberately destroying, castles captured <b>in</b> <b>Scotland</b> from the English to prevent their re-use in subsequent invasions – {{most of the new}} Scottish castles built by nobles were of the tower house design; the few larger castles built <b>in</b> <b>Scotland</b> were typically royal castles, built by the Scottish kings.|$|E
5|$|A. H. A. Hogg {{identified}} {{four types}} of hillfort: contour forts, promontory forts, cliff forts and ridge forts. Contour forts, where banks and ditches are moulded {{to the shape of}} the hill, are the dominant form <b>in</b> <b>Scotland.</b> Less significant are promontory forts, usually employing coastal features, such as the largest one <b>in</b> <b>Scotland</b> at the Mull of Galloway. Different types of defensive style occurred throughout the Iron Age period, some of which may have been a response to Roman siege warfare. There were different combinations in the use of earth, stone or timber. Timber was frequently in-filled with stone or other materials. In continental Europe the timber is often arranged vertically, but <b>in</b> <b>Scotland</b> horizontal timbers were more common. The function of hillforts has been much debated. It was traditionally assumed that they were primarily defensive in nature, but {{in the late twentieth century}} this view began to be questioned and social, ritual and religious functions were emphasised.|$|E
