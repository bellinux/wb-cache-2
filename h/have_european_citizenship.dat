40|$|<b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> {{establishes}} a precedent whereby the exercise {{and protection of}} rights - the practice of citizenship - is no longer contingent on residency within the jurisdiction of national citizenship.

At the same time, however, <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> <b>has</b> largely failed {{to account for the}} past or future migration of third-country nationals (TCNs) - those who are not citizens of any Member State - into or within the European Union.

40|$|<b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> {{is a new}} concept, {{which has}} evolved {{with the process of}} European integration. Starting from the younger generations, the EU seeks to {{establish}} a modern and innovative view of citizenship through three fundamental elements - rights, identity and participation - that could lead to new ways of conceiving the relationship of institutions-citizens and citizenscitizens. The idea of <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> tends to overcome the historical idea of national states and national identity. It does this by reinforcing its supranational nature and developing an attitude of tolerance towards diversity and human/minority rights. Thus, to verify the impact <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> <b>has</b> on the younger generation in Bulgaria, this research is based on an inter-ethnic sample of 30 interviews (16 Bulgarians, 14 Bulgarian Turks) and applies a qualitative comparative analysis method. This research seeks to answer these two main questions: 1) How do young Bulgarians perceive the concept of EU citizenship? 2) How do young Bulgarians perceive the new <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> in regard to the inter-ethnic relations in their own country? The study suggests that the EU’s attempt to promote <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> is underachieving. On the one hand, young Bulgarian people tend to be well exposed to <b>European</b> <b>citizenship,</b> irrespective of their ethnic belonging. On the other hand, the majority of them are sceptical of the tangible value of <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> for the reinforcement of a more encompassing and shared notion of diversity and minority rights...|$|R
40|$|Interlinking vital {{aspects of}} the legal, economic, {{political}} and social competencies of its participating member states the European Union as it is presently constituted represents a unique experiment {{in the development of}} a new type of supranational political system. Driven by the accelerating processes of globalisation and actioned through a variety of formal and informal mechanisms European integration is slowly shifting the centre of political authority to a new supranational European level. The challenge for the European Union is to reconcile these developments and create an institutional framework that provides democratic legitimacy promotes equality, social inclusion and social justice and creates a political system that can recognise and accommodate the differences inherent in an increasingly multi-cultural society. Recognising the close inter-relationship between the effects of integration and the exercise of meaningful political participation, the <b>European</b> Commission <b>has</b> explicitly identified <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> as the mechanism to legitimise continued integration. The purpose of this research is to analyse the implications of this decision and to explore whether over time <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> <b>has</b> the potential to create and foster a distinct European identity which can promote a genuine and meaningful form of participatory post-national citizenship based outside the nation state. Drawing together both integration and citizenship theory into a new synthesis, the research is seeking to develop a new syncretic model of integration that can satisfactorily explain both the complexity and sophistication of the European Union and explain the forces which are currently driving forward the momentum of integration towards an "ever closer" political Union.

40|$|Recent {{enlargement}} of the <b>European</b> Union (EU) <b>has</b> created debate as to the suitability of current structures and policies for effectively engaging citizens and developing social cohesion. Education and specifically modern foreign language (MFL) teaching are argued by the literature to {{play a key role}} in equipping young people to interact and communicate effectively in the ever-changing European context and to exercise their rights as European citizens. However, much of the empirical research to date has focused on adult understandings of <b>European</b> <b>citizenship.</b> Furthermore, very few studies consider whether current MFL teaching is addressing issues of <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> or offer a comparison of provision between one member state and another. This study presents questionnaire data from four European countries to investigate young people's current understanding and awareness of <b>European</b> <b>citizenship</b> and the perceived contribution of their language learning experience to this awareness.
