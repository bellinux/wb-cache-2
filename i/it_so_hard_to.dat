500|$|... "Rain" [...] is {{the tenth}} track whose lyrics talk about waiting and hoping for love. The song {{features}} a crescendo towards the end. The subsequent track, [...] "Why's It So Hard," [...] {{is considered the}} album's plea for solidarity with her audience, as Madonna sings: [...] "Why's <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> love one another?" [...] The following song, [...] "In This Life," [...] was written in memory of friends who Madonna had lost to the AIDS epidemic. The drums were compared to a doomsday clock and the keyboard intervals were also compared to George Gershwin's blues lullaby [...] "Prelude No. 2," [...] creating a sense of dis-ease. The thirteenth track, [...] "Did You Do It?" [...] features rappers Mark Goodman and Dave Murphy. The song was omitted in the clean edition of Erotica. [...] Producer Andr√© Betts claimed that for fun, he just rapped over the track [...] "Waiting," [...] while Madonna was gone, and she liked it after hearing later. The last track from the album, [...] "Secret Garden," [...] is described as Eroticas most personal song. In addition, [...] "Secret Garden" [...] {{is dedicated to the}} singer's vagina, [...] "the secret place where she could enjoy herself." [...] It features a jazz-house beat.|$|E
500|$|... "Complicated" [...] {{garnered}} {{critical acclaim}} from music critics. Colin Gentry of 4Music named the song {{the highlight of}} the album, continuing to write that Rihanna pours her heart out to the listener as she sings about the intensity of her [...] "despair". Jon Parales of The New York Times described [...] "Complicated" [...] as being one of the more [...] "emotional" [...] songs on Loud. Emily Mackay of NME noted that the lyrics [...] "Why do you make <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> love you?/I hate it" [...] were reminiscent of songs by English pop girl group, Sugababes. Steve Jones of USA Today observed that Rihanna's opinions of men are not just present on [...] "Complicated", but rather that it is a recurring theme on Loud, writing [...] "On more than one occasion, she makes it clear that she likes her men complicated and that they can expect her to be the same." [...] Jones also listed it as one of his top songs to download from the album. Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly commented that the [...] "spiraling dance-floor siren" [...] persona Rihanna adopted on the lead single from Loud, [...] "Only Girl (In the World)", was carried through onto [...] "Complicated". Greenblatt continued to praise Rihanna's vocal performance, writing: [...] "Even while telling a recalcitrant man how hard he is to love, she sounds almost buoyant, her newly expanded vocals eager to scale the song's high-altitude house beat." ...|$|E
