5000|$|<b>Isobutylidenediurea</b> (abbreviated IBDU) is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the formula (CH3)2CHCH{NHC(O)NH2}2. It is a derivative of urea (OC(NH2)2), which itself is highly soluble in water, but IBDU is not. It {{functions as a}} controlled-release fertiliser owing to its low solubility, which limits the rate of its hydrolysis to urea, which is a fast-acting fertiliser.|$|E
