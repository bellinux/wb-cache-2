5|$|In 2009, the International Union for Conservation of Nature's IUCN Red List of Endangered Species named 64 species, {{one-third of}} all oceanic shark species, as being at risk of {{extinction}} due to fishing and shark <b>finning.</b>|$|E
5|$|Shark populations began declining. Since {{they are}} predators {{near the top}} of the marine food chain, an {{umbrella}} species, playing an important role in maintaining ocean ecosystems, this could have serious adverse environmental consequences for marine fisheries. Campaigns began in many nations to prohibit or greatly curtail <b>finning</b> in both territorial and international waters and work toward international agreements on the practice. In the U.S., President Bill Clinton signed the Shark <b>Finning</b> Prohibition Act (SFPA) into law in 2000 shortly before leaving office. It amended the Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the primary statute regulating fisheries in the U.S.'s Exclusive Economic Zone up to 200 nautical miles offshore, to prohibit <b>finning</b> in U.S. territorial waters by any vessels, and the possession of fins by a U.S.-flagged vessel in international waters or the landing of any fins at a U.S. port without corresponding carcasses amounting to at least 20 times the weight of the fins. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) was charged with promulgating and implementing regulations to enforce the act.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the European Union {{introduced}} a general shark <b>finning</b> ban for all vessels of all nationalities in Union waters {{and for all}} vessels flying a flag {{of one of its}} member states. This prohibition was amended in June 2013 to close remaining loopholes.|$|E

5|$|The {{tiger shark}} is {{captured}} and killed for its fins, flesh, and liver. It is caught regularly in target and nontarget fisheries. Several populations have declined {{where they have}} been heavily fished. Continued demand for fins may result in further declines in the future. They are considered a near threatened species due to excessive <b>finning</b> and fishing by humans according to International Union for Conservation of Nature.|$|E
5|$|Kesha {{was named}} rights group Humane Society of the United States's first global {{ambassador}} for animal rights, {{for which she}} is expected to bring attention to such practices as cosmetics testing on animals and shark <b>finning.</b> Kesha received the Wyler Award presented by The Humane Society as a celebrity or public figure who increases awareness of animal issues via the media. She received the award March 23, 2013, at The 2013 Genesis Awards Benefit Gala. She also appeared alongside rock singer Iggy Pop in a campaign for PETA, protesting the clubbing of baby seals in Canada and later wrote {{on behalf of the}} organization to fast food chain McDonald's over the conditions of their slaughterhouses.|$|E
5|$|Sharks {{are often}} killed for shark fin soup. Fishermen capture live sharks, fin them, and dump the finless animal {{back into the}} water. Shark <b>finning</b> {{involves}} removing the fin with a hot metal blade. The resulting immobile shark soon dies from suffocation or predators. Shark fin {{has become a major}} trade within black markets all over the world. Fins sell for about $300/lb in 2009. Poachers illegally fin millions each year. Few governments enforce laws that protect them. In 2010 Hawaii became the first U.S. state to prohibit the possession, sale, trade or distribution of shark fins. From 1996 to 2000, an estimated 38 million sharks had been killed per year for harvesting shark fins.|$|E

40|$|H-type <b>finned</b> tube heat {{exchanger}} elements maintain a high capacity for heat transfer, possess superior self-cleaning properties and retain the ability to effect flue gas waste heat recovery in boiler renovations. In this paper, the heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics of H-type <b>finned</b> tube banks are studied via an experimental open high-temperature wind tunnel system. The effects of <b>fin</b> width, <b>fin</b> height, <b>fin</b> pitch and air velocity on <b>fin</b> efficiency, convective heat transfer coefficient, integrated heat transfer capacity and pressure drop are examined. The results indicate that as air velocity, <b>fin</b> height and <b>fin</b> width increase, <b>fin</b> efficiency decreases. Convective heat transfer coefficient is proportional to <b>fin</b> pitch, but inversely proportional to <b>fin</b> height and <b>fin</b> width. Integrated heat transfer capacity is related to <b>fin</b> efficiency, convective heat transfer coefficient and <b>finned</b> ratio.

5|$|The United States manages common {{thresher}} fisheries via regulations such {{as commercial}} quotas and trip limits, and recreational minimum sizes and retention limits. Shark <b>finning</b> is illegal under U.S. federal law. The Atlantic common thresher fishery is {{regulated by the}} National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Highly Migratory Species Management Division through the 2006 Consolidated Atlantic Highly Migratory Species (HMS) Fishery Management Plan (FMP), and the Pacific common thresher fishery is regulated by the Pacific Fishery Management Council through the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for U.S. West Coast Fisheries for Highly Migratory Species (HMS). In the 1990s, after the depletion of common thresher stocks by the California gillnet fishery, the fleet was limited to 70 boats and restrictions were placed on season, operation range, and landings. There {{is evidence that the}} California subpopulation is recovering, and the potential population growth rate has been estimated to be 47% per year.|$|E
5|$|The {{porbeagle}} {{is listed}} on Annex 1 (Highly Migratory Species) of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and on Annex 1 of the Conservation of Migratory Species (CMS; {{also known as}} the Bonn Convention) Migratory Shark Memorandum of Understanding. This species benefits from bans on shark <b>finning</b> instituted by several nations and supranational entities, including Canada, the United States, Brazil, Australia, the European Union, and the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). Although the Animals Committee of the UN Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) recommended additional conservation actions for the porbeagle, CITES rejected proposals to list the species in 2008 and again in 2010. In March 2013, the porbeagle was listed on Appendix II of CITES, allowing for increased regulation in the international trade of this species.|$|E

The tri-fin refers to a setup with three <b>fins</b> {{on the underside of the}} board, often with the two outer <b>fins</b> angled inward and middle <b>fin</b> a few inches closer to the end of the tail pointed straight and larger. The five <b>fin</b> placement is similar but with four outer <b>fins</b> and one middle <b>fin</b> (these <b>fins</b> are often smaller).

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we provide {{information}} {{on the development of}} the structure and composition of <b>fins</b> in the medaka. The pectoral <b>fins,</b> which begin to form in the embryonic stage, first form their <b>fin</b> rays after hatching prior to the formation of other median and pelvic <b>fins.</b> During the growth period from larvae to juveniles, the unpaired anal, caudal and dorsal <b>fins</b> begin to form before the pronounced degeneration or resorption of the median <b>fin</b> fold in the region of the caudal peduncle. The <b>fin</b> rays first appear in the caudal <b>fin</b> fold at the posterior end of the body, and subsequently <b>fin</b> rays of the anal and pectoral <b>fins</b> arise prior to those of the dorsal <b>fin.</b> Paired pelvic <b>fins</b> begin to sprout on the skin of the bilateral sides of a median ventral <b>fin</b> fold, which regresses concomitant with resorption of the <b>fin</b> fold at the dorsal and ventral regions of the caudal peduncle. After complete resorption of those portions of the ventral <b>fin</b> fold in which <b>fin</b> rays do not arise, the pelvic <b>fin</b> rays form. The pectoral <b>fins</b> are supported by four small radials, the scapulas and the coracoids. Similarly, the pelvic <b>fins</b> are supported by pelvic girdles, the caudal <b>fin</b> by the hypural, and the anal and dorsal <b>fins</b> by distal and proximal pterygiophores. The appearance of these <b>fin</b> appendages closely follows that of <b>fin</b> rays in the <b>fin</b> fold...|$|R
50|$|Removable <b>Fin</b> Systems The {{most common}} types of <b>fins</b> used today, {{removable}} <b>fins</b> are surfboard <b>fins</b> {{that can be}} unscrewed from the surfboard and be replaced by different <b>fins</b> or be moved about the board for a different setup in maneuverability and stability. In the early 90’s three Australian surfers invented the <b>fin</b> control system (FCS). Since its global release in 1994 FCS has become the industry standard; providing elite athletes and everyday surfers an abundance of <b>fin</b> designs and a platform to change {{the performance of their}} surfboard by changing <b>fins.</b> The system also streamlined the surfboard manufacturing process by making it easier to install <b>fins</b> into boards and repair damaged <b>fins.</b> The leading competitor to FCS <b>fins</b> is Futures <b>fins.</b> Using a single larger <b>fin</b> box, the manufacture claims the <b>fins</b> provide a stronger connection and more closely approximate the feeling of a glass on <b>fin.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Tetras {{generally}} have compressed (sometimes deep), [...] bodies and are typically identifiable by their <b>fins.</b> They ordinarily possess a homocercal caudal <b>fin</b> (a twin-lobed, or forked, tail <b>fin</b> whose {{upper and lower}} lobes are of equal size) and a tall dorsal <b>fin</b> characterized by a short connection to the fish’s body. Additionally, tetras possess a long anal <b>fin</b> stretching from a position just posterior of the dorsal <b>fin</b> and ending on the ventral caudal peduncle, and a small, fleshy adipose <b>fin</b> located dorsally between the dorsal and caudal <b>fins.</b> This adipose <b>fin</b> represents the fourth unpaired <b>fin</b> on the fish (the four unpaired <b>fins</b> include the caudal <b>fin,</b> dorsal <b>fin,</b> anal <b>fin,</b> and adipose <b>fin),</b> lending to the name tetra, which is Greek for four. While this adipose <b>fin</b> is generally considered the distinguishing feature, some tetras (such as the emperor tetras, Nematobrycon palmeri) lack this appendage. Ichthyologists debate {{the function of the}} adipose <b>fin,</b> doubting its role in swimming due to its small size and lack of stiffening rays or spines.|$|R
25|$|In 2013, O'Malley {{signed a}} bill to ban the {{practice}} of shark <b>finning</b> in Maryland, making it the sixth U.S. state to enact this regulation. The signature of this bill made Maryland the first East Coast state to make it illegal to possess, sell, trade or distribute shark fins.|$|E
25|$|Trim is the diver's {{attitude}} in the water, in terms of balance and alignment with the direction of motion. Accurately controlled trim reduces swimming effort, as it reduces the sectional area of the diver passing through the water. A slight head down trim is recommended to reduce downthrust during <b>finning,</b> and this reduces silting and fin impact with the bottom.|$|E
25|$|Ankle weights, {{which are}} {{typically}} about 1lb./0.5kg of shot, {{are used to}} counteract the positive buoyancy of diving suit leggings, made worse in drysuits by the migration of the internal bubble of air to the feet, and positively buoyant fins. Some divers prefer negatively buoyant fins. The additional effort needed when <b>finning</b> with ankle weights or heavy fins increases the diver's gas consumption.|$|E
5|$|The <b>fins</b> are {{strongly}} falcate (sickle-shaped), particularly the dorsal <b>fins,</b> pelvic <b>fins,</b> and lower caudal <b>fin</b> lobe. The pectoral <b>fins</b> are narrow and pointed. The first dorsal <b>fin</b> is positioned about {{halfway between the}} pectoral and pelvic <b>fins.</b> The second dorsal <b>fin</b> is about two-thirds as tall as the first and is positioned slightly ahead of the anal <b>fin.</b> The anal <b>fin</b> is smaller than the second dorsal <b>fin.</b> The dorsal surface of the caudal peduncle bears a crescent-shaped notch at the caudal <b>fin</b> origin. The asymmetrical caudal <b>fin</b> has a well-developed lower lobe and a long upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip. The dermal denticles are small and overlapping; each has five horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. This species is light grey or bronze above, often with small white spots on the sides, and pale below. The dorsal <b>fins</b> are tipped in white, which is especially obvious on the second dorsal as the remainder of <b>fin</b> is mostly dark.|$|R
50|$|The common smooth-hound has two dorsal <b>fins,</b> an anal <b>fin,</b> {{a pair of}} {{pectoral}} <b>fins,</b> a pair of pelvic <b>fins</b> and a heterocercal tail. All {{of these}} <b>fins</b> help stabilise the shark but in males, the pelvic <b>fins</b> are modified to form claspers.|$|R
50|$|The {{little gulper}} shark has no anal <b>fin,</b> two dorsal <b>fins</b> with spines, {{slightly}} humped back before the first dorsal <b>fin,</b> darker areas of coloration above gills and on dorsal <b>fins,</b> long free rear tips on pectoral <b>fins,</b> and a notched caudal <b>fin.</b>|$|R
25|$|Flutter {{kick and}} {{modified}} flutter kick: Flutter kick is the <b>finning</b> style most frequently used. In its basic form it resembles the flutter kick of surface swimmers, but slower {{and with a}} larger stroke to make effective use of the large surface area of the fins. The modified flutter kick is done entirely with bent knees, pushing water up and behind the diver to avoid stirring up sediment on the bottom.|$|E
25|$|Most {{commercial}} diving {{dry suits}} have heavy duty integral boots. Sport diving suits may have lightweight integral boots or soft neoprene booties. Rock boots or heavy working boots {{may also be}} worn over integral neoprene or latex socks. Boots which are stiff at the ankle make <b>finning</b> inefficient and are unsuitable for many diving applications where mobility is important. If the suit will be used by a diver who needs to fin efficiently on some dives and to walk on sharp surfaces on other dives, it is more effective to wear boots suited to the dive over a dry suit with integral socks.|$|E
25|$|Some {{dry suits}} are {{provided}} with internally attached suspenders which when hooked over the shoulders, will hold the trouser section up when the top part of the suit {{has not yet been}} fully dressed into by the diver, this is also convenient if the suit is partly removed between dives for comfort. The suspenders also help to keep the trousers fully lifted if the torso of a membrane suit is a little long to provide enough space for the diver to bend the torso comfortably when in use. If the crotch hangs too low it encumbers the legs when <b>finning,</b> and increases the risk of the feet pulling out of the boots in an inversion.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} <b>fins</b> {{are short}} and angular, while the pelvic <b>fins</b> {{are long and}} relatively large. The dorsal <b>fins</b> are small, with the first dorsal <b>fin</b> origin lying behind the pelvic <b>fin</b> origins. There is no anal <b>fin.</b> The caudal peduncle is robust and lacks notches at the caudal <b>fin</b> origins. The asymmetrical caudal <b>fin</b> has an indistinct lower lobe and an upper lobe without a notch in the trailing margin.|$|R
