5|$|In Judaism, the Western Wall is venerated as {{the sole}} remnant of the Holy Temple. It has become a place of pilgrimage for Jews, {{as it is the}} closest {{permitted}} accessible site to the holiest spot in Judaism, namely the Even ha-shetiya or Foundation Stone, which lies on the Temple Mount. According to one rabbinic opinion, Jews may not set foot upon the Temple Mount and doing so is a sin punishable by Kareth. While almost all historians and archaeologists and some rabbinical authorities believe that the rocky outcrop in the Dome of the Rock is the Foundation Stone, some rabbis say it is located directly opposite the <b>exposed</b> <b>section</b> of the Western Wall, near the El-kas fountain. This spot was the site of the Holy of Holies when the Temple stood.|$|E
25|$|Endeavour {{carried a}} wide variety of {{equipment}} and cargo in the payload bay, with the largest item being the Kibo Japanese Experiment Module Exposed Facility (JEM EF), and the Kibo Japanese Experiment Logistics Module – <b>Exposed</b> <b>Section</b> (ELM-ES). The exposed facility is a part of Kibo that will allow astronauts to perform science experiments that are exposed to the vacuum of space. The <b>exposed</b> <b>section</b> is similar to the logistics module on the Kibo laboratory, but is not pressurized. Once its payloads were transferred to the JEM EF, the ELM-ES was returned to the payload bay.|$|E
25|$|Other {{traditional}} sources disagreed; {{operating under}} {{the belief that the}} Southern Wall of the Temple Mount as it stood in their time was the Southern Wall of the Biblical era, they argued that the measurements given in the Talmud do not reconcile. The Holy of Holies ends up being too far north and they therefore locate the Foundation Stone as being directly opposite the current <b>exposed</b> <b>section</b> of the Western Wall, where no building currently stands. This is the view of Isaac Luria and the Maharsha, who state the prophecy that “Zion will become a ploughed field” indicates that no dwelling will be established there until the time of the Redemption. It therefore follows that the footprint of the Temple courtyard and Holy of Holies is situated in the unbuilt area between the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque.|$|E

5000|$|The {{final section}} of the route to the summit starts at Col des Becs de Bosson (2942 m). This part is a short rock {{scramble}} and with several <b>exposed</b> <b>sections,</b> not for beginners.|$|R
50|$|An archaeological {{investigation}} in 2002 <b>exposed</b> <b>sections</b> of unmoved cultural deposits at +2.4 - 1.9 metres asl (square pavement slightly below +3) of layers of sand containing fragments of red pottery, faïence, and Chinese porcelain, probably {{dating from the}} 18th century.|$|R
500|$|A {{change in}} attitudes, and {{awareness}} of the historical significance of the structure, led to a gradual shift from destruction to preservation {{in the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth centuries. English Heritage state that limited repair work or alterations on the structure were likely carried out in the nineteenth century, but exact details are unclear. In 1913 the Wheeldale structure was brought under legal protection from robbing and deliberate damage, when its conservation was guaranteed under the Ancient Monuments Consolidation and Amendment Act. In 1982 a proposal was made to re-cover the majority of the <b>exposed</b> <b>section</b> with topsoil in order to protect it from further damage, but this has not been carried out [...] There was some further, limited maintenance of some sections between 1995 and 1997 to control water erosion, in addition to major erosion repair at the southern end of the structure in 1997.|$|E
500|$|The Western Wall {{commonly}} {{refers to}} a [...] <b>exposed</b> <b>section</b> of ancient wall situated on the western flank of the Temple Mount. This section faces a large plaza and is set aside for prayer. In its entirety, however, the above-ground portion of the Western Wall stretches for , most of which is hidden behind residential structures built along its length. Other revealed sections include {{the southern part of}} the Wall which measures approximately [...] and another much shorter section known as the Little Western Wall which is located close to the Iron Gate. The wall functions as a retaining wall, supporting and enclosing the ample substructures built by Herod the Great around 19 BCE. Herod's project was to create an artificial extension to the small quasi-natural plateau on which the First and Second Temples stood, transforming it into the almost rectangular, wide expanse of the Temple Mount visible today.|$|E
500|$|Only {{members of}} a {{national}} UIAA club are allowed to climb the peak on their own. Other visitors {{have to take a}} certified mountain guide. The two easiest routes, usually up the Velická próba and down the Batizovská próba named after their respective valleys, are protected by chains. Because of an <b>exposed</b> <b>section</b> along the Velická próba and tricky orientation especially on the ridge, both are among the more difficult scrambling routes in the High Tatras, although it's rather climbing, since there are many moments when one must rely on ones hands to hold ones bodyweight. With no snow, guidebooks grade the routes as a II or III climb (UIAA scale) or lower. The total elevation gain is about [...] for those who spend the night at the Sliezsky Dom Hotel or are driven there by a mountain guide, and about [...] for those who hike from Tatranská Polianka. In winter, Gerlachovský štít offers a challenging alpine climb, with mixed climbing and a risk of avalanches.|$|E
50|$|A rock path runs up the steep, {{northern}} sloopes of the Silberberg {{that was}} originally blazed by the Black Forest Club but, like the Alpine Path on the Feldberg has been abandoned. The very varied footpath {{has a few}} <b>exposed</b> <b>sections</b> but is still passible.|$|R
50|$|The first {{recorded}} ascent of Mount Cleveland was in 1920 by Frank B. Wynn. The easiest route on the peak is the West Face route, {{starting from the}} Waterton Valley; it is a scramble (Class 3) {{with the possibility of}} some short <b>exposed</b> <b>sections</b> (Class 4).|$|R
50|$|Castle Rock is a bluff {{of exposed}} St. Peter Sandstone from the Middle Ordovician period. Newly <b>exposed</b> <b>sections</b> are white quartz, while older areas have browner tints from the {{formation}} of limonite. The bluff is along the axis of the Sandwich Fault Zone, separating Ordovician exposures {{from those of the}} Cambrian period.|$|R
500|$|At the Western Wall Plaza, {{the total}} {{height of the}} Wall from its {{foundation}} is estimated at , with the <b>exposed</b> <b>section</b> standing approximately [...] high. The Wall consists of 45 stone courses, 28 of them above ground and 17 underground. The first seven visible layers are from the Herodian period. This section of wall is built from enormous meleke limestone blocks, possibly quarried at either Zedekiah's Cave situated under the Muslim Quarter of the Old City or at Ramat Shlomo [...] northwest of the Old City. Most of them weigh between [...] each, but others weigh even more, with one extraordinary stone located slightly north of Wilson's Arch measuring [...] and weighing approximately 517 tonnes (570 short tons). Each of these ashlars is framed by fine-chiseled borders. The margins themselves measure between [...] wide, with their depth measuring [...] In the Herodian period, the upper [...] of wall were [...] thick and served as the outer wall of the double colonnade of the Temple platform. This upper section was decorated with pilasters, the remainder of which were destroyed when the Byzantines reconquered Jerusalem from the Persians in 628.|$|E

2500|$|STS-127 (ISS {{assembly}} flight 2J/A) was a NASA Space Shuttle {{mission to}} the International Space Station (ISS). It was the twenty-third flight of [...] The {{primary purpose of the}} STS-127 mission was to deliver and install the final two components of the Japanese Experiment Module: the Exposed Facility (JEM EF), and the <b>Exposed</b> <b>Section</b> of the Experiment Logistics Module (ELM-ES). When Endeavour docked with the ISS on this mission in July 2009, it set a record for the most humans in space {{at the same time in}} the same vehicle, the first time thirteen people have been at the station at the same time. It also tied the record of thirteen people in space at any one time.|$|E
2500|$|South Face or [...] "Polish Line" [...] or [...] "Central Rib": Extremely exposed, most {{demanding}} and most dangerous. In July 1986, Jerzy Kukuczka and Tadeusz Piotrowski summitted on this route. Piotrowski was killed while descending. The route starts {{off the first}} part of the Southwest Pillar, and then deviates into a totally exposed, snow-covered cliff area, then through a gully known as [...] "The Hockey Stick", and then goes up to yet another exposed cliff-face, and the route continues through yet another extremely <b>exposed</b> <b>section</b> all the way up to the point where the route joins with the Abruzzi Spur about 1,000 feet before the summit. Reinhold Messner called it a suicidal route and so far, no one has repeated Kukuczka and Piotrowski's achievement. [...] "The route is so avalanche-prone, that no one else has ever considered a new attempt." ...|$|E
2500|$|Does the SHZ extend north? Though the Olympia Structure (a {{suspected}} fault) runs {{towards the}} SHZ, and delineates {{the northern edge}} of an <b>exposed</b> <b>section</b> of the Crescent Formation, it appears to be an upper crustal fold, part of a pattern of folding that extends southeast to cross the Columbia River near The Dalles, and unrelated to the mid and lower crustal SHZ. It has been speculated that the SHZ might extend under the Kitsap Peninsula (central Puget Sound), possibly involved with a section of the subducting Juan de Fuca plate that is suspected of being stuck. [...] The implications of this are not only [...] "the possibility of a moderate to large crustal earthquake along the SHZ", [...] but that the tectonics under Puget Sound are more complicated than yet understood, and may involve differences in the regional stress patterns not reflected in current earthquake hazard assessments.|$|E

2500|$|At 16:08, {{shortly after}} {{resuming}} the advance, 11 Platoon's left flank was engaged by machine-gun fire from an undetected Viet Cong force, killing and wounding several men from 6 Section. They went to ground and adopted firing positions, {{only to be}} engaged by a second machine-gun firing tracer. The firing lasted two to three minutes then stopped, and Sharp then ordered 5 Section to sweep {{across the front of}} the platoon from the right. Yet just as they began to move, they came under heavy small-arms and rocket-propelled grenade fire from their front and both flanks. Pinned down by the weight of fire, and under threat of being overrun, the isolated platoon was forced to fight for their lives. Over the next 10 to 15 minutes the Viet Cong engaged 11 Platoon with heavy fire, putting their left flank out of action. At that moment a heavy monsoon rain began which reduced visibility to just [...] and turned the ground to mud. Assessing the Viet Cong to be in greater strength than previously thought and believing they were preparing to assault his position, Sharp called for artillery fire as he moved to bring his <b>exposed</b> <b>section</b> back into line and then gradually draw his platoon into all-round defence. He subsequently reported being under fire from a force estimated to be platoon-sized. The Australians had started the contact thinking they were numerically superior and would attack the Viet Cong, yet far from clashing with a small force which would try to withdraw before being decisively engaged, 11 Platoon had run into the forward troops of a main force regiment. Beginning as an encounter battle, heavy fighting ensued as the advancing battalions of the 275th Regiment and D445 Battalion clashed with D Company, 6 RAR and attempted to encircle and destroy them.|$|E
