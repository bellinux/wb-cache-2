40|$|Our planar SOFC {{stacking}} technology uses unprofiled metallic interconnects (MIC) {{and thin}} cells of tape cast anode supported YSZ. The key element is the gas diffusion layer (GDL) between cell and MIC, {{which consists of}} so-called SOFConnex™. Using square cells with internal manifolds, 0. 5 W/cm 2 stack power density (800 °C) can be obtained on short stacks. However, this open design configuration limits the assembly of large stacks and the <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation,</b> owing to postcombustion and redox cycling occurring at unprotected cell edges. A new design, inspired from modeling work and the adaptability of the SOFConnex™ GDL, led to oblong-shaped cells, assembled in a closed stack casing with external air manifolding and fuel recovery manifolding, avoiding postcombustion. While stack power density in both designs remains similar, the operation at increased fuel utilization has become more stable in the 2 nd design. Furthermore, a correlation of performance homogeneity during stack testing was drawn to assembly quality control. A 36 -cell stack in dilute H 2 at 800 °C achieved 625 Wel (28 % LHV efficiency, 0. 35 W/cm 2) under continuous polarisation, with all 6 clusters of 6 cells showing coincident i-V-output...|$|R

Those criteria have been divided into tribological, technical in detail and technical in general. The above criteria have been related to piston-con-rod system, in which, two tribological centres were specified. One centre included, piston-piston rings and cylinder, in which, piston rings serve as labyrinth seal and the cylinder constitutes piston guides. Crank bearings and main bearings of engine crankshaft constitute the second centre. From the point of tribological view, piston-piston rings and cylinder constitute slide and thrust bearing lubricated hydrodynamically, while crankshaft bearings a-c-t as slide and journal bearings also lubricated hydrodynamically. In the description of thermal load of the above-mentioned tribological centres, special {{attention was paid to}} criteria that ensure their motion reliability and <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> engine <b>operation.</b> Whereas in the description of mechanical load of elements constituting investigated centres, some criteria were determined resulting from their functionality and fatigue strength of the material they were made of.

It has been emphasized that synthetic criteria indicators are the most precise. They are determined on the basis of engine load measurements during its operation. Those criteria allow us to describe the operating process of con-rod-piston diesel engines {{and at the same time}} it is possible to expose their technical condition which is of essential practical meaning.

The peel strength of fused composites determines the <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> the pressing <b>operation</b> and they are influenced from the process conditions, the characteristics of fusible interlining and the fabric to whom they are sticked to. In this study, it was aimed to analyze the effect of fusible type and process conditions, weave type and different elastane compositions on peel strength. To this aim, two fusible types combined with eight different types of wool fabrics having different amount of elastane were studied. It was found out that only the fusible type and the process conditions are confirmed statistically that they influence the peel strength values. Nonetheless, it was observed as the elastane composition increased, the peel strength values tend to increase for twill type of fabrics and tend to decrease for plain type of fabrics. Moreover, the influence of composition may be in different direction when different type of Fusibles is used to form fusible composites. In conclusion, it can be stated that the dominant mechanism in determination of the peel strength is the selection of fusible type and suitable process conditions for this fusible type and more investigations are necessary if {{the composition of the}} material is also influential on the peel strength because of its compatibility with the fusible interlining. ...|$|R
