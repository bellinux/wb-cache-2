5|$|Elections {{were not}} held {{on a regular}} schedule; they {{occurred}} usually every <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> years, upon Emperor's decree. Thus the deputies' term of office lasted about six years. The Diet had ten elections: 1861, 1867, 1870, 1877, 1883, 1889, 1889, 1895, 1901, 1908, and the final one, in 1913.|$|E

5|$|Most {{species have}} 12 ovules and 36 seeds, {{although}} some {{species such as}} N. bulbocodium have more, up {{to a maximum of}} 60. Seeds take <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> weeks to mature. The seeds of sections Jonquilla and Bulbocodium are wedge-shaped and matte black, while those of other sections are ovate and glossy black. A gust of wind or contact with a passing animal is sufficient to disperse the mature seeds.|$|E
5|$|Nauru is a {{republic}} with a parliamentary system of government. The president is both {{head of state}} and head of government. A 19-member unicameral parliament is elected every three years.

5|$|The Milky Way {{galaxy and}} the nearby Andromeda Galaxy are moving toward each other at about 130km/s, and—depending upon the lateral movements—the two might collide in about <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> billion years. Although the Milky Way has never {{collided}} with a galaxy as large as Andromeda before, evidence of past collisions of the Milky Way with smaller dwarf galaxies is increasing.|$|E
5|$|After <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> instars, the nymphs will molt into adults. The male's forceps {{will become}} curved, while the females' forceps remain straight. They will also develop their natural color, {{which can be}} {{anything}} from a light brown (as in the Tawny earwig) to a dark black (as in the Ringlegged earwig). In species of winged earwigs, the wings will start to develop at this time. The forewings of an earwig are sclerotized to serve as protection for the membranous hindwings.|$|E
5|$|Compared to the {{previous}} season's Claxton Shield tournament, there were few structural changes to the competition. With the expansion from <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> teams, the need for teams to have a bye was eliminated, with all teams participating in games each round. The individual rounds were expanded from three to four games per round, resulting in an increase from 24 to 40 games per team for the season. The postseason was also expanded to include the top four teams, rather than only the top three.|$|E
5000|$|In 1912, {{the value}} of a {{touchdown}} was increased <b>to</b> <b>six</b> points. The end zone was also added. Before the addition of the end zone, forward passes caught beyond the goal line resulted in a loss of possession and a touchback. (The increase from <b>five</b> points <b>to</b> <b>six</b> did not come until much later in Canada, and the touchdown remained only five points there until 1956.) ...|$|R

5|$|Despite {{academic}} ineptitude, Taylor {{became a}} successful businessman after his football career. He was {{commissioner of the}} United States Rugby League in 1978 and attempted to start a 12-team competition. He also maintained his physical condition well after his playing days; he participated in the Superstars competition in 1977 and finished fourth in 1979. In 2000, aged 65, he was jogging <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> miles daily to stay in shape. Taylor was diagnosed with hepatitis C in 1989, but it {{was found to be}} dormant by 2000. As of 2016, Taylor lives in Baton Rouge with his wife, Helen.|$|E
5|$|Feeding {{is usually}} {{in small groups}} and the bird takes mainly insects. Breeding usually starts in March, with the birds {{building}} their nest high in an acacia tree. The birds usually lay <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> cream eggs with lilac blotches. The nest itself is globular in shape with a tubular entrance on top. It is possible that {{more than just the}} breeding pair visit the nest and that the young of previous years help in rearing the young.|$|E
5|$|In December 1999 Warner Music Group, {{which owns}} Atlantic Records, stated they {{expected}} to sell at least <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> million copies of Shades of Purple. Sales had exceeded one million by September 2000, though investors were disappointed as they had not yet recuperated the amount they had spent promoting the duo; {{they expected to}} break even {{before the end of}} the year. The album sold 107,000 units in its opening week in the US, and had sold 268,000 units there by March 2002. Worldwide sales of the album exceeded 1.5 million by January 2002.|$|E

5|$|In March 2002, Meshuggah {{recorded}} three-track demos with programmed drums {{in their}} home studio, which were based on Haake's sample Drumkit from Hell. The upcoming album was recorded in <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> weeks in May and was produced by the band at Dug-Out Studios in Uppsala and at its home studio in Stockholm. The last-minute decision to join 2002's Ozzfest tour forced the band to mix the album in two days and master it in one. Meshuggah immediately went on another US tour after finishing the recording.|$|E
5|$|London {{was also}} full of black powder, {{especially}} {{along the river}} front. Much of it {{was left in the}} homes of private citizens from the days of the English Civil War, as the former members of Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army still retained their muskets and the powder with which to load them. <b>Five</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> hundred tons of powder was stored in the Tower of London. The ship chandlers along the wharves also held large stocks, stored in wooden barrels.|$|E
5|$|Once there, Achebe was double-promoted in {{his first}} year, {{completing}} the first two years' studies in one, and spending only four years in secondary school, instead of the standard five. Achebe was unsuited to the school's sports regimen and belonged instead {{to a group of}} six exceedingly studious pupils. So intense were their study habits that the headmaster banned the reading of textbooks from <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> o'clock in the afternoon (though other activities and other books were allowed).|$|E
60|$|It was <b>five</b> minutes <b>to</b> <b>six</b> when Aspel {{ascended the}} steps of St. Martin's-le-Grand. The usual rush was in progress.

50|$|The 2011-12 CWHL {{season was}} the fifth in league history. Regular season play begun on October 22, 2011, as the {{defending}} champion Montreal Stars host the Brampton Thunder. The league expanded from <b>five</b> teams <b>to</b> <b>six</b> as Team Alberta (CWHL) joined the league for competitive play. The 2012 Clarkson Cup in Niagara Falls was also contested between the Stars and Thunder, with Montreal winning its second consecutive title.|$|R
5|$|One of {{the easier}} Western species to grow, Banksia lemanniana has some horticultural {{potential}} in its attractive chocolate buds, green-yellow hanging flower spikes and large grey spikes with prominent follicles. It generally grows quite quickly, but nevertheless takes <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> years to flower from seed. It prefers a more alkaline rocky or sandy soil, with a nominal pH range from 6 to 7.5. It favours a sunny position and good drainage, {{and has been}} successfully cultivated in more humid climates on Australia's east coast. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 27 to 43 days to germinate.|$|E
5|$|The eggs hatch after 53 to 60days of {{incubation}} by both parents. Chicks {{are born}} with their eyes open and sometimes {{can take up to}} a week to leave the shell completely. The young are covered with a grayish down until they are almost as large as their parents. They are able to fly after <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> months, but continue to roost and forage with their parents until they are in their second year, at which point the parents typically turn their energies to a new nest. Ravens are the main predatory threat to condor eggs, while golden eagles and bears are potential predators of condor offspring.|$|E
5|$|Banksia aculeata grows slowly, {{generally}} taking <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> {{years to}} flower from seed, {{though there is}} a report of it flowering in three years at Strathmerton in Victoria. Regarding its potential as an ornamental plant, Alex George observes that the flowers are brightly coloured but have a short life and are obscured by the foliage, which is quite prickly. He nonetheless considers both the new foliage and the infructescence attractive. This species can grow in a range of soil types so long as they provide good drainage. The nominal soil pH range is from 5.5 to 6.5. It prefers full sun, although it will grow in partly shaded situations, producing fewer flowers. It will tolerate light pruning.|$|E
