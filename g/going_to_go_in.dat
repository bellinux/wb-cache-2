25|$|I {{would say}} from my gut {{that we are}} {{probably}} as low as we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> that valley, and heading for the next peak. That's fine with me because everybody needs a turn. We've been {{at the top of}} the mountain twice already, and, if nothing else, we need to get out of the way and let other bands have some fun. I mean, now there's variety that Christian kids can have. And they don't just grab Petra. Now they can grab Jars of Clay, dc Talk or Newsboys.|$|E
2500|$|She {{started to}} see people that weren't there. She thought I could see them too, but, of course, I couldn't. I would make fun of her like, [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> the other room and you stay here and talk to your friends." ...|$|E
2500|$|Project 86 has {{sometimes}} been labeled a [...] "Christian band", although the band itself eschewed the label. The band considers its art {{to be the best}} conveyance of their message. Frontman Andrew Schwab has offered several statements on the topic. [...] "We're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> there and say 'Hey we're the Christian band. We're going to carry ourselves like a normal band. Hopefully people will like our music and investigate into the band [...] and they will learn our beliefs." [...] "If we're playing at Ozzfest or on Family Values...," [...] the band told 7ball after the release of their second album, [...] "there is a greater level of tact necessary in order to reach that sort of audience." [...] In a 2007 interview, Schwab further opined [...] "We always tell people that the goal has been to just write music that we love, and write music hopefully that is challenging and inspiring to people and doesn't sound like everything else out there." ...|$|E
25|$|We have {{to adjust}} the AMT. That has to be reduced. We {{have to get rid}} of the death tax, which is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> zero <b>in</b> 2010, which is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> create an {{incentive}} – I can't imagine what kind of an incentive it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> create. It's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> zero <b>in</b> 2010. And then <b>in</b> 2011, it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> 55 percent. And we have to make sure that the tax cuts that went into effect, that that level remains. Otherwise, we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have one of the biggest tax increases in history in 2011. And I would look to try to regularize the rates and look for some marginal reduction, even beyond what we're doing right now.|$|R
5000|$|After it happened, all {{the people}} in {{positions}} of authority {{went out of their way}} to script this. They purposely interfered with the investigation; they covered it up. I think they thought they could control it, and they realized that their recruiting efforts were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> hell <b>in</b> a handbasket if the truth about his death got out. They blew up their poster boy.|$|R
5000|$|Michelle Carlbert of TV Fanatic {{rated the}} episode with 4.9/5, saying [...] "this one it <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> down <b>in</b> {{the history of}} TV weddings {{as one of the}} most unlucky ever" [...] and also laid praise on Cam and Mitchell's storyline.|$|R
2500|$|I {{had these}} pieces, these guitar pieces, that I {{wanted to put}} together. I had a whole idea {{of a piece of}} music that I really wanted to try and present to {{everybody}} and try and come to terms with. Bit difficult really, because it started on acoustic, and as you know it goes through to the electric parts. But we had various run-throughs [...] where I was playing the acoustic guitar and jumping up and picking up the electric guitar. Robert was sitting in the corner, or rather leaning against the wall, and as I was routining the rest of the band with this idea and this piece, he was just writing. And {{all of a sudden he}} got up and started singing, along with another run-through, and he must have had 80% of the words there ... I had these sections, and I knew what order they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in,</b> but it was just a matter of getting everybody to feel comfortable with each gear shift that was going to be coming.|$|E

6000|$|A {{tremendous}} tide of daring rose in Lemuel's breast. He {{was just}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> and risk {{the same thing}} himself, when {{a voice in the}} crowd behind him said, [...] "Hain't you had 'most enough, young feller? Some the rest of us would like a chance to see now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{precisely}} and {{exactly what she}} is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do. <b>Go</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> your supper, and I will push him about until you come out again. Then you can {{show me how to}} put him to bed." ...|$|R

5000|$|Saxena sees no {{contradiction in}} being a wealthy Marxist. He is a theorist, not an activist, he said. [...] "I'm not a Che Guevara," [...] he said. [...] "I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> sit <b>in</b> the jungle fighting. My {{analysis}} is basically a Marxist analysis of risk. I'm not a capitalist. I make money through sheer brain power." ...|$|R

5000|$|Prior to the draft, draft analyst Mike Mayock {{was quoted}} saying [...] "I wouldn't be {{surprised}} if he snuck in late in the first round. If he doesn't, I think he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> the front half of the second round. He's too good." ...|$|E

Of course the posts and the bars are!".- Which team scores first in this match has a greater {{chance to win the}} match.- Gary Neville has 3 weaknesses: no pace, running slow, not fast enough.- This match can be put in the fridge now.

5000|$|The {{dress was}} {{designed}} by David and Elizabeth Emanuel, who {{described it as a}} dress that [...] "had to be something that was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> down <b>in</b> history, but also something that Diana loved", and which would be [...] "suitably dramatic in order to make an impression". Diana Spencer personally selected the designers to make her wedding dress because she was fond of a chiffon blouse they designed for her formal photo session with Lord Snowdon.|$|R
5000|$|Culp was not {{surprised}} when his character was killed off, stating {{that he had a}} suspicion that someone was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> the first season finale. Producer and writer Kevin Murphy explained the reasoning for killing off the Rex character: [...] "As we neared the end of season 1, our plan was that each woman would enter a new life chapter, ... and Bree would become a single woman. We either had to have Rex divorce her or die." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with WWE on February 27, Scott said “We’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> the studio probably around May and record our next record. If you like [...] "Ladies and Gentlemen" [...] and [...] "Click Click Boom", and more dynamic stuff, it’s {{going to be an}} ass-whooping of a record. It’s going to be 45 minutes of ass-whooping!” Saliva toured with Sevendust in South Korea, Japan and a brief stint in Europe until July 2008.|$|E

[...] "It was obvious that the President was going to have to push through a very plain and airtight law that would, once and for all, abolish the practice of segregation. And segregation, as I intended to say in my testimony, was 'the stepchild of slavery'".|$|E
50|$|In {{the spring}} of 2016, Edgar said {{publicly}} that he believes Governor Bruce Rauner should sign the Democratic budget and support the Democratic pension plan. Edgar pushed for a pension bill to save $15 billion back in 1994. “We had a time bomb in our retirement system that was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> off <b>in</b> {{the first part of}} the 21st century,” Edgar told The State Journal Register in 1994. “This legislation defuses that time bomb.” The legislature passed Edgar’s bill unanimously.|$|R

5000|$|B.G. {{explained}} his personal development along with boasting his ability [...] "to make a classic album", {{in which he}} stated the following, [...] My style has changed and I’ve grown as a person. I was real open-minded when I made this record. I’ve {{got one of the}} best A&R reps in the business, Jean Nelson, and we’ve come up with a vision to make a classic album that’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> down <b>in</b> the hall of fame.

5000|$|Asked if he {{believed}} the country should try to keep such ratio, he replied: No, no. What I believe is that people should not deliberately alter the character and composition of the country without consulting the American people. If you adopt two children, Alan, you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> and you're going to decide who comes. Who should decide who comes and who doesn't? First, illegals should not come. Secondarily, the American people should be consulted about how many immigrants come, what are the criteria.—And we haven't been consulted.|$|E

5000|$|Pichfork {{summed up}} the album by calling Nelson [...] "(a) cosmic joker contemplating {{mortality}} with endearing humor and touching honesty". The Austin American-Statesman opined that it was [...] "Nelson’s best album since the 1990s" [...] and attributed its success to [...] "(a) near-perfect balance between Willie as songwriter and as interpreter". Sounds Like Nashville added that [...] "Nelson isn’t <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> quietly <b>in</b> the night. The ‘Red Headed Stranger’ has never done anything in that fashion, and at age 84, the singer continues to come out swinging on all cylinders." ...|$|R

He told 'em that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> and pitch ball and show 'em that he was there. And her certainly has made good. Now there isn't a man in the Union association who doubts for a minute that Duffy will stick with the Pirates." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2006, Radiohead singer Thom Yorke {{released}} his first solo album, The Eraser, comprising mostly electronic music. In 2009, wanting to recreate The Eraser with live musicians, Yorke recruited Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea, longtime Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich, drummer Joey Waronker of Beck and R.E.M., and percussionist Mauro Refosco of Forro in the Dark. He said: [...] "It’s like opening a big Pandora's Box, and I don’t know what direction it’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in.</b> We’ve got these bonkers rhythms made by machines, and musicians who {{can keep up}} with them - no problem - and the two can bounce off each other.

5000|$|The {{makers of}} the Bengali movie Ramdhanu (2014), {{directed}} by the duo Nandita Roy and Shiboprosad Mukherjee, had launched a copyright case against Hindi Medium with claims of story-line having a strong resemblance.
