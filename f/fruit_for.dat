5|$|Several reviewers {{compared}} Tipping the Velvet to Jeanette Winterson's Oranges Are Not the Only <b>Fruit</b> <b>for</b> {{a similar}} story of a woman's sexual awakening. Waters credits Winterson as an influence in lesbian writing, but states that the books are quite different and her writing is not like Winterson's at all. Waters suggests that reviewers have bracketed them together because Winterson {{was the only other}} lesbian author they could recall.|$|E

5|$|The {{east coast}} of the U.S. also began to consume more ice, {{particularly}} as more industrial and private customers found uses for refrigeration. Ice became increasingly used in the northeast of the U.S. to preserve dairy products and fresh <b>fruit</b> <b>for</b> market, the chilled goods being transported over the growing railroad lines. By the 1840s, ice was being used to transfer small quantities of goods further west across the continent. Eastern U.S. fishermen began to use ice to preserve their catches. Fewer businesses or individuals in the east harvested their own ice independently in winter, most preferring to rely on commercial providers.|$|E

5|$|Ficus rubiginosa {{was first}} {{cultivated}} in the United Kingdom in 1789, {{where it is}} grown in glasshouses. It is commonly used as a large ornamental tree in eastern Australia, in the North Island of New Zealand, and also in Hawaii and California, where it is also listed as an invasive species in some areas. It is useful as a shade tree in public parks and on golf courses. Not as prodigious as other figs, F. rubiginosa is suited to slightly more confined areas, such as lining car parks or suburban streets. However, surface roots can be large and intrusive and the thin bark readily damaged when struck. Tolerant of acid or alkaline soils, it is hardy to US Hardiness Zones 10B and 11, reaching 10m (35ft) high in 30 years. Planting trees 8–12m (30–40ft) apart will eventually result in a continuous canopy. The trees are of great value in providing <b>fruit</b> <b>for</b> birds and mammals, though drop large quantities of fruit and leaves, leaving a mess underfoot.|$|E
5|$|One {{young man}} kicked and smashed {{the window of}} a police car, lit a pack of matches, and set the {{upholstery}} on fire. After burning for a short time, the fuel tank exploded; a dozen more police cars and eight other automobiles would be destroyed in a similar fashion. The photo on the front cover of the Dead Kennedys 1980 album Fresh <b>Fruit</b> <b>for</b> Rotting Vegetables, which shows several police cars on fire, was taken that night. Several crowd members threw tear gas, which they had stolen from police vehicles. Riots began to break out, with one mob disrupting traffic. Electric trollies were disabled when their overhead wires were pulled down, and violence broke out against the police officers, who were outnumbered. Police Chief Charles Gain, standing inside City Hall, ordered officers not to attack and to simply stand their ground.|$|E
5|$|Trees play a {{significant}} role in reducing erosion and moderating the climate. They remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store large quantities of carbon in their tissues. Trees and forests provide a habitat for many species of animals and plants. Tropical rainforests are one of the most biodiverse habitats in the world. Trees provide shade and shelter, timber for construction, fuel for cooking and heating, and <b>fruit</b> <b>for</b> food as well as having many other uses. In parts of the world, forests are shrinking as trees are cleared to increase the amount of land available for agriculture. Because of their longevity and usefulness, trees have always been revered, with sacred groves in various cultures, and they play a role in many of the world's mythologies.|$|E

5|$|Young {{birds are}} {{initially}} mainly fed on invertebrates, often collected from low foliage or under bushes {{rather than in}} the grassland preferred by the adults. Adults will roam up to 1km (1000yd) from the nest on pasture or ploughed land. After fledging the young may accompany their parents until the onset of winter. Individuals or pairs will defend one or more fruit-bearing trees throughout the winter, mistletoe being preferred where available, with holly as the first choice elsewhere. Although the thrush normally feeds on the ground or other trees, the defence of this resource conserves the <b>fruit</b> <b>for</b> later in the season when other food items are becoming scarce. The trees are defended against conspecifics, other thrushes and species such as the bullfinch and great spotted woodpecker. In years when there is an abundance of winter fruit, this strategy may be abandoned, with the mistle thrushes foraging in flocks. Conversely, in hard winters, the defender may be overwhelmed by large flocks of fieldfares, redwings or Bohemian waxwings.|$|E
