40|$|The {{importance}} of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), as {{adult stem cells}} (ASCs) able to divide {{into a variety of}} different cells is of utmost importance for stem cell researches. In this study, the ability of <b>cartilage</b> <b>extract</b> to induce differentiation of rat derived omentum tissue MSCs (rOT-MSCs) into chondrocyte cells (CCs) was investigated. After isolation of rOT-MSCs, they were co-cultured with different concentrations of hyaline <b>cartilage</b> <b>extract</b> and chondrocyte differentiation was monitored. Expression of MSCs markers was analyzed via flow cytometry. Moreover, expression of octamer- binding transcription factor- 4 (Oct- 4), Wilm's tumor suppressor gene- 1 (WT- 1), aggrecan (AG), collagen type-II (CT-II) and collagen type-X (CT-X) was analyzed using RT-PCR on 16, 18 and 21 days. Furthermore, immunocytochemistry and western blot were performed for CT-II production. Finally, proteoglycans (PGs) were examined using toluidine blue and alcian blue staining. The phenotypic characterization revealed the positive expression of CD 90, CD 44 and negative expression of CD 45 in rOT-MSCs. These cells also expressed mRNA of Oct- 4 and WT- 1 as markers of omentum tissue. Differentiated rOT-MSCs in the presence of 20 µg / ml <b>cartilage</b> <b>extract</b> expressed AG, CT-II, CT-X, and PGs as specific markers of CCs. These observations suggest that <b>cartilage</b> <b>extract</b> is potentially able to induce differentiation of MSCs into chondrocyte lineage and may be considered as an available source for imposing tissue healing on the damaged cartilage.

40|$|Previous {{in vitro}} {{studies have shown that}} shark <b>cartilage</b> <b>extracts</b> stimulate human leukocytes to release {{significant}} levels of TNFα, a cytokine typical of a Th 1 immune response. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate further the effects of shark cartilage on cellular immune function, particularly cell proliferation, apoptosis, and IL- 4 and INFγ production. The viability and proliferation of cell cultures grown in the presence of shark <b>cartilage</b> <b>extract</b> was not significantly different from unstimulated control cultures or those stimulated with mitogens (Con A, PMA, LPS), respectively. The effect of shark cartilage on apoptosis was determined by microscopic analysis of morphological apoptotic changes and by the detection of DNA fragmentation observed as characteristic ladder formation in agarose gel electrophoresis. While DNA fragmentation could not be demonstrated for cartilage-stimulated cells, characteristic morphological changes, indicative of apoptosis, were observed in leukocytes following incubation with shark <b>cartilage</b> <b>extract.</b> A statistically significant difference was not noted in the number of apoptotic cells present in cartilage-stimulated leukocytes and those stimulated with 0. 5 μM/ml of staurosporine, suggesting that apoptosis is induced in the presence of <b>cartilage</b> <b>extract.</b> Culture supernatants of cartilage-stimulated leukocytes were assayed for IL- 4 and IFN-γ by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Although a low level of IL- 4 and INFγ was detected in culture supernatants of Con A and PMA stimulated cells it was not significantly different from that of unstimulated control cultures. Thus the significance of the absence of detectable IL- 4 or INFγ in supernatants of cartilage- stimulated cultures could not be determined. However, as previously shown, supernatants did contain TNFα. Results of the study did not show a definitive pattern of cytokine production, characteristic of either a Th 1 or Th 2 type immune response...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{characterize}} {{the time course of}} aggrecan and type II collagen degradation in the rat iodoacetate model of cartilage degeneration {{in relationship to}} the temporal sequence that has been described in human osteoarthritis (OA). DesignRats were injected intra-articularly in one knee joint with iodoacetate and damage to the tibial plateau was assessed from digitized images captured using an image analyzer. The articular cartilage from the tibial plateau was harvested, extracted and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content was measured using the dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) assay. Cartilage aggrecan neoepitopes were detected in <b>cartilage</b> <b>extracts</b> by Western blotting using antibodies recognizing the aggrecanase-generated C-terminal neoepitope NITEGE (BC- 13) and the MMP-generated C-terminal neoepitope DIPEN (BC- 4). A type II collagen collagenase-generated neoepitope was detected in <b>cartilage</b> <b>extracts</b> by ELISA using the Col 2 - 3 / 4 Cshort antibody; denatured collagen was detected using the Col 2 - 3 / 4 m antibody. ResultsDegenerative joint changes and proteoglycan (GAG) loss progressed with time after iodoacetate injection. Western blotting of <b>cartilage</b> <b>extracts</b> of iodoacetate treated rats demonstrated an increase in both aggrecanase- and MMP-generated epitopes with the NITEGE aggrecanase neoepitope being significantly elevated on days 7, 14 and 21 while DIPEN the MMP neoepitope was significantly elevated on days 7 and 14. The type II collagen neoepitope recognized by Col 2 - 3 / 4 Cshort was significantly increased in <b>cartilage</b> <b>extracts</b> of rats at days 14 and 21 after iodoacetate injection. ConclusionThe proteoglycan fragments extracted from the knee cartilage of rats after the intra-articular injection of iodoacetate appeared to result from cleavage at both aggrecanase and MMP sites. Cleavage of type II collagen by collagenase was also detected after iodoacetate injection and occurred subsequent to the initiation of aggrecan loss. These observations serve to demonstrate similarities in the mechanisms of cartilage degeneration induced by iodoacetate to those seen in articular cartilage in OA...|$|R

40|$|Incorporation of 35 SO 42 - into {{adenosine}} 5 '-phosphosulfate (APS), 3 '-phosphoadenosine 5 '-phosphosulfate (PAPS), and chondroitin sulfate was simultaneously {{assessed with}} extracts prepared from epiphyseal cartilage of neonatal normal or homozygous brachymorphic mice. Radioactivity measured in APS, PAPS, and chondroitin sulfate of <b>extracts</b> from brachymorphic <b>cartilage</b> was approximately 300 %, 9 %, and 13 % {{of the normal}} levels, respectively. Even though more APS accumulated in the mutant <b>cartilage</b> <b>extracts,</b> APS actually synthesized (total 35 SO 42 - incorporated into APS, PAPS, and macromolecular products) was only 17 % {{of that in the}} normal. However, of the amount synthesized, 90 % and 55 % of newly synthesized APS were converted to PAPS by <b>cartilage</b> <b>extracts</b> of normal and brachymorphic mice, respectively. Specific assays for ATP sulfurylase (sulfate adenylyltransferase; ATP:sulfate adenylyltransferase, EC 2. 7. 7. 4) and APS kinase (adenylylsulfate kinase; ATP:adenylylsulfate 3 '-phosphotransferase, EC 2. 7. 1. 25) showed that the sulfurylase enzyme activity is reduced to approximately 1 / 2 and the kinase to approxomately 1 / 14 in brachymorphic mice.

40|$|Although {{different}} models for rheumatoid arthritis have been studied, the pathogenesis in humans remains unknown. A possible mechanism is the crossreactivity between bacterial components and the target-tissue, the cartilage. The {{existence of this}} crossreactivity is supported by various data from clinical and experimental studies. Here we provide direct evidence that priming in vivo with cell wall fragments of Streptococcus pyogenes or Escherichia coli can induce a cellular and humoral anti-cartilage response in Balb/c mice in vitro. T cells isolated from these mice can be stimulated in vitro to proliferate {{by a variety of}} antigens among which are the priming bacterium, an unrelated bacterium, small bacterial components and diverse antigens of cartilagenous origin. In bacterium-primed mice antibodies were also detected that displayed a reactivity to <b>cartilage</b> <b>extract</b> besides the reactivity to bacteria. A crossreactive response occurred in vivo in certain circumstances: a delayed type hypersensitivity reaction could be elicited in cell-wall-primed mice by challenge with <b>cartilage</b> <b>extract.</b> For the expression of this crossreactive response in vivo however, it was obligatory to attenuate the mouse's suppressor-circuit.

40|$|Extracts {{of human}} {{articular}} cartilage contain proteases capable of degrading the proteoglycan component of cartilage matrix at neutral and acid pH. These enzymes have been partially purified by ion exchange chromotography and characterized by disc electrophoresis, inhibition patterns, and action of proteoglycan. Three distinct metalloproteases are described. A neutral protease that digests proteoglycan subunit optimally at pH 7. 25 has been purified up to 900 -fold. It is strongly inhibited by o-phenanthroline, alpha- 2 -macroglobulin, and egg white, {{and to a}} lesser extent by D-penicillamine and EDTA. Inhibition by chelating agents is reversed by cobalt, zinc, and ferrous ions. Two acid metalloproteases, distinct from cathespins B 1, D, and F, digest proteoglycan subunit at pH 4. 5 and 5. 5. Both are inhibited by o-phenanthroline and activity is restored by cobalt, zinc, or ferrous ions. With electron microscopy, it was found that cartilage slices were depleted of ruthenium red-staining matrix proteoglycan after incubation in vitro with a partially purified <b>cartilage</b> <b>extract</b> at neutral pH. Sedimentation, gel chromatography, sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, and immuno-diffusion studies of digests of isolated proteoglycan fraction produced by the partially purified <b>cartilage</b> <b>extract</b> at neutral and acid pH confirmed that the cartilage enzymes act only on the protein component of proteoglycan subunit, producing fragments with 5 to 12 chondroitin sulfate chains.

40|$|Inactivation of the perlecan gene {{leads to}} {{perinatal}} lethal chondrodysplasia. The similarity to the phenotypes of the Col 2 A 1 knock-out and the disproportionate micromelia mutation suggests perlecan involvement in cartilage collagen matrix assembly. We now present {{a mechanism for}} the defect in collagen type II fibril assembly by perlecan-null chondrocytes. Cartilage perlecan is a heparin sulfate or a mixed heparan sulfate/ chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. The latter form binds collagen and accelerates fibril formation in vitro, with more defined fibril morphology and increased fibril diameters produced {{in the presence of}} perlecan. Interestingly, the enhancement of collagen fibril formation is independent on the core protein and is mimicked by chondroitin sulfate E but neither by chondroitin sulfate D nor dextran sulfate. Furthermore, perlecan chondroitin sulfate contains the 4, 6 -disulfated disaccharides typical for chondroitin sulfate E. Indeed, purified glycosaminoglycans from perlecan-enriched fractions of <b>cartilage</b> <b>extracts</b> contain elevated levels of 4, 6 -disulfated chondroitin sulfate disaccharides and enhance collagen fibril formation. The effect on collagen assembly is proportional to the content of the 4, 6 - disulfated disaccharide in the different <b>cartilage</b> <b>extracts,</b> with growth plate cartilage glycosaminoglycan being the most efficient enhancer. These findings demonstrate a role for perlecan chondroitin sulfate side chains in cartilage extracellular matrix assembly and provide an explanation for the perlecan-null chondrodysplasia...|$|R

40|$|The {{promotion}} of crude shark <b>cartilage</b> <b>extracts</b> as {{a cure for}} cancer has contributed to at least two significant negative outcomes: a dramatic decline in shark populations and a diversion of patients from effective cancer treatments. An alleged lack of cancer in sharks constitutes a key justification for its use. Herein, both malignant and benign neoplasms of sharks and their relatives are described, including previously unreported cases from the Registry of Tumors in Lower Animals, and two sharks with two cancers each. Additional justifications for using shark cartilage are illogical extensions of the finding of antiangiogenic and anti-invasive substances in cartilage. Scientific evidence to date supports neither the efficacy of crude <b>cartilage</b> <b>extracts</b> nor the ability of effective components to reach and eradicate cancer cells. The fact that people think shark cartilage consumption can cure cancer illustrates the serious potential impacts of pseudoscience.

40|$|Low {{molecular}} mass proteoglycans (PG) were isolated from human articular cartilage and from pig laryngeal cartilage, which contained protein cores of similar size (Mr 40 - 44 kDa). However, the PG from human articular cartilage contained dermatan sulphate (DS) chains (50 % chondroitinase AC resistant), whereas chains from pig laryngeal PG were longer and contained only chondroitin sulphate (CS). Disaccharide analysis after chondroitinase ABC digestion {{showed that the}} human DS-PG contained more 6 -sulphated residues (34 %) than the pig CS-PG (6 %) and both contained fewer 6 -sulphated residues than the corresponding high Mr aggregating CS-PGs from these tissues (86 % and 20 % from human and pig respectively). Cross-reaction of both proteoglycans with antibodies to bovine bone and skin DS-PG-II and human fibroblasts DS-PG suggested that the isolated proteoglycans were the humans DS-PG-II and pigs CS-PG-II homologues of the cloned and sequenced bovine proteoglycan. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the pig CS-PG-II were shown to cross-react with human DS-PG-II.

40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) is an {{autoimmune disease}} of the synovial joints. The autoimmune character of RA is underscored by prominent production of autoantibodies such as those against IgG (rheumatoid factor), and {{a broad array of}} joint tissue-specific and other endogenous citrullinated proteins. Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) can be detected in the sera and synovial fluids of RA patients and ACPA seropositivity is one of the diagnostic criteria of RA. Studies have demonstrated that RA T cells respond to citrullinated peptides (epitopes) of proteoglycan (PG) aggrecan, {{which is one of the}} most abundant macromolecules of articular cartilage. However, it is not known if the PG molecule is citrullinated in vivo in human cartilage, and if so, whether citrulline-containing neoepitopes of PG (CitPG) can contribute to autoimmunity in RA. CitPG was detected in human <b>cartilage</b> <b>extracts</b> using ACPA+ RA sera in dot blot and Western blot. Citrullination status of in vitro citrullinated recombinant G 1 domain of human PG (rhG 1) was confirmed by antibody-based and chemical methods, and potential sites of citrullination in rhG 1 were explored by molecular modeling. CitPG-specific serum autoantibodies were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and CitPG was localized in osteoarthritic (OA) and RA cartilage using immunohistochemistry. Sera from ACPA+ RA patients reacted with PG purified from normal human cartilage specimens. PG fragments (mainly those containing the G 1 domain) from OA or RA <b>cartilage</b> <b>extracts</b> were recognized by ACPA+ sera but not by serum from ACPA- individuals. ACPA+ sera also reacted with in vitro citrullinated rhG 1 and G 3 domain-containing fragment(s) of PG. Molecular modeling suggested multiple sites of potential citrullination within the G 1 domain. The immunohistochemical localization of CitPG was different in OA and RA cartilage. CitPG is a new member of citrullinated proteins identified in human joints.

Methods Fn-fs were immunochemically identified in <b>cartilage</b> <b>extracts</b> from patients with OA or rheumatoid arthritis or in bovine cartilage cultured with IL- 1 α or in bovine synovial fluids treated with stromelysin- 1 (MMP- 3). The effect of removal of Fn-fs from OA synovial fluids was tested by passing fluids over an anti-Fn column and adding the resultant fluids to bovine cartilage cultures to measure proteoglycan (PG) degradation. Gelatin–Sepharose purified Fns from bovine plasma, synovial fluid or cartilage were digested with MMP- 3 and the Fn-fs tested for degradation of PG in cultured <b>cartilage.</b> Results: <b>Extracts</b> of <b>cartilage</b> from patients with rheumatoid arthritis or with OA contained a range of Fn-fs. Removal of Fn-fs from OA synovial fluids significantly reduced the resultant damage when the fluids were added to cultured cartilage. Addition of IL- 1 α to cultured cartilage or of MMP- 3 to synovial fluids enhanced generation of Fn-fs. Fn-fs, whether derived from bovine plasma or synovial fluid or cartilage Fns, damaged cartilage.

Aimdescribe the {{mechanisms}} involved in FB migration and how to diagnose them. MethodologyFrom a sample of 3, 000 foreign bodies, during 40 years, we analyzed four which had extra-lumen migration. We analyzed clinical, radiologic, endoscopic and ultrasound data collected at the medical documentation service. Resultsthree clinical histories are presented, describing two fish bones and one piece of <b>fish</b> <b>cartilage.</b> FB shifting was analyzed in all of them. Migration started in the esophagus in two, one going to the aorta {{and the other to}} the neck area. In the other two, migration started in the pharynx, and the FB moved towards the prevertebral fascia and the other externalized in the submandibular region. The mechanisms and the risks posed to the patient, by FB migration, and the way to diagnose them are hereby discussed. Conclusionsthe study allows us to determine that FB can move through the body but not towards the heart. The study also serves as a warning sign: in cases of prolonged histories of FB ingestion, imaging studies are mandatory before endoscopic examination...|$|R
5000|$|Moderate {{or heavy}} {{clinical}} infection of fish with whirling disease can be presumptively diagnosed {{on the basis}} of changes in behavior and appearance about 35 to 80 days after initial infection, though [...] "injury or deficiency in dietary tryptophan and ascorbic acid can evoke similar signs", so conclusive diagnosis may require finding myxospores in the <b>fish's</b> <b>cartilage.</b> [...] In heavy infections, only examining cartilage microscopically may be needed to find spores. In less severe infections, the most common test involves digestion of the cranial cartilage with the proteases pepsin and trypsin (pepsin-trypsin digest—PTD) before looking for spores. The head and other tissues can be further examined using histopathology to confirm whether the location and morphology of the spores matches what is known for M. cerebralis. Serological identification of spores in tissue sections using an antibody raised against the spores is also possible. Parasite identity can also be confirmed using the polymerase chain reaction to amplify the 415 base pair 18S rRNA gene from M. cerebralis. Fish should be screened at the life stage most susceptible to the parasites, with particular focus on fish in aquaculture units.|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} the direct involvement of increased collagenase {{activity in the}} cleavage of type II collagen in osteoarthritic human femoral condylar cartilage by developing and using antibodies reactive to carboxy-terminal (COL 2 - 3 / 4 C(short)) and amino-terminal (COL 2 - 1 / 4 N 1) neoepitopes generated by cleavage of native human type II collagen by collagenase matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) - 1 (collagenase- 1), MMP- 8 (collagenase- 2), and MMP- 13 (collagenase- 3). A secondary cleavage followed the initial cleavage produced by these recombinant collagenases. This generated neoepitope COL 2 - 1 / 4 N 2. There was significantly more COL 2 - 3 / 4 C(short) neoepitope in osteoarthritis (OA) compared to adult nonarthritic cartilages as determined by immunoassay of <b>cartilage</b> <b>extracts.</b> A synthetic preferential inhibitor of MMP- 13 significantly reduced the unstimulated release in culture of neoepitope COL 2 - 3 / 4 C(short) from human osteoarthritic cartilage explants. These data suggest that collagenase(s) produced by chondrocytes is (are) involved in the cleavage and denaturation of type II collagen in articular cartilage, that this is increased in OA, and that MMP- 13 may {{play a significant role}} in this process...|$|R
40|$|Type X {{collagen}} is a short-chain homotrimeric collagen {{expressed in}} the hypertrophic zone of calcifying cartilage. The clustering of mutations in the carboxyl-terminal NC 1 domain in Schmid metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (SMCD) suggested a critical role for this type X collagen domain, but since no direct analysis of cartilage has been conducted in SMCD patients, the mechanisms of type X collagen dysfunction remain controversial. To resolve this problem, we obtained SMCD growth plate cartilage, determined the type X collagen mutation, and analyzed the expression of mutant and normal type X collagen mRNA and protein. The mutation was a single nucleotide substitution that changed the Tyr 632 codon (TAC) to a stop codon (TAA). However, analysis of {{the expression of the}} normal and mutant allele transcripts in growth plate cartilage by reverse transcription PCR, restriction enzyme mapping, and a single nucleotide primer extension assay, demonstrated that only normal mRNA was present. The lack of mutant mRNA is most likely the result of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, a common fate for transcripts carrying premature termination mutations. Furthermore, no mutant protein was detected by immunoblotting <b>cartilage</b> <b>extracts.</b> Our data indicates that a functionally null allele leading to type X collagen haploinsufficiency is the molecular basis of SMCD in this patient...|$|R
40|$|Collagen type XI {{is a minor}} {{constituent}} of heterotypic collagen fibrils of developing cartilage and plays a regulatory role in fibril diameter. Collagen type XI is a heterotrimer composed of the a 1, a 2 and a 3 chains. The mRNA encoding exons 6 a, 6 b and 8 of the a 1 chain are expressed alternatively to generate six possible isoforms. The 6 b-containing isoform has the most restricted distribution of all isoforms. It is first localized in the developing long bone, where mineralized tissue initially forms, and is later restricted to regions of cartilage that will be subsequently converted into bone. Bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP- 1) and related proteins cleave procollagens I–III, V and VII, yielding triple-helical molecules that associate into collagen fibrils. The present study demonstrates that the a 1 chain of collagen type XI {{can serve as a}} substrate for BMP- 1. In addition, the efficiency with which BMP- 1 processes different isoforms of the a 1 chain varies. The amino acid sequence adjacent to the processing site influences the rate and extent of processing, as do sequences further away. Smaller fragments identified from <b>cartilage</b> <b>extracts</b> indicated that processing by BMP- 1, in combination with other processing enzymes, generates small fragments of p 6 b-containing isoforms...|$|R
40|$|Three main {{areas can}} be {{arbitrarily}} {{identified in the}} modern concept of treatment for osteoarthritis (OA); these are: 1) {{an impact on the}} progression of joint destruction; 2) suppression of peripheral pain mechanisms; and 3) inhibition of the central processes involved in the formation of pain sensation. Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate (CS) have become the first agents that are able to retard the development of cartilage degeneration. They have been used in medical practice for more than 40 years. A number of clinical trials of these drugs have yielded favorable results during their use in patients with OA. Another agent containing amino sugars and CS – sea <b>fish</b> <b>cartilage</b> hydrolysate has more recently emerged. Clinical trials have demonstrated that it is able to significantly relieve OA-induced pain.  To date, the main agent for the analgesic therapy of OA is considered to be nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that act on the peripheral mechanisms of pain and are widely used to treat diseases that are accompanied by chronic pain. However, a large-scale meta-analysis dealing with the experience with NSAIDs used to treat OA has shown that pain relief due to this therapy averaged only about 10 mm on a 100 -mm visual analogue scale.  To enhance the efficiency of therapy for OA, drug and non-drug treatments that affect the central mechanisms of pain in this disease are also used. </p...|$|R
40|$|Articular {{cartilage}} {{consists of}} chondrocytes and two major components, a collagen-rich framework and highly abundant proteoglycans. Most prior studies defining the zonal distribution of <b>cartilage</b> have <b>extracted</b> proteins with guanidine-HCl. However, an unextracted collagen-rich residual is left after extraction. In addition, the high abundance of anionic polysaccharide molecules <b>extracted</b> from <b>cartilage</b> adversely affects the chromatographic separation. In this study, we established {{a method for}} removing chondrocytes from cartilage sections with minimal extracellular matrix protein loss. The addition of surfactant to guanidine-HCl extraction buffer improved protein solubility. Ultrafiltration removed interference from polysaccharides and salts. Almost four-times more collagen peptides were extracted by the in situ trypsin digestion method. However, as expected, proteoglycans were more abundant within the guanidine-HCl extraction. These different methods were used to <b>extract</b> <b>cartilage</b> sections from different cartilage layers (superficial, intermediate, and deep), joint types (knee and hip), and disease states (healthy and osteoarthritic), and the extractions were evaluated by quantitative and qualitative proteomic analyses. The {{results of this study}} led to the identifications of the potential biomarkers of osteoarthritis (OA), OA progression, and the joint specific biomarkers...|$|R
40|$|Background: Tenascin-C (TN-C) is an {{extracellular}} matrix glycoprotein that {{is involved in}} tissue injury and repair processes. We analyzed TN-C expression in normal and osteoarthritic (OA) human cartilage, and evaluated its capacity to induce inflammatory and catabolic mediators in chondrocytes in vitro. The effect of TN-C on proteoglycan loss from articular cartilage in culture was also assessed. Methods: TN-C in culture media, <b>cartilage</b> <b>extracts,</b> and synovial fluid of human and animal joints was quantified using a sandwich ELISA and/or analyzed by Western immunoblotting. mRNA expression of TN-C and aggrecanases were analyzed by Taqman assays. Human and bovine primary chondrocytes and/or explant culture systems were utilized to study TN-C induced inflammatory or catabolic mediators and proteoglycan loss. Total proteoglycan and aggrecanase-generated ARG-aggrecan fragments were quantified in human and rat synovial fluids by ELISA. Results: TN-C protein and mRNA expression were significantly upregulated in OA cartilage with a concomitant elevation of TN-C levels in the synovial fluid of OA patients. IL- 1 enhanced TN-C expression in articular cartilage. Addition of TN-C induced IL- 6, PGE 2, and nitrate release and upregulated ADAMTS 4 mRNA in cultured primary human and bovine chondrocytes. TN-C treatment resulted in an increased loss of proteoglycan from cartilage explants in culture. A correlation was observed between TN-C and aggrecanase generated ARG-aggrecan fragment levels in th...|$|R
