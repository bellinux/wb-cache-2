40|$|A {{study was}} made of two ultraluminous X-ray soures (ULXs) in the nearby face-on, late-type Sb galaxy NGC 1313 using data from Suzaku, the 5 th Japanese X-ray satellite. Within the 90 ks observation, both sources named X- 1 and X- 2 {{exhibited}} luminosity change by about 50 %. The 0. 4 - 10 keV X-ray luminosity {{was measured to be}} 2. 5 x 10 (exp 40) <b>erg</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> and 5. 8 x 10 <b>erg</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> for X- 1 and X- 2, respectively, requiring a black hole of 50 - 200 solar mass in order not to exceed the Eddingtion limit. For X- 1 : the spectrum exhibited a strong power-law component with a high energy cutoff which is thought to arise from strong Comptonization by a disk corona, suggesting the source was in a very high state. Absorption line features with equivalent widths of 40 - 80 eV found at 7. 0 keV and 7. 8 keV in the X- 1 spectrum support the presence of a highly ionized plasma and a high mass accretion rate on the system. Oxygen abundance of the NGC 1313 circumstellar matter toward X- 1 was found to be subsolar, viz. O/H = (5. 0 plus or minus 1. 0) x 10 (exp - 4). The spectrum of X- 2 in fainter phase is best represented by a multicolor disk blackbody model with T (sub in) = 1. 2 - 1. 3 keV and becomes flatter as the flux increases; the source is interpreted to be in a slim disk state...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} results from {{broadband}} X-ray spectral analysis of 3 C 206 and PKS 070735 with Suzaku and Swift/BAT, {{two of the most}} luminous unobscured and obscured radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with hard X-ray luminosities of 10 (sup 45. 5) <b>erg</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> and 10 (sup 44. 9) <b>erg</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> (14 - 195 keV), respectively. Based on the radio core luminosity, we estimate that the X-ray spectrum of 3 C 206 contains a significant (60 % in the 14 - 195 keV band) contribution from the jet, while it is negligible in PKS 070735. We can successfully model the spectra with the jet component (for 3 C 206), the transmitted emission, and two reflection components from the torus and the accretion disk. The reflection strengths from the torus are found to be R(sub torus) (Omega/ 2 pi) = 0. 29 +/- 0. 18 and 0. 41 +/- 0. 18 for 3 C 206 and PKS 070735, respectively, which are smaller than those in typical Seyfert galaxies. Utilizing the torus model by Ikeda et al., we quantify the relation between the half-opening angle of a torus (theta(sub oa)) and the equivalent width of an iron-K line. The observed equivalent width of 3 C 206, less than 71 eV, constrains the column density in the equatorial plane to N(sup eq) (sub H) lesst han 10 (sup 23) per square centimeter, or the half-opening angle to theta(sub oa) greater than 80 deg. if N(sup eq) (sub H) = 10 (sup 24) per square centimeter is assumed. That of PKS 070735, 72 +/- 36 eV, is consistent with N(sup eq) (sub H) 10 (sup 23) per square centimeter. Our results suggest that the tori in luminous radio-loud AGNs are only poorly developed. The trend is similar to that seen in radio-quiet AGNs, implying that the torus structure is not different between AGNs with jets and without jets...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{research}} goal of {{this project}} is to perform follow-up observations of a recurrent ultraluminous supersoft X-ray source (SSS) in Ml 0 l. The source was first discovered by ROSAT and was confirmed as a SSS with a blackbody temperature of about l 00 eV by Chandra. During 2000 March, Chandra detected it at Lx= 4 e 39 <b>erg</b> <b>per</b> <b>second,</b> and then in 2000 October, its luminosity dropped to around le 39 <b>erg</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> During 2004, Chandra is conducting a monitoring program for Ml 0 l. The SSS was near the detection limit during January, March, and May; the X-ray spectra were harder with a power-law shape, and the X-ray luminosity was about 3 e 37 erg/second, a factor of greater than 200 fainter than that in the previous high state. The source {{was found to be}} in outburst again during the July 5 observation, with an X-ray luminosity of about 7 e 39 erg/second. Data taken on July 6, 7, and 8 show that the source was in a strong outburst with a peak bolometric luminosity of about 7 e 39 erg/second. In general, the X-ray spectra are best described with an absorbed blackbody model with temperatures of approximately 50 - 100 eV. In addition, we found absorption edges at 0. 33, 0. 57, 0. 66, and 0. 88 keV in two of the high state spectra. These features may signal the presence of highly ionized gas {{in the vicinity of the}} accretor (e. g., warm absorber). In order to study an ultraluminous SSS in outburst in detail, we proposed a TOO XMM observation to observe the source. The observation was taken on July 23 and the source was fainter with a luminosity of 6 e 38 ergs, and a harder X-ray spectrum with a power-law tail seen up to 7 keV. This clearly indicates that the source was in the decline stage with spectral change. In addition to the XMM observation, we also arranged radio observation and a simultaneous CFHT observation. The X-ray results were published in ATel and ApJL. There were several more Chandra observations taken after 2004 July. The source was in a low luminosity state but it underwent another X-ray outburst in 2004 December. We are arranging more follow-up observations for this intriguing source...|$|E

We have constructed a detailed exposure map {{to compensate for}} effects of non-uniform exposure. The flux-number relation is best described by a power-law with a slope of alpha = 1. 66 plus or minus 0. 11.

The luminosity function shows a smoothly connected two power-law form, with an index of gamma (sub 1) = 0. 9 below, and gamma (sub 2) = 2. 2 above the turn-over luminosity of L(sub *), = 4. 6 x 10 (sup 43) <b>ergs</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> The emissivity of all INTEGRAL AGNs per unit volume is W(sub 20 - 40 keV) (greater than 10 (sup 41) <b>ergs</b> <b>per</b> <b>second)</b> = 2. 8 x 10 (sup 38) <b>ergs</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> h(sup 3) (sub 70) Mpc(sup - 3).

Because the sample used in this study is truly local (z(raised bar) = 0. 022)), only limited conclusions can be drawn for the evolution of AGNs in this energy band. But the objects explaining the peak in the cosmic X-ray background are likely to be either low luminosity AGN (L(sub x) less than 10 (sup 41) <b>ergs</b> <b>per</b> <b>second)</b> or of other type, such as intermediate mass black holes, clusters, and star forming regions...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of ultraluminous X-ray sources are point sources that are spatially offset from the nuclei of nearby galaxies and whose X-ray luminosities exceed the theoretical maximum for spherical infall (the Eddington limit) onto stellar-mass black holes. Their X-ray luminosities in the 0. 5 – 10 kiloelectronvolt energy band range from 10 [superscript 39] to 10 [superscript 41] <b>ergs</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> Because higher masses imply less extreme ratios of the luminosity to the isotropic Eddington limit, theoretical models {{have focused on}} black hole rather than neutron star systems. The most challenging sources to explain are those at the luminous end of the range (more than 10 [superscript 40] <b>ergs</b> <b>per</b> <b>second),</b> which require black hole masses of 50 – 100 times the solar value or significant departures from the standard thin disk accretion that powers bright Galactic X-ray binaries, or both. Here we report broadband X-ray observations of the nuclear region of the galaxy M 82 that reveal pulsations with an average period of 1. 37 seconds and a 2. 5 -day sinusoidal modulation. The pulsations result from the rotation of a magnetized neutron star, and the modulation arises from its binary orbit. The pulsed flux alone corresponds to an X-ray luminosity in the 3 – 30 kiloelectronvolt range of 4. 9 × 10 [superscript 39] <b>ergs</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> The pulsating source is spatially coincident with a variable source that can reach an X-ray luminosity in the 0. 3 – 10 kiloelectronvolt range of 1. 8 × 10 [superscript 40] <b>ergs</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> This association implies a luminosity of about 100 times the Eddington limit for a 1. 4 -solar-mass object, or more than ten times brighter than any known accreting pulsar.

In addition, six more outbursts {{have been observed}} during INTEGRAL'S Galactic Plane Scans. X-ray pulsations have been detected with a pulse period of 41. 691798 plus or minus 0. 000016 s. The X-ray luminosity in the 5 - 300 keV energy range was 9. 7 x 10 (exp 36) <b>erg</b> <b>per</b> <b>second,</b> for a distance of 7. 1 kpc.

Moreover, a four-day delay between periastron passage and the peak of the outburst is observed. We present {{for the first time a}} 5 - 300 keV broad-band spectrum of this source. It can be modelled by the sum of a disk black body (kT(sub BB) approximately 8 keV) and either with a power law model with Gamma= 2. 04 plus or minus 0. 11 keV or a Comptonized component (spherical geometry, kT(sub e). = 30 keV, tau = 2. 64, kT(sub w) = 1. 5 keV) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} Chandra {{observation}} of IRAS 19254 - 7245, a nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxy {{also known as}} the Superantennae. The high spatial resolution of Chandra allows us to disentangle {{for the first time the}} diffuse starburst (SB) emission from the embedded Compton-thick active galactic nucleus (AGN) in the southern nucleus. No AGN activity is detected in the northern nucleus. The 2 - 10 keV spectrum of the AGN emission is fitted by a flat power law (TAU = 1. 3) and an He-like Fe Kalpha line with equivalent width 1. 5 keV, consistent with previous observations. The Fe K line profile could be resolved as a blend of a neutral 6. 4 keV line and an ionized 6. 7 keV (He-like) or 6. 9 keV (H-like) line. Variability of the neutral line is detected compared with the previous XMM-Newton and Suzaku observations, demonstrating the compact size of the iron line emission. The spectrum of the galaxy-scale extended emission excluding the AGN and other bright point sources is fitted with a thermal component with a best-fit kT of approximately 0. 8 keV. The 2 - 10 keV luminosity of the extended emission is about one order of magnitude lower than that of the AGN. The basic physical and structural properties of the extended emission are fully consistent with a galactic wind being driven by the SB. A candidate ultraluminous X-ray source is detected 8 south of the southern nucleus.

These stars are known to be moderately strong, X-ray sources (L(sub x) approx. equal to = 10 (sup 32) - 10 (sup 33) <b>erg</b> <b>per</b> <b>second).</b> These values are at the extreme high end of the known luminosity distribution for active coronal systems, but several orders of magnitude below typical X-ray binaries. The hard X-ray spectra for these systems are quite similar. They can be well fitted by either optically thin thermal plasma models with kT = 12. 5 - 14 keV or a cutoff powerlaw + gaussian line model with photon indices in the 1. 3 - 1. 5 range and a line energy of 6. 7 keV. The 20 - 50 keV light curves show no evidence for flaring and no significant evidence for periodic variability. It has been proposed that the X-ray emission is due to either accretion onto a white dwarf companion or magnetic activity near the surface of the Be star. We discuss in detail {{the pros and cons of}} each scenario towards explaining our spectral and temporal results. Given that both thermal and nonthermal models fit the data equally well, we cannot use the spectra to delineate between these two scenarios. Recent observations indicate that gamma Cas has a approx. 1 solar mass companion in a 203. 59 day orbit. This is consistent with the white dwarf - Be star binary model but the lack of periodic modulation of the flux on this timescale calls this conclusion into question. On the other hand the lack of flaring activity may rule against the magnetic activity model.

From our list of {{approximately}} 100 point sources, we attempt to determine if there is a low-state counterpart to the Ultraluminous X-ray (ULX) population, searching for a soft-hard state dichotomy similar to that known for Galactic X-ray binaries and testing the specific predictions of the IMBH hypothesis. To this end, we searched for low-state objects, which we defined as objects within our sample which had a spectrum well fit by a simple absorbed power law, and high-state objects, which we defined as objects better fit by a combined blackbody and a power law. Assuming that low-state)) objects accrete at approximately 10 % of the Eddington luminosity (Done & Gierlinski 2003) and that high-state objects accrete near the Eddington luminosity we further divided our sample of sources into low and high state ULX sources. We classify 16 sources as low-state ULXs and 26 objects as high-state ULXs. As in Galactic black hole systems, the spectral indices, GAMMA, of the lowstate objects, as well as the luminosities, tend to be lower than those of the high-state objects. The observed range of blackbody temperatures for the high state is 0. 1 - 1 keV, with the most luminous systems tending toward the lowest temperatures. We therefore divide our high-state ULXs into candidate IMBHs (with blackbody temperatures of approximately 0. 1 keV) and candidate stellar mass BHs (with blackbody temperatures of approximately 1. 0 keV). A subset of the candidate stellar mass BHs have spectra that are well-fit by a Comptonization model, a property similar of Galactic BHs radiating in the very-high state near the Eddington limit...|$|E

The BATSE data provide, for the first time, a systematic coverage of the whole sample at high energies. BATSE data from nearly four years of observations (1993 November - 1997 September) were analyzed using standard BATSE occultation analysis software to extract a signal from sources in the Piccinotti sample. Although the BATSE sensitivity for individual source measurements is relatively poor on short time scales, the near all-sky coverage and long CGRO lifetime allows us to improve our sensitivity considerably by sumrr~ng data over many years. This significantly reduces our statistical errors at the expense of loss of temporal information. However, the systematic errors associated with the summation of data over such a long period are not negligible, and the study of systematic effects was a major part of our effort. We evaluated two types of systematic error: those affecting the overall normalization (which are important for comparison with other instruments) and those affecting the size of the fluctuations (which are relevant for estimating the confidence level of a detection). The former was studied by comparison of BATSE data with other instruments, primarily CGRO/OSSE. The results indicate that our absolute flux values maybe overestimated by as much as 35 % for some sources. However, since this does not affect our estimation of the detection confidence, we made no corrections to our flux estimates...|$|E

40|$|We {{have used}} XMM-Newton to observe six Lyman break analogs (LBAs) : {{members of the}} rare {{population}} of local galaxies that have properties that {{are very similar to}} distant Lyman break galaxies. Our six targets were specifically selected because they have optical emission-line properties that are intermediate between starbursts and Type 2 (obscured) active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Our new X-ray data provide an important diagnostic of the presence of an AGN. We find X-ray luminosities of order 10 (sup 42) <b>erg</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> and ratios of X-ray to far-IR lummositles that are higher than values in pure starburst galaxies by factors ranging from approximately 3 to 30. This strongly suggests the presence of an AGN in {{at least some of the}} galaxies. The ratios of the luminosities of the hard (2 - 10 keV) X-ray to [O III] emission line are low by about an order of magnitude compared with Type 1 AGN, but are consistent with the broad range seen in Type 2 AGN. Either the AGN hard X-rays are significantly obscured or the [O III] emission is dominated by the starburst. We searched for an iron emission line at approximately 6. 4 ke V, which is a key feature of obscured AGNs, but only detected emission at the approximately 2 sigma level. Finally, we find that the ratios of the mid-infrared (24 micrometer) continuum to [O III]lambda 5007 luminosities in these LBAs are higher than the values for Type 2 AGN by an average of 0. 8 dex. Combining all these clues, we conclude that an AGN is likely to be present, but that the bolometric luminosity is produced primarily by an intense starburst. If these black holes are radiating at the Eddington limit, their masses would lie in the range of 10 (sup 5) - 10 (sup 6) solar mass.

SNR G 359. 1 - 0. 5 was accepted as a Category C target {{and has not been}} observed. The Mouse was observed on April 27, 2003 for 52 ks. The image analysis has shown that the Mouse is extended in the East-West direction, possibly along the direction of the pulsar's proper motion. The spectrum of this pulsar wind nebula can be described as an absorbed power law with the photon index GAMMA = 1. 9 plus or minus 0. 1, effective hydrogen column density n(sub H) = (2. 6 plus or minus 0. 1) x 10 (exp 22) per square centimeter, and flux F = 1. 8 x 10 (exp - 11) erg per square centimeter per second in the 1 - 10 keV energy range.

The latter of these objects showed a Type I X-ray burst during our observation, with a rise time of 5 s and decay time of 60 s. A very strong pileup during the burst made the analysis of the burst properties unreliable. The spectral analysis of the persistent radiation from SLX 1744 - 299 and 1744 - 300 yields the hydrogen column densities of 3. 2 plus or minus 0. 1 and (3. 6 plus or minus 0. 2) x 10 (exp 22) per square centimeter, respectively, which suggests that the sources are close to the Galactic center (d = 8 - 9 kpc).

During the quasar phase, a huge luminosity is released as matter falls onto the black hole, and radiation-driven winds can transfer most of this energy back to the host galaxy. Over five different epochs, we detected the signatures of a nearly spherical stream of highly ionized gas in the broadband x-ray spectra of the luminous quasar PDS 456. This persistent wind is expelled at relativistic speeds from the inner accretion disk, and its wide aperture suggests an effective coupling with the ambient gas.

40|$|Super-luminous supernovae that radiate {{more than}} 10 ^ 44 <b>ergs</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> {{at their peak}} {{luminosity}} have recently been discovered in faint galaxies at redshifts of 0. 1 - 4. Some evolve slowly, resembling models of 'pair-instability' supernovae. Such models involve stars with original masses 140 - 260 {{times that of the}} Sun that now have carbon-oxygen cores of 65 - 30 solar masses. In these stars, the photons that prevent gravitational collapse are converted to electron-positron pairs, causing rapid contraction and thermonuclear explosions. Many solar masses of 56 Ni are synthesized; this isotope decays to 56 Fe via 56 Co, powering bright light curves. Such massive progenitors are expected to have formed from metal-poor gas in the early Universe. Recently, supernova 2007 bi in a galaxy at redshift 0. 127 (about 12 billion years after the Big Bang) with a metallicity one-third that of the Sun was observed to look like a fading pair-instability supernova. Here we report observations of two slow-to-fade super-luminous supernovae that show relatively fast rise times and blue colours, which are incompatible with pair-instability models. Their late-time light-curve and spectral similarities to supernova 2007 bi call the nature of that event into question. Our early spectra closely resemble typical fast-declining super-luminous supernovae, which are not powered by radioactivity. Modelling our observations with 10 - 16 solar masses of magnetar-energized ejecta demonstrates the possibility of a common explosion mechanism. The lack of unambiguous nearby pair-instability events suggests that their local rate of occurrence is less than 6 x 10 ^- 6 times that of the core-collapse rate.

Combined with the archival data, we now have broadband observations of this remarkable source from six separate epochs. Two of these new observations probe lower fluxes than seen previously, allowing us to extend {{our knowledge of the}} broadband spectral variability exhibited. The spectra are well fit by two thermal blackbody components that dominate the emission below 10 kiloelectronvolts, as well as a steep (Gamma approximately equal to 3. 5) power-law tail thatdominates above approximately 15 kiloelectronvolts. Remarkably, while the 0. 3 - 10. 0 kiloelectronvolts flux varies by a factor of approximately 3 between all these epochs, the 15 - 40 kiloelectronvolts flux varies by only approximately 20 percent. Although the spectral variability is strongest in the approximately 1 - 10 kiloelectronvolts band, both of the thermal components are required to vary when all epochs are considered. We also revisit the search for iron absorption features by leveraging the high-energy NuSTAR data to improve our sensitivity to extreme velocity outflows in light of the ultra-fast outflow recently detected in NGC 1313 X- 1. Iron absorption from a similar outflow along our line of sight can be ruled out in this case. We discuss these results in the context of super-Eddington accretion models that invoke a funnel-like geometry for the inner flow, and propose a scenario in which we have an almost face-on view of a funnel that expands to larger radii with increasing flux, resulting in an increasing degree of geometrical collimation for the emission from intermediate-temperature regions...|$|R
40|$|Observations of {{luminous}} flares {{resulting from}} the possible tidal disruption of stars by supermassive black holes have raised a number of puzzles. Outstanding questions include {{the origin of the}} optical and ultraviolet (UV) flux, the weakness of hydrogen lines in the spectrum, and the occasional simultaneous observation of x-rays. Here we study the emission from tidal disruption events (TDEs) produced as radiation from black hole accretion propagates through an extended, optically thick envelope formed from stellar debris. We analytically describe key physics controlling spectrum formation, and present detailed radiative transfer calculations that model the spectral energy distribution (SED) and optical line strengths of TDEs near peak brightness. The steady-state transfer is coupled to a non local thermodynamic equilibrium treatment of the excitation and ionization states of hydrogen, helium and oxygen (as a representative metal). Our calculations show how an extended envelope can reprocess a fraction of soft x-rays and produce the observed optical fluxes of order 10 ^ 43 <b>ergs</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> Variations in the mass or size of the envelope may help explain how the optical flux changes over time with roughly constant color. For high enough accretion luminosities, x-rays can highly ionize the reprocessing region and escape to be observed simultaneously with the optical flux, producing an SED not described by a single blackbody. Due to optical depth effects, hydrogen Balmer line emission is often strongly suppressed relative to helium line emission (with HeII-to-H line ratios of at least 5 : 1 in some cases) even in the disruption of a solar-composition star. We discuss the implications of our results to understanding the type of stars destroyed in TDEs and the physical processes responsible for producing the observed flares.

Source positions, X-ray luminosities, and spectral and timing characteristics are tabulated. Statistical comparisons between these X-ray properties {{and those of}} the weaker discrete sources in the same fields (mainly neutron star and stellar-mass black hole binaries) are made. Sources above approximately le 38 <b>ergs</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> display similar spatial, spectral, color, and variability distributions. In particular, there is no compelling evidence in the sample for a new and distinct class of X-ray object such as the intermediate-mass black holes. 83 % of ULX candidates have spectra that can be described as absorbed power laws with index = 1. 74 and column density = 2. 24 e 21 l per square centimeter, or approximately 5 times the average Galactic column. About 20 % of the ULX's have much steeper indices indicative of a soft, and likely thermal, spectrum. The locations of ULXs in their host galaxies are strongly peaked towards their galaxy centers. The deprojected radial distribution of the ULX candidates is somewhat steeper than an exponential disk, indistinguishable from that of the weaker sources. About 5 [...] 15 % of ULX candidates are variable during the Chandra observations (which average 39. 5 ks). Comparison of the cumulative X-ray luminosity functions of the ULXs to Chandra Deep Field results suggests approximately 25 % of the sources may be background objects including 14 % of the ULX candidates in the sample of spiral galaxies and 44 % of those in elliptical galaxies implying the elliptical galaxy ULX population is severely compromised by background active galactic nuclei. Correlations with host galaxy properties confirm the number and total X-ray luminosity of the ULXs are associated with recent star formation and with galaxy merging and interactions. The preponderance of ULXs in star-forming galaxies as well as their similarities to less-luminous sources suggest they originate in a young but short-lived population such as the high-mass X-ray binaries with a smaller contribution (based on spectral slope) from recent supernovae. The number of ULXs in elliptical galaxies scales with host galaxy mass and can be explained most simply as the high-luminosity end of the low-mass X-ray binary population...|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of the Chandra Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) observation of the intracluster gas associated with the cluster of galaxies surrounding Cygnus A. The dominant gaseous structure is a roughly elliptical (presumably prolate spheroidal in three dimensions) feature with semimajor axis approximately equal to 1. (prime) 1 (approximately equal to 100 kpc). This structure apparently represents intracluster gas that has been swept up and compressed by a cavity inflated in this gas by relativistic material that has passed through the ends of the radio jets. The X-ray-emitting gas shows this prolate spheroidal morphology to approximately equal to 1. (prime) 2 (110 kpc) from the radio galaxy but is spherical on larger scales. The X-ray emission from the intracluster gas extends to at least 8 prime (approximately equal to 720 kpc) from the radio galaxy, and a second, extended source of X-ray emission (probably associated with a second cluster of galaxies) is seen some 12 prime (approximately equal to 1 Mpc) to the northwest of Cygnus A. The X-ray spectrum of the integrated intracluster gas imaged on the S 3 chip (dimensions 8 prime x 8 prime = 720 x 720 kpc), excluding the contribution from the radio galaxy and other compact sources of X-ray emission, has a gas temperature, metallicity, and unabsorbed 2 - 10 keV rest-frame luminosity of 7. 7 keV, 0. 34 times solar, and 3. 5 x 10 (exp 44) <b>ergs</b> <b>per</b> <b>second,</b> respectively. We have projected the X-ray spectra taken from 12 elliptical and circular annuli in order to derive a run of temperature, metallicity, density, and pressure as a function of radius. The temperature of the X-ray-emitting gas drops from approximately equal to 8 keV more than 100 kpc from the center to approximately equal to 5 keV some 80 kpc from the center, with the coolest gas immediately adjacent to the radio galaxy. "Belts" of slightly cooler (approximately equal to 4 keV) X-ray-emitting gas run around the minor dimension of the cavity created by the radio source, while the limb-brightened edges of the cavity are slightly hotter (approximately equal to 6 keV), perhaps as a result of heating by a bow shock driven by the probably expanding cavity into the intracluster gas. There is a metallicity gradient in the X-ray-emitting gas, with the highest metallicities (approximately solar) found close to the center, decreasing to approximately 0. 3 times solar in the outer parts. We have used the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium to derive a total cluster mass within 500 kpc of 2. 0 x 10 (exp 14) solar mass and 2. 8 x 10 (exp 14) solar mass for constant and centrally decreasing temperature profiles, respectively. The total mass of X-ray-emitting gas within the same radius is 1. 1 x 10 (exp 13) solar mass.
