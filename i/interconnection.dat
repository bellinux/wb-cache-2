5|$|Across North America, {{electricity}} transmission systems are interconnected into wide area synchronous grids, or interconnections. Suppliers are legally required to follow reliability standards. In 2006, Québec's transmission system {{was recognized by}} the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) as a full <b>interconnection</b> because it is asynchronous with neighboring systems. Québec will consequently {{be able to develop}} its own reliability standards, as needed, and these will apply in addition to the relevant North American standards. Besides the Quebec <b>Interconnection,</b> there are three other interconnections in North America: the Eastern <b>Interconnection,</b> the Western <b>Interconnection,</b> and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.|$|E

40|$|II As an {{alternative}} to electrical <b>interconnections,</b> optical <b>interconnections</b> are being investigated for digital systems that require high speed, density, and connectivity. In particular, diode-laser-based optical <b>interconnections</b> with high optoelectronic conversion efficiencies promise simple <b>interconnections</b> that can operate even at gigahertz. rates. Optical modules in which critical alignments have been performed during module assembly can reduce module placement requirements from micrometers to millimeters. Such modules can also {{eliminate the need for}} micropositioners in digital systems.

40|$|To {{achieve the}} maximum beam {{energy in the}} LHC the {{accumulated}} length of spatial zones, dedicated to the <b>interconnections</b> between the main cryomagnets, has been limited to 3 % of the total magnetic length in the Arcs and Dispersion Suppressors. Such a low ratio leads to a very compact design of systems and subsystems situated in the LHC <b>interconnections.</b> The requirements concerning reliability of the LHC <b>interconnections</b> are very tight since {{the availability of the}} collider for physics cannot be compromised. The failure modes taken into account in the LHC <b>interconnections</b> are grouped into 4 categories: material failures, structural failures, fatigue failures and electrical failures.

The nonlinear behaviour of active components {{and their ability}} to control electron flows makes amplification of weak signals possible and electronics is widely used in information processing, telecommunications, and signal processing.

40|$|The {{advances}} in electrophysiological methods have allowed registering the joint activity of single neurons. Thus, studies on functional dynamics of complex-valued neural networks and its information processing mechanism have been conducted.

Here, we proposed a factor analysis to identify functional <b>interconnections</b> among neurons via spike trains.

40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} party {{ideologies}} {{are made up}} of a series of issues that vary in the extent of their <b>interconnections.</b> This approach to party programmes builds on Converse's (1964) description of belief systems and on Downs' (1957) understanding of ideologies. The concept of policy <b>interconnections,</b> originally applied to voter preferences, {{can also be used to}} understand party ideologies. In fact, parties are likely to exhibit stronger <b>interconnections</b> than voters. The strength, nature and effect of policy <b>interconnections</b> are examined for 23 Western European and English-speaking democracies using two expert surveys and the dataset of the Comparative Manifesto Project. Three distinctions need to be made in order to understand how party policies are interconnected. First, linkages between issues are based either on an inherent logic or on historical and sociological circumstance. Logic-based <b>interconnections</b> are more consistent across contexts than circumstance-based <b>interconnections.</b> Moreover, parties are more likely to alter policy stances on two areas simultaneously if the issues are linked through logic. Second, linkages exist for position and salience, but salience <b>interconnections</b> are weaker than their positional counterparts. This helps explain the strategic attraction of salience manipulation. Finally, positions can be more extreme or more moderate than the overall mean party preferences, a characteristic termed the 'degree of unusualness'. Parties are likely to stress such unusual positions, especially if they are small, niche competitors. The findings of this thesis have important implications for the study of party competition. For example, strategies such as vote-maximization and salience manipulation are directly affected by the impact of policy <b>interconnections.</b> This approach therefore significantly extends existing spatial models of party competition and challenges some of their assumptions. As <b>interconnections</b> influence voter choice and coalition formation, there are also broader implications for political representation...|$|R

40|$|This study {{into the}} nature of the mind, body, and spirit aimed to enhance {{psychological}} understandings of the holistic nature of human beings. There is a focus in mainstream psychology on the biomedical model, which has a limited view of people, of health and illness. The biopsychosocial and biopsychosocialspiritual models of health and illness, and the Whare Tapa Wha and Te Wheke Māori cultural models encompass holism but there is little literature or research specifically on MBS <b>interconnections.</b> Due to the difficulty of studying the mind, body, spirit according to scientific assumptions and methods, the <b>interconnections</b> between these three elements were explored through spiritual healers' understandings of spiritual healing practices. There were twelve participants, six indigenous Māori and six non-indigenous spiritual healers who participated in semi-structured interviews. The data was analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis techniques. Three specific questions about mind, body, and spirit <b>interconnections</b> conceptualisations were studied. The first research question focused on how spiritual healers conceptualise mind, body, spirit <b>interconnections.</b> The second research question considered how mind, body, spirit <b>interconnections</b> are understood by spiritual healers practices of spiritual healing. The last research question examined how a Māori cultural worldview influences spiritual healers' understandings of <b>interconnections</b> between the mind, body, and spirit. The diversity of mind, body, spirit <b>interconnections</b> broadened and expanded on the sparse definitions in the literature by showing the use of the mind, body, spirit as both separate and combined elements. There were illustrations of the theoretical and practical use of mind, body, spirit <b>interconnections</b> in healing and in life. Cultural perspectives influenced and impacted on views of the mind, body, spirit with the addition of whānau and whenua to the mind, body, spirit concept that was considered culturally appropriate. The results provided a much broader picture than traditional models of health and illness, and showed further definitions and understandings of MBS <b>interconnections.</b> It is concluded that it is important that Māori cultural meanings of health and illness are included in the New Zealand health system...|$|R
5|$|Because grid {{computing}} systems (described below) {{can easily}} handle embarrassingly parallel problems, modern clusters are typically {{designed to handle}} more difficult problems—problems that require nodes to share intermediate results with each other more often. This requires a high bandwidth and, more importantly, a low-latency <b>interconnection</b> network. Many historic and current supercomputers use customized high-performance network hardware specifically designed for cluster computing, such as the Cray Gemini network. As of 2014, most current supercomputers use some off-the-shelf standard network hardware, often Myrinet, InfiniBand, or Gigabit Ethernet.|$|E

Thus Sabah has start to exploring alternative ways to generate electricity with the usage of renewable energy such as solar, mini hydro, biomass, geothermal and micro-algae and tidal technologies. The Japanese government has extended aid totalling RM172,190.93 for the solar electrification project in the island of Larapan in Sabah's east coast in 2010. In 2016, Malaysia's first geothermal plant was started to be developed in Tawau to boost electricity in the east coast after a research by United States GeothermEx Inc. and Jacobs New Zealand indicated the existence of an active geothermal system centred around the flanks of Mount Maria on Apas Kiri. A South Korean company GS Caltex also sets to built Malaysia's first bio-butanol plant in the state.|$|E

40|$|Platelets in a dilute {{platelet-rich plasma}} clot {{formed by the}} {{addition}} of thrombin at 4 C do not lose their alpha-granules or develop platelet-fibrin <b>interconnections.</b> These clots do not retract or lyse. If after clot formation for 30 minutes the clots are transferred to 37 C, the alpha-granules then disappear from the platelet, extensive platelet-fibrin <b>interconnections</b> develop, and the clots retract and lyse. When the dilute plasma clots, however, are formed at 37 C, alpha-granules are quickly lost, few platelet-fibrin <b>interconnections</b> develop, and the clots do not retract or lyse. Deoxyglucose and antimycin, when added before thrombin at 4 C, prevent the loss of alpha-granules and development of platelet-fibrin <b>interconnections</b> after transfer of the clot to 37 C. These inhibited platelets did not retract or lyse. From the results reported here we conclude that the development of platelet-fibrin <b>interconnections</b> as well as the retraction and lysis of the clot occur in conjunction with the release of alpha-granules from the platelet. It may be necessary for this release to occur after the fibrin network is completed, since release of the alpha-granules in the 37 C clot before clot formation did not result in formation of many platelet-fibrin <b>interconnections</b> or in clot retraction or lysis...|$|R

5|$|A {{wind energy}} {{penetration}} figure {{can be specified}} for different duration of time, but is often quoted annually. To obtain 100% from wind annually requires substantial long term storage or substantial <b>interconnection</b> to other systems which may already have substantial storage. On a monthly, weekly, daily, or hourly basis—or less—wind might supply as much as or more than 100% of current use, with the rest stored or exported. Seasonal industry might then take advantage of high wind and low usage times such as at night when wind output can exceed normal demand. Such industry might include production of silicon, aluminum, steel, or of natural gas, and hydrogen, and using future long term storage to facilitate 100% energy from variable renewable energy. Homes can also be programmed to accept extra electric power on demand, for example by remotely turning up water heater thermostats.|$|E
5|$|Electric power {{generated}} from wind {{power can be}} highly variable at several different timescales: hourly, daily, or seasonally. Annual variation also exists, but is not as significant. Because instantaneous electrical generation and consumption must remain in balance to maintain grid stability, this variability can present substantial challenges to incorporating large amounts of wind power into a grid system. Intermittency and the non-dispatchable nature of wind energy production can raise costs for regulation, incremental operating reserve, and (at high penetration levels) could require {{an increase in the}} already existing energy demand management, load shedding, storage solutions or system <b>interconnection</b> with HVDC cables. The variability of wind is quite different from solar, wind may be producing power at night when other baseload plants are often overproducing.|$|E
