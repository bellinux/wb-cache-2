2500|$|Early in 1982, Rover {{unveiled}} the Cowley-built, facelifted {{line to the}} public. These cars benefited mostly from small cosmetic changes on the exterior {{as well as a}} quite extensively redesigned interior. Car spotters can distinguish the two series by the headlights, which were chrome-rimmed and flush fitting on the later, recessed on the earlier series, the deeper rear window, now fitted with a rear wash wipe, and the new plastic wrap around bumpers which replaced the three-piece rubber and stainless steel ones. Other details, which are not as easy to assign include the full-width rear badge strip under the tail lights, engine size badges on front wings, and a range of new wheel trims and alloy wheels. [...] The automatic gearbox was now a GM180 model, still offering three speeds but better ratios. [...] The <b>electric</b> <b>window</b> switch pack moved from the centre console to the driver's door (and is well remembered for lacking edge finishing trim around the recesses), and a fully automatic choke appeared – eliminating the manual choke lever which had a tendency to break.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{cars have}} at least one [...] "dome light" [...] (or [...] "courtesy light") located in or near the ceiling of the {{passenger}} compartment, to provide illumination by which to fasten seatbelts and enter or exit the car. These often have an option to switch on when the front (or any) passenger doors are opened. Many vehicles have expanded this feature, causing the overhead interior light to remain on after all doors are closed, allowing passengers to fasten seat belts with added illumination. The extended lighting cycle usually ends when the vehicle's ignition has begun, or a gradual reduction in light emitted after a couple of minutes if the car isn't started, called [...] "theater" [...] lighting. Interior lighting has been added on some vehicles at the bottom edge of the dashboard, which illuminates the floor for front passengers, or underneath the front seats at the rear, to illuminate the floor for rear seat passengers. This type of convenience lighting approach is also sometimes used to illuminate interior or exterior door handles, exterior step running boards, or <b>electric</b> <b>window</b> switches.|$|E
5000|$|... climate control, {{volume control}} and <b>electric</b> <b>window</b> {{switches}} are relocated to a wood veneer {{panel in the}} door ...|$|E
5000|$|ST with <b>electric</b> <b>windows,</b> <b>electric</b> mirrors, central locking, carpet interior, AC, {{automatic}} locking hubs.|$|R
50|$|The GAZ-233001 has {{optional}} air conditioning, stereo, <b>electric</b> <b>windows,</b> and an {{anti-lock braking}} system.|$|R
5000|$|Full power <b>electric</b> <b>windows</b> and {{metallic}} paint standard on Berlina and Calais but optional on all other models ...|$|R
50|$|The Trend & Fun {{specification}} {{offers a}} maximum approach angle of 18 degrees. Features include six airbags, ESP, Trailer Stability Program {{integrated with the}} ESP, Isofix child seat anchorages on the rear bench and electronic parking brake with auto hold function, RCD 210 radio with integrated CD player, semi-automatic climate control system, four <b>electric</b> <b>window</b> lifts, electrically adjustable and heated outside mirrors, trip computer, RF remote control of central locking and various storage compartments and bins.|$|E
5000|$|The Zodiac Mark IV and [...] "Executive" [...] {{had four}} {{headlights}} and an uprated [...] V6 engine. Claimed output was 140 bhp 'net' at 4,750 rpm, with [...] of torque at 3,000 rpm. [...] The Zodiac featured an alternator {{instead of a}} dynamo on the Zephyr, an adjustable steering column, a spare wheel in the engine compartment, a heater and Aeroflow ventilation, <b>electric</b> <b>window</b> washers, 2-speed wipers, a cigar lighter, rev counter, clock, ammeter, and reversing lights as standard.|$|E
50|$|Hayes did {{not give}} up, however, and {{continued}} his passionate internal marketing of the project. As prototypes started to emerge, dealers were invited to test drive sessions, and this increased the enthusiasm for the new car. In addition, Ford took some radical measures to reduce the price on the car. As an example, the car was only offered in three exterior colours (black, white and moonstone blue) and one interior colour (grey). There were also just two equipment options: with or without central locking and <b>electric</b> <b>window</b> lifts.|$|E
50|$|The better {{equipped}} version Flair featured power steering, <b>electric</b> <b>windows,</b> air conditioning, central locking, tachometer and side impact beams.|$|R
50|$|The basic Actual has black bumpers, lacks <b>electric</b> <b>windows</b> and a {{full-size}} spare wheel. The Actual {{was introduced in}} January 2004.|$|R
50|$|Positioned {{below the}} Calais, an {{upmarket}} model badged Commodore Royale was sold exclusively in New Zealand, available with both four- and six-cylinder engines. The luxury options included with this was air conditioning, <b>electric</b> <b>windows,</b> <b>electric</b> mirrors and a five-speed manual transmission.|$|R
5000|$|As did all GM B-Body wagons, the Safari and Grand Safari {{received}} GM's new clamshell tailgate. Operated by {{switches on}} the instrument panel or a key switch on the rear quarter panel, the tailgate slid into a recess under the cargo floor while the <b>electric</b> <b>window</b> slid upward into the rear roof section. Pontiac boasted the new system {{made it easier to}} load and unload the wagon in tight spaces, but the [...] "Glide-Away" [...] tailgate was prone to electrical and mechanical problems, and water and air leakage problems, as the cars aged.|$|E
50|$|Like {{most of the}} Henry Huggins books, the {{incidents}} in this book follow an ongoing plot line. In it, the Hugginses have a new car, and go out shopping; Ribsy, denied a ride, chases it at up to 25 miles per hour, and is finally allowed in. At the mall, he is left in it, and lowers the <b>electric</b> <b>window</b> with the button. He eventually wants to return to await Henry, and gets into the first new-smelling car he finds. But a different family, with several daughters and a son, gets in and takes him home with them. He endures a bubble bath and escapes, wandering in search of Henry.|$|E
50|$|As of February 1976, {{the engine}} was {{upgraded}} to the EK21 four-stroke water-cooled version introduced in the Rex to reduce emissions. This model saw the introduction of an <b>electric</b> <b>window</b> washer pump to improve driver visibility. Because of regulations changes, only three months later {{the engine was}} again upgraded with a 490 cc displacement (EK22) engine of a similar layout for the Sambar 5 (K75 truck, K76 panel van, K85 van). This was naturally sold as the Subaru 500 in export markets. This was in turn soon replaced by a full 550 cc (EK23) model, the K77/87 of March 1977. In export, the Sambar 550 {{was known as the}} Subaru 600 and later as the Subaru 700, with a 665 cc version of the EK engine.|$|E
50|$|Inside: 2 <b>electric</b> <b>windows,</b> <b>electric</b> mirrors (few models manuals mirrors!). This {{trim level}} offers {{all the same}} management, remote central Reverse Lock (infrared). The {{upholstery}} fabric, the less cosy than the upper armrest release. Lack of air conditioning, dual zone heating series.|$|R
50|$|Other {{optional}} equipment includes keyless entry, dual airbags, speed-sensitive central locking, engine immobilizer and alarm, <b>electric</b> <b>windows,</b> child safety door locks and tray liner.|$|R
2500|$|Ti: 2.4L manual or auto, {{as above}} plus limited slip differential, cruise control, climate control, central locking, <b>electric</b> <b>windows,</b> graphic equaliser, fog lamps, alloy wheels ...|$|R
5000|$|A 1.0-litre twin-cam fuel {{injected}} intercooled turbo (CB70/CB80), named GTti and delivering [...] JIS was later added, only {{available as a}} three-door hatch. Fuel injected versions of the 1.3-litre four-cylinder (HC-E) and three-cylinder (CB90) were later added. A four-door sedan was released with the 1.3-litre EFI engine in 1988. There were two different sport models available (both with G100S-FMVZ model codes), the GTti and the GTxx. Both versions are mechanically identical, but the GTxx features many added luxury items. These include full bodykit, lightweight 14-inch speedline alloys, air-conditioning, power steering, one-touch <b>electric</b> <b>window</b> down, and electric sunroof. Some of these options were also available to buy as optional extras on the GTti. Side-skirts were also fitted to many GTtis, but in some countries they were only sold as a dealer optional extra. The Charade GTti was the first production car to produce [...] per liter and the fastest 1.0-liter car produced.|$|E
50|$|The Streetwise {{offered a}} choice of sporty interiors, {{available}} in four or five seats (optional). The standard four seats had two separate rear seats and a separating centre console, and were half leather body-hugging seats. All models came with standard front electric windows, driver's airbag, PAS, and ABS. The S & SE models came with leather steering wheel, gear knob and air conditioning. The <b>electric</b> <b>window</b> switch had been relocated next to the handbrake, with new-style rocker switch, in a circular design with chrome effect plastic in the middle. Other subtle changes included a riveted chrome effect plastic loop round {{the base of the}} gear lever, and a restyled blue dash dials. All Streetwises came with trafficmaster, an early warning device to warn the drivers of congested routes, and CD player as standard. The Streetwise also came with rear parking sensors, as an option or as standard on higher models.|$|E
50|$|Nearly every {{model was}} {{redesigned}} for 1948, including the $3,820 Sixty Special. With all-new sheet metal, but still riding an exclusive 133-inch wheelbase, the luxurious Sixty Special weighed in at 4,370 pounds shipping weight (over 4,500 pounds curb weight). Inside, <b>electric</b> <b>window</b> lifts and a two-way power bench seat were standard equipment. A clever rainbow-shaped instrument cluster which {{put all the}} gauges directly above the steering column {{in front of the}} driver was used for 1948 only, while a new curved dashboard design added to passenger roominess. The roof-mounted decorative chrome louvers and individually framed side door glass (a Sixty Special design element since 1938) were carried over to this latest model as well. With trim inspired by the Lockheed P-38 Lightning, the new Sixty Special featured simulated side-scoops and curious tail-fins - resembling the P-38's vertical stabilizers. Its appearance is similar to cross-town rival Chrysler Imperial and the Chrysler New Yorker initially in 1949, and less so with yearly appearance changes.|$|E
50|$|Executive: The base model, {{although}} {{even this}} {{had a high}} level of specification including <b>electric</b> <b>windows,</b> ABS, PAS as well as an alarm and immobiliser.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} specification of the V8S included ½ hide leather interior, walnut trim, mohair hood, OZ alloy wheels, driving lamps, <b>electric</b> <b>windows</b> and door mirrors.|$|R
50|$|The 1987 Carrera Club Sport, {{of which}} 340 were produced, is a {{collectible}} 911 {{that had a}} blueprinted engine with a higher rev limit, and had the <b>electric</b> <b>windows,</b> <b>electric</b> seats, and radio removed to save a claimed 50 kg (110 lb) in weight.|$|R
50|$|It was facelifted in March 2002, {{gaining the}} new {{front end of}} the {{hatchback}} Clio, black moldings on the bumpers, slightly revised interior (<b>electric</b> <b>window</b> buttons moved from the central console onto the doors, the steering wheel got a new design) and improved safety levels. New engines were also added: a 1.5 liter diesel (65 hp, 160 Nm), and the 1.6 liter 16-valve petrol (105 hp, 148 Nm) in Europe, which was only available with the Dynamique trim level. Throughout the following years, two other versions of the dCi engine were featured in the range: the 65 hp version was upgraded to 70 hp (following the introduction of the Euro IV emission standards from January 2005) and a more powerful version of 80 hp and 185 Nm (in the second half of 2004). A new 1.2 liter 16-valve engine (75 hp, 105 Nm) was introduced the first half of 2006. An automatic transmission version was available, but only with the 1.4 16-valve petrol engine.|$|E
50|$|The new {{front end}} was adopted in South America from 2003. In Brazil two engines were adapted {{to run with}} flexible-fuel: the 1.0 liter 16-valve (76 hp on petrol, 77 hp on alcohol) and the 1.6 liter 16-valve (110 hp on petrol, 115 hp on alcohol); while in Argentina a CNG version was {{introduced}} {{towards the end of}} the year. The interior of the pre-facelifted model was kept in the South American facelift version. In Colombia, it was added the automatic transmission in 2004 to the Symbol Expression, and the new interior of the facelift model was added in 2008, with some differences from the European version, including the location of the <b>electric</b> <b>window</b> controls, the seats and the radio, and it kept the exterior of the phase II Symbol. The Alizé model included front electric windows and driver airbag; the Expression included electric mirrors, digital clock, passenger airbag, ABS and foglights. The 2008 model also included a 1.6 liter petrol engine, replacing the 1.4 liter one.|$|E

50|$|The aluminum-bodied car weighs only 542 kg with batteries. The car has normal options like: central locking, <b>electric</b> <b>windows</b> and mirrors, CD/MP3-player and 15-inch alloy wheels.|$|R
5000|$|... 1.6 Expression: It equips driver's airbag {{and front}} <b>electric</b> <b>windows.</b> It {{is powered by}} a 1.6 16 valve, 110 PS engine. Also equips a 5-speed manual gearbox.|$|R
5000|$|The Commodore Berlina [...] was {{the first}} of the luxury-oriented variants. Alloy wheels, <b>electric</b> <b>windows</b> and {{automatic}} transmission were standard fitment. Sedan and wagon variants were offered.|$|R
5000|$|Standard {{equipment}} {{on the stock}} McLaren F1 includes full cabin air conditioning, a rarity on most sports cars and a system design which Murray again credited to the Honda NSX, a car he had owned and driven himself for 7 years without, according to the official F1 website, ever needing to change the AC automatic setting. Further comfort features included SeKurit electric defrost/demist windscreen and side glass, <b>electric</b> <b>window</b> lifts, remote central locking, Kenwood 10-disc CD stereo system, cabin access release for opening panels, cabin storage compartment, four-lamp high performance headlight system, rear fog and reversing lights, courtesy lights in all compartments, map reading lights and a gold-plated Facom titanium tool kit and first aid kit (both stored in the car). In addition, tailored, proprietary luggage bags specially designed to fit the vehicle's carpeted storage compartments, including a tailored golf bag, were standard equipment. Airbags are not present in the car. [...] Each customer was given a special edition TAG Heuer 6000 Chronometer wristwatch with its serial number scripted below the centre stem.|$|E

50|$|The revolutionary {{new model}} Nance hoped for was delayed until 1955, {{partially}} because of Packard's merger with Studebaker. Packard stylist Richard A. Teague was called upon by Nance {{to design the}} 1955 line, and to Teague's credit, the 1955 Packard was indeed a sensation when it appeared. Not only was the body completely updated and modernized, but the suspension also was totally new, with torsion bars front and rear, along with an electric control that kept the car level regardless of load or road conditions. Crowning this stunning new design was Packard's brand new ultra-modern overhead-valve V8, displacing 352 cid L, replacing the old, heavy, cast-iron side-valve straight-eight {{that had been used}} for decades. In addition, Packard offered a variety of power, comfort, and convenience features, such as power steering and brakes as well as <b>electric</b> <b>window</b> lifts. But air conditioning was an anomaly. Although available on all makes by the mid-fifties, it was installed on only a handful of cars in 1955 and 1956 despite Packard's status as a luxury car. Model year sales only climbed back to 55,000 units in 1955, including Clipper, in what was a very strong year across the industry.|$|E
50|$|Power <b>windows</b> or <b>electric</b> <b>windows</b> are {{automobile}} windows {{which can}} be raised and lowered by pressing a button or switch, as opposed to using a hand-turned crank handle.|$|R
50|$|Available {{only as a}} Sedan, {{this had}} a higher level {{interior}} with tachometer instrumentation, <b>electric</b> <b>windows,</b> <b>electric</b> door locks, electric door mirrors, clock and wheel covers as standard. Engines were D15B2 16V SOHC, same as the DX, with 5-speed cable clutch transmission. 4- speed automatic transmission was optional.|$|R
50|$|The car {{featured}} interior refinements such as electric heated operated {{and cooled}} Recaro seats, electric windscreen demist with <b>electric</b> <b>windows</b> and mirrors, leather upholstery reversing camera and sat nav.|$|R
