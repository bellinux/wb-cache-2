25|$|NY214 {{became the}} subject of {{controversy}} for the conditions of the road through Lanesville and Greene County. The members of a committee of parents in Lanesville noted on December 2, 1946 that they would hold their students from going to school starting on January 6, 1947 if the state did not start work on repairing the road for safety. The committee noted that the conditions of NY214 were dangerous, with the road's pavement not being maintained for use of the school bus and guard rails were not installed to keep cars from going into waterways. The parents remained committed and held about 55 students out of school starting January 2, stating that nothing still had been done to maintain NY214. Burton Belknap, part of the State Education Department, stated that they intended to make sure they would work with the local parents in order to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> back in school. The student strike was lifted on January 13 on conditions that the town of Hunter made for repairing the road.|$|E

30|$|Rather {{than simply}} lecturing to <b>the</b> <b>student,</b> <b>the</b> tutor {{provides}} scaffolding for <b>the</b> <b>student</b> to articulate <b>the</b> expectations {{through a number}} of dialog moves. A pump is a generic expression to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> to provide more information, such as “What else?” or “Tell me more.” Hints and prompts are selected by <b>the</b> tutor to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> to articulate missing content words, phrases, and propositions. A hint tries to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> to express a lengthy constituent (e.g., proposition, clause, sentence), whereas a prompt is a question that tries to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> to express a single word or phrase. The tutor generates an assertion if <b>the</b> <b>student</b> fails to express the expectation after multiple hints and prompts. AutoTutor provides a cycle of pump → hint → prompt → assertion for each expectation until the expectation is covered. As <b>the</b> <b>student</b> and tutor express information over many turns, the list of expectations is eventually covered and the main task is completed.|$|R

One of his best-known techniques was to provide the beginning of a philosophically provocative story. He then recorded/transcribes student comments, put them in the mouths of characters in the story, and brought the story continuation to the next class session for further discussion. Such interactions are compiled in his book Dialogues With Children.|$|E

50|$|Out-of-work actor Charlie Moore {{began the}} first season as a {{substitute}} teacher, but warmed to the IHP class immediately, making it his mission {{to get them to}} think rather than merely to know.

By Episode Six, the class's original teacher Mr. Thomas (Roscoe Lee Browne) had retired, making Mr. Moore their full-time teacher. Throughout {{the first season}}, Mr. Moore attempted to get the class involved in more than just their studies, encouraging them to play volleyball and make a music video for the school's time capsule (this marks the first foray into the fondness of Head of the Class for musical production numbers). At the same time, the class brought Mr. Moore into the present, acclimating him to the importance of personal computers.
