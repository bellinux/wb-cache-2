5|$|After the election, Paul was speculated {{to run for}} {{president}} in 1992 but opted instead to work on the campaign <b>for</b> <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan.</b> That year, Marrou received the Libertarian presidential nomination. Paul later returned to the Republican Party and was re-elected to his seat in Congress in 1996, without much support from establishment Republicans, who supported the party-switching Democratic incumbent of the seat. Back in Congress, Paul regained his nickname of Dr. No, favoring a free market and advocating a reduction {{in the size of the}} federal government. He was drafted to challenge President George W. Bush in the 2004 Republican primaries, but chose not to run. He ran {{for president}} again in 2008 and 2012 as a Republican, attracting a large amount of grassroots support.|$|E

5000|$|The {{next day}} it was {{discovered}} that 'bad data' resulted in the carnage of the previous night. Due to the Bush margin of victory being less than 0.5% {{of the total number of}} votes cast, an automatic statewide machine recount was ordered. In Palm Beach County, a butterfly ballot was used to conduct the election in some precincts. On election day, voters intended to vote for Al Gore instead voted <b>for</b> <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan,</b> and the Reform Party ticket. Buchanan received 3,407 votes or 0.8% of the total compared to 0.29% of the total statewide. As a result, unwilling Buchanan voters in Palm Beach county reported votes for Gore in exit polling which resulted in flawed data. Palm Beach County's butterfly ballots ...|$|E
5000|$|Although Bush {{spokesman}} Ari Fleischer said on November 9 that [...] "Palm Beach County is a Pat Buchanan stronghold and that's why Pat Buchanan received 3,407 votes there", Buchanan's Florida coordinator, Jim McConnell, {{responded by}} calling that [...] "nonsense", and Jim Cunningham, {{chairman of the}} executive committee of Palm Beach County's Reform Party, responded, [...] "I don't think so. Not from where I'm sitting and what I'm looking at." [...] Cunningham estimated the number of Buchanan supporters in Palm Beach County to be between 400 and 500. Asked how many votes he would guess Buchanan legitimately received in Palm Beach County, he said, [...] "I think 1,000 would be generous. Do I believe that these people inadvertently cast their votes <b>for</b> <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan?</b> Yes, I do. We {{have to believe that}} based on the vote totals elsewhere." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{developed}} countries {{the family farm}} is viewed sentimentally, as a lifestyle to be preserved for tradition's sake, or as a [...] It is in these nations very often a political rallying cry against change in agricultural policy, most commonly in France, Japan, and the United States, where rural lifestyles are often regarded as desirable. In these countries, strange bedfellows can often be found arguing for similar measures despite otherwise vast differences in political ideology. <b>For</b> example, <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan</b> and Ralph Nader, both candidates {{for the office of}} President of the United States, held rural rallies together and spoke for measures to preserve the so-called family farm. On other economic matters they were seen as generally opposed, but found common ground on this one.|$|R
2500|$|Shortly {{thereafter}} Imus was suspended. Media commentators {{were divided}} on the suspension: on MSNBC's Scarborough Country on April 10, <b>for</b> example, <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan</b> said that Imus is [...] "a good guy... made a bad mistake and apologized for it" [...] and that the show should stay on the air. Comedian Bill Maher said that if a comedian apologizes for stepping over a line, that should suffice. Steve Adubato, an MSNBC media analyst, disagreed, saying that this incident was [...] "not isolated". Joe Klein made the same charge, referring to Imus's comment about New York Times reporter Gwen Ifill 14 years before as evidence of a pattern of offensive comments. On The View, Rosie O'Donnell spoke out in support of keeping Imus on the air on free speech grounds, while Emil Steiner of The Washington Post argued that Al Sharpton used the issue to further divide America along racial lines.|$|R

5000|$|In a move {{similar to}} his and Rothbard's support <b>for</b> <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan,</b> Lew Rockwell has been {{sympathetic}} to celebrity real estate mogul Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, particularly for his stance on Mexican immigration, along with Justin Raimondo, {{who voted for}} Trump {{on the basis of}} his foreign policy. In June 2016, Mercer published a book titled The Trump Revolution: The Donald’s Creative Destruction Deconstructed, arguing in the introduction that [...] "In the age of unconstitutional government—Democratic and Republican—the process of creative destruction begun by Trump can only increase the freedom quotient." [...] Austrian School anarcho-capitalist economist Walter Block, in a 2016 preelection debate with Reason.com editor Nick Gillespie, advised libertarians living in battleground states to support Trump rather than cast their votes for Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson, citing critical foreign policy differences between the Republican and Democratic frontrunners.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{voters in}} Palm Beach County who {{intended}} {{to vote for}} Gore actually marked their ballots <b>for</b> <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan</b> or spoiled their ballots because they found the ballot's layout to be confusing. The ballot displayed the list of presidential running-mate pairs alternately across two adjacent pages, with a column of punch spaces down the middle. Bush's name appeared {{at the top of}} the ballot, sparing most Bush voters from error. About 19,000 ballots were spoiled because of overvotes (two votes in the same race), compared to 3000 in 1996. According to a 2001 study in the American Political Science Review, the voting errors caused by the butterfly ballot cost Gore the election: [...] "Had PBC used a ballot format in the presidential race that did not lead to systematic biased voting errors, our findings suggest that, other things equal, Al Gore would have won a majority of the officially certified votes in Florida." ...|$|E
40|$|In November 2000, {{a poorly}} {{designed}} 'butterfly' ballot in Palm Beach County, Florida, of the United States of America, changed election history. Mostly African American and older voters {{believed that they}} had mistakenly voted <b>for</b> <b>Pat</b> <b>Buchanan</b> instead of Al Gore because they misread or misinterpreted the instructions on the ballot that had candidate names on both pages and punch-holes down the middle. While some institutions and individuals wrote reports and dissected {{the problems with the}} butterfly ballot, few people or groups sought to redesign the ballot. In 2001, AIGA Chicago chapter members developed an interdisciplinary group of information designers, industrial designers, and social researchers to understand and redesign the voting experience. This group became Design for Democracy, an organization that seeks to increase civic participation by making the experience clearer, understandable, easier to accomplish, and more trustworthy. Through partnerships between professionals and undergraduate students at University of Illinois at Chicago, over three years, the organization conducted ethnographically-based research and redesigned the election experience in Cook County Chicago, the Vote-By-Mail experience for the State of Oregon, and a get-out-the-vote campaign for culturally and linguistically disenfranchised voters in Chicago. This paper explores the role of research, particularly ethnographic research, in the interpretation of the 'meaning' of redesigned election artefacts within the discourses of American democracy following the 2000 Presidential election. In particular, it focuses on the shifting discourses of American democracy as framed by the contexts of American professional design and usability organizations, international museums, and American federal government officials. I argue that the research enables people to reframe the negative view of American politics following the November 2000 election to one of politics of inclusion, complexity, and transformation. This reframing has significant impact on individuals' and groups' perceptions of their active roles as potential positive change agents in civic life...|$|E
