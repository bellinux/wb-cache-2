[...] I don't think they're {{going to get married}} just to get married. As Arizona goes, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> incredible discipline and she does, as you said, have a very strict moral compass and marriage would not be something she would jump into without giving it a great amount of thought." [...] Discussing Robbins' relationship with Torres' former lover Sloan, Capshaw divulged: [...] "Whenever there's been a chance to play that I am intimidated by him or being standoffish, I've always chosen to make it very playful. It's much more Arizona's style to find it very amusing." ...|$|E

500|$|Ayane {{become a}} popular {{character}} among audience of both genders for various reasons. Model and actress Jaime Bergman chose the [...] "quick and bold" [...] Ayane as a Dead or Alive 2 character she would partner with. While awarding the Annual GameSpy E3 Award to Dead or Alive Ultimate in 2004, Raymond 'Psylancer' Padilla wrote, [...] "Ayane should be my new girlfriend." [...] He later elaborated: [...] "To be honest, I always thought Ayane was an uptight bitch with a massive chip on her shoulder. I always rooted for Kasumi in their feud. Then {{a funny thing happened}} when I saw the trailer for Dead or Alive Ultimate during E3 2004 -- I started to care about Ayane. Learning more about her story, her upbringing, and the root of her feud with Kasumi made me change sides." [...] Kotaku's Mike Fahey also described himself as [...] "more of an Ayane sort of guy." [...] In 2005, she was described as his favourite Dead or Alive character by James Mielke from 1UP.com.

500|$|Fink {{does not}} know how long her {{character}} will be featured on Glee. When asked about what she likes about her character, Fink said: [...] "I think what I love about Lauren is she's so strong and so confident and she knows what she wants and I feel very blessed to play a role model for people who have ever felt other or different. I remember how I used to feel watching TV and seeing Sara Rue on Popular because she was an inspiration to me. It's funny because what I love about Lauren is that she's unapologetic and she's confident and she's making Puck work for it and she's not just looking for a roll in the hay. I think that they are very sweet together, there is this vulnerability when they are both such bad asses and you put them together and I think there is something really special there. What I appreciate about Lauren is that she's like I don't need to give it to you, you're going to work for it, and I think that's a great message to send to young girls. I think that he is smitten and she is probably a little smitten too but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> enough self esteem not to give everything up for the charming cute boy that's kind of after her." [...] Kevin Fallon, a writer for The Atlantic, reacted favorably to the casting of Fink: [...] "Glee hit the trifecta this year with its three major cast additions. First there were Darren Criss—who's exploded with popularity—and Chord Overstreet. Now there's Ashley Fink's Lauren. And while the tough-only-on-the-outside Lauren can deliciously out-sass Santana Lopez, it's her straight-talking that really has me sold." ...|$|E

Jones {{explained his}} portrayal, [...] "The script {{refers to the}} angel as a her and that's what I do. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> feminine qualities, but she's not totally a woman either.

"She was so {{disillusioned with}} her church-her centre {{was going to}} the Lake Pedder, she mounted part of the vigil there on her own. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> come to the {{conclusion}} that if she gave her life for Lake Pedder that extreme sacrifice would move people.

6000|$|... "You {{should have}} seen what a rage he was in, when he took his first sip from the bottle, after we had started.
