5|$|After Ford {{left the}} White House in January 1977, the former President privately {{justified}} his pardon of Nixon by carrying <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>wallet</b> {{a portion of}} the text of Burdick v. United States, a 1915 U.S. Supreme Court decision which stated that a pardon indicated a presumption of guilt, and that acceptance of a pardon was tantamount to a confession of that guilt. In 2001, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation awarded the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award to Ford for his pardon of Nixon. In presenting the award to Ford, Senator Edward Kennedy said that he had initially been opposed to the pardon, but later decided that history had proved Ford to have made the correct decision.|$|E
5|$|Impressed, Johnson reveals to Homer that in 1945, President Harry S. Truman {{printed a}} one trillion-dollar bill to help {{reconstruct}} post-war Europe and enlisted Montgomery Burns {{to transport the}} bill. However, it never arrived and the FBI suspects Burns still has it with him. Homer is sent in to investigate. At the Burns estate, Homer searches for the bill before Burns, who believes Homer is a reporter from Collier's magazine, reveals that he kept it <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>wallet.</b> Johnson and Agent Miller burst in and arrest Burns. Burns shouts how the government oppresses the average American. Moved by Burns's speech, Homer knocks out the FBI agents and frees Burns.|$|E
5|$|On his person, {{they find}} a note <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>wallet</b> that {{eventually}} leads Scully and Mulder to conclude that it was Tessa, not Ruby, who was pregnant. Under interrogation, Tessa confesses to killing Greg but denies Ruby was at Lake Okobogee that night. Mulder and Scully return to the Morris' house, and, finding it deserted, discover the binary-covered pieces of paper laid out {{across the living room}} floor, forming an image of Ruby's face. The agents return to Lake Okobogee, where they find Darlene and Kevin in the nearby woods. A motorcycle gang appears, and as Mulder hurries to rescue Kevin from their wake, Scully discovers Ruby nearby.|$|E

60|$|Accordingly, the unresisting {{prisoner}} was led off, {{while he}} mechanically accepted and stored <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>wallets</b> the alms which poured in on every hand, and ere {{he left the}} hamlet, was as deep-laden as a government victualler. The labour of bearing this accumulating burden was, however, abridged, by the officer procuring a cart and horse to convey the old man to a magistrate, <b>in</b> order to <b>his</b> examination and committal.|$|R
50|$|On November 28, 1999, Skeid {{appeared}} at a Toronto hospital. Then probably <b>in</b> <b>his</b> mid-twenties, {{he appeared to}} have been the victim of a mugging. His nose was broken, and he was unable to walk. <b>In</b> addition, <b>his</b> <b>wallet</b> was missing, the tags had been removed from his clothing, and he carried no identification.|$|R
5|$|When {{the price}} {{elasticity}} {{of demand for}} a good is perfectly inelastic (Ed = 0), changes in the price do not affect the quantity demanded for the good; raising prices will always cause total revenue to increase. Goods necessary to survival can be classified here; a rational person {{will be willing to}} pay anything for a good if the alternative is death. For example, a person in the desert weak and dying of thirst would easily give all the money <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>wallet,</b> no matter how much, for a bottle of water if he would otherwise die. His demand is not contingent on the price.|$|E
25|$|Around {{midnight on}} August 16, 1996, {{following}} a day spent together drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana, 18-year-old Daryl Atkins and his accomplice, William Jones, {{walked to a}} nearby convenience store where they abducted Eric Nesbitt, an airman from nearby Langley Air Force Base. Unsatisfied with the $60 they found <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>wallet,</b> Atkins drove Nesbitt in his own vehicle to a nearby ATM and forced him to withdraw a further $200. In spite of Nesbitt's pleas, the two abductors then drove him to an isolated location, where he was shot eight times, killing him.|$|E
25|$|Jack Taylor's sister, Donna Taylor, {{recalled}} the Police coming round {{to inform the}} family they had discovered his body. She reported them simply, brashly stating 'Jack's dead', and going on to explain they found a syringe in his pocket, white powder <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>wallet</b> and needle marks on his arm. Donna was unhappy with this revelation, claiming that Jack was very anti-drugs. 11 days after Jack's death, Donna and her sister Jen contacted Barking Dagenham Police to get {{an update on the}} investigation, and were astonished to find out that there was not an investigation taking place, and Police were satisfied with the theory that Jack had sat down by himself and overdosed on drugs.|$|E

Burton.|$|R
25|$|Mallory's {{daughter}} said that Mallory carried {{a photograph of}} his wife on his person {{with the intention of}} leaving it on the summit. This photo was not found on Mallory's body. Given the excellent preservation of the body, its garments and other items including documents <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>wallet,</b> this points to the possibility that he may have reached the summit and deposited the photo there. On the other hand, Wang (who is known to have taken Mallory's ice-axe) might also have taken the photograph for identification purposes, and no one who has subsequently reached the summit has reported seeing any evidence of the photograph, or any other trace of their presence there.|$|E

25|$|During the journey, a phone begins ringing, but {{the group}} cannot work out whose it is. Ed {{believes}} the ringing {{is coming from the}} boot, so Chris pulls {{over to the side of}} the road. The group discover Sophie in the boot and try and work out what to do with her. Summer suggests that Chris takes her home, while Ed offers to call a taxi and go back with her. Andrew, desperate not to miss the concert, asks Chris to take her in the car, despite knowing that there is not a spare seatbelt. Chris reluctantly agrees and Sophie sits on Summer's lap. Summer asks what time The Jezabels are on stage and Andrew mentions that he wrote it down on his ticket, which is <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>wallet</b> inside Summer's bag. As Summer searches for the ticket, she finds the two cheques inside and asks Andrew about them. He tries to get his wallet back, but Summer discovers the cheques are worth $25,000 and Natasha realises he has sold the app.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} 1950, Hedayat left Iran for Paris. There, on 9 April 1951, he {{committed}} suicide by gassing himself in a small rented apartment on 37 Rue Championnet. He had plugged all the gaps in the windows and door with cotton and, so it would not burden anyone, he had placed the money (a hundred thousand francs) for his shroud and burial <b>in</b> <b>his</b> side <b>wallet</b> <b>in</b> plain view. He was buried at the division 85 of Père Lachaise Cemetery. His funeral was attended {{by a number of}} intimate friends and close acquaintances, both Iranian and French.The English poet John Heath-Stubbs published an elegy, 'A Cassida for Sadegh Hedayat', in A Charm Against the Toothache in 1954.|$|R

50|$|However, {{the next}} morning, Dahlmann {{was found dead}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{apartment}} by a servant, and <b>his</b> <b>wallet</b> was missing.

25|$|In Japanese culture, the boar {{is widely}} seen as a fearsome and {{reckless}} animal, {{to the point that}} several words and expressions in Japanese referring to recklessness include references to boars. The boar is the last animal of the oriental zodiac, with people born during the year of the Pig being said to embody the boar-like traits of determination and impetuosity. Among Japanese hunters, the boar's courage and defiance is a source of admiration, and {{it is not uncommon for}} hunters and mountain people to name their sons after the animal inoshishi (猪). Boars are also seen as symbols of fertility and prosperity; in some regions, it is thought that boars are drawn to fields owned by families including pregnant women, and hunters with pregnant wives are thought to have greater chances of success when boarhunting. The animal's link to prosperity was illustrated by its inclusion on the ¥10 note during the Meiji period, and it was once believed that a man could become wealthy by keeping a clump of boar hair <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>wallet.</b>|$|E
25|$|Nero Wolfe is {{approached}} by corporate attorney Rudolf Hansen and his clients Oliver Burr, Vernon Assa and Patrick O'Garro, the chief executives of Manhattan advertising agency Lipton Burr Assa (LBA). The group want Wolfe {{to save them}} from embarrassment and ruin following the murder of Louis Dahlmann, an up-and-coming advertising executive with the firm. Dahlmann's wallet was also stolen, and inside were the final answers {{for a series of}} cryptic poetic riddles run as part of a promotional competition for Pour Amour, a brand of perfume designed by one of LBA's clients. The first prize of the competition is $500,000, and in a meeting with the final five contestants the night before his death Dahlmann had revealed that he kept the answers <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>wallet,</b> both of which lead the police to suspect one of the contestants. The executives, however, do not want Wolfe to investigate the murder but to find out whole stole the wallet before the contest deadline—midnight of the nineteenth of April, exactly one week later—in order to ensure the integrity of proceedings and restore their reputation. Despite tension between the advertising agency and Talbott Heery, owner of the company that produces Pour Amour, Wolfe agrees to their terms.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, the boys' pet secret-agent platypus, Perry, {{breaks into}} the [...] of his foe, the evil Dr. Doofenshmirtz, only to {{discover}} that he is only putting a birthday party for his 16-year-old daughter Vanessa. Doofenshmirtz explains that he has been trying to give out the best birthday parties for her, but failed for some reasons, as she felt so extremely unhappy about her birthdays all her life (this was evident of several birthday photos that Doofenshmirtz shows to Perry <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>wallet).</b> Seeing this, Perry agrees to set aside his rivalry and help Doofenshmirtz prepare for the party.|$|E

50|$|At first, {{the player}} {{is limited to}} the section of the casino with the lowest maximum bets. As the player meets his {{monetary}} obligations through winning casino games, the player is transferred from room to room. Each room has its floor in different colors like royal blue and red. As the player moves up to a higher level floor, the maximum bets for the individual games found will increase. Slot machines that once had a denomination of $1 and $5 will become slot machines with denominations of $100 and $1000 as the player accumulates more money <b>in</b> <b>his</b> virtual <b>wallet.</b> A cashier can provide the player with passwords that will allow him to continue to game at a later date. Rooms eventually connect to each other after gaining a certain amount of money; allowing players with bad luck to rebuild their fortunes at the lower-risk games.|$|R

500|$|Another {{interview}} {{is with a}} Wichita, Kansas woman named Angie who was prostituted with another girl, Melissa, in the American Midwest when they were teenagers. Angie recounts how {{they were expected to}} have sex with truck drivers and steal their money. She describes an incident when, after Melissa found pictures of a man's grandchildren <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>wallet,</b> they realized he was old enough to be their own grandfather. [...] "I wanted to die," [...] she says, close to tears. Outside the film, Bilheimer said that Angie's trafficker expected her to engage in forty sex acts a night, and threatened to kill her if she refused. [...] "It's not just truck drivers," [...] FBI agent Mike Beaver says. [...] "We're seeing them purchased and abused by both white collar and blue collar individuals."

Johnson confirmed that he would star in the new Jumanji movie via his Instagram page. In an interview, Johnson also discussed the possibility of an earlier release date than was originally announced for the DC Extended Universe film, Shazam.

500|$|The {{facts of}} {{what took place}} in the store are still disputed. [...] According to what Jones said at the time, the other boys {{reported}} that Till had a photograph of an integrated class at the school he attended in Chicago, and Till bragged to the boys that the white children in the picture were his friends. He pointed to a white girl in the picture, or referred to a picture of a white girl that had come with his new wallet, and said she was his girlfriend and {{one or more of the}} local boys dared Till to speak to Bryant. However, writing a personal account of the incident in a book released in 2009, Till's cousin Simeon Wright, who was also present, disputed Jones' version of what happened on that day. According to Wright, Till did not have a photo of a white girl <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>wallet</b> and no one dared him to flirt with Bryant. Speaking in 2015, Wright said, [...] "We didn't dare him to go to the store — the white folk said that. They said that he had pictures of his white girlfriend. There were no pictures. They never talked to me. They never interviewed me." [...] The FBI report completed in 2006 notes [...] "...Jones recanted his 1955 statements prior to his death and apologized to Mamie Till-Mobley".|$|E
500|$|In another {{scene in}} the episode, Homer shows his family an {{advertisement}} for his security company. In it, a monster is seen breaking into an elderly woman's house. When the woman screams, the screen freezes and Homer is composited to the screen, instructing the audience about SpringShield's telephone number. In order to composit Homer into the screen, director Michels made use of a greenscreen. The advertisement resumes and the monster is subdued by Homer, Lenny and Carl. Confused, the monster turns to Homer and asks, [...] "friend?" [...] to which Homer replies [...] "the only friend you need is SpringShield," [...] and holds a business card {{in front of the}} camera. The monster then puts the card <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>wallet</b> and says [...] "monster put in wallet." [...] The monster's last line was written during one of the episode's rewrites, but none of the writers on The Simpsons writing staff has taken credit for it. The line has since become very popular with the series' writing staff; Jean said that it was [...] "very funny and unusual for a television show," [...] and Gould considers it to be his favorite joke in any episode he has ever written. At the end of the episode, Maggie saves Homer by shooting Fat Tony's gang members with a rifle. The scene was conceived by series co-creator and executive producer James L.
