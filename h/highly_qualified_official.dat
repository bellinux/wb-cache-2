40|$|ABSTRACT Title of Document:		THE IMPACT OF HIGHLY QUALIFIED TEACHERS 					ON STUDENTS' ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AND 					GRADUATION RATES 					Donald Jay Walker, Doctor of Education, 2014 Directed By:			Dr. Carol S. Parham, Department of Counseling, 					Higher Education and Special Education 	This study {{examined}} the relationship between the percentage of classes taught by <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers (HQT) and students' academic achievement, as measured by students' passing rates on Maryland's High School Assessment (HSA), and graduation rates among secondary students for three academic school years (2011, 2012 and 2013) in the State of Maryland. All data relating to <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers and students' academic achievement and graduation rates was collected from the Maryland's Annual Report Cards, published by Maryland State Department of Education for all 24 school systems in the State of Maryland during three consecutive academic school years (2011, 2012 and 2013). The individuals in this sample were 10 th, 11 th and 12 th grade students from Maryland School System who participated in the Spring Maryland High School Assessment (HSA) for academic school years 2011, 2012 and 2013. A linear regression method was used to answer the question of possible relationships between the dependent variables, academic achievement test scores and graduation rates, and the independent variable, percent of courses taught by <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers. System level performance data were analyzed in a descriptive fashion in order to show the percent of students passing each of the Maryland High School Assessments (HSA) in Math, Biology and English, and the percent of students graduating from high school. In addition to the descriptive statistics, Hierarchical Linear Modeling analyses were conducted in order to determine if (1) students performed better on High School Assessments (HSA) in counties having more <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers (noted as Between Counties) and (2) if students performed better in years when there were more <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers (HQT) in a county, than in those years when there were fewer <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers (noted as Within-Counties or Between Years). 	Results of the data indicated that between-county or counties with more <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers (HQT) than counties with fewer <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers had a higher percentage of students who passed the Biology 10, 11 and 12, English 10, 11 and 12, and Math 10, 11, and 12 High School Assessments (HSA), over three consecutive academic school years (2011, 2012 and 2013). Within-counties, between-years or years when there were more <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers (HQT) in a county compared to years when there were fewer (HQT) teachers, there was no significant relationships between the percentage of <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers and students passing rates on the Biology 11 and 12, the Math 10 and 12, and the English 10 and 11 High School Assessments (HSA). However, for Biology 10, Math 11 and English 12 there was a significant relationship between the percentage of HQT in a county in a year, and the percentage of students passing the test that year. Counties where there were more <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers (HQT), a higher proportion of students graduated than in counties where there were fewer <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers (HQT), over three academic school years (2011, 2012 and 2013). There was no relationship between the percentage of <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers (HQT) within a county in a particular school year and the percentage of students graduating in that year...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teacher {{provision}} {{is one of}} the goals of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) of 2001. The term <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers (HQT) comes from the original language of Title II (Preparing, Training, and Recruiting High Quality Teachers and Principals) of the No Child Left Behind Act. Title II of NCLB designates federal funds to educational agencies for the purpose of improving the student achievement through the professional development of <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teachers and principals. To qualify for this funding, states must comply with a series of conditions stipulated in NCLB, and track their progress toward goals each state sets. Title II was originally known as the Eisenhower Professional Development Program, and has undergone several reauthorizations, though the original intent has remained relatively intact. The main goals of the <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teacher {{provision is}} to ensure that every classroom is staffed by a teacher deemed [...] "highly qualified" [...] under conditions set by NCLB. As some point out (e.g., Eric Hanushek), this section of NCLB is quite at odds with the general thrust of NCLB because it focuses on school inputs rather than student outcomes. The sections of NCLB designated to HQTs allocates the majority of the funds to the states and does not clearly define at the federal level what is and what is not a <b>highly</b> <b>qualified</b> teacher, allowing for more local definitions of this term. This provision has come under much scrutiny, as it is up to states to decide how to measure <b>highly</b> <b>qualified,</b> and states are not holding their teachers to the same level of rigor across the country. Since its reauthorization in 2001, Title II has yet to reach its stated goal of ensuring that 100% of teachers in public schools in the United States are <b>highly</b> <b>qualified.</b>|$|R
