In 1996 {{they managed to}} reach the semi-final but suffered a heavy defeat to the Auckland Blues by 48-11. From 1997 to 2002 The Bulls did not reach the final on a single occasion, at times ending last in the competition. 2003 saw them ending fifth and 2004 to 2006 saw them reach the semi-finals {{for the first time}} since 1996, but every time away from home. In 2007 they reached the final for the first time and also became the first South African team to win the Super Rugby competition by beating fellow South Africans, The Sharks, in a humdinger final in Durban. Down by 13-19, they kept the ball alive after the final hooter, taking it through various phases which eventually led to a try by Springbok winger Bryan Habana. Derick Hougaard added the conversion and The Bulls victored by 20-19. The Blue Bulls have a positive winning record against all the South African domestic sides including their arch rivals, Western Province.|$|E

The next year he re-teamed with Hepburn for the sports comedy Pat and Mike (1952), the second feature written {{expressly}} for the pair by Kanin and Gordon.

Tracy followed it with Plymouth Adventure (1952), a historical drama set abroad the Mayflower, co-starring Gene Tierney. It met with a poor response and posted a loss of $1.8 million. In 1953, Tracy returned to the role of a concerned father in The Actress. [...] "That film... got more [...] from the critics than any film I ever made <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>years,</b> and we didn't make enough to pay for the ushers in the theatre," [...] recalled producer Lawrence Weingarten.

Old tales of crime (especially with a French or Italian setting), new developments in science (including the theories of Charles Darwin), lives and struggles of inventors, tales of exploration and adventure in distant parts, and examples of self-help among humble folk, are among the topics which found a ready welcome from Dickens.|$|R
