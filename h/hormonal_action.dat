Neuroregulation by β-endorphin occurs through interference with the function of another neuropeptide, either by direct inhibition of neuropeptide release or induction of a signaling cascade that reduces a neuropeptide's effects.|$|E

Pressure from the baby might hinder the return of blood through the ovarian vein. It has to be noted however that dilation of the urinary tract is a normal observation in pregnancy, due to mechanical compression and the <b>hormonal</b> <b>action</b> of progesterone.

50|$|The <b>hormonal</b> <b>action</b> of {{progesterone}} {{was discovered}} in 1929, following that of estrogen in 1923. By 1931-1932, nearly pure crystalline material of high progestational activity had been isolated from the corpus luteum of animals, and by 1934, pure crystalline progesterone had been refined and obtained and the chemical structure of progesterone was determined. This was achieved by Adolf Butenandt at the Chemisches Institut of Technical University in Gdańsk, who extracted this new compound from several thousand liters of urine.|$|E

40|$|Long {{relegated to}} the backwaters of neuroendocrinology, it is {{becoming}} increasingly apparent that glial cells of the central and peripheral nervous system are key participants because they are capable of both sending and receiving hormonal signals. Hormones are also a critical component of neuronal/glial cross talk, leading to neuromodulatory and neurotrophic actions under physiological and pathological conditions. In the peripheral nervous system, <b>hormonal</b> <b>actions</b> on Schwann cells and hormonal metabolites produced by these glial cells promote myelin formation and the remyelination and regeneration of injured nerves. In the central nervous system, glial cells participate in the hormonal regulation of synaptic function, synaptic plasticity, myelin formation, cognition, sleep, and the response of nervous tissue to injury. In addition, central glial cells participate in the regulation of hormonal secretion by hypothalamic neurons. Therefore, glial cells are a key element to understanding <b>hormonal</b> <b>actions</b> in the nervous system and the regulation of neuroendocrine events. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Extracellular urea {{concentration}} modulates cAMP {{production in}} the mouse MTAL. Ionic reabsorption along the ascending limb of Henle's loop (TAL) is controlled by hormonal stimulation. Most of the hormones that affect this reabsorption regulate ionic transporter activity via cAMP, {{and some of these}} <b>hormonal</b> <b>actions</b> {{have been shown to be}} modulated by interstitial osmolarity. We studied the early effects of increasing extracellular urea concentration on the production of cAMP induced by arginine vasopressin (AVP) and forskolin in a suspension of medullary portions of TAL (MTAL) prepared from mouse kidney. The addition of urea, performed fifteen minutes before adenylyl cyclase stimulation, decreased both AVP- and forskolin-induced cAMP production. This effect, observed both in the presence and the absence of phosphodiesterase inhibition, was optimal with 300 mmol/liter urea. Addition of urea to the extracellular medium disturbed several cellular parameters, but the decrease in cAMP production appeared to be mediated by the activation of both the protein kinase A and a phosphatase rather than by the modifications in phospholipid metabolism. Since cAMP is the major cytosolic transductional factor in MTAL cells, urea present in the medullary interstitium may thus be considered as an important modulator of <b>hormonal</b> <b>actions</b> in this segment of the nephron...|$|R

Cellular and molecular biology and physiology focuses on the function and regulation of eukaryotic cells and organisms, doing research including signal transduction, cancer immunology, virology, immunology, and diabetes research.

5000|$|Releasing hormones {{also known}} as hypophysiotropic or {{hypothalamic}} hormones are synthesized by different kinds of specialized neurons in the hypothalamus. They are then transported along neuronal axons to their axon terminals forming {{the bulk of the}} median eminence, where they are stored and released into the hypophyseal portal system. They then rapidly reach the anterior pituitary where they exert their <b>hormonal</b> <b>action.</b> The residual hormones pass into the systemic circulation where they are diluted, degraded and have comparatively little effects. The synthesis, control, and release of those hormones is co-regulated by hormonal, local and synaptic signals (neurotransmitters).

5000|$|AR antagonists act by {{directly}} binding to and competitively displacing androgens like testosterone and DHT {{from the}} AR, thereby {{preventing them from}} activating the receptor and mediating their biological effects.
