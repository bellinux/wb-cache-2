40|$|SCIENTIFIC SUMMARY (English) The {{research}} in this PhD dissertation contributes to the non-life insurance reserving literature. We focus on two specific research questions: (1) {{the development of the}} actuarial techniques to appropriately handle the unpredictable medical inflation in context of private health insurance contracts with transferable reserves and (2) the development of micro-level claims reserving techniques that provide an alternative for the existing aggregated methods. Lifelong health insurance contracts Chapter 2 of the dissertation is entitled 'Updating mechanisms for lifelong health insurance contracts with reserve- or premium-based surrender values'. For lifelong health insurance covers, medical inflation not sufficiently incorporated in the level premiums determined at policy issue requires an appropriate increase of these premiums, the corresponding reserves or both during the term of the contract. Such a premium or reserve update is necessary to maintain the actuarial equivalence between future health benefits and surrender values on the one hand, and available reserves and future premiums on the other hand. In Vercruysse et al. (2013) and Denuit et al. (2015), premium and reserve indexing mechanisms were proposed in a discrete-time framework where medical inflation is only taken into account ex-post as it emerges over time and where the reserves are not transferable in case of policy cancellation. In this chapter, we extend this work by investigating the more general situation where a surrender value is paid out in case of policy cancellation. Reserve-based as well as premium-based surrender values are considered. Micro-level claims reserving Insurance companies hold reserves to be able to fulfill future liabilities with respect to the policies they write. Micro-level reserving methods focus on the development of individual claims over time, providing an alternative to the classical techniques that aggregate the development of claims into run-off triangles. Chapter 3, 'Reserving by conditioning on markers of individual claims - A case study using historical simulation', explores the use of claim specific characteristics, so-called claim markers, for loss reserving with individual claims. Starting from the approach of Rosenlund (2012) and using the technique of historical simulation we develop a stochastic Reserve by Detailed Conditioning (`RDC') method which is applicable to a micro-level data set with detailed information on individual claims. We construct the predictive distribution of the outstanding loss reserve by simulating future payments of a claim, given its claim markers. We demonstrate the performance of the method on a portfolio of general liability insurance policies for private individuals from a European insurance company. Hereby we explore how to incorporate different kinds of claim markers and evaluate the impact of the set of markers and their specification on the predictive distribution of the outstanding reserve. Chapter 4 of the PhD dissertation is entitled 'A multi-state approach and flexible payment distributions for micro-level reserving in general insurance'. This chapter presents a discrete-time multi-state framework that reconstructs the claim development process as a series of transitions between a given set of states. The states in our setting represent the events that may happen over the lifetime of a claim, i. e. ~reporting, intermediate payments and closure. For each <b>intermediate</b> <b>payment</b> we model the payment distribution separately. To this end, we use a body-tail approach where the body of the distribution is modeled separately from the tail. Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape introduced by Stasinopoulos & Rigby (2007) allow for flexible modeling of the body distribution while incorporating covariate information. We use the toolbox from Extreme Value Theory to determine the threshold separating the body from the tail and to model the tail of the payment distributions. We do not correct payments for inflation beforehand, but include relevant covariate information in the model. Using these building blocks, we outline a simulation procedure to evaluate the RBNS reserve.

This paper deals with a portfolio selection model which uses optimization methodology to minimize conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) under return constraint. It focuses on minimizing CVaR rather than on minimizing value-at-Risk VaR, as portfolios with low CVaR necessarily have low VaR as well. We consider a simple investment problem where besides stocks and bonds, the investor can also include structured products into the investment portfolio. Due to possible <b>intermediate</b> <b>payments</b> from structured product, {{we have to deal}} with a re-investment problem modeled as a linear optimization problem...|$|R

Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics, 165 (4), 684 - 700. ] makes a related prediction {{that the difference between}} the preference for increasing wage payments and the preference for increasing non-wage payments will be largest for <b>intermediate</b> <b>payments.</b> We find evidence consistent with this prediction. Consistent with previous experiments, we find that the preference for increasing payments is increasing {{in the size of the}} payments.

50|$|A more {{detailed}} description of the forward substitution is as follows. For each stage of the iterative process, we are interested in deriving the n-year zero-coupon bond yield, also known as the internal rate of return of the zero-coupon bond. As there are no <b>intermediate</b> <b>payments</b> on this bond, (all the interest and principal is realized at the end of n years) it is sometimes called the n-year spot rate. To derive this rate we observe that the theoretical price of a bond can be calculated as the present value of the cash flows to be received in the future. In the case of swap rates, we want the par bond rate (Swaps are priced at par when created) and therefore we require that the present value of the future cash flows and principal be equal to 100%.|$|R

40|$|Prior {{studies have}} found that {{subjects}} prefer an improving sequence of income over a constant sequence, even if the constant sequence offers a larger present discounted value. However, little is known about how these preferences vary with the size of the wage payments. In each of our three studies, we find a positive relationship between the preference for increasing payments {{and the size of the}} payments. Further, our measure of the decreasing marginal utility of money is only weakly associated with this relationship. Additionally, our results roughly confirm an earlier theoretical prediction that the preference for increasing wage payments will be largest for <b>intermediate</b> sized <b>payments.</b> Finally, consistent with the literature, we find mixed evidence regarding the relationship between the preference for increasing payments and such preferences in other domains. ...|$|R

40|$|Simulation tools can {{be helpful}} for {{supporting}} stakeholders in better planning and managing dairy supply chains and exploring alternative ways of organizing chains. This paper presents a support approach dealing with two strategic issues that dairy processors face in interactions with their suppliers and buyers: (i) selecting their product portfolio according to market opportunities and (ii) designing milk payment systems encouraging dairy farmers to supply good quantity and quality milk throughout the year. This approach {{is based on the}} design of a spreadsheet application called DairyPlant developed with Excel®. DairyPlant calculates the daily profit obtained by a dairy processing unit and the gross revenue obtained by each of its suppliers according to its product portfolio, its milk payment system and its suppliers' individual milk quantity and quality profile. Calculations take into account the processing yield defined by the software user for each marketed and <b>intermediate</b> product. <b>Payment</b> systems may include a base price and up to three quality components. The approach was tested in two small-scale dairy plants in the Mantaro Valley (Peru). For each plant, this included technical and economic data collection, construction of a reference scenario closed to the current plant situation, and simulation and evaluation of alternative portfolios or milk payment systems. Based on these simulations, dairy processors realized that (i) they could increase their total profits by modification of their current portfolio toward higher value products on the assumption that milk delivered to the plant attained a given quality; (ii) they did not adequately compensate farmers who delivered good quality milk but overpaid some who delivered poor quality milk; (iii) their profits could be increased by adoption of a payment system based on milk quality. Advantages and limits of DairyPlant are discussed in the light of an extended use of the support approach in other locations. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
30|$|The method {{employed}} for {{the content of}} value added, its distribution, {{and the content of}} employment, in direct and indirect exports, between the NAFTA members follows the traditional input–output analysis based on demand. As a starting point, a set of fixed proportion production functions is used through which it is assumed that, for each product is necessary a unique combination of intermediate inputs, raw materials and components, labor and capital, so that there is no substitution between inputs or factors of production. It is considered that, for a given period, satisfying the demand implies a set of <b>intermediate</b> transactions and <b>payments</b> to the factors of production. Also, since it is a demand model, the method employed does not explain the value-added content in terms of changes in productivity, economies of scale, or market power. The method is just an approximation to the description of what happened, assuming that the market conditions were given and that any observed change in the generation of value, labor content, as well as other inputs could be explained by the changes in the demand and/or in the supply. In research conducted by Ferrarini (2011), Timmer et al. (2015), and Erumban et al. (2011), the authors show in detail how the method employed here represents the GVCs as a geographical and sectorial model of value distribution of the final production.|$|R
