40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{identify}} strategies for bringing innovation into public sector organizations, and develop some {{ideas about how}} and when to deploy these strategies. We discuss management innovation conceptually, and then discuss some specific <b>techniques</b> of management <b>innovation</b> now being experimented within the public sector. These techniques include: Strategic planning, reengineering, total quality management, benchmarking, team management and privatization. This is not an exhaustive list of <b>innovation</b> <b>techniques</b> but rather a set of the most common <b>innovation</b> <b>techniques</b> now used in the public sector. While we will address each technique separately, in the real world they tend to be used in combination and in no way should be seen as mutually exclusive. In fact, a major assumption of this paper is that despite the presence of consultants and others who advocate one technique as the "right " one to follow, effective management innovation requires a blending and tailoring of a variety of <b>innovation</b> <b>techniques</b> to an organization's unique culture and environment. II. The Concept of Public Sector Management Innovation For us, public sector management innovation can be best defined as the development of new policy designs and new standard operating procedures by public organizations to address public policy problems.

40|$|The Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) {{has been}} widely {{recognized}} as a powerful systematic <b>innovation</b> <b>technique</b> {{that can be applied}} to a wide arrange of disciplines. This paper focuses on engineering design and illustrates how modeling methods already familiar to engineering designers can be adapted for use in TRIZ. Specifically, the 'black-box ' modeling technique, common in problem formulation and clarification in engineering design, is modified for use in TRIZ. The new technique, referred to as Energy, Material, System modeling, can not only serve as a substitute for substance-field modeling, but as it builds on existing knowledge in the engineering design community, removes one of the barriers to wider TRIZ adoption by not requiring designers to learn new and radically different modeling techniques. The efficacy of the technique is illustrated via several examples...|$|E
40|$|Smart rotor {{emerges as}} an <b>innovation</b> <b>technique</b> {{to reduce the}} impact of dynamic loading on wind turbines. Local {{movements}} of distributed aerodynamic devices will enhance the non-uniformity and dynamic effects of loading, which will challenge {{the applicability of the}} blade element momentum theory (BEM) for smart rotor control design due to its fundamental assumptions, quasi-steady state and independent annuli. From a recent report of Sandia Lab of field tests of wind turbine with trailing edge flaps, an unsteady aerodynamic model for the response to turbulent wind and AALC device actuation is needed and a dynamic wake model is necesary[1]. However, most of previous aeroseverelastic studies of smart rotor are based on BEM or BEM-based engineering dynamic inflow models, none of them verify the applicability of BEM for smart rotor study. In this paper, a free wake model which combined a vortex ring model with a semi-infinite cylindrical vortex tube is developed, and applied to an actuator disc with non-uniform and dynamic loading. After tested in a steady, uniform load case, the model is applied to three main load cases: a non-uniform steady load, a uniform dynamic load and a non-uniform dynamic load. Results from this model are compared with MT, and with two widely used engineering dynamic inflow models. Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & PropulsionAerospace Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|Process {{innovation}} {{combines a}} process view of {{business with the}} application of innovation to effect order-of-magnitude improvement in performance. In order to gain the order of magnitude change that is required for process innovation, the key processes must be redesigned {{from beginning to end}} using all the <b>innovation</b> <b>techniques</b> and resources available to an organization. A knowledge-based decision support tool called KOPeR-Lite was developed to assist Business Process Reengineering (BPR) novices in process innovation. KOPeR-Lite utilizes knowledge gained from BPR experts and the literature to perform measurement-driven inference. Such inference is used to interpret empirical measurements, diagnose process pathologies and match such diagnoses with appropriate transformations. This research assesses the effectiveness of process <b>innovation</b> <b>techniques</b> by examining the relative performance of BPR novices who use KOPeR-Lite with that of novices who do not use this system.
