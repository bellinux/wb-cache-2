25|$|Ubuntu Touch <b>is,</b> <b>by</b> <b>now,</b> an {{unofficial}} version of Ubuntu developed for smartphones and tablets which was announced then-official by Cannonical on 2 January 2013. Ubuntu Touch was released to manufacturing on 16 September 2014. The first device {{to run it}} was the Galaxy Nexus. A concept for a smartphone running Ubuntu for Phones was published on Ubuntu's official channel on YouTube. The platform allows developing one app with two interfaces: a smartphone UI, and, when docked, a desktop UI; a demo version for higher-end Ubuntu smartphones was shown that could run a full Ubuntu desktop when connected to a monitor and keyboard, which was to ship as Ubuntu for Android. Ubuntu for Tablets was previewed at 19 February 2013. According to the keynote video, an Ubuntu Phone {{will be able to}} connect to a tablet, which will then utilize a tablet interface; plugging a keyboard and mouse into the tablet will transform the phone into a desktop; and plugging a television monitor into the phone will bring up the Ubuntu TV interface.|$|E

500|$|Among Harrison's biographers, Dale Allison {{describes}} the song as an [...] "expression of alienation from the world" [...] and comments: [...] "The disparity between this confused melancholy and the confident religious advocacy on All Things Must Pass and Living in the Material World is remarkable." [...] Gary Tillery groups the song with the Extra Texture tracks [...] "Grey Cloudy Lies" [...] and [...] "Tired of Midnight Blue" [...] {{as examples of}} Harrison having reached [...] "rock bottom" [...] in 1975. Elliot Huntley views [...] "World of Stone" [...] as overlong, with the shouted backing vocals [...] "annoying" [...] and Harrison's guitar sound [...] "thin and weedy", and he bemoans that [...] "the melody doesn't really deviate from its beginnings". Like Leng, Ian Inglis gives over much of {{his discussion of the}} song to possible interpretations of its lyrics, but he otherwise writes: [...] "Harrison returns to his view of the world as a place of obstacles and trials in which there is little hope ... The variations in his vocal range fail to add variety or interest to what <b>is,</b> <b>by</b> <b>now,</b> a predictable and cheerless message, set to a leaden and monotonous score." ...|$|E
500|$|In each panel, Dyer {{is framed}} by a doorway, and set against a flat, {{anonymous}} foreground coloured with black and brown hues. In the left frame, he is seated on a toilet with his head crouched between his knees as if in pain. Although his arched back, thighs and legs are according to the Irish critic Colm Tóibín, [...] "lovingly painted", Dyer <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>now</b> clearly a broken man. The central panel shows Dyer sitting on the toilet bowl in a more contemplative pose, his head and upper body writhing beneath a hanging lightbulb which throws a large bat-like shadow formed {{in the shape of}} a demon or Eumenide. The art critic Sally Yard has noted that in the portrayal of Dyer's flesh, [...] "life seems to visibly drain... into the substantial character of the shadow beneath him". Dyer's posture suggests he is seated on a lavatory bowl, though the object is not described. Schmied has proposed that in this frame the blackness of the background has enveloped the subject, and it [...] "seems to be advancing forward over the threshold, threatening the viewer like a flood or a giant bat with flapping wings and extended claws." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{government}} of Gujarat itself {{is generally considered}} by scholars to have been complicit in the riots, and has otherwise received heavy criticism for its handling of the situation. Several scholars have described the violence as a pogrom, while others have called it an example of state terrorism. Summarising academic views on the subject, Martha Nussbaum said: [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>now</b> a broad consensus that the Gujarat violence {{was a form of}} ethnic cleansing, that in many ways it was premeditated, and that it was carried out with the complicity of the state government and officers of the law." [...] The Modi government imposed a curfew in 26 major cities, issued shoot-at-sight orders and called for the army to patrol the streets, but was unable to prevent the violence from escalating. The president of the state unit of the BJP expressed support for the bandh, despite such actions being illegal at the time. State officials later prevented riot victims from leaving the refugee camps, and the camps were often unable {{to meet the needs of}} those living there. Muslim victims of the riots were subject to further discrimination when the state government announced that compensation for Muslim victims would be half of that offered to Hindus, although this decision was later reversed after the issue was taken to court. During the riots, police officers often did not intervene in situations where they were able. In 2012 Maya Kodnani, a minister in Modi's government from 2007 to 2009, was convicted of participation in the Naroda Patiya massacre during the 2002 riots. Although Modi's government had announced that it would seek the death penalty for Kodnani on appeal, it reversed its decision in 2013.|$|E

2500|$|... These {{equations}} {{combine the}} spacetime geometry encoded in the metric [...] with the matter content comprised in the energy–momentum tensor [...] The quantum nature of matter {{has been tested}} experimentally, for instance quantum electrodynamics <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>now</b> {{one of the most}} accurately confirmed theories in physics. For this reason quantization of gravity seems plausible, too. Unfortunately the quantization cannot be performed in the standard way (perturbative renormalization): Already a simple power-counting consideration signals the perturbative nonrenormalizability since the mass dimension of Newton's constant is [...] The problem occurs as follows. According to the traditional point of view renormalization is implemented via the introduction of counterterms that should cancel divergent expressions appearing in loop integrals. Applying this method to gravity, however, the counterterms required to eliminate all divergences proliferate to an infinite number. As this inevitably leads to an infinite number of free parameters to be measured in experiments, the program is unlikely to have predictive power beyond its use as a low energy effective theory.|$|E
2500|$|While the {{cartoons}} {{proved to be}} very popular and were soon syndicated in the United States and overseas, being published in newspapers in fifty countries world-wide, Roberto's company had closed down and the couple [...] "found themselves living in the US illegally, 'trying to find jobs that would keep us {{one step ahead of}} the Immigration Department'". By 1971 they had travelled to New Zealand, where they were married on 24 July 1971 at St. Andrew's Church, Epsom, Auckland – the same church in which her parents were married in 1936. Casali wore a crown of daisies and a shoulder-length veil that she had previously drawn on 'her' character in the cartoon. Casali said of the marriage: [...] "My father had died when I was young, so when Roberto asked me to get married I agreed, but said, 'Whatever you do, don't die on me.' He laughed and promised to stick around."

2500|$|Before 1930, Sanielevici also {{reached the}} {{conclusion}} that, after {{an era of}} realism, a new, [...] "proletarian", form of moralizing classicism was emerging in prose. He believed that the novels of international vagabond Panait Istrati, whom he described as vastly superior to Sadoveanu's naturalist works, were an early proof of this change. Sanielevici's idea was received with sarcasm by T. Vianu, who replied: [...] "Mr. H. Sanielevici, to whom, he informs us, we owe the 'shattering discovery' that realism is always succeeded by classicism, saw in Istrati's Oncle Anghel the affirmation of his theories and {{the dawn of a}} new era in moral health. Mr. Sanielevici's proclamation regarding Istrati came with the immolation of one hundred and fifty writers published in contemporary reviews, and this enormous sanguinary drive gave us the surprise of noting that classical moderation does not always keep company with the practice of temperance." [...] Vianu also parted with Sanielevici's comments about the supposedly classical quietude and political reformism of Istrati and his protagonists: [...] "Their moral is not social, because they are not sheltered by it and because they seek to escape its sanctions. [...] That Mr. H. Sanielevici was able to detect in this the representatives of qualified, almost bourgeois, workers <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>now</b> only an instructive example of how systemic prejudice may lead astray any particular judgment." ...|$|E
