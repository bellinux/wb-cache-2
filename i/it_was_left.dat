5|$|A He 111 H-20 (Stammkennzeichen of NT+SL), Wk Nr 701152, a troop-carrying {{version is}} {{on display at the}} RAF Museum Hendon, London. Appropriated by USAAF pilots in France {{at the end of the}} war, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> in Britain {{following}} the unit's return to the US, and taken on by the RAF.|$|E
5|$|Alexander Luttrell, who {{inherited}} Dunster Castle in 1910, {{chose to}} live at East Quantoxhead instead, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> empty until his son Geoffrey reoccupied the castle in 1920, redecorating some of the rooms in a contemporary style and building a polo ground alongside the castle. The castle and the surrounding countryside at this time was very popular with the Luttrells for fox hunting and shooting. During the Second World War the castle {{was used as a}} convalescent home for injured naval and American officers between 1943 and 1944.|$|E
5|$|Although {{credited}} {{with the development of}} the modern breed, Honeywood concentrated on producing dogs for hunting and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> to Thomas Johnson to refine the breeding to produce dogs that were both attractive and capable hunters. Two strains were developed: the rough- and smooth-coated varieties. The rough-coated beagle survived until the beginning of the 20th century, and there were even records of one making an appearance at a dog show as late as 1969, but this variety is now extinct, having probably been absorbed into the standard beagle bloodline.|$|E

60|$|This man shed tears we are told. Not another word. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>left</b> to our {{imagination}} to paint for us {{a picture of}} this weeping; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>left</b> to us to conclude that these precious tears were symbolical of the grief of Italy herself; that the catastrophe that provoked them must have been terrible indeed.|$|R

5|$|In August 1792 {{she started}} Catharine or the Bower, which presaged her mature work, {{especially}} Northanger Abbey; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> unfinished {{and the story}} picked up in Lady Susan, which Todd describes as less prefiguring than Catharine. A year later, she began but abandoned a short play, later titled Sir Charles Grandison or the happy Man, a comedy in 6 acts, which she returned to and completed around 1800. This was a short parody of various school textbook abridgements of Austen's favourite contemporary novel, The History of Sir Charles Grandison (1753), by Samuel Richardson.|$|E
5|$|It {{was hoped}} that the Air Force would guard the plane, but, lacking hangar space, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> {{outdoors}} on a remote part of the air base, exposed to the elements. Souvenir hunters broke in and removed parts. Insects and birds then gained access to the aircraft. Paul E. Garber of the Smithsonian Institution, became concerned about the Enola Gays condition, and on 10 August 1960, Smithsonian staff began dismantling the aircraft. The components were transported to the Smithsonian storage facility at Suitland, Maryland, on 21 July 1961.|$|E
5|$|Kepler was {{the first}} to devise a system that {{described}} correctly the details of the motion of the planets with the Sun at the center. However, Kepler did not succeed in formulating a theory behind the laws he wrote down. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> to Newton's invention of celestial dynamics and his law of gravitation to finally explain the motions of the planets. Newton also developed the reflecting telescope.|$|E

After more than 2million votes were cast, the winning entrant was revealed as Fisher, who won a six-month contract to play Maria in the West End production, performing six out of the eight weekly shows.|$|E
5|$|London {{was also}} full of black powder, {{especially}} {{along the river}} front. Much of <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> {{in the homes of}} private citizens from the days of the English Civil War, as the former members of Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army still retained their muskets and the powder with which to load them. Five to six hundred tons of powder was stored in the Tower of London. The ship chandlers along the wharves also held large stocks, stored in wooden barrels.|$|E
5|$|Marilyn Waring {{described}} how {{the exclusion of}} non-market activities in the national accounting systems relied on the deliberate choice and {{the design of the}} international standard of national accounts that explicitly excluded non-market activities. In some countries, such as Norway, which had included unpaid household work in the GDP {{in the first half of}} the 20th century, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> out in 1950 for reasons of compatibility with the new international standard.|$|E

5|$|The French and British ambassadors had set {{themselves}} up at Poros and invited Constantinople {{to send a}} diplomat there so as to pursue negotiations over the status of Greece. The Porte persisted in refusing to participate in conferences. Hence, the French suggested continuing military operations and extending them into Attica and Euboea. The British opposed this plan. Thus <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> to the Greeks to drive out the Ottomans from these territories, {{with the understanding that}} the French army would only intervene if the Greeks found themselves in trouble.|$|E
5|$|The match started amid clear weather, a far {{cry from}} the {{previous}} Ashes Test at the ground in 1938, which was abandoned without a ball being bowled due to continuous rain for several days. The outfield was also smooth and green, a contrast to its state during World War II, when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> cratered by German bombing raids. Yardley won the toss and elected to bat.|$|E
5|$|Wat'ul Chatel's last {{monument}} {{was erected}} in 889. This stela {{is also the}} last dated monument raised at Seibal and by 900 the city was all but abandoned, the whole region had been engulfed by the Classic Maya collapse and trade no longer flowed along the Pasión-Usumacinta route. Most Classic Maya capitals had already been abandoned and whatever external support Seibal had received from its overlord had vanished. By 930 AD, the site was completely abandoned. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> relatively undisturbed until around 1890 when Federico Artes was informed of the city’s ruins.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{casualties}} of the Army of the North were not substantial, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> demoralized and disbanded. Goyeneche pursued the fleeing patriots, and captured Huaqui after his victory. The inhabitants of Upper Peru welcomed the royalists back, so {{the army had}} to quickly leave those provinces. However, the resistance of Cochabamba prevented the royalists from proceeding to Buenos Aires. Castelli moved to the post of Quirbe, and received orders to return to Buenos Aires for trial. However, {{by the time he}} was notified, new orders had been issued: Castelli should be confined at Catamarca, while Saavedra himself took charge of the Army of the North. Saavedra was deposed as soon as he left Buenos Aires, and was confined to San Juan. The First Triumvirate, which had commenced governing by then, required Castelli to return.|$|E
5|$|Following several stages won by sprinters and {{breakaway}}s, {{the next}} {{test for the}} riders was the legendary Alto de El Angliru in Stage 13. The morning breakaway was afforded over eleven minutes, but it was dropped to nothing on the ascent {{of what has been}} called the most difficult climb in all of professional cycling. Astana and Caisse d'Epargne both had many support riders in the leading group going up the climb, and they alternately tried to set paces to protect either Contador or Alejandro Valverde while isolating the competition. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> to Leipheimer to pace Contador to the conclusion as the climb reached its hardest part, 7 kilometers from the finish. Contador indeed {{went on to win the}} stage, and took the race lead as well. Contador added another stage win the next day when only he and Leipheimer could respond to the repeated attacks of Ezequiel Mosquera, and Contador won the sprint.|$|E
5|$|In 1864, {{at the age}} of eighteen, {{his family}} allowed him to join the Union Army as a second lieutenant. He was {{assigned}} to Company H of the 13th New York Heavy Artillery Regiment, assigned to the third division of XVIII Corps, Army of the James, commanded by Brig. Gen. Edward Winslow Hinks. The division was part of Major General Benjamin Butler's disastrous Bermuda Hundred Campaign and was engaged at Swift Creek on May 9. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> behind at Bermuda Hundred while the first and second divisions traveled to join Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant at Cold Harbor with two divisions from the X Corps. He was stationed at Fort O'Rourke located in Norfolk, Virginia where he contracted a fever and was sent home for six months, missing the unit's heaviest engagements at the Siege of Petersburg and the second battle of Fair Oaks. The illness he contracted would plague him for the next eighteen years.|$|E

5|$|No further {{military}} use {{was made}} of the bunker and the land on which it stands reverted to private ownership. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> abandoned for many years before the owners decided to redevelop the site. In 1973, the bunker was opened to the public for the first time under the name of Le Blockhaus d'Éperlecques. The ownership was taken over by Hubert de Mégille in the mid-1980s and on 3 September 1986 the French state declared it a monument historique. The area around the bunker has been re-forested, though it is still heavily scarred by bomb craters, and various items of Second World War military equipment (including a V-1 on a launch ramp) are on display alongside paths around the site. An open-air trail leads to and around the bunker with interpretative signs posted at various points {{to tell the story of}} the site and the German V-weapons programme. In 2009, the museum welcomed 45,000 visitors.|$|E
5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of war in 1939 Coastal Command had forces of ten Avro Anson, including four auxiliaries, two Vickers Vildebeest, two Short Sunderland, three Saro London and one Supermarine Stranraer squadrons. The Vildebeest and London were all obsolescent. The Ansons made up half of this force, but with insufficient range to undertake deep ocean reconnaissance <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> to the flying-boat squadrons, of which four out of six had obsolescent machines. This left three squadrons with suitable aircraft, the Lockheed Hudson and Sunderland that could operate effectively. Anson engines were in limited supply in 1939. Moreover, the Sunderland and Hudson airframes were also limited, the later being delivered {{at a rate of}} just two per month. To fill the gap in production capacity, the Air Ministry dispatched several missions to the United States to buy more Hudson airframes.|$|E
5|$|Shepard pursues Saren {{through the}} Conduit, {{arriving}} at the Citadel as it comes under attack by Sovereign and geth forces. Confronting Saren, Shepard can kill him or convince him to rebel, which results in Saren committing suicide. As a human Systems Alliance fleet masses to counterattack, Shepard must either save the Council and risk heavy casualties or abandon them to pursue Sovereign. Sovereign then reanimates Saren's corpse to attack Shepard, while simultaneously fighting off the Alliance. Eventually, humanity prevails, and Saren's corpse is destroyed while Sovereign is dispatched by the Normandy. Humanity will then join the Council, either as a member if it was saved or as its new leader if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> to perish. Regardless, Shepard nominates either Anderson or Udina to this new leadership position before {{turning away from the}} proceedings, vowing to end the Reaper threat.|$|E
