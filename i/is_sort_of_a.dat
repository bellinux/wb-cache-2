Attorney Mike Johnson of the Alliance Defending Freedom (formerly the Alliance Defense Fund), a Christian legal group, stated, [...] "I suspect {{most of it}} is childish pranks. Clearly, there are adults with an agenda to remove Christ from Christmas. But they tend to occupy themselves with the courts and courtroom of public opinion." [...] Stephen Nissenbaum, the author of The Battle for Christmas and a retired professor, views Baby Jesus theft as neither innocent vandalism nor religious hate crimes. Nissenbaum writes that, [...] "What it means is that it's OK to go around violating even pretty important norms, as long as real human harm isn't being done.

[...] Visual effects supervisor Christopher Townsend said Evans [...] "would practice swinging the practical shield so he knew the arc and the speed at which he should move. We would take the shield from him and shoot the scene with him miming it. Then we would add in a CG shield".|$|E

Clooney was a vocal South Park fan and was largely responsible for generating news about [...] "The Spirit of Christmas", a 1995 animated short film by Parker and Stone {{that served as a}} precursor to South Park. Parker said they decided to cast a famous actor in the small role of Sparky because [...] "we thought it was funny", and because they wanted to do something different from the animated series The Simpsons, which is known for having prominent guest appearances on a regular basis. Parker added, [...] "Since South Park <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> show that rips on celebrity, we wanted to degrade them in other ways too. And we thought let's have celebrities on, but have them do really minor, unimportant things". Comedy Central executives were excited at the prospect of having Clooney appear on the show, but Parker said they were disappointed to learn his role was so small.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of the book What Mad Universe (1949), Paul Di Filippo of Sci Fi Weekly posited that the book's author Fredric Brown may have been {{influenced}} by Hubbard's story. Umberto Rossi wrote in The Twisted Worlds of Philip K. Dick (2011) that writer Philip K. Dick was likely influenced by Typewriter in the Sky. Rossi noted Typewriter in the Sky came out in a paperback format in 1951, and a year later Dick succeeded in getting his first short story, the tale [...] "Beyond Lies the Wub" [...] published. Rossi said Typewriter in the Sky was [...] "the text that admittedly inspired" [...] The Cosmic Puppets (1957) by Philip K. Dick. In the book Harlan Ellison's Watching (1989), by Harlan Ellison, Typewriter in the Sky is compared to Purple Rose of Cairo, [...] "I bet if L. Ron Hubbard had written Purple Rose of Cairo they'd have given it a Hugo ... I mean, it <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hip, updated version of Typewriter in the Sky."

500|$|When {{the games}} are {{broadcast}} on Fox, Joe Buck and Tim McCarver call the game and, thus the duo has called many significant moments in the rivalry. In 2004, {{the first game of}} the season between the two teams, on April 16, a Friday night, was nationally broadcast on Fox, because it marked the first time the two teams were facing each other since the memorable 2003 ALCS. Fox Sports President Ed Goren said of decision to have the game broadcast on Fox: [...] "If were up to me, we'd take the whole series and come back a week later and carry all their games at Yankee Stadium...We started thinking about this at some point after the Yankees closed the deal with A-Rod. ... This <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> relaunch of the season in the middle of April. This is going to be an event." [...] MLB Commissioner Bud Selig called the broadcast [...] "an extension of the postseason brought into April." [...] This was the first broadcast of a regular season game in prime-time since Mark McGwire hit his 62nd home run to break Roger Maris' record in 1998. In October, when the two teams met in the ALCS, Selig moved Game 5 of the series to primetime due to the rematch.|$|E

[...] The themes and topics of the chapters vary widely: as one reviewer describes, [...] "You are also not subjected to 400-plus pages of intricate plot movement. While there is an overall story arc, there are also lighter chapters that focus on unusual classes ... or small moments that build the main characters." [...] Each chapter begins with a title page and ends with one or more [...] "bonus pages," [...] which are not integral to the main storyline but often offer ancillary details about the world of Gunnerkrigg Court or about minor characters. [...] The chapters have varied in length from four pages to more than eighty. [...] Each page is drawn in traditional (A4; 210 Ã— 297mm) page format and divided arbitrarily into frames.

500|$|By February 2005, Paul Lovett and David Elliot, {{who wrote}} di Bonaventura's Four Brothers, were {{rewriting}} Gordon's draft. In their script, the Rex character is corrupted and mutated into the Cobra Commander, whom Destro needs to lead {{an army of}} supersoldiers. Skip Woods was rewriting the script by March 2007, and he added the Alex Mann character from the British Action Man toy line. Di Bonaventura explained, [...] "Unfortunately, our president [...] has {{put us in a}} position internationally where {{it would be very difficult}} to release a movie called G.I. Joe. To add one character to the mix <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fun thing to do." [...] The script was leaked online by El Mayimbe of Latino Review, who revealed Woods had dropped the Cobra Organization in favor of the Naja / Ryan, a crooked CIA agent. In this draft, Scarlett is married to Action Man but still has feelings for Duke, and is killed by the Baroness. Snake Eyes speaks, but his vocal cords are slashed during the story, rendering him mute. Mayimbe suggested Stuart Beattie rewrite the script. Fan response to the film following the script review was negative. Di Bonaventura promised with subsequent rewrites, [...] "I'm hoping we're going to get it right this time." [...] He admitted he had problems with Cobra, concurring with an interviewer [...] "they were probably the stupidest evil organization out there [...] ". Hasbro promised they would write Cobra back into the script.|$|E

[...] "It's Wuthering Heights or Jane Eyre. Everybody loves somebody who has a past and a secret- and certainly Dimitri does- which we haven't divulged yet. That heightens ones interest and suspense. It's a special situation but what really makes it special is the actor's talent, personalities, good looks, and chemistry." [...] Since the writers created Dimitri as a very mysterious character, Michael Nader mostly {{stayed away from the}} press in order to help maintain that image. Whenever he did do an interview, he discussed the character {{in such a way as}} to add more mystery. Nader compared Dimitri to the Dynasty character he once portrayed, Dex Dexter. On Dynasty, [...] "John James (Jeff Colby) played the 'aw, shucks;' nice guy, and I played the guy who was on the edge, who would take care of business and not take any bull", he said. [...] "Dimitri <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> darker Dex. Though I don't know exactly how dark to make him yet." [...] Nader, as an actor, also provided the writers with more inspiration on the character. [...] "The more we see of him, the more he inspires us", Broderick said. [...] "It's just a wonderful marriage of actor and character He's giving us so many levels and such depth, that it's a challenge. But it's exciting. Dimitri is one of the characters that is so much fun to write." ...|$|E

[...] Told of the show's success in the TV Guide [...] "Save Our Shows" [...] poll, Sandy Grushow said, [...] "Obviously I'm happy and not entirely surprised", but added, [...] "You can't dismiss a season's worth of ratings." [...] Kim Manners, director on {{nearly a third of the}} Brisco episodes, said working on the series gave him an opportunity to grow creatively. He told writer Joe Nazzaro, [...] "It really woke me up as a director, almost spiritually", and that directing for Brisco was a large contributing factor to his success as a regular director on The X-Files. Manners said, [...] "When they didn't give it a second year, I was devastated", adding that he wished Cuse would have made a feature film based on Brisco. Considering the show's short life, Cuse later commented, [...] "If the show could have survived into a second season, I think it could have ended up running for actually a long time. Some shows just sort of fall through the cracks in the right away and they kind of stay on the air long enough to aggregate an audience. I think if circumstances had been different, Brisco could have had a much longer life." [...] Cuse also said the Friday night time slot hurt Briscos chances of building an audience, saying, [...] "We were on at 8 p.m. on Friday night, which <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> death slotâ€“ I mean people do still go bowlingâ€“ few shows have succeeded in that slot." ...|$|E
500|$|Deborah Wilker from The Day {{commented that}} [...] "Madonna's got an almost rabid energy about her, which she {{maintains}} {{for the duration}} of 90 minutes. In fact she rarely leaves the stageâ€”preferring to change costumes in a phone booth instead. Boy can she change. One minute she's a 50's teenager in a party dress, next she's playing a speak-easy chanteuse. It's almost difficult to believe that a career as young as Madonna's could contain so much popular material that on stage the star can barely get to half of it." [...] Don McLeese from Chicago Sun-Times reviewed the performance at Soldier Field stadium said that [...] "'Shine' seems like a dim possibility for her Soldier Field performance this month, because Madonna invariably takes the stage after dusk has turned to dark and brings back the sun again for the two hours that she played." [...] In another review, McCleese commented: [...] " [...] proceeded to show Soldier Field a few moves that would gain Walter Payton some yardage, while putting a whole new twist on the term 'backfield in motion'. The girl really knows how to cause a commotion." [...] Richard Harrington from The Washington Post felt that the tour [...] "would have played better to a full house at the Capital Centre or Merriweather Post Pavilion. But to her credit, Madonna performed last night as if the house was full, and the show is splendid pop theater. Madonna has described it as 'Broadway in a stadium', and with her nonstop dancing, costume changes, mini-dramas and dynamic pacing, it <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 'Liza With an M.'" [...] Jon Pareles from The New York Times reviewed the concert at Madison Square Garden in New York and felt that [...] "For all its effort and professionalism, the concert wasn't exactly moving; Madonna had to ask the audience to get up and dance twice. But as shallow, kitschy, pop entertainmentâ€”no big messages, no revelations, familiar sounds and images, plenty of catchy tunesâ€”the show was easy to enjoy. [...] The tunes stick to her limited vocal range and usually use short phrasesâ€”the better to keep her from running out of breath as she dances across the stage. And her band knocked the songs out with solid precision, recreating the gleaming sound of her records.|$|E

Reeve felt this gave {{him the opportunity to}} play [...] "a morally ambiguous character who was neither clearly good nor clearly bad, someone to whom life is much more complex than the characters I've played previously". Reeve blamed the failure of the film on poor editing. He said [...] "the movie <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> series of outrageous incidents that you find hard to believe.

2500|$|Loaded was a {{commercial}} effort aimed at radio play, another {{step away from}} the Warhol-influenced experimental days of their earlier albums. The album's title refers to Atlantic's request that the band produce an album [...] "loaded with hits". Singer/bassist Doug Yule said, [...] "On Loaded there was a big push to produce a hit single, there was that mentality, which one of these is a single, how does it sound when we cut it down to 3.5 minutes, so that was a major topic for the group at that point. And I think that the third album to a great extent shows a lot of that in that a lot of those songs were designed as singles and if you listen to them you can hear the derivation, like this <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Phil Spector-ish kind of song, or this is that type of person song." ...|$|E
2500|$|Speak No Evil was one {{of several}} albums Shorter {{recorded}} for Blue Note in 1964. At the same time, he was also active in Miles Davis's band, and so it is unlikely that Speak No Evil received any special attention {{at the time of its}} release. But the passage of time has led to the album being generally regarded as Shorter's finest, and also a highlight of the Blue Note catalogue. The Penguin Guide to Jazz selected this album as part of its suggested [...] "Core Collection" [...] calling it [...] "by far Shorter's most satisfying record". Allmusic assigns the album five stars. Murray Horwitz stated in 2001 that [...] "Speak No Evil <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> consolidation of Wayne Shorter's compositional excellence.

2500|$|Guitarist Michael Einziger {{noted that}} his {{contributions}} to the album were influenced by his musical studies during the band's hiatus: [...] "Maybe my desire to return to simplicity, or even to just go to simplicity - because I've never really written music that simple before â€” <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> response to maybe having a better or larger perspective of the overall musical landscape that Iâ€™ve never had before." [...] Einziger elaborated further, [...] "Over the years, we've become less and less aggressive {{as far as our}} music goes. There's always moments of that aggression, but this album is pretty free of that. It's definitely not a hard rock record. I think we're asking a lot of our fans. We're asking them to listen for things that they normally wouldn't listen for. We're not leaning on the strengths of our last records either. It's that much different than our previous work. I think we took a risk by making this type of album. But it's not some crazy, experimental album." [...] Vocalist Brandon Boyd cited Einziger as a key reason for the band's new direction, noting [...] "Michael really buckled down and studied musical composition that inspired him to reach out and dig into different places that he never has before." ...|$|E
