This paper presents the design of Firecoral, a browserbased extension platform that enables the peer-to-peer exchange of web content in a secure, flexible manner. Firecoral provides a highly-configurable interface through which users can enforce privacy preferences by carefully specifying which content they will share, and a security model that <b>guarantees</b> <b>content</b> integrity {{even in the face}} of untrusted peers.

40|$|Abstract—One of {{the crucial}} {{building}} blocks for Information Centric Networking (ICN) is a name based routing scheme that can route directly on content names instead of IP addresses. However, moving the address space from IP addresses to content names brings scalability issues {{to a whole new}} level, due to two reasons. First, name aggregation is not as trivial a task as the IP address aggregation in BGP routing. Second, the number of ad-dressable contents in the Internet is several orders of magnitude higher than the number of IP addresses. With the current size of the Internet, name based, anycast routing is very challenging specially when routing efficiency is of prime importance. We propose a novel name-based routing scheme (αRoute) for ICN that offers efficient bandwidth usage, <b>guaranteed</b> <b>content</b> lookup and scalable routing table size. I...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we briefly review Bayesian and frequentist {{prediction}} inference for time series, and then advocate {{the use of}} guaranteed-content prediction intervals. These intervals are such that their content (or coverage) is guaranteed with a given high probability. They, thus, are more relevant for the observed time series at hand than classical prediction intervals, whose <b>content</b> is <b>guaranteed</b> merely on average over hypothetical repetitions of the prediction process. Guaranteed-content intervals should, therefore, conciliate Bayesians and frequentists when no prior belief on the parameterization is available. This type of prediction inference has, however, been ignored in the time series context {{because of a lack}} of results. This gap is filled by deriving asymptotic results for a general family of autoregressive models, thereby extending existing results in non-linear regression. The actual construction of guaranteed-content prediction intervals directly follows from this theory. Simulated and real data are used to illustrate the practical difference between classical and guaranteed-content prediction intervals for ARCH models. <b>Guaranteed</b> <b>content</b> interval; heteroskedasticity; non-linear autoregression; parameter uncertainty...|$|R

40|$|Data {{outsourcing}} and {{cloud computing}} have been emerging at an ever-growing rate as successful approaches for allowing users and companies {{to rely on}} external services for storing and managing data. As data and access to them are not {{under the control of}} the data owner, there is a clear need to provide proper confidentiality protection. Such requirements concern the confidentiality not only of the stored data (content) but also of the specific accesses (or patterns of them) that users make on such data. In this article, we address these issues and propose an approach for <b>guaranteeing</b> <b>content,</b> access, and pattern confidentiality in a data outsourcing scenario. The proposed solution is based on the definition of a shuffle index structure, which adapts traditional B+-trees and, by applying a combination of techniques (covers, caches, and shuffling), ensures confidentiality of the data and of queries over them, protecting each single access as well as sequences thereof. The proposed solution also supports update operations over the data, while making reads and writes not recognizable as such by the server. We show that the shuffle index exhibits a limited performance cost, thus resulting effectively usable in practice...|$|R

In this paper, we extended this concept and propose an alternative approach to maximize the total effective throughput of SDT as well as to minimize the QoS violation penalty of the SON by service replication. We present both centralized and distributed algorithms for the placement of replicated servers on the SDT. Experiments are carried to quantify the merit, effectiveness and the scalability of the proposed service replication algorithm. In particular, the performance gain is very close to the exhaustive search. The algorithm performs well when we scale up the service overlay networks. Finally, we show that one only needs to perform a small number of replications to attain the optimal gain...|$|R

The 1976 Constitution prohibited cross-media concentration and subsequent media legislation contemplated pluralism as a vital societal dimension. This recognition however has always been expressed in vague and inoperative terms as no government has ever had a real interest in preventing concentration of media ownership and in <b>guaranteeing</b> broadcasting <b>content</b> diversity. In an ever fragile political environment, governments have either promoted ‘friendly’ media groups or, fearing adverse reaction, abstained to act against the perceived interests of the established ones. Taking advantage of the smallness of the country, media owners have efficiently argued that scale was necessary to maintain the media in national hands, and that concentration in itself was a <b>guarantee</b> of media <b>content</b> diversity.

40|$|Pure Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) {{networks}} are characterized as being extremely decentralized and self-organized, proper-ties which are essential {{in a number}} of environments, in-cluding teamwork, collaborative, and ad-hoc systems. One of the features offered by P 2 P networks is the possibility of having several replicas of the same content distributed among multiple nodes. Despite its advantages (e. g. robust-ness and fault tolerance), it is crucial to <b>guarantee</b> <b>content</b> authenticity, as well as to enforce appropriate access con-trol policies. However, the extremely decentralized nature of these environments makes impossible to apply classic so-lutions that rely on some kind of fixed infrastructure, typi-cally in the form of on-line trusted third parties. In a pre-vious work, we presented a protocol for content authenti-cation based on public key certificates that does not rely on the existence of a public key infrastructure. In this pa-per, we show how these certificates can be extended to pro-vide authorization capabilities. In our scheme, each peer classifies her contents according to several security labels. Peers allowed to access a given content must have a secu-rity clearance of at least the same level that the content’s. These security clearances, which take the form of attributes in public key certificates, can be discretionally issued by the content provider. ...|$|R

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{problems}} in healthcare informatics {{is the lack of}} interoperability among different healthcare information systems.

Furthermore, all these categories can be investigated in two major layers: syntactic interoperability layer and the semantic interoperability layer. Syntactic interoperability (which we term as messaging layer), involves the ability of two or more systems to exchange information. Syntactic interoperability involves several layers: network and transport layer (such as Internet), application protocol layer (such as HTTP or email), messaging protocol and message format layer (such as ebXML messaging or SOAP), and the sequencing of the messages.
