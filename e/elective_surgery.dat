5|$|After passing his exam, Woodruff {{entered his}} {{position}} at Sheffield, where he trained in emergency and <b>elective</b> <b>surgery.</b> Originally, {{he had planned}} to do surgical research, but Sheffield had no space for him in its surgical lab. Instead, Woodruff was given a place in the pathology laboratory where he studied transplant rejection, a process in which the immune system of a transplant recipient attacks the transplanted tissue. Woodruff was particularly interested in thyroid allografts to the anterior chamber of the eye because they did not appear to meet with rejection. Woodruff's work with the allografts gave him a solid basis to work in the developing field of transplantion and rejection. To further himself in these areas, Woodruff arranged to meet Peter Medawar, an eminent zoologist and important pioneer in the study of rejection. The two men discussed transplantation and rejection, beginning a lasting professional relationship. Despite his achievements at Sheffield, Woodruff was rejected upon applying for a post at the Royal Melbourne Hospital.|$|E

5|$|Male {{circumcision}} is {{the removal}} of the foreskin from the human penis. In the most common procedure, the foreskin is opened, adhesions are removed, and the foreskin is separated from the glans. After that, a circumcision device may be placed and then the foreskin is cut off. Topical or locally injected anesthesia is used to reduce pain and physiologic stress. For adults and children, general anesthesia is an option and the procedure may be performed without a specialized circumcision device. The procedure is most often an <b>elective</b> <b>surgery</b> performed on babies and children for religious or cultural reasons. In other cases it may be done as a treatment for certain medical conditions or for preventative reasons. Medically it is a treatment option for problematic cases of phimosis, balanoposthitis that does not resolve with other treatments, and chronic urinary tract infections (UTIs). It is contraindicated in cases of certain genital structure abnormalities or poor general health.|$|E

25|$|Surgery {{is often}} not needed. Complications, such as peritonitis, abscess, or fistula may require surgery, either {{immediately}} or on an elective basis. Whether the <b>elective</b> <b>surgery</b> should be performed is decided by external {{factors such as the}} stage of the disease, the age of the patient and his or her general medical condition, as well as the severity and frequency of attacks or if the symptoms persist after a first acute episode. In most cases, the decision to perform <b>elective</b> <b>surgery</b> is taken when the risks of the surgery are smaller than the ones resulting from complications of the condition. <b>Elective</b> <b>surgery</b> may be performed at least six weeks after recovery from acute diverticulitis.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the current study was to explore among young adults whether celebrity worship {{predicted}} the incidence of <b>elective</b> cosmetic <b>surgery</b> within the period of 8 months after controlling for several known predictors of <b>elective</b> cosmetic <b>surgery.</b> Methods: A total of 137 young adults completed questionnaire measures of attitudes toward a celebrity whose body image they admired, previous and vicarious experience of <b>elective</b> cosmetic <b>surgery,</b> attitudes toward cosmetic surgery, and a range of psychological and demographic measures at time 1. Participants were then asked to report whether they had undergone <b>elective</b> cosmetic <b>surgery</b> 8 months later. Results: After controlling for several known predictors of <b>elective</b> cosmetic <b>surgery,</b> intense-personal celebrity worship of a celebrity whose body shape was admired by the participant predicted the incidence of <b>elective</b> cosmetic <b>surgery</b> within an 8 -month period. Conclusions: The current findings suggest that the type of para-social relationship that young adults form with celebrities, particularly with those whose body shape is admired, may need to be considered by those when speaking to, and educating, young people about their choices around <b>elective</b> cosmetic <b>surgery...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Author(s) 2010. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract This paper investigates the trade-off between cancellations of <b>elective</b> <b>surgeries</b> due to semi-urgent surgeries, and unused operating room (OR) time due to excessive reservation of OR time for semi-urgent surgeries. Semi-urgent surgeries, {{to be performed}} soon but not necessarily today, pose an uncertain demand on available hospital resources, and interfere with the planning of elective patients. For a highly utilized OR, reservation of OR time for semi-urgent surgeries avoids excessive cancellations of <b>elective</b> <b>surgeries,</b> but may also result in unused OR time, since arrivals of semiurgent patients are unpredictable. First, using a queuing theory framework, we evaluate the OR capacity needed to accommodate every incoming semi-urgent surgery. Second, we introduce another queuing model that enables a trade-off between the cancelation rate of <b>elective</b> <b>surgeries</b> and unused OR time. Third, based on Markov decision theory, we develop a decision support tool that assists the scheduling process of <b>elective</b> and semi-urgent <b>surgeries.</b> We demonstrate our results with actual data obtained from a department of neurosurgery...|$|R

25|$|With the {{introduction}} of statistical software that can process large datasets easily, a number of state- or country-wide studies {{have been carried out}} to investigate whether birthdays have any effect on mortality. The first large-scale study used the records of 2,745,149 Californians who died between 1969 and 1990. After correcting for confounding factors such as seasonality in deaths, <b>elective</b> <b>surgery,</b> and people born on February 29, there was a significant increase in deaths in the week before the individual's birthday for men, and in the week after the birthday for women – in both cases, mortality did not peak on the birthday, but close to it.

25|$|Conventionally, {{caesarean}} sections {{are classified}} as being either an <b>elective</b> <b>surgery</b> or an emergency operation.

Regional anaesthetic is almost always safer for the woman and the baby but sometimes general anaesthetic is safer for one or both, and the classification of urgency of the delivery is an important issue affecting this decision.|$|E
25|$|One {{complaint}} {{about both the}} U.S. and Canadian systems is waiting times, whether for a specialist, major <b>elective</b> <b>surgery,</b> such as hip replacement, or specialized treatments, such as radiation for breast cancer; wait times in each country are affected by various factors. In the United States, access is primarily determined by whether a person has access to funding to pay for treatment and by the availability of services {{in the area and}} by the willingness of the provider to deliver service at the price set by the insurer. In Canada, the wait time is set according to the availability of services in the area and by the relative need of the person needing treatment.|$|E
25|$|Cosmetic {{surgery is}} an {{optional}} or <b>elective</b> <b>surgery</b> that is performed on normal {{parts of the}} body with the only purpose of improving a person’s appearance and/or removing signs of aging. In 2014, nearly 16 million cosmetic procedures were performed in the United States alone. The number of cosmetic procedures performed in the United States has almost doubled {{since the start of the}} century. 92% of cosmetic procedures were performed on women in 2014, up from 88% in 2001. Nearly 12 million cosmetic procedures were performed in 2007, with the five most common surgeries being breast augmentation, liposuction, breast reduction, eyelid surgery and abdominoplasty. The American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery looks at the statistics for 34 different cosmetic procedures. Nineteen of the procedures are surgical, such as rhinoplasty or facelift. The nonsurgical procedures include Botox and laser hair removal. In 2010, their survey revealed that there were 9,336,814 total procedures in the United States. Of those, 1,622,290 procedures were surgical (p.5). They also found that a large majority, 81%, of the procedures were done on Caucasian people (p.12).|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: To {{characterize}} cancellations of <b>elective</b> <b>surgeries</b> {{according to}} clinical and non-clinical reasons, {{as well as}} to verify seasonal influence and determine the estimated reduction of the index. Method: Quantitative, descriptive and retrospective study with secondary data extracted from the Public Hospital of the State of São Paulo database. Results: Out of the 8, 443 (100 %) <b>elective</b> <b>surgeries</b> scheduled, 7, 870 (93. 21 %) were performed and 573 (6. 79 %) were canceled. Out of these 573 (100 %) people, 48. 33 % were canceled for clinical reasons and 46. 40 % were for non-clinical reasons. Among the non-clinical reasons for surgery cancellations, those related to medical reasons stood out: {{at the request of the}} surgeon/change of approach (17. 93 %), followed by non-hospitalized patient (8. 96 %). There was no indication of seasonality regarding the reasons for cancellation in the assessed period. Conclusion: Although the rate of <b>elective</b> <b>surgeries</b> cancellations is lower than that of other hospitals with similar characteristics, it is still possible to reduce it from 6. 79 % to 1. 36 %, considering that 80 % of the reasons for cancellation are avoidable...|$|R
