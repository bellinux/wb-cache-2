5|$|A {{mandatory}} order is {{an order of}} the High Court which commands a public body to perform a public duty, and is usually employed to compel public bodies to exercise the powers given to them. It {{may be used in}} combination with another remedy, most commonly a quashing order. In such a case, the quashing order will set aside the unlawful decision, and the {{mandatory order}} will require the public body to reconsider the matter. A person who complies with a mandatory order cannot have legal proceedings taken against him or her <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> so.|$|E
5|$|Anbe Vaa was {{released}} on 14 January 1966, during the festive occasion of Thai Pongal. It received positive reviews from critics, who particularly praised Ramachandran's performance, as he was known <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> mainly action-adventure films up until that point in his career. The film was also a commercial success, with a theatrical run of over 23 weeks. It was also dubbed into Telugu, under the title Prema Manasulu.|$|E

5|$|Hard Boiled was John Woo's last Hong Kong film {{before his}} {{transition}} to Hollywood. After making films that glamorized gangsters (and receiving criticism <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> so), Woo {{wanted to make}} a Dirty Harry styled film to glamorize the police. After the death of screenwriter Barry Wong, the film's screenplay underwent constant changes during filming. New characters such as Mad Dog and Mr. Woo were introduced, while the original plotline of a baby poisoning psychopath was cut.|$|E

5|$|Ice had to {{be stored}} at {{multiple}} points between harvesting and its final use by a customer. One method <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> this was the construction of ice houses to hold the product, typically either shortly after the ice was first harvested or at regional depots after it had been shipped out. Early ice houses were relatively small, but later storage facilities were the size of large warehouses and contained much larger quantities of ice.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, {{the city}} {{became the most}} {{competitive}} city in the Philippines, making the city the best place <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> business and for living in. However, despite these achievements, Estrada only narrowly won over Lim in their electoral rematch in 2016. Recently, the City Government is planning to revise existing curfew ordinance since the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional on August 2017.

Nixon had campaigned as an ERA supporter in 1968, though feminists criticized him <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> little to help the ERA or their cause after his election.

5|$|In vain, the King urged Conservative leaders Arthur Balfour and Lord Lansdowne to {{pass the}} Budget, which Lord Esher had advised him was not unusual, as Queen Victoria had helped to broker {{agreements}} between the two Houses over Irish disestablishment in 1869 and the Third Reform Act in 1884. On Asquith's advice, however, he did not offer them an election (at which, to judge from recent by-elections, they were likely to gain seats) as a reward <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> so.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unknown}} why this {{hurricane}} went unnamed, {{even though it}} clearly met the criteria <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> so. Any statement about why is purely speculative at this point.

5|$|Originally, the weight-reduction phase had {{included}} removing the anchors from the battleship, but Wallin ordered {{one of the}} anchors to be reattached. His reason <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> so was that the anchor would effectively shift Missouris center of gravity forward to a narrower part of the battleship, thereby reducing the friction at her widest point. During this time, the Bureau of Ships offered valuable technical and salvage advice to both the civilian and military participants in the salvage effort.|$|E
5|$|Quality {{control and}} {{standards}} were imposed on clockmakers by the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers, a guild which licensed clockmakers <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> business.
