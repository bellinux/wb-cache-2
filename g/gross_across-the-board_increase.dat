In order to do so, a production function for educational achievement is defined and a number of different decomposition methodologies are applied.

In this paper, we analyse the recent price increases in the South African electricity sector and discuss the price determination mechanism employed by Eskom, South Africa’s electricity provider.

40|$|A firm's {{ability to}} adjust its {{production}} process to economize on low-skilled labor {{when faced with}} a minimum wage increase will differ greatly depending on industry or occupation. For example, more capital-intensive means of cleaning hotel rooms or serving customers at restaurants may not be readily available without degrading service quality. In such situations, the productivity of labor is essentially capped, and firms have few options when the minimum wage increases. This simple observation has implications for studies that rely on microdata {{to examine the effects of}} minimum wage increases. If firms only increase prices in response to a minimum wage increase, employment effects are likely small. If the goal of the minimum wage is to redistribute income from firms and consumers to workers, minimum-wage increases targeted at industries and occupations where such rigidities result in an inelastic demand for labor may achieve the desired goal at a lower cost than <b>across-the-board</b> <b>increases.</b> However, such a scheme causes an inefficient allocation of labor and would be subjected to substantial political pressures that may lead to anomalous results. Additionally, it is unreasonable to conclude that policy makers have the necessary information to skillfully set the minimum wage. ...|$|R

Despite its importance, little research has examined the effect of food stamps on children's overall well-being. Using the Current Population Survey from 1989 to 2001, we consider the impact of food stamps on three measures of poverty - the headcount, the poverty gap, and the squared poverty gap. These measures portray the incidence, depth, and severity of poverty. We find that {{in comparison to the}} headcount measure, food stamp benefits lead to large reductions in the poverty gap and squared poverty gap measures. We then simulate the effects of several changes in the distribution of food stamps and find that a general <b>across-the-board</b> <b>increase</b> in benefits has little impact on poverty reduction. In contrast, targeted changes can greatly reduce the depth and severity of poverty - increasing benefits to the poor results in a greater reduction in the depth of poverty than expanding participation rates, at a similar cost, among poor households.

40|$|The Millennium Development Goals were {{announced}} {{to the world in}} the year 2000. Handed down by the United Nations, the Millennium Development Goals promised a new way forward for addressing global poverty on an international scale. A key ingredient for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals was an <b>across-the-board</b> <b>increase</b> of modest scale in the level of development aid contributed by wealthy countries. Yet, while having signed up for as much, there has been a strong tendency among the rich countries towards non-compliance, accompanied by a generalised failure to offer accounts for as much (i. e. provide reassurances). It is my concern here to look at an important factor that might help in going some way towards explaining the apparent ‘bad faith' of rich countries: the state of public sentiment around global poverty. A key line of inquiry I wish to explore here is the condition of ambivalence among the citizens and residents of wealthy countries to social problems beyond national border. It is my contention that the active indifference of the rich nation-state towards global poverty occurs under conditions where there exists a complementary blasé attitudinal structure amongst its peoples. Using data from a 2005 national sample survey, this study provides information from Australia about the state of public dispositions around the Millennium Development Goals and global social problems. ...|$|R

40|$|Firms in many {{industries}} experience protracted {{periods of}} pricing power, {{the ability to}} successfully enact price increases. In these situations, firms must decide not only whether to raise prices, but to whom. Specifically, in a competitive context, they must determine whether it is more profitable to <b>increase</b> prices <b>across-the-board</b> or to a specific segment of their customer base. While selective price decreases are ubiquitous in practice (e. g., better deals to potential new customers by phone carriers; better deals to current customers by various magazines), to our knowledge selective price increases are relatively rare. We illustrate the benefits of targeted price increases, and, as such, we expand the repertoire of firms' promotional policies. To that end, we explore a scenario where two competing firms must decide whether to increase prices to the entire market or only to a specific segment. Targeted price increases (TPI), i. e., being offered an unchanged price (selectively) when others are subject to price increases, can be offered to Loyals (those who bought from the firm in the previous period) or Switchers (those who did not). The effects of TPIs are estimated through a laboratory experiment and an associated stochastic model, each allowing for both rational (Loyalty, Switching) and behaviorist (Betrayal, Jealousy) effects. We find that TPIs can indeed yield beneficial results (greater retention for Loyals or greater attraction of Switchers) and greater profits in certain circumstances. Results for TPI are additionally benchmarked against those for targeted price decreases and are found to differ. The range of effects stemming from the experiment {{can be used in}} a competitive analysis to yield equilibrium strategies for the two firms. In this case, we find that [...] depending on the magnitude of the price increase, market shares of the two firms, and price knowledge across consumer segments [...] a firm may wish to embrace targeted price increases in some situations, to institute <b>across-the-board</b> price <b>increases</b> in others, and to not enact any price increases in still others. We show that a firm can sacrifice considerable profit if it settles on a suboptimal pricing strategy (e. g., wrongly instituting an <b>across-the-board</b> <b>increase),</b> favors the wrong segment (e. g., Switchers instead of Loyals), or ignores "behaviorist" effects (Betrayal or Jealousy). game theory, stochastic models, targeted pricing, pricing power, promotions...|$|R
