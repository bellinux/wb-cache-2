5|$|Nepenthes rajah usually {{grows in}} open, grassy clearings on old land slips and flat ridge tops, {{particularly}} {{in areas of}} seeping ground water, where the soil <b>is</b> <b>loose</b> and permanently moist. Although these sites can receive very high rainfall, excess water drains away quickly, preventing the soil from becoming waterlogged. N. rajah can often be found growing in grassy undergrowth, especially among sedges.|$|E
5|$|The episode centres on Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) working {{her first}} case with Torchwood Three in Cardiff. A purple alien gas <b>is</b> <b>loose</b> {{in the city}} and takes Carys Fletcher (Sara Gregory) host; the gas kills its victims by orgasm, leaving behind a pile of dust. Over the course of the episode, the team hunt for Carys before the gas kills her. In the end they track her down to a {{fertility}} clinic; the gas leaves Carys to take Gwen host, but is stopped by a portable prison cell and dies out.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{volcanic}} {{areas in the}} world that have hot springs, mud pots and fumaroles, but very few have erupting geysers. The main reason for their rarity is because multiple intense transient forces must occur simultaneously for a geyser to exist. For example, even when other necessary conditions exist, if the rock structure <b>is</b> <b>loose,</b> eruptions will erode the channels and rapidly destroy any nascent geysers.|$|E

5|$|Chhinnamasta {{may have}} a lolling tongue. Her hair <b>is</b> <b>loose</b> and dishevelled and {{sometimes}} decorated with flowers. Alternately, in some images, her hair is tied. Additionally, she is described as having a third eye on her forehead and a jewel on her forehead, which is tied to a snake or a crown on the severed head. The crescent moon may also adorn her head. Chhinnamasta is depicted wearing a serpent as the sacred thread and a mundamala (garland of skulls or severed heads and bones), along with other various gold or pearl ornaments around her neck. Bangles and waist-belt ornaments may be also depicted. She may also wear a snake {{around her neck and}} serpentine earrings. Three streams of blood spring from her neck, one entering her own mouth, while the others are drunk by her female yogini companions, who flank her.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, it {{was officially}} {{announced}} that The Simpsons Ride, a simulator ride, would be implemented into the Universal Studios Orlando and Universal Studios Hollywood. It officially opened May 15, 2008 in Florida and May 19, 2008, in Hollywood. In the ride, patrons {{are introduced to}} a cartoon theme park called Krustyland built by Krusty the Clown. However, Sideshow Bob <b>is</b> <b>loose</b> from prison to get revenge on Krusty and the Simpson family. It features more than 24 regular characters from The Simpsons and features {{the voices of the}} regular cast members, as well as Pamela Hayden, Russi Taylor and Kelsey Grammer. Harry Shearer did not participate in the ride, so none of his characters have vocal parts.|$|E
5|$|Many of the scutes are {{strengthened}} by bony plates known as osteoderms, {{which are the}} same size and shape as the superficial scales but grow beneath them. They are most numerous on the back and neck of the animal and may form a protective armour. They often have prominent, lumpy ridges and are covered in hard-wearing beta-keratin. Most of the skin on the head is fused to the skull. The skin on the neck and flanks <b>is</b> <b>loose,</b> while that on the abdomen and underside of the tail is sheathed in large, flat square scutes arranged in neat rows. The scutes contain blood vessels and may act to absorb or radiate heat during thermoregulation. Research also suggests that alkaline ions released into the blood from the calcium and magnesium in these dermal bones act as a buffer during prolonged submersion when increasing levels of carbon dioxide would otherwise cause acidosis.|$|E

5|$|The ride {{itself is}} {{four and a}} half minutes long but {{original}} footage for the ride {{can be seen in the}} queue, and there is also a pre-show video. In the ride, patrons are introduced to a cartoon theme park called Krustyland built by Krusty the Clown. Sideshow Bob, however, <b>is</b> <b>loose</b> from prison to get revenge on Krusty and the Simpson family. At least 24 regular characters from the series make an appearance, all voiced by their original actors. Along with the attraction is a gift shop modeled after the Kwik-E-Mart, which opened in late 2007.|$|E

25|$|Additional {{protection}} {{training is}} unnecessary {{because they are}} natural guard dogs and always have been. As with every breed, obedience training is very important. The Neapolitan is very tolerant of pain due to the breed's early fighting background and the fact the skin <b>is</b> <b>loose</b> on the body, so {{it is important to}} routinely check for health problems, as a Neapolitan may not behave differently when injured or ill. They also are renowned for drooling especially after drinking or if they get excited.|$|E
25|$|According to Mulcahy, “ {{scientists}} and underwater archaeologists {{now believe that}} the earthquake was a powerful one and {{that much of the}} damage at Port Royal resulted from a process known as liquefaction.” Liquefaction occurs when earthquakes strike ground that <b>is</b> <b>loose,</b> sandy, and water-saturated, increasing the water pressure and causing the particles to separate from one another and form a sludge resembling quicksand. Eyewitness accounts attested to buildings sliding into the water, but it is likely some simply sank straight down into the now unstable layer.|$|E

25|$|Bruise shapes may {{correspond}} {{directly to}} the instrument of injury or be modified by additional factors. Bruises often become more prominent as time lapses, resulting in additional size and swelling, and may grow to a large size {{over the course of}} the hours after the injury that caused the bruise was inflicted. As stated above, bruising present in a different location than the site of impact is called ecchymosis and generally occurs when the tissue at the site of injury <b>is</b> <b>loose,</b> allowing blood to travel under the skin to another location due to gravity or other forces, such as in a black eye.|$|E
25|$|Manet's {{paintings}} of café scenes are observations {{of social life}} in 19th-century Paris. People are depicted drinking beer, listening to music, flirting, reading, or waiting. Many of these paintings were based on sketches executed on the spot. He often visited the Brasserie Reichshoffen on boulevard de Rochechourt, upon which he based At the Cafe in 1878. Several people are at the bar, and one woman confronts the viewer while others wait to be served. Such depictions represent the painted journal of a flâneur. These are painted in a style which <b>is</b> <b>loose,</b> referencing Hals and Velázquez, yet they capture the mood and feeling of Parisian night life. They are painted snapshots of bohemianism, urban working people, {{as well as some}} of the bourgeoisie.|$|E
25|$|Heated {{water in}} the suit forms an active {{insulation}} barrier to heat loss, but the temperature must be regulated within fairly close limits. If the temperature falls below about 32°C, hypothermia can result, and temperatures above 45°C can cause burn injury to the diver. The diver may not notice a gradual change in inlet temperature, {{and in the early}} stages of hypo- or hyperthermia, may not notice the deteriorating condition. The suit <b>is</b> <b>loose</b> fitting to allow unimpeded water flow. This causes a large volume of water (13 to 22 litres) to be held in the suit, which can impede swimming due to the added inertia. When controlled correctly, the hot water suit is safe, comfortable and effective, and allows the diver adequate control of thermal protection, however hot water supply failure can be life-threatening.|$|E

25|$|M39 (NGC 7092) is an {{open cluster}} 950 light-years from Earth that is visible to the unaided eye under dark skies. It <b>is</b> <b>loose,</b> with about 30 stars {{arranged}} over a wide area; their conformation appears triangular. The brightest stars of M39 are of the 7th magnitude. Another open cluster in Cygnus is NGC 6910, also called the Rocking Horse Cluster, possessing 16 stars with a diameter of 5 arcminutes visible in a small amateur instrument; it is of magnitude 7.4. The brightest of these are two gold-hued stars, which represent {{the bottom of the}} toy it is named for. A larger amateur instrument reveals 8 more stars, nebulosity to the east and west of the cluster, and a diameter of 9 arcminutes. The nebulosity in this region is part of the Gamma Cygni Nebula. The other stars, approximately 3700 light-years from Earth, are mostly blue-white and very hot.|$|E
25|$|Fatty Tissue. In Biology, {{adipose tissue}} (/ˈædəˌpoʊs/) or body fat or fat depot or just fat <b>is</b> <b>loose</b> {{connective}} tissue composed of adipocytes. It is technically composed of roughly only 80% fat; fat in its solitary state {{exists in the}} liver and muscles. Adipose tissue is derived from lipoblasts. Its main role is to store {{energy in the form}} of lipids, although it also cushions and insulates the body. Far from hormonally inert, adipose tissue has in recent years been recognized as a major endocrine organ, as it produces hormones such as leptin, resistin, and the cytokine TNFα. Moreover, adipose tissue can affect other organ systems of the body and may lead to disease. Obesity or being overweight in humans and most animals does not depend on body weight but on the amount of body fat—to be specific, adipose tissue. Two types of adipose tissue exist: white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT). The formation of adipose tissue appears to be controlled in part by the adipose gene. Adipose tissue was first identified by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner in 1551.|$|E
