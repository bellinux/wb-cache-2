5|$|This {{species at}} its {{breeding}} sites gives a long mournful call like the <b>hooting</b> of a tawny owl, {{and a much}} less frequent sound like the whimpering of a pup. It is silent at sea. The breeding calls {{are very similar to}} those of Fea's petrel, and Bretagnolle's analysis of the calls of the soft-plumaged petrel complex led him to suggest in 1995 only a two-way species split, with the northern forms madeira, feae and deserti all as subspecies of Fea's petrel.|$|E

25|$|Interestingly, since 1968 Beckenbauer, {{has been}} called Der Kaiser by fans and the media. The {{following}} anecdote is told (even by Beckenbauer himself) to explain the origin: On the occasion of a friendly game of Bayern Munich in Vienna, Austria, Beckenbauer posed for a photo session right beside a bust of the former Austrian emperor Franz Joseph I. The media called him Fußball-Kaiser (football-emperor) afterwards, soon after he was just called Der Kaiser. However, {{according to a report}} in the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag, this explanation is untrue, though very popular. According to the report, Beckenbauer fouled his opposite number, Reinhard Libuda from Schalke 04, in the cup final on 14 June 1969. Disregarding the fans' <b>hooting,</b> Beckenbauer took the ball into the opposite part of the field, where he balanced the ball in front of the upset fans for half a minute. Libuda was commonly called König von Westfalen (king of Westphalia), so the press looked for an even more exalted moniker and invented Der Kaiser.|$|E
25|$|The Australian captain Bill Lawry {{chose to}} open with his vice-captain Ian Chappell, {{who did not}} look happy at the prospect, and Keith Stackpole was {{returned}} to the middle order. Strangely, Lawry did not consider opening with fellow-Victorian Ian Redpath during the series, despite having made a double century opening stand together against South Africa. However, in the 1970–71 season Lawry opened the Victorian batting with Keith Stackpole with 'Redders' coming in at number three. Lawry and Chappell were soon out and it was Redpath (64) and Doug Walters (55) who {{made the most of}} Australian's 189/4 by the end of what was regarded as the best day's play of the series. Their stand of 99 was made against the hostile bowling of John Snow (1/23) and Bob Willis (0/26), with the barrackers on the infamous Sydney Hill started <b>hooting</b> and counting Snow out as he bowled a host of short balls. {{in the end it was}} the spinners who did the damage, Walters was caught off Ray Illingworth (1/59) after being deceived in flight. Greg Chappell had just been made Australia's Sportsman of the Year 1970 ahead of Evonne Goolagong, Margaret Court, Heather McKay and Rod Laver, but was caught and bowled by Derek Underwood for 15 and Keith Fletcher caught Redpath off Basil d'Oliveira's off-spin (2/20) just before stumps. Resuming after the rest day Deadly Derek (4/66) dismissed Stackpole, Marsh and Mallett as Australia collapsed to 208/8 and 236 all out, 96 runs behind.|$|E

40|$|Recordings {{were made}} of 193 pant <b>hoots</b> given by 6 adult males during ad lib {{sampling}} over a 16 -month period in 1988 and 1989. The {{presence or absence of}} a let-down phase, and acoustic measures of the let-down and climax phases of the calls, were compared for different call contexts to determine if an acoustically distinct pant <b>hoot</b> was given uniquely upon arrival at fruiting trees. The greatest proportion of pant <b>hoots</b> with a let-down (LD pant <b>hoots)</b> occurred immediately upon arrival at fruiting trees. However, LD pant <b>hoots</b> also occurred at other times during feeding bouts. The frequency and duration of the first exhaled element of 19 letdown phases were measured, and four measures were made on the highest pitched element of 49 climax phases: duration, maximum and minimum frequencies, and average frequency. No differences were found in these acoustic measures that distinguished calls given immediately upon arrival at a food tree from calls given later during feeding bouts. Thus no evidence was found that an acoustically distinct pant <b>hoot</b> was given uniquely upon arrival at fruiting trees. However, the analyses did suggest that identifiable pant <b>hoot</b> variants are given in different social contexts. The proportion of LD pant <b>hoots</b> decreased in more interactive social contexts, and other acoustic features may be available to distinguish this pant <b>hoot</b> variant at long distances. We suggest that different pant <b>hoot</b> variants might broadcast information specific to social, as opposed to ecological, context. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R

500|$|The tawny owl, {{like its}} relatives, {{has often been}} seen as an omen of bad luck; William Shakespeare used it as such in Julius Caesar (Act 1 Scene 3): [...] "And {{yesterday}} the bird of night did sit/ Even at noon-day upon the market-place/ <b>Hooting</b> and shrieking." [...] John Ruskin {{is quoted as saying}} [...] "Whatever wise people may say of them, I at least have found the owl's cry always prophetic of mischief to me".|$|E
500|$|The Southern Boobook is a mainly nocturnal species, though may {{be active}} {{at dawn and}} dusk. It is heard much more {{commonly}} than seen, being particularly vocal in breeding season. The characteristic two-note boo-book call or hoot can be heard up to [...] away, the second note generally lower than the first. Calling takes place from sunset through till dawn, generally with a peak in the two hours after dusk and just before dawn. It can continue for several hours. The male's <b>hooting</b> is higher pitched and of shorter duration—and is heard much more commonly—than that of the female. He uses it as a contact call and to advertise his territory to females, as well as when bringing food to his mate or even before mating. Birds give a harsher version of the call when mobbing intruders. Both sexes—though mainly the female—give a single monosyllabic hoot as an alarm call or warning. Southern boobooks also make a repetitive croaking or grunting call while courting, mating or greeting, or {{as a response to}} other boobooks <b>hooting.</b> Birds may switch from croaks to hoots seamlessly. Males generally croak {{at the beginning of the}} evening, and when arriving at the nest with food. A purring or braying call is used by both sexes as a contact call around the nest and (more quietly) when bringing food to nestlings, or by the female to beg for food from the male. The female makes a low trill during courtship and nesting. Growls, high-pitched yelps and screeches can be made when attacking intruders.|$|E
500|$|Taylor's {{high-profile}} {{verbal and}} physical clashes with Huff were well-noted. [...] "He was always <b>hooting</b> his mouth {{off on the}} field," [...] Huff said of Taylor. [...] "He'd tell me, 'Yeah, you're just a big talker.' He brought the best out in you. He was an unusual player, a great player, but an agitator ... I did everything I could to that sonofabitch." [...] The 1962 championship game between the Packers and Giants featured hard hitting and skirmishes throughout by both players, after which Taylor acknowledged there were [...] "some hard feelings" [...] between the two. Boxing promoter Al Flora, after watching the game on television, offered Taylor and Huff $2,000 for a four-round boxing match {{to be held in}} Baltimore on January 28, 1963.

500|$|Although Woodfull led Australia to a {{dramatic}} victory by 111 runs, his form {{was a problem}} as he managed only 10 and 26; he was also hit by the bowling. The bodyline controversy reached its peak during {{the second day of}} the third Test. An all-time record Adelaide Oval crowd of 50,962 watched Australia finish off England's first innings for 341. Then, Woodfull opened Australia's batting with Jack Fingleton, who was dismissed straight away for a duck. Minutes later Larwood, bowling to a conventional field setting, struck Woodfull an agonising blow under his heart with a short, lifting delivery. As Woodfull bent down over his bat in pain for several minutes, an image that became one of the defining symbols of the series, the huge crowd began jeering, <b>hooting</b> and verbally abusing the English team, something that was almost unheard of for the social standards of the era. Jardine reacted by saying [...] "Well bowled, Harold".|$|E
500|$|Many in {{the crowd}} {{disagreed}} with the decision and took exception to it being made by an umpire employed by the Englishmen. That Coulthard was a Victorian added to the emotions of the crowd, who thought along intercolonial lines. The Sydney Evening News propagated rumours that Coulthard had placed a large bet on an English victory, something that the umpire and Lord Harris later denied. Loud <b>hooting</b> came from the pavilion, especially the section where the gamblers, who had overwhelmingly backed a New South Wales victory, were situated. [...] It was reported that well-known gamblers were prominent in inciting {{the other members of}} the crowd, [...] amid loud chants of [...] "not out" [...] and [...] "Go back , Murdoch". Gregory was later accused of trying to fan the dispute and encourage the crowd to gain an advantage for his team. The crowd was already suspicious of Coulthard's competence and impartiality; the Sydney Morning Herald commented in that morning's edition, [...] "The decision [...] was admittedly a mistake".|$|E
500|$|When play resumed, England's Gubby Allen bowled {{an entire}} over to Bradman. As Larwood {{prepared}} to bowl his next over to Woodfull, Jardine changed to the Bodyline field setting. The capacity Saturday afternoon crowd viewed this as hitting a {{man when he}} was down. Journalist-cricketer Dick Whitington, wrote that Jardine's actions were seen as [...] "an unforgivable crime in Australian eyes and certainly no part of cricket". Mass <b>hooting</b> and jeering occurred after almost every ball. Whitington noted that [...] " [...] Hele believes that had what followed occurred in Melbourne the crowd would have leapt the fence and belaboured the English captain; Larwood, and possibly the entire side". Some English players later expressed fears that a large-scale riot and that the police {{would not be able}} to stop the irate home crowd, who were worried that Woodfull or Bradman could be killed, from attacking them. When Larwood immigrated to Australia two decades later, he remained fearful for his safety.|$|E
50|$|The barred fish-owl {{territorial}} song or call {{is a deep}} <b>hoot,</b> hoo or hoo-hoo {{also sometimes}} transliterated as whooa-who, whooa-who. The <b>hoots</b> slightly drop in pitch towards the end. If it is a double-hoot, there is an interval of about 1.9 to 2 seconds between the <b>hoots.</b> Other vocalizations known for this species include a noisy cackle of various syllables, fearful shrikes and strangulate noises, normally uttered in the early evening. In Borneo, the barred eagle-owl's flight call is described as several <b>hoots</b> followed by a groan. In some local mythology on Java, the species' calls are considered as those of demons.|$|R

500|$|Trailing the Minnesota Vikings 20–19 with 72 {{seconds left}} in the fourth quarter at the Metrodome in week 11, Phil Simms {{completed}} a desperate 22-yard pass on fourth and 17 to Bobby Johnson for a first down. The completion led to Raul Allegre's fifth field goal and an important Giants victory 22–20. In the Giants' three previous games, Simms had completed only six passes to wide receivers. In the Giants' victory he completed eight to wide receivers, four to tight end Mark Bavaro and 13 to his running backs—four to Ottis Anderson in the final two drives, three to Maurice Carthon, three to Joe Morris and three to Tony Galbreath. Simms commented years later, [...] "t's my favorite game in my career, because it's everything I always wanted to be as a player. I wanted to be tough, making big throws, immune to pressure, not worried about outcomes. It was truly like standing on the tee box in golf and there's trees on each side and water and you just go 'Man, I'm gonna rip it down the middle.' And no other thought crosses your mind." [...] The game has frequently been credited as a signature game of their season, and the Giants players celebrated the victory in the tunnel leading to their locker room and in the locker room itself in a raucous manner that was highly atypical for the team.
