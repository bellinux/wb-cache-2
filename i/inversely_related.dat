5|$|The LDL {{receptor}} gene {{is located}} on the short arm of chromosome 19 (19p13.1-13.3). It comprises 18 exons and spans 45 kb, and the protein gene product contains 839 amino acids in mature form. A single abnormal copy (heterozygote) of FH causes cardiovascular disease by the age of 50 in about 40% of cases. Having two abnormal copies (homozygote) causes accelerated atherosclerosis in childhood, including its complications. The plasma LDL levels are <b>inversely</b> <b>related</b> to the activity of LDL receptor (LDLR). Homozygotes have LDLR activity of less than 2%, while heterozygotes have defective LDL processing with receptor activity being 2–25%, depending {{on the nature of the}} mutation.

5|$|Keynes did not lay out an {{explicit}} theory of price level. Early Keynesian models assumed wage and other price levels were fixed. These assumptions caused little {{concern in the}} 1950s when inflation was stable, but by the mid-1960s inflation increased and became an issue for macroeconomic models. In 1958 A.W. Phillips set {{the basis for a}} price level theory when he made the empirical observation that inflation and unemployment seemed to be <b>inversely</b> <b>related.</b> In 1960 Richard Lipsey provided the first theoretical explanation of this correlation. Generally Keynesian explanations of the curve held that excess demand drove high inflation and low unemployment while an output gap raised unemployment and depressed prices. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Phillips curve faced attacks on both empirical and theoretical fronts. The presumed trade-off between output and inflation represented by the curve was the weakest part of the Keynesian system.|$|E

The reason is that multiple imputation degrees of freedom not only depend {{on the number of}} imputations but also <b>inversely</b> <b>relate</b> to the RVI. Also, and again as evident in Figure 13 the degrees of freedom were obtained under a small sample-assumption adjustment, which was determined by the type of reference distribution used for inference. The model F test assumes that the fractions of missing information of all coefficients are equal (equal FMI) and thus rejects the hypothesis that all coefficients are equal to zero.|$|R

Each chassis has a respective Core power that {{works on a}} cooldown timer: respectively, increased damage, increased shields, and unlimited dashes. Titan tactical ability options include stopping enemy ammunition in midair to throw back in their direction, emitting electrified smoke to hurt and repel pilots climbing the Titan's back, and deploying a defensive wall. Additionally, players can equip two perk kits to customize for their preferred strategy. Their primary weapons include rocket launchers, lightning cannons, and chainguns. Titans can act autonomously when put in guard and follow modes, which directs the Titan either to protect their vicinity or to tail their pilot, respectively.|$|E

Surveys of 1, 243 employees in the 64 centers were aggregated to the call center level and matched to archival data on service process quality, as measured by customer surveys; call handling time, revenues per call, and net revenues per call. Our path analysis shows that human resource practices emphasizing employee training, discretion, and rewards lead to higher service quality, higher revenues per call, and higher net revenues per call. In addition, service quality mediates the relationship between human resource practices and these economic outcomes. There is no significant relationship between HR practices and labor efficiency, as measured by call handling time; and labor efficiency is <b>inversely</b> <b>relate...</b>|$|R
40|$|This thesis calculates Credit Value Adjustment on defaultable options. The {{prices of}} default- able European options are {{computed}} through analytical, quadrature approximation and Monte Carlo simulations {{under the assumption}} of a constant rate of default. Subsequently, we propose to <b>inversely</b> <b>relate</b> the company’s instantaneous rate of default to its underlying stock price, re- sulting in a non-constant rate of default. This allows for {{a new approach to}} estimate the default of company different from previous work where default is calculated through historical data. The rationale behind this idea relies on the fact that price of the stock plunges before the event of default. For a given set of option parameters, we show {{that it is possible to}} find an optimal intensity, which produces the same prices of European options under a simpler framework. However, this intensity fluctuates with changes in other parameters. Implementation details and analysis of the results are provided...|$|R

40|$|The Fas-FasL system {{seems to}} mediate thyrocyte death in Hashimoto's thyroiditis. In thyroid cancer, {{downregulation}} of bcl- 2 seems to alter apoptosis control. We compared {{the expression of}} immunoreactive Fas and FasL in normal thyroid with that of tumors ranging from benign to highly aggressive. Fas is essentially not expressed in normal thyrocytes, whereas FasL is expressed in approximately one-third of cases. Expression of both markers is significantly up-regulated in adenoma and in well-differentiated papillary and follicular carcinoma. In contrast, Fas is suppressed and FasL is strongly reduced in the most aggressive histological variants (poorly differentiated and undifferentiated carcinoma). Immunohistochemistry findings have been confirmed by analysis of Fas-FasL mRNA transcripts. In vitro studies showed that the Fas receptor of thyroid tumor cells was functional, because apoptosis was induced by an agonistic Fas antibody. Fas-expressing and Fas-resistant mammary cell lines were used as specificity controls. Together with our previous data <b>inversely</b> <b>relating</b> bcl- 2 expression and thyroid tumor grade, the present findings further indicate that apoptotic pathways are altered in thyroid neoplasia.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} the degree of firm heterogeneity on the number of firms and of the difference in this degree between countries on international trade. The change in the mass of firms, trade pattern and welfare effect of trade are examined in a general equilibrium model where firms with different productivity levels in two countries having different degrees of firm heterogeneity in productivity compete in a monopolistically competitive market of a differentiated good. The paper reveals that the number of firms in a country always <b>inversely</b> <b>relates</b> to the degree of firm heterogeneity of its own, both in autarky and under free trade. In contrast, when firms in a country become less (more) heterogeneous, the number of firms in this country’s trading partner will decrease (increase). Two countries with different extents of firm heterogeneity will benefit from trade at an equilibrium where the country with less heterogeneous firms has more firms and is the net-exporter in the intra-industry trade of the differentiated good. This paper contributes to the analysis of the effect of asymmetry between countries at firm level on the industrial reallocation and international trade with firm heterogeneity...|$|R

Most sporadic CRCs arise from adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene mutation but understanding of its effects on vitamin D growth control is limited. Here we investigate effects of the ApcMin/+ genotype on 1 α, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 regulation of OPN/CD 44 /E-cadherin signalling and intestinal tumourigenesis, in vivo. In untreated ApcMin/+ versus Apc+/+ intestines, expression levels of OPN and its CD 44 receptor were increased, whereas E-cadherin tumour suppressor signalling was attenuated. Treatment by 1 α, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 or rationally designed analogues (QW or BTW) enhanced OPN but inhibited expression of CD 44, the OPN receptor implicated in cell growth. These treatments also enhanced E-cadherin tumour suppressor activity, characterized by inhibition of β-catenin nuclear localization, T-cell factor 1 and c-myelocytomatosis protein expression in ApcMin/+ intestine. All secosteroids suppressed ApcMin/+-driven tumourigenesis although QW and BTW had lower calcium-related toxicity. Taken together, these data indicate that the ApcMin/+ genotype modulates vitamin D secosteroid actions to promote functional predominance of E-cadherin tumour suppressor activity within antagonistic molecular networks. APC heterozygosity may promote favourable tissue- or tumour-specific conditions for growth control by vitamin D secosteroid treatment...|$|R
