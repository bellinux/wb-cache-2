40|$|In many {{applications}} a sustained, localized turbulent flow scours a cohesionless granular bed {{to form a}} pothole. Here we use similarity methods to derive a theoretical formula for the equilibrium <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pothole.</b> Whereas the empirical formulas customarily used in applications contain mumerous free exponents, the theoretical formula contains a single one, which we show can be determined via the phenomenological theory of turbulence. Our derivation affords insight into how a state of dynamic equilibrium is attained between a granular bed and a localized turbulent flow. published or submitted for publicationis peer reviewe...|$|R
50|$|Propantes is a pothole on the {{mountain}} of Parnon within {{the borders of the}} Paliochori community of the Municipality of Leonidio in Greece. The entrance is about three by seven metres wide. The entrance shaft drops to -289m without the need for a re-belay, making it the deepest daylight shaft in mainland Greece. The shaft was first explored using modern caving single rope techniques in the early 1980s by a Polish team and the exploration repeated soon after by veteran Greek caver Petros Romanas. All subsequent visits for many years halted at the deepest point leading off the main shaft at -310m. Between 1998 and 2001, the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pothole</b> was surveyed to -316m following exploration carried out by SELAS caving club of Greece. This exploration followed leads in the form of windows coming off the main shaft. In 2005 and 2006, teams from SELAS continued the exploration in the main shaft beyond the squeeze which had halted previous exploration at -316m. The current surveyed <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the cave is -360m with leads still to be explored.|$|R

Many researchers have studied methods to detect potholes and improve survey efficiency and pavement quality through prior investigation and immediate action. With these detecting methods, there is need for developing a classification guideline for supporting decision-making system of porthole repair. The {{purpose of this study}} is to develop a guideline <b>of</b> <b>pothole</b> classification for supporting a decision-making system <b>of</b> <b>pothole</b> repair.

40|$|The {{deepening}} and widening <b>of</b> a <b>pothole</b> {{is mainly}} attributed to abrasion by the rotatory movement of coarse sediments trapped inside. In rock coast <b>potholes</b> the effectivity <b>of</b> abrasion neds to be demonstrated. The upper section <b>of</b> a <b>pothole</b> wall is comparatively rougher {{than the rest}} and often displays a biological coverage. In the lower section, instead, abrasion reduces weathering effects and the rock is fresh and harder. We applied the durometers Equotip and Piccolo (Proceq©) in three potholes in the coast of Calafuria (Tuscany, Italy) to investigate the effectiveness of abrasion. We tested both devices using the Single and Repeated impact methods. The pothole was dried, the sediment inside removed, and the relative <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> each reading point was measured. Finally {{a sample of the}} gravel fraction from the sediment <b>of</b> the <b>pothole</b> was analyzed in the laboratory.

40|$|It {{has been}} assumed, {{on the basis}} of the {{distribution}} <b>of</b> <b>potholes</b> in the bedrock near eskers, that they were eroded by subglacial meltwaters connected with the formation of eskers. As seen from the spatial distribution <b>of</b> <b>potholes</b> in the county of Uusimaa in southern Finland they occur in narrow zones in a southwest-northeasterly direction, close to the big fault lines in the bedrock. It can therefore be concluded that most <b>of</b> these <b>potholes</b> were formed parallel to the ice margin in crevasses where meltwaters together with stones and boulders eroded potholes into the underlying bedrock. The crevasses may have been formed near the ice margin as a result of earthquakes along fault lines in the bedrock caused by the land uplift during deglaciation...|$|R

40|$|Pothole is a {{localized}} loss {{of material}} or depression on road pavement surface. The development of cracks and the formation <b>of</b> <b>potholes</b> on road surface are widespread problems in road construction and maintenance. The objective {{of this study is}} to develop mathematical models to compute stresses and deflections associated with the cracks in flexible pavement and the formation <b>of</b> <b>potholes.</b> A crack on a flexible pavement surface is a prerequisite for a pothole formation and progression. Three types of cracks, namely, transverse, longitudinal and alligator cracks are taken into consideration. As stated in the objective, mathematical models have been developed to compute stresses and deflections associated with cracks in flexible pavement and formation <b>of</b> <b>potholes.</b> A special case of blowout of asphalt pavement layer lying on an impermeable concrete base, due to water pressure in the cracks, is studied and a mathematical model is proposed. The mathematical formulations are applied to typical III pavement models and the results are reported in examples and graphs. A set of computer programs is developed for each proposed mathematical model to calculate stresses and deflections.
