40|$|Between 1920 and 1990, the Upper Fraser {{region of}} British Columbia {{experienced}} {{a period of}} rapid socio-economic change in which numerous small communities developed, boomed, busted, and faded away. The fortunes of these towns largely revolved around the existence of sawmills, which began to close in the 1960 s as the lumber industry consolidated. Many different types of migration {{to and from the}} region occurred during this period, affected by various social, economic, and geographic factors. This thesis examines the factors that affected migration in the region. In 2000 and 2005, two sets of oral history interviews were conducted with current and former residents who lived in the Upper Fraser region during the 1945 and 1975 period (the peak years of sawmill operations in the region). Many of the questions posed revolved around issues of migration, including why residents migrated to the area, where they came from, and reasons for their departure. This research compares the results of the two sets of interviews and displays the results using data-intensive descriptive mapping techniques. Results indicate that most residents arrived from the Prairie provinces and Nordic Europe in search of employment, and were prompted to leave because of <b>forest</b> industry <b>consolidation,</b> lack of employment opportunity outside the lumber industry, and lack of educational facilities in the region. Rather than declining directly with sawmill closures, populations often sank in advance of mill closures when people perceived that there was no economic or social viability left in the community, and could not see a future for these places. The improvement of transportation in the 1960 s also expedited this process. While this thesis does not provide exact statistics on demographics and migration volume, it contributes {{to a better understanding of}} the migration dynamics as well as the social conditions in the region, and demonstrates both the similarities and differences between the Upper Fraser region and other resource hinterlands.

40|$|In eastern North America, remnant {{patches of}} forest {{surrounded}} by open habitat constitute unfavorable habitat for {{many species of}} migratory forest birds because of high rates of nest predation and cowbird parasitism. Although most evidence for this relationship comes from 2 ̆ 7 forest islands 2 ̆ 7 surrounded by residential or agricultural land, even forest patches isolated from other forests by narrow open corridors such as roads and powerline rights-of-way seem to show this pattern. Productive habitat for migratory birds can be maintained by consolidating corridors and routing them along the periphery of forests to retain as much continuous <b>forest</b> as possible. <b>Consolidation</b> of open corridors provides another major advantage: the area along the corridor can provide a large area of suitable habitat for early successional birds, especially species that are shrubland or thicket specialists. Populations of many species of shrubland birds have declined in eastern North America as open habitats have been developed or have grown into forest. Rights-of-way and other areas subject to periodic artificial disturbance may become increasingly important to these species, which probably originally depended on habitat created by large-scale natural disturbances such as fires and windstorms. Relatively stable shrublands with a diversity of shrubland plants and birds can be maintained by selectively removing trees with basal applications of herbicide...|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} shift {{has taken}} place in global forest tenure, with a doubling of the forest area under community ownership (or administration over the past 15 years). There is every indication that communal tenure will double again over the next 15 years. Recognition of traditional and indigenous peoples' collective rights over forest lands has important implications for forest-rich countries—both developed and developing. Combined with dramatic changes {{in the structure of the}} forest industry and globalizing markets, this shift creates new opportunities and challenges for low-income forest producers and community enterprises to leave poverty and diversify livelihoods. The challenge for policy makers and governments is to reform outdated regulatory and incentive frameworks to support these enterprises. This article presents findings on three types of responses from communities to the new opportunities created by the tenure shift and looks specifically at community timber enterprise cases from Mexico and Brazil; recommending actions by communities, policy makers, and private sector. Changes in international and domestic <b>forest</b> product demand, <b>consolidation</b> of commodity wood sectors, new corporate responsibility commitments, and the emergence of ecosystem service markets all affect community markets. One response has been the emergence of socially-integrated, timber and non-timber based enterprises. Another has been the expansion of self-financed community conservation. A third response has been new models of collaboration between companies and communities...|$|R
50|$|The town of Packwood has {{historically}} {{relied on the}} forest products industry as an economic engine, supplemented by government employment (via the National Forest and Park Services) and seasonal tourism. In the late 1990s, the <b>Forest</b> Service began <b>consolidation</b> of many ranger stations, {{with the result that}} Forest Service jobs moved to the town of Randle and the new Cowlitz Valley Ranger Station. Shortly thereafter, several factors, including the Asian financial crisis, decreased logging on federal lands, and depression in lumber prices, brought the closing of the Packwood Lumber Mill. Due to the limited economic opportunity, the town's housing consists heavily of summer housing for snowbirds, retirement homes, and vacation cabins. The influx of retirees and determination of long-time locals has led to a recent civic revival in the town, however. Several local organizations seek to promote the tourism opportunities of the town, improve tourist and vacation infrastructure, and plan for the long-term economic revitalization of the town. The decades-old Annual Packwood Flea Market now attracts tens of thousands during the Memorial Day and Labor Day weekends, and the recently expanded White Pass Ski Area provides a steady flow of visitors during the otherwise tourism-slow winter months. A new art gallery, along with a heritage museum housed in the old school building, are indicative of increasing diversity and economic revitalization in the area.|$|R
40|$|Prof. Ir. Herman Johannes Forest Park has {{suffered}} a serious damage from illegal logging and other destructives activities. This condition is worsened by lack of law enforcement and awareness {{on the importance of}} forest for the community. This study aims to determine level of damage from illegal logging, and formulate strategies to sustainably manageon the Prof. Ir. Herman Johannes Forest Park. Public perception was obtained by administering questionnaires and interviews through a purposive sampling method. The level of damage from illegal logging was assessed through identificationand measurement of damaged locations. SWOT analysis was used to formulate the management strategiesbased on identification of internal and external factors. Findings revealed that 5 % of Prof. Ir. Herman Johannes Forest Park were damaged caused by illegal logging. The management of the Forest Park was challenged by illegal logging, forest encroachment, timber extraction for household use, slashing and burning practices, poor spatial planning, ineffective institutional arrangement, wildlife poaching, illegal grazing,and inadequate facilitates and staffs capability. In addition, there was lack of community involvement in the forest management. Aspects that appeared to require the most attention to improve the <b>Forest</b> Park includes <b>consolidation</b> of status and functions of the Forest Park, enhancement of surveillance and enforcement, improvement of the management effectiveness by establishing special division to manage the Forest Park, improvement of staffs capacity and infrastructures, rehabilitation of the damaged area, improvement of awareness to the impact of deforestation, and involvement ofindigenous and local communities on the Forest Park management (i. e. community-based forest monitoring, application of local wisdom in the forest management, community empowerment and economic development) ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} how landscape disturbance associated with roads, agriculture and forestry influenced temporal patterns in woylie (Bettongia penicillata) abundance before, during and after periods of rapid population change. Data were collected from an area of approximately 140, 000 ha of forest within the Upper Warren region in south-western Australia. Woylie abundance was measured using cage trapping at 22 grid and five transect locations with varying degrees of landscape disturbance between 1994 and 2012. We found evidence that the distribution and abundance of woylies over time appears to be related to the degree of fragmentation by roads and proximity to agriculture. Sites furthest from agriculture supported a greater abundance of woylies and had slower rates of population decline. Sites with fewer roads had a greater abundance of woylies generally and a greater rate of increase in abundance after the implementation of invasive predator control. The results of this study suggest that landscape disturbance is less important at peak population densities, but during times of environmental and population change, sites less dissected by roads and agriculture better support woylie populations. This may be due to the role these factors play in increasing the vulnerability of woylies to introduced predators, population fragmentation, weed species invasion, mortality from road collisions or a reduction in available habitat. Strategies that reduce the impact of disturbance on woylie populations could include the rationalisation of <b>forest</b> tracks and <b>consolidation</b> of contiguous habitat through the acquisition of private property. Reducing the impact of disturbance in the Upper Warren region could improve the resilience of this critically important woylie population during future environmental change...|$|R
