60|$|Her route {{was changed}} {{again from the}} main highway, {{rendered}} dangerous by the approach of day and the contiguity of the neighboring rancheros. The road was rough and hilly, her new horse and vehicle {{in keeping with the}} rudeness of the route--by far the most difficult of her whole journey. The rare wagon tracks that indicated her road were often scarcely discernible; at times they led her through openings in the half-cleared woods, skirted suspicious morasses, painfully climbed the smooth, dome-like hills, or wound along perilous slopes at a <b>dangerous</b> <b>angle.</b> Twice she had to alight and cling to the sliding wheels on one of those treacherous inclines, or drag them from impending ruts or immovable mire. In the growing light she could distinguish the distant, low-lying marshes eaten by encroaching sloughs and insidious channels, and beyond them the faint gray waste of the Lower Bay. A darker peninsula in the marsh she knew to be the extreme boundary of her future home: the Rancho de los Cuervos. In another hour she began to descend to the plain, and once more to approach the main road, which now ran nearly parallel with her track. She scanned it cautiously for any early traveler; it stretched north and south in apparent unending solitude. She struck into it boldly, and urged her horse to the top of his speed, until she reached the cross road that led to the rancho. But here she paused and allowed the reins to drop idly on the mustang's back. A singular and unaccountable irresolution seized her. The difficulties of her journey were over; the rancho lay scarcely two miles away; she had achieved {{the most important part of}} her task in the appointed time, but she hesitated. What had she come for? She tried to recall Poindexter's words, even her own enthusiasm, but in vain. She was going to take possession of her husband's property, she knew, that was all. But the means she had taken seemed now so exaggerated and mysterious for that simple end that she began to dread an impending something, or some vague danger she had not considered, that she was rushing blindly to meet. Full of this strange feeling she almost mechanically stopped her horse as she entered the cross road.|$|E
6000|$|Two {{years before}} he {{exhibited}} the young lady in black, in 1879, Mr. Sargent had spent several months in Spain, and here, even {{more than he had}} already been, the great Velasquez became the god of his idolatry. No scenes are more delightful to the imagination than those in which we figure youth and genius confronted with great examples, and if such matters did not belong to the domain of private life we might entertain ourselves with reconstructing the episode of the first visit to the museum of Madrid, the shrine of the painter of Philip IV., of a young Franco-American worshipper of the highest artistic sensibility, expecting a supreme revelation and prepared to fall on his knees. It is evident that Mr. Sargent fell on his knees and that in this attitude he passed a considerable part of his sojourn in Spain. He is various and experimental; if I am not mistaken, he sees each work that he produces in a light of its own, not turning off successive portraits according to some well-tried receipt which has proved useful in the case of their predecessors; nevertheless there is one idea that pervades them all, in a different degree, and gives them a family resemblance--the idea that it would be inspiring to know just how Velasquez would have treated the theme. We can fancy that on each occasion Mr. Sargent, as a solemn preliminary, invokes him as a patron saint. This is not, in my intention, tantamount to saying that the large canvas representing the contortions of a dancer in the lamp-lit room of a posada, which he exhibited on his return from Spain, strikes me as having come into the world under the same star as those compositions of the great Spaniard which at Madrid alternate with his royal portraits. This singular work, which has found an appreciative home in Boston, has the stamp of an extraordinary energy and facility--of an actual scene, with its accidents and peculiarities caught, as distinguished from a composition where arrangement and invention have played their part. It looks like life, but it looks also, to my view, rather like a perversion of life, and has the quality of an enormous [...] "note" [...] or memorandum, rather than of a representation. A woman in a voluminous white silk dress and a black mantilla pirouettes {{in the middle of a}} dusky room, to the accompaniment of her own castanets and that of a row of men and women who sit in straw chairs against the whitewashed wall and thrum upon guitar and tambourine or lift other castanets into the air. She appears almost colossal, and the twisted and inflated folds of her long dress increase her volume. She simpers, in profile, with a long chin, while she slants back at a <b>dangerous</b> <b>angle,</b> and the lamplight (it proceeds from below, as if she were on a big platform) makes a strange play in her large face. In the background the straight line of black-clad, black-hatted, white-shirted musicians projects shadows against the wall, on which placards, guitars, and dirty finger-marks display themselves. The merit of this production is that the air of reality is given in it with remarkable breadth and boldness; its defect it is difficult to express save by saying that it makes the spectator vaguely uneasy and even unhappy--an accident the more to be regretted as a lithe, inspired female figure, given up to the emotion of the dance, is not intrinsically a displeasing object. [...] "El Jaleo" [...] sins, in my opinion, in the direction of ugliness, and, independently of the fact that the heroine is circling round incommoded by her petticoats, has a want of serenity.|$|E

40|$|Intersections are {{typically}} associated with {{a higher level of}} crash risk than other types of facilities on the road network. Standard cross-road intersections are particularly hazardous because by their very design, drivers may travel through at speeds that are incompatible with human biomechanical tolerance should a crash occur. Further, drivers are exposed to <b>dangerous</b> conflict <b>angles,</b> which are likely to result in serious injury. This paper examines the effectiveness of two new intersection designs aimed at restricting potentially <b>dangerous</b> conflict <b>angles</b> while reducing driver speeds through the intersection. These designs, named the “Cut-Through” and the “Squircle”, incorporate key features of both signalised intersections and roundabouts. The intersections are controlled by signals similar to a signalised roundabout. Instead of a standard central island, right turning traffic (equivalent to left turns in jurisdictions that drive on the right) cut through the central island, thereby avoiding traffic interlocks and delays that can occur with the traditional signalised roundabout. Across two driving simulator studies, vehicle speed data were collected on approach to and through each of the proposed intersection designs. Performance was benchmarked against equivalent standard signalised cross-road intersections and standard non-signalised roundabouts. Notably, drivers reduced their speeds by approximately 30 – 40 % when negotiating both the Cut-Through and the Squircle compared to the standard signalised intersections. The safety potentials of the two new intersection designs are discussed within the guidelines of the Safe Systems principles...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{solution}} to the mu/Bmu problem in gauge-mediated SUSY breaking, which does not suffer from the SUSY CP problem and is consistent with the solution to the strong CP problem.

The dynamical scale of the hidden gauge symmetry is set to be around 10 GeV.

5000|$|The 260SE traces {{its history}} to a STOL {{aircraft}} called Skyshark built by Jim Robertson {{in the late}} 1950s. The Skyshark incorporated a number of novel features, most notably a canard fitted with elevators in the slipstream behind the propeller. It was a technological success but too expensive to produce. However, Robertson incorporated many features of the Skyshark into the Wren Aircraft Company's Wren 460. The Wren 460 was a conversion of the Cessna 182 airframe that had full-span double-slotted flaps, movable spoilers to assist the ailerons with roll control and a movable high-lift canard. Later models offered a reversible pitch propeller for steeper approaches, and shorter landing runs. The aircraft was marketed as the only safe STOL aircraft.

It could also make steep turns immediately after take-off. Because of the low approach speed, the Wren was approved for landings under Category II conditions (1/4 mile visibility and 100 foot ceilings on Instrument Landing System approaches). The company was seeking approval for landings under conditions of zero visibility shortly before the company went into bankruptcy in the late 1960s.

40|$|PolyU Library Call No. : [THS] LG 51. H 577 P CEE 2016 LinJXL, 408 pages :color illustrationsCompared with {{horizontal}} axis wind turbines (HAWT), vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT) have the primary advantages of insensitivity to wind direction and turbulent wind, a simpler structure, less fatigue loading, and easy maintenance. As a result, {{a renewed interest}} in VAWTs has been seen in recent years and there is a trend worldwide in building large-scale VAWTs. Nevertheless, VAWTs were not pursued after brief development and failing in the 1980 s, which resulted in a lack of design experience of large-scale VAWTs. Furthermore, VAWTs suffer the disadvantages of low power coefficient and difficulties in self-start and shut-down. Hence, great research efforts are urgently required to make VAWTs workable. In this regard, this thesis is devoted to a systematic and novel study of large-scale VAWTs, which includes the determination of wind loads on all the components of the VAWT using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation, the finite element modelling and model updating of laminated composite blades, the fatigue and ultimate strength analyses of blades and other components of the VAWT, the pitch control systems for four states of the VAWT, the structural health monitoring (SHM) of the VAWT, and the concept of the smart VAWT. To conduct fatigue and ultimate strength analyses, dynamic loads on the whole VAWT must be determined. A practical method of wind load simulation for VAWTs is proposed in this study based on the strip analysis method and the 2 D shear stress transport (SST) k-w model. The validity of 2 D SST k-w model for VAWTs is assessed by comparing simulation results with those obtained by 2. 5 D large eddy simulation (LES). The influences of the tower, arms and turbulent inflow on the aerodynamic forces of the blades are further studied. The results show that the wind pressure and aerodynamic forces simulated by the 2 D SST k-w model match well with those obtained by 2. 5 D LES. The influences of the mean wind speed profile, turbulence, and interaction of all the components can be included in the proposed method at an acceptable computation cost. The influence of the tower is unapparent while the influence of the arms is obvious. The tangential force, and thus the power coefficient, is reduced due to the existence of the arms. The turbulent inflow wind speed causes fluctuation in the wind loads. In addition to wind loads, a precise finite element (FE) model is also needed for the structural analysis. The blades of modern wind turbines are made of laminated composite materials. In this thesis, an FE model of blades is established using laminated shell elements and a micromechanics-based model updating method is proposed to update the laminar elastic constants of the FE model. Analyses of sensitivity and uncertainty are conducted to determine the parameters of micromechanics models to be updated. Static bending tests are conducted and the measured data are used to update the models. The results show that by applying micromechanics models to the process of updating laminar elastic constants, direct identification of these constants can be avoided. In addition, the number of updating parameters can be reduced. It is found that the fiber volume fraction is the most influential parameter with the largest uncertainty for both unidirectional fiber reinforced plastic (UD FRP) and plain weave fiber reinforced plastic (PW FRP). After updating the fiber volume fractions for UP FRP and PW FRP based on the measured strains and displacements, both the calculated local strains and the global displacement match well with the measured data. A framework for the fatigue and ultimate strength analyses of composite blades is proposed. First, a refined FE model of a laminated composite straight blade is established. Based on the FE model, fatigue analyses are conducted and the influences of the ultimate tensile and compressive strains, damping ratio and fundamental frequency on fatigue damage are studied. Ultimate strength analysis at the extreme wind speed is also conducted and the influence of wind direction on the response of blade is considered. The results show that for the specific composite straight blade considered, the locations at the supports and the mid-span of the blade have larger fatigue damage than other positions of the blade. The positions subjected to compressive cyclic loads have the larger fatigue damage than those subjected to tensile cyclic loads. The fatigue damage is sensitive to the damping ratio and fundamental frequency. The critical locations of strength failure are near the supports. The largest interlaminar shear stresses occur near the supports while the largest interlaminar normal stresses occur at the leading edge, not in the support section. A framework for fatigue and ultimate strength analyses of other components of VAWTs is also proposed. A FE model of the VAWT is established by beam elements. The rotating frame method is used to eliminate the rigid motion of the VAWT. Based on the FE model, fatigue and ultimate strength analyses are then conducted. The results show that the largest fatigue damage occurs {{at the root of the}} main arms. The fatigue critical location of the tower is at the bottom. It is found that larger fatigue damage occurs in the leeward side of the tower. For the rotor, the strength failure critical locations are the roots of main arm and the shaft. Assuming that the direction of the extreme wind speed is at the azimuth angle of 0 ⁰, the <b>dangerous</b> azimuth <b>angles</b> of the main arm are 60 ⁰ and 240 ⁰; the <b>dangerous</b> azimuth <b>angles</b> of the shaft are 30 ⁰, 150 ⁰ and 270 ⁰. For the tower, the fatigue critical location is at the bottom and in the leeward side and the <b>dangerous</b> azimuth <b>angles</b> are 30 ⁰, 150 ⁰ and 270 ⁰. Field tests of a straight-bladed VAWT are conducted to validate the proposed frameworks for the fatigue and ultimate strength analyses of VAWTs. The power spectrum densities (PSDs) of the measured responses are calculated under different conditions. Natural frequencies are determined from the peaks of the normalized PSDs of measured responses. The FE model of the VAWT is updated by the identified natural frequencies. By comparing the simulated responses with the corresponding measured data in the frequency domain, it is found that these two results match well with each other. Therefore, the proposed frameworks are validated to some extent. The pitch control system for large-scale VAWTs is proposed. The operation of VAWTs can be divided into four states: start-up above the cut-in wind speed, operation under the rated wind speed, operation above the rated wind speed, and shut-down over the cut-out wind speed. To improve the power generation, self-starting and shut-down performance of straight-bladed VAWTs, two pitch control algorithms,the fixed pitch (in one revolution) and the variable pitch (in one revolution), are studied for the four states using the double multiple streamtube theory (DMST). It is found that the sinusoidal pitch algorithm produces better control results than the fixed pitch algorithm. Based on these studies, a pitch control system is defined. Two sets of data acquisition and processing devices are used, one for the rotating parts and the other for the stationary parts. Furthermore, based on the results of fatigue and ultimate strength analyses, a SHM system is proposed for the VAWT. Anemometers are installed to monitor the wind condition; a tachometer is installed to monitor the rotational speed and the azimuth angle; strains gauges are installed at the critical locations of fatigue and ultimate strength failure to monitor the local deformations; accelerometers are installed to monitor global deformations; and load cells are installed to monitor the service loads. Similar to the control system, two sets of data acquisition and processing devices are used. Synthesizing the SHM system, control system and power supply, a smart VAWT concept is defined. Such a smart VAWT has self-sensing, self-inspecting, self-control and self-power capabilities. Department of Civil and Environmental EngineeringPh.

Great importance in the formation of avalanches play steepness (slope) of the slope and exposure.

According to statistics, the bulk of the avalanche is formed on the slopes steeper than 30 °. In the course of research a 3 D model of the terrain was created with the help of programs ArcGIS and Surfer. Identified areas with steep slopes, the exposure is made to the cardinal. For dangerous terrain location is divided into three groups: favorable zone, danger zone and the zone of increased risk. The range of deviations from 30 - 45 ° is <b>dangerous,</b> since the <b>angle</b> of inclination of more than 30 °, there is a maximum thickness of sliding snow, water, the upper layer of the surface and there is an increase rate of moving array, and the mountain slopes at an angle 450 above are the area increased risk. Created on DTM data are also plotted Weather Service for the winter of current year. The resulting model allows to get information upon request and display it on map base, assess the condition of the terrain by avalanches, as well as to solve the problem of life safety in mountainous areas, to develop measures to prevent emergency situations and prevent human losses...|$|R
40|$|In 2015, {{after several}} years of {{constant}} neighborhood demands, it was inaugurated in the place that was once a vacant lot, the place that takes the name of the neighborhood, the Camp de l’Arpa square. This new public space in the city of Barcelona, despite being an urgent requirement of the neighbours, is currently being underutilized. On a first visit of observation, it was observed that among the many causes of this situation, a significant percentage derived from the materiality of public space: pedestrian traffic is affected by several slopes that form the ground plane; the pavement, is not the best choice for a public space and do not fulfil the requirements of a good finish, is shown aged and deteriorated; curbs and platforms finishing have <b>dangerous</b> <b>angle</b> endings; space design has numerous disadvantages for maintenance; It is not an inclusive place. Faced with these circumstances, the interest emerged to look into how the design of space and materiality could be affecting the frequency of use of the square. Through the expressive and technical analysis of the materials that make up the landscape of this site, it was possible to draw some conclusions that enabled an approach to its problems. Among the problems encountered, it is worth noting how the unevenness of the square, along with the sharp edges of the seat cushions and floor plates, prevent seamless movement of users and generate risk situations. Another analysed inconvenience that influences the lack of interest in staying in place, was the perception of hardness caused by the materials used, combined with an inadequate provision of green components, producing a chromatic low range environment. The use of certain materials, fused with an architectural design that is not functional for a square, make this space an unsustainable and unattractive place for us...|$|E
