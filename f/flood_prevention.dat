5|$|Dayton {{has been}} the home for many patents and inventions since the 1870s. According to the National Park Service, citing {{information}} from the U.S. Patent Office, Dayton had granted more patents per capita than any other U.S. city in 1890 and ranked fifth in the nation as early as 1870. The Wright brothers, inventors of the airplane, and Charles F. Kettering, world-renowned for his numerous inventions, hailed from Dayton. The city was also home to James Ritty's Incorruptible Cashier, the first mechanical cash register, and Arthur E. Morgan's hydraulic jump, a <b>flood</b> <b>prevention</b> mechanism that helped pioneer hydraulic engineering. Paul Laurence Dunbar, an African-American poet and novelist, penned his most famous works in the late 19th century and became {{an integral part of}} the city's history.|$|E
5|$|During construction, {{the need}} for new water and {{electrical}} supply lines arose. Because these were not factored into the original $65million cost, another $5million was appropriated from existing capital funds. Another $5million was later required to pay for cleaning contaminated soil, increased sub-contractor pricing, additional labor costs incurred by delays caused by snow and ice, and upgrades including the guitar-shaped scoreboard. The Sounds ownership team contributed $2million toward the cost of the scoreboard. These and other additional expenditures, such as a $9.5million greenway, $5.6million for street paving, sidewalks, and electrical work, and $3.6million in <b>flood</b> <b>prevention,</b> brought the total construction cost of the stadium to $56million and the total cost of the project to $91million.|$|E
5|$|The Cavendish family {{sold the}} abbey in 1733, at which point, with Cavendish House in ruins, the precinct {{was being used}} as {{agricultural}} land. By the 19th century the abbey {{had come into the}} possession of the Earls of Dysart. Lionel Tollemache, 8th Earl of Dysart, sold the land east of the River Soar (known as Abbey Meadows) in 1876; this was to allow Leicester Town Council to undertake <b>flood</b> <b>prevention</b> work. The part of this land between the river and the Grand Union Canal was developed by the Town Council into a public space known as Abbey Park, which was opened by King Edward VII (then Prince of Wales) in 1882.|$|E

5|$|Following the Olympics, {{there was}} extermely {{limited access to}} the {{waterways}} through the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, and reconstruction of Carpenters Road Lock was delayed. However, the £1.8 million project to rebuild it and fit new radial gates was almost completed by May 2017, when the new gates were craned into position. The Heritage Lottery Fund provided £680,000 towards {{the cost of the}} project, with other grants coming from the London Legacy Development Corporation and the Inland Waterways Association. As well as acting as a lock, the radial gates allow water to be distributed around the Bow Back Rivers for <b>flood</b> <b>prevention</b> purposes. The gates were due to be tested during the summer months, with a formal opening scheduled for the East London Waterways Festival in August. Public access to the waterways around the Olympic Stadium was also due to begin in June or July.|$|E
5|$|On 28 July 2008, the {{pavilion}} {{at the end}} of the Grand Pier was completely destroyed by a fire. Eleven fire engines and 80 firefighters could not contain the blaze, which is believed to have started in the north-east tower of the Pavilion. A competition was held to design a new pavilion, and the project was awarded to the winning architect Angus Meek Architects of Bristol. Construction work began on the pier and new pavilion in 2009, and it was scheduled to reopen in July 2010, after a £39 million rebuilding programme. After continuing problems and setbacks, with the pier not opening until a formal opening ceremony on 23 October 2010, the overall costs have reached £51 million. During the same period there was a £34 million redevelopment of the promenade, including refurbishment of the Marine Lake and pedestrianisation of Pier Square. As part of the work, a scour protection apron and splash wall were added as part of <b>flood</b> <b>prevention</b> measures.|$|E
25|$|<b>Flood</b> <b>prevention</b> schemes have canalised the Kilmarnock (previously the Marnock) Water {{where it}} runs down through Kilmarnock towards the Irvine, with {{significantly}} raised banks and automatically closing gates. The Irvine has likewise been tamed {{with a large}} <b>flood</b> <b>prevention</b> scheme at east Holmes Wetlands near Galston. Here the river is directed into its old floodplains when the water rises above a certain height, thereby protecting Kilamarnock. A scheme on the River Cessnock is underway (2007). Many sections of the other rivers have been canalised and / or have bunds on either bank to prevent the watercourses flooding into their flood plains.|$|E

25|$|Some {{of these}} {{purposes}} are conflicting, and the dam operator {{needs to make}} dynamic tradeoffs. For example, power generation and water supply would keep the reservoir high, whereas <b>flood</b> <b>prevention</b> would keep it low.

50|$|In {{the past}} 200 years, the {{amelioration}} of the area, especially the draining of the marshes, reduced once vastly spread wetland ecosystems in the Pannonian Basin to several patches along the major rivers.

Obsolete ideas of turning the natural streams into canals without gravel or sand in their beds was done allegedly for better sailing and <b>floods</b> <b>prevention.</b> However, in time dozens {{of plant and animal}} species disappeared and even the human population was affected by this process: fish catch diminished and underground waters, used for drinking, were not being purified through the soil anymore.|$|R
25|$|Up to the 1960s, these rivers were {{extremely}} {{prone to flooding}} the city centre area including two disastrous floods in August 1888 (known locally as 'The Great Flood') and in September 1958 (which also badly affected nearby Wickford) causing widespread damage. <b>Flood</b> <b>prevention</b> schemes in the 1960s on both rivers have largely prevented any further incidents here although the natural floodplains {{to the north and}} east such as The 'Baddow Meads' and The 'Chelmer Valley' continue to see flooding on a regular basis especially after prolonged heavy rainfall.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in January 1937, the Ohio River was {{in various}} flood stages for three months. The flood led to river fires when oil tanks in Cincinnati, Ohio were {{destroyed}} in the flood. In Kentucky, one-third of Kenton and Campbell counties were submerged, and 70% of Louisville was under water for over a week. Paducah, Owensboro, and other Purchase area cities were devastated.

500|$|Most of {{the damage}} {{associated}} with Vera {{was a result of}} highly destructive storm surge. At the coast, the typhoon's intensity resulted in a strong storm surge that inundated low-lying coastal regions. In Ise Bay, storm surge heights were greatly enhanced due to the curvature of the land and the bay's shallow depth, which allowed water to be easily driven the length of the bay towards the coast. In addition, the storm passed the area at high tide. Water levels began to rise prior to Vera's landfall and peaked during the typhoon's first traversal of Honshu. The highest storm surge measurement was observed in the Port of Nagoya, where water levels peaked [...] above normal. The intense storm surge easily engulfed or breached earthen levees and other <b>flood</b> <b>prevention</b> mechanisms around Ise Bay. However, these coastal dykes still remained partially unfinished and were seriously impacted by Vera's storm surge. Only newly installed flood mitigation systems along the southern portion of the bay were able to withstand the wave action. Offshore, the waves sunk 25fishing boats, with thousands of other ships grounded or missing. In total, damage was reported to 7,576vessels. In addition to the damaged craft, numerous oyster rafts were also lost, with losses totaling US$6million. Also, 75million individual pearl oysters were lost to the waves, resulting in US$10million in additional losses.|$|E
500|$|The city of Roanoke, Virginia had {{experienced}} a series of major floods that affected. The floods caused by Hurricane Agnes in 1972 prompted a study that would channelize [...] of the Roanoke River to increase water capacity. After the 1985 floods, the city council sought assistance from the USACE to build flood walls and improve river flow to mitigate against future flooding. The agency estimated that the project would cut the damage in half for a flood similar to the 1985 one. The cost for the project was initially project to be $34.4million, of which the city was expected to pay $14.3million. Private land donations and other financial sources provided about $6.8million of the cost, while the remaining $7.5million was covered by a bond, approved in an April 1989 single-issue referendum. This was the first such referendum for the city, and passed with 56.6% in support amid a voter turnout of 19.6%. The bond would be repaid by a 2% raise of the utility tax. Construction began in 1990, and that year a flood warning system was completed. In 1993, Roanoke's raw sewage plant and hospital finished flood proofing. The bulk {{of the project was}} finished in December 2011 when the final terrain cuts were made. When the project was completed, the USGS estimated that the annual damage from flooding decreased from $5.8million to $2.7million, and that the work prevented major floods in November 2009 from Hurricane Ida and January 2013. Also in the state, the General Assembly passed the [...] "Virginia Flood Damage Reduction Act" [...] in 1989, partly due to the flooding from 1985; this coordinated all work related to <b>flood</b> <b>prevention</b> throughout the state into one department.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Because of the {{geographical}} conditions, Taiwan faces serious threats and unpredictable disasters from the nature, such as earthquake, typhoon and flood disaster {{throughout the whole}} year.

Therefore, Taiwan is deeply {{in need of a}} complete and fast precaution mechanism with emergency flood disaster. In general, one of the most ways to prevent flood is pilling sandbags as a temporary barrier right at the water inlet way of each house or basement driveway. This study applies the concept of disaster management to adjudge the <b>flooding</b> <b>prevention</b> treatment, also illustrates the lateral static water pressure measurement and analysis of temporary sandbags barrier facility.
