5|$|One {{plot device}} {{used in the}} pilot, Henry's pocket watch, proved to be {{difficult}} to use in subsequent episodes. In the beginning, the writers would have Henry's pocket watch fall out of <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> so that it would not disappear {{with the rest of his}} body. It became more difficult for writers to develop believable scenarios in which Henry would lose his watch, so they did not write it into the plot as frequently in later episodes.|$|E

5|$|Between 1794 and 1795, in the {{aftermath}} of the French Revolution, the French government briefly mandated decimal clocks, with a day divided into 10hours of 100minutes each. The astronomer and mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace, among other individuals, modified the dial of <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> watch to decimal time. A clock in the Palais des Tuileries kept decimal time as late as 1801, but the cost of replacing all the nation's clocks prevented decimal clocks from becoming widespread. Because decimalized clocks only helped astronomers rather than ordinary citizens, it was one of the most unpopular changes associated with the metric system, and it was abandoned.|$|E

5|$|The {{subsequent}} events {{remain in}} dispute.
