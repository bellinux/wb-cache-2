40|$|In {{the present}} paper we study the {{oscillation}} spectrum of neutron stars containing both ordinary matter and <b>dark</b> <b>energy</b> <b>in</b> different proportions.

The oscillations of the mixed neuron-dark-energy stars are studied in the Cowling approximation.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the generalized Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) ghost model of <b>dark</b> <b>energy</b> <b>in</b> {{the framework of}} Einstein gravity. First, we study the non-interacting generalized ghost <b>dark</b> <b>energy</b> <b>in</b> a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) background. We obtain the equation of state parameter, w_D=p/ρ, the deceleration parameter, and the evolution equation of the generalized ghost <b>dark</b> <b>energy.</b> We find that, in this case, w_D cannot cross the phantom line (w_D>- 1) and eventually the universe approaches a de-Sitter phase of expansion (w_D→- 1). Then, we extend the study to the interacting ghost <b>dark</b> <b>energy</b> <b>in</b> both a flat and non-flat FRW universe. We find that the equation of state parameter of the interacting generalized ghost <b>dark</b> <b>energy</b> can cross the phantom line (w_D<- 1) provided {{the parameters of the}} model are chosen suitably.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamical}} properties and space distribution of <b>dark</b> <b>energy</b> <b>in</b> {{the weak and}} strong gravitational fields caused by inhomogeneities of matter in the static world of galaxies and clusters.

We illustrate also how the "accretion" of the phantom <b>dark</b> <b>energy</b> onto the matter overdensity forms the <b>dark</b> <b>energy</b> underdensity. We analyze the behavior of <b>dark</b> <b>energy</b> <b>in</b> the gravitational fields of stars and black holes with the Schwarzschild metric.
