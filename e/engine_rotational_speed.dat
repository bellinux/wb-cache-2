40|$|Introduction: Nowadays {{the number}} of motor {{vehicles}} in large and small cities is growing. Increasing {{the number of}} motor vehicles leads to serious increase {{of the amount of}} environmental pollution and daily fuel consumption. Motor vehicle emissions that are known as the most air polluting emissions cause 50 - 90 percent of air pollution. With large increasd in the number of motor vehicles and their emissions todays, many researchers have investigated engine optimization in order to reduce emissions of motor vehicles. But {{due to the lack of}} affordable changes in the physical structure of the engine, it is not possible to create major changes in the amount of engine exhaust. Hence, in order to improve engine performance and reduce emissions, a lot of research has been carried out on changes in the fuel and engine inlet air. So, in this study a new method has been proposed and tested in order to detect changes in the charactristics of emissions. So, the effects of enriched nitrous oxide gas on the exhaust emissions of a spark-injection engine were investigated. In this way, a certain amount of Nitrous Oxide (N 2 O) gas was mixed with the engine inlet air (with concentration of 0, 4, 8, 12 and 16 percent) and it was injected to the engine. Then its effect was studied on emission parameters at various engine rotational speeds. Then, by using genetic algorithm, the optimal values of N 2 O concentration and <b>engine</b> <b>rotational</b> <b>speed</b> were determined to reach the minimum emission parameters. Materials and Methods: To measure the engine emission parameters including CO, CO 2, HC and NOx, the expriments were conducted after preparing a system to inject inlet air with different percentages of N 2 O into an Otto engine (model: M 13 NI). In this study, the randomized complete block design was used to investigate the effect of N 2 O concentration (five levels) and <b>engine</b> <b>rotational</b> <b>speed</b> (three levels) on exhauste emission parameters. Each expriment was replicated 9 times. For statistical analysis, Duncan’s multiple range test and multivariate analysis of variance were performed by using SPSS Software. Also, each factor was modeled by polynomial equations and the obtained models were optimized in three dimensions by genetic algorithm method in MATLAB Software. After optimization ofeach emission parameter in the same time by multi-objective optimization regression, separately, and determination of the best value of N 2 O concentration in the inlet air andthe <b>engine</b> <b>rotational</b> <b>speed,</b> the optimizations were compared in order to obtain the minimum value of emission parameters. Results and discussion: The experimental results indicated that by increasing N 2 O concentration in the inlet air of motor vehicle engine, the amounts of CO and HC were significantly decreased and the amounts of CO 2 and NOx were significantly increased. Also, the results of this study showed that increasing the <b>engine</b> <b>rotational</b> <b>speed</b> at the same time with increasing the N 2 O concentration caused a significant decrease in the amounts of CO, CO 2, HC and NOx.

If this happened at low altitude, it would often lead to the total loss of the aircraft.

The dynamic model of the machine is studied in two sections: a simplified model and a complicated model. In both of the models all the acting forces and their effect on the vehicle’s motion are studied and the dynamic behavior of the machine is calculated using mathematical equations. The speed of the machine cannot be controlled by a simple feedback control. It is concluded that a simple feedback controller does not provide the best performance for this application. The gain-scheduled PID controller is used for this application. This Type of controller can adapt itself with the variable dynamic characteristics of the hydraulic system. Gain scheduling is the major key in gain-scheduled PID controller. The results of tuning with different gains are shown and the Bode & step diagrams are presented.

Conventional EGR control system comprises a PI feedback controller for tracking target air mass flow and a feedforward controller for fast response.

The shaking screen was manufactured to have <b>rotational</b> <b>speeds</b> of 370, 470, 570 rpm and winnowing was manufactured to have <b>rotational</b> <b>speeds</b> of 1, 500, 1, 760, 2, 020 rpm by adjusting the pitch circle diameter of each pulley. The sample was prepared based on the yields of an actual self–propelled peanut harvester and analyzed with Statistical Analysis Software after measuring the weight of peanuts and stems. The stem separation ratio was high as 95. 3 % when <b>rotational</b> <b>speeds</b> were 570 rpm (shaking screen) and 2, 020 rpm (winnowing). The peanut loss ratio was low as 0 % when <b>rotational</b> <b>speeds</b> were 370 rpm (shaking screen) and 1, 500 rpm (winnowing). The results indicated that the stem separation ratio was improved with high <b>rotational</b> <b>speeds</b> of shaking screen and winnowing; the peanut loss ratio was reduced with low <b>rotational</b> <b>speeds</b> of shaking screen and winnowing. However, the <b>rotational</b> <b>speed</b> of winnowing did not influence on the peanut loss ratio; as a result, separation performance was improved with low <b>rotational</b> <b>speed</b> of shaking screen and high <b>rotational</b> <b>speed</b> of winnowing. Low <b>rotational</b> <b>speed</b> of shaking screen, however, may cause congestion during process, thus follow–up studies are needed...|$|R
