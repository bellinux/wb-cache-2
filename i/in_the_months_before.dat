Because of limited public interest, newspaper deals were cancelled and parliament refused {{a request for a}} further 25,000kroner. Amundsen mortgaged his house to keep the expedition afloat; heavily in debt, he was now wholly dependent on the expedition's success to avoid personal financial ruin.|$|E

Wolfgang was awarded the honorary title of Konzertmeister (court musician), with a hint that on his return this post would merit a salary.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its path, Domoina left {{thousands}} of people homeless, and caused widespread flooding due to drawing moisture from the Indian Ocean and the Mozambique channel.

Consultation rates {{in each of these}} six months were compared {{with each other and with}} rates reported in a concurrent study of morbidity in general practices. There was a significant excess of consultations for mumps <b>in</b> <b>the</b> six <b>months</b> <b>before</b> onset of diabetes (p < 0. 001), the greatest excess being <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>month</b> <b>before</b> onset. These results support the suggestion that diabetes starting in childhood may result in a small proportion of cases from recent mumps infection...|$|R
5|$|All of the aircrew {{involved}} in the crash had only limited flying time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>before</b> the crash. The B-52's aircrew were apparently unaware that the aircraft had stalled until shortly before impact, indicated by a failure to apply standard recovery techniques to the aircraft once it entered the stall. The investigation reported that, even if the proper stall recovery techniques had been applied, the aircraft was likely too low to recover before hitting the ground.|$|E
5|$|Fuad Muhammad Syafruddin (18 February 1963– 16 August 1996), {{best known}} by his pen name Udin, was an Indonesian {{journalist}} who {{was murdered in}} 1996.

5|$|A {{number of}} events {{had taken place in}} and around Jena <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>before</b> the Barker assault, which the media have {{associated}} with an alleged escalation of local racial tensions. These events included the hanging of rope nooses from a tree in the high school courtyard, two violent confrontations between white and black youths, and the destruction by fire of the main building of Jena High School. Extensive news coverage related to the Jena Six often reported these events as linked. Federal and parish attorneys concluded from their investigations that assessment was inaccurate for some of the events; for instance, the burning of the high school was an attempt to destroy grade records.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, {{the diaries}} of Napoleon's valet, Louis Marchand, were published. His {{description}} of Napoleon <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>before</b> his death led Sten Forshufvud in a 1961 paper in Nature {{to put forward}} other causes for his death, including deliberate arsenic poisoning. Arsenic {{was used as a}} poison during the era because it was undetectable when administered over a long period. Forshufvud, in a 1978 book with Ben Weider, noted that Napoleon's body was found to be well preserved when moved in 1840. Arsenic is a strong preservative, and therefore this supported the poisoning hypothesis. Forshufvud and Weider observed that Napoleon had attempted to quench abnormal thirst by drinking large amounts of orgeat syrup that contained cyanide compounds in the almonds used for flavouring.|$|E
5|$|Labor's convincing win was not unexpected, {{particularly}} as infighting in the LCL had been ongoing {{for over a}} year. Friction was present throughout the campaign as well as before it, {{particularly as}} much of the donations were given directly to the LM. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>before</b> the election LCL members had thrown punches in the corridors of Parliament House. Internal battles between conservatives and LM members for party pre-selection were keenly contested. Around half of the LCL candidates were LM supporters and avoided mention of the LCL and its conservative leader Bruce Eastick in their pamphlets. Some of the LM faction candidates instead trumpeted Hall as their leader and printed books detailing their policies. There was also an incident where a LM function celebrating Wilson's win in the 1972 federal election clashed with Eastick's main policy speech. Eastick and his conservatives arrived at Wilson's dinner after they finished campaigning for the night, but then walked out when Wilson was delivering a speech calling for the LCL to be more tolerant of the diverse opinions within the party. Labor ran a sedate campaign, but made much of the internal LCL divisions.|$|E

5|$|When {{alerted to}} the {{possibility}} of Michael Farrar having been poisoned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>before</b> the fire, detectives investigated the origin of the castor beans that had led to police investigating the September domestic dispute. The label on the seed packets identified them as a product of the Earl May chain of stores. An officer found contact information for the Olathe, Kansas Earl May store in Green's address book. The detectives contacted nearby Earl May stores to find if any employees remembered selling castor beans, which are out of season in the fall. A clerk in Missouri recalled that in September a woman had ordered ten packets of the out-of-season seeds and explained that she needed them for schoolwork. The clerk gave a description of the buyer that corresponded to Green, and tentatively identified her in a photo line-up as the buyer. Register tapes in the store's records showed that a purchase price corresponding to ten packets of castor beans had been rung up on either September 20 or 22. No records were found in any Earl May store of earlier such purchases that would have corresponded to Farrar first having become ill earlier in the year.|$|E
