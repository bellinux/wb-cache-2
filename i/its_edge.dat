5|$|Almost every silver siliqua in the hoard has had <b>its</b> <b>edge</b> {{clipped to}} some degree. This {{is typical of}} Roman silver coin finds of this period in Britain, {{although}} clipped coins are very unusual {{through the rest of}} the Roman Empire. The clipping process invariably leaves the imperial portrait on the front of the coin intact, but often damages the mint mark, inscription, and the image on the obverse.|$|E
5|$|It {{was first}} {{published}} in the United States by W. & S.B. Ives in Salem, Massachusetts on November 25, 1843. Their game was a folding game board with a cloth and cardboard pocket attached {{to the bottom of the}} game board along <b>its</b> <b>edge.</b> In the pocket were the rules, implements, and teetotum. Its teetotum was an ivory dowel sharpened to a point at the bottom end inserted in an octagonal ivory plate. This type of teetotum was referred to as a pin and plate teetotum.|$|E
5|$|None of {{them knew}} {{the color of the}} sky. Their eyes glanced level, and were {{fastened}} upon the waves that swept toward them. These waves were of the hue of slate, save for the tops, which were of foaming white, and all of the men knew the colors of the sea. The horizon narrowed and widened, and dipped and rose, and at all times <b>its</b> <b>edge</b> was jagged with waves that seemed thrust up in points like rocks.|$|E
40|$|A graph is {{crossing}}-critical if its crossing number decreases when we {{remove any}} of <b>its</b> <b>edges.</b> Recently it was proved {{that if a}} non-planar graph G is obtained by adding an edge to a cubic polyhedral (planar 3 -connected) graph, then G can be made crossingcritical by a suitable multiplication of <b>its</b> <b>edges.</b> Here we show: (i) a new family of graphs that can be transformed into crossing-critical graphs by a suitable multiplication of <b>its</b> <b>edges,</b> and (ii) a family of graphs that cannot be made crossing-critical by any multiplication of <b>its</b> <b>edges...</b>|$|R

5|$|The aim of {{the first}} season's depot-laying was to place a series of depots on the Barrier from <b>its</b> <b>edge</b> (Safety Camp) down to 80°S, for use on the polar journey which would begin the {{following}} spring. The final depot would be the largest, and would be known as One Ton Depot. The work was {{to be carried out}} by 12men, the 8fittest ponies, and two dog teams; ice conditions prevented the use of the motor sledges.|$|E
5|$|As {{several other}} supernatural {{entities}} were also {{held responsible for}} bringing hail and torrential rains, when the entity is not explicitly named, it is often impossible to conclude to which the magical measures apply. There was, for example, a custom used when the approach of a thunderstorm was perceived: to bring a {{table in front of}} the house, and to put bread, salt, a knife with a black sheath, and an axe with <b>its</b> <b>edge</b> directed skywards on the table. By another custom, a fireplace trivet with its legs directed skywards, knives, forks, and the stub of the Slava candle were put on the table.|$|E
5|$|England experimented {{briefly with}} milled coinage, but it wasn't until Peter Blondeau brought his method of minting coins {{there in the}} mid-seventeenth century that such coinage began in earnest in that country. Blondeau also invented a {{different}} method of marking the edge, which was, according to him, faster and less costly than the method pioneered by Olivier. Though Blondeau's exact method was secretive, numismatists have asserted that it likely resembled the later device invented by Jean Castaing. Castaing's machine marked the edges by means of two steel rulers, which, when a coinage blank was forced between them, imprinted legends or designs on <b>its</b> <b>edge.</b> Castaing's device found favour in France, and it was eventually adopted in other nations, including Britain and the United States, but it was eventually phased out by mechanised minting techniques.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the critical acclaim, players' response to the game remained deeply mixed over the cel-shaded design. Reception was comparatively warm in Japan, where various media commonly borrow an anime aesthetic, but was much more divided in North America. Some players appreciated the design and Miyamoto's vision for the game, but others criticized the choice. These fans felt that the new design {{was too much of}} a change from the more realistic designs of previous games, and found the new look childish. According to Stephen Totilo of Kotaku, much of the backlash came from a contemporary anxiety among fans that Nintendo was losing <b>its</b> <b>edge</b> by focusing on games for children, as opposed to the more mature, realistic fare developed by competitors.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft has {{integrated}} Cortana into numerous {{products such}} as Microsoft Edge, the browser bundled with Windows 10. Microsoft's Cortana assistant is deeply integrated into <b>its</b> <b>Edge</b> browser. Cortana can find opening-hours when on restaurant sites, show retail coupons for websites, or show weather information in the address bar. At the Worldwide Partners Conference 2015 Microsoft demonstrated Cortana integration with upcoming {{products such as}} GigJam. Conversely, Microsoft announced in late April 2016 that it would block anything other than Bing and Edge from being used to complete Cortana searches, again raising questions of anticompetitive behavior by the company.|$|E
5|$|The forelimbs of Patagosaurus {{are only}} based on three bones from the {{juvenile}} specimen, and no manual elements are preserved. The humeri are slender and elongate, lacking great proximal and distal expansions. The incomplete deltoid crest, only {{shows that it}} was wide, and likely had a projection below and behind. Like the humeri, the radius is slender, and lacks large expansions on either end. On the edge closest to the ulna, the radius possesses a ridge along <b>its</b> <b>edge,</b> which corresponds to where radioulnar ligaments would have attached. The ulna is complete, although sediment-filled breaks might have altered its original shape. The forelimb of Patagosaurus is much more gracile and different from the robust later sauropods like Camarasaurus, and Apatosaurus, and instead resembles more Diplodocus.|$|E

5|$|Leaving Beaver Township, {{the creek}} enters Main Township. It {{continues}} following Catawissa Mountain, and, for a shorter distance, Full Mill Hill. It picks up Gap Run and Fisher Run {{from the left}}, Scotch Run from the right, and Furnace Run from the left in quick succession. After picking up Furnace Run, Catawissa Creek flows between Catawissa Mountain and Nescopeck Mountain in a high, narrow gorge. As the creek leaves the gorge, it passes Mainville and enters a plain. The creek turns west-southwest and the plain narrows slightly. On {{the south side of}} the plain is Catawissa Mountain and on the north side are lower hills. After a few miles, the creek flows out of Main Township and into Catawissa Township. In Catawissa Township, the creek flows southwest to Catawissa. It follows the southern border of Catawissa until it reaches <b>its</b> <b>edge</b> and turns northwards, following the western border of Catawissa. Pennsylvania Route 487 crosses over the creek at this point. At the western edge of Catawissa, the creek empties into the Susquehanna River.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} for a coin to land on <b>its</b> <b>edge,</b> usually by landing up against an object (such as a shoe) or by getting stuck in the ground. However, even {{on a flat surface}} it {{is possible}} for a coin to land on <b>its</b> <b>edge,</b> with a chance of about 1 in 6000 for an American nickel. Angular momentum typically prevents most coins from landing on their edges unsupported if flipped. Such cases in which a coin does land on <b>its</b> <b>edge</b> are exceptionally rare and in most cases the coin is simply re-flipped.|$|E
