5|$|When collected, {{the skin}} of the cap is left intact, and dirt is brushed off the surface. Pores are left unless old and soft. Boletus aereus is {{especially}} suited for drying, a process which enhances its flavour and aroma. Like other boletes, the mushrooms can be dried by being sliced and strung separately on twine, then hung close to the ceiling of a kitchen. Alternatively, the mushrooms can be dried by cleaning with a brush (washing is not recommended), and then placed in a wicker basket or bamboo steamer on top of a boiler or hot water tank. Once dry, they are kept <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> jar. They are easily reconstituted by soaking in hot, but not boiling, water for about twenty minutes; the water is infused with the mushroom aroma and can be used as stock in subsequent cooking. When dried, a small amount of the mushroom can improve the taste of less flavoursome fungi-based dishes.|$|E
25|$|Leftover {{decorated}} pavlova can be refrigerated overnight, but {{the dessert}} will absorb moisture and lose its crispness. Undecorated pavlova {{can be left}} overnight in the oven, or for several days <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> container, to be decorated when ready.|$|E
25|$|Most {{microorganisms}} {{found in}} cannabis only affect plants and not humans, but some microorganisms, {{especially those that}} proliferate when the herb is not correctly dried and stored, can be harmful to humans. Some users may store marijuana <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> bag or jar in a refrigerator to prevent fungal and bacterial growth.|$|E

50|$|The later challenge, popularised in November 2015, {{involves}} {{filling a}} condom {{with water and}} filming it being dropped on one's head. This often results in the condom enveloping and adhering to the participant's face, giving {{the impression that they}} have somehow became immersed in the water held within the condom. The Guardian newspaper noted the danger <b>in</b> putting <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> seal over one's nose and mouth.|$|R
50|$|Kurnaz {{was also}} put in solitary {{confinement}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> windowless refrigerator and subjected to hypothermia. He was caged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> container <b>in</b> the Cuban sun baking in extreme heat, and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> small <b>airtight</b> box so that over hours and days he suffocated slowly. He was starved or force-fed; subjected to sexual humiliation; and beaten constantly.|$|R
25|$|Mick died on 6 May 1939, a {{few weeks}} short of his thirteenth birthday, having amassed around £20,000 in stud fees, from {{appearances}} in films, and in prize money. After his death he was stuffed and given by his last owner, A.H. Kempton, to the Natural History Museum in London; he has since been moved to the Natural History Museum at Tring in Hertfordshire where he is still on public view. He stands in cabinet 58 of the household dogs section at the museum <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> case filled with an insecticide called Vapona {{in order to prevent}} any damage by insects.|$|E
25|$|Coffee is best stored <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> {{container}} made of ceramic, glass, or non-reactive metal. Higher quality prepackaged coffee {{usually has}} a one-way valve which prevents air from entering while allowing the coffee to release gases. Coffee freshness and flavor is preserved {{when it is}} stored away from moisture, heat, and light. The ability of coffee to absorb strong smells from food means {{that it should be}} kept away from such smells. Storage of coffee in the refrigerator is not recommended due to the presence of moisture which can cause deterioration. Exterior walls of buildings which face the sun may heat the interior of a home, and this heat may damage coffee stored near such a wall. Heat from nearby ovens also harms stored coffee.|$|E
25|$|The {{storage of}} pasta {{depends on how}} far along it is processed. Uncooked pasta is kept dry and can sit in the {{cupboard}} for a year if airtight and stored in a cool, dry area. Cooked pasta is stored {{in the refrigerator for}} a maximum of five days <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> container. Adding a couple teaspoons of oil helps keep the food from sticking to itself and the container. If the cooked pasta is not used in the five days it may be frozen for up to two or three months. The pasta will start to dry after a period of time, but it varies with the type of pasta. Should the pasta be dried completely, it can be placed back in the cupboard.|$|E
50|$|Damask {{rose petals}} and sugar are placed <b>in</b> layers <b>in</b> <b>a</b> wide-mouthed <b>airtight</b> glass jar. The jar {{is exposed to}} {{sunlight}} for six hours per day for around three to four weeks. On alternate days, {{the contents of the}} jar are stirred with a wooden stick. When the process is complete, the gulkand is kept indoors <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tightly sealed container.|$|R

50|$|The factory on Sturt Street, between Russell and Norman streets, was by 1875 {{turning out}} 30 tons of soap and 6 tons of candles per week. The process of boiling down fat and tallow {{produces}} some particularly foul odours, and Tidmarsh was diligent in reducing this nuisance {{to a minimum}} by ventilating the vats through charcoal or quicklime. The lees were transported away from the factory <b>in</b> <b>a</b> large <b>airtight</b> container on wheels, to be dumped at some remote location.|$|R
25|$|Being a {{phosphate}} mineral, turquoise {{is inherently}} fragile and sensitive to solvents; perfume and other cosmetics will attack the finish and may alter the colour of turquoise gems, as will skin oils, as will most commercial jewellery cleaning fluids. Prolonged exposure to direct sunlight may also discolour or dehydrate turquoise. Care {{should therefore be}} taken when wearing such jewels: cosmetics, including sunscreen and hair spray, should be applied before putting on turquoise jewellery, and {{they should not be}} worn to a beach or other sun-bathed environment. After use, turquoise should be gently cleaned with a soft cloth to avoid a buildup of residue, and should be stored in its own container to avoid scratching by harder gems. Turquoise can also be adversely affected if stored <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> container.|$|E
500|$|Like other boletes, porcini can be dried {{by being}} strung {{separately}} on twine and hung {{close to the}} ceiling of a kitchen. Alternatively, the mushrooms can be dried by cleaning with a brush (washing is not recommended), and then placing them in a wicker basket or bamboo steamer {{on top of a}} boiler or hot water tank. Another method is drying in an oven at [...] for two to three hours, then increasing the temperature to [...] until crisp or brittle. Once dry, they are kept <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> jar. Importantly for commercial production, porcini retain their flavour after industrial preparation in a pressure cooker or after canning or bottling, and are thus useful for manufacturers of soups or stews. The addition of a few pieces of dried porcino can significantly add to flavour, and they are a major ingredient of the pasta sauce known as carrettiere (carter's sauce). The drying process is known to induce the formation of various volatile substances that contribute to the mushroom's aroma. Chemical analysis has shown that the odour of the dried mushroom is a complex mixture of 53 volatile compounds.|$|E

He would later lose to Warrior in the first ever body bag challenge in WWF history. At King of the Ring 1991, Undertaker defeated Animal in a qualifying match before fighting Sid Vicious to a double disqualification in the Semi-Final, which saw both men eliminated from the King of the Ring tournament.|$|E
2500|$|Most flares, {{like the}} MJU-27A/B flares, {{must be kept}} <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> storage {{compartment}} before deployment. These flares, known as pyrophoric flares, are made of special materials that ignite {{when they come in}} contact with the air. This is a safety and convenience factor, since attempting to ignite a flare inside [...] the fuselage and then deploying it is risky. However pyrotechnic flares (such as the MJU-32) also exist, and offer their own safety benefit; requiring an external ignition method, an accidental leak or puncture in the storage compartment would not result in a catastrophic fire on board the aircraft as with a pyrophoric flare.|$|E
2500|$|Based {{on these}} {{descriptions}} and the Byzantine sources, John Haldon and Maurice Byrne designed a hypothetical apparatus as consisting of three main components: a bronze pump, {{which was used}} to pressurize the oil; a brazier, used to heat the oil (πρόπυρον, propyron, [...] "pre-heater"); and the nozzle, which was covered in bronze and mounted on a swivel (στρεπτόν, strepton). The brazier, burning a match of linen or flax that produced intense heat and the characteristic thick smoke, was used to heat oil and the other ingredients <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> tank above it, a process that also helped to dissolve the resins into a fluid mixture. The substance was pressurized by {{the heat and the}} usage of a force pump. After it had reached the proper pressure, a valve connecting the tank with the swivel was opened and the mixture was discharged from its end, being ignited at its mouth by some source of flame. The intense heat of the flame made necessary the presence of heat shields made of iron (βουκόλια, boukolia), which are attested in the fleet inventories.|$|E
30|$|The raw banana peels were {{collected}} from a local fruit market in Burdwan town. The materials were washed repeatedly with deionized water to remove soluble dust. The banana peels were allowed to dry in the sun for 5  h followed by hot air oven at 70  °C for 24  h (Fig. S 1 a and S 1 b). The dried fish scales were ground and sieved through metallic sieves ranging from 100 to 150  µm.

2500|$|UHT, {{also known}} as ultra-heat-treating, {{processing}} holds the milk at a temperature of 140°C (284°F) for four seconds. During UHT processing milk is sterilized and not pasteurized. This process lets consumers store milk or juice for several months without refrigeration. The process is achieved by spraying the milk or juice through a nozzle into a chamber filled with high-temperature steam under pressure.

2500|$|Quality {{gasoline}} {{should be}} stable {{for six months}} if stored properly but gasoline will break down slowly over time due to {{the separation of the}} components. Gasoline stored for a year will most likely be able to be burned in an internal combustion engine without too much trouble but the effects of long term storage will become more noticeable with each passing month until a time comes when the gasoline should be diluted with ever-increasing amounts of freshly made fuel so that the older gasoline may be used up. If left undiluted, improper operation will occur and this may include engine damage from misfiring and/or the lack of proper action of the fuel within a fuel injection system and from an onboard computer attempting to compensate (if applicable to the vehicle). Storage should be <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> container (to prevent oxidation or water vapors mixing in with the gas) that can withstand the vapor pressure of the gasoline without venting (to prevent the loss of the more volatile fractions) at a stable cool temperature (to reduce the excess pressure from liquid expansion, and to reduce the rate of any decomposition reactions). When gasoline is not stored correctly, gums and solids may be created, which can corrode system components and accumulate on wetted surfaces, resulting in a condition called [...] "stale fuel". Gasoline containing ethanol is especially subject to absorbing atmospheric moisture, then forming gums, solids, or two phases (a hydrocarbon phase floating on top of a water-alcohol phase).|$|E
2500|$|Swammerdam {{played a}} key role in the debunking of the balloonist theory, the idea that 'moving spirits' are {{responsible}} for muscle contractions. [...] The idea, supported by the Greek physician Galen, held that nerves were hollow and the movement of spirits through them propelled muscle motion. René Descartes furthered the idea by basing it on a model of hydraulics, suggesting that the spirits were analogous to fluids or gasses and calling them 'animal spirits'. In the model, which Descartes used to explain reflexes, the spirits would flow from the ventricles of the brain, through the nerves, and to the muscles to animate the latter. [...] According to this hypothesis, muscles would grow larger when they contract because of the animal spirits flowing into them. [...] To test this idea, Swammerdam placed severed frog thigh muscle <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airtight</b> syringe with a small amount of water in the tip. [...] He could thus determine whether there was a change in the volume of the muscle when it contracted by observing a change in the level of the water (image at right). When Swammerdam caused the muscle to contract by irritating the nerve, the water level did not rise but rather was lowered by a minute amount; this showed that no air or fluid could be flowing into the muscle. [...] Swammerdam did not believe the results of his own experiment, suggesting that they were the result of artifact. [...] However, he concluded in his book The Book of Nature II that [...] "motion or irritation of the nerve alone is necessary to produce muscular motion". [...] This idea that nerve stimulation led to movement had important implications for neuroscience by putting forward the idea that behavior is based on stimuli.|$|E
