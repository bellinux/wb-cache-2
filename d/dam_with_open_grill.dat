50|$|In {{electric}} ovens, grilling may {{be accomplished}} by placing the food near the upper heating element, with the lower heating element off and the oven door partially <b>open.</b> <b>Grilling</b> in an electric oven may create {{a large amount of}} smoke and cause splattering in the oven. Both gas and electric ovens often have a separate compartment for grilling, such as a drawer below the flame or one of the stove top heating elements.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the thermal {{behaviour}} of a rainscreen ventilated facade {{has been investigated}} both experimentally and numerically. Field measurements were performed during the 2009 / 10 winter season in a test building located in San Mauro Pascoli (Italy) having a squared base of internal dimension of 2. 89 m and a total internal height of 7. 75 m. The external walls of this tower are rainscreen ventilated facades with a 24 cm air cavity and an external side composed of stoneware <b>with</b> <b>open</b> joints. Ventilation <b>grills</b> are located {{at the top and}} {{at the bottom of the}} tower. In this work the modelling of the test building using a dynamic thermal simulation program (ESP-r) is presented and the main results discussed. In order to study the rainscreen ventilated facade three different multi-zone models were defined and the comparison with the experimental results has been used in order to select the best ESP-r air flow network for the modelling of this kind of envelope component. The thermal analysis of this envelope component evidenced that the ventilated facade is able to reverse the direction of the heat flux through the envelope in regions characterized by large solar irradiation during the winter and moderate wind velocity, when the indoor-outdoor air temperature difference is small, thereby reducing the energy consumption required for indoor heating...|$|R
40|$|Rubber dams are {{flexible}} hydraulic structures {{consisting of}} a rubberized fabric dam body, a concrete foundation, a control room housing mechanical and electrical equipment and an inlet/outlet piping system. These dams have become popular because of the following advantages: long span and adaptable to different side slopes; short construction period; easy maintenance and repair; low project life cycle cost; earthquake resistant; adaptable to adverse conditions; and environmentally friendly. To increase their competitiveness for a larger share in the international market, manufacturers, in cooperation with research and development institutions, are developing new types of high performance rubber dams {{to meet the needs}} of more demanding application conditions. New rubber dam types that are drawing interest are as follows: rubber <b>dams</b> <b>with</b> inspection gallery; rubber <b>dams</b> <b>with</b> different deflation modes; inflatable <b>dams</b> <b>with</b> steel plate; innovative fish-way; rubber <b>dams</b> <b>with</b> flood mitigation and safety; <b>dams</b> <b>with</b> increasing water storage capacity and power output; dams that reduce sediment problems; <b>dams</b> <b>with</b> irrigation and water supply; <b>dams</b> <b>with</b> ground water recharge; <b>dams</b> <b>with</b> navigation; and <b>dams</b> <b>with</b> water environment improvement...|$|R

Other popular options include the club's fresh oysters, BBQ ribs, udon, fish tacos, Korean short ribs, and pork buns.

50|$|Grilling {{is a form}} {{of cooking}} that {{involves}} dry heat applied to the surface of food, commonly from above or below. Grilling usually involves a significant amount of direct, radiant heat, and tends to be used for cooking meat quickly. Food to be grilled is cooked on a <b>grill</b> (an <b>open</b> wire grid such as a gridiron with a heat source above or below), a grill pan (similar to a frying pan, but with raised ridges to mimic the wires of an <b>open</b> <b>grill),</b> or griddle (a flat plate heated from below).|$|R

40|$|We present {{four new}} {{findings}} pertaining to MEMS sensors for acoustic emission detection. Our sensors are resonant-type capacitive transducers, operating with a frequency between 100 kHz and 500 kHz, fabricated in the PolyMUMPS process. The sensitivity of a resonant transducer {{is related to}} the sharpness of its resonance, measured by the quality factor Q, and operating in a coarse vacuum will increase Q. We describe a practical laboratory method for sealing and evacuating our MEMS sensor, and present measurements showing Q in the evacuated packages to be 2. 4 to 3. 6 times greater than under atmospheric pressure. We also describe our theoretical analysis of noise sources in the electromechanical behavior of a resonant, capacitive-type transducer sensitive to out-of-plane motion, with particular interest in noise resulting from mechanical excitation of the moving plate by air molecule impact. We report on a new transducer design to sense out-of-plane motion featuring a moving plate constructed as an <b>open</b> <b>grill</b> rather than as a plate perforated by etch holes. Characterization measurements show the <b>open</b> <b>grill</b> design to have a higher Q than a comparable perforated plate transducer. Finally, we report on another novel transducer designed to sense in-plane motion. The sensor is a comb finger capacitive transducer, and theoretical predications predict the in-plane sensor to have a much higher Q than the out-of-plane sensors. We show experimental measurements confirming these design characteristics, and we show results from pencil lead break experiments...|$|R

40|$|This study investigates {{transient}} seepage using a {{two-phase flow}} scheme in finite difference code, FLAC. The saturation of {{pore water pressure}} distribution and {{the stability of the}} assumed landslide dams are calculated. The safety factors of the assumed landslide dams are evaluated using the strength reduction technique. The results show that when we increase the saturated permeability of the dam materials, dam failure occurs earlier than those <b>dams</b> <b>with</b> smaller saturated permeability. When the slope angles of the dams are small, the timing of failure is slower than those <b>dams</b> <b>with</b> large slope angles. However, the durations of the failure process of <b>dams</b> <b>with</b> smaller slope angle are shorter than those of <b>dams</b> <b>with</b> larger slope angles. When the peak intensity of rainfall is higher, dams are less stable. 本文以FLAC 有限差分軟體之二相流模式進行非飽和土壤暫態滲流分析，計算不同時間下所假設之堰塞壩的飽和度與孔隙水壓分布。假設之堰塞壩體穩定性則以強度折減法計算其安全係數。由結果顯示，壩體材料滲透性增加，壩體破壞之時間越早。坡度較小的堰塞壩之邊坡穩定影響時間較慢，但從穩定到滑動破壞之時間比坡角大者短。尖峰降雨強度越大，壩體越趨不穩定...|$|R
