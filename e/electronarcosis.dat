5000|$|According to the law, animals {{should be}} stunned into {{unconsciousness}} {{prior to their}} slaughter to ensure a death with less suffering than in killing methods used earlier. The most common methods are electrocution and CO2 stunning for swine and captive bolt stunning for cattle, sheep, and goats. Of these methods of electrocution, <b>electronarcosis</b> has been widely acclaimed as the safest, most humane and most reliable {{as well as the}} surest way to stun the animal and render them insensitive to pain. Organizations such as the Egyptian Fatwa Committee have mutually agreed to this method when of keeping the standards of Halal a concern. <b>Electronarcosis</b> does not infringe on these standards for Halal. Frequent on-site monitoring is necessary, as is the employment of skilled and well-trained personnel. An animal is considered properly stunned when there is no [...] "righting reflex"; that is, the animal must not try to stand up and right themself. Only then can they be considered fully unconscious.

Regulations include that the animal be completely insensitive to pain before killing it, typically by a technique like <b>electronarcosis.</b>|$|E

In 1915, Giuseppe Epifanio tried barbiturate-induced sleep therapy in a psychiatric clinic in Italy, but his reports made little impact. <b>Electronarcosis</b> was also developed and used for various psychiatric disorders, involving current passed through the brain to induce deep sleep.|$|E
50|$|The Humane Slaughter Act, or the Humane Methods of Livestock Slaughter Act, (P.L. 85-765; 7 U.S.C. 1901 et seq.) is a United States {{federal law}} {{designed}} to decrease suffering of livestock during slaughter. It was approved on August 27, 1958. The most notable of these requirements {{is the need}} to have an animal completely sedated and insensible to pain. This is to minimize the suffering {{to the point where the}} animal feels nothing at all, instead losing a consciousness from which they will never awaken. This differs from animal to animal as size increases and decreases. Larger animals such as bovines require a stronger method than chickens, for example. Bovines require <b>electronarcosis</b> or something equally potent, though <b>electronarcosis</b> remains a standard. The bovine would have a device placed on their head that, once activated, sends an electric charge that efficiently and safely stuns them. Chickens, on the other hand, require much less current to be efficiently sedated and are given a run under electrically charged water. To ensure that these guidelines are met, The Food Safety and Inspection Service inspectors at slaughtering plants are responsible for overseeing compliance, and have the authority to stop slaughter lines and order plant employees to take corrective actions. Although more than 168 million chickens (excluding broilers) and around 9 billion broiler chickens are killed for food in the United States yearly, the Humane Slaughter Act specifically mentions only cattle, calves, horses, mules, sheep and swine.|$|E

Eisnitz argues that this is not only cruel to the animals but also dangerous for the human workers, as cows weighing several thousands of pounds thrashing around in pain are likely to kick out and debilitate anyone working near them.This would imply that certain slaughterhouses throughout the country are not following the guidelines and regulations spelled out by the Humane Slaughter Act, requiring all animals to be put down and thus insusceptible to pain by some form, typically <b>electronarcosis,</b> before undergoing any form of violent action.|$|E
50|$|In some {{communities}} animal slaughter and permitted species may {{be controlled by}} religious laws, most notably halal for Muslims and kashrut for Jewish communities. This can cause conflicts with national regulations when a slaughterhouse adhering {{to the rules of}} religious preparation is located in some Western countries. In Jewish law, captive bolts and other methods of pre-slaughter paralysis are generally not permissible, due to it being forbidden for an animal to be stunned prior to slaughter. Various halal food authorities have more recently permitted the use of a recently developed fail-safe system of head-only stunning where the shock is non-fatal, and where it is possible to reverse the procedure and revive the animal after the shock. The use of <b>electronarcosis</b> and other methods of dulling the sensing has been approved by the Egyptian Fatwa Committee.

50|$|There {{has been}} {{controversy}} {{over whether or}} not animals should be slaughtered and over the various methods used. Some people believe sentient beings should not be harmed regardless of the purpose, or that meat production is an insufficient justification for harm. Religious slaughter laws and practices have always been a subject of debate, and the certification and labeling of meat products remain to be standardized. Animal welfare concerns are being addressed to improve slaughter practices by providing more training and new regulations. There are differences between conventional and religious slaughter practices, although both have been criticized on grounds of animal welfare. Concerns about religious slaughter focus on the stress caused during the preparation stages before the slaughtering, pain and distress that may be experienced during and after the neck cutting and the worry of a prolonged period of time of lost brain function during the points between death and preparation if a stunning technique such as <b>electronarcosis</b> is not applied.|$|E
5000|$|Opponents of dhabīḥah ḥalāl, {{most notably}} some animal welfare groups, contend that some methods of {{slaughter}} [...] "cause severe suffering to animals" [...] compared {{to when the}} animal is stunned before slaughter, {{which is why the}} Egyptian Fatwaa Committee has agreed to the <b>electronarcosis.</b> In the United Kingdom, the government funded an independent advisory body Farm Animal Welfare Council but recommended that conventional dhabīḥah (along with kosher slaughter (sheḥitah)) without prior stunning be abolished. The FAWC chairwoman of the time, Dr Judy MacArthur Clark, said, [...] "This is a major incision into the animal and to say that it doesn't suffer is quite ridiculous."

50|$|According to Islamic tradition, {{the animal}} is brought {{to the place of}} {{slaughter}} and laid down gently so as to not injure it. It is Sunnah but not Fard that the head of the animal be facing the Qiblah. The blade must be kept hidden until the very last moment while the jugular of {{the animal is}} felt. The conventional method used to slaughter the animal involves cutting the large arteries in the neck along with the esophagus and trachea with one swipe of a non-serrated blade. Care must be taken that the nervous system is not damaged, as this may cause the animal to die before exsanguination has taken place. During the swipe of the blade, the head must not be decapitated. While blood is draining, the animal is not handled until it has died. While this is an acceptable method, the Egyptian Fatwaa Committee has agreed that an animal can be rendered insensible to pain via <b>electronarcosis</b> and still be halal. It's also important to note that these guidelines also respect the laws in place by the United States government to allow the practice to be permissible in the United States.|$|E

Very little work has been published on Atlantic sturgeon reproduction in the James River, Virginia. To aid the recovery of James River Atlantic sturgeon, aspects of life history need to be addressed. To increase understanding of Atlantic sturgeon life history a length at age model was created to show population structure and age of sexual maturity. Telemetry experiments were conducted to determine what types of boats are likely to cause boat strike mortalities of adult fish during a spawning season. Morphometrics, sperm characteristics, and telemetry data were used to determine if Atlantic sturgeon have a fall spawning season. Strontium/calcium ratio analysis was conducted on Atlantic sturgeon fin spines to better understand migration patterns. Cortisol levels were examined in Atlantic sturgeon exposed to MS 222, <b>electronarcosis</b> or no anesthetic 1 and 24 hr after a small incision mimicking tag implantation.

Ethical considerations recommend the use of anesthetics for tissue sampling. This study examines how anesthetics affect stable isotope ratios of fish compared with other euthanasia methods. MethodsRainbow trout fry and juveniles were sacrificed using ice-freezing (as this common method used to kill fish does not affect natural isotopic ratios), <b>electronarcosis</b> or an overdose of chemical anesthetics (2 -phenoxyethanol, benzocaine and clove oil). For fry, we sampled the whole animal whereas, for juveniles, white dorsal muscle, liver, red blood cells, plasma, external tegument and pectoral fin were sampled. Isotopic ratios and the elemental compositions of carbon {{and nitrogen}} were then measured. ResultsThe δ 15 N values, and the C and N contents of all considered tissues as well as δ 13 C values of muscle, liver, red blood cells and plasma, were not affected {{by the use of}} chemical anesthetics. Clove oil {{and to a lesser extent}} 2 -phenoxyethanol and benzocaine decreased δ 13 C values of whole fry and juvenile external tegument and pectoral fin. The use of <b>electronarcosis</b> drastically affects the δ 13 C and δ 15 N values of all fish tissues. ConclusionsAnesthetics should be avoided for δ 13 C analysis when tissues are in contact with the water containing the anesthetic. Ice-immersion has to be preferred when approved by guidelines. If not, benzocaine and 2 -phenoxyethanol should be preferred over clove oil. <b>Electronarcosis</b> should not be used to kill fish until further investigations are performed...|$|E

40|$|Part I In {{studying}} {{the effect of}} <b>electronarcosis</b> on the secretory activity of the pituitary gland, <b>electronarcosis</b> {{has been applied to}} guinea pigs and dogs. Increased secretion of the thyrotropic, adrenocorticotropic and gonadotropic hormones has been shown to result from this passage of electric current through the head of the animal. These increases {{have been shown to be}} reversible upon discontinuing the <b>electronarcosis</b> series. The "tropic" activity following <b>electronarcosis</b> has been shown to be endocrine in nature by demonstrating that in dogs the blood serum shows a marked increase in its ability to produce hypertrophy in the thyroids, adrenals, and testes of day-old chicks. In guinea pigs a marked elevation of the basal metabolic rate occurs, subsequent to <b>electronarcosis.</b> In view of the short latency of this response it has been suggested that the increased B. M. R. results from an increased production of a substance such as the specific metabolic principle described by O'Donovan and Collip. The symptoms observed during <b>electronarcosis</b> in guinea pigs have been described. Part II The musculature of the legs of spiders of several species has been studied. For the most part the work of Petrunkevitch has been confirmed by anatomical observation and physiological experimentation; however, one and possibly two heretofore undescribed muscles are reported. The function of these muscles has not been demonstrated physiologically, but from their structural arrangement they may have a role in raising the chitinous horseshoe-shaped plate in the femoro-patellar and tibia-metatarsal joints respectively. An histological study of the leg muscles in spiders has shown them to consist of long, striated, multinucleate fibers loosely associated in parallel groups to form the respective muscles; that is to say, the fibers run parallel from origin to insertion for the full length of the muscle. Distribution of the arterial supply in the legs has been found to be quite extensive. Branching and re-branching of the main artery results in an elaborate arborization intimately distributed throughout the muscles. A discuss ion is presented which indicates that in those joints which characteristically lack extensor muscles extension is carried out by means of an hydraulic mechanism. Two possible mechanisms are suggested; the one considered most probable involves partially closing off the main arterial stem, thereby diverting a greater amount of blood into the membranous pocket formed by the thin flexible interarticular membrane of the ventral surface of the joint. Extension is thus a purely mechanical result of the pressure exerted by the balooning-out of the membrane. Part III The effectiveness with which different contractions in a number of muscles can be inhibited was investigated. As a measure of this effectiveness the frequency of inhibition which can just inhibit a contraction with a given frequency of excitation was determined. It was found that in all system the ratio (Rc) of such inhibitory frequencies to that of the excitatory frequencies they can suppress was constant for a wide range of frequencies. At high frequencies either the inhibition or the excitation may become less effective. This is explained by failure of the respective system to function normally at such a frequency. The effectiveness of inhibition of different systems was determined. Some systems show a very constant Rc value; in a second group Rc varies within wider limits; and a third group shows two distinct Rc's sometimes in the same preparation at different times. Rc values have been found to vary widely. For instance, in the bender inhibitor slow bender system of Paehygrapsus three excitatory impulses are suppressed by one inhibitory impulse; in the closer inhibitor-slow closer system of Cambarus one excitatory impulse needs five inhibitory impulses to counteract its effect. The fast closer contraction of Cambarus and the fast closer and fast bender contraction of Paehygrapsus were found to be uninhibitable; i. e. no effect of inhibition whatsoever was noticed on any of these contractions. All three systems are distinguished by giving a mechanical response to a single stimulus in contrast with all the inhibitable systems which do not respond to single impulses. Reduction of the action potentials during inhibition is obtainable in only a few systems, namely, the opener inhibitor-opener and the stretcher inhibitor-stretcher systems of Cambarus and the crabs. (In the crabs this applies only to the 'true' inhibitors.) In all other systems, including every system of Panulirus, no reduction of the muscle action potential is obtained. </p...|$|E

40|$|Nonlethal electroshocking {{devices have}} been {{developed}} at the Denver Wildlife Research Center for repelling aquatic mammals and birds from selected areas. These devices are augmented with infrared motion sensors {{to turn on the}} apparatus only when warm-blooded animals are present, thereby conserving electrical energy and allowing battery operation. Electronic safety controls are incorporated to prevent animals from being over-exposed or repeatedly exposed to the electrical fields. The technical basis for this equipment is based upon research originally reported in the electrofishing literature. Obviously, any animal immersed in water is highly susceptible to electrical shock, but permanent injury can be avoided by controlling the intensity of the electrical energy. As the intensity of the electrical field is increased, the severity of the electrical shock experienced by an animal is known to progress through several stages including mild initiation, extreme agitation, <b>electronarcosis</b> (an unconscious state), tetany (characterized by muscular rigidity), and death. Fortunately, with proper engineering, in-water electroshocking apparatus can be designed to limit the degree of electrical shock to the desired threshold. Additionally, controlled studies with fish provide evidence that there is a predictable relationship between the intensity of the electrical shock and the magnitude of the electrical power transferred from the water into the fish.

40|$|Abstract: An {{investigation}} {{was performed to}} determine whether high concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO 2) at 70 - 98 % in atmospheric air are a suitable alternative for stunning rabbits compared to conventional approaches such as <b>electronarcosis.</b> Aversion to the gas and efficacy in causing prolonged unconsciousness and death were studied {{in a total of}} 480 rabbits by means of behavioural parameters, physiological indicators (presence of rhythmic breathing and corneal reflex) and electroencephalography (EEG, brain function). The use of any of the 4 studied concentrations of the gas caused more nasal discomfort and vocalisations than the use of atmospheric air (P< 0. 001). EEG activity confirmed that loss of posture is a good indicator of the onset of unconsciousness in rabbits exposed to CO 2, occurring earlier (P< 0. 05) at 90 and 98 % than at 70 and 80 %. Rabbits showed signs of aversion for 15 s before the onset of unconsciousness, which occurred around 30 s after the beginning of the exposure to the gas, similar to species such as swine in which high concentrations of CO 2  are also used for stunning. CO 2  at 80 to 98 % is suggested as a reasonable concentration range to induce a long state of unconsciousness and death in rabbits, while 70 % CO 2  is not recommended because it requires too long duration of exposure (more than 360 s) to ensure effectiveness. Despite the advantages in terms of pre-stun handling and irreversibility, CO 2  is not free of animal welfare concerns. In consequence, a debate is necessary to ascertain if CO 2  can be considered a suitable alternative to stun rabbits, considering the advantages and drawbacks cited, quantified in the present study as 15 s of aversion (nasal discomfort and vocalisations) before losing posture...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{objective}} was to evaluate the suitability of <b>electronarcosis</b> as a stunning method for farmed eels. In the first experiment the minimum electrical current needed to induce a general epileptiform insult by head-only stunning was assessed. The individual eels (n = 40) with a live weight of 700 - 800 g were fixed in a specially designed re-strainer. The EEG (electroencephalogram) and ECG (electrocardiogram) recordings, observation of behaviour and responses to pain stimuli {{were used to assess}} unconsciousness, insensibility and cardiac function. The applied current of 150, 200 or 250 V, 50 Hz, AC was delivered via scissor-model stunning tongs for approximately 1 s. A general epileptiform insult was observed in 31 eels for which a successful EEG recording was obtained, using 255 ± 4 V, 545 ± 32 mA, for 1. 2 ± 0. 2 s. The general epileptiform insult as measured on the EEG was characterized by a tonic/clonic phase and an exhaustion phase. The behaviour showed one phase: tonic cramps alternated by clonic ones. The heart rate was 22 ± 8 beats min 1 (n = 23) prior to stunning. After stunning the ECG revealed fibrillation. In the second experiment the behaviour of seven individual eels able to move freely in water was observed after head-only stunning (250 V). Two phases were distinguished. Limited tonic and clonic cramps combined with backward swimming were followed by heavy clonic cramps combined with unco-ordinated movements such as jumping out of the water. A distinct exhaustion phase was not observed in all animals. In the third experiment a head-to-tail electrical method was examined in 15 eels for rendering the eels unconscious and insensitive prior to slaughter. They were stunned by applying 253 V for 3 s followed by 50 V for 5 min. In the fourth experiment nine eels were head-only stunned with 260 V for 1 s immediately followed by 50 V for 5 min applied from head to tail. Results obtained in these two experiments were similar. After stunning no brain activity and no responses to pain stimuli on the EEG were observed and the ECG showed ventricular extra systolae. It was observed that it might take 60 ± 25 min or longer for a complete recovery. It can be concluded that for effective electrical stunning of eels with a weight of 700 - 800 g an average current of 545 ± 32 mA (at approximate 250 V, 50 Hz AC) is needed. In this case, within a confidence level of 95 t least 91 ␘f the eels are effectively stunned (n = 31).

40|$|Improved {{animal welfare}} during {{industrial}} slaughtering of fish is {{the aim of}} the scientific work presented in this thesis. The thesis is based on four publications that cover different stages of an automated industrial slaughtering line for fish. The publications are presented in a similar order to those on a slaughtering line. The results from paper I are relevant for all types of pre-chilling of fish before slaughtering and reveal the physiological effects of live chilling in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Chilling of fish is commonly used in the industry, both during transportation and processing of the fish in the slaughtering house. The publication is based on two experiments where the first experiment included fish (mean weight 840 g) acclimatized to a water temperature of either 16, 8, or 4 °C and which were directly transferred horizontally or vertically (9 combinations) to temperatures of 16, 8, 4, or 0 °C using a dip net. In the second experiment, fish (mean weight 916 g) acclimatized to 16 °C were exposed to four temperature-drop regimes (no physical handling) : 16 – 4 °C (over 5 h), 16 – 4 °C (over 1 h), 16 – 0 °C (over 5 h), and 16 – 0 °C (over 1 h). Physical transfers in the first trial, i. e., temperature drops, resulted in immediate (1 h) increases in blood lactate concentrations at all three temperatures, but levels were significantly reduced and close to pretransfer levels after 6 h. Horizontal transfers, i. e. 16 – 16 °C, 8 – 8 °C, and 4 – 4 °C, resulted in similar increases and were not significantly different from the groups exposed to temperature drops. The most severe vertical transfer (16 - 0 °C) resulted in a swift loss of equilibrium and eventually death. In experiment No. 2, temperature drops from 16 to 4 °C and from 16 to 0 °C over a period of one or 5 h, without physically handling the fish, resulted in no significant increases in any of the measured parameters 1 h post-transfer, except in the 16 – 0 °C (1 h) group. The latter experienced a significant increase in blood sodium, glucose, lactate and cortisol levels compared to all other groups. The results suggest that salmon are capable of tolerating relatively steep temperature drops without any significant negative effects on blood stress parameters and that physical stress from gentle handling overrides the effect of thermal insults, which is important for the slaughtering procedure. The overall objective of the study in paper II was to find the optimal configurations for industrial percussive and electrical stunning by evaluating the methods under laboratory conditions. In an automated slaughtering line electrical and percussive stunning are common methods used to ensure unconsciousness, which is critical for fish welfare, before bleed out. The work described in this publication defines the settings, especially voltage and air pressure, needed for efficiently rendering the fish unconscious and also to verify the effect of the stunning machines. Evidence of unconsciousness and insensibility of Atlantic salmon was provided on the electroencephalogram (EEG) by the appearance of slow waves and spikes, followed by a strong depression in electrical activity. This phenomenon was observed in 17 salmon after percussive stunning using an air pressure of 8. 1 to 10 bars, whilst 8 fish were considered conscious at pressures below 8. 1 bars, although some were seemingly unconscious in behavior. Consequences were a haemorrhage in the brain cavity in 15 out of 17 fish, broken upper or lower jaws in 9 fish and eye burst in 8 fish. A general epileptiform insult (unconscious and insensible) was obtained by delivering a voltage, consisting of a direct current (DC) coupled with 100 Hz alternating current (AC) with a peak value of :: 112 volt (V), head to body, for approximately 0. 5 s. The total duration of the insult was 62 ± 44 s (mean±SD; n= 25) which was followed by minimal brain activity in 19 fish. The heart rate was 20 ± 7 beats/min prior to stunning. After stunning, the electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed fibrillation for 22 ± 15 s and became irregular and showed extrasystolae (ventrical contraction) afterwards. Exposing the salmon for 5 s with electricity followed by a gill cut resulted in 1 out of 3 fish temporarily recovering after 3 min. Haemorrhages were not observed in the fillets. Average current for head to body electrical dry stunning was 668 milliampere (mA) root mean square (RMS) with an average stunning voltage of 107. 9 Vrms. Electrical head to body stunning can be recommended when using coupled AC and DC current of 668 mArms and :: 107 Vrms. The salmon can be stunned in approximately 0. 5 s. However, the experiment concluded that a correct bleeding procedure should be developed. For percussive stunning it was concluded that if sufficient force is used the fish will be rendered unconscious and insensible, however this resulted in damage to the carcass, whereas a combined AC and DC signal is recommended for dry electrical head to body stunning. The objective of paper III was to verify the optimal AC frequency range to be used during industrial electro stunning, i. e. <b>electronarcosis,</b> of Atlantic salmon by investigating the electrical impedance spectra of the combined fish and electro stunning device entity. This is an important task since the frequency of the electrical signals is crucial to the electro stunner’s effect. The electrical impedance and associated phase shift was measured in the frequency range 40 Hz to 1. 0 MHz for individual fish (n = 11) placed in a regular electrical stunner. The results of the experiment showed that the average overall impedance of the combined fish and electrical stunning device increases with frequency from 40 to 60 Hz before leveling out in the range from 60 to 800 Hz. Thereafter the impedance decreases to a negligible value at 1 MHz. Measurements on impedance and phase angle showed that the highest average electrical impedance appeared at 100 Hz. Furthermore, there were individual peak impedance variations between 70 and 100 Hz. In all fish measured, the impedance at 900 Hz was observed to be lower than that at adjacent frequencies. Due to average measured impedance values and the expected influence of the alpha dispersions on the cell surface, as reported in previous research, it was concluded that the optimal AC frequency range for electro stunning of the Atlantic salmon brain is 70 to 100 Hz. The aim of paper IV was to understand the importance of electrical signal frequency spectrum on stunning, recovery and inflicting injuries. Hemorrhaging in the filet, caused by broken backbones, has been a quality problem for the industry when electro stunning is used to render the fish unconsciousness. The paper also shows the effect of chilling during bleed out. In this article Atlantic salmon were exposed for 5 seconds to either 217 Vrms, 50 Hz, AC or 107 Vrms coupled AC+DC at 200 Hz, with and without a high frequency spectrum. Post stun the fish were placed back into water, either at ambient seawater temperature (10. 4 °C) or cold water (- 1. 3 °C), to investigate recovery or mortality. The results showed that a high frequency spectrum, but low amplitude prevented the muscles from contracting and causing spinal injuries and hemorrhaging, for all individuals. Injury rates of 14 and 18 % was observed when using electrical signals containing only low frequencies of 200 Hz AC+DC and 50 Hz, AC. The high frequency spectrum also reduced the stimulation of the brain as fish recovered faster with no mortality. Adding a cold shock post stunning delayed or prevented recovery of all groups within the time span required to kill the fish by exsanguination. Papers III and IV will potentially have relevance for other disciplines, such as medicine, where electroshock and <b>electronarcosis</b> are used...|$|E
40|$|M. Sc. The lower Thukela River {{catchment}} {{supports the}} highly industrialised Mandini/Sundumbili Industrial Complex, {{which in turn}} supports Tugela Rail, a textile factory, a vegetable-oil factory, {{as well as the}} Sundumbili Sewerage Treatment works. All of these industries release their wastes into the Mandini River that leads into the lower Thukela River. Another major potential impacting factor on the lower Thukela River is the Sappi Tugela pulp and paper mill that has both abstraction and discharge points in the same region. In 2004 the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry completed a comprehensive Reserve Determination study for the Thukela River. Upon reviewing the results it was clear that many of the variables assessed were of low confidence or there was not sufficient data collected within the region of the Mandini and Thukela River confluence and further downstream (Resource Unit K). Therefore the previous studies were not able to determine {{the degree to which the}} industries in the lower Thukela system impacted upon the integrity of the system. The aim of this study was therefore to assess the contributing impacts of the Tugela pulp and paper mill and other industrial activities on the ecological integrity of the lower Thukela River. This was done by through a toxicity assessment of the potential impacts of effluent and wastewater using the Direct Estimation of Ecological Effect Potential (DEEEP) methodologies. The toxicity of pulp and paper effluent from the Thukela mill and the receiving water body was compared to effluents from two other mills (Stanger and Ngodwana), assessing the water quality in relation to the input of different industrial effluents in the lower Thukela River. The general integrity of the lower Thukela River in relation to the input of different industrial effluents was assessed using the Habitat Quality Index (HQI), Habitat Assessment Index (HAI), macroinvertebrate and fish population studies. These studies were integrated to derive the Ecostatus of the lower Thukela River using the Macro-invertebrate and Fish Response Assessment Indices (MIRAI and FAII respectively). The toxicity testing (DEEEP) showed the paper mill effluent in the Mandini River was the least hazardous whilst Ngodwana effluent showed the highest potential to elicit a harmful impact on the receiving water body. The latter effluent displayed the highest LC 50 values for the fish and the Daphnia toxicity tests, as well as an extremely high base-pair substitution mutagen activity. Toxicity was also found in algae at 100 % raw effluent exposure. Tugela and Stanger mill effluent samples were very similar in their toxicity, except that Stanger effluent showed greater mutagenicity potential with exceptionally high values of revertants. The Tugela effluent samples showed no concerning levels of mutagenicity. The fish showed lower levels of response to the Tugela sample when compared to the Stanger sample. Thus comparatively the Thukela system is regarded to be the least at risk with regards to effluent discharge into the receiving water body. The lower Thukela River integrity assessment showed a sharp increase in temperature below the discharge point of the pulp and paper mill effluent. This was attributed to the excessive temperatures recorded in the pulp and paper effluent itself. There was further decrease in dissolved oxygen, which was due a combination of the industrial waste water in the Mandini River and the pulp and paper effluent. The increased organic content in the sediments of the lowest site situated downstream (TR 5) is a combination of both reduced velocity of the stream flow entering the upper reaches of the estuary as well as increased organic material entering the river via the pulp and paper effluent and the Mandini River above TR 3 -D. This was accompanied by increased contribution of fine particle size sediments to the overall sediment composition. Habitat conditions were near natural at sites upstream of the Mandini River and effluent discharge confluences with the Thukela River. The exception was at TR 1 as the weir results in unnatural inundation of biotopes upstream. The habitat conditions around the confluences of the Mandini River and pulp and paper mill effluent discharge are diminished with a recovery noted further downstream at TR 4 and TR 5. Invertebrate assessment shows the upstream sites to be natural, while the impact sites were largely to seriously modified. Once again the downstream sites (TR 4 and TR 5) show an improvement to recover to a moderately modified state. The fish assessment also shows a decrease in the FAII score below the impacts when compared to the integrity above the impacts. However these results are of low confidence due to insufficient sampling effort as only <b>electronarcosis,</b> seine and cast nets were used. The Ecoclassification assessment indicated a clear decrease in Ecostatus between the sites that are upstream of the impacts caused by the industrial effluent from the Mandini River and the pulp and paper mill effluent from the effluent discharge stream. The MIRAI also clearly indicated that the major impacts are caused by the combination of the Mandini River and the pulp and paper effluent. However there was a recovery in the river further downstream from the impacts...|$|E
40|$|MSc (Zoology), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 The {{ecosystem}} {{services of the}} lower Amatikulu, Thukela and Umvoti Rivers are used extensively through sugarcane agricultural activities, heavy industries and rural sewage-treatment works. These activities affect the ecological integrity of the lower Amatikulu, Thukela and Umvoti Rivers. The Umvoti River is already being {{referred to as a}} „working river‟. This study aims to determine the current state of ecological integrity of the lower Amatikulu, Thukela and Umvoti Rivers and to establish trends between current and historical periods for the evaluation of changing trends in ecological integrity. Abiotic (driver) and biotic (responder) indicator components were used in order to identify and monitor any changes in the surrounding environment as well as to determine the ecological integrity of the lower Amatikulu, Thukela and Umvoti Rivers. Driver components include water quality, sediment grain size, moisture and organic content as well as habitat state, whereas responder components involve macroinvertebrates and fish assemblages. Two surveys were carried out; one during the low-flow period (5 - 11 August 2011) and the other during the high-flow period (20 - 28 March 2012). Current data and findings together with historical data from 1999 to 2010 were used to establish trends of selected driver and responder components. Water quality variables selected include general variables such as water temperature, chemical oxygen demand (COD), electrical conductivity (EC), pH and total alkalinity (TAL) as well as salts, nutrients and toxics. These variables provide indications as to the state of the water-quality component of this study. The Target Water Quality Requirements (TWQR) as developed by the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry for domestic use (Volume 1) and Aquatic Ecosystems (Volume 7) were used to evaluate the quality of the water sampled in this study. The water quality as well as quantity was also compared to historical data obtained from previous studies that have been done for the same study area. The sediment analyses were performed according to the protocol set out by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Habitat availability, diversity and state were assessed by means of the Integrated Habitat Assessment System Version 2 (IHAS v 2) and the Index of Habitat Integrity (IHI). The water quality of the lower Amatikulu River was found to be in a slightly modified state with the majority of water quality parameters within the target values as set by the TWQG. Water quality parameters considered on the lower Thukela River such as water temperatures, oxygen levels, nutrient and salt loads occurred at elevated levels and were not within the TWQG requirements. The water quality of the Thukela River wasconsidered to be in a modified state which may cause negative impacts on the structure and function of the river, while the water quality of the lower Umvoti River was seriously modified. Sediment analyses revealed that the organic content of the Lower Amatikulu, Thukela and Umvoti Rivers was low. Sediment grain-size distributions are dominated by well-sorted larger soil grain-sizes (> 500 μm) which is not ideal for the biodiversity. This is an indication that erosion and transportation are taking place in the Amatikulu, Thukela and Umvoti Rivers. The removal of riparian vegetation by agricultural activities and water abstraction contributes to the habitat deterioration as well as erosion and transportation of sediments that occurs in lower Amatikulu, Thukela and Umvoti Rivers. The use of macroinvertabrates as biological indicators in the determination of the ecological integrity, state or health of lotic ecosystems is globally well established. The South African Scoring System, version 5 (SASS 5), the Macroinvertebrate Response Assessment Index (MIRAI) and multivariate statistical analyses were implemented {{in order to determine the}} ecological integrity of the lower Amatikulu, Thukela and Umvoti Rivers. Results revealed that the SASS 5 integrity classes were generally one class higher than the integrity classes of MIRAI. SASS 5 and MIRAI integrity classes of the Amatikulu River ranged from natural (Class A) to largely modified (Class D/E) while the Thukela and Umvoti rivers ranged from natural to seriously modified (Class E/F). Fish assemblages are commonly used as key indicators to describe the ecological state of aquatic ecosystems. Methods used to sample fish included <b>electronarcosis</b> and a 5 m wide 12 mm meshed seine net. The Fish Response Assessment Index (FRAI) and multivariate statistical analyses were implemented in order to determine the ecological integrity of the lower Amatikulu, Thukela and Umvoti rivers. Results revealed that the automated FRAI integrity classes were constantly lower than the adjusted FRAI integrity classes. Automated and adjusted FRAI integrity classes of the Amatikulu River ranged from largely natural (Class B) to largely modified (Class D) while the Thukela and Umvoti rivers ranged from natural (Class A) to seriously modified (Class E/F). The current ecological integrity of the lower Amatikulu River was found to be in a largely natural, with few modifications (Class B) state. The Thukela River was found to be in a moderately modified (Class C) state while the Umvoti River was found to be in a largely modified (Class D) state. The trends in ecological integrity of the selected driver components which include water quality, sediment and habitat availability fluctuated noticeably. The general trend in water quality of the lower Amatikulu, Thukela and Umvoti Rivers slightly recovered towards 2012. Sediment analyses revealed that the sediment grain-size distribution as well as the moisture and organic contents generally remained stable. There was a decline in the general state of habitat integrity towards 2012. As a result of the decline in the habitat ecological integrity the ecological integrity of macroinvertebrates also slightly declined towards 2012. However, a noticeable improvement in the ecological integrity of fish assemblages was observed towards 2012. To conclude, the ecological integrity of water quality and fish assemblages improved towards 2012, while habitat and macroinvertebrates deteriorated and sediment stayed the same. The general and overall state of ecological integrity of the lower Amatikulu, Thukela and Umvoti Rivers did not deteriorate nor did it improve, but rather it stayed the same. Impacts on the ecological integrity of the lower Amatikulu, Thukela and Umvoti Rivers include a multitude of different sources. To prevent the current ecological integrity of the lower Amatikulu, Thukela and Umvoti Rivers from deteriorating further, a collective effort involving all parties is essential. Master...|$|E
