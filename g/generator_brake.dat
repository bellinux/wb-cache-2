40|$|LecturePg. 19 - 28 Experience, {{theoretical}} and practical, investigations are presented on two radial flow high-speed turbines, which showed unacceptable high subsynchronous vibrations during operation onsite. The first example {{deals with a}} two-stage integrally geared turbine for energy recovery, with <b>generator</b> <b>brake</b> installed in a chemical plant. Measurements and calculations ruled out that the subsynchronous vibrations were caused by the bearings. Measurements of pressure at the inlet and outlet of both stages and in the inter-stage pipe hinted at an acoustic excitation in the annular space between impeller and adjustable nozzle ring. The acoustic excitation and resulting subsynchronous vibrations could be reduced by installing a few fixed nozzles, thus interrupting the vaneless space {{to the extent that}} safe operation of the gear turbine is possible adhering to the relevant guidelines. The second example is a compressor-loaded turbine with bilaterally overhung radial impellers employed in an air separation plant. Non-reproducible, subsynchronous vibrations occurred, due to variations of manufacturing tolerances of bearing geometry, labyrinth seals and gap geometries representing the main causes. The results of parameter studies in the bearing and sealing zones showed that the damping effect of the bearings can be eliminated by the influence of the labyrinths. Thus, the rotor becomes unstable. The rotor was stabilized by the installation of swirl brakes and antiswirl sleeves. After that, subsynchronous vibrations ceased to exist resulting in stable and safe operation...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} {{and evaluation of}} {{the design of a}} Micro-Ram Air Turbine (µRAT), a device being developed to provide power for an autonomous boundary layer measurement system, has been undertaken. The design tools consist of a rotor model and a generator model. The primary focus was on developing and evaluating the generator model for the prediction of <b>generator</b> <b>brake</b> power and output electrical power with and without rectification as a function of shaft speed and electrical load, with only basic manufacturer specifications given as inputs. A series of motored generator evaluation test were conducted at speeds ranging from 9, 000 to 25, 000 rpm for loads varying between 1 and 3. 02 Ohms with output power of up to 80 Watts. Results demonstrated that predicted generated power was at or below 3 % error when compared to measured results with about 1 % uncertainty. A rotor model was also developed using basic blade element theory. This model neglected induced flow effects and was therefore expected to over predict rotor torque and power. A second rotor model that includes induced flow effects, the open source program X-Rotor, was also used to predict rotor power and for comparison to the blade element rotor model results. Both rotor models were evaluated through wind tunnel validation tests conducted on a turbine generator with two different 3. 25 in diameter rotors, rotor- 1 (untwisted blades) and rotor- 2 (twisted blades). Wind tunnel validation test airspeeds varied between 71 - 110 mph with electrical loads ranging from 1 - 20 ohms. Results indicated power predictions to be 50 - 75 % higher for the blade element model and 20 - 30 % for X-Rotor results. The blade element rotor model was modified by applying the Prandtl tip-loss factor to approximately account for the induced flow effects; this addition brought predictions much closer to X-Rotor results. Based on the motor-driven generator test results, it is believed that most of the discrepancy in baseline rotor/generator validation test between predicted and observed power generated is due to inaccuracy in the rotor performance modelling with likely contributors to error being induced flow effects, crude section lift/drag modelling, and aero-elastic deformation. It is concluded that the proposed generator model is sufficient although direct torque measurements may be desired and further development of the µRAT design tools should focus on an improved rotor performance model...|$|E

The Krieger electric landaulet had a drive motor in each front wheel with {{a second set of}} parallel windings (bifilar coil) for regenerative braking. In England, the Raworth system of [...] "regenerative control" [...] was introduced by tramway operators in the early 1900s, since it offered them economic and operational benefits as explained by A. Raworth of Leeds in some detail. These included tramway systems at Devonport (1903), Rawtenstall, Birmingham, Crystal Palace-Croydon (1906), and many others. Slowing the speed of the cars or keeping it in control on descending gradients, the motors worked as <b>generators</b> and <b>braked</b> the vehicles. The tram cars also had wheel brakes and track slipper brakes which could stop the tram should the electric braking systems fail. In several cases the tram car motors were shunt wound instead of series wound, and the systems on the Crystal Palace line utilized series-parallel controllers. Following a serious accident at Rawtenstall, an embargo was placed on this form of traction in 1911; the regenerative braking system was reintroduced 20 years later.|$|R

40|$|The article {{presents}} {{the definition of}} the functions of self-excitation electromagnetic processes of asynchronous traction motor with regenerative braking powered by limited power source. It is shown that the power of current synchronous <b>generator</b> with <b>brake</b> mode is not very desirable, as leading to increased fuel consumption and can reduce the value of the braking power, engine traction which develops as a result of absorption of the resistor current synchronous generator. Therefore, it is advisable in brake mode to keep rectifier closed by lowering the excitation synchronous generator so that the latter is below rectified voltage asynchronous machine. By reducing the power factor of asynchronous machine magnitude of reactive energy required for its excitation increases and increases according capacitor discharge current. Capacitor filter designed to smooth the ripple voltage mainly generates the inverter work. The increase in capacity required for this purpose is desirable to avoid the increase in the weight and volume of the inverter. Therefore, the low power factor may be appropriate to enable the rectifier and power of asynchronous machine of synchronous generator increasing its excitement. This should automatically be happened with increasing of discharge current filter capacitor installation and should be funded to some acceptable limits.

40|$|SummaryThis Master Thesis is a {{conclusion}} on work done {{as part of}} the Resource Optimizationand recovery in the Materials industry project (Roma). This project is involved in thedevelopment of a new technology for power production from low temperature heat sourcesfor off gases from aluminum production cells. The technology is based on an transcriticalRankine cycle with CO 2 as a working fluid, as the work recovery circuit. The center ofthe test facility is the expander, a prototype provided by Obrist Engineering. 81 testswere perfomed to investigate the behavoir of the expander cycle. Effect of three mainparameters were investigated:&# 8226; Effect CO 2 massflow rate&# 8226; Effect of heat source temperature&# 8226; Effect of CO 2 condensation pressureFor each parameter combination, the high pressure side of the expander cycle was variedin order to find the maximum power output. This study clearly showed limitation of the turbine which cannot maintain large pressuredifference probably due to large internal leakages. As a result, turbine outlet is highlysuperheated. This superheat is lost energy for the power cycle, and is simply dumpedinto the heat sink. One possible improvement would be to include a recuperator thatrecovers superheat after the pump. The results also indicate that the fan of the air loop is too small: increasing the CO 2 flowrate to limit superheat at turbine outlet leads to turbine inlet temperature reduction. Last, for large CO 2 mass flow rate (3. 5 kgmin) which is required for proper operation ofthe turbine, the power generated is too large for the generator installed on the loop. Itstemperature reached 120 &# 176;C for some conditions. A new solution should be seeked.

40|$|As {{the global}} economy strives towards clean energy {{in the face of}} climate change, the {{automotive}} industry is researching into improving the efficiency of automobiles. Hybrid vehicle systems were proposed and have demonstrated the capability of reducing fuel consumption while maintaining vehicle performance. Various hybrid vehicles in the form of parallel and series hybrid have been produced by difference vehicle manufacturers. The purpose of this thesis is to create a hybrid vehicle model in MATLAB and ADAMS to demonstrate its fuel economy improvement over a conventional vehicle system. The hybrid vehicle model utilizes the Honda IMA (Integrated Motor Assist) architecture, where the electric motor acts as a supplement to the engine torque. The motor unit also acts as a <b>generator</b> during regenerative <b>braking</b> to recover the otherwise lost kinetic energy. The powertrain components’ power output calculation and the control logic were modeled in MATLAB/Simulink, while the mechanical inertial components were modeled in ADAMS. The model utilizes a driver input simulation, where the driver control module compares the actual and desired speeds, and applies a throttle or a braking percent to the powertrain components, which in turns applies the driving or the braking torque to the wheels. Communication between MATLAB and ADAMS was established by ADAMS/Controls. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the MATLAB/ADAMS hybrid vehicle model, simulation results were compared to the published data of ADVISOR. The West Virginia University 5 Peaks drive cycle was used to compare the two software models. The results obtained from MATLAB/ADAMS and ADVISOR for the engine and motor/generator correlated well. Minor discrepancies existed, but were deemed insignificant. This validates the MATLAB/ADAMS hybrid vehicle model against the published results of ADVISOR. Fuel economy of hybrid and conventional vehicle models were compared using the EPA New York City Cycle (NYCC) and the Highway Fuel Economy Cycle (HWFET). The hybrid vehicle demonstrated 8. 9 % and 14. 3 % fuel economy improvement over the conventional vehicle model for the NYCC and HWFET drive cycles, respectively. In addition, the motor consumed 83. 6 kJ of electrical energy during the assist mode while regenerative braking recovered 105. 5 kJ of electrical energy during city driving. For the highway drive cycle, the motor consumed 213. 6 kJ of electrical energy during the assist mode while the regenerative braking recovered 172. 0 kJ of energy. The MATLAB/ADAMS vehicle model offers a simulation platform that is modular, flexible, and can be conveniently modified to create different types of vehicle models. In addition, the simulation results clearly demonstrated the fuel economy advantage of the hybrid vehicle over the conventional vehicle model. It is recommended that a more sophisticated power management algorithm be implemented in the model to optimize the efficiencies of the engine and the motor/generator. Furthermore, it is suggested that the ADAMS vehicle model be validated against an actual vehicle, in order to fully utilize the multi-body vehicle dynamics capability which ADAMS has to offer...|$|R
40|$|Lack {{of fossil}} fuel {{supplies}} {{as well as}} greenhouse gases e®ect on the environment, have motivated car manufacturers to introduce new generations of cars in order to cope with fuel consumption and emissions issues. One {{of the most interesting}} structures that is introduced recently to the production lines belongs to hybrid electric vehicles. A hybrid electric vehicle powertrain, generally, contains an electric energy bu®er and an electric machine as well as the conventional internal combustion engine that can work together in several di®erent architectures known as series, parallel and series-parallel de- pending on how the electric machine is coupled with the internal combustion engine. This extra degree of freedom in the powertrain has raised several di®erent research routes on how to optimize the power split between the electric machine and the conventional internal combustion engine. The present work presents a Dynamic Programming approach that solves the optimal power split between the internal combustion engine and the electric machine in parallel hybrid electric vehicles in an e±cient way, taking minimal fuel consumption considerations into account. The power split must be carried out {{in such a way that}} in every moment the demanding power on the ¯nal drive is ful¯lled by either the internal combustion engine alone, the electric machine alone or both together. Another important characteristic of hybrid electric vehicles is the possibility to regenerate breaking energy that is dissipated in conventional vehicles, by e±ciently using the electric machine in <b>generator</b> mode while <b>braking,</b> and storing this energy into the electric bu®er for further use. This is also taken into account while designing the optimal controller in the presented work. This optimal control problem is complicated in the sense that the future driving demands are not known a priori to the controller and hence the decision making is impossible if we treat the problem in a simple way. What can be done to cope with this issue is to divide the problem into two di®erent cases. The ¯rst and the most straightforward case is the deterministic case in which the whole driving cycle is known to the controller beforehand, as is considered through the whole thesis. This can be applied e±ciently to vehicles that are driven through a speci¯c route many times and have stop-and-go driving cycles such as commuter busses or refuse vehicles. The second case that is much more complicated and can be applied to any vehicle is the stochastic case that contains no prede¯ned driving cycle and instead uses di®erent methods to predict or to estimate the future driving demands depending on the speci¯c technique that is applied. This can easily be realized having the new GPS and GIS equipments in hand, though it is not covered in the presented work. A Dynamic Programming-based (DP-based) algorithm has been developed as the con- trol system design and applied to the derived vehicle model based on fully deterministic driving pro¯les. The employed controller shows highly satisfactory reductions in the fuel consumption compared to a simple non-hybrid model in simulations. This algorithm has then been used as the heart of a newly developed toolbox to be working together with QSS Toolbox under Matlab and Simulink environments for much easier further case studies...|$|R
