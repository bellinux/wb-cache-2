The calibration of individual electric <b>field</b> <b>meters</b> and the elimination of the aircraft's self-charge are described. Linear combinations of field mill signals are examined and absolute calibration and error analysis are discussed.

The objective of this work was to review the state-of-the art of <b>field</b> <b>meter</b> proving technology to identify any recent developments that may allow for in-situ proving of natural gas flow meters on a broader scale. Particular {{emphasis was placed on}} identifying technologies that have emerged since December 1995, when a topical report entitled ""Metering Research Facility Program: Review of <b>Field</b> <b>Meter</b> Provers"" (GRI- 95 / 0209) was published. There have been significant improvements in the measurement performance of ultrasonic gas flow meters. The performance of multipath ultrasonic gas flow meters has improved {{to the point that they}} now approach the measurement performance level of other proving technologies, such as sonic nozzles and turbine flow meters. A new rotary piston meter design (that uses multiple rotors to reduce pulsations) and new dual-rotor turbine meter designs have entered the marketplace. Many of the gas meter field provers that were in existence in the early 1990 s are no longer in service. It is speculated that these provers were not capable of providing cost-effective <b>field</b> <b>meter</b> proofs, and thus, their use has been discontinued. "...|$|E

40|$|Cornell University {{provided}} three {{instruments for}} the Enstrophy experiment: an electric <b>field</b> <b>meter,</b> a plasma wave receiver, and a magnetometer for measuring FAC. The electric <b>field</b> <b>meter</b> {{consisted of a}} 6 m Weitzmann boom system with analog signal processing and 12 bit ADC, which yielded one electric field component instantaneously and a two dimensional electric field every half spin. The plasma wave receiver used the same sensing system {{with the addition of}} pre-amplifiers in the spheres to sense plasma waves up to and including the electron Langmuir frequency. Signal processing employed a variety of continuous and snap shot techniques depending on the frequency range and band width. The science magnetometer provided by Cornell University was a Billingsly design fluxgate previously used on spacecraft missions but without radiation hardening. The magnetometer was mounted on a one meter, stiff aluminum "flop-down" boom. The Enstrophy payload was launched on february 11, 1999. Because of a design flaw in the event timers, the magnetometer boom was deployed before the payload despun. As a result the magnetometer separated mechanically from the boom but maintained electrical connection. This was confirmed by the calculation of the scalar magnetic field from all three vector components of the magnetic field. However, the individual vector values had no scientific value. The electric field and plasma wave instrumentation worked as designed. The data from these instruments was provided to the University of New Hampshire and to the Principal Investigator, as proposed...|$|E
