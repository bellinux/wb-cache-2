A typical medium-sized farm in the inland of Norway would include a dwelling house (våningshus), hay barn (låve), livestock barn (fjøs), one or more food storage houses (stabbur), a stable, and occasionally separate houses for poultry, pigs, <b>etc.</b> Houses that had separate heat sources, e.g., washing houses (eldhus) and smithies were usually kept separate from the other houses to prevent fires. Outhouses were typically separate, small structures. If the farm housed craftsmen, there would also be separate houses for carpentry, wheel making, shoemaking, <b>etc.</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{the spring}} of 2001, Kentucky had {{experienced}} an extraordinarily heavy infestation of eastern tent caterpillars (<b>ETCs).</b> An epidemiological study showed <b>ETCs</b> {{to be associated with}} MRLS. When <b>ETCs</b> returned to Kentucky in {{the spring of}} 2002, equine exposure to caterpillars was immediately shown to produce abortions. Research then focused on how the <b>ETCs</b> produced the abortions. Reviewing the speed with which <b>ETCs</b> produced late-term abortions in 2002 experiments, the nonspecific bacterial infections in the placenta/fetus were assigned a primary driving role. The question then became how exposure to the caterpillars produced these non-specific bacterial infections of the affected placenta/fetus and also the uveitis and pericarditis cases.|$|R
40|$|Conditions for {{polymerizing}} ethylene terephthalate cyclic oligomers (<b>ETCs)</b> {{with the}} catalyst antimony trioxide were investigated {{with the ultimate}} goal in mind of using <b>ETCs</b> to produce high­performance poly(ethylene terephthalate) {PET) composites. The <b>ETCs</b> used were prepared both by a direct synthesis method and by cyclodepolymerization (CDP) in dilute solution. <b>ETCs</b> prepared exhibited a distribution of oligomeric species displaying a broad meting range, the uppermost end of which lies at 290 °C. In the case of <b>ETCs</b> prepared by CDP, purified <b>ETCs</b> (p-ETCs) were prepared by eliminating remaining impurities including linear oligomers and cyclic oligomers containing the diethylene glycol (DEG) unit using dichloromethane and tetrahydrofuran. A homogeneous mixture of <b>ETCs</b> prepared by the direct synthesis method or p-ETCs with antimony trioxide was successfully polymerized to high molecular weight (MW) PET (Mn 2 :: 25 000) at 293 °C within 15 min. The lower the contents of remaining impurities, the higher the MW of the resultant PET. The PET of highest MW (Mn= 32 000) was obtained from polymerization ofp-ETCs with bismuth trioxide at 293 °C for 15 min. PET polymerized from p-ETCs showed the same thermal behavior as did the commercial one. In this research, a useful method of PET recycle by using <b>ETCs</b> was successfully established...|$|R

40|$|Escape from mitotic {{catastrophe}} and {{generation of}} endopolyploid tumour cells (<b>ETCs)</b> represents a potential survival strategy of tumour cells {{in response to}} genotoxic treatments. <b>ETCs</b> that resume the mitotic cell cycle have reduced ploidy and are often resistant to these treatments. In search for a mechanism for genome reduction, we previously observed that <b>ETCs</b> express meiotic proteins among which REC 8 (a meiotic cohesin component) is of particular interest, since it favours reductional cell division in meiosis. In the present investigation, we induced endopolyploidy in p 53 -dysfunctional human tumour cell lines (Namalwa, WI-L 2 -NS, HeLa) by gamma irradiation, and analysed the sub-cellular localisation of REC 8 in the resulting <b>ETCs.</b> We observed by RT-PCR and Western blot that REC 8 is constitutively expressed in these tumour cells, along with SGOL 1 and SGOL 2, and that REC 8 becomes modified after irradiation. REC 8 localised to paired sister centromeres in <b>ETCs,</b> the former co-segregating to opposite poles. Furthermore, REC 8 localised to the centrosome of interphase <b>ETCs</b> and to the astral poles in anaphase cells where it colocalised with the microtubule-associated protein NuMA. Altogether, our observations indicate that radiation-induced <b>ETCs</b> express features of meiotic cell divisions and that these may facilitate chromosome segregation and genome reduction...|$|R

40|$|Extratropical {{cyclones}} (<b>ETCs)</b> are {{the main}} purveyors of precipitation in the mid-latitudes, especially in winter, and have a significant radiative impact through the clouds they generate. However, general circulation models (GCMs) have trouble representing precipitation and clouds in <b>ETCs,</b> and this might partly explain why current GCMs disagree on {{to the evolution of}} these systems in a warming climate. Collectively, the A-train observations of MODIS, CloudSat, CALIPSO, AIRS and AMSR-E have given us a unique perspective on ETCs: over the past 10 years these observations have allowed us to construct a climatology of clouds and precipitation associated with these storms. This has proved very useful for model evaluation as well in studies aimed at improving understanding of moist processes in these dynamically active conditions. Using the A-train observational suite and an objective cyclone and front identification algorithm we have constructed cyclone centric datasets that consist of an observation-based characterization of clouds and precipitation in <b>ETCs</b> and their sensitivity to large scale environments. In this presentation, we will summarize the advances in our knowledge of the climatological properties of cloud and precipitation in <b>ETCs</b> acquired with this unique dataset. In particular, we will present what we have learned about southern ocean <b>ETCs,</b> for which the A-train observations have filled a gap in this data sparse region. In addition, CloudSat and CALIPSO have for the first time provided information on the vertical distribution of clouds in <b>ETCs</b> and across warm and cold fronts. We will also discuss how these observations have helped identify key areas for improvement in moist processes in recent GCMs. Recently, we have begun to explore the interaction between aerosol and cloud cover in <b>ETCs</b> using MODIS, CloudSat and CALIPSO. We will show how aerosols are climatologically distributed within northern hemisphere <b>ETCs,</b> and how this relates to cloud cover...|$|R

We show that in vitro priming of donor lymphocytes can circumvent the need of recipient-derived APCs in vivo for mediating robust GVL effects and significantly diminishes the risk of severe GVHD. In vitro, generated and expanded T cells (<b>ETCs)</b> mediate anti-leukemia effects only when primed on recipient-derived APCs. Loading of APCs in vitro with leukemia cell lysate, chimerism status of the recipient, and timing of adoptive transfer after HCT are important factors determining the outcome. Delayed transfer of <b>ETCs</b> resulted in strong GVL effects in leukemia-bearing full chimera (FC) and mixed chimera (MC) recipients, which were comparable with the GVL/GVHD rates observed after the transfer of naive donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI). Upon early transfer, GVL effects were more pronounced with <b>ETCs</b> but {{at the expense of}} significant GVHD. The degree of GVHD was most severe in MCs after transfer of <b>ETCs</b> that had been in vitro primed either on nonpulsed recipient-derived APCs or with donor-derived APCs...|$|R
