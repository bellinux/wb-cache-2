It is shown, that patients with gastric <b>erosions</b> <b>and</b> biliary tract diseases are characterized by more pronounced disturbances of microhemocirculation in stomach body as for such indexes – stase (dysdiemorrhysis) in venules, cappilares, thrombosis in venules, cappilares, edema of the walls of microvessels and perivascular structures; thickening of vessels' walls, fibrous changes of native mucose membrane in the antral part of the stomach. ...|$|R
40|$|Both <b>erosions</b> <b>and</b> {{joint space}} {{narrowing}} (JSN) are aspects of structural damage in rheumatoid arthritis. Most {{information is available}} on structural damage as one concept. However, the differential aspect of the effects on bone and cartilage could yield interesting information. Comparative information of these aspects can be based only on radiographic data on <b>erosions</b> <b>and</b> JSN. Both <b>erosions</b> <b>and</b> JSN are the consequence of infl ammation, and their progression is inhibited by drugs that inhibit infl ammation. These two processes often occur in parallel but joints in which erosions are present show a preference for progression of <b>erosions</b> <b>and,</b> to a lesser extent, development of JSN. The reverse is true for joints with JSN present, {{where there is a}} preference for worsening of JSN over development of erosions. Repair is possible for erosions as well as JSN and this is related to the absence of infl ammation and effective treatment (especially methotrexate in combination with a tumour necrosis factor blocker) ...|$|R

40|$|Erosive {{pustular}} dermatosis of {{the scalp}} (EPDS) {{is a rare}} condition characterized by sterile pustules, <b>erosions,</b> <b>and</b> crusted lesions on the scalp of elderly patients. This inflammatory disorder has an unknown origin and it could develop into areas of alopecia that tend to be atrophic. An 84 -year-old Caucasian man presented with a several months history of painful erythematous <b>erosions</b> <b>and</b> crusts on his scalp. The lesions appeared after treatment with imiquimod cream for actinic keratoses. Previous therapies included topical antibiotics and topical steroids. Physical examination revealed the presence of extensive <b>erosions</b> <b>and</b> crusts on the scalp, with minute pustules on the sides. The clinical features and the medical history led us to the diagnosis of EPDS. Treatment with systemic steroid was administered with improvement observed after ten days. The clinical manifestations of EPDS completely resolved after 2 months, without clinical relapses...|$|R

40|$|Radiographic {{progression}} {{is usually}} assessed by Sharp-based methods (van der Heijde-modified Sharp score and the Genant-modified Sharp score). The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate, in a range of randomized controlled trials (RCT), the presence of <b>erosions</b> <b>and</b> joint space narrowing (JSN) in all individual joints, as well as progression in these joints, and to determine if any redundancy exists due to infrequently involved joints. Four databases of rheumatoid arthritis RCT that were all scored according to van der Heijde's modification of the Sharp score were included in a descriptive analysis. Irrespective of different readers, different patient populations, and different disease durations per trial, similar patterns emerged. Both <b>erosions</b> <b>and</b> JSN occurred in all sites. Erosions occurred most frequently in the feet, preferentially in 5 th metatarsophalangeal joint (MTP- 5). JSN occurred most frequently in the wrist. Change from baseline in <b>erosions</b> <b>and</b> JSN followed the pattern of involvement at baseline, so that MTP- 5, and to a lesser extent MTP- 3 and MTP- 4, preferentially showed progression in erosive damage. Joints in the wrist showed highest tendency to worsen over time with respect to JSN. These data indicate that both <b>erosions</b> <b>and</b> JSN must be assessed for damage, and that a more abbreviated joint count cannot be used for radiographic scorin...|$|R

40|$|Late Pliocene - early Pleistocene <b>erosions</b> <b>and</b> {{relative}} uplifts in {{the central}} inversion zone of the Xihu Depression, East China Sea Basin, are independently determined from reflection seismic data and sonic well-logging data, respectively. Relative uplifts estimated from linear least-square models of 26 sonic wells range from 0. 0 to 501. 3 m, while absolute erosions estimated on their respective well localities are generally larger, {{in the range of}} ~ 50. 0 to 1147. 5 m measured directly from seismic data, and ~ 70. 0 to 1700. 4 m after decompaction. Although discrepancies exist for several of the wells, a strong positive correlation can be found between <b>erosions</b> <b>and</b> relative uplifts. This good correlation verifies on the one hand that sonic well-logging data can give reasonably good estimates of relative uplifts, {{and on the other hand}} that erosions incurred during the basin inversion are strongly tectonically driven. <b>Erosions</b> <b>and</b> relative uplifts appear to be more exponentially than linearly interrelated...|$|R
