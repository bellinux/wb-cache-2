5|$|Lumumba's speech, {{broadcast}} {{live on the}} radio across the world, denounced colonialism and was interpreted as an affront to Belgium and Baudouin personally. While it was well-received within the Congo, it was widely condemned internationally as unnecessarily confrontational and for showing ingratitude {{at a time when}} Belgium had granted independence to the state. The speech nearly provoked a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>incident</b> between the Congo and Belgium and Lumumba later gave further speeches attempting to adopt a more conciliatory tone.|$|E

Amanda Waller decides {{it is the}} perfect opportunity for the Justice League of America to confront the Justice League, and dispatches them. During the conflict, it appears as though Superman murders the JLA's newest recruit, Doctor Light. Seeming to have lost control of his powers, Superman surrenders himself to A.R.G.U.S.|$|E
5|$|The {{whaleboat}} {{managed to}} rendezvous with Catalpa the following day, which then {{headed out to}} sea. They were chased by the steamship SS Georgette, which had been commandeered by the colonial governor. Though Georgette {{caught up with the}} whaler on 19 April, Catalpa master claimed they were in international waters, and that an attack on Catalpa would be considered an act of war against the United States. Not wanting to cause a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>incident,</b> Georgette allowed Catalpa to flee.|$|E

5|$|After the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, the Left Socialist Revolutionaries had {{abandoned}} the coalition and increasingly viewed the Bolsheviks as traitors to the revolution. In July 1918, the Left Socialist Revolutionary Yakov Grigorevich Blumkin assassinated the German ambassador to Russia, Wilhelm von Mirbach, hoping that the ensuing <b>diplomatic</b> <b>incident</b> {{would lead to a}} relaunched revolutionary war against Germany. The Left Socialist Revolutionaries then launched a coup in Moscow, shelling the Kremlin and seizing the city's central post office before being stopped by Trotsky's forces. The party's leaders and many members were arrested and imprisoned, but were treated more leniently than other opponents of the Bolsheviks.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} international {{reaction was}} extremely critical of Lumumba. Lumumba's attack on colonialism was especially {{interpreted as an}} attack on Belgium itself and nearly provoked a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>incident</b> between the two countries. International observers though the speech unwise, ungrateful and tactless. The confrontational attitude taken by Lumumba appeared to confirm Belgian and American suspicions that Lumumba was a dangerous radical. Between September 1960 and January 1961, partly at the instigation of the two countries, Lumumba was deposed from power, arrested and executed with the complicity of both the Congolese and Katangese governments.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Liverpool gained four battle honours and {{was seriously}} damaged in two attacks by Italian torpedo bombers. The cruiser {{operated}} variously with the naval {{stations in the}} East Indies and China and with the Mediterranean and Home fleets. While assigned to the China Station in January 1940, the cruiser instigated a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>incident</b> with Japan when she intercepted the liner Asama Maru {{off the coast of}} Japan. Liverpool fought in the battles of the Espero Convoy and Calabria, the Arctic Convoys, and Operation Harpoon during the Malta Convoys. An aerial attack on 14 June 1942, during Operation Harpoon, proved to be the ship's final combat of the war. For the remainder of the conflict, Liverpool underwent repairs and refitting at Rosyth, Scotland.|$|E

5|$|In April 1898, Schwalbe was recommissioned {{for another}} tour abroad. She first {{returned}} to German East Africa, where the Second Boer War threatened regional stability; British warships began seizing German vessels suspected of carrying contraband to the Boers. This created a major <b>diplomatic</b> <b>incident</b> and Schwalbe {{was sent to}} protect German shipping in the area. The outbreak of the Boxer Rebellion in Qing China in 1900 {{proved to be more}} pressing, and so Schwalbe was sent to join the Eight Nation Alliance that had formed to crush the Boxers. During her deployment to China, she helped blockade the Yangtze and sent landing parties ashore to control unrest in Ningpo. In mid-1902, she was recalled to Germany for a second time, was overhauled, and was again decommissioned.|$|E
5|$|The Italian cruiser Vettor Pisani was {{the name}} ship of her class of two armored cruisers built for the Royal Italian Navy (Regia Marina) in the 1890s. She often served as a {{flagship}} during her career and frequently served overseas. On one of these deployments, the ship received a radio message from Peking, {{one of the first}} long-range radio transmissions to a ship. Vettor Pisani participated in the Boxer Rebellion of 1900 and the Italo-Turkish War of 1911–12, during which her admiral nearly caused a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>incident</b> with the Austro-Hungarian Empire. During World War I, her activities were limited by the threat of Austro-Hungarian submarines and she was converted into a repair ship in 1916. Vettor Pisani was stricken from the Navy List in 1920 and scrapped later that year.|$|E
5|$|While {{based in}} Newfoundland, Admiral Murray hosted {{a visit from}} the Free French Admiral Muselier. Acting on orders from the Admiralty, Murray gave Muselier {{temporary}} command of three French corvettes and a submarine that were assigned to Murray's fleet, for passage to Halifax. On return from Halifax, Muselier took the vessels to Vichy-controlled Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and on 24 December 1941 raised the Free French flag on the islands. This was interpreted as a territorial claim on behalf of General Charles de Gaulle, thereby creating a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>incident</b> between France, Canada and the United States. De Gaulle's seizure of the archipelago was over the opposition of Canada, Great Britain, and the United States, which were concerned about pushing the Vichy government into an openly pro-German stance.|$|E
5|$|Improper {{adherence}} to these flag dimensions {{have led to}} embarrassing <b>diplomatic</b> <b>incidents.</b> During the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Chinese flags used during the opening ceremony and two medal ceremonies featured the four small stars incorrectly angled in the same direction, inciting fury in the Olympic organisers.|$|R

5|$|Chakotay's backstory was {{explained}} {{during the course}} of Star Trek: Voyager. He was born in 2329 on a Federation colony near Cardassian space in the demilitarized zone. While young, he was looked after by his grandfather. At the age of 15, Chakotay visited Earth with his father, who sought to find his tribe's ancestral home in Central America and the descendants of the Rubber Tree People. He was resistant to this, and instead dreamed of going into space and had heroes such as John Kelly, a pioneering astronaut in the early 21st century. He chose to enter Starfleet Academy against his father's wishes, and his entry was sponsored by Captain Sulu. He attended Starfleet Academy from 2344 to 2348, where he engaged in the sport of boxing. After graduating, he was assigned to a starship. One of his earliest away missions resulted in a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>incident</b> on Ktaria VII, and he was also on the team that made first contact with the Tarkannans.|$|E
5|$|In April 1945, Cockcroft and Oliphant scouted a {{site for}} a similar {{establishment}} in Britain, settling on RAF Harwell. Cockcroft was offered the directorship of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE) at Harwell on 9 November 1945. The official announcement was made on 29 January 1946, but the news leaked {{two months before the}} announcement, and before the Canadian government was informed, creating a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>incident.</b> It was agreed that Cockcroft would not depart until a successor was found, and he did not depart Chalk River for Harwell until 30 September 1946. In the meantime he recruited staff for the new laboratory. Klaus Fuchs from the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory became head of the Theoretical Physics; Robert Spence, Cockcroft's deputy at Montreal Laboratory, became head of Chemistry; H.W.B. Skinner, of General Physics; Otto Frisch, of Nuclear Physics; and John Dunworth, of Reactor Physics. Fuchs was later arrested as a Soviet spy on 3 February 1950.|$|E
5|$|Marco Polo was {{an armored}} cruiser {{built for the}} Royal Italian Navy (Regia Marina) in the 1890s, the first of her type in Italian service. The ship spent the bulk of her career {{deployed}} in the Far East. Between deployments she participated in the Italo-Turkish War of 1911–12 during which she caused a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>incident</b> with the Austro-Hungarian Empire. After that affair Marco Polo was sent to Libya where she bombarded the towns of Homs, and Zuara and the defenses of the Dardanelles. In between these operations, the ship provided naval gunfire support to the Royal Italian Army in Libya. Due to her age, Marco Polo did not {{play a significant role}} in World War I, serving as an accommodation ship in Venice until she began conversion into a troopship in 1917. After a series of renamings in 1920–21, the ship was stricken from the naval register in 1922 and subsequently sold for scrap.|$|E

40|$|When proselytism and {{humanitarian}} assistance are combined, this connection is always controversial and sometimes covert. Although they {{may seem to}} be distinct activities, each partakes of a similar strategic logic: both are undertaken by faith-based organizations (FBOs) for their own purposes, both can generate external effects on governments and other political actors, and both elicit government efforts at manipulation that can, in some instances, escalate into diplomatic tensions or international conflict. To what extent can faith-based <b>diplomatic</b> <b>incidents</b> be said to originate in strategically sophisticated behavior on the part of FBOs? This paper begins to specify an extensive-form game model of strategic interactions among FBOs involved in proselytism and/or humanitarian aid, their state sponsors (typically the USA), and governments in areas in which these activities take place. Illustrative examples of different configurations of interest and strategic calculation in faith-based <b>diplomatic</b> <b>incidents</b> are discussed...|$|R
5|$|Jardine {{threatened}} to withdraw his {{team from the}} Fourth and Fifth Tests unless the Australian Board retracted the accusation of unsporting behaviour. The MCC responded angrily to the accusations of unsporting conduct, played down the Australian claims {{about the danger of}} Bodyline and {{threatened to}} call off the tour. The series had become a major <b>diplomatic</b> <b>incident</b> by this stage, and many people saw Bodyline as damaging to an international relationship that needed to remain strong. The public in both England and Australia reacted with outrage towards the other nation. Alexander Hore-Ruthven, the Governor of South Australia, who was in England at the time, expressed his concern to J. H. Thomas, the British Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs that this would cause a significant impact on trade between the nations. The standoff was settled only when Australian Prime Minister Joseph Lyons met members of the Australian Board and outlined to them the severe economic hardships that could be caused in Australia if the British public boycotted Australian trade. Given this understanding, the Board withdrew the allegation of unsportsmanlike behaviour two days before the fourth Test, thus saving the tour. However, correspondence continued for almost a year. Fingleton was dropped after scoring a pair in the third Test, and England won the final two matches to win the series 4–1.|$|E
