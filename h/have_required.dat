5|$|An {{estimated}} 35,000–40,000 {{people were}} killed outright by the bombing at Nagasaki. A total of 60,000–80,000 fatalities resulted, including from long-term health effects, the strongest of which was leukemia, with an attributable risk of 46% for bomb victims. Others died later from related blast and burn injuries, and hundreds more from radiation illnesses from exposure to the bomb's initial radiation. Most of the direct deaths and injuries sustained from the bombing were munitions or industrial workers. Mitsubishi's industrial production in the city were also severed by the attack; the dockyard would have produced at 80 percent of its full capacity within three to four months, the steel works would <b>have</b> <b>required</b> {{a year to get}} back to substantial production, the electric works would have resumed some production within two months and been back at capacity within six months, and the restoration of the arms plant to 60 to 70 percent of former capacity would <b>have</b> <b>required</b> 15 months. The Mitsubishi-Urakami Ordnance Works, the factory that manufactured the type 91 torpedoes released in the attack on Pearl Harbor, was destroyed in the blast.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the capitulation, Imperos hull was 88% {{complete}} and the engines were 76% complete, but overall the ship was only 28% complete; it would <b>have</b> <b>required</b> about eighteen more months of full work to be finished. Key features like the armament, electrical wiring and a reworking of the bridge had still not been completed.|$|E
5|$|Direct Ascent: The {{spacecraft}} {{would be}} launched {{as a unit}} and travel directly to the Moon and land. It would return, leaving its landing stage on the Moon. This design would <b>have</b> <b>required</b> development of the extremely powerful Nova launch vehicle.|$|E

5|$|England faced {{a target}} of 596, which would <b>have</b> <b>required</b> a world record Test run-chase—no team had {{successfully}} chased down more than 400 for victory. Early on, Washbrook pulled Lindwall for a four, almost collecting Barnes in the nose in his customary short leg position. Australia bowled out the hosts for 186 to win by 409 runs and take a 2–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|However, Lukin {{claims that}} hot-water {{drilling}} {{is much more}} dangerous for the microbiotic fauna, as it would boil the living species, plus disturb the entire structure of water layers of the lake.

5|$|Kefalas {{proposed}} {{a bill to}} explore alternative voting systems, which was defeated in committee, but {{which led to the}} creation of an 11-member multi-partisan task force to study related issues.

5|$|Obama {{sponsored}} {{legislation that}} would <b>have</b> <b>required</b> nuclear plant owners to notify state and local authorities of radioactive leaks, but the bill failed to pass in the full Senate after being heavily modified in committee. Regarding tort reform, Obama voted for the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 and the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which grants immunity from civil liability to telecommunications companies complicit with NSA warrantless wiretapping operations.|$|E

5|$|Seven of {{the nine}} {{surviving}} stones are under 90 centimetres (3 feet) tall, {{but two of the}} north-west stones are considerably larger. Located opposite the circle's two shortest stones, one is thin and pointed, reaching 2.1 metres (7 feet) high, while the other is broader, measuring 1.8 metres square (6 feet by 6 feet). The largest of the stones weighs approximately 7.3 tonnes (8 tons) and would <b>have</b> <b>required</b> the efforts of many people to move and erect it.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} reissued {{nationwide}} once more on April 15, 1977, {{this time with}} simulated stereo sound. This edit featured the RKO distribution logo being replaced with that of Buena Vista Distribution, since RKO had not {{been part of a}} release since 1946. It had not been removed earlier as the credit sequence would <b>have</b> <b>required</b> to be re-shot. A two-and-a-half-minute reduction in the film's running time in this version remains unclear in existing records.|$|E
5|$|With the {{development}} of modern quantum mechanical theories of electron configurations within atoms, {{it became apparent that}} each period (row) in the table corresponded to the filling of a quantum shell of electrons.
