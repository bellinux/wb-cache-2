5|$|Critics praised Undead Nightmare as a {{model for}} {{downloadable}} content especially in its balance of content and price. Neil Davey (The Guardian) said that it was the best purchase of 2010 at its price range, but staff of the Official Xbox Magazine found the price slightly too high. Henry Gilbert of GamesRadar thought that the game's concept sounded like a ploy to make <b>easy</b> <b>money</b> without much work, but admitted how wrong and surprised he was at the game's depth. At the time of its 2010 release, the Official Xbox Magazine counted Undead Nightmare among the best downloadable content in existence. The standalone retail disc had sold two million units as of August 2011. No sales figures were released regarding the download pack itself.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the main}} factors driving the Mexican Drug War is the {{willingness}} of mainly lower-class people to earn <b>easy</b> <b>money</b> joining criminal organizations, {{and the failure of}} the government to provide the legal means for the creation of well paid jobs. From 2004 to 2008 the portion of the population who received {{less than half of the}} median income rose from 17% to 21% and the proportion of population living in extreme or moderate poverty rose from 35 to 46% (52 million persons) between 2006 and 2010.|$|E

25|$|In 1978, the court's Marquette Bank decision, {{which held}} {{that under the}} National Banking Act of 1863 states could not enforce their anti-usury laws against nationally-chartered banks based in other states, {{opened the door to}} {{increased}} credit card spending by Americans. Other forms of consumer credit, such as title and payday loans, became available for those who could not get even the most restrictive credit cards available. Social activists criticized the banks and companies that engaged in those practices, calling them predatory lenders who targeted the poor with promises of no credit check and <b>easy</b> <b>money</b> that only came at extremely high interest rates, profiting when the loans were extended long beyond the original short term.|$|E

25|$|Besides {{top rated}} {{universities}} which provide highly competitive world class education to their pupils, India {{is also home}} to many universities which have been founded with the sole objective of making <b>easy</b> <b>money.</b> Regulatory authorities like UGC and AICTE have been trying very hard to extirpate the menace of private universities which are running courses without any affiliation or recognition. Indian Government has failed to check on these education shops, which are run by big businessmen & politicians. Many private colleges and universities do not fulfil the required criterion by the Government and central bodies (UGC, AICTE, MCI, BCI etc.) and take students for a ride. For example, many institutions in India continue to run unaccredited courses as there is no legislation strong enough to ensure legal action against them. Quality assurance mechanisms have failed to stop misrepresentations and malpractices in higher education. At the same time regulatory bodies have been accused of corruption, specifically in the case of deemed-universities. In this context of lack of solid quality assurance mechanism, institutions need to step-up and set higher standards of self-regulation.|$|E

500|$|Morton was reelected to the U.S. Senate in 1873, {{and began}} {{his second term}} in 1874. His stand on paper money added to his {{controversial}} reputation. During a time of serious economic hardship and deflation, Morton favored {{a bill that would}} have added more paper currency to the money supply. He began his second term by leading the Senate's support for an inflation bill that President Grant vetoed. [...] Morton's action was politically astute. In Indiana the demands for <b>easy</b> <b>money</b> topped the Democrats' list of priority issues, and in the fall of 1874, they carried the state's elections largely on that basis. However, within a year, Morton joined other Republicans in supporting the Specie Payment Resumption Act, which effectively suspended new currency issues and gave the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury the authority to withdraw currency from circulation.|$|E

Copeland continued sales of the latter game after Parker Brothers attempted a patent lawsuit against him. Parker Brothers held the Magie and Darrow patents, but settled with Copeland rather than going to trial, since Copeland was prepared to have witnesses testify that they had played Monopoly before Darrow's [...] "invention" [...] of the game.
