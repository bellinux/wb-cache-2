5|$|Fort Stikine {{arrived at}} Bombay {{in the early}} morning of 12 April. Having taken on a pilot shortly before 10:00 she was docked at the Victoria Dock at midday. The {{practice}} of flying a red flag to signify <b>dangerous</b> <b>cargo</b> on board had been discontinued in wartime as doing so would identify such vessels {{in the event of an}} enemy air raid on a port. Also, the practice on unloading such vessels into lighters offshore had also been discontinued due to the war. At the time, explosives were graded as Category A, B, or C. Category A explosives, such as those carried on board Fort Stikine, were the most dangerous. These were only allowed to be offloaded onto lighters, and not directly to the quayside.|$|E
5|$|The force {{deployed}} {{with a large}} {{quantity of}} construction and other equipment, including 24 Land Rovers, 19 Unimog all-terrain vehicles, 26 heavy trucks, 43 trailers, eight bulldozers {{and a variety of}} other road-building equipment such as graders, scrapers and rollers. The support workshop added a further 40 vehicles, and over 1,800 tonnes of stores were shipped with the contingent's equipment. There was a total of over 200 wheeled and tracked vehicles and trailers and a large quantity of <b>dangerous</b> <b>cargo</b> (demolition explosives and ammunition). The UN hired the MV Mistra for the deployment. It departed Sydney on 23 March; the equipment was unloaded at Walvis Bay in mid-April, moving by road and rail to the South African Defence Force Logistics Base at Grootfontein.|$|E
25|$|She was {{chartered}} {{to carry}} a complete cargo of miscellaneous types of military explosives from New York to France in November 1917. Mont-Blanc was not an especially old vessel but was a relatively slow, common, three-island type tramp steamer, typical of many wartime freighters. She left New York December 1 to join a convoy in Halifax, Nova Scotia. She arrived from New York late on 5 December, {{under the command of}} Aimé Le Medec. The vessel was fully loaded with the explosives TNT and picric acid, the high-octane fuel benzole, and guncotton. She intended to join a slow convoy gathering in Bedford Basin readying to depart for Europe, but was too late to enter the harbour before the nets were raised. Ships carrying <b>dangerous</b> <b>cargo</b> were not allowed into the harbour before the war, but the risks posed by German submarines had resulted in a relaxation of regulations.|$|E

500|$|The {{death toll}} {{could have been}} worse {{had it not been for}} the {{self-sacrifice}} of an Intercolonial Railway dispatcher, Patrick Vincent (Vince) Coleman, operating at the railyard about [...] from Pier 6, where the explosion occurred. He and his co-worker, William Lovett, learned of the <b>dangerous</b> <b>cargo</b> aboard the burning Mont-Blanc from a sailor and began to flee. Coleman remembered, however, that an incoming passenger train from Saint John, New Brunswick, was due to arrive at the railyard within minutes. He returned to his post alone and continued to send out urgent telegraph messages to stop the train. Several variations of the message have been reported, among them this from the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic: [...] "Hold up the train. Ammunition ship afire in harbor making for Pier 6 and will explode. Guess this will be my last message. Good-bye boys." [...] Coleman's message was responsible for bringing all incoming trains around Halifax to a halt. It was heard by other stations all along the Intercolonial Railway, helping railway officials to respond immediately. Passenger Train No. 10, the overnight train from Saint John, is believed to have heeded the warning and stopped a safe distance from the blast at Rockingham, saving the lives of about 300 railway passengers. Coleman was killed at his post as the explosion ripped through the city. He was honoured with a Heritage Minute in the 1990s and inducted into the Canadian Railway Hall of Fame in 2004.|$|E

2500|$|Titan Salvage was {{contracted}} by {{the owners}} {{to remove the}} endosulfan, along with some additional dangerous cargos in a second container. Both cargos were located in containers in the [...] "D" [...] deck of the capsized vessel. Titan Salvage assembled a salvage team consisting of the following companies: Harbor Star, a Philippine tug and salvage company; Global Diving & Salvage, a U.S. based diving company specializing in hazardous diving operations; and South Pacific Environmental, a Guam-based company specializing in hazardous chemical mitigation. The salvage team began the actual endosulfan recovery operations on September 24, 2008, and by October 5, all 402 of the 25kg drums had been safely recovered from the first 40ft container located near the aft end of [...] "D" [...] deck in about 85ft of water. The salvage team then proceeded to remove the other dangerous cargos from a 20ft container located {{toward the center of}} [...] "D" [...] deck in about 35ft of water. On October 11, it was determined that all of the <b>dangerous</b> <b>cargo</b> located in the second container had been safely recovered. The salvage team drilled into the ship's hull to remove the ship's fuel, and this phase was completed by October 17. Approximately 200,000 liters were recovered.|$|E
60|$|Since {{they had}} brought their <b>dangerous</b> <b>cargo</b> to the spot agreed, Kit was {{resolved}} it must be landed. To carry out Yusuf's orders was perhaps the best plan to defeat his treachery, and Kit thought his doing so had a touch of humour. He felt {{he would like to}} see Yusuf again, but he need not bother much about Revillon. The Frenchman had chased Mossamedes and lost her; if he returned at daybreak, he would not venture across the sands. Anyhow, they could get rid of the evidence against them soon after they saw the gunboat's smoke. All the same, Kit meant to land the guns.|$|E

60|$|Grahame, the leadline in his hand, leaned anxiously on the rail, {{watching}} the foam boil about the vessel's side. Her keel stirred {{in the sand}} and the propeller was beating hard; but she did not move. To make things worse, the disturbed water broke noisily on the beach and the thud of engines could be heard at some distance. Grahame had not complied with the formalities required before leaving port, but he carried a <b>dangerous</b> <b>cargo</b> and he feared that he might be detained unless he got away at once. The Enchantress, however, was not yet afloat, and he reluctantly signaled for steam to be shut off.|$|E
60|$|One morning Kit {{went to the}} bridge. The sun was {{not high}} {{and the air was}} fresh. The wind had dropped, and the faint haze that {{generally}} softens the light and glitter when the Trade-breeze blows had vanished. The sky was a harsh, vivid blue, and the tops of the long rollers cut the horizon with sharp distinctness. They did not break, but rose and subsided, leaving here and there soft streaks of foam. For all that, the swell ran high, Mossamedes lurched about, and Kit thought wind was coming. He was bothered about it. If the wind were fresh, they could not land their <b>dangerous</b> <b>cargo.</b> The mate leaned against a stanchion and searched the sky-line with his glasses. After a time he gave the glasses to Kit.|$|E
