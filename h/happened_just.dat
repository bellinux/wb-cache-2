5|$|The {{damage from}} Rosita made a large {{impact on the}} tourist industry. The time of impact <b>happened</b> <b>just</b> before the Easter and ANZAC Day Holiday period. Easter is {{considered}} to be the beginning of the tourist season, so it is usually expected that there will be an increase of visitors into Broome at this time. Many visitors delayed or cancelled their trips, and some cut short their holiday. Car hire companies that had been booked out for the holiday period had people returning vehicles early.|$|E

25|$|The first breed {{club was}} set up in Dublin in 1879. Irish Terriers were the first members of the terrier group to be {{recognised}} by the English Kennel Club as a native Irish Breed – this <b>happened</b> <b>just</b> {{before the end of the}} 19th century. The first Irish Terriers were taken to the US in the late nineteenth century and quickly became somewhat popular.|$|E
25|$|On 17 May 1985, a fire {{swept through}} the then fifty-year-old main stand 'The Grandstand'. This <b>happened</b> <b>just</b> six days after a fire at Vally Parade stadium in Bradford, in which sadly over fifty people lost their lives. Fortunately this {{incident}} occurred {{in the early hours}} of the morning, and so nobody was injured. After initially suspecting that this could have been a copycat arson of the Bradford City stadium fire, eventual cause was attributed to an electrical fault.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} season {{ranks among}} the club's worst, as they managed just seven victories all season and finished in the bottom position of the league table. Relegation to the league's basement division <b>happened</b> <b>just</b> six years after promotion to the top flight. However, success followed relegation under Sam Allardyce. The Magpies secured the Division Three title in March 1998 by a record margin of seventeen points. They became the first side since World War II to win promotion in mid-March, with six games still remaining.|$|E
25|$|The pilots {{initially}} {{believed that}} a bomb had gone off inside the airplane, as this accident <b>happened</b> <b>just</b> two months after Pan Am Flight 103 was blown up over Lockerbie, Scotland. They began an emergency descent {{in order to reach}} an altitude where the air was breathable, while also performing a 180-degree left turn to fly back to Honolulu. The explosion damaged components of the on-board emergency oxygen supply system, as it was primarily located in the forward cargo sidewall area, just aft of the cargo door.|$|E
25|$|Following the spree, the Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard, {{introduced}} strict {{gun control}} laws within Australia and formulated the National Firearms Programme Implementation Act 1996, restricting the private ownership of high capacity semi-automatic rifles, semi-automatic shotguns and pump-action shotguns {{as well as}} introducing uniform firearms licensing. It was implemented with bipartisan support by the Commonwealth, states and territories. The massacre <b>happened</b> <b>just</b> six weeks after the Dunblane massacre, in Scotland, which claimed 18 lives, with U.K. Prime Minister John Major reaching out to his counterpart over the shared tragedies; the United Kingdom passed its own changes to gun laws in 1997.|$|E

25|$|While the {{earthquake}} {{quickly became the}} only subject on talkback radio, other early coverage relied on comments from Police and other 24-hour services who were immediately affected and needed {{to communicate with the}} media. Because {{the earthquake}} occurred early on a Saturday morning, with only overnight staff on duty, it took several hours for some media outlets to give the event full live coverage. So it took until mid-morning for some media outlets to have sufficient stories and staff on duty to allow them to commence continuous live broadcasts. One television producer later observed that if the earthquake had <b>happened</b> <b>just</b> a few hours earlier, or later, they would have had a full studio crew on duty and have been able to go live immediately.|$|E
25|$|One day, Léon meets Mathilda Lando (Portman), {{a lonely}} 12-year-old girl. Mathilda {{lives with her}} {{dysfunctional}} family in an apartment down the hall, and has stopped attending class at her school for troubled girls. Mathilda's abusive father (Michael Badalucco) attracts the ire of corrupt DEA agents, who have been paying him to stash cocaine in his apartment. After they discover he has been cutting the cocaine to keep for himself, DEAagents storm the building, led by sharply dressed drug addict Norman Stansfield (Oldman). During the raid, Stansfield quickly becomes unhinged and murders Mathilda's entire family while she is out shopping for groceries. When Mathilda returns, she realizes what has <b>happened</b> <b>just</b> in time to continue {{down the hall to}} Léon's apartment, who hesitantly gives her shelter.|$|E
25|$|Mille's group found {{a friend}} in Constantin Stere, by then a {{maverick}} member of the PNL, who began maneuvering against the PNL's right-wing from the inside. Managing a literary sheet {{put out by the}} pro-PNL Evenimentul, Stere supported Adevărul in its campaign for literary didacticism, and organized rallies of solidarity with the Bucharest socialists. This <b>happened</b> <b>just</b> as Toni was publishing satirical pieces targeting Evenimentul owner George A. Scorțescu, which left Stere in an awkward position. Stere was consequently accused by Evenimentul of being a spy and a tool for the Conservatives. The incidents were reviewed with caution by Adevărul, whose panelists feared that a Conservative conspiracy was in the making, but Toni also criticized the PNL papers for suggesting the same.|$|E

25|$|Between 1992 and {{the early}} parts of 1994 the Headshrinkers {{maintained}} {{a position in the}} middle of the tag-team division, occasionally challenging for the titles and making sporadic PPV appearances feuding with teams like The Smokin' Gunns and Men on a Mission. The Headshrinkers assisted their relative Yokozuna in a casket match against The Undertaker at the 1994 Royal Rumble. In April 1994 the Headshrinkers turned face and challenged then tag-team champions The Quebecers, with the addition of manager Lou Albano the team won the gold on April 26, 1994. At King of the Ring 1994 on June 19 the Headshrinkers successfully defended their tag-team titles against Yokozuna and Crush. Their run with the titles came to a surprising end on an untelevised card on August 28 where they lost the titles to Shawn Michaels and Diesel. The title change <b>happened</b> <b>just</b> one day before they were scheduled to defend against Irwin R. Schyster and Bam Bam Bigelow. Soon after the title change Samu left the WWF to recover from injuries and was replaced by Sione.|$|E
25|$|On 2 June 2003, Coast Air {{started its}} first head-on {{competition}} with Scandinavian Airlines. Using the ATR planes, Coast Air started with two daily round services between Haugesund and Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. By September, Coast Air increased to three daily round trips, and reduced prices to NOK500. From 9 October, Scandinavian Airlines reduced their prices by 22% {{on the route}}. On 16 February, Coast Air also started competing with Braathens and Widerøe on the route between Stavanger and Bergen, marketing it as a low-fare service and ticket prices as low as NOK199. The Haugesund–Oslo route cost Coast Air NOK11 million in 2003. In March 2004, Coast Air was forced to close the Stord to Oslo route, after several reductions in frequency during the past year. To create more inertia on the Bergen–Stavanger route, Coast Air also started a cooperation with DAT, where the latter flew an extra daily round trip. Following the losses of the Haugesund–Oslo and Bergen–Stavanger routes, they were terminated in May 2004. In December, the Norwegian Competition Authority started investigating Scandinavian Airlines for illegal price dumping on the Oslo–Haugesund route. The authority suspected that SAS had illegally cross-subsidized the route {{to fend off the}} competition, and announced the company would be fined NOK20 million. The case ended in Oslo District Court, where Scandinavian Airlines was found not guilty. Though initially appealed by the authority, the matter was settled out-of-court in December 2007, in which the airline agreed that they had broken the law, but that since it <b>happened</b> <b>just</b> after the act came into power, they would not have to pay the fine.|$|E

5000|$|The {{argument}} that AtmA+atat(आत्मा+अतत् [...] ) cannot <b>happen</b> <b>just</b> as brahmaa + ashiraha(ब्रह्मा+अशिरः) cannot is not valid.

One cannot even argue that since rpanam is meaningless, it has to be arpanam. The {{argument that}} AtmA+atat(आत्मा+अतत् [...] ) cannot <b>happen</b> is baseless, <b>just</b> as brahma+arpanam (ब्रह्मा+अर्पणम्) cannot happen is also baseless.

500|$|The Bishopsgate bombing {{occurred}} on Saturday 24 April 1993, when the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) detonated a powerful truck bomb on Bishopsgate, a major thoroughfare in London's financial district, the City of London. Telephoned warnings were sent {{about an hour}} beforehand, but a news photographer {{was killed in the}} blast and 44 people were injured. [...] The damage cost £350 million to repair. As a result of the bombing, which <b>happened</b> <b>just</b> over a year after the bombing of the nearby Baltic Exchange, a [...] "ring of steel" [...] was implemented to protect the City, and many firms introduced disaster recovery plans in case of further attacks or similar disasters.|$|E
500|$|After Hitler's {{mother died}} of breast cancer in 1907, the funeral {{procession}} went through Urfahr to Leonding. Kubizek remarks that Hitler said he had seen Stefanie at the funeral procession, which gave him some consolation. Kubizek claims that [...] "Stefanie had no idea how deeply Adolf was in love with her; she regarded him as a somewhat shy, but nevertheless remarkably tenacious and faithful, admirer. When she responded with a smile to his inquiring glance, he was happy and his mood became unlike anything I had ever observed in him. But when Stefanie, as <b>happened</b> <b>just</b> as often, coldly ignored his gaze, he was crushed and ready to destroy himself and the whole world." ...|$|E
500|$|Fritz the Cat {{is set in}} a [...] "modern 'supercity' of {{millions}} of animals." [...] Stories begin simply and become increasingly chaotic and complex as the narrative responds to uncontrollable forces. The look of Fritz the Cat comics was characterized by the use of the Rapidograph technical pen and a simple drawing style Robert Crumb used to facilitate his story telling. Crumb states that much of the comic books he enjoyed as a child were funny animal comics, particularly those of Carl Barks. Crumb was later influenced by Walt Kelly's daily anthropomorphic funny animal comic strip Pogo; Crumb did not copy Kelly's comics directly, but states that he imitated his drawing style closely; Crumb admired Kelly's storytelling style, which [...] "seemed [...] plotless and casually done. The characters talked to each other and nothing much <b>happened.</b> <b>Just</b> a lot of foolishness takes place". Robert Crumb stated of his anthropomorphic work: ...|$|E
