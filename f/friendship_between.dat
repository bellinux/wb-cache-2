40|$|The {{nature and}} quality of preadolescent <b>friendships</b> <b>between</b> {{children}} with and without learning problems due to mental retardation or mild cognitive difficulties were investigated. Based on {{an assessment of the}} reciprocal relationship status of 373 children, including 54 with learning problems, 33 friend and 32 acquaintance dyads were identified. Of these dyads, half included a child with learning problems and half consisted of 2 children without learning problems. The dyads were observed performing a play task. Unlike <b>friendships</b> <b>between</b> children without disabilities, <b>friendships</b> <b>between</b> children with and without learning problems were marked by limited collaboration and shared decision-making, a low level of cooperative play and shared laughter, and an asymmetrical, hierarchical division of roles. The importance of advancing beyond the study of the social acceptance of children with learning problems to study the qualitative aspects of their friendships was discussed...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} <b>friendships</b> <b>between</b> gay male athletes and their heterosexual teammates. Six gay college athletes from various athletic and geographical backgrounds, recruited through a gay sports website and a gay sports documentary, were interviewed.

The interviews were analyzed through grounded analysis to identify seven “zones of intimacy” and five other unique friendship themes. These intimacy zones and friendship themes were investigated for homosocial patterns, relationship reciprocity, and self-disclosure, among other themes. Despite sports culture’s homophobia, these friendships exhibit as much intimacy, if not more, than <b>friendships</b> <b>between</b> two heterosexual teammates...|$|R
