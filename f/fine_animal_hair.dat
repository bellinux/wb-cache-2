5000|$|Some of {{the oldest}} {{surviving}} African textiles were discovered at the archaeological site of Kissi in northern Burkina Faso. They are made of wool or <b>fine</b> <b>animal</b> <b>hair</b> in a weft-faced plain weave pattern. [...] Further cloth fragments and parchment fragments date to the ninth century from sites at Igbo Ukwu of the Igbo people of Nigeria. A considerable amount of cotton and wool textiles (clothes, shrouds and accessories) have been preserved in the Tellem caves in Mali, dating mainly to the eleventh to thirteenth centuries. Some fragments have also survived from the thirteenth century Benin City in Nigeria.|$|E

50|$|The blue swallow {{arrives on}} the {{breeding}} range {{at the end}} of September and constructs cup-shaped nests from mud and grass on the inside of sinkhole cavities, aardvark burrows and old mine shafts. The breeding system of the blue swallow is not well understood although co-operative breeding has been widely recorded in this species. The nests are lined with <b>fine</b> grass, <b>animal</b> <b>hair</b> and white feathers. Normally, three white eggs are laid. They are incubated by the female for 14 days, and the chicks are fed for approximately 22 days until they fledge. Once fledged, the young spend {{the next couple of days}} around the nest site before disappearing. Most blue swallows will rear a second brood before returning to the over-wintering grounds in April.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to examine the frequency of human and <b>animal</b> <b>hair</b> in motor vehicles in the Lincoln, NE area. We were looking specifically at <b>animal</b> <b>hair</b> {{to see if there is}} a significant difference in the distribution of <b>animal</b> <b>hair</b> in pet-owner and non pet-owner vehicles. Finding a significantly high distribution of <b>animal</b> <b>hair</b> in pet-owner vehicles would lead us to believe that an association could be made between a suspect owning an animal and their presence at a crime scene. Our null hypothesis is that there is no significance in the distribution of cat/dog hairs found in the motor vehicles in the Lincoln, Nebraska geographical area...|$|R

Forensic scientist determine the number of things from hair sample, from the crimescene i. e, verifying whether the hair in question is that of human or an <b>animal,</b> if the <b>hair</b> is from <b>animal,</b> the forensic investigator can potentially identify the species from which it is originated, the hair can be of pet or wild animal, the clues reveals including which part of the body hair came from, if human hair; race of the person, gender, age, if the hair shed naturally or pulled from someone's body part. In the present study different species of <b>animal</b> <b>hair</b> i. e., Dog, Cat, Buffalo, Cow are collected from local area of PalamVihar, Gurugram were microscopically examined. This research paper provides the data to the identification and comparison of different <b>animal</b> <b>hair</b> with respect to their medullary index based on their microscopic examination because hair is strongly resistant from decomposition and this property makes hair a nearly ideal type of physical evidence...|$|R

40|$|The {{examination}} of hair collected from crime scenes {{is an important}} and highly informative discipline relevant to many forensic investigations. However, the forensic identification of <b>animal</b> (non-human) <b>hairs</b> requires different skill sets and competencies to those required for human hair comparisons. The aim of this is paper {{is not only to}} highlight the intrinsic differences between forensic human hair comparison and forensic <b>animal</b> <b>hair</b> identification, but also discuss the utility and reliability of the two in the context of possibilities and pitfalls. It also addresses and dispels some of the more popular myths and misconceptions surrounding the microscopical {{examination of}} <b>animal</b> <b>hairs.</b> Furthermore, future directions of this discipline are explored through the proposal of recommendations for minimum standards for the morphological identification of <b>animal</b> <b>hairs</b> and the significance of the newly developed guidelines by SWGWILD is discussed...|$|R

40|$|For {{thousands}} of years, <b>animal</b> <b>hairs</b> have been merely considered as textile fibers with outstanding performances such as excellent elasticity and thermal insulation. Only recently, we have obtained indications that <b>animal</b> <b>hair</b> {{may be a}} smart natural material which displays shape memory (SM) effects responsive to four types of stimuli: heat, water, redox agents and UV-light. These smart functions of <b>animal</b> <b>hair</b> {{are found to be}} the result of its three structural components: crystals, and hydrogen (HB) and disulfide (DB) bonds among its intra- and inter-macromolecules. In this paper, camel hair was employed as one typical <b>animal</b> <b>hair</b> to investigate the SM abilities under four types of stimuli, in which the HBs were analyzed by Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy and the DBs by Raman spectroscopy, while the Tg and crystal structure of camel hair were determined using differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction. The shape fixation and recovery ratios were determined using an Instron tensile tester with an environmental chamber. It was discovered that the crystals in hair remain intact under the four stimuli, indicating their role as netpoints for hair SM. Under the stimuli of water and heat, the DBs of hair were characterized as unchangeable, whereas the HBs were found to vary under dry and wet conditions, indicating the roles of DBs as netpoints and HBs as switch units. For UV-light, HBs and crystals were found to be invariable and DBs were converted into thiol groups under a UV stimulus. With a redox agent containing reductant ions and aqueous molecules, it was found that DBs and HBs both worked as switch units and crystals acted as netpoints. Thus, the SM mechanism of <b>animal</b> <b>hair</b> was modelled through a twin-netpoint-switch structure. Beneficially, this natural insight can help to inspire applications for making synthetic materials with smarter functions for more environmental adaptability and impactful applications.

40|$|<b>Animal</b> <b>hairs</b> {{consisting}} of α-keratin biopolymers existing broadly in nature may {{be responsive to}} water for recovery to the innate shape from their fixed deformation, thus possess smart behavior, namely shape memory effect (SME). In this article, three typical <b>animal</b> <b>hair</b> fibers were first time investigated for their water-stimulated SME, and therefrom to identify the corresponding net-points and switches in their molecular and morphological structures. Experimentally, the SME manifested a good stability of high shape fixation ratio and reasonable recovery rate after many cycles of deformation programming under water stimulation. The effects of hydration on hair lateral size, recovery kinetics, dynamic mechanical behaviors and structural components (crystal, disulfide and hydrogen bonds) were then systematically studied. SME mechanisms were explored based on the variations of structural components in molecular assemblies of such smart fibers. A hybrid structural network model with single-switch and twin-net-points was thereafter proposed to interpret the water-stimulated shape memory mechanism of <b>animal</b> <b>hairs.</b> This original work is expected to provide inspiration for exploring other natural materials to reveal their smart functions and natural laws in animals including human as well as making more remarkable synthetic smart materials.
