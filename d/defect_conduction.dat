40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the impact of new <b>conduction</b> <b>defects</b> after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) {{on the evolution of}} left ventricular (LV) function during 1 -year follow-up. BackgroundNew left bundle branch block (LBBB) or need for permanent pacing due to atrioventricular (AV) block are frequent after TAVI. MethodsA total of 90 consecutive patients treated with TAVI and who had 12 -month echocardiographic follow-up were included in the study. In 39 patients, a new <b>conduction</b> <b>defect</b> (new LBBB or need for permanent pacemaker activity.) persisted 1 month after TAVI. In 51 patients, no persistent new <b>conduction</b> <b>defect</b> was observed. Two-dimensional echocardiography using parasternal short-axis, apical 4 -chamber, and apical 2 -chamber views was performed before TAVI and at 1 -year follow-up to determine LV volumes and ejection fraction based on Simpson's rule. Speckle-tracking echocardiography was applied using standard LV short-axis images to assess the effect of new <b>conduction</b> <b>defects</b> on time-to-peak radial strain of different LV segments as a parameter of LV dyssynchrony. ResultsNew <b>conduction</b> <b>defects</b> resulted in marked heterogeneity in time-to-peak strain between the 6 analyzed short-axis segments. During 1 -year follow-up after TAVI, there was a significant increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients without new LBBB (53 ± 11 % pre TAVI to 59 ± 10 % at follow-up; p < 0. 001), whereas there was no change in LVEF in patients with a new <b>conduction</b> <b>defect</b> (52 ± 11 % pre TAVI to 51 ± 12 % at follow-up, p = 0. 740). Change in LV end-systolic volume was also significantly different between patient groups (− 1. 0 ± 14. 2 vs. − 11. 2 ± 15. 7 ml, p = 0. 042). New <b>conduction</b> <b>defect</b> and LVEF at baseline were independent predictors of reduced LVEF at 12 -month follow-up after TAVI.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Increased {{dispersion}} of ventricular repolarization {{has been shown}} to be a marker for increased risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmias in various cardiac disorders. The present study is aimed at comparing the values of four dispersion indices in four clinical groups: normal subjects (n = 23), patients with intraventricular <b>conduction</b> <b>defects</b> (QRS > 0. 12 s) without underlying cardiac disease (n = 30), patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 36), and patients with both dilated cardiomyopathy and ventricular <b>conduction</b> <b>defects</b> (n = 18). METHODS: On an averaged cycle from a 10 s record of 15 simultaneous leads (12 -lead ECG and XYZ leads), and after interactive editing, four intervals were computed: JTapex, JTend, QTapex and QTend. For each interval, the dispersion is defined as the difference between the maximal and minimal values across the 15 leads. RESULTS: The mean values of all four dispersion indices were significantly smaller in the normal group than in the three other groups (P < 0. 001). Among patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, those with intraventricular <b>conduction</b> <b>defects</b> had significantly higher dispersion values than those without, even disregarding the QRS duration (P < 0. 01). Thus, patients with both dilated cardiomyopathy and ventricular <b>conduction</b> <b>defects</b> have larger dispersion values than patients with ventricular <b>conduction</b> <b>defects</b> alone (P < 0. 01) and than those with dilated cardiomyopathy without intraventricular <b>conduction</b> <b>defects.</b> CONCLUSION: Dispersion of ventricular repolarization is increased in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, especially in those with ventricular <b>conduction</b> <b>defects,</b> suggesting that they are at higher risk of arrhythmic events...|$|R

These data matched the clinical observations on patients with SCN 5 A loss-of-function mutations with either severe or mild <b>conduction</b> <b>defects.</b> Ventricular tachycardia developed in 5 / 10 old severely affected Scn 5 a(+/-) mice but not in mildly affected ones. Correspondingly, symptomatic SCN 5 A-mutated Brugada patients had more severe <b>conduction</b> <b>defects</b> than asymptomatic patients. Old severely affected Scn 5 a(+/-) mice but not mildly affected ones showed extensive cardiac fibrosis. Mildly affected Scn 5 a(+/-) mice had similar Na(v) 1. 5 mRNA but higher Na(v) 1. 5 protein expression, and moderately larger I(Na) current than severely affected Scn 5 a(+/-) mice.

BackgroundProgressive cardiac <b>conduction</b> <b>defect</b> is a frequent disease commonly attributed to degeneration and fibrosis of the His bundle and its branches. In a French family, we have identified a splicing mutation in the SCN 5 Agene leading to hereditary progressive cardiac <b>conduction</b> <b>defect.</b> MethodsWe have extended the size of the pedigree and phenotyped and genotyped all family members, and also investigated in vitro the functional consequences of the mutation. ResultsAmong 65 potentially affected members, 25 individuals were carriers of the IVS. 22 + 2 T→C SCN 5 Amutation. In relation to aging, gene carriers exhibit various types of <b>conduction</b> <b>defects.</b> P-wave, PR, and QRS duration increased progressively with age in gene carriers and in noncarriers. Whatever the age, conduction parameters were longer in gene carriers. The widening in the QRS complex with aging was more pronounced in gene carriers older than 40 years. Functional studies show that the IVS. 22 + 2 T→C SCN 5 Amutation lead to exon 22 skipping and to a complete loss of function of the affected allele, but to a normal trafficking of the mutated gene product.

40|$|Recognition of the ECG {{characteristics}} {{associated with}} bundle branch and fascicular blocks {{is important for}} identification of new or worsening cardiac disease. These characteristics often herald {{an increased risk of}} mortality for patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Clinicians need to have an understanding of the ECG changes associated with bundle branch blocks in order to distinguish between these changes and those associated with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Intraventricular <b>conduction</b> <b>defects</b> result from a delay or obstruction in an area of the conduction system below the bundle of His. 1 <b>Conduction</b> <b>defects</b> may be due to a complete obstruction of either the right or left bundle branches or may be located further down the conduction system in either the left anterior or left posterior fascicle. These regions of the conduction system are responsible for activation of the ventricles. Therefore, ECG changes associated with intraventricular <b>conduction</b> <b>defects</b> are mostly seen in the QRS complex. The ability of clinicians to identify newly acquired intraventricular <b>conduction</b> <b>defects</b> such as bundle branch blocks is important because their presence in ACS has implications for patient prognosis and urgency of treatment aimed at revascularization. 2 and 3 This article is the second in a 2 -part series on ECG interpretation.

40|$|International audienceINTRODUCTION: Loss-of-function {{mutations}} in the SCN 5 A gene encoding the cardiac sodium channel {{are responsible for}} Brugada syndrome (BS) and also for progressive cardiac conduction disease (inherited Lenègre disease). In an attempt to clarify the frontier between these two entities, we have characterized cardiac <b>conduction</b> <b>defect</b> and its evolution with aging in a cohort of 78 patients carrying a SCN 5 A mutation linked to Brugada syndrome. METHODS AND RESULTS: Families {{were included in the}} study if a SCN 5 A mutation was identified in a BS proband and if at least two family members were mutation carriers. Sixteen families met the study criteria, representing 78 carriers. Resting ECG showed a spontaneous BS ECG pattern in 28 of 78 (36 %) gene carriers. Intraventricular conduction anomalies were identified in 59 of 78 gene carriers including complete (17) or incomplete (24) right bundle branch block, right bundle branch block plus hemiblock (6), left bundle branch block (1), hemiblock (1), and parietal block (10). PR and QRS duration were longer in the gene carrier cohort in comparison with their relatives carrying no mutation. Finally, in the gene carrier cohort <b>conduction</b> <b>defect</b> progressively aggravated with aging leading in five occasions to pacemaker implantations. CONCLUSION: The present study shows that the most common phenotype of gene carriers of a BS-type SCN 5 A mutation is progressive cardiac <b>conduction</b> <b>defects</b> similar to the Lenègre disease phenotype. In consequence, we propose that carriers of a SCN 5 A mutation need a clinical and ECG follow-up because of the risk associated with severe <b>conduction</b> <b>defects...</b>|$|R

In the present study, we examined, in the diabetic bio-breeding Worcester rat, the short- and long-term effects of acetyl-L-carnitine administration on peripheral nerve polyols, myoinositol, Na+/K+ -ATPase, vasoactive prostaglandins, nerve conduction velocity, and pathologic changes. Short-term prevention (4 mo) with acetyl-L-carnitine had no effects on nerve polyols, but corrected the Na+/K+ -ATPase defect and was associated with 63 % prevention of the nerve <b>conduction</b> <b>defect</b> and complete prevention of structural changes. Long-term prevention (8 mo) and intervention (from 4 to 8 mo) with acetyl-L-carnitine treatment normalized nerve PGE(1) whereas 6 -keto PGF(1 -alpha) and PGE(2) were unaffected. In the prevention study, the <b>conduction</b> <b>defect</b> was 73 % prevented and structural abnormalities attenuated.

40|$|The QT {{interval}} of the electrocardiogram is prolonged in {{right and left}} bundle-branch block. Since the QT interval is not prolonged outside the normal range due to myocardial disease alone, this lengthening of the QT interval {{is due to the}} <b>conduction</b> <b>defect</b> and is probably due to delayed depolarization (and thus repolarization) of the heart. There is, however, {{a significant difference in the}} QT interval in left and right bundle-branch block (t = 386; P< ooi), since the QT was shorter in right than in left bundle-branch block. This may be due to the completion of normal repolarization in the left ventricle, so that only in some cases of right bundle-branch block does repolarization end in the right ventricle. Correction of the actual QTc for the <b>conduction</b> <b>defect</b> of left bundle-branch block can be made by sub-tracting theprolongation of the QRS due to the blockfrom the actual QTc.
