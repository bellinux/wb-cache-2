Mitogenic and mechanotransduction signals are known to be mediated by G protein-coupled receptors. Therefore in this study we examined the alterations in G protein expression and receptor coupling in vein grafts stented with <b>external</b> tube <b>support.</b> Thirty New Zealand White male rabbits had a right carotid interposition bypass graft with use of the ipsilateral jugular vein. Fifteen animals received <b>external</b> <b>support</b> and 15 were controls. In a subset the animals either had removal of the <b>external</b> <b>support</b> or a sham-control neck exploration at 14 days after the initial implantation (n = 5 per group). <b>External</b> <b>support</b> reduced G alpha i 3 proteins by 30 % in vein grafts without changes in G alpha s by Western blot. Vein grafts with <b>external</b> <b>support</b> were significantly less sensitive to pertussis toxin inactivation than controls were in response to both norepinephrine and serotonin. A 24 % decrease in intimal thickness was maintained after withdrawal of the initial <b>external</b> <b>support.</b> The placement of an <b>external</b> <b>support</b> is associated with alternations in G protein expression and receptor coupling function in vein grafts. The {{results of this study suggest}} that the development of vein graft intimal hyperplasia may involve G protein-mediated events...|$|R

50|$|It was a double-octagonal temple {{building}} comprised {{an inner}} wall, which formed the cella or sanctuary, {{surrounded by an}} outer wall forming an ambulatory, or covered walkway. The outer portico measures about 56½ feet in diameter, the inner cellar about 32 feet across. All walls were about 3 feet thick. Along each wall were two features described by Rahtz as buttresses but {{were more likely to}} have been pilasters, as their small size would render them ineffective as wall supports. Warwick Rodwell suggests that the ambulatory would have been cross-vaulted and the pilasters used as <b>external</b> <b>supports</b> for this. This would allow for a good deal of natural light to circulate the building and give an aesthetically balanced look to the structure. The ambulatory would then give the illusion of a labyrinth of side chambers running off from the central area.|$|E
50|$|In 1972, Kansas City {{successfully}} lured a National Basketball Association {{team to the}} city, the Cincinnati Royals, {{with promises}} of building a new indoor arena. Kemper Arena, {{which was the first}} major project by architect Helmut Jahn, was built in 18 months from 1973 to 1974 at the former location of the Kansas City Stockyards in the West Bottoms. Its construction was financed by general obligation bonds, donated land from the stockyards, donations from the American Royal and R. Crosby Kemper Sr. The arena was considered an architectural gem because of how fast it could be built, and the fact that with <b>external</b> <b>supports,</b> there were no obstructions to sight lines. The arena was seen as the crowning achievement for luring the 1976 Republican Convention. The arena also resulted in Kansas City being awarded a National Hockey League expansion team, the Kansas City Scouts, which began play in 1974.|$|E

50|$|The patella is a {{floating}} sesamoid bone {{held in place}} by the quadriceps muscle tendon and patellar tendon ligament. Exercises should strengthen quadriceps muscles such as rectus femoris, vastus intermedius, and vastus lateralis. However, tight and strong lateral quadriceps can be an underlying cause of patellar dislocation. If this is the case, it is advisable to strengthen the medial quadriceps, vastus medialis (VMO), and stretch the lateral muscles. Exercises to strengthen quadriceps muscles include, but are not limited to, squats and lunges. Adding extra external support around the knee by using devices such as knee orthotics or athletic tape can help to prevent patellar dislocation and other knee-related injuries. <b>External</b> <b>supports,</b> such as knee braces and athletic tape, work by providing movement in only the desired planes and help hinder movements that can cause abnormal movement and injuries. Women who wear high heels tend to develop short calf muscles and tendons. Exercises to stretch and strengthen calf muscles are recommended on a daily basis.|$|E
5000|$|The {{best known}} {{surviving}} round churches of Denmark (rundkirke) {{are on the}} island of Bornholm. They were built in the twelfth century, but exact dates are not known. They have been modified repeatedly. Their significance lies in their fortress-like outer-walls with large buttresses, which bear the weight of a round barrel vault along with a central pillar. [...] All the round churches of Bornholm, except for Ny Kirke, are fortified churches. The central pillar is often decorated with a painted frieze. Originally, the round churches had flat roofs with battlements (for defence). Their characteristic conical roofs were first added in the late middle ages. The weight of these roofs rests on the outer walls, making strong <b>external</b> <b>supports</b> necessary, which are especially distinctive on the church of Østerlars. The first three churches in the list below have three stories, the Ny Kirke has two stories. The upper stories are only accessible by narrow passages and served the local people as a refuge against pirate raids.|$|E
50|$|Pediatric consultation-liaison psychologists need to {{be aware}} of {{individual}} and developmental factors when designing interventions to help children adapt to the stressors of illness or injury and treatment; for example, limited linguistic and cognitive abilities limit the knowledge and understanding of health concepts of younger children, thus limiting their ability to use internal coping resources and reach out to <b>external</b> <b>supports</b> when compared to older children or adolescents. Children's coping styles also differ; for example, some children attempt to gather information and familiarize themselves with upcoming procedures, whereas others avoid discussing stressors and refuse to look at or distract themselves from stressful stimuli. Differences in coping styles have been shown to be associated with the child's adaptation to surgery and hospitalization, lower physiological stress response, and child cooperation pre- and post-surgery. There is evidence suggesting that primary control, strategies whereby a child modifies the objective situation, are most effective when employed to cope with stressors over which the child has control, whereas secondary control strategies, strategies involving the child modifying emotional and behavioral reactions to the stressor, are most effective with uncontrollable stressors.|$|E
40|$|<b>External</b> <b>support</b> {{has been}} a {{prominent}} feature of many internal conflicts during the past half-century. Existing literature has often cited <b>external</b> <b>support</b> as playing {{a key role in}} these conflicts. The many high quality recent works looking at <b>external</b> <b>support</b> reflect this realization. Despite this, a number of important questions about <b>external</b> <b>support</b> remain unanswered. This dissertation addresses three important unresolved questions through three different papers. These questions reflect three broad issues of concern: (1) When is <b>external</b> <b>support</b> likely to occur? (2) What impact does <b>external</b> <b>support</b> have on combatant capabilities? (3) To what extent is a supporter able to influence a combatant? Existing work has highlighted the important role that combatant capability plays in influencing the occurrence of support. Combatant capabilities, however, are not likely to have the same impact on the provision of support regardless of the reason why a supporter would become involved. The first play theorizes about this issue as well as conducts preliminary analysis using new time-varying data of when support is likely to be provided. Similarly, although the influence of <b>external</b> <b>support</b> has largely been assumed in existing academic work—and given limited testing—much recent policy work casts doubt on this influence. Using new disaggregated data on combatant capabilities and the provision of <b>external</b> <b>support,</b> the second paper seeks to identify the impact of support. Support, broadly, is found to heavily impact the ability of rebels to produce large capable forces that are protected from state attacks; this impact, however, depends on the type of support provided. Finally, a main concern for supporters is that they are able to influence the behavior of particular rebel groups. Using supporter influence over rebel use of one-sided violence as an indicator of supporter ability to influence, paper three develops and tests a theory of the conditions required for influence to occur. For influence to occur, a rebel must be reliant on the supporter, the supporter should not be reliant on the rebel, and the supporter must have an incentive to spend resources to exert control...|$|R

Seventeen female volleyball players (18. 94 ± 2. 49 years; 65. 45 ± 9. 49 kg; 1. 71 ± 0. 05 m; BMI= 22. 0 ± 2. 67 kg/m²) took part in this study. The dynamic balance was assessed through the Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT). Comparisons between stabilization (no stabilizer/NS, orthosis/ORT and functional bandaging/FB) modes and the SEBT grid lines and inter-limb were carried out. The SEBT assessment showed a significant difference between the groups NS x ORT and NS x FB (p <. 01), and between the lines (p<. 01). Significant line/limb interaction in DL and NDL (p<. 01) was detected. The <b>external</b> <b>supports</b> tested herein showed similar effects on balance, restricting lower limb's reach in the SEBT execution in some of tested directions...|$|E
30|$|So {{is there}} {{evidence}} of interview bias? In total, the direct answer {{would appear to}} be no. The various <b>external</b> <b>supports</b> given to farmers are independent of the type of farmers and farmers’ choices but somewhat dependent on the specific goals and the interests of each organization that provides support. The main government support provided through extension services and subsidies on farm inputs such as fertilizer, as well as all other government <b>external</b> <b>supports</b> target all communities except where a particular support is deemed unsuitable based on geophysical characteristics of the recipient community with respect to crop type. Conversely, <b>external</b> <b>supports</b> provided by organizations other than the government do not typically target all communities. Instead, such supports are more crop-specific and sometimes dependent on geophysical characteristics of the recipient community. Such organizations only receive technical advice from MOFA extension officers. Insofar as there is typically a lack of coordination among these organizations in rendering these adaptation supports in the area, most farmers are usually not consulted or involved for their opinion in the initiation of such supports. Nonetheless farmers tend to view any type of support as an opportunity. The spatial and temporal variations of such supports are therefore independent of the farmers’ choices or opinions, but solely dependent on the goals, interests and decisions of the organizations providing such supports. The spatio-temporal variation in the kinds of external support observed is therefore likely independent of the types of farmers in the study area and/or the interviewers responsible for the collection of data.|$|E

40|$|A {{consequence}} of a logic program under answer set semantics {{is one that is}} true for all answer sets. This article considers using loop formulas to compute some of these consequences in order to increase the efficiency of answer set solvers. Since computing loop formulas are in general intractable, we consider only loops with either no <b>external</b> <b>support</b> or at most one <b>external</b> <b>support,</b> as their loop formulas are either unit or binary clauses. We show that for disjunctive logic programs, loop formulas of loops with no <b>external</b> <b>support</b> can be computed in polynomial time, and that an iterative procedure using unit propagation on these formulas and the program completion computes the well-founded models in the case of normal logic programs and the least fixed point of a simplification operator used by DLV for disjunctive logic programs. For loops with at most one <b>external</b> <b>support,</b> their loop formulas can be computed in polynomial time for normal logic programs, but are NP-hard for disjunctive programs. So for normal logic programs, we have a procedure similar to the iterative one for loops without any <b>external</b> <b>support,</b> but for disjunctive logic programs, we present a polynomial approximation algorithm. All these algorithms have been implemented, and our experiments show that for certain logic programs, the consequences computed by our algorithms can significantly speed up current ASP solvers cmodels, clasp, and DLV...|$|R
