50|$|In 1821 Thomas Seebeck {{discovered}} that the junction between two metals generates a voltage that {{is a function of}} temperature. If a closed circuit consists of conductors of two different metals, and if one junction of the two metals is at a higher temperature than the other, an electromotive force is created in a specific polarity. An example of this is in the case of copper and iron, the electrons first flow along the iron from the <b>hot</b> <b>junction</b> to the cold one. The electrons cross from the iron to the copper at the <b>hot</b> <b>junction,</b> and from the copper to the iron at the cold junction. This property of electromotive force production is known as the Seebeck effect. This effect is utilized in the most widely employed method of thermometry.|$|E
