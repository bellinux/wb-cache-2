40|$|A {{study on}} the {{determination}} of organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs), namely <b>glufosinate-ammonium</b> and malathion in residue from palm pressed fiber (PPF). Three PPF samples were taken from three different areas, FELDA Lepar, FELDA Chini 1 and FELDA Chini 2. The extraction of oil residue in PPF was carried out using supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), using supercritical carbon dioxide (CO 2) at 3000 psi in isothermal in 60 °C for 60 minutes. Residue then were diluted uisng acetonitrile. Chromatogram of peak analyte was determine using Waters Alliance high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) Dissolution System Series liquid chromatography interfaced to a 2998 Photodiode Array Detector. Determination was first done using standard malathion and <b>glufosinate-ammonium</b> of 10, 15 and 20 ppm run on a iscoratic elution mode for 30 minutes. Optimization method later was done using water and acetonitrile as mobile phase and run for 16 minutes for malathion and 20 minutes for <b>glufosinate-ammonium.</b> Malathion peak is retained at 8. 0 minutes while <b>glufosinate-ammonium</b> at 16. 0 minutes. Calibration curve of the standards were plot with R 2 values of 0. 9085 for malathion and 0. 9249 for <b>glufosinate-ammonium.</b> The detection limits (LOD) were 10. 3 mg/L for malathion and 14. 1 mg/L for <b>glufosinate-ammonium.</b> Later, determination of malathion and <b>glufosinate-ammonium</b> were done on real samples.

40|$|International audienceThe main {{objective}} of this experiment was to estimate field-scale runoff losses of glyphosate and <b>glufosinate-ammonium</b> under natural rainfall conditions. Investigations were carried out at the Runoff Monitoring Station of the University of Bologna (Italy). Glyphosate and <b>glufosinate-ammonium</b> were applied as pre-emergence herbicides on 350 -m 2 field plots characterized by a uniform slope of 15 %. Field plots were cultivated with corn. The persistence and sorption isotherms of the two herbicides were also determined. During the 3 -year experimental period low runoff volumes were observed. More specifically, annual runoff volumes did not exceed 4. 7 mm. Glyphosate and <b>glufosinate-ammonium</b> concentrations in collected runoff samples rapidly declined with time. The highest glyphosate and <b>glufosinate-ammonium</b> concentrations were 16 and 24 µg L- 1, respectively. These peaks were observed in a runoff event occurring 1 day after herbicide treatment. The total maximum amount of glyphosate and <b>glufosinate-ammonium</b> losses were 0. 031 and 0. 064 ‰ of the applied active ingredients, respectively. On {{the basis of the}} obtained results, both glyphosate and <b>glufosinate-ammonium</b> showed low potential to contaminate surface water resources. These results were supported by their estimated short persistence and strong sorption in soil. The half-lives of glyphosate and <b>glufosinate-ammonium</b> were 17. 5 and 6. 4 days, respectively, and their distribution coefficients (Kd) were 746. 6 and 23. 4 mL g- 1, respectively...|$|E

However, no information {{on the influence of}} these insecticidal toxins on the persistence in soil of herbicides is available. Preliminary results regarding the influence of insecticidal toxins extracted from a commercial formulation of B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (Berliner) (Btk) on the degradation of the herbicides glyphosate and <b>glufosinate-ammonium</b> in a loam and a sandy loam soil, under laboratory conditions, were obtained. Soil microbial carbon (SMC) and insecticidal activity of incubated soil samples were also estimated. In both soil types, persistence of GLYP was significantly higher with respect to GLUF. Average GLYP and GLUF half-life was 14. 4 and 8. 0 days, respectively. Addition of Btk toxins lead to a significant increase of GLYP and GLUP persistence in both soil types. More specifically, average GLYP and GLUF half-life in soil samples receiving the Btk treatment was 24. 3 and 14. 2 days, respectively. In contrast to herbicide persistence in soil, Btk toxins did not influence microbial carbon content of incubated soil samples. The insecticidal activity of Btk toxins in soil rapidly decreased during the 28 -day incubation time. Considering that degradation of GLYP and GLUF was mainly a microbial process, the absence of effects of Btk toxins on the soil microbial carbon and the rapid decrease of insecticidal activity of Btk toxins in the soil suggest a possible effec...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTDepending on the cultivar, {{the use of}} {{desiccants}} in the preharvest can favor {{maintenance of}} physiological quality. The objective {{of the study was}} to assess the physiological quality of soybean seeds as due to the use of apreharvest desiccant and desiccation time in two harvests (2011 / 12 and 2012 / 13). The treatments were five soybean cultivars, two growth stages of application, a control (without desiccant application), and three desiccants (<b>glufosinate-ammonium,</b> carfentrazone-ethyl and paraquat) (2011 / 12 harvest). In the 2012 / 13 harvest the carfentrazone-ethyl desiccant was replaced by diquat. The physiological quality of seeds was assessed by the percentage of viability and vigor (cold test, tetrazolium test and accelerated aging test). In 2011 / 12 harvest, there was an early harvest in six days with the use of <b>glufosinate-ammonium</b> and paraquat desiccants, when desiccation was done in stage R 7. 1, with maintenance of seed quality; however it was dependent on the cultivar. In the 2012 / 13 harvest there was no early harvesting due to the presence of rain in the preharvest and the use of desiccation did not affect the physiological quality of the seeds either. Cultivar NA 5909 RG was more tolerant to remaining in the cultivation environment and maintained higher viability than 90 % and greater vigor of 71 % by the cold test compared to cultivar BMX Turbo (2011 / 12 harvest).

40|$|A {{glasshouse}} {{experiment was}} set up to compare processes and organisms in two soils planted with genetically modified (GM) herbicide tolerant (HT) maize treated with appropriate herbicides. This was part of a wider project (ECOGEN) looking at the consequences of GM cropping systems on soil biology using a tiered approach at laboratory, glasshouse and field scales. Soil for the experiment was taken from field sites where the same maize cultivars were grown to allow comparison between results under glasshouse and field conditions. The maize cultivars T 25 (GM HT <b>glufosinate-ammonium</b> tolerant), Orient (non HT near isogenic control for T 25) and Monumental (a conventional, non HT variety) were grown in contrasting sandy loam and clay loam soils, half were sprayed with the appropriate herbicide as used in the field and soil samples were taken at the five-leaf and flowering plant growth stage. The main effects on all measured parameters were those of soil type and plant growth stage, with four categories of subsequent interaction: (1) there were no effects of herbicide on plant growth or soil microarthropods: (2) the maize cultivar (but not the GM HT trait) had effects on the decomposition of cotton strips and the nematode community; (3) herbicide application in general altered the community level physiological profile of the microbial community and reduced both soil basal respiration and the abundance of protozoa; and (4) the specific application of <b>glufosinate-ammonium</b> to T 25 maize altered soil microbial community structure measured by ester linked fatty acids.

In order to evaluate N loss in brachiaria (Brachiaria decumbens) after application of the herbicides glyphosate and <b>glufosinate-ammonium,</b> an experiment was carried out in a greenhouse as a completely randomized design, with three treatments and six replicates. Treatments were as follows: i) desiccation of brachiaria-plants with glyphosate; ii) desiccation of brachiaria-plants with glufosinate-ammonium; and iii) control, without herbicide application. The plants were cultivated in 4 kg pots of sandy soil and fertilized with ammonium sulfate- 15 N, (200 mg kg- 1) in order to quantify the allocation of the fertilizer-N and its recovery in the soil-plant system. Plants treated with the herbicides had less N accumulation and less recovery of the fertilizer-N (15 N) relative to the control. In the soil, the greatest recovery of 15 N-fertilizer occurred for treatments where N was applied, possibly due to the occurrence of other N compound losses to the soil, like root exudation and root death.

The control of dicotyledonous weeds with herbicides is well justified in the sowing year because the control remains insufficient {{in the subsequent}} years of seed production. However, the control of weeds in the years of seed production reduces the expenditures for seed harvest, drying and cleaning. The control of couch grass is necessary and gives good results on the years of seed harvesting.

40|$|Herbicide dose optimisation, i. e. {{maximising}} {{weed control}} and crop yield with herbicide dose, {{is an important}} part of integrated weed management strategies. However, the adoption of optimised dose technology and variable rate application has been limited because of the relatively long period between herbicide treatment and the time when efficacy can be visually assessed. Herbicide dose optimisation could therefore benefit from simple methods that allow early prediction of plant mortality. Early prediction would allow better management decisions, e. g. timely retreatment in case of uncontrolled weeds. The focus of this study was the relationship between leaf photosynthesis soon after herbicide treatment and subsequent plant mortality, with the aim of determining whether the former could predict the latter. Data from 28 glasshouse experiments were analysed. In these experiments, herbicides from five modes of action groups were tested on five plant species. Leaf photosynthesis was measured with two mobile meters up to 1 week after herbicide treatment. Leaf photosynthesis was affected by plant species, leaf number, herbicide species, dose and time. Large changes in leaf photosynthesis were observed with photosynthesis-inhibiting herbicides, intermediate changes were noted with glyphosate, <b>glufosinate-ammonium</b> and sulcotrione, and no changes were detected with MCPA. Threshold values associated with plant mortality were then determined. These values can be used to assess the risk of uncontrolled weeds treated with variable herbicide doses...|$|E

We performed on-farm pesticide use surveys during 87 weeks and monitored pesticides in water weekly during 67 weeks at the outlet of a small catchment in Martinique. We identified three types of pollution. First, we showed long-term chronic pollution by chlordecone, diuron and metolachlor resulting from horticultural practices applied 5 - 20 years ago (quantification frequency higher than 80 %). Second, we showed peak pollution. High amounts of propiconazole and fosthiazate applied at low frequencies caused river pollution peaks for weeks following a single application. Low amounts of diquat and diazinon applied at low frequencies also caused pollution peaks. The high amounts of glyphosate applied at high frequency resulted into pollution peaks by glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) in 6 and 20 % of the weeks. Any intensification of their uses will result in higher pollution levels. Third, relatively low amounts of <b>glufosinate-ammonium,</b> difenoconazol, spinosad and metaldehyde were applied at high frequencies. Unexpectedly, such pesticides remained barely detected (< 1. 5 %) or undetected in water samples. We showed that AMPA, fosthiazate and propiconazole have serious leaching potential.

In a model study, sugarcane variety NCo 310 was genetically modified for resistance to the herbicide Buster ® (hereafter referred to as Buster) (<b>glufosinate–ammonium</b> 200 g a. i. /L). In preliminary studies under semi-controlled field conditions, young transgenic sugarcane plants were asymptomatic when sprayed with up to 7. 0 L/ha of Buster, while untransformed plants were killed at 4. 0 L/ha. A field trial to assess possible physiological differences between transformed and untransformed sugarcane and to compare different Buster applications was established. This trial included a plant and first ratoon crop. Buster was either used alone as a repeated ‘chemical hoe ’ application, or in conjunction with pre-emergence herbicides. Further treatments included an industry standard programme without Buster, and a handweeded control. The transformed sugarcane expressed complete tolerance to Buster, while phytotoxicity in the untransformed cane was severe. Due to weed competition, yields of hand-weeded and Buster only treatments were inferior to those of treatments that included pre-emergence herbicides. The results also confirmed the economic advantages of early weed control. It is therefore unlikely that only one product would be recommended for use with herbicide resistant sugarcane. Yields of untransformed cane were significantly higher than transformed cane in non-Buster treatments. In addition, the transformed cane had thinner stalks and higher fibre % cane levels, which suggested that there were indirect physiological effects of the transformation process...|$|E
40|$|The outcrossing of {{transgenic}} {{oilseed rape}} in the neighbourhood is of major concern {{with regard to}} the actual EU labelling threshold of 0. 9 % for transgenic contamination in food and feed and the regulations for the co-existence of cultivation of genetically modified crops, conventional and organic farming. In a two-year field trial, the outcrossing frequencies and distribution from plots with different ratios of transgenic plants (100 %, 1. 0 % and 0. 1 %) containing the pat-gene for resistance towards the broad-range herbicide <b>glufosinate-ammonium</b> were determined in surrounding acceptor plots within a distance of 3 – 11 m. Randomly distributed outcrossing with isolated pollination events became apparent, and an average gene flow of 0. 28 %, 0. 01 % and 0. 0065 % was detected for 100 %, 1. 0 % and 0. 1 % transgenic donor plots, respectively. Significant effects on the distribution of outcrossing were found for distance, but not for the prevailing wind direction. The random distribution in combination with the behaviour of honey-bees and bumble-bees gives strong evidence that insects play an important role for short distance gene dispersal. A curve fit assuming an exponential decline was performed with the experimental outcrossing data as a function of distance and was applied to the actual EU labelling threshold. The contamination limit of 0. 9 % in food and feed could be kept without cultivation distances to the transgenic source. The impact of effective detection limits of analytical methods on the establishment of specific rules for the co-existence is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) engenders {{special concern}} {{regarding}} gene flow, {{due to its}} potential for outcrossing, for volunteer emergence and to form temporary feral populations. If different genetically engineered (GE) herbicide-resistant oilseed rape cultivars are grown in neighboring fields, seeds and subsequent volunteers with multiple herbicide resistances (HR) can arise. 1 If multiple resistant volunteer plants are not removed, e. g., by using an appropriate herbicide, they {{can serve as a}} source or sink for further cross-pollination. 2 In addition to potential problems with multiple resistant volunteers following crop rotations, the combination (´stacking`) of different GE traits in one plant may affect HR gene expression and thereby the reliability of expression-based transgene detection. In a recent paper, 3 we presented the results of a biennial large-scale field experiment with two different GE oilseed rape lines cultivated on adjacent plots to investigate the frequencies of HR gene dispersal, the expression of HR genes in double-resistant plants, and the sensitivity of plants to conventional herbicides.

40|$|Herbicides {{are widely}} used in soybean for weed control, and the {{selection}} pressure attributed to the repeated use of herbicides with similar modes of action on the same site has caused selection for resistant biotypes within and among previously susceptible species, such as Euphorbia heterophylla L., in relation to ALS enzyme inhibitors, in the states of Paraná, Rio Grande do Sul, and São Paulo, Brazil. Seeds of E. heterophylla were collected to examine possible new cases of resistant populations and to test alternative herbicide treatments to manage these populations, in the Caarapó region, State of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, in areas where plants of this species have survived continuous herbicide applications. The experiment was carried out under greenhouse conditions, where biotypes {{with a history of}} suspected resistance were compared with a known susceptible biotype. Several post-emergence herbicides were sprayed at zero, one, two, four, and eight times the recommended field application rates. Twenty days after application, plants were harvested, and control percentage and fresh weight were determined to establish dose-response curves, in the aim to obtain the resistance factor using CD 50 and RD 50 data. The chlorimuron-ethyl resistance factor values for the control percentage and fresh weight parameters were higher than 16. 5 and 16. 9, respectively, while imazethapyr showed resistance factors higher than 25. 0 and 23. 5, respectively. The resistant biotype showed different resistance levels to chlorimuron-ethyl and imazethapyr, showing cross-resistance to the sulfonylurea and imidazolinone groups.

40|$|With the {{potential}} advent {{of genetically modified}} herbicide-resistant (GMHR) crops in the European Union, changes in patterns of herbicide use are predicted. Broad-spectrum, non-selective herbicides used with GMHR crops are expected to substitute {{for a set of}} currently used herbicides, which might alter the agro-environmental footprint from crop production. To test this hypothesis, the environmental impact of various herbicide regimes currently used with non-GMHR maize in Belgium was calculated and compared with that of possible herbicide regimes applied in GMHR maize. Impacts on {{human health and the environment}} were calculated through the pesticide occupational and environmental risk (POCER) indicator. Results showed that the environmental impact of herbicide regimes solely relying on the active ingredients glyphosate (GLY) or <b>glufosinate-ammonium</b> (GLU) is lower than that of herbicide regimes applied in non-GMHR maize. Due to the lower potential of GLY and GLU to contaminate ground water and their lower acute toxicity to aquatic organisms, the POCER exceedence factor values for the environment were reduced approximately by a sixth when GLY or GLU is used alone. However, the environmental impact of novel herbicide regimes tested may be underestimated due to the assumption that active ingredients used with GMHR maize would be used alone. Data retrieved from literature suggest that weed control efficacy is increased and resistance development delayed when GLY or GLU is used together with other herbicides in the GMHR system. Due to the partial instead of complete replacement of currently used herbicide regimes, the beneficial environmental impact of novel herbicide regimes might sometimes be reduced or counterbalanced. Despite the high weed control efficacy provided by the biotechnology-based weed management strategy, neither indirect harmful effects on farmland biodiversity through losses in food resources and shelter, nor shifts in weed communities have been demonstrated in GMHR maize yet. However, with the increasing adoption rate of GMHR maize and their associated novel herbicide regimes, this situation is expected to change in the short-term...|$|E
40|$|At {{the end of}} April, {{the final}} set of results from the Farm Scale Evaluations (FSE) of GM herbicide-tolerant (GMHT) crops was {{published}} 1. This paper on winter-sown canola (oilseed rape) brought to a close the largest field experiment ever conducted on farmland ecology. The aim was to evaluate the impact on weed and invertebrate wildlife of an agricultural technology that {{had yet to be}} introduced in the UK. The FSE was established because of widely held concerns that GMHT crops (and GM in general) might exacerbate negative impacts upon farmland wildlife already apparent over the last four decades due to intensification of farming practices. There was concern that control of weeds in GMHT crops tolerant to broad-spectrum herbicides might be so efficient that it could help to clean up previously weedy fields, thereby enhancing long term declines in weeds and the wildlife depending on them. Others argued that GMHT crops might mitigate intensification by delaying and reducing herbicide use, allowing weeds and associated wildlife to remain in fields longer. Four GMHT crops were evaluated during the FSE in at least 65 fields per crop (266 in total). The spring-sown beet crop was genetically modified to be tolerant to the herbicide glyphosate, while the spring-sown maize and canola and the winter-sown canola were tolerant to <b>glufosinate-ammonium.</b> Each GMHT crop was compared from sowing to harvest with a conventional variety of the same crop to assess their impacts on components of farmland weed and invertebrate wildlife. The FSE was conducted as a randomized block experiment in which each field was split and the GMHT and conventional crop randomly assigned to each half of the field 2. Based on previous evidence, we assumed that it was not the GMHT construct itself that would exert effects on wildlife, but rather differences in the timing and type of herbicide management between the GMHT and conventional treatments. This assumption led directly to the null hypothesis, that there is no difference between herbicide management of GMHT crops and that of conventional cultivars, managed according to current conventional herbicide practice, in their affect on the abundance and diversity of weeds and invertebrates...|$|E
40|$|<b>Glufosinate-ammonium</b> (GLA) is a post-emergence {{herbicide}} that inhibits glutamine synthetase (GS), {{synthesis of}} glutamine from glutamate. This inhibition results in NH 4 + accumulation and ultimate plant death. GLA is usually effective as foliar spray at concentrations over 200 mg/L. Research on root applied GLA is lacking. The current research studied {{the effects of}} root-application of GLA on tomato plant growth, foliar NH 4 + accumulation, and ethylene evolution. ^ In a dose-response experiment under hydroponics, phytotoxicity symptoms appeared on tomato seedling with 25 or 50 mg GLA X at 6 days after treatment (DAT). Under soil conditions, GLA higher than 7. 5 mg/pot caused toxicity symptoms in 2 days. With 3 and 5 mg/pot symptoms appeared at 4 DAT. 1. 5 mg GLA/pot at 5 DAT. With an increase of GLA rate, shoot NH 4 + concentration increased in hydroponics or soil experiments. In a time course experiment, at 4 DAT, GLA at 25 mg/L caused foliar toxicity symptoms and overall stunting, and ethylene evolution increased dramatically. At 9 DAT, plants died. Accumulation of NH 4 + caused by GLA was mainly in the foliage and increased with time; that caused by exogenously supplied NH 4 + was in roots and non-phytotoxic during {{the duration of the}} experiments. ^ If AOA or STS was added into nutrient solution with GLA at 25 mg/L, AOA delayed the appearance of toxicity and NH 4 + accumulation but STS had no suppressive effects on their presence. AOA completely inhibited ethylene evolution during the experiment but STS did not low ethylene evolution by plant receiving GLA. ^ Effects of foliarly applied GLA and soil-applied GLA were compared. At 3 DAT, tomato plants sprayed with 1. 5 or 3 mg GLA/kg soil started showing symptoms on top leaves. At 5 DAT, all foliarly treated plants became poisoned by GLA, and those receiving 1. 5 or 3 mg GLA from soil started showing poisoning. Tomato plant growth was retarded slightly by GLA applied at more than 1. 5 mg/plant during 5 days of growth. ^ Effect of degradation time of efficacy on GLA in soil was studied. At 4 days after transplanting, GLA induced toxicity symptoms and reduced biomass. GLA after 5 -days degradation in soil caused higher shoot NH 4 + accumulation than 10 – 20 days degradation. ^ Root-applied GLA under hydrophonics or soil conditions can cause foliar toxicity symptoms, foliar accumulation of NH 4 +, and ethylene evolution on tomato plants. ...|$|E
