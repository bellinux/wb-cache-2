Like his father, <b>he</b> <b>one</b> day would become {{a director of the}} Farmers' Bank of Delaware.|$|E
500|$|Although a {{significant}} {{member of the}} troupe, Sylvester remained a relatively isolated figure; not only was <b>he</b> <b>one</b> of very few African-American members, he eschewed the group's more surrealist activities for {{what he saw as}} classier, more glamorous performances onstage. In the Cockettes' performances, he was usually given an entire scene to himself, often with little relevance to the narrative and theme {{of the rest of the}} show, although through doing so, he gained his own following. With a piano player named Peter Mintum, Sylvester worked on solo scenes in which he exhibited his interest in blues and jazz by imitating several of his musical idols like Billie Holiday and Josephine Baker. Adding to his image, Sylvester used the pseudonym [...] "Ruby Blue" [...] and described himself as [...] "Billie Holiday's cousin once removed." [...] Fascinated by black musical heritage, he read up on the subject and became a collector of [...] "negrobilia"; in some of his Cockette performances, he played up to racial stereotypes of African-Americans in order to ridicule the stereotypes themselves.|$|E

2500|$|Francesco Corteccia (July 27, 1502 – June 7, 1571) was an Italian composer, organist, {{and teacher}} of the Renaissance. [...] Not only was <b>he</b> <b>one</b> {{of the best known}} of the early composers of madrigals, and an {{important}} native Italian composer during a period of domination by composers from the Low Countries, but he was the most prominent musician in Florence for several decades during the reign of Cosimo I de' Medici.|$|E
2500|$|... "Just how President Roosevelt and his {{advisers}} hope to lift the exploited and oppressed out of the mire by increasing profits and raising {{the cost of living}} is too deep for me. If they believe employers will increase wages as their profits increase, then they believe the leopard can change his spots. They should know that increased profits only increase the appetite for profits. The desire for the accumulation of great wealth seems like a disease, and disease has never been cured by increasing its virulence. ...<b>he</b> <b>one</b> lasting solution {{is the end of the}} profit system." ...|$|E
2500|$|Not {{everything}} {{published in}} samizdat had political overtones. In 1963, Joseph Brodsky {{was charged with}} [...] "social parasitism" [...] and convicted for being nothing but a poet. His poems circulated in samizdat, with only four judged as suitable for official Soviet anthologies. In the mid-1960s, the Youngest Society of Geniuses, an unofficial literary group known by the acronym SMOG (Samoye Molodoye Obshchestvo Geniyev; the acronym also forms the Russian verb for I, <b>He,</b> <b>One</b> [...] "Could") issued an almanac titled The Sphinxes (Sfinksy) and collections of prose and poetry. Some of their writings were close to Russian avantgarde of the 1910s–1920s.|$|E

2500|$|... "Judaism emphatically rejects any {{concept of}} {{plurality}} {{with respect to}} God" [...] explicitly rejecting polytheism, dualism, and trinitarianism, which are [...] "incompatible with monotheism as Judaism understands it." [...] The unity of God is stated many times in Jewish tradition. It is the second of Maimonides's 13 principles of faith; Maimonides wrote that [...] "This God is One, not two or more than two, but One whose unity is different from all other unities that there are. He is not one as a genus, which contains many species, is one. Nor is <b>He</b> <b>one</b> as a body, containing parts and dimensions, is one. But His is a unity than {{which there is no}} other anywhere" [...] (Yad, Yesode Ha-Torah 1:7).|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 1922 season, Kirk was {{selected}} as a first-team end on several All-Western and All-American teams. [...] Harold Johnson of the Chicago American wrote that Kirk [...] "stands out" [...] among the ends:"Virtually every coach, critic and student of the pastime is agreed upon the choice of Bernie Kirk, left end of the undefeated Michigan machine. [...] Yost's star was good in every respect that a flanker could be. [...] Not only was <b>he</b> <b>one</b> of the most deadly tacklers in the circuit, but he was shifty and fleet in streaking down the field to nail the receivers of forward passes or punts. [...] He shone, too, at stopping end plays directed at him and was without a superior at spearing aerial shots from his comrades." ...|$|E
2500|$|Claymoor {{soon became}} one of the regulars at the journalists' hangout, Casa Capșa, frequenting a society that also {{included}} Nicolae Filipescu and N. T. Orășanu. Memoirist Constantin Bacalbașa recalls him as [...] "perfectly collegial", [...] "a very decent man". However, he also cautions that Claymoor [...] "was a journalist, but by no means was <b>he</b> <b>one</b> of the journalistic world; he lived inside the boyar society that had spawned and raised him". More controversially, from 1888, when he became a Romanian delegate to the Paris World Fair, Claymoor was depicted as a political client of the ruling Conservative Party. Reports of that have it that he was also considered for the Prefecture of Constanța County by the Theodor Rosetti cabinet. A local correspondent for Telegraphul noted, tongue-in-cheek: [...] "High-society ladies are in favor of [...] appointment, and so is the Muslim population, especially now [...] that we are celebrating Bayram." ...|$|E

2500|$|John Chrysostom {{described}} slavery as 'the {{fruit of}} covetousness, of degradation, of savagery ... {{the fruit of}} sin, [...] of [...] rebellion against ... our true Father' in his Homilies on Ephesians. Moreover, quoting partly from Paul the Apostle, Chrysostom opposed unfair and unjust forms of slavery by giving these instructions to those who owned slaves: [...] " [...] 'And ye masters', he continues, 'do the same things unto them'. The same things. What are these? 'With good-will do service' ... and 'with fear and trembling' ... toward God, fearing lest <b>He</b> <b>one</b> day accuse you for your negligence toward your slaves ... 'And forbear threatening;' be not irritating, he means, nor oppressive ... {{the law of the}} common Lord and Master of all ... doing good to all alike ... dispensing the same rights to all". Chrysostom preaching on [...] in a sermon entitled, [...] "Should we not make it a heaven on earth?", stated, [...] "I will not speak of slaves, since at that time there was no such thing, but doubtless such as were slaves they set at liberty...|$|E
